[18:46] morning here to give him praise, give
[18:47] him glory, give him honor. He's worthy
[18:50] of so much more. I was thinking this
[18:51] morning as we we talk about a sacrifice
[18:54] of praise. That's what the the word
[18:55] says. But I was thinking about the Old
[18:57] Testament and the sacrifice that they
[18:59] had to make and the ritual and all the
[19:01] work they had to do to come to the the
[19:04] temple. on the on the Sabbath day. A lot
[19:07] of work, a lot of sacrifice, had to get
[19:09] the right lamb, had to kill it, and and
[19:12] all the all the various rituals that
[19:14] went forth with the priest. All we have
[19:16] to do this morning is praise him. I
[19:18] thought, wow, we got we got we get we
[19:20] got a pretty easy time here. We're just
[19:22] here to praise him just as a small word.
[19:25] But we're here to praise the Lord. And
[19:27] that's uh that's what we'll we'll start
[19:29] this the service this morning with. I'll
[19:30] enter his gates with thanksgiving in my
[19:32] heart. And I'll just encourage you, give
[19:34] him the praise that you feel he deserves
[19:38] this morning. Well, I will enter his
[19:42] gates with thanksgiving in my heart. I
[19:46] will enter his courts with praise.
[19:52] Well, I will say this is the day that

[25:33] Father God in heaven, the maker of
[25:35] heaven and earth.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; We come before you, Lord, not because we
[25:40] are anything, but because you have made
[25:42] us something, Lord.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; You reached down into the God hand. You
[25:46] raised us up. You justified us. You
[25:48] sanctified us. And Lord, we are here to
[25:52] give you praise, to give you honor, to
[25:55] give you all the glory that is due to
[25:57] your matchless and wonderful name.
[26:00] Father, Lord, the enemy may have tried
[26:02] to distract us during during this past
[26:04] week. May have tried to put pressures on
[26:06] us. May may have tried to make us forget
[26:10] your word. But Lord, we are here as a
[26:12] reminder to the devil whose side we are
[26:14] on.
[26:15] Lord, we we we thank you, Father God,
[26:18] &gt;&gt; for what you have done for us,
[26:21] &gt;&gt; for for the big things and for the
[26:23] little things.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; We thank you for even the trials
[26:27] &gt;&gt; that you have sent to us, Father God, to
[26:29] hone us into the people that you want us
[26:32] to be, for your soon coming,
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, as we are here in this temple
[26:37] today. Father God, may you inhabit our
[26:39] praise.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; May you inhabit our glory that we have
[26:42] given to you, Lord.
[26:45] And father God, may you bless the word
[26:47] that you are bringing through your
[26:48] minister today, Father. Lord, may you
[26:50] bless the song leader. May you bless the
[26:51] musicians, Lord. Lord, may every aspect
[26:54] of this service be a sweet smelling
[26:57] savor to you, Lord. And Lord, may may
[27:00] not one person here live here the same
[27:03] way that they came here. May lives be
[27:06] changed. Yes, Lord.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; May miracles happen in in people's
[27:10] hearts
[27:11] &gt;&gt; that Lord, they would leave here with a
[27:13] renewed sense of vigor
[27:15] &gt;&gt; to live for you during the week.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, may may the anointing that is here
[27:21] right now that we feel. May he go with
[27:23] us in our schools and in our workplaces.
[27:26] And may our lives
[27:30] be the salt of the earth so that the
[27:31] people around us will know that this
[27:33] person is a Christian.

[27:51] you're seated this morning. Going to be
[27:54] part of the collective bride of the Lord
[27:56] Jesus this morning. All the licks of
[27:59] fire. Not just embers but licks of fire.
[28:03] Blessed be the name of the Lord. the
[28:04] Holy Ghost himself living in each of us.

[28:09] brought to each of us this morning. God
[28:12] is good all the time.

[28:18] through the valley
[28:21] and there are shadows
[28:24] all around.

[34:18] Thank you, Lord.
[34:20] Singing that last stanza, it just brings
[34:22] you to tears when you think about
[34:23] Brother Brandham's testimony of him
[34:25] going past the curtain. He said, "Some
[34:27] blind wouldn't touch it. Amazing.
[34:29] Wouldn't touch it. It was beyond
[34:30] anything you could describe with English
[34:31] language." And that's where we're
[34:33] headed. I was talking to my grandkids
[34:35] driving to to to church this morning.
[34:37] The millennium,
[34:39] the white throne, and the beautiful city
[34:41] of God. We have a tremendous future
[34:43] ahead of us. The the the future is
[34:45] bright for the children of God. Blessed
[34:47] be his name. Oh Lord, you're beautiful.
[34:49] How could we not sing this this morning?
[34:51] Oh Lord, you're beautiful. I don't think
[34:53] that's a right song. 893.
[34:55] Sorry, 8:26. I'm sorry.
[34:59] Sorry, I jumped a song. I'm sorry,
[35:00] brother. 8:26.
[35:02] Oh Lord,
[35:05] you're beautiful.
[35:11] Oh, your face
[35:14] is all I see.
[35:19] For when
[35:22] your eyes
[35:24] are on this child,
[35:28] your grace
[35:31] abounds
[35:33] to me. Stand with me if you would.
[35:34] Deacons when you come.
[35:37] Oh Lord,
[35:39] please light the fire
[35:45] that was
[35:47] burned bright and clear. Yes, Lord. We
[35:51] want more of you, Lord. Glory to
[35:55] the lamb
[35:57] of
[36:00] God
[36:02] and
[36:04] with
[36:05] [Music]
[36:12] your
[36:13] beautiful
[36:20] is all I see.
[36:25] Oh,
[36:28] your eyes
[36:30] are all
[36:32] [Music]
[36:33] for your
[36:36] [Music]
[36:42] Amen. Let's bow our heads and hearts.
[36:49] Thank you Lord.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord for each life
[36:55] &gt;&gt; bowed here in surrender to you today.
[36:58] Father,
[37:00] Father, my hear my ears hear victory in
[37:03] their voices. Father,
[37:05] &gt;&gt; I hear joy. I hear peace. Father, I hear
[37:08] thanksgiving.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; What an atmosphere already here today,
[37:12] Lord.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for your presence.
[37:16] Thank you, Lord, for this opportunity,
[37:17] Father, to tell you how much we love
[37:19] you.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; To join one in accord, Father,
[37:25] &gt;&gt; under your word for this day, Father,
[37:27] this overcoming word, Father. Lord,
[37:30] Father, we ask that you forgive us in
[37:32] our shortcomings this week, Father.
[37:34] Opportunities that presented themselves,
[37:36] Lord, and we failed to apply your word.
[37:39] Forgive me, Lord.
[37:41] We just desire, Father, to walk in the
[37:44] word, Father, for this day, Father, to
[37:46] shine it so bright, Lord. We can't do it
[37:48] ourselves, Father. Lord, and we just
[37:50] stumble and fall constantly, Lord, but
[37:53] thou knowest our heart love. We love
[37:56] you, Father. We love this word, this
[37:57] perfect word, Father. We love your body,
[38:00] Lord.
[38:02] Thank you for this service, Lord. one
[38:03] more moment, Father, that we can hold in
[38:05] our hands, Father, to show you and tell
[38:07] you how much we love you, to sit at your
[38:09] feet, Father, and to be circumcised once
[38:11] again by your word, Father. Lord, over
[38:13] and over again until, Father, there's
[38:15] none of this flesh left, Father. That
[38:17] the revelation, Father, won't be able to
[38:19] be contained in these mortal bodies,
[38:20] Father, that we'll just walk home.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Father, there's nothing more that I want
[38:27] &gt;&gt; out of this life, Father,
[38:29] &gt;&gt; than to see your word made manifest,
[38:31] Father.
[38:32] I love you, Father.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; The battle's raging, Lord.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; And we just hide and stand in your word.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; And time and time again, Lord,
[38:42] &gt;&gt; you come on the scene and you make it
[38:44] manifest.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; And we stand with a testimony.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[38:49] &gt;&gt; that you're real.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; You're in the earth that's bride form.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, for each life.
[38:55] Father, help us, Lord. I pray
[38:58] &gt;&gt; as the word comes forth, Father, may it
[39:01] find a resting place in our hearts,
[39:02] Lord. May it not just be church service,
[39:05] Lord, but understanding. We're being
[39:06] changed,
[39:08] &gt;&gt; but the renewing of our mind. Wash us
[39:10] Aresh, Lord. We bring our tithes and
[39:13] offerings, Lord. Thank you, Father, for
[39:15] what you've given.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; And we freely give it back, Father, with
[39:18] thanksgiving in our hearts, knowing that
[39:21] it will serve your purpose. In Jesus
[39:22] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.

[39:38] redeemed.

[42:00] praisees back to you. You're the father
[42:05] of creation.
[42:07] You're the Lamb of God,

[43:14] [Music]
[43:23] Heat. Heat.
[43:26] [Music]
[43:36] and
[43:43] God bless you this morning. Welcome to
[43:45] the house of the Lord. Each and everyone
[43:48] an honor and a privilege to gather
[43:50] together with you in the name of the
[43:51] Lord Jesus Christ.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning, we just
[43:55] want to bring it before the throne. We
[43:57] have a couple of requests that we want
[44:01] to remember as well as an assembly.
[44:04] First one is for Mr. Johnson Chick.
[44:07] Apparently that is a a client of Sister
[44:10] Stella and uh
[44:14] it's a a real struggle. The doctor has
[44:17] given him a date to live and told his
[44:21] wife to go and pray since his wife
[44:24] believes in prayer.
[44:26] And uh so we just want to stand with his
[44:30] wife
[44:31] &gt;&gt; and sister Stella in prayer for Mr.
[44:34] Johnson Chick as well. It uh it kind of
[44:40] I guess it was shared this week on
[44:43] Friday that uh Sister Anderson passed
[44:45] away. Sister Anderson is uh Charles,
[44:49] brother Charles Anderson's wife and that
[44:52] is brother Cadre Dick's pastor in
[44:55] Columbia, South Carolina.
[44:58] So we just want to stand with Charles
[45:01] family and or sorry the Anderson family
[45:04] and the and the assembly there. It
[45:07] certainly is a a tumultuous time
[45:11] for a family losing a loved one. So,
[45:14] let's just go to him in prayer this
[45:15] morning. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we
[45:18] thank you that we can gather together
[45:20] this way. Lord Jesus, we know that the
[45:23] days are numbered, that we're going to
[45:25] be able to do this. And we thank you for
[45:28] this opportunity, Lord. We don't take it
[45:30] lightly. This is not religion. This is
[45:32] not something that we just do, not
[45:34] something that we try and mix with
[45:36] anything else, Father. This is us
[45:39] stripping ourselves of all of our own
[45:41] thinking, Lord Jesus, and coming into
[45:43] that place, Lord Jesus, beyond the veil.
[45:47] Father, we thank you for the opportunity
[45:49] that we can do that, Lord. And this
[45:51] morning, Lord, we just remember each and
[45:53] every request that was made known unto
[45:55] you by the way of an uplift hand. We
[45:57] hold those requests before your throne
[45:59] this morning, Lord, knowing that you
[46:01] hear them and knowing that you're more
[46:03] than able to meet each and every one,
[46:05] Father, sovereignly according to your
[46:07] will, which is your word. And Father,
[46:11] this morning, we just want to stand with
[46:12] the Anderson family and the
[46:14] congregation.
[46:16] Lord, knowing that they've lost a saint,
[46:19] lost a husband or a wife and a and a
[46:22] mother, Lord Jesus, maybe a grandmother
[46:26] and an aunt. We know that there's many,
[46:29] many lives that have been affected by
[46:31] this passing, Lord. And we just want to
[46:34] stand with each one, Father. We know
[46:36] that you know best, Lord, in every
[46:38] situation. And we just want to ask,
[46:40] Father, that you would strengthen and
[46:42] comfort each and every one affected by
[46:45] this passing.
[46:46] Lord Jesus, we just want to stand with
[46:49] Mr. Johnson Chick and his wife, Lord, in
[46:52] prayer this morning that you would
[46:54] sovereignly meet the need in their life,
[46:56] Lord.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Mr. Johnson needs a touch from you,
[47:00] Father. And we know that you're more
[47:01] than able. And Father, we know that it
[47:03] doesn't matter what anyone else says or
[47:05] thinks. Your word says that by your
[47:08] stripes we are healed.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; And that we were healed. It says it both
[47:13] ways. And we thank you, Father, that
[47:15] you've covered it in all directions. And
[47:18] Lord Jesus, we pray that they could just
[47:19] accept it the way that you've given it.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Father, this morning now, as we commit
[47:25] these needs into your hands, Father, and
[47:27] we change the order of the service, we
[47:29] just invite you, Father, to have the
[47:30] preeminence in this service. Lord, it's
[47:33] a bit cloudy outside and dismal as the
[47:37] seasons change, Father. But Lord, we
[47:39] just know that just beyond this cover of
[47:43] clouds, Lord, the sun is shining,
[47:46] &gt;&gt; eternal, bright, and fair. And Lord
[47:48] Jesus, not even so much in the natural,
[47:50] but truly in the spiritual, Lord Jesus.
[47:53] This is truly the rising of the sun. And
[47:57] Father, we're so thankful for that
[47:58] dynamic power. We just invite you, Lord,
[48:01] now to have the preeminence in all that
[48:03] we say and do in this service. And at
[48:06] the end, we'll be careful to give you
[48:07] praise.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you. We just
[48:11] commit each need and each life into your
[48:13] hands now for your glory. In Jesus
[48:15] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, musicians. Once again,
[48:22] if you have your Bibles, I'd like to
[48:23] read from Revelations chapter 3.
[48:30] Revelations chapter 3.
[48:40] We're certainly thankful to have the
[48:43] youth event this afternoon. We're going
[48:45] to host it at our house. We'll be having
[48:47] lunch and uh a bit of a bit of a
[48:51] conversation about the word and just
[48:54] some fellowship. Remember the communion
[48:57] service on the 26th at 5:30
[49:00] and uh the youth service here in the
[49:04] sanctuary at the church on the 31st and
[49:07] that will be at 7:30 as well. And we
[49:10] also have brother Cadre Digs coming
[49:12] Saturday on the 22nd of November and
[49:15] Sunday the 23rd at 10 a.m. And the
[49:18] Saturday service will be at 6 PM.
[49:21] Revelations chapter 3
[49:25] verse 20.
[49:27] Actually, we'll read verse 19.
[49:32] As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen.
[49:36] Be zealous, therefore, and repent.
[49:40] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[49:44] If any man hear my voice and open the
[49:46] door, I will come into him, and will s
[49:50] with him, and he with me.
[49:52] To him that overcomemeth will I grant to
[49:55] sit with me in my throne,
[49:58] even as I also overcame,
[50:01] and am set down with my father in his
[50:04] throne.
[50:06] He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[50:09] the spirit saith unto the churches.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; May God add a blessing to the reading of
[50:14] his word. You may be seated today.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Just like to start the service today
[50:23] with a little reminder and a thank you
[50:26] all at the same time.
[50:31] We have uh a few questions that have
[50:34] come in. I mentioned it probably earlier
[50:37] in the summer, maybe even in the spring.
[50:38] I can't remember when I first mentioned
[50:40] it, but uh questions, if you have
[50:42] questions, please by all means write
[50:45] them down and submit them into the
[50:49] deacons or into the offering. If you
[50:52] just want to remain anonymous, that's
[50:54] fine. Um but if you if you write down
[50:56] questions, then we can actually find
[50:59] answers. And uh brother Brandham talks
[51:01] about how it's actually an opportunity
[51:03] to understand what's in the heart of the
[51:05] believers.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; If we have questions, there has to be
[51:09] answers. And I trust that the questions
[51:11] would be spiritual questions where there
[51:13] would actually be spiritual answers.
[51:14] There's natural questions and we can
[51:17] come up with all kinds of different
[51:18] natural answers because we have many
[51:21] varying opinions on natural
[51:23] circumstances. But uh sometimes there's
[51:26] natural questions and that's just fine.
[51:27] There's nothing wrong with that. But we
[51:29] uh we are certainly interested in the
[51:31] spiritual questions. If you have any, by
[51:33] all means. Um any questions, just write
[51:37] them down. We have a few and I want to
[51:39] just remind everyone that we have them.
[51:41] We haven't forgotten about them. I think
[51:43] I have a total of five of them right
[51:45] now. And I believe that, you know, if I
[51:47] took a service and started to talk about
[51:49] them, I would probably be able to, you
[51:51] know, deal with all four of them in the
[51:53] first 10 or 15 minutes and not have
[51:56] enough time for maybe the fifth one. So,
[51:58] I just want to try and get a whole bunch
[52:00] together and we'll do uh we'll do some
[52:02] some real good uh discussions about it.
[52:06] You know, uh just a reminder about this
[52:09] youth service coming up for anyone
[52:11] that's interested. It's all about the
[52:13] youth and uh anyone that wants to come,
[52:15] you're certainly welcome to come, but
[52:17] it's not going to be uh an opportunity
[52:20] for inputting and and seeing if we can
[52:23] help with how we're going to do it.
[52:24] We're going to do it in a very specific
[52:26] way. And I uh I reserve the right to
[52:30] actually be sort of leading the way this
[52:31] is going. And I think that it's actually
[52:34] a tremendous opportunity for the youth.
[52:36] But the question was raised just now. Is
[52:39] it for everyone? And it certainly is.
[52:41] Anybody that wants to come, Halloween
[52:42] night is just the the night for the
[52:45] devil. It's a celebration of the evil in
[52:47] this world. And if you don't want to
[52:49] actually be a part of that or look at
[52:50] that, maybe if you don't have something
[52:52] else to do, come to church. You're
[52:54] certainly welcome to
[52:56] &gt;&gt; you. We did uh last time we had uh we
[52:59] had probably three or four or five
[53:02] adults in the back.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; If there's more, forgive me. I was
[53:05] probably one of the juveniles. I'll say
[53:07] it that way. But we had the stage was
[53:09] full of the youth and uh we just played.
[53:12] There was no practice. There was no
[53:15] studying. There was no doing anything to
[53:17] try and and perform. It was simply who
[53:20] can play the piano, who can play the
[53:22] guitar, who can play the organ. And
[53:24] everyone volunteered, came up and we
[53:26] said, "Okay, let's sing this song." And
[53:28] guess what we did? We actually sang that
[53:30] song. And for those people that were
[53:32] here, you know full well the presence of
[53:34] the Lord came into the building with
[53:35] that worship. And it wasn't perfect by
[53:39] any means, but that's exactly what we're
[53:41] after because it's not perfection as we
[53:44] would think that actually brings the
[53:46] spirit of the Lord. It's surrender that
[53:48] actually does it. So, speaking to the
[53:49] youth service specifically, if anybody
[53:51] wants to come, you're certainly more
[53:52] than welcome to come. And if you do
[53:54] come, you're welcome to come and
[53:55] worship. And that's what's going to
[53:56] happen. We'll have uh a little bit of an
[53:58] exhortation as well as some songs. And
[54:01] uh maybe we'll have a little treat
[54:03] afterwards. We had a a little treat late
[54:05] after the last one. It was really good
[54:07] in the basement there. So, are you happy
[54:09] this morning? Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; I'm uh certainly interested in the
[54:15] service today because I feel uh I feel
[54:18] like we can't go on feelings. It's
[54:20] really bizarre. Anybody have a hard week
[54:22] this week?
[54:25] It it it was it was not an easy week.
[54:28] And and you know, I can see hands going
[54:30] up and people nodding. Is that Brother
[54:32] Wilner? Brother, God bless you.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Wilner. Welcome.
[54:39] Amen.
[54:43] I thank the Lord. You know, I had such a
[54:46] strong feeling about Brother Wilner this
[54:48] morning in prayer and here he is.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's wonderful. God bless
[54:54] you, brother. That's tremendous.
[54:57] My I just had uh a hard week as well.
[55:00] And uh we're certainly certainly
[55:02] cognizant of uh conscious of the
[55:05] struggle and the battle. And you know,
[55:07] it's not necessarily just one person
[55:09] that goes through it. When one goes
[55:10] through it, we all go through it. And I
[55:12] know that when the devil's coming around
[55:14] hard against me, he's coming after the
[55:16] sheep as well. And it's it's a difficult
[55:18] thing. But we're certainly thankful that
[55:20] we can get together in the name of the
[55:22] Lord Jesus Christ and know that he is
[55:24] here in our midst. I mean, where else
[55:26] would we rather be?
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; In the presence of the king. My my my.
[55:32] This morning, I want to I want to talk
[55:34] about overcoming.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; And uh I just I guess I'm going to blend
[55:41] sort of the youth uh event today maybe
[55:44] and uh we'll just carry on a little bit
[55:46] with it at home when we when we meet
[55:48] afterwards. But I want to talk about
[55:49] overcoming and what it means to
[55:51] overcome. And you know, sometimes we can
[55:53] think about overcoming and we think
[55:55] about all of the struggles that we have
[55:56] in our lives and and the individual
[55:59] affairs that we have to go through. And
[56:01] you know, as we struggle and fight, we
[56:04] have to overcome them. And sometimes we
[56:06] don't actually overcome them, but what
[56:08] we do is go into another day. We go to
[56:11] sleep and and the problems seem to fade
[56:13] away and we go into a dream and we wake
[56:15] up in the morning and and we just feel
[56:17] better.
[56:18] The problems of yesterday were yesterday
[56:20] and now we have a brand new day. We have
[56:22] an opportunity to go forwards with a a
[56:24] clear mind and and maybe just an
[56:27] opportunity to look at things a little
[56:28] bit differently. Sometimes just a little
[56:30] bit of sleep goes a long long ways.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; But you know the greatest battleground
[56:35] is where? It's right here, right? It's
[56:38] right there. It's in the mind. That's
[56:40] the greatest battleground because what
[56:42] we do in our lives is we just make
[56:44] decisions. That's what we do in our
[56:46] lives. We're decision makers.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; From the moment that we wake up to the
[56:50] moment that we go to sleep, we are
[56:52] making decisions. And when we go to
[56:54] sleep, we're no longer making decisions.
[56:56] And don't get nervous. I'm not trying to
[56:57] get psychological. I'm not at all doing
[56:59] that. But what I am saying is that we
[57:01] are free moral agents.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; And he's created us to be that way, to
[57:06] be decision makers. We he we are created
[57:09] in his image to be the actual God of
[57:11] this earth.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; He's the God of the universe. But he
[57:15] placed man on earth in his very image to
[57:18] be able to till the soil to to to look
[57:21] after the garden. But we know through
[57:23] the fall we find ourselves in this
[57:25] circumstance and situation that we're
[57:27] living in where we have all of the
[57:29] struggles, all of the trials, all of the
[57:31] humanity that we have to somehow try and
[57:34] get over. And it's not always easy. But
[57:36] I think that we have uh just a real
[57:39] interesting key here. And I really
[57:41] strongly felt led to go this way today.
[57:43] So, I'm just trusting the Lord with it.
[57:46] And and that is that we have an
[57:47] opportunity to overcome, but it might it
[57:50] just might not be exactly as we suppose.
[57:53] It might not be about overcoming smoking
[57:56] and about overcoming drinking. I I I
[57:59] just want to start with saying that it's
[58:01] really truly, I believe, overcoming
[58:03] ourselves.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; It's about being able to lay down our
[58:07] will.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. and say, "Be it unto me according
[58:10] to thy word
[58:11] &gt;&gt; which is your will."
[58:14] &gt;&gt; But out of out of the church age book to
[58:18] our scripture today that we read out of
[58:20] our church age book, the church age
[58:22] book, the exposition of the seven church
[58:23] ages, the overcomer's throne out of the
[58:27] Leodysian
[58:28] church, and that is what brother Brham
[58:31] talked about in Revelations 3:21. To him
[58:34] that overcomemeth
[58:36] will I grant to sit with me in my
[58:38] throne.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Even as I also overcame. How did he
[58:43] overcome?
[58:45] &gt;&gt; It was all the way to death.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; But it never would have happened if he
[58:48] would have fought it in the garden of
[58:50] Gethsemane. Would it? That's where the
[58:52] victory truly was won. When he laid down
[58:55] his will, his self-will to the will of
[58:58] the father. When he laid that down, the
[59:01] victory was won. The rest of it was all
[59:03] it just needed to take place. Now I am
[59:06] no
[59:07] way demeaning, belittling what Jesus
[59:11] went through from that point at all
[59:14] because I don't think any other human
[59:15] could actually do what he did. There's
[59:18] no way. But it wouldn't have happened if
[59:21] he didn't lay down his will.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Even as I also overcame and I'm sat down
[59:27] with my father in his throne.
[59:30] Now, this is what I want to get into. I
[59:32] remember brother Ken preaching on this
[59:33] and it just it just really struck me. As
[59:35] I said before this week, I'm just
[59:37] getting a little bit uh I don't know,
[59:40] melancholy. I guess this time of year
[59:42] just does that to me. But here here,
[59:45] brother Bradom, he says, "Now, what are
[59:47] we to overcome?"
[59:50] That is the normal question to ask here.
[59:53] But that is not the actual thought of
[59:55] this verse.
[59:58] For it is not so much what we are to
[1:00:01] overcome, but how we are to overcome.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; And so this is really where I'm going to
[1:00:08] go with the youth this afternoon and and
[1:00:10] with the youth right here now. All of us
[1:00:12] being youth because we're his children,
[1:00:14] right?
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; I want to talk about this because it's
[1:00:17] not all about what we overcome. Many
[1:00:20] times we'll say, "Oh, I had this and I
[1:00:22] had that and I've got this and I've got
[1:00:23] that and and all these other things to
[1:00:25] overcome." It's got nothing to do with
[1:00:27] it. What has to do with is how we do it.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes we even said it on
[1:00:34] Wednesday. How many people have ever
[1:00:35] been sick and not been healed? There was
[1:00:37] hands that went up. People believe that
[1:00:40] they haven't been healed. But I want to
[1:00:42] say maybe you have been, but maybe just
[1:00:44] not in a way that you think.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; And this is the critical factor here.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Even Paul had a discussion about this.
[1:00:52] We're going to get into it, but we're
[1:00:53] just going to keep keep going with this
[1:00:54] quote here. He says it's not so much
[1:00:57] what we are to overcome but how we are
[1:01:00] to overcome.
[1:01:02] Now this is logical for it does not
[1:01:06] matter ho matter much what we are to
[1:01:09] overcome as long as we know how we can
[1:01:12] overcome.
[1:01:14] It's such a critical thing to know that
[1:01:17] we have been given the ability to
[1:01:19] overcome in this age. There's a group of
[1:01:21] people that have been given the ability
[1:01:23] to overcome in every single age. There's
[1:01:26] a group of people that have been given
[1:01:28] the ability to overcome. Because at the
[1:01:30] end of every single ages exhortation in
[1:01:32] the book of Revelation, he says, "He
[1:01:35] that hath an ear, let him hear what the
[1:01:37] spirit saith unto the church. He that
[1:01:40] hath an ear," only those people that
[1:01:42] hath an ear will be able to overcome.
[1:01:45] But there's overcomers in every single
[1:01:47] age. And every single age he does give
[1:01:51] the correction for that age. If people
[1:01:53] have an ear, they will hear it. Carrying
[1:01:56] on in this quote, brother Brandham says,
[1:01:58] "A quick look at these scriptures which
[1:02:00] involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will
[1:02:04] bring out the truth of this
[1:02:06] proposition." In Matthew chapter 4,
[1:02:09] wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil,
[1:02:12] he overcame the personal temptations of
[1:02:15] Satan by the word.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; I love this. And by the word only.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; It's not by some kind of external
[1:02:25] psychological teaching or not some kind
[1:02:28] of external medical teaching. It's
[1:02:31] neither one of those things. It's only
[1:02:33] by the word.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, while we have some time
[1:02:37] still, I just need to make sure I can
[1:02:40] see the the time here. Boy, we got lots
[1:02:43] of time today.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Let's turn over to Matthew.
[1:02:48] Matthew chapter 4.
[1:02:56] Matthew chapter 4.
[1:03:08] Maybe we'll start with chapter 3.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 3,
[1:03:18] but verse 16.
[1:03:25] Boy, I just want to read it all. Let's
[1:03:27] go back to 14.
[1:03:30] Jesus going to John the baptizer.
[1:03:35] We know that John was actually the he
[1:03:38] was the uh messenger to the age. He was
[1:03:41] the prophet to the age.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; And we know that he was the Elijah
[1:03:46] anointing for that age.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And we know that he said in that age
[1:03:50] that I must decrease so that he can
[1:03:54] increase. The one that I'm not worthy to
[1:03:56] latch the shoes. The one that is
[1:03:58] standing amongst you now. He he
[1:04:00] identified him in many different ways,
[1:04:02] but he said that that when he comes on
[1:04:04] the scene, I I've got to decrease so
[1:04:07] that he can increase. And we know that
[1:04:09] same anointing hit this earth. And we
[1:04:11] know the same thing happened on this
[1:04:13] earth in a spiritual way, not in a
[1:04:15] natural way. Jesus has not walked on
[1:04:17] this earth again. We know that he won't
[1:04:19] touch his feet on this earth again until
[1:04:21] the actual uh Revelations chapter 19.
[1:04:25] I'm just going to throw this out there.
[1:04:26] I just I'm sorry, but if anybody has a
[1:04:29] cell phone, can you just check it and
[1:04:31] make sure that it's off?
[1:04:33] Just make sure our phones are off. I I
[1:04:35] don't believe that we should really need
[1:04:37] to say it, but sometimes we we notice
[1:04:40] that it happens. So, just check cell
[1:04:42] phones and make sure they're turned off.
[1:04:44] But here, John in verse 14, it says,
[1:04:47] "But John forbade him, saying, I have
[1:04:50] need to be baptized of thee, and comest
[1:04:52] thou to me?" You want you want you want
[1:04:55] to be baptized by me, but I need to be
[1:04:58] baptized by you." And Jesus answering
[1:05:01] said unto him, "Suffer it to be so now,
[1:05:03] for thus it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:05:06] righteousness."
[1:05:08] Then he suffered him. And he just needed
[1:05:09] to follow the scripture because of Acts
[1:05:13] 2:38.
[1:05:14] But they didn't actually understand that
[1:05:16] yet at that time. But Jesus being a
[1:05:19] fulfillment of the word, he needed to
[1:05:21] actually exemplify that.
[1:05:23] And verse 16 says, "And Jesus when he
[1:05:26] was baptized went up straightway out of
[1:05:27] the water, and lo, the heavens were open
[1:05:30] unto him, and he saw the spirit of God
[1:05:32] descending like a dove, and light
[1:05:34] lightning upon him. And lo, a voice from
[1:05:36] heaven, saying, "This is my beloved son
[1:05:38] in whom I am
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; well pleased."
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; What a tremendous scripture. And I
[1:05:46] believe that's the desire of every
[1:05:48] single son and daughter of God. verse 17
[1:05:50] is to hear him say that this is my
[1:05:54] beloved son. This is my beloved daughter
[1:05:56] in whom I am well pleased.
[1:06:00] Now, now chapter 4 is what I want to get
[1:06:03] to. But you know, chapter 4 wouldn't
[1:06:06] have happened unless there was this
[1:06:08] ending part of chapter 3.
[1:06:11] Jesus, a God in flesh. He was still a
[1:06:14] man. He was all man. Brother Bradam said
[1:06:16] that he was all man, but he was all God.
[1:06:19] How
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; how do you explain that? Some people
[1:06:20] just have it nailed down. They can
[1:06:22] scientifically describe it within the
[1:06:23] message of the hour. Exactly how he was
[1:06:26] all God and exactly how he is all man.
[1:06:28] And those are the guys that can explain
[1:06:29] the Godhead to infinity and beyond. So
[1:06:32] far that they will confuse themselves.
[1:06:34] But we have Jesus going and getting
[1:06:37] baptized according to the scripture.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus was a son that had to be obedient.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus couldn't do it without following
[1:06:46] the father's will. Amen.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful to think the King of
[1:06:51] Kings would come down and actually do it
[1:06:53] first himself?
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; That's why it's wonderful when you have
[1:06:57] a boss. Maybe like brother Paul,
[1:06:59] sometimes you can own a company and you
[1:07:02] get busy running the company and dealing
[1:07:04] with all of the aspects of the company.
[1:07:07] And many times you get staff that you
[1:07:09] hire to work in the company. and the
[1:07:11] staff that work in different positions
[1:07:13] in the company. I I I'll say this maybe
[1:07:15] beneath you, but not so much beneath
[1:07:17] you, but just upholding different parts
[1:07:20] of the business that you can't possibly
[1:07:22] manage yourself. You get people doing
[1:07:24] that. And sometimes those people can get
[1:07:26] a little bit of a a chip on their
[1:07:28] shoulder and and believe that they're
[1:07:30] the ones actually making the company and
[1:07:32] not realizing that the guy that started
[1:07:35] the company, he actually did that. Once
[1:07:37] upon a time, that's what he did. But
[1:07:40] every once in a while, we were having
[1:07:41] this conversation a little while ago. I
[1:07:43] hope it's okay, brother Paul. Every once
[1:07:44] in a while, it's really good for the
[1:07:45] boss to actually take the suit off and
[1:07:47] actually put on the gloves and go down
[1:07:49] and get right in the trenches and show
[1:07:52] everyone that he knows exactly what's
[1:07:54] going on.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; He knows what's happening. He knows how
[1:07:58] this happens. There's no surprises to
[1:08:00] him.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the rest of the staff can look
[1:08:04] around and say, "Wow, he he does know
[1:08:06] it." Okay. It it's it's it creates
[1:08:09] credibility amongst the people. But to
[1:08:11] think about it as a Christian, as a
[1:08:13] believer, to think that God himself
[1:08:15] would come down in flesh
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; and be tempted in all points, in all
[1:08:20] ways that we would be tempted
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; and then be able to lay down his will
[1:08:24] for us
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; for our deliverance.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful here. The the
[1:08:29] footnote of my Bible says the temptation
[1:08:31] of Jesus. First, he got the baptism of
[1:08:33] the Holy Ghost, right?
[1:08:35] It says that he did in the Bible, but in
[1:08:37] in chapter 4:1 says, "Then was Jesus led
[1:08:41] up of the spirit into the wilderness to
[1:08:45] be tempted of the devil."
[1:08:48] I think it's beautiful. It's just like
[1:08:49] Revelations chapter 4, isn't it? John,
[1:08:53] he was shown an open door in heaven
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; and immediately he was in the spirit.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Verse two. And when he had
[1:09:00] fasted 40 days and 40 nights, he was
[1:09:03] afterward and hungered. And And this is
[1:09:06] one that stumbles me. I I I I it doesn't
[1:09:09] stumble me that I don't believe it. It
[1:09:10] just stumbles me to think that I could
[1:09:12] ma barely make it for three days, two
[1:09:14] days without food. Some days even one
[1:09:16] day without food. But here Jesus was,
[1:09:19] how long did it say there? He fasted 40
[1:09:22] days and 40 nights.
[1:09:25] He was afterward hungry.
[1:09:28] He got his flesh to the weakest point
[1:09:30] that he probably could under his own
[1:09:32] will. 40 days and 40 nights. And I know
[1:09:35] there's a real significance with that.
[1:09:36] I'm not going to dig into that. There's
[1:09:38] brother brothers that could probably do
[1:09:39] a way better job than than me. But verse
[1:09:42] three, when the tempter came to him, he
[1:09:46] said, "If thou be the son of God,
[1:09:48] command that these stones be made
[1:09:49] bread." And we know that he was actually
[1:09:51] quoting scripture to Jesus. He wasn't
[1:09:54] just saying willy-nilly, I just want to
[1:09:56] tempt you. He was actually bringing the
[1:09:58] word to the word.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; But you're not going to fool the word.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Verse four says, "And he answered and
[1:10:07] said, it is written, man shall not live
[1:10:09] by bread alone, but by every word that
[1:10:13] proceedth out of the mouth of God."
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; I think it's just amazing how we we can
[1:10:20] look at this and see this was the the
[1:10:22] the lust of the flesh. absolutely
[1:10:25] desiring to eat something. His flesh was
[1:10:28] probably just about imploding. He was so
[1:10:31] hungry. Maybe he was so hungry, he was
[1:10:33] well beyond hungry. He didn't even have
[1:10:35] any hunger. But the Bible says he was
[1:10:37] hungry.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; He was really really hungry. And and
[1:10:40] here the devil comes around and tries to
[1:10:42] throw scripture at him and say, you
[1:10:44] know, you could you could just make
[1:10:45] these stones bread and kaboom, you would
[1:10:47] be able to eat. You would break this
[1:10:49] this fasting that you're doing, this
[1:10:50] fasting nonsense, and you'd actually
[1:10:52] have the food. you'd be satisfied in
[1:10:54] your flesh. Go for it. But he said, "No,
[1:10:57] no, no. The word says that you know
[1:10:59] what? Man shall not live by bread
[1:11:01] alone." And he wasn't here to live by
[1:11:03] bread alone, was he? He was here to live
[1:11:06] by every single word. And so is it with
[1:11:08] the believer today, brothers and
[1:11:09] sisters. We're here to live by every
[1:11:11] single word that that proceedth out of
[1:11:13] the mouth of God. And then the devil,
[1:11:16] verse 5, taketh him into an holy city,
[1:11:18] and setth him upon a on a pinnacle of
[1:11:21] the temple, and saith unto him, If thou
[1:11:25] be the son of God, cast thyself down.
[1:11:29] For it's written, he shall give his
[1:11:30] angels charge concerning thee, and in
[1:11:34] their hands they shall bear thee up,
[1:11:36] lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[1:11:39] against a stone. And we know this is
[1:11:40] Psalms 91:11.
[1:11:43] Jesus said unto him, "It is written
[1:11:46] again, thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[1:11:49] God." He didn't bring his own thoughts,
[1:11:53] even though they probably were his own
[1:11:55] thoughts because he was God. He brought
[1:11:57] the word. He didn't bring something new
[1:12:00] or different. He actually brought the
[1:12:02] word back to the word, back to this
[1:12:05] perversion of the word that the devil
[1:12:07] was bringing around to him.
[1:12:10] And we know that this this is the lust
[1:12:13] of the flesh. The first one, verse four,
[1:12:15] verse 7, is is dealing with the the lust
[1:12:18] of the eyes. And we know the next one is
[1:12:22] probably the the greatest and biggest
[1:12:24] one that every single one of us has to
[1:12:26] deal with. Verse 8 says again, "The
[1:12:28] devil taketh him up into an exceeding
[1:12:31] high mountain, and showeth him all the
[1:12:33] kingdoms of the world, and the glory of
[1:12:36] them, and saith unto him, all these
[1:12:39] things will I give thee, if thou wilt
[1:12:41] fall down, and worship me." And we know
[1:12:43] that right at that point, he was a
[1:12:44] scammer. That's what we would call a
[1:12:46] scammer today, isn't it? I'm going to
[1:12:48] give you something that I don't have.
[1:12:51] He He had no authority over it. We know
[1:12:54] that he was given it just for a time,
[1:12:56] but it was never his to begin with. And
[1:12:57] it was never his to remain.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; It was only that title deed book that
[1:13:03] was actually taken out of the hand of
[1:13:05] man and and given back to God. But it
[1:13:07] was never given to Satan.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; He never had claim to that title deed.
[1:13:12] But he wants it. He wants it bad
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; and he can never have it.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; But it's interesting because this is the
[1:13:19] the pride of life. this one here, seeing
[1:13:22] all of the kingdoms of the world, going
[1:13:24] to an exceeding high mountain and and
[1:13:27] showing him the kingdoms of the world
[1:13:29] and and declaring that he has the power
[1:13:31] and authority to give to him. And he
[1:13:34] knew full well that it had to be only by
[1:13:37] the blood, only by his life, only by his
[1:13:40] sacrifice. The lamb of God was the only
[1:13:43] way these kingdoms of the world were
[1:13:45] going to be restored.
[1:13:48] Then Jesus saith unto him, "Get thee,
[1:13:51] hence, Satan, for it's written, thou
[1:13:54] shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
[1:13:56] only shalt thou serve."
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; And I just love this because I think
[1:14:01] this is a a a direct comparison to the
[1:14:03] life of a believer. When we go through
[1:14:05] our temptations, we will go through
[1:14:07] temptations, but we will overcome.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; And the reason we'll overcome is because
[1:14:12] he's already overcome.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Jesus got baptized,
[1:14:16] because he went into the wilderness,
[1:14:17] because he fasted, because he had these
[1:14:19] temptations and overcame by the word. He
[1:14:22] gave us the example himself of how to
[1:14:25] overcome.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Verse 11 says, "Then the devil leaveth
[1:14:30] him." There comes a day, brothers and
[1:14:33] sisters, where the devil will leave us.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that the devil
[1:14:37] won't even know what to do with us. He
[1:14:39] said, "Sometimes the devil, he won't
[1:14:41] even be able to find you because you'll
[1:14:43] be so far hid in Christ."
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; I say that's where I want to live.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; I I just want to be in a place where he
[1:14:49] can't even find me.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; So hid in Christ, but I guess I'm I'm
[1:14:54] still not hidden enough.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; My But you know, I think it's getting
[1:14:59] it's getting better and better as we go.
[1:15:02] The word is is working mightily in me.
[1:15:06] Amen.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Is that our testimony today?
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; No matter what the circumstance
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; of what I feel
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; or see.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter, does it?
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; But it does matter. And I'll say it
[1:15:22] because we deal in this world. We're
[1:15:25] dealing with this world in our flesh.
[1:15:27] And many times we have circumstances and
[1:15:29] situations where we know the clock is
[1:15:31] ticking. And if something doesn't happen
[1:15:32] by a certain amount of time, Lord, do
[1:15:34] you want us to perish?
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; I'll say this, maybe he does just a
[1:15:41] little bit in his flesh.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Maybe he does just to get us to come
[1:15:46] right back to center again.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Because we know that in Revelation it
[1:15:50] said, "Those I love I rebuke and I
[1:15:52] chasen." How does that happen? Natural
[1:15:54] circumstances.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; He allows things to happen in our life
[1:15:57] so that we will look to him.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:02] But I love this quote here. I just
[1:16:04] wanted to make sure that we read this
[1:16:05] here and talk a little bit about it out
[1:16:06] of Matthew chapter 4. A quick look at
[1:16:09] these scriptures. Brother Brandham
[1:16:10] speaking in the Leodysian church age
[1:16:12] involve uh a quick look at these
[1:16:15] scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus
[1:16:17] overcoming will bring out the truth of
[1:16:19] this proposition
[1:16:21] in Matthew 4 where Jesus is tempted of
[1:16:24] the devil. He overcame the personal
[1:16:26] temptations of Satan by the word and by
[1:16:30] the word only.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; In each of the three major trials that
[1:16:35] correspond, I love this exactly to the
[1:16:39] temptation of the Garden of Eden, the
[1:16:41] lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye,
[1:16:44] and the pride of life. Jesus overcame by
[1:16:48] the word. Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Let's just turn over to re uh Genesis
[1:16:52] here. Being that we have all this time,
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[1:17:00] Thank you, whoever put the new clock in.
[1:17:03] We certainly appreciate all that
[1:17:05] everyone does for the body. It really
[1:17:07] makes a difference.
[1:17:11] Genesis
[1:17:13] Genesis chapter 2 actually no three.
[1:17:20] Genesis 2 talks about how God formed the
[1:17:23] the man of and and the woman and and
[1:17:27] gave Adam the woman
[1:17:30] and uh talks about the verse 24 of of
[1:17:33] chapter 2. Therefore shall a man leave
[1:17:35] his father and mother and shall cleave
[1:17:37] unto his wife and they shall be one
[1:17:39] flesh. We know this was the first
[1:17:41] wedding that took place ever. And it was
[1:17:44] ordained of God in the garden. And uh
[1:17:47] it's why the husband doesn't hold on to
[1:17:51] his parents, his mother, and and bring
[1:17:54] that relationship into the marriage. And
[1:17:56] the wife, she doesn't hold on to the
[1:17:58] relationship with her father and bring
[1:18:01] that into the marriage. It's just a man
[1:18:03] and a woman leaving their parents and
[1:18:05] coming together and becoming their own
[1:18:08] family, becoming one together. And and
[1:18:11] verse 25 says, "And they were both
[1:18:12] naked, man and his wife, and were not
[1:18:15] ashamed."
[1:18:17] It's it's a wonderful thing to know that
[1:18:19] that's the way it was in the garden.
[1:18:21] They were not ashamed. And uh
[1:18:26] we know that chapter 3 had to happen
[1:18:28] unfortunately, but it's it's the reason
[1:18:32] why we're here. We're we're we're we're
[1:18:34] in a situation where we can overcome.
[1:18:36] This isn't to destroy us. This is to
[1:18:38] give us overcoming power, a a
[1:18:41] recognition that we will actually
[1:18:43] overcome. And I think it's just amazing
[1:18:46] when we look at this how how how God
[1:18:49] does stuff,
[1:18:51] you know. When brother Brandham, he
[1:18:52] says, I just want to say this out of the
[1:18:53] quote that we read, in each of the three
[1:18:55] major trials corresponding exactly to
[1:18:57] the temptation in the garden of Eden,
[1:18:59] the lust of the flesh, lust of the eye,
[1:19:01] and pride of life, Jesus overcame by the
[1:19:04] word. Now, chapter 3 says, "Now the
[1:19:08] serpent was more subtle
[1:19:10] than any beast of the field which the
[1:19:13] Lord
[1:19:15] God had made." And that word subtle is
[1:19:18] is interesting.
[1:19:22] I uh
[1:19:24] boy
[1:19:26] now I I went and did it. I messed it up.
[1:19:30] I'll find it. But the serpent was more
[1:19:33] subtle than any beast of a field which
[1:19:34] the Lord God had made. And he said unto
[1:19:37] the woman, "Ya hath God said, Ye shall
[1:19:41] not eat of every tree of the garden." So
[1:19:48] car I'll just carry on. Verse two says,
[1:19:50] "And the woman said unto the serpent, we
[1:19:52] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[1:19:54] garden,
[1:19:56] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:19:58] the midst of the garden, God hath said,
[1:20:00] Ye shall not eat it, neither shall ye
[1:20:03] touch it, lest ye die."
[1:20:07] And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye
[1:20:10] shall not surely die.
[1:20:13] For God doth know that in the day ye eat
[1:20:15] thereof, then your eyes shall be open,
[1:20:19] and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
[1:20:21] and evil.
[1:20:23] And here's the temptation now
[1:20:26] manifesting in the woman. And when the
[1:20:28] woman saw that the tree was good for
[1:20:31] food, the lust of the flesh,
[1:20:35] pleasant to the eyes,
[1:20:38] the lust of the flesh,
[1:20:41] the lust
[1:20:43] of the eyes. Yep. It was pleasant to the
[1:20:46] eyes, and a tree to be desired to make
[1:20:49] one wise, the pride of life. She took of
[1:20:53] the fruit thereof, and did eat, and also
[1:20:56] gave unto her husband with her, and he
[1:20:59] did eat. You know, in this in this
[1:21:02] scripture here, it's it's very very
[1:21:06] condensed. And I'm so thankful that we
[1:21:09] have been given the ability to
[1:21:11] understand that we need to read between
[1:21:13] the lines and you know not read between
[1:21:15] the lines according to human knowledge
[1:21:17] and and human understanding and and and
[1:21:20] the consciousness of human awareness but
[1:21:23] to actually read by the spirit. It has
[1:21:26] got to be revelation by the spirit. And
[1:21:29] if we don't have revelation by the
[1:21:30] spirit, we're going to miss it. We're
[1:21:31] going to read this and we're going to
[1:21:32] have knowledge and say, "Yeah, the woman
[1:21:34] saw that it was it was good for food and
[1:21:36] and it was it was a piece of fruit and
[1:21:38] that's what they did." But, you know,
[1:21:40] she took of the fruit. What I want to
[1:21:42] get to, she took of the fruit thereof
[1:21:43] and did eat and gave also unto her
[1:21:45] husband with her and he did eat. It
[1:21:48] almost sounds like she just gave it to
[1:21:50] him and and he just took it and and ate
[1:21:52] it and and because she gave it to him,
[1:21:54] he just went along with it. But that's
[1:21:55] not at all what happened. We know that
[1:21:57] that sure naturally speaking we can say
[1:22:00] that's what happened but he was not
[1:22:02] forced to take that fruit. We'll say it
[1:22:04] that way. He was not forced to just
[1:22:06] participate in what happened. He
[1:22:08] willingly participated in what happened
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; just like a type of Jesus Christ coming
[1:22:13] down in the flesh getting baptized
[1:22:16] having the temptation and then fast
[1:22:18] forwarding going right to the garden of
[1:22:19] Gethsemane where he laid down his own
[1:22:21] will. Adam laid down his own will to
[1:22:24] step back from his first estate, to step
[1:22:26] out of eternity and step into time to
[1:22:29] save his bride who was actually a part
[1:22:31] of him.
[1:22:35] But he wasn't deceived. It was the woman
[1:22:36] that was deceived. Right?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; And we know that brother Brandham says
[1:22:40] the woman is a weaker vessel. And
[1:22:42] sometimes you can get people really
[1:22:44] uncomfortable with that. But that's the
[1:22:45] word of God. That's not something we're
[1:22:46] going to try and discern or or say
[1:22:48] anything against it or for it. It is
[1:22:51] what it is. It's it's just it's a
[1:22:54] spiritual thing. It's not a natural
[1:22:55] thing. Unfortunately, in this world that
[1:22:57] we live in, it's the world that we live
[1:22:58] in. There's some women that are stronger
[1:23:00] than men. Unfortunately,
[1:23:04] those men that don't eat foods right and
[1:23:06] try and act like women. Yeah, there's
[1:23:09] some women in this world that Anyways,
[1:23:13] I think it's interesting just to look at
[1:23:15] this here. We want to talk about
[1:23:18] overcoming than understanding that the
[1:23:20] only way we're going to overcome is to
[1:23:21] first be tempted.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Why would we have to overcome if we
[1:23:25] didn't have temptation in our lives?
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; There would have to be a perfect
[1:23:30] condition, I think, if we didn't have to
[1:23:32] overcome.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; But we're not in that condition yet.
[1:23:37] I just think it's beautiful when we can
[1:23:38] see the the the the corresponding
[1:23:41] scriptures according to the way brother
[1:23:42] Brandham said it. how it's exactly, he
[1:23:45] says, an exact representation, an exact
[1:23:48] type of what happened in the Garden of
[1:23:50] Eden, what Jesus went through in Matthew
[1:23:53] chapter 4. You know, the the lust of the
[1:23:56] f of the flesh trying to trying to
[1:24:00] trying to get Jesus to to jump for some
[1:24:03] food. What a what a amazing thing that
[1:24:05] is. I I think it's just a beautiful
[1:24:08] thing because we can see clearly through
[1:24:10] that that the devil did not believe that
[1:24:14] was the son of God.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; The devil did not believe that Jesus was
[1:24:17] the son of God. I know we've talked
[1:24:19] about this in the past. That's why they
[1:24:21] put Jesus on the cross. They killed him
[1:24:23] because the devil never believed it. If
[1:24:24] the devil believed that, they never
[1:24:26] would have done it
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; because that sealed his fate.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; And and he knows it and so do we. It's
[1:24:33] just so beautiful when we can see it
[1:24:34] that way. But to try and tempt the son
[1:24:36] of man with some food, boy, and and and
[1:24:40] the lust of the eyes, to think that he
[1:24:43] could just be be thrown down off the
[1:24:46] temple and and somehow the angels of God
[1:24:48] would just surround him and prevent him
[1:24:51] from from from stumbling and falling and
[1:24:53] hurting himself. And then the pride of
[1:24:56] life, we know that brother Brandham said
[1:24:57] that power without character is satanic.
[1:25:01] And that's really what that is. Now, in
[1:25:03] the life of a human being outside of
[1:25:05] Jesus, because we know that he had all
[1:25:07] the character,
[1:25:09] but he had to learn obedience through
[1:25:11] the things that he suffered just like
[1:25:13] every one of us. There's no way that
[1:25:15] we're going to go through this life and
[1:25:17] just be handed a victory. There's no way
[1:25:19] that we're just going to get that
[1:25:20] character. That character is a victory.
[1:25:24] That character isn't just a gift that
[1:25:25] we're going to just we're not just given
[1:25:27] that that character as a gift from our
[1:25:30] church. We're not given that character
[1:25:32] as a gift from our parents. We don't get
[1:25:34] it from a lineage. We don't get it from
[1:25:36] tenure. It only comes by the things
[1:25:39] which we suffer
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; only.
[1:25:44] And I I I I'm not saying it in a way
[1:25:46] today just so you know my heart as as a
[1:25:49] rebuke and as a punishment. I'm I'm
[1:25:50] saying it in such a way that we're all
[1:25:52] going to struggle. We're all going to
[1:25:55] fight. But it's important to recognize
[1:25:57] this is God's design. This is so that we
[1:26:00] can work us out of us and work him into
[1:26:04] us.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Because in Revelation, in Revelation 4,
[1:26:09] we're talking about the Leodysian church
[1:26:11] age. Maybe let's just go back and and
[1:26:13] read this here uh uh from Revelations
[1:26:16] 3:14.
[1:26:18] Let's look at the condition of this
[1:26:20] church age. All of us, whether we
[1:26:23] understand it or not, whether we believe
[1:26:24] it or not, whether we see it or not, are
[1:26:26] coming out of this church age. Some
[1:26:29] people have already moved into the bride
[1:26:31] age and they can just say amen to this.
[1:26:33] They understand it fully. But some
[1:26:35] people are still stuck in this church
[1:26:37] age. And there's believers that are in
[1:26:39] this church age that are the bride of
[1:26:41] Jesus Christ. Because when that last
[1:26:43] predestinated seed comes in, then the
[1:26:45] rapture will go.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; And that's what we're looking for today.
[1:26:49] But let's look at the condition of this
[1:26:50] church in all the church ages, the
[1:26:53] seventh one. And unto the angel of the
[1:26:56] church of the Leodysans, write these
[1:27:00] things, saith the amen, the faithful and
[1:27:02] true witness, the beginning of the
[1:27:04] creation of God. I know thy works.
[1:27:08] I know what you do. I know who you are.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; I know where you live.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; I know where you go to church.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; I know what you think. I know what you
[1:27:18] dream when your consciousness turns off.
[1:27:22] I know thy works.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. that thou art neither cold nor
[1:27:26] hot. I would thou weren't cold or hot.
[1:27:31] So then, because thou art lukewarm and
[1:27:33] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[1:27:35] out of my mouth.
[1:27:38] Why will he do it? Because they're
[1:27:41] neither cold or hot. They're just
[1:27:42] indifferent. You know, whatever. I could
[1:27:44] take it or leave it. I could go to
[1:27:45] church or not. I could stream or not. I
[1:27:47] could believe it the way I want to
[1:27:48] believe it. This is the age of people's
[1:27:50] rights. The Leodysian church age is
[1:27:52] people's rights. That's what it means.
[1:27:53] We read that in the exposition of the
[1:27:55] seven church ages. People can do
[1:27:56] whatever they want. But those people who
[1:27:58] are truly elected will only do the will
[1:28:00] of the father.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; And the will of the father is going to
[1:28:03] be exactly according to the word of God,
[1:28:05] which is exactly according to the
[1:28:06] messenger for that age.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Anything else is false.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; But he goes on to say in verse 17, and
[1:28:15] this is this is God, the spirit of God
[1:28:18] speaking to this age.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; This isn't just a man speaking. This
[1:28:22] isn't just John the Revelator just
[1:28:24] putting down his own thoughts. He's not
[1:28:27] just sitting on a on a beach in a beach
[1:28:29] chair with some smart water beside him
[1:28:32] having a scroll with his sunglasses on
[1:28:34] as some people might depict this. We
[1:28:37] know that he was on the aisle of Patmas
[1:28:39] for the testimony of Jesus Christ. Just
[1:28:40] before he went to this place where it
[1:28:42] was all of the criminals, he was boiled
[1:28:44] in oil for 24 hours. But I love what
[1:28:47] brother Brandham says. You can't boil
[1:28:48] the Holy Ghost out of nobody. just try
[1:28:51] it. And that's what they did with him.
[1:28:53] They tried to boil the Holy Ghost out of
[1:28:55] John. There was no doing it. Verse 16
[1:28:58] says, "So then, because thou art
[1:29:00] lukewarm and neither hot or cold, I will
[1:29:02] spew thee out of my mouth.
[1:29:04] Don't want nothing to do with you." Why?
[1:29:06] Because in verse 17, because thou
[1:29:08] sayest, I am rich. I'm increased with
[1:29:12] goods, and I have need of nothing.
[1:29:15] and knowest not that thou art wretched
[1:29:18] and miserable and poor and blind and
[1:29:21] naked.
[1:29:22] But you know, it's interesting because
[1:29:24] in this scripture here, we can read this
[1:29:26] scripture here and say, well, there's a
[1:29:28] lot of people I don't think that there's
[1:29:29] anybody in this world that would be
[1:29:31] really walking around in this world. Not
[1:29:33] many people, there's a few. I'm I'm
[1:29:35] catching myself as I'm saying this, but
[1:29:36] there's not a lot of people that are
[1:29:37] walking around poor and blind and naked
[1:29:39] in this world, are there? And we know
[1:29:41] that he's not talking about the people
[1:29:43] maybe who are misfortunate and standing
[1:29:46] on the roadside with a sign hoping that
[1:29:47] that someone will help them out. Maybe
[1:29:49] they don't have winter clothes. Maybe
[1:29:51] they are naked and poor and maybe they
[1:29:53] are blind. But those people are very few
[1:29:56] and far between. Who's he talking to?
[1:29:57] He's talking to the people that are
[1:29:59] wearing suits, that are wearing ties,
[1:30:01] that are wearing lovely, call them tight
[1:30:04] minikirts, going to churches with high
[1:30:06] heels and earrings, acting like
[1:30:08] everything is fine because their bank
[1:30:10] accounts are full. They've got the the
[1:30:12] investments, their jobs, their their
[1:30:15] pensions, everything is fine. Maybe
[1:30:17] they've got a great inheritance coming
[1:30:18] down the pipes. All of their life is
[1:30:20] wonderful.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; But he's not looking at that.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; He's looking at the inward person. He's
[1:30:26] looking at that soul and he's telling
[1:30:28] them, "Your soul fits this description."
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Your soul says, "I am rich and increased
[1:30:34] with goods. There's nothing that you
[1:30:36] could teach me in this message that I
[1:30:38] don't already know. I have need of
[1:30:41] nothing."
[1:30:43] What a terrible place to be. And know
[1:30:45] it's not. You don't even know that you
[1:30:49] Oh my. that you're wretched and
[1:30:51] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[1:30:53] in the sight of God. We know that all
[1:30:55] things are naked in the in the sight of
[1:30:56] God, right? There's nothing hidden
[1:30:58] before God. He can see our innermost
[1:31:00] being. He knows every single thought. We
[1:31:02] know that our thoughts, even right now
[1:31:04] as we're here together in church, are
[1:31:06] louder in heaven than than maybe my
[1:31:08] voice.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; But here's what he says in verse 18. I
[1:31:13] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:31:17] the fire that thou mayest be rich
[1:31:20] and white raignment
[1:31:22] that thou mayest be clothed
[1:31:25] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:31:27] not appear
[1:31:29] to think about it that he would actually
[1:31:31] give us raignnt he give us a robe and we
[1:31:35] know that in the book of revelation he
[1:31:36] talks about those people under the sixth
[1:31:38] seal you know excuse me the Jews that
[1:31:41] brother bam talked about those ones that
[1:31:43] were crying for retribution. How long,
[1:31:45] oh Lord, holy and true must we wait to
[1:31:48] see these people avenged? And he just
[1:31:51] gave him a white robe and said, "Just
[1:31:53] just relax. Take it easy. Just rest for
[1:31:54] a little season until your fellow
[1:31:56] brethren are killed just like you were."
[1:31:58] And we know that's 144,000 that have to
[1:32:01] be killed just like them. And that time
[1:32:03] is coming very soon. That time is
[1:32:05] approaching really, really fast.
[1:32:07] But to think that he would counsel those
[1:32:10] people.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; He would counsel those souls to buy of
[1:32:14] him gold. Not gold that we could find at
[1:32:16] a bank. Not the finest, purest gold that
[1:32:19] we could find on in some market
[1:32:22] somewhere in a world in in the world,
[1:32:24] somewhere that maybe you can't even find
[1:32:26] in North America. There's probably
[1:32:27] better gold somewhere in this world, but
[1:32:30] not even that we would find maybe in the
[1:32:31] universe on a on a comet going through
[1:32:33] space. There's no gold that we could
[1:32:36] buy. I think it's amazing how he says
[1:32:39] this to the church through this
[1:32:41] Leodysian church age messenger in the
[1:32:44] church age book. He says it very
[1:32:46] clearly. I counsel thee to buy of me
[1:32:49] gold tried in the fire.
[1:32:52] That gold is our character. And I I'll
[1:32:55] go so far as to say this. That gold
[1:32:57] isn't our character. It's his character.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. His character that gets smelted
[1:33:02] out of us that gets burned right out of
[1:33:05] us. Our character gets burnt out and his
[1:33:07] character comes to the surface.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Our character is dross on the top. Isn't
[1:33:13] that amazing to think about? We have got
[1:33:15] to see ourselves burnt up completely.
[1:33:21] I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[1:33:23] in the fire
[1:33:25] that thou mayest be rich and white
[1:33:28] raignnt that thou mayest be clothed
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:33:34] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:33:35] Isav that thou mayest see.
[1:33:39] As many as I love I rebuke and I chasen.
[1:33:42] Be zealous therefore and repent. Amen.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; We know that Paul, the church age
[1:33:48] messenger, he did that.
[1:33:51] He was zealous
[1:33:53] for the Lord and he repented every
[1:33:55] single day. He said, "I die to myself
[1:33:57] daily. Now follow me as I follow
[1:34:00] Christ." That's what he said. And that's
[1:34:02] all we need to do is die out to
[1:34:04] ourselves. We got to be willing to die
[1:34:05] out to ourselves.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; So I think today it's wonderful as we
[1:34:09] talk about this. If we want to overcome,
[1:34:11] if we've got one speck of pride in our
[1:34:13] life, we're not overcoming.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing to say it, but
[1:34:19] it's true.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; We've got to be willing to humble
[1:34:22] ourselves in the sight of the Lord if we
[1:34:24] want to be lifted up.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; But you know, pride, pride of life is
[1:34:29] the the first and original sin, isn't
[1:34:31] it? That's what the devil wanted. That's
[1:34:33] what Lucifer was looking to make himself
[1:34:36] just like the most high. He was going to
[1:34:38] exalt himself to there. And I I think
[1:34:41] it's so beautiful when we look at this
[1:34:42] because he wants our position. That's
[1:34:45] exactly where we are to go to, brothers
[1:34:48] and sisters, the position that the devil
[1:34:50] wants. And he can never have that. But
[1:34:52] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:34:54] sit with me in my throne. We're not
[1:34:56] going to sit with him necessarily in a
[1:34:58] chair. It's not the great white chair
[1:35:01] that we're necessarily going to go and
[1:35:02] sit. Maybe we are. Maybe someone could
[1:35:04] correct me on that. But I believe it
[1:35:06] this way. And and I think it's important
[1:35:08] to say it that we're going to have the
[1:35:10] authority of his throne.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; We're going to be judging angels.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; So whether we're sitting with him in a
[1:35:16] chair or standing beside it or sitting
[1:35:18] in our own chairs is irrelevant. The
[1:35:20] fact of the matter is we're going to
[1:35:22] reign with him in his power and
[1:35:25] authority.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Satan wants that position worse than
[1:35:29] anything. And he can never have it. And
[1:35:32] because of that, he persecutes the bride
[1:35:35] in the day in which we live. That's
[1:35:37] where we are.
[1:35:40] Brother Brandham in in our quotes here,
[1:35:42] he goes on to say a little further. Eve
[1:35:45] fell to the personal temptation of
[1:35:47] Satan.
[1:35:50] How
[1:35:52] he doesn't have it up yet. I'll just
[1:35:53] pause here. Eve fell to the personal
[1:35:57] temptation of Satan by failing to use
[1:36:01] the word
[1:36:04] That's how she fell
[1:36:07] simply by failing to use the word. Now I
[1:36:10] think this is really good because how
[1:36:11] how did that happen? She got out of her
[1:36:14] husband and she got away from her
[1:36:17] husband and she began to make decisions
[1:36:20] on her own without first consulting her
[1:36:23] husband. But had she stood behind her
[1:36:26] husband and actually it could have
[1:36:28] simply been behind her husband's word
[1:36:31] because she knew what her husband was
[1:36:34] told by God.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; I've often wondered if she couldn't hear
[1:36:37] it while she was still yet a part of him
[1:36:40] because they weren't separated and God
[1:36:43] came and told them you can eat of every
[1:36:44] tree in the garden. They were still one
[1:36:46] created in the image of God. Both male
[1:36:48] and female created he them. They were
[1:36:52] one and God told them, "You can eat of
[1:36:54] any tree in the garden, but leave that
[1:36:55] one tree alone." So, she got out from
[1:36:58] behind her husband's word. She got out
[1:37:01] from behind her husband's leadership,
[1:37:03] and she fell to the temptation of Satan.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; She was deceived.
[1:37:08] And you know, I just think it's real
[1:37:09] easy for us as the church, if we get out
[1:37:12] from the leadership of our husband.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; If we do that, we're going to be
[1:37:17] deceived.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes,
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; we're going to be deceived. We're going
[1:37:21] to come into a place where God will be
[1:37:24] able to mold us and shape us if we're
[1:37:25] truly his elected sons and daughters of
[1:37:27] God. And unfortunately, we've heard it
[1:37:29] said this way. It's like going through
[1:37:31] the knot hole in the fence sideways.
[1:37:34] It's unfortunate, but sometimes we need
[1:37:36] that. Eve, she fell to the personal
[1:37:40] temptation of Satan by failing to use
[1:37:42] the word. Adam fell in direct
[1:37:47] disobedience to the word. This is what
[1:37:50] the prophet is saying. I think it's just
[1:37:52] amazing when we can look at this because
[1:37:54] sometimes we can confuse these two. We
[1:37:57] can we can confuse whether we have
[1:37:59] direct disobedience to the word or
[1:38:01] whether we're deceived by the word.
[1:38:03] Sometimes we just don't know. And that's
[1:38:06] why we need to study the word. That's
[1:38:07] why we need to have revelation by the
[1:38:10] spirit
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; because even sometimes as an elder we
[1:38:14] can say we've heard something a 100,000
[1:38:16] times before but something struck me
[1:38:18] today and somehow it just resonated and
[1:38:21] it did something for me.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; But there's a big difference between
[1:38:28] falling in direct disobedience to the
[1:38:30] word of God.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:33] than being deceived and not knowing the
[1:38:35] word of God. And this is where the
[1:38:38] devil's playground is. I believe these
[1:38:40] two two two little sentences here. Eve
[1:38:43] fell by the personal temptation of Satan
[1:38:46] by failing to use the word. Adam fell
[1:38:48] into direct disobedience to the word. He
[1:38:53] actually chose to step out from his
[1:38:55] first estate and save his bride. Now I
[1:38:59] want to say today one of the questions
[1:39:01] that we have been asked is uh uh very
[1:39:04] similar to these lines and and I'm not
[1:39:07] going to preach on it today but I'm
[1:39:08] going to really answer it probably just
[1:39:11] this quickly. If you truly are a son and
[1:39:13] daughter of God, if we truly are sons
[1:39:16] and daughters of God, we will not
[1:39:18] directly disobey God.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Now what is disobedience? I'm going to
[1:39:23] say it's unbelief
[1:39:25] because that's truly what it is. There's
[1:39:27] many attributes to it, but the main
[1:39:29] thing is unbelief is saying that I don't
[1:39:32] believe in the word of God. I don't
[1:39:33] believe in the prophet. I can take the
[1:39:34] entire message except for that one
[1:39:36] thing. That one thing is actually going
[1:39:38] to stop. All of the power of the message
[1:39:42] that we would have with the message will
[1:39:44] stop on that one thing. We've got to be
[1:39:46] willing to unreservedly accept it all.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; But you know what people do generally in
[1:39:51] the day in which we live? They'll say,
[1:39:52] "My, that guy was so good. But he had
[1:39:54] such a tremendous ministry, but he was
[1:39:57] really hard on women. He was a woman
[1:40:00] hater.
[1:40:01] Yeah. He wasn't a woman hater. He just
[1:40:04] stuck to the word of God.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; But the whole entire world has shifted
[1:40:08] and said, "Well, it's okay. Everyone's
[1:40:10] doing it. We can do this and get away
[1:40:12] with it. Sure enough, you can for a
[1:40:15] time." But boy, when the trial time
[1:40:18] comes, it's going to be important to
[1:40:20] know exactly where we stand.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we're truly sons and
[1:40:24] daughters of God, then he will rebuke
[1:40:25] and chasen us if we're not getting any
[1:40:29] trials in our life. I wonder, are we
[1:40:31] even sons and daughters of God?
[1:40:34] But because Eve felt a personal
[1:40:36] temptation of Satan by failing to use
[1:40:39] the word, that doesn't mean that she was
[1:40:43] lost because Adam stepped out directly
[1:40:46] from his first estate to save her. And I
[1:40:48] want to say this. When we feel like
[1:40:51] we've fallen, when we observe that we've
[1:40:54] fallen, when we see that we've fallen,
[1:40:58] we haven't necessarily stepped away from
[1:41:00] believing the word of God. We've had
[1:41:02] temptation in our life. And that
[1:41:04] temptation has caused us to fall. And
[1:41:06] what we do is we get back up and we
[1:41:08] repent for our fall. We repent for our
[1:41:10] our sinful nature. We repent for the
[1:41:13] thing that we've encountered in our
[1:41:15] life.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:18] And that's what happened in the Garden
[1:41:20] of Eden. But Eve didn't even realize she
[1:41:23] was deceived. And immediately when she
[1:41:25] recognized what was going on, then it
[1:41:27] became fingerpointing, right? Well, it
[1:41:29] was the serpent that you gave us. And
[1:41:30] and and then and then Adam, well, it was
[1:41:32] the woman that you gave me. And we know
[1:41:34] how it all went down. But I just think
[1:41:37] it's really important for us to
[1:41:38] recognize that our Adam, Jesus Christ,
[1:41:40] that came down and actually got the Holy
[1:41:42] Ghost. He was born and in sin. He wasn't
[1:41:45] born in sin. He was born in this world.
[1:41:48] We were born in sin. We bypassed our
[1:41:50] theophony. And he didn't. He came in a
[1:41:54] position where he actually laid down his
[1:41:56] life just like Adam. And and he didn't
[1:42:00] fall, but he chose to lay his life down
[1:42:02] directly so that he could actually save
[1:42:04] us as his wife, just like Eve. In this
[1:42:08] in this quote here that we're reading,
[1:42:11] carrying on in the quote, brother
[1:42:12] Bradom, he says, "But Jesus overcame by
[1:42:15] the word."
[1:42:18] Eve fell to the personal temptation of
[1:42:20] Satan by failing to use the word. Adam
[1:42:22] fell in direct disobedience to the word.
[1:42:25] Jesus overcame by the word.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; And right now, let me say that this is
[1:42:31] the only way to be an overcomer.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:36] And and the reason we're talking about
[1:42:37] this today, brothers and sisters, is I
[1:42:39] want to encourage us. There is a way to
[1:42:41] be an overcomer.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; And we can recognize that we can be the
[1:42:45] overcomers. In fact, we're not going to
[1:42:48] be one day. We already are if we're sons
[1:42:50] and daughters of God because he paid the
[1:42:53] price for us.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; This is the way that I want to get to
[1:42:58] with us.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Right now, let me say that this is the
[1:43:02] only way to be an overcomer. And that
[1:43:04] way is by his word.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; By his word, we are overcomers.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; And so what is his word? His word is his
[1:43:14] will.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; And when we talk about his word,
[1:43:18] could we take any portion of his word
[1:43:21] and leave it out
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; and still actually be recipients, the
[1:43:26] full recipients of his word? We
[1:43:28] couldn't. I was having a conversation
[1:43:31] with brother this week about the
[1:43:34] different translations of the Bible and
[1:43:36] how critical is it brothers and sisters
[1:43:38] that we stick with the version that God
[1:43:40] used with his vindicated prophet.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; The devil wants to creep into the
[1:43:44] framework of the Christian church and
[1:43:46] say it's okay to use an NIV. Don't worry
[1:43:49] about it. Just use the NIV. But how can
[1:43:53] you use a Bible that will just
[1:43:54] completely delete a verse?
[1:43:59] right
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; in the book of John. I'm not going to
[1:44:02] get too far into it, but if you want to
[1:44:03] go and study it out, maybe text me later
[1:44:05] and I'll show you the exact chapter and
[1:44:06] verse. There's one verse in there that
[1:44:09] they've taken out completely. And I
[1:44:11] didn't really believe it when I first
[1:44:12] was shown it. I was like, "Wow, maybe
[1:44:14] that's just because it was a screenshot
[1:44:16] of a Bible app on a phone and and I
[1:44:19] thought, my goodness." So, I went and
[1:44:20] found the the NIV Bible that I was
[1:44:23] given. It was uh that man Rory Wilson,
[1:44:27] that man that died of a ALS.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Remember me talking about him? He gave
[1:44:31] me his Bible and that's why I have it. I
[1:44:34] don't have it to study the NIV. But I
[1:44:36] remember growing up and it was you could
[1:44:38] have the King James, you could have the
[1:44:39] NIV. I know in our kids schools they've
[1:44:41] got the NIV and what could be wrong with
[1:44:43] it? Well, when you start taking verses
[1:44:45] out, everything is wrong.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Take one verse out of the Bible and
[1:44:49] you're wrong.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:52] But Jesus, he overcame by the word.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; So imagine if we have a word and we just
[1:44:58] take a verse out.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; How are we going to overcome?
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; What's going to happen is we wind up
[1:45:04] with liberties. Oh well, you know, the
[1:45:06] word of God, it's it's okay. We can just
[1:45:09] do this. It's not okay. We can't just do
[1:45:12] that. Amen.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; I just think it's amazing that we have
[1:45:15] been given the direction that we can see
[1:45:18] there is a way
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; to become an overcomer and and we said
[1:45:23] it already, but we are already
[1:45:24] overcomers by Christ who's already come
[1:45:27] and paid the price, laid down his life,
[1:45:29] rose again, died, buried, resurrected
[1:45:32] again, sat down on the right hand of
[1:45:34] God, the the majesty on high for all of
[1:45:37] us, one sacrifice once and for all. He's
[1:45:39] done that. But I think it's important
[1:45:41] for us to recognize that we have been
[1:45:43] given the ability to understand that we
[1:45:46] are overcomers also. And that's why I'm
[1:45:48] going on today, brothers and sisters. I
[1:45:50] want to encourage us to recognize that
[1:45:52] even though it feels a certain way, the
[1:45:54] prophet of God said, "Feelings have
[1:45:56] nothing to do with it."
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, the Holy Ghost
[1:46:00] is without sensation. It's not about a
[1:46:02] feeling and saying that I feel God and I
[1:46:05] don't feel God. He is where you are if
[1:46:08] you have his spirit.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; What's the identifier? We're going to
[1:46:13] get to it in in in what we read here
[1:46:15] today, but just just for the sake of
[1:46:17] discussion here, brother Bradom talks
[1:46:19] about being able to receive the word
[1:46:22] for what?
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Your day
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; is the true evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; For the people that want to say, well,
[1:46:31] I'll just take I won't take the King
[1:46:33] James version of Bible. I'll only take
[1:46:34] the or I won't take the NIV Bible. I'll
[1:46:36] only take the King James version Bible
[1:46:38] and and that's going to take me to
[1:46:39] Christ. It will take you to Christ.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; It will, but it might not take you in
[1:46:45] the rapture.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't accept God's
[1:46:48] provided way for the day in which you
[1:46:50] live, you will not receive the blessing
[1:46:52] for that age. This age has been promised
[1:46:55] that in a moment, in the twinkling of an
[1:46:57] eye, right?
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; There shall be a body change. There's
[1:47:01] going to be something that takes place.
[1:47:03] Amen.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; I I I was looking at this and I I wanted
[1:47:06] to make sure that I wasn't I wasn't
[1:47:08] actually just throwing off on this and
[1:47:10] making something up that I I just
[1:47:11] thought I went back and checked it out
[1:47:13] and somebody asked Brother Brandham,
[1:47:16] "Will you go to heaven if you don't have
[1:47:17] the Holy Ghost?" If you want to see
[1:47:20] these questions, like I said, check out
[1:47:22] uh Conduct, Order, and Doctrine. There's
[1:47:24] some zingers in there.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Will you actually be saved
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; if you don't have the Holy Ghost?
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Now, this is powerful. Amen.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom, he says, "Yeah, sure.
[1:47:35] Sure, you'll be saved, but you won't go
[1:47:37] in the rapture."
[1:47:39] He says it very clearly in there. And
[1:47:41] and it's 100% right, isn't it? It's
[1:47:44] exactly like we talked about, I believe,
[1:47:46] on Wednesday about the Exodus. If we
[1:47:48] don't have the token,
[1:47:50] many people say they've got it, but the
[1:47:52] only way you're going to have it is to
[1:47:53] die out to yourself will allow his will
[1:47:56] to come forward in your life and say,
[1:47:58] "Be it unto me according to your word
[1:48:00] for this day. Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; And as long as we're willing to do that,
[1:48:03] then he will actually manifest his life
[1:48:06] in our life.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; But we'll begin to see his life in our
[1:48:11] life. We know that. Brother Brandham
[1:48:13] preached it. I say it all the time. It's
[1:48:15] not just an invisible union of the bride
[1:48:17] of Jesus Christ. We begin to live a life
[1:48:20] that's consecrated to God. We don't
[1:48:22] smoke. We don't drink. We don't swear.
[1:48:25] We don't do all these different things
[1:48:26] that the worldly people did that we used
[1:48:28] to do. We don't we don't do that anymore
[1:48:30] when we're truly surrendered to the
[1:48:33] Lord.
[1:48:35] Brother Brandham, he says in this quote
[1:48:37] here also, it is the only way that you
[1:48:40] can know if you are overcoming
[1:48:45] because that word can't fail.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Just going to go back and read the the
[1:48:50] last sentence, but Jesus overcame by the
[1:48:52] word. And right now, let me say that
[1:48:54] this is the only way to be an overcomer.
[1:48:57] Also, it is the only way that you can
[1:49:01] know if you are overcoming
[1:49:04] because that word can't fail.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; So now, I just want to be clear,
[1:49:09] brothers and sisters. How are we
[1:49:11] overcoming?
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; There's only one way to overcome, and
[1:49:15] that's to fully surrender to the Lord.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; But we'll say it a few times as we as we
[1:49:20] finish up our last few minutes here.
[1:49:25] The word of God says that they overcame
[1:49:27] one way.
[1:49:29] By the blood of the lamb.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; And by the testimony that they held.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; That's how they overcame.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; That word can't fail.
[1:49:45] And you know, I think it's really
[1:49:46] important for us to recognize that when
[1:49:47] we have a prayer and we ask the Lord to
[1:49:50] give us the answer to our prayer
[1:49:52] according to his word. Maybe it's
[1:49:55] healing in our mind, maybe it's healing
[1:49:56] in our body. And and we don't see that
[1:50:00] actual prayer come to pass the way that
[1:50:02] we would like to see it come to pass.
[1:50:04] It's not necessarily a punishment. It's
[1:50:07] not necessarily uh anything other than a
[1:50:10] gift from God really. Because if we're
[1:50:12] able to believe this word,
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; even going through that,
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; what's happening? We're actually having
[1:50:19] a character that's molded and shaped in
[1:50:23] the fiery furnace.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; That is the character that we're going
[1:50:26] to get from that.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; But it only comes by that. That's the
[1:50:31] trouble as believers today that we we
[1:50:33] look at it and we think, "I'm failing
[1:50:36] because I've still got this. I'm failing
[1:50:38] because of that. I'm failing. there must
[1:50:41] be something wrong in my life because
[1:50:42] God's still allowing me to go through
[1:50:44] this. We're going to get to it in a
[1:50:45] little bit. Paul spoke to it very
[1:50:47] clearly. It's important. But, you know,
[1:50:50] just because we're going through
[1:50:51] something, brothers and sisters, it
[1:50:52] don't mean that we're failing. It don't
[1:50:53] mean that his word is not as powerful as
[1:50:55] it was ever. All it means is that he's
[1:50:58] shaping his character in our lives.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; And through that, through that alone, we
[1:51:04] are the overcomers.
[1:51:06] If we're still able to serve him as we
[1:51:08] go through those fiery trials, we can
[1:51:11] count it better than gold, better than
[1:51:12] the finest gold we'll ever find because
[1:51:15] it's truly his character.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; How many people in this world can go
[1:51:20] through the fiery trials and still love
[1:51:21] God,
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; not walk away and say, "What kind of a
[1:51:24] God is that? He would let that happen.
[1:51:26] He would allow me to go through that. He
[1:51:29] would he would have this happen. He
[1:51:30] would have that happen." Many people
[1:51:33] would say, "Forget about it. It's crazy.
[1:51:35] Why would I do that?
[1:51:38] And outside of the Holy Ghost, who could
[1:51:40] blame him?
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Who could blame him?
[1:51:43] For us to be able to go through trials
[1:51:45] and still love him, that is the proof of
[1:51:49] overcoming, brothers and sisters.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Not just necessarily saying that we can
[1:51:54] disregard what the prophet said. I'm not
[1:51:56] saying that at all. I'm saying because
[1:51:58] we believe with all of our heart the
[1:52:00] word that's given to us in the day in
[1:52:02] which we live. We're given the ability
[1:52:04] to overcome these trials. And how do you
[1:52:08] overcome? You get back up. You dust
[1:52:10] yourself off. I know maybe I failed this
[1:52:13] week. Maybe I I feel like I let the Lord
[1:52:15] down. Maybe I let my wife down. Maybe I
[1:52:17] let somebody else down. Maybe I failed
[1:52:19] at my job. Maybe I did this. I did that.
[1:52:21] I did the other. But I still get up and
[1:52:23] I go to church and I let the Lord know
[1:52:25] whose side I'm on.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; The young people, we're going to talk
[1:52:30] about it this afternoon. Because you see
[1:52:32] people polished up in church, don't
[1:52:34] think for a second that those souls are
[1:52:36] not scarred battlecard veterans.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; They have gone through the trenches.
[1:52:41] They understand what it means to make a
[1:52:43] fool of yourself. They understand what
[1:52:45] it means to have to go and eat crow and
[1:52:47] apologize. They understand what it means
[1:52:49] to rectify situations
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; that are extremely awkward,
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; but they still serve God.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; They're still coming to church.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; I think what we're talking about,
[1:53:04] brothers and sisters, is a bit of a
[1:53:05] spiritual barometer. Brother Brandham
[1:53:07] talks about understanding here. He says
[1:53:10] it's also the only way that you can know
[1:53:12] if you are overcoming because that word
[1:53:14] can't fail. So, I want to say this. If
[1:53:17] we want to know if we're overcoming,
[1:53:19] where's your stand on the word of God
[1:53:21] today according to the seventh angel
[1:53:23] messenger? I believe that message with
[1:53:25] all my heart. It doesn't matter what
[1:53:26] comes my way or I'm just a little bit
[1:53:28] not sure. If you're just a little bit
[1:53:30] not sure, I want to say to you today,
[1:53:32] God is still working on our character.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; There's still a little ways to go, but
[1:53:38] it doesn't mean you're lost.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; He's already stepped out from eternity
[1:53:42] and paid our fair. All we've got to do
[1:53:45] is accept it the way that he's given it
[1:53:47] to us.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; But if we have a little bit of a doubt
[1:53:51] about this message of the hour, he's
[1:53:54] still working on us. Aren't you thankful
[1:53:56] today that he's still working on us?
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Don't let that be a curse. Let it be a
[1:54:01] blessing. Something is causing us to be
[1:54:03] attracted to this word of God in the day
[1:54:06] in which we live. That's such a
[1:54:07] tremendous thing.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, there's only one way
[1:54:11] that we're going to get the right
[1:54:12] results. And we're not going to do it
[1:54:16] our own way and get the victory. We're
[1:54:20] not going to say that I'll take the
[1:54:21] message of the hour and I'll just
[1:54:23] hybridize it just a little bit with my
[1:54:26] Pentecostal upbringing. I'll just take
[1:54:29] it and I'll hybridize it just a little
[1:54:31] bit with my whatever the adjective is,
[1:54:34] whatever the denomination is,
[1:54:36] upbringing, whatever it is, my
[1:54:38] traditions, my teachings, my theories,
[1:54:40] my thinkings, I'm just going to be able
[1:54:42] to blend it a little bit and bring that
[1:54:44] in and it's going to be okay. It will
[1:54:45] not be okay.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; That is poison.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; That's the That's exactly what Satan did
[1:54:51] with Eve in the Garden of Eden. one word
[1:54:54] off
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; caused her to actually be deceived.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; We're not going to do it our own way
[1:55:01] today to get the right results to get
[1:55:03] the victory. And remember that victory
[1:55:05] isn't something that I do like a video
[1:55:07] game or a a challenge where I get to the
[1:55:09] next level and when I get there I've got
[1:55:11] a victory and when I can get to the next
[1:55:12] level I get a victory and then I can
[1:55:14] move on to the championships and then
[1:55:16] I've got the victory. We're not talking
[1:55:17] about that at all. We're talking about
[1:55:19] actually going through a fiery trial.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. finding ourselves at the hospital
[1:55:24] and saying, "Be it unto me according to
[1:55:26] thy will. Be it unto me according to thy
[1:55:28] word. If you want me to raise up, then
[1:55:30] you're going to raise me up.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; I can't tell you to raise me up.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; But I can say I believe your word with
[1:55:37] all my heart."
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; And if you want me to live another day,
[1:55:40] then you're going to make me live
[1:55:42] another day. And there ain't no devil in
[1:55:43] hell that's going to stop that.
[1:55:46] But to go through a fiery trial and
[1:55:48] still love the Lord,
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; that's the victory, brothers and
[1:55:52] sisters.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; And if you ever had a fiery trial where
[1:55:57] we have had a situation in our lives
[1:55:59] where it's the trial of our faith,
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; I don't know how many people here this
[1:56:04] morning, I want to say it with by way of
[1:56:06] an uplift hand, but don't do it because
[1:56:08] some people might feel uncomfortable
[1:56:09] with it. I'll do it. I've had a
[1:56:12] challenge of my faith where I wonder is
[1:56:14] this message of the hour anything.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Where the devil comes around in your
[1:56:19] darkest hours and says to you, "You
[1:56:22] fool,
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; look what you're doing.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Look at the mess you've made of your
[1:56:28] life.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Why would you ever continue on with it?
[1:56:32] Why not just come back? Come back on.
[1:56:35] Just just come on.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; It's a bunch of nonsense anyway. He
[1:56:39] didn't even hear your prayer.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; But then when you can shake it off and
[1:56:44] say, "Lord, I don't understand it.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; I don't understand it. Why do I still
[1:56:50] have this desire to serve you with all
[1:56:52] of my heart even though my heart is
[1:56:54] broken? It feels like my heart has been
[1:56:56] torn out and put on the ground and and
[1:56:59] animals have stepped on it. That's how
[1:57:01] it feels."
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But you say in the message of the
[1:57:05] hour that our feelings have nothing to
[1:57:06] do with it.
[1:57:08] Amen.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is without sensation. So
[1:57:11] I can say, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; I don't understand it. I can't explain
[1:57:15] it, but I've got this desire to worship
[1:57:17] you."
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; And then we come to a place where we
[1:57:21] recognize that's it.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; That is the victory, brothers and
[1:57:25] sisters. That is God himself manifesting
[1:57:29] through us
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; through our darkest hours. Remember the
[1:57:32] prophet of God, he tried to kill himself
[1:57:34] how many times? Yeah,
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; that spirit of suicide
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; came after the prophet,
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; two or three times tried to kill
[1:57:43] himself,
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe just two.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; But regardless, he was a human.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Wasn't Elijah a man
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; subject to like passions?
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, he was.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; So, he would understand the feelings of
[1:57:59] our infirmities. he would understand
[1:58:01] what it means to be a human being to be
[1:58:04] able to preach to people that knew what
[1:58:06] it meant to witness the power of God not
[1:58:09] in other people's lives but in their
[1:58:10] very own life.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; What is this to me? What does it mean to
[1:58:15] me?
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; We're not going to get the right results
[1:58:18] if we think that we can try and blend
[1:58:20] anything with this message of the hour.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; It's only by his grace that we are able
[1:58:25] to believe this message of the hour. And
[1:58:27] you know sometimes brothers and sisters
[1:58:29] unfortunately this is the world in which
[1:58:32] we live in. Sometimes we need to get
[1:58:34] real weak.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; For him to speak to us.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Not just for him to speak to us. Maybe
[1:58:40] better way to say it is for us to hear
[1:58:42] him.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; For us to actually close our mouth long
[1:58:46] enough and open our ears wide enough to
[1:58:49] listen to that spirit of God. And I say,
[1:58:51] "Lord, help me. I don't want to actually
[1:58:53] have to go through those fiery trials,
[1:58:55] but we all have to.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he allows us to get very, very
[1:59:00] weak.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Why is that?
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Because his strength, not our strength,
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; his strength
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; is made perfect.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; In our weakness,
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; his strength is made mature
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; in our weakness. Amen.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; So the sooner that we can come to him
[1:59:22] and say, "Lord, I don't know. I don't
[1:59:24] have the answer. I don't pretend to. I
[1:59:26] don't want to. I want to die out to
[1:59:28] myself today and let you run the show.
[1:59:31] Every single aspect of it, then we can
[1:59:34] get somewhere."
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 12. Let's turn
[1:59:39] there this morning in our last few
[1:59:43] minutes. 2 Corinthians chapter 12
[1:59:47] talking about overcoming
[1:59:49] and and not overcoming like we said as a
[1:59:52] a a game as a challenge. We're not
[1:59:54] talking about that. We're talking about
[1:59:56] character
[1:59:58] because that's the only way we're going
[1:59:59] to overcome
[2:00:01] is to have a new character. The only
[2:00:03] thing we're taking with us is our
[2:00:05] character.
[2:00:07] It's not our investments. It's not all
[2:00:09] the good deeds that we've done. It's not
[2:00:11] the tenure ship that we've had in the
[2:00:13] message. It's not our knowledge. It's
[2:00:17] our surrender.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; In 2 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 8,
[2:00:23] Paul the Apostle, the first church age
[2:00:25] messenger. This is the pattern for all
[2:00:28] the other church ages. By the way, for
[2:00:30] this thing I besought the Lord thrice
[2:00:34] that it might depart from me. And what
[2:00:36] is this thing? He says that it was a
[2:00:37] thorn in his flesh.
[2:00:39] What was that thorn in his flesh? Some
[2:00:41] people said it was his nose. Some people
[2:00:43] said it was his eyes. Some people said
[2:00:45] it was his temper. There's all kinds of
[2:00:47] different discussions about what it was.
[2:00:50] I I don't know. I'm not going to go too
[2:00:52] far with that. But what I want to say is
[2:00:54] is this. I heard a brother say it at one
[2:00:56] time. Just remember, brothers and
[2:00:58] sisters, don't worry about trying to
[2:00:59] figure out what that thorn was because
[2:01:01] this flesh is the thorn.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; This flesh is the thorn to our soul.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God allowed it. For this thing
[2:01:11] I besought the Lord thrice that it might
[2:01:14] depart from me. And he said unto me, "My
[2:01:18] grace is sufficient for thee."
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; I want to get this through to our young
[2:01:24] people something bad that we can
[2:01:27] recognize that his grace is sufficient.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; His grace is sufficient.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; It's not our good works. Amen.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; When we recognize that his grace is
[2:01:36] sufficient, it gives us the ability to
[2:01:39] come to church.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Because it's not whether I did this this
[2:01:44] week or that this week.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; He He did it all.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; He did it all weeks and weeks ago. He He
[2:01:50] fixed it up so that he could say that
[2:01:52] his grace is sufficient. And remember,
[2:01:54] this is the church age messenger to the
[2:01:57] very first church. Brother Bradom said
[2:01:58] in the church age book, this is the
[2:02:00] pattern set out for all of the other
[2:02:02] church ages. We're not exclusive to it.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; The church age that we live in, my grace
[2:02:09] is sufficient for thee.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; I just love to put myself there. For my
[2:02:13] strength is made perfect in weakness.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; So what does Paul say to it? Most
[2:02:18] gladly, therefore will I rather glory in
[2:02:22] my infirmities.
[2:02:23] And that word infirmities means
[2:02:25] diseases.
[2:02:28] Therefore will I rather glory in my
[2:02:31] diseases that the power of Christ may
[2:02:33] rest upon me.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; His character
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; forget about the signs and wonders.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; All of those things will follow. I know
[2:02:45] we're talking about gifts on Wednesday
[2:02:47] and we're not talking about celebrating
[2:02:48] the the mayy signs and wonders and the
[2:02:52] tremendous things that could happen. We
[2:02:54] know that that God sent a prophet and he
[2:02:56] had the signs and wonders in the first
[2:02:58] and second polls of his ministry. But
[2:02:59] what do we have now is the opening of
[2:03:01] the word and it's not a public show.
[2:03:03] It's an individual affair to be able to
[2:03:06] say I've got that token. I've got the
[2:03:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost in my life.
[2:03:10] Doesn't matter what comes my way. I'm
[2:03:12] going to show that character that he has
[2:03:14] in me.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Most gladly, therefore, will I rather
[2:03:18] glory in my infirmities that the power
[2:03:21] of Christ may rest upon me. That power
[2:03:23] of Christ isn't going to give us signs
[2:03:25] and wonders. Maybe they'll follow, but
[2:03:27] more than anything, it will give us the
[2:03:29] ability to believe this word of God.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; To believe
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; infirmities is G769.
[2:03:39] Febleness. Oh my, I love this. Of mind
[2:03:43] or body.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Febleness of mind or body.
[2:03:50] My by implication,
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; malady,
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; morality,
[2:03:57] frailty,
[2:04:00] disease, infirmity, sickness, weakness.
[2:04:04] Wow. Paul's saying this, most gladly.
[2:04:08] Therefore,
[2:04:10] how many of us will most gladly
[2:04:12] therefore? Oh my, when we're throwing up
[2:04:17] because we're so incredibly sick and our
[2:04:19] our bodies are just convulsing in pain,
[2:04:22] how many of us will gladly therefore
[2:04:25] when when we have to bury a loved one?
[2:04:27] How many of us will gladly therefore
[2:04:30] when we have to deal with all of these
[2:04:32] things in our lives? my
[2:04:37] but that's the example we've been given
[2:04:40] most gladly therefore
[2:04:42] will I glory in my infirmities that the
[2:04:47] power of Christ may rest upon me.
[2:04:51] You know in Revelations 3:18
[2:04:55] he says I counsel thee to buy of me
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; make an investment over here.
[2:05:03] Forget about the Leo and stuff.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Forget about all that. And I counsel
[2:05:08] thee to start making investments over
[2:05:10] here.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Investments in the sky,
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; investments in your time, investments in
[2:05:15] your thoughts, investments in your
[2:05:17] heart, investments of the most precious
[2:05:20] things that you've got. When you're
[2:05:21] willing to do that, I counsel thee to
[2:05:25] buy of me gold tried in the fire
[2:05:30] that thou mayest be rich and white
[2:05:32] raignment that thou mayest be clothed,
[2:05:34] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[2:05:36] not appear, and anoint thine eyes with
[2:05:39] Isav that thou mayest see.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.
[2:05:44] Be zealous, therefore, and repent. Just
[2:05:46] die out to yourself daily is all it
[2:05:48] takes, brothers and sisters.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. be willing to say, "Be it unto me
[2:05:51] according to thy will." Every single day
[2:05:54] I say, "Lord, help me." We get busy.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; It's the life that we live. Sometimes if
[2:05:58] we sleep in, it's impossible seemingly
[2:06:01] to spend some time with the Lord.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; We need to capture the time whenever we
[2:06:06] can.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Carrying on in the quotes, brother, he
[2:06:12] says, "This is actually before what
[2:06:15] we've all read just because I think it's
[2:06:17] it's incredible.
[2:06:20] He says, 'Now we can see why there were
[2:06:22] two vines, one true and one false.
[2:06:26] Now we can see why Abraham had two sons,
[2:06:29] one after the flesh that persecuted
[2:06:31] Isaac and one after the promise. Now we
[2:06:34] can see how out of the same parents, two
[2:06:38] boys came forth as twins.
[2:06:40] One knowing and loving things of God and
[2:06:44] the other knowing much of the same
[2:06:47] truth, but not of the same spirit
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; and hence persecuted the child that was
[2:06:54] elect.
[2:06:57] God did not reprobate for the sake of
[2:07:00] reprobation.
[2:07:02] And we know that's isolation.
[2:07:05] That's to judge
[2:07:07] to be reprobate for the sec sake of
[2:07:10] reprobation. He reprobated for the sake
[2:07:12] of the elect
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; to bring separation between them.
[2:07:19] He reprobated for the sake of the elect.
[2:07:23] Elect cannot persecute elect.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; So just you know when you see
[2:07:32] persecution within the framework of the
[2:07:35] Christian church.
[2:07:39] Elect cannot persecute elect.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Elect cannot harm elect.
[2:07:47] It is the reprobates
[2:07:50] that persecute and destroy the elect.
[2:07:56] Now, I'm just going to pause there for a
[2:07:57] second because I think it's really
[2:07:58] important to point this out. Those
[2:08:01] reprobates are not people that are
[2:08:04] raging monsters in this world.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Just just to make sure we're on the same
[2:08:10] page with this, these reprobates are
[2:08:13] religious.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; They are smart.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; They're of the cane line,
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; the serpent seed.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; They build their babels.
[2:08:26] And we know that's a religion,
[2:08:28] right? The tower. That's a religion.
[2:08:31] They build their babels. They build
[2:08:34] their cities. They build their empires.
[2:08:37] And all the while calling on God,
[2:08:42] they hate the true seed.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; And they will do all they can, even in
[2:08:46] the name of the Lord, to destroy God's
[2:08:50] elect ones.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; I love what he says here.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; This is this is where it's tough to get
[2:08:57] our heads wrapped around to understand
[2:08:59] it.
[2:09:01] He says, "But they are needed."
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; They are needed.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; What is the chaff to the wheat?
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; No chaff, no wheat.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; You have to have the chaff.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; The thing about it though, brothers and
[2:09:23] sisters, is it's not up to us to
[2:09:25] determine
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; where that chaff is. It's not up to us
[2:09:28] to determine where the wheat is.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; By their fruit, you shall know them.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; By what comes out of the chaff because
[2:09:36] the wheat doesn't separate itself from
[2:09:37] the chaff, by the way. The chaff
[2:09:40] separates itself from the wheat.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; It pulls away from the wheat. The wheat
[2:09:45] does not pull away from it. But anyways,
[2:09:47] what is the chaff to the wheat? No
[2:09:49] chaff. No wheat. But at the end, what
[2:09:53] happens to the chaff? It's burned with
[2:09:55] unquenchable fire.
[2:09:57] And the wheat, where is it? It's
[2:10:00] gathered in his garner.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; It is where he is.
[2:10:08] And we know that in the days of uh
[2:10:09] Joseph and his brethren, brother
[2:10:12] Brandham uses that illustration in I
[2:10:14] believe this part of the church age
[2:10:16] book. He says that when Joseph revealed
[2:10:19] himself to his brethren, they were alone
[2:10:22] in the palace.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were alone in the palace. But
[2:10:28] the interesting part is his bride,
[2:10:31] Joseph's bride, was actually apart from
[2:10:34] them. She was separate from them. She
[2:10:36] was in the palace. Maybe I'm misquing
[2:10:38] that, but she was taken and put away
[2:10:41] while he revealed himself to his
[2:10:43] brethren. And and where is the wheat?
[2:10:45] It's where he is. That is where the
[2:10:47] wheat is. So, brothers and sisters,
[2:10:49] today
[2:10:52] I just want to say this. If there's only
[2:10:54] one thing that we could remember from
[2:10:56] our service today, it's not what we
[2:10:59] overcome.
[2:11:00] Because we've got a lot of things to
[2:11:02] overcome in this world,
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; naturally speaking, spiritually
[2:11:05] speaking, everything in between. There's
[2:11:07] a lot of things that we need to
[2:11:09] overcome. The greatest thing that we can
[2:11:11] ever do is overcome ourselves
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; and surrender ourselves to the Lord. If
[2:11:18] we're willing to do that, then the word
[2:11:21] will do the work in us.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; The word will do that mighty work in our
[2:11:27] lives.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Because it's only by the word that we're
[2:11:30] able to overcome.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; If we're overcoming on our own, we're
[2:11:34] not truly overcoming. And remember, if
[2:11:37] we're getting power by seemingly
[2:11:39] overcoming on our own without the word
[2:11:41] of God in our life, it's character
[2:11:43] without the true power of God, which is
[2:11:46] satanic.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; I think it's incredible to have a quote
[2:11:49] like that because that means that there
[2:11:51] is power without the character of God.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; We don't want to have power over this
[2:11:56] flesh without God in it, do we?
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Some might say, "Well, we've been given
[2:12:01] the power of free will. We should be
[2:12:02] able to understand it." The word of God
[2:12:04] says, "Let this mind that was also in
[2:12:05] Christ Jesus be in you." So, whose mind
[2:12:08] is driving us?
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; If it's still our mind, then we're not
[2:12:12] quite there yet.
[2:12:14] But it's not what we overcome, it's how
[2:12:16] we overcome it, brothers and sisters.
[2:12:18] It's by the word of God. It has to be by
[2:12:19] the word of God. The word of God and
[2:12:22] only the word of God.
[2:12:24] Brother Brandham in this in this in this
[2:12:26] quote out of the Leadyian church age, he
[2:12:28] says, "Oh elect of God, beware. Study
[2:12:30] closely. Be careful. Work out your
[2:12:33] salvation with fear and trembling. Rely
[2:12:36] upon God and be strong in his might."
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Not in our own might.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we're strong on our own, then
[2:12:45] we're not actually allowing him to live
[2:12:47] out through us.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; His strength is made perfect how?
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; In our weakness.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; And and that weakness isn't necessarily
[2:12:57] becoming unstrong in our flesh. We don't
[2:12:59] lift weights. We don't run. We're not
[2:13:01] healthy. We don't do that. No, no, no,
[2:13:02] no. I'm not saying go sit on your couch
[2:13:04] and just press play all the time. Don't
[2:13:06] go to work. Don't do anything because
[2:13:08] you're going to be weak. No. Don't do
[2:13:10] that.
[2:13:12] Be strong and in the power of his might.
[2:13:15] Be up and doing is what the prophet
[2:13:16] said. Be the best version of you that
[2:13:19] you can be. Be a normal human being is
[2:13:21] what the prophet of God said. And I'll
[2:13:23] say that I think God even said that
[2:13:25] through the prophet.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Just be normal.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Don't be so spiritual that we can't even
[2:13:31] live in this world.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; But don't be so worldly that you can't
[2:13:36] even be spiritual.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a balance. And he
[2:13:40] brings that balance,
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[2:13:44] our life. Oh elect of God, beware. Study
[2:13:47] closely. Be careful. Work out your own
[2:13:49] salvation with fear and trembling. Rely
[2:13:51] upon God and be strong in his might.
[2:13:54] Your adversary, the devil, is going
[2:13:56] about like a roaring lion, seeking whom
[2:13:59] he may devour.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; You know what I think he's doing? He's
[2:14:03] looking to see who has the token and who
[2:14:05] doesn't.
[2:14:07] those people that have the token, he
[2:14:08] can't touch.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; He can scare them, maybe,
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Growl at them, maybe. He might even try
[2:14:16] and bite them.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; But we know the prophet said that he has
[2:14:19] no teeth.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; But I would not want to stick my hand in
[2:14:24] the mouth of a lion with no teeth. I
[2:14:26] think they've got a pretty strong force
[2:14:28] of bite.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; I'll call the musicians as we close here
[2:14:33] today.
[2:14:35] Rely upon God and be strong in his
[2:14:37] might. He says, "The adversary, your
[2:14:40] adversary, the devil, is even now going
[2:14:43] about like a roaring lion, seeking whom
[2:14:46] he may devour. Watch unto prayer and be
[2:14:50] steadfast."
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; This is the end time. He says, "Both the
[2:14:56] true and false vine are coming into
[2:14:59] maturity.
[2:15:01] But before the wheat matures, those
[2:15:03] ripened tears must be bound for the
[2:15:05] burning.
[2:15:07] See, they all are joining the world
[2:15:09] council of churches.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; That is the binding.
[2:15:15] Soon the garnering of the wheat will
[2:15:16] come.
[2:15:18] But right now, the two spirits are at
[2:15:20] work in two vines.
[2:15:23] Come out from among the tears.
[2:15:27] Start to overcome.
[2:15:30] I love how he says this. Start to
[2:15:31] overcome.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Start to overcome that you may be
[2:15:35] considered praiseworthy for your Lord
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; and fit
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; to reign and rule with him.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; We have the ability to be spiritually
[2:15:47] fit.
[2:15:49] We're not talking about naturally. Sure,
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; we need to live in this world but not be
[2:15:53] of this world. We want to be fit. We
[2:15:55] want to eat properly. We want to do all
[2:15:56] that. But how much more spiritually,
[2:15:58] brothers and sisters,
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; amen,
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; to make sure that we have that token, to
[2:16:02] make sure that we have that life.
[2:16:05] Because through that word will bring
[2:16:07] life.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; The impregnation of that word in our
[2:16:11] hearts, in our souls, will bring that
[2:16:13] life. And that will give us the ability
[2:16:16] to overcome.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me as we close today. I
[2:16:20] love how he says this. Start to
[2:16:21] overcome. Do it. Go forwards and
[2:16:23] overcome. start to overcome that you may
[2:16:26] be considered praiseworthy for your Lord
[2:16:29] and fit to reign and rule with him.
[2:16:32] Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly
[2:16:34] Father, Lord Jesus, this morning, we
[2:16:36] thank you for your word.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for overcoming
[2:16:41] power in the age in which we live.
[2:16:44] Father, if there's anybody of us here
[2:16:46] today, Lord Jesus, that hasn't been
[2:16:49] overcoming,
[2:16:51] I pray that you would just help us,
[2:16:52] Lord, to recognize that we've been
[2:16:54] encouraged to overcome.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; And to be fruitful, to be faithful unto
[2:17:00] you, Lord.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Father, if there's things in
[2:17:04] our life that we need to change, that we
[2:17:06] need to adjust,
[2:17:08] Father, we pray that you would bring on
[2:17:10] the natural circumstances to allow us to
[2:17:12] do it, Lord.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Father, that we would be found fit, that
[2:17:18] we would be found ready for you, that we
[2:17:20] would be truly overcoming.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we thank you and
[2:17:26] we Lord just want to commit each life
[2:17:28] into your hands as we go our separate
[2:17:29] ways today. Father, we pray that you
[2:17:32] would be with those who are traveling,
[2:17:34] Lord. Those who are shoulders to the
[2:17:36] wheel, bringing the word, Father, to
[2:17:39] Lethbridge today.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; We pray that you would bless them for
[2:17:42] their efforts, Lord.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; We pray that you would, Lord, multiply
[2:17:46] the harvest in Lethbridge, Lord.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that you're more than
[2:17:51] able. We pray that Lord Jesus as we go
[2:17:55] forwards this week that you would just
[2:17:57] be conscious in our lives. That we would
[2:18:00] have a God consciousness
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; everywhere that we go, every situation
[2:18:04] that we encounter. That we would
[2:18:05] remember that we're not alone. That
[2:18:07] you're with us every step of the way.
[2:18:10] That you know our thoughts, that you
[2:18:11] know our hearts,
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; and Father, that we would bring glory to
[2:18:16] you.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:18] We just ask now that you would bless
[2:18:20] each one as we go our separate ways
[2:18:22] today. Bless the youth meeting this
[2:18:23] afternoon, Father, and be with those who
[2:18:25] couldn't be here today, Father, wherever
[2:18:28] they are, whatever they're doing,
[2:18:30] Father. Maybe some at work, maybe some
[2:18:32] at home, maybe some are ill, wherever
[2:18:35] they are traveling, Father, we pray that
[2:18:37] you would just keep your hand upon each
[2:18:39] one of them, Lord. And that at your
[2:18:41] appointed time, you would bring them
[2:18:42] back home safe again. Amen.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Father, we'll be careful to give you all
[2:18:46] the praise.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; We just love you and we thank you. We
[2:18:50] just ask all these things in Jesus
[2:18:52] Christ's name.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; In Christ alone.
[2:19:00] In Christ alone will I glory.
[2:19:06] So I could pride myself in battles won.
[2:19:13] I've been blessed beyond measure
[2:19:18] and by his strength alone I overcome.
[2:19:22] [Music]
[2:19:26] Oh I could stop and count successes
[2:19:31] like diamonds in my hand.
[2:19:36] But those trophies could not equal
[2:19:41] to the grace
[2:19:44] by which I stand.
[2:19:50] In Christ the Lord
[2:19:55] I place my trust
[2:19:59] and find my glory in the power of the
[2:20:07] intory.
[2:20:11] Let it be said
[2:20:14] of me.
[2:20:16] My source of strength,
[2:20:19] my source of hope
[2:20:22] is Christ alone.
[2:20:26] Christ alone will I glory.
[2:20:31] For only by his grace I am redeemed.
[2:20:38] Only his tender mercies
[2:20:42] could reach beyond my weakness to my
[2:20:46] knees.
[2:20:50] And now I see no greater honor
[2:20:56] than just
[2:20:58] [Music]
[2:21:00] [Applause]
[2:21:02] my
[2:21:04] [Music]
[2:21:11] [Music]
[2:21:19] Heat my
[2:21:22] heat.
[2:21:28] [Music]
[2:21:32] Yeah.
[2:21:34] [Music]
[2:21:46] Christ
[2:21:47] alone.
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:21:57] Heat.
[2:22:01] [Music]
[2:22:02] [Applause]
[2:22:08] Heat.
[2:22:10] [Music]
[2:22:13] [Applause]
[2:22:18] is Christ.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that's the confession of
[2:22:28] every believer.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; Just like to welcome all of our visitors
[2:22:34] here.
[2:22:35] Sister Maggie from Gatnau, Quebec. God
[2:22:39] richly bless you, sister.
[2:22:42] Also, I didn't want to leave out the
[2:22:44] boys. Brother Wilner, God bless you,
[2:22:47] brothers.
[2:22:49] Certainly thankful to have all the
[2:22:51] visitors with us. Trust that the Lord
[2:22:53] keeps your hand upon you.
[2:22:56] Can we sing the potter's hand?
[2:23:00] Beautiful Lord.
[2:23:03] Oh, beautiful Lord,
[2:23:06] wonderful Savior.
[2:23:10] I know for sure
[2:23:13] that all of my days are held in your
[2:23:18] hands.
[2:23:20] They're crafted into
[2:23:23] your perfect.
