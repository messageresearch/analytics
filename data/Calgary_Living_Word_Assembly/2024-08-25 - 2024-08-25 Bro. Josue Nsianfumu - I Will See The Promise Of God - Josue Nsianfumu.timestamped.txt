[36:00] that we have assembled here. The devil
[36:03] might try to do whatever that he can,

[36:13] lift up our hands, and to thank you,
[36:16] Lord. Father, we did not come here on
[36:20] our own accord. You call us to be here

[37:19] morning. Father, we want to thank you
[37:22] for each and everyone that is here this
[37:24] morning. Lord, we pray the Lord Jesus as
[37:28] brother Paul is trying, Father, to lift
[37:31] us through the song service. Would you
[37:33] help our brother this morning? As the
[37:36] congregation is also trying, Father,
[37:39] would you help us this morning, Father,
[37:41] to worship you, to give you the praise
[37:44] that you deserve this morning? Father,
[37:46] you have done so much for us this
[37:49] morning.
[37:50] We thank you. We bless your name.
[37:54] Father, this morning we have so many of
[37:56] our brothers and sisters traveling.

[44:27] You can just stay. It's okay. Just stay.
[44:29] Just stay for now. You know sometime
[44:31] when we going to the church
[44:36] we pray at home and you don't know what
[44:40] you ask God what can I have in the
[44:43] church I think brother Paul we didn't
[44:45] talk what song you need to sing
[44:49] no
[44:50] lead by spirits mean
[44:53] you can be in the secret place
[44:56] and you pray God
[44:59] so when the young leader
[45:02] or the minister standing in the pulpit
[45:04] preaching and you are 100% sure that
[45:09] what he was asking to God is what the
[45:12] preacher or the leader leading for for
[45:14] people.
[45:17] When brother Paul was leading the song I
[45:20] was re rejoicing in the room
[45:26] he said I'm one of them. Amen.
[45:31] When I will read my quotes, you will
[45:33] know that he was lead by spirit.
[45:37] I was jumping there was singing myself.
[45:39] I say yes, this is part of my preaching.
[45:44] And last Sunday when the preacher was
[45:46] preaching, he didn't know that I was
[45:50] rejoicing. Why? Because that was my
[45:53] prayer.
[45:55] Amen. When the preacher was rejoicing,
[45:57] preaching under anointing, he didn't
[46:00] know there was somebody was praying at
[46:03] home.
[46:04] Lord, I want to bring the preaching. But
[46:07] can you confirm
[46:09] that you want me to preach
[46:12] that on next Sunday,
[46:16] he will see the video and they will
[46:18] know, oh wow,
[46:19] that was somebody was praying for that.

[46:38] So, we'll pray for them
[46:41] and we'll pray for all the brother who
[46:43] traveling and all the brother are sick.
[46:47] Today, something would happen. Amen.
[46:51] You know what we calling anointing?

[51:23] 5
[51:25] 1 2 3. Behold, I will send you Elijah
[51:31] the prophet before the coming of the
[51:34] great and grateful day of the Lord. Go
[51:37] to six. And he shall turn the heart of
[51:40] the fathers to the children and the
[51:43] hearts of the children to their fathers,

[52:12] I will send who?
[52:15] Elijah.
[52:16] No, no, no. Before Elijah.
[52:20] I will send

[52:27] So God mighty
[52:30] before how many people are 100 years

[52:35] Nobody.
[52:37] So before you was born, God already knew
[52:41] your name.
[52:44] So it was busy
[52:47] preparing Elijah.
[52:49] Amen.
[52:51] For you. Amen.
[52:54] So now put your name
[52:57] in you.
[52:58] Okay, we should restart now.
[53:01] Behold,

[53:21] You know who is Elijah? Yeah.
[53:24] Yeah. For us, we know who is Elijah.
[53:27] For the world doesn't know who is
[53:29] Elijah.

[53:35] on his name.
[53:37] Are you ready?
[53:38] Amen.
[53:39] Okay.
[53:41] I will send you
[53:46] the prophet.
[53:48] How many people agree?
[53:55] May the Lord add his blessing to the
[53:57] reading of these words.
[53:58] Amen.
[53:59] God bless you. May seat.
[54:05] Today is another day.
[54:07] Hallelujah.
[54:08] Today is a wonderful day.
[54:12] You know,
[54:14] last Sunday I was
[54:17] not on the earth. I was in heaven.
[54:22] I was enjoying
[54:25] because this was anointing.
[54:28] This was a power of God's.
[54:32] I will talk about the three promise.
[54:33] There's more promises in the Bible.
[54:36] There's a many promises in the Bible.
[54:39] But my subject today I will talk I will
[54:43] I will see.
[54:46] That is the title.
[54:48] That is the promise. I will see.
[54:54] Say by yourself, I will see.
[54:56] I will see.
[54:59] I will see.
[55:00] I will see.
[55:02] And my title will be the promise of God.
[55:07] I will see the promise of God.
[55:12] Amen.
[55:14] The first verse we read
[55:18] this was Malachi
[55:21] and when you are in the message
[55:25] we know that Malachi 4 talking about
[55:28] brother Brham
[55:31] I was preaching in let's preach for one
[55:35] month just this subject
[55:37] I will send you the prophets
[55:42] now I realize realize
[55:44] that Malachi 4 is not only the promise
[55:50] for Brham.
[55:53] You are part of that promise.
[55:58] So in Malachi 4, your name must be
[56:01] there.
[56:04] I will. The one who talking
[56:07] is Jehovah. Yes,
[56:10] I will
[56:12] send you
[56:14] a prophet.
[56:17] So from the beginning, God is busy
[56:20] preparing Malachi or Branam for you.
[56:26] That was the plan of God in Malachi 4.
[56:32] So before the beginning of the world
[56:35] in God's plan,
[56:38] so he promised
[56:40] he say my promise to my people, I need
[56:44] to prepare someone for them.
[56:47] Amen.
[56:50] So he start preparing
[56:52] Brana.
[56:54] Amen.
[56:55] To bring the message
[56:57] but not for everybody.
[57:03] Not for everybody.
[57:06] It's not everyone will believe the
[57:07] message.
[57:09] No, you can preach them at work. I was
[57:14] talking to one of the guys.
[57:18] She's she's a indie. She's from India,
[57:21] but she's there's a Punjabi and Indi.
[57:24] So, she's a Indi. She had a problem with
[57:27] her family's mother law. There was no
[57:30] good communication. So I start preaching
[57:33] her. I said, "Do you believe the Bible?"
[57:36] She said, "I'm a Buddhist." I said, "No,
[57:38] that is not my question. Do you believe
[57:41] God?" She said, "I pray." I said, "No,
[57:44] no, no. I'm not talking about praying.
[57:47] Do you believe?" He said, "Joshua, my
[57:49] problem now is not about who I believe.
[57:52] I need a solution."
[57:53] I said, "Did you pray?" She said yes I
[57:55] pray many time I'm tired that's when I
[57:58] want to talk to you if you can help me I
[58:00] say okay I'll pray for you
[58:04] the next day she remind me you promised
[58:08] me to pray for me but nothing changed in
[58:10] my house that mean you didn't pray I
[58:12] said I'm sorry is it true I didn't pray
[58:15] forgive me but I promise you next day I
[58:18] will pray for you
[58:20] I was just coming in at talk. She's the
[58:25] one who was laughing already, rejoicing.
[58:28] She said, "I know you pray already." I
[58:30] said, "How did you know?" She said,
[58:32] "There's a peace in my house."
[58:35] Thank you for the prayer.
[58:37] So, prayer can change things.
[58:40] Prayer can change even the situation at
[58:43] your work,
[58:45] in a school,
[58:46] even in your company.
[58:49] Amen.
[58:50] Last time, Pastor Bry was preaching
[58:54] and I woke up at 3:00 a.m. I start
[58:56] praying.
[58:59] At 3:30,
[59:01] I sent him a message. He was already up.
[59:06] He was praying, too. He said, "Brother
[59:08] Joshua, oh, everything's good." I said,
[59:10] "Oh, really? You're already up?" He
[59:12] said, "Yes, brother. Since 3:00 a.m., I
[59:14] was already up praying.
[59:17] I didn't tell him anything because I
[59:19] know he's the one supposed to come to
[59:21] preach. So I hide my secret with my
[59:24] family.
[59:26] So when brother Bry was preaching, he
[59:28] didn't know. That's why you read he
[59:30] reads the testimony prayer reports last
[59:34] time.
[59:36] So we was praying at home and we had a
[59:40] problem with my my brother-in-law, my
[59:44] big big brother for my wife. So he was a
[59:47] candidate governor back home and the one
[59:51] who was fighting with him to get the
[59:53] position he had a more money. This guy
[59:57] have a million.
[59:59] So what he did he start corrupt
[1:00:02] everybody from the government. He went
[1:00:06] even to the president's family.
[1:00:10] But we didn't know that kind of story.
[1:00:13] We just pray. And when brother Bry was
[1:00:16] preaching, we was rejoicing, but he
[1:00:18] didn't know why we rejoicing for
[1:00:22] after the service. So I sent him a
[1:00:25] message. I said, "Brother, you didn't
[1:00:27] know what when he was preaching, you
[1:00:29] didn't know exactly what he was talking
[1:00:31] about." That was the answer for our
[1:00:34] prayer.
[1:00:36] And the things changed back home until
[1:00:39] my brother-in-law become a governor.
[1:00:44] It was by prayer
[1:00:47] and after that now he start giving us
[1:00:50] the testimony to tell us exactly what's
[1:00:54] happening.
[1:00:56] He say you guys you was praying but you
[1:00:59] didn't know exactly what is the prayer
[1:01:01] did in our family.
[1:01:04] Even the president's member of the
[1:01:06] family they was corrupt.
[1:01:10] They caugh some money but
[1:01:14] the last word was saying lords we don't
[1:01:17] have a million
[1:01:19] we don't have a more connection we have
[1:01:21] only you
[1:01:23] so we need you to go to the president
[1:01:25] himself
[1:01:27] touch his heart
[1:01:30] so he can son
[1:01:33] so that must be officially
[1:01:35] the the officially ceremony for my
[1:01:38] brother-in-law
[1:01:40] And the testimony is here. The president
[1:01:43] say I know what's going on but the only
[1:01:47] thing I can say the man must read the
[1:01:51] law. That's all my answer.
[1:01:54] That is the only words change
[1:01:56] everything.
[1:01:59] So the Lord
[1:02:01] when you're praying you don't know
[1:02:04] what's going on
[1:02:06] but later on you will see the glory of
[1:02:09] God.
[1:02:11] I will see that is my subject
[1:02:15] today. You will see
[1:02:18] what you was asking to God long time
[1:02:20] ago. You will see. Amen.
[1:02:27] Brother Brana was reading
[1:02:29] a quote.
[1:02:32] He read in Luke chapter 2. Can you take
[1:02:34] it with me please? You just sit. You can
[1:02:37] read it with me. Luke chapter 2.
[1:02:47] Let's start 25.
[1:02:52] And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem
[1:02:55] whose name was Simeon,
[1:02:58] and the same man was just a devoid,
[1:03:01] waiting for the consolation of Israel.
[1:03:05] And the Holy Ghost was upon him.
[1:03:09] Amen.
[1:03:10] That is the good thing to have a Holy
[1:03:12] Ghost
[1:03:13] because the Holy Ghost can speak to you.
[1:03:17] 26.
[1:03:20] And it was revealed unto him by the Holy
[1:03:24] Ghost.
[1:03:25] Amen.
[1:03:27] That he should not see death before he
[1:03:32] had see the Lord's Christ. Amen.
[1:03:38] When brother Brham take this portion of
[1:03:42] scripture,
[1:03:44] if subject was Simeon,
[1:03:47] look at the title of the the subject of
[1:03:49] the preaching just a Simeon
[1:03:53] is someone name.
[1:03:55] If you go to the to the political people
[1:03:58] or party or those things, they will say
[1:04:00] but how kind of preaching is Simeon?
[1:04:03] What does mean Simeon? It's just a name.
[1:04:06] But on that preaching, listen what the
[1:04:08] prophet will say.
[1:04:11] This man, the Lord told him
[1:04:15] by the Holy Ghost. So, Simeon,
[1:04:20] you will never see death until
[1:04:24] you see the Christ. Amen.
[1:04:27] Can you imagine someone with 80
[1:04:31] going around say I'm not going to die
[1:04:35] until I will see the Christ.
[1:04:37] Amen.
[1:04:38] We don't know when the Christ will come.
[1:04:41] We don't have a date, not year, not
[1:04:44] month, but he promised
[1:04:48] you will not see death until you see
[1:04:52] first the Christ. Amen.
[1:04:56] Amen.
[1:04:57] Amen.
[1:04:58] Say to your neighbor, I will see
[1:05:01] I will see
[1:05:02] the promise of God
[1:05:04] in my life.
[1:05:07] Amen.
[1:05:08] Brother, can you put now the picture?
[1:05:15] I will see
[1:05:18] the promise of God
[1:05:21] in my life.
[1:05:24] Did you see this picture?
[1:05:27] Can you see that properly?
[1:05:29] How many can you see that? Let me see
[1:05:31] your hand. I want you to make sure.
[1:05:37] In this car,
[1:05:39] there was a boy driving this car in the
[1:05:43] highway
[1:05:47] from Vancouver
[1:05:49] to Calgary.
[1:05:52] And you know on that session they call
[1:05:55] it chase
[1:05:59] and on that highway
[1:06:03] the speed you can't drive there less
[1:06:06] than 100 kilometer speed. You must be in
[1:06:10] hundreds to 120 even more for those who
[1:06:13] are speeding.
[1:06:17] How many people speeding like me?
[1:06:21] Yeah, my wife she helped me a lot
[1:06:22] because I was working in BMW in Cape
[1:06:25] Town, South Africa. So that is the way I
[1:06:28] become a bad driver.
[1:06:31] I was driving nicely normally but when I
[1:06:34] reach when I I I I went to this company
[1:06:38] there was a law I don't have a plate in
[1:06:40] my car when I'm driving and I can change
[1:06:42] five six or seven car a day
[1:06:46] and all the traffic they know they can't
[1:06:48] arrest me for the speed is a contract
[1:06:54] so I can speed
[1:06:57] 100 because from where I am I have to
[1:07:00] make Sure, because I was a driver in the
[1:07:03] cell department. So most of the time
[1:07:05] when I see the airplane, they will tell
[1:07:06] me in that plane there's our customers.
[1:07:09] So go to pick the guy. So on my roads,
[1:07:14] it's only me.
[1:07:17] So everybody's they are they are not my
[1:07:20] my side. So I can have a X5 or X6. So I
[1:07:24] will speed until the airport to pick up
[1:07:27] the the the customer and bring him back.
[1:07:29] So that is the moment I become a bad
[1:07:31] driver.
[1:07:34] But my wife, she helped me a lot because
[1:07:37] every time when I speed, she said,
[1:07:38] "Honey, did you check?" I said, "1 120,
[1:07:41] but I can go a little bit 130." She
[1:07:45] said, "No, no, they say 120."
[1:07:48] So the boy,
[1:07:50] he was driving according to the law of
[1:07:52] Abera and BC 120 on that highway between
[1:07:56] 110 or 120.
[1:07:59] and he went to collision with a semi-mit
[1:08:02] truck
[1:08:05] and this car flips several time
[1:08:13] and the highway you know the highway car
[1:08:16] a to BC we have a one highway the 16th
[1:08:20] Avenue so on that side is the highway
[1:08:22] national number one so both sides was
[1:08:26] closed because of this car accident.
[1:08:29] Both sides was closed
[1:08:34] and
[1:08:35] they were trying to get out the boy on
[1:08:40] this car.
[1:08:43] Okay. To be serious, I believe this guy
[1:08:45] will be out in the car alive.
[1:08:49] How many people think the guy can come
[1:08:52] out safe and in good condition?
[1:08:58] That is your God can do.
[1:09:01] And the guy who was in this car is your
[1:09:04] brother standing here today.
[1:09:08] [Applause]
[1:09:14] When you serving God, oh Lord,
[1:09:18] when you serving God, he will never let
[1:09:21] you down. Amen.
[1:09:24] I remember this day.
[1:09:27] I was just praying for someone was
[1:09:29] passing out in Vancouver
[1:09:33] after praying for that person.
[1:09:36] And she said to me,
[1:09:39] "Today was my last day.
[1:09:42] I can feel it, but you saved my life." I
[1:09:44] said, "It's not me. It's God."
[1:09:46] Amen.
[1:09:48] Now my back coming back to Calgary. I
[1:09:51] had this car accident.
[1:09:54] I was stucking in the car. If you see
[1:09:57] the picture of brother Branham accident
[1:10:00] almost the same.
[1:10:04] I was stucking in the car. I couldn't go
[1:10:07] out.
[1:10:11] That is experience to say everywhere you
[1:10:14] go get Christ with you.
[1:10:20] I always travel with my Bible
[1:10:24] and my Bible was in my car and I was
[1:10:28] singing.
[1:10:30] I was praising God's driving but
[1:10:33] praising God singing and testifying in
[1:10:37] my car. The Lord withd me. Who is with
[1:10:40] me? Miracle in my life. That is the song
[1:10:44] before I pass away in this car accident.
[1:10:48] Before I pass away, this is the song I
[1:10:51] was singing.
[1:10:53] The song was
[1:10:56] miracle in my life.
[1:10:59] I want a miracle in my life.
[1:11:03] Miracle in my life.
[1:11:05] I want a miracle in my life.
[1:11:08] I will wait and I will see miracle in my
[1:11:13] life. That is the song I was singing.
[1:11:18] You will see. I will read the quotes
[1:11:21] when brother say every time when he's
[1:11:24] walking try to sing something for God.
[1:11:28] You don't know what's going around you.
[1:11:32] Focus your mind
[1:11:34] in think for God. Amen.
[1:11:37] God will help you in the situation.
[1:11:40] I didn't know that in a few minutes I
[1:11:43] will be in this condition.
[1:11:47] And the last words of my month before I
[1:11:51] traveling the other side, I just scream
[1:11:55] Lord Jesus.
[1:11:58] That's all. I was gone.
[1:12:04] Let me tell you something.
[1:12:07] We are so scared of death because we are
[1:12:11] in this flesh.
[1:12:14] When you traveling over sight,
[1:12:17] you don't even care about anything.
[1:12:21] I didn't even think about my wife,
[1:12:25] not even about my family.
[1:12:28] on this car accidents. I was totally
[1:12:31] broken. Broken.
[1:12:34] My body was broken. My hand, my legs
[1:12:37] broken. I couldn't when I traveled to
[1:12:40] the other side, I didn't feel anything.
[1:12:45] Oh Lord,
[1:12:48] I was watching where I was going to.
[1:12:51] Beautiful place, nice place. There's no
[1:12:55] worry for work or for business or for
[1:12:59] school or for anything. Just a peace. I
[1:13:03] didn't want to come back here.
[1:13:07] Even when the Lord will ask me Joshua,
[1:13:09] can you go back to see your wife because
[1:13:11] she will be alone. I will say no you are
[1:13:14] there. Take care of him.
[1:13:18] What about your family? I will say no.
[1:13:20] It's better here than there. But when
[1:13:23] you are in this body, you want to stay
[1:13:26] here
[1:13:34] in this car accident.
[1:13:38] People were trying to help me. They
[1:13:41] couldn't.
[1:13:43] It took almost 45 or two hours
[1:13:49] to take me out.
[1:13:53] Both sides of the roads highway was
[1:13:55] closed. Both sides. Can you imagine?
[1:13:58] Both sides of BC and Abera both sides
[1:14:01] close
[1:14:03] for 2 hours.
[1:14:06] And this was in the news.
[1:14:09] They're talking about that.
[1:14:11] But there was a promise.
[1:14:14] The Lord say you're not going to die
[1:14:17] until you go back to Calgary and preach
[1:14:19] again.
[1:14:23] That's what I lack from God.
[1:14:25] If he promise you something,
[1:14:28] he will do it.
[1:14:31] It doesn't matter what is your
[1:14:32] situation.
[1:14:34] Even you are tired, you say I don't know
[1:14:37] what I can I how can I pay this bill?
[1:14:39] How can I do this? The Lord will
[1:14:41] provide.
[1:14:46] Even you are sick and the doctor say
[1:14:50] that is the hands
[1:14:52] the Lord will provide.
[1:14:55] I will see
[1:14:57] the promise of God in my life. Amen.
[1:15:00] Amen.
[1:15:06] The second promise
[1:15:08] God give promise to Simeon.
[1:15:13] He says, Simeon,
[1:15:15] you'll never see death
[1:15:17] until you see the cross.
[1:15:22] Simeon was not the better person in the
[1:15:25] world like you and me.
[1:15:29] We are not the better person in the
[1:15:30] world but we have a promise.
[1:15:35] Let me read what the prophet say.
[1:15:42] He preaches on 5 54 08
[1:15:47] 04 Simeon that is the preaching.
[1:15:50] Let's go to paragraph
[1:15:53] 13.
[1:15:58] Look what the prophet say.
[1:16:03] And this old man which a great pre
[1:16:05] prestige the Holy Spirit was upon him.
[1:16:09] And the Holy Spirit told him one day,
[1:16:13] Simeon, you are not going to see death
[1:16:17] before you see the Christ.
[1:16:23] And he had a good reason to believe it.
[1:16:27] If the Holy Spirit has say so, it's
[1:16:31] going to be that way.
[1:16:33] Just whatever God say, right?
[1:16:38] Now, I can imagine Simeon going around
[1:16:41] all over the country saying, you know,
[1:16:44] I'm not going to die till I see the
[1:16:47] Christ. Amen.
[1:16:48] Can you imagine God said to you
[1:16:52] that
[1:16:53] you will be the president of the United
[1:16:55] States of America?
[1:16:57] Amen.
[1:16:57] And you standing here in Calgary, you
[1:16:59] never do political things, never do
[1:17:01] something else, you never enjoy nothing.
[1:17:04] And the Lord said to you, I promise you,
[1:17:07] you will be the president of United
[1:17:09] States of America.
[1:17:11] So now you go to America, you start
[1:17:13] telling people,
[1:17:15] I will be the president of this country.
[1:17:20] You know what people will say to you?
[1:17:22] They'll think you are crazy.
[1:17:24] You say what are you talking about?
[1:17:27] We don't even know your name.
[1:17:31] You don't even have a follow up follow
[1:17:33] people who following you on on Instagram
[1:17:35] or or what is the name of that I think
[1:17:40] Twitter on Facebook
[1:17:45] we don't even know you how you be the
[1:17:47] president of United States of America
[1:17:49] said the Lord told me
[1:17:52] I will be the president that's
[1:17:58] 14 now you And imagine that people will
[1:18:01] think they say well that poor old fellow
[1:18:06] has something else went wrong with his
[1:18:09] mental faculties.
[1:18:11] See is it right? Because why look David
[1:18:15] look for him and a prophet looked for
[1:18:18] him and Yahweh in the worst condition
[1:18:22] where was ever in great capacity and
[1:18:26] everything and how is going to see the
[1:18:30] Christ
[1:18:32] and here is a 18 years old or better now
[1:18:36] one foot in the grave because you know
[1:18:39] when you become older people thinking
[1:18:42] think you're going down
[1:18:45] soon you will leave the world
[1:18:48] but young people think when I'm young I
[1:18:52] will take over so it will take longer to
[1:18:54] be like a to see death it will take
[1:18:57] longer but sometime we forget people
[1:19:00] dying as a baby
[1:19:04] people dying in the 20 in the 18th in
[1:19:08] the 10th
[1:19:09] so death is not only for old people
[1:19:12] sir
[1:19:14] And most always when people really trust
[1:19:16] God, they think they is walking up in
[1:19:20] some kind of a illusion or something
[1:19:23] like a fanatism or something. 15
[1:19:27] just like Anna was in at the temple that
[1:19:30] day. She come in. That is what I want
[1:19:34] the church to remember.
[1:19:38] She come in. She didn't go up to the
[1:19:42] temple to see how the woman wore their
[1:19:46] hat.
[1:19:48] She didn't want to talk about the build
[1:19:50] the who build the new home, what kind of
[1:19:53] clothes will be the fashion to the next
[1:19:56] year. She made the building for the
[1:19:58] temple and right for the altar.
[1:20:01] She fell down there and prayed till even
[1:20:06] the priest thought she was drunk.
[1:20:11] She wasn't drunk. She was misunderstood.
[1:20:15] 16. And that the way with and many
[1:20:19] people today,
[1:20:21] they are not drunk or crazy, they are
[1:20:25] misunderstood that they just
[1:20:28] misunderstood. When you get in the
[1:20:30] spiritual thing, the worldly thing, why
[1:20:34] they see carnal the spiritual things to
[1:20:37] the worldly mind?
[1:20:40] And
[1:20:41] so Simeon was that kind of person. But
[1:20:44] no, no matter what people say about him,
[1:20:48] he still believe he was going to see the
[1:20:51] Christ
[1:20:53] because the Holy Ghost told him so.
[1:20:58] Now that is a good way.
[1:21:02] 18.
[1:21:04] If the Holy Ghost tell you something,
[1:21:10] if the Holy Ghost tells you something,
[1:21:14] you just believe what you are going to
[1:21:18] get it.
[1:21:19] And you're going to get it.
[1:21:22] No matter how long it takes,
[1:21:24] it's sure to bring it. It's just got two
[1:21:28] because he say he will do it.
[1:21:34] Every time when you come into the
[1:21:35] church,
[1:21:38] if the Lord says something to you,
[1:21:42] remember that it doesn't matter the
[1:21:45] time,
[1:21:47] how many years, how many months, it
[1:21:50] doesn't matter. The Lord will do it.
[1:21:53] Amen.
[1:21:55] 19
[1:21:56] And I can just imagine the holy fellow
[1:21:59] going around testifying
[1:22:03] and telling the people that he wasn't
[1:22:05] going to die now till he saw the crush
[1:22:10] and he was expecting it.
[1:22:14] Sometime we don't expecting that.
[1:22:18] You know that is your promise but you're
[1:22:20] not expecting that.
[1:22:23] You know sometime you apply for the job
[1:22:25] or the contract
[1:22:27] and you forget even about that.
[1:22:30] You don't even care about that. No, take
[1:22:33] it your responsibility is yours.
[1:22:36] Talk about that. Talk about your healing
[1:22:41] about your promise
[1:22:43] until you get it.
[1:22:46] Amen.
[1:22:47] Amen.
[1:22:49] The third promise
[1:22:53] is the promise gi by Jesus himself.
[1:22:59] The first one was a promise. I will send
[1:23:01] you Elijah the prophets.
[1:23:03] Amen.
[1:23:04] And you know how many people waiting for
[1:23:06] Elijah.
[1:23:08] Last time was going to Israel
[1:23:11] in the airplane.
[1:23:14] I like to preach in the pulpit. It's
[1:23:16] good. That is our mission to preach in
[1:23:19] the church. But I like most the time to
[1:23:22] preach outside
[1:23:26] at work in my life especially in
[1:23:30] airplane
[1:23:31] in the buses.
[1:23:33] That is a good feeling to preach
[1:23:35] directly.
[1:23:37] There was a businessman from a a next to
[1:23:41] me
[1:23:42] and the spirit tell me to talk because
[1:23:46] it was a direct flight from Canada
[1:23:49] straight to Cheru to Tel Aviv in Israel.
[1:23:53] So I said this is a long trip.
[1:23:57] So I start talking to the man.
[1:24:00] First of all he started presenting
[1:24:02] himself as a businessman. So he didn't
[1:24:05] first first didn't want to talk to me
[1:24:07] because you know in the airplanes
[1:24:09] business people so taking care of his
[1:24:11] business and sometimes touching on his
[1:24:15] laptop or something like that. So I
[1:24:17] start talking to this man he say I'm a
[1:24:20] businessman from a some business I have
[1:24:22] some things and directly I ask him where
[1:24:26] are you going to? He say I'm going to
[1:24:28] Israel. I say yes Israel but where? He
[1:24:31] said, "No, we book a package. We're
[1:24:33] going to Jerusalem and we're going to
[1:24:35] this city, this city." I said, "Oh,
[1:24:37] yeah. We going also to to Jerusalem." He
[1:24:39] say, "Oh, that is more interesting." So,
[1:24:41] you going to Jerusalem? Where Jerusalem?
[1:24:43] I say, "Okay, we going to to the hotel
[1:24:46] is in the old city." He said, "Wow, that
[1:24:49] is the place where I'm going to." So,
[1:24:51] from there we start talking.
[1:24:54] So, he found interest now. Okay, that's
[1:24:57] man also is going there the same place.
[1:24:59] So we can start talking and from there I
[1:25:02] start talking about Christ.
[1:25:05] I like to talk about him everywhere. Any
[1:25:08] opportunity
[1:25:10] I start talking anybody say oh amen. Oh
[1:25:13] I'm a Christian too. So glory to God. So
[1:25:16] that is the moment I start giving the
[1:25:19] opportunity to that man to know Christ
[1:25:22] Jesus.
[1:25:24] Everywhere you are preach. You don't
[1:25:27] need just to stand in the pulpit and
[1:25:29] preach.
[1:25:30] No, even your life at school, at work,
[1:25:34] on the business, try maybe someone will
[1:25:38] believe God from you.
[1:25:41] So the second promise was
[1:25:45] Simeon will see the Christ. He will
[1:25:49] never die until we see the Christ. And
[1:25:53] one day the old man was going to the
[1:25:56] temple.
[1:25:57] The Lord told him, "The Christ is here
[1:26:00] in the temple now. Go and meet him."
[1:26:05] It's not everybody was seeing that
[1:26:08] picture. No, only that man.
[1:26:12] He was going to the temple not to see
[1:26:14] anybody,
[1:26:16] not to meet with anybody, not to do
[1:26:19] anything. He was going to see the
[1:26:23] Christ.
[1:26:26] And when you going to see the Christ in
[1:26:28] the church, you will see him.
[1:26:31] Amen.
[1:26:32] When you going to ch to the church with
[1:26:35] a purpose you have in your mind, I'm
[1:26:39] going to receive what I need. The Lord
[1:26:41] will give it to you. Amen.
[1:26:44] On that day in the temple
[1:26:48] when people was passing he was looking
[1:26:51] Lord where is the Christ so I can see
[1:26:54] him
[1:26:56] and when he come close the spirit say go
[1:26:59] to that lady a young lady on 16 years
[1:27:03] old
[1:27:05] carrying a baby
[1:27:08] with no nice clothes not beautiful one
[1:27:12] just the small one, cheaper one.
[1:27:15] And they saw the old man coming.
[1:27:18] When he saw the baby, he said, "Oh Lord,
[1:27:23] lady, can you give me your child? Mary,
[1:27:25] give her the child." Say, "Take it."
[1:27:28] When he touched the baby, he looked at
[1:27:32] her and he said, "Lord,
[1:27:35] I see the promise.
[1:27:39] I see the promise."
[1:27:40] Amen. Now I can go home peacefully.
[1:27:45] You will see your promise
[1:27:48] before you go home peacefully.
[1:27:51] Everything you needs, you will see that
[1:27:54] promise
[1:27:56] before you go home.
[1:28:02] When people was laughing on him,
[1:28:06] he knew today is my day.
[1:28:11] I'm going to see the promise
[1:28:14] right away when he saw the Christ said,
[1:28:18] "Lord, now you can take me home.
[1:28:21] I see the promise."
[1:28:22] Amen.
[1:28:24] You have a promise.
[1:28:26] Oh, I think something's coming.
[1:28:31] Most of the time you woke up at 3. Yeah.
[1:28:35] between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. before
[1:28:38] 5:00 a.m. in the morning, but you you
[1:28:42] don't know exactly why you always wake
[1:28:44] up at that time.
[1:28:47] And most of the time when you wake up at
[1:28:49] that time, there's something coming in
[1:28:52] your mind telling you
[1:28:56] this person or you see a picture of
[1:28:59] someone,
[1:29:01] but you never know why. Why? What is the
[1:29:03] reason?
[1:29:05] This is the reason
[1:29:09] every time when you woke up at 3,
[1:29:12] 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. The first
[1:29:17] picture you see in your mind that mean
[1:29:20] the Lord want you to pray for that
[1:29:23] person.
[1:29:25] Now you got why you always ask asking
[1:29:28] God why I wake up at 3 and 4:00 a.m.
[1:29:32] That was your message. Amen.
[1:29:35] And the third one in Acts chapter 1
[1:29:40] verse 4-6 that is the the third promise
[1:29:47] the Lord say Acts chapter 4 sorry Acts
[1:29:52] chapter 1 verse4
[1:29:54] and being assembly together with them
[1:29:57] commanded them that they should not
[1:30:00] depart from Jerusalem but waits
[1:30:05] for the promise of the Father, which say
[1:30:09] ye have on me. For John truly baptized
[1:30:14] with water,
[1:30:16] but he shall be baptized with the Holy
[1:30:18] Ghost not many days hence.
[1:30:23] This is the third promise.
[1:30:29] Wait, don't rush to serve the Lord.
[1:30:32] Yes, sir.
[1:30:33] Don't rise to sing for the Lord.
[1:30:35] Yes, sir.
[1:30:36] Don't rise to preach for the Lord.
[1:30:38] Yes, sir.
[1:30:40] Stay until you be baptized with the Holy
[1:30:42] Ghost.
[1:30:45] And the Holy Ghost is the the the the
[1:30:50] message,
[1:30:52] the life of Christ in you.
[1:30:55] Then you can start serving the Lord.
[1:30:58] Otherwise, you'll be in trouble. Yes.
[1:31:01] But the Holy Ghost is your promise.
[1:31:05] He promised
[1:31:07] you will get the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:11] So you don't need to worry.
[1:31:15] When I was going to Jerusalem, I like to
[1:31:16] talk about Jerusalem because that is the
[1:31:18] most beautiful beautiful place I went to
[1:31:20] visit in my life.
[1:31:23] You can you can travel around the world,
[1:31:27] but when you reach Jerusalem,
[1:31:30] let me tell you something.
[1:31:33] There's a new Jerusalem. If you go
[1:31:34] there,
[1:31:37] we singing Jerusalem, new Jerusalem. If
[1:31:39] you go there, there's a new Jerusalem
[1:31:41] already
[1:31:42] with a car like we driving here
[1:31:46] with a metro, with all this. That is a
[1:31:50] new Jerusalem
[1:31:52] downtown.
[1:31:54] But there is another Jerusalem. But they
[1:31:55] call it the old city.
[1:31:59] When you enter there, you will feel like
[1:32:01] a David.
[1:32:03] You smell the old city.
[1:32:07] Everything you you you read in the
[1:32:09] Bible, you can see that
[1:32:14] be there. You don't you you don't even
[1:32:16] need to walk.
[1:32:18] You don't want to come back in Canada.
[1:32:20] You don't want to come back. So you want
[1:32:22] to stay there. Talking about the prayer,
[1:32:25] people wake up at midnight
[1:32:28] with kids going to the temple
[1:32:32] to pray.
[1:32:34] Talking about the prayer, your prayer
[1:32:37] can change things.
[1:32:40] Is a promise.
[1:32:42] One of the thing we see when we went to
[1:32:44] last supper where Jesus was with the
[1:32:47] disciple this is where he talking to
[1:32:49] them don't move stay in Jerusalem until
[1:32:54] you receive the Holy Ghost in that place
[1:32:57] you know what's happening there
[1:33:01] when Muslim take control of Jerusalem
[1:33:04] they also took a that place the last
[1:33:07] supper
[1:33:09] if you go inside there you You will see
[1:33:12] the scripture in Arabic
[1:33:15] because that place be it was a mosque
[1:33:18] for Muslim.
[1:33:20] But in that place that is where the
[1:33:23] promise was
[1:33:25] and that promise is not only for Jew
[1:33:30] in the temple. I went to the temple to
[1:33:33] pray and when I was praying a rabbi one
[1:33:36] of the rabbi called me because there's a
[1:33:38] on the they call it the the
[1:33:41] uh
[1:33:43] the what do you call it
[1:33:46] uh the wall cotel they call it cotel
[1:33:50] where everybody can come to pray but
[1:33:53] there is a synagogue next to that in
[1:33:57] that synagogue there is a holy place the
[1:34:01] people can pray and there's also the
[1:34:03] holy of holy so people can pray and I
[1:34:08] was praying one of the rabbi told me
[1:34:12] brother you can't pray like that this is
[1:34:15] not a church
[1:34:17] you know what was my answer I said to
[1:34:20] this rabbi I'm also the son of Abraham
[1:34:25] that was my answer I'm also the son of
[1:34:29] Abraham
[1:34:30] the promise was for Jew first. Stay in
[1:34:35] Jerusalem until you be baptized with the
[1:34:38] Holy Ghost.
[1:34:39] But the promise
[1:34:42] is not only for them.
[1:34:45] The Holy Ghost is not only for them.
[1:34:49] Even for those who are far away
[1:34:52] like those who are here in Calgary
[1:34:54] today,
[1:34:55] the promise is also for you. Amen.
[1:35:00] It's your promise.
[1:35:02] So to be baptized with the Holy Ghost is
[1:35:04] your promise.
[1:35:07] Today I want the church to pray
[1:35:10] because praying it can change thing.
[1:35:14] We have a thing we need to see God's
[1:35:19] and we want to see God's mighty work in
[1:35:24] our need.
[1:35:27] If
[1:35:29] those people receive the promise,
[1:35:33] they are not better than us. But the
[1:35:36] Lord mighty, it give them opportunity to
[1:35:39] get the promise.
[1:35:43] And we need to learn something.
[1:35:48] There's the difference between
[1:35:51] I'm going back to Malachi 4. Yeah.
[1:35:54] I will send you Elijah the prophet.
[1:35:58] There is the sender, the one who sending
[1:36:03] in the middle there is the receiver.
[1:36:08] Those who receive
[1:36:10] and the last one the messenger.
[1:36:14] So the work of the messenger is to bring
[1:36:17] the promise to the receiver.
[1:36:21] Amen.
[1:36:23] But the receiver job is just to wait
[1:36:28] and to receive the promise.
[1:36:32] The one who will make everything to work
[1:36:35] is the sender.
[1:36:36] That's right.
[1:36:37] So it's not your job to worry.
[1:36:40] That's right.
[1:36:41] Is his job to provide everything for
[1:36:44] you. Amen.
[1:36:47] Someone asked me last time, he say, "But
[1:36:50] brother, you wondering to do that for
[1:36:52] your wife to do that?" I said, "Yeah,
[1:36:53] this is my responsibility
[1:36:57] as a man."
[1:36:59] Yeah, I'm think I'm talking to someone
[1:37:00] now.
[1:37:03] As a man,
[1:37:06] everything
[1:37:09] Did I say something?
[1:37:12] Everything
[1:37:14] that your wife needs, you have to
[1:37:17] provide for her.
[1:37:19] Can you say amen, brother?
[1:37:23] Brother, can you say amen?
[1:37:25] Amen.
[1:37:27] That is your responsibility
[1:37:30] to provide everything for your wife.
[1:37:35] Why? The Bible say all the wife desire
[1:37:40] will be to who?
[1:37:42] Brother, can you respond?
[1:37:45] [Laughter]
[1:37:50] All the woman needs will come from the
[1:37:54] man.
[1:37:56] Brother Bonham say I will do everything
[1:38:01] everything I would do to make my wife
[1:38:04] happy.
[1:38:06] And that doesn't mean the wife you need
[1:38:09] to ask for private jets or yachts
[1:38:14] for your husband because you say no no I
[1:38:16] know my right now. So since tomorrow I
[1:38:19] need to make a list
[1:38:22] most of the time I'm traveling to the
[1:38:24] airport standing there long time no I
[1:38:26] need the private jet but Joshua says is
[1:38:29] in the Bible all my needs everything I
[1:38:33] need you provide. I need private jet and
[1:38:36] I need not those one a small one. I need
[1:38:39] the new brand new.
[1:38:46] Amen.
[1:38:48] So sister need to know also I know my
[1:38:52] husband's pockets how much he made. So
[1:38:55] if I need to ask something I will check
[1:38:58] also how much. But the problem sometimes
[1:39:01] as a couple the problem because we
[1:39:04] hiding our salary. Oh, I'm talking to
[1:39:07] someone
[1:39:09] because we hiding our salary.
[1:39:12] That's why your wife doesn't know how
[1:39:14] much you making.
[1:39:16] She will ask you the amount she because
[1:39:19] she doesn't know how much you making.
[1:39:21] But if you show your wife this is my
[1:39:23] salary. This is what I make and she will
[1:39:25] know how much she can ask you.
[1:39:35] Amen.
[1:39:37] That is who God can do.
[1:39:40] That is God's responsibility.
[1:39:43] So he need to make sure you get what he
[1:39:46] promised you.
[1:39:49] He will make it ready. He will prepare
[1:39:52] everything so you can get it.
[1:39:55] If he promised you the Holy Ghost
[1:39:58] himself, God, he will prepare everything
[1:40:02] so you can get the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:05] And you know what he said? The last one
[1:40:07] God was saying,
[1:40:10] I'm going to heaven
[1:40:14] to prepare the place for you.
[1:40:17] That is the most beautiful promise I
[1:40:20] like in my life.
[1:40:21] Take everything from me. Take it. Take
[1:40:25] my dress. Take everything. Let me stay
[1:40:28] with that promise.
[1:40:30] Amen.
[1:40:31] He promise
[1:40:33] I'm going to prepare a place for you.
[1:40:37] A place beautiful than Dubai.
[1:40:42] Beautiful place than Canada.
[1:40:46] You know sometime when you are in in the
[1:40:49] place you don't even think about the
[1:40:51] importance of that place anymore.
[1:40:54] Last time I was in B, I see many
[1:40:57] tourists coming to B. I say what are you
[1:40:59] guys doing here? Because I can go here
[1:41:01] and come back. I don't even not care to
[1:41:02] go anymore to B.
[1:41:05] We was talking with my wife where to go.
[1:41:08] I say B. He say oh we be there before.
[1:41:11] You don't need to go there.
[1:41:13] What about uh another place is closed
[1:41:16] here like Louis? He say oh we be there.
[1:41:19] But you can see people traveling and
[1:41:21] going to B. They want to visit Lake
[1:41:23] Louise.
[1:41:25] And for Canadian,
[1:41:27] why
[1:41:29] Mexico?
[1:41:30] My wife, she say, why Canadian? We
[1:41:32] always going to to South America. Say,
[1:41:37] but we like to go there. And some people
[1:41:39] say, no, we don't go to South America.
[1:41:43] Let us go to Dubai.
[1:41:46] And when you are there in Dubai, you
[1:41:48] don't want to come back in Canada with
[1:41:50] this cold.
[1:41:53] Some people say, "No, no, no. It's so
[1:41:54] too cold there." And somebody from South
[1:41:57] Africa, he say, "Brother, where are you
[1:41:58] stay?" I said, "No, I say Kary." He
[1:41:59] said, "No, no, no, no, no. You don't
[1:42:01] need to invite me. Don't send me an
[1:42:03] invitation. I don't want to go to
[1:42:05] Calgary. This is the most cold place. I
[1:42:08] don't want to go there." I said, "Why?"
[1:42:10] He said, "No, we are here in Cape Town
[1:42:12] in South Africa. So beautiful weather.
[1:42:15] We don't want to get there. But there is
[1:42:17] a promise for us.
[1:42:21] God is in heaven.
[1:42:23] He went to prepare the place for us.
[1:42:27] He say where I am you will be.
[1:42:31] So every time when you go to the church
[1:42:33] remember
[1:42:35] we come to prepare ourself
[1:42:38] to go to meet the Lord.
[1:42:42] Every time when you want to come to the
[1:42:43] church, pray.
[1:42:46] Bring your fire to the church.
[1:42:49] Bring your amen in the church.
[1:42:52] So when you in the church, you receive
[1:42:54] what you need.
[1:42:58] One day I was I was so young when I
[1:43:01] start preaching.
[1:43:03] That one we our life is a testimony for
[1:43:06] young people. Don't say I'm too young. I
[1:43:10] can't preach. I can't save the Lord. I'm
[1:43:13] just 15. I start preach when I was a 13
[1:43:17] years old.
[1:43:19] 13 years old. I remember one day I went
[1:43:22] to preach a old woman.
[1:43:25] I was preaching preaching. She was just
[1:43:27] look at me like this.
[1:43:30] When I finish I got what I was looking
[1:43:33] for. He said, "Did you see my age?" I
[1:43:36] say, "Yeah, you look like a 17 or 18."
[1:43:39] She say, "Yes."
[1:43:41] When I was young, they start preaching
[1:43:43] me, "The Lord is coming.
[1:43:47] The Lord is coming." I move on 20, the
[1:43:50] Lord is coming. 40, the Lord is coming.
[1:43:54] 50, the Lord is coming. And you come
[1:43:56] today again to tell me that the Lord is
[1:43:58] coming on my age.
[1:44:02] I said, "Mom, it's not me. I didn't
[1:44:06] write it in the Bible.
[1:44:09] I didn't write it in the Bible. It say
[1:44:12] the Lord is coming
[1:44:15] and I say yes." Amen.
[1:44:19] And I believe
[1:44:24] everything in the Bible
[1:44:26] we believe.
[1:44:27] Amen.
[1:44:29] Let me read you the testimony of someone
[1:44:31] who's not in the message.
[1:44:35] We we believer we believe in the message
[1:44:39] because
[1:44:40] we know the prophets and we believe is
[1:44:43] the servant of God. But let me read you
[1:44:46] a testimony of someone who never been in
[1:44:48] the message.
[1:44:51] She never attend Branham preaching or
[1:44:55] convention or campen or something. She
[1:44:59] never be there.
[1:45:01] But because she praying to the Lord,
[1:45:06] she said, "Lord, I'm standing here."
[1:45:10] Sometimes we taking Lord like a a
[1:45:13] premier minister or president or
[1:45:15] governor. We are so scared of God. No,
[1:45:18] God is your father.
[1:45:20] Amen. That one sometime say Lord I'm not
[1:45:22] going to the church today until you
[1:45:25] answer me there I will go to the church
[1:45:28] sometime my wife say honey can we go to
[1:45:31] church I say no I'm not going to church
[1:45:33] today I'm staying home and I'm praying
[1:45:36] to God I say Lord
[1:45:38] if I go to the church next Sunday can
[1:45:42] you teach can you tell that preacher who
[1:45:45] will preach
[1:45:48] tell him to preach Which things that I'm
[1:45:51] asking you here
[1:45:55] sometime I'm stopping some preacher
[1:45:56] there standing there even brother Bry
[1:45:58] most of the time I say brother why did
[1:46:00] you stop you say brother Joshua why I
[1:46:03] said but you didn't why you stop because
[1:46:05] I I pray lots to tell me these things
[1:46:07] and you was talking about that and you
[1:46:10] said the time is over so you need to
[1:46:12] stop why
[1:46:19] last time what I Bobby was preaching
[1:46:21] when he finished I said he said this is
[1:46:23] the time now it's 12:00 I said my good
[1:46:26] are you serious
[1:46:30] are you serious because I'm enjoying
[1:46:34] you know the joy is when you praying God
[1:46:37] in secret yeah
[1:46:40] now
[1:46:42] the minister starts preaching the things
[1:46:44] you ask God for
[1:46:47] and now he doesn't know that you are the
[1:46:49] one who ask God
[1:46:51] but he start preaching. So it where you
[1:46:54] are now, you're enjoying. You say, "Oh
[1:46:56] Lord, thank you. You know my heart." So
[1:46:59] you hear my prayer.
[1:47:00] Can you give me more?
[1:47:02] And immediately the preacher just
[1:47:04] stopped right away. Is it time to go
[1:47:07] 12:00?
[1:47:08] I said, "Are you killing me, brother?"
[1:47:12] Last time Brother Toby was preaching. He
[1:47:15] was preaching about marriage. You know
[1:47:18] what I was preaching brother Toby last
[1:47:20] time? And when he say I didn't touch my
[1:47:24] second part, I said, "Are you killing
[1:47:26] me? You You didn't finish your second
[1:47:28] part. You want to finish this, brother?"
[1:47:31] And I went home. I kneel down and say,
[1:47:34] "Lord, I know brother Bry would call me
[1:47:37] to preach."
[1:47:39] But father, I ask you when brother Bry
[1:47:42] would ask me to preach, I will go back
[1:47:44] to brother Bry and I'll say, "Brother
[1:47:46] Bry, thank you because you want me to
[1:47:48] preach. I'm not going to preach. take my
[1:47:51] time, give it to brother Toby to finish
[1:47:55] his preaching
[1:47:56] because this was my my joy. I was
[1:47:58] enjoying that preaching.
[1:48:02] After that said, Brother Bry sent me a
[1:48:04] message. I said, I got it.
[1:48:07] I said, "Brother Bry, brother Bry, thank
[1:48:09] you.
[1:48:11] But I'm asking you, don't say no."
[1:48:15] Everybody say, "Brother Joshua, what's
[1:48:16] going on?" Even another brother say,
[1:48:18] "Bro Joshua, you have to preach."
[1:48:21] Because brother B already talked about
[1:48:23] that in the pulpit. How many people
[1:48:25] remember that day?
[1:48:27] Brother Bry even give the program. He
[1:48:29] say on the 4th of August, Brother Joshua
[1:48:32] will preach. And later on I said, "Bra,
[1:48:35] I'm not going to preach." Say, "Why?" I
[1:48:37] said, "No, I'm asking you now. Take my
[1:48:41] time."
[1:48:42] Just take it straight to brother Toby to
[1:48:45] finish his preaching. Amen.
[1:48:48] Brother Joshua, why? I said, no, no, no.
[1:48:51] I'll explain to you. I was praying,
[1:48:55] Lord, speak to me.
[1:48:57] Now, the Lord was speaking to me through
[1:48:59] brother Toby in the pulpit, but brother
[1:49:02] Toby didn't know that.
[1:49:03] Hallelujah.
[1:49:04] Now, he didn't finish.
[1:49:07] What can I do?
[1:49:10] I need more. So, he must finish. Amen.
[1:49:13] So now the Lord's Oh my goodness.
[1:49:17] So now the Lord because he know what I
[1:49:19] ask him.
[1:49:21] He say okay now I will go to Bry heart
[1:49:26] to tell him you must pray but you must
[1:49:28] preach.
[1:49:30] So brother but Barry didn't know that
[1:49:32] the Lord is the one who tell him to call
[1:49:34] me to preach.
[1:49:35] Amen.
[1:49:36] But I had my my plan B.
[1:49:40] So when he called me, "Brother Joshua,
[1:49:42] we want you to preach." I said, "Thank
[1:49:44] you, but I have a plan." Say, "What is
[1:49:47] the plan?" I said, "Okay,
[1:49:49] please don't say no." Say, "Why?"
[1:49:52] Don't say no.
[1:49:54] Amen.
[1:49:57] Let brother Toby to finish his preaching
[1:50:00] because he didn't finish.
[1:50:03] Hallelujah.
[1:50:04] He said, "Why?" I said, "Okay, no, let
[1:50:06] me explain to you because maybe you need
[1:50:07] explanation.
[1:50:09] I was praying to God. I said, "Lord, can
[1:50:12] you speak to me?"
[1:50:14] Amen.
[1:50:14] So the Lord say, "Okay, I choose the one
[1:50:16] who will preach. He will speak to you."
[1:50:18] Hallelujah.
[1:50:19] Now, it didn't finish what I was
[1:50:20] expecting to finish.
[1:50:23] Now, because it didn't finish, I pray
[1:50:27] Lord, if when you want to touch brother
[1:50:29] Barry to give me opportunity to preach,
[1:50:31] I'm not going to preach. I will tell
[1:50:33] brother Barry to give it to brother Toby
[1:50:35] to finish his preaching.
[1:50:36] Amen.
[1:50:37] That is what God can do.
[1:50:39] Yes.
[1:50:40] And I was in the office.
[1:50:43] But I b say
[1:50:45] okay
[1:50:47] is possible. Okay. I'll talk to brother
[1:50:50] Toby. So I will change my mind.
[1:50:52] Hallelujah.
[1:50:53] That is why he give brother Toby to
[1:50:54] continue the preaching. I was so happy.
[1:50:57] Hallelujah.
[1:50:59] If God can hear your prayer,
[1:51:01] yes,
[1:51:02] that mean he knows about you. Yeah.
[1:51:06] And last Sunday was a jouring.
[1:51:08] Last Sunday was another 12.
[1:51:11] I was praying already when brother Bryce
[1:51:13] said, "Brother Josh, you preach?" I
[1:51:15] start preparing my preaching.
[1:51:18] I will see the promise of God.
[1:51:21] Hallelujah.
[1:51:22] I say, "But Lord, to confirm to me, not
[1:51:26] to the church, I'm talking about me. to
[1:51:30] confirm that you want me to preach this
[1:51:34] subject.
[1:51:36] Let the preacher who standing behind the
[1:51:38] pulpit to talk about the promise of God.
[1:51:41] Hallelujah.
[1:51:42] That's why you see me jumping.
[1:51:44] Hallelujah.
[1:51:44] Last Sunday I was jumping. I said,
[1:51:46] "Lord, thank you." Because he was
[1:51:49] talking about the promise of God.
[1:51:53] That is the way to worship God. Amen.
[1:51:57] And when you feel the anointing of God
[1:52:01] in the church, that is the moment for
[1:52:04] you to pray.
[1:52:08] Listen the testimony of this lady. She's
[1:52:12] not in the message.
[1:52:17] Led by spirits
[1:52:20] 5904
[1:52:22] 07.
[1:52:25] Brother, you ready?
[1:52:28] Listen this testimony. I like it
[1:52:31] because before I talk about this lady,
[1:52:36] you know, most of the time when we
[1:52:40] praying,
[1:52:42] we think that God can do that this way
[1:52:46] or maybe this way. No. Sometime you need
[1:52:49] to say to the God and tell him God I
[1:52:52] want you
[1:52:54] to do that this this this this I will
[1:52:59] know it's you because it was between me
[1:53:01] and you only
[1:53:07] for example today if you ask God lord I
[1:53:11] need 10 million in my bank account
[1:53:14] tomorrow morning
[1:53:17] if you see this accounts in your bank.
[1:53:19] Are you want to be surprised?
[1:53:21] No. Because you know is my father will
[1:53:23] give to me because I ask him in private.
[1:53:26] But the way he can he can do that you
[1:53:28] don't know. Maybe he can take it by by
[1:53:31] force to someone account he take it off
[1:53:34] and he send it to you. Maybe he can take
[1:53:37] it someone make a mistake or do a
[1:53:38] transaction he maybe he steal someone
[1:53:41] money he want to put it account the lord
[1:53:43] say okay catch it. This is for my sons
[1:53:45] who are asking me. Okay, I put it here.
[1:53:49] But you know this was the money I asked
[1:53:52] God. Listen to this testimony.
[1:53:56] Just a little person testimony of
[1:53:58] something come in my mouth. That is
[1:54:00] brother Brown talking.
[1:54:04] I was coming from Dallas not long ago a
[1:54:08] few years ago and there come a storm in
[1:54:11] the hill.
[1:54:13] How many was in Calgary last week?
[1:54:20] You know what's happening?
[1:54:23] The Lord knows everything.
[1:54:27] Maybe someone was asking to assurance to
[1:54:29] pay something and they say no. So God
[1:54:32] say okay because you don't want to pay
[1:54:34] I'll bring the storm so the people can
[1:54:36] pay the assurance.
[1:54:41] Listen to this testimony.
[1:54:45] And I was on one of the airline and he
[1:54:50] came down in at Memphis.
[1:54:53] And so they told me to go up to the
[1:54:56] limousine was taking me up to the
[1:54:59] peboard hotel. It's a great place.
[1:55:03] I thought that would be good if at least
[1:55:06] one time I get to the to stay in the big
[1:55:10] hotel.
[1:55:12] You see,
[1:55:14] I'll tell you,
[1:55:16] brother Brandham never be in the big
[1:55:17] hotel.
[1:55:19] He never be in the limousine.
[1:55:21] Never.
[1:55:24] But you know the cause.
[1:55:27] Someone was praying. And that prayer
[1:55:30] bring blessing to brother Brham to to
[1:55:33] stay in the big big hotel and to be to
[1:55:38] be drive in the limosine because of the
[1:55:41] prayer of someone.
[1:55:43] Your prayer can bring anoint to me to
[1:55:46] preach.
[1:55:48] Your prayer can bring a not to song
[1:55:51] leader to sing.
[1:55:53] That one where he was singing I'm one of
[1:55:55] them. You okay let me just read it.
[1:55:58] You'll know. So brother, you will know
[1:55:59] why you are singing. I'm one of them.
[1:56:04] It was a great place. I thought that
[1:56:06] will be good if at least one time I get
[1:56:09] to say in the big hotel. So they was
[1:56:11] going to pay for it. You see the company
[1:56:15] have to pay money.
[1:56:19] When he was going to to Jerusalem,
[1:56:22] we learned from Calgary. We go to
[1:56:24] Toronto.
[1:56:27] and the plane was late.
[1:56:30] I said I don't care. They will pay for
[1:56:33] the hotel. They will pay for everything.
[1:56:35] I was sleeping. Next day I will go
[1:56:36] straight.
[1:56:39] And on this situation,
[1:56:41] the airline have to pay for the hotel
[1:56:44] for brother Brham for the limo for
[1:56:47] brother Brham. But brother Brham was not
[1:56:51] expecting that.
[1:56:57] So they took me up and give me a nice
[1:57:00] room. When they talking a nice room that
[1:57:02] mean
[1:57:05] nice room at their expensive.
[1:57:10] So after I got settled down the phone
[1:57:13] ring I was writing some letters and
[1:57:16] fixing to read to read my Bible.
[1:57:21] a Christian
[1:57:23] baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:26] Everywhere you go,
[1:57:29] mission services, school program,
[1:57:32] everywhere, take your Bible.
[1:57:38] A Christian have to read his Bible every
[1:57:41] single day because that is your food,
[1:57:44] spiritual food.
[1:57:46] Read the Bible every single day. Even
[1:57:50] one verse
[1:57:52] read it. Can you say amen?
[1:57:55] Amen.
[1:58:00] And the and then pray. So read the Bible
[1:58:04] and pray
[1:58:06] and go to bed saying, "Reverend Abraham,
[1:58:10] the plan will be leaving in the morning
[1:58:12] at 7:00. This flight will not go out
[1:58:16] until 7." The limo will pick you up at
[1:58:21] 7.
[1:58:22] That was the agreement with the airline.
[1:58:27] There's a thunderstorm.
[1:58:30] They don't know who make this
[1:58:32] thunderstorm.
[1:58:35] You can change the weather of the
[1:58:37] country.
[1:58:39] Like I'm changing a weather some now in
[1:58:42] US
[1:58:43] because there's a weather I'm changing
[1:58:45] for my program. I'm changing the the
[1:58:46] weather. When I come back, I'll give you
[1:58:48] the testimony. I'm already changing that
[1:58:50] weather
[1:58:51] for me.
[1:58:58] Your prayer
[1:59:00] can go to heaven
[1:59:02] and bring the sun.
[1:59:06] Your prayer can go to heaven and change
[1:59:10] the weather,
[1:59:13] thunderstorm.
[1:59:15] You see
[1:59:17] the captain was good because he say
[1:59:19] we're going to the city but what's
[1:59:22] happening the weather change
[1:59:24] so we continue our journey let us land
[1:59:29] in Memphis
[1:59:31] according to the science it's normal
[1:59:36] it's normal but they didn't know all
[1:59:40] these things happening is because
[1:59:43] someone was praying Yeah,
[1:59:47] listen. I say very well, sir. I hung up
[1:59:52] and finished my meal, my meal and pray
[1:59:55] and went to the beds and that's them to
[1:59:57] call them. And early in the morning, I
[2:00:00] got up and I thought I don't want any
[2:00:03] breakfast.
[2:00:05] Somehow I just feel like
[2:00:08] it's beautiful morning. The sun has come
[2:00:11] out real pretty. This was springtime. So
[2:00:15] I thought I will run down real quick and
[2:00:19] find the post office box and mail these
[2:00:21] letters
[2:00:23] before the limo comes me up to pick me
[2:00:26] up for the airport. And I was starting
[2:00:29] out with with the letters in my hands
[2:00:33] going down the streets and all of sudden
[2:00:37] something say stop.
[2:00:42] If you have a Holy Ghost,
[2:00:44] the Lord can tell you today don't go at
[2:00:47] work.
[2:00:50] The Lord can tell you today don't go at
[2:00:52] school. Parents, sometime when the kid
[2:00:55] tell you, "Daddy, I don't feel my heart
[2:00:59] to go to school."
[2:01:01] Pray with the boy.
[2:01:03] You don't know what's what's going on in
[2:01:05] her heart.
[2:01:06] Maybe the Lord want the Lord don't want
[2:01:08] that person to go to school. something
[2:01:11] will happen.
[2:01:15] The Lord is so merciful. He can speak
[2:01:17] even to the kids. Can you imagine was
[2:01:20] speaking to donkey?
[2:01:22] What about a man? What about our kids?
[2:01:25] What about our parents?
[2:01:30] Stop and go back the other way. So
[2:01:33] brother was going this way. He just hear
[2:01:36] the voice stop.
[2:01:38] go back on this way. Oh, I thought that
[2:01:43] maybe that was a impression.
[2:01:46] Why should I want to go back that way?
[2:01:50] That is the prophets,
[2:01:52] the most inspired prophet in the world.
[2:01:57] The most powerful prophet in the world
[2:02:00] since Enoch,
[2:02:03] there's no one other prophet like
[2:02:05] William Albrano.
[2:02:06] Amen.
[2:02:08] Amen.
[2:02:09] Amen.
[2:02:10] Amen.
[2:02:11] Amen.
[2:02:12] Are you doubting or no?
[2:02:16] Listen before I continue.
[2:02:21] Jesus says
[2:02:25] people was born from the woman,
[2:02:28] there is no one
[2:02:31] bigger than John the Baptist.
[2:02:34] Did you know that? Amen.
[2:02:37] No one Abraham, Isaac, Moses who was
[2:02:42] talking to God face to face. Jesus said
[2:02:46] John the Baptist was most powerful and
[2:02:50] the bigger one than all of them.
[2:02:55] Why? Because he the one introduced
[2:02:58] Christ to the world.
[2:03:01] Now in this time
[2:03:04] all the prophet in the world
[2:03:07] there's no one bigger than Malachi 4.
[2:03:12] Why? Because he's the one who introduced
[2:03:15] Christ like a John the Baptist.
[2:03:18] That is making me bigger.
[2:03:20] But he's bigger than John the Baptist
[2:03:24] because he had the seven thunders.
[2:03:30] the revelation of the Bible.
[2:03:35] Let me continue.
[2:03:39] But the Lord didn't speak to him.
[2:03:41] Sometime the Lord's not going to speak
[2:03:42] to the person because he's the most
[2:03:44] spiritual person in the church. But
[2:03:47] sometime the Lord was not going to speak
[2:03:48] to him and he speak to you to say
[2:03:50] something.
[2:03:53] So I just keep going and it got stronger
[2:03:56] and stronger until I say, "Oh, I must
[2:04:00] pray. This might be the Holy Spirit."
[2:04:03] Amen.
[2:04:04] This must be the Holy Spirit.
[2:04:07] And there was I happened to pass by a
[2:04:12] shop that has fishing tacklet in its
[2:04:15] soul. So I went up in the little doorway
[2:04:18] there to look for the fishing tacklet.
[2:04:21] more at act like they was looking for
[2:04:25] it. And I see the big Irish cop over
[2:04:29] there giving signal and letting the
[2:04:31] people crossing no one around me and I
[2:04:33] bow my head and I say, "Lord, was that
[2:04:38] you speaking to me to go back?" I want
[2:04:42] to say something.
[2:04:44] If you don't have a place to pray at
[2:04:46] your work, you feel in your heart to
[2:04:49] pray, even at school, you don't have a
[2:04:52] place to pray, go even to the washroom,
[2:04:55] kneel down, pray.
[2:04:58] Did you got me?
[2:04:59] Amen.
[2:05:02] And something said to me, "Turn and go
[2:05:05] back." I was sure it was God's. I
[2:05:09] believe that people who are born of the
[2:05:12] Holy Spirit understand what I'm talking
[2:05:14] about. Are you understand that?
[2:05:17] Just something impressing you. So not
[2:05:21] audible voice or a vision but just
[2:05:24] something that's impressing you. People
[2:05:26] are born set in the church to see vision
[2:05:30] and so forth. But the Holy Ghost works
[2:05:32] in many different way and it is just
[2:05:35] real. the Holy Spirit one way as it is
[2:05:39] the other way. It's all the Holy Spirit.
[2:05:43] So I turn and start walking, walking and
[2:05:48] I just keep on walking. Finally
[2:05:52] I found myself down in the coloring
[2:05:55] street. The street I look at my watch
[2:05:59] and it was 10 minutes after 7.
[2:06:03] Can you imagine?
[2:06:06] He's just walking. The spirit say go.
[2:06:09] Okay, I'm going. Go go go go going go.
[2:06:12] He say but I have to take my plan. So he
[2:06:14] check words. Oh,
[2:06:17] my time is already passed.
[2:06:22] Oh, I thought I missed my plan. That is
[2:06:25] the prophet of God.
[2:06:27] The one who speaking to Jesus himself
[2:06:31] face to face but he didn't reveal to
[2:06:34] him.
[2:06:36] The one who getting a vision clearly
[2:06:39] but the Lord didn't speak to him. The
[2:06:42] one who can hear the voice of God like
[2:06:44] you listen to me
[2:06:46] but the Lord didn't say anything to him.
[2:06:50] I thought I missed my plan but something
[2:06:53] just keep arguing me. Go on, just keep
[2:06:57] on moving. I trust that the same spirits
[2:07:00] tonight when you are praying for whether
[2:07:03] you are praying for here at the platform
[2:07:06] or not will let you get a vision of
[2:07:10] Christ promise to you and just urged you
[2:07:14] to keep on I can just move one finger
[2:07:18] just keep on moving that finger till you
[2:07:21] get moving a hand and then a arm and
[2:07:23] then a leg and so forth and then go on I
[2:07:26] feel just a little better. Well, keep
[2:07:30] praising God. Keep going on. Don't get
[2:07:33] off on the slide, on the sideline. Maybe
[2:07:36] I will go back in the prayer line again.
[2:07:39] That's not good. Go on like the way you
[2:07:42] are going. Just keep being lead by
[2:07:44] spirit by Holy Spirit. That way, little
[2:07:48] voice if you just open your heart, you
[2:07:52] will hear it.
[2:07:54] 25. Notice
[2:07:57] as we went on down the street, he and I
[2:08:02] who's high.
[2:08:04] Who's he?
[2:08:06] Jesus.
[2:08:08] So the prophet knew now after praying he
[2:08:13] was walking with someone next to him.
[2:08:16] Amen.
[2:08:18] Somebody last time he called me said,
[2:08:19] "Brother Joshua, you you you you bossif
[2:08:22] yourself. You look like a you are I
[2:08:25] don't know if he's a deputy or you look
[2:08:27] like a president." I say, "I'm a more
[2:08:29] than all of them."
[2:08:32] Last time when come I went to the minute
[2:08:34] to meet with him and the bodyguard say
[2:08:37] who are you? I'm say I'm Joshua. You say
[2:08:39] okay stay here. And people are saying
[2:08:41] who's Joshua? They check but who's who's
[2:08:44] Joshua? because he's not a deputy, he's
[2:08:46] not a minister, he's not member of the
[2:08:48] parliament, he's not in the list. I say
[2:08:50] I'm a Joshua that is my name
[2:08:54] because spiritually talking you walking
[2:08:58] with thousand thousand angels
[2:09:02] when the president of United States
[2:09:04] traveling
[2:09:06] 3050
[2:09:08] to to no 250 to 300 bodyguards
[2:09:15] CIA, FBI, police, service secret. Every
[2:09:20] all those people they working for one
[2:09:22] man.
[2:09:25] You are the door of God.
[2:09:28] You are the son of God.
[2:09:30] There's a thousand angel walking with
[2:09:32] you.
[2:09:35] So don't be scared.
[2:09:37] You are the son of God.
[2:09:40] Angel
[2:09:42] hiding you.
[2:09:44] Notice as I went down the streets,
[2:09:46] beautiful morning, the sun was rising
[2:09:49] down and the rose was blooming down in
[2:09:51] the little clashet of the rumbling rose
[2:09:54] and sof and the fresh rain and the sun
[2:09:57] coming out and brought me the frag of
[2:09:59] the other sight and it was beautiful
[2:10:02] morning and I was going along there. I
[2:10:05] didn't know no more of where I was going
[2:10:09] down.
[2:10:12] Than I will know if I start out this
[2:10:16] vice versa from my hotel tonight just
[2:10:19] going along late by the spirit. I
[2:10:23] thought oh I done missing my plane so
[2:10:26] I'll just catch another one. I'm in no
[2:10:30] worry anymore.
[2:10:32] go three or four days before another
[2:10:35] meeting. I just keep walking around just
[2:10:38] thinking, Lord,
[2:10:41] I don't know where you taking me to.
[2:10:46] Maybe a place of prayer. I passed by a
[2:10:50] bunch of leaders stack
[2:10:52] lac where the some of the kola people
[2:10:54] live. I look leaning across and gates.

[2:11:07] light of your grammar because mine's
[2:11:10] worse than yours but she was learning
[2:11:14] out a typical aunt Jima with a man
[2:11:18] t-shirt tying around her head great big
[2:11:21] fat cheeks and she was looking down the
[2:11:24] street when I come up I I was singing
[2:11:28] that song.
[2:11:30] Let me say I was singing that brother
[2:11:33] Paul's song.
[2:11:34] Amen.
[2:11:35] Song. That's you Pentecostal people
[2:11:38] singing about. I'm so glad I can say I'm
[2:11:41] one of them.
[2:11:44] One of them.

[2:11:53] But are you see now why you sing that
[2:11:54] song? Amen.
[2:11:55] He was already in the message.
[2:11:58] Amen.
[2:11:59] Amen.
[2:12:02] They were all together in the harper
[2:12:03] room all praying in his name. They were
[2:12:07] baptized with the Holy Ghost and the
[2:12:09] power for the service come. And what he
[2:12:12] did for them that day, he will do for
[2:12:15] you the same.

[2:12:24] for you today.
[2:12:27] I'm so glad that I can say
[2:12:30] I'm one of them.
[2:12:33] And I was trying to learn that little
[2:12:35] song.
[2:12:37] I was going along whoming on myself.
[2:12:42] Brother, I can read all the quotes, but
[2:12:45] let me go so I can I can finish.
[2:12:50] Oh my goodness.
[2:12:53] It's so beautiful
[2:12:55] when you're praying and the Lord can
[2:12:58] prove
[2:12:59] Yes.
[2:12:59] to prove to you that I hear your prayer.
[2:13:03] And I answering your prayer
[2:13:05] so this is the result.
[2:13:08] If you go down,
[2:13:10] you see brotherham, the lady was waiting
[2:13:14] for him.
[2:13:16] The lady was not shaking.
[2:13:19] She knew her position.
[2:13:23] Brother Branab didn't know anything.
[2:13:28] But the lady, she was waiting.
[2:13:32] She said, "I pray God
[2:13:35] to bring Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:13:39] I pray I pray God
[2:13:42] to bring
[2:13:44] Malachi 4
[2:13:47] Elijah the prophet.
[2:13:49] Remember
[2:13:51] that lady? She was not a believer in the
[2:13:53] message.
[2:13:54] No,
[2:13:56] she never be in the Branham camp.
[2:14:00] She even doesn't know brother Brham.
[2:14:02] Amen.
[2:14:03] But she pray God say, "Lord,
[2:14:06] I need something."
[2:14:09] We know that Elijah was already passed
[2:14:11] away and he went to heaven long time ago
[2:14:14] in the Bible. We know everybody we know.
[2:14:17] But the lady said, "Lord, today I'm
[2:14:21] praying you bring me Elijah the
[2:14:25] prophet."
[2:14:27] I don't want to go to look for Elijah.
[2:14:30] God bring me Elijah in my house.
[2:14:36] So I'm standing here after prayer
[2:14:40] waiting for Elijah.
[2:14:42] So Lord bring Elijah.
[2:14:45] That is the level of prayer I need the
[2:14:47] church to be. Amen.
[2:14:49] You are able to say, "Lord, I'm standing
[2:14:52] here and I need the president of United
[2:14:57] States of America to come to Calgary and
[2:14:59] to meet with me."
[2:15:02] You know the reason I'm saying about all
[2:15:04] the president of United States because
[2:15:06] they are powerful.
[2:15:08] And this man when he's traveling, I say
[2:15:11] 250 to 300 bodyguard.
[2:15:16] So when is in the hotel they will book
[2:15:19] the whole hotel they will move people
[2:15:21] out of the hotel for the one person
[2:15:24] security but now you ask God to say Lord
[2:15:29] I need 300 bodyguards
[2:15:33] with that man with all the air force one
[2:15:37] because he's not traveling with one air
[2:15:38] force he's traveling with two air force
[2:15:40] for security
[2:15:42] so they need to put gasoline on that to
[2:15:45] air force. They need to bring your
[2:15:48] government in trouble because when they
[2:15:50] coming, your government have to pay to
[2:15:53] organize security guard for that person
[2:15:56] to come in your country. And now you is
[2:15:58] your desire. Oh Lord,
[2:16:02] your desire.
[2:16:07] So I must meet that person.
[2:16:11] The lady say,
[2:16:13] "The Elijah of the Old Testament
[2:16:17] is the one I want to see today in my
[2:16:19] house."
[2:16:21] She was waiting for Elijah to come.
[2:16:25] Since 400 a.m. She wake up.
[2:16:29] She finished to pray and she was waiting
[2:16:32] for Elijah to come.
[2:16:34] Elijah was coming.
[2:16:37] But Elijah himself

[2:18:01] Last time I went to Dubai with my wife,
[2:18:05] people say, "Joshua, how did you meet
[2:18:07] the royal family?" I said, "No, I pray.
[2:18:11] I'm not going just Dubai to walk around.
[2:18:13] I want to meet the leader."
[2:18:17] They send me he is a CEO of the royal
[2:18:21] office. He's the one who received me to
[2:18:24] his office. I feel so happy. I say I was
[2:18:27] asking that I want to see him. So when I
[2:18:30] greet the man he say how are you? I say
[2:18:32] good what your name? My name is Joshua.

[2:18:36] government? I say no. Are you a
[2:18:38] minister? No.
[2:18:40] I'm just say Joshua brother.
[2:18:46] The prayer the faith can take you in the
[2:18:48] level people think you say you are a big
[2:18:51] man. I say yes I'm a more than big man.
[2:18:54] I'm a son of God.
[2:18:58] Brham say I didn't know because what's
[2:19:01] going on but because of her prayer
[2:19:06] but say okay what is your problem he say
[2:19:10] I was praying God so you must come here

[2:19:24] no are you a believer she said No. Did
[2:19:28] you hear but I am I praying for people I
[2:19:30] say nothing
[2:19:32] my responsibility
[2:19:35] to go to God say God I need something I
[2:19:40] don't know how you can bring it to me
[2:19:42] but which is what I need.
[2:19:46] Make your plan God. Do whatever you can
[2:19:49] do but my sight I just need the solution
[2:19:52] of my problem.
[2:19:56] When they finish to pray,
[2:19:59] brother Abraham say,
[2:20:01] "I know I already missed my plane.
[2:20:04] I know it's already over.
[2:20:07] So, I'm going to take the Uber to go
[2:20:12] back to the hotel, to take my stuff, to
[2:20:15] go to the airport."
[2:20:17] But I'm saying
[2:20:20] when he reached the airport
[2:20:25] they was making the last call
[2:20:29] for that airplane.
[2:20:30] Yes.
[2:20:32] The last call for Brana. Reverend Brown.
[2:20:35] Yes.
[2:20:36] Brother say
[2:20:40] everything was going on since the aand
[2:20:43] in the plan.
[2:20:46] The one who bring the thunderstorm,
[2:20:49] it was that girl.
[2:20:51] The one who put me to sleep in a big
[2:20:54] hotel, that prayer.
[2:20:57] The one who put me in a limo, that is
[2:21:00] the prayer of the lady.
[2:21:02] Even the one who keep the airplane in
[2:21:05] the ground,
[2:21:08] your prayer can change thing in the
[2:21:10] world.
[2:21:12] Your prayer can change your family.
[2:21:15] Your prayer can heal someone.
[2:21:22] Your prayer
[2:21:24] can change even your position at work.
[2:21:28] Your prayer can change the position
[2:21:31] at school.
[2:21:33] Your prayer can change the position of
[2:21:35] the church.
[2:21:37] If you pray,
[2:21:40] it's a promise
[2:21:44] to finish.
[2:21:46] Listen what the prophet said.
[2:21:49] The Lord give the promise.
[2:21:54] You pray,
[2:21:55] speak the words.
[2:21:59] Is my responsibility as a God to
[2:22:02] accomplish that.
[2:22:06] But the problem sometime we are so
[2:22:07] scared
[2:22:09] if I ask this the Lord will do that or
[2:22:11] not.
[2:22:13] But if you believe all things are
[2:22:16] possible,
[2:22:18] I will see the promise of God.
[2:22:21] He promised me a blessing. He promised
[2:22:24] me the Holy Spirit. He promised me the
[2:22:27] heaven. I will see the promise of God.
[2:22:33] Are you believe that? Amen.
[2:22:35] Let's stand up
[2:22:38] and ask God everything you never asked
[2:22:40] before.
[2:22:44] Don't ask things you asked before. No.
[2:22:48] Now today you need to ask God something
[2:22:52] you never ask him before.
[2:22:57] Things that you you know that
[2:22:59] impossible.
[2:23:02] Today we are 25th of August
[2:23:05] 2024.
[2:23:08] Now ask God something difficult
[2:23:12] that you know
[2:23:14] if it's happened it was the prayer you
[2:23:17] pray today.
[2:23:21] But I pray any song the spirit of God
[2:23:24] will tell you to pray. Play it and we
[2:23:26] want to pray.
[2:23:30] Remember that lady?
[2:23:33] She was just someone like you and me.
[2:23:37] She was not even a believer
[2:23:40] but you are.
[2:23:43] She never hear about the message but you
[2:23:46] know the message.
[2:23:48] She never believe in Branham the prophet
[2:23:51] of God but you believe that mean you are
[2:23:54] more than that lady.
[2:23:57] If she can pray
[2:24:00] to bring the thunderstorm
[2:24:04] to change
[2:24:06] the fline program,
[2:24:09] what about you?
[2:24:13] If her prayer can change things,
[2:24:17] what about your prayer? Daughter of
[2:24:20] Malachi 4,
[2:24:22] son of Malachi 4,
[2:24:24] your prayer is more powerful.
[2:24:28] Now I need you to pray.
[2:24:31] We will pray together.
[2:24:35] And we will ask God something you never
[2:24:37] asked before.
[2:24:39] So you remember that was the prayer
[2:24:42] asker in the church and he answer me.
[2:24:46] something difficult for you,
[2:24:50] something you will remember all entire
[2:24:52] life.
[2:24:54] Remember my picture in the car accident?
[2:24:59] He promised me I will be again in
[2:25:02] Calgary preaching the words
[2:25:06] and that was happening
[2:25:09] 2018.
[2:25:10] Amen.
[2:25:11] Today we are 2024
[2:25:14] and I'm still here preaching the gospel.
[2:25:19] What about you? What do you need from
[2:25:22] God?
[2:25:26] Let's close our eyes and we're going to
[2:25:28] pray.
[2:25:31] Brother, can you pray something?
[2:25:35] Amen.
[2:25:36] [Music]
[2:25:42] Oh Lord, we thank you.
[2:25:45] Thank you Lord.
[2:25:48] [Music]
[2:25:57] Now we can pray now. Let's pray together
[2:25:59] now. Lord, we thank you for your grace.
[2:26:03] Lord, we thank you for your grace.
[2:26:06] We thank you for your mercy Lord. I try
[2:26:09] my best Lord as a human being to bring
[2:26:11] my body as a sacrifice so you can use
[2:26:14] this body to speak to your children. Now
[2:26:17] I did my duty oh Lord. Now is your part
[2:26:21] to accomplish your words
[2:26:23] as you did with Simeon.
[2:26:26] You promise him and you accomplish also
[2:26:30] the promise.
[2:26:31] The same way with that lady in Mephis.
[2:26:35] She was praying to see the prophet of
[2:26:37] God.
[2:26:38] And you show her an vision and you
[2:26:42] accomplish what you promised her that
[2:26:44] you she will see Malachi 4, the prophet
[2:26:47] Elijah.
[2:26:49] And we also Lord, we have a things we
[2:26:53] need from you.
[2:26:54] And we pray Lord today our day.
[2:26:59] Even those who are streaming Lords,
[2:27:02] they need something Father. Even us in
[2:27:05] the church, we need something and we
[2:27:09] pray today Lord
[2:27:11] hear our voice
[2:27:14] I will see the promise of God
[2:27:19] as you promise Lord in the Bible
[2:27:22] everything we we ask by prayer
[2:27:26] you will accomplish that
[2:27:28] let us see the blessing of God
[2:27:32] baptize us with the Holy Ghost.
[2:27:35] Bring back the those people who forget
[2:27:38] the word of God.
[2:27:40] Bring them back
[2:27:42] to the body of Christ.
[2:27:45] [Music]
[2:27:46] Give us
[2:27:48] what is our heart desire.
[2:27:51] Heal your people, Lord.
[2:27:55] Bless your people, Lord.
[2:27:58] Comfort your people, Father.
[2:28:02] as you promise
[2:28:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:28:07] in our hearts
[2:28:09] and those who want to join you to become
[2:28:12] a true Christian
[2:28:14] to come back in the world
[2:28:16] to come back in the words to come back
[2:28:19] to you to follow you again. Make them
[2:28:24] strange lords. Give them strange lords.
[2:28:27] give them the power
[2:28:29] to stand up
[2:28:31] and to walk with you.
[2:28:33] As the prophet say, he feel that it was
[2:28:37] him and you walking together.
[2:28:41] And I pray Lord for the church.
[2:28:45] Let us walk together with you again. at
[2:28:48] work, at school, everywhere we go, let
[2:28:52] us walk again
[2:28:54] with you
[2:28:55] in our journey.
[2:28:57] And until we will see you in heaven as
[2:29:01] you promise,
[2:29:03] you got to prepare the place for us.
[2:29:06] Where you are, we will be. So to be with
[2:29:09] you in heaven
[2:29:10] is our joy, is our promise, and we
[2:29:14] believe in that promise.
[2:29:19] Bless our pastor.
[2:29:22] Bless all the ministers.
[2:29:24] Bless our brother and sisters.
[2:29:27] And how we prepare to go to the
[2:29:30] different place
[2:29:31] in our trips in a different place.
[2:29:35] Protect us Lord.
[2:29:38] Bless us in Jesus name.
[2:29:42] Amen.
[2:29:44] God bless you, brother Paul.
[2:29:47] You can come.
[2:29:49] Thank you. God bless you.
[2:29:53] [Applause]
[2:30:04] Amen. Thank you, brother Jose. Do I call
[2:30:06] you Joshua or Jose?
[2:30:08] Joshua.
[2:30:08] Joshua. I like Joshua. That's my
[2:30:11] God bless each one of you. We heard from
[2:30:13] the Lord this morning and each of us had
[2:30:16] a prayer before the Lord this morning
[2:30:17] that we haven't prayed before. So we'll
[2:30:19] just look to the Lord for a specific
[2:30:21] answer to those prayers. We I I just
[2:30:23] love the the thought of your position,
[2:30:26] knowing your position, that little ant
[2:30:28] that that Anchamima lady knew her
[2:30:30] position in Christ and she asked that
[2:30:32] that that promise came to her so
[2:30:34] specifically.
[2:30:36] I uh was listening to I forget which
[2:30:38] service. It was leadership yesterday and
[2:30:39] brother Rams on that note was talking
[2:30:42] about the uh about the story there.
[2:30:44] Sorry I forget the the story
[2:30:46] specifically but it was about leadership
[2:30:47] and just exactly how the Lord brought
[2:30:49] something to pass. Brother Josh Joshua I
[2:30:52] had a prayer a while ago and my wife
[2:30:54] knows the answer to this prayer. She
[2:30:56] knows that it's real. It was something
[2:30:57] really small. Just something really
[2:30:59] small. Just want to encourage you with
[2:31:00] brother what brother Joshua brought this
[2:31:02] morning and it was something Lord do you
[2:31:04] care about this? do you actually care
[2:31:06] that I would even ask this prayer? And I
[2:31:08] asked it and it happened within minutes.
[2:31:11] It was just and I said, Lord, that's
[2:31:13] just a vindication that you care for me.
[2:31:15] And I I I am not anything special. I'm
[2:31:18] just saying that the Lord answers
[2:31:19] prayer. What better butter preach this
[2:31:21] morning is true. I had something else
[2:31:23] happen this last week. The Lord
[2:31:24] specifically answered that. So prayer is
[2:31:28] powerful and and it has to come from a
[2:31:30] heart of of of humility and a heart that
[2:31:32] that it's not about you, but it's about
[2:31:34] the Lord just showing himself in your
[2:31:36] life. We've heard our pastor say, I
[2:31:38] believe it's it's I don't know if I'm
[2:31:39] going to say it right, but but the Lord
[2:31:41] vindicating himself back through your
[2:31:43] heart. So when it when he answers to
[2:31:45] you, then then it's real. Then you know
[2:31:47] it's the Lord between you and him. It's
[2:31:49] personal. Blessed be his name this
[2:31:51] morning. Well, let's let's finish with
[2:31:52] the song that our brother enjoyed so
[2:31:55] much and I enjoy. I that song actually
[2:31:57] came to me last night and I just many
[2:31:59] times say Lord I don't I don't deserve
[2:32:01] to be part of this but you by your grace
[2:32:04] sought me out and I'm so glad that I'm
[2:32:06] one of them. Let's sing it this this
[2:32:07] morning.
[2:32:09] Well there are people almost everywhere
[2:32:13] whose hearts are all of flame with the
[2:32:17] fire that fell at Pentecost which
[2:32:20] cleansed and made them clean. It is
[2:32:24] burning now within my heart. All glory
[2:32:28] to his name. I'm so glad I can say I'm
[2:32:33] one of them.
[2:32:35] I'm one of them.
[2:32:39] I'm one of them.
[2:32:42] Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[2:32:46] of them.
[2:32:48] I'm one of them.
[2:32:52] one of them.
[2:32:55] Oh Lord, I'm so glad that I can say I'm
[2:32:58] one of them.
[2:33:01] Though these people may not learn in me,
[2:33:05] nor boast of worldly fame. They have all
[2:33:09] received their Pentecost, baptized in
[2:33:12] Jesus' name, and are telling now both
[2:33:16] far and wide. His power is yet the same.
[2:33:20] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[2:33:24] them.
[2:33:26] I'm one of them.
[2:33:29] I'm one of them.
[2:33:32] Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[2:33:36] of them.
[2:33:39] I'm one of them.
[2:33:42] I'm one of them.
[2:33:45] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[2:33:49] them.
[2:33:51] They were gathered in the upper room all
[2:33:55] praying in his name. They were baptized
[2:33:59] with the Holy Ghost and powerful service
[2:34:03] came. Now what he did for them that day,
[2:34:07] he'll do for you the same. I'm so glad
[2:34:11] that I can say I'm one of them.
[2:34:16] Oh, I'm one of them.
[2:34:19] Oh, I'm one of them.
[2:34:22] Oh, I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[2:34:26] them.
[2:34:28] I'm one of them,
[2:34:31] Lord. I'm one of them.
[2:34:34] Oh, I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[2:34:38] them.
[2:34:41] Oh, come my brother. Seek this blessing
[2:34:44] that will cleanse your heart from sin.
[2:34:47] that will start the joy bells ringing
[2:34:50] and will keep your soul away. It is
[2:34:54] burning now within my heart. All glory
[2:34:58] to his name. I'm so glad I can say I'm
[2:35:02] one of them. God bless you. Oh, I'm one
[2:35:06] of them.
[2:35:08] I'm one of them.
[2:35:12] I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them.
[2:35:18] One day.
[2:35:21] I'm one day.
[2:35:24] I'm so glad I can say I'm one day.
[2:35:38] Jesus.
