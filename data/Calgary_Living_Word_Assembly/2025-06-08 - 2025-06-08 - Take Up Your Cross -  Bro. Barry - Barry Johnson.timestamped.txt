[52:20] [Music]
[52:38] I was walking down
[52:41] UK n land where the seed of Abraham
[52:47] poses that
[52:52] land. I saw old Caleb walking
[52:56] sweet by when he spoke. This was a fate
[53:02] I like to
[53:05] serve. Give me this mountain.
[53:09] I come to take
[53:11] it. You see this mountain is my
[53:18] inheritance. I heard God's
[53:21] prophet when he made the
[53:24] proise when I said amen. That mountain
[53:29] became mine.

[53:33] Now we are living in the end of days. We
[53:39] will send the evening light to hide
[53:44] away.

[54:16] from that
[54:19] proise. When I said amen, that mountain
[54:23] became
[54:26] [Music]
[54:32] Wow.
[54:37] [Music]
[54:56] And I'm faced in life with
[55:01] rage and the
[55:03] devil tried so hard to break my crown.
[55:11] I take the sword of God's
[55:14] unchanging world and I face the enemy to
[55:20] play my
[55:23] land. Give me this mountain. Give me
[55:26] this mountain. I've come to take in the
[55:29] name of Jesus. I

[56:22] said amen, that mountain be. If you say
[56:27] amen. If you say amen, that bouncing
[56:36] [Music]
[56:38] [Applause]
[56:48] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen, sisters. Wow. I
[56:53] thought it'd start a revival in your
[56:54] heart. If it doesn't in your feet and
[56:56] your hands, it certainly will in your
[56:57] heart. God bless you, sisters.
[56:58] Appreciate that so much. Brother Ernie,
[57:00] would you come?
[57:02] Amen. Hallelujah.
[57:15] God bless you. Just just a real honor
[57:18] and a privilege to be here this morning.
[57:20] Amen. And I cannot believe this. This is
[57:24] This is unreal. The last time we're
[57:25] here, there wasn't Was it here? Was it
[57:27] the other church? The other church.
[57:29] There wasn't that many people. But wow.
[57:32] Is there Is there any congreles in
[57:34] here? Whoa. You know, Brother DDA and
[57:37] Brother Christian
[57:38] Columba. I guess you listen to him
[57:41] singing on on he brother DD is our
[57:44] pastor. Uh we live in Washington
[57:47] State and
[57:50] um is it I have a very very unique
[57:55] testimony cuz sister Katie and myself
[57:58] were raised in a huttery colony and then
[58:02] we became hutter lefts cuz we
[58:05] left. So So anyway growing
[58:09] up we grew up well from five years old
[58:14] when you start you grow up actually in
[58:17] fear.
[58:18] [Music]
[58:20] old, no
[58:23] music. So that fear followed me for 55
[58:27] years.
[58:29] And at the age of 60, I was delivered
[58:32] from that fear. I would have never been
[58:33] able to come up here and do
[58:36] this. But no music at the
[58:41] colony.
[58:43] So the only thing you could really hide
[58:46] was a harmonica.
[58:49] But when they found it on me, I was
[58:52] whipped. I don't know how many times
[58:54] they took it away. I got another one and
[58:56] kept
[58:58] playing.
[59:01] And so, so here I am. I I played a
[59:04] harmonic. I after I give my testimony, I
[59:07] want to play a song for you. Brother
[59:10] Brandham, he said when you come over
[59:13] yonder, he says when you come up, he
[59:16] says you'll hear me singing on the top
[59:18] of my voice, amazing grace.
[59:21] [Applause]
[59:23] And then then he said, then you'll say,
[59:25] "Oh, brother Bill made it." So that is
[59:28] my testimony. But we all we all went
[59:32] through 2020. I guess the scan we call
[59:35] it a scandmic, right? Scandmic.
[59:40] So October the
[59:42] 2nd,
[59:44] 2020, I come home. It was a Friday. I
[59:47] come home from work and I felt really
[59:50] sick. Told my wife, you
[59:53] know, I can't go to church tonight.
[59:56] You'll have to go by yourself. So I
[59:58] stayed home and I started to throw up.
[1:00:01] By the following Wednesday, she took me
[1:00:03] into the hospital. They did an X-ray and
[1:00:06] said I had pneumonia.
[1:00:09] So they give me penicellin twice, but
[1:00:12] they give me the wrong
[1:00:14] penicellin. So I got sicker and sicker
[1:00:16] and sicker, just throwing up and
[1:00:18] throwing up. Like every time she would
[1:00:20] feed me with a dropper and and a
[1:00:23] blueberry, I would just throw it up. And
[1:00:26] then and that I lost 40
[1:00:29] pounds. And uh so anyway, by the 14th
[1:00:34] day on it was a Friday evening. It was a
[1:00:37] service and our nephew, brother Daryl
[1:00:40] Hoofer, some of you know him, he had
[1:00:43] written a song, cast the mamba in the
[1:00:46] fire, tell the devil he is a liar. And
[1:00:49] then turn up the heat and burn his
[1:00:51] deceit. And they kept singing that over
[1:00:54] and over. And I'm listening to that. I
[1:00:56] was very, very tired because my lungs
[1:00:58] were just totally given
[1:01:00] out. And from my oxygen was down to 83.
[1:01:05] And I was actually between life and
[1:01:07] death at that time. So I I am actually a
[1:01:10] walking miracle.
[1:01:13] [Applause]
[1:01:22] So I went to
[1:01:24] sleep and at 3:00 in the morning I was
[1:01:28] awakened and I'm standing beside the bed
[1:01:31] here and I'm looking at myself. I'm
[1:01:33] laying in the bed. I'm on my elbow and
[1:01:36] I'm looking out the window at 3:00 in
[1:01:38] the morning. It's usually black, but
[1:01:39] it's daylight
[1:01:42] outside. And as I'm as I'm laying there,
[1:01:45] this black sheet come flying over my
[1:01:48] shoulder and into the garbage
[1:01:50] can. I said, "Cast the mamba in the
[1:01:53] fire." At 3:00 in the afternoon, I told
[1:01:56] Sister Katie, "Come take this mamba, tie
[1:01:59] it up, and go back in the fire pit and
[1:02:01] burn it."
[1:02:02] And that's what she did. Amen. Then I
[1:02:05] knew that Satan could not take my life.
[1:02:10] Now, by the by the
[1:02:13] following Friday, I I I couldn't walk.
[1:02:17] So, I had two brothers come and and take
[1:02:19] me out of the bed, lift me in a chair,
[1:02:22] and rolled me out to the car. Sister T
[1:02:25] sister Katie hauled me to the
[1:02:28] hospital. So, they took me in. As soon
[1:02:31] as they put the
[1:02:32] oxygen, I I just completely
[1:02:36] revived. But I stayed in the hospital
[1:02:39] for 21
[1:02:41] days. And so what happened is at 1:30 in
[1:02:45] the
[1:02:46] morning by ambulance because the
[1:02:49] hospital that she took me at didn't have
[1:02:51] the facility. So the ambulance at 1:30
[1:02:54] in the morning hauled me to another
[1:02:56] hospital.
[1:02:58] So when when the attendants took me into
[1:03:03] the elevator, they pushed the floor. I
[1:03:05] didn't have a clue where I was going to
[1:03:06] land up. I landed up on the fifth floor.
[1:03:10] Grace, God's grace. That's all I had. I
[1:03:13] I can't say anything else. So they they
[1:03:16] put me in a room, put oxygen on me, put
[1:03:18] wires. You know, there won't be no wires
[1:03:20] in heaven, but I was full of them at
[1:03:22] that
[1:03:23] time. So next morning, I got up
[1:03:28] about probably quarter after 8 or
[1:03:31] something, they brought me breakfast and
[1:03:33] I was I was I was hungry because I
[1:03:35] hadn't eat for a long time. For the
[1:03:37] first time, I ate that breakfast and it
[1:03:40] stayed down.
[1:03:43] So,
[1:03:45] there's a big window there on the side
[1:03:46] of the of my bed where I was laying. And
[1:03:49] the building that was a flat building,
[1:03:51] and there was the metal flashing was
[1:03:53] going around the
[1:03:54] building. And uh and as I'm looking out,
[1:03:58] I see these two little birds hopping.
[1:04:01] They're hopping and they stop dead
[1:04:03] center in the middle of the window. And
[1:04:04] I'm looking at these birds. I could see
[1:04:06] their heads going like this. And I then
[1:04:10] I said, "That's turtle
[1:04:12] doves. They're couping. They're they're
[1:04:14] speaking to me." I couldn't hear them,
[1:04:16] but I knew the way they were going. And
[1:04:18] they were they were white. And they
[1:04:20] stayed there about 10 minutes. And when
[1:04:22] they flew up, I didn't see the third
[1:04:24] one. It was sitting down. And then unice
[1:04:26] and all three of them. Brother Brandham
[1:04:29] said, "Three is life."
[1:04:31] So then I knew for sure, Satan, you
[1:04:34] cannot take this life. Amen. There was
[1:04:37] such a presence that came into the room
[1:04:40] for two days. I just wept. I just wept.
[1:04:43] The Lord the Lord was so so it it was it
[1:04:46] was absolutely incredible. Amen. And
[1:04:48] then he gave me a song. He said, "When
[1:04:51] you come out of the hospital, you will
[1:04:53] sing this song with your fam family."
[1:04:55] And I don't sing, but when he tells you
[1:04:57] you sing, you
[1:05:00] sing. So here's the song. Satan tried to
[1:05:03] take my life through prayer. The answer
[1:05:06] was on the way. Three turtle doves so
[1:05:09] pure and white. A glorious victory was
[1:05:12] in sight. This bloodline Satan cannot
[1:05:15] cross. He was stopped by love divine.
[1:05:20] Doves came to lead this eagle home.
[1:05:24] Pure and clean, made fully whole. And
[1:05:28] here I stand. The Lord give me a brand
[1:05:31] new set of lungs.
[1:05:37] [Applause]
[1:05:39] So
[1:05:40] now now the the new lungs I'm
[1:05:44] unstoppable. I can play whatever
[1:05:46] anywhere whoever.
[1:05:49] So here I want to play in the key of G.
[1:05:52] I want to play Amazing Grace for you.
[1:05:54] Hallelujah.
[1:05:59] [Music]
[1:06:25] Heat. Heat.
[1:06:42] [Music]
[1:07:10] Amen.
[1:07:17] Hallelujah.

[1:08:43] faith as my desire to leave here and and

[1:16:15] certainly excited to see what the Lord
[1:16:17] will do on Friday. If you have a need
[1:16:20] this morning, maybe just make it known
[1:16:21] unto him by wave an uplift hand as we go
[1:16:24] to him in prayer. Gracious heavenly
[1:16:27] father, Lord Jesus, we know there's many
[1:16:30] hands raised in this building, Father,
[1:16:32] and maybe hands raised aar, Lord, people
[1:16:36] streaming or maybe watching later. We
[1:16:39] know you're not bound by time or space.
[1:16:40] And we thank you that you're that kind
[1:16:43] of a God. Amen. Even though we're
[1:16:46] trapped in time and space, you can be
[1:16:48] trapped. And Father, we're so thankful
[1:16:50] that we can call you our father and our
[1:16:52] God. Lord, we're so thankful that you're
[1:16:55] already here according to your word.
[1:16:58] Lord Jesus, we know that the devil comes
[1:17:01] to church. And Father, we're so thankful
[1:17:04] that this morning, as we heard our
[1:17:06] sisters sing, Lord, we have come
[1:17:08] desiring something today, Father. And
[1:17:10] Lord, if the devil has decided to come
[1:17:13] here today, let us remind him that he
[1:17:16] has no part in this service. We just
[1:17:19] rebuke him in Jesus name. And father,
[1:17:23] Lord Jesus, give us that mountain.
[1:17:26] Father, we have come here expecting one
[1:17:28] more time, Lord, that you would give us
[1:17:31] of our inheritance. That you would grant
[1:17:33] us that position in you. Father, help
[1:17:36] us, Lord, to hear what your spirit has
[1:17:39] to say. Father, help us to tune out the
[1:17:41] things of this world and to open our
[1:17:44] ears and our hearts, Lord, further unto
[1:17:46] you, Lord, that we could be more like
[1:17:49] you, Lord. Oh, Father, that as we
[1:17:52] already heard our brother say, that we
[1:17:54] could manifest a life worthy of this
[1:17:56] gospel. Oh, Father, not us, but you
[1:17:59] through us, Lord Jesus. Amen. Help us to
[1:18:03] die out to ourselves today, Father. Oh
[1:18:06] Lord, that you might live.
[1:18:09] Father, we just want to commit the needs
[1:18:10] that were made known unto you today by
[1:18:12] the way of an uplift hand, Lord. Father,
[1:18:15] we want to remember brother Peter Hoffer
[1:18:17] in front of your throne this morning,
[1:18:19] Lord. Thank you for his life. Thank you
[1:18:21] for this situation and this opportunity
[1:18:24] for your goodness and tender mercies to
[1:18:26] come through. Lord, we know that you
[1:18:29] actually gave us a dual covenant, Lord.
[1:18:31] Not just for salvation, but for healing.
[1:18:33] Before you gave your life, oh, Father,
[1:18:36] you gave 39 stripes so that we could be
[1:18:39] healed in this flesh. Lord, we're not
[1:18:41] looking for healing in the millennium.
[1:18:43] We're looking for it now. And Lord, we
[1:18:46] just take you at your word. Amen. So,
[1:18:48] thank you for touching Brother Peter in
[1:18:50] the name of Jesus. Father, each and
[1:18:52] every need, we just commit them into
[1:18:54] your hands now for your glory. We love
[1:18:56] you and we thank you. We just ask all
[1:18:58] these things now in Jesus Christ's name
[1:19:01] we pray.
[1:19:03] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:06] Amen. This morning, if you uh want to
[1:19:10] just take your seats for a minute, I'm
[1:19:12] going to keep the musicians here. We're
[1:19:13] going to do something a little different
[1:19:14] today. And boy, I just feel nervous.
[1:19:18] And certainly thankful for the
[1:19:21] leadership of the Lord in in our lives.
[1:19:24] And uh this morning, as we have already
[1:19:26] heard, this is going to be the last
[1:19:28] service
[1:19:30] uh with Sister Rebecca Odolene. Is that
[1:19:33] right? It's the last service we're going
[1:19:36] to have with her. And uh for the right
[1:19:39] reasons, she's actually engaged to be
[1:19:42] married in
[1:19:44] Nigeria to a brother named Victor Yumok.
[1:19:48] And I believe that next time we see her,
[1:19:51] that will be her name. Sister Rebecca
[1:19:54] Yumok. And we want to maybe practice
[1:19:57] that a little bit so we get that right
[1:19:58] when we see her next. But you know, to
[1:20:02] hear that the Lord has moved in this
[1:20:04] kind of a way, it's it's an answer to
[1:20:07] our prayer. And I I think it's so
[1:20:10] important to make sure that we give
[1:20:12] credit where it's due. Amen. We could
[1:20:15] say that we did something on our own,
[1:20:17] but to know that God has moved on the
[1:20:20] scene.
[1:20:21] I just want to read a quote. I'll tell
[1:20:24] you what I plan to do here and then you
[1:20:27] don't have to get nervous so you know
[1:20:28] kind of what I'm thinking. I would like
[1:20:30] to invite Sister Rebecca to the front
[1:20:34] and we'll just pray as a congregation
[1:20:36] for
[1:20:37] her. We can't go to Nigeria. Some of us,
[1:20:42] most of us in fact can't go to celebrate
[1:20:44] this wedding. So I just wanted to give
[1:20:47] us a little bit of an opportunity here
[1:20:49] today. Amen. just to wish God's richest
[1:20:52] blessings upon her
[1:20:55] spiritually,
[1:20:56] naturally, physically, every single type
[1:21:00] of blessing that is available to her. I
[1:21:03] just want to read a quote out of the
[1:21:05] marriage of the lamb in
[1:21:07] 1962. Brother Brandham says, "Now
[1:21:09] marriage in one sense is a type. The
[1:21:13] earthly marriage here is a type of the
[1:21:16] heavenly marriage." Now let's go over it
[1:21:19] just for a few moments to rehearse it a
[1:21:22] moment. The first thing there is there
[1:21:26] must be a decision made. Amen. The first
[1:21:30] thing takes in natural marriage is a
[1:21:33] decision has to be
[1:21:35] made. The young lady has to make her
[1:21:38] decision whether she wants this young
[1:21:41] man and the young man whether he wants
[1:21:45] the young woman. There has to be a
[1:21:47] decision made and you have to make
[1:21:50] it. She has to be the only woman in the
[1:21:54] world that you love and he must be the
[1:21:57] only
[1:21:58] man. If it isn't, then you made a wrong
[1:22:03] decision. And that's the same way it is
[1:22:06] by making the decision for Christ.
[1:22:10] The first thing you have to do is make
[1:22:13] up your mind whether you're going to
[1:22:15] serve him and take him as your savior.
[1:22:19] Amen. Or you're not going to do it.
[1:22:22] There's no part way. And you know, the
[1:22:25] worst thing that could ever happen in a
[1:22:27] marriage is to go part way. And we know
[1:22:31] that's what happens naturally in this
[1:22:32] world. People say we can just try it and
[1:22:36] if it doesn't work, we can just get
[1:22:38] divorced and we can move
[1:22:40] on. Aren't you thankful that Christ will
[1:22:43] never divorce his bride?
[1:22:47] He will never put his bride away. If
[1:22:49] that was the case, she would already be
[1:22:52] put away.
[1:22:54] The first thing you have to do is make
[1:22:56] up your mind whether you're going to
[1:22:58] serve God and take him as your savior or
[1:23:01] you're not going to do it. Are you going
[1:23:04] to serve the world? Are you going to
[1:23:07] serve Christ? You have to make up your
[1:23:10] mind. There has to be a decision made.
[1:23:13] When you make up your mind that you're
[1:23:15] going to serve God or mammon, then you
[1:23:18] take your choice. But the decision has
[1:23:21] been made.
[1:23:23] And then after the decision is made that
[1:23:26] you
[1:23:27] are, then comes the
[1:23:29] engagement that you find that at the
[1:23:32] altar. You've got to make an engagement
[1:23:34] before this union can be. And that's the
[1:23:37] way it is with Christ's church. It has
[1:23:39] to be an engagement with Christ, a
[1:23:43] pledge, an engagement, a love affair.
[1:23:46] And then the next thing is promises
[1:23:48] made. There has to be promises made to
[1:23:50] one another like that. You make promise,
[1:23:52] sweetheart, if you'll marry me, I
[1:23:54] promise that I'll be loyal and true. I
[1:23:57] will look upon no other woman or I'll
[1:23:59] look upon no other man. And I'll do all
[1:24:05] that as a duty as a
[1:24:07] wife. We have children. It'll do all as
[1:24:11] a duty as a mother. I'll be a
[1:24:14] housekeeper. All these promises has got
[1:24:16] to be made or should be in a correct
[1:24:20] wedding. Amen. And that's the same thing
[1:24:23] when you come to Christ. Lord, if you
[1:24:26] will receive me into your kingdom, I
[1:24:29] promise there you are. I'll love you.
[1:24:33] I'll be true to you. I'll serve you day
[1:24:37] and night. It's too bad we forget that.
[1:24:40] I'll serve you day and night. I'll fast.
[1:24:45] I'll pray. I'll be loyal to you. I'll
[1:24:46] bring my tithes into the storehouse.
[1:24:48] I'll pray many times a day. I'll do
[1:24:50] anything and I'll pledge all my love to
[1:24:52] you. That's what you should do. That's
[1:24:56] exactly right where you promised that
[1:24:58] and it should come from your heart.
[1:25:03] That's the prophet's words out of the
[1:25:06] marriage of the lamb. So, if you don't
[1:25:07] mind, maybe stand with me. I want to
[1:25:09] invite the Odelene sisters to come.
[1:25:11] Sister Rebecca, we're just going to pray
[1:25:14] for you. And you know, I I'm going to
[1:25:16] say this. Anyone else that feels led, if
[1:25:18] you want to come and pray with us,
[1:25:20] you're more than welcome to. Some might
[1:25:22] be getting nervous. This is a little bit
[1:25:24] out of order, but sometimes I think it's
[1:25:26] good to get a little bit out of order.
[1:25:27] Let's get out of our comfort zones.
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:33] Yeah. Come on up, sisters.
[1:25:37] [Music]
[1:25:47] All right, we have some more people
[1:25:49] coming.
[1:25:55] Amen. Yeah, come on up if you want to.
[1:25:58] Don't be bashful. This might be the last
[1:26:00] time you get to pray with Sister Rebecca
[1:26:02] here on this
[1:26:04] side. Let's just pray. Gracious heavenly
[1:26:08] father, Lord Jesus, this morning. We are
[1:26:10] truly honored and privileged, Lord, to
[1:26:12] stand in your presence, Lord, with your
[1:26:15] daughter. Father, we're so thankful for
[1:26:17] her testimony, Lord Jesus, of her life
[1:26:20] here in this assembly, Lord. I remember
[1:26:23] back to when she was here with her
[1:26:25] parents, Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, and
[1:26:28] you've seen fit since then to take both
[1:26:30] of her parents home, Lord. Father, now
[1:26:33] you've granted her the desire of her
[1:26:35] heart, Lord Jesus, to go on and become a
[1:26:38] wife, Father. Lord Jesus, what an honor,
[1:26:42] Father, we pray that you would just
[1:26:44] bless her abundantly, Father, that you
[1:26:47] would grant her, continue granting her
[1:26:49] the desires of her heart, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:51] Father, that she would just be a good
[1:26:53] wife to her husband and that her husband
[1:26:55] would be a strong leader, oh, Father,
[1:26:57] not naturally, but spiritually and
[1:27:00] naturally, Lord. Father, we're so
[1:27:02] thankful for the pattern that you've
[1:27:03] given us in your word, Lord Jesus. We
[1:27:06] have a direction. We have leadership,
[1:27:08] Lord. Oh, Father. And we pray that
[1:27:10] Sister Rebecca and Brother Victor would
[1:27:12] just keep you first in their life every
[1:27:14] day of their lives, Lord. That their
[1:27:17] marriage would be centered around you,
[1:27:18] Father. And Lord, if it be your will for
[1:27:21] them to have children, Father, that you
[1:27:23] would grant it to them in the name of
[1:27:25] Jesus Christ. Oh, Father, and that they
[1:27:27] would raise them in the fear and the
[1:27:29] admonition of you, Lord, if you should
[1:27:31] terry, Father, we're so thankful for
[1:27:34] Sister Rebecca's life and her testimony
[1:27:36] and the gifts you've placed in there. We
[1:27:38] pray that you would just keep your hand
[1:27:39] upon her as she travels, Lord, every
[1:27:42] single day of her life. And Father,
[1:27:44] we'll be careful to give you the praise
[1:27:46] when we hear the testimony after the
[1:27:48] wedding. Bless their wedding. Bless
[1:27:50] their ceremony. Bless the church they
[1:27:52] will attend, Father. And Lord, we pray
[1:27:54] for their sisters, Lord. Her sisters
[1:27:56] here in Calgary. They'll miss her, Lord.
[1:27:58] Oh, Father, the body here will miss her,
[1:28:00] Father. But we're so thankful for your
[1:28:03] goodness to us, Lord. We just pray,
[1:28:05] Lord, we ask all these things now. In
[1:28:08] Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:28:11] Amen. Amen. And as a body here, we just
[1:28:15] like to present you with this as a
[1:28:16] wedding gift, a token of our
[1:28:18] appreciation to you,
[1:28:21] [Applause]
[1:28:34] [Music]
[1:28:36] sister of your wisdom.
[1:28:41] Who can
[1:28:43] fathom the depths of your
[1:28:48] love? You are beautiful
[1:28:52] beyond
[1:28:55] description. Oh
[1:28:58] majesty enthrone.
[1:29:01] [Music]
[1:29:04] Oh, I
[1:29:06] stand I
[1:29:08] stand in all of
[1:29:11] you. I
[1:29:13] stand I
[1:29:15] stand in love
[1:29:21] you
[1:29:23] to all praisees.
[1:29:29] standing
[1:29:32] on you.
[1:29:35] Amen.
[1:29:38] Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[1:29:41] Today, just a
[1:29:43] wonderful, wonderful day. You have your
[1:29:46] Bibles. I'd like to take a scripture out
[1:29:49] of St. Luke chapter
[1:29:56] 8. Actually, sorry. St. Luke chapter
[1:30:01] 9. Isn't he wonderful?
[1:30:12] St. Luke chapter 9, we'll start reading
[1:30:15] with verse
[1:30:18] 23. A very familiar
[1:30:21] scripture once again. And he said unto
[1:30:25] them
[1:30:26] all, "If any man will come after me, let
[1:30:29] him deny
[1:30:31] himself and take up his cross
[1:30:34] daily and follow
[1:30:37] me." Let's just bow one more
[1:30:39] time. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful
[1:30:42] for your word. Thank you for this
[1:30:44] opportunity, Lord, to gather together in
[1:30:47] your name. We know that it's your only
[1:30:49] provided place of worship in this age in
[1:30:53] which we live. And Father, we don't take
[1:30:54] it
[1:30:55] lightly. And as we approach the highest
[1:30:58] order of the service, Father, we just
[1:31:00] invite you to have the preeminence,
[1:31:03] Father, and minister to us words of life
[1:31:06] once again. Help us, Lord Jesus, to die
[1:31:10] to oursel and to take up your cross and
[1:31:13] to follow you. We just ask all these
[1:31:16] things in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:31:18] Amen. I bless you this morning. You may
[1:31:20] be
[1:31:23] seated. I just got really inspired by
[1:31:27] this this
[1:31:29] thought. Um and so I thought we would go
[1:31:34] with it and just see what the Lord has
[1:31:36] to say. Are you happy this morning?
[1:31:41] Verse 23 says, "And he said to them all,
[1:31:43] if he any man will come after me, let
[1:31:46] him deny himself and take up his cross
[1:31:49] daily and follow
[1:31:50] me. For whosoever will save his life
[1:31:53] shall lose it. But whosoever will lose
[1:31:56] his life for my sake, the same shall
[1:31:59] save
[1:32:00] it? For what is a man advantaged if he
[1:32:04] gain the whole
[1:32:06] world and lose
[1:32:09] himself or be cast
[1:32:12] away? Isn't that an interesting
[1:32:14] scripture
[1:32:16] there? When you hear something like that
[1:32:18] in the word, it means that it's possible
[1:32:21] for a
[1:32:23] man, I would say, or a woman to lose
[1:32:26] themselves.
[1:32:28] What does that
[1:32:30] mean? I would think that it would mean
[1:32:34] giving over to something other than the
[1:32:36] word of God. Giving over to anything
[1:32:39] other than the word of
[1:32:44] God. If a man would lose himself but
[1:32:47] gain the whole world,
[1:32:50] my we know Jesus was tempted one day to
[1:32:54] gain the whole world. The word says that
[1:32:57] he was tempted, but he knew it wasn't
[1:33:00] the right way. And it's the same thing
[1:33:02] for us. We could be tempted to gain what
[1:33:07] we might perceive to be the whole world,
[1:33:10] but is it going to take us towards the
[1:33:14] cross? Is it going to take us in the
[1:33:16] direction that we need to be going? or
[1:33:18] is it going to become a major
[1:33:20] distraction and consuming to our very
[1:33:24] soul at a place where we lose
[1:33:27] ourselves? Because the way we interact
[1:33:30] with the world, we don't interact
[1:33:33] anymore the way that maybe we would have
[1:33:35] once upon a time before we got into
[1:33:38] whatever it is. Sometimes we can have so
[1:33:42] much pressure in our life from business
[1:33:45] or from
[1:33:46] relationships or from employment or the
[1:33:50] worst one of all is
[1:33:53] money. The love of money is the root of
[1:33:56] all
[1:33:57] evil. Money is only a tool. That's all
[1:34:01] it is. If it's anything else, we've got
[1:34:04] it wrong.
[1:34:07] But how easy it could be to gain what we
[1:34:11] might perceive to be the whole world.
[1:34:13] That thing that we just pine away for.
[1:34:15] Oh, if I just had that one thing, if I
[1:34:18] could just get to this one place, if I
[1:34:21] could just reach that one number of
[1:34:23] investment, then I know that all all of
[1:34:25] my my pastures would be green and I
[1:34:28] would be set. I'd have it made. I could
[1:34:31] retire at 55. Freedom 55. How many knows
[1:34:35] Freedom
[1:34:36] 55? When I was growing up, that was the
[1:34:39] the commercials on the television.
[1:34:40] Freedom 55. I don't know what the
[1:34:42] company was. So, they failed. I can't
[1:34:45] remember the name of the company, but
[1:34:47] you know, everybody had talked about
[1:34:49] that. For me, that would be two years
[1:34:51] and I would be retiring. And you know, I
[1:34:54] can't imagine what would happen if
[1:34:55] someone retires. What do you do when you
[1:34:57] retire? Sit around and and do nothing. I
[1:35:01] could never do that.
[1:35:04] And if anybody has ever wondered, I've
[1:35:06] talked to people and they've said, you
[1:35:07] know, why do you have so many interests?
[1:35:09] You got so many different things that
[1:35:11] you're into. And and it clicked for me
[1:35:13] this week. I was having a conversation
[1:35:14] last weekend. Actually, Brother Jason
[1:35:16] and I were talking about it and and I
[1:35:18] couldn't really I was like, really, why
[1:35:20] do I? Because it feels like sometimes I
[1:35:22] have so many different interests. I
[1:35:23] can't really focus on anything. I I'm
[1:35:26] good at a lot of things, but not really
[1:35:27] spectacular at
[1:35:29] any. But, you know, it just came to me.
[1:35:32] I believe the Lord said it in another
[1:35:34] conversation. It's amazing how the Lord
[1:35:36] talks to you, isn't it? He speaks
[1:35:39] through people.
[1:35:41] Idle minds are the devil's workshop.
[1:35:44] Idle hands are the devil's workshop.
[1:35:46] We've heard that said. That's not
[1:35:47] scripture, but that's that's a saying in
[1:35:49] the world that we've heard many times.
[1:35:51] And and it clicked for me. That's why I
[1:35:53] like to keep busy. If we sit around and
[1:35:56] do nothing, the devil is going to do
[1:35:58] something.
[1:36:00] We need to keep ourselves busy. But how
[1:36:03] quickly we could get swept away with
[1:36:04] these things that we feel like are so
[1:36:07] important and that the world portrays
[1:36:10] that are so important. You have to have
[1:36:12] your portfolio all together there. And
[1:36:14] if you don't if you don't achieve a
[1:36:17] certain level of investment, then you're
[1:36:19] going to
[1:36:20] fail. Meanwhile, where's our children?
[1:36:25] Do our children know that we love them?
[1:36:28] Amen.
[1:36:29] Are we taking the time to invest our
[1:36:31] time in our children? I've seen it in
[1:36:33] the world. I've known some very wealthy
[1:36:36] people, very wealthy people whose
[1:36:38] children lack for nothing right here in
[1:36:41] the city of Calgary. And you know what?
[1:36:43] Those children
[1:36:45] are and and they're not wanting anymore
[1:36:48] because they're adults. But the thing
[1:36:50] that they wanted when they really needed
[1:36:53] it, they couldn't have it because daddy
[1:36:57] wasn't available. He was never
[1:37:00] around, but he always had lots of money
[1:37:02] for them. They had lots of entitlement
[1:37:04] to go and do things and go places and
[1:37:07] experience things and big screens and
[1:37:10] games and bikes and toys and all manner
[1:37:13] of things when really the only thing
[1:37:14] they ever wanted was daddy. That's all
[1:37:17] they wanted. They would have traded all
[1:37:18] of it for daddy. But, you know, we come
[1:37:20] to a place in our life where now we're
[1:37:23] actually past that
[1:37:26] point. But what happens at that
[1:37:29] point? Sometimes, not all the time, but
[1:37:32] sometimes those children now become
[1:37:35] adults
[1:37:36] striving to seek daddy's
[1:37:40] approval, striving to achieve to the
[1:37:43] level where daddy would want them to
[1:37:47] be. It's it's amazing. I I just can't
[1:37:50] help but think that might be one example
[1:37:51] of how a man whosoever will lose his
[1:37:56] life for my sake. The same shall save
[1:37:58] it. We can find ourselves in a in a in a
[1:38:02] position if we're not willing to lose
[1:38:04] oursel for his sake. We're we're going
[1:38:07] after the whole world and we'll lose
[1:38:10] ourselves or potentially be cast away.
[1:38:12] Verse 26 says, "For whosoever shall be
[1:38:16] ashamed of me and of my
[1:38:19] words, of him shall the Son of Man be
[1:38:22] ashamed, when he shall come in his own
[1:38:24] glory and in his fathers, and of the
[1:38:28] holy
[1:38:29] angels. But I tell you of a truth. There
[1:38:32] shall be some standing here which shall
[1:38:34] not taste of death till they see the
[1:38:37] kingdom of God."
[1:38:39] I want to say this this morning,
[1:38:40] brothers and sisters. If you have an ear
[1:38:43] to hear, you you actually have seen the
[1:38:46] kingdom of God this morning.
[1:38:49] This is the kingdom of God. Because
[1:38:50] where is the kingdom of God? It's
[1:38:52] within. It's not this church building.
[1:38:55] Don't come to Calgary Living Word and
[1:38:56] think you're going to find the kingdom
[1:38:57] of God inside this building. He's not in
[1:39:00] here. He's in you. He's in me. We bring
[1:39:02] him with us wherever we go. That's the
[1:39:06] kingdom. Today I want to talk about take
[1:39:09] up your
[1:39:10] cross, take up your
[1:39:14] cross. If any man will come after me,
[1:39:17] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:39:20] cross daily and follow me. You know,
[1:39:22] this scripture I think could be like a I
[1:39:24] I say it many times, a a fridge a fridge
[1:39:28] scripture or a maybe a bathroom mirror
[1:39:30] scripture, something that we would look
[1:39:31] at every single day because it it really
[1:39:34] has it all together there, doesn't it?
[1:39:37] repent, get baptized, and follow the
[1:39:40] Lord. Just live our lives according to
[1:39:42] his word. But if a man wants to take up
[1:39:46] his cross and follow him, but is not
[1:39:50] willing to deny himself, is he really
[1:39:53] following
[1:39:54] him? We have got to be willing to deny
[1:39:57] ourselves if we're going to take up our
[1:39:59] cross. There's no way that we can
[1:40:01] actually take up the cross without
[1:40:03] denying ourselves. Sometimes we can be
[1:40:06] taught that going to church can give us
[1:40:07] that ability to take up our cross
[1:40:10] because we're going to church. We're
[1:40:11] getting out of bed and we're sacrificing
[1:40:12] and going across the city. And sure
[1:40:13] enough, it is actually a sacrifice to do
[1:40:18] that. But just getting to church ain't
[1:40:21] enough. You got to get to Christ. We
[1:40:24] have got to get to Jesus Christ. And the
[1:40:27] only way that we can do that is to take
[1:40:28] him at his word. I just think this
[1:40:31] scripture I'm going to say it a few
[1:40:32] times because I want us to really think
[1:40:34] about it here. He said unto them
[1:40:39] all. It wasn't just to some. It wasn't
[1:40:43] just to the elect. It was to
[1:40:46] everybody. All of them. If any man will
[1:40:50] come after me, let him deny
[1:40:53] himself, take up his cross
[1:40:58] daily, and follow me. You know, cross is
[1:41:02] the
[1:41:04] G4716. It's pronounced stoos out of the
[1:41:09] concordance. It's from the base 2476. A
[1:41:13] stake or a post as set
[1:41:15] upright, i.e. specifically specially
[1:41:19] sorry a pole or
[1:41:21] cross as an instrument of capital
[1:41:24] punishment and that's what we all know
[1:41:26] it as the cross I think it's really
[1:41:28] interesting when you look at the world
[1:41:30] and the people might who might not
[1:41:31] believe in Christianity and they might
[1:41:33] not really believe in in Jesus Christ I
[1:41:36] mean they might know the name and
[1:41:38] acknowledge it that way but typically
[1:41:40] what happens is they wind up going to a
[1:41:43] cemetery a graveyard and and usually
[1:41:45] there's some kind of a
[1:41:46] cross implemented to remember that
[1:41:49] person. It's kind of interesting how
[1:41:51] that is even people that don't believe.
[1:41:54] But really that cross is it's it's
[1:41:57] designed to be a pole or a cross. This
[1:41:59] is what the word means in the scripture
[1:42:01] here. A pole or a cross is an instrument
[1:42:02] of capital punishment. A and
[1:42:05] figuratively this is where I believe it
[1:42:08] comes in for us. It's an exposure to
[1:42:11] death i.e.
[1:42:14] self-denial by implication, the
[1:42:16] atonement of Christ at the cross. And
[1:42:19] you know, to think about what Christ had
[1:42:22] to bear in in carrying that cross. I
[1:42:26] I've unfortunately seen a lot of movies
[1:42:28] and read a lot of books and I've heard
[1:42:31] stories about people that are going to
[1:42:32] die and the bad guy says, "Dig a hole
[1:42:35] because they're going to bury them
[1:42:37] there." And and I've often thought, why
[1:42:39] would a man do that? I wouldn't dig a
[1:42:41] hole. If you're gonna kill me, kill me.
[1:42:44] You dig the
[1:42:46] hole. I'm not doing the
[1:42:48] work. And you know, it sounds funny and
[1:42:51] I I mean it to be a little bit
[1:42:52] light-hearted that way, but uh just for
[1:42:54] the comparison, why would Christ bear
[1:42:57] that
[1:42:58] cross? He didn't deserve
[1:43:01] it. But yet, he did with all of his
[1:43:04] might because he recognized if he didn't
[1:43:06] do it, no one would.
[1:43:09] But you know, for us to say that he is
[1:43:11] our Lord, he is our leader. What a fa
[1:43:14] fantastic leader. You couldn't ask for a
[1:43:16] better leader. Someone who is whipped
[1:43:18] just about to death. Picking up the
[1:43:21] cross and saying, "This is how you live
[1:43:24] a Christian life. When it hurts the
[1:43:26] most, when you don't feel like it the
[1:43:28] most, when it's the most painful,
[1:43:31] painstaking thing you could ever do,
[1:43:33] pick it up and
[1:43:36] walk. and he'll bless you.
[1:43:40] But if we're not willing to do that, if
[1:43:42] we're just going to play safe and say,
[1:43:43] "Oh, I've got a little bit of pain. I'm
[1:43:45] not going to do it. I'm not going to go
[1:43:46] to church because I don't like the way
[1:43:48] that brother did that or the way that
[1:43:49] pastor said that or or didn't say that.
[1:43:51] Oh my, he didn't do that thing or he did
[1:43:55] that thing. If we're just going to run
[1:43:56] away and not come to church because of
[1:43:58] that, what does that say to Christ?"
[1:44:02] You know, brothers and sisters, I want
[1:44:03] to say this. This is brother Barry here
[1:44:05] and I'm sorry, but I'm I I am sorry
[1:44:08] because I don't want to say it to our
[1:44:09] visitors and and so on, but I think it's
[1:44:11] important to say it. You know what? I I
[1:44:13] I have so much respect for someone
[1:44:16] that's going to leave a church that
[1:44:17] would call brother Barry, call the
[1:44:20] pastor and and say, "The Lord is leading
[1:44:22] me this way, and will you pray for me?
[1:44:24] This is what's going to happen. I I just
[1:44:26] feel led this way." And and you can pray
[1:44:28] together. Or you could say, "We just
[1:44:30] want to seek the mind of the Lord for
[1:44:31] our brother, for our sister, that his
[1:44:33] blessings would pour out." If God wants
[1:44:34] someone to move somewhere and do
[1:44:36] something, wouldn't we want that for
[1:44:38] them?
[1:44:39] Yes.
[1:44:41] But so many times you see people just
[1:44:45] vanish. And if you call them and you
[1:44:47] say, "What's up, man?" Well, I'm just
[1:44:50] led.
[1:44:52] Okay. I thought we were a family. Right.
[1:44:56] Right.
[1:44:58] to be able to take the time and say,
[1:45:00] "God bless you, and we we want to pray
[1:45:02] together as a body for you because we
[1:45:04] love you. Even if you don't love us
[1:45:07] anymore, we still love you and we just
[1:45:09] wish that God would continue to bless
[1:45:11] you." But how do you get that
[1:45:13] opportunity if someone runs away? I
[1:45:16] don't know. Is it carrying the cross? Is
[1:45:18] it packing the pain? Or is it running
[1:45:21] from it?
[1:45:23] I think it's very important and I have
[1:45:25] tons of respect for that to be able to
[1:45:27] say that that's the leadership of the
[1:45:29] Lord in my life, in my family, in my
[1:45:31] home. Will we pray together? It's just
[1:45:34] beautiful. And 1964 questions and
[1:45:37] answers. Brother Brham, he he talks
[1:45:39] about this and I I just believe this is
[1:45:41] part of our our discussion today and it
[1:45:44] might seem like a little bit of a
[1:45:45] tangent, but Lord willing hopefully
[1:45:46] we'll bring it back around again. 1964
[1:45:49] in questions and answers number two,
[1:45:50] brother Brandham, he talks about the
[1:45:52] prophet's reward and and I just think
[1:45:55] how this scripture is he he said to them
[1:45:58] all if any man will come after me let
[1:46:00] him deny himself take up his cross daily
[1:46:02] and follow me when we look at this
[1:46:04] scripture here all of the world can look
[1:46:06] at the scripture here and say the exact
[1:46:08] same thing yeah sure if if I do that
[1:46:10] then then I repent and I get baptized
[1:46:12] and and
[1:46:13] and for the remission of my sins in the
[1:46:15] name of the father son and the holy
[1:46:16] ghost and I carry on. And you know what?
[1:46:18] I follow him. I pick up my cross every
[1:46:20] single day and I follow him. But are are
[1:46:22] are the people really encapsulating the
[1:46:25] gift that we have to this age? And you
[1:46:27] know, this is a message church. We'll
[1:46:29] call it that. We follow the teachings of
[1:46:31] William, Mary, and Brandham. But he
[1:46:33] pointed to Jesus Christ.
[1:46:36] But how are you ever going to get to
[1:46:37] Jesus Christ without the voice of a
[1:46:40] vindicated prophet? Without the
[1:46:42] instruction of the Lord for your
[1:46:45] age. 1964. Brother Brandham says this in
[1:46:48] questions and answers numbers two.
[1:46:50] Brother Brandham, if you have time,
[1:46:53] please explain Matthew
[1:46:55] 10:41. I would like to know what is a
[1:46:59] prophet's
[1:47:02] reward. Well, now Jesus said, "Whosoever
[1:47:06] receive a prophet in the name of a
[1:47:07] prophet receives a prophet's
[1:47:10] reward." A prophet's
[1:47:13] reward is to be a friend with the
[1:47:15] prophet.
[1:47:16] Isn't that beautiful?
[1:47:19] Is to be a friend with the
[1:47:21] prophet. Whosoever receives a righteous
[1:47:24] man in the name of a righteous man
[1:47:25] receives a righteous man's reward. Is
[1:47:27] that
[1:47:28] right? And if they want to know what a
[1:47:31] prophet's reward is, is to be a friend
[1:47:35] to that prophet. See, that's a reward.
[1:47:39] He's your
[1:47:40] friend. Like the Shudomite woman. Uhoh.
[1:47:46] Here we go.
[1:47:48] Take up your cross and follow me.
[1:47:50] Brothers and sisters, think about that
[1:47:52] Shounomite woman. That Shounomite woman,
[1:47:57] we just preached about her, but there
[1:47:58] was something special about her. She had
[1:48:02] all of her investments, all that she had
[1:48:06] left to her name. She was ready to go
[1:48:08] and die, was her words to the prophet.
[1:48:12] And what did the prophet said? just go
[1:48:14] bake me a cake first. Amen. Can you
[1:48:17] imagine the brazeness of that man? How
[1:48:20] how the talk of the town must have been?
[1:48:22] Who is this guy? The Shunomite woman.
[1:48:24] She's a poor widow woman. And here he
[1:48:26] comes boastfully saying, "Just take all
[1:48:28] you got and give it to me."
[1:48:34] But she had something inside her to hear
[1:48:36] the voice of a vindicated prophet in her
[1:48:38] day.
[1:48:39] And we know, we went over it, that the
[1:48:41] Lord was directing both of them on both
[1:48:43] ends. He directed Elijah and he directed
[1:48:45] her. She said he told her to get ready
[1:48:48] because the prophet's coming your way
[1:48:50] and told the prophet to go down there
[1:48:51] because she's going to minister unto
[1:48:53] you. We we know that that's what
[1:48:55] happened. But just think about it,
[1:48:56] brothers and sisters. She had the
[1:48:58] opportunity, and it's no accident.
[1:48:59] There's no coincidence in the in the
[1:49:01] word of God. It's so beautiful, isn't
[1:49:02] it? How she had the two sticks, how she
[1:49:04] had that cross, and she had that burden.
[1:49:06] And what she was willing to do was take
[1:49:08] that burden and bear it. She was willing
[1:49:10] to pack that cross for the word of God.
[1:49:13] Not the word of a vindicated prophet,
[1:49:15] but the word of God. And that's all that
[1:49:18] comes through the voice of a vindicated
[1:49:20] prophet. That's why we follow a
[1:49:22] vindicated prophet here. But I can't
[1:49:24] help but think that Shoamite woman was
[1:49:26] willing to just bear it all. Just to
[1:49:28] take it all and
[1:49:30] say, I know that God's in control and I
[1:49:33] know he is alive. He is my God and I am
[1:49:36] going to give him the opportunity here.
[1:49:39] You know, uh another quote that I'm
[1:49:40] going to read out of questions and
[1:49:41] answers law having a shadow in
[1:49:45] 1954. This is going towards our text now
[1:49:48] out of um just uh take up your cross
[1:49:52] take up his cross daily. Brother Ranomy
[1:49:54] says, "Now, wouldn't you all like to
[1:49:56] have a real Bible
[1:49:58] church?" How many here would like to
[1:50:00] have a real Bible church? Amen. We're
[1:50:03] not interested in having a message
[1:50:05] church, are we? Even though we called it
[1:50:07] a message church two minutes ago, a
[1:50:10] message church I is not going to get us
[1:50:12] anywhere, brothers and sisters. Saying
[1:50:14] that we're Brandomites ain't going to
[1:50:16] get us anywhere, brothers and sisters.
[1:50:19] It's important to tell someone about a
[1:50:21] prophet, but then tell them what that
[1:50:23] prophet said.
[1:50:25] That prophet said, "Get into Christ."
[1:50:28] Because the prophet didn't die for
[1:50:30] anybody.
[1:50:32] We need to make sure we know where we
[1:50:34] stand.
[1:50:36] You know, unfortunately, this is one of
[1:50:37] the things that has pushed the young
[1:50:39] people out into the world.
[1:50:43] Randomism. People taking and making it
[1:50:45] something legalistic. This is what we
[1:50:47] do. But somewhere somehow sometime along
[1:50:50] the way back home, the children see mom
[1:50:53] and dad not living the words that this
[1:50:55] prophet taught.
[1:51:01] Wouldn't you all like to have a real
[1:51:03] Bible
[1:51:04] church? A real Bible church where all
[1:51:07] the spiritual gifts were set in order.
[1:51:10] Amen. Everything making manifest just
[1:51:13] exactly the way it should
[1:51:17] be. I know if you say speak in tongues,
[1:51:19] boy, some people want to just get upset
[1:51:21] and it's nervousness and it can be all
[1:51:23] this stuff. It's part of the word of
[1:51:25] God, man. It's one of the spiritual
[1:51:27] gifts. It's the fruit of the spirit. But
[1:51:29] isn't it wonderful that we had a
[1:51:31] vindicated prophet in our day that came
[1:51:32] and said, "Say what Paul said." I preach
[1:51:36] what Paul said. Paul set the first
[1:51:37] church in order. This guy set the last
[1:51:40] church in order. He brought it right
[1:51:42] back to the word of God and said, "If
[1:51:44] you want to speak in tongues, there is a
[1:51:46] place for it. But it's got to happen
[1:51:48] like this.
[1:51:51] If there's going to be a gift, it needs
[1:51:52] to be examined,
[1:51:55] not just blatantly out in the open." and
[1:51:58] and spoken in confusion in the
[1:52:00] congregation. That's not at all the way
[1:52:02] it's supposed to be.
[1:52:05] But wouldn't that be
[1:52:07] wonderful? Now, you're going to have to
[1:52:10] sacrifice. This is the part where it
[1:52:12] gets a little bit
[1:52:14] tough. I kind of my flesh want to say
[1:52:16] I'm sorry, but not my spirit because I
[1:52:18] know it's what it is. Now, you're going
[1:52:20] to have to sacrifice and not money. God
[1:52:24] doesn't need money. Amen. We're not
[1:52:26] pulling for money here. We're pulling
[1:52:28] for the spirit of Christ here. How many
[1:52:31] people wants to see more of Christ here?
[1:52:34] If you want to see more of Christ, it's
[1:52:36] because there's more of Christ to be
[1:52:37] had.
[1:52:40] And if you want more, there's more. But
[1:52:43] it's going to take some sacrifice. We're
[1:52:45] going to have to take up maybe just a
[1:52:47] little bigger cross.
[1:52:50] And not just Well, I did it 40 years
[1:52:52] ago, Brother Barry. I remember it very
[1:52:55] well. I did it 20 years ago. I did it 10
[1:52:57] years ago. I did it last week. It ain't
[1:53:00] enough. We're supposed to do it daily.
[1:53:06] Daily. And we know that's exactly what
[1:53:08] Paul said. I die daily. Didn't he? What
[1:53:11] was he saying? Exactly what the word
[1:53:14] said. I am taking up my cross and dying
[1:53:18] out to myself. I'm going to deny myself.
[1:53:20] Take up my cross and follow him. And
[1:53:22] what happens every single time we go
[1:53:23] down on our knees in the morning and
[1:53:25] pray? We know we've got to get out the
[1:53:27] door. We've probably got to feed the
[1:53:28] dog. We've probably got to maybe get our
[1:53:30] lunch. We've got to make sure, oh no,
[1:53:33] the car is low on gas. I got to get gas.
[1:53:35] I got all these things I've got to do. I
[1:53:37] don't have time to pray. You don't have
[1:53:40] no time for nothing else. Prayer is the
[1:53:42] only thing, brothers and sisters.
[1:53:46] If you want to see it happen, just just
[1:53:47] just try it sometime. Just try God. Take
[1:53:51] him at his word. Prove him at his word.
[1:53:53] Don't think that it's all about money
[1:53:55] that he's going to open the windows of
[1:53:56] heaven and pour out a blessing you can't
[1:53:57] contain. Remember that he'll open the
[1:53:59] windows of heaven and pour out a
[1:54:01] blessing. He'll make every single red
[1:54:03] light on the way to your meeting turn
[1:54:04] green, green, green, green, green. He'll
[1:54:08] make your boss be late. He'll make
[1:54:10] situations unfold that will make you
[1:54:13] look like a star.
[1:54:15] That's the God we serve.
[1:54:19] Two minutes of sincerity packing that
[1:54:22] cross could change your life forever.
[1:54:27] You're going to have to sacrifice, not
[1:54:29] money. God don't need your money. God
[1:54:32] don't need our money. Now, some might be
[1:54:34] saying, "Brother Barry, you know full
[1:54:36] well he does. That's why we give a
[1:54:37] tithe." You know what? It's God's money.
[1:54:39] It's all his money.
[1:54:42] He owns 100% and he only says you can
[1:54:45] keep 90, but I want 10
[1:54:49] plus
[1:54:51] offerings. That's not including the
[1:54:54] offerings. He says here, you're going to
[1:54:57] have to sacrifice
[1:54:59] what I I would say this. I love how he
[1:55:02] says it here. Some of your own ideas.
[1:55:03] I'll say in many cases, all of your own
[1:55:05] ideas.
[1:55:07] I'm not trying to correct a prophet. I'm
[1:55:09] just trying to expound upon it a little
[1:55:10] bit just to make us think about this.
[1:55:12] We're going to have to sacrifice
[1:55:13] sometimes all of our own ideas if we're
[1:55:16] going to die out to oursel. You know, we
[1:55:19] can't take one bit of our old
[1:55:22] denominational teaching and blend it
[1:55:24] with this message. And I think that's
[1:55:26] one of the biggest disservices that
[1:55:28] happens in the life of believers to
[1:55:30] think that we can take something from
[1:55:31] the old and mix it with this new. There
[1:55:34] ain't nothing that can mix with this
[1:55:36] message of the hour because this message
[1:55:38] of the hour is Christ. The only thing
[1:55:41] that's going to mix with it is his word.
[1:55:43] That's
[1:55:45] it. You're going to have to sacrifice
[1:55:48] not money. You have to sacrifice what?
[1:55:50] Some of your own ideas. You're going to
[1:55:52] have to sacrifice some time in
[1:55:56] prayer. It's going to be a sacrifice,
[1:55:58] brothers and sisters. But why would we
[1:56:00] want to do it if it
[1:56:02] wasn't? Why would we want to sacrifice?
[1:56:05] Why would we want to take time in prayer
[1:56:06] if it wasn't a bit of a sacrifice? Would
[1:56:09] it just be a a religious tradition? I'm
[1:56:12] going to go and light a a stick of
[1:56:14] incense and just let that smoke rise and
[1:56:16] play the M in the background and it will
[1:56:20] just be the atmosphere in my life. You
[1:56:22] know, there's people that do that
[1:56:24] sincerely.
[1:56:26] They will sacrifice very diligently to
[1:56:30] do that.
[1:56:32] And if you ever want to see how sincere
[1:56:35] people are, go and look at the the
[1:56:37] restaurant next time you go in it. Any
[1:56:39] Indian restaurant or any Chinese
[1:56:42] restaurant or any Vietnamese restaurant,
[1:56:45] take a look at the front there. There's
[1:56:46] always a little
[1:56:48] sacrifice. Always.
[1:56:50] They don't do it without because they
[1:56:52] are sincere. They're very interested in
[1:56:56] packing the cross that they understand.
[1:56:58] But how much more the sons and daughters
[1:57:00] of the living God to recognize that we
[1:57:03] serve a living God. We don't serve a a
[1:57:05] little brass bigbellied Buddha. We don't
[1:57:08] serve a fish. We don't serve idols of of
[1:57:11] wood and stone. We serve a living God.
[1:57:15] He hears our prayers. And even better
[1:57:18] yet, he answers them.
[1:57:23] You're going to have to sacrifice not
[1:57:25] money. You're going to have to sacrifice
[1:57:27] your own ideas. You're going to have to
[1:57:29] sacrifice time in
[1:57:31] prayer. You're going to have to
[1:57:33] sacrifice Oh, maybe a stubborn will.
[1:57:37] Huh? How many of us have a stubborn
[1:57:39] will? Don't raise your
[1:57:40] hands. Unless you want
[1:57:42] to, but I'll put my hand up cuz I know I
[1:57:46] can be real stubborn. I can be real
[1:57:48] stubborn. And I know that brother
[1:57:50] Brandham said just do the opposites if
[1:57:52] you want to know how to overcome those
[1:57:54] spirits because they're spirits. Some
[1:57:56] will call them genetics. I heard
[1:57:58] something now I'm going to get ignited.
[1:58:00] Brothers and sisters, if I wasn't
[1:58:01] excited before, now I'm going to be, you
[1:58:03] know, I heard a brother say it this week
[1:58:04] in the Bible study. God is not bound by
[1:58:08] genetics.
[1:58:10] He's not bound by history. He's not
[1:58:13] bound by gossip. He's not bound by
[1:58:15] anything. Amen. How dare we say that
[1:58:18] I've got this genetic defect from my dad
[1:58:21] or from my grandpa.
[1:58:23] This is God we serve.
[1:58:26] If we don't want it, we don't have to
[1:58:28] have it.
[1:58:31] We're talking about confession this week
[1:58:34] to someone. And you know, we're no no
[1:58:37] stronger than our confession, right?
[1:58:39] Isn't that what the prophet said? We'll
[1:58:40] never live higher than our confession.
[1:58:43] So, how dare we say to God, to the
[1:58:46] devil, both of them are listening. Their
[1:58:47] ears are open, listening, who's getting
[1:58:50] talked to. Who are we actually speaking
[1:58:52] to when we say, "I've got this thing.
[1:58:54] I've just got this this temper and I
[1:58:56] just can't get rid of it and it comes
[1:58:57] from my family."
[1:59:01] Or, "I've been delivered. I used to have
[1:59:03] this thing in my life. I'm a son of God.
[1:59:05] I know that it has no power over me."
[1:59:10] Which way you going to go? What way you
[1:59:12] speak is the way you'll behave.
[1:59:16] And I think it's even more than that.
[1:59:18] The way that we speak is going to
[1:59:20] actually give power to the spirit that's
[1:59:22] affecting us.
[1:59:28] You're going to have to maybe sacrifice
[1:59:29] your stubborn
[1:59:31] will to break down in humility.
[1:59:34] Sometimes we need that. And you know
[1:59:37] that was the difference between Cain and
[1:59:38] Abel. Cain and Abel. There was a big
[1:59:41] difference there. And the only
[1:59:43] difference was one was able to
[1:59:46] interesting. Hey, able to submit to the
[1:59:50] word of God. How'd he do it? It was
[1:59:52] through Revelation. My goodness, it's
[1:59:54] already quarter 2. Can we go till 1:00
[1:59:56] today?
[1:59:58] Boy, I'm not even really started. I just
[2:00:00] feel inspired today. You're going to
[2:00:02] have to sacrifice, brothers and sisters,
[2:00:04] if we're going to pick up a cross and
[2:00:06] follow him. And and if we're going to do
[2:00:07] it, we got to do it daily. Amen.
[2:00:10] What we need to do is break down in
[2:00:13] humility. And some might say, "Brother
[2:00:14] Barry, you don't have to do that. I've
[2:00:16] been saved and and sanctified,
[2:00:17] justified, sanctified, filled with the
[2:00:19] Holy Ghost, and I've never had a tear in
[2:00:20] my life." Maybe so. But Brother Brandham
[2:00:23] says that a birth is always messy. Not
[2:00:25] part-time, not
[2:00:27] sometimes. It's always messy. And you
[2:00:30] know what? Uh just reading the message,
[2:00:32] I I couldn't help it. I study so many
[2:00:34] quotes and you know, Brother Bradomy
[2:00:36] talks about it. What we need to do is
[2:00:37] just have a good oldfashioned revival.
[2:00:41] We need to know that that altar is still
[2:00:43] open. If people desire more of God,
[2:00:45] there's more of God to be had. And not
[2:00:48] be worried about what other people
[2:00:50] think. Not be worried about how late it
[2:00:53] is. I've got a pot roast in the oven.
[2:00:55] I've got plans. I've got this. I've got
[2:00:57] that. What if you have no other
[2:00:59] opportunity to fellowship with God after
[2:01:01] this moment?
[2:01:04] We would look back and think, I wasted
[2:01:07] it. I wasted
[2:01:10] it. We got to be willing to sacrifice
[2:01:12] our stubborn will to break down in
[2:01:15] humility. This is what brother Brandham
[2:01:16] said. You see, you're going to have the
[2:01:18] whole Christian move is
[2:01:21] sacrificial. He that will follow me, let
[2:01:23] him deny
[2:01:25] himself, take up his cross, and follow
[2:01:28] me daily. Is that right?
[2:01:30] How often? How often do you have to
[2:01:33] sacrifice?
[2:01:36] Every
[2:01:37] day, brother Bradom, he's saying it
[2:01:39] here. Paul said he died daily. Every day
[2:01:41] he died. Every day he died. And how did
[2:01:44] he die? He didn't actually go and have
[2:01:47] his heart stop and have, you know, the
[2:01:49] paddles and start his heart again. And
[2:01:51] we know
[2:01:52] that. But I think it's important to just
[2:01:55] talk about a little bit, brothers and
[2:01:56] sisters. He died out to his own will.
[2:01:59] We know that Paul, he he was of the
[2:02:03] stock of Israel, wasn't he? The tribe of
[2:02:05] Benjamin, a Pharisee of Pharisees,
[2:02:09] circumcised the eighth day. Everything
[2:02:11] in his life was absolutely in order
[2:02:14] according to the law. But we know that
[2:02:16] he took all of his teachings from Galia,
[2:02:19] all of his teachings that he was taught,
[2:02:21] the best of the best university in his
[2:02:24] day, he took them out into the desert
[2:02:26] and said, "I count them all as dung. All
[2:02:29] of my thoughts are useless now because I
[2:02:32] have been knocked off of my high horse
[2:02:35] to the ground where I could put my face
[2:02:37] to the ground and recognize that pillar
[2:02:39] of fire in my day." And what happened
[2:02:41] when that happened? He became a new
[2:02:43] creature.
[2:02:45] He was able to actually pack this
[2:02:47] gospel. He became
[2:02:49] worthy of this
[2:02:53] gospel. Worthy to manifest a
[2:02:56] life worthy of this gospel. Man, that's
[2:03:01] powerful. Looking at the unseen, Brother
[2:03:03] Brandham, he says this. You're dying.
[2:03:05] The doctors has give you up. Maybe the
[2:03:07] world has gi you up. Maybe the church
[2:03:09] has give you up. I say, Lord, help this
[2:03:12] church to never give up on anybody.
[2:03:14] Maybe the church has given you up, but
[2:03:16] Jesus has never given you up. Whosoever
[2:03:18] will deny himself and take up his cross
[2:03:20] and follow me. Deny what you're
[2:03:23] thinking. Deny your mental
[2:03:26] conception. Just believe what God's word
[2:03:28] says is truth and march on.
[2:03:32] Keep moving. Get
[2:03:35] sicker. Just keep moving.
[2:03:38] Just keep going. After a while, you'll
[2:03:40] break through the barriers and then
[2:03:41] you'll be free.
[2:03:45] Then you can see him and then he'll
[2:03:48] reveal himself to you. Then that son of
[2:03:51] God who made the promise will be real to
[2:03:53] you. Do you believe it?
[2:03:57] Sometimes we can have Christianity in
[2:04:00] our life and we can feel like we're
[2:04:02] saved. I think that's probably
[2:04:05] sanctification, brothers and sisters. We
[2:04:07] go through justification. when we get to
[2:04:09] sanctification and we can become stuck
[2:04:11] there and just not really able to go
[2:04:14] further. It's like for somebody else we
[2:04:16] come to church and a duty and everything
[2:04:18] is good and our life and we believe and
[2:04:20] yeah yeah yeah but it just never really
[2:04:23] excites us. There's nothing really
[2:04:25] there. It's just you know there's more.
[2:04:29] There's more and if you want it takes
[2:04:32] effort we've got to be willing to
[2:04:34] sacrifice. If we are willing to
[2:04:36] sacrifice, I think this whole entire
[2:04:38] word can become a new book to
[2:04:41] us. I just think it's so beautiful
[2:04:43] talking about that Shoemite woman, how
[2:04:45] she was able to actually take that
[2:04:48] cross and bear
[2:04:51] it. She took that cross and she was able
[2:04:54] to bear it. Out of God's word calls for
[2:04:56] a total separation from unbelief. 1964.
[2:04:59] But when a man is born in the word for a
[2:05:02] believer, he becomes a Nazarite when he
[2:05:04] separates himself from anything that's
[2:05:06] contrary to the word. Anything that's
[2:05:09] contrary to the word. So I want to say
[2:05:11] this, brothers and sisters. Now maybe it
[2:05:13] might be a challenge, but I I really
[2:05:15] want to say it. I think it's important.
[2:05:17] If it's not for the word of God, is it
[2:05:21] for the word of
[2:05:22] God? I don't know. It could be against
[2:05:26] the word of God, right?
[2:05:28] That's challenging. I know it. But this
[2:05:31] is Satan's Eden. Remember this. This
[2:05:32] world is Satan's Eden. Some things can
[2:05:35] be lawful, right? Isn't that what Paul
[2:05:37] said? All things are lawful. Yeah. But
[2:05:40] they're not expedient. Are they taking
[2:05:42] our time away from going on our knees
[2:05:44] and dying out to ourselves daily?
[2:05:48] How much do we pray, brothers and
[2:05:50] sisters? I heard this said a while ago,
[2:05:52] and I thought it was astounding to me.
[2:05:53] And I'll tell you what, I heard this at
[2:05:55] a kids Baptist summer camp, the one I
[2:05:59] went to this year. I was astounded when
[2:06:02] I heard this. You know, the church only
[2:06:04] moves forward on its knees.
[2:06:09] The church only moves forwards on its
[2:06:11] knees. So now, let's take it and bring
[2:06:13] it right down home. Imagine if the
[2:06:15] church only moved forward on your knees.
[2:06:18] Is there hope?
[2:06:22] I say, "Lord, help me." Oh my.
[2:06:27] But you look at a prayer
[2:06:34] meeting becomes a Nazerite when he
[2:06:37] separates himself from anything that's
[2:06:38] contrary to the world to the word,
[2:06:41] sorry. Total separation. Jesus said, "I
[2:06:43] come to separate a man from his wife,
[2:06:45] tear up a family, and he that won't take
[2:06:48] up his cross and follow me is not worthy
[2:06:52] to be called
[2:06:54] mine." Now, I'm not saying we're saying
[2:06:58] this so that people can say, "Husband
[2:07:01] believes one way, wife believes another,
[2:07:03] now he's come to tear it up." It's not
[2:07:06] what we're saying. It's not what the
[2:07:08] word's saying. He's saying that a person
[2:07:11] ought to follow him wholly and
[2:07:14] completely. If a husband says no, that
[2:07:17] doesn't mean that person isn't going to
[2:07:19] follow
[2:07:22] him.
[2:07:25] My a separation from everything,
[2:07:28] anything from
[2:07:29] church from
[2:07:31] church. Boy, the tape people are
[2:07:34] thriving there. Okay. A separation from
[2:07:36] everything. Anything from church, from a
[2:07:39] community, from a belief or from a
[2:07:41] family or anything that would stand
[2:07:42] between you and believing the entire
[2:07:45] word of
[2:07:46] God. That's taking all of our thoughts,
[2:07:50] all of our thinking, all of our mind,
[2:07:52] and just putting it aside and saying,
[2:07:53] "Be it unto me, Lord, according to your
[2:07:56] word." If we try and take anything of
[2:07:58] the old and mix it in with this new,
[2:08:00] what we're going to do is have a hybrid
[2:08:01] religion. And you know what brother
[2:08:02] Brandham said the the in a nutshell
[2:08:04] version because we're running out of
[2:08:06] time here is simple. The hybrid
[2:08:09] condition cannot reproduce.
[2:08:13] That's why you see churches dying.
[2:08:15] That's why you see it denominationally
[2:08:17] and that's why you see it in the
[2:08:18] message. If you try and mix something
[2:08:21] with this word, the hybrid condition
[2:08:24] according to all the laws that God put
[2:08:27] in place from the very beginning cannot
[2:08:30] reproduce.
[2:08:32] So you can have church people and
[2:08:34] they'll come. Maybe the church people
[2:08:35] will come and they'll drag their
[2:08:36] children kicking and screaming and the
[2:08:38] children will come and they'll go to
[2:08:39] Sunday school and they'll be a part of
[2:08:40] it. But they'll see there's no life
[2:08:42] there. And they'll just be like, I'm
[2:08:43] going to go and live in this world and
[2:08:44] be friends with the people that I want
[2:08:46] to be friends with. There's no point
[2:08:47] trying to be legalist. Why would I do
[2:08:52] that? But we've got to be willing to
[2:08:54] separate ourselves from everything that
[2:08:56] we think we know and allow him, the
[2:08:59] teacher. Amen. There's only one teacher
[2:09:03] when you really want to break it down in
[2:09:05] the word of God. Some would say,
[2:09:06] "Brother Barry, there's some very good
[2:09:07] fine teachers." And sure enough, there
[2:09:08] is. But we want the teacher, the Holy
[2:09:11] Ghost himself. And he'll take all the
[2:09:14] words that those other teachers say and
[2:09:16] actually make them real. Because without
[2:09:18] his spirit in us, they're just words.
[2:09:23] If your soul will not punctuate every
[2:09:26] promise for this hour with an amen,
[2:09:29] there's something wrong
[2:09:31] somewhere. You need a separation. He
[2:09:35] says, you
[2:09:37] know, this whole discussion, it just
[2:09:40] made me think about another story that I
[2:09:41] was sure about and I I had to go and
[2:09:44] look it up and was able to find it. And
[2:09:46] we're we're very familiar with it, I'm
[2:09:48] sure. And
[2:09:52] uh it's in Mark chapter 10. Quickly as
[2:09:57] we begin to close
[2:09:59] here, I won't keep us till
[2:10:02] one. I want to be respectful for time,
[2:10:05] but you know, talking about taking up
[2:10:07] our cross and following him is more than
[2:10:10] just going to church.
[2:10:13] It's more than just being a part of a a
[2:10:15] believing family and saying that I'm a
[2:10:18] Johnson or I'm a whatever. It's more
[2:10:22] than just saying that I do good things.
[2:10:25] It's actually when we don't want to do
[2:10:27] those things that it becomes a
[2:10:29] sacrifice. And you know, brothers and
[2:10:31] sisters, just I'll I'll say it this way.
[2:10:33] It's when you don't really want to tithe
[2:10:36] that it becomes a blessing. That's when
[2:10:38] it becomes the sacrifice. You know, the
[2:10:40] sacrifice, brothers and sisters, isn't
[2:10:42] when everything is all easy and and and
[2:10:45] free and we just have lots of abundance
[2:10:48] flowing, whether it's time or money or
[2:10:50] people or whatever it is, and we just
[2:10:52] give and it's all good and we do it and
[2:10:54] there's no issue. You know, there's a
[2:10:56] blessing with that, but you know, it's
[2:10:58] not as much of a blessing as when it
[2:11:00] hurts. It's not as much of a blessing as
[2:11:03] when it pinches. The blessing really is
[2:11:06] in the pinch. I've had that on my heart
[2:11:08] for a long time. It really is in the
[2:11:10] pinch when we are down to our last two
[2:11:13] sticks. And God's prophet comes around
[2:11:15] and says, "If you don't tithe, God can't
[2:11:18] bless you the way that you're looking
[2:11:19] for it."
[2:11:22] That's what he told the Shounomite
[2:11:24] woman,
[2:11:27] right? Mark 10
[2:11:31] 21, we know the story. Maybe we'll go to
[2:11:34] 17.
[2:11:35] When he was gone forth into the way,
[2:11:37] there came one running and kneeling to
[2:11:40] him and asked him,"Good Master, what
[2:11:43] shall I do that I may inherit eternal
[2:11:46] life?" Jesus said unto him, "Why callst
[2:11:49] thou me
[2:11:50] good? There's none good, but one, that
[2:11:55] is God. Thou knowest the
[2:11:57] commandments, do not commit adultery."
[2:12:00] Isn't it interesting that Jesus was
[2:12:01] telling him this? Jesus was discerning
[2:12:04] this guy here. Thou knowest the
[2:12:06] commandments. Do not commit adultery. Do
[2:12:08] not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear
[2:12:10] false witness. Defraud. Not honor thy
[2:12:12] father and thy mother. And he answered
[2:12:15] and said unto him, Master, all these
[2:12:17] have I observed from my youth. We we can
[2:12:20] be good message kids raised in the
[2:12:23] message. And we would have the same
[2:12:24] answer to Jesus right here. But there
[2:12:27] comes a point in time where we hear
[2:12:28] these words from Jesus. Then Jesus
[2:12:30] beholding him loved him. He didn't hate
[2:12:33] him. He loved him and said unto him,
[2:12:35] "One thing thou
[2:12:37] lackest. Go thy way and sell whatever
[2:12:40] thou hast and give to the poor that thou
[2:12:43] shalt have treasure in heaven and come
[2:12:45] take up the cross and follow me." Why
[2:12:47] did he tell him
[2:12:48] that? Because he knew that was his
[2:12:52] hindrance. He wasn't able to separate
[2:12:55] himself from that. And you know what?
[2:12:56] The the word of God says it. The love of
[2:12:58] money is the root of all evil. And if
[2:13:01] we're not careful, it will consume us.
[2:13:03] But I would say this could apply to any
[2:13:05] area of our life. If we're not willing
[2:13:07] to actually separate ourselves from it
[2:13:10] to the place where we give the
[2:13:11] preeminence to God, we could put
[2:13:14] whatever we want in here, not just
[2:13:15] money. But he told them, just go and
[2:13:17] sell whatever you have and give it to
[2:13:19] the poor, and thou shalt have treasure
[2:13:22] in heaven. And come take up the cross
[2:13:25] and follow me. And imagine this story.
[2:13:28] These are the words of Jesus, the word
[2:13:31] made flesh, God in flesh talking to him,
[2:13:33] the judge, the
[2:13:36] attorney, the all and all telling him,
[2:13:39] "If you just get rid of this earthly
[2:13:42] hindrance, you'll have treasure in
[2:13:45] heaven." Why?
[2:13:48] 22 says, "He went and
[2:13:51] as and he was sad at the saying, and
[2:13:55] went away grieved, for he had great
[2:13:58] possessions." And Jesus looked round
[2:14:00] about and saith to his disciples, "How
[2:14:02] hardly shall they that have riches enter
[2:14:06] into the kingdom of God?" And the
[2:14:08] disciples were astonished at his words.
[2:14:11] But Jesus answerth again, and saith unto
[2:14:13] them, children, how hard is it for them
[2:14:16] that trust in riches to enter into the
[2:14:18] kingdom of God? It's easier for a camel
[2:14:21] to go through the eye of a
[2:14:23] needle than for a rich man to enter into
[2:14:26] the kingdom of God. That is a very
[2:14:28] difficult statement. That is a very
[2:14:30] difficult thing. That's not to say that
[2:14:32] God does not have very wealthy people.
[2:14:35] But the very wealthy people, the secret
[2:14:36] to their success is they put God first.
[2:14:39] Amen. They're willing to take the time
[2:14:41] to make that sacrifice to die out to
[2:14:43] themselves daily. They understand that
[2:14:46] the pinch is where the blessing is. It's
[2:14:48] not when it just feels good or when I
[2:14:50] can afford
[2:14:52] it. We need to take up our cross,
[2:14:55] brothers and
[2:14:56] sisters. And I think it's amazing
[2:14:59] because we can say take up the
[2:15:02] cross and the word says take up his
[2:15:05] cross. the the scriptures that I really
[2:15:07] got inspired with. Jesus says to them,
[2:15:09] "Let him take up his cross and follow
[2:15:11] me. Die daily." That's, you know, the
[2:15:12] scripture that we read this morning. Let
[2:15:14] him take up his
[2:15:16] cross. And and Jesus says to the the
[2:15:19] rich young ruler here, "Take up the
[2:15:21] cross. Take up the word. Take up the
[2:15:25] Jesus a and and follow me. Be willing to
[2:15:28] follow my word." Because that's what he
[2:15:30] was saying to him. Follow my word and
[2:15:32] you'll have riches in heaven. And it's
[2:15:33] the same promise for each and every one
[2:15:35] of us, isn't it? If we're willing to
[2:15:37] take him at his word, we're going to
[2:15:38] have riches in heaven. The word of God
[2:15:40] says to lay up treasure in heaven that
[2:15:43] can't rust. Moths can't get in. There's
[2:15:45] no corruption. It's an inheritance
[2:15:47] reserved in heaven just for us, isn't
[2:15:49] it? We're mixing up the scriptures
[2:15:51] there. I know that in a power of
[2:15:53] transformation 1965, brother Random, he
[2:15:55] says, "Let the Holy Spirit come upon any
[2:15:57] person that's truly got something down
[2:15:59] there." A healing comes from the inside.
[2:16:02] Let that healing come from the spirit
[2:16:04] that's in
[2:16:05] you. If it's a genuine spirit anointing,
[2:16:08] the genuine seed, it can't do nothing
[2:16:11] but bear a son or daughter of God. But
[2:16:15] the genuine spirit can come upon a
[2:16:17] cockleber seed. The rain can fall upon a
[2:16:21] cockleber and it will make it live just
[2:16:24] the same as it falls upon a wheat and
[2:16:27] makes it leave live. But by their fruits
[2:16:32] you know them. See,
[2:16:34] we're a fruit tree of God bearing his
[2:16:37] word. Remember we said in the past those
[2:16:39] fruits aren't even for us, are they? For
[2:16:41] the people that see us and interact with
[2:16:43] us. Do they come up and see the fruit
[2:16:45] that's pickked and and and it's bitter?
[2:16:49] It's bitter and it's angry and it's
[2:16:53] impatient. It's got all these different
[2:16:55] attributes. That's not the fruit of the
[2:16:57] spirit. The fruit of the spirit is
[2:16:59] sweet, isn't it? And it smells good and
[2:17:02] it's got patience and it's got kindness
[2:17:05] and it's got joy. The fruit of the
[2:17:08] spirit is that what's in our life,
[2:17:10] brothers and sisters? Jesus said, "Let a
[2:17:12] man deny himself and follow me. Let him
[2:17:15] deny his
[2:17:17] education. Let him deny his knowledge,
[2:17:20] deny his degrees, take up his cross and
[2:17:23] follow me." Amen.
[2:17:26] And I couldn't help but but think about
[2:17:28] this. I'm going to probably call the
[2:17:31] musicians. I just want to say this,
[2:17:32] brothers and sisters. I'm not even going
[2:17:34] to get into that part. I'm going to save
[2:17:35] that part. That's that's a new part.
[2:17:38] What's your cross
[2:17:40] today? What's your cross
[2:17:43] today? I've talked about this in the
[2:17:45] past many times. I've I've lamented at
[2:17:48] my cross the things that I bear, the
[2:17:51] problems that I feel, that I perceive,
[2:17:53] that I have that maybe God I feel like
[2:17:56] hasn't delivered me from. Brother
[2:17:57] Brandham, he prayed and cried out until
[2:17:59] the very end of his ministry, 1965, on
[2:18:01] the wings of a snow white dove, he was
[2:18:03] given the testimony it took until then
[2:18:05] for him to receive the healing of the
[2:18:07] gastrointestinal problem he had in his
[2:18:10] life. On the wings of a snow white dove,
[2:18:13] he explains it graphically. if you want
[2:18:14] to go listen to it. We know it was a
[2:18:16] spiritual affliction, but God allowed
[2:18:18] that thorn in his flesh just like Paul
[2:18:20] for a reason, didn't he? So that he
[2:18:23] wouldn't be puffed up beyond measure
[2:18:26] according to the amount of revelation he
[2:18:27] was
[2:18:28] given. Kept him humble. God will allow
[2:18:32] thorns or crosses in our lives that we
[2:18:36] need to bear. Are we willing to pick
[2:18:37] them up and bear them? I want to try and
[2:18:40] encourage us today, brothers and
[2:18:41] sisters. If you got a cross today,
[2:18:43] you've got the strength to bear it. He
[2:18:45] would not give that cross to you if you
[2:18:47] didn't have the strength to haul it.
[2:18:52] He didn't say the cross wouldn't be
[2:18:54] heavy,
[2:18:56] did
[2:18:57] he? But he said you'd be able to bear
[2:18:59] it.
[2:19:01] His word says that he'll never give us
[2:19:02] more than we can bear. And there ain't
[2:19:05] nothing that happens that he doesn't
[2:19:07] first know about. There's no devil that
[2:19:09] can come around and trip us up with a
[2:19:11] banana peel in our path and he's
[2:19:13] surprised, God's surprised. Everybody's
[2:19:15] surprised. Suddenly this person's all
[2:19:17] messed up. No, no. It only happens
[2:19:20] because God allows it first. And that is
[2:19:22] so that he can see his character come
[2:19:25] out of us. We know that his character,
[2:19:27] that gold that we should buy of him,
[2:19:30] that's been tried in the fire, it's the
[2:19:32] fire of fiery afflictions, the fire in
[2:19:35] the valleys of of the struggles that we
[2:19:37] go through. But I I have cried many
[2:19:40] times about the cross that I've got to
[2:19:41] bear. Why do I got it? He delivered me
[2:19:43] from this and this and this and this and
[2:19:44] this, but this other thing, I still am
[2:19:46] dragging it around.
[2:19:48] Why? So that I can follow my face daily
[2:19:51] and say to him, Lord, thank you.
[2:19:54] Let me die to myself. Let me deny myself
[2:19:57] today, Lord, so that you could live. I
[2:20:00] promise you, brothers and sisters, if
[2:20:01] you haven't practiced that, then try it.
[2:20:04] If you have practiced it, keep doing it
[2:20:06] and watch him succeed in your life. He
[2:20:10] will change that meeting. He'll change
[2:20:12] the traffic. He'll change the
[2:20:13] circumstances to go so incredibly well
[2:20:16] to your favor, you won't believe it.
[2:20:18] Amen. And I know what I know full well
[2:20:21] the ones that said, "Amen." They know
[2:20:22] that. They've experienced it. That's the
[2:20:24] way it works. Put him first in every
[2:20:27] single thing in our lives, brothers and
[2:20:28] sisters, and he will bless you. Maybe
[2:20:31] stand with me as we close today. What's
[2:20:32] your cross today, brothers and sisters?
[2:20:34] Out of the Amplified Bible in Luke 9 23,
[2:20:38] and he said to all, if any person wills
[2:20:41] to come after me, let him deny himself,
[2:20:45] disown himself, forget, lose sight of
[2:20:49] himself and his own interests.
[2:20:52] refused to give up himself and take up
[2:20:56] his cross daily and follow me. Cleave
[2:20:58] steadfastly to me. Conform wholly to my
[2:21:02] example in living and if need be dying
[2:21:07] also.
[2:21:09] Take up your cross, brothers and
[2:21:10] sisters, and follow him. Let's just bow
[2:21:13] in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[2:21:16] thank you for your word today. Thank you
[2:21:19] Lord Jesus that you have given us the
[2:21:21] example in the Bible to take up our
[2:21:24] cross Lord. Every one of us has a cross
[2:21:26] Lord Jesus. Some of us have illness in
[2:21:29] our bodies Lord. Some of us have illness
[2:21:31] in our minds Lord. Some of us have
[2:21:33] marriage troubles Lord. Some of us have
[2:21:35] children troubles Lord. Some of us have
[2:21:38] financial troubles Lord. Some of us have
[2:21:40] spiritual problems Father. But every
[2:21:42] single one of us, you gave us this
[2:21:44] opportunity to say amen to your word. Oh
[2:21:47] father and lord when we ever just submit
[2:21:50] ourselves or when we humble ourselves to
[2:21:53] you father and we push aside that pride
[2:21:55] and say be it unto me according to your
[2:21:57] word according to your will then father
[2:22:00] we know that you come around and you
[2:22:02] help us bear that cross Lord you never
[2:22:05] leave us or forsake us. You give us the
[2:22:08] strength that we need. Father this
[2:22:10] morning my heart's desire is that
[2:22:12] anybody that needs strength this morning
[2:22:14] could come unto you, Father. that they
[2:22:16] could just push aside all of the pride,
[2:22:18] all of the cares of this life, who cares
[2:22:21] what anybody thinks, and just surrender
[2:22:23] unto you, Father, once again, just give
[2:22:26] you the preeminence that you desire,
[2:22:28] maybe for the first time in their life.
[2:22:30] Oh father, maybe just for a renewal of
[2:22:32] of your relationship with them, Father,
[2:22:35] whatever it is, Lord, help us to pick up
[2:22:38] the cross, Lord Jesus, not to get weary
[2:22:40] and welloing, but realize, Father, there
[2:22:43] is a work to be done. And you will give
[2:22:45] us the strength that we need, Father. Oh
[2:22:48] Lord Jesus, we love you and we thank
[2:22:49] you. We pray that you would be with
[2:22:51] those who are away today, Father,
[2:22:52] wherever they are, whatever they're
[2:22:54] doing. Father, give them strength and
[2:22:56] bring them back home safely again at the
[2:22:59] appointed time. We ask Lord, we love you
[2:23:02] and we thank you, Father. We just ask
[2:23:04] now that you'd be glorified in a couple
[2:23:06] of songs before we dismiss. In Jesus
[2:23:09] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Can
[2:23:13] we sing that song, Take Up Your Cross.
[2:23:17] Take up your cross and follow Jesus.
[2:23:25] Take up your
[2:23:28] cross and follow
