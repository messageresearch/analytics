awesome good morning Lord bless you all just felt led to read another poem to you today it's kind of interesting because I've never written a poem in my life never even enjoyed poetry but two weeks ago I was driving in my vehicle and these words came to me and over the last two weeks the to help the Holy Ghost I've kind of added it to it and honed it so I strongly believe that someone's meant to hear this today the title of the poem is spiritual maturity once we knew in part our vision incomplete our prophecies mere Shadows at our feet with passion our Prophet implored this beautiful Truth for us to explore oh don't be children be women and men the End Road is here let faith in you transcend transcend a little greenness left to bake he's waited for fruit on the branch to take with a heart full of compassion he encouraged us so seek God's face and let wisdom flow the time has come to own our place true love Faith and God's divine grace the perfect one has come he's arrived Shining Light so clear no longer in part we truly see and hear as a child we thought and acted like a child might but the matured are promised to be led by the mind of Christ with heart mind and speech all aligned choosing to live by God's truth each time once we saw through a mirror dark and unclear the world's turmoil often caused our hearts to fear but now we see him face to face by Love's Eternal embrace our chosen place with the true anointing of his spirit we are renewed it's God's power it transfigures and abuse with all authority to discern to love and to serve his great name we abide and are preserved the anointing from above did descend guiding us always our true purpose to defend through great storms and trials we often tripped and squirmed but by his Loving Care we found the strength to stand firm for in his mighty name we did overcome because our Victory he hath already won his election persevered and will never fail it's the guidepost that keeps you and I from drifting off the trail Our Hope and Faith have endured but it's his love his most precious and pure the anointing we received anchors Within a teacher of Truth free from all sin no need for man's teachings God's word is true simply abide in him and he will abide in you the Capstone so pure and right our Union veiled from Mortal sight low the spiritual bride appeared her true color showing on protrude by fear as we began our Revival inner strengths bright and vital aligning ourselves with God's very word our hearts and souls with Revelation stirred behold the secret of the ages displayed through us as living pages where scriptures clear to catch the bride they led us to our husband's side the invisible Union bride to bride and bride to Christ no longer tossed in darkness Gloom United forever the mythical Church the bride the selected LED it to deeper thoughts and higher objectives his coming happened the word effective the change of our bodies the Rapture the final directive Lord bless you all foreign
