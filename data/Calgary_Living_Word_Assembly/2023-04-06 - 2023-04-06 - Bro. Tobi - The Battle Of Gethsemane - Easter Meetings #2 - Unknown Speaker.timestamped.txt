[31:28] Hallelujah God bless you tonight welcome
[31:31] to the house of the Lord
[31:33] on a Thursday night
[31:35] we know that as many things we could be
[31:38] doing but something constrains us to be
[31:40] here tonight
[31:42] something in special in store for each
[31:44] one
[31:46] we know that he comes where he's invited
[31:49] and he comes according to our
[31:50] expectations
[31:52] and the Beautiful part is many times he
[31:55] meets and exceeds our expectations
[31:58] it does way above and beyond what we
[32:01] could ask or think
[32:03] tonight we're so thankful that we can
[32:05] invite brother Toby to take the service
[32:07] and just Express What the Lord Has put
[32:09] on his heart and as I had mentioned you
[32:12] know I myself have been studying the
[32:14] last few weeks sort of the events
[32:17] leading up to the you know the
[32:19] crucifixion and the resurrection and you
[32:22] know Easter what it means to us and I
[32:25] just I don't think I could have said it
[32:27] better than brother Gilbert did last
[32:29] night than the Lord did through brother
[32:30] Gilbert last night what does the
[32:31] resurrection mean to us
[32:33] individually because that's the new
[32:36] birth that's what it is and you know
[32:38] what he he died and rose again 2000
[32:40] years ago but that ain't good enough for
[32:41] today he has to be alive in us today he
[32:44] has to have a resurrection in our very
[32:46] lives today and then it's no longer us
[32:50] it's him
[32:52] you know I just couldn't help but think
[32:53] about it tonight and I don't want to
[32:55] take too much time we'll just sing that
[32:57] uh course again as we invite brother
[32:59] Toby but you know brothers and sisters
[33:02] it was a night exactly like tonight
[33:04] where they went into the garden
[33:07] and Jesus prayed for you and for me
[33:12] and we know the victory was one right
[33:14] there in that Garden it wasn't on
[33:16] Calvary and it wasn't in the Tomb it was
[33:19] in the garden where he laid down his
[33:21] will and that truly is the new birth and
[33:24] I'm excited to see what brother Toby has
[33:26] on his heart tonight we'll just invite
[33:28] him to come
[33:31] I'm Amazed
[33:39] I'm Amazed
[33:42] [Music]

[35:01] people be

[35:06] Fellowship

[35:10] if we didn't have an opportunity
[35:12] to come to a place Lord Jesus Christ
[35:15] where fellow Believers are
[35:17] where we know Lord Jesus Christ are the
[35:20] demons that are troubling people Lord
[35:23] Jesus that we rub shoulders with when we
[35:25] go into our usual days at work dear Lord
[35:29] Jesus where we know we don't have to
[35:31] encounter those demons their lord Jesus
[35:33] we were in a place there father where
[35:36] people who have consecrated their lives
[35:38] dedicated their lives to the Lord are
[35:40] gathered together
[35:42] father that is the joy Lord Jesus has
[35:44] the peace that is the atmosphere we feel

[37:22] Jesus Christ's number for him amen amen
[37:26] a bless you musicians thank you very

[37:31] I guess we could just read the word so I
[37:34] can have you
[37:35] take your seat
[37:37] for the very just uh print my message in
[37:40] two two sentences just before I came up
[37:43] here
[37:44] tonight I want to speak on the Battle of
[37:46] Gethsemane
[37:54] and that was such a good opening
[37:56] yesterday I said over the Gilbert
[38:02] the resurrection
[38:03] has to mean something to every one of us
[38:07] I was thinking about this in the room
[38:09] the entire life of Jesus
[38:11] has to mean something to us
[38:14] we have to get to that point where we
[38:16] start to see that same life
[38:18] in our lives
[38:20] so Matthew chapter 26
[38:23] I'll read from 36 to 46 and then we'll
[38:26] flip over to Hebrews chapter 2.
[38:36] all right I'll start reading from verse
[38:37] 36.
[38:40] then come at Jesus with them onto a
[38:43] place called gethsemani and said unto
[38:46] the disciples City here while I go and
[38:49] pray Yonder
[38:51] and he took with him Peter and the two
[38:54] sons of Zebedee and began
[38:56] to be sorrowful
[38:58] and very heavy
[39:01] they said he unto them my soul is
[39:04] exceeding sorrowful even unto death
[39:07] here and watch with me
[39:11] and it went to little father
[39:13] and fell on his face and prayed saying
[39:16] oh my father
[39:18] if it be possible let this car pass from
[39:21] me
[39:22] nevertheless not as I will
[39:26] but as thou wilt
[39:28] and he comes unto the disciples and
[39:31] finding them asleep
[39:33] and say it unto Peter what
[39:36] could you not watch with me one hour
[39:40] watch and pray that ye enter not into
[39:43] temptation the spirit is indeed willing
[39:46] but the flesh is weak
[39:48] went away again the second time and
[39:51] prayed saying oh my father
[39:54] if this cop may pass away from me except
[39:57] I drink it
[39:58] thy will be done
[40:00] and he came and found them asleep again
[40:02] for their eyes were heavy
[40:05] and then left them and went away again
[40:07] and prayed the third time saying the
[40:10] same words
[40:11] and cometh he to his disciples and say
[40:14] it unto them sleep on now
[40:16] and take your rest
[40:18] behold the hour is at hand and the son
[40:22] of man is betrayed into the hands of
[40:24] sinus rice let us be going behold he is
[40:29] at hand the doeth betray me
[40:32] amen let's go to Hebrews very quickly
[40:34] chapter 2.
[40:36] verse 18.
[40:45] just that verse he said four in that he
[40:48] himself have suffered been tempted
[40:52] he is able to secure them that attempted
[40:56] amen the Lord bless the written of his
[40:58] word you may have your seats
[41:04] this
[41:06] sin that is before us today
[41:10] we find Jesus
[41:13] going to
[41:15] the guardian of Gethsemane
[41:18] well let's just step back a little bit
[41:20] and look at what had happened a few days
[41:22] prior
[41:24] I like to call this the third pool of
[41:26] the ministry of Jesus Christ
[41:28] where he was opening the word to a
[41:32] private group
[41:35] at this time he wasn't speaking to the
[41:37] entire
[41:38] World it wasn't speaking to all the
[41:41] people he wasn't even speaking to the
[41:42] Pharisees
[41:44] he was having a private conversation
[41:48] with his disciples
[41:50] and we know that even at that time I was
[41:54] thinking about that there was still one
[41:56] of them
[41:57] who was of the evil one
[42:01] but Jesus was having a private
[42:03] conversation Jesus was opening the word
[42:05] to them
[42:06] in this private conversation we found
[42:08] Jesus prophesying about his death
[42:11] is burial and his resurrection
[42:14] we found him prophesying about the
[42:17] future
[42:19] he talked about the destruction of
[42:20] Jerusalem he talked about the end of the
[42:22] world he talked about the sign of his
[42:25] coming
[42:26] the disciples had questions it was
[42:29] patient enough to answer them
[42:33] in the account of John We Found Jesus
[42:36] talking about the church
[42:39] he was talking about
[42:43] the fact that there was going to be a
[42:45] church and right there was letting the
[42:47] disciples know that there was an
[42:50] advancement in the relationship there
[42:53] was an advancement in the intimacy and
[42:55] we've heard that you know for many
[42:57] services he said henceforth I call you
[43:00] no more servants I call you friends
[43:03] it was at that time he was telling them
[43:05] what they were to look forward to
[43:08] he said the comforter was going to come
[43:10] when he the spirit of truth comes it
[43:13] will guide you into all truth and I
[43:16] often wondered
[43:17] how the disciples felt when Jesus told
[43:21] them that it was going to leave
[43:23] because it was their comforter
[43:25] anything they needed they went to him
[43:28] but he got to a point where he started
[43:30] to tell them I am going to take my leave
[43:34] and he said but don't worry
[43:36] I'm going to say unto you another
[43:39] comforter
[43:41] and that's why I said Jesus was their
[43:43] comforter because he was going to send
[43:45] another comforter but he explained to
[43:47] them you don't have to worry this
[43:50] comforter is just exactly as me because
[43:54] it's me coming in spirit form
[43:58] it was at this time he was telling them
[44:00] about the love that she bind them
[44:05] he prayed
[44:07] and told the father let it be that same
[44:10] love that I and my father are warned
[44:13] that they also can be one with us
[44:16] we had that yesterday how that would
[44:19] happen
[44:20] it was about this time that he also was
[44:23] anointed by Mary
[44:25] of Bethany
[44:27] for his burial
[44:30] and what we will call Wednesday nights
[44:33] which was yesterday was the Passover
[44:35] Gilbert actually turned on it yesterday
[44:37] I was just so excited the Passover
[44:40] happens
[44:42] and then the next day is the start of
[44:45] the Feast of unleavened bread
[44:47] and that should be for seven days I
[44:49] believe
[44:51] and we found that the disciples came to
[44:54] Jesus
[44:55] and said where would you like to eat the
[44:57] Passover
[44:58] and that's when he told them you know go
[45:00] to this person you'll find go to the
[45:02] spiritual place you find this person
[45:04] tell the person that the master needs a
[45:06] room and then you can make ready for the
[45:09] last for the supper which we now know as
[45:11] the Last Supper
[45:12] but as Jesus was going through all of
[45:14] this and if you think about my title I
[45:17] know a lot of people might wonder
[45:19] I know about getting money I've learned
[45:21] about read about getsy money in the
[45:23] Bible but I don't know about any battle
[45:25] that happened in Gethsemane
[45:27] and I'm not talking about Peter drawing
[45:30] out his sword to cut off the hair of of
[45:33] the servant of of one of uh the the the
[45:36] side the priests
[45:38] or the Pharisees
[45:40] but we're going to get there I want us
[45:42] to notice that Jesus
[45:46] at this point was 100 a man
[45:50] now this was a man
[45:53] that knew the future
[45:57] now as humans we are designed in a way
[45:59] that when we see something that will
[46:02] hurt us we either fight or we take a
[46:06] flight
[46:09] so Jesus was very conscious of what was
[46:12] coming right before him it was very
[46:15] conscious of what was going to happen
[46:19] and he was expressing that to his
[46:21] disciples
[46:22] he was conscious of the fact that one of
[46:25] the persons that have lived so close to
[46:28] him for the last three and a half years
[46:30] in fact the one that had the purse
[46:34] was going to betray him
[46:38] he knew that the one that was his right
[46:41] hand man
[46:42] was going to deny him and even curse
[46:48] because he was telling them this he told
[46:50] Peter you're going to deny me three
[46:52] times two times before the the Coco
[46:55] three times
[46:58] and he was also saying to them as they
[47:00] were having the Last Supper that one of
[47:02] you will betray me
[47:06] and Jesus had needed
[47:08] that he was in distress
[47:10] he said my soul is exceedingly sorrowful
[47:14] even unto death
[47:23] and after he had had this last supper
[47:26] with them he called the three of
[47:29] his disciples who would probably would
[47:31] call the greatest of the twelve
[47:34] and they went into the garden with him
[47:39] the brand said in the message
[47:40] desperations
[47:42] so that dear Lord Jesus himself
[47:44] in the world's greatest Battleground
[47:49] gets the money
[47:50] he cried out in the spirit should he
[47:52] take the Seas of the world or should he
[47:55] just remain on Earth with his beloved
[47:57] disciples
[48:03] what he wanted to do but watch his
[48:06] humility as he humbled himself not my
[48:10] will but thine be done
[48:12] humbled himself to the wall to the word
[48:15] the promised word of God Of Heaven
[48:18] he said in adoption but the brand said
[48:20] in the guardian of Gethsemane the
[48:22] anointing left him brother brother Barry
[48:24] just said that
[48:26] he was not
[48:27] the god part of him left him brother
[48:32] Brown said he had to die as a man
[48:37] so whenever I'm thinking about what
[48:39] Jesus went through and I'm thinking
[48:41] about what happened in the Garden of
[48:42] Gethsemane
[48:43] I need to realize that Jesus was just
[48:46] exactly like me
[48:48] other than the fact that he knew the
[48:50] future
[48:55] In The Garden of Gethsemane the
[48:57] anointing left him you know he had to
[48:59] die as a sinner brotherbraham wasn't
[49:01] saying that Jesus was a sinner
[49:03] but Jesus had to take the place of The
[49:06] Sinner the punishment of The Sinner he
[49:10] had to take that upon himself
[49:13] he died a sinner you know that not his
[49:16] sins but mine and yours that's where
[49:20] that love come in how he took mine oh
[49:22] hallelujah how it took mine
[49:28] now I'm talking about a battle that was
[49:30] happening
[49:32] and you might want to ask me where was
[49:34] the location of that battle
[49:37] well the brand has an answer for us
[49:44] sorry
[49:45] um
[49:47] I'll just read it here and then we'll go
[49:49] to see what what I had uh what I was
[49:51] trying to show and you know let me just
[49:54] let me just start with this first we we
[49:56] know this we've all seen it we've all
[49:58] heard about it we as human are Triune
[50:01] being we have the body on the outside we
[50:03] know the senses of the body we have the
[50:06] spirit next to it we know the senses of
[50:09] the spirits
[50:11] do we know it's
[50:14] okay let's I'll show you over there so
[50:18] we have memory we have affection we have
[50:21] imagination we have reasoning and we
[50:23] have conscience but the brand told us
[50:25] that and if you read some earlier parts
[50:28] of the Brahms Ministry I know I've said
[50:29] this before I know you know it but the
[50:31] brand did call what I'm showing as the
[50:33] spirit but the brand did called it the
[50:35] soul but later on it kind of you know
[50:38] corrected that and told us the soul is
[50:40] the innermost part
[50:42] and one thing he said about the soul is
[50:45] is either of two senses you can't have
[50:48] the two at the same time it's either
[50:51] Faith or doubt
[50:53] and there are times you might live in
[50:55] the realm of faith and the next day you
[50:57] might live in the realm of doubts
[51:00] that still has nothing to do with the
[51:01] sweet germ that is inside you
[51:04] right I know I've said this and we'll
[51:06] talk about the sea gerb what we are
[51:07] talking about who is the master of that
[51:11] home at that point in time
[51:14] now we're going to concentrate more on
[51:16] the spirit and for just a title tonight
[51:19] I would rather
[51:21] you know want to refer to that as a
[51:23] human mind
[51:26] but Ram told us
[51:29] so when this great battle started on
[51:31] Earth it was saying this in the greatest
[51:33] battle ever for there had to be a mutual
[51:36] meeting place
[51:37] there had to be a place selected for the
[51:40] battle to begin and for the battle to
[51:43] reach
[51:44] and that Battlegrounds begin in the
[51:48] human mind
[51:50] why am I bringing this Jesus was going
[51:53] through a mind battle
[51:55] in Gethsemane
[51:59] so Jesus was going through a mind battle
[52:02] it was in a place where he needed to
[52:06] make a decision why that decision was
[52:09] harder for Jesus to make was because
[52:11] Jesus knew the future
[52:14] there are times that will take a flight
[52:17] or there are times of fights because we
[52:21] know a part of the future we know what
[52:22] it might look like
[52:25] so if you know that there's something
[52:26] that's going to hurt you you're going to
[52:28] avoid it or you're going to totally run
[52:31] away from it
[52:33] but you don't know the details
[52:35] but Jesus knew the details
[52:38] and just to go a little bit ahead of
[52:39] myself the reason I read Hebrews is that
[52:43] we were told that in that he himself has
[52:47] suffered
[52:48] is able to take that suffering that
[52:51] you're going through and go through it
[52:54] with you with a full realization of what
[52:57] it feels like
[53:00] the full realization of what it feels
[53:03] like
[53:07] are we insured tonight
[53:10] so talking about this but let me just
[53:12] finish reading this is where the battle
[53:14] starts the human mind was chosen for the
[53:17] place of the battle where it was begin
[53:20] and that is because the decisions
[53:24] decisions are made from the mind he
[53:28] called it the head we're going to get a
[53:30] little bit into that the brain
[53:33] that's where decisions are made and
[53:36] Jesus had to make a decision
[53:38] In The Garden of Gethsemane so we know
[53:41] that this
[53:42] mind the human mind that is where every
[53:45] sadness every anger every depression
[53:48] every despair every failure
[53:51] every fear every fight
[53:54] all of the arrogance you've ever seen
[53:56] start in the human mind
[54:00] that's also the place where every joy
[54:03] every peace every Comfort every victory
[54:07] all the happiness you've ever had all
[54:10] the victory you've ever had of the
[54:11] humility of the success you've ever had
[54:14] started from the human mind
[54:20] so how powerful is our human mind
[54:26] let me just read a few things that I
[54:29] kind of found from the research that's
[54:31] been done and when I'm talking about the
[54:33] mind just a lot of people will kind of
[54:37] researchers will kind of use mind or
[54:40] brain and the way I understand it is the
[54:43] brain is our anatomical mind
[54:46] it is it is the it is the visible part
[54:50] of our mind
[54:52] well there is a huge part of our mind
[54:54] that is not visible
[54:56] you can't see it
[54:58] you know that's why sometimes you see
[55:00] people going to Coma but their mind is
[55:02] still active
[55:04] right their brain might be
[55:06] non-functional but their mind is active
[55:09] so how how powerful is the human mind
[55:15] they said more recently a research study
[55:17] found that the human brain can hold 10
[55:20] times as much information as previously
[55:24] thoughts
[55:27] all told scientists now believe that the
[55:30] capacity of the human brain is about a
[55:34] petabyte
[55:36] so I probably will find you here
[55:38] gigabyte you hear all of that
[55:42] so the first question is how powerful is
[55:44] the person's mind
[55:47] so the mind is the most powerful
[55:49] computer in the world at the moment
[55:51] that energy moving across the synapses
[55:54] of your neutrons sorry no your re
[55:58] neurons has potent potential to
[56:02] revolutionize revolutionize your life
[56:05] a single thoughts can spark a flurry of
[56:09] activity
[56:11] now the next question how are human
[56:13] brains so powerful
[56:16] since the human brain is complex in in
[56:19] humans it consists of about 100 billion
[56:22] neurons making on the order of 100
[56:27] trillion connections
[56:30] it is often compared with another
[56:31] complex system that has enormous
[56:34] problem-solving power the digital
[56:36] computer
[56:39] is the human brain most powerful that's
[56:42] the next question the most powerful
[56:44] computer known is the brain
[56:47] the human brain processes about 100
[56:50] billion neurons with roughly one
[56:54] quadrillion that is one on one million
[56:57] billion connections known as synapses
[57:02] wiring these cells together
[57:06] so when you are wowed by chats GPT
[57:10] artificial intelligence and what it can
[57:13] do if you've ever heard about that and
[57:15] those things are very impressive
[57:18] but your brain is stronger than it
[57:22] the human intelligence is stronger the
[57:25] artificial intelligence only makes human
[57:27] intelligence it has the power to bring
[57:29] several human intelligence together I
[57:31] don't want to get into all of that
[57:32] because I'm not at work I'm in church
[57:35] but just to give you an idea one of the
[57:38] things that people worry the most about
[57:39] is with all the artificial intelligence
[57:42] that's coming are we going to still have
[57:44] jobs in the future
[57:46] and the SR has always been that humans
[57:49] will still have jobs
[57:51] because even if you have you know
[57:54] artificial intelligence Robert's doing
[57:56] all of the things that you need them to
[57:58] do someone still needs to tell them what
[58:00] to do
[58:03] so God will always outsmart Satan
[58:07] we know that the knowledge of this world
[58:09] is not from God
[58:11] we know that scientists are watching God
[58:13] and trying to copy brother Brown said
[58:15] God gave them a sneak peek into his
[58:18] laboratory
[58:20] and then they could see some of the
[58:21] things that God has done so the computer
[58:23] is designed after the human brain is
[58:26] what I'm trying to tell you
[58:29] now it says does the human mind have a
[58:31] limit
[58:33] so the dead pen and said to this
[58:35] question will be no
[58:37] your brain is almost certainly not full
[58:42] sometimes I think my brain is full
[58:46] but we have not just used up all the
[58:48] potential that our brain has
[58:50] although there must be a physical limit
[58:52] to how many memories we can store it is
[58:55] extremely large
[58:57] we don't have to worry about running out
[59:00] of space in our lifetime
[59:03] sometimes I think the things are
[59:05] forgotten
[59:06] but you know I was thinking about that
[59:07] and when brother Brahm said you see
[59:10] people on their death bed
[59:12] and things that they have forgotten all
[59:15] their lives come flashing right in their
[59:17] face
[59:19] because it's been stored somewhere
[59:21] that's how powerful it is remember the
[59:24] reason we're bringing this is to point
[59:26] us to the fact that Jesus Christ had a
[59:29] battle going on is his human mind in
[59:32] Gethsemane
[59:37] now Romans chapter 12 verse 1 to 2 says
[59:41] this
[59:43] I beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[59:45] mercies of God that ye present your
[59:46] bodies a Living Sacrifice wholly
[59:49] acceptable unto God which is your
[59:51] reasonable service
[59:52] and be not conformed to this world
[59:57] but be transformed
[1:00:00] by the renewing of your mind
[1:00:06] proved what is that good the proof of
[1:00:09] his resurrection there has to be a
[1:00:12] renewing of your mind
[1:00:14] an acceptable and perfect will of God so
[1:00:18] God hasn't given us our human mind
[1:00:21] and intending for that human mind to
[1:00:24] rule Our Lives
[1:00:28] do you understand has anyone ever gone
[1:00:30] through a mind battle here
[1:00:33] okay
[1:00:35] just to let you know Jesus went through
[1:00:37] that as well
[1:00:39] but we are going to see how Jesus
[1:00:40] addressed the Mind battle
[1:00:43] I think that's a big lesson for us
[1:00:45] tonight
[1:00:48] but the brand told us in the greatest
[1:00:50] battle level 4.
[1:00:53] he said if you got your senses see taste
[1:00:56] feel smell and hear they're all rights
[1:00:58] but don't trust them
[1:01:01] unless they agree with the word
[1:01:05] they're all right but if they disagree
[1:01:07] with the word
[1:01:09] don't you listen to them
[1:01:13] the Bible said now imaginations
[1:01:14] conscience memories reasons and
[1:01:17] affections they are all right if they
[1:01:19] agree with the word those are the senses
[1:01:23] of your spirits what we are calling the
[1:01:25] human mind but if you have faction
[1:01:27] doesn't agree with the word gets rid of
[1:01:30] it
[1:01:32] the rap said you will blow a flu right
[1:01:35] quick
[1:01:36] if your reason disagrees with the word
[1:01:39] get away from it that's right if your
[1:01:41] memory if your imaginations if your
[1:01:43] conscience anything disagrees
[1:01:48] with that what's on the inside if it's
[1:01:52] straight that's on the inside of your
[1:01:53] soul whatever signals that faith is
[1:01:57] sending remember that doubt is also
[1:01:59] doing that at the same time you don't
[1:02:02] listen to what Satan says you listen to
[1:02:05] What God Says
[1:02:09] now brother Brian made us to know
[1:02:11] that Satan takes advantage of our minds
[1:02:15] this powerful tool that God has given to
[1:02:18] us
[1:02:19] Satan tries to take advantage of it
[1:02:22] and like I said before every fight
[1:02:25] starts in the mind every hatred starts
[1:02:29] in the mind you know the the thing about
[1:02:31] this many times I will get to it we
[1:02:33] think about the thoughts that come into
[1:02:35] our minds
[1:02:38] and we'll get to the way brother the
[1:02:39] brand was asked that question
[1:02:41] where are those thoughts coming from so
[1:02:43] I'm not going ahead of myself
[1:02:44] but I just want to
[1:02:46] kind of maybe quickly say this
[1:02:49] the Bible told us that as a man thinketh
[1:02:52] in his heart
[1:02:55] so easy
[1:02:56] right as a man thinking we've read about
[1:02:59] the brain we've been told how powerful
[1:03:01] it is
[1:03:02] and he's telling us here that as a man
[1:03:04] thinketh in his heart
[1:03:07] so
[1:03:08] is he that's that's who he becomes right
[1:03:11] now there's a difference just for the
[1:03:14] for the purpose of this conversation
[1:03:15] there's a difference between your
[1:03:16] thoughts and your thinking
[1:03:20] what comes in is the thoughts
[1:03:22] it becomes your thinking when you accept
[1:03:24] it
[1:03:27] when you start to ponder over it God has
[1:03:30] such made that human mind that it is
[1:03:33] creative
[1:03:35] all the things that we see this was
[1:03:38] somebody's imagination this Pulpit the
[1:03:41] piano was somebody's imagination the
[1:03:43] organ was somebody's imagination all the
[1:03:46] things that have been created by men
[1:03:48] were someone's imagination where did he
[1:03:50] start from the human mind
[1:03:55] so what comes in they take it and they
[1:03:58] think about it
[1:03:59] now if it's a right thought that comes
[1:04:02] into your mind and you think about it
[1:04:04] that is who you become
[1:04:08] if it's the wrong thought that comes
[1:04:09] into your mind and you think about it
[1:04:12] that's who you become and this applies
[1:04:15] to all aspects of Our Lives
[1:04:18] that's why some of the things they say
[1:04:21] you know they say that's fake it till
[1:04:23] you make it
[1:04:24] and it works for people
[1:04:26] because that faking is happening in
[1:04:28] their mind
[1:04:29] they believe it so much that they become
[1:04:32] it
[1:04:33] that is how powerful that
[1:04:36] element of our life that God has given
[1:04:38] to us
[1:04:39] but Satan takes advantage of it but if I
[1:04:42] give an example many times we don't
[1:04:44] think that this happened in brother
[1:04:45] Brown's life
[1:04:47] he said I get spells too
[1:04:51] it gets Moody
[1:04:53] I get to a spot where what gets me is
[1:04:56] where I get to those spells where I get
[1:05:00] all overworked and Satan comes telling
[1:05:03] me why nobody cares
[1:05:06] for you
[1:05:08] anyone ever felt like that before
[1:05:12] Satan can take time to build something
[1:05:15] that never exists in your mind about a
[1:05:19] brother or a sister
[1:05:23] I don't know if I've said this here
[1:05:24] before
[1:05:26] but I went somewhere many years ago to
[1:05:28] prejections my father-in-law's Church
[1:05:29] the first time I was going to preach
[1:05:31] there I was waiting in the office
[1:05:34] and a brother comes and meets with me
[1:05:36] um asked if he could see me
[1:05:39] and I said sure and he said brother
[1:05:41] I have something to tell you
[1:05:45] he said a while back when you guys
[1:05:46] visited
[1:05:48] we were in church I greeted you but you
[1:05:50] did not respond to me
[1:05:53] and something told me that you don't
[1:05:56] like me you know about me you know about
[1:05:58] my family
[1:06:00] and you don't like me
[1:06:02] and that's why you did not respond
[1:06:04] I looked at him like brother
[1:06:08] I only know your first name
[1:06:10] know nothing about your family and he
[1:06:13] said when that thing came into his mind
[1:06:15] something told me because at that time I
[1:06:16] wasn't they didn't know me as a minister
[1:06:18] but something came to his mind and said
[1:06:20] what if this brother becomes a minister
[1:06:22] tomorrow
[1:06:24] so fast forward to a year or so after
[1:06:27] was when I went to take a service in the
[1:06:29] church
[1:06:30] and the brother was like wow
[1:06:33] but that's how Satan comes to take
[1:06:36] advantage of our human mind
[1:06:38] and brother Brian is telling us here I
[1:06:40] get all overworked and Satan comes
[1:06:42] telling me why nobody cares for you you
[1:06:44] really haven't got a friend in the world
[1:06:48] see
[1:06:49] remember I'm not immune to the
[1:06:53] temptation
[1:06:54] if Jesus was not immune to it
[1:06:57] then brother Brahm was not
[1:07:00] remember Jesus when he was even telling
[1:07:03] his disciples
[1:07:04] that this is what I'm going to do
[1:07:07] I almost want to think about it he was
[1:07:09] prepping himself up for something that
[1:07:12] was too great for him to even surrender
[1:07:15] himself to you was prepping himself up
[1:07:18] to to to that Journey To The Cross and
[1:07:21] all that he will have to go through
[1:07:23] and what did Satan do Satan anointed
[1:07:25] Peter
[1:07:27] and said no Lord no you cannot go
[1:07:31] and he started rebuking probably getting
[1:07:34] into some very
[1:07:36] you know old-time prayer meeting that
[1:07:39] Jesus should not go to the cross
[1:07:42] and Jesus said
[1:07:44] Satan get the behind me
[1:07:49] because if you and I were to put
[1:07:51] ourselves in in the shoes of Jesus if
[1:07:55] I don't know what what example to use
[1:07:57] but let's say we're going to do
[1:07:59] something we've never done before go on
[1:08:01] a roller coaster the fastest ever
[1:08:04] and somebody comes and starts to remind
[1:08:06] you about you know two years ago when
[1:08:09] they had an accident and someone died
[1:08:11] will that encourage you to go
[1:08:14] absolutely not
[1:08:18] so Jesus also had those mind battles the
[1:08:20] ram said I'm not immune to temptation
[1:08:23] he said like a certain friend of mine oh
[1:08:25] sorry I'll just go back to the annoying
[1:08:27] me to the Temptation see I got to
[1:08:28] overcome that then when I look back and
[1:08:31] see something like this I pull it right
[1:08:34] back in the face and say what about that
[1:08:38] what about the word of God what about
[1:08:41] this positive thing about what Satan is
[1:08:43] trying to say the negative what about
[1:08:45] that like a certain friend of mine
[1:08:46] setting and the meaning here was a clan
[1:08:49] kind of a clan that doesn't believe in
[1:08:51] Divine Healing come to this young fellow
[1:08:53] recently and said to him that stuff that
[1:08:55] they're preaching they're about Divine
[1:08:56] Healing there's nothing to it
[1:08:59] let me just say here Never Surrender
[1:09:01] yourself to Satan to be a vessel to be
[1:09:04] used to discourage someone
[1:09:10] now brother Brown was asked the question
[1:09:12] and I think that might this might help
[1:09:13] someone
[1:09:16] brother Brian please explain how a
[1:09:19] person knows if he's thinking his own
[1:09:21] thoughts
[1:09:22] or if the devil is placing thoughts in
[1:09:25] his mind to make him think wrong
[1:09:27] especially if you know you don't want to
[1:09:31] think then
[1:09:34] anyone has been in those
[1:09:36] situations
[1:09:39] where you don't want to think I mean I I
[1:09:42] some thoughts that come to my mind I'm
[1:09:43] not even proud enough to to say well
[1:09:46] this thought ever came into my mind
[1:09:50] but that was a question
[1:09:52] that somebody asked for LeBron
[1:09:55] he wants to know are those your thoughts
[1:09:59] or not
[1:10:00] now let's listen to the answer
[1:10:03] then if it's contrary to the word it's
[1:10:06] the devil's thinking
[1:10:11] he just told us that he himself is not
[1:10:13] immune to it he gave us an example of
[1:10:15] Sarah coming to tell him that nobody
[1:10:17] loves you
[1:10:19] and Satan knows how to come
[1:10:21] and even tell you something that there
[1:10:23] is enough evidence to disprove it
[1:10:26] I gave you know the the example of when
[1:10:28] I was giving my testimony of my new job
[1:10:30] how I needed to do
[1:10:33] criminal record check in Nigeria
[1:10:35] and there was some delay to it and I
[1:10:37] know I've never been a criminal but
[1:10:39] Satan told me that it was going to come
[1:10:41] out and it was going to be negative
[1:10:43] results
[1:10:45] since I've never been a criminal I said
[1:10:47] well you know Nigerian police they are
[1:10:49] never
[1:10:50] they're never trustworthy somebody will
[1:10:52] make a mistake somewhere and they will
[1:10:54] come back and of course you've resigned
[1:10:56] this job and you'll never get this one
[1:11:00] where is that all happening the human
[1:11:02] mind
[1:11:04] in the human mind
[1:11:08] the brand said if it's contrary to the
[1:11:11] word it's the devil's thinking
[1:11:13] if it's with the word it's God's
[1:11:17] thinking
[1:11:18] what does this tell me
[1:11:21] it tells me that my mind is a virgin
[1:11:24] ground
[1:11:29] in its original state it's a virgin
[1:11:31] ground
[1:11:33] now depending on which of the thoughts I
[1:11:37] accept
[1:11:38] that will tell me the atmosphere I'm
[1:11:41] going to create in my human mind and
[1:11:43] invariably the atmosphere that I'm going
[1:11:45] to create around myself
[1:11:50] so if anything that is wrong is coming
[1:11:54] into your mind it is not your thoughts
[1:11:59] it is the devil's thoughts
[1:12:03] if it's good thoughts of the word and of
[1:12:06] God it's God's thinking
[1:12:10] now the question the person to ask the
[1:12:13] question goes on to save the case may be
[1:12:14] that the devil is placing thoughts in
[1:12:16] your mind about a certain thing how may
[1:12:19] it be overcome or got rid of so now the
[1:12:22] thoughts has come you've identified that
[1:12:25] this is Satan bringing this thought into
[1:12:27] my mind
[1:12:28] how can you get rid of it
[1:12:30] the brand said take the very vice versa
[1:12:35] from it if the devil makes you think
[1:12:38] that's
[1:12:39] if you know you are a Christian and it
[1:12:40] tries to make you think you're not a
[1:12:42] Christian just take the verse and say I
[1:12:44] am a Christian it is that simple
[1:12:49] Satan is just a bully
[1:12:52] that's just a difference sometimes we'll
[1:12:54] keep pounding it in your mind
[1:12:57] and what you've got to do is also keep
[1:12:59] pounding it in Satan's years
[1:13:05] well the ram talked about a brother
[1:13:08] who had a dream
[1:13:10] the devil came to him and said
[1:13:12] and he jumped back
[1:13:14] and he came and said boo again and he
[1:13:15] jumped back and at some point he
[1:13:17] realized
[1:13:19] Nigerians will say that you can't be
[1:13:21] chancing me or like you can't override
[1:13:23] me right I also I also have to fight
[1:13:25] back and he said boo to this to the
[1:13:28] devil now what we think happens is when
[1:13:31] we say boo to the devil we think nothing
[1:13:32] happens
[1:13:34] but actually something happens
[1:13:37] when you say bull to the how do you say
[1:13:40] bull to the devil you speak the word of
[1:13:42] God
[1:13:43] when you speak the word of God when you
[1:13:45] continue to speak the word of God it
[1:13:47] will get to a Time Satan will leave you
[1:13:51] but LeBron says
[1:13:53] if he says you another Christian just
[1:13:55] say the verse and say I'm a Christian as
[1:13:57] long as you experience matches in God's
[1:13:59] word say I'm a Christian anything else
[1:14:02] the same way
[1:14:04] now the question goes on to say when you
[1:14:07] answer this please pray for me to
[1:14:09] overcome this as I'm not by myself and
[1:14:12] brother Brian prayed and said God grant
[1:14:13] you your overcoming ever who you are may
[1:14:16] your thoughts just go right back the
[1:14:18] other side and say I am a Christian
[1:14:21] I am a believer Satan you have no hold
[1:14:24] on me
[1:14:27] and I know that all of us
[1:14:31] or some of us
[1:14:33] are in these situations we face it I
[1:14:35] face it every day
[1:14:37] but the brand
[1:14:40] this is some of those things are very
[1:14:42] amazing
[1:14:44] under the anointing
[1:14:46] the brand said frankly I'm standing
[1:14:48] right here now
[1:14:49] saying the same thing
[1:14:53] but the brand is on the pulpits Satan is
[1:14:55] not saying you know what there's so much
[1:14:57] anointing there I'm never going to go in
[1:14:59] there right on the platform
[1:15:03] Satan was still fighting him with
[1:15:05] thoughts
[1:15:07] negative thoughts say now I'm saying the
[1:15:10] same thing keep from fainting right here
[1:15:13] at the pulpit that's right four or five
[1:15:15] times I've almost speeched over on the
[1:15:17] pulpit
[1:15:19] that's the truth God knows that's right
[1:15:24] now the question goes on to say when a
[1:15:26] person realizes he has an inferior
[1:15:28] complex or some sort of complex how may
[1:15:31] he overcome this
[1:15:32] so should it be if he was the only child
[1:15:35] caused this in his early use
[1:15:39] LeBron says again take exactly the
[1:15:42] opposites
[1:15:43] if you're always wanting your way
[1:15:46] and that little one little breath that
[1:15:49] wants to always have everything your way
[1:15:51] turn right back around and give
[1:15:52] everything you've got the other way
[1:15:55] if you're selfish and you want to hold
[1:15:57] everything then start giving away what
[1:16:00] you got see do whatever just go the vice
[1:16:03] versa and that's the way to overcome
[1:16:06] anything it's an antidote
[1:16:11] so we see Jesus
[1:16:15] that night
[1:16:16] come wrapping up very soon
[1:16:20] yes
[1:16:24] Hallelujah
[1:16:28] what Iran says after the supper that
[1:16:30] night the crossover Little Brook
[1:16:32] seadrum and somewhere I went across the
[1:16:35] brook and went into a garden called
[1:16:36] Gethsemane
[1:16:39] they had to have a conference
[1:16:43] God and Christ had to talk
[1:16:46] he had to talk it over
[1:16:48] the Lamb on the Dover to sit together
[1:16:51] was the door that had to talk to the
[1:16:53] lamb
[1:16:54] it was the Lamb's death
[1:16:58] now when they sit back when they sit by
[1:17:01] that rock
[1:17:02] and all the Angels come down
[1:17:04] from Heaven to listen into this
[1:17:07] conference
[1:17:08] Ram said oh there was Gabriel Michael
[1:17:12] one wood
[1:17:13] all the thousands of them
[1:17:15] sitting around the Rock
[1:17:18] said to his disciples
[1:17:20] we read they had add lots of big
[1:17:23] meanings was tired perhaps like you are
[1:17:26] this evening
[1:17:28] but they said will you just watch with
[1:17:31] me an hour
[1:17:33] for I've got to go Yonder and have a
[1:17:35] conference
[1:17:36] I have to go alone
[1:17:39] the brand said the conf friends was set
[1:17:42] and the lamb young a beautiful life
[1:17:44] never a life like that
[1:17:47] never was never will be a life like that
[1:17:51] lamb ad
[1:17:52] but now the father said are you willing
[1:17:56] it's your love for your brethren great
[1:17:58] enough
[1:18:00] it's your love for that sinful
[1:18:03] stinking world that you were born in
[1:18:07] do you love them enough to forfeit your
[1:18:09] life
[1:18:11] do you love them enough to take their
[1:18:13] place
[1:18:14] to Bear their sins
[1:18:17] to the hardest
[1:18:18] crucial death
[1:18:21] there could be nothing die like that
[1:18:23] kind of death but him
[1:18:26] LeBron said and in that conference
[1:18:28] such a decision was made
[1:18:32] until blood dropped from his brow
[1:18:36] it was under a strain
[1:18:39] the scenes of the world was upon him
[1:18:42] and then he looked into the face of the
[1:18:45] dove and said
[1:18:46] not my will
[1:18:49] for thy will be done
[1:18:52] that was where he won the victory
[1:18:55] so the berry said it before the service
[1:18:57] brother Brian said Jesus did not die on
[1:19:00] Calvary
[1:19:01] Jesus died in Gethsemane
[1:19:05] and if there is no death there can be no
[1:19:08] Resurrection
[1:19:12] so before you totally answer that
[1:19:15] question what does resurrection mean to
[1:19:18] me you've got to ask yourself have I
[1:19:21] died already
[1:19:27] because he said if we die with him then
[1:19:29] we will be raised with him
[1:19:32] but we have to come to that point where
[1:19:34] we ask ourselves have I died to my own
[1:19:37] self have I died to my own ideas have I
[1:19:41] died to my thoughts have I die to my
[1:19:43] desires
[1:19:45] have I got to a stage
[1:19:47] where I can say not my will
[1:19:51] but thine be done
[1:19:54] the brown said oh can we have that
[1:19:56] decision in our hearts this evening
[1:19:59] can you forfeit that little filthy life
[1:20:02] of yours
[1:20:04] are you willing to look into his face
[1:20:06] and say
[1:20:07] not my will
[1:20:09] I am a drunk at but I'll drink no more
[1:20:13] I am a gambler I'll drink no more I'm
[1:20:16] immoral
[1:20:17] I'll be that way no more I am a liar but
[1:20:21] I'll stop it today
[1:20:22] I'm a foul person but in this conference
[1:20:25] this evening I'll look into your face
[1:20:28] and take like my master who died for me
[1:20:31] to May my to make my way clear not my
[1:20:35] will
[1:20:36] your will
[1:20:38] if it cost me my home
[1:20:41] if it cost me my husband my wife my
[1:20:44] father my mother my fellowship my church
[1:20:47] membership
[1:20:48] whatever it costs me
[1:20:50] in this conference this morning
[1:20:53] this evening I say I want your Holy
[1:20:56] Spirit
[1:20:57] to live in me I've heard about it I want
[1:21:01] you in me not mine but yours will that
[1:21:04] be a decision tonight
[1:21:07] the Battle of Gethsemane
[1:21:09] Jesus went there
[1:21:11] for you and for me
[1:21:14] it was tough for him
[1:21:16] but he had to let go of all his will
[1:21:19] you have to let go of all his pride he
[1:21:21] has to let go of all the benefits that
[1:21:24] he had being a master of people here
[1:21:28] always been called master
[1:21:30] it was God he knew everything
[1:21:34] the comfort that he had here we know he
[1:21:36] wasn't rich
[1:21:38] but we know he loved his disciples
[1:21:41] we know he loved the people
[1:21:45] but he got to a point he said not my
[1:21:47] will
[1:21:48] be done I'll call the musicians let's be
[1:21:51] on our feet tonight
[1:22:01] we know it was a Night Like This
[1:22:05] that happened
[1:22:10] said he prayed for us
[1:22:16] it didn't just make that decision he
[1:22:18] didn't just go to the cross
[1:22:21] he knew why he was paying the price
[1:22:26] and he he prayed for the beneficiaries
[1:22:30] of that prize it was paid
[1:22:34] and that's who we are
[1:22:36] so if he was tempted in that way to go
[1:22:40] through a mind battle
[1:22:42] if he was tempted in that way for Satan
[1:22:45] to come into his mind and try to
[1:22:47] convince him otherwise he said he was in
[1:22:49] despair
[1:22:51] even unto death the point of death
[1:22:55] and the people he trusted the most I was
[1:22:58] thinking about it what prayer requested
[1:23:00] Jesus have for Peter for John and for
[1:23:03] James
[1:23:05] when he said watch with me an hour was
[1:23:08] he asking them just join me to pray that
[1:23:10] this cup may pass over me
[1:23:15] trusted them he needed them at that
[1:23:18] point
[1:23:19] but they were too tired
[1:23:24] but because he thought about you
[1:23:27] thought about me
[1:23:29] he made the decision
[1:23:32] but Graham said at that point the
[1:23:33] anointing left him
[1:23:36] he didn't go there as God he get he went
[1:23:39] to Gethsemane as
[1:23:43] just like you and I and if he faced that
[1:23:47] situation
[1:23:48] regardless of any situation you find
[1:23:50] yourself in remember
[1:23:53] in that he himself was tempted
[1:23:58] he's able to secure
[1:24:00] those that attempted that's about right
[1:24:03] to pray tonight
[1:24:06] dear Lord Jesus
[1:24:12] as we continue to remember the price you
[1:24:15] paid for us
[1:24:18] now that you knew the future
[1:24:22] and you knew Lord Jesus Every Beat Of
[1:24:25] Our Lives
[1:24:26] even 2 000 years
[1:24:31] after you were here in flesh
[1:24:34] you made a provision
[1:24:37] Lord you ensured their father that you
[1:24:39] tasted every hardship
[1:24:42] that will ever go through
[1:24:45] so that you know how it feels
[1:24:49] and their father we have brought many
[1:24:51] requests before you
[1:24:54] Lord sometimes it's things that we are
[1:24:57] going through in our lives
[1:25:01] we know Lord Jesus Christ at every
[1:25:03] situation in our lives
[1:25:06] starting the human mind
[1:25:08] your servant said that's the
[1:25:10] Battleground
[1:25:12] every time we reject the word of God
[1:25:17] that happened in the mind first
[1:25:20] every time we accept your word
[1:25:23] that happens in the mind your Prophet
[1:25:24] said intellectually we are hearing the
[1:25:26] word
[1:25:28] before he becomes a revelation we have
[1:25:31] to hear it like Paul said Faith cometh
[1:25:34] I hear it
[1:25:37] we know Lord Jesus that's not just the
[1:25:39] hearing of how I hear Lord Jesus we know
[1:25:42] this is the hearing that happens in the
[1:25:44] hearts where where it starts to
[1:25:46] translate Lord Jesus into into into
[1:25:49] imagination not where we start to to
[1:25:51] kind of have some feeling to it there
[1:25:54] Lord Jesus where where where we start to
[1:25:57] have some understanding of it
[1:25:58] intellectually
[1:26:01] but we know you want to take it beyond
[1:26:03] that the Lord Jesus
[1:26:04] you want to make your word a revelation
[1:26:06] in our heart you want to make every
[1:26:08] promise in the book
[1:26:09] a revelation to us
[1:26:12] not that we might start to think Lord
[1:26:15] Jesus the way you think like the Bible
[1:26:16] said let the mind that is in Christ be
[1:26:19] in you that when we get to situations in
[1:26:22] our lives Lord Jesus we take the Outlook
[1:26:25] of Christ
[1:26:28] to look at that situation
[1:26:32] when someone Acts
[1:26:36] in a mean way to us
[1:26:38] we have temperance
[1:26:40] to know how to react back in kindness in
[1:26:44] love just the way Lord Jesus you used to
[1:26:47] Lord Jesus Christ father on the way to
[1:26:49] the Cross their father the the way
[1:26:51] heating you so hard they were beating
[1:26:53] you so hard yet Lord Jesus you have
[1:26:56] nothing but love for them
[1:27:00] and your servant said
[1:27:03] nothing comes there with perfect love
[1:27:08] father if there's anyone that's going
[1:27:09] through mind battles if there's anyone
[1:27:11] going through depression
[1:27:13] Satan Lord Jesus Christ father has built
[1:27:16] a house in any heart here
[1:27:18] Lord and continuously is bringing
[1:27:21] discouragement to them May tonight be
[1:27:24] Lord Jesus the night of their
[1:27:25] Deliverance their lord Jesus
[1:27:27] may we start to see things the way you
[1:27:30] see them Lord when we start to follow
[1:27:32] your word your promises Lord Jesus
[1:27:34] Christ father Lord may we start to think
[1:27:37] about it it was said Lord Jesus to
[1:27:39] Joshua this book of the law shall not
[1:27:41] depart out of thy mouth you must
[1:27:43] meditate upon it day and night dear Lord
[1:27:46] Jesus may we continue to meditate upon
[1:27:49] your word
[1:27:51] thank you Father for going to Calvary
[1:27:53] but much more thank you for the decision
[1:27:56] you made against
[1:27:58] me because we knew you we know that that
[1:28:00] was where it happened
[1:28:02] where you gave up your will your human
[1:28:04] will there father
[1:28:06] and you took on the will of the father
[1:28:08] we are grateful that you did it just for
[1:28:10] us
[1:28:11] Blessed Be Your holy name
[1:28:14] bless us Lord Jesus tonight
[1:28:16] and Lord Jesus continues to bless us in
[1:28:18] the meetings dear father Lord your
[1:28:20] servants that you're going to use father
[1:28:22] for the rest of the meanings just Lord

[1:32:06] you
[1:32:07] Elijah the prophet
[1:32:09] it has to be personal
[1:32:12] it has to be something that if no one
[1:32:15] else agrees with you you stay with it
[1:32:19] because it's a personal revelation
[1:32:21] that's what the dead of Jesus means
[1:32:25] a personal if he was just you that was
[1:32:28] The Sinner on Earth today he still will
[1:32:31] admit that decision

[1:33:26] once again from the Lord to recognize
[1:33:30] when we feel isolated and alone and we
[1:33:33] think that we're not
[1:33:34] we're not connecting with the Lord and
[1:33:36] that he's not connecting with us you
[1:33:38] live 2 000 years ago here on Earth and
[1:33:40] he has no idea what kind of pressure
[1:33:42] we're under what kind of situations
[1:33:44] we're contending with
[1:33:46] he was fighting the same enemy
[1:33:49] the exact same way
[1:33:51] the battleground of the Mind
[1:33:54] tremendous and you know the only thing
[1:33:56] that Christ asked for when he did pray
[1:33:59] whether Branham says it very clearly is
[1:34:01] that he asks for our fellowship he could
[1:34:04] have asked for anything else
[1:34:06] and I just I thought brother Toby was
[1:34:09] going to get into it when this Angels
