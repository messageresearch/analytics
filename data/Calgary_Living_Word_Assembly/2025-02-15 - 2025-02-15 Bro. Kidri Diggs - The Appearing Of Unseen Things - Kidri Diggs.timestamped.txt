[46:34] um turn to Second Kings chapter
[46:44] 6 second Kings chapter
[46:53] 6 let's start reading that um verse
[47:02] 15 well let's back up to 13 we know this
[47:06] is the
[47:07] king summoning Elisha he's sending you
[47:11] know if we want to say troops down to
[47:13] get Elijah in the middle of the night
[47:17] when he wasn't you know paying attention
[47:19] to
[47:20] anything you know verse 13
[47:24] says and he said go and spy where he is
[47:28] that I may sin and fetch him and it was
[47:32] told him saying behold he is in Doan
[47:37] this is 2 Kings chapter 6
[47:40] ver14 therefore sent he thither horses
[47:42] and chariots and a great host and they
[47:46] came by night and compassed the city
[47:49] about and when the servant of the man of
[47:51] God was risen early and gone forth
[47:55] behold and host compassed the city both
[48:00] with horses and chariots and his servant
[48:03] said unto him alas my master how shall
[48:06] we do and he answered fear not for they
[48:10] that be with us are more than they that
[48:13] be with them and Elisha prayed and said
[48:17] Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he
[48:21] may see and the Lord Open the Eyes of
[48:25] the young man and he saw and behold the
[48:29] mountains was full of horses and
[48:31] Chariots of Fire round about Elisha amen
[48:35] let's go to Hebrews chapter
[48:55] 11 praise the Lord
[48:57] amen verse
[48:58] one the Bible says now Faith is the
[49:02] substance of things hoped for the
[49:04] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[49:07] the elders obtain a good report through
[49:10] faith we understand that the worlds were
[49:12] framed by the word of God so that things
[49:15] which are seen were not made of things
[49:17] which do
[49:19] appear amen may the Lord at a blessing
[49:21] to the reading of his word you can have
[49:23] your seats
[49:28] by the grace of God tonight I want to
[49:31] use for a subject the appearing of
[49:33] unseen
[49:35] things the appearing of unseen things
[49:40] amen you know it may it may sound like a
[49:43] a strange topic but we know we know the
[49:45] prophet preached a message called
[49:47] looking into the
[49:48] Unseen and as Believers Church
[49:53] um The Seed of Abraham was pushed to
[49:57] live this kind of life because God told
[50:01] Abraham you know he said go and walk
[50:04] before me and be thou perfect you know
[50:06] and Abraham he he per se the only
[50:10] Direction he had was the voice of God
[50:13] you know he didn't know where he was
[50:15] going he didn't know the battles he was
[50:16] going to come up against so he he
[50:19] literally had to live a life of Faith
[50:22] amen and when you're living a life of
[50:25] Faith you're really living in the Unseen
[50:27] realm
[50:28] amen but what I want to say tonight is
[50:33] the Unseen things are even more real
[50:36] than the things that are
[50:37] seen amen and they're even more powerful
[50:40] than the things that per say our five
[50:43] senses can be make tangible that's right
[50:46] but the Unseen things are so great and
[50:49] so powerful they are unexplainable
[50:52] Hallelujah somebody say amen amen now
[50:56] what what I'm saying is what I'm saying
[50:58] tonight is I'm speaking from a spiritual
[51:01] journey that you me all of us our
[51:04] journey walking in the Unseen Rim by
[51:08] faith makes the things of God appear
[51:12] amen
[51:14] hallelujah because it's a walk of faith
[51:17] and faith has to be an
[51:20] assurance Faith Can't Be A hope so or
[51:23] maybe but it has to be I know God got my
[51:28] back right I know God is
[51:30] real I know God Is A Healer you know to
[51:35] claim your faith you bring that healing
[51:37] out of the Unseen realm that is already
[51:42] here that's right God is Not performing
[51:45] The Healing he's already done it it's
[51:49] you and I accepting the
[51:51] healing Hallelujah so it's making the
[51:55] Unseen things appear to be even more
[51:59] real amen hallelujah hallelujah but as I
[52:02] preach tonight I want you to catch
[52:04] something the Unseen
[52:07] things are already here amen yes sir
[52:12] amen hallelujah amen amen but what has
[52:16] to happen spiritually just like
[52:19] naturally it takes an instrument so we
[52:22] can see it amen hallelujah hallelujah
[52:26] amen you know as we look right here in
[52:28] the Bible where Elisha everybody all
[52:30] right tonight where Elisha you know I
[52:32] feel my helper
[52:35] Hallelujah if you don't know what that
[52:36] mean that mean I feel the presence of
[52:38] the Lord amen hallelujah thank you Lord
[52:42] you know as we look right here in the
[52:44] story with
[52:45] Elisha you know the king he said go
[52:48] fetch him I want I want I need to talk
[52:50] to him but what he did was he wanted to
[52:53] be not
[52:55] seen yeah yeah so what he did was he
[52:57] snuck up on the prophet at
[52:59] night Hallelujah and he came with horses
[53:02] and
[53:03] chariots and he thought that because I'm
[53:06] not seeing Hallelujah I got to jump on
[53:09] this man but then the servant the
[53:12] servant of elishah woke up and he looked
[53:15] outside and he saw that the mountains or
[53:18] and so forth they were they were
[53:19] surrounded Hallelujah with with horses
[53:22] and chariots and fear came about now
[53:26] there are things that are that are
[53:27] compassion life or or surround you and
[53:31] sometimes it brings fear but that's not
[53:33] what it's there for it's there so that
[53:37] you can see the realness of God come
[53:40] tangible in your life not for us to be
[53:43] afraid but God allows us to go into
[53:47] things or things happen just so we can
[53:49] see how real he
[53:51] is hallelujah and In This Moment the
[53:54] other the only other the purpose for
[53:57] them to be surrounded was to show that
[54:00] God can surround our
[54:03] enemy Hallelujah even when they couldn't
[54:06] even see it they were
[54:09] surrounded yes sir oh my but the man of
[54:13] God the servant of God he said oh my
[54:17] Elisha look we're surrounded now I want
[54:19] you to catch this this man Hallelujah
[54:23] had already seen a Vindicated Prophet
[54:27] that's right right
[54:31] yes if we go to chapter
[54:34] five chapter five is the story of
[54:37] non and non was a great man a great
[54:41] warrior a great Soldier and he was he
[54:43] was a general he was honorable among
[54:46] everybody but he was a leper right but
[54:50] then there was somebody who knew of a
[54:53] god Hall that could heal lepr
[54:57] Hallelujah W she knew something that
[55:01] nobody else knew she could see something
[55:04] about name's condition that nobody else
[55:07] could see she could see that the
[55:10] condition of leprosy would bring a God
[55:12] that's a Healer on the scene amen so
[55:15] what she did was she went to H uh the
[55:18] the the uh the woman she was serving as
[55:22] a hands made and say hey I know a God in
[55:25] Israel and I know that there's a prophet
[55:27] down there Hallelujah that can call on
[55:30] his God Amen and make the Unseen things
[55:34] Hallelujah become
[55:36] visible hallelujah amen all it took was
[55:41] a acceptance from
[55:44] nonon but nonon
[55:46] because he was already feeling so great
[55:50] and so proud when he went
[55:53] down he had a way in his mind he think
[55:57] that God ought to become visible yeah so
[56:00] what Hallelujah Elisha he came down to
[56:02] see Elisha and elijas didn't even come
[56:05] out to see him right that's it that's
[56:09] right but he sent a word yes amen glory
[56:13] I want you to understand if all God
[56:17] sends you is a word God is in that
[56:21] [Applause]
[56:23] word hallelujah you don't have to see a
[56:27] visible God all you have to do is take
[56:29] him for his
[56:33] word oh that's right because we're
[56:36] dealing with faith and faith is the
[56:39] assurance that God
[56:42] exist amen that's right amen right are
[56:45] you with me
[56:47] church and now Church neon comes down
[56:52] and he's saying all this and that and
[56:54] Elijah says hey just go dip in Jordan
[56:57] seven times Hallelujah see he's looking
[57:00] at it from a natural real yes and he's
[57:04] thinking Jordan's dirty Jordan's nasty
[57:08] but Elijah is looking at it saying the
[57:10] promise and Vindication of God is in
[57:13] that River if you just take my word for
[57:17] it you'll be made whole but he was
[57:19] looking at the
[57:21] circumstances too often we look at the
[57:24] circumstances and the circum ances in
[57:27] the natural May overshadow what God is
[57:31] don't look at it with your natural eye
[57:34] we're looking at the Unseen things where
[57:36] does it come from it comes from the Seed
[57:38] of
[57:41] Abraham thank you
[57:43] Lord oh my and
[57:47] church what looked like it was
[57:50] nothing God was in it
[57:53] amen hallelujah and sometimes things are
[57:56] so simple yes because it's so simple we
[57:59] miss
[58:01] it even but Paul I'm going Jump Ahead a
[58:04] little bit even right
[58:07] now everything you need is
[58:11] here but you may think that's right why
[58:14] ain't nobody jumping why ain't nobody
[58:16] shouting that doesn't mean it's not
[58:21] here hallelujah Faith Hallelujah doesn't
[58:26] solely rely on your emotions right amen
[58:31] now don't get me wrong I'm not here to
[58:34] criticize or like we say in my culture
[58:37] dis Hall diss emotions Hallelujah
[58:42] because if I feel like shouting I'm
[58:44] going to shout if I feel like dancing
[58:46] I'm going to dance hall and I may be
[58:49] shouting and dancing and you may be
[58:51] wondering Hallelujah why am I doing it
[58:54] you can't see what I
[58:59] see it's my own personal
[59:02] experience so you may be looking at me
[59:04] you may be thinking that's not necessary
[59:07] you don't know what I'm going through
[59:10] and you don't know the deliverances that
[59:12] God has brought in my
[59:14] life so if you see someone dancing and
[59:17] shouting don't criticize it ask God to
[59:20] open your
[59:21] eyes not your lit your eyes but your
[59:24] understanding
[59:26] am Hallelujah you know we do that too
[59:30] often we'll see something going on and
[59:32] we're like why is he doing that why is
[59:35] she doing that it may not be for you to
[59:42] understand oh does that sit well with
[59:46] you one thing I realize in church you
[59:49] know a lot of times we have too many
[59:53] chiefs and not enough Indians
[59:57] right well everybody knows what our next
[1:00:01] step or next move should be when God
[1:00:05] already has an
[1:00:06] order amen the easiest thing Hallelujah
[1:00:12] but we make it the hardest thing is to
[1:00:16] follow amen did you know following is
[1:00:20] the easiest
[1:00:22] thing what stops us from following the
[1:00:25] way we understand or what we can
[1:00:27] see Hallelujah I tell you right now say
[1:00:31] hey I want to drive from here back to
[1:00:34] the Carolinas and right there every
[1:00:38] piece of reasoning you got will give you
[1:00:40] a reason not to follow
[1:00:43] me man that drive going to be three days
[1:00:46] and you go on and on and on and won't
[1:00:49] even know if it'll be a supernatural
[1:00:54] event we could get outside of Canada and
[1:00:57] get
[1:00:58] translated but you miss that because
[1:01:01] you're leaning on what you can see and
[1:01:02] how you understand with God expect the
[1:01:08] impossible with God hallelujah he can do
[1:01:12] things that our own human reasoning
[1:01:15] can't
[1:01:17] understand so we ought to be willing to
[1:01:20] go where God
[1:01:21] leads and I'm not saying follow me back
[1:01:24] to South Carolina
[1:01:27] but that's just an illustration yeah
[1:01:28] yeah but we look church at the servant I
[1:01:32] want you to catch the scene of the
[1:01:33] servant the servant now he looks out the
[1:01:37] window or maybe opens the door or
[1:01:39] whatever and now he sees all these
[1:01:41] horses and chariots and he's like oh my
[1:01:44] God in his heart of hearts he's thinking
[1:01:47] we're going to
[1:01:50] die this is a man who's walked with the
[1:01:54] supernatural
[1:01:57] amen he was there naming one two three
[1:02:04] full dipping seven times in the River
[1:02:06] Jordan and walking out whole I believe
[1:02:10] the Bible say his skin came back like
[1:02:12] the skin of a
[1:02:14] [Music]
[1:02:16] baby if you've ever seen God move like
[1:02:19] that why would you ever a doubt
[1:02:26] I'll say it like
[1:02:28] this right now we're in a a space of
[1:02:31] time where things are becoming more and
[1:02:34] more
[1:02:35] challenging but it's happening that way
[1:02:38] because we're becoming more and more
[1:02:42] perfect hallelujah what do you think
[1:02:44] it's all about amen our trials are
[1:02:47] getting greater amen things are
[1:02:49] happening more people that we thought
[1:02:51] were real Believers are stepping away
[1:02:53] what is happening the perfecting of the
[1:02:55] Bride is being
[1:02:59] manifest
[1:03:01] Hallelujah but the thing we have to be
[1:03:04] careful
[1:03:05] about is being in the midst of it and
[1:03:09] not having an experience with it
[1:03:11] right because this man the
[1:03:15] servant he was in the midst of it he was
[1:03:19] right there with Elisha dealing with non
[1:03:21] and and probably previous things onto
[1:03:23] that he was right there he saw God he
[1:03:25] knew God was real but when it came time
[1:03:28] for him to believe he was
[1:03:31] afraid amen and I
[1:03:35] love how the prophet dealt with
[1:03:38] him the prophet didn't like you and I
[1:03:41] rebuke
[1:03:43] him rebuke him for not believing amen
[1:03:48] amen call him a a wishy-washy slow to
[1:03:52] believe believer no he didn't do that
[1:03:55] and sometimes when people don't see
[1:03:56] things like we do we get we we jump way
[1:03:59] out there they might be serpent
[1:04:03] [Music]
[1:04:05] seed Elijah see that that's my greatest
[1:04:09] problem with all the different doctrines
[1:04:11] we
[1:04:12] have if you believe your Doctrine is
[1:04:15] right why separate from me convince me
[1:04:19] amen right yes convince me don't try to
[1:04:23] tear up my church just be a l L be a
[1:04:27] lamb and if it's really of God if it's
[1:04:29] you Hallelujah if God is using you wait
[1:04:32] till your turn comes don't try to tear
[1:04:34] my church don't try to tear me up but if
[1:04:36] it's real God will convince
[1:04:40] me but because most of the doctrines are
[1:04:43] not real it brings
[1:04:45] chaos right it brings separation it
[1:04:48] brings hatred it brings envy and
[1:04:50] jealousy and all these things why
[1:04:52] because it's not the character of God
[1:04:55] amen that's right
[1:04:58] Hallelujah but I believe hallu that's
[1:05:01] why I could I could I could go witness
[1:05:03] to
[1:05:04] atheist Hallelujah cuz I believe what I
[1:05:07] got is real I have an assurance you tell
[1:05:10] me you're atheist atheist I'm not you
[1:05:11] going to hell
[1:05:13] no I ain't doing that cuz that atheist
[1:05:17] might be a believer that's right because
[1:05:19] if I could say it plain Hallelujah every
[1:05:22] disciple looked like an atheist until
[1:05:24] they met Jesus
[1:05:28] W but the only one that was really
[1:05:31] trying to serve God was Paul everybody
[1:05:35] else was just a flat rank sinner yes sir
[1:05:39] Hallelujah everybody else God had to
[1:05:41] really deal with it Peter love the fight
[1:05:44] and
[1:05:49] cuss amen don't turn The Blood Hound
[1:05:54] loose but
[1:05:56] but Church what we do too often we judge
[1:05:59] it before it's time when we are to let
[1:06:02] things unfold
[1:06:04] spiritually instead of what our eyes see
[1:06:08] and this young man he walked with the
[1:06:10] prophet he was there experiencing the
[1:06:13] supernatural all these things but when
[1:06:15] it came his chance to believe he was

[1:06:31] eyes so that he can see who's with us
[1:06:34] hallelujah amen and look the king he
[1:06:37] came with horses and chariots but when

[1:08:39] God vindicating to you that you are on
[1:08:42] the right
[1:08:45] path Hallelujah that's why God came down
[1:08:49] and Open the Eyes of the servant he
[1:08:52] could have just left it with the eyes of
[1:08:53] the Prophet being open but he wanted
[1:08:55] those him who was following that Prophet
[1:08:58] to know that God is with him

[1:15:35] before I go any
[1:15:37] further I'm G to make a
[1:15:40] statement really I can close on the
[1:15:46] statement God was a
[1:15:49] redeemer before the foundation of the
[1:15:51] world
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:15:55] that's right and every other attribute
[1:15:57] of him he was that before the foundation
[1:16:00] of the
[1:16:01] world Hallelujah so you think about what
[1:16:05] you need he's already provided that's
[1:16:09] right
[1:16:10] amen
[1:16:12] amen amen the easiest but the hardest
[1:16:16] thing for us to do is to say Lord I
[1:16:20] accept anybody pay their
[1:16:23] tithes you're already
[1:16:26] blessed thank you cuz that's a
[1:16:29] promise hallelujah we're not looking at
[1:16:31] the bank account we're looking at the
[1:16:33] promise of the word and if I ain't got
[1:16:36] it God will make sure it get to me why
[1:16:39] because he cannot deny his
[1:16:44] word thank you Lord amen but if you're
[1:16:46] living in a natural real Hallelujah
[1:16:49] you'll find yourself
[1:16:51] stagnant yes by what you see amen what

[1:17:01] Earthbound
[1:17:03] right but I want to live in a whole
[1:17:05] another real yes
[1:17:07] sir hallelujah amen but when we think
[1:17:11] about God being God before the
[1:17:13] foundation of the world before anything
[1:17:16] else was ever done or created on Earth
[1:17:19] he was that amen W Hallelujah Glory
[1:17:26] he was that now I'm speaking to your
[1:17:29] need he is that hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:34] before the Earth was created before you
[1:17:37] was created he is what you need
[1:17:43] already but what happens he allows
[1:17:46] certain situations to happen so what's
[1:17:49] in you can come out and become
[1:17:52] visible right hallelujah amen see uh me
[1:17:56] and brother Jeff we were talking I am

[1:24:51] what I was waiting on
[1:24:54] but something that was stirring on the
[1:24:58] inside of
[1:24:59] her became
[1:25:03] manifest what was it
[1:25:06] Grace and she said to my brother she
[1:25:08] said well look the next time you're

[1:25:35] Grace and from there I realized that
[1:25:39] something was going on inside Mama that
[1:25:42] the natural eye couldn't
[1:25:43] see and it got greater and greater more
[1:25:47] understanding came more grace came like
[1:25:49] she still I'll give it to you now but
[1:25:52] some when she used to wouldn't talk talk
[1:25:54] it out she would talk it out you know
[1:25:57] she wanted to understand where we were
[1:25:58] coming from
[1:26:00] parents understand where they coming
[1:26:02] from before you go upside the head amen
[1:26:06] oh I'm
[1:26:07] sorry we don't do
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:12] that Hallelujah but Church uh what I'm
[1:26:15] saying is as you get closer to God more
[1:26:19] of God comes out of you and nobody even
[1:26:23] right now
[1:26:25] nobody can really say who has the Holy
[1:26:29] Ghost only God can but the Bible says by
[1:26:33] their fruit amen you know
[1:26:36] them Hallelujah if you amen come to
[1:26:40] church uh once a week or twice every
[1:26:42] month and you off something wrong with
[1:26:46] that that mean that you have desires or
[1:26:49] hungers for other things else there's
[1:26:51] something going on in you in the Unseen
[1:26:53] real and is become invisible by your
[1:26:56] actions right amen
[1:26:59] hallelujah but as we look at we see that
[1:27:02] faith is the Assurance of things hope
[1:27:04] for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:27:07] Hallelujah so real Faith amen brings
[1:27:11] forth real evidence
[1:27:13] amenah and like I said with Abraham even
[1:27:16] in his mistakes God was still there to
[1:27:19] protect his
[1:27:21] promise now before I close
[1:27:25] why do we go through trials so that we
[1:27:27] can be
[1:27:29] perfected cuz there's something about
[1:27:32] you there's a picture or molding about
[1:27:35] you God is trying to show the
[1:27:37] world so he let Abraham go this way and
[1:27:41] do some wrong things why because he had
[1:27:44] to become the father of
[1:27:47] Faith Hallelujah and he couldn't do that
[1:27:50] with fear in his life he couldn't do
[1:27:52] that with a lying spirit in his life so
[1:27:55] God took him through trial that get rid
[1:27:57] of the fear God took him through trial
[1:28:00] that get rid of the lies hallelujah amen
[1:28:02] so church if you're going through
[1:28:04] something ask yourself what is God
[1:28:06] trying to bring out of
[1:28:08] me yes sir
[1:28:10] hallelujah look I had cancer in my
[1:28:14] brain why why did it happen what was it
[1:28:19] all about God was moving in the Unseen
[1:28:22] realm because cancer
[1:28:24] was the only thing that could bring out
[1:28:26] the
[1:28:28] Healer hallelujah hallelujah and I would
[1:28:31] have never known God was a Healer if I
[1:28:33] hadn't got cancer in my brain so that
[1:28:36] trial was to bring out the grace of
[1:28:40] God Amen and there are things in your
[1:28:43] life my life things that we go through
[1:28:45] that are not explainable but God is
[1:28:47] bringing out his
[1:28:49] attribute he's bringing out who he is
[1:28:52] any unchanged real yeah but we have to
[1:28:55] be like Abraham the Bible says he called
[1:28:58] those things that are not as though they
[1:29:02] were unseen
[1:29:06] amen I'm about to
[1:29:09] close you said brother de what is
[1:29:13] it what's really going on well I say it
[1:29:17] like
[1:29:19] this this is what the prophet of God
[1:29:21] says if you don't mind me reading this
[1:29:25] listen he says in God's
[1:29:28] provision for Divine Healing was on the
[1:29:30] basis of Faith somebody say amen amen
[1:29:34] and thus the same way he heals them
[1:29:37] tonight is the basis of Faith yes amen
[1:29:41] amen now he's using healing but Faith
[1:29:44] operates everything else too
[1:29:47] righten Hallelujah Faith operates
[1:29:51] Deliverance yes Faith operates love love
[1:29:54] peace and all the other attributes of
[1:29:57] God hallelujah when you're looking at
[1:29:59] the pyramid Hallelujah the statue of a
[1:30:01] perfect man what does it deal with
[1:30:03] what's the bottom of
[1:30:06] it Hallelujah Faith that's right
[1:30:10] everything builds upon faith faith is
[1:30:13] the
[1:30:15] substance amen you can have no brotherly
[1:30:19] kindness without
[1:30:21] faith Hallelujah
[1:30:25] amen right listen he says no matter how
[1:30:29] great a man if Christ himself was
[1:30:32] standing here on the pull pit with the
[1:30:36] suit that he gave me if he was standing
[1:30:39] here in the suit he could not heal you
[1:30:42] not at all why he has already done
[1:30:49] [Applause]
[1:30:50] it anybody got a need tonight
[1:30:54] amen
[1:30:55] hallelujah amen he has already done
[1:31:01] it
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:03] Hallelujah for those of you who were
[1:31:05] afraid to raise your
[1:31:07] hand Hallelujah I don't know what you

[1:31:13] provided he's already done it he just
[1:31:16] want me to accept Lord I Thank you for
[1:31:20] doing what you do
[1:31:24] hallelujah amen oh my remember we said a
[1:31:30] while ago that before the world was ever
[1:31:33] framed Hallelujah he was already what
[1:31:36] we're talking about right so whatever
[1:31:39] you need God has already done it we just
[1:31:42] have to accept it and play
[1:31:45] out walk through
[1:31:48] it you say Brother D what what what well
[1:31:51] how are we coming into it if God is Not
[1:31:54] doing it God is no longer working
[1:31:57] remember that last day what did he do he
[1:32:03] rested amen God ain't working no more
[1:32:06] he's just putting you Hallelujah in the
[1:32:08] path of your blessing and as you reach
[1:32:11] it you accept it because it's already
[1:32:20] there amen amen are you catching me
[1:32:24] amen see we we we struggle so much and I
[1:32:28] got to fast I got to pray and yes I
[1:32:30] believe in those
[1:32:31] things let me tell you something about
[1:32:34] fasting I'm a steward of
[1:32:38] fasting most of every time I've been in
[1:32:40] a serious need I go into fasting and God
[1:32:44] answers my prayer Hallelujah so when you
[1:32:48] find the tools that work in your life
[1:32:50] the prophet of God said if you go back
[1:32:52] and meet those conditions it'll happen
[1:32:54] that way every
[1:32:56] time Hallelujah so I don't try to do
[1:32:59] anything different I just go back to
[1:33:01] what God has already blessed hallelujah
[1:33:05] amen if it's you getting down on your
[1:33:07] knees and closing the door and putting
[1:33:10] on some music or whatever you do and God
[1:33:11] answers your prayer go back to that
[1:33:14] again because he can't
[1:33:16] change God has to remain the same the
[1:33:19] only thing that changes Is Us and how we
[1:33:22] see God but God remains the
[1:33:24] if he answers you one way one time he
[1:33:27] has to answer you that way all the
[1:33:29] [Applause]
[1:33:33] time when we think about faith we put
[1:33:37] our own reasoning in it look church when
[1:33:39] Jesus was walking out there on the water
[1:33:42] and Peter saw it first they said it's a
[1:33:45] spirit yeah it was a holy
[1:33:48] spirit hallelujah hallelujah but what
[1:33:51] was God going to do God was going to
[1:33:53] bring out something unseen that was in
[1:33:56] Peter he didn't know was there but God
[1:33:59] had to do it in a in a way that seem
[1:34:02] impossible now he's walking out of the
[1:34:04] water and Peter says Lord if that's you
[1:34:07] bid me to
[1:34:08] come he didn't say wait till the Revival
[1:34:11] Services he didn't say go pray seven
[1:34:13] weeks go fast three days he said come
[1:34:17] hallelujah amen amen amen I'm going to
[1:34:20] I'm going to show you the very thing
[1:34:23] that your believing is
[1:34:26] tangible Hallelujah now you got to think
[1:34:29] about it Peter is seeing a man do
[1:34:31] something he's never seen before but he
[1:34:34] has faith in
[1:34:37] God that's the only way he can step out
[1:34:39] there because he knew that Jesus was
[1:34:42] real and now he steps out there he said
[1:34:45] Lord he might have put one foot out
[1:34:47] there to test it out and that ocean was
[1:34:51] solid took another step
[1:34:54] H and another step now one thing you got
[1:34:57] to be mindful
[1:34:59] of as long as he was stepping his ey was
[1:35:01] on
[1:35:03] Jesus and as long as he was stepping his
[1:35:05] pathway was solid cuz he was looking at
[1:35:08] Jesus nothing else could get his
[1:35:10] attention his eyes was on Jesus I wonder
[1:35:13] how many of us as we walking this life
[1:35:15] Journey our eyes are on Jesus you keep
[1:35:18] your eyes on Jesus and your pathway will
[1:35:21] remain
[1:35:22] silent it'll be strong enough to hold
[1:35:25] you and now he's walking he's walking he
[1:35:28] get out there to Jesus and he's like oh
[1:35:30] man then he looks around maybe he a wind
[1:35:34] comes and hits him knocks him out
[1:35:36] balance and and all these things then
[1:35:37] fear sinks in and he starts to
[1:35:41] sink and he reaches his hand out to
[1:35:44] Christ Christ grabs him now this is the
[1:35:47] scene we've
[1:35:49] left I want to ask you something how did
[1:35:53] Peter get back back in the
[1:35:56] boat I don't believe Jesus put him on
[1:35:58] his
[1:36:00] shoulder say man you ain't got no faith
[1:36:03] put him on his shoulders say come on
[1:36:04] let's get back in the boat the same way
[1:36:06] you got out here is the same way you
[1:36:08] going to get
[1:36:09] back Hallelujah so if you seeking a
[1:36:11] little bit tonight Reach Out Hallelujah
[1:36:14] reach out and grab Jesus cuz the same
[1:36:17] Jesus that call you out there is the
[1:36:19] same Jesus that'll take you back hallah
[1:36:26] yes
[1:36:28] Lord
[1:36:30] hallelujah he didn't put Peter on his on
[1:36:33] his shoulders in the midst of his
[1:36:34] Struggle No he grabbed him by the hand
[1:36:37] pulled him up ey level and said come on
[1:36:39] Peter follow
[1:36:41] me hallelujah what are you saying
[1:36:44] brother digs Peter always had the
[1:36:48] ability to walk on
[1:36:50] water he just needed to meet Jesus right
[1:36:57] there
[1:36:59] yes
[1:37:01] amen great

[1:37:35] and I made a step the things that I've
[1:37:37] read about the things that I've heard
[1:37:40] about now has become intangible by my
[1:37:42] faith and I'm walking out there I'm out

[1:38:50] not heal you not at all he has already
[1:38:53] already done it now this is what I like
[1:38:56] and this is where we fall church he
[1:38:59] said he might do something to convince
[1:39:03] you or point you to the word and that
[1:39:07] would be convincing and he might show
[1:39:10] through some Divine gift that he was
[1:39:13] Christ but he could not heal you see so

[1:50:24] things that God has done hallelujah four
[1:50:27] four year 4 years ago you couldn't see
[1:50:29] yourself sitting in a church hallelujah
[1:50:32] praise the Lord but here you are what is
[1:50:34] it it's the grace of God what is it it's
[1:50:38] the Unseen things Jeff what was he a Son
[1:50:42] of
[1:50:44] God hallelujah the devil say no I made
[1:50:48] him leave and all these things but here
[1:50:50] you are you and your whole family what
[1:50:54] is it is the Unseen Things become
[1:50:58] invisible the grace of God the mercy of
[1:51:02] God coming through a
[1:51:07] trial and what I like to say and this
[1:51:11] may be a shocker to you Hallelujah some
[1:51:13] of us go through things and it look like
[1:51:16] oh my God y'all be looking at like oh my
[1:51:19] God he does she that she does and you
[1:51:22] know we look at and we look at it the
[1:51:23] wrong way because the very thing that
[1:51:26] you may think disqualifies me actually
[1:51:29] qualifies
[1:51:30] [Music]
[1:51:33] me oh my oh that didn't go over
[1:51:38] good cuz some of you want to pin one
[1:51:40] another down by a quot or by this or by
[1:51:43] that Hallelujah don't we realize Paul
[1:51:46] persecuted the church why that was the
[1:51:49] grace of
[1:51:50] God right amen
[1:51:53] God had to let him be a persecutor just
[1:51:55] to get him on that horse to knock him
[1:52:00] off that's right oh
[1:52:05] my disqualified to be
[1:52:10] qualified and when the prophet preached
[1:52:13] Masterpiece he said it was the
[1:52:16] flaw that made it a
[1:52:19] masterpiece forgive me for my flaws
[1:52:23] but it's my struggles and it's the
[1:52:24] things that I can't explain but I'm
[1:52:27] still believing God that makes me a
[1:52:31] masterpiece there the things you can't
[1:52:33] explain but you still believe in God
[1:52:36] that makes you a
[1:52:39] masterpiece because it was the flaw
[1:52:42] Michelangelo looked at it and everything
[1:52:44] that was in his mind was looking right
[1:52:46] back in me he said speak to me
[1:52:49] amen amen hallelujah

[1:53:14] remember that young man walked with the
[1:53:17] prophet but he didn't have the same
[1:53:18] experience as the prophet that's right
[1:53:21] Hallelujah even though God was with him
[1:53:23] also he couldn't see it and God had to
[1:53:25] open his eyes I guarantee you from that
[1:53:27] day he was
[1:53:29] different cuz he was saying Lord you're
[1:53:31] not just with you're not just with
[1:53:33] Elisha you're with me amen look Church
[1:53:36] Hallelujah Elijah didn't even go look he
[1:53:39] already knew God was with
[1:53:42] him Hallelujah so who was that trial for
