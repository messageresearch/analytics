[45:44] uh if I'm not mistaken this is number
[45:47] 20 of the study of the exposition of the
[45:51] seven Church
[45:53] ages and we're just about uh through the
[45:57] Ephesian Church age Revelations 2:1 says
[46:02] unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus
[46:04] write these things saith he that holdeth
[46:08] the Seven Stars in his right hand who
[46:11] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[46:14] candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy
[46:17] labor and thy patience and how thou CST
[46:20] not bear them which are evil and thou
[46:23] Hast tried them which say they are
[46:25] Apostles and are not and H has found
[46:29] them
[46:30] liars and Hast borne and Hast patience
[46:34] and for my name's sake has labored and
[46:36] Hast not fainted nevertheless I have
[46:39] somewhat against thee because thou Hast
[46:42] left thy First Love remember therefore
[46:46] whence Thou Art fallen and
[46:49] repent and do the first works or else I
[46:53] will come unto thee quickly and will
[46:56] remove thy Candlestick out of his place
[46:58] except thou
[47:00] repent but this thou Hast that thou
[47:03] hatest the Deeds of the
[47:05] nicians which I also
[47:08] hate he that hath an ear let him hear
[47:12] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[47:15] to him that overcometh will I give to
[47:18] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[47:21] midst of the paradise of god let's just
[47:25] bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord
[47:29] in our carnal Minds Lord we look forward
[47:32] to that day where we could sit under the
[47:34] shade of that tree of life Lord Jesus
[47:39] and eat of the fruit of that tree in the
[47:42] shade Lord knowing that we have no more
[47:45] sin no more Temptation no more sickness
[47:48] sadness sorrow or grief or
[47:51] problems Lord Jesus that day when we're
[47:54] in
[47:55] Paradise but father we know that this
[47:59] scripture applies to us in our day and
[48:02] that there is a tree of life and that
[48:05] Lord Jesus we don't need to wait to be
[48:07] in another dimension to pick and eat of
[48:09] that tree and tonight father our desire
[48:13] is to eat of that tree and father we
[48:16] pray that you would feed us from that
[48:18] tree One More Time Lord Jesus that
[48:21] father we would be able to just draw
[48:23] that much closer to you while we are
[48:26] here we love you and we thank you for
[48:28] your word Lord we know that you sent it
[48:30] to us and father you tied up all the
[48:33] loose ends for us in the day in which we
[48:35] live and we know that this word applies
[48:37] to us even today help us Lord Jesus we
[48:41] pray to overcome that we will eat of
[48:43] that tree even tonight father we just
[48:46] Commit This service now into your hands
[48:48] For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we
[48:51] pray amen God bless you tonight you may
[48:54] be
[48:55] seated
[49:00] I apologize if I cough a little I seem
[49:03] to be contending with a little tickle in
[49:06] my
[49:07] throat but that just seems to be the way
[49:09] it
[49:10] goes are you happy
[49:20] tonight hopefully that will be it once
[49:23] we get a little bit warmed
[49:25] upen I I uh certainly appreciate the
[49:28] scripture tonight and uh picking up
[49:31] where we left off last week um paragraph
[49:36] 123 it starts out with Revelations 2:7
[49:40] the voice of the spirit is what brother
[49:44] Branham talks about in this book here
[49:46] and uh Revelations 2 verse 7 it says he
[49:52] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[49:55] spirit saith unto the ch churches to him
[49:58] that overcometh will I give to eat of
[50:01] the tree of life which is in the midst
[50:03] of the paradise of God he that hath an
[50:06] ear I just think it's so beautiful I
[50:08] took a little look at the Amplified
[50:11] Bible just to maybe give it a little bit
[50:13] of a parallel view tonight it says he
[50:17] who is able to hear let him listen to
[50:22] and give heed to what the spirit says to
[50:26] the assembly mes churches to him who
[50:30] overcomes is
[50:32] Victorious excuse me I will grant to eat
[50:35] of the fruit of the tree of life which
[50:38] is in the paradise of God isn't that
[50:42] just a wonderful thought in the
[50:44] Amplified Bible it takes you back to
[50:46] Genesis 2:9 and 3 verse 24 and we know
[50:51] that that was a time of perfection in
[50:54] Eden it was before the defil M of of man
[50:58] before the fall of
[51:01] Man but you know he that
[51:04] overcometh that's the one that's going
[51:06] to be able to be granted to eat from
[51:09] that tree of life and what do we have to
[51:12] overcome in our day brothers and sisters
[51:15] most of all being in the leoan church
[51:18] age the last age what we have to
[51:20] overcome is
[51:22] ourselves because we're rich compared to
[51:25] the world Maybe even compared to where
[51:27] we were when we were young many of us
[51:30] didn't have very much when we grew up
[51:31] even here in Calgary Rich increased with
[51:35] goods and have need of
[51:37] nothing but you know that is the curse
[51:40] of the leodan age because the Lord says
[51:44] that you don't know it but you're naked
[51:46] and you're blind and you're poor and you
[51:49] don't even know it you don't even know
[51:52] where you are a and we know we could go
[51:55] a long ways with with that the two on
[51:57] the road to emus Jesus the one they were
[51:59] following they recognized him his voice
[52:02] when he finally decided to reveal
[52:04] himself to them but outside of a
[52:06] revelation of God we will not be able to
[52:09] understand him and that's why I think
[52:11] it's so beautiful just a little bit of a
[52:12] recap here about the Deeds of the
[52:14] nicians we read it in the scripture
[52:16] tonight the Ephesian Church age they
[52:18] stood against those Apostles those
[52:21] people that called themselves Apostles
[52:24] but they were able to see that they were
[52:25] Liars and how does brother Bram say that
[52:28] he said they weren't in line with the
[52:31] word they wanted to substitute Holy
[52:34] Ghost leadership of the church with
[52:36] leadership of men they began to organize
[52:39] they began to say that we have to
[52:42] protect this word we have to organize
[52:44] and create an environment for it to
[52:46] thrive but what we don't understand when
[52:49] we get going down that road is it's a
[52:51] soft subtle spirit it's a nickan spirit
[52:54] that wants to gain control it wants to
[52:57] get a foothold in the church and try and
[53:00] start controlling things by man and push
[53:04] aside the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[53:06] and you know brothers and sisters that
[53:08] is not just exclusive to the Ephesian
[53:11] Church age that is very much alive and
[53:13] well today the nician spirit wants to
[53:16] control the church but as long as we're
[53:19] here I believe it it's a church full of
[53:21] Believers we're not going to give an
[53:23] inch to the devil we're not going to
[53:24] give him one iota of room to rule over
[53:28] the church it's going to be holy ghost
[53:30] leadership or none right we know that
[53:34] the church will actually disintegrate if
[53:35] it turns into the leadership of men and
[53:39] you know what will happen is it will
[53:40] mislead people before long what happens
[53:43] is that church WIll begin to follow suit
[53:45] with
[53:46] Rome and uh we'll get into that I I get
[53:49] a little bit ahead of myself here I
[53:50] apologize we've got Easter meetings this
[53:52] weekend with Brother David Dean har he's
[53:54] on the road he's driving here from Idaho
[53:57] and uh he left this morning so we'll
[54:00] have service Friday night we'll have uh
[54:02] service Saturday night and Sunday
[54:04] morning service and uh we certainly
[54:07] trust the Lord will bless our services
[54:09] April the 7th we have a special guest
[54:11] Minister that I'm real excited about and
[54:14] that is brother mvin Panetta he's going
[54:16] to take a Sunday morning service it's
[54:18] something that we talked about with the
[54:20] ministers and uh you know it's it's
[54:22] important for the ministry here in the
[54:24] body to be able to minister in in an
[54:27] environment that will give them the
[54:28] opportunity to thrive when we are
[54:31] ministers we have to be able to minister
[54:34] when we're musicians we have to be able
[54:36] to express the gift that God's given us
[54:38] and you know if we can't do that if we
[54:40] can't express the gift then it starts to
[54:43] become a little bit difficult so we're
[54:45] certainly excited to hear what the Lord
[54:47] has placed on brother mervin's heart
[54:49] April the 7th then we have brother Nest
[54:51] ESP penia from Philippines here April
[54:54] 20th and 21st there will be a 600 p.m.
[54:57] service Saturday night and 10:00 a.m.
[54:59] Sunday morning June the 2nd we have
[55:02] brother Dela adadon and he is a pastor
[55:06] from Nigeria certainly excited to see
[55:09] him again and uh greet him and hear what
[55:12] the Lord has placed on his heart we have
[55:16] uh another announcement that I wanted to
[55:17] bring and that is a a little bit of a
[55:19] Revival in Lethbridge and that's planned
[55:22] for April 12th 13th and 14th that's a
[55:26] Friday night service a Saturday and a
[55:30] Sunday and I believe there's going to be
[55:31] a one service on Friday three services
[55:34] on Saturday and one service on Sunday it
[55:38] seems the word of God is taking root in
[55:40] Lethbridge and there's some fairly
[55:42] stable solid Believers there and who
[55:46] knows what the Lord will continue to do
[55:48] there we want to continue trying to
[55:50] support the work there and just see what
[55:52] the Lord will do I've been invited to
[55:54] preach on the 12th
[55:56] which is Friday night um I believe a
[56:00] couple of the brothers are going to
[56:01] minister on Saturday as well as brother
[56:03] Jerry Fury from Spruce Grove and then
[56:06] brother Jerry Fury is also going to take
[56:08] the Sunday service there so pray for the
[56:10] meetings in Lethbridge pray for the
[56:12] people in Lethbridge and just see what
[56:14] the Lord will do
[56:16] there excuse me the other thing I want
[56:19] to mention is we have the uh regular
[56:21] prayer meetings now scheduled for the
[56:22] first Thursday of every month and that
[56:24] will be starting April the 4th and we'll
[56:26] just continue on with that sorry about
[56:29] the announcements getting in the way of
[56:31] the word um I just get excited about the
[56:34] word and forget the business side of
[56:36] things so Hallelujah I
[56:38] apologize you know uh just a little bit
[56:41] of a recap like we were talking about
[56:42] the seed of nianis from the uh the last
[56:46] few chapters that we read the last few
[56:49] paragraphs we know that uh the nicians
[56:52] the word comes from two Greek words it's
[56:55] naika which means to conquer and lay us
[56:58] which means the leoty brother Bram says
[57:00] in plain fact somebody was doing
[57:01] something in that early church which was
[57:04] Conquering the leoty if the leoty were
[57:07] being conquered then it must have been
[57:09] some Authority there doing it and and we
[57:13] know that that's what God
[57:16] hated he hated that the leadership of
[57:19] the Holy Spirit was pushed pushed aside
[57:22] and they decided to organize and and
[57:25] bring man and to actually try and and
[57:28] get it together but the word of God
[57:30] doesn't need men to defend it you know
[57:33] just going back a little
[57:35] bit it's uh paragraph
[57:38] 95 actually 94 I'll read 94 I just
[57:41] wanted to recap on this just just
[57:43] because it's very important brother
[57:46] bromy says but as usual people don't
[57:48] heed God's warning that Revival fire
[57:50] built upon the sacred word is so
[57:52] wonderful and the manifestation of the
[57:55] spirit so blessed
[57:57] the little that a little fear Creeps in
[58:02] and a whisper in the heart says how can
[58:05] we protect this truth we
[58:08] have what can we do to see this revival
[58:12] goes
[58:13] on and he says this is vital brothers
[58:16] and sisters that is when the Antichrist
[58:19] Spirit comes in and Whispers look you
[58:23] have the truth now see that it doesn't
[58:25] get lost organize and set up your Creed
[58:27] of what you believe put it all in a
[58:30] church manual and they do it they
[58:31] organize they add to the word and they
[58:35] die just like Eve did for taking one
[58:38] wrong word it's God's word that brings
[58:40] life and it's not what we say about the
[58:44] word that counts but it's what God Said
[58:48] and he said only
[58:49] believe only believe that's all we need
[58:52] to
[58:53] do I just think it's so beautiful
[58:56] because brother Bram in the beginning of
[58:57] this book he says if you can identify
[59:00] the Antichrist spirit that creeps into
[59:02] the framework of the what the Christian
[59:06] church if you can discern and withstand
[59:08] that Spirit then Satan will be powerless
[59:11] before you who doesn't want Satan to be
[59:14] powerless tonight I just think it's so
[59:17] amazing we've been given this key this
[59:19] opportunity to go forwards I just want
[59:22] to read paragraph
[59:24] 111 um he brother bam he says this now I
[59:27] want to say that I believe in leadership
[59:30] he he he talks so strongly in the
[59:33] previous paragraphs this is what we read
[59:35] last week about the leadership of man
[59:37] over the church and now he brings the
[59:39] balance he says now I want to say that I
[59:42] believe in leadership but it's not the
[59:43] leadership of men that I believe in I
[59:46] believe in the leadership of the Holy
[59:48] Ghost coming through the word amen I
[59:51] believe also that God has sent men in
[59:54] the church men who are gifted by the
[59:58] spirit and they will keep the church in
[1:00:00] order I believe that I believe also that
[1:00:03] the church is ruled over by men that God
[1:00:05] sends to take
[1:00:07] charge but that rule is by the
[1:00:11] word so that it's not men really ruling
[1:00:14] but the spirit of God for the word and
[1:00:18] spirit are
[1:00:19] one I think it's just important for us
[1:00:22] brothers and sisters to remember that we
[1:00:24] can easily have an idea we can have a
[1:00:27] tradition we can have a thought that we
[1:00:31] we think is actually the way things
[1:00:33] should be but you know if it's not by
[1:00:35] the word I want to say this clearly I'm
[1:00:38] not interested and I don't think any one
[1:00:40] of us should be if it's not according to
[1:00:42] the word of God even though we've got a
[1:00:44] tradition or an idea a thought comes to
[1:00:46] us you know we have many thoughts that
[1:00:48] come to us we've got to be willing to
[1:00:51] take it back to the word and if that
[1:00:52] thought doesn't line up with the word
[1:00:54] what do we need to do put it aside we
[1:00:57] just need to push it aside and not take
[1:01:00] it and and try and put ourselves in a
[1:01:02] position where we just need to be right
[1:01:04] when we do that that's the same thing
[1:01:06] that Satan had in him from the beginning
[1:01:09] iniquity was found in his heart and what
[1:01:13] happens when we don't actually accept
[1:01:15] correction by the word of God it's pride
[1:01:17] in our life it's just Pride that gets in
[1:01:19] the way if we're truly Believers of this
[1:01:22] word then we will line up every single
[1:01:24] word of this word in in our lives we
[1:01:27] will not make substitutes we won't make
[1:01:28] excuses we'll say be it unto me
[1:01:31] according to Thy
[1:01:33] word carrying on
[1:01:35] tonight the voice of the spirit
[1:01:37] Revelations 2:7 he that hath an ear let
[1:01:40] him hear what the spirit saith to the
[1:01:41] churches to him that overcometh will I
[1:01:44] give to eat of the tree of life which is
[1:01:46] in the midst of the paradise of God what
[1:01:47] do we have to overcome we've got to
[1:01:49] overcome the Antichrist Spirit we've got
[1:01:51] to overcome the the the leoan age we've
[1:01:54] got to overcome many different things in
[1:01:56] our lives but honestly I think the
[1:01:58] biggest thing that we've talked about in
[1:01:59] the past and you know brother Don has
[1:02:01] mentioned it as well the biggest thing
[1:02:02] that we've got to overcome is
[1:02:04] ourselves to Humble ourselves in front
[1:02:07] of this word and how do we humble
[1:02:09] ourselves in front of this word how do
[1:02:11] we humble ourselves in the sight of God
[1:02:13] so that he can lift us up we humble
[1:02:15] ourselves before one
[1:02:17] another Jesus told his disciples how
[1:02:20] will the world know that you have love
[1:02:22] for me how do you love me you could say
[1:02:24] you love me all you want but your love
[1:02:26] life is going to show where you stand
[1:02:29] with
[1:02:30] that it's when you love one
[1:02:33] another that's when you show the world
[1:02:35] that's where the rubber meets the road
[1:02:37] that's the brass tax of it all when you
[1:02:39] can love those who don't love you when
[1:02:44] you can love your enemy even your enemy
[1:02:47] and say my goodness I I know that I had
[1:02:50] a prophet of God isn't it a blessing to
[1:02:51] think that we had a prophet we can say
[1:02:53] that we had a prophet many people will
[1:02:55] say oh the prophet now you're getting
[1:02:57] crazy and and I know we're talking to
[1:02:59] Believers here tonight but there's a lot
[1:03:00] of people that are watching these online
[1:03:03] now and when you talk about Prophet it's
[1:03:05] a bit weird because of all the false
[1:03:08] prophets that have gone out into the
[1:03:09] world and we know that scripture
[1:03:10] scripture says there's going to be many
[1:03:12] false prophets that go out they're
[1:03:13] ravening wolves dressed in sheep's
[1:03:15] clothing and what they've done is
[1:03:17] they've made a mess of it they've made
[1:03:18] people so afraid of the word Prophet
[1:03:21] that they will never go near anyone that
[1:03:23] talks about Prophet that declares
[1:03:25] prophet but a true prophet of God is
[1:03:27] always going to have thus sayith the
[1:03:28] Lord aren't they and that thus sayith
[1:03:30] the Lord is going to point back to the
[1:03:32] scripture he's going to say repent and
[1:03:34] get back to the word of God don't get
[1:03:36] back to your church Creeds or your
[1:03:37] Traditions he's going to say that but
[1:03:40] isn't it wonderful that we had a prophet
[1:03:42] we have a prophet a prophet that came
[1:03:44] and got us back to the word gave us the
[1:03:46] ability to be able to say my goodness I
[1:03:49] just want to line up with that word
[1:03:51] because I know that he actually went
[1:03:53] beyond the curtain of time twice once
[1:03:56] was to see the regions of the Lost he
[1:03:59] deliberately not deliberately he
[1:04:01] inadvertently went there God allowed him
[1:04:03] to go there when he got shot by that
[1:04:04] Shotgun by his friend the one time and
[1:04:07] he said I wouldn't wish that on my worst
[1:04:12] enemy but we've been given the
[1:04:14] opportunity to see beyond the curtain of
[1:04:15] time to recognize there was a bunch of
[1:04:18] people that actually said my precious
[1:04:21] brother that word that you preached that
[1:04:25] word that you you preached is what Paul
[1:04:26] preached and we're resting on that that
[1:04:28] is what our souls are hanging on and you
[1:04:32] know many people will say it I've I've
[1:04:34] heard it said you people believe this
[1:04:36] you people I heard it said specifically
[1:04:38] one time you people believe that there
[1:04:40] shouldn't be you know you guys believe
[1:04:42] that there shouldn't be women preachers
[1:04:43] and I said hold on a second hold on a
[1:04:45] second about you guys you people
[1:04:47] shouldn't believe that there shouldn't
[1:04:48] be women preachers that's not just what
[1:04:50] we say and that's not just what William
[1:04:53] bradam said that's what Paul said amen
[1:04:56] how can we believe the word of God and
[1:04:58] negate what Paul
[1:05:00] said if we start snipping out parts of
[1:05:03] the word what part are we going to keep
[1:05:05] we know that Revelation says that one
[1:05:07] word added to and one word taken away
[1:05:09] then all the plagues of this book will
[1:05:10] be added unto
[1:05:13] you we just want to stay in line with
[1:05:15] the word the voice of the spirit he that
[1:05:16] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:05:18] saith unto the churches not what men say
[1:05:21] not what churches say not what
[1:05:22] traditions say let's hear what the
[1:05:24] spirit says to the church brother bradam
[1:05:27] says in paragraph 123 he that hath an
[1:05:29] ear let them hear what the spirit saith
[1:05:30] unto the churches it may be that
[1:05:32] Millions will hear these words or read
[1:05:35] them but how many will pay heed to
[1:05:39] them that we do not know but he who will
[1:05:43] lend his ear and want to know the words
[1:05:45] of truth will find the spirit of God
[1:05:49] enlightening him amen if your ear is
[1:05:51] open to the word the spirit of God will
[1:05:54] make the word real to you and that's so
[1:05:58] beautiful it doesn't have to be real to
[1:05:59] everyone else just has to be real to me
[1:06:02] just has to be real to you it has to be
[1:06:03] personal and we know that's what the new
[1:06:05] birth is Christ himself revealing
[1:06:08] himself personally to the
[1:06:11] individual he says now that is a work of
[1:06:13] the spirit I can teach you the truth but
[1:06:17] if you don't
[1:06:19] open if you don't open your ear to hear
[1:06:21] it and your heart to receive it you
[1:06:24] won't get the revelation
[1:06:26] now notice it says that the spirit is
[1:06:28] speaking to the churches that is plural
[1:06:31] not singular the spirit did not have
[1:06:34] John write this down for a local
[1:06:37] Ephesian Church nor for the first age
[1:06:41] only this is what we were talking about
[1:06:43] last week it's for all the
[1:06:46] ages but this is the Church of the
[1:06:49] beginnings and thus it is like the Book
[1:06:51] of Genesis what started in Genesis holds
[1:06:53] true throughout the entire word and
[1:06:56] finally closes in Revelation thus this
[1:06:59] church beginning in Acts is God's
[1:07:02] blueprint for all ages until she closes
[1:07:05] out in the leoan age I I'm just so
[1:07:08] thankful I'm going to go back to that I
[1:07:09] just feel so encouraged by it don't you
[1:07:12] feel encouraged by it to know there is
[1:07:14] an anchor Point there's one place that
[1:07:16] we can go back to and it's the word of
[1:07:17] God to say this Ephesian Church age is
[1:07:20] the
[1:07:21] blueprint get back to Pentecost that's
[1:07:24] all we need to do not not try and have
[1:07:26] signs and wonders and make that all
[1:07:27] happen just follow the word amen get
[1:07:31] upstairs in that upper room until wait
[1:07:34] until you're unded with power from on
[1:07:37] high brother bradam says watch it
[1:07:39] carefully let every age take heed for
[1:07:43] what is going on here is only the start
[1:07:45] that little tree that was planted is
[1:07:48] going to grow it is grow going to grow
[1:07:52] Through the Ages this then is a message
[1:07:54] for every Christian through every age
[1:07:57] until Jesus comes yes it is for it is
[1:08:00] the spirit speaking amen and this little
[1:08:04] tree that's growing I just think it's
[1:08:06] interesting because you know it's the
[1:08:08] seed of nianis is what brother bram's
[1:08:10] talking about that's the tree that's
[1:08:12] growing it's the rulership over the
[1:08:14] church it's substituting the the power
[1:08:17] for programs it's saying that we need to
[1:08:19] organize and protect this word and try
[1:08:21] and do something with this word we don't
[1:08:22] have to do anything with this word
[1:08:24] except for believe it and preach it the
[1:08:26] way it was spoken The Way It Was Written
[1:08:29] God will do the
[1:08:30] rest but we can easily start getting in
[1:08:32] his
[1:08:33] way the reward promised paragraph 125 to
[1:08:38] him that overcometh will I give to eat
[1:08:39] of the tree of life which is in the
[1:08:41] midst of the paradise of God this is the
[1:08:44] future reward to all Overcomers of all
[1:08:47] ages when the last call to battle has
[1:08:50] been sounded when our armor has been
[1:08:53] laid down then we will rest in the
[1:08:55] paradise of God God and our portion
[1:08:59] shall be the tree of life forever amen
[1:09:03] the tree of life isn't that a beautiful
[1:09:07] figure of
[1:09:08] speech it's mentioned three times in the
[1:09:10] Book of Genesis and three times in the
[1:09:12] Book of Revelation in all six places it
[1:09:16] is the same tree and symbolizes exactly
[1:09:19] the same thing yes but what is the Tree
[1:09:23] of Life well first of all all we would
[1:09:26] have to know what the tree of life it
[1:09:29] the tree itself stands for in numbers
[1:09:33] 24:6 as balum described Israel he said
[1:09:38] there were trees of line allows which
[1:09:41] the Lord hath planted trees throughout
[1:09:45] the scriptures refer to persons as in
[1:09:49] Psalms 1 thus the Tree of Life must be
[1:09:53] the person of life and that is
[1:09:57] Jesus now in the Garden of Eden there
[1:10:00] were two trees standing in the midst of
[1:10:02] it one was the tree of life and the
[1:10:06] other was the tree of knowledge of good
[1:10:09] and
[1:10:10] evil man was to live by the tree of life
[1:10:14] but he was not to touch the other tree
[1:10:17] or he would die but man did partake of
[1:10:20] the other tree and when he did Death
[1:10:23] entered into him by his sin
[1:10:26] and he became separated from
[1:10:29] God I just love this part I got to tell
[1:10:32] you this this this part of the church
[1:10:35] age book is just so rich you know the
[1:10:39] the world ecumenical council the the
[1:10:43] churches in North America they turned
[1:10:46] their back on William brandham for this
[1:10:48] Doctrine when he started preaching this
[1:10:51] loud and clear without reservation they
[1:10:53] said oh no no no no now he's gone off on
[1:10:55] his Doctrine now he's off his rocker he
[1:10:58] he's he's fallen off his trolley there's
[1:11:00] something wrong with this man because
[1:11:02] who who would ever be able to say these
[1:11:04] words and and have the word of God line
[1:11:06] up with that but we know that it takes a
[1:11:08] revelation but when you can actually see
[1:11:11] what he's talking about here something
[1:11:13] happens inside of you you can never go
[1:11:15] back you can never unsee this
[1:11:19] Revelation paragraph 129 now that tree
[1:11:22] back there in Eden that tree which was
[1:11:25] the source of life was Jesus in John 6-8
[1:11:30] Jesus sets himself forth as the source
[1:11:33] of eternal life he called himself the
[1:11:36] bread from Heaven he spoke of giving
[1:11:39] himself and that if a man ate of him he
[1:11:43] would never die he proclaimed that he
[1:11:46] knew Abraham and that before Abraham he
[1:11:49] was he prophesied that he himself would
[1:11:53] give them Living Waters that if man
[1:11:56] drank he would never thirst again but
[1:11:59] would live eternally he showed himself
[1:12:02] as The Great I Am he is the bread of
[1:12:05] life The Well of Life The Eternal one
[1:12:09] the tree of life and we know that in his
[1:12:12] day the people said Naturally Speaking
[1:12:14] you know it was against the law of Moses
[1:12:16] goodness sakes eat your flesh and drink
[1:12:18] your blood this guy's crazy he's a
[1:12:22] vampire but we know that's what we did
[1:12:24] Sun night not literally but the
[1:12:28] figurative we had communion he goes on
[1:12:31] to say he was back there in Eden in the
[1:12:33] midst of the garden even as he will be
[1:12:36] in the midst of the paradise of God some
[1:12:39] have an idea that the two trees in the
[1:12:42] garden were just two more trees like
[1:12:43] unto the rest of those that God had
[1:12:46] placed there but careful students know
[1:12:49] that this is not so when John the
[1:12:52] Baptist cried that the axe was laid to
[1:12:55] the root of all trees he was not talking
[1:13:00] of Simply natural trees but of spiritual
[1:13:05] principles now in first John it says and
[1:13:09] this is the record that God hath given
[1:13:12] to us eternal life and this life is in
[1:13:16] his son this is 1 John 511 Jesus said
[1:13:20] and ye will not and ye will not come to
[1:13:23] me that ye might have life John
[1:13:26] 540 thus the record God's word States
[1:13:30] plainly and clearly that life eternal
[1:13:33] life is in the sun it's no other place 1
[1:13:38] John 5:12 he that hath the son hath life
[1:13:43] he that hath not the Son of God hath not
[1:13:47] life paragraph 132 now since the record
[1:13:51] cannot change be taken from or added
[1:13:54] there unto then the record stands that
[1:13:59] life is in the sun since this is so the
[1:14:04] tree in the garden has to be Jesus
[1:14:08] amen paragraph 133 all right if the tree
[1:14:12] of life is a
[1:14:14] person then the tree of knowledge of
[1:14:17] Good and Evil is a person
[1:14:21] also it can't be
[1:14:23] otherwise thus the righteous one and the
[1:14:27] wicked one stood side by side there in
[1:14:30] the midst of the Garden of
[1:14:32] Eden I just love the way that he writes
[1:14:35] this again he takes it right back to the
[1:14:37] scripture well how can you say that he
[1:14:39] was in the Garden of Eden Ezekiel
[1:14:41] 2813 thou Satan Hast been in Eden the
[1:14:46] Garden of Eden so what was he doing
[1:14:48] there in that Garden what was his
[1:14:52] purpose I'm sure that he lived a a
[1:14:55] purpose-filled life he had a a real
[1:14:58] driven
[1:15:02] experience he was created for a purpose
[1:15:06] yes paragraph 134 here is where we
[1:15:09] receive the true revelation of the
[1:15:10] Serpent's
[1:15:12] Seed here was what really happened in
[1:15:14] the Garden of Eden the word says that
[1:15:17] Eve was beguiled by the
[1:15:20] serpent she was actually seduced by the
[1:15:24] serpent
[1:15:25] and this is where I could say you know
[1:15:26] you can even ask Google just type in
[1:15:28] original sin see what comes up it won't
[1:15:30] be long before you're blushing now I'm
[1:15:32] not recommending that you do it just for
[1:15:34] the record children don't go do it but
[1:15:37] it's the way the world is the whole
[1:15:39] world knows what this is Genesis 3:1 now
[1:15:43] the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:15:44] beast of the field which the Lord God
[1:15:47] had
[1:15:47] made so we know it's a beast right we
[1:15:50] know he's created by God and we know
[1:15:53] that he's very very subtle
[1:15:55] a real
[1:15:57] Slicker paragraph 135 this Beast was so
[1:16:00] close to a human
[1:16:02] being and yet was pure
[1:16:05] animal that he could reason and
[1:16:08] talk he was an upright creature and was
[1:16:12] somewhat in between a chimpanzee and a
[1:16:14] man but closer to a
[1:16:17] man now outside of a prophet who's
[1:16:20] talking like this who is saying these
[1:16:23] words but taking it back to the
[1:16:25] scripture not just coming up with it and
[1:16:28] pulling it out of out of thin air he
[1:16:31] goes on to say he was so close to being
[1:16:33] human that his seed could and did mingle
[1:16:38] with that of the woman and caused her to
[1:16:42] conceive when this happened God cursed
[1:16:45] the
[1:16:46] serpent he changed every bone in the
[1:16:48] Serpent's body so that he had to crawl
[1:16:51] like a snake I remember having a
[1:16:53] conversation on the way to Kenya one
[1:16:55] time when you fly on a plane and long
[1:16:58] trips like that and you get seated by
[1:17:00] people you can have some pretty in-depth
[1:17:03] conversations you're there for seven or
[1:17:04] eight hours excluding taxi delays and
[1:17:08] and this one fellow he was from Kenya we
[1:17:12] got talking about this he was religious
[1:17:14] he was very well studied he knew his
[1:17:16] Bible but I had to ask him I said why
[1:17:18] was the serpent cursed to be the serpent
[1:17:21] why was the snake cursed to be a snake
[1:17:24] how could that be a curse how could he
[1:17:27] go from crawling on his belly and eating
[1:17:29] dust to crawling on his belly and eating
[1:17:31] dust as a
[1:17:33] curse there has to be more to that whole
[1:17:36] entire
[1:17:39] scripture brother Bram says when this
[1:17:41] happened God cursed the serpent he
[1:17:43] changed every bone on the Serpent's body
[1:17:44] so that he had to crawl like a snake
[1:17:48] science can try all it wants to and
[1:17:50] won't find the missing link how many
[1:17:52] years has science had to try and find
[1:17:54] that Missing
[1:17:56] Link and we know the tree of knowledge
[1:17:59] of Good and Evil ain't going to bring
[1:18:01] this Doctrine he's not going to bring
[1:18:03] this to the laboratory and say well this
[1:18:04] is actually what happened the serpent
[1:18:06] wasn't actually a snake the serpent was
[1:18:08] an upright being and and their seed
[1:18:10] mingled with Eve seed he's not going to
[1:18:12] bring that to the scientific community
[1:18:14] and broadcast that all around the world
[1:18:16] because it's going to expose Satan and
[1:18:19] he don't want to be
[1:18:20] exposed he wants to be just like God he
[1:18:23] wants to be just like like Jesus
[1:18:26] worshiped and we know that he is being
[1:18:29] worshiped he goes on to say God saw to
[1:18:31] that man is smart and he can see an
[1:18:35] association of man with animal and he
[1:18:38] tries to prove it out of evolution there
[1:18:41] isn't any Evolution but man and animal
[1:18:45] did mingle that's the one of the
[1:18:47] Mysteries that
[1:18:49] God that one of the mysteries of God
[1:18:53] that has remained hidden
[1:18:55] but here it is
[1:18:57] revealed it happened right back there in
[1:19:00] the midst of Eden when Eve turned away
[1:19:03] from life to accept death notice what
[1:19:07] God said to them in the garden Genesis
[1:19:10] 3:15 and I will put enity between thee
[1:19:13] and the woman and between thy seed and
[1:19:15] her seed it shall bruise thy head excuse
[1:19:19] me and shall bruise his
[1:19:23] heel I just think this is is fascinating
[1:19:25] here paragraph 136 if we give credit to
[1:19:28] the word that the woman did have a seed
[1:19:31] then the serpent must have shedly had a
[1:19:35] seed also if the seed of the woman was a
[1:19:39] Manchild apart from the man then the
[1:19:42] seed of the serpent will have to be in
[1:19:44] the same pattern and that is another
[1:19:47] male must be born apart from human male
[1:19:53] instrumentally there's no student who
[1:19:55] does not know that by the seed of the
[1:19:58] woman was the Christ sorry there's no
[1:20:02] student who does not know that the seed
[1:20:05] of the woman was the Christ who came by
[1:20:10] the instrumentality of God apart from
[1:20:13] Human intercourse it's also just as well
[1:20:17] known that the predicted bruising of the
[1:20:20] Serpent's head was in actuality a
[1:20:24] prophecy
[1:20:25] concerning what Christ would accomplish
[1:20:27] against Satan at the
[1:20:29] cross there at the cross Christ would
[1:20:32] bruise the head of Satan while Satan
[1:20:35] would bruise the heel of the
[1:20:39] Lord this portion of scripture is the
[1:20:42] revelation of how the literal seed of
[1:20:45] the serpent was sown in the earth even
[1:20:49] as we have the account of Luke 1
[1:20:53] 26-35 where in is set forth the exact
[1:20:56] account of how the seed of the woman
[1:20:59] came into physical
[1:21:01] manifestation apart from the
[1:21:04] instrumentality of the human
[1:21:08] male and we can read that Luke 1 126
[1:21:11] to35 excuse
[1:21:15] me so beautiful it's the same type as
[1:21:18] the believer today when the Lord comes
[1:21:23] around he he says in Luke uh
[1:21:26] 1:26 and in the sixth month the angel
[1:21:29] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[1:21:32] Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin a
[1:21:35] spouse to a man whose name was Joseph of
[1:21:37] the House of David and the virgin's name
[1:21:39] was Mary and the angel came in unto her
[1:21:42] and said hail thou that art highly
[1:21:45] favored the Lord is with the with thee
[1:21:49] blessed art thou among women remember
[1:21:52] the woman is the church female
[1:21:55] is the church and when she saw him she
[1:21:58] was troubled at his saying and cast in
[1:22:00] her mind what manner of salutation this
[1:22:03] should be and remember this was an angel
[1:22:05] messenger from the presence of God
[1:22:07] bringing this word to her and the angel
[1:22:10] said unto her fear not Mary for thou
[1:22:12] Hast found favor with God and behold
[1:22:15] Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[1:22:19] bring forth a son and shall call his
[1:22:22] name Jesus
[1:22:26] it's a new birth being born again the
[1:22:28] life that we display to the world around
[1:22:31] us is Jesus and if it's not Jesus then
[1:22:34] we're not born
[1:22:36] again he shall be great and he shall be
[1:22:38] called the son of the highest and the
[1:22:40] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[1:22:42] of his father David and he shall reign
[1:22:44] over the house of Jacob forever and of
[1:22:47] his kingdom there shall be no end then
[1:22:50] said Mary unto the angel how shall this
[1:22:53] thing be see I know not a man and the
[1:22:57] angel answered and said unto her the
[1:22:59] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[1:23:03] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:23:06] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[1:23:10] which shall be born of thee shall be
[1:23:12] called The Son of God so beautiful
[1:23:17] paragraph 138 as the seed of the woman
[1:23:19] was literally God reproducing himself in
[1:23:23] human flesh so the seed of the serpent
[1:23:26] is the literal way that Satan found he
[1:23:29] was able to open the door to himself
[1:23:33] into the human
[1:23:35] race it was impossible for Satan for he
[1:23:39] is only a created spirit being to
[1:23:43] reproduce himself in the manner which
[1:23:45] God reproduced himself so the Genesis
[1:23:48] account tells how he reproduced his seed
[1:23:52] and introduced or or injected himself
[1:23:56] into the human race also recall that
[1:23:59] Satan is called the serpent it is his
[1:24:03] seed or injection into the human race we
[1:24:06] are speaking
[1:24:09] of before Adam ever had carnal knowledge
[1:24:12] of Eve the serpent had that knowledge
[1:24:15] ahead of him and that one born of it was
[1:24:20] Cain Cain was born Cain sorry Cain was
[1:24:24] of born of begotten of that Wicked one 1
[1:24:29] John 3:12 the holy spirit in John could
[1:24:33] not in one place call Adam the wicked
[1:24:37] one for that is what he would be if he
[1:24:41] fathered
[1:24:42] Cain and in another place call Adam the
[1:24:45] Son of God which he was by creation Luke
[1:24:50] 3:38 Cain turned out in character like
[1:24:54] his
[1:24:55] father a bringer of death a
[1:24:59] murderer I I I think it's interesting
[1:25:02] how brother Bram says this here this
[1:25:03] part it really stands out to me and I
[1:25:06] think it does to Anyone who reads this
[1:25:08] here he says his utter Defiance of God
[1:25:12] when faced by the almighty in Genesis
[1:25:15] 4: 591 13 and 14 where he he talks to
[1:25:20] him and says where's your brother what
[1:25:22] happened to him and he's just absolutely
[1:25:24] abolutely defiant to God that's right
[1:25:27] showed him to be absolutely unhuman
[1:25:30] likee in
[1:25:33] characteristics seeming to even surpass
[1:25:36] any account we have in scripture
[1:25:38] concerning a confrontation of Satan by
[1:25:44] God here's the scriptures that we just
[1:25:46] mentioned but unto Cain and to his
[1:25:48] offering he had no respect and Cain was
[1:25:51] very wroth and his countenance fell and
[1:25:54] the the Lord said unto Cain where is
[1:25:55] Abel thy brother and he said I know not
[1:25:58] am I My Brother's Keeper he's a murderer
[1:26:00] and a liar the father of all lies and
[1:26:04] Cain said unto the Lord my punishment is
[1:26:06] greater than I can bear behold thou Hast
[1:26:08] driven me out this day from the face of
[1:26:10] the Earth and from thy face shall I be
[1:26:13] hid and I shall be a fugitive and a
[1:26:15] vagabond in the earth and it shall come
[1:26:17] to pass that everyone that findeth me
[1:26:21] shall slay me now if you were to go on
[1:26:24] we're not going to get too far into this
[1:26:25] tonight but I think it's interesting
[1:26:27] because right after he said that it says
[1:26:29] in the word of God that God set a what a
[1:26:33] mark upon this person upon this created
[1:26:37] being and and this is the mark of the
[1:26:40] beast he was given a
[1:26:43] mark paragraph 140 notice the exact way
[1:26:47] the record of God sets forth the account
[1:26:49] of the births of Cain Abel and Seth this
[1:26:54] is so beautiful if you look at this
[1:26:56] closely you can see the truth here
[1:26:59] Genesis 4: 1-2 and Adam knew his wife
[1:27:03] and we know no is an intimate relation
[1:27:06] it's not just I I met her somewhere
[1:27:08] along the way God just introduced her to
[1:27:10] him and that's what happened to know is
[1:27:13] actually an intimate relation and Adam
[1:27:16] knew his wife and she conceived and bear
[1:27:19] Cain and said I have begotten a man from
[1:27:21] the Lord and she again bear his brother
[1:27:25] Abel but she didn't know him
[1:27:29] again Genesis 4:25 and Adam knew his
[1:27:33] wife again and she bare a son and called
[1:27:37] his name
[1:27:38] Seth paragraph 141 there are three sons
[1:27:42] born of two acts of carnal knowledge by
[1:27:45] Adam since the Bible is the exact and
[1:27:48] perfect word of God this is no mistake
[1:27:52] but a record for our elimination
[1:27:55] our
[1:27:56] elimination since three sons were born
[1:27:59] from two acts by Adam you know
[1:28:02] positively that one of those three was
[1:28:05] not the son of Adam and and it could be
[1:28:08] a stretch to say well there was two acts
[1:28:10] and it was only that he knew her two
[1:28:12] times but why would it say that he knew
[1:28:15] her two times and not three if the word
[1:28:18] of God is going to say it twice why
[1:28:19] wouldn't it say it Thrice why wouldn't
[1:28:21] it say he knew her three times but we
[1:28:23] can say you know that's the infallible
[1:28:26] truth but that's not the infallible
[1:28:28] truth I would say because there has to
[1:28:30] be a character there has to be an
[1:28:32] identification of a nature of an
[1:28:34] individual like we've talked about
[1:28:36] having the Holy Ghost we can say we got
[1:28:38] the Holy Ghost all day long but if we're
[1:28:39] not in line with the word of God do we
[1:28:41] got the Holy Ghost we could have an
[1:28:42] anointing of the Holy Ghost we're not
[1:28:44] talking about that we want to see the
[1:28:45] indwelling of the person of Jesus Christ
[1:28:48] Living out through us and when that
[1:28:49] happens there will be an
[1:28:52] infallible direction to the word of God
[1:28:54] we will never deviate from the word of
[1:28:55] God if we got the Holy Ghost because he
[1:28:57] can't deny
[1:28:59] himself but he says God has recorded
[1:29:02] this in this exact manner to show us
[1:29:05] something and what I want to say tonight
[1:29:07] brothers and sisters before we get into
[1:29:09] this is the word super
[1:29:13] fication super fundation it's a long
[1:29:18] word it is a real word you can look it
[1:29:21] up in Wikipedia and I would recommend it
[1:29:25] check it out show your families show
[1:29:27] your friends and see if what we're
[1:29:29] talking about here isn't actually in the
[1:29:31] scientific laboratory but not
[1:29:35] advertised goes on to say in paragraph
[1:29:38] 142 the truth of the matter is that Eve
[1:29:41] had in her womb two sons twins from
[1:29:45] separate
[1:29:46] impregnations she was carrying twins
[1:29:49] with Cain's conception sometime previous
[1:29:52] to that of Abel's when I first heard
[1:29:55] this I'll be honest with you I thought
[1:29:56] it's a stretch it's a stretch but then
[1:30:00] as I started to grow and learn I I
[1:30:02] started to say wow wow wow
[1:30:07] wow it's
[1:30:09] possible right and you know I actually
[1:30:12] saw it I followed the news pretty
[1:30:13] closely for a while I remember seeing it
[1:30:15] in the US there was actually a lawsuit
[1:30:17] in the past decade where there was
[1:30:19] actually somebody going for child
[1:30:22] support a woman having two babies from
[1:30:25] two separate acts two separate
[1:30:29] fathers but two eggs in one cycle is
[1:30:33] what
[1:30:34] happens the truth of the matter is that
[1:30:36] even her womb had two sons twins from
[1:30:39] separate impregnations she was carrying
[1:30:42] twins with Cain's conception sometime
[1:30:44] previous to that of Abel's see those
[1:30:47] twins again perfect type as always every
[1:30:50] Revival produces twins that's what
[1:30:52] brother bradam says paragraph 143 to
[1:30:56] those who think that this is not
[1:30:57] possible let it be known that in the
[1:30:59] medical records are replete with cases
[1:31:02] where women have carried twins who were
[1:31:04] of separate OVA and separate
[1:31:06] insemination with the fertilization of
[1:31:09] the eggs being days apart and not only
[1:31:12] so but some of the records show the
[1:31:15] Twins were fed by separate
[1:31:18] males paragraph 144 recently worldwide
[1:31:22] coverage was given to a nor Norwegian
[1:31:24] mother who is suing her husband for
[1:31:26] support for herself and her twins one of
[1:31:30] which was White and the other black she
[1:31:34] admitted that she had a negro lover the
[1:31:38] two conceptions were about 3 weeks apart
[1:31:41] in Bowmont Texas in 1963 the records
[1:31:44] again set forth multiple birth were in
[1:31:47] pregnancies were many days apart in fact
[1:31:50] so much so that the women almost died
[1:31:53] along with with one child and child
[1:31:56] birth now why did this have to be so he
[1:31:59] says why was it that the seed of the
[1:32:02] serpent must come this way Man was
[1:32:05] created for God man was to be the temple
[1:32:09] of God the place of God's rest the Holy
[1:32:14] Spirit was man the
[1:32:17] temple acts 7:46 to 51 who found favor
[1:32:22] before God and desired to find a
[1:32:24] tabernacle for the god of Jacob but
[1:32:27] Solomon built him a house how be it the
[1:32:29] most high dwelleth not in temples made
[1:32:31] with hands as saith the prophet Heaven
[1:32:34] is my throne and Earth is my foot stol
[1:32:36] what house will ye build me sayeth the
[1:32:38] Lord or excuse me what is the place of
[1:32:41] my rest hath not my hand made all these
[1:32:45] things ye stiff neck and uncircumcised
[1:32:48] in heart and ears ye do always resist
[1:32:52] the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do
[1:32:57] ye I just want
[1:32:59] to mention something in
[1:33:04] here two separate fathers I looked it up
[1:33:07] this afternoon just I just had
[1:33:11] to super
[1:33:13] fundation
[1:33:15] fondation super fundation out of
[1:33:18] Wikipedia
[1:33:20] heteropaternal there is one called
[1:33:22] heteropaternal super fundation is a form
[1:33:27] of atypical twin twinning where
[1:33:30] genetically the twins are half siblings
[1:33:33] sharing the same mother but with
[1:33:35] different fathers this was this
[1:33:38] afternoon current
[1:33:39] Wikipedia words pretty amazing it's
[1:33:43] right there if you want to look for it
[1:33:45] paragraph 146 Satan has known this all
[1:33:48] along he also wants to indwell man even
[1:33:51] as God so does but God has reserved to
[1:33:55] himself that right isn't that beautiful
[1:33:58] Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared
[1:34:01] in human flesh Satan could not and
[1:34:04] cannot do that he does not have creative
[1:34:08] Powers the only way for Satan to
[1:34:10] accomplish what he wanted to do was to
[1:34:13] enter the serpent in Eden even as he
[1:34:16] entered by evil spirits into the swine
[1:34:20] at gadera and we know that was where the
[1:34:23] m Maniac was and Jesus delivered him
[1:34:26] from it and the demons that were in that
[1:34:28] man said have you come unto us before
[1:34:31] the time they recognized who he was but
[1:34:33] we know the most religious people of the
[1:34:35] day they couldn't recognize him as the
[1:34:37] son of man it's interesting the Devils
[1:34:40] knew who he was but God does not enter
[1:34:43] animals but Satan can and will to
[1:34:46] accomplish his ends he could not have a
[1:34:49] child directly by Eve as did God by Mary
[1:34:53] so he entered into the serpent and then
[1:34:55] beguiled
[1:34:56] Eve he seduced her and by her did Satan
[1:35:01] have a child
[1:35:04] vicariously Cain bore the full spiritual
[1:35:08] characteristics of Satan and the
[1:35:11] animalistic sensual fleshy
[1:35:14] characteristic of the serpent no wonder
[1:35:18] the holy spirit said that Cain was of
[1:35:21] that Wicked one he was
[1:35:24] that's right now I want to go in into
[1:35:27] some certain proof we have that there is
[1:35:29] a definite Affinity between man and
[1:35:33] animal it is a physical thing do you
[1:35:38] know that you can take the embrio cells
[1:35:40] from an unborn fetus and inject them
[1:35:42] into human beings then those thyroid
[1:35:45] cells will go right to the human thyroid
[1:35:48] the kidney cells will go right to the
[1:35:50] human kidneys do you realize how
[1:35:52] stupendous this is some intelligence
[1:35:56] guides those animal cells exactly to the
[1:35:59] right place that intelligence accepts
[1:36:02] those cells and puts them in exactly the
[1:36:05] right place there is an affinity between
[1:36:08] animal and man they can't intermingle
[1:36:11] and reproduce that has been tried but
[1:36:14] back in the garden that intermingling
[1:36:16] did take place and the chemical Affinity
[1:36:19] which still exists proves it for back in
[1:36:23] Eden
[1:36:24] the serpent was an upright
[1:36:27] creature it's just so amazing when you
[1:36:30] see this when you hear this it gives us
[1:36:34] the ability to to
[1:36:36] really
[1:36:38] understand he was so close to man he was
[1:36:41] almost
[1:36:42] man Satan took advantage of the
[1:36:44] Serpent's physical
[1:36:46] characteristics to use him to beguile
[1:36:50] Eve then God destroyed that pattern of
[1:36:53] the the serpent no other Beast can
[1:36:55] co-mingle with man but the Affinity is
[1:36:59] there isn't it amazing to think that
[1:37:01] this was no accidents God didn't create
[1:37:04] man and and create the serpent and
[1:37:06] create the garden and put the trees in
[1:37:08] the garden and go through all of his
[1:37:10] efforts and then suddenly he was
[1:37:12] surprised and put off and and shocked
[1:37:15] there was a great uh maybe a a a council
[1:37:19] an emergency Council was called in
[1:37:21] heaven that that this thing happened
[1:37:23] with the serpent God knew full well when
[1:37:26] he created The Serpent and and I think
[1:37:29] brother bradam even says it somewhere in
[1:37:30] the message that this serpent was all
[1:37:32] man with the exception of a soul just
[1:37:35] like an animal he was a beast he he was
[1:37:38] a beast of the field that's what the
[1:37:39] word says the serpent was the most
[1:37:41] subtle beast of the
[1:37:43] field he was an upright
[1:37:46] creature
[1:37:48] man paragraph 149 now that we have come
[1:37:51] this far let me try to Crystal I ize
[1:37:53] your thinking on this subject so you can
[1:37:56] see the necessity of our going into the
[1:37:58] serpent Seed doctrine as I have we start
[1:38:02] with the fact that there were two trees
[1:38:04] in the midst of the garden tree of life
[1:38:07] was Jesus the other tree is definitely
[1:38:09] Satan because of what came forth of the
[1:38:13] fruit of that tree remember we talked
[1:38:15] about a little while ago that's how we
[1:38:17] know them you know them by their fruits
[1:38:19] by your fruits you shall know them is
[1:38:21] what Jesus said right
[1:38:24] bam goes on to say now then we know that
[1:38:25] both of these trees had a relationship
[1:38:27] to man or they would never have been
[1:38:29] placed there they must have had a part
[1:38:31] in The Sovereign plan and purpose of God
[1:38:34] in their relationship to Mankind and to
[1:38:37] himself or we could never impute
[1:38:40] omniscience unto God this is all true so
[1:38:45] far is it not now the word most
[1:38:49] definitely sets forth that from before
[1:38:51] the foundation of the Earth the purpose
[1:38:53] of God was to share his eternal life
[1:38:56] with man Ephesians 1:4 to11 according as
[1:39:01] he hath chosen Us in him before the
[1:39:04] foundation of the world that we should
[1:39:07] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:39:10] love having predestinated us unto the
[1:39:14] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:39:17] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:39:19] of his will to the praise of the glory
[1:39:22] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[1:39:27] accepted in the Beloved in whom we have
[1:39:30] Redemption through his blood the
[1:39:32] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:39:34] riches of his grace wherein he hath
[1:39:38] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[1:39:41] Prudence having made known unto us the
[1:39:44] mystery of his will according to his
[1:39:47] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:39:50] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:39:52] fullness of time we might gather
[1:39:54] together in one all things in Christ
[1:39:57] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:39:59] on earth even in him in whom also we
[1:40:03] have obtained an inheritance being
[1:40:06] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:40:08] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:40:11] counsel of his own
[1:40:14] will I just think it's so beautiful you
[1:40:16] know there was a a time where Jesus was
[1:40:20] asking the disciples it just comes to
[1:40:22] mind as we read the second last verse
[1:40:24] here out of Ephesians there was a time
[1:40:27] where Jesus said what what are people
[1:40:29] saying that I am who do people say that
[1:40:31] I am to the disciples some say Elias
[1:40:34] some say a prophet some say Jeremiah
[1:40:36] some say a good man a teacher a rabbi
[1:40:40] and he said you know that's good that's
[1:40:42] good that they're saying that but who do
[1:40:43] you say that I am who do you say and we
[1:40:47] know that it was in that moment that
[1:40:49] Peter he had something welling up in his
[1:40:51] heart that he couldn't contain anymore
[1:40:53] and he said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:40:55] of the Living God and we know that Jesus
[1:40:58] God in flesh he said to him Peter you
[1:41:00] need to understand that Flesh and Blood
[1:41:02] hasn't revealed this to you and everyone
[1:41:04] else around us listening to this no man
[1:41:06] has taught this man those words this guy
[1:41:09] he got those words from his heart and
[1:41:11] that actually came from God it wasn't
[1:41:13] given to him by flesh and blood but by
[1:41:15] the spirit it was God himself that
[1:41:18] revealed this this Revelation to him and
[1:41:21] you know brothers and sisters there is a
[1:41:23] time where the things which are in
[1:41:25] heaven and the things which are in Earth
[1:41:27] are actually going to gather together
[1:41:29] all in Christ and I believe that's
[1:41:32] what's happening as we live according to
[1:41:35] this word for our day as we say Amen to
[1:41:38] this word something is taking place
[1:41:40] we're eating of that tree of life that
[1:41:43] tree that we heard that's in the midst
[1:41:45] of the garden we're actually becoming
[1:41:48] that
[1:41:50] tree Revelations 13:8 and all that dwell
[1:41:53] upon the Earth shall worship him Satan
[1:41:56] whose names are not written in the Book
[1:41:58] of Life of the lamb slain before the
[1:42:03] foundation of the world and we know
[1:42:05] that's the Lamb's Book of Life and no
[1:42:08] man put names on that book and no man
[1:42:10] can take names off that book because the
[1:42:12] only one that put names in that book is
[1:42:14] God himself that wasn't created
[1:42:17] somewhere along the way throughout time
[1:42:20] and space throughout history this was
[1:42:22] before the foundation of the world that
[1:42:24] that book was written God himself wrote
[1:42:27] that book and our names are in there
[1:42:29] brothers and sisters it's so beautiful
[1:42:31] paragraph
[1:42:32] 151 but that life could not and would
[1:42:36] not be shared in any other way than
[1:42:39] through the way of God manifest In the
[1:42:42] Flesh this was part of his eternal and
[1:42:46] predestinated purpose this plan was to
[1:42:49] be to the praise of the glory of his
[1:42:52] grace
[1:42:54] it was the Plan of Redemption it was the
[1:42:57] Plan of
[1:42:58] Salvation he says now listen closely God
[1:43:02] being a savior it was necessary that he
[1:43:06] predestinate a man who would require
[1:43:10] salvation in order to give himself a
[1:43:12] reason and purpose of
[1:43:14] being that is 100% correct and
[1:43:18] multitudes of scripture bear it out as
[1:43:22] does this very pointed verse in Romans
[1:43:25] 11:36 for of him and through him and to
[1:43:29] him are all things to whom be glory
[1:43:33] forever
[1:43:36] amen I'll call the musicians as we close
[1:43:38] here brother Bram in paragraph 152 man
[1:43:41] could not directly come and partake of
[1:43:44] that tree of life in the midst of the
[1:43:46] garden that eternal life of the tree had
[1:43:50] to become flesh first but before God
[1:43:53] could raise and save a sinner he had to
[1:43:57] have a sinner to raise and
[1:44:00] save man had to
[1:44:02] fall The Fall which would be caused by
[1:44:06] Satan had to have flesh to make
[1:44:10] fall Satan had to come through flesh
[1:44:13] also but Satan could not come through
[1:44:15] human flesh to make the fall as would
[1:44:19] Christ come in human flesh to restore
[1:44:21] the Fallen but there was an animal the
[1:44:24] serpent so close to man that Satan could
[1:44:26] get to that beast and through that Beast
[1:44:30] he could get into human flesh and cause
[1:44:33] the fall and inject himself thereby into
[1:44:35] the human race even as Jesus would one
[1:44:39] day come and inject himself into the
[1:44:40] human race into human bodies even to the
[1:44:44] extent of a resurrection wherein we will
[1:44:47] have bodies like unto his glorified one
[1:44:51] I'm going to stop reading there tonight
[1:44:53] I believe that's uh a real headful of
[1:44:57] reading we'll pick up next Wednesday
[1:45:00] Lord willing but you know I just I just
[1:45:03] think it's so beautiful brothers and
[1:45:05] sisters to recognize that there had to
[1:45:07] be a fall there had to be a man to fall
[1:45:10] there had to be someone to fulfill that
[1:45:13] name that was written in the book of the
[1:45:16] life of the Lamb that was slain before
[1:45:18] the foundation of the world there had to
[1:45:20] be someone that was going to actually
[1:45:23] fulfill that and it's just a amazing
[1:45:26] thing when we look at our lives I look
[1:45:28] at my life and I think about all of the
[1:45:31] afflictions all of The Temptations all
[1:45:34] of
[1:45:35] the attributes of this flesh I can just
[1:45:39] see the Beast nature I don't know about
[1:45:41] you if you can see that in your own life
[1:45:44] but if you can just recognize it's not
[1:45:46] your fault you were trapped into it you
[1:45:50] never did it in the first place you are
[1:45:53] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:45:55] world to actually
[1:45:57] be his inheritance many times we talk
[1:46:00] about our inheritance but brothers and
[1:46:02] sisters he has an inheritance and that's
[1:46:05] his life in each and every one of his
[1:46:06] sons and daughters and he ain't going to
[1:46:08] lose
[1:46:10] one God bless you tonight let's just
[1:46:13] stand as we close in
[1:46:18] prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we
[1:46:21] thank you for your goodness and your
[1:46:23] mercy to
[1:46:24] us thank you for the many Revelations
[1:46:27] that you've given to us
[1:46:29] Lord we know that outside of revelation
[1:46:33] we would be lost as lost can be and we
[1:46:36] know that men can read men can speak men
[1:46:40] can teach men can even learn and be
[1:46:45] studied we can earn our way through that
[1:46:49] mentality through that method but it
[1:46:52] truly takes a revelation from you Lord
[1:46:55] Jesus to bring this word to life in the
[1:46:59] hearts of your children and tonight
[1:47:01] father I pray that the words that were
[1:47:03] spoken father would just grow and
[1:47:06] manifest in our lives that we would
[1:47:09] consider our lives and how you gave us
[1:47:12] the opportunity to to step aside from
[1:47:15] this flesh for a moment that we could
[1:47:18] read that there is a place there is a
[1:47:20] Time coming where we will no longer have
[1:47:23] to deal with this flesh with this
[1:47:25] Earthly nature that we contend with
[1:47:27] where there's sickness where there's
[1:47:28] death where there's anxiety where
[1:47:30] there's fear where there's frustration
[1:47:33] and anger Lord those are all attributes
[1:47:36] We Know It of this this serpent this
[1:47:39] Beast Adam and Eve never had one ounce
[1:47:42] of fear in the garden before they fell
