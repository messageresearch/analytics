[23:33] of an uplift hand as we go to him in
[23:36] prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[23:39] we're just so thankful that we can call
[23:41] you our Lord amen we know that there's
[23:43] only one way that we can do that and
[23:45] that's by the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[23:47] Hallelujah and father I just I can't
[23:50] shake the feeling I can't shake the the
[23:53] idea Lord the passion that there's
[23:56] nothing more important than the holy
[23:58] holy ghost in our life yes we could have
[24:01] great ministry we could have the
[24:03] greatest teachers humanly known on Earth
[24:07] but nobody could teach us like you could
[24:10] and father we just pray that tonight
[24:12] Lord we would not be just performing a
[24:16] religious ritual Lord Jesus that we
[24:19] would just be bringing a half-baked
[24:21] Christian experience to you father in a
[24:24] form of worship Lord but that we would
[24:26] strip ourselves down Lord that we would
[24:29] dress ourselves down by Your Word Lord
[24:32] and come according to your word father
[24:34] and allow us to be changed father from
[24:37] glory to glory not holding on to
[24:39] traditional thinking and ideas Lord
[24:42] Jesus but realizing there's only one way
[24:45] that we will see the Rapture that we
[24:47] will see a body change and that's to
[24:48] first see a character change oh Lord
[24:51] Jesus I pray that you would even start
[24:53] with me let me have a character change
[24:56] Lord I don't like the man that I see
[24:58] oh but father I'm so thankful that you
[25:00] don't see me the way that I do father I
[25:04] know that's every one of our experience
[25:06] Lord Jesus and tonight one more time I
[25:08] believe we could all say we just throw
[25:10] ourselves upon that rock of Revelation
[25:13] tonight Lord Jesus thank you Lord oh
[25:15] father let us fall upon you tonight Lord
[25:18] that you would not fall Upon Us father
[25:21] we pray that you would just meet each
[25:23] need made known unto you tonight by the
[25:25] way of an uplift hand father we just ask
[25:27] that you would have the full preeminence
[25:29] in our service Lord and every thought
[25:32] Lord Jesus and every idea Lord every
[25:36] word that's spoken Lord Jesus let us not
[25:39] have our own but let us have yours
[25:41] father let that teacher come from the
[25:43] inside and minister to us one more time
[25:46] thank you Lord oh Father Like no man
[25:49] ever can we just Commit This service now
[25:52] into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus
[25:55] Christ's name we pray amen amen God
[25:59] bless you tonight thank you
[26:01] musicians I certainly uh
[26:04] feel naturally uh playing a tape would
[26:08] be maybe a better thing to do but uh
[26:10] spiritually I just feel energized after
[26:14] our journey God bless you brother
[26:17] certainly appreciated the time in
[26:19] Philippines it was truly blessed but uh
[26:23] we're back home and let's get into the
[26:25] word if you have your Bibles tonight I'd
[26:27] like to continue on with our study in
[26:29] the exposition of the seven Church
[26:32] ages the closing out of the Leo Dean
[26:36] Church age which is exactly where we are
[26:40] in the call it the sands of time the
[26:43] closing out of the leoan church age and
[26:46] we know that there is a leoan church age
[26:48] and there is a bride age and they
[26:51] actually overlap there's not a hard stop
[26:53] and a hard start they overlap but you
[26:56] know the leoan Church age is what will
[26:59] take people right into the tribulation
[27:03] the leoan church age isn't what delivers
[27:05] the church from the tribulation and
[27:09] we're seeing the ending of the leodan
[27:12] church age so where do we stand tonight
[27:15] I think this is so incredible in
[27:17] Revelations 3
[27:20] verse4 and unto the angel of the Church
[27:23] of the leodan write these things saith
[27:26] the amen the faithful and true witness
[27:31] the beginning of the creation of God I
[27:34] Know Thy works that thou art neither hot
[27:37] nor cold I would thou W hot or cold cold
[27:41] or hot sorry so then because Thou Art
[27:45] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[27:49] spew thee out of my mouth because thou
[27:52] sayest I am rich and increased with
[27:55] goods and have need of
[27:57] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[27:59] wretched and miserable and poor and
[28:03] blind and
[28:05] naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[28:08] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[28:11] rich and white rment that thou mayest be
[28:15] clothed and that the shame of thy
[28:18] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[28:21] eyes with iav that thou mayest
[28:24] see as many as I love I rebuke and Chas
[28:29] be zealous therefore and
[28:31] repent behold I stand at the door and
[28:33] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[28:36] the door I will come into him and will
[28:39] Su with him and he with me to him that
[28:43] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[28:45] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[28:49] am set down with my father in his throne
[28:52] amen he that hath an ear let him hear
[28:55] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[28:59] let's just pray one more time Heavenly
[29:00] Father Lord Jesus we just thank you for
[29:03] the ear to hear amen Lord Jesus we know
[29:07] that it's not just to hear and then just
[29:09] to take with the grain of salt it's so
[29:11] that we can be rebuked and we can be
[29:14] chastened that when you knock on the
[29:16] door that we would hear it and truly
[29:17] open the door to our heart to you father
[29:20] and say search us and try us that we
[29:23] might be like you father tonight we just
[29:26] ask that you would bless the word that's
[29:28] spoken that's read already father your
[29:30] Eternal Word we just commit each life
[29:33] each Soul each word that's spoken into
[29:35] your hands now for your glory in Jesus
[29:38] Christ's name we pray amen amen God
[29:41] bless you tonight you may be
[29:44] seated we are certainly glad to be back
[29:47] we arrived last night um about I think
[29:51] it was about 10 o00 we got into Calgary
[29:54] and uh got home about 11:30 and we hit
[29:57] the ground running today so it's been
[30:00] wonderful wonderful to be back and we're
[30:03] thankful for the leadership of the Lord
[30:06] I I love what uh brother said to me
[30:09] earlier today I said you know I'm I just
[30:12] I'm so glad that I'm not an evangelist I
[30:14] don't want to travel that's not my
[30:15] heart's desire and I know some people
[30:17] are probably saying yeah you're a liar
[30:19] because you traveled but that's not the
[30:21] case I'm not actually uh Desiring to go
[30:24] and buy plane tickets and fly but with
[30:27] the leader ship of the Lord when he
[30:29] calls you have to
[30:31] go that's all I can say and uh I so
[30:34] appreciate the brother saying to me
[30:36] tonight don't say no don't say never
[30:39] just trust the Lord because he could
[30:41] call again I don't know but uh we had a
[30:43] wonderful
[30:45] time we had uh the opportunity to meet
[30:48] many many people um there was over 200
[30:52] pastors at the Asian ministers
[30:54] conference and uh they were from India
[30:57] Pakistan Indonesia Vietnam Laos Cambodia
[31:01] Philippines USA and Canada there was a
[31:04] lot of ministers there and uh it was
[31:06] just so wonderful to meet them and to
[31:09] hear what the Lord is doing in their
[31:11] countries and through their Ministries
[31:13] and you know the the bride is coming to
[31:17] Perfection and and I just have this
[31:19] resounding thought in my heart you know
[31:21] what is that mean to come to Perfection
[31:23] the bride coming to Perfection is moving
[31:25] from bride to wife there's that intimate
[31:29] relationship there it's no longer just
[31:31] up to the marriage ceremony because we
[31:33] know the marriage ceremony the prophet
[31:35] said very clearly is happening right now
[31:37] on Earth we're not going to go to heaven
[31:39] for the marriage ceremony we're going to
[31:40] go to heaven to the
[31:43] Millennium for the marriage supper of
[31:45] the lamb and we know that comes after
[31:48] the marriage after your now husband and
[31:51] wife so it's just a wonderful thing to
[31:54] recognize the day in which we live
[31:56] there's a strong push uh a brother
[31:58] posted it about the Third Temple to be
[32:01] built in Israel we know that Israel's
[32:04] hearts are stirred very greatly it is
[32:07] not just something that's out there in
[32:09] the future it's currently happening
[32:10] right now and one of these days
[32:12] seriously there's going to be two
[32:14] witnesses that pop up on the news feeds
[32:17] and they're going to be doing
[32:19] Supernatural things on earth and those
[32:22] two witnesses are what will actually
[32:24] usher in Jesus Christ himself to make
[32:28] himself known to his Brethren and we
[32:31] know when that happens the bride is not
[32:33] on
[32:34] Earth she's already in the palace isn't
[32:37] that
[32:38] wonderful talking about our uh our
[32:41] ministers meeting there in in in uh
[32:44] Manila it was hot it was 39° and the
[32:48] Lord was good to us though we uh we
[32:50] learned a lot and uh I know I have a lot
[32:53] of
[32:54] encouragement uh just from the
[32:56] discussions that I had and some of the
[32:57] things that I heard some of the things
[33:00] that I heard and saw weren't really uh
[33:02] that exciting to understand and learn
[33:05] but you know that's not going to deter
[33:07] me from who I am and what I believe and
[33:11] the one thing that I I noticed was uh
[33:14] even in North America in the USA and
[33:17] maybe even in Canada and and probably
[33:20] all over in other countries I'm only
[33:21] going to talk about here in our backyard
[33:23] you know there's people with pet
[33:25] doctrines and they just love them and
[33:27] they just won't let go of them and the
[33:29] only thing they want to do is try and
[33:31] find quotes to support their pet
[33:33] doctrines and they want to quote and
[33:34] quote and quote my quote says your quote
[33:37] says what are we doing what are we doing
[33:40] I said this you know what if we've got a
[33:42] pet Doctrine I've got pet doctrines and
[33:45] and my pet doctrines are this message of
[33:47] the hour and I'm not interested in
[33:50] trying to make excuses for my pet
[33:52] doctrines because the word says the
[33:54] bride has thus sayith the Lord and has
[33:58] the mind of Christ to know what to do
[34:00] with it so if I'm going to take a pet
[34:01] Doctrine I'm going to start taking those
[34:03] and saying they're mine though that's my
[34:06] quote right there I'm going to say that
[34:08] I'm not going to say that there's a a
[34:09] hierarchy and there's a a low hierarchy
[34:12] and and it should be this way and I feel
[34:14] like it's that maybe you do it here and
[34:16] we do it there whatever the message is
[34:19] the
[34:20] message it was preached in English and
[34:23] we need to take it in English and we
[34:25] need to accept it the way that God's
[34:27] given it to to us John didn't have the
[34:29] opportunity to say I don't like the way
[34:31] that you've actually given me that book
[34:33] that was in the hand of him that sat on
[34:35] the throne could you please change it
[34:38] and adopt it to fit my lifestyle and
[34:40] what my pet doctrines are he said no
[34:43] take the book and eat it up it will be
[34:47] sweet in your mouth it'll sound so good
[34:49] when we say the quotes oh but once they
[34:52] get down inside it's going to change you
[34:54] from the inside your body's going to
[34:56] hate it
[34:58] it's the same for everyone and we've got
[35:00] to be willing to accept it that way
[35:03] that's probably my biggest takeaway from
[35:05] it is you know what just take the word
[35:08] just take the word put the word first
[35:10] it's the only thing that God will
[35:12] vindicate we can say that we have this
[35:14] or that or the other but there's only
[35:16] one thing he's going to back up and
[35:18] that's the word so I I'm thrilled that
[35:20] we have been studying this book here and
[35:22] and you know I'm I'm just going to
[35:23] preach from it I think probably until we
[35:26] have a body change
[35:28] this book is so rich I I'm going back
[35:30] over it again from the beginning and
[35:31] it's just my goodness there's so much
[35:34] that I missed so much that I didn't get
[35:35] it's
[35:37] beautiful
[35:39] okay we had uh four days I believe with
[35:43] the uh with the uh Asians ministers
[35:48] conference the AMC and it was just a
[35:51] wonderful time to get to know some
[35:52] brothers and one of the outcomes is I
[35:54] got to meet a brother Roshan from India
[35:57] and uh he's from India yeah yeah I
[36:00] wasn't sure I started to get confused
[36:02] before service he's from India and uh
[36:04] he's coming to Canada his son is
[36:06] actually fellowshipping in the Lower
[36:07] Mainland currently I believe he's going
[36:09] to school there and so he'll be here in
[36:12] July we're just working out the dates
[36:13] he's coming through Edmonton and then
[36:16] he's going to travel here and then I
[36:17] think he's going to Vancouver the Lower
[36:19] Mainland to visit his son so we're
[36:21] certainly excited to see him and uh it
[36:24] was neat to just make the connection but
[36:26] we've made some connections with other
[36:28] folks there and yeah it was just
[36:30] wonderful and you know one of the more
[36:31] notable connections that we made was
[36:33] with uh brother Eduardo evasco I didn't
[36:36] realize it as we were going but uh is uh
[36:40] sister Emily here
[36:42] tonight and Carman Citta they didn't
[36:44] make it tonight sometimes they don't on
[36:46] Wednesdays but they uh sister Emily
[36:49] shook my hand the last service we were
[36:51] here and she said are you going to see
[36:52] my brother when you're there and I said
[36:54] I don't know I I have no idea but they
[36:56] were able to work it out and uh you know
[36:58] the night before we flew back they were
[37:00] able to arrange a Monday night service
[37:02] at this church and uh so it was it was
[37:06] tremendous and I had said this you know
[37:08] it was just it just really struck me
[37:10] before service you know here we are uh a
[37:13] Monday night and and some might say well
[37:15] you're in Philippines and maybe there's
[37:16] nothing to do there but I can tell you
[37:18] if there's a place that's busy where
[37:20] people are busy they're up at the crack
[37:22] of dawn or even before and and they're
[37:25] going all day long until it's dark again
[37:29] and it's just uh you have to get up and
[37:32] go if you're going to do anything there
[37:34] from what I can gather and uh the people
[37:36] you know they're living their life the
[37:38] same as we are here and uh no doubt
[37:40] they're tired they went to school they
[37:42] went to work they have all their labors
[37:43] and chores and everything they're doing
[37:45] just like the rest of the humans on
[37:46] Earth and Monday night we had a service
[37:49] that just blew the lid off the place it
[37:52] was something else I don't know if we
[37:54] have a link to that service I wouldn't
[37:56] mind watching it again but uh yeah it
[37:59] was just it was really really good and I
[38:01] said you know on a Wednesday night you
[38:03] can see who the church really
[38:05] is Sundays there's a lot of people that
[38:07] come to church but Wednesdays are the
[38:09] people that come all the time and uh
[38:12] it's just something different about a
[38:13] Wednesday night service than on a Sunday
[38:16] and uh I had to say to them uh let alone
[38:19] a Monday here we are on Monday and the
[38:21] church was absolutely packed it was just
[38:23] wonderful humbling in fact you know so
[38:26] sister Emily's brother is the pastor
[38:29] there brother Eduardo iasco and that's
[38:31] sister Carmen C's son and I just felt so
[38:34] humbled they wanted to have a fellowship
[38:36] with food before service and I said you
[38:38] know I just don't eat before service I
[38:40] can't I need the blood to go up here not
[38:43] here I'll need a chair if you feed me
[38:45] before service so she actually texted
[38:48] her son and said you know if it's going
[38:50] to be after service then you need to
[38:52] order some Panet for brother Barry he
[38:54] loves Panet so he did and and I just
[38:57] just felt so touched sister Carmen sitt
[39:00] from Canada ordered this food for me
[39:02] while I was there and uh so afterwards I
[39:05] made sure I had my fill it was really
[39:07] good we had a wonderful time there and
[39:10] uh you know that that that assembly I
[39:12] think is over 50 years old attending and
[39:16] uh it's a very special place in the
[39:17] heart of the panetas as well I believe
[39:20] uh that's where both brother mvin and
[39:22] sister Fay under that Ministry got
[39:24] baptized sister Fay at that assembly and
[39:27] and brother mvin in Qatar is that right
[39:29] through the same pastor and uh that
[39:32] Ministry has uh is what grounded rooted
[39:35] in grounded the panetas in this message
[39:37] so a very uh near and dear Ministry that
[39:41] we were able to go and minister to so
[39:44] just wonderful to see it unfortunately
[39:46] that Pastor actually passed away in 2018
[39:49] as well and so uh sister Emily's brother
[39:53] was voted in I guess shortly after that
[39:56] so sister carmena if you're listening
[39:59] tonight thank you so much for the Panet
[40:02] really enjoyed it and uh God richly
[40:04] bless you all are you happy
[40:07] tonight carrying on in our study I'll
[40:10] maybe have a little bit more to talk
[40:12] about on on Sunday about it I just
[40:14] wanted to give a little brief update for
[40:16] what we did there uh carrying on from
[40:19] where we left off in paragraph 1
[40:22] 173 brother brandham he says no words
[40:24] ever spelled out a more bitter
[40:26] denunciation
[40:28] and no and no proud and arrogant
[40:32] religious people ever deserved it more
[40:35] wow yet in verse 21 to him that
[40:37] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[40:39] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[40:42] I'm set down with my father in his
[40:45] throne we find the True Vine true Spirit
[40:50] true church people exalted to the very
[40:53] Throne of God with the highest
[40:56] compliment ever paid to a humble
[41:00] steadfast spiritual group what a
[41:03] tremendous statement that
[41:06] is the words of John the Baptist who so
[41:10] accurately set forth the Christ in
[41:13] relationship to the true and false
[41:16] church now comes to
[41:19] pass I indeed baptize you with water
[41:22] unto repentance but he that cometh after
[41:25] me is mightier than I
[41:28] whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he
[41:30] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[41:33] and with fire whose fan is in his hand
[41:36] and he will thoroughly Purge his floor
[41:38] and gather his wheat into the Garner but
[41:41] he will burn up the chaff with
[41:44] unquenchable
[41:46] fire interesting scripture that is isn't
[41:49] it remember I believe we talked about
[41:52] this a little while ago if there's no
[41:53] chaff there's no
[41:56] wheat I think it's important for us to
[41:58] remember we don't want to throw off on
[41:59] the chaff the chaff is the chaff but
[42:03] it's not up to us to burn the chaff and
[42:07] sometimes that lukewarm formal religious
[42:09] spirit likes to talk about burning up
[42:12] the cha it's just the chaff just a Shu
[42:15] just those guys no no there would be no
[42:18] wheat if there weren't those guys we
[42:21] need to make sure we remember
[42:24] that Christ the Great Harvester is now
[42:28] reaping the fruit of the earth he
[42:31] gathers the wheat into the Garner by
[42:33] coming for his own and receiving them
[42:36] forever unto
[42:38] himself then he returns to destroy the
[42:41] Wicked with fire unquenchable The
[42:44] Mystery of the tears and wheat of
[42:47] Matthew 13 is now also
[42:50] fulfilled another Parable put he forth
[42:53] unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven
[42:55] is likened unto a man
[42:57] which sowed good seed in his
[42:59] field but while men slept his enemy came
[43:04] and SED tears among the
[43:06] wheat and went his way anybody ever grow
[43:09] a garden
[43:11] here could you imagine planting your
[43:13] seeds and your rose getting it all ready
[43:16] together and finding out that someone
[43:18] came and planted seeds that you can't
[43:20] see in the night when you you just went
[43:23] to bed all the work that you did that'd
[43:25] be a little frustrating wouldn't it
[43:29] but when the blade was sprung up and
[43:31] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[43:33] tears
[43:35] also so the Servants of the householder
[43:38] came and said unto him sir did not thou
[43:41] sow good seed in thy field from whence
[43:44] then had it
[43:45] tears and he said unto them an enemy
[43:48] hath done
[43:49] this so if you have weeds in your garden
[43:52] remember that it's an enemy
[43:57] the servant said unto him wilt thou then
[43:59] that we go and gather them
[44:01] up but he said nay lest while you gather
[44:05] up the tears ye root up also the wheat
[44:07] with them let both grow together until
[44:10] the Harvest and in the time of harvest I
[44:14] will say to the Reapers Gather ye
[44:16] together first the tears and bind them
[44:19] in bundles to burn them but gather the
[44:22] wheat into my
[44:24] barn remember earlier in the church a
[44:27] book brother bradam talks about that
[44:29] what's going to gather them it's going
[44:31] to be Angels the Reapers but it might
[44:35] not be as we suppose I think it's so
[44:37] beautiful the way that brother brandham
[44:38] brings this as another Revelation what
[44:40] it's going to be is Angel
[44:43] Messengers each Church age are going to
[44:47] be gathering The Tears by the preaching
[44:50] of the
[44:51] word it's not going to be the great
[44:54] Roundup in the sky where they come after
[44:57] all the doggies like Cowboys with ropes
[45:00] to try and rope them and gather them all
[45:01] up and gather them and tie them and
[45:03] throw them in for the burning what it's
[45:04] going to be is an ecumenical move that's
[45:07] inside the church already a political
[45:10] movement whereby people believe they're
[45:13] right but they're not willing to take
[45:16] all the word and apply it in their life
[45:18] and because of that it's going to take
[45:20] them and bind them together did you ever
[45:23] notice birds of a feather they flock
[45:25] together sometimes you'll see spiritual
[45:29] affiliations within churches or
[45:31] different Church groups and certain
[45:33] people will tend to gravitate towards
[45:35] one another usually what it is is pet
[45:37] doctrines and I want to say this when we
[45:40] have a pet doctrine that doesn't line up
[45:41] with the word that is the Antichrist
[45:44] spirit amen it's either the Holy Spirit
[45:47] or it's the Antichrist spirit it's one
[45:49] or the other there's no lukewarm there's
[45:51] no gray area there's no mixing it it's a
[45:54] hybrid condition one word off is what
[45:56] caused the of mankind to doubt one word
[46:00] of the word of God is
[46:02] death today tonight in the age in which
[46:05] we
[46:06] live it's going to be just rejecting one
[46:10] word of the truth and saying I'm just
[46:11] going to do it my way I've done it this
[46:14] way all along and I'm just going to
[46:15] continue doing it this way nothing you
[46:16] can teach me or tell me it's going to
[46:18] carry on everything's good in my life
[46:20] right that's the Leo Dean
[46:22] Spirit I'm rich I got the money I'm
[46:25] increased with Goods we've got the port
[46:27] folio and I'm in need of nothing
[46:30] spiritually I've got this do you do we I
[46:35] think we need to check oursel sometimes
[46:37] sitting on an airplane for that long I
[46:39] guess you think too
[46:41] much but it's really shook me down and
[46:43] made me think where do we stand are we
[46:46] going to Forfeit our right to the
[46:48] marriage supper of the lamb for one
[46:53] word
[46:55] why not both grow together until the
[46:57] Harvest and in the time of the Harvest
[46:59] I'll say to the Reapers Gather ye
[47:02] together the first the tears and bind
[47:04] them in bundles to burn them the ones
[47:08] that just actually just don't take all
[47:11] the word they say that's okay I'm just
[47:12] going to do it this way it's the way
[47:14] it's the way and it's the preaching of
[47:16] the word that does the separation
[47:17] brothers and sisters those are the
[47:18] Reapers the church age Messengers and
[47:21] the ones that stay true to the church
[47:23] age Messengers are the ones who are the
[47:24] wheat the ones that don't stay true to
[47:26] the church age Messengers they're the
[47:28] tears and the word does a separating no
[47:31] human does
[47:32] it the Angels aren't coming riding on
[47:34] horses like I said as a rodeo it's just
[47:37] the word it's a word thing and it's
[47:39] interesting because when we read a
[47:40] scripture like this many people would
[47:42] say well there's going to be a great
[47:44] time where that happens sure enough
[47:45] there will be a great white Throne
[47:47] judgment where he will separate the
[47:49] goats from the sheep that is that the
[47:52] white thrown judgment that's not on
[47:54] Earth while the wheat and the tears are
[47:56] are growing
[47:58] together carrying on he says the wheat n
[48:00] tears which from the first age until now
[48:03] have grown side by side are
[48:05] harvested what NAA set out to accomplish
[48:09] has finally come to pass what has Nia
[48:12] set out to accomplish a political system
[48:14] in the church in every single Church age
[48:18] a political system that will never ever
[48:21] be able to be rooted out from the church
[48:23] age that's the tear that was forced to
[48:25] grow alongs side the wheat it's a
[48:28] political movement what causes the
[48:29] church to become lukewarm formal and
[48:31] Powerless
[48:33] politics this is the way I think we
[48:35] should do it this is the way I think we
[48:37] should do it the church age book the
[48:39] holy ghost through the prophet messenger
[48:41] said very clearly the only church the
[48:43] only true church is the one that's led
[48:45] by the Holy
[48:46] Ghost all else is false if it becomes
[48:49] the hierarchy of Men We believe that we
[48:51] should do it this way then the pastor is
[48:53] no longer LED he's actually there
[48:56] getting
[48:57] paycheck as a job because now the
[49:01] leadership of the church which isn't the
[49:03] Holy Ghost over the
[49:04] pastor is running the church now you
[49:08] have a lukewarm formal and Powerless
[49:10] church that's what it is politics in the
[49:12] church from the very beginning right up
[49:14] to the very end the wheat and the tears
[49:17] from the first age until now have grown
[49:19] side by side and are harvested what Nia
[49:22] set out to accomplish has finally come
[49:23] to pass with all the might of organ
[49:27] organization the false Church turns away
[49:31] any vestage of Truth and with political
[49:34] might reinforces herself with State
[49:38] backing and sets out to eradicate
[49:41] Forever The True
[49:44] Believer you know don't look at the
[49:46] Catholic church for this look at the
[49:48] message of the hour there's people that
[49:51] have come out of the message of the hour
[49:52] that are beating War drums against the
[49:55] message of the hour just wait now until
[49:58] this actually reaches the right ear the
[50:00] right political level and they will shut
[50:02] down anyone that says anything in the
[50:05] name of William Mary and
[50:08] Branham it will happen according to the
[50:11] the prophetic utterance but that's where
[50:13] the state backing will come in he goes
[50:16] on to say but just when she is about to
[50:18] accomplish her cowardly
[50:21] plot the wheat is gathered into the
[50:24] Garner in the moment in a twinkling of
[50:26] and I all that we have ever dreamed
[50:28] about or preached about hey will happen
[50:32] no longer will the wheat and tears grow
[50:34] side by side no longer will the tears
[50:37] receive the blessing of God because of
[50:39] the presence of the wheat and that's
[50:42] what's happening now the tears are
[50:44] receiving the blessing of God because of
[50:47] the presence of the wheat you ever think
[50:49] about that that's such a powerful
[50:52] statement it doesn't make anybody
[50:54] anybody the only one is the the True
[50:57] Vine only true vine is the one that's
[50:59] with the word amen the whole word and
[51:02] nothing but the word amen no man-made
[51:05] ideas Creeds or dogmas only the word of
[51:09] God no longer will the weed and tears
[51:13] grow side by side no longer will the
[51:15] tears receive of the blessing of God
[51:18] because of the presence of the wheat for
[51:20] the wheat will be gone and the wrath of
[51:23] God will be poured out in the six seal
[51:26] which will end in utter destruction of
[51:29] the wicked now I said a moment ago that
[51:33] the false find came into full fruition
[51:35] in this age her fruit would mature and
[51:40] ripen that is correct this evil spirited
[51:44] Church full of iniquity will be revealed
[51:48] as the mustard seed that grew into a
[51:50] tree where en lodged all the fowls of
[51:54] the
[51:54] air at her head
[51:57] will be the
[51:58] Antichrist the mystery of
[52:01] iniquity all this is
[52:06] true and if this is true then it must
[52:10] also be true that the bride church WIll
[52:14] mature and her rightness shall be an
[52:18] identification with her Lord by means
[52:22] of the word
[52:29] and her head who will come to her is the
[52:32] mystery of godliness which indeed is
[52:38] Christ it's not the prophet I think this
[52:41] is so rich it's
[52:44] Christ and and how does that happen
[52:46] there's only one way that happens right
[52:49] it's only by one Spirit we're baptized
[52:52] right and that's his Spirit excuse me
[53:01] I
[53:03] apologize I don't
[53:05] know I think the difference in
[53:07] temperature really got
[53:08] me my but we're certainly thankful for
[53:12] his healing touch I'm feeling much
[53:14] better than I
[53:17] was now I said a moment ago that the
[53:20] false Vine came into full fruition in
[53:22] this age her fruit would mature and
[53:23] ripen that is correct this evil spirit
[53:26] Church full of iniquity will be revealed
[53:29] as the mustard seed that grew into a
[53:32] tree wherein Lodge the fowls of the air
[53:36] at her head will be the Antichrist the
[53:39] mystery of iniquity all this is true and
[53:42] if this is true then it must also be
[53:45] true that the bride church WIll mature
[53:48] and her ress shall be an identification
[53:52] with her Lord by means of the word and
[53:55] her head who will come to her is the
[53:59] mystery of godliness which indeed is
[54:03] Christ and as the false church with all
[54:06] cunning and diabolical power made up of
[54:10] political force physical force and
[54:14] demons of Darkness come up against this
[54:17] True
[54:18] Vine the True Vine with the fullness of
[54:21] the spirit and the word will do the very
[54:25] acts of power that Jesus
[54:30] did you know when we were there we just
[54:34] had some tremendous services and one of
[54:36] them I I spoke on was the king's sword
[54:39] and another one was
[54:42] sheath and uh there's just I I just
[54:46] think such an amazing amount of power at
[54:48] our
[54:49] fingertips and if we just speak the word
[54:53] God will back it
[54:54] up but the only way that will happen is
[54:57] for us to be in the word and for the
[54:59] word to be in us all the way a church
[55:02] affiliation some sort of political
[55:05] standing ain't going to do it tenure
[55:08] ain't going to do it that ain't enough
[55:11] we have got to know Jesus Christ we have
[55:13] to be pregnated by Jesus Christ there
[55:17] has to be a Life coming forth inside of
[55:19] us that's Jesus Christ and all else is
[55:23] false but when we're there the True Vine
[55:26] with with the fullness of the spirit and
[55:27] the word will do the very acts of power
[55:32] that Jesus
[55:34] did just speak squirrels into
[55:37] existence you need some
[55:40] money you think God can't provide it you
[55:43] need a job you think God can't provide
[55:45] it right you need healing in your
[55:48] body don't think he can't provide it he
[55:51] can provide it and he will we won't but
[55:55] he will will through
[55:57] us cuz remember in the pick up your pen
[56:00] and write it says in there that there
[56:03] was things that he didn't complete while
[56:05] he was here in his Earthly Ministry that
[56:07] he now does in and through his
[56:13] bride then as she nears her headstone
[56:16] becoming like him through the
[56:21] word Jesus will come and that bride and
[56:25] groom May may be forever United as
[56:31] one I think it's so beautiful just to
[56:34] understand that you
[56:37] know he could easily just put any one of
[56:39] us
[56:40] away just say away with you you've cut
[56:44] your hair I know you've cut your hair I
[56:46] know that you had some secret sin before
[56:49] we got married I could easily just put
[56:51] you away and find a better one right but
[56:54] he doesn't does he he actually made one
[56:56] atonement for every single one of us how
[56:59] how could any one of us think that we
[57:01] could just put away a bride is beyond me
[57:04] especially in and around this message of
[57:06] the hour it just it boggles my
[57:09] mind but here we are paragraph
[57:12] 179 already the visible manifestations
[57:16] of what I have been telling you are seen
[57:20] all around us The ecumenical move of the
[57:23] tears is factual
[57:26] but also it is a fact that the prophet
[57:29] for the last age must be bringing forth
[57:32] a message from God that will forerun the
[57:35] second coming of the Lord for by his
[57:39] message will the hearts of the children
[57:41] be turned back to the Pentecostal
[57:44] fathers and with the restoration of the
[57:47] word will come the restoration of the
[57:51] power it has to be the restoration of
[57:54] the word
[57:56] what crucial times are these in which we
[58:00] live and how how how how crucial has it
[58:03] ever been except for the day in which we
[58:05] live we know this was in 1965 this book
[58:08] was released how crucial is the time
[58:11] today
[58:15] my how careful we must be that we remain
[58:19] True to this word and not take from it
[58:22] or add to
[58:23] it for he who would speak where God has
[58:27] not spoken makes him a
[58:30] liar and we know that it says in the
[58:33] Book of Revelation I believe it's in 21
[58:36] that if we add to or take from it the
[58:38] plagues of this book will be added to us
[58:41] a and the right to the tree of life will
[58:43] be taken from us just the same crucial
[58:47] times that we live
[58:49] in what I have particularly in mind is
[58:52] this about the turn of the century the
[58:55] hunger for God that was generated in the
[58:57] Philadelphian age brought a cry for the
[59:00] spirit of God and when the cry was
[59:03] answered by God sending forth
[59:06] manifestation in tongues interpretation
[59:09] and prophecy a group immediately and
[59:12] most contrary to the word Drew up a
[59:16] Doctrine the tongues was the evidence of
[59:18] being baptized with the Holy
[59:21] Ghost tongues were far from the evidence
[59:26] they were manifestation but not
[59:28] evidence remember brother bradam says
[59:31] this in this church age book and I'm
[59:33] sure this Ruffles a lot of feathers but
[59:36] he says the evidence of tongues
[59:38] certainly are evidence of manifestation
[59:41] but what those tongues are isn't a a
[59:44] declaration of the word coming of the
[59:47] Lord what they are declaring is the sign
[59:51] of Destruction just like the Feast of
[59:53] Bel shazar the hand writing is on the
[59:57] wall with the manifestation of tongues
[1:00:00] especially when you see as we talked
[1:00:02] about before it went away there all this
[1:00:04] glossolalia where someone will be just
[1:00:06] talking and then suddenly religiously
[1:00:08] burst out into some foreign tongue and
[1:00:11] then back in Phase back into a a normal
[1:00:14] tongue it's unknown tongues there's no
[1:00:17] interpretation it's confusion it's out
[1:00:20] of order according to the word of
[1:00:23] God tongues is a manifest ation but not
[1:00:27] evidence the falsity of the doctrine
[1:00:30] cannot only be seen by a lack of
[1:00:33] scripture to substantiate
[1:00:36] it which is vital our lives have to have
[1:00:39] scripture to substantiate Our Lives we
[1:00:42] can pull quotes and say well I got this
[1:00:44] quote that justifies me to do this and I
[1:00:46] got that quote that justifies me to do
[1:00:49] that but have you got a scripture does
[1:00:52] the scripture back up your theory if it
[1:00:54] doesn't then you better leave it
[1:00:57] alone the falsity of the doctrine can
[1:01:00] only be seen by a lack of scripture to
[1:01:03] substantiate but those who subscribed to
[1:01:06] the doctrine immediately organized on
[1:01:09] the basis of Doctrine proving that they
[1:01:13] were not in the truth as they would have
[1:01:16] people
[1:01:19] believe our lives speak
[1:01:22] volumes oh it looked good it looked like
[1:01:25] like the return of
[1:01:28] Pentecost but it proved it wasn't it
[1:01:31] could not be for it
[1:01:35] organized that is death not
[1:01:38] life when we see politics it's death not
[1:01:44] life politics do not run the Church of
[1:01:47] the Living God the Holy Ghost runs the
[1:01:51] Church of the Living God the leadership
[1:01:55] of the Holy Ghost that's it anything
[1:01:59] else is the Antichrist spirit that will
[1:02:01] creep into the church and cause it to
[1:02:04] become lukewarm formal and
[1:02:08] Powerless but we could have
[1:02:11] manifestation that's not the sign that's
[1:02:14] not what we're
[1:02:15] into oh it looked good it looked like
[1:02:17] the return of Pentecost but it proved it
[1:02:19] wasn't it could not be for it organized
[1:02:22] that is death not life it looked so
[1:02:25] close to the real that multitudes were
[1:02:28] deceived and how many people run to the
[1:02:30] churches and say well look at how many
[1:02:33] activities they've got look at how many
[1:02:34] people go there look at how good they
[1:02:36] worship look at all this
[1:02:39] stuff the prophetic utterance said in
[1:02:42] 1965 in Satan's Eden there will be
[1:02:44] millions and billions of impersonators
[1:02:46] of Christianity thinking they're
[1:02:47] worshiping God but they're actually
[1:02:48] worshiping
[1:02:49] Satan they'll have awesome tremendous
[1:02:52] anointed songs and tremendous anointed
[1:02:55] musicians playing
[1:02:57] Perfection but it won't even be
[1:02:59] worshiping God you know the word of God
[1:03:01] says to make a Joyful Noise We need to
[1:03:03] make very sure we know where we stand
[1:03:05] when we worship we're bringing a
[1:03:08] sacrifice of
[1:03:10] praise and that sacrifice of praise is
[1:03:13] not our Perfection when we try to make
[1:03:15] it our Perfection we're getting
[1:03:17] political what we need to do is make it
[1:03:19] his Perfection and let his Spirit work
[1:03:21] through us and work and operate that
[1:03:24] gift inside of our life if we're trying
[1:03:26] to do it it's
[1:03:28] political we need to be careful and not
[1:03:31] be
[1:03:32] deceived now if it wasn't genuine what
[1:03:34] was it it was the husk the
[1:03:38] shaff in the green soft sheath form it
[1:03:42] looked like it was the real thing it has
[1:03:45] the appearance of it but as one can go
[1:03:48] into the field and see what looks
[1:03:51] exactly like wheat and yet it's only the
[1:03:54] husk for the wheat seed has not yet
[1:03:58] formed so this was but the soft shell
[1:04:02] that looked like the real grain Yet to
[1:04:05] Come the original wheat seed of
[1:04:08] Pentecost was to come back in the last
[1:04:11] age it had been buried at
[1:04:14] NAA it sent up a Chute at Sardis it grew
[1:04:19] a tassle at
[1:04:21] Philadelphia and it was mature at Le
[1:04:24] oysa
[1:04:26] but it could not be back to the original
[1:04:30] until the word was
[1:04:33] restored and isn't it beautiful to think
[1:04:36] there was a time where the word was
[1:04:38] restored at the end of the prophetic
[1:04:41] utterance of the seven Church age
[1:04:44] messenger at the end of his ministry he
[1:04:47] was preaching prepare ye way of the Lord
[1:04:50] he was preaching the second coming word
[1:04:53] coming of the Lord the manifestation of
[1:04:55] it get ready because he's coming as John
[1:04:58] the Baptist was sent to forrun the first
[1:05:00] coming so your ministry will be sent to
[1:05:02] forerun the second coming of the Lord
[1:05:05] that was his
[1:05:06] commission but there came a point in
[1:05:08] time where he had to say Behold the Lamb
[1:05:11] of God I'm not even worthy to do his
[1:05:14] shoes but he's standing here right
[1:05:18] now and that's happened that's
[1:05:21] history isn't it beautiful to think
[1:05:23] about that to realize that so where is
[1:05:25] he now oh my it's
[1:05:30] beautiful the original wheat seed at
[1:05:32] Pentecost was to come back in this last
[1:05:34] age it had been buried at Nia sent up a
[1:05:36] shoot at Sardis grew a tassel at
[1:05:38] Philadelphia it was mature at leoda but
[1:05:42] could not be back to the original until
[1:05:44] the word was restored the prophet had
[1:05:48] not yet come upon the scene but now
[1:05:52] according to the end time to the time
[1:05:55] when wherein we stand in the leodan age
[1:05:58] the prophet messenger of Revelations
[1:06:00] 10:7 must already be in the land it's
[1:06:04] beautiful he doesn't name himself he
[1:06:07] just says he must already be in the Land
[1:06:09] once more thus saith the Lord must be
[1:06:12] here ready to be
[1:06:14] manifested with infallible
[1:06:19] Vindication thus the true seed already
[1:06:23] maturing and then the Harvest
[1:06:26] it's so beautiful when you can read this
[1:06:28] and you can see it when you understand
[1:06:30] the message of the hour you understand
[1:06:32] the messenger to the age we understand
[1:06:35] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:06:37] we understand how God moves how he
[1:06:39] changes not that he is the same
[1:06:41] yesterday today and forever when we can
[1:06:43] see sort of the whole picture and take a
[1:06:44] step backwards to recognize that this is
[1:06:48] actually what's happening she has thus
[1:06:51] sayith the Lord if he is in her and she
[1:06:54] has the mind of Christ to know what to
[1:06:56] do with
[1:06:58] it so many people are trying to make
[1:07:00] this happen trying to Manifest this and
[1:07:04] it's not going to
[1:07:05] work Harvest time period yes Harvest
[1:07:09] Time the two vines that grew together
[1:07:13] and
[1:07:14] intertwined their branches are now to be
[1:07:18] separated and it's beautiful because
[1:07:21] what does the separating we talked about
[1:07:22] a little earlier it's not going to be a
[1:07:24] government p push brother Bram says it
[1:07:26] in the message it's not going to be a
[1:07:28] government push I think it's in uh
[1:07:30] recognizing your day in this message
[1:07:32] brother brandham says it very clearly
[1:07:34] that it's not going to be a government
[1:07:36] push that puts the church in the Rapture
[1:07:39] it's going to be the word of God that
[1:07:41] puts the church in the
[1:07:43] Rapture don't think that a squeeze is
[1:07:46] going to come along and squeeze us out
[1:07:47] of that shuck and cause us to jump up to
[1:07:50] heaven that's not what's going to happen
[1:07:52] the changing of our characters is what's
[1:07:54] going to put into the Rapture he is the
[1:07:57] same yesterday today and forever when
[1:07:59] did he come on the scene he was 30 years
[1:08:01] after the promise for the children of
[1:08:02] Israel and in in Egypt and when did he
[1:08:05] come in he came in when they started to
[1:08:07] cry when they were sighing and crying
[1:08:10] and he said hey I hear the cries of my
[1:08:12] children oh my I remember my promise to
[1:08:15] them what did he do he sent them a
[1:08:18] deliverer we know that's coming in the
[1:08:20] day in which we live Harvest Time yes
[1:08:22] Harvest Time the two vines that grew
[1:08:24] together and intertwined their branches
[1:08:26] are now to be separated by the preaching
[1:08:29] of the word the true word the fruits of
[1:08:32] those
[1:08:33] Vines which were at such variance will
[1:08:37] be gathered into separate Garners the
[1:08:40] two spirits will go to their separate
[1:08:44] destinations can you imagine what it's
[1:08:46] going to be like to go to the separate
[1:08:47] destination with no Antichrist spirit
[1:08:50] with no temptation with no problems no
[1:08:53] heartaches no sorrow no nothing a brand
[1:08:57] new world a brand new life a brand new
[1:08:59] existence a brand new thought plane like
[1:09:03] brother banam talked about the hog
[1:09:04] nature would you ever want to be at
[1:09:06] Banks Woods would you ever want a
[1:09:07] squirrel hunt in heaven would you want
[1:09:08] to go back to being a hog on Earth or
[1:09:11] would you want to actually go to the
[1:09:13] level of being a human being would we
[1:09:14] want to go from being a human being born
[1:09:17] in sin shaped in iniquity come in the
[1:09:18] world speaking lies in the Hog Pen stay
[1:09:21] there or go on into True Perfection my
[1:09:25] goodness that's the day in which we
[1:09:28] live the two spirits will go to their
[1:09:30] separate destinations now is the time to
[1:09:33] heed the final call that comes only to
[1:09:37] the wheat Bride come out of her my
[1:09:40] people that you be not partakers of her
[1:09:42] sins and that ye wheat receive not her
[1:09:46] tears plagues the Great Tribulation of
[1:09:49] the six seal and Matthew
[1:09:53] 24 my I had a little
[1:09:55] bit of a a panic there I thought maybe
[1:09:58] we're getting a little bit late we still
[1:10:00] got lots of time all
[1:10:05] right the last warning of the spirit
[1:10:08] Revelations
[1:10:09] 3:22 he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:10:12] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:10:15] this is the last
[1:10:16] warning there will not be
[1:10:18] another the throne room has been set up
[1:10:22] the 12 foundations have been laid the
[1:10:25] streets of gold have been paved the
[1:10:29] gates of gigantic pearls are raised and
[1:10:33] hinged like a pyramid she stands so fair
[1:10:37] and
[1:10:38] glorious the Heavenly beings who have
[1:10:41] prepared her watch
[1:10:45] breathlessly for she glistens and shines
[1:10:49] with a glory that is
[1:10:53] unearthly now we can look at this and
[1:10:56] say that's a city that's been made and
[1:11:00] indeed I would say it has been and we'll
[1:11:03] walk there one day but I just want to
[1:11:06] say this brothers and
[1:11:07] sisters what if we were actually to take
[1:11:10] and and stop looking at that that
[1:11:14] description from the idea that it's
[1:11:16] going to be a a manufactured city that
[1:11:18] was built it was it was fabricated all
[1:11:21] of the best ingredients were sourced
[1:11:24] from all of the Universe all of creation
[1:11:28] the best that God could could possibly
[1:11:31] create for us from his spoken word all
[1:11:33] of those materials are implemented into
[1:11:36] this city you know when the Mormons
[1:11:38] build a temple I had the the luxury I'll
[1:11:42] call it of going through the Mormon
[1:11:43] Temple when they opened it in Northwest
[1:11:45] Calgary we had a painter who was a
[1:11:47] Mormon and a part of that assembly and
[1:11:49] he invited me and they tried to coax me
[1:11:51] over to their side and I I thanked him
[1:11:54] graciously for the milk and cookies and
[1:11:56] said I got to go but to see what they
[1:11:59] did in there was just it's astounding
[1:12:01] what they do in their temples their
[1:12:03] stuff is not locally sourced it's
[1:12:05] sourced from all over the world all over
[1:12:07] the globe and I think it's as as much
[1:12:09] money as they can spend is what they try
[1:12:12] and do they have a baptismal tank that's
[1:12:15] literally two stories tall manufactured
[1:12:18] to look like the the washing tub in the
[1:12:21] temple in Israel it's literally out
[1:12:24] carved out of one stone two stories tall
[1:12:29] it's crazy how magnificent it is that's
[1:12:32] that's the Earthly thing that's the
[1:12:34] probably the greatest description I
[1:12:36] could talk about the Vatican we'
[1:12:37] probably many of us have been there so
[1:12:39] many different things that we've seen
[1:12:41] naturally here we have God talking about
[1:12:43] this description through his Prophet but
[1:12:46] what I want to get to brothers and
[1:12:47] sisters is what if we could actually
[1:12:49] step back and say that's nice to talk
[1:12:51] about a city but what if he's actually
[1:12:53] describing his bride
[1:12:56] let's read this again and look at it
[1:12:58] from that perspective because we know
[1:13:01] that John was asked do you want to see
[1:13:04] the bride the Lamb's wife and he said oh
[1:13:07] sure and him being turned what did he
[1:13:10] see a city coming down from God out of
[1:13:14] heaven so let's read this here I think
[1:13:17] it's interesting this is the last
[1:13:19] warning there will not be another the
[1:13:20] throne room has been set up the 12
[1:13:23] foundations have already been laid the
[1:13:24] street streets of gold have been paved
[1:13:26] the gates of gigantic pearls are raised
[1:13:29] in hinge like a pyramid she stands so
[1:13:32] fair and glorious the Heavenly beings
[1:13:35] who have prepared
[1:13:37] her right watch
[1:13:40] breathlessly for she glistens and shines
[1:13:43] with a glory that is
[1:13:46] unearthly when you look at yourself in
[1:13:48] the mirror when I look at myself in the
[1:13:50] mirror this is coming to me fresh right
[1:13:51] now let's look at ourselves in the
[1:13:53] mirror with his description
[1:13:55] words with his adjectives this is how he
[1:13:59] sees us this is what's going on in
[1:14:01] heaven while they wait for us to realize
[1:14:04] who we
[1:14:05] are but boy once we do there will be no
[1:14:08] word that will get in the way remember
[1:14:10] the prophet said it don't let anything
[1:14:12] get between you and that word don't let
[1:14:16] any man don't let any church don't let
[1:14:18] any political movement don't let nothing
[1:14:20] get between you and that
[1:14:23] word I just think is
[1:14:25] beautiful the Heavenly beings who have
[1:14:28] prepared her watch
[1:14:31] breathlessly for she glistens and shines
[1:14:34] with a glory that is
[1:14:35] unearthly and so our theophanies wait
[1:14:38] for us brothers and
[1:14:40] sisters they're just waiting for us
[1:14:44] every facet of her beauty tells a story
[1:14:48] of Amazing Grace and Jesus
[1:14:53] love she is a city prepared for a
[1:14:57] prepared
[1:14:59] people she awaits only for her inhabit
[1:15:02] inhabitant and soon they will throng her
[1:15:05] streets with joy yes it is the last call
[1:15:09] the spirit will not speak in another age
[1:15:12] the ages are over so for someone to come
[1:15:15] along and have this call it a pet
[1:15:17] Doctrine an eighth messenger you know
[1:15:19] call call me the guy I'm the guru you
[1:15:22] should you should maybe baptize in my
[1:15:24] name and maybe he won't say that but the
[1:15:26] people will start to because of the
[1:15:27] anointing that he has they'll believe
[1:15:29] he's so good they'll just want to fall
[1:15:31] in a shadow they want to touch him they
[1:15:33] want him to touch their babies Etc all
[1:15:35] of that all in the guise of the message
[1:15:37] of the hour it happens it's real there's
[1:15:40] no eth messenger there's no other person
[1:15:43] the word has already been perfected it's
[1:15:46] already been given
[1:15:50] entirely she is a city
[1:15:52] prepared for a prepared people
[1:15:55] she awaits only for her inhabitants and
[1:15:58] soon they will throng her streets with
[1:16:00] joy yes it is the last call the spirit
[1:16:04] will not speak at another age the ages
[1:16:06] are over I just can't help to think
[1:16:08] about what it will be like to actually
[1:16:10] jump out of this this Earthly robe of
[1:16:13] Flesh right this Earthly Tabernacle when
[1:16:16] it will be dissolved there's already
[1:16:17] another one waiting for us right what
[1:16:20] will it be like to have no restrictions
[1:16:22] in that body because we won't have to to
[1:16:25] worry about any restrictions there won't
[1:16:26] be any sin there won't be any Temptation
[1:16:29] we'll just be able to live as free as we
[1:16:31] were ever created like a bird in a cage
[1:16:34] that has all the strength that it ever
[1:16:35] needs one day that that lid will be just
[1:16:38] lifted off and that bird can fly to its
[1:16:40] heart's content to explore the way it
[1:16:43] was designed to that's where we're at
[1:16:45] that's where we're going the ages are
[1:16:47] over my goodness but thank God at this
[1:16:50] moment this age is not over he is yet
[1:16:53] crying and his cry is not only to the in
[1:16:57] the spiritual ears of men by his Spirit
[1:17:01] but once again a prophet is in the Land
[1:17:04] once more God will reveal the truth as
[1:17:07] he did to Paul in the days of the
[1:17:10] seventh messenger in the days of the
[1:17:13] leoan age its Messenger will reveal the
[1:17:17] mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he
[1:17:20] will speak out and those who receive
[1:17:24] that prophet in his own name will
[1:17:28] receive the Ben
[1:17:31] beneficient effect of that prophet's
[1:17:34] Ministry
[1:17:36] amen and they that hear him will be
[1:17:39] blessed and become part of that Bride of
[1:17:43] the last day who is mentioned in
[1:17:45] Revelations
[1:17:48] 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come
[1:17:58] the corn of wheat the bride wheat that
[1:18:02] fell into the ground at
[1:18:04] NAA has come back to the original word
[1:18:07] grain
[1:18:09] again praise God forever yes listen to
[1:18:13] the authenticated prophet of God who
[1:18:16] appears in this last age what he says
[1:18:19] from God the bride will
[1:18:22] say period
[1:18:26] period I think that's so good the spirit
[1:18:30] and the prophet and the bride will be
[1:18:33] saying the same
[1:18:35] thing so when we hear someone saying
[1:18:39] something different and I'm I'm going to
[1:18:41] say this brothers and sisters it's one
[1:18:42] thing to say it but I believe this with
[1:18:45] all my heart we're not just talking
[1:18:47] about what we're saying we're talking
[1:18:49] about what we're
[1:18:52] living talk is cheap I can get up here
[1:18:55] and preach a storm up and not live this
[1:18:58] life and what good is that we have got
[1:19:02] to be living what we're
[1:19:04] preaching what he says from God the
[1:19:07] bride will say and
[1:19:11] live this isn't the Bible so I'm going
[1:19:14] to add to it I'm not going to take away
[1:19:17] from it but I'm going to throw words in
[1:19:18] there and live we'll be living what the
[1:19:22] spirit says we'll be living what the
[1:19:25] prophet says we won't be living another
[1:19:28] life the spirit and the prophet and the
[1:19:31] bride will be saying and living the same
[1:19:34] thing and what they will say will have
[1:19:38] already been said in the
[1:19:42] word it's not a new
[1:19:45] revelation Paul said it if an angel from
[1:19:48] heaven comes and says anything else to
[1:19:51] you than that which we have already said
[1:19:55] said let him be accursed this was the
[1:19:58] first church AE messenger remember he
[1:20:00] was the one setting the pattern in order
[1:20:02] for all the other
[1:20:04] ages again say I unto thee if an angel
[1:20:08] messenger says anything else than what
[1:20:10] we've already preached to you forget
[1:20:13] about it and get back to the
[1:20:18] word and what they will say will have
[1:20:21] already been said in the word they are
[1:20:23] saying it now come out from among her
[1:20:26] now and be ye separate the cry has gone
[1:20:29] out the cry is going out how long will
[1:20:32] the voice cry we don't
[1:20:34] know but one thing we do
[1:20:37] know it won't be long for this is the
[1:20:40] last
[1:20:42] age he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:20:45] what the spirit saith to the
[1:20:48] churches you know what I'm going to do
[1:20:50] tonight I'm going to call the musicians
[1:20:52] and I'm going to actually close a little
[1:20:53] bit early tonight
[1:20:55] I'm just going to we'll pick up the
[1:20:58] resume of the ages as we go I uh yeah
[1:21:02] I'm just going to do that I just feel
[1:21:04] led to do that we're going to do that
[1:21:06] we'll close here on this paragraph
[1:21:09] 188 he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:21:13] what the spirit saith to the
[1:21:16] churches the spirit has
[1:21:18] spoken the Setting Sun is about to fade
[1:21:21] into
[1:21:23] Eternity for the the church ages then it
[1:21:26] will be all
[1:21:28] over then it will be too late to
[1:21:31] come you know I have this sentence High
[1:21:33] highlighted in here and and I think it's
[1:21:35] so important because it's beautiful what
[1:21:39] he says here if somewhere in this
[1:21:42] series God has dealt with you by his
[1:21:45] Spirit may you even now turn to him in
[1:21:49] Repentance and give your life to him
[1:21:52] that by his Spirit he may give you etal
[1:21:54] etal life and you know some might say
[1:21:58] brother Barry what are you saying here
[1:22:00] I've got eternal life maybe we do but
[1:22:04] maybe sometimes the tears that grow up
[1:22:07] around us can get us all tangled
[1:22:09] up and we just get into a position where
[1:22:12] we just don't know where we
[1:22:14] stand we can we can actually get those
[1:22:17] tears snipped off of us and we can
[1:22:20] actually come back to the word and we
[1:22:22] can have a refilling of his spirit
[1:22:25] and I believe that's what he's saying
[1:22:27] here if somewhere in the series God has
[1:22:28] dealt with you by his Spirit may you
[1:22:30] even now turn to him in Repentance and
[1:22:33] give your life to him that by his Spirit
[1:22:36] he may give you eternal
[1:22:37] life this this is not the age to to just
[1:22:41] simply have a new birth this is the age
[1:22:44] to actually give way to a new birth the
[1:22:47] life of Jesus Christ inside of us not to
[1:22:50] just dwell upon milk continually
[1:22:52] dwelling upon milk no this is the time
[1:22:55] to actually Feast on the the body word
[1:22:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ to eat his
[1:23:02] flesh and to drink his blood that we
[1:23:05] have life in us that's the age in which
[1:23:08] we live in and I know we all know this
[1:23:10] maybe stand with me as we close but if
[1:23:12] somewhere in this series God has dealt
[1:23:14] with you by his Spirit just just raise
[1:23:16] your cup unto him and say thank you Lord
[1:23:20] and if you need something else from him
[1:23:22] just ask him amen he's more than able
[1:23:25] more than willing to give it to us what
[1:23:27] a wonderful God we
[1:23:29] serve may you even now turn to him in
[1:23:33] Repentance and give your life to him
[1:23:36] that by his Spirit he may give you
[1:23:39] eternal life let's just bow in
[1:23:41] prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[1:23:44] Jesus tonight we're just so thankful
[1:23:46] that we can gather together in Your
[1:23:48] Name Lord we don't know how many more
[1:23:51] times we'll be able to do
[1:23:53] this and many times it can sound like a
[1:23:56] Wednesday night cliche to say
[1:23:59] that but we live in an age where we've
[1:24:02] experienced it
[1:24:04] Lord where the government pressure has
[1:24:07] changed our ability to worship you in
[1:24:09] spirit and in
[1:24:12] truth it's changed our ability to gather
[1:24:15] together in your name and we know one of
[1:24:17] these days it's going to happen again
[1:24:20] and it'll be
[1:24:21] forever but we know that Lord
[1:24:25] there will be nothing that will ever
[1:24:26] stop your spirit from worshiping through
[1:24:30] your
[1:24:31] bride so Lord tonight I just want to
[1:24:33] commit each life into your hands For
[1:24:35] Your
[1:24:36] Glory I pray that as we read these words
[1:24:39] Lord as we eat the book father that it
[1:24:42] would change us from glory to glory that
[1:24:44] it would change us from the inside that
[1:24:46] there would be things in this book that
[1:24:49] that speak to our hearts Lord that speak
[1:24:51] to our very Souls Lord Jesus that cause
[1:24:55] us to want more of you and less of
[1:24:58] us father I pray that Lord if there's
[1:25:00] anybody here that needs more of you
[1:25:02] tonight that you would just grant it to
[1:25:04] them
[1:25:05] Father if anybody here doesn't know you
[1:25:07] in the full power of your Resurrection I
[1:25:11] pray that you would Grant it to them
[1:25:12] tonight father amen Lord Jesus that we
[1:25:15] would not be groping in darkness that we
[1:25:17] would know you in the fullest
[1:25:19] manifestation of your power for the age
[1:25:21] in which we live Lord we know you sent a
[1:25:24] prophet ET to call out a bride Lord so
[1:25:26] that she wouldn't actually stay as a
[1:25:28] bride that she would come on to the
[1:25:29] marriage supper of the Lamb that she
[1:25:31] would be willing to be so consecrated
[1:25:33] that she could be called your wife that
[1:25:36] she herself would make herself ready
[1:25:39] that she would recognize the position
[1:25:41] that you have called her to help us Lord
[1:25:44] Jesus to recognize the position that you
[1:25:46] have called The Bride of this last age
[1:25:50] too father we love you and we thank you
[1:25:53] we just commit each life into your hands
