[6:27] Amen.
[6:28] Welcome once again this evening
[6:32] washing always a special service
[6:35] says happier if you do these things and
[6:37] I always leave this service happier than
[6:40] what I certainly thank the Lord for that
[6:42] I thank the Lord for years to year I to
[6:45] see his glorious truth as I know you do
[6:47] as well God bless you this this evening
[6:50] and start with singing above all powers
[6:54] thinking about this night before the
[6:56] Lord was crucified thinking that just
[6:58] preparing for the songs, how somber that
[7:00] evening was. And he washed the disciples
[7:03] feet, gave the wine, gave the bread. It
[7:06] was a somber night. They had no idea
[7:08] what they were about to walk into, but
[7:10] he knew that he loved us despite all of
[7:13] that. He washed, he humbled himself.
[7:16] Here we are tonight commemorating that
[7:19] and honoring that. He said, "If you love
[7:21] me, keep my commandments." We are doing
[7:23] that tonight. Above all powers, above
[7:25] all kings, crucified,
[7:28] he laid there for you and I. Well, above
[7:30] all powers,

[13:52] You took me home
[13:55] and you thought me.
[14:01] [Music]
[14:18] Let us bow our hearts this evening.
[14:22] Oh Lord Jesus,
[14:24] above all powers, above all kingdom.
[14:28] Oh Lord, you were crucified because of
[14:30] me. Oh Lord. Yes. Oh Lord Jesus, when we
[14:34] think of ourselves,
[14:36] we will not know how can how we can be
[14:39] saved. Lord, but if knowing you, when we
[14:43] know you, Lord, we don't even know how
[14:45] can we be lost. Oh Lord Jesus, we're so
[14:48] thankful unto you that we know you Lord.
[14:51] We are with you. We are in you. You are
[14:54] in us, oh Lord. How can we be lost when
[14:56] we know you, oh Lord Jesus, with our
[14:59] flesh, with our spirit, oh Lord Jesus,
[15:03] we cannot be saved by our own merits,
[15:06] Lord. But you have elected us, oh Lord,
[15:08] before the foundation of the world, oh
[15:10] Lord Jesus. Oh, we thank you, oh Lord.
[15:13] That that is an inalienable right, Lord.
[15:17] It was preached this morning, oh Lord
[15:18] Jesus. When you say it, Lord, because
[15:21] you are the king, it cannot be changed,
[15:23] Lord. It is in your word, oh Lord. We
[15:26] just claim for that promise. Oh Lord
[15:28] Jesus, help us, Lord. When we are
[15:30] sealed, oh Lord, we are sealed until our
[15:34] redemption. Oh Lord, we might be Lord uh
[15:38] thinking that we are not worthy. Yes,
[15:40] Lord, we are not worthy. But you put
[15:43] yourselves in our place, Lord. You
[15:45] became sin, Lord Jesus, so that we'll
[15:47] become the righteousness of God, Lord.
[15:50] That's the only thing we can be saved.
[15:52] That's the only thing we can be
[15:53] redeemed, Lord. And we thank you for
[15:55] that, Lord. Oh, Lord. Your crucifixion.
[15:58] We know we talk about resurrection,
[16:01] Lord. That is full justification because
[16:03] you we fully belong to you, Lord. You
[16:06] owned us completely, oh Lord Jesus.
[16:08] That's why you want us to be redeemed,
[16:10] Lord. And that's the only way we can do
[16:12] that Lord is to Lord help us to Lord to
[16:15] be uh uh at rest Lord Jesus knowing this
[16:18] Lord because we are free and we are free
[16:21] indeed Lord because of such sacrifice
[16:23] Lord. Oh God, we're so thankful unto
[16:26] you. We can gather like this, Lord. You
[16:28] gave us example, Lord, to to gather like
[16:31] this, Lord, to wash each other's feet,
[16:34] Lord, in humility so that we we can
[16:37] discern the Lord's body as well, Lord,
[16:39] with communion, Lord Jesus, because we
[16:41] belong to you, Lord Jesus. And oh Lord,
[16:44] we want to thank you, Lord. We're so
[16:47] grateful, Lord, for such revelation,
[16:50] Lord. It's not only partially revealed,
[16:52] Lord. is full revelation oh Lord of your
[16:55] word Lord that's where we stand Lord
[16:57] Jesus because your word even higher your
[17:00] than your name Lord because somebody
[17:03] else can use your name but it's not if
[17:05] it's not according to your word Lord it
[17:08] it's not effective Lord Jesus oh Lord
[17:11] help us Lord thank you Lord for for your
[17:13] direction Lord towards the full word
[17:15] Lord not partial word oh Lord we we just

[17:34] testimonies are manifestations of your
[17:36] word in our lives Lord Jesus we want

[24:31] and raise
[24:34] a hope for tomorrow
[24:40] across
[24:42] our path.
[24:46] Oh, and I see
[24:50] a crimson stream of blood.

[24:59] from

[33:35] bless tonight? Welcome to the house of
[33:37] the Lord. Amen.
[33:40] Amen. An honor and a privilege to gather
[33:42] together with you
[33:45] and you have tonight.
[33:52] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful that
[33:54] we can do this tonight
[33:57] together
[33:59] for us, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[34:07] Amen. Even with the one that you knew
[34:10] was a devil.
[34:13] Father, you knowing all things, you
[34:15] pushed aside all of your
[34:19] and made yourself a servant, the king of
[34:22] kings, lord of lords,
[34:25] for our sake, that tonight we could
[34:27] follow your word.
[34:30] Father, tonight we just want to
[34:32] consecrate ourselves unto you, Lord. We
[34:34] pray that if there's any sin in our
[34:36] lives, Lord, any unbelief, Father, that
[34:39] you would just forgive us for it now,
[34:41] Lord, that we can approach your throne
[34:44] of mercy and grace in our time of need.
[34:47] Father, if there ever was a time of need
[34:49] in this world right now, Father, we pray
[34:52] that you would just minister to the
[34:53] hearts of your children tonight. That
[34:55] you would minister to the needs in their
[34:57] lives, Lord. Father, that you would just
[35:00] help each one of us, Lord Jesus, draw
[35:02] closer to you, Father, we pray that when
[35:05] we leave this service tonight, we would
[35:07] be able to say that we are closer than
[35:09] we've ever been to you before. Amen.
[35:12] Father, we love you and we thank you. We
[35:13] just want to commit the needs and the
[35:15] service into your hands now for your
[35:17] glory. Jesus Christ.
[35:22] Thank you.
[35:27] Have your Bibles tonight. I uh not going
[35:29] to preach long. I'm just going to say
[35:32] what the prophet said and move on
[35:40] to
[35:46] a very familiar scripture. I'm sure it's
[35:48] all very
[36:00] verse 14.
[36:04] Seeing then that we have a great high
[36:08] priest that has passed into the heavens,
[36:12] Jesus the son of God.
[36:16] Let us hold fast our profession
[36:21] for we have not and high priest which
[36:24] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[36:27] our infirmities
[36:29] but was in all points tempted like we
[36:32] are. And I would say this even to death.
[36:38] He was tempted in all points as we are
[36:41] even to death yet without sin.
[36:46] Let us therefore come boldly unto the
[36:49] throne of grace. Amen. that we may
[36:52] obtain mercy and find grace to help in
[36:56] the time of need. May God add a blessing
[36:59] to the reading of his word. You may be
[37:01] seated tonight.
[37:04] Tonight, I just feel my desire is that
[37:08] verse 16 would just be our testimony
[37:10] that we can come boldly before his
[37:13] throne of grace
[37:15] that we may obtain mercy and find grace
[37:18] to help. Amen. in the time of need. And
[37:21] I can't I can't help but think that
[37:22] there has never been a greater time
[37:25] where we need help, where we have a need
[37:28] in our lives.
[37:31] There's so much uncertainty in the
[37:32] world, but we have more certainty of
[37:36] this word than we do of anything else
[37:38] that we have to contend with in this
[37:40] life. And sometimes we can get caught up
[37:43] in this life and forget that. Forget
[37:45] that we have one. I think it's so
[37:49] beautiful.
[37:51] Inalienable
[37:53] right, an inalienable
[37:56] promise. It is the grace of God that he
[38:00] has given us, his grace. We don't live
[38:02] under the law. Some choose to live under
[38:04] the law. And we know what happens when
[38:05] we do that. That brings death because
[38:08] there was a corner turned. And if we're
[38:10] still going straight when there was a
[38:12] corner turned, we've missed the turn.
[38:14] We've missed the point. But the point is
[38:17] for us is that we are living under
[38:19] grace. We are not living under under the
[38:22] law. Tonight we're here for a communion
[38:25] service, for a footwashing service. Two
[38:27] out of the three ordinances that brother
[38:29] Brandham talked about that the Lord gave
[38:31] us. He gave the end time church. There's
[38:33] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[38:35] Jesus Christ. There's communion, eating
[38:38] the bread and drinking the wine,
[38:40] partaking and discerning of the Lord's
[38:43] body and footwashing, humbling ourselves
[38:46] before one another and recognizing that
[38:49] if the King of Kings would come and do
[38:51] that, come and perform the duty of a
[38:54] footwash flunky, how much more ought we
[38:57] be willing to do that to one another?
[39:00] And it's just tremendous when we see one
[39:02] another come out to a service like this
[39:04] because it's out of the ordinary. It
[39:06] really is out of the ordinary compared
[39:08] to what this world does. And it's
[39:10] amazing to think that we have the not
[39:13] only the ability to because everybody
[39:15] has the ability to, but we have the
[39:17] desire to. And you know, the word says
[39:19] that happy are we when we do this. And
[39:22] you all know full well that's why you're
[39:24] here tonight that after this service we
[39:27] feel like we could fly.
[39:30] We feel like we are energized like we
[39:32] have a new a new experience like
[39:35] something happens to us. We have another
[39:38] word cell upon word cell in our hearts.
[39:41] It's just amazing what happens from
[39:43] these services. And I just want to
[39:46] encourage us. I don't want to discourage
[39:48] us. I want to encourage us that we have
[39:50] the greatest promise that was ever given
[39:53] to this world and that is eternal life.
[39:56] And you know the second promise outside
[39:58] of that, brother Brham said full well is
[40:01] our spouse.
[40:03] That is the greatest thing that God
[40:05] could give us outside of our salvation.
[40:07] That's what he told us. It's just
[40:10] amazing. and uh you know he he never
[40:12] ever fails to uh to satisfy if we give
[40:17] him the opportunity. Tonight I have one
[40:19] quote that I want to read. It's out of
[40:21] the final message that brother Brandham
[40:23] ministered before he went off the air.
[40:26] You know he said that before we go off
[40:28] the air in 1965 in the preaching of the
[40:32] invisible union of the bride, his
[40:33] thanksgiving message. Before we go off
[40:36] of the air, he had something else he
[40:38] wanted to say, and we've already read it
[40:40] last time, that you are the sinless,
[40:43] virtuous, spotless bride of Jesus
[40:46] Christ. That it's like you never did it
[40:48] in the first place. And then he goes on
[40:51] to say that you never did do it in the
[40:53] first place, that you were tricked into
[40:55] it. It's the devil that did it. We never
[40:58] did it, but yet the devil wants to try
[41:01] and make us feel like we have done it.
[41:03] It's almost like the Now I could get a
[41:05] little bit political and some people
[41:07] might get a little upset by this, but if
[41:09] we talk about the Aboriginals in this
[41:11] land in Canada specifically, somewhere
[41:14] along the way, somebody came and took
[41:15] the land away from them and claimed it
[41:17] for their own. And and now there is a
[41:21] whole entire thing set up with treaties
[41:23] where people are are are paying what
[41:27] what do they call it? Apparitions.
[41:29] I can't remember the proper word for
[41:31] that. But for for the sins of the
[41:34] forefathers, now the people today are
[41:36] taking a burden financially and giving
[41:38] it to the people who aren't even the
[41:41] recipients of someone stealing their
[41:43] land. Nobody stole their land today, but
[41:45] yet people today are paying money out of
[41:47] their pocket as taxpayers for something
[41:50] that they never did.
[41:53] I'm trying to draw a parallel here to
[41:55] think that we never sinned. The devil is
[41:57] the one that sinned. The devil is the
[41:59] one that came into the Garden of Eden.
[42:01] Adam and Eve are the ones that actually
[42:03] caused the situation and caused everyone
[42:05] else to have to live in the environment.
[42:08] And I get it that we're living in the
[42:09] environment here. But we never did it.
[42:12] Neither did the people who are receiving
[42:14] the payment. They never did it either.
[42:15] It was other people that did it. But we
[42:18] can choose to celebrate the fact that
[42:20] people did do that and they did us
[42:22] wrong. Or we can choose to celebrate
[42:25] that we are together and that we're
[42:27] alive and that we can share this land.
[42:29] But as humans, that will never be the
[42:31] case in this world. It's just the way
[42:33] the world is, human nature. But talking
[42:36] about it spiritually, we never did it in
[42:38] the first place. When we are that
[42:41] sinless, spotless, virtuous bride of
[42:43] Jesus Christ, the one that he chose in
[42:45] him before the foundation of the world,
[42:47] we never did it in the first place. And
[42:49] it just breaks all of the paradigms. It
[42:52] gives us a free pass almost to think
[42:54] that you you you many times we get into
[42:56] trouble in our lives, but you know, you
[42:58] never did it.
[43:00] The children are loving it right now.
[43:02] You never did it in the first place.
[43:04] The devil did it. You were born in sin,
[43:07] shaped in iniquity, come in the world
[43:09] speaking lies. Every single one of us
[43:10] had to go through that. But we have to
[43:12] learn how to function in this world. And
[43:16] the greatest function that we could ever
[43:17] get in this world is to surrender our
[43:18] lives to Jesus Christ. out of the
[43:22] message communion in 1965.
[43:26] As brother Brham goes off the air, he
[43:28] begins to explain this. This is the very
[43:30] last message that he preached before he
[43:33] drove back to Jeffersonville, Indiana,
[43:35] and got into the car accident over in
[43:38] Texas. He says, "Now over now, the 23rd
[43:42] verse of the 11th chapter of the first
[43:44] Corinthians, listen at Paul now. Now
[43:48] remember and keep this in mind.
[43:50] Galatians 1:8, "If we or an angel from
[43:53] heaven preaches any other gospel unto
[43:56] you, than this gospel that he had
[44:00] preached, let him be accursed." See,
[44:04] so he goes on to preach now to read the
[44:08] scripture here. For I have received of
[44:09] the Lord that which I also delivered
[44:11] unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same
[44:15] night in which he was betrayed, took
[44:16] bread, and when he had gave thanks, he
[44:20] broke it, said, "Take, eat. This is my
[44:22] body which is broken for you. This do in
[44:25] remembrance of me."
[44:28] Now, let me stop right here to say, but
[44:31] taking the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:35] in this communion does not mean that
[44:38] that communion is the literal body of
[44:41] Christ.
[44:43] That's Catholic. I do not believe that
[44:46] that's right. I believe it's only an
[44:49] ordinance that God made with us. See, it
[44:53] isn't the actual body. It's now it's
[44:57] really a little piece of kosher bread.
[44:59] It's just an ordinance.
[45:02] Neither do I believe that the baptism of
[45:06] Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ
[45:09] in water does forgive your sins.
[45:13] It doesn't forgive your sins. Brother
[45:16] Barry's going to jump in and say that is
[45:18] an outward expression of the inward work
[45:21] that's taken place. We recognize that
[45:23] the word of God says that we ought to be
[45:25] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[45:27] Christ. So, we go ahead and we do that
[45:30] because it's an instruction from the
[45:32] Lord. That's part of his will.
[45:36] Talking about this bread and the body,
[45:40] discerning the Lord's body is what's
[45:42] happening when we're taking that little
[45:44] piece of kosher bread. We're discerning
[45:47] that the Lord's body was broken for our
[45:49] sake, for that dual covenant. His body
[45:53] was broken. His bones weren't broken.
[45:56] His body was broken. And we know that
[45:58] his body was almost broken to the point
[46:01] where he gave up the ghost before he
[46:03] even made it to the cross. But yet, he
[46:05] still understood that we needed a high
[46:09] priest. So he continued to bear that
[46:12] cross not for his sake, for our sake.
[46:16] But he goes on to say here, neither do I
[46:18] believe that the baptism of Jesus Christ
[46:20] in the name of Jesus Christ in water
[46:23] does not does forgive your sins. I do
[46:25] not believe that you I believe that you
[46:28] could be baptized all day long.
[46:33] Now, here's one thing that brother
[46:34] Brandham says. It's not right here in
[46:35] this message, but he says people can
[46:37] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[46:39] hour of their life and still go to hell.
[46:44] That's a very confusing statement and I
[46:46] think it's really important. I'm just
[46:48] going to say it and I hope we can get
[46:49] some questions because we're still
[46:50] looking for questions so that we can
[46:52] bring answers. Don't be bashful. Write
[46:54] your questions down and uh and we'll
[46:56] address them. But how can that possibly
[46:58] be? Some people can actually be uh under
[47:00] the anointing of the Holy Ghost every
[47:02] hour of their life is what brother Brham
[47:05] is referring to, but not actually go all
[47:07] the way past Kadesh Barnea. Not to step
[47:12] past that and say, you know what, I
[47:13] believe that we can take the land
[47:15] because he said we can.
[47:18] Sometimes people will look at it and
[47:20] say, you know, I'll come right up to
[47:21] that line and see that there is a
[47:23] promised land and see that there's fruit
[47:25] over there and see that everything is
[47:27] good exactly like we've been promised.
[47:29] That's what the type is of Kadesh Barnea
[47:32] and the 12 spies that went over and the
[47:35] 10 that said we can't do it and and
[47:37] brought an evil report to the children
[47:39] of Israel to the church of the living
[47:41] God. But two of them stayed with the
[47:43] word. That was the difference. Caleb and
[47:45] Joshua, they stayed with the word of
[47:46] God. the word from the vindicated
[47:48] prophet in their day. They stayed with
[47:50] that word and they were able to get the
[47:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost. They went
[47:54] over into the promised land along with
[47:56] everyone else that believed the way they
[47:57] did. We can be baptized all day long. He
[48:00] says, "Now, I know that there's perhaps
[48:02] people sitting here who come from the
[48:04] apostolic church, I mean, or the United
[48:07] Pentecostal church, which they teach
[48:09] that. But you see, I do not believe that
[48:12] the water forgives sins. Or if it was,
[48:17] then Jesus died in vain. See, I believe
[48:20] that it's only an ordinance of God. See,
[48:23] to show that you have been forgiven.
[48:27] It's a demonstration that you really
[48:29] believe. Amen. That's why we get
[48:31] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:33] Christ. But to be baptized for
[48:36] regeneration, no, I don't believe that.
[48:40] I don't believe that water forgives
[48:42] sins. Now, we know the Mormon church
[48:44] does exactly that. You can go and be
[48:47] baptized for people who have gone on and
[48:50] died ahead of you for regeneration.
[48:54] And that's not the truth either. But
[48:56] that's the way they believe their
[48:58] prophet brought it. And had their
[49:00] prophet actually brought them back to
[49:02] the word, he would be a true prophet.
[49:04] But that prophet brought another word.
[49:06] And that's where he became a false
[49:08] prophet.
[49:10] He goes on to say, "Neither do I believe
[49:13] that this bread and wine has anything to
[49:16] do with you,
[49:19] only keeping an ordinance that God has
[49:22] ordained for us to do." See, that's
[49:25] right. I believe water baptism is the
[49:28] same thing. I believe it's compelling to
[49:31] us to do it that he had done it for he
[49:36] had done it all for our example and he
[49:39] done this for our example and he washed
[49:43] feet for our example.
[49:47] Now after the same manner also 25th
[49:49] verse after the same manner also he took
[49:51] the cup and when he had sucked saying
[49:53] this cup is the new testament in my
[49:56] blood. This do ye as oft as you drink it
[50:01] in remembrance of me.
[50:04] For as oft
[50:07] remember now, for as oft as you eat this
[50:10] bread and drink this cup, you do shoe
[50:16] forth the Lord's death till he comes.
[50:22] You do. We demonstrate that we show
[50:26] forth the Lord's death. That he came and
[50:29] he died and he rose again for me.
[50:33] It becomes that narcissistic discussion
[50:35] again where it's all about me. It's all
[50:38] about my relationship with the Lord. I
[50:40] believe it, therefore, I do it.
[50:44] That's why I have to say I I I just
[50:46] don't understand it when people say that
[50:48] they do believe, but yet they don't come
[50:50] to communion service. I I I don't know.
[50:54] Alls I can say is I don't know.
[50:56] I don't know. For as oft remember now,
[50:59] for as oft as you eat this bread and
[51:01] drink this cup, you do show the Lord
[51:04] show forth the Lord's death till he
[51:06] comes. How long? Until he comes. See,
[51:10] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[51:13] and drink this cup of the Lord
[51:15] unworthily
[51:17] shall be guilty of the body and the
[51:19] blood of the Lord. Now, I understand
[51:21] there's some people that maybe they're
[51:23] bent out of shape and they just can't
[51:24] deal with the situation. So, they don't
[51:26] come to the church and have part of
[51:29] communion service because they know that
[51:31] they're actually going to be doing it
[51:33] unworthily.
[51:34] But I think there comes a time where we
[51:36] need to actually deal with the
[51:38] circumstance and the situation so that
[51:39] we can do it worthily.
[51:43] We can't just not do it. We have to find
[51:46] a way.
[51:48] And I know that we've got a high priest
[51:50] Amen.
[51:51] He's passed into the heavens.
[51:55] So let us hold fast our profession. Do
[51:57] we believe or not?
[51:59] He goes on to say, let me stop just a
[52:01] minute. The reason he said this, you
[52:04] notice in another verse here, another
[52:06] chapter that he said, I understand when
[52:10] you come together, you're eating, even
[52:12] getting drunk at the Lord's table.
[52:16] They misunderstood it. You see,
[52:19] they just gluttoned in. See, just like
[52:23] people are doing today. Just live any
[52:25] kind of life and take it. See, he said,
[52:28] "You got homes to eat in." See, but this
[52:31] is an ordinance that we should keep.
[52:35] See? And now I've had people say to me,
[52:38] the other end of the spectrum is uh I've
[52:40] had people minister to me that perhaps I
[52:44] should not let children come to the
[52:46] table.
[52:48] And you know, I want to say this, the
[52:51] pastor ought to have uh uh an idea of
[52:55] what's going on with the sheep. I
[52:56] understand that.
[52:59] But really, the pastor of the home is
[53:01] the one who's in charge. If a child has
[53:04] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[53:06] Jesus Christ, and they understand the
[53:08] gravity of that ordinance, then I
[53:11] personally believe they're candidates
[53:13] for the Holy Ghost. And I don't
[53:15] necessarily believe that you have to
[53:17] have the Holy Ghost to follow one of the
[53:20] ordinances of the word of God.
[53:23] Alls we have is an instruction. And if
[53:25] we're willing to follow the instruction,
[53:27] I guarantee you, brothers and sisters,
[53:29] that means that we if we don't have the
[53:32] Holy Ghost, we are well on our way to
[53:34] having the Holy Ghost. Because there's a
[53:35] lot of grown adults out there that claim
[53:37] to have the Holy Ghost, but can't follow
[53:39] all of the ordinances of the word. It's
[53:43] bizarre. It's almost like children when
[53:46] they want to get baptized for a parent
[53:47] to say, "Well, I don't know if they're
[53:49] serious. I'm just going to make them
[53:50] wait." Brother Brandham says, "When you
[53:52] do that, if they never decide to
[53:53] actually get water baptized again in
[53:55] their life, you will be held responsible
[53:58] for that because you prevented it."
[54:00] That's a a direct quote from the
[54:02] prophet. So, when a child wants to get
[54:04] baptized, we ought to make sure that we
[54:06] make a provision for them to get
[54:07] baptized. There's no age limit. There's
[54:11] no restrictions requirements. When we
[54:13] get into that sort of behavior, brothers
[54:15] and sisters, then we're getting into the
[54:16] law, right? Amen. And where are we going
[54:19] to live? Under the law or under grace.
[54:22] Personally, I want to live under grace.
[54:24] I don't want to go backwards. I want to
[54:26] go forwards. But I think it's very
[54:29] important. It's interesting to know that
[54:32] children have the ability to get the
[54:34] Holy Ghost. Children have the ability to
[54:37] partake of the Lord's table. If they
[54:39] have followed the instructions, then
[54:41] they ought to. I personally do believe
[54:44] that they should be baptized before they
[54:46] come and and discern the Lord's body,
[54:48] before they take the wine and the bread.
[54:50] As long as they've done that, I
[54:51] encourage the parents, let the Lord
[54:53] lead. If the child wants to do it, then
[54:56] I say, let them partake of it. But
[54:58] you're the one that has to answer for
[55:00] it. I can't say force your children to
[55:03] do it. Thus sayaith the pastor. It's the
[55:06] other end of the spectrum. The parents
[55:09] are the ones who lead their children.
[55:11] The parents are the ones who will give
[55:13] an account for the souls of their
[55:14] children.
[55:18] But he goes on to say they misunderstood
[55:20] it. You know those priests maybe he was
[55:23] able to see it in that day how the
[55:25] priests I I couldn't believe it. I
[55:26] thought it was kind of a joke. But you
[55:28] know it's it's a real thing. There's
[55:31] churches where the priest will actually
[55:33] give you the wafer, put it on your
[55:35] tongue, and then take the shot for you,
[55:38] and then pass it on. The next person,
[55:40] give you the wafer, and take the shot,
[55:42] and give you a wafer, and by the time
[55:45] they're done, they're drunk at the
[55:46] Lord's table.
[55:48] That's the ministry. Can you believe
[55:50] that? They misunderstood it though,
[55:53] Brother Brandham said. You see, they
[55:54] just gluttoned it in. See, and you know
[55:57] when we read this quote here, brothers
[55:58] and sisters, this just does something
[56:00] for me because this is the culmination
[56:02] of all of the years of ministry from the
[56:06] seventh angel messenger from the prophet
[56:08] for our age. This is a culmination
[56:10] message. The final words that he said
[56:12] recorded on tape, given to the church,
[56:15] they misunderstood it. You see, they
[56:17] just gluttoned it in. See, just like
[56:19] people are doing today. Just live any
[56:21] kind of life and take it. See, he said,
[56:24] "You got homes to eat in." See, but this
[56:26] is an ordinance that we should keep.
[56:30] Now, let a man examine himself, and so
[56:33] let him eat of the bread and drink of
[56:35] the cup. For he that eateth and
[56:37] drinkketh unworthily eateth and
[56:39] drinkketh damnation to himself, not
[56:42] discerning the Lord's body. See,
[56:46] what are you? You're a Christian. You
[56:49] live before everybody as a Christian.
[56:53] And if you take that and don't live as a
[56:57] Christian,
[56:58] you're not discerning the Lord's body.
[57:02] Here's the key, brothers and sisters.
[57:04] This is the culmination of the entire
[57:07] message spoken. I think this is it in a
[57:10] in in a nutshell, the message of the
[57:12] hour. If we behaved ourselves like we're
[57:15] Christians in the church, but then go
[57:18] out and do something else other than
[57:21] behave like we're Christians outside of
[57:23] the church, we're potentially casting a
[57:26] stumbling block in the road of someone
[57:28] that would think, "Finally, I've met
[57:30] someone who actually is a Christian, who
[57:32] is a true genuine Christian in this
[57:34] world." But when they see something like
[57:36] that happen where we behave unseemingly,
[57:39] where we maybe do a dirty deal and maybe
[57:41] we say something, maybe we just act in a
[57:43] certain way, whatever it is we do, we
[57:45] could be casting a stumbling block in
[57:47] front of that person, keeping them from
[57:49] coming to the Lord's table.
[57:52] You're putting a stumbling block in
[57:54] someone else's way. See, as they see you
[57:58] trying to do that and then not living
[58:02] what you're supposed to live.
[58:05] See, you're not discerning the Lord's
[58:07] body.
[58:09] Now, watch watch what what it what the
[58:13] curse of it is.
[58:18] For this cause, many are weak and sickly
[58:21] among you, and many sleep.
[58:25] And he says here, the right translation
[58:27] of that word, brother Perry, is dead.
[58:29] See, many are dead.
[58:33] But yet, come to church
[58:37] and take of communion.
[58:40] Brothers and sisters, I want to say
[58:41] tonight, we need to do this with all
[58:43] sincerity.
[58:45] And I know that I'm probably preaching
[58:46] to the choir because these are the
[58:48] people that came to the communion
[58:50] service. Maybe I should have preached
[58:51] this in the morning service. And maybe
[58:53] next time I will do that because I think
[58:56] it's important. It is important.
[58:59] Sometimes when you see people, they're
[59:00] continually sick, continually sick,
[59:02] continually sick, you got to wonder why.
[59:04] I remember having a conversation with my
[59:06] pastor about that very same topic. Why
[59:10] are they continually sick? What's going
[59:13] on in their life as believers? Maybe
[59:15] sometimes they're actually supposed to
[59:17] bear that cross. Maybe.
[59:20] But we did actually have a Lord that
[59:22] came and took 39 stripes. Not for our
[59:27] salvation.
[59:28] That wasn't for our salvation, brothers
[59:30] and sisters. That was for our healing.
[59:32] And the healing right here and now, not
[59:34] over there, not in the millennium.
[59:36] That's for our healing in this body.
[59:39] But he says here, "For this cause, many
[59:40] are weak and sickly among you, and many
[59:43] sleep." The right translation is that
[59:45] they're dead. For if we would judge
[59:48] ourselves, we should not be judged. And
[59:51] I think that's the beautiful thing when
[59:53] we gather together like this. We gather
[59:55] in all sincerity. And if we don't gather
[59:57] in all sincerity, I want to encourage
[59:59] you right now. Get sincere. Make sure
[1:00:02] there's nothing hanging in your heart.
[1:00:04] You don't have any aught against a
[1:00:06] brother or a sister. There's nothing in
[1:00:08] your life left undone that you could
[1:00:10] fix. Sometimes there's things in our
[1:00:12] lives that we've done that we can't fix.
[1:00:14] God knows our heart. If we could fix
[1:00:17] them, we would. I know. I can I can
[1:00:20] witness that myself.
[1:00:23] But if we would judge ourselves, we
[1:00:26] won't be judged. If we come to this
[1:00:28] communion table with all sincerity in
[1:00:30] our heart, God's not going to judge us.
[1:00:33] If we say, "Look into my heart, Lord.
[1:00:35] Search me and try me." Just like Brother
[1:00:37] Brandham said, "Search my heart and try
[1:00:40] me." at the beginning of the invisible
[1:00:41] union of the bride when he prays for the
[1:00:43] brother that passed away. Search my
[1:00:46] heart and try me. And some people might
[1:00:49] say, well, it's pretty easy for God, the
[1:00:51] prophet of God, to say that. But we know
[1:00:52] that he was a sinner saved by grace just
[1:00:54] like everyone else. He was a man of like
[1:00:56] passions just like everyone else. He
[1:00:59] understood what it meant to be a
[1:01:00] red-blooded male. That's why he put a
[1:01:02] cross hanging from his mirror. He said
[1:01:04] so that when his eyes would get caught
[1:01:06] going across the road, it would stop
[1:01:08] dead at that cross and he would say,
[1:01:10] "Lord, forgive me. Thank you, Lord, for
[1:01:12] what you've done for me, for the
[1:01:14] delivering power that I have through
[1:01:16] your cross."
[1:01:19] But if we would judge ourselves, we
[1:01:20] won't be judged. But when we are judged,
[1:01:22] we are chasened of the Lord that we
[1:01:25] should not be condemned with the world.
[1:01:28] His word chasens us. Why does it chasen
[1:01:32] us? because we're sons. If his word
[1:01:35] doesn't chasen us, then we're bastard
[1:01:37] children. We're not sons and we're not
[1:01:39] daughters. And I think it's so
[1:01:42] incredible when we can allow the word to
[1:01:44] wash us. When we can allow the word to
[1:01:47] chasen us sometimes we need it, but when
[1:01:50] it happens, we're able to just crawl up
[1:01:52] into daddy's lap and hear that he loves
[1:01:55] us. That's why he chasens us because he
[1:01:58] loves us. The father that won't chasen
[1:02:01] their child doesn't love them.
[1:02:04] Wherefore, my brethren, when you come
[1:02:05] together to eat, tarry one for the
[1:02:08] other. See, if any man hunger, let him
[1:02:11] eat at home, that you come not together
[1:02:14] unto condemnation,
[1:02:16] and the rest I will set in order when I
[1:02:19] come.
[1:02:21] Now, Brother Brandham, he says this
[1:02:22] here. Now, in other words, don't just
[1:02:24] come take it. As I said a while ago
[1:02:29] about what the Jews, their sacrifice, it
[1:02:31] was wonderful. It was given by God, but
[1:02:34] it got to a place where they didn't do
[1:02:36] it in sincerity and reverence and in
[1:02:40] order. Then it become just it become a
[1:02:45] stench in his nose.
[1:02:49] If we're not sincere coming to this
[1:02:50] table tonight, it's a stench in his
[1:02:54] nose.
[1:02:56] And I can't help but think if we are not
[1:02:58] sincere in our hearts, sincere enough to
[1:03:01] come to the table, to claim Christianity
[1:03:05] and not come to the table, it's a stench
[1:03:09] in his nose.
[1:03:11] We're casting a stumbling block into
[1:03:13] this world here. He goes on to say, "Now
[1:03:16] the same thing is by our coming to take
[1:03:19] the Lord's supper." That we must come
[1:03:22] knowing what we are doing. Just like
[1:03:26] when you go into the water to be
[1:03:28] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:03:32] you know what you're doing. You're
[1:03:35] putting on to the church what God has
[1:03:39] put in you.
[1:03:41] Not the message, not the messenger, but
[1:03:45] Christ.
[1:03:48] When we take this,
[1:03:50] it shows to the church that I believe
[1:03:54] every word of God. So beautiful. When we
[1:03:59] take this communion, it shows to every
[1:04:02] Christian that I believe every word of
[1:04:05] God. I believe that he is the bread of
[1:04:08] life that come from God out of heaven. I
[1:04:12] believe every word that he says is the
[1:04:15] truth and I live by it to the best of my
[1:04:18] knowledge.
[1:04:20] I love how he says to the best of my
[1:04:22] knowledge. He doesn't say to the best of
[1:04:24] my ability, right? Let's make sure we
[1:04:27] underscore that because there ain't
[1:04:29] nobody that's got enough ability to live
[1:04:31] it.
[1:04:32] And that's one of the biggest stumbling
[1:04:33] blocks for the children to think that
[1:04:35] all the adults are doing it by their
[1:04:37] ability. It's not our ability. It's his
[1:04:40] ability living out through us through
[1:04:43] our surrender by following his word.
[1:04:46] And if I
[1:04:48] and and I live it to the best of my
[1:04:50] knowledge, God being my judge.
[1:04:52] Therefore, before my brothers, before my
[1:04:55] sisters, I do not swear. I do not curse.
[1:04:58] I do not do these things because I love
[1:05:01] the Lord and the Lord knows it and bears
[1:05:04] me record.
[1:05:06] Therefore, before you, I take the parcel
[1:05:09] of his body to know that I am not
[1:05:14] condemned with the world. See, there you
[1:05:17] are. Then it's a blessing
[1:05:21] for those people that take it
[1:05:23] unworthily. And for those people that
[1:05:25] don't take it, it's a curse.
[1:05:28] But for those people that take it
[1:05:30] worthily according to his word with all
[1:05:33] sincerity, it is truly a blessing.
[1:05:37] And you know it. You know it, brothers
[1:05:39] and sisters. When this service is over,
[1:05:41] when we go home, there's something
[1:05:43] different every single time. It just
[1:05:45] feels so good. We feel like we could fly
[1:05:48] home. Everybody wants to fellowship. We
[1:05:51] want to spend more time. It's like we
[1:05:54] just want to sing more songs. It's
[1:05:56] amazing. Some people I know they just
[1:05:57] want to go home and they don't want it
[1:05:59] to be too long and
[1:06:02] I think it's just wonderful we can get
[1:06:03] together like this though. Brother
[1:06:05] Brandham goes on to say and remember I
[1:06:07] could give many testimonies on this
[1:06:09] where I've took that and explained it in
[1:06:12] a sick room and seen them healed.
[1:06:14] Remember when Israel taken the type of
[1:06:18] this, they journeyied 40 years in the
[1:06:20] wilderness and their clothes never even
[1:06:23] wore out and they come out without one
[1:06:27] feeble one among them with two million
[1:06:30] people as a type of this? Well, what
[1:06:33] will the antitype do? If the body of a
[1:06:37] sacrificial animal did that for them,
[1:06:40] what
[1:06:44] what would the body of Jesus Christ
[1:06:48] Emmanuel do for us?
[1:06:51] Two million people wandering in the
[1:06:54] wilderness for 40 years. No sickness,
[1:06:57] clothes not wearing out, every single
[1:07:00] need supplied
[1:07:03] at the sacrifice of an animal.
[1:07:09] Brother Brandham, he says,
[1:07:12] "What would the body of Jesus Christ
[1:07:14] Emmanuel do for us?"
[1:07:17] Let's just be reverent when we come.
[1:07:20] Let's just be as reverent as we know how
[1:07:23] to come.
[1:07:24] And I want to say that tonight, brothers
[1:07:26] and sisters, let's just be reverent,
[1:07:29] just as reverent as we know how to when
[1:07:32] we come to this table tonight.
[1:07:35] I think it's just amazing to look at
[1:07:37] this here. If you'll stand with me
[1:07:39] tonight as we change the order of the
[1:07:41] service.
[1:07:43] If you'll turn with me in your Bibles to
[1:07:46] 1 Corinthians.
[1:07:52] 1 Corinthians 11.
[1:07:55] Exactly the scripture that brother
[1:07:56] Brandham was reading in his very last
[1:08:00] message before he got promoted to glory.
[1:08:05] Verse
[1:08:08] 23 of 1 Corinthians chapter 11
[1:08:13] says, "For I have received of the Lord
[1:08:18] that which also I delivered unto you,
[1:08:20] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:08:23] which he was betrayed, took bread, and
[1:08:26] when he had given thanks, he broke it
[1:08:29] and said, "Take, eat.
[1:08:33] This is my body which is broken for you.
[1:08:36] This do in remembrance of me.
[1:08:41] After the same manner also he took the
[1:08:43] cup when he had sucked, saying, "This
[1:08:47] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[1:08:50] This do ye as oft as you drink it in
[1:08:53] remembrance of me.
[1:08:56] For as often as ye eat this bread and
[1:08:58] drink this cup, ye do shu the Lord's
[1:09:02] death till he come.
[1:09:04] Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this
[1:09:06] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:09:08] unworthily
[1:09:10] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:09:13] the Lord.
[1:09:15] But let a man examine himself.
[1:09:17] Let us examine ourselves tonight,
[1:09:19] brothers and sisters.
[1:09:22] Let a man examine himself. And so let
[1:09:25] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:09:28] cup.
[1:09:30] For he that eateth and drinkketh
[1:09:32] unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:09:35] damnation to himself,
[1:09:39] not discerning the Lord's body.
[1:09:42] And for this cause
[1:09:44] many
[1:09:46] are weak and sickly among you, and many
[1:09:51] sleep.
[1:09:52] For if we would judge ourselves, we
[1:09:55] should not be judged.
[1:09:58] But when we are judged, we are chasened
[1:10:00] of the Lord, that we should not be
[1:10:03] condemned with the world.
[1:10:07] Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come
[1:10:09] together to eat, tarry one for another,
[1:10:13] and if any man hunger, let him eat at
[1:10:16] home, that ye come not together unto
[1:10:19] condemnation,
[1:10:21] and the rest will I set in order when I
[1:10:25] come.
[1:10:27] Let's just take a minute or so and just
[1:10:30] tar one for another. This is the
[1:10:31] opportunity to search our hearts and try
[1:10:35] ourselves before the Lord before we come
[1:10:37] to this table.
[1:11:03] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[1:11:07] tonight we come before your throne,
[1:11:10] Lord, with all sincerity.
[1:11:13] Lord Jesus, your throne.
[1:11:16] We come be before it, Lord, with
[1:11:18] boldness.
[1:11:20] your throne of mercy and grace, Lord
[1:11:22] Jesus, in our time of trouble, in our
[1:11:26] time of need.
[1:11:28] We come to you tonight, Father, with all
[1:11:30] sincerity. And we ask, Father, that you
[1:11:32] would search our hearts and try us,
[1:11:34] Father, that there would be nothing that
[1:11:37] would cause us, Lord Jesus, to eat or
[1:11:40] drink damnation unto ourselves.
[1:11:43] We pray that Lord you would help us to
[1:11:45] recognize the the gravity of this
[1:11:48] ordinance that you have given us. Lord
[1:11:51] that we identify with your death,
[1:11:53] burial, and resurrection every single
[1:11:55] time that we partake of this. We
[1:11:58] understand that it is an ordinance of
[1:12:00] you that it's an instruction from you,
[1:12:02] Lord Jesus. until you come,
[1:12:06] until you take us away. Father, until we
[1:12:09] see a body change, we will partake of
[1:12:11] this table. Father, tonight I pray that
[1:12:14] it would just be a blessing unto each
[1:12:16] one that comes and partakes of it.
[1:12:18] Father, be with those who couldn't be
[1:12:20] here tonight. Father, let it become a
[1:12:22] revelation to them. Father, be with
[1:12:24] those who are traveling wherever they
[1:12:26] are. Father, we just want to ask that
[1:12:29] you would bless them abundantly.
[1:12:31] Now, as we turn to this communion table,
[1:12:33] Father, we pray that you would be
[1:12:35] glorified in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:12:37] pray. Amen.
[1:12:40] I'll just invite the pianist and the
[1:12:45] brothers to come forward and we'll
[1:12:49] partake of the
[1:12:51] communion.
[1:13:14] Thank you Lord.
[1:13:17] Blessed be your name.
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:31] Let's pray together.
[1:13:33] Our precious heavenly father, once again
[1:13:36] this evening, father, we want to take
[1:13:38] this opportunity to thank you for the
[1:13:40] words that even came before we come over
[1:13:44] here to partake this communion service.
[1:13:48] Father, as brother Barry just mentioned,
[1:13:52] sometimes
[1:13:54] we take things for granted and this
[1:13:56] evening, Father, it is my prayer for
[1:14:00] those that are not here this evening.
[1:14:03] Yes, Lord. to recognize this
[1:14:07] as an ordinance that is not light
[1:14:11] that they will have that revelation that
[1:14:14] any time the doors are open to have a
[1:14:16] communion service they can come together
[1:14:19] to partake this Lord. Yes Lord and for
[1:14:22] those that are here for their obedience
[1:14:24] Lord may you bless them. Yes, Lord. As
[1:14:27] they come over to partake this, Lord,
[1:14:30] may you bless each and everyone that is
[1:14:33] coming here. Amen. To take this bread.
[1:14:36] Father, as we just read this evening, it
[1:14:39] is not your literal body. But we know
[1:14:43] this is the bread that came down from
[1:14:44] heaven. Yes, Lord. That your children
[1:14:46] are going to take. Bless us all
[1:14:49] together, Lord. So that when we leave
[1:14:51] here, as we read again, we will be a
[1:14:53] happy people. Yes, Lord. knowing going
[1:14:56] home and feeling sad but be happy
[1:14:59] people. Amen. That we don't go and fall
[1:15:02] sick because your word just said evening
[1:15:05] that when we take this
[1:15:08] that is what we get from father now I
[1:15:11] pray over this bread as we are breaking
[1:15:14] it. May you bless it father for each and
[1:15:17] everyone that is coming to partake it
[1:15:19] for in Jesus name that we pray over this
[1:15:22] bread. Amen.
[1:15:24] Amen.
[1:15:29] Oh dear Lord and King,
[1:15:32] you deserve all the glory. You deserve
[1:15:35] all the honor. You deserve our praise
[1:15:37] and thanksgiving. And that is why we
[1:15:40] gather here. You have told us by your
[1:15:42] word
[1:15:45] that if we love you, we should obey your
[1:15:47] commandments. Yes, Lord. Every single
[1:15:50] soul gathered here is in obedience to
[1:15:52] your word. Yes Lord. Thank you Lord. Let
[1:15:54] that blessing be our portion Lord. Yes
[1:15:57] Lord. Father we come in humility in the
[1:15:59] simplicity of the word. We don't have to
[1:16:02] know all the ins and outs. Amen. I just
[1:16:04] believe with our heart that you have
[1:16:06] said it and we are obeying it. Yes Lord.
[1:16:08] Father even as we share this cup of wine
[1:16:12] together Lord. We pray that your
[1:16:14] blessing will be on us. Oh Lord. Yes
[1:16:16] Lord. That Father our health will be
[1:16:19] restored. Father that relationships will
[1:16:21] be restored. precious sake. Amen. That
[1:16:24] revelation will be will abound for every
[1:16:27] soul here. Father, we will leave here
[1:16:29] happy knowing that you have been with
[1:16:31] us. Amen. Because we have obeyed you.
[1:16:34] Father, let us understand all of these
[1:16:36] are part of our inalable rights, Father.
[1:16:39] Yes, Lord. Let your blessings be on your
[1:16:41] children, Father. We love and appreciate
[1:16:43] you, Father. Even as we bear, Father,
[1:16:45] vindicate your word in Jesus Christ's
[1:16:48] name. Amen.
[1:16:50] Amen.
