[0:11] Are
[0:29] Your [singing] love
[0:32] came
[0:34] first before I knew the cross you carry.
[0:43] And [singing and music] now I'm free
[0:46] at
[0:48] last. I'll freely give as I've been
[0:52] given.
[0:58] for everything
[1:00] you've [singing] done
[1:04] and everything
[1:07] [music]
[1:08] to
[1:09] come.
[1:11] I [music and singing] will praise you.
[1:18] to glorify [music and singing] your name
[1:24] forever after [music and singing] your
[1:31] Lord I will sing your
[1:33] [music and singing]
[1:33] praise.
[1:39] Should words
[1:42] [singing] fall [music]
[1:44] short, may they fall in this worship
[1:48] [music]
[1:53] until [singing and music]
[1:54] all
[1:56] that I am breaks in reverence at your
[2:01] feet.
[2:06] for everything
[2:09] you've
[2:11] done
[2:13] and everything
[2:16] [music and singing] to
[2:18] God.
[2:19] I will praise [music] you.
[2:26] to glorify [music]
[2:27] your name
[2:32] forever and [music and singing] your
[2:38] Lord. [music] I will sing [singing] your
[2:40] praise.
[2:43] [music]
[2:44] [singing]
[2:46] I will praise you
[2:52] in the promise [music and singing] and
[2:54] the pain
[2:58] forever as long as life remains.
[3:02] [music]
[3:04] Still I will sing [singing] your praise.
[3:07] [music]
[3:12] You're [music and singing] the first and
[3:15] last, the Alpha and Omega, [music]
[3:19] God, the great I [singing] am, who
[3:23] [music] was and is and is to come.
[3:27] Almighty [singing]
[3:28] one, blessed [music] Savior, Holy
[3:32] Spirit, God Emmanuel
[3:35] is with us here and now and forever. Are
[3:40] you [music] in [singing] love? You wait
[3:44] in peace. You set me free. You
[3:47] [music and singing]
[3:48] cross. You go through death to the king.
[3:53] So kingom [singing]
[3:55] come. All the earth will [music] shout
[3:58] with heaven. For you always [singing]
[4:02] glory. And you always [music] will
[4:05] forever. I will praise you [music]
[4:11] and glorify [singing]
[4:13] your name
[4:18] forever and your [music]
[4:20] [singing] name
[4:23] Lord. I will sing [singing and music]
[4:25] your praise.
[4:29] Oh,
[4:31] and I will praise you [music]
[4:37] in the promise [singing] and the pain.
[4:44] For as long [singing and music] as life
[4:46] remains.
[4:49] Still [singing] I will sing [music] your
[4:52] praise.
[4:56] Still [singing] I will sing [music] your
[4:59] praise.
[5:05] [applause]
