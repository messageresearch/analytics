[55:34] tonight Revelations chapter
[55:37] 3 Revelations chapter 3 verse one
[55:41] continuing our study in the exposition
[55:43] of the seven Church ages in my count it
[55:47] looks like it's number
[55:49] 47 we're in the sardan church
[55:52] age Revelations
[55:55] 3:1 and unto the angel of the church in
[55:58] Sardis write these things saith he that
[56:01] hath the seven spirits of God and the
[56:03] Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou
[56:07] Hast a name that thou livest and art
[56:10] dead Be watchful and strengthen the
[56:13] things which remain that are ready to
[56:16] die for I have not found thy works
[56:19] perfect before God remember therefore
[56:22] how thou Hast received and heard and
[56:25] hold fast fast and repent if therefore
[56:28] Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee
[56:32] as a thief and thou shalt not know what
[56:35] hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a
[56:39] few names even in Sardis which have not
[56:42] defiled their garments and they shall
[56:44] walk with me in white for they are
[56:48] worthy he that overcometh the same shall
[56:51] be clothed in white rment and I will not
[56:55] blot out his name out of the book of
[56:57] life but I will confess his name before
[57:00] my father and before his
[57:03] angels he that hath an ear let him hear
[57:05] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[57:09] let's just bow one more time Heavenly
[57:11] Father we thank you for that ear to hear
[57:14] what the spirit saith Lord and father we
[57:17] thank you that there's a promise that
[57:18] Lord there's some whose names you will
[57:21] not blot out of the book of life but
[57:24] father we don't look at ourselves in
[57:27] that position father we're so thankful
[57:29] that we look at ourselves in the book of
[57:30] the the lamb that was slain before the
[57:33] foundation of the world Lord your choice
[57:36] Lord Jesus and we know there's there's a
[57:38] place father in that book where the

[57:49] us a prophet we thank you Lord Jesus for
[57:51] your word Lord and how wonderful it is
[57:55] to worship you you in spirit and in
[57:57] truth tonight we just invite you Lord to

[58:01] forwards in all that's said and done in
[58:04] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[58:07] bless you tonight you may be
[58:12] seated just a couple of announcements we
[58:15] have the Youth Event uh which is
[58:17] actually the financial session this
[58:19] Sunday after service uh 2 p.m in the
[58:22] basement um we have brother mvin taking
[58:25] the service service on Sunday as well as
[58:28] well as the
[58:29] 24th we have brother gift marufu here on
[58:33] December the eth he is formerly of
[58:36] Saskatoon Tabernacle now living in
[58:39] Zambia with his family and uh I wanted
[58:42] to bring a big hello from Brother Cadre
[58:44] Diggs I spoke to him today and uh he
[58:47] says God bless you all and we're looking
[58:49] forward to him coming potentially in
[58:52] February so we'll see what happens there
[58:55] seems brother hyre he likes the the cool
[58:58] weather
[58:59] here he likes to wear a beanie they call
[59:02] it down south and we know what is a
[59:06] toque it's uh wonderful to have friends
[59:11] in this gospel are you happy tonight
[59:15] tonight I want to pick up where we left
[59:17] off in the sardan church age and it's
[59:19] right in the middle of uh the discussion
[59:21] about election and I don't think I did
[59:24] it justice on Sunday I think I maybe
[59:26] only just barely scratched the surface
[59:29] of it and we'll probably spend a little
[59:31] bit of time talking about election in
[59:32] the future here but tonight I just
[59:34] wanted to maybe make a little bit of a
[59:37] correction to what I said last Wednesday
[59:40] um and even on Sunday I might have said
[59:42] it as well I can't remember but I I said
[59:44] I compared it to getting into the weeds
[59:47] talking about getting into the the
[59:48] discussion of election and uh it
[59:51] certainly isn't a weedy topic and I got
[59:54] I just got thinking about it that's what
[59:55] pre teachers do sometimes start
[59:57] overthinking stuff you know the wheat
[59:58] and the weeds and you
[1:00:00] know it's in a position the story of
[1:00:04] election the idea of election is not an
[1:00:05] easy one it's not a simple discussion is
[1:00:09] what I mean it's it's not easy to walk
[1:00:11] through it's long grass it's reads maybe
[1:00:15] a bit swampy it's a little bit difficult
[1:00:17] to walk through and sometimes the idea
[1:00:19] of election can be a very difficult
[1:00:21] thing to understand and personally I
[1:00:25] believe it's exactly that way for
[1:00:28] purpose it's exactly that way for the
[1:00:30] purpose of Faith because if we could
[1:00:33] understand everything then we wouldn't
[1:00:34] need faith and we need to have faith
[1:00:37] without faith it's what imposs it's
[1:00:40] impossible to please God so we have to
[1:00:43] live by faith and we know the word says
[1:00:46] the just will live by faith we have to
[1:00:49] have faith and I believe the the the
[1:00:51] whole entire discussion about election
[1:00:55] is by faith we have to know that we have
[1:00:57] to look at it from that perspective and
[1:01:00] and it's not an understanding but we try
[1:01:03] to understand it the best that we can we
[1:01:05] try to explain it the best we can and
[1:01:07] you know with call it the tools that
[1:01:09] we've been given and I think the best
[1:01:11] tool that we've been given is a
[1:01:12] Vindicated profit in the age in which we
[1:01:14] live that is the voice box that God
[1:01:16] chose to actually Express himself to the
[1:01:19] age through and to tie up all the Loose
[1:01:21] Ends and to cap off the the seven Church
[1:01:24] ages to to eliminate all the Mysteries
[1:01:27] and here we are we find ourselves in the
[1:01:29] exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:01:31] again in the sardian church age talking
[1:01:33] about election picking up in uh in this
[1:01:38] where we left off we left off with the
[1:01:40] scripture maybe I'll just read the
[1:01:41] scripture it's out of Luke 10 verse 17-
[1:01:46] 24
[1:01:48] um and the 70 returned again with Joy
[1:01:51] saying Lord even the devils are subject
[1:01:54] to us through thy name and he said unto
[1:01:58] them I beheld Satan as lightning fall
[1:02:02] from Heaven that's pretty fast that's
[1:02:06] like that behold I give unto you power
[1:02:09] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[1:02:11] over and over all the power of the enemy
[1:02:14] and nothing shall by any means hurt you
[1:02:19] notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that
[1:02:23] the spirits are subject unto you but
[1:02:25] rather rejoice because your names are
[1:02:28] written in
[1:02:29] heaven in that hour Jesus rejoiced in
[1:02:32] spirit and said I thank thee oh Father
[1:02:35] Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast
[1:02:38] hid these things from the wise and
[1:02:41] prudent and Hast revealed them unto
[1:02:44] babes even so father for it seemed good
[1:02:48] in thy sight all things are delivered to
[1:02:51] me of my father and no man knoweth who
[1:02:54] the son is but the father father and who
[1:02:57] the father is but the son and he to whom
[1:03:00] the son will reveal him and he turned
[1:03:03] unto his disciples and said privately
[1:03:06] blessed are the eyes which see the
[1:03:08] things that you see for I tell you that
[1:03:12] many prophets and Kings have desired to
[1:03:14] see those things which you see and have
[1:03:17] not seen them and to hear those things
[1:03:19] which ye hear and have not heard them I
[1:03:23] can't help but imagine
[1:03:26] that Jesus would probably say the exact
[1:03:30] same thing to the people who believe
[1:03:32] this message of the
[1:03:33] hour don't Rejoice because you're able
[1:03:36] to see Devil's move don't Rejoice
[1:03:38] because of the many signs and wonders
[1:03:40] don't Rejoice because of the first and
[1:03:41] the second pole but Rejoice because of
[1:03:44] the spoken word third pole Rejoice
[1:03:47] because you understand that when you
[1:03:49] speak why it's the same as deity
[1:03:52] speaking amen that's what the prophet
[1:03:54] said and and further to that that's what
[1:03:57] God Said through the prophet amen we
[1:03:59] know this isn't just a prophet speaking
[1:04:01] many people would like to say well that
[1:04:02] was just a prophet that was just the
[1:04:04] prophet well what part of it is the
[1:04:05] prophet and you know we've had this
[1:04:07] discussion I'm not going to go too far
[1:04:08] into that but I just think it's
[1:04:10] beautiful here we have Jesus telling his
[1:04:14] disciples I tell you that many prophets
[1:04:16] and Kings have desired to see those
[1:04:18] things which you see and have not seen
[1:04:19] them and to hear those things which ye
[1:04:21] hear and have not heard them have an ear
[1:04:25] to hear what what the spirit saith unto
[1:04:27] the Church of
[1:04:30] leoda so going
[1:04:32] on he says the Book of Life is
[1:04:35] definitely located in heaven and we know
[1:04:37] last night he actually or last Wednesday
[1:04:39] we read where he asked the question
[1:04:41] where is it located he's answering it
[1:04:43] here The Book of Life is definitely
[1:04:44] located in heaven and will appear at the
[1:04:48] great white Throne
[1:04:50] judgment in these verses Jesus said that
[1:04:54] the names were written in heaven they
[1:04:57] were written in the Book of Life for
[1:05:00] that is where names are placed Jesus was
[1:05:03] speaking to the 70 verse 17 but he was
[1:05:06] also speaking to the 12 verse 23 these
[1:05:11] had all been rejoicing that Devils were
[1:05:15] subject to them in jesus' name isn't it
[1:05:18] interesting it just makes me think about
[1:05:19] it Jesus thinned out the herd when he
[1:05:22] said I and my father are one and unless
[1:05:25] you eat and drink Eat My Flesh and drink
[1:05:28] my blood you have no life in you the 70s
[1:05:32] said whoa now you're going crazy now we
[1:05:34] can't follow you this was just before
[1:05:37] this Christ's rejoiner was Rejoice not
[1:05:40] that the spirits are subject to you but
[1:05:42] rather that your names are written in
[1:05:43] the heaven book of life you will note
[1:05:47] here that Judas was one of
[1:05:50] those who were casting out devils in
[1:05:53] jesus' name
[1:05:56] but we know that he was a devil the son
[1:05:58] of predition John 670 and 71 Jesus
[1:06:03] answered them have not I chosen you 12
[1:06:06] and one of you is a
[1:06:09] devil he spake of judas's scariot the
[1:06:11] son of Simon for it was for he it was
[1:06:15] that should betray him being one of the
[1:06:18] twel it's just really as I've been
[1:06:21] studying this it really got me thinking
[1:06:23] what would it be like to be one of those
[1:06:24] 12 be in that position to think my the
[1:06:29] master has said that one of us is a
[1:06:33] devil that that would be humbling that
[1:06:36] that would really cause me to stir I I
[1:06:39] would think Lord have
[1:06:41] mercy
[1:06:43] my John 17:12 while he was with them in
[1:06:47] the world I kept them in thy name those
[1:06:51] that thou gavest me I have kept and none
[1:06:55] of them is lost but the son of predition
[1:06:59] that the scripture might be
[1:07:04] fulfilled John 13101 and 18 10 to 11 and
[1:07:09] 18 Jesus saith unto him he that is
[1:07:11] washed needeth not safe to wash his feet
[1:07:14] but is clean every wit and ye are clean
[1:07:18] but not all for he knew who should
[1:07:21] betray him therefore said he ye are not
[1:07:25] not all
[1:07:26] clean I speak not of you all I know whom
[1:07:31] I have chosen but that the scripture
[1:07:34] might be fulfilled he that eateth bread
[1:07:36] with me hath lifted up his heel against
[1:07:42] me I got thinking about this did Judas
[1:07:47] know while Jesus was saying these words
[1:07:50] did he know in his
[1:07:52] heart I I took a little look at it and
[1:07:55] uh maybe we'll get into a little bit
[1:07:56] later I just wanted to pose that
[1:07:58] question throw it out there just to
[1:08:00] think about brother Bram in paragraph
[1:08:02] 111 here in my book he says now if
[1:08:04] language means anything at all we must
[1:08:06] admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus
[1:08:09] John
[1:08:10] 1318 yet he was not clean John 13:10
[1:08:14] to11 Judas was also given to Jesus by
[1:08:19] the Father John
[1:08:22] 17:12 Let It Be noted here that the
[1:08:25] choose
[1:08:26] and giving is the exact parallel as in
[1:08:30] the illustration of
[1:08:32] Moses and
[1:08:34] Pharaoh Jacob and Esau for though Esau
[1:08:39] and Pharaoh were both
[1:08:42] forn they were predestinated to wrath
[1:08:47] isn't it interesting how the devil just
[1:08:49] loves to eliminate election and
[1:08:52] predestination get those two words out
[1:08:54] of the Bible and everyone can come right
[1:08:57] everyone's going to be saved anybody
[1:08:59] that can say jesus' name will just it'll
[1:09:01] be just fine right he's a do old grandpa
[1:09:05] that's what they make him while the end
[1:09:07] of Moses and Jacob was glorification
[1:09:11] first Peter 2 8-9 a shows both
[1:09:16] reprobates and elect even to them which
[1:09:20] stumble at the word being
[1:09:23] disobedient where unto also they were
[1:09:28] appointed but ye are a chosen
[1:09:32] generation Judas was numbered with the
[1:09:35] 12 and actually had a part with them in
[1:09:39] the ministry previous to
[1:09:42] Pentecost but we know brother bradam
[1:09:44] said it when it came time for The
[1:09:46] Showdown when it came time for the word
[1:09:48] when it came time to be baptized with
[1:09:50] the Holy Spirit which we preach about
[1:09:54] thoroughly he couldn't go all the way
[1:09:57] Judas could not go on to receiving the
[1:09:59] true baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[1:10:00] that's why he wasn't
[1:10:02] there but I want to say this as we go
[1:10:05] brother Bram says it a little bit later
[1:10:07] on but I just want to try and encourage
[1:10:09] us if anybody has any doubt or any fear
[1:10:12] in their life to say well brother Barry
[1:10:14] he just said that you know maybe even
[1:10:16] Judas didn't even know whether he was a
[1:10:18] son of predition or not we know the
[1:10:20] Scripture it says it uh maybe we'll get
[1:10:22] into it I'm saying it now I guess but
[1:10:25] Jesus asked a question and all the
[1:10:26] disciples it says all of them asked
[1:10:29] amongst themselves Lord is it I so that
[1:10:33] would caused me to believe that perhaps
[1:10:35] even Judas didn't even know it but he
[1:10:38] was he was definitely uh the son of
[1:10:41] predition because he fulfilled that
[1:10:42] scripture but that's neither here or
[1:10:44] there whether he knew it or not but what
[1:10:45] I want to say tonight the devil is going
[1:10:47] to say to us well if you don't know
[1:10:50] maybe there's question in your life
[1:10:51] maybe you don't know maybe you don't
[1:10:52] know there is a solid evidence tonight I
[1:10:55] want to say there's no doubting your
[1:10:57] position in Christ Jesus the devil's
[1:11:00] going to come around and say well you
[1:11:01] did this so no or or you did that so no
[1:11:04] or maybe the other so there's no way and
[1:11:07] and just try and put a little bit of
[1:11:08] seed of doubt in your mind but just just
[1:11:11] remember there is a very clear evidence
[1:11:13] a very clear evidence and we're going to
[1:11:15] get to it Judas could not go on to
[1:11:18] receiving the Holy Ghost if you've gone
[1:11:21] on to receiving the Holy Ghost you're
[1:11:23] sealed to the day of your Redemption if
[1:11:24] you have the desire in your heart to go
[1:11:26] on to receiving of the Holy Ghost you're
[1:11:29] sealed to the day of your Redemption
[1:11:31] because the Lord will give it to you all
[1:11:33] you have to do is meet his requirements
[1:11:35] not everyone can desire to get the Holy
[1:11:38] Ghost in their life brothers and sisters
[1:11:40] but the devil's going to come in and say
[1:11:41] well you know maybe you don't have it
[1:11:43] maybe you do have it you know all of
[1:11:44] that that that selft talk that confusion
[1:11:48] but if you have the desire just keep
[1:11:50] going just keep marching don't get weary
[1:11:53] and well-doing keep going to church keep
[1:11:55] coming com to Sunday school keep
[1:11:56] worshiping God keep reading your Bible
[1:11:58] keep praying keep listening to the
[1:12:00] message God is faithful and just he will
[1:12:03] give you the Holy Ghost if you have the
[1:12:05] desire for the Holy
[1:12:07] Ghost and you'll know it acts 1:16 to 17
[1:12:12] men and Brethren this scripture must
[1:12:14] needs have been fulfilled which the Holy
[1:12:16] Ghost by the mouth of David spake before
[1:12:20] concerning Judas which was guide to them
[1:12:24] that took Jes Jesus I just love this
[1:12:26] scripture how can people say that the
[1:12:28] Holy Ghost and and
[1:12:30] god Jehovah are separate how how can
[1:12:33] that ever happen David never had the
[1:12:35] Holy Ghost did he the Holy Ghost wasn't
[1:12:38] yet given but the word says by the Holy
[1:12:41] Ghost he spake these words for he was
[1:12:44] numbered with us and had obtained part
[1:12:47] of this
[1:12:50] ministry brother Bram goes on to say the
[1:12:53] part that Judas obtained amongst the 12
[1:12:55] and then lost was neither inferior to
[1:12:59] the ministries of the other
[1:13:02] 11 nor was it a devilish foreign
[1:13:07] Ministry interjected amongst the
[1:13:10] ministries of the
[1:13:12] others I think I'm just going to let
[1:13:14] that soak we'll read it again I think it
[1:13:16] really is important to focus on this a
[1:13:19] little bit to remember the part that
[1:13:21] Judas obtained amongst the 12 and then
[1:13:24] lost L was neither inferior to the
[1:13:27] ministries of the other 11 nor was it a
[1:13:29] devilish foreign Ministry interjected
[1:13:31] amongst the ministries of the others it
[1:13:33] wasn't some different Minister that just
[1:13:35] popped up and popped in and somehow was
[1:13:38] able to just say Amen to the word with
[1:13:40] them he had all that they had everything
[1:13:44] that they were doing he was
[1:13:46] doing this part's amazing to me acts
[1:13:50] 1:25 that he may take part of this
[1:13:53] ministry and upon ostle ship from which
[1:13:57] Judas by transgression fell that he
[1:14:00] might go to his own place and we know
[1:14:02] this is where they cast lots and we know
[1:14:05] the lot I believe fell on mithas is that
[1:14:09] right going on brother Bram he says in
[1:14:12] paragraph 113 Judas a devil lost a
[1:14:15] god-given holy ghost
[1:14:18] Ministry and killed himself and went to
[1:14:21] his own
[1:14:22] place predition we know that's where he
[1:14:24] went went his name was even in the book
[1:14:28] of
[1:14:28] life but his name was blotted
[1:14:31] out as I speak tonight and as as I think
[1:14:36] about all this I just can't help but
[1:14:37] think that you know everyone's name must
[1:14:41] be
[1:14:41] written everyone must have a name
[1:14:43] written on the book anyone who ever
[1:14:46] existed in the world must have their
[1:14:47] name written on the book Maybe I'm Wrong
[1:14:49] someone might want to discuss it in in a
[1:14:52] kind way I appreciate it if you're kind
[1:14:54] if I am wrong but I'll receive it right
[1:14:58] we're we're all about being able to be
[1:15:00] corrected if it's according to the word
[1:15:03] but I just can't help but think that
[1:15:04] every single human being ever
[1:15:07] expressed Before and After the flood
[1:15:09] anyone ever their names were written God
[1:15:12] knew that person there's not one person
[1:15:14] that was just surprised or accidental or
[1:15:17] just slipped in and slipped out or
[1:15:19] whatever that was missed or forgotten
[1:15:21] the books must be amazing that will be
[1:15:24] just astounding to see that day where
[1:15:25] the books are open and the judgment is
[1:15:27] set my but here we have Judas a devil
[1:15:32] this is why I'm saying this brothers and
[1:15:34] sisters because some people are actually
[1:15:36] they're they're created unto wrath
[1:15:39] that's what the word says but their
[1:15:41] names are in a book and somehow some way
[1:15:45] they choose to actually forfeit that
[1:15:47] position in the book it's amazing to
[1:15:49] think
[1:15:50] about brother bradam says now before we
[1:15:53] pursue this thought on Judas let us go
[1:15:55] back to the Old Testament and see where
[1:15:57] God did the same thing in Genesis
[1:16:00] 3523 to
[1:16:02] 26 the sons of Jacob were 12 in number
[1:16:06] and their names were as follows Reuben
[1:16:10] Simeon Levi Judah isachar and zebulun
[1:16:15] Joseph and Benjamin Dan and naali Gad
[1:16:20] and
[1:16:21] Asher these 12 sons descendants
[1:16:25] become the 12 tribes of Israel with the
[1:16:28] exception that Joseph did not have a
[1:16:32] tribe named after him for in the
[1:16:35] Providence of God there were to be 13
[1:16:39] tribes and Joseph's two sons were given
[1:16:43] the honor of bringing the 12 to
[1:16:47] 13 outside of this who talks like that
[1:16:51] who says these
[1:16:53] things you know know of course that this
[1:16:56] was necessary as Levi was separated unto
[1:16:59] God for the
[1:17:00] priesthood thus when Israel left Egypt
[1:17:03] and God gave them the Tabernacle in the
[1:17:05] wilderness we find the tribe of Levi
[1:17:09] ministering to the 12 tribes named Ruben
[1:17:13] Simeon isachar Judah zebulun Benjamin
[1:17:16] Dan napali Gad Asher Ephraim and
[1:17:22] Manasseh so now it's changed
[1:17:25] Ed the order of the host
[1:17:29] names the order of the host names them
[1:17:33] thus in numbers 10
[1:17:35] 11-28 there is no mention of Joseph or
[1:17:39] Levi but when we look at Revelations 7:
[1:17:44] 4 to8 where it says there were sealed
[1:17:48] 144,000 of all the tribes of the
[1:17:51] children of Israel it names them thus
[1:17:53] Judah Ruben Gad Asher napali man
[1:17:58] Manasseh Simeon Levi isachar zebulun
[1:18:02] Joseph Benjamin we are back to the 12
[1:18:05] tribes with Levi and Joseph named
[1:18:08] amongst them but with Dan and Ephraim
[1:18:14] missing the question now arises why are
[1:18:17] these two tribes
[1:18:20] deleted and I I just can't help but
[1:18:22] think the theologians don't like talking
[1:18:23] about this stuff
[1:18:26] this this is not skim milk the answer
[1:18:30] lies in Deuteronomy 29: 16 to 20 for ye
[1:18:34] know how we have dwelt in the land of
[1:18:37] Egypt and how we came through the
[1:18:40] Nations which ye passed by and ye have
[1:18:43] seen their Abominations and their Idols
[1:18:46] wood and stone silver and gold which
[1:18:49] were among them lest there should be
[1:18:52] among you a man or woman or family or
[1:18:54] child
[1:18:55] whose heart turneth away this day from
[1:18:58] the Lord Our God to go and serve the
[1:19:02] gods of these nations lest there should
[1:19:05] be among you a root that beareth Gall
[1:19:09] and
[1:19:10] wormwood and it came to pass when he
[1:19:13] heareth the words of this curse that he
[1:19:16] blessed himself in his heart saying I
[1:19:19] shall have peace though I walk in the
[1:19:22] imagination of my heart to add
[1:19:25] drunkenness to
[1:19:27] thirst the Lord will not spare him but
[1:19:30] then the anger of the Lord and his
[1:19:32] jealousy shall smoke against that man
[1:19:35] and all the curses that are written in
[1:19:37] this book shall lie upon him and the
[1:19:40] Lord shall blot out his name from under
[1:19:45] Heaven
[1:19:47] wow I say Lord let us not walk in the
[1:19:50] imaginations of our heart
[1:19:54] herein is pronounced the curse against
[1:19:57] idolatry or spiritual
[1:20:01] fornication the tribe that turned to
[1:20:04] idolatry was to have its name blotted
[1:20:08] out and brother bradam he talks about
[1:20:10] this I'm just going to mention it here
[1:20:12] because I think it's worth just dwelling
[1:20:14] on a little bit he talks about having
[1:20:17] the name blotted out from under heaven
[1:20:20] but he also says it says under heaven
[1:20:25] not in heaven and that's a very
[1:20:28] important fact of the word of God to
[1:20:30] recognize we'll get into it a little
[1:20:32] further brother banam talks about it but
[1:20:35] people can have their name blotted out
[1:20:37] from under heaven but not in heaven the
[1:20:40] Providence of God here we have brother
[1:20:43] banam saying the tribe that turned away
[1:20:45] to all idolatry was to have its name
[1:20:47] blotted out remember God deals with
[1:20:50] Israel as a nation and he deals with the
[1:20:53] Gentiles as individuals
[1:20:55] so I could read this tonight and say the
[1:20:58] person that turned to idolatry was to
[1:21:00] have his name blotted out help us Lord
[1:21:05] and the history of the two tribes whose
[1:21:08] names were blotted out because of
[1:21:10] idolatry is found in First Kings 1225
[1:21:14] to30 then jeroboam built in sheim in
[1:21:18] Mount Ephraim and dwelt therein and went
[1:21:21] out from then and built in pinu and
[1:21:24] jeroboam said in his heart now shall the
[1:21:27] kingdom return to the House of
[1:21:29] David so smooth and religious if this
[1:21:33] people go up to do sacrifice in the
[1:21:36] house of the Lord at Jerusalem then
[1:21:38] shall the heart of this people turn
[1:21:40] again unto the Lord even unto rabo the
[1:21:43] king king of Judah and they shall kill
[1:21:46] me and go again to rabam King of Judah
[1:21:50] politics creeping into the church now
[1:21:53] whereupon the king took took counsel
[1:21:55] from where did he take counsel is what I
[1:21:58] want to say where did that King get
[1:21:59] counsel he took
[1:22:01] counsel and made two calves of gold and
[1:22:03] said unto them it is too much for you to
[1:22:06] go up to Jerusalem I'll just make it
[1:22:08] easy for you to worship we'll just all
[1:22:10] do it the way that you know it's simple
[1:22:13] right Behold thy Gods oh Israel which
[1:22:17] brought thee what up out of the land of
[1:22:21] Egypt
[1:22:25] Devils don't
[1:22:27] die Devils don't die I just want to say
[1:22:31] this Exodus 32 are you able to go there
[1:22:34] brother Exodus 32 if you have your
[1:22:36] Bibles you could turn there
[1:22:38] too Exodus
[1:22:41] 32 the story of The
[1:22:45] Exodus I just want to tie it back
[1:22:47] together to say this is we we all know
[1:22:49] it I'm sure but sometimes it's good just
[1:22:51] to dwell on it a little bit in Exodus
[1:22:57] 32:1 and when the people saw that Moses
[1:22:59] delayed to come down out of the mount we
[1:23:01] you know the story I'll just give the
[1:23:03] background the children of Israel were
[1:23:04] out now God told them you'll Worship in
[1:23:06] this mountain he told the people to wait
[1:23:08] here I've got a meeting I got to go to
[1:23:11] the top of the mountain where there's
[1:23:12] thunder and lightning and smoke and fire
[1:23:16] and uh he feared exceedingly but anyways
[1:23:20] the people were down Moses went up he
[1:23:22] spending time with God he was a long
[1:23:23] time he was 40 days people don't like it
[1:23:26] when you got to wait even then I I I was
[1:23:29] looking at it thinking my even then
[1:23:31] people were
[1:23:32] impatient and when the people saw that
[1:23:34] Moses delayed to come down out of the
[1:23:36] mount this is verse one of 32 Exodus the
[1:23:39] people gathered themselves together unto
[1:23:41] Aaron and said unto him up make us Gods
[1:23:45] which shall go before us boy they wanted
[1:23:48] to be religious they didn't want to get
[1:23:51] a guitar and start playing rock and roll
[1:23:54] right they wanted to be religious it's
[1:23:57] amazing and said unto him up make us
[1:23:59] Gods which shall go before us for as
[1:24:02] this Moses the man that brought us up
[1:24:05] out of the land of Egypt we what not
[1:24:07] what has become of him man we're waiting
[1:24:09] too long our time is just too valuable
[1:24:13] we can't wait anymore just get it going
[1:24:16] and a it's amazing this whole thing
[1:24:18] Aaron said unto them break off the
[1:24:20] Golden Earrings which are in your ears
[1:24:23] of your wives and your sons and your
[1:24:24] daughters and bring them up unto me and
[1:24:26] all the people break off the Golden
[1:24:28] Earrings and their ears brought them
[1:24:29] unto Aaron and he received them in their
[1:24:31] hand and fashioned it with a graving
[1:24:34] tool and he after he had made it a
[1:24:37] molten calf and they said these be thy
[1:24:40] Gods o Israel which brought thee up out
[1:24:44] of the land of
[1:24:46] Egypt this is while they were yet being
[1:24:49] brought up out of the land of Egypt here
[1:24:52] they are saying this the exact same
[1:24:55] words that we read tonight Devils don't
[1:24:59] die after he received them at their hand
[1:25:02] and fashion it with uh sorry I read that
[1:25:04] already verse 5 and when Aaron saw it he
[1:25:07] built an altar before it and Aaron made
[1:25:11] Proclamation and said tomorrow is a
[1:25:13] feast to the
[1:25:15] Lord they rose up early on the Tom my
[1:25:19] they must have been tired after all
[1:25:20] their
[1:25:21] work but they were able to rise up early
[1:25:24] on the moral to do their religion right
[1:25:28] and offered burnt offerings and brought
[1:25:31] peace offerings and the people sat down
[1:25:34] to eat and drink and Rose up to
[1:25:37] play and we know the story as it goes on
[1:25:39] I'm not going to go too far into that we
[1:25:41] know the Lord said
[1:25:42] man Moses I'm done with these people
[1:25:45] already they're a stiff neck ridiculous
[1:25:48] people that just won't listen um I'll
[1:25:50] just do away with them I'll wipe them
[1:25:52] off the face of the Earth and I'll start
[1:25:53] a new nation in you and we know just for
[1:25:56] the record brothers and sisters this is
[1:25:59] the the value of a Prophet this Prophet
[1:26:02] is the one that stayed with the Lord
[1:26:04] isn't it interesting that even the most
[1:26:06] religious supporters of this prophetic
[1:26:09] Ministry that led them up out of Egypt
[1:26:12] here they are a few days removed from a
[1:26:15] prophet and they're the most religious
[1:26:16] people worshiping
[1:26:19] calfs Lord help us we cannot stray there
[1:26:22] is no straying from the word of a
[1:26:26] prophet as soon as we do it brothers and
[1:26:28] sisters that's what's going to happen
[1:26:31] and it's going to be oh so
[1:26:33] religious so
[1:26:35] religious but it's just exactly isn't it
[1:26:38] th those calfs there you are behold the
[1:26:41] god that brought you up out of Egypt the
[1:26:43] one that parted the waters goodness
[1:26:47] sakes thank the Lord for a
[1:26:52] prophet my
[1:26:55] I apologize I got so excited
[1:26:59] I don't even know where I left
[1:27:02] off just be honest oh there it is herein
[1:27:05] is pronounced the curse against idolatry
[1:27:08] or spiritual fornication the tribe that
[1:27:11] turned to idolatry was to have its name
[1:27:13] blotted out in the history of the two
[1:27:14] tribes whose names were blotted out
[1:27:17] because of idolatry was found in First
[1:27:19] Kings and we read about
[1:27:22] jeroboam I'll just read I think it's
[1:27:24] verse 28 and they shall kill me and go
[1:27:27] again again to rabo King of Judah the
[1:27:30] politics I'm going to lose out and
[1:27:32] they'll just run after him whereupon the
[1:27:35] king took counsel and made two calves of
[1:27:37] gold and said unto them it's too much
[1:27:39] for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy
[1:27:42] Gods oh Israel which brought thee up out
[1:27:44] of the land of Egypt how God must have
[1:27:47] just hated hearing that and he set the
[1:27:51] one in bethl and the other one put he in
[1:27:55] Dan and this thing became sin for the
[1:27:59] people went to worship before the one
[1:28:02] even unto Dan Ephraim is joined to his
[1:28:06] idols let him alone that's a scripture
[1:28:10] Hosea
[1:28:13] 4:17 note particularly that the
[1:28:15] punishment for
[1:28:17] idolatry was that the name of the tribe
[1:28:19] was to be blotted out from under Heaven
[1:28:22] Deuter Deuteronomy 2 9: 20 it does not
[1:28:26] say that it would be blotted out in
[1:28:29] heaven but from under heaven and that is
[1:28:33] exactly as it is for now Israel is back
[1:28:37] in Palestine and soon the Lord will seal
[1:28:40] 144,000 of them but from that number Dan
[1:28:45] and Ephraim are
[1:28:48] missing Revelation 7: 4 to8 and I heard
[1:28:52] the number of them which were sealed and
[1:28:55] there were
[1:28:56] sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the
[1:29:00] children of Israel and of the tribe of
[1:29:03] Judah were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of
[1:29:07] Reuben were sealed 12,000 of the tribe
[1:29:10] of GAD were sealed 12,000 of the tribe
[1:29:13] of Asher were sealed
[1:29:16] 12,000 of the tribe of nephalem were
[1:29:20] sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Manasses
[1:29:23] were sealed
[1:29:24] 12,000 of the tribe of Simeon were
[1:29:27] sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Levi were
[1:29:30] sealed 12,000 of the tribe of isachar
[1:29:33] were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of
[1:29:37] zabulon were sealed 12,000 of the tribe
[1:29:40] of Joseph were sealed 12,000 of The
[1:29:44] Tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12,000
[1:29:48] note Dan and Ephraim
[1:29:52] missing now with this this see Daniel
[1:29:55] 12:1 which refers to these 144,000 being
[1:30:00] sealed during the six seal and the time
[1:30:04] of the Great Tribulation or Jacob's
[1:30:07] trouble and at that time shall Michael
[1:30:10] stand up the great Prince which standeth
[1:30:13] for the children of thy people and there
[1:30:16] shall be a time of trouble such as never
[1:30:20] was since there was a nation even to
[1:30:24] that same
[1:30:25] time and at that time thy people shall
[1:30:29] be delivered everyone that shall be
[1:30:32] found written in the
[1:30:36] book however after this period of
[1:30:39] tribulation during the Millennium as
[1:30:42] seen by Ezekiel in
[1:30:44] 48: 1 to8 and 22 to 29 we see the tribes
[1:30:51] back once more in divine order
[1:30:54] but from the time that Ephraim and Dan
[1:30:57] joined themselves to Idols they died and
[1:31:01] those tribes have no more
[1:31:05] recognition now I realize that since the
[1:31:08] destruction of Jerusalem all records of
[1:31:11] all tribes have been lost so that no one
[1:31:15] can say for sure what tribe he is from
[1:31:19] but God
[1:31:21] knows that great God who is bringing
[1:31:24] Israel back to Palestine knows exactly
[1:31:27] which tribe every true Israelite is from
[1:31:31] and from all the assembled
[1:31:34] 144,000 Dan and Ephraim will be missing
[1:31:39] here are the tribes of
[1:31:42] Israel now these are the names of the
[1:31:46] tribes from the north and to the coast
[1:31:50] of the way by hethlon as the one goeth
[1:31:54] to HTH has zanan the border of Damascus
[1:31:59] northward to the coast of HTH for these
[1:32:03] are his sides East and West a portion
[1:32:06] for Dan and by the border of Dan from
[1:32:09] the East side unto the West Side a
[1:32:11] portion of

[1:32:15] the East side even unto the West Side a
[1:32:18] portion for
[1:32:19] naftali and by the border of naftali

[1:32:44] border of Reuben from the East side to
[1:32:46] the west side a portion for
[1:32:49] Judah and by the border of Judah from
[1:32:52] the East side unto the West Side shall
[1:32:55] be the offering which ye shall offer of
[1:32:58] five and 20,000 reads in breadth and in
[1:33:02] length as one of the other parts from
[1:33:05] the East side unto the west side and the
[1:33:09] sanctuary shall be in the midst of it we
[1:33:12] know that's Ezekiel 481
[1:33:15] to8 moreover from the possession of the
[1:33:19] Levites and from the possession of the
[1:33:21] city being in the midst of that which is
[1:33:24] the princes between the border of Judah
[1:33:27] and the border of Benjamin shall be for
[1:33:30] the prince sorry this is Ezekiel 48:22
[1:33:34] to 29 that brother Brandon mentioned
[1:33:36] earlier as for the rest of the tribes
[1:33:39] from the East side unto the West Side
[1:33:41] Benjamin shall have a portion and by the
[1:33:44] border of Benjamin from the East side
[1:33:46] unto the West Side Simeon shall have a

[1:34:05] zebulun from the East side unto the West
[1:34:08] Side Gad a portion and by the border of
[1:34:12] GAD at the South Side Southward the
[1:34:16] Border shall be even from Tamar unto the
[1:34:20] Waters of strife in Kadesh and to the
[1:34:23] river toward the great sea this is the
[1:34:26] land which ye shall divide by lot unto
[1:34:30] the tribes of Israel for inheritance and
[1:34:33] these are their portions saith the Lord
[1:34:38] God another
[1:34:40] illustration that we might take is the
[1:34:43] story of Israel leaving Egypt for Canaan
[1:34:48] land I think this
[1:34:50] is pretty much where we'll end off
[1:34:53] tonight
[1:34:54] maybe we'll go a little further we'll
[1:34:56] see another illustration that we might
[1:34:59] take out is the story of Israel leaving
[1:35:00] Egypt for Canaan land God's purpose in
[1:35:03] this age was to bring Israel out and to
[1:35:07] take them in and we know in the
[1:35:10] Christian walk there's two parts to it
[1:35:13] coming out of and going into this is not
[1:35:16] just about the children of Israel we got
[1:35:17] to come out of all of our old systems
[1:35:19] all of our old teachings all of our own
[1:35:22] thoughts and ideas and come into the
[1:35:25] person of Jesus Christ we have got to
[1:35:28] come into the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:30] there's a coming out and a going in to
[1:35:33] the end that they might serve him thus
[1:35:36] when they left Egypt they all came out
[1:35:40] under the blood of the sacrificial
[1:35:43] lamb even cor and
[1:35:46] Dayan why they all went through the
[1:35:50] waters of baptism in the Red Sea they
[1:35:53] all enjoyed the mighty
[1:35:56] Miracles all ate of the Mana all drank
[1:36:01] of The Rock and in so far as obvious
[1:36:05] external blessings and
[1:36:07] manifestations were
[1:36:09] concerned they all partook in like and
[1:36:14] equal manner all the children of Israel
[1:36:18] they were blessed just because they were
[1:36:20] the children of Israel my
[1:36:24] but when they came to Moab those who
[1:36:26] joined in the Feast of Baal peor they
[1:36:30] all
[1:36:31] died their carcasses fell in the
[1:36:34] wilderness and we know that this is
[1:36:35] where they actually were persuaded you
[1:36:38] know what we're all the same we all
[1:36:40] worship the same God let's just get
[1:36:43] together and have a feast and we'll
[1:36:44] worship together and everything will be
[1:36:46] fine right no no God said separate
[1:36:50] yourselves do not mix with the people in
[1:36:52] the land and they went completely
[1:36:55] against the word of God and that's why
[1:36:57] they found themselves in a situation at
[1:36:59] Moab at the Feast of Baal peor their
[1:37:02] carcasses fell in the wilderness for it
[1:37:05] was there that they refused the word of
[1:37:08] God and turned from it and we know it
[1:37:10] was everyone who was I think 20 or 21
[1:37:13] years of age and younger they're the
[1:37:14] ones that went into the promised land
[1:37:16] and all of the elders all of them their
[1:37:19] carcasses fell in the wilderness that's
[1:37:21] what he's talking about here now now
[1:37:23] this is what Hebrews 6 1:9 speaks of
[1:37:28] which was brought out so carefully in
[1:37:31] the pergam and age and I think I needed
[1:37:33] to correct myself too I referred to this
[1:37:35] as uh Romans 6 I think maybe on Sunday I
[1:37:40] uh yeah just thinking too much again but
[1:37:43] um brother Bram he says you can't go
[1:37:45] along with just part of the word you
[1:37:48] have to take all the word and we know
[1:37:50] that Hebrews 6 um we probably won't read
[1:37:53] it tonight maybe we will next time
[1:37:54] Hebrews 6 is you know where the the the
[1:37:58] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[1:38:00] alike the the story that brother bradam
[1:38:03] talks about how he didn't understand
[1:38:04] that scripture and how the Lord showed
[1:38:06] him the vision of the Earth being a a
[1:38:09] dis up Earth and how he saw the man in
[1:38:11] white sowing seeds in the day and at
[1:38:13] night time the the the villain came
[1:38:16] behind the man dressed in black sewing
[1:38:18] seeds also seeds of tears and and he was
[1:38:22] able to catch the revelation of this
[1:38:24] that the the wheat and the weeds they
[1:38:26] all Rejoice on the same rain I believe
[1:38:28] we talked about that last last time
[1:38:30] brother bam talked about the corn the
[1:38:33] the wheat corn and we won't go too far
[1:38:36] into that but you know he says here you
[1:38:38] can't go along with just part of the
[1:38:40] word you have to take all the word and I
[1:38:43] just think that's such a beautiful thing
[1:38:44] because we don't have to try and
[1:38:46] interpret and try and figure out what
[1:38:48] part to take out and and what part to
[1:38:50] put in we can just say be it unto me
[1:38:52] according to the Thy word let let it be
[1:38:55] all of your word and and let me become
[1:38:57] subject to all of it let me change to
[1:39:00] match that word not try and change that
[1:39:02] word to match me brother brandom goes on
[1:39:05] to say there are people who seem
[1:39:08] involved in the things of God Almost
[1:39:13] 100% they are like
[1:39:16] Judas no one but Jesus knew exactly what
[1:39:21] kind of a person Judas was
[1:39:24] not even
[1:39:25] Judas but Jesus knew but I'm going to
[1:39:29] just reiterate tonight and say brothers
[1:39:31] and sisters we don't judge anyone we're
[1:39:34] not interested in judging anyone we want
[1:39:35] to judge ourselves let's take ourselves
[1:39:37] and subject ourselves into the mirror of
[1:39:40] God's word and see when we look into it
[1:39:43] do we see the reflection of Christ or do
[1:39:45] we see our old selves because if we see
[1:39:47] our old selves we just need to say Lord
[1:39:49] help me I don't want to see the old me I
[1:39:51] want to see you when I look into your
[1:39:53] word into the mirror of your
[1:39:56] word so the day came that Judas did
[1:39:59] exactly what Israel did at ba
[1:40:02] peor well he didn't go and worship at
[1:40:04] the feast did he there wasn't a a time
[1:40:07] where he just took another wife and did
[1:40:10] all of that no he's not talking about
[1:40:11] the literal he's talking about the
[1:40:13] spiritual and I know we're all there but
[1:40:16] maybe just for the sake of discussion
[1:40:18] I'm trying to maybe dramatize it a
[1:40:20] little bit he decided that he wanted to
[1:40:23] join with the false Vine forces enter
[1:40:27] into a
[1:40:28] financial political organization of
[1:40:31] anti- word Antichrist religion not just
[1:40:36] Antichrist but Antichrist religion this
[1:40:38] was religious people he was fooled it
[1:40:41] says here the other 11 were not they
[1:40:44] could not be for they were of the very
[1:40:49] elect so when Judas left and betrayed
[1:40:52] the Lord his name was removed from The
[1:40:55] Book of Life Revelations 22:19 this just
[1:40:58] brings to mind the thought that I don't
[1:41:01] know somewhere along the way maybe we'll
[1:41:02] see it in the future here brother Bram I
[1:41:04] can't remember exactly where he says it
[1:41:06] but you know the uh the Jews there's
[1:41:09] elected Jews they're not just uh 144,000
[1:41:15] leftovers there's very elected Jews as
[1:41:18] well they're not bride of course but
[1:41:20] they're elected of God it's a very
[1:41:22] interesting
[1:41:25] study brother Bram goes on to say here
[1:41:27] in paragraph 122 in closing I will call
[1:41:30] the musici musicians and we'll close off
[1:41:32] here with this paragraph because we'll
[1:41:34] pick up here again and this this
[1:41:37] paragraph is one of those paragraphs it
[1:41:39] just is now I'm sure that you have
[1:41:42] noticed that those whose names were in
[1:41:45] The Book of Life were a part of the
[1:41:47] religious order of that day and centered
[1:41:50] around the true worship of God and
[1:41:52] worship of him him though they did not
[1:41:54] worship according to the truth
[1:41:58] word my I just can't help but think of
[1:42:01] the the message brother bradam preached
[1:42:03] you know trying to do God a service
[1:42:04] without it being his will and and in
[1:42:07] that message he said you know what they
[1:42:08] had all of the religious
[1:42:11] motion all of it they could scream and
[1:42:14] shout and play and dance and sing they
[1:42:17] had they could do it all even preach it
[1:42:20] but not be completely on the word is
[1:42:23] false and that's the key it's either
[1:42:25] true or it's
[1:42:28] false like
[1:42:30] Judas they didn't go all the way see how
[1:42:34] Judas was chosen of
[1:42:37] God he was instructed in
[1:42:39] truth he shared no knowledge of the
[1:42:43] Mysteries he had a Ministry of power
[1:42:46] granted unto him and he healed the sick
[1:42:50] and cast out devils in jesus' name
[1:42:54] but when The Showdown came he sold out
[1:42:57] for gold and political power and I want
[1:43:00] to say to us brothers and sisters never
[1:43:02] let us sell out for gold or political
[1:43:05] power popularity or friends you know
[1:43:08] what the word is what is true and all
[1:43:12] else is false and even if we wind up
[1:43:15] being the only one to be able to say be
[1:43:18] it unto me according to Thy word that's
[1:43:20] what God's looking for brother Ram said
[1:43:22] even in a city of a million people if
[1:43:24] there's only going to be one person
[1:43:25] saying Lord let it be me he said Let It
[1:43:28] Be
[1:43:29] You When The Showdown came he sold out
[1:43:33] for gold and political
[1:43:35] power he did not go up to Pentecost to
[1:43:38] receive the spirit of
[1:43:40] God he was devoid of the
[1:43:43] spirit now this is the part of this
[1:43:45] paragraph that I wanted to get to and
[1:43:47] I'm so glad we're able to close off here
[1:43:49] make no mistake about it brothers and
[1:43:51] sisters make no mistake about a person
[1:43:54] that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost
[1:43:56] into the body of Christ receiving the
[1:43:59] fullness of the spirit will be in the
[1:44:02] word all the
[1:44:05] way not part
[1:44:07] way he says that's the evidence of being
[1:44:10] baptized with the Holy
[1:44:12] Ghost Judas failed multitudes fail right
[1:44:15] there and when they fail to go into that
[1:44:18] word their names are taken off the book
[1:44:20] of life you know I know people and I'm
[1:44:23] sure we all do maybe stand with me as we
[1:44:26] close here we we all know people they're
[1:44:29] not half-hearted about things when they
[1:44:32] decide they're going to do something in
[1:44:34] their life they they study it and they
[1:44:37] research it and and maybe they save for
[1:44:39] it and they plan for it and they think
[1:44:41] about it and they talk about it and they
[1:44:43] plan for it and they save for it and
[1:44:45] they study
[1:44:46] it that's the things of this world do we
[1:44:48] do that with the word of God in our
[1:44:50] lives in our homes
[1:44:54] I just can't help but think you know
[1:44:55] when we are all in that's our evidence
[1:44:58] brothers and sisters don't doubt as long
[1:45:01] as your heart is there and you're Allin
[1:45:03] with your heart and you know genuinely
[1:45:05] in your heart we know in our heart
[1:45:07] whether we're honest and all in or
[1:45:09] whether we're not we know it we know it
[1:45:12] we can hide it real good but we know and
[1:45:16] God
[1:45:17] knows I just want to encourage us
[1:45:20] brothers and
[1:45:21] sisters make no mistake about it a
[1:45:23] person that is truly baptized by the
[1:45:25] Holy Ghost into the body of
[1:45:29] Christ receiving the fullness of the
[1:45:31] spirit will be in the word all the way
[1:45:33] amen and that's our evidence of being
[1:45:36] baptized with the Holy Ghost not one of
[1:45:38] the gifts of the Spirit no no our
[1:45:41] ability to be all in that's where we
[1:45:44] need to be let's just bow in prayer
[1:45:47] Heavenly Father tonight Lord we thank
[1:45:49] you for your word thank you for sending
[1:45:52] us a
[1:45:53] Vindicated Prophet Lord a man that you
[1:45:56] could use that would be fully
[1:45:58] surrendered Lord to think that out of
[1:46:01] all of the millions and billions of
[1:46:03] people after or during the life of that
[1:46:06] man no one
[1:46:08] else no one
[1:46:11] else was chosen by you worthy
[1:46:15] enough to pack this
[1:46:17] word but you chose him father a man of
[1:46:20] your own choosing to pack this word and
[1:46:23] Lord we're so thankful that he was
[1:46:25] honest with it and Lord I just can't
[1:46:28] help but think based on all that we've
[1:46:30] said tonight knowing that when your
[1:46:32] prophet he preached the seventh seal he
[1:46:34] prayed at the end and he said Lord if
[1:46:36] I've got to go down to the river and the
[1:46:38] waves start coming in and I have to lay
[1:46:40] down this old
[1:46:41] sword let someone pick it up that will
[1:46:44] be honest with it I can't help but think
[1:46:47] there's answer to that prayer there's
[1:46:50] people who are honest with your word
[1:46:51] that have picked it up and and they're
[1:46:53] willing to subject themselves wholly and
[1:46:55] completely to you and your word father
[1:46:58] tonight I pray that each one of us would
[1:47:01] be those subjects and I pray that we
[1:47:03] could go forwards Lord and look for

[1:47:49] we live father help us to receive the
[1:47:52] revelation of your word to the maximum
[1:47:54] potential that we could be filled with
[1:47:56] your spirit Lord Jesus that we would
[1:47:58] find ourselves exactly where we left off
[1:48:01] in this word tonight Lord oh Father we
[1:48:04] love you and thank you we just want to
[1:48:06] commit each life into your hands now For
[1:48:08] Your Glory as we go our separate ways be
