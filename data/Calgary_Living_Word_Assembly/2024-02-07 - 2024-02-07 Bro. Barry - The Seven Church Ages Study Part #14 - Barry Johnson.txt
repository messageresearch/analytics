streaming and those that might listen afterwards father we love you and we thank you we ask all these things in your precious name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen thank you musicians God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles I would just like to read from Revelations chap 1 certainly glad to have brother Paul and sister Elaine back with us after a time away it's certainly important to have a little bit of time of refreshing we know that even the word of God speaks about the refreshing we have to be able to recharge tonight I'd like to speak uh just to pick up and do a a little quick overview review of uh the Sevenfold Glory of his person in uh I believe it's part 14 of the exposition of the seven Church ages we'll start reading with Revelations chapter 1 verse2 this is John and what he sees when he's in the spirit on the Lord's day and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden C candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and death let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we think about this vision and your majesty as John saw you and father it it takes our breath away when we really think about these images the words that we just heard and father Lord Jesus if any one of us were ever to come that close to you I know that we would fall to our feet as dead fall to the ground Lord but we know that you would have the same words for us to fear not because you are the first and the last you have done it all you have paid it all and father you've done it for us and so tonight we just want to commit the words that are spoken tonight into your hands For Your Glory father help me to get out of the way as we take another step in your word we love you and we thank you we just commit the rest of this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated certainly happy to be back in the house of the Lord in the middle of the week certainly happy to see everyone here tonight know the Lord is good and there's a blessing in store for every single time we gather together in his name just a couple of announcements we have prayer meeting coming up February 15th at 7:30 that will be here at the church um we'll be going away um we'll be going away I think it's the uh I don't know why I'm getting confused now we're going to be going away and on Sunday the 18th brother John perzo is going to take the service here brother John perzo is the son of the song leader uh one of the song leaders up at Ed time message Tabernacle and so he has agreed to take the service here and uh Wednesday the 21st brother Toby will take the service so I trust that will be a real blessing to each one um I'm actually going to be a little bit disappointed that I'm not going to be here to hear Brother John but I'll pick up the uh recording afterwards and uh as I said to him when we talked about this this is not the only time that I want to see him come here uh we have a tremendous uh arsenal of ministry in Edmonton and uh I have a couple more ministers up there lined up that I would like to see come down here and I know it will be a blessing to the body so after that we have a Youth Event happening on the 25th at our house after service and we'll have lunch um and then we have the annual gen General men's meeting at the church which is February 29th that will be at 7:30 p.m. so uh are you happy tonight good to be in the house of the Lord you can see the weather is boy it's starting to change slightly and you can see the days are even starting to get a little bit longer and as the days get longer the cold will drag on and uh it'll be a sure sign of spring around here but uh we're certainly thankful that we'll be coming out of winter here soon um I spoke to brother Dwayne fair today and uh had a great conversation we hadn't talked for some time and so he heard that I was coming to town and has teed me up for the service in uh in SAS J on the 18th and I think it's just a wonderful opportunity to be in service for the king and you know brother Dwayne is uh he's been a real part of this assembly here he's uh directly related to Sister Shelley her brother-in-law he married her sister and he's just been a real encouragement to all of us I'm sure and he said to send a very personal greeting to each one tonight make sure you say hello to the church from from me and uh he'll be in Calgary but he's actually going away and he's going to Guatemala he's going to catch up with brother Tito from the end time message Tabernacle in uh Edmonton and they're going to go to Guatemala together so um there may be an opportunity to meet with him when they come back but we'll see so that's it for the announcements um God richly bless you tonight I just would like to do a little bit of a recap and and talk a little bit about where we left off last week I think it's a real important part of what we are talking about when we get into the exposition of the seven Church ages we haven't really done that yet it's more of an introduction as to who is actually speaking about the church ages and I just love the way brother brandham brings that out in this book he takes the time to express so many different things um you know from who who who this really is standing there to getting in the spirit uh we could do a recap and we probably will before we go too much further just about all the high points but uh tonight I just really want to drill down on the Sevenfold Glory of his person and just before that brother bradam says that he is no longer the priest he's been a priest for a long long time but when he sees them in this Vision here and he begins to describe the one that's standing there in the midst of the candlesticks which is the church and how he has the Seven Stars in his right hand and how they are The Messengers to the church how this one that's standing is no longer the intercessor he's no longer the priest he's the judge isn't it beautiful I believe we talked about it I can't even remember now but just recently how our judge is our attorney our attorney is our judge and the judgment's already passed that you have you're you're not guilty you're completely uh free we are free tonight and uh it's just such a beautiful thing but you know brother bam he says here that he is no longer the priest and this is out of the exposition of the seven Church ages it's Revelations 1:3 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle brother Bram he says there he stands one like unto the son of man Kinfolk one like unto the son of man as the jewel is beautified by the mounting of the ring so he is glorified in the mid of the churches it's at the Lord's day it is the Lord's day for John sees him standing not as a priest but as the coming judge the golden girdle is no longer G around the waist where the priest must wear it as he ministers to God in the holiest place but it is now around his shoulders for he is now for it's around his shoulders for he is not not now the priest but the judge now has John 5:22 come to pass for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son his service has been rendered the priesthood is over the days of the prophecy are finished he stands girded as the judge I just wanted to lay that down as sort of the foundation for tonight's discussion in the discussion about the Sevenfold Glory of his person and you know I I just it got me thinking about it tonight and and I can't help but think how when we talk about this somehow this has to be real somehow this has to intertwine with our lives there has to be something about it that's going to make us actually learn and grow and and not just come to church and read a scripture and say amen and and leave somehow this has to be applicable to us in our lives and I just can't help but think that you know while we look at this we recognize that he stands there like one unto the son of man for a reason that's so he could be a kinsman redeemer if he was in his own Spirit then we wouldn't recognize him maybe we wouldn't understand who this is but John as he saw them him there I'm sure that he could see the face of Jesus Christ only he had some different attributes around him and and the Sevenfold Glory of his person we're going to talk about that tonight but in Revelations 1:5 says and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood he's done it all and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen I heard this said recently and I thought it was so good I just had to get into this a little bit tonight we are Kings and Priests we already are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus our kingship is directly related to directly Tethered to our priesthood and if we are not doing our Priestly duties then we're not in our position our kingship is maybe a little bit te ing maybe it's not as solid as we would like to see it or maybe as we would claim it to be our kingship is linked directly to our priesthood our willingness to do the sacrifice the sacrifice of praise the sacrifice of worship the sacrifice of laying down our lives as husbands for our entire families the sacrifice as wives for our husbands we're all Kings and Priests it's not just the husbands so if a husband is saying I'm the King serve me where's my servants where's my gestures my court gestures you know if that's going on there's something wrong it's not actually the way it's supposed to be because we're all Kings and Priests before the Lord as husbands we bring peace or we bring upset to our families we're the priests we intercede for our family situation or at least we should if we're not then it's time we do I want to encourage us brothers and sisters get in our Priestly offices wear that Priestly hat put that golden girdle on and and intercede for our families our children depend on it our marriages depend on it and I'll tell you all of that leads to our church depends on it am if we've got family problems scattered families about marriages on the Rocks brothers and and sisters it's going to be pretty hard to come to church and worship but boy when we can intercede for our families we know that the the husband can intercede for his wife and the wife can intercede for her husband that's according to the word I'm not going to quote the scripture all this is just a free let's set the foundation for the Sevenfold Glory of his person but I believe he wants to see that Glory not just in heaven not just in the vision with John he wants to see that glory in his sons and daughters he wants to see that glory in his family our willingness to surrender isn't this good do B benevolence does that sound familiar the wife should offer due benevolence to her husband many times guys will say oh yeah that's right that's the way it is Amen brother but what about us offering our due benevolence to our King to our husband if we're the bride if we're the bride then we're offering that due benevolence and that means the total sacrifice of our Lives laying down our will saying I don't need to do that I want to do that but I know that I need to do this because it's for the betterment of my family our willingness to surrender due benevolence to our husband brothers and sisters is vital you know what it does it demonstrates our kingship we don't even have to say a word because he says it he will magnify himself in our lives if we're willing to to show him that due benevolence we don't have to demand nothing you know what if we've got a wife that's maybe a little bit prickly husbands get in the way of of that of that priesthood get in that sacrificial office and see if God won't come on the scene and change that wife the same thing for the wife she can save her husband that's the word but you know the Way Up Is Down it's not puffing ourselves up and saying this is the word get in line that does nothing does nothing my goodness the Sevenfold Glory of his person there's coming a time though how does this apply there's coming a time where he will no longer be the priest right now he's the priest interceding for every one of our sins we know that as an accuser of the Brethren is there saying do you know what this brother did do you know what this sister did do you know what they're thinking do you know what they're doing remember brother bam said our thoughts in heaven are louder than our voice here on Earth and he knows what we're thinking right now this moment focus on the Sevenfold Glory of his person not brother Barry there's coming a time though where he will no longer be the priest interceding where he will be the judge and it's so beautiful because the world will say that we can look at him and see the judge and and the world wants to run and hide from it just like Adam wanted to run and hide because he knew that he transgressed and that's why people will say oh this religion stuff is just rubbish but is it the believer has the ability to look judgment right in the face and say lord judge me take my life and break me and bless those broken pieces and you'll never be able to bless the broken pieces unless you break them but we know that he will if we're fully willing to surrender to him but it's all about surrender now let's get into the Sevenfold Glory of his person Revelations 1:14 to16 it says his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength brother bradam he says in the church H book and I'm not going to go through and read every one of these just for the record we'll just do a little fly over and then we'll pick up where we left off last week I think it's at number six um we'll just pick up though but brother brother bradam he says in the very next paragraph he says How Deeply moving and inspiring was was the appearing of Jesus to John isn't it interesting because we know we have this picture painted of God the one with a white wig the the the one whose hair was white like wool is white as snow and his eyes as a flame of fire but here we have the prophet saying How Deeply moving and inspiring was the appearing of Jesus to John who is in exile for the cause of the word and behold the Living Word now stands before him John recognized who this was but he also recognized that this wasn't the shepherd this wasn't the the priest this wasn't the interceder the one making intercession for the Brethren now he had moved from the throne and he was standing up and he was coming to claim what was his as the judge what an Illuminating Vision brother bradam says for every descriptive attribute has a significance I just think this is so rich what a revelation of his glorious being he says and we know the first one is that he had hair white as snow and and that signifies absolute uh Authority we know that that's recognized in the world um judges they dress in the robe the the robe to the floor and they wear the white wig and and it signifies absolute Authority and the ability to judge it signifies wisdom and power and strength brother Bram goes on about that in there but we know there's more to it than that um in our day we have seen uh more of that and we would just simply say look at the cloud Vision that happened that cloud over sunset Mountain that's a complete description of what brother Bram said that John saw here and if you look it up in the message you'll see brother brandham talk about the white wigged one and we know that he asked his his friend I think it was Junior Jackson uh can't remember yeah Jack Moore that's who it was thank you brother asked Jack Moore what about that how could it be How could a 33-year-old man have a white hair like that signifying age and wisdom and we know that it was actually not that he got the revelation God spoke to him and said it wasn't the 33y old man this was the supernatural being of God himself manifesting as judge now and you know what age do we live in if that's what actually took place brothers and sisters I I just think it's amazing this is the one that we're talking about now the one whose hair as white as well with absolute Authority and his eyes as a flame of fire that's number two his eyes as a flame of fire brother bham says now those eyes are a flame of fire the eyes of the judge who will recompense those who rejected him my goodness and you know there's going to be no tempering of that judgment I'm jumping ahead when we get to the feet of brass there's nothing you can temper with brass brass is hard when brass is created it's it's the way it is and that's all it's got the molecular composition and you can't change it the only thing you could do is Polish it or melt it but you can't temper it you can't change the hardness of that metal and we will not be able to change the hardness of the Judgment of God when he pours out his wrath without without measure oh my it's incredible but number two his eyes are as a flame of fire and you know brother Bram he talks about this how you know all of all the human emotions that Jesus manifested the most when he appeared as the son of man was this one was that he wept often and the intercessor as the priest he he wept often for all of the people all the human beings on the Earth all of his Brethren who would betray him he wept often because he knew that that so many people would reject of him it's just incredible number two was eyes as flame of fire number three the feet of brass and we've already covered it there's nothing that is known that you can put with it to temper it but it's this brass that describes his feet is more remarkable yet in that it has stood the test of the fiery furnace and that fiery furnace brothers and sisters is to go and actually take all of the sin For All Mankind and put it upon himself he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was placed upon Him amen and by his stripes we are healed he went through that fiery furnace you know brother Brandon brings it out so good he he went from the cross to the temple down to hell isn't that what happened and he knocked on the door and Satan said oh I got you now I've been waiting for you and he grabbed him by the throat and said you don't understand man it's over I'm taking those keys of death and hell right off your side and you're going to wait now until you see me with that white wig and with the eyes of the flame of fire it's coming but we know that's what happened there's a feet of brass there's nothing you can temper with it we know brother Brandon goes on to talk about the Brazen serpent when the children of Israel were misbehaving in the wilderness they were delivered from all their years of hard bondage and their task Masters according to the promise of their forefathers we know that they were finally free and even in the wilderness they had misbehavior they just had their own ideas they just weren't able to be converted and we know brother Brandon brings it out and the word of God says it too that they didn't have faith in their hearts there was nothing in their hearts to mix with that word when it came to them from the prophet and that's why they perished everyone that was 21 years of age and older or 20 years and older all those people God said you know what I'm done with you your carcasses are going to rot in the wilderness and unless we're careful we could find ourselves in that scenario we're talking about the other day I think it's so good I'm probably going to get into this really into this you know there was children that were born in the wilderness weren't they and they never had a problem for food and they they never had a problem for shoes on their feet and they never had a problem with their clothes they never had a problem the only problem they really had was listening to the chatter chatter chatter of their parents chiding against the prophet of God but some of them were able to overcome but other ones you can only imagine they became babies that were actually in the wilderness needing to be bottle fed they couldn't stand on their own they had everything they needed they didn't have any problems in their lives and I I just got wondering we were talking about this is this maybe the way it is when we're raised in the message and we never really have that that close connection with God ourselves when we just live potentially off of Mom and Dad's experience don't get comfortable brothers and sisters get get into Christ that's the only way we're going to get out of here just because we've got Financial blessings natural blessings Health blessings in our lives it doesn't mean that we have God's blessing three the feet of brass but anyways when the children of Israel were in in the wilderness because of their misbehavior we know there was a plague and that plague came from serpents God sent fiery serpents through the camp you want to be that way you want to chide the prophet that's fine you can take some snake bites and everyone who was bit by the snake was killed weren't they they died unless they had a remedy for that bite but God did something he took some a piece I can only imagine of that Brazen feet that Brazen judgment and said to Moses you take that brass and you make a serpent and you put it on a pole and you raise it up in front of the congregation and any time one of them gets looked follow the word of the Prophet follow the instructions that the prophet gives and if you do that you'll live am many people would say well brother Barry that was God's word but where does God's word go how does it come to the to people it's only through the prophet brothers and sisters follow the word of the prophet and take a look at that Brazen Serpent and we know that was a type brother brandom says it of Christ being raised up and those people who are willing to look away from their afflictions to look away from their faults and failures and Look Away to Jesus those are the ones that are going to be saved because I guarantee you that serpent is roaming through the Earth right now and he's just looking like a lion to see whom he can devour and he's going to fite us and unless we're careful those snake bites will kill us spiritually speaking of course that Brazen serpent on the pole symbolized Sin from the Garden of Eden brass it speaks of judgment the Brazen altar had a foundation that was made of brass and we know that that's where the altar was for sin the sin sacrifice was offered upon the Brazen Altar and that was on the outside of the court before you even got into the inner Court of the temple before you even got in there you had to take and make make your sacrifice upon that Brazen Altar and I can't help but think it's a type for us brothers and sisters we've got to make sure that we're doing our part before we even come into to the church before we even get into service we've got to be making sure that we are covering our sin that we're coming to the Lord and surrendering ourselves unto him we know that right now he's still interceding for us but that day is coming brother bam says the day is coming it's coming number four his voice was as the sound of many Waters and what does the waters represent the waters which thou sawest are peoples multitudes Nations and tongues that's Revelations 17:15 it's the voice of the people it's the voice of the ages of all the Believers and brother Bram talks about this in such an amazing way he says all of them were the voice of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost down Through the Ages the voice of many Waters this just opened up up so wide to me I just it's so beautiful brother Bram he goes on to say take heed this very hour for at this moment your thoughts are being recorded in Heaven There your thoughts speak louder than your words even now this could be your last call to hear the word and receive it unto eternal life and how could that be brothers and sisters we don't know what's going to happen to us when we leave this building tonight any one of us could be called to glory the lord could just decide it's time to pick that flower and take it out are we able to hear that voice tonight amen if we are then all we need to do is surrender to it that's all Just Surrender to it but you know brother Bram he says and someday we will hear that same sweet voice speak not in judgment but in welcome to us whose sins have been remitted by his blood whose lives have been spirit filled and whose walk was in the world word amen he says what could be more precious than to hear the multitudes of welcoming voices and be surrounded by those multitudes who have believed unto eternal life oh there is nothing like it I pray that you will hear his voice and Harden not your heart but receive him as your King number five in his right hand were the Seven Stars brother Bram he says it his faithful messenger each age pulled away from God his faithful messenger turned that age back to the word each one of those seven stars were the seven Church Messengers The Seven Church age Messengers as we go we'll probably get some more video or more pictures uh tonight it's just going to be words but we know that they're the faithful messengers of all the church ages brother Bram he says and in thankfulness for his salvation they burned with the light of his life and reflected his love patience meekness Temperance gentleness and faithfulness and God backed them up with wonders signs and miracles they were accused of being Fanatics and holy rollers they were denounced by organizations and held in mockery but they kept true to the word amen I love how brother bradam he says this now it's not hard to stand up and keep true to a Creed it's easy for the Devil is right behind that all that but it is something else to be true to God's word and go back to what the word originally produced at Pentecost I'm just skipping along here so I just want to get to the next one we're almost there but two more paragraphs he says but when you think of that little group whose members were saw asunder fed to Lions persecuted and driven from Pillar To Post and yet stayed true to the word now definitely that would have to be God how they survived their Battle of faith and carried on still that is a miracle and I believe it's the same thing tonight brothers and sisters how are we able to carry on with this word how are we able to continue on believing the the words of a Vindicated Prophet it's not because we joined a cult and we we all just got brainwashed even though we did get brainwashed we got washed of all the trash that's in our lives and in our heads all of our traditional teaching we did get brainwashed but by the word of God yes and that's a miracle brother bradam says that's the greatest Miracle don't be thinking we're going to see someone raised from the dead and we're going to see uh uh cancer healed and we're going to see just Cold's gone and we're going to see food in the pantry and we're going to see money in the bank account and we're going to see all these different great and wonderful things which we all see anyways they all happen all of those things happen there's even more tremendous Miracles that happened I mean we're not going to get into that tonight but the greatest Miracle brothers and sisters is that we have the ability to be converted into a son a daughter of God that we can recognize our position in Christ Jesus that's the miracle but that we have the ability to just continue our Battle of faith and carry on still that is a miracle in the face of all the opposition in this world this world is not set up to be a message believer is it not in any way there's nothing in this world that's a miracle he goes on to say and this comfort Fort is not for the seven Church age Messengers only every True Believer is in the hand of God and can draw from his love and power and receive the full benefit of all that God is to the believer what God gives the messenger and How He blesses and uses the messenger is an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of his body amen amen don't put it off onto the prophet and say it's only for him that's a lie that's not true according to what he said I've heard some people say it it's not true brothers and sisters why would we want to dissect that why would we want to try and take that apart when brother bradam said he heard that voice that said to him all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you will be there on the other side I've heard people want to argue that and say well that's just for a prophet but what does the word say if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet then you receive what the prophet's reward why would we think that we shouldn't see all of that especially since he says it's an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of his body I just can't help but think maybe someone somewhere along the way just didn't really fully realize the impact of of receiving this messenger of receiving this word for our day it's way more than we can even comprehend with our minds number six now we're picking up where we left off that was the last paragraph last week number six The two-edged Sword and boy I feel like we could preach on this and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword Revelations 1:16 Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and that means it has life quick means life it's live the word of God is quick and powerful and sharp sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and you know brothers and sisters we've talked about this many many times this word of God when we hearing the word of God and God is speaking to you you know someone isn't having a conversation about you and trying to slag you and try and influence the minister and trying to twist it and manipulate it to make it this Supernatural thing it's not like that at all brothers and sisters when you hear something that speaks to your soul that's the Holy Spirit we asked him to rain down and when he's doing that in our lives just say Amen to that word and he will change you he's changing us from glory to glory but the word of God is quick and Powerful it's sharper than any two-edged sword and I would say it's sharper than any Minister it's sharper than any Minister that could get behind the pulpit here it's sharper than any Ministry it's sharper than anything we could imagine it's piercing even to the dividing aund of Soul and Spirit it can take apart all that God has created there's only one thing that can do that and that's the word of God but it goes beyond the joints in the marrow it goes beyond the flesh it goes right down into the soul because it's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart brother Bram says out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword which is the word of God you know in Revelation it says blessed are they which read and hear the words of this testimony we don't even have to read it so long as we listen to it I was talking to a brother the other day and he said he's listening to the word of God he's just listening to the Bible and I said Amen to that just listen just allow that word to get down inside you just eat the book and see if God doesn't come on the scene out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword which is the word of God now this is Revelations 19 11-16 brother Bram says and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true in and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire same guy his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture ripped in Blood and his name is called the word of God who's the word of God brothers and sisters we know that's Jesus Christ and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses that's you the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean am anybody here know how to ride a horse doesn't matter you're going to know how we're going to have writing lessons brothers and sisters I can't help but think we're just going to know it we won't even need a lesson not one lesson and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with the rod of iron and he treadeth The Wine Press of the fierceness and Wrath of almighty God and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords am and at that point he's gone from being the intercessor hasn't he now he's the judge he's got the same eyes as the one John turned to see when he was in the spirit on the Lord's Day John 1:48 Nathaniel saith unto him whence knowest whence knowest thou me Jesus answered and said unto him before Philip calth thee called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee now brother bradam he uses that scripture and he says there it is when he comes that word will come against all nations and all men and none will be able to stand against it it will reveal what was in every heart as he did with Nathaniel the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart I think it's so beautiful if we just talk about that for a minute it shows the word of God is in our very innermost being because nobody else can do that nobody else can know the intent of our heart nobody else can know what our thoughts are and we know the word of God says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he how does a heart think A heart doesn't think right it it's the innermost being it's the very soul of a person of the human being but just like it was with Nathaniel that same one the word of God will show who did the will of God and who didn't it will make known the secret works of every man why he did them it will defy the Sunder amen it's such an amazing time I I'm I'm wondering I i' I'd like to see that specific part sometime maybe in brother mervin's timeline where Revelations 19 comes into the into the scen there's so much in there that that takes place where all of the armies come with him I think it's just beautiful just magnificent visualizing the word of God isn't it and just allowing the Lord to reveal it to us as we read it just reading it and just pondering it just thinking about it those thoughts that come to us when they're according to the word they're from God and anything else is of the devil we've only got two thoughts coming brothers and sisters the influence that comes to us it's of God or it's of Satan that's right and if it's of God it's always going to point to the word and if it's not pointing to the word check it we know that brother Bram goes on to say in Romans 2:3 and thinkest thou this oh man that judges them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the Judgment of God Amen then we know he's talking to the Romans there and they're they're they're doing stuff and you know some of them are pretty Pious people and we know the prophet in the had to say to them look what are you judging people for you're doing the same thing how can you judge people when you're doing the same thing judging people as wrong as incorrect as bad but you're doing the same thing you can't do that but we know the word of God is coming and the word of God even now is here and it's Discerning the thoughts and the intents of the heart and it's judging every single man and every single woman and every single child there's nothing hid from God he knows exactly who we are he knows EX exactly what we're thinking he knows exactly what we're planning to do he knows all of it brother bam goes on to say then it goes on to say how God is going to judge men here it is in verse 5 to1 17 the heart in pentant heart will be judged The Works will be judged the motives will be judged there won't be any respect before God but all will be judged by that word no one escaping it isn't it beautiful to to know that to know that's our Anchor Point to know that's our our guide post to know that's our North Star to know that's our Compass to know that that word is our absolute even the prophet said if you can't take my word if you have any questions about what I've told you take the word of God which prophet in this world has said those words because we know there's a lot of people that have gone out there's a lot of false prophets that have gone out in this world we know that when the Bible was being written we know that John was told that beware there's many false prophets already in the world the Antichrist spirit is already in the world creeping in the church causing it to be lukewarm formal and Powerless but there won't be any respect before God but all will be judged by that word amen no one escaping it I just can't help but think how brother Bram he said you know people say that God is going to judge the World by the church some people say that and brother bradam says what church what church is he going to judge it by because if he judges it by one the other's wrong if he judges it by the other ones then the other one's wrong and that's why we say as ministers as pastors don't look at the church brothers and sisters look to Christ this church will take you to hell yes now that's powerful I don't mean it to sound terrible but it is you've got to get to Christ this church is here to get people to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen God's only going to judge the World by his word and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he is that word those who heard and wouldn't listen will be judged by what they heard those that rested in it saying they believed it but didn't live it will be judged every secret will come out in the open and be shouted from the housetops he says oh we will really understand history then there's some questions about history isn't there some real Mysteries but they're all going to be histories when we get there he says there won't be a mystery left from all the ages but do you know that he is revealing the heart secrets of men and women in this age in which we are living it's not just the prophet brothers and sisters we already read that right it's not just for the prophet it's for all the Believers this is real but do you know that he's revealing the heart secrets of men and women in this age in which we are living who else could reveal the secrets of the heart but the word himself Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing a suer of Soul and Spirit and joints and Marrow and a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart he says it is the word it is performing where unto it was sent for it the word is full of power it is the same spirit that was in Jesus the word that is present again in the church in this last age don't think that it was just for the prophet in his time brothers and sisters if anything it's Amplified today otherwise why would God take the prophet off the scene why would he steal the prophet away why would he take him because he wants the many membered body to rise up and recognize its position it's the same spirit that was in Jesus it is the same spirit that was in Jesus the word that is present again in the church in this last age as a last sign trying to head the people off from judgement for they that reject him the word are now already come into judgment crucifying him aesh amen and remember I can't remember what year it was someone here would probably be able to put it out there prophet of God the spirit of God in the prophet he said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ why because you pierce him with your Creeds and your dogmas you take him and make him to be an open shame you put them to be an open shame my Hebrews 66 says if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame goes on to say now Paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself amen and I'll say it this way the word preached actually demonstrates itself because it's a very present help in our time of trouble this is a Living Word brothers and sisters this is not historical accounting he goes on to say like a flame cutting sword it went to the consciences of men and like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases and set captives free everywhere those early Believers went they were preaching the gospel word and God confirmed Med that word with signs following the sick were healed Devils were cast out and they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action that word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians amen that word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride amen he doesn't say in the true word prophet he says it and in the last AG it's here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold on to your the word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom there ain't nothing wrong with just playing the word of God just listening to the Book of Revelation just listen listening to the Book of Daniel just listening to the Book of Genesis just listening to the book of Acts any any word of God brothers and sisters there's a blessing lay in there hold to it number seven let me see here my goodness oh we might have to just pick up where we leave off I don't know we'll see part seven his face like the sun Revelations 1:16 and his countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength and after 6 days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother sorry I want to I want to get this here it's Matthew 17 verse 1-13 and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was as white as as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elijah while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them oh that just gets me excited when I hear that and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid and Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they say saw no man save Jesus only and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elijah is come already and they knew him not but have done unto them whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist but it's interesting because he said Elijah isn't it now we know as message Believers but there might be some that don't know it there is a five comings of the spirit of Elijah and we know that this was a third coming right here right there was Elijah then that Spirit went to Elisha when he picked up the mantle and tried to operate the the gift of the Holy Ghost in his life and then it went to John the Baptist and then it went to William Mary and branam and then it will go to Elijah again himself along with Moses back in Israel and that's going to happen any day now just any day now that will be over there in Israel those people are crying out for messiah they're crying out for messiah brother Bram he says now Matthew 16:28 pref prefacing Matthew 17 1-13 Jesus had said there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom amen and the three Apostles did see just that the order of his second coming Mount Transfiguration brothers and sisters was something very very significant and I want to say this we have a dispensational prophet in our day saying that the order of his second coming those three Apostles they saw the order of his second coming so I want to say tonight based on that what happened on Mount sunset in 1963 what was it that came what what happened brothers and sisters we know what it was it was the word coming of the Lord Jesus Christ himself the white wigged one but the three Apostles did see just that the order of his second coming they saw him transfigured there on the Mountaintop his rment was Blazing white and his face Shone like the sun in its Zenith and there as he appeared stood Moses and Elijah on either side that is exactly how he is coming again now I just can't help but imagine many people will say the bride goes way before the bride is gone they don't see Moses and Elijah some people say well the message of the hour kind of says they might see Moses and Elijah and then they'll go I wonder about this quote here that is exactly how he is coming again truly Elijah will first come and restore the hearts of the children bride back to the father's Apostolic word Doctrine we know know that's already taken place we don't need to see Moses and Elijah in Israel to actually understand that this scripture is fulfilled it's already fulfilled It's Already Done Malachi 45 and 6 says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and we know that's happened and he said and it says he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers and that's already happened both of those lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse Israel is already a nation she is established now with her armies Navy Postal System flag and all that pertains to nationhood but there is still to be fulfilled the scripture that says or shall a nation be born all at once Isaiah 668 that day is coming soon the fig tree has put forth her buds the Israelites are waiting for the Messiah I got connected with a guy who is a lawyer in Israel if anybody's interested I could pass it on to you the link it's a WhatsApp connection and you can see the weekly just about daily updates of what's taking place in Israel right now and and they're crying for messiah this is this is this is a real thing they are really crying for messiah you see them worship they they celebrate Shabbat every single week they are really serious about seeing Messiah come on the scene I think it's just amazing brother bradam he says it the day is coming soon the fig tree has put forth her buds the Israelites are waiting for their Messiah they are expecting him and their expectations are about to be fulfilled Israel will be reborn spiritually for her light and her life are about to be revealed to her Revelations 21:23 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof amen he says this is the New Jerusalem the lamb will be in that City and because of his presence there will be no light needed the Sun Won't rise and shine there for he is the Sun and light thereof himself the Nations that come into it will walk in his light aren't you happy that day is upon us John saw that day coming even so Lord Jesus come quickly Malachi 4 1 to3 for behold that day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in that day that I shall do this saith the Lord of hosts my now I'm getting to where I wanted to get this is where the service is going to start brother bramy says there it is again the sun shining out in all its strength all the strength of the Son of God shining in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks there he stands the judge the one who suffered and died for us he took the wrath of divine judgment upon himself he tread The Wine Press of the fierceness of the wrath of God alone as we have already stated to The Sinner his voice is as the sound of the Cataract or the surf pounding in waves of death upon the rocky shores but to the Saint his voice is as the sound of the sweetly singing brooken as you lie at rest satisfied in Christ I just couldn't help but think while I was studying studying this brothers and sisters if you've ever been in the ocean and you've ever been around Coral or around rocks sometimes those waves will take you and they'll push you up against the rocks and if you can't get your footing if you can't get a grasp on those rocks and get away from it that surf is just going to pound you and the sound of it just Roars and it just continues to push you and pound you and Turn you and flip you and pound you and just scrape you up on those rocks it's terrible sometimes as people we can find ourselves up against the Rocks but there's a delivering power for us we don't have to continually be beat up against the Rocks washed up against the Rocks wind up Shipwrecked smashed to bits there is a cry we just need to listen and hear it he goes on to say I'll just read that last sentence there but to the Saint his voice as the sound of a sweetly singing Brook as you lie at rest satisfied in Christ shining upon us with his warming rays of love he says fear not I am he which was which is which is to come this isn't just for John when we read this brothers and sisters we need to put ourselves in John's shoes and we could preach this I I feel like we could really get started man John in the spirit on the Lord's day he saw that door open in heaven he was called up to a higher Revelation he was called up to a greater calling and when he actually realized that boom he was gone wasn't he it's the same thing for the believer today brothers and sisters I I just need to keep reading and stop preaching I'm sorry it just gets me excited shining upon us with his warming rays of love he says fear not I am he which was which is which is to come I am the all Almighty beside me there is no other I am the Alpha and Omega the all of it he's done it all brothers and sisters he he's he's provided it all and he's done it all he is it all he's the lily of the valley the bright and Morning Star he's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul yes that great day is ready to break and the son of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings are we okay if we go over just a little bit tonight we're two pages away from clearing up chapter 2 and we'll start with chapter 3 next week you know uh he goes on to say the Victorious Christ and when I saw him I fell at his feet is dead this is Revelations 1:17 to8 I fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive for ever more amen and have the keys of hell and death brother Bram says no human could stand the full effect of that Vision his strength utterly Gone John fell at his feet as though dead but the hand of the Lord in love touched him and the voice of blessing said fear not don't be afraid I we know it was the same thing that happened to Daniel he saw that angel on the other side of the river and and he sha like lightning his face sha like lightning and all the strength fell out of Daniel and he was down on his on his face and then he was able to get up on his hands and knees and the angel told him just be strong Daniel be very strong be very courageous don't be weak just just be strong don't be afraid and isn't it wonderful that that's what the Lord tells us continually fear not don't be afraid I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more I I think it's just so beautiful when we hear hear that it says fear not don't be afraid I am the first and the last it's not just because he gave a great tremendous Revelation The Book of Revelation it's not because he just called John fear not because I am the first and the last I I I brought you into this world I called you before the foundation of the of the world I spoke your name I put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life you don't have anything to worry about amen you can't sin amen you're Justified amen and we had God say to this generation and the invisible Union of the Bride you are the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ you never did it in the beginning Satan did it brothers and sisters so don't don't be afraid fear not don't be afraid I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more he brother bradam he says what is there to fear the Judgment that fell upon him at the cross at the grave and when he descended was for us he's done at all we don't have to go into judgment brothers and sisters it's already been passed the judgment's already happened the judge the jury the litigation all of it is done he says he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus amen that's why we keep saying get in the spirit get in Christ Jesus if you can do that brothers and sisters there's rest there 's a Sabbath for youall he goes on to say see for assurity our attorney is our judge amen he is both attorney and judge as judge the case is settled it is finished isn't that beautiful Satan wants to come around and say no no no no no no no there is something there is something there is something no no no no no we need to remember that we're talking about an eternal God we're talking about an eternal word and we need to take it and bring it back to its rightful self don't get caught up in time and space in this Dimension take Satan right back to this Dimension right back to the spirit that John was in on the Lord's day and say Satan remember that day that's a type of me it's not even fair for Satan when we can do that because we can tell them you know what our judge is our attorney our attorney is our judge man and it's over it's already been pronounced there is therefore now no condemnation to me because I don't walk after the flesh I walk after the spirit I want to be in the spirit every single moment of every single day why should the church fear he says what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us have we ever seen him fail us one time brothers and sister I'm not talking about brother Bram not because he did or didn't I'm not talking about a man here we're talking about Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever the one that John saw standing in the midst of the golden candlesticks with the Seven Stars in his hand with the flame of fire as eyes and the hair as white as wolf that one how many times has he failed us never what do we have to fear why should it fear punishment or death it has all been overcome here is the mighty conqueror here is the one who conquered Both Worlds of the seen and the Unseen and you know that really is the biggest fear in human beings many people would say it's the fear of public speaking but really when you come right down to it it's the fear of death because you're going to leave this world and you're going to go to the next you're not going to actually change your character you're not going to be a different person there you're going to be exactly who you are here over there that's that's what the prophet said that's what God said to us through the prophet the person that we are here is going to be the person over there the only thing we're going to take with us is our character either for good or for bad that's what's going to go over there and there's been many times where I've said Lord I can't even look at my character I can't even look at this character in the mirror and think for a second that this character would stand before you because I know it won't it will never be able to stand before you but I need to take it another level I need to go back back back back I need to go back and find that abstract title deed and know that my name is written in that Lamb's Book of Life and that's the only thing I can identify with I can't identify with this flesh if I try and do that I'm always going to be up and down in and out looking at people talking about people going through all these different things no that's not a true Christian a true Christian someone who is truly saved filled with the Holy Ghost is only going to be looking at that Abstract title deed not just for themselves but for their brothers and sisters why should it fear punishment or death why should we be afraid of death brothers and sisters it's only going to going to change our dwelling place and we're going to go to that place where it's just beautiful where we don't even have comprehension of how good it is we got nothing to fear but we know we deal with this hybrid condition what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us why should it fear punishment or death it has all been overcome here is the mighty conqueror here is the one who conquered Both Worlds of the the seen and the Unseen now I just have something I got to put in here it just got me thinking about it and it just made me want to run around the tree and scream and shout and just have a little Revival today when I was listening to it you know he is the Victorious Christ he is the one who is the mighty conqueror and it just made me think of this scripture Colossians 2:2 we are buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and of the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses he's already done it you're already forgiven we've got nothing to be accusing anybody of goes on to say blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and hath spoiled principalities and powers and made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it it's already finished brothers and sisters I just can't help but think when the Devil comes around to tempt us let's quote this scripture to him let's remind him of this it's already done he has made an open display of the victory that he has over all of those principalities and Powers Satan has no power over our marriage Satan has no power over our children Satan has no power over us those ordinances that were written against us they've all been blotted out and I would even go so far as to say this if your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life those ordinances were never written about you maybe it's going a little bit far but I believe it that way brothers and sisters if your name was in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world there ain't no ordinance was ever written against you because you're not you if you're in that book that you that we're talking about is a of God himself am I this is just so rich here is the one who conquered Both Worlds of the seen and the Unseen not like Alexander who conquered the world at age 33 and knew no other way to turn for further Conquest so he died a victim of sin and riotous living you know I I I I I was wondering why would the prophet put this in here why would this even be in here I just can't help but think this is potentially the life of someone that doesn't remain consecrated to the world word we can have Conquest after Conquest after conquest and eventually just get tired and comfortable and say you know what we're on on top of the world we're saved man we've got the message of the hour we got the prophet I've got everything in my life I've had so many victories in my life and you know what can happen we can wind up dying with Riot is living in our lives spiritually speaking if we don't keep the conquest keep the conquest don't be like him he says not like Napoleon who conquered all Europe but finally Was Defeated at waterl and banished to El only to find himself he himself conquered but nothing could conquer Christ he that descended has now ascended above all and unto him has been given a name that is above every name yes he conquered death hell and the grave and has the keys thereof what he looses is loosed and what he binds is bound there is no changing of it there was no conquering before him and there was none beside him he alone is the savior Redeemer he is the only God and Lord Jesus Christ is his name amen don't fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I am you are air to all my power is yours Hallelujah my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst thank you Lorden I don't know man I just think this makes me want to jump and Shout I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it's yours to use it's yours to use now some folks would want to say well this was just a Prophet this was just the prophet of God he was putting this together and maybe he had someone helping him put all the words grammar tizing all this together but then there's others that are going to say this is God speaking to us tonight through a prophet through a Vindicated dispensational Prophet these words made it to print for a reason so that the church in the last day could be encouraged to recognize she doesn't have to be tossed from Pillar To Post she can recognize her position my you speak the word and I'll perform it amen that's my Covenant and it can never f fail my goodness Seven Stars and candlesticks we're just about done one more page Revelations 1:20 The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels messengers of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches we have already discovered the truth of these two Mysteries oh we haven't revealed who these seven Messengers were but by the help of God we will and that mystery will be accomplished The Seven Ages we know they are listed in the word and we will deal with each so as to come up to this last age in which we live but one last closing glimpse of this chapter see him as he stands there in the midst of the golden lampstands with the Seven Stars in his right hand oh it is breathtaking to see him standing there in his Supreme deity amen do you ever just read that script and just try to even visualize it I'll call the musicians because I do want to close I don't want to keep us late here you ever you ever do that though you ever read this scripture Revelations 1 where it describes Jesus Christ standing there in the midst of his church it's breathtaking he is the judge the priest the king the eagle the lamb the lion the alpha the Omega the beginning and the end the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost he which was which is which is to come the almighty the all and all there he is the author and finisher Worthy is the Lamb my maybe stand with me tonight as we close he proved his worth as he brought our salvation by himself now he stands in all his power and All His glory with all things committed to him as judge my I feel like we could just Rapture he says yes there he stands amidst the lampstands with the star stars in his hand it's night for that is when we use lamps for light and that is when the stars are seen shining and reflecting the light of the sun and it is dark the church is walking by faith in its Darkness her Lord departed this Earth but the Holy Spirit still shines out through the church giving light to this old sin cursed world my and those stars reflect his light also the only light they have is his light how dark it is how spiritually Cold Yet when he comes into the midst and is light and warm then the church is empowered and through him does the works that he did brother bradam says this here oh that we might get a glimpse of him as John did my what manner of people we ought to be standing before him at that day if you have not already given your life to him may you turn your heart to God at this moment amen and kneel down right where you are and ask his forgiveness for your sins and surrender your life to him he says then we will attempt to approach the seven Church ages together and as we do I pray that God will help this unworthy servant to reveal his word to you God bless you tonight let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus if we could truly see you as John saw you how marvelous Lord to recognize that you've already judged us and you have found us Lord that we are redeemed you have already pronounced us pardoned written in your blood father as a seal as a sign as a signant to every single principality and Power that would come around and try and

really truly received you in your fullness oh father that they would just open their heart unto you right now as we heard the prophets say just kneel down right where you are and ask you to come in oh Father and that you will fill us those that need a filling of the Holy Ghost father those that need to be saved father wherever we're at whatever we're doing we can just surrender unto you and we know that you will come on the scene if we truly surrender but only truly surrendered Hearts will see this benefit so father we just ask that Lord you would be glorified in our lives in our our thoughts in our hearts in our families Lord in our jobs in our educations Lord whatever it is that we're doing father let us do it unto you father that we would bring glory to your name father that we would have
