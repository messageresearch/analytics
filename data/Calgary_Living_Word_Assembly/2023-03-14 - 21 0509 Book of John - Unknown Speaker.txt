I just can't get out of it and uh I just believe there's so much there and and to be honest with you the whole entire book we know is inspired but what's really inspiring me is the first 37 verses of this chapter if you want to go ahead and read them I'm sure that you'll probably see the direction that I'm getting out of it but talking John the Apostle is talking about John the Baptist and that's what this is about and today we're just going to talk about John the Baptist and and the John anointings the Elijah anointings and just see what the Lord has in store how they're all tied together it's not a separate thing even though it is a separate thing it's interesting that every single anointing comes exactly according to the word there's no deviation from it and if you really look at it you can see so many parallels uh it's just undeniable when you believe the word of God to be the infallible truth it's wonderful let's just start reading with verse 1. Gospel according to John chapter 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear Witness of that light that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will of man but of God they were born again let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we have ridden this red sorry this sacred text and father we pray that you would just speak to us out of it Lord that you would just break it open to us once again Lord that we could just be seated together in Heavenly places Lord we know that we are but father that we could see that we are Lord Jesus that father you would just open our eyes of understanding today that we would just be able to come a little higher in you open this word to us we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you this morning you may be seated we have couple of announcements we just wanted to make sure that everyone's aware I sent an email and a text and I announced it before and I'll say it again we'll probably continue to say it just so everybody's on the same page we have canceled the services and Left Bridge due to the new covet restrictions the amount of people that takes to actually make the service happen on an ongoing basis it just isn't feasible to be able to provide an opportunity for the folks in Lethbridge to come and fellowship as well it would just turn into a service of uh us going to Lethbridge and having Church which probably isn't all a bad thing but uh just for the sake of the folks in Lethbridge we wouldn't want to go down there and then tell them they can't come that would just be not nice so until uh June more further notice we will definitely be postponing the services um I just want to say this I've fellowshipped a little bit recently with some folks around and I'm certainly thankful for the position that we've taken I know that I've struggled with it it's been very difficult because some people even around the message have decided to just go forwards and have church and continue on and just do whatsoever they feel and some have said that it's an infringement in their in their Christian rights and uh I'm not here to dispute it one second with anyone what your stand is on the word is between you and God that's not mine I'm not here to dispute that for a second but one thing I am thankful for I'm not proud of I'm thankful for is that in this church we have not had a ravaging of this disease of this virus it has been stable we have had a few people infected it has been managed and it has not been spread through the church and what a tremendous blessing that is we'll give all the glory to God just talking to other people there's there's been some people really affected by covet and it's actually uh almost saddening to see that people have put themselves in the line of fire that way and uh like I said I'm not here to to judge anyone we all have to live according to the Revelation that God gives us if he says you know drink something poisonous and you have that Revelation then you should do it and and he'll protect you right Mark 16 in action but uh we also know the story I'll just tell this little story here uh about the person who was enduring a hurricane and and and they went through the hurricane and they died and they went to heaven and and and they they drowned in this hurricane as the waters came up over top of their house and and and and they said to God well you know why why didn't you save me and I'm probably getting the story wrong I'll just do my version of it this morning but and God said to the man he said well you know I did send help your way and he said when I never saw any angels I never saw anything spectacular and he said well when I sent that man to knock on your door and tell you there's a hurricane coming flee leave your house you're going to die if you stay it's a bad one and you didn't stay you didn't listen and then you had a helicopter come and shine his light on you when you were on top of the roof of your house to get on the helicopter and you said no God's Gonna Save Me I don't have to get on a helicopter I'm not looking for a man to save me I want God to save me and he said to the man that helicopter was from me as well but you refused it brothers and sisters God uses men he uses doctors and he uses medicine and I think it's very important for us to not get caught up in in in all of the different mindsets in this world I think maybe it's it's worthwhile to take one step backwards and just say what has happened in the past in the past there's been illnesses and God has actually allowed the cure to be given to man so that man could administer it to man to save men I just want to say could it be all of the connection to social media and the connection to news media and the connection to all of the different people out there and all of the videos and all of the ideas and theories has put doubt in our minds I would say be very careful what we watch we have to be very careful what we watch I heard them something astounding this morning for me it was astounding for me but we know that in the Garden of Eden that Satan he injected himself into Mankind through the serpent we know that right that's not up for debate or discussion but you know this is Satan's Eden and and really what I heard today that was astounding for me is that Satan is doing that again to Mankind and how is he doing that brothers and sisters what's the gateway to the soul the gateway to the soul is the eyes what we see remember that lot he vexed his righteous Soul daily with the things that he saw and the things that he heard the things that he took into his body through the eye gate and through the ears we need to be very careful that we're not listening to things that are contrary to the word for our day the mark of the beast is not a vaccine if somebody believes that I want to say it right now loud and clear that is an antichrist spirit because the prophet for our day said that it's actually refusing to accept the Holy Ghost that's the mark of the beast is powerful it's strong it's a clothesline religion don't get caught up in what man wants to say and think and do follow the prophet follow the one who has given us the ability to be saved in our day don't try and make our own version of it don't say I I believe the prophet said it this way but we can do it that way that won't save you God will say to you that day why didn't you accept my provided way it might not have been the way that you wanted it to be but it was the way that I provided for you we don't want to get sidetracked I want to say happy Mother's Day to all the mothers it takes a real special person to be a mother in this world a real special person to be a mother and you know I'll say this we we take the opportunity to say thank you to our mothers on on one day of the year it's acknowledged but children acknowledge your mother's every day amen acknowledge your mother's every chance you get mothers are human beings and sometimes they make mistakes too just like the rest of us some might argue that my wife's gonna have a discussion with me afterwards but it's true sometimes people make mistakes and it doesn't mean anything a mother's love for their children can't be broken God bless you mothers today certainly thankful for every single one of you what a special opportunity it is as a child to say to your mom thank you for loving me because if we have a mother that loves us it is just amazing it is absolutely amazing to see a mother's love God bless you moms today I just want to talk a little bit of John the Baptist and uh just sort of see a comparison between John the Baptist and William Miriam Branham and sort of the scriptural identity of William Mary and Branham in the scripture alongside of John the Baptist we know that they're Elijah anointings and uh there's five of them that come into the world five Elijah anointings there's Elijah Elisha John the Baptist brother Branham and then Elijah again as one of the two witnesses Elijah and Moses back to Israel once again but uh today we just want to talk about Elijah in our day so you know a lot of the inspiration I'm going to talk about today is out of the the message birth birth pains in 1965 but the Branham talks about how the world is going through cycles and it's going through birth pains and you know one of the first things when a mother is actually due when she's pregnant and and it's time for her her delivery of the child and and she feels like it's time to go to the hospital brother Branham spells this out really good in this message and he says one of the very first things that a doctor will do when when a mom comes to the hospital and says it's time they'll say okay is it time and and what they'll do is begin to measure the contractions and anyone who has had children understands that that is sort of the Keystone to it there's a thing called Braxton Hicks and it's false alarm but it's still the body reacting sometimes it will actually start to contract early and that's what they call it but then there's a time where it's real and and the body has contractions and when when it's time to deliver the baby the contractions get closer and closer and closer together and and what it is it's the the stomach muscles everything in the core of the woman's body is squishing together because it's time to actually deliver the child and brother Bradham says the first thing the doctor does is measure measure the time the space of time between the contractions and then he begins to relate it to the World the natural world in which we live in and and and the different contractions that have happened and he talks about the world wars and and World War one and how that was one major contraction and and to look at it and see that the whole entire world contracted there and and we know that the world is is going to give birth we're talking about the world actually going forward to give birth to deliver the children of the of the most high the Sons and Daughters of God all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God and here we are but brother Branham says that world war one was one of the first contractions really big contractions World War II was another one of those contractions and and he goes on to say that you know the world really can't stand any more contractions because the next step is a nuclear step and if that happens it's like a room full of mouse traps you set one off and it'll just be a chain reaction all over the place and then you know the world is off its kilter and completely burned by fire and we know that the the word prophesies that there will be a day where the elements melt with a fervent heat and you know brother Branham talks about how mankind is going to destroy itself it's not going to be God that destroys Mankind and I think that's a common sort of uh misconception that's put out there is that God is putting judgment on the world and although he is putting judgment on the world he's not taking a nuclear bomb and dropping it on the Earth it's man that does that man breaking into breaking into the laboratory of God learning how to split atoms where did that come from how could that possibly be it's a direct line back to the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the ability to learn things that man really doesn't need to know man there's no need for man to split atoms maybe I guess if we were to look at it in a carnal sense some people might argue and say well we need to be able to to split water to create hydrogen so that we can have a clean burning fuel so that we can stop the fossil fuels but what good is that going to be for us in our lives we're not looking for a a lengthening of days and a and an enduring ability to stay here on Earth we're looking for the Rapture of the church when brother Bradham was here he preached I believe it was an invisible Union at the very beginning of that message he said I'm not looking for a Revival in this generation because we know he said it very clearly in 1956 1957 that was the call to actually repent and if they chose not to repent in the USA that was it the he he indicted them for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ the prophet of God can you imagine that the prophet of God indicting this generation for the second crucifixion of of the Lord Jesus Christ and we know that it's not a physical thing but it's a spiritual thing and that's the age that we live in and that's why it's so deceptive for Satan so deceptive for us not for Satan but he just he just floats around under the surface through everything and and it's just his Eden and if we're not careful if we're not Discerning by the word we will get Swept Away by his ideologies and it doesn't matter what it is that's why brothers and sisters I've said it in the past if we don't go on to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in our own lives if we don't get that token as brother brother Peter prayed if we don't get that token in our lives in our homes then something will sweep us away there are so many movements out there now so many different cultures and and ideologies and and things that people can just get mixed up in and you know what they are brothers and sisters they're demons they're demon Spirits it's going walking around like a roaring lion seeking whom they may devour and if we don't have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're going to get caught up in one of them something's going to grab us and we're just going to jump on board with it why because the human body the human being has been created to worship it's been created to be the Tabernacle of the most high God that's why when we sing that song come by here my Lord what are we saying we're not saying come by here to this church building don't come by here to this house that we're gathered in don't come by here to this car come by here to this heart to this Soul anoint my soul with thy blood give it give me the holy spirit it's got to be that way it's got to be personal brother Paul said that make it personal today that's what it has to be if it's not that personal then we're missing the point we're missing the point entirely we don't want to just come to a service and have a have a holy ghost anointing on my spirit and have a holy ghost anointing on my flesh and and maybe see a good Financial blessing in my bank account and and see that God provides all of my garments I've got great clothes and a great house and a great car and everything in my life is great but what great is it if you don't have the Holy Ghost if the token isn't applied in your life brother Branham says that causes a reaction in our lives we become new creatures in Christ Jesus but it can become very easy brothers and sisters to make a traditional ideology out of the message of the hour out of the Gospel don't do it don't get caught up in that Satan wants that Satan wants us to feel like we're saved it's not about feelings brothers and sisters and don't go the other way either and and have Satan make us feel like we're not saved because really Satan's got nothing to do with it our feelings are irrelevant if we've met the requirements then God is obligated to his word brothers and sisters all we have to do is meet the requirements and when Satan comes buzzing around to try and tell us oh look what you did or didn't do look at what you thought or didn't think you you you should have or you shouldn't have all of the garbage that Satan tries to lie to us about you know how we know if it's Satan if if if he just opens his mouth and we hear this lie anything that's contrary to the word brothers and sisters is Satan talking to us trying to mix us up and get us confused remember God is not the author of confusion he has not come to confuse us he has come to deliver us to give us the pure Word of Deliverance in our day and that is through the message of the hour I'm just going off here a bit and uh I guess it's just the inspiration and you know what I would say it's the pull the people activating this pulling it out of me this is wild you know out of birth pains in 1965 I'll just start here brother Branham says this and this is just notable this is the message encapsiled the message encapsled to the True Believers it's just beautiful I love this because remember I'll just explain it I'll give a little uh preface to it sorry I'm making it confusing but I just get excited about it this is Brother Branham uh just about to actually preach and someone actually actually I think he did preach sorry but he gives a a speaking in tongues there's a there's a tongues speaking in tongues and there's an interpretation in tongues and there's actually three Witnesses for the speaking in tongues and and this is what the interpretation of it is here he says because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou Hast walked of your own choosing your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself is that which will give and make come to pass their tremendous victory in love divine I love how he says it here their victory in love divine not the victory in love divine and and he says like in French here it's the verb before the adverb and I'm not a gram a scholar with grammar I'm not going to pretend that but what I am going to say is that in the other interpretations that you pull out of the message of the hour he says the here he says there this in itself is that which will give and make to come path to pass there t-h-e-i-r victory their tremendous victory in love divine brothers and sisters I'm reading that because I believe he's speaking about a group of people I don't believe that that was just something for the prophet just to say God is just anointing his prophet and it's just for his man he who receives a prophet receives the prophet in the name of a prophet receives the prophet's reward right so brothers and sisters I believe we can take that and apply it to our own lives it's of your own choosing if you decide to accept the message of the hour and say maybe God God I I I don't understand it at all it sounds like fanaticism but I'm gonna take you at your word and say if if you be God then be God reveal yourself to me according to the way that these fanatical people are talking about that God speaks to people through a prophet remember the word always comes to a prophet that's scriptural that is a scriptural thing John the Baptist is the representation in Malachi 3 there's some people that would say that that well Malachi 4 was the representation of John the Baptist and that's not true that's not true at all according to what brother Branham said if we could turn over to Malachi we can just read that quickly here for a second Malachi chapter 3 verse 1. it's amazing how God will take and use a man and just reveal the word through him and I'm speaking about brother Branham here how he would just show us things show his children things that the whole world has no idea about is is caught up in a theological traditional teaching kind of thing I believe there's so much in here we we might wind up taking a little bit of time studying this here but in Malachi chapter 3 verse 1 behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom ye Delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts Malachi 3 brother Branham talks about this in the message birth pains there's a Malachi 3 messenger and there's a Malachi 4 messenger and they're two separate Messengers both representing the very same thing very important to understand let's just flip the page and turn over to Malachi 4. Malachi 4 verse 1. we'll just read the whole chapter because it's only six verses for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch I just I just love this next part because the first part sounds so frightening it sounds so alarming to think that there's going to be no place to hide on that day and there won't be but verse 2 but unto you that fear my name I think we could just stop right there and have like a little Revival in our lives in our service here but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this saith the Lord of hosts brothers and sisters there's so much there in in verse 2 and verse 3. I just believe that it behooves us if we believe that God sent a prophet if we believe that we have received the true token the true absolute the message of the hour Christ the Holy Ghost In Our Lives then you know what brothers and sisters I would say this go forwards in your lives and say that ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this saith the Lord of hosts we know that the Rapture is a cycle it's not just an event and that's where a lot of the theological studies the traditional denominational teachings they make it just one event and that's it we had a prophet of God say no no no no it's an it's a it's it's a cycle it started a long time ago where did it start brothers and sisters way back before the foundation of the world when God created the very first sacrifice for Adam and Eve when Eve decided to eat of the fruit of the tree we know it wasn't that it was an act it was way back there all the way down through all of the scripture we could see the Rapture happening but you know where did it start I don't know I I don't know where it started in our day I would say with William Marion Branham there's so many examples in the Bible I think it can be easy to just say that it's well it's an event and it's just the same thing as saying that the Pentecostals are are a denomination brother Branham says that's putting a period behind it and that's not right it won't work that's where God says Ichabod and leaves he doesn't have anything to do with it anymore because you put a period you try and put God in a box it doesn't work that way brother Bradham said that Pentecost is an experience and it's very much a part of a message believer's life that's why to just be like a dried up old stick when you hear the word of God preached and to not have it move you and change you and and and and form you and and encourage you there's something wrong brothers and sisters brother Branham says it that religion without emotion is dead there should be something in us that cries out amen when we hear the word of God but sometimes we'll struggle at the Veil sometimes we'll struggle at the veil and brothers and sisters it's so important to not do that because God chooses his own way we we can't pick his own way he chooses his own way but you know just going back to our scripture here in in verse 3 verse 2 even but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the star I talked about this before and I'll just say it again that if you wonder if God has his hand in your life if he didn't have his hand in your life you'd be just like a bug on a windshield of a car to Satan if Satan could have his opportunity to steal your soul and take you to hell he would do that that quickly don't doubt that brothers and sisters if we are able to live our lives and have a little bit of success in our lives and be able to go to work and and go home one of the things that's just struck me so hard recently is the ability to just sit down with my family at dinner time at supper time and just have supper and hold everyone's hand and say thank you Lord for bringing us home safely again together so that we can be together as a family so that my boys can have their daddy and their mommy everyone together one of our most important times I think and there was a time where it wasn't like that you know why because it wasn't a revelation to me it wasn't important to me making money was important to me but you know what happens when we start to actually get the ABCs correct in our lives God pours out a blessing on our house that we can't even contain it's got nothing to do with tithing it's got everything to do with our heart absolutely everything to do with our heart what do we do with our time how much how many hours do we have in a day do we give them 10 percent of our time it's fine to give them 10 percent of our money and maybe a little bit if we feel led but what do we do with our time brothers and sisters 10 percent of the first fruits that we have if we have breath in our lungs that's a fruit that's something he's given us we need to give unto him all that we have not part of it but you know when we do that in our lives He blesses us in ways that maybe we didn't even realize it's amazing to how he looks after us but if we look at these scriptures here but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings he'll he'll arise and and heal our souls he'll arise in our lives the day star arises in our lives in such a way that people say who are you and what have you done with with with my brother or my sister who what what's going on you know what that is that's him rising in our lives and our souls with healing in our wings taking us back to the original word that was that was delivered unto us by our fathers but we've been given the ability to go forth and grow up as calves of the stall totally protected totally looked after Satan can't harm us and you know what we when we look at our lives and we'll say Satan can't harm us sometimes God will allow something to come our way and why so that he can prove us he can prove his child he can prove his seed through the situation in our lives if God allows something to come our way it's not so he can destroy us it's not so that the Devourer can destroy us because his word says that I'll rebuke the Devourer go ahead and try me see if it won't work see if I'm not true to my word for you gives us the ability to grow up as calves of the stall that's why I I don't know I just think about it so often you know any success that we have in our lives I mean any success that we have in our lives is not because of us it's because of God Almighty it's because he has created a stall that if we fear his name that he will allow us to grow up and and and and let us grow up as a calf in a stall where there's no wolves there's no no enemies there's no problems there's no things that are going to have their way in our lives unless he first allows it and if he allows it it's for our Perfection but it's amazing to look at it and think down that you know we can actually tread down the wicked in this cycle of the rapture this is what I wanted to get to here with this this couple of verses here you know brothers and sisters don't think that that's out there somewhere in the future it's it's potentially right now today as we go forwards you know what the Serpent's head has been bruised and the man's heel has been bruised those two scriptures have been fulfilled but there's another one here that someone has to go forward and tread down the wicked we can go forwards and know that Satan can't touch us and you know what if Satan touches us it's because God allowed it and when that happens we can say blessed be the name of the Lord because I know you're trying to work something out of my life here and when I come out the other side not if I come out the other side when I come out the other side it's going to be glorious because you're working out your will in my life not complain and say oh Lord lament cry sackcloth and Ash OH I'm down on the dumps with the wicked is just encamped about me no no no no we've been given way more than that we've been given the complete open Word in our day we've been called unto adoption and given full Authority and Power and the only thing we have to do is believe it how do we believe it brothers and sisters here's here's brother Barry's key for the day how do we believe it brothers and sisters speak it you know the the the the work world and and all of the self-help world all of that world in this world the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is totally tapping into that the spoken word the power of the spoken word when we speak God speaks if you have the Holy Ghost in your life brothers and sisters which you do I believe it when you speak God speaks that's what the prophet taught I'm not going to bring a quote for that I'm going to say look it up get out the message app and look it up the prophet says that when two omnipotents meet look out the sea Gene of God and his Spirit Come Together it's omnipotence brothers and sisters when we speak he speaks that's why brother Branham brought that message why Christ speak Moses you've been given that staff in your hand and you've been shown what will happen if you throw it down you've been shown what will happen if you wave it over top of the river you've been shown what will happen if you point it to the North you've been shown what will happen if you point it to the east you've been shown what will happen over and over and over again and here you are at the Red Sea With the Enemy coming up behind you and you've got nowhere to go don't cry speak the word and as soon as he did that what happened we know what happened Pillar of Fire came down and actually blinded the enemy and kept them nice and warm at night the same thing that destroyed the enemy kept them safe kept them as a calf of the stall but God didn't come down and say now I'm I'm going to step forwards and I'm going to part the waters he said no why cry speak the word and go forwards enough already let's move on from the principles of the doctrines of Christ of laying on of hands and water baptism let's move into Perfection let's come to the place where we recognize that we're fully mature Sons and Daughters of God by the message of the hour that we've been delivered brothers and sisters when we speak God speaks if we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when you speak the word you're speaking for God he's not coming down to speak the word he's using you to speak the word he's using me to speak the word when we speak the word it's God speaking the word that's why we have to be so careful to not allow Satan to speak the word through us because either God's going to speak the word through us or Satan's going to speak the word through us and we know that Peter encountered that and there was a very very graphic description of it Jesus was explained to the disciples I have to be delivered up to be to be to be crucified so that I could save the the people of this world that I could be the the atonement for all of the sin of the world and Peter the fervent one the the action man stood up and said no not so not on my watch Lord I'll pull out my sword and I'll protect you you'll never be killed as long as I'm around and what did Jesus say he stood up and he said to him get thee behind me Satan not Peter Satan remember he was the one that was chosen the chosen one that he would build his church upon and we know the denominational world has taken that round with it and that's not what I'm saying he didn't build his church upon Peter a man so unstable that he would curse the Lord three times while lying no no it was the Revelation that God gave him Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven so all I'm saying is we need to be careful when we speak the word whose word are we speaking brothers and sisters are we speaking the Lord's word or are we speaking Satan's word because we're going to speak one of them you know what I'll tell you this if it's negative it's Satan's word because there ain't one part of the word that's God's that's negative is there if there is I would like to hear it someone should tell me we should talk about it because everything that the Lord says is Holy and true every part of the word is positive towards his children all of his thoughts are positive towards us you know there's these are both anointings Malachi 3 Malachi 4 both anointings of John the Baptist we know that John the Baptist he came in Malachi 3 in Jesus day but they're actually anointings of Elijah they're the Elijah anointings and uh so I just thought I would take a few moments and and just sort of go back I know there's so much here there's so much here with this and I'm just grazing the surface of it today I believe that we'll probably stick around here for a little while Lord willing but you know these are both Elijah's anointings and if we just look back at second Kings chapter two I'll just read it for time's sake verse 14. I mean turn there if you want to go ahead turn there second Kings chapter 2. maybe it would be good to read it second Kings chapter two if you haven't read this in a while I think it might be worthwhile to just read maybe Second Kings um chapter two maybe even chapter one and two and three and four the whole the whole story in here is just fascinating about the Elijah anointing in second Kings chapter two and we know this is the story of Elijah being taken up in the Chariot of fire and and he told Elisha that's why I say go back and read this if you haven't read in a while um he told Elisha that if you see me when I go then whatever you ask you can have so he actually prophesied of of the Rapture that happened here for Elijah but now here we are Elijah has already been raptured he's gone up in the Chariot of fire Elisha wouldn't be uh tricked he wouldn't be distracted Elijah said to Elisha many times you know why don't you just pray here Terry here I pray thee and and I'll go my way and he said no you know I'm not letting you out of my sight man I know that there is a promise coming to me if I see you when you go so I'm not letting you go anywhere you're not getting away from me man I'm getting exactly what is Promised for me and I believe it has to be that way for the True Believer today brothers and sisters but in second Kings chapter 2 verse 14 and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he had also when he had also when he also had Smit in the waters they parted hither and tither and Elisha went over s and sisters I think it's just one of my favorite scriptures because I believe it's the same thing and I know there's people that would say now you're getting crazy you're going out on a limb and saying the the whole mantle Doctrine I'm not saying a mental Doctrine but yet I am saying a mental Doctrine and I am saying that the mantle is the message of the hour and that mantle has been dropped and it's been put in someone's hand who has the mantle today we're not saying that we have some mantle and I know that's a demonic Doctrine out there and I'm not saying that but I am saying the message of the hour brothers and sisters there's a point where we have got to come to in our own lives where we can smoke the waters ourselves and say where is the god of Elijah when we have a problem in our life take the message of the hour and smoke those Waters with it don't just tolerate it and say well I guess it's what God's will is for me God's will is for me to just go through this and I have to endure it God is waiting for us to stand up and say no where is the god of Elijah where's the god of William Miriam Branham Mark 16 in action is the true church that Christ will claim as his own and all else is false that's what the word says that's what the message of the hour says and you know I'll say it this way there's denominational teachers out there who have this Doctrine and they're actually broadening it their own but people are buying into it hook line and sinker they're bypassing the prophet and they're totally getting into this believing it that if I can stand up and say I have authority in Jesus name oh I have it and you know what they do because it's gone that way but to go outside of the prophet of the hour they're going to find that they'll be in the wedding supper and he'll say to them friend how did you get in here why don't you have a wedding garment on we know the whole story I'm not going to go too far with that but unless we come according to the word for our day we're not going to get the right results but there's people is my point they're they're buying into this they understand this principle that when they speak God speaks if they apply the word correctly and when the sons of the prophets verse 15 and when the sons of the prophets which were to view it Jericho saw him they said the spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha and they came to meet him and they bowed themselves to the ground before him and you know after this they said well Elijah you know he just must have been translated by God he must have just been teleported somewhere and you know these are the the prophets from the school of the prophets and and they said they bugged him so much to go and look for Elijah because they just didn't listen to what the word of the day was they bugged him so much till he was ashamed is what the word says they made him ashamed at at his understanding of the word that they would say it so much over and over and over you call yourselves prophets and yet you're going to disbelieve the word that was spoken to you okay go ahead go look for him three days they went searching and they couldn't find him and they came back and said oh my truly something must have been there about that saying that you said well yeah the prophet of God said thus saith the Lord there's coming a Time out of birth pains in 1965 brother Bradham says so someday the great Trumpet Of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess to this word well what's he coming after what's he coming here for notice she brought forth this complete word which was made flesh under birth Pains of the prophets that blasted out he's a coming he's a coming he's a coming he says but she was without a prophet for 400 years according to history and to scripture from Malachi unto John they only had theologians priests pastors now here we can imagine without that without that what kind of a rotten condition her system must have been in 400 years without a message direct of thus saith the Lord from God so the priest prophets and so forth had got it into an awful mess she was a rotten it's amazing I just had to read this just as we sort of set the background and maybe build a bit of a foundation for all of this discussion but to think 400 years is what brother Bradham was talking about how many years was it since Christ since the initial Church the last major prophet that was on Earth how many years has it been he's saying 400 years here how rotten a condition it must have been in today we're talking thousands of years before the prophet of God would be on the scene again to say thus saith the Lord how rotten of a condition must it be in now oh my I mean we know this I get it in Matthew 17 and his disciples verse 10 and his disciples asked him saying what then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things he shall come and restore all things but he goes on to say but I say unto you that Elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise so also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist I believe that that's applicable for our day too brothers and sisters won't they say the same thing wasn't Elias supposed to come wasn't there supposed to be a third anointing a fourth anointing story of of Elias in our day was it wasn't something supposed to happen and and Jesus said I tell you that he's already come and they did unto him whatsoever they listed and it's happened in our day they put out brother Branham in the end he talks about it in this message birth Pains being in in Arizona and not one of the ministers wants to actually have any fellowship with him because he's off on his Doctrine because of a cloud because of the opening of the seals it was beyond their comprehension but the crazy part about it is it was exactly according to the word it wasn't outside of the word for their day but they were willing to take their Theology and their Traditions over top of actually looking at the word and saying well let me just compare this with the word does it actually compare but I say unto you that Elias has come already and they knew him not but they have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them what happened in the day when William Mary and Branham was here it was the coming of the son of man it wasn't William Marion Branham nope he was here just like John the Baptist to introduce the coming of the son of man because remember the word always comes to the prophet amen it doesn't come to the Theologian it doesn't come to the universities it doesn't come to the pastors doesn't come to the teachers doesn't come to the evangelists and it doesn't come to the the hireling preachers it comes to the prophet and that profit has come in birth pains brother Branham says then John the promise of Elijah of Malachi 3 not Malachi 4 Malachi 3 because Jesus said the same thing in Matthew in the 11th chapter when John's Eagle Eye got filmed over as I believe pember's early ages expresses and he said go ask him if he's the one or should we look for another see and he said Jesus after sending his disciples back after telling them to stay at the meeting and watch what happens and go show John these things and blessed is he not offended he turned and looked his disciples and the people that he was speaking to and said what did she go out to see when you went to see John I just found this so striking as I was going through this because I believe it could be the same thing today brothers and sisters what did you see when you went out to see William Mary and Branham what did you see what do you see when you press play what what are you looking for when when you think about the message of the hour what what is it that we're doing here what's it all about Jesus said to his disciples what did you go out to see when you went to see John did you go out to see a man in soft Raymond and he said I say unto you that's the kind that stays in King's palaces now this is Brother Branham speaking here he's he's paraphrasing the scripture um he said did you go out to see a reed that was shaken by the wind I just love this part it's so important for us to maybe just stop and dwell on some of these little points I believe with all my heart because it can be so easy to just hear them and just gloss over them and just miss them and maybe not pick them up but there's some really strong nuggets right here he said did you go out to see a reed that was shaken by the wind in other words every little sting come along he shook by it it's interesting to think about hey a reed shaking in the wind I always thought about a reed shaking in the wind just a rattling noise and you know maybe just something there that's looks nice or whatever maybe when you see all of them it looks like a natural setting but here we have the prophet of God saying every little sting that came along how easy it can be for us to be upset if we don't have the token in our lives you can have someone quote the message of the hour to you and become offended by it if we don't have the the token in our lives someone can come along and and be used by Satan to beguile us to think that maybe the pastor doesn't love you he hasn't phoned you he doesn't care for you at all or the Deacons they're just rude the deacons have no care concern for what our spiritual health is you can have all of these different thoughts that can come into your mind but brothers and sisters without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives there's nothing taking them into subjection according to the word it's something that will come along and and take us far away and that's what he's saying here did you go out to see a reed that was shaken in the wind did you go to see something that was good the the latest and the greatest did you go out to see the the most fascinating thing that came along since sliced bread in other words did every little sting come along Shook You by it I'll tell you if you just come over to join our group we can give you a better salary he just takes it right out of Jesus time and brings it right into current time and say that you know what if you don't like what's going on over there come on over here let's just do something a little we could just do whatever we want over here and sure enough we can God will allow it but is it according to his will I don't know we we just want to be careful to make sure it is he says I'll tell you if you just come over and join our group we'll give you a better salary not John if you just won't preach against this and that well you can join our group not John said then what did you go out to see a prophet and I say unto you more than a prophet for if ye can receive it this is he who was spoken by the prophet saying I'll send my messenger before my face to prepare the way he says that's Malachi 3 1 not Malachi 4 at all that's a different because that Elijah come to the worlds to be burnt immediately and the righteous walk out on the ashes of the wicked and brothers and sisters going back to our scripture here in in Malachi chapter 4 verse 3 and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in that day that I shall do this saith the Lord of hosts just think about it here we are however many days after this Prophet was here on Earth with a prophetic utterance saying these words because that Elijah come he's speaking about himself not insane when I come he's saying when that Elijah comes when that anointing comes that the world's going to be burnt over right after he says immediately and then the righteous walk out on the ashes of the wicked so we're talking about God's timetable here how many days do we have left here on this Earth to preach this message to hear this message how many more mother's days do we have to celebrate brothers and sisters we don't know I'm not going to put a time stamp on it but I will say that we are allowed to know the season and if you want to know God has a timepiece just look at Israel they're building houses over there at a fervent pace they're settlers settling all over Israel because they know that where the settlers are scattered over Israel that they have to get protection from the police from the military and the more land they take the more land they get if they just sit back and say no we're just not going to do anything and you know we'll just follow the international rules they know that they're in their promised land and they know that's their land and they're going forward because of what's in their hearts what's genetically coded in their souls they're going forward because that hundred and forty four thousand is actually rising up today one of these days those two witnesses will appear on all of the media Outlets all over the world we know that's coming brother Branham says that immediately after the righteous walk out on the ashes of the wicked that's why I said earlier brothers and sisters as we go forward as calves of the stall knowing that we're completely looked after that we really are completely looked after in our lives sometimes it can feel so terrible maybe lonely maybe frustrating maybe scary all of these things we just walk in through the valley of the shadow of death but brothers and sisters don't fear any evil because his rod and his staff it Comforts us he checks us out he makes sure that we're healthy he doesn't leave us abandoned or on our own he is with us everywhere that we go he knows our every single care we have the ability to walk with the souls of our feet today on the ashes of the wicked because all that we see today as we walk forward today brothers and sisters just just think about this as you go forwards today while we walk around today all of this all of it man is potentially ashes already all of it it's all going to burn all of it has to be purified all of the things that we keep sacred and and we want to hold dear and near to our hearts it's all going to burn all of it our flesh our bodies Our temples that sometimes will worship all of it is going to burn none of it is going to make it over there all of it has to burn so as we go forwards I just wanted to throw this out there let's think about this potentially if it's all going to burn then it's potentially already ashes remember that Abraham he called the things that weren't as though they were right and the things that were as though they weren't and it was imputed unto him for righteousness don't think it's any different for us brothers and sisters don't say that's a special blessing just for Abraham and not for me we have the exact same thing we've got more you know it goes right back to that saying that you know when we get over there we're going to say Moses how did you do it Daniel how did you endure the Lion's Den overnight how did you make it all these people are going to say no no no no no no no there's lots of time there's as many years as we have desire for to talk about all that we want to know how you survived laodicea how did you survive with a lid of Hell taken off and all of the Devils of all of the ages that never die all those spirits that had their guns trained on you how did you have the ability to just continually keep getting up Satan would knock you down and you just get back up again Satan would come around and try and steal one of your children and you would just get back up again and and and Satan would come around and try and do something to your wife and you just get back up again Satan would come around and try and do something to your business and you just get back up again Satan would come around and try and do something to your church and you would just get back up again it doesn't matter what came your way you just kept kept getting back up how could you possibly have the strength to do that it's gonna happen brothers and sisters they're going to say how did you survive Leo decia and we're gonna say oh it wasn't us Oh Glory to God it was the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ Living out through me because his light his life Came Upon that genetic seed that was put in me before the foundation of the world just like everyone else and when that light hit that seed omnipotence happened two omnipotence came together and it became the Lord Jesus Christ manifest in flesh again on Earth it wasn't me at all there's no way that I ever could have done that I'm sure that every one of us can look back in our lives even right now today and say how did I do that how did that ever happen in my life how is that even possible but you know we know how it's possible it's the Lord Jesus Christ and you know when those things happen in our lives isn't it amazing if you look at this too I don't think I'm exclusive to this but when we have things like that that happen in our lives Satan will come around and try and get us to just like bury it in our memory as quickly as possible and then we forget about it and then time goes by and and we haven't even thought about it for so long we didn't don't even think about it like it's just you know normal that that thing happened but you know when we stand back and look at it and think wow look at that thing that happened there that was incredible how could that ever have happened it's Satan's goal to just get us so busy and so bogged down and so balled up that we just forget about the blessings in our lives brothers and sisters that song says count your blessings and name them one by one for a purpose so that we have that come to our remembrance about how Mighty a God that we serve and as much as Satan wants to try and and and and squash all of the the the the understanding and the and the present tense I am the ability to recognize God's presence in our lives we remember it and it causes something to happen in us we rejoice why in birth pains he goes on to say now notice his message never stirred them very much from their ecclesiastical sleep they just said there's a crazy man down there pass him by calls himself crazy trying to drown the people in water there you know there's people today that would say that about brother Branham about the people that try and believe the message of the hour and they would say that because we don't do it according to the mainstream theology that we baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost even though we do because whose name is that they're all titles they're all titles they're all titles of some position that someone would hold in their life potentially but they're not in a name but we know that he has come to confound the wise the wise and The Prudent the ones who are the most eloquent eloquent studied individuals that have everything figured out he's come to confound the wise and to reveal himself unto babes even those the ones that would be willing to just learn and say you know I don't know if I understand that but you know Lord I believe that you are God that you are The Great I Am present tense I am which means that right now even in this moment you could reveal yourself to me in such a way that I might be able to understand what that Doctrine means why is it such a big deal brothers and sisters the water baptism remember brother Bradham he had that trap set for him the angel of the Lord came and showed him the Chicago Ministerial Association we talked about it recently they set a trap forum and they were going to challenge him on water baptism but the angel of the Lord came and gave him the ability to go there in the moment and not be afraid and say see I told you that you were going to not have this room the way that you thought you were going to have it you didn't get that room now you've got this room and you're here to challenge me on water baptism so bring it on get your Bibles out come and stand on the stage right beside me here and let's actually duke it out according to the word show me in the Bible where it says not to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ show me in the Bible where it says to baptize in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost and where they did baptize in the name of the father and of the son of the Holy Ghost because they never have ever baptized anyone in the Bible in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost it's never happened you can't find it in the Bible in the scriptures and that's such a good one ask a theologian show me in the Bible where you can find that it's not there but just like John the Baptist there's a crazy man down there that's what they say about brother Branham the same thing the Elijah anointing not an eloquent man not a studied man not a learned man he talks in this message too about how you don't get into pulpits anymore back in 1965 unless you have some lld behind your name some some Bachelor of whatever you have to have a degree in theology to be able to preach behind a Pulpit and and talking about what a rotten place that it's gotten it's terrible to think that that's really the way it is today where did you learn where did you study I've had people say that to me where did you learn where did you study I say you know what Calgary Living Word assembly I got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of my sins and I received the Holy Ghost and you know what he just revealed himself to me through the word I just kept going to church I just let my pastor preach I just kept saying amen and the more I said amen the more that he preached the more that I learned the more studied I became it wasn't a school it wasn't a theology no it was the Holy Ghost himself the Lord Jesus Christ the spirit of Truth coming into me leading me into all truth but you know they'll say that we're heretic for it that that we're following a crazy man just like they said about John the Baptist he said there there's a crazy man down there just pass him by he calls himself crazy trying to drown people in the water see why why because he's baptizing unto repentance right setting forth the direction for the church preparing the way of the Lord according to Malachi 3 verse 1. why there's nothing to that old man why he he don't even have on the right kind of clothes he's got a sheepskin wrapped around him brothers and sisters just don't ever get caught up in the Veil goodness sakes even today we can do that maybe brother Barry doesn't wear his tie just right maybe maybe his clothes are a little tight maybe his wife cooks too good for him and and his clothes are a little bit tight and you know how could he be you know whatever don't don't don't worry about the veil don't stumble at the veil brothers and sisters see if the word that's being spoken is true when we look at a Ministry don't judge it remember what we talked about murmuring murmuring we're not murmuring against the man even though carnally will say well yes I am I'm talking about brother Paul I don't like the way he leads songs I'm gonna talk about brother Paul you know when we're doing that in a low guttural voice behind his back we're murmuring and you know what's happening is if if God has anointed him to lead songs in a congregation and we're murmuring about him guess who's who are murmuring about brothers and sisters we're we've said this before but it could be about anyone a deacon a sound technician a pastor a musician anyone our brother our sister if we're talking about them in a low guttural Town we're murmuring and if God is moving in their life then you're not murmuring about that brother or sister you're murmuring about God and what happened to the people that murmured about God it took a prophet to stand in the breach it took a profit to stay the plague and as quickly as God said you know what the day after they saw the ground open up and swallow Cora and dathan for murmuring for murmuring the day after now they're murmuring again how quickly we forget the very next day I just it blows my mind to think that in the moment God told them step aside I'm done what did the prophet do on his face him and his priest him and Aaron on their faces and while they're on their face now the prophet is speaking the word he's not actually saying why why I gotta cry out to God he's actually got the fear of God and he's able to actually speak he's able to prophesy Aaron go and get the sensors fill them with fire take the NSAIDs get in the middle of the people because the plague is on its way and how many people died in the midst there and the word says that he went and stood between the living and the dead and you know it's the same thing with a prophet for our day brothers and sisters he came and he stood between the living and the dead and he made a sacrifice for us so that we could actually have the word put in our hands we don't know the things that he went through in his life we're not here to worship him we're not elevating the man but you know what God uses a prophet to speak to his people and that's the way he does it period period And if we want to try and say that something else there's another way there's another Avenue where did it come from is it in Scripture I don't think so I think it'd be in a theological study perhaps maybe a University degree that would say there's something else but it's not according to the word because the word says the word only comes to a prophet but where the the devil will get in and say well the days of Miracles has passed the days of prophets has passed there's no more Prophets and you know there isn't really except for to Israel because there was a prophet for this age and and that Prophet rose up and and served his purpose and God took him home he didn't take him home so that he could come back and actually finish something he actually did exactly what he was supposed to do he stored up food for a season for a group of people that would have the ability to say be it unto me according to thy will according to Thy Word brother Branham says here in this message why there's nothing to that old man why he he don't even have on the right kind of clothes he's got a sheepskin wrapped around him why he's he's as poor as job's turkey why why what Seminary did he ever come out of what Fellowship card will not even cooperate in his meetings we'll just let them stay down there and starve it out can you imagine these are Christians these are the Christian Elders in the community you know someone might say well that's Brother Brad I'm saying that but I would say and I'm sure everyone else would say this is a prophet who had the ability to discern the hearts of men he was probably speaking exactly the thoughts of people remember in the message there's many messages that you can listen to where he'll say oh don't don't think that I I can tell you're thinking that I heard that I felt that many different ways he says it the world hasn't changed very much neither has it systems but we'll just let them stay down there he don't have any you you you don't you you know why he didn't remember his father was a priest he's talking about John the Baptist here remember why he was a Madman he was a a strange fella his father was a priest but why didn't he follow the line of his father which was accustomed for the children to do in those days because he had something too great a message he was to introduce the Messiah for the Holy Spirit had said so that little Remnant had been brought back by the message of Gabriel down there knew that he would be so the people knew it they knew that he would be so hey this is what the prophet's saying here so we're told about nine years old he went out to the Wilderness after losing his father and his mother that he went into the Wilderness because he had to hear exactly he had to get away from all of the all of the theological studies and all the traditional teaching and ways he had to get away from all of that because of that great big theological building there they said now I know that you're supposed to be the one to announce the Messiah Isaiah said you was coming so you are going to be that voice now don't you think that brother Jones here just meets exactly and he'd be easily persuaded but he never learned any of their systems his message was too important he went out into the Wilderness to stay I love how brother Branham just Compares it to a natural uh tense a a natural time from the past to a current Place how it could be you know wouldn't brother so and so or or or brother Sachin such wouldn't he be the perfect person for that job but he went out in the wilderness so that he could actually get rid of all of that and and and lose all of that traditional teaching remember his dad was a priest he knew the word he was raised with it and and it's interesting because the word came to him while he was still in his mama's womb the word always comes to the prophet you know in Revelations chapter 12 just speaking about the Wilderness briefly there's an interesting thought I wanted to mention here and the woman fled Into the Wilderness Revelation 12 6 the woman fled Into the Wilderness where she hath a place prepared of God that they should feed her a thousand two hundred and three score days it's interesting there's a discussion going around now that Revelations chapter 12 this discussion about the woman that fled Into the Wilderness we know that the woman is a representation of the church and we know the Wilderness is actually potentially the United States of America because when this prophecy was going forward when this was written when John was on the Isle of Patmos what was the United States it wasn't settled by anyone it was completely Wild but the woman being a type of the church had fled Into the Wilderness where she hath a place prepared of God that they should be able to just feed her for that space of time and you know if we stand back and look at it I'm not saying it is or it isn't I'm just saying it's interesting if we think about it because the very next chapters Revelations chapter 13 and the prophet clearly declares that is the USA but this whole entire nation was there raised up for a purpose so they could have freedom of religion right freedom of religion but what was the purpose of it it wasn't so they could have freedom of religion it was so that God could actually raise up a prophet in the land for the Gentile church that was the purpose of it but it's interesting to look at this scripture and think could that actually be the woman being the church fleeing Into the Wilderness North America where she hath a place prepared of God that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days it's interesting in 1933 we know it was the 17th person was being baptized on the Ohio River that Supernatural light it came down over top of God's Prophet it came down over him and it said there was a voice that spoke as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of the Lord so your ministry will forerun the second coming of the Lord we're talking about uh the same thing the same anointing just the same thing that we had in in Malachi chapter three behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple excuse me even the Covenant whom ye delight and behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts behold I said unto you Elijah the prophet he shall prepare the second coming of the Lord exactly the same thing and we know that that's happened brothers and sisters when's the Lord coming he's here don't look for a 60-foot Jesus he's tabernacled in flesh again here on Earth and and and it's in every one of us it's in the many membered body in in the bride body brother Branham came and he said in that message I can't remember which one it is now maybe the statue of the perfect man I didn't come to start an organization or an association I came to show to instruct children of God that they are the PowerHouse of the Holy Ghost the individual to raise up the individual to the place where they recognize what they are because when they recognize what they are then the Rapture will go we read that quote on Wednesday I believe man's interpretation of the word brothers and sisters what man calls great God calls foolish what God calls great man calls foolish excuse me remember the story of David Jesse he had many sons when Samuel came to anoint the the next king of Israel God gave him Direction he didn't say go anoint David he said go anoint the son of Jesse right he went there and said where's your sons Jesse because I know one of them is going to be king of Israel and I'm sure Jesse was was was excited he was so proud that one of his great boys was going to be that one and there was some with great stature he had many sons right but when David came he he was the smallest of the bunch but he was the one that God chose we know the story really well don't look at the man brothers and sisters if we look at John the Baptist he looked like a fanatic he didn't follow a theological pattern but the reason for it is because there was a change in the ministry and if we take a look at William Mary and bradham's life if if we can stand back and just do a parallel examination of his life compared to John the Baptist which is another Elijah anointing there was a change in the ministry and what it was Was preparing the way of the Lord in both cases okay and you know the interesting part when John the Baptist was actually going to prepare the way of the Lord was baptizing Jesus was alive and walking on Earth what happened with what brother Bradham you know I know that we we all know everybody knows there's a Doctrine out there right now that says that yeah there's there's Jesus has come and and the people that don't actually have this revelation of the doctrine they are lost as lost can be and you know what that's not the doctrine of Jesus Christ that's not what he's after he's calling to whomsoever Will and and he's still calling thanks be to God that he's still calling like we talked about earlier it's just his grace that keeps us going gives us the ability to live excuse me but John the Baptist was declaring the coming of the Lord so was brother Branham John was anointed to be in his position from his mother's womb so was William Branham but it was in his mother that he first met the word and that's out of Luke Luke 1 chapter 39 and Mary arose in those days and went into the Hill Country with hasten to a city of Judah and entered into the house of Zacharias Mary did and saluted Elizabeth and it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary The Babe leapt in her womb and this is beautiful because Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost even though the Holy Ghost wasn't yet given excuse me that's why brothers and sisters we don't want to put God in a box and say that I think it should be a certain way because the scripture says something a certain way and and indeed we do have to say it that way but again we need to be very careful we put God inside a box because he's Sovereign he'll do exactly what he wants to do but he'll never be contrary to his word and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come unto me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears The Babe leapt in my womb for joy brothers and sisters that was the very first word coming to this prophet in the womb it wasn't when he was standing in the water even though it was but it was a furthering of the word when he came to him in the water he said it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness now baptize me John said no way I can't do that how could I do that it's up to you to baptize me I'm not worthy to latch your shoes I said come on John we have to fulfill scripture now just let's get her done let's wash the sacrifice here right Malachi chapter 3. I'll call the musicians as we uh as we wrap this up here just just for today just as a comparison of of William Branham and John the Baptist to look at it and think that both of them were sent to forerun the coming of the Lord that's that's the reason they came John the Baptist was a bit of a fanatic and people would say William Miriam Branham was a bit of a fanatic and the only reason they would say that is maybe because he was poor maybe he didn't have good grammar maybe he didn't have a university education but you know where he really became a fanatic is when he actually just like Jesus said you know what I was just standing there when he came and and yeah it's amazing to look at it and think that we have seen the coming of the Lord in our day and many people might not agree to that many people might not understand that but I just think it's so important for us to just harp on that just talk about that because as soon as we recognize what we are then the Rapture will go that's the only promise to the Gentile Church we need to make sure that we actually live up to the scripture that there is about us in Malachi chapter 3 stand with me this morning as we as we close behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way of the Lord before me and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom ye Delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of the Lord so you have been sent to Forum the second coming of the Lord is what that voice told him as he was baptizing that day on the Ohio River and you know brothers and sisters if we go forwards isn't it interesting if you just look at that just like John the Baptist was baptizing so was the prophet today baptizing there's no difference right the same anointing here he is baptizing on the river and he gets that Commission so you will forerun the second coming of the Lord and in this scripture it says the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple where's his Temple brothers and sisters there's a lot of people looking for a temple in Israel out east and they have all the Fixins to make that Temple he's not coming to that Temple he's coming to the temple not made by hands to the soul of the believer the children of God that Temple that one that we sing about come by here my lord it's just incredible the way all this stuff comes together the Lord just vindicates his word by bringing it to pass come by here my Lord come by this Temple right here Lord not this building this building is going to burn the soul ain't and I trust yours isn't either as Believers our soul can't die it can't burn we have to lay down this flesh though every one of our flesh it's got to be laid down it will not go on I wanted to get into uh seeing God no man can see God and live there's a whole thing that we're going to talk about with that too in the future but it's just amazing how the Lord takes us and and directs our path so thankful for his leadership trust that something was said today that blesses the hearts of the Believers maybe we can just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord I pray that father if I've said anything on my own that you would just forgive me for it Lord I don't want to speak on my own I just want to speak your word I want to speak for you I just want to see your word grow in the hearts of every one of your children father I want to see your token displayed in everybody's life Lord Jesus father I want to see your token displayed in my own life I want to see the results of your token displayed in my life I don't want to just be a pretender I don't want to be a false Pretender Lord I want to see you alive in me and I'm so thankful for the instruction that we received from the prophet and and the true evidence of you alive in me is my ability to receive the word my ability to be corrected by the word my ability to be directed by the word so father as we go forwards I pray that we could just speak your word Lord we have opinions and they're irrelevant the only thing that counts is your word you have given us a messenger to forerun your second coming and Lord Jesus we acknowledge that and we accept that and we recognize it father what a tremendous blessing it is to understand where we stand when Prof your Prophet told us Lord that immediately after the coming of that prophet of that coming of Elijah that the world would be burnt over oh Father just any minute now Anything Could Happen father I pray that you would just forgive me for any sin in my life Lord let me go forwards from this meeting today myself with a Clean Heart Lord Jesus Oh father I pray that if anybody needs a a blessing from you that way if they could just reach out to you now with an uplifted hand and say Lord be it unto me according to your word maybe I haven't been able to live it the way that I want to but father I know I'm sure not what I used to be but Lord just help me to be that which you have created me to be father I just pray that you would just watch over each and every one of us Lord we don't know what time
