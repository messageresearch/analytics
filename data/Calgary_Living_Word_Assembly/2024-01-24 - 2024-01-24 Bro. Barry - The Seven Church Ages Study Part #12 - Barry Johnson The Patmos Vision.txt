[Music] amen Lord bless you all woke up real early this morning and normally I wouldn't get out of bed I'd just roll back over but I got up and started conversing with the Lord it was a beautiful time the poem came on my heart qu the manifestations of the sons of God but all throughout the day I was contemplating and thinking on that's great but how' we get there and I started looking through my older poems and this poem came on my heart it's called lightf footed and I'm sure we're all familiar with brother brandham when he talked about when he first experienced salvation and he talked about being light footed it's a good thing to read about it it's another thing to experience it for yourself so this is a poem called light footed in a world of Shadows I once walked with burdens heavy my spirit bed but then came a moment So Divine becoming lightf footed I by his grace aligned I remember when the Lord forgave me a million pounds lifted my soul set free I glanced at the heavens tears welled my eyes no longer burdened a weightless surprise like a feather drifting on a gentle breeze I floated towards home with effort effortless ease no steps were taken yet I moved so Fleet his forgiveness in my heart does beat weight of my sins now vanished and gone a broken Spirit mend it and drawn I embrace the light with every stride a forgiven sinner in his love to abide by the song of forgiveness Joy did sound Freedom's Melody my soul this does surround no longer built Bound by guilt I dance with delight light footed my spirit Soares to new heights the Lord's forgiveness a treasure told unburdened my spirit forever bold I walk towards home all cloudless days by the gift of Salvation I found my way remember dear friend when darkness looms and your heart feels heavy weigh it down by Gloom seek the Lord's forgiveness let his light be your guide and like a feather dance through life light footed in Grace always abide we're bless [Applause] you amen thank you brother Don through this week I've just been sorry just been thanking the lord for what I see in this little assembly Lord just just people like Brother Don sister Rebecca was thanking the lord for brother Jeff sister Amber different ones that the Lord's just touching and drawing back and I was praying for your brother Joe Brother Don and just know that God's not done as long as you got breath in your lungs thinking of sister Amber's brother's uh basically his testimony he said I've been praying for my sister for over 16 years and to see sister Amber and just how she loves the Lord and seeing brother Jeff and what God's doing in your life and sister brother Don sister Rebecca and and others we have loved ones that we're believing for just wonderful what the Lord is doing isn't it you just he just

praise the testimony of my lips is that there's life life has to come to the body we know brother Bram said that and so the body here it is here's his body right here there's Life coming to this body

musicians certainly nice to have the violin back God bless you brother Aiden certainly good to see the healing touch of the Lord in your family if you have your Bibles tonight I would just like to read from Revelations chapter 1 just pick up from where we kind of left off last time the exposition of the seven Church ages John in the patmas vision for the brown I'm talking about John Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated tonight just think it's such a a beautiful scripture and uh you know how John found himself in the spirit on the Lord's day and we are a type of John John being a type of the Bride how important it is for us to get in the spirit and you know we talked about it last time and I think I'll probably wind up dwelling on this for quite some time um I want to get further in the book tonight but just how important it is to get in the spirit amen and how how destructive and deceptive this world is to try and capture our attention into other avenues and other things to take our attention away from getting in the spirit and you know getting in the spirit isn't just about coming to service and getting into the spirit even though it truly is getting in the spirit is the whole of the Christian life is what brother branam said and we read that I'm not going to say it tonight but you know when we truly actually get into the spirit it's something that's revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and then it's made manifest by the results that it bears and if it doesn't get us in the spirit by the results that it Bears brothers and sisters it's not the right thing and we need to stop it and we need to look towards Jesus we need to change our direction and you know if we don't have uh a revelation about how to do that if we're not sure about how we can actually fix that the only thing we need to do is actually ask the Lord in Earnest if you genuinely ask the Lord for something he will genuinely answer you we know his word says draw nigh unto me and I will draw nigh unto you if we're willing to take that jump brother Bram said it like that little baby eagle if we're willing to take that jump he'll be there to catch us amen but we've got to be willing to make that jump and you know if we have things in our lives that we just don't seem to get Beyond or overcome and it's just an endless cycle we talked about it on Sunday it's not because the Lord wants to punish us or drag us through the knole sideways it's because he wants to see us grow and he will allow us to go through things to see that growth because the only thing he's interested in is spiritual growth he's not in our interested in our Christianity our churchianity he's not interested in how many quotes we know how long we've been in the message how long we've been around Believers he's not interested in any of that what he's interested in is our own individual walks with him and to see that we're growing spiritually because if you're not growing brothers and sisters you're dying speaking of myself here we are dying if we're not growing it's important for us to get in the spirit amen you know where we left off last last week I'll just uh I'll just pick up with paragraph 18 of the exposition of the seven Church ages is in the spirit on the Lord's day out of the patmas vision he says here it is prophesied right here in Isaiah and it came to pass about 700 years later at Pentecost when they were all filled with the Holy Ghost exactly as it was said they would be this is the true Sabbath that was promised thus when they were filled with the Holy Ghost they ceased from their worldly Works their worldly doings and their evil ways so they didn't continue on the way they used to be they actually did something different in their life and you know it's the exact same way for us today brothers and sisters it's no different for us today the Holy Ghost uh the Holy Ghost took charge of their lives they entered into rest there is your rest that is your Sabbath it's not a day nor a year but but the eternity of being filled and blessed in the holy spirit it's you ceasing and God doing it's God in you willing and doing of his own good pleasure and now when we read that brothers and sisters I I just want to maybe emphasize that that's that's speaking about us spiritually we're all aware of that I'm sure but I think sometimes it's real important to just make sure that we just talk about certain things along Ong the way um entering into a rest is not about just taking the day off and actually staying at home and putting our hands behind our head and our feet on the desk and just saying hey I've entered into my rest I've ceased from my doing and now God's going to do it for me that's not what he's saying at all what he's saying here is that we actually enter into a rest with the Holy Ghost and we spiritually stop trying to be religious we spirit spiritually stop trying to do anything spiritually speaking we humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord and then he lifts us up it is US ceasing and God doing and you know it does flow over into our natural lives it's so interesting because the Christian Life is dovetailed with the natural life and that's where it becomes so deceptive that's where the devil just loves to play Because He he'll get into our emotions he'll get into our work he'll get into our careers he'll get into our education and then try and and confuse us with the many different aspects the many different angles that we can look at it all but when we truly surrender ourselves to the Lord seek ye first the kingdom of God then all the rest of it will be added unto you when you truly surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ then you will enter into a rest and it won't matter what comes your way because you'll be able to just go forwards and do what you need to do to get it done it's you ceasing and God doing it's God in you willing and doing of his good pleasure and this you know it can get real good I'm probably not going to get too far into it tonight but you know ask what you will right we can speak the word that's the condition we live in but you know just saying it doesn't mean anything because the devil knows when we're bluffing the devil knows exactly who we are and exactly where we're at spiritually speaking and so does God and as long as we are not completely surrendered to the Lord spiritually if we have reservations if we're mucking in the world and doing different things that we know we shouldn't do then spiritually speaking we're going to be completely neutral we we'll have our transmission to neutral we can't go anywhere but boy oh boy when we get things right with the Lord and you know what sometimes brothers and sisters looking backwards does nothing all we need to do is look forwards alls we need to do is take that step towards him what can we do tonight what can we do tomorrow what can we do the next day that's what's going to make the difference that's the real Difference Maker in our lives but when we get to that place spiritually speaking it is truly us ceasing and God doing I think that's so beautiful it's God in you willing and doing of his good pleasure we won't speak anything contrary to the word and that's where I think it's beautiful when you talk about gifts if you think about gifts in the church sometimes people get uneasy about speaking in tongues and maybe screaming and shouting and getting into the spirit really getting into the spirit if we truly have the Holy Ghost we're never going to get out of order in church but it's when we don't have the Holy Ghost that we're going to be all worried that something's going to get out of order because we're not actually according to the word of God brother bam goes on to say in paragraph 19 let me make one more note about the sagittarians who claim that we meet on the wrong day of the week when we meet on Sunday the first day here's what Justin said in the 2 Century on Sunday a meeting was held of all who live in the cities and Villages and a section is read of the Memoirs of the Apostles and the writings as long as time permits when the reading is finished the president in a discourse gives an the admonition and exhortation to imitate those Noble things after this we all arise to offer common prayer at the close of the prayer as we have described Bread and Wine are placed before us and Thanksgiving made and the congregation answers amen then the elements are distributed to each one and are partaken of and carried by the deacons to the house of the absent the wealthy and willing then give contributions according to their Free Will and this collection is deposited with the president who therewith supplies orphans widows prisoners and strangers in want thus we see that those who claimed the early church carried on the judaic tradition of assembling on the last day of the week are grossly ignorant of what history actually sets forth and are therefore not worthy of confidence oh that the people might come unto him and find that rest there is a cry in the hearts for that rest but the majority doesn't know the answer so they try to steal the Cry by a religious process and I just I have that that highlighted right there still the cry by a religious process brothers and sisters don't let it be a religious process it can't be a religious process the only way it can work is to get the Holy Ghost and then it's truly us ceasing and him doing so they try to steal it by a religious process of keeping certain days or accepting denominational Creeds and dogmas so I just think this is beautiful I have looked over this many many times I've listened to it many many times and the next sentence brother Bram talks about how the worldly people do their things but first he talks about the Christians he talks about the religious ones because they try and steal it they steal the Cry by a religious process of keeping certain days or accepting denominational Creeds and dogmas it's got to come to the place where we stop doing and we allow him to do it amen well we're not looking at brothers and sisters we're not busy trying to get busy with other people's affairs what we are do is getting busy with the Lord so that when we come to service we're actually ready to see the Lord move because you know it's not the minister it's the people the gift is activated by the people when the people come hungry ready to hear from the Lord then the Lord is going to move amen he he could use a donkey to speak to man I just think it's beautiful as I've been studying this uh a little bit you know the same principle we've talked about it many many times about how the people activate the gift in the ministry the people actually activate all the gifts in the body just to be clear they out operate the gift of the song leader when we come to service if we're prayed up that's something we're going to talk about I didn't even talk about the announcements I do apologize we've got a communion coming up the end of the month which is next Sunday hard to believe and we have a prayer meeting tomorrow night but you know brothers and sisters when we come to service prayed up when we don't come to service to get prayed up when we come to service prayed up we're already in the spirit God's going to move amen we're going to actually enter into worship that's right because the worship that happens is dependent solely upon each and every individual in the building and if somebody comes into the building you know brother brandham talks about it we all know this brother Bram says that one person their misbehavior can actually take the healing from someone in a service so if we come in with the wrong attitude we might as well stay home what's the point in coming if we're just going to get in the way now there's a balance to that because you got to come to church to get Washed by the Water of the word so I trust that everyone that's here tonight has come with a purpose to hear from God we don't want it to be Creeds and dogmas we don't want it to be us doing trying to make something happening we don't want to steal the cry that was placed in our souls by a religious process of keeping certain are accepting denominational Creeds and dogmas by hanging on to Traditions by saying that this is the way that we've always done it in our lives and it can't be any different remember the children of Israel in in Exodus when they crossed over Jordan what they were told was nobody's ever gone this way before so you better listen to the word of the prophet and you better follow the Levites instructions exactly to the letter because no one has ever gone this way and brothers and sisters no one's ever gone this far in the message of the hour no one has ever gone as far as we have you talked to some of the the old-timers and they'll say you know they didn't expect to see their children grow before the Rapture would come and here we are now their children's children are having children and we're still waiting for the coming of the Lord we're looking for this Rapture to take place we need to make sure that we know where we stand amen don't try and steal the Cry by a religious process by the way we've always done it we need to actually get in the spirit and then we'll see things done that's what brother Bram said don't try and steal the the the The Cry by a religious process of keeping certain days or accepting denominational Creeds and dogmas I keep reading that on purpose brothers and sisters because I want it to saturate I want it to soak in I want us to think about the things that we do in our lives are they according to the leadership of the Holy Ghost is it being in the spirit is that the reason we do these things or is it just because we've always done it this way or that we think we should do it another way is is that what we're doing it's a religious process and we know that God's not pleased by it but then we go further with this here and brother bradam says but failing that many try drinking carousing every physical excess thinking that by worldly pleasures there can be some satisfaction but in such there is no rest they smoke and take pills to quiet their nerves but there is no rest in Earthly potions they need Jesus they need the Heavenly remedy the rest of the spirit I think it's just so beautiful it's true then the most of them go to church on Sunday that's good but even there they have no idea of how to approach God and how to worship Him Jesus said that true worship was in spirit and in truth John 4:24 and and we know we we talked about that a little while ago and we certainly will in the future I think it's such a beautiful thing but we worship Him in spirit in truth and when we have the message of the hour brothers and sisters we definitely have the truth so if we can get ourselves into the spirit we have spirit and truth and boy when those two things come together then we're worshiping God the way he wants to be worshiped paragraph 23 what kind of worship can you get in a church that knows so little of God it puts a Santa Claus at Christmas and bunnies at Easter where did they get that they got it from the pagans and made a part of the church doctrine right I have this totally highlighted this next sentence here but when one turns to the Lord and is filled with the Holy Ghost he ceases from all such things he has rest in his soul he really begins to live and love God and worship him just makes does me so good to hear Brother Bram talk like this you know I I know some people have been upset in the past about talking about the Holy Ghost all the time but that's the only thing we've got really brothers and sisters we can have a bunch of of dos and don'ts and and become a bunch of stuffed shirts and you know not see the power of God move in our midst or we can get the Holy Ghost and see the power of God we can see the Lord move not just in our church services but in our very lives when we come up against the the the sea and we've got a mountain up against our back and Pharaoh is thundering towards us we can speak the word we can call on the name of the Living God Jehovah and know that he will be there for us Amen brother Bram says now let's get back to our scripture we know what the Lord's day is not if it's not Saturday or Sunday what is it well let's put it this way today is certainly not the Lord's day this is man's day it's man's doing man's work man's Church man's idea of worship but man's everything for it is man's world Cosmos but the day of the Lord is coming it's just it is just that at this time of the revelation of Jesus Christ John was taken up by the spirit and transported by the spirit to that great day that is coming I I just want to say brothers and sisters we need to remember and not take it for granted the revelation of Jesus Christ when we can recognize it we'll get into a little bit later John recog IED The Voice he he he turned to see the voice but he actually recognized that voice because that voice wasn't someone different Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever this was the man that he walked with in Galilee this was the voice of that Nazarene that he knew it was a familiar voice and if we've ever heard that voice once in our life it is a familiar voice we'll never ever mistake that voice in our lives but it's just at this time of the revelation of Jesus Christ John was taken up by the spirit and transported by the spirit to that great day that is coming the Lord's Day is when the days of man are over and you know brothers and sisters we haven't gone and been transported in into the into the Lord's day that great day that is coming yet but sometimes we can get ourselves so Heavenly minded that we think we're there well we're not and we still have responsibility here we have to be able to be recognizing exactly where we stand that day is coming brother brandham says it that great day is coming the Lord's Day is when the days of man are over and the days of man are not over yet the kingdoms of this world will then become the kingdoms of our God the day of the Lord is when the judgments fall and after that comes the Millennium right now the world does what it wants to with the Christian they call him all manner of evil names make fun of him but there is coming that great and notable day when they will wail and howl for the lamb is coming in Wrath to judge the world that's when the righteous will have their day with the Lord for the wicked shall burn and the righteous will walk over their ashes into the Millennium I I I I've said it before but I'll just throw this visual out there if you've ever been to a volcano and seen what happens after a volcano erupts if you walk out on that lava that's all ashes brothers and sisters and anything in its way in this world gets incinerated Nothing Stops lava man does not have the ability to stop it when when the earth decides to actually push out that magma and turn it into lava nothing can stop it and anything in its way is incinerate but once it's dry once it's cool you can walk out on it and it's the most interesting thing because after a little while you'll see little tiny seeds growing you'll see little tiny Sprouts all over The Lava and and you know it it's wonderful because one time we will walk out on that on that lava I can't help but think it's just a visual for me and and one day we're going to walk out on the ashes of all of the people that made fun of the Believers and you know it's such a terrible thing because we know many people who are unbelievers who actually are good people but yet they'll mock Christianity you ever know anyone like that yeah good people but yet they do they mock Christianity it's not a healthy thing it's not a good thing and you know they're they're going to wind up in a situation where they're not going to have fun it's going to be a a terrible day but for some reason God chose us and this is where I think it's real important well we can recognize this that that there's coming a time where they're going to howl but we're going to be with him in his throne we don't have to endure that and that's where you know brother bradam he says it just this is long along in line right in line with being able to say that you can accept the word for your day is the evidence of the Holy Ghost sighing and crying for the Abominations in the land that these people are never going to be able to actually hear this word this voice that we can hear that we can recognize my Malachi 4:3 and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in that day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts and we know brother bradam he said he went and he actually saw that regions of the lost and he saidou wouldn't wish that on your worst enemy you wouldn't wish that as a human being on your worst enemy you would want to see even your worst enemy be saved and we know that that's truly the the life of a Christian because Christ would that everyone would be saved but we know that not everyone has the ability to be and we know it's election voice like a trumpet John said in Revelations 1:10 and I and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet John was in the spirit and when he was he saw a great and wonderful day of the Lord Jesus and All His holy power the future was about to unfold for God was about to teach him John did not say it was a trumpet it was like a trumpet now when a trumpet is blown it has an urgency about it it is like the hair the king's messenger coming to the people he blows on a trumpet it's an urgent call the people gathered to listen Israel was always assembled by the sounding of a trumpet amen something important is at hand listen to it so this voice had the same urgency of appeal as did the trumpet clear and strong it was startling and Awakening oh that we might hear the voice of God as a trumpet in this day for it is the gospel trumpet sounding forth the word of Prophecy to make us aware of and prepared for what is coming upon the Earth amen the command to write Revelations 1:1 saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus and unto smirna and unto pergamus and unto thyra and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto leoa the Bram he says in 28 here here it is the is here it is the first and the last Alpha and Omega that's all of it the one true God the voice and word of God this is where I think it gets it's real good for us as Believers and I say you know Lord help me I always wanted to be that way first Lord help me we have the word of God I think it was uh brother ciz that said it we have the voice of God we've got the written word we've got the voice of God but we also have the word of God in our heart and the word of God has got to be in our hearts brothers and sisters amen and the word of God that's in our heart will always lead us into truth he will always lead us correctly we will never be leted astray and if we have any question about that leadership that's in our heart all we have to do is take it back to the word see if it lines up with that word and you know what happens though brothers and sisters is we can become a little bit callous in our hearts and I remember a brother talking about it years ago he said sometimes in our lives we'll have the experience with with God we'll be so on fire with God and and you know what will happen is there will be a red flag there and that will be the limit to where we can go according to the leadership of the Lord but something will entice us to just take that step over that flag it won't matter it won't really be a big deal we'll still be able to get by with our lives and everything that's going on our jobs will be fine everything will be fine if we just step over that flag and what happens is if we step over that flag then there's going to be another flag and hey we've already stepped over one flag what's the difference we can step over another flag and you know what all the while that voice that's inside of our hearts is saying hey stop stop don't go any further don't do it but you know what every time we do it it becomes easier and easier why is that because that voice that's inside of us which is the same as the word of God which is the same as the voice of God that leadership of the Holy Ghost becomes quieter and quieter and quieter and quieter and you ask anyone that's ever stepped away from the word of God that's ever stepped away from this life a Christian walk that voice can sometimes be completely stilled and you don't hear it anymore sometimes God needs to shake us up to get us to actually hear that voice again but we have the ability to hear that voice we don't need to actually steal that voice we need to remember that that voice is given to us for a reason so that he can actually lead us and guide us but brothers and sisters he the spirit of truth will never lead us and guide us outside of his word that's why we never have to be worried about getting out of hand or getting out of control in a service because if it's the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're always going to be in order with the word here it is the first and the last the alpha the Omega the all of it the one true God the voice and the word of God reality and Truth is at hand what a thing it is to be in the spirit my to be in the presence of God and to hear from him isn't it wonderful to read this we can look at it and say you know John was in the spirit in the Lord's Day in the aisle of Patmos as our brother in Tribulation and you know the the whole book of Revelation the book of symbols it's a tremendous thing but you know what this isn't written so that we can look back and say what a wonderful thing it was for John to be there and how blessed we are to have all the revelations and to have all the seals and the Mysteries and everything figured out what what this is all about brothers and sisters is reality and Truth is at hand reality and Truth is right here now tonight in this building what a thing it is to be in the spirit right here tonight in this building this is what we're talking about this is why this is such an important book to be reading here what a thing it is to be in the spirit my to be in the presence of God and to hear from him brothers and sisters if we haven't been in the presence of God and had the ability to hear from him I want to make a request get get in the spirit get in the presence of God give him the ability to to speak to you so you can hear from him we know that that the instruction for John was what thou seest WR in a book and send it unto the seven churches the voice that sounded forth his word in the Garden of Eden and upon Mount Si which voice was also heard in the excellent glory of the mount Transfiguration was once again sounding forth and this time to the seven churches with a complete and final revelation of Jesus Christ and I know as Believers of this message of the hour we could say that voice is sounding forth again in this age and it's not just through any one Minister it's through the hearts of the children of God by the very voice of God leading his children 29 write the Visions John make a record of them for the Ages which are to follow for they are the true prophecies which must come to pass write them and send them out make make making them known and this is where I mentioned earlier John he recognized that voice didn't he he recognize this friend oh you will recognize that voice when he calls you if you are one of his own just so beautiful isn't it you will recognize that voice and if you don't recognize the voice just give it some time just wait upon the Lord and see if he won't renew your strength see if he won't actually make you mount up with wings like an eagle he he will totally make himself known the golden lampstands and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks Revelations 1:12 John does not say he turned to see the one whose voice he heard but he turned to see the voice oh I like that he turned to see The Voice how many many people have turned to see The Voice here tonight the voice and the person are one and the same Jesus is the word amen John 1 1-3 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made if you can ever get to really see the word you will be seeing Jesus and we know brother bradam says it that if you can't see Jesus in every single scripture from Genesis to Revelation go back and read it again see if God won't make that real to you you've got to be able to do that and then once you do I'll go further with it I think brother bradam even says it when you do you're going to be able to go through and read this scripture and you're going to start to see your name in there we're going to see our name in every single scripture it becomes about us the whole book being a love letter to us we don't want to get digressed here brother Bram he goes on to say when John turned he saw seven golden candlesticks actually they were lampstands and according to verse 20 they are the seven churches the seven candlesticks that thou sawest are the seven churches to represent the churches they could hardly be candles a candle burns but a while and then is burnt out it dies there would be no more to it but lampstands possess a lasting quality not found in candles if you want to get a beautiful picture of the lamp read about it we know this is Zechariah 41-6 it's beautiful how he describes this we know this is the leadership of the Lord explaining that there's only one source of the life there's only one source for that flame and it's truly that pure olive oil that's in that one lampstand feeding every single one of the church ages the scripture says in Zechariah 4 verse1 and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is waken out of his sleep and said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold and a bowl upon the top of it and it's seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts am Zechariah 41-6 and you know the story of zerubabel we we won't go too far into it because I think there's a whole bunch in there that we will get into eventually but zerubabel was a son in the lineage lineage of David zerubabel he actually was one that came back to rebuild the Temple he came back out of cap ity and was conscripted to build this Temple and we know that the Lord used him as a prophet to actually do this to accomplish it but we won't go too far with it but basically it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts and I want to say that tonight brothers and sisters as Christians as Believers of this message of the hour it's not by might it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace alone that's what it is it's it's his grace it's him doing it all from the beginning and and the end it's not by might nor by power it's not by the the amount of time we've been in the message it's not by our strength it's not by our goodness it's not by how much we give it's not by whatever we think or how we look it's all by his Spirit that's the only way that he builds his Temple is by his spirit and if we're willing to Humble ourselves unto him we'll see him do it and and you know that Temple we're talking about is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is our lives it's not a building and it's not an assembly of people it's truly the leadership of the Lord in our lives paragraph 32 here is another lamp of pure gold It Is Burning Brightly because it has plenty of oil which it's getting from the two olive trees which stand on either side the two trees represent the old and the New Testament and of course the oil typifies the Holy Ghost who alone can give the light of God to the people the angel who spoke to Zachariah was as as much as saying this what you see means that the church cannot accomplish anything by its own might or power but by the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah many times we think we can do a lot many times we get ideas and plans and schemes brothers and sisters we have to give it all to the Lord and if we're willing to Humble ourselves and take whatever it is we think and bring it to the Lord and see what he thinks about it he'll give us answer he'll lead us I think you know like we heard tonight this assembly started out with a couple of families and look at look at it today it's all the Lord there's people that step into positions and offices but it's all the lord it's all the Lord paragraph 33 now examine this lampstand you will notice that he it has a large bowl or Reservoir that is Central to seven arms that come out of it this bowl is filled with olive oil which which flows through seven Wicks which are placed in the seven arms it is the same oil that burns and makes a light at the end of the seven pipes this light never went out the priest just kept pouring oil into the bowl and I just can't help but think brothers and sisters how we need to just keep pouring oil into the bowl just just lifting up our cups and saying Lord here is my cup I lift it up just just fill it up Lord the L was lit in a special way first the priest took the fire from the sacred altar which was originally lighted by the fire of God he lit first of all the lamp that was sitting on top of the bowl he then lit the second lamp from the flame of the first lamp the third lamp received its fire from the second lamp as did the fourth receive it from the third and so on until all the seven lamps were burning this Holy Fire from the altar being passed from lamp to lamp is a wonderful type of the holy spirit in the seven Church ages how every single age lights the next age every age lights the next one it's not one just lighting every single age individually each age passes it on and lights the the next one so beautiful the original outpouring of Pentecost which outpouring came direct from Jesus on the mercy seat is in enduring his church through all the Seven Ages and showing forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the never changing God in his Essence and his ways in John 15 Jesus said I am the vine ye are the branches amen he is the main Vine that which comes out of the original root from the original seed that has the original life in it now the vine does not bear fruit it's the branches that do that the vine does not bear fruit it's the branches that do that you know it's a little bit like we talked about on Sunday you know he he's he's the inspector he's going to come by and look at the box car and shake it but he's not going to pack it and unpack it that's up to us to do he's the one that puts the seal upon it it's up to us to make sure that we're bearing fruit not him the only thing that he does is purges the branch paragraph 37 now watch this you can take a citrus tree such as an orange tree and graft it into a grapefruit limb a lemon limb a tangelo Limb and other kinds of that variety and all those limbs will grow excuse me but those grafted limbs will not bear oranges no sir the lemon limb will bear lemons and the grapefruit limb will bear grapefruit and so on yet those limbs will be thriving off the life in the tree I just want to pause there for a second and just really drill into this for a little bit brothers and sisters we need to make sure that our Creeds and our dogmas and our traditions and our constitutions all about the message of the hour line up with the message of the hour and not someone's teaching somewhere along the way because if it is someone's teaching somewhere along the way just remember whatever that teaching is is a grafted Branch into the True Vine and what will happen is that grafted Branch will bear fruit our Traditions our teachings our dogmas our Creeds all of our past behaviors they'll bear fruit and God will bless us because we'll be living off the vine but you know what if that Branch ever puts forth if that tree ever puts forth another another Branch that's a different story isn't it but those grafted limbs will not bear oranges I'll go back a little bit I'll just read from 37 now now watch this you can take a citrus tree such as an orange tree and grafted into a grapefruit limb a lemon limb a tangelo Limb and other kinds of that variety and all those limbs will grow but those grafted limbs will not bear oranges no sir the Lem limb will bear lemons and the grapefruit limb will bear grapefruit and so on yet those limbs will be thriving off the life in the tree but if that tree ever puts forth another branch of itself it will be an orange branch and it will bear oranges why because the life in the limb and the life in the trunk are identical they're not different so saying that we believe the message of the hour but living a little bit of a different life outside of church brothers and sisters it's a grafted Affair it's not the original branch and I want to say it tonight we got to be clear don't be deceived we do not want to be deceived and think because we got fruit on our Branch it's the right fruit it has to match the trunk it has to match the trunk if it doesn't match the trunk it's the wrong fruit and the devil just loves it when we have fruit doesn't he but does it match the original is it an orange because we need to be bearing oranges not lemons not tangelos not tangerines not limes none of the other fruits will count it has to be exactly according to the trunk of the tree the life in the limb and the life in the trunk are identical the life of the believer in church and the life of the believer out of church are identical whereas it wasn't so with with the grafted limbs those grafted branches had their sources in other kinds of life from other kinds of trees from other roots from other seats why do you think brother Bram is talking about this why does he even have these words in here why is God allowing the prophet to put these words in here because he's talking about the life of human beings and the teachings and and and Creeds and dogmas that people pick up and and bring with them and jump into a church somewhere and they live off the life in that church but what's happening is if if they're not bearing forth the right fruit brothers and sisters just because they've got fruit on their Branch it doesn't mean it's the right one right I think it's so amazing because this is bringing correction to us right it is it shows us that just be just because I had a Pentecostal upbringing brothers and sisters I'll put it on me tonight it doesn't mean that it's going to be right to just be Pentecostal and have a speaking in tongues every time and and and interpretations just because I had that when I was young I don't want to graft in my life I want want to take it and say Lord let my life be identical to the trunk let your life live out through me and if it is another Branch let the life come through me and Purge it in such a way that it will actually bring forth the right fruit change this Branch Purge it Lord let it be according to your will those grafted branches had their sources and other kinds of life from other trees from other roots from other seeds oh they will bear fruit all right but they won't bear oranges they cannot because they are not the original that's the way the church is the vine has been split and limbs have been grafted in they have grafted in Baptist limbs Methodist limbs Presbyterian limbs Pentecostal Limbs and I'm just going to say whatever limbs that you can think of have been grafted in around the message some people have legalistic limbs some people have liberal limbs you you whatever the limbs are graft them in and they'll live and they'll bear fruit but what's the fruit is it the fruit of the spirit because if it's not the fruit of the spirit that's what we really want to talk about tonight we could say you got to have oranges we can run to the store and buy a bag of oranges but go buy a bag of the fruit of the spirit see if you can do that you can't it's got to be his life living out through us and when it is his life living out to us it will bear record of the word because it's identical to the the trunk that's the way the church is the vine has been split the limbs have been grafted in they have grafted in Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal and those limbs are bearing Baptist Methodist Pentecostal Presbyterian fruit denominational seeds from which they produce their fruit but if that vine ever brings forth another branch of itself that Branch will be exactly like the vine itself I think it's so beautiful to see that brother brothers and sisters because this is not talking about trees it's not talking about fruit that hangs on the tree it's talking about the Christian Life it's talking about the life of a Believer are our lives lining up with the word of God are we producing are we seeing him produce the fruit of the spirit in our life remember brother Ken preached that so good it's not fruits it's not plural it's one fruit and there's different aspects of that one fruit but we have to have all of it in our lives amen we've got to see that fruit of the spirit in our lives and you know if we don't I'm not here to scold you I'm here to encourage you get that fruit right ask him to purge the branch that he would bring forth that fruit my but if that vine ever brings forth another branch of itself that Branch will be exactly like the vine itself amen it will be the same kind of branch that it was brought forth at Pentecost it will speak in tongues prophesy and have the power and signs of the resurrected Jesus Christ in it don't be afraid of gifts we don't want to be afraid of gifts we want healing and we want good church but brothers and sisters speaking in tongues is one of the gifts of the Spirit Hallelujah discernment is one of the gifts of the Spirit being able to actually see people get saved is what we're after don't be afraid of gifts in our midst that's truly the spirit of Christ but you know the pendulum swings both ways sometimes people are all about the gifts and then you go to the other side sometimes people are so afraid of the gifts because people on the other side make it such big thing that's the only thing they're after but right down the middle of the road brothers and sisters remember there will be a highway but there's also a way and that way will be a way unto Holiness and that Holiness is going to be exactly according to the word because the word is exactly like the trunk isn't it Hallelujah if that vine ever brings forth another branch of itself that Branch will be exactly like the vine itself the believer today will be exactly like the Believers in the book of Acts there will be another book of Acts written behind them because they'll be the same it's the exact same life it's the exact same bowl of oil it's the exact same Wick it's the exact same flame that flame was lit from another age it's the exact same word it can't be any different it will be the same kind of a branch that was brought forth at Pentecost it will speak in tongues prophesy and have the power and signs of the resurrected Jesus Christ in it why because it's thriving on the natural resource es of the vine itself you see it wasn't grafted into the vine it was born in the vine when those other branches were grafted in all they could do was Bear their own fruit for they were not born of that vine I just think that's so beautiful that's what happens to us if we don't actually humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord if we don't humble ourselves to the word of God to the message of the hour then what happens is we just produce the fruit that we've always had that's the only thing we can do that's the only thing we are is grafted in but boy oh boy when we get born again brothers and sisters that's what he's talking about here when we truly get born in to this word when we get born again we're born into the vine it's not grafted into the vine we get born into the vine when that happens when those other branches were grafted in all they could do was Bear their own fruit for they were not born of that vine they didn't know about that original life and original Fruit they cannot know for they were not born of it but if they had been born of it that same life that was in the original stem Jesus would have come through them and manifested through them isn't it beautiful how he just keeps saying the same things revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word made manifest by the results that it Bears hey I I if it was the same life that was in the original stem Jesus it would have come through them and manifested through them it's not going to manifest a different life we're going to have that fruit of the spirit that's the fruit that's going to be hanging on our branches John 14:12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also the Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father he goes and splits himself and allows himself to be distributed back on the church again denominations which are man directed cannot be born of God for God is the spirit not man that gives life I said that wrong remember we can have a denomination of one we can have our own ideas and say this is exactly how it's got to be it's got to be exactly like this this is my my idea my belief and unless it's exactly like this then everything else is wrong we can have a denomination brother Bram he said says denominations which are man directed cannot be born of God for it is the spirit not man that gives life how thrilling it is to think of those seven lamps drawing life and light from the resources of that Main Bowl because they had their Wicks dipped therein each Church age you know I just I got into this it's kind of like a a honey pot you get into it and it's just sweet I I just was thinking about how those Brothers was it sharen I can't remember who it was someone here probably knows the brothers that that brother Bram he told him he said go down there into Kentucky and get that oil there's a great big Reservoir down there go get it and they stall they said oh no you know whatever whatever whatever but then they started to hear Rumblings about it there's something going on down there there's a play and and and they asked him they said to him you know help us help us and he said no no way this is not for Commerce I told you to go down there and you decided not to you know I just can't help but think as we're reading this brothers and sisters when I was studying this thinking you know we've been given the instruction to get to that Main Bowl to that main gusher we don't have to actually just get into one of the the little ponds of oil and hopefully you know be stingy with it and hope that it doesn't run out we can tie right into that Main Bowl if we're willing to follow the words of the Prophet for our day how thrilling it is to think of those seven lamps drawing life and light from the resources of that Main Bowl because they had their Wicks dipped therein each Church AG messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the Holy Ghost am his Wick life has been immersed in Christ though that Wick through that Wick he is drawing the very Life of Christ and by it gives out light to the church what kind of a light is he giving the very same light that was in the first lamp that was lit isn't that beautiful Satan wants us to think that it's going to be some other light it's going to look different it's going to feel different it'll be something different but here we have God speaking through the prophet saying it's exactly the same light brothers and sisters exactly the same light exactly the same light that was in that burning bush that Moses saw exactly the same light that was in that Pillar of Fire that protected the children of Israel between pharaoh and his army exactly the same light that led them through the Wilderness exactly the same light my goodness so beautiful the very same light that was in the first lamp that was lit and right on down the ages to the present time of this last day messenger the same life and the same light is manifested by a life that is hid with Christ in God you know I remember hearing about someone they said to someone one time you know you just have a real special light about you and uh isn't that the life of a Christian they just have a light people can see the light in your eyes brothers and sisters I heard about it today I don't know if anybody saw uh uh a message that was posted but I I watched a sermon from another brother and he was talking about beyond the curtain of time and I'd never heard about it before but brother brandham says there's something about the eyes of the Believers on the other side the way they look at you with their eyes are different when brother ran and went beyond the curtain of time and uh it really is the window to the soul isn't it and that's where we can see who's who in the zoo when we meet people we shake their hands we can say God bless you with a big smile but are we smiling truly on the inside of our hearts in our souls the the the eyes reveal something to you you know sometimes people won't even look at you that is they won't even look at you they'll just give you a hand and just not even say a word shake your hand what's that saying my paragraph 42 how much time do we have here 4 minutes not I'll call the musicians so I don't keep us too late not only can we speak thus of The Messengers but every True Believer is dramatically depicted here are you depicted here they are all drawing from the same Source they have all been dipped into the same Bowl they are dead to themselves and their lives are HID with Christ in God they are sealed with the Holy Ghost and we know this is Ephesians 4:30 we read this on Sunday and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption you know the word of God says that we're already seated in Heavenly places amen this flesh is going to sin your soul never can if you've accepted Christ and you have been baptized you've received the gift of the Holy Ghost in your life your soul can never sin brothers and sisters never you're sealed till the day of your Redemption but this flesh is going to sin and the devil's going to come around and say to you look what you did look what you said look what you thought look what you didn't do the devil's going to come around and try and make us think that we're not sealed but you know what the word of God says that we are so we need to just choose whose report are we going to believe are we going to believe the report of the Lord or are we going to take take take what the devil's got to hang on us brothers and S SS don't look at your flesh your flesh is going to perish we've got flesh and I know I look at my flesh and I've got scars all over it and I've got things in this flesh that I really don't like and you know sore Parts in my body now that I'm over 50 and you know what this flesh is going to perish this flesh is not going to inherit eternal life it's the soul that's on the inside of me and the character that's inside that Soul that's what's going to inherit eternal life don't look at this flesh he goes on to say no man can pluck them out of his hand and their lives cannot be tampered with the visible life is burning and Shining giving light and manifestations of the Holy Ghost the inner invisible life is hidden in God and fed by the Lord's word am Satan cannot touch them not even death can touch them for death has lost its sting the grave has lost its Victory thanks be unto God they have this victory in and through Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let's stand tonight as we close in prayer I think that's just so beautiful isn't that beautiful the invisible life is hidden in God and fed by the Lord's word my let's just bow and PR prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we love you and we thank you for your word Lord thank you for giving us ears to hear what the spirit saith to this this church Lord to this church age thank you Lord Jesus that we have the ability to actually be lit with the flame from the prior Church age Lord to know that father there's got to be someone that actually fulfills the scripture that in a moment in a twinkling of an eye oh we shall be changed father that there will be some people that will come and meet you in the clouds father first we'll meet together with all those people whom maybe we've lost who have gone ahead before us Lord the other people on the other side of the world the Believers from everywhere from all the ages we'll meet with them first oh Lord and then we'll gather together and meet with you in the cloud someone has to fulfill that scripture and Lord we're just so thankful that whether we go by
