hospital to go home it's a tremendous leap I want to continue to remember the risler family and Mark was on life support and unresponsive Whistler family at this time Alsina uphold brother Frank Cronkite and family brother Isaiah and his family and if you have a need let's just make it known unto him tonight Grace is just Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we love you and we thank you we just ask Lord that one more time we could approach your throne of mercy and Grace and father we don't want to ever treat you like a vending machine Lord father we want to thank you for the many blessings in our lives Lord Jesus father you meet our needs so many times so many ways father so many times that maybe we don't even comprehend or recognize and father we just ask that you would forgive us father for not acknowledging those times Lord forgive us for not giving you the praise and the glory Lord we know so many times maybe even when we're driving or walking or flying oh Lord so many things could happen to us but you prevent them because your bride is in the midst father we thank you for your tender hand of Mercy Lord Jesus tonight we just thank you for touching Kristoff Lord in the family Lord we pray that you would just continue to move in his life Lord that they would continue to have a testimony of your grace that you are the same yesterday today and forever the days of healing has not passed but they are very present oh Father especially in a time of trouble father we love you and we thank you we just want to remember the other requests that were made known father all the uplift hands tonight father each one has a need father and you know the need father you know the beginning from the end and we thank you for meeting that need Lord according to the faith that caused that hand to raise unto you tonight Lord father will be careful to give you all the praise Lord Jesus we just want to remember Isaiah Lord that you would just continue sending your Angel by his way father Lord that there would be a testimony of your grace to that family Lord Jesus to that boy it's not right for a boy of that age Lord but we know there was a time there was a boy in the Bible he had a spirit like that and they brought him unto you father and you cast out that devil and father we know that we brought that boy unto you this day father and we know that you will cast out that devil as well father we thank you for touching him in Jesus name Lord Jesus we thank you for continuing to watch over brother Frank Cronkite Lord and the Cronkite family we know that you work out all things to the good to those who love you to those who are called according to your purpose Lord and father your servant is in touch of an in need of a touch from you father so we just commit him into your hands Lord in the name of Jesus father we just want to remember the rizzler family Lord knowing there's times where we don't know what to do father where there's nothing that we can do except trust you and that your will is the perfect will for our lives Lord and father we just ask that you would lead them and guide them as they make decisions Lord If It Be Your Will for that boy to raise up from that bed then so be it in Jesus name and if it Be Your Will for him to go home father lord it's not up to us to say we just want to trust you father all along the way because we know that you have everything under your control we just that you would give the risler family just an extraordinary uh strength at this time father that the parents would be able to make decisions as they move forward Lord that would benefit the family oh Father we love you and we thank you we all have needs in our lives and we just ask Lord Jesus that one more time you would come by here and that you would just speak to us Lord father that wouldn't be a just a gathering of a church group Lord but it would be your bride having an upper room experience once again on a Wednesday evening father Lord that you would just divide yourself sovereignly in our midst father that we could just hear from you Lord we just love you and we thank you and we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight thank you musicians if you have your Bibles I'd just like to read from Matthew chapter 5. are you happy tonight God bless you brother Marvin it's good to have you here it's wonderful to see when folks are traveling and they have the desire to be in the house of the Lord Matthew 5 verse 43 it's kind of a different angle tonight I want to continue speaking about our roles our positions but uh we'll just read here in Matthew 5 43. ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect let's just turn over to Hebrews chapter 6. Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the Dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we know that your word is true and all heavens and earth will pass away but only your word will remain father tonight we pray that you would just magnify this word to us Lord that you would amplify it to our souls Lord Jesus father that that's what we would be dwelling on as we endure this service tonight father and as we go forwards this week father that you would just be speaking to us through this word that we read tonight we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I just uh sometimes have a real struggle coming to church and thinking about how we could ever have as good a service as we did on Sunday on Wednesday and sometimes a Wednesday service I think about it how could we ever how as good a service on Sunday as we had last Wednesday and uh you know I know for sure on my own there's no way that would ever happen I'm certainly thankful that he's faithful tonight I want to talk about our roles and uh you know we've read extensively um out of the book of Ephesians we could potentially turn there might as well still have a few minutes Ephesians chapter 5 just as a reminder talking about the roles of the family roles of the husband roles of the wife or the role of the husband the role of the wife the role of the children in Hebrews chapter 6. but really um I'll just read verse 31. for verse 30. 31 and 32 of Ephesians chapter 5. for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones I just want to say how are we members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones anybody see Jesus body or his flesh or his bones we don't see it verse 31 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverends her husband and we know that chapter 6 goes right into children obeying their parents because this is right honor thy father and thy mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee that thou mayest live long on the Earth new fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord what we're talking about here is being the children of the Lord Jesus Christ but I would say it's even more beautiful we can look at it and say yeah we are Sons and Daughters of the most high God but there's some that are the Bride of Jesus Christ there's some that are the wife and you know it's a difficult thing but it's true the husband and wife relationship is a lot more intimate than the parents to the children and there's a lot of children but there's only one bride you can have many children but there's only going to be one wife if you're living your life according to the word you know tonight talking about our scripture and Perfection I just want to read this quote and uh brother says it and I don't know if you want to bring it up brother it's out of uh 54 1203 the law having a shadow it's paragraph 23 and so is every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God it isn't you become changed there's something about you that something has moved in made you a different person you look on life different you look at things different it isn't you that's bubbling it's something within you pushing it out it's Christ pushing out the testimony and the life and it all comes back to Christ the law having a shadow of things to come could not make the comer perfect what's the subject Paul speaking of here perfection God requires perfection and there's no way that we're ever going to be perfect the only way that we're ever going to try and make ourselves perfect let me say it this way I don't say it right if we try and make ourselves perfect brothers and sisters then we're doing it Cain's way Cain tried to make himself perfect but if he would have just done like his brother which is what God gave him he didn't have the Revelation Abel was given the Revelation but Cain was corrected but that thing inside of him Pride just wouldn't accept that correction it just couldn't receive it there was nothing inside of him to be able to receive that correction but boy isn't it wonderful we can go to a service and we know that God speaks to us through the the pulpit whoever it is that's preaching sometimes we hear I hear it and it just it blows me away I'm so thankful for it because there's times where as a minister you can get down thinking how can I possibly be bringing things week after week and and it's going to help the people but then you have somebody say you were talking about our conversation last night till midnight you weren't there with us but we know who was and it's at that point I think Lord thank you because there's no way I could ever do it not myself but what we're talking about is Christ Living out through the believer having his life bubbling out through us he says what's the subject Paul's speaking of here Perfection God requires perfection no one could ever come to Heaven outside of being perfect now let's talk about our roles brothers and sisters we've got to be perfect in our roles in our positions how are we ever going to be perfect husbands how are we going to be perfect wives how are we going to be perfect children it's a mystery but you know brother Branham says the mystery is history because that book became a new book when them seals were opened when all of them were opened and what it did was it allowed us to see that we are no longer children tossed to and fro with every slide of men in the cunning craftiness of the devil but what we are is rooted and grounded in love we have the Holy Ghost living out through us quickening this word to us that's fully open and we can say wow I recognize the only way I'm going to be perfect is to align myself completely with God's word and that's that's that's the only way that I'm going to be perfect but there's no way that I'm ever going to be able to do it myself I can't go to church enough I can't pay enough tithes I can't sing enough I can't play enough I can't do enough for the people in the community I can't do enough the only thing I can do is surrender but boy brothers and sisters when we can surrender ourselves one to another in the fear of God submitting ourselves one to another in the fear of God boy then we're getting somewhere then we're willing to say there's nothing inside of me that won't mix with that word when it comes I don't have pride getting in the way of that word when it comes to me but but here we have brother Brad I'm saying what's the subject Paul speaking of here Perfection God requires Perfection no one could ever come to Heaven outside of being perfect now sit still just a minute look perfect you must be perfect and yet the scripture says not as perfect so if you must be perfect to come to heaven then and the scripture says None is perfect and we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God how are we ever going to enter God's living place and Dwelling Place when he requires perfection I think he just he says it so clearly how are we ever going to do it Jesus said I Believe In The Sermon on the Mount he said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect think of the Perfection that God requires of the person a Perfection this is in 1954 the law having a shadow but if we go back a little bit in this in in this scripture that we read the first one we read tonight out of Matthew chapter 5. you know brother uh Jesus here given The Sermon on the Mount what he's talking to the people saying to to love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven and he just the way he explains it here he doesn't leave any room for doubt there's no room for any negotiation about it we need to love our enemies brothers and sisters how much more our husbands how much more are wives how much more ought we as children to obey our parents but the only way we're going to have perfection in our lives is Christ to himself being perfect in us we can have perfect hair we can have perfect clothes we can have a perfect house we can have a perfect career we can have a perfect Investment Portfolio and all of it is going to burn all of it is for naught the only thing that's going to last is the spirit of Jesus Christ Living out through us that's the Perfection that he's looking for brothers and sisters came he had a works-based religion if we're we're dealing with Works brothers and sisters who are missing it but you know some people will say it fake it till you make it that's a business World thing just get up and go and and do and keep going and eventually it might happen and you know what it might happen if you do that but really the only thing that's going to happen is to surrender it's complete and total surrender and tonight how does that apply brother Berry to the roles in the family is it's surrendering to the to the roles in the family according to the word of God and understanding that the only way we're going to be perfect is to align ourselves with God's word 100 percent we can't say I've got a we said it on Sunday I think we did anyways we can't say that we've got a cultural thing or something from my culture there's something from my family I've got a tradition that just keeps me you know gives me Liberties so to speak in in the message it allows me to have a temper it allows me to have bitterness or unforgiveness I can't say that that's acceptable I would never say that and and neither can anyone according to the word of God we've got to forgive we've got to forgive our enemies how much more our husbands and our wives and sometimes things actually can just get swept under the rug I don't even know I'm talking like this tonight but I I guess it's just the will of the Lord and we'll just go with it but our position sometimes we we can read it we can see our position sometimes in the word of God and I just can't help but think about like a a job sometimes we get a job we get offered a position in a company and we go to that company and we work in that company and we can have a a really well-defined laid out job description and sometimes it doesn't make sense to us really we can read it and say well I understand it but until we actually see how that fits inside the company it can seem a little bit nebulous a little bit unsure but once we get going then it can become clear and sometimes that's what we need to do is get into a position and be able to see what it actually is and I know this for sure when people will describe getting married it seems to be such a tremendous thing for those people who have never been married it's still a tremendous thing for those who have been married don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't think I'm going wrong with that I'm not but you know when we're when we're looking at getting married and we're maybe uh engaged and we're going down that road we we think about all the different ways that we will explore marriage and and where we will live and and the dreams start to grow and and our lives we we can see the the life maybe forming on the horizons and you know sometimes when we get into our positions as a husband and a wife it doesn't always line up the way that we think that it will when we have those Visions before we actually get married sometimes we think that we're gonna have like a perfect night's sleep every single night but you know it doesn't work that way when you have children when you have children that sleep cycle completely flips upside down for the husband and the wife probably more so for the wives but that's how it is there's different things that happen in our lives they they change but sometimes we don't see those things in our position in the job descriptions that were given sometimes the job description is is just is just difficult to understand until you actually get on the job but it doesn't mean that we're wrong doesn't mean that we're doing things out of order we just need to go back to that job description and say am I doing things according to what I agreed to do to the for the company for the boss if I am then that's great but if I'm not then why aren't I we need to kind of go back and recalibrate and say what's going on sometimes in a marriage we need to do that according to the word of God we need to step back and say you know the cares of Life have maybe gotten in the way and I might have had so many other things going on I just got a little bit cloudy with what my job description was according to the role in in my family but you know sometimes we can get so many things going on we can just forget what the original job description is sometimes when we work for a company we could be doing way more than what our original position called for because we just know these things need to happen and instead of trying to go and ask someone can you get someone to do this and get someone to do that it's easier just to get it and do it and have it done and then know that you can get on with what your task is sometimes that's just how it is and you know that's the same thing in a marriage the same thing in a relationship we just sometimes need to just do things that way I I had it said one time that you know what happens is the employees in a company what they will do is actually pick up the slack so that the whole team goes together and you know we can do that in our lives as brothers and sisters in the church we can do it as a family as husbands and wives as parents with children as children even for parents we can pick up the slack for one another instead of trying to point out that someone isn't doing something we can just go and do it for them and try and encourage them and let them know hey you know what that's done you don't have to worry about it that's what happens when you're on a team sometimes the original job description can just get a little bit muddy or or maybe forgotten maybe just a little bit cloudy a little bit foggy maybe we just forget a little bit about the original description of our jobs but that's why I think it's so beautiful when we can say you know we have an absolute and that absolute is the word of God and what excuse me when we have that boy we have the ability to recalibrate ourselves and and you know when we have that ability to see something that maybe isn't right maybe something is wrong then we can just humble ourselves to the word of God ask him to forgive us and you know he'll say don't worry about it just go make it right with that other person though go and make it right with that other situation though and when we do that then we can just go on in our positions I think it's so beautiful but you know he has given us a position in his word and and tonight we're not just talking about families I I know the roles of families are are wonderful the topic is beautiful but the hour and the season in which we're in brothers and sisters is our role in Jesus Christ that is really where we're at and and if we can just continually hold that before the people before the church before our eyes even myself just continually remind ourselves that's really what our position is and and our position is in him and and his will for us for each one of us is his word remember that his will is his word if we ever have a doubt about what our uh we should be doing what our our position is where we're at it's his word we were talking about this in in the back on Sunday and I think it's such a beautiful topic it's something I know the Lord made so magnified and real to me in my life our our lives are are a combination of things Journeys that we go on but our our our careers and and our church and and our families everything that we do is not his will per se it's not a destination I'm sorry I'm wording it wrong our our his will is not a destination that's what I'm trying to say it's not something we're going to achieve we're not going to say God God wants me to be a doctor so it's his will for me to be a doctor maybe it is and maybe it isn't but what his will is brothers and sisters is as we go along the way to be a doctor is for us to practice his will in our lives I hope I didn't make that completely confusing I almost confused myself there I apologize but you know I I had that that struggle for a long time I heard brother Ken say it and and it's exactly according to the message of the hour and I think it's so beautiful because God made it so tremendously real to me his will is his word and we do want to pray for his will in our lives do you want me to go to university Lord because I want to be in your will do you want me to go to a trade school do you want me to move to another location do you want me to do this or that and and everything that we do we want to do it unto the Lord is what the word says but you know the Final Destination isn't his will his will is that we apply his word every step of the way that's his will and I I had asked the Lord for that when I struggled with it I just didn't understand it um I didn't reject it but he showed me take a look at Joseph in his life and take a look at Daniel in his life Joseph he just applied the word he just was he was completely brutalized taken advantage of mistreated but it was all for a purpose but all the way along he never mistreated the word in his life he applied the word in his life and what happened to him he was a type of Christ we know brother Branham said that very clearly in the Bible same thing with Daniel when Daniel was there he he was carried away into captivity he and the others were in the king's chamber and they could have eaten the meat from the king's table they could have drank the King's Wine they had the finest of of everyone in the land they had the king's Fair but they knew that that was against their law because that meat was sacrificed unto Idols before they ate it they knew that wine was not good wine according to their tradition they could have had it though it was the best everyone in the country probably would have had it I think I remember here hearing it preach once upon a time that you know the others who were held killed carried away in captivity they probably would have taken it but not these guys because they believed Daniel was a Believer he was being perfect according to God's word he was applying the word of God and it wasn't something that he was trying to do he wasn't living a Cain's religion he was just living his life because that's who he was and we know that he did not get to see the restoration though he prayed for it though he was there contending for it the restoration of the temple he did not get to see it he lived his entire life there in in in captivity anyways I'm going off on a complete tangent about it I apologize his will is his word every step of the way brothers and sisters it's not just a destination our destination is heaven it's not a place on Earth but our position all along the way is in his word and and you know concerning our positions our positions are in the word but I just think it's so beautiful how you know in the book of Ephesians how Paul speaks about it to the to the church and you know how brother Branham he talks about it very clearly that the book of Ephesians parallels Joshua Joshua parallels Ephesians and we can look at all of the different things in the book of Ephesians and you know before we can become Mighty Warriors in the word of God in the book of Ephesians we've got to get on our positions many people want to put on the whole armor of God we've talked about this in the past but first we need to get in our positions how can we put on the whole armor of God if we're not being a good husband if we're not being a good wife if we're disobeying our parents we're not going to be able to put on the whole armor of God the way that we would want to the way that God would want us to but boy when we get into our position then the devil knows that we are in our position and that's when he's going to back up that's when he's going to flee that's when he's going to know that we mean business I think it's a beautiful thing because when we get to that place brothers and sisters that's where we can start to declare that I and my father are one where we recognize that his word is our absolute it's our Anchor Point nothing can shake us from it there's nobody that can come around and say there's this great mystery in the message and someone has an angle on it or somewhere someone is doing something different we know that the word of God says you know when they say he's out in the desert don't go out after him no no no don't be moved by the the cunningness of men teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men don't do that you know we we've heard about it I'm sure that everyone has and if you haven't I'll mention it it's a it's it's a it's a sick thing that the the message of the hour has been infiltrated in Kenya and and many places in the world but now there there's people it's so terrible people saying that it's the message of the hour and you know what the message of the hour will never ever be infiltrated but it's the people who are claiming to propagate behind the message of their hour they're using it for a front so that they could actually achieve their own goals and we know it's it's doctrine of devils but they had a starvation thing and they put it on the news and a guy got arrested and I don't know how many people died they starved themselves to death according to this message of the hour is what they're calling and some of these people who are ex-message believers they've got a table and and they're showing all of the different message books that that were William Miriam bradham's material and they're saying that this is his fault and this is what he did it's a lie of the devil and I know I'm I'm I'm I'm talking to Believers here I'm not trying to justify it we don't have to justify it God will justify his own word God will vindicate his own word but the people who are uh talking about this I I was more surprised actually about the people who are talking about it than than what was actually happening there because we know that many people when they get too close if they don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost what will happen is they will just burn up they'll just turn into a fanatic and they'll act funny about it you know and when we get the true baptism of the Holy Spirit what it does when anybody gets the true baptism Holy Spirit you just line up with the word of God you don't go funny you don't say that William Mary and Bradham gives you Liberties to do things that's outside of the word that's a devil that says that but there are a group of people that have the ability to say I am my father are one and how does that happen it's not great Fantastics it's not great Fanatics it's just simply taking him at his word and saying be it unto me according to your word and and if we have to take correction according to the word we gladly receive it because we know that if we can't receive it the word of God says that we're a bastard child we don't have a father if we can't receive correction by the word but boy when we can receive correction by the word it brings such a peace it brings such a rest it shows us that there's an anchor to our soul you know brother Brown and we I brought this quote last time I think um I'll just read it quickly and then I'll get in I'll push a little further ahead here brother Brad I'm out of questions and answers he says please explain people are saying brother Branham is more than a man he can create Jesus can look just like brother Branham now let me the person said this whoever it might be I don't know but I am your brother see Jesus is your savior I cannot be your savior for he has already saved you Christ if anybody were to ever just not go to Google and just listen to what William Marion Branham said and then just cross-reference it with the Bible they would have to say the same thing wow he just points to Jesus Christ he's not a fanatic but it takes a bit of effort he says now you're so close to being the truth there and yet so far from the truth the person that told this person this now it's just looks to me it's a woman's Hound rate very very beautiful handwriting and I'd say that's a woman's hand right wouldn't you brother Capps wouldn't you think that was a woman's handwrite pretty hand right and I know who who it is see brother Branham could Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or something like that here we have the prophet of God saying this one sense of the word that's exactly truth another sense of the word is an antichrist that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist and isn't it so true brothers and sisters that it is Razor Edge thing it gets that close so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible and and it takes it takes a level of Faith that's kind of beyond our comfort zone to really understand what he's saying here if we just Rely Upon Our traditional teachings and and theories that we've been given um I've seen it said this way and and I'll just say it this way you know when a child is born and he comes into a Catholic Family parents will say this is your religion this is it right here take it it's good if someone's born into a Pentecostal family it's no different if it's a Baptist Family it's no different if it's an Anglican or or a Methodist or a presbyterian it's still the same here's your religion this is what we believe right and and the children will take it and you know what that's the way families work and that's why the church has so much hold in people's lives and you know brothers and sisters friends and neighbors anyone who's listening I'll say it loud and clear it's the same thing with the message of the hour we hand it to our children and we say here this is what we believe this is the religion that we believe but we don't stop there we say the only way that that's going to actually come to life and have any value for you in your life is for you to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit yourself it has got to be your religion your way with God it's got to be your own personal relationship and if the other religions would do that would say that you truly need to receive the word of God you need to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit according to the word for your day you would get the Holy Ghost also but it's got to be the word for your day it can't be the word for another day I don't want to try and live under the Revival of Azusa Street that's a wonderful thing but it's like trying to say I want to live under the Revival of the upper Upper Room experience which one is more powerful one that's a hundred years or one that's two thousand years it's the quickening power brothers and sisters it's it's no less diluted or or weak today it's just as strong as it was in both of those occurrences but you know brother Brad I mean says this here for the person of the Lord Jesus Christ for me to be the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist see for that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high and will come again in great power and Glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him it's exactly the truth and you become Christ and that's very simple formula brothers and sisters when we eat the book we become the book and we know we've said it extensively Revelations 10. not one to seven but eight to eleven one to seven has happened and we said amen to one to seven but now what we need to say hey eight to eleven applies to someone someone needs to eat that book and go and prophesy again before many nations people's tongues and kings you know for years and years it was to be like Jesus wasn't it we sing that song to be like Jesus to be like Jesus I don't know the whole song but we know we sing that song we we had that for many years many people want to be like Jesus some people will try and dress like Jesus some people will try and Live Like Jesus but you know what we want to do is just be who we are and allow him like we've already read in that quote to be perfect is just to let his life live out through us but the only way that can happen is to receive the word for our day but for years and years it was to be like Jesus and now it is to be Jesus but we're not going to say we're going to worship any man there's no man on Earth that's ever going to get worshiped brothers and sisters the Believers I know we all believe this that we worship Jesus Christ and that's the only one that we worship we worship him because the word of God even says no man comes unto the father but by me but by Jesus Christ but today with the message of the hour today when we receive the word for our day when we take the book and eat it just like John was commanded to do when we do that how do we do that we take the message of the hour and we say Amen to it we say yeah but I believe it and you know you can't say you believe it until you believe it I wouldn't want anyone to say they believe it if they don't believe it that's where we become hypocrites we need to be able to believe it but we have to look at it that's the only way we can see whether we'll be able to believe it but when we do actually receive the message when we do actually believe the message then our position isn't by Christ it's not like Christ it's in Christ we become a new creature in Christ Jesus and how does that happen if we don't have Christ Jesus living out through us I so appreciated how we heard it on Wednesday night last week I feel like I'm doing it even a disservice you know the son of man Ministry is on the Earth right now and that son of man Ministry is Jesus Christ himself living out through men and women who believe this word for their day it's a uniting Time brothers and sisters and so I'm sure you can tell I'm going to get into 1963 the uniting time and sign brother Branham in paragraph 90 he says also while all this uniting of the nation these signs National signs we see out here in the world earthquakes and diverse places different things uniting bringing the world together bringing the people together all the churches together all these things and while all this uniting unitings going on there's another uniting that's going on Amen and that's what I want to point to you now in this message he gets right into it and uh we can't really do it justice tonight but it is a uniting time and and there's so many uniting signs going on I I just I was grieved and I know I've talked about it you know how the Abominations in the land There's the Man clothed in linen that's instructed to walk through the city with the acorn and put a mark on those set a mark on those who are sighing and crying for the Abominations in the land you know the uh just looking at the world today I I just couldn't help but have that burden to to to sigh and to cry within myself thinking look at how it is there there's so many different things I could list off things but there's no point but just to recognize really the uniting and and and and the signs of it all around us brothers and sisters but I can't help but think I just have this comparison you know I had talked about how the the light is compressing the darkness has anybody ever seen a fire piston you know what I'm talking about nobody I had just learned about it myself in uh it's a survival tool and it's a cylinder just a little thing it's about that big and it's usually made out of wood and what it is it's a it's a cylinder with a cap on the end of it and it's got a hole it's a tube and then there's another piece that is like a stick with an end on it and and it fits perfectly inside that cylinder and and what happens is you you take a little bit of a uh something like sawdust or something and you put it in there and you fit it inside there and it's really tight you can't really just slide it in there because it's airtight but if you go pop what happens is the air inside there squishes it compresses so tightly it will actually ignite that little piece of sawdust or whatever you put inside there the fire piston I just can't help but think that's what's going on now spiritually brothers and sisters there's so much pressure going on in this world and the light that we have inside of us the life of Jesus Christ Living out through us is just compressing all of this causing it to happen and it sounds crazy but you know just as crazy as what was the magnetic recording device created for the whole world and Hollywood would say that was created so that we could have Hollywood movies so that we could do Blockbuster films we could have all of the albums and everything recorded and artists and all this stuff but is that what it was created for or was that all of that a perversion of the purpose it was created for I know it's it's a bit crazy to say it but I am a little crazy uniting time and sign brother Branham says also well all this uniting of the nation these signs National signs we see out here in the world earthquakes and diverse places different things uniting bringing the world together bringing the people together all the churches together all these things and while all this uniting has been going on there's another uniting going on amen that's what I want to point out to you now God is uniting his bride I had looked at this and looked at this and looked at this but just tonight in the office before I came up here it just struck me like a brick you know what it is he's saying here I'm not interpreting what he's saying but I'm just reading it verbatim and I think it just clicked for me God is uniting his bride it's not that God is uniting with his bride even though he is uniting with his bride because remember in our scripture here love your enemies pray for those who despitefully use you God is uniting his bride she is coming together she's not dividing and separating she's coming together from East and the west and the North and the South there is a uniting time and that's what's on right now what is she uniting for the Rapture amen God's getting her ready what hit me brothers and sisters is that the bride is uniting together it's not so much that God is uniting with his bride how is God going to unite with his bride brothers and sisters there's this is the punch line the thing that I found so astounding so beautiful God is uniting through his to his bride through the uniting of his bride getting together when we say you know what it doesn't matter if you step on my toes because I know who you are you wouldn't try and hurt me you made a mistake and I forgive you and if you come and ask for forgiveness of course I'm going to give it to you quicker than than you would maybe believe I'm not gonna drag a ball and chain around about it but here we have brother Branham saying that God's getting her ready yes sir uniting and I love how he says this because he's not saying he's getting her together with persecution brother Bradham says extensively extensively in the message that if she's already been judged if we have judged ourselves then why would we go through the tribulation to be judged again we're not going to be judged in the tribulation people want to know whether it's pre-trib or post-trib or mid-trib you know what we had a prophet a Vindicated prophet of God said that we're pre-trib bride of Jesus Christ doesn't go through the the tribulation to be purified to be judged she's already judged herself according to his word that's the standard that she judges herself by by the word but you know it's a uniting time and that's on right now he says what is she uniting for the Rapture amen God's getting her ready yes sir uniting what is she uniting with with the word she's uniting with the word isn't that wonderful when we look at that that's our absolute all we need to do is Unite with the word that's what gives us the ability to go forwards in the Rapture that's what's going to save us that's what's going to bring us together is the word of God when we know that it's our absolute I think I was having a conversation with uh brother Joe's way on the weekend and you know imagine if everyone could just say well I've got my opinion I've got my opinion on what the prophet said I've got my opinion on what the prophet said I've got my opinion on what the prophet said and you know we have that in our our midst in the world today but you know how many different sects of the message do we get we get people who will you know just make it a uh so legalistic that you can't even say Amen in church to people who will go and starve to death all in the name of the message of the hour but then there's a group of people that's uniting together around the word of God saying that that's the absolute and I think it's beautiful because she's uniting together according to what the prophet said she's not dividing she's not separating she's uniting together so close that the world wouldn't know who her friend or her enemy is because she loves everyone and yeah she believes Matthew Chapter 5 and and how does she believe it it's one thing to say that I believe yes I believe but it's a totally different thing it's the next level brothers and sisters and we know this but I believe it has to be preached and that is to Simply live it just to Simply live it to say that you know if we just love them which love us what reward have we but Jesus said to him does doesn't the publicans have the same and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than the others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and I just want to try and encourage us brothers and sisters the only way we're going to be perfect is to just take the word and apply it entirely in our lives according to the word for our day which is the message of the hour what's he uniting for the Rapture amen God's getting her ready yes sir uniting what is she uniting with with the word for all heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away she's uniting herself with thus saith the Lord this one just about put me off my chair the other day when I was I was reading this she's uniting herself with us saith the Lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody else says she's uniting herself and and you know it's wonderful because we can look at the message of the hour and we can try and explain it to people and encourage people and you know it's one of those things where you kind of either get it or you don't you kind of have the ability to receive it or you don't have the ability to receive it and we can't put people in and we certainly don't want to put people out but the people who really believe it they live it and that's I believe what brother Branham is saying here and I know that that's kind of Dangerous Waters just hear me out here I'm not trying to to to interpret what the prophet's saying but she's uniting herself with us saith the Lord what's thus saith the Lord in the day in which we live brothers and sisters there was only one man that I've ever heard about that would be saying thus saith the Lord in this Century in this generation and that was the prophet of God the the prophet for this age he's the only one that would dare say thus saith the Lord and watch it come to pass regardless of what any denomination or anybody else says she's uniting herself she is getting ready why she is the bride that's right remember that story I just can't help but think about it the the the woman who is the the the flunky of the cousins living out on the ranch and they were all looking for a husband and there was the the wealthy Sons the wealthy man businessman's son came out and and he saw all the women all of the cousins were mocking the the one sister maybe she was the runt of the bunch and and she never did anything with herself never tried to pretty herself up she just was pretty she just was beautiful but he came out and he was looking for a bride and he caught he she caught his eye and he went and talked to her and and asked her what is it about you something about you that's got my attention I just I just looking for a wife and every one of these out here they just don't do it there's nothing in them that attracts me they're trying too hard they're not just who they say they are I can tell they're fake but that one caught his attention and and what did he tell her I'll come back for you I'll be back and I'm coming back for you and she told all of their cousins and all of the girls there all those ones who were busy living their Works gospel and what what did they say oh not for you not for you you're a scrub look at you look at the things you've done in your life you never accounted to nothing in your life you think that he's coming back for you but she knew in her heart and that's all that counted right she was the one she just kept going she just kept singing she just kept doing the work knowing that she truly would be going with him but the Branham says she's uniting herself she's getting ready why she's the bride that's right and she's uniting herself with her bridegroom I thought he said she's uniting herself with the word I thought he said she's uniting herself with us saith the Lord now he says he's uniting him herself with the bridegroom I think it's a beautiful thing because if you take all those and you put them together what is it it's Jesus Christ because who is going to say thus saith the Lord on Earth there's only one that could ever do that she's uniting herself she's getting ready why she's the bride that's right she's uniting herself with her bridegroom see the bridegroom is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's why I just think it's such a dangerous thing to do anything else with Jesus Christ to say that he's a brother a third person or a second person any person he's God he's God just to continue on with this quote here the uniting time and sign paragraph 92 and the church and the bride and the word is becoming one I and my father are one that's that's my summary of that I'm putting that in there I and my father are one but here we have brother Brad I'm saying it in a different way and the church and the bride and the word is becoming so one until the very word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom amen you see it a uniting I love how he says this it's just so clear no more join the church not more of this but flee from everything and tied to Jesus Christ see it's the uniting time God uniting his bride together bringing it back just exactly uniting the words of his promise just like that one that rich businessman's son uniting the words of his promise brother Bradham says second Thessalonians second chapter it says the fifth chapter says the saints that are asleep and the dust of the earth will awaken then will Unite with them the living ones the ones that's been dead will unite before we can even get up there because the bride will be complete when she gets there isn't that beautiful we're not going there to get complete brothers and sisters it's happening now that's why we Fellowship this way that's why we come to church on Wednesday nights when we're tired in our busy lives that's why we bring our kids to church that's why we tell them this is what we believe now you have to have your own experience too son and daughter you have to go forwards you can't just accept what I have in my life it's not going to be enough for you father Bradham says the ones that's living that's uniting themselves with the word and those that are gone already did that and it all comes together make one great Union of the uniting before going up there amen I just think it's such a wonderful thought we have the ability brothers and sisters to just put it all away put aside all of the problems in our lives and recognize the uniting time is going on to think about how this world all of the the Blasphemous things that are going on and and and how people might even mock this message of the hour but but to see how this other terrible stuff is going on and seemingly succeeding and it will it will continue to grow darker and darker as we go but that's not going to stop us we're not going to get darker and darker don't let it get you darker and darker if you've got Christ Living in you you're going to get brighter and brighter it's going to be the law of the contrast and you're not going to have to say anything and I'm sure that every one of us gives us experience it already you go into a a place maybe a waiting room and a in a restaurant and people are jostling and swearing and you step in quietly and you don't even say a word and and they suddenly they see you and and they all look at each other and they get white in the face and they say oh sorry and and you say nothing I never said anything why would you say sorry but it's the presence it's the spirits that are in those people they're recognizing the spirit that is inside of us when we walk into the room of people like that Brother Brad I'm out of another message he says now with the penny now what the what the church the Pentecostal church needs tonight along with the other churches is a good old-fashioned baptizing of the Holy Ghost and love that will make you straighten up and get together and come together like brothers and sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ and break down these walls of partition amen where there's love God is love love suffers long love is not provoked love is not puffed up when you get puffed up Love's gone when we say to our wives you need to get in your position I'm the husband you need to submit yourself unto me Love's gone and we know that's God and thankfully brother Branham said you know he's just like a dove and he's just gonna fly away and he'll just sit in that tree and wait till that wolf nature gets out of us until we let some air out of our tires and we come back down to our normal size and then he'll come back but he brother Bradham here he says where there is love God is love love suffers long love is not provoked love is not puffed up when you get puffed up Love's gone and where there's all this malice and strife and wars and envy and Malice against one another brother God just moves out that's all and it's a fact you can see it amen that's out of the Seal of the Antichrist 1955. so tonight brothers and sisters I just want to encourage every one of us to just go on to perfection in Christ not worry about trying to live in a in a gospel where it's a bunch of works that we do but but read the book of Hebrews as we've read Hebrews chapter 6. let's move on to Perfection we we don't need to worry about all of the the mechanics we've got the mechanics we've had the Mechanics for decades even even hundreds of years I would say but you know what we haven't had the Dynamics like we've got them the Dynamics is a relatively new thing the Dynamics is the thing that came around here in the last few decades like the last 60 years the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost is what's going to take us into perfection so I'm just going to close with this one quote and I'll call the musicians now but we read it at the beginning and talking about this perfection brother Branham says and so is every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God it isn't you become changed there's something about you that something has moved in made you a different person I just want to say this tonight maybe stand with me as we begin to close here brothers and sisters if we have not become a different person in Christ Jesus but we agree with this word or maybe we have at one time in our life become a new person in Christ Jesus well we're not sure where that person is or maybe we know that we're a new person in Christ Jesus but sometimes in our life we just don't feel like it it's not too late he's still calling all we need to do is raise our hands unto him and say Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word just take the bitterness the Wrath the malice out of me if I've gotten puffed up let me pull that cork and just let that hot air out and let me come back to myself let me get beside myself and just Lord here's my cup just just fill it up Lord Jesus and I guarantee you brothers and sisters if we can have that genuine testimony he will fill it up he said something has moved in made you a different person you look on life different you look at things different it isn't you that's bubbling it's something within you pushing it out it's Christ pushing out the testimony and the life and it all comes back to Christ and I just want to throw this in if there's something in you tonight brothers and sisters that's crying out that any of this is true that's the Holy Ghost speaking to you tonight that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that is God in heaven sending a revelation to your heart to say Amen to the word and I would just say you know we have every single reason to rejoice we have every right to Rejoice we don't need to remain silent knowing what he's done for us if he has made us a new creature he says the law having a shadow of things to come could not make the comer perfect what's the subject Paul speaking of here Perfection God requires Perfection no one could ever come to Heaven outside of being perfect now just set Stella minute look perfect you must be perfect and yet the scripture says not as perfect so if you must be perfect and come to heaven then and the scripture says None is perfect and we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God how are we ever going to enter God's living place and Dwelling Place when he requires Perfection Jesus said I Believe In The Sermon on the Mount he said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect think of the Perfection that God requires of the person a perfection I want to say tonight brothers and sisters if he said be ye therefore perfect even as my Father in Heaven is perfect you can be perfect and you know why because the bride is uniting herself with thus saith the Lord for her day and thus saith the Lord for her day wasn't a man that said you're perfect you never even did it in the first place that was God himself saying that through the prophet and he was saying it to his bride to the elect lady so brothers and sisters that's the only Perfection we're ever going to see in this world everything else is imperfect everything only Christ Jesus living out through us is perfect let's just bow in prayer tonight gracious Heavenly Father Lord I Thank you for your word I thank you for the freshness of it Lord how you just Lord you bring it in such a way that father sometimes we need it thank you for showing me things Lord for continually Lord leading me and guiding me giving me the ability father to have something father to feed your sheep Lord there's no way that I could ever do it and I thank you Father for doing it Lord you are so wonderful father Lord Jesus we thank you for this direction that you've taken us tonight Lord to tell us that we can forgive those who who despitefully use us Lord that that we can forgive our enemies we can love them Father Lord Jesus but then Lord by doing all of that that makes us perfect because the only way we'll ever do that is to have your life living out through us and the only way we're ever going to have your life living out through us is if we humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord so that you can lift us up father Lord if we can align with your word then you will manifest your word in our lives father I just want to pray tonight for each one father if there's a desire in the hearts of your children for more of you that's because there's more of you to be had Lord and we're so thankful that even in this dark hour in this late day in in this Midnight Hour father that there is still a cry in the heart of your children father for you Lord Jesus we just lift our cups unto you tonight and we ask father that you would just fill it up one more time that you would just top us up father that we would have enough oil in our Labs father should you call us between now and the next time we'll get together in your name that we'd be ready to go father that we could just trim our lamps Lord and just get rid of all that carbon and just be ready to go in to the marriage supper of the Lamb father we love you and we thank you we pray that you would just go with us now as we go our separate ways father whether we just sign off on the computer or whether we just drive home father we we know that you're not bound by time or space and I pray that you would just father go with each one of your children as we go our separate ways tonight and if it Be Your Will for us to gather again on Sunday
