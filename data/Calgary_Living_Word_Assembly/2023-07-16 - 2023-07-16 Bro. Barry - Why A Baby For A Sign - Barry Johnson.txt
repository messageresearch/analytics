saying us because you're going to participate in it and the old drug get crossed but just before I do it I just want to tell a very quick story um I've always heard this song this old-time game but it made the most meaning to me some years ago when a sister sang it after giving the testimony so back in Nigeria we had the sister had gone for the mandatory um they call it the youth service but it's like a paramilitary service three weeks being with soldiers teaching you stuff and women are actually required to wear trousers and she had to take a stand and many times she got an intention and got persecuted through those three weeks just because she took with Stanley she came and sang the special the older get dressed and when she got to the points where she said to The Old Rugged Cross I will ever be true it's shame and reproach glad to be a I realized that we all have a cross to carry we have a part in that Old Rugged Cross so we'll do this song to get out play the first verse you join in the chorus the strings will play the second verse you join all the chorus again and brother John on the guitar would play the third verse and you join on the chorus and then we'll just send it that way so let's participate [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign here [Applause] [Music]

brother Philip Callahan and anyone else who has a need in their life gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus this morning we're so thankful that Lord you change not we're so thankful that every single day that we wake up Lord that we can say great is thy faithfulness father recognizing that just about every single day of Our Lives father we change and Lord we are not faithful but Lord you knew exactly who we would be exactly where we would be and how exactly we would receive your word and father our emotions we recognize have nothing to do with it Lord and our ability Lord Jesus to stand father just lies in our ability to believe father this morning we believe we're so thankful father that you have unending faithfulness to us Lord Jesus father we pray that this morning we could just bring these requests as we have mentioned unto you father one more time brother Philip Callahan needing a touch from you father Lord Jesus we know that we can be sick in our body or even in our mind Lord

happening and we're so thankful that we can bring our licks of fire together Lord to make up the many membered body of your Pillar of Fire father we just love you and we thank you and we just ask Lord also that you would just meet every need Lord made known unto you this morning by an uplift hand or maybe a question in a Heart Lord Jesus maybe a concern in a mind father we just ask that you would meet every need sovereignly according to your will father we just want to commit this service into your hands fully and completely Lord I pray that I could get out of the way and that you would just take control father Lord I pray that you would speak the words that you once spoken today and stop the words that you don't want father that Lord we would truly be blessed by what we hear father we love you and we thank you today we commit this service now entirely into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen bless you this morning I just think it's a beautiful thing and I just want to say this while we're standing Psalms 100 maybe turn there with me Psalms 100 verse 1. we're not getting into this yet but we're gonna we're gonna go there we're going to talk about worship and we're going to really talk about it in the future but just hearing the worship this morning it just made me think brothers and sisters if we can't get excited here what blows our hair back in this world where do we go for excitement where do we go to shout where do we go to worship God where can we go Psalms 100 verse 1 says a Psalm of praise Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands let me just read to you what strongs says noise means a Joyful Noise the definition it says primitive root to Mar especially by breaking figuratively to split the ears some people want worship to be quiet some people want worship to be silent we just want to say Amen brothers and sisters all Heaven is going to be silent one day to hear you worship [Applause] [Music] can you imagine all of those beings created to worship God almighty they're gonna be silent to hear the redeemed praise because they don't know what it means to be redeemed oh my but when we understand what it means to be redeemed we're having a conversation do we need to wait until God heals us from cancer to be able to worship Him or can we jump up and down and scream and shout because we know that we have been saved from Death unto life because outside of his salvation brothers and sisters we're As Dead As Dead can be outside of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives whereas lost his lost can be that's who we are but boy oh boy when we have the Holy Ghost in our lives there ain't nobody on this side of Eternity that can worship like the Bride of Jesus Christ oh my goodness oh my goodness [Music] figuratively to split the ears with sound that is shout for alarm or joy remember the children of Israel when they circled the city they just crossed over Jordan they just got into the promised land they weren't going in with swords and staves they weren't going in with catapults and cannons they followed the word of the Lord and the word of the Lord says just shut your mouths for seven days six days March around that City and just be quiet but on the seventh day when you hear those priests shout when you hear the trumpets then you raise your voice and you split the ears of the enemy and the walls will come down [Applause] brothers and sisters if we want to see victory in our lives Shout to the Lord [Applause] [Music] shout for alarm or Joy blow an alarm cry alarm allowed out destroy Make a Joyful Noise smart shout for joy sound and alarm Triumph I believe when we worship brothers and sisters it's Triumph we are triumphing over the enemy we can talk about how Miriam beat the tambourine on the other side of the Red Sea knowing that they were gonna die if it wasn't for God and they got to the other side and they saw the horse and Riders floating dead in the water their enemies were dead she beat the tambourine how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ my goodness why God bless you this morning your worship does something just uh I'm sorry I missed you I missed being here I just thought about worshiping and just the beauty of it it's so wonderful to be able to Worship in spirit and in truth and and we're going to get into worship but you know there's only one way that we can truly worship and that is in spirit and in truth and if you have followed the message for the hour for our day then you truly can receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and outside of the holy spirit in your life brothers and sisters we're not really truly worshiping but boy when we worship in spirit with truth oh my something happens we don't remain the same turn with me this morning to Isaiah chapter 7. thank you musicians I'm sorry to keep you waiting here I just uh I just get a little excited too I just think it's wonderful you know there really only is two times that I'm aware of where Heaven is silent one of them is when he steps off the throat of intercession the silence in heaven for the space about a half an hour and the other time is when it comes time for the redeemed to worship God and to me that just does something that just that just says something for all heaven to be quiet only for two purposes two reasons my Isaiah chapter 7 I want to continue uh on with the thought we had last week about a super sign start with verse 10 of Isaiah chapter 7. moreover the Lord's Lord spake again unto ahaz saying ask the assign of the Lord thy God ask it either in the depth or in the height above but ahaz said I will not ask neither will I tempt the Lord isn't that interesting here we have a king in Israel he should be able to ask the Lord but he had condemnation in his heart there was something not right in his life brother Branham said that he was a backslider he was an evil King and and he couldn't ask the Lord and he knew it so he didn't dare and the Lord comes in verse 13 and doesn't address him in his condition he addresses the House of David the lineage of Christ and he said hear ye now o House of David is it a small thing for you to weary men but will ye weary My God also therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel let's just bow in prayer one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you and we thank you thank you for the Liberty where your spirit is Lord Jesus because we know it's not just Liberty to shout and to sing and maybe to dance around but it's liberty to recognize that you truly have redeemed us father we love you and we thank you for that Liberty now we pray that Lord Jesus one more time you would take this word this this bread of life father and just break it open to us fresh once again Lord that spiritually speaking when we leave here today we would say that truly we were fed oh Lord Jesus not by Brother Barry but by truly the Lord Jesus Christ himself we love you and we thank you and we just commit the words that are spoken now the words that were read this Eternal Word into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated as we had mentioned before um just as an announcement the odds are great if you're sitting towards the back of the of the sanctuary that the deacons will be pushing you forward inviting you to take a few seats forward we can see that this empty area is starting to fill up and that's wonderful but as we go we're going to need to continue to squish people in and and use as many seats as we can so just don't be upset or concerned if someone Taps you on the shoulder and invites you to just move up a little bit it's just because we need a little bit more space and especially for parents with small children it doesn't make any sense for children to be up in the front area I mean parents with small children that need to be taken out when they're upset and so we just want to leave the back rows open for parents with small children and uh just in ask that you won't be upset if we if we invite you to move next Sunday we've got a potluck coming up and I think it'll be a wonderful time on Fellowship once again at the end of the month we have special meetings with uh brother Ed Hamer Meister at end time message Tabernacle and our brothers and sisters who are here now some of them God bless you certainly good to see you brother John I haven't seen you since you've been married I trust married life is treating you well God bless you so yeah we have uh I think the meetings start on the 28th and go to the 30th and uh so yeah it'll be a wonderful time of Fellowship in Edmonton are you happy this morning out of this message the super sign um brother Branham he talks about how God chose in verse 14 of Isaiah chapter 7 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel why did God choose a baby I'm probably going to repeat some of the stuff we talked about last week but her yeah it was last week it's amazing we uh yeah we put on some kilometers this last week thank you for your prayers by the way we had such a wonderful time we went to Yellowstone National Park and just camped out there spent two nights in the park and then drove home but took our time two days down and two days back and two days in the park it was just a just a real nice time um one of the things that we discovered which is good also is that everyone's used to have in their space and sometimes when you take people that are used to have in their space and put them into a confined space it can get a little bit tense and uh you know having a a camper is real nice but sometimes it's just not enough space but uh we had a wonderful time all in all and the Lord was just good to us we had so many traveling mercies I know you know I was thinking about it while I was driving I think we did about 2500 kilometers and I know that's not many for some some have done way more kilometers I think brother Justice is probably got the record for kilometers in our congregation here but some people have done many many kilometers and I just was thinking while we were driving you know how many times does the Angels encamped about those who fear Him actually jump between Vehicles right on that Center Line and just create a grease to slide the vehicles past one another when otherwise there could be a clip or a head-on collision there were so many times where I thought my goodness I can't believe people are driving the way they were and you know maybe people say that about me too and that's why I was saying that I don't know but it just is amazing when you think about his faithfulness isn't it and how many times in our lives do we do we experience things that we don't even experience we just have his grace and his mercy and and somehow we just remain safe and and and secure and and healthy and alive it's just amazing thank you for your prayers we covet them we need our each other's prayers don't we that's what the body does is praise for one another and that's why it's important to be a part of a body and and to separate ourselves from a body it just means uh it does no good but uh anyways talking about our our our message is out of super sign I believe it's in 1962. uh sorry it's 1959. it's 12 27 m a super sign and uh brother bradhamy talks about it in this message over and over he just takes the time to continually ask the question why a baby why would God the the almighty Creator the one that created the heavens and the Earth why would he choose a baby for a sign and he explains there's many different signs in the Bible many different examples of signs in paragraph 69 he says I think that God had in his mind it would be appealing to the human being did you think about that I don't know how many people listen to this message but I I just can't get away from it how God would know that this is appealing to the human mind something about this causes a curiosity in the human mind he says it is to the believer the unbeliever doesn't care the make-believer they might think about it a little bit and maybe find something to criticize instead and just be distracted but the believer the believer is the one that says that attracts me there's something about that that I just can't get away from it's appealing when our God becomes one of us he doesn't become an angel and he doesn't become a great superhuman he just becomes an ordinary every day one of us isn't that amazing to think now some people would say brother Barry Jesus wasn't an ordinary every day one of us and 100 percent but this is what God was trying to do he was trying to express himself in his creation and brother Branham talks about it how he came as a baby why did he come as a baby so that he could actually grow up as a baby here come into this world as a baby nobody would ever say that you didn't come into this world as a baby you don't understand what it means to be hungry you don't understand what it means to actually desire attention and to have to cry he said when that baby cried that wasn't just Jesus a different man crying he said that was mighty Jehovah crying that was God crying in a baby and when we hear it in the Bible that he was tempted in all points all manners I've been marveling at the thought you know if if that's true and it is I'm not saying if it isn't but I'm just saying it to illustrate it if that's true then by the age 33 typically we probably have already been tempted every way that we could is that right 33 years old that's where he was crucified that's where he was murdered but it was for a purpose it wasn't just a terrible news story that came out that you know suddenly this great man with this great healing campaign was just crucified and murdered and now you know the church doesn't know what's going to happen no it wasn't that at all it was so that Mighty Creator could come down and be like Boaz he could be that near Kinsmen Redeemer the one who actually was part of the family and how can that be you have to have his DNA you got to be part of him he has to be part of you in order for him to be the Kinsmen Redeemer but to think brother random talks in this message he says it how he came as a baby he cried as a baby he knew what it meant to be a baby and then he knew what it meant to be a toddler and then he knew what it meant to be a teenager to go through the teenage years he experienced that I wonder if he ever talked back to his parents I wouldn't say that he did but I wouldn't say that he didn't because he was tempted in all points and I would say this even if he did he would probably say mama I'm really sorry will you forgive me because I shouldn't have talked to you that way he will always come subject to the word wouldn't he because he was the word the word made flesh no don't don't don't get upset I'm not trying to say things I'm just trying to just explore in in thoughts he was Jesus Christ and and he was God it wasn't just Jesus Christ another man it was God Almighty manifest in flesh it wasn't Joseph's Gene it wasn't Mary's egg it was Mary's womb that's all he chose to borrow a womb God chose to borrow a womb so that he could bring together and fertilize that egg inside that womb um the Immaculate Conception brother random says it in here talk about Immaculate Conception perfection created in the womb that he borrowed and and and and the punch line today brothers and sisters same as it was last time the womb that he wants to borrow today is yours he wants our spiritual womb that teeny little place that that brother Branham said it's only in the human heart no other animal on Earth has that little space that was scientifically proven but that place was created God created that place the mighty Creator he made one little spot in the heart of a human for his spirit and you know without that then we just received the mark of the beast which is terrible we come into this world speaking lies we were born in sin shaped in iniquity and that's why brothers and sisters by default if we don't accept the mark of the the baptism of the Holy Spirit then we just automatically have the mark of the beast as a baby we have the mark of the beast some people might want to debate that or get upset by that but don't worry just get the Holy Ghost and you don't have the mark of the beast that's the only solution to it paragraph 69 I think that when God had in his mind it would be appealing to the human being it is to the believer it is appealing when our God becomes one of us but to the starchy ungodly stumbling block we know that that's when they picked up Stones when Jesus said I am my father are one that's when they wanted to Stone him when he started to declare that they loved his healing campaign they loved the first and second pull of his ministry but boy oh boy you start making yourself God look out same thing today brothers and sisters when we start to say exactly what brother Gilbert's been saying what all the other Ministry have been saying I and my father are one when we truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're no longer ourselves he's not going to say I'm just going to co-exist with you we're going to have a cohabitation in your body no it's going to be a dying out to ourselves so that he can live it's appealing when our God becomes one of us but to the starchy ungodly a stumbling block I'll give you a sign of Virgin shall conceive I want to say this today every single one who has the ability to receive this message of the hour is a virgin because only a virgin to this word is going to be able to be that one that's all I'll give you a sign of Virgin shall conceive Emmanuel will be with you and we know that Jesus said I will be with you even in you to the end of the world I'll give you the sign a virgin shall conceive Emmanuel will be with you god thought it would appeal to the human race that our God would be one of us that he would cross himself and become our dust that he would become our stock a human stock the Creator who made all things the one who created the seasons who created life who created the blade of grass brother Bradham talks about a god hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same most people want to see some some great scientific things some sort of evidence but it's not even there he he's right there he's everywhere where we wherever we look brother Branham says and again it fulfilled prophecy the prophets had sought and another thing the word was made dust flesh and dwelt Among Us the Jehovah the word became human became dust and tabernacled with us everlasting sign shall never end oh when we think of it an eternal sign the super signs of all sign God becoming one of us and why did he become one of us brothers and sisters so that we could become him so that we could become him but to some people that's a stumbling block to say oh you go make yourself God how can you be God because he said it and you know that's not just me saying that's not just me saying that brother Branham said it let's just turn on our Bibles let's turn over to Colossians chapter one this is a scripture near and dear to me in my heart my pastor as I was being raised he spoke on this many many times and it truly is I believe the the Keystone for our our day the Revelation for our day there's many Revelations and many days but today is what we're talking about Colossians chapter 1 verse 26 even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints how has it made manifest to his Saints through a prophet through a prophetic utterance through God choosing a man and raising him up so that he could speak through that man a man that would be completely surrendered verse 27 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory it's got to be Christ in US brothers and sisters outside of that we're going to be just like every other Gentile and and I think maybe even almost miserable because we'll be wanting to get that far but not maybe going all of the way to get that that that place where he is in us but boy when we get there I just I just think it's beautiful because where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty then it becomes easy to worship we don't care about what's going on around us we just want him to hear our voice you know brother rather be tells that story about seeing King George come through in Canada and how how the people were there and they're all waving their flags and they're so happy to see the king as he goes by and that one little kid was upset and and and they said why are you upset didn't you see the king and the kid said yeah I did see the king well why are you upset because he didn't see me that's what we want to do is just make sure that he sees me we don't come to church to be seen we don't come to church to see if we're doing that brothers and sisters stop it it's the wrong reason we're not coming to church for the right reason if there's something that we want to come and critique and criticize continually stop it that's not the spirit of Christ the spirit of Christ is going to be subject to the word of God and the word of God is just going to raise worship to Jesus Christ to recognize what he's done for us like I said earlier do we do we need to be healed of something terrible in our lives to be able to Worship On or do we really recognize what he's done for us outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost outside of this free gift of Salvation in our day we would be done we'd have no hope I just think it's such a beautiful thing you know Jesus he thought it not robbery for him to be equal with God and brothers and sisters it's the same thing for us today we've got to recognize that we don't think it's robbery to consider ourselves equal with God not because we have the ability to create not because we can do anything on our own it's because he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be before him holy and Without Blame as a part of him if we're a part of him then we're co-equal with him it's the position that Satan wants so desperately and thinks that one day he's going to get it and doesn't believe that we have that position or any Authority that goes with it but it's just such a beautiful thing he chose us in him and we know that we've talked about it in the book of Ephesians Ephesians chapter five the scripture verse 32 this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church he talks about the roles and how a husband needs to have the wife and the wife needs to reverence her husband and and the children need to obey the parents and Paul is telling the church in Ephesians in the Ephesian church that you know this is a great mystery but even though we're talking about natural things we're not we're not actually trying to express natural things we're talking about the the supernatural things and and this is the mystery concerning Christ and his church that he desires to actually take a bride of his own choosing not not just actually have someone who is just going to be with him and and like I said earlier cohabitate that's not it at all he wants to become one with his bride but that takes a relationship and it takes submission it takes surrender we talked about roles and and how the wives are supposed to submit themselves to their husbands and that's a tough thing to do in these days because in this world the woman especially the wife is actually promoted to the position of authority in the home and that's the way the world is created that's the way movies are that's the way TV shows are that's the way music is the woman is strong she has Authority she has power but you know what that's not what the word of God says the word of God says that the woman submits herself unto her own husband as unto the Lord and that's really it's such a paradox but when a woman can do that it's only because a man can do it to God she sees the husband do it to his husband I'm going down a road that I'd only want to get too far down but it's just a wonderful thing to recognize that a man and a woman can come together and be in one mind and one Accord and it's the same thing concerning Christ in his church brother Branham talks about the uniting of spirit and flesh my goodness I don't do this often but I need to today bye brother Branham he talks about this paragraph 71 then again he must be the Seed of Abraham talking about Jesus and his lineage his position Abraham of course was the seed of Eve was the woman's seed that was to bruise the Serpent's head but Abraham if you can catch it he had faith in God which United the spirit of God with the Flesh of man this one stopped me in my tracks brothers and sisters this is why I'm talking about this and and laboring on it so many points in this message talking about Christ in you the hope of glory understanding that we need to become one with the Lord Jesus it's not about us having our own independence and and our own opinion and saying well I can take part of the message and I'll leave the other part of the message and and I I'm strong enough I can I can discern what I need for me and my house you know uh the word of God says as for me in my house will serve the Lord now the only way we're going to serve the Lord truly in our days according to the message of the hour we can say that we're going to serve it according to our Traditions according to maybe a denominational teaching but that's not going to give us the results that we think it will but Abraham he had a revelation didn't he his Revelation was that he had the ability to have faith and it was a supernatural Faith how could he have faith he was given the promise that he would have a son God came and talked to him he had that relationship with him and he didn't ask for it God came and said to him hey Abram get up get away from your family leave the land of her go and follow me follow me I'll tell you where to go just get up and March and sometimes in our lives we have that direction in our lives or we need to do that as well but he was given that he had something inside of him we know it was a supernatural seed it was that Faith Gene seed of God brother Branham says but Abraham if you catch it he had faith in God which United the spirit of God with the Flesh of man I just want to labor on that for a little bit brothers and sisters because if we have faith it's going to unite the spirit of God with our flesh it's going to unite us together as one and how do we get Faith we know Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God so the more we listen the more faith we get whether we feel it or not whether we understand it or not it's not an emotional experience you know brother Branham he says it that uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost is without sensation and it is without sensation it's not a feeling that we get that's why Mary never had a sensation brother Branham talks about that in the message of the hour he explains that very clearly I'm not sure what the message is but he says it very clearly there was no relation between a man and a woman there was no sensation it was just simply at Thy word be it unto me according to Thy word behold the handmaid of the Lord and when we have the ability to believe it unites that Faith with the spirit of God with our flesh it changes us it allows us to become a new creature in Christ Jesus brother Bradham goes on to say there is where the faith come there is why he could be this Abraham seed not all flesh but the uniting of spirit and flesh together god making himself tearing out rooting out all evil bringing into submission the flesh the dust that he created and live with you as a partner once again he goes from talking about Abraham out there and the story of Abraham and how that would happen but then he just brings it right down to the end to say you to live in you that he could he created to live with you as a partner and that's what all this is about brothers and sisters it's not about the stories and and the types it's all about you and understanding even in 1959 brother Branham is talking about the uniting time and sign the super sign the Lord Jesus Christ himself descending out of heaven with a shout with a voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and we know that's where we're at but in 1959 he was talking this way I think it's just beautiful when we look at this it's it's just exactly where we are today and and to think about this when we have that ability to believe when you have that ability to believe don't ever discount it brothers and sisters sometimes we get down in our flesh sometimes we get emotionally sick sometimes we get emotionally weak sometimes we get frustrated sometimes we get confused sometimes we have all these different things that happen in our lives sometimes we'll get physically sick but don't don't don't be wary and well doing don't lose your faith I'll say this if you have truly been called before the foundation of the world you can't lose your faith sometimes we get a little about morale he'll wait till we're down he won't come and try and get us when we're on the Mountaintop he'll come when when we're down when we're tired when we're frustrated when we're emotionally charged one way or the other that's when Satan's gonna come around and you know when he comes around if we can recognize his tactics we can just say get lost you know what I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ you have no part in me and he has to go if we submit ourselves therefore unto God then resist the devil he has to flee that's the way it works we don't flee from Satan he flees from us he has to but when we do that brothers and sisters the uniting of spirit and flesh together god making himself I just love the way he says this tearing out rooting out Evil Jesus never had any evil he didn't need to tear out all the insides of him he didn't have to die out to himself he had to go to the Cross he recognized that but he didn't have any sin inside of him that he had to root out that he had to tear out that he had to clean out he's talking about us brothers and sisters we need to do that work we need to be willing to tear it all out to tear it all down to say be it unto me according to Thy word if there's something in my life Lord that's displeasing unto you then reveal it to me show me Lord so that we can make it right and go forwards bringing into submission the flesh the dust that he created and live with you as a partner I think that's just amazing we have been given the ability to live with him as a partner in our lives if we're willing to believe if we're willing to just accept the word that we've been given in our day I apologize if this is just maybe real Elementary and and it's not real deep but it's just the way God's revealed it to me and I think it's so amazing to recognize that all we need to do is believe brothers and sisters and when we believe we'll listen and when we believe and listen then that that spirit will come around and Unite with our faith and that will change our flesh and one of these days you know what's going to happen we are going home when this church recognizes what it is and I want to say it brothers and sisters because I know Satan hates it and that's why I want to say it when the church recognizes that she is one with Christ that she is the second coming literal coming of Jesus Christ on earth when she recognizes that then the Rapture is going to go and Satan's time is over because as soon as the bride goes up Satan's cast down and you know we're not going to be here we don't want to be here when that time comes we were just like I said we were in Yellowstone and I'm not going to give you a lesson on Yellowstone but for those people who don't know it it's a super volcano they say and the whole entire thing is just a crater of a volcano and it's so amazing if you've never seen it you get the opportunity I think it's it's tremendous to see it and I trust by God's grace if we're still here that nothing can happen to his bride there will be no surprises so if you go there I don't think you need to worry about that volcano erupting but we never want to tempt God either I'm sure if it's erupting we'll never go there but to think about it how it's thousands and thousands of years old millions of years old they would say and you know what I would almost agree with them because you drive up the mountain those people that have been there you got to go way up over top of a mountain then you come down to like a Great Meadow and it's huge it's like a ginormous metal and what it is is the Caldera it's the bowl of the volcano and there's a lake there and there's Meadows there and there's a river that runs through it and oh manner of different things but underneath is magma a giant bowl of magma underneath it and and on top of it it's beautiful there's birds singing There's butterflies there's Buffalo there's elk there's birds the the trees the grass the flowers everything is so Serene it's so beautiful on top and thousands and thousands of years of of just nothing happening just allowing it to grow and Go Back To Nature is what's happened and you know it's amazing to see it because once the bride goes up brothers and sisters it wouldn't surprise me one second if that's part of what brother Branham saw as a vision where he just heard that awful explosion in the United States and he just saw smoking ashes you know in an instant it's going to change and we're not going to be here when that happens but we know that Grace here on Earth is holding something back I just couldn't help but think you know the the magma underground is just God's Fury and it's just there right under the surface and in so much that it's causing water to boil and shoot out a geyser and it's causing hot springs and the whole entire area is just active with all of this geothermal activity and it's fascinating to the human to see it to see nature behaving this way but it's God's Fury that's underneath there it's just right there and you know all it would take in this world is for everything here to just do an upside down flip and just take a thousand years and watch all of the fresh new seeds that were there just come to life again and all of the sin that was here just completely be baked out of this world if you've ever seen what a volcano looks like after it's erupted it's amazing because on a lava field you'll see this black lava field of rock and then you'll see little seeds Life coming to life all over the place in this rock this volcanic rock it's amazing but you know we're we're in a place where we know we know what's going on it's just a beautiful time to to be alive to recognize our position to recognize our day and its message you know Jesus when when he was here brother Branham talks about this message how he never defiled or contradicted any of his laws in paragraph 72 he says another thing he never defiled or contradicted any of his laws he cannot do that so a virgin I'll give you a sign I love how he says this not a Titanic not a U.N but I'll give you a sign of safety a virgin shall conceive and she shall bring forth the son and call him Emmanuel that's the sign yes and it's the same thing for us today brothers and sisters spiritually speaking you say the word you hear the angel messenger come unto you and say hi Oh hail thou highly favored woman God has had his eye on you and he's got a message from you that you're going to conceive you're going to have a baby and his name is called Jesus Christ and that's going to be the new birth we've had that angel messenger and we can choose to analyze it and say I don't know what he's saying to me I'm not sure he's kind of weird maybe it's just a different age he's you know back in the 60s I don't know if I can receive it that way or or just simply be it unto me according to Thy word and see what happens you know where the bat him in this message he talks about the Titanic in a couple of places and he said it and and I sometimes you know just to be honest with you I questioned it I say I'll questioned it the Titanic I didn't realize that it was actually an American ship the Titanic was made by Americans it was built over in Europe but it was made by the White Star Line which was an American shipping line brother Branham says that in this message I looked it up and I was I was just able to say amen that's wonderful I love that when you hear things and you just wonder because I always thought it was an English thing but you know what he said he said that they had such a a boastful Spirit on that ship that not not a wave could crash over it and cause it to sink and what did God do he put it on the bottom of the ocean just to show them you know what you will not tempt me there's nothing that's going to be a sign that you're going to be able to produce and in this message he talks about Nebuchadnezzar and and how he built the the Tower of Babel and and we know that that Tower was built it was built for a purpose it was built for the purpose that there shall be no other opportunity for God to flood mankind because they'll just be able to run up the tower and escape the flood as it comes but isn't it amazing to think that they didn't recognize that there was actually a sign given there was a sign and that sign was the prophet for the day and that sign was also given After the flood to show that there's a covenant that there will never be a flood so you're not even going to need a tower why would you be wasting your time with a tower when there's never even going to be a flood but you got to be willing to believe the word of God when it comes brother random says not a Titanic not something great by a man not a U.N but I'll give you a sign of safety that a virgin shall conceive as I read these as I see this and I say it I just think it is such a place of safety to recognize that we don't have to worry we don't have to run to and fro we don't have to search we don't have to question our hearts is this right we we might not understand it all and sometimes we'll have a little question about a thing here or there along the way but it doesn't change our faith in that God sent a prophet and that was so that we could be delivered doesn't change it at all because we recognize that that was a super sign that we were given in our day and I'll say it this way maybe we could look at that cloud over sunset Mountain and I would say brothers and sisters for us in our day that was a super sign that cloud represents way more than I think we give it credit many times that cloud recognize represents a doorway that was opened into heaven into the very mind of God to understand what those Seven Seals were sealed up for for all of the Ages were given to us in our generation were revealed to us I think that alone gives us the ability to Rejoice we have the ability to to understand things understand the very mind of God throughout all of the ages people were trying striving to understand coming up with different things even brother Branham saying that you know he had the idea that maybe this this Horse and Rider the the first horse rider that white horse rider he had a bow and arrows and he thought that maybe he was like cupid shooting arrows of love and we know that that Rider he had a bow but he never had any arrows because he was Satan that Antichrist Spirit but it was the angel of the Lord that met brother Branham that told him the truth about the matter every single night before he went out to preach the seals I just think it's so beautiful when we talk about this I'll give you a sign I'll give you a sign of safety that a virgin shall conceive but the problem goes on to say in paragraph 75 he gave another sign at a burning bush what was it when he caught his runaway Prophet I have heard the cries of my people and I've remembered my Covenant he gave another sign there and that sign wasn't the burning bush brothers and sisters that he was a covenant-keeping god isn't that wonderful because we know that many times a few times anyways in the Bible he has said I remembered my Covenant I've thought about the words that have been spoken the words that have been cried the prayers that have gone up and I remembered the Covenant that I made with my people I remembered that I think it's just beautiful that he was a covenant keeping God that he remembered everything that he said every promise that he had made brothers and sisters if we need healing in our minds he has promised us that he is not the author of confusion that he has given us the power of love and of a sound mind and when we start to get confused and we start to have problems in our mind we can just rebuke Satan and say you know what that's not the Lord Jesus Christ he's not the author of confusion if we're sick in our bodies we have the ability to remind him of his promise by my stripes you are healed we don't have to take what the devil hands us you know we we talked about this a while ago and and I I think sometimes the natural typing the spiritual is so important before we went to the states we stopped at a place called writing on Stone Provincial Park and we spent the night there and we took a walk and it's so amazing to to see the the things that are there just the natural surroundings and and and just the way God created the Prairies and and and all of the the creation there it almost looks like a city if you've ever seen it you'll know what I mean the way that erosion has happened on the hillside surrounding the Milk River and there's little I think they call them hoodoos like Stone formations they're like little towers and there's thousands and thousands of them around there and anyways the point I want to get to is we were walking along a trail they've got notices everywhere about snakes be very careful about snakes there's rattlesnakes there Prairie rattlesnakes they're venomous and they can kill they're very dangerous animals and and I just couldn't help but think you know we need to be very careful I know what this means we need to be very cautious and so we're walking on the pathways and I walk down a pathway and and the boys followed me down a pathway but then Lisa walked down the pathway and she heard a rattlesnake right on the edge of the pathway and I I was like are you serious and so I went back and I thought my goodness I walked right by here and had no idea and the boys walked right by here and had no idea in fact one of our boys I think it was Benjamin he stepped close to the edge of the pathway right where the snake was and you know how do we know he was there you could hear his sound I'd never heard a rattlesnake in person before but that's what it sounds like and so it just made me think about it you know we're looking at this snake and looking at this snake and we went down the path and went and saw the stuff we wanted to see and we came back up and wondered is he still there I did that and you hear that he's still there he's right there and it just made me think about the quote that brother Branham says you know when when you just have this thing in your life and you just continue to look at it and you say I rebuke you I rebuke you I rebuke you I rebuke you turn a walk away but if I stood there and just said I rebuke you I rebuke you I rebuke you and he would just keep rattling and Rattle and eventually he would come out wake up and come out maybe when it got a little bit cooler and I'd get bit in our lives brothers and sisters I believe it's the same way the natural types of spiritual don't look at it just move on let him keep rattling in the background say I rebuke you in the name of Jesus and just keep going just keep pressing on like brother Branham said that voice told him don't get hung up on a on a Viper in your life Satan's gonna have enough of them we're gonna see enough of them on our paths we don't need to stop and dwell on it even though I really wanted to see it because I am fascinated with them only because only because I recognize what happened in the garden and I know all of us do and so I'll just tell you my thoughts what was was the serpent one animal was it one creature sure it was we believed that he walked up right but then God cursed it so cursed how many varieties of them are there now and how many of them are lethal to human beings naturally and spiritually why but I just thought it was so beautiful because we could stand there and say I rebuke you I rebuke you I rebuke you and just listen to him Rattle and maybe talk to other people coming up the pathways and warn them look there's a snake there be careful or we could just keep going and trusted everyone else follows the same signs that we follow we read the signs we understood be careful there's snakes everywhere I just thought it was beautiful to see that paragraph 77 here it says but when it comes to the Plan of Redemption he came alone I know we talked about this last week but I just want to talk about it this week he didn't send an angel he didn't send a prophet he didn't send a good man or a good woman he didn't send anyone else he came alone when it came to the Plan of Redemption he came alone nobody was with him he was the only one that could come an angel couldn't do it another man called his son couldn't do it he's going to hang there for a second another man called his son couldn't do it why one called something else a holy virgin or holy mother or some Saint couldn't do it God had to come and I'll give you the sign a virgin shall conceive and a baby will be born and he will be Emmanuel God With Us the super sign I'll just say it again this time last week this hit me while I was preaching and I think it's so beautiful because for those that want to say that Jesus wasn't God you can't call him Emmanuel then because Emanuel says God With Us that's the meaning of the word Emmanuel and I had never thought of it that way until we were ministering last week but that's what he is God With Us the super sign God in his people god with his people God become his people God and man became one a sign a stumbling block to the world but a blessed hope for the believer a sign that will be evil spoken of just like us today brothers and sisters I just think is so amazing because it's simply the I am I am it's not a plurality it's not us the Father the Son the Holy Ghost is not we it's I am that's all and Jesus was God the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us paragraph 80 brother batam says and at the Red Sea he showed that he would make a way for those who were trying to do right and follow his commandment don't matter what cuts it off God proved that the Red Sea and gave a sign that he could open up the sea in every temptation brothers and sisters he's not just speaking to the people in 1959. he's speaking to us this is stored up food for a purpose for a season and I believe we have the ability to feed upon these these spiritual rations that were given to us but I don't think it was rationed out in a in a careful manner we have been given a gusher we can we can just go and and help ourselves to this Buffet of food at any time that we want to and and he says that the Red Sea he showed that he would make a way for those who were trying to do right and follow his commandment is there anybody here today trying to do right and follow his Commandments he says no matter what cuts it off God proved that the Red Sea and gave a sign that he would open up the sea in every Temptation he will make a way of Escape say mother don't believe it Daddy don't believe it the church don't believe it I don't care who don't believe it if you believe it God Will Make A Way of Escape and that's why I keep saying it brothers and sisters it doesn't matter what our past Traditions are it doesn't matter what our past teachings are what what is it to you today what is the Gospel of Jesus Christ today what is the message of the hour today and I'll say it this way who is the message of the hour today because it's Jesus Christ but not Jesus Christ somewhere out there it's got to be Jesus Christ right here be it unto me according to Thy word let that life that grows inside of me become Jesus Christ so much so that the world around me doesn't see brother Barry Johnson they see Jesus Christ if you believe it God Will Make A Way of Escape he gave a sign that he would they were on their way straight to the promised land I think brother Branham says it was what a two or three day Journey that took 40 years can you imagine that and what caused it murmuring that's what caused it murmuring critiquing criticizing all of that business in the background you're not the only Pebble on the beach Nathan and Cora you're not the only holy man Moses why should we listen to you God blesses us you shouldn't do what you feel led to do right but he gave a sign and only those who could believe were able to believe and you know sadly it took that generation to die out God finally said I'm done with you those carcasses will fall in the wilderness and only those who were what 20 21 years old and under they're the ones that will go in because blessed are those eyes that haven't seen Thomas than those who actually have those people who haven't seen but they've heard and they understand by the speaking of the word something inside them just says Amen to that word brother Branham says he gave a sign that he would they were on their way straight to the promised land where God promised them and the Red Sea shut them off and they got in trouble they didn't know what to do God showed them that he would make a way of Escape in every Temptation every trial he says you can't quit smoking take God one time you can't quit lying can't quit stealing can't quit having a temper take god with you one time if you don't feel like going to church and you can't get anywhere take god with you once take his promise he proved at the Red Sea that's a long ways back isn't it that he'll make a way of Escape God has gave so many signs if we're having a problem if we've got a situation brothers and sisters just take God one time that's what the prophet said just take God one time and just see if God won't open that sea up for us and we know that he's not going to open the sea and and say that I won't actually allow you to go through the sea I'll just float you over top of the sea with angels and put you down on the other side and and everything will be rainbows and butterflies that'll be soft and fluffy no no no no no no no no he'll actually make a way for us to go right through that trial right through that Red Sea right through that problem First Corinthians 10 says there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man God knows he knows exactly what Temptations will come our way he knows exactly the way we've been created so does Satan but what Satan doesn't understand is that God's going to make a way for us to escape whereas Satan thinks he's going to make a way for us to get destroyed because I understand but God is faithful there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able he won't let it go to the point where you'll break but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape so brothers and sisters I want to say this is encouragement this morning if you're getting Temptation if you're getting manifold Temptations in your life if there's a situations that seem like they're closing in rejoice this is where we want to start talking about worship start to Worship the Lord give him praise because that means he's going to make a way of Escape for you out of that Temptation if you didn't have Temptation there would be no way of Escape now some would say well then I wouldn't need a way of Escape but in this flesh in this world I think we all need a way of Escape there's got to be something for us in this world more than what we see in this world boy oh boy I think it's just beautiful he gives us the way of Escape through the Temptation that he takes us through through the Red Sea we get our back up against the mountain and we get our our front up against the sea and and we see the I want to say Satan we see Pharaoh's Army coming after us we can see the smoke and the Chariots and the dust coming our way what happened it was a pillar of fire that came down when they cried out that Pillar of Fire came down and protected them from that enemy until he created a way of escape and you know what he's just saying yesterday today and forever brothers and sisters don't ever doubt that picture of the pillar of fire we don't worship a man but what that does is shows us that same Pillar of Fire is here right now we might not see the pillar of fire in this room but he's in this room right now and he wants to give us a way through he wants to show us you don't have to be subject to the rattlesnake on the side of the trail all you got to do is stop looking at him stop talking to him stop talking about him stop giving him any power in your life and just walk on just keep pressing forwards because he borrows bodies and he wants yours LeBron says he just borrowed the womb of the woman the same as he borrows this body to preach the gospel from the same as he borrows your body to do the work that he wants to do through you because he still is Emmanuel God With Us a sign god with his people God living among his people the super Everlasting sign it can never fail it'll always be the sign Christ in you the hope of glory I just think it's so beautiful when we look at this and recognize that he has already made a way of Escape for us he knew what trials we would encounter he knew what dispositions we would have he knew what families we would come from he knew the trials the struggles that we would encounter in our lives and he said you know what I know that there's no way that Satan will ever be able to get them to curse me to my face and you know what Satan if you think you can you can go ahead and try what makes us think that we're any different than job just go on and try it but they're going to overcome they're not going to overcome By Their Own Strength they're not going to overcome by the Believers from the church even though they're a support group they're only going to overcome by one way one method and that's by the word of God that's the word for their day they're going to overcome every single Temptation and every single trial foreign I just think it's beautiful that he borrows a body you know in John 10 37 says when he was here on Earth he proved that he was God proved that God was in him because the signs of God followed him he said if I do not the works of my father then believe me not but if I do the works of my father if you don't believe me believe the works the sign Emmanuel I and my father are one now this can be a real choking point for some people and and even myself as I look at this I think well what Mighty signs and wonders have I done in my life and I know that Satan coming around saying that to me because I don't think I've seen tremendous signs and wonders at my hand but I sure have at his hand I sure have in his hand and that's brothers and sisters one of the main reasons why I really enjoy testimony service because Satan wants us to believe that everything is just happening smooth and there's really nothing happening God's power isn't in his church and and where's the Miracles and we're not seeing great signs and wonders but we are seeing great signs and wonders we are seeing Mighty signs and wonders as the Church of the Living God he is with us even in us living out his word and you know Satan wants us to believe that nope you haven't been healed when you see someone get healed oh immediately the body just says oh they couldn't have been that sick couldn't have been that bad really really I remember hearing a brother tell me that he had one time where he had the devil attack him and he was laying on the floor in his bathroom and his eyes went yellow the whites of his eyes went yellow and we know that that is is is alongside various different diseases but he said he was out flat on the floor in that condition and he prayed and he prayed and God delivered him from it that's just one little thing but how many more little things like that that happened brothers and sisters we get a stomach ache and you know what sometimes in our mind we'll start to say oh what is that what is that Satan will come around and say yeah you've got this Pokey thing and it's just not going away it's been there for days it truly must be something terrible so now you've got this certain something and and we can say in our minds yeah I had I sure feel it man I really feel that thing maybe it's true maybe that's what I've got and we can start to buy into that that that thought train or we can just say no I don't I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ no I don't even if we go and see a doctor a doctor could tell us that that could be well you know you could have this and you could have that we could say well I don't like that but that one sounds not bad so maybe maybe that's what it is Win Lose or Draw right no that's not the word of God it's a box of rattlesnakes and you can just take it back because I don't have it and as he sends me so send I you the father was sent me is with me he is in me and doing the works of himself it's God in flesh it's God in flesh I just want to encourage us today brothers and sisters to recognize our position our position is that we are God in flesh when we have his holy spirit living out through us we are God in flesh the devil wants us to say there's no possible way that could ever be you're crazy you're a lunatic you're a heretic you're one of those Holy Rollers I say be it unto me according to Thy word call me a holy ruler and you'll see me jump up and down and scream and shout because that's where the victory lies the children of Israel were going into their promised land and fighting the enemies their their victories weren't in in just staying quiet was it over and over and over again the children of Israel were instructed by the Lord through the prophet go and stand in your position you just go to church that's all you got to do just go to church and I'll do the work but when the time comes I'm going to tell you to shout Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord and watch what will happen then the enemy will be wiped out can you imagine that brothers and sisters if we had Devils coming after us and we were just willing to do that just go to church and just wait until the time comes where we can worship until the time comes that we can just take every single ordinance that God has given us to do and we just can't wait to do it because we believe because you know what's going to happen when that happens the walls of the enemy are going to come tearing down an enemy we know we're not looking at enemies that are coming at us with swords and staves we're not looking at enemies that are coming at us with with guns and bombs we're looking at spiritual enemies because we don't wrestle against flesh and blood we're not wrestling against what we see with our eyes what we're wrestling against is demons Devils tormentors that want to try and get us to fall down to try and get us to unbelieve to try and get us to say oh I am too weak I'm too beaten down I can't believe the word of God because it really doesn't have effect in my life anyways I can't live it there's no way that I could ever live it so I might as well just eat drink and be merry that's what the devil wants to hear from our voice but not from a Believer a Believer will say no be it unto me according to Thy word no I believe this word of God and it doesn't matter what he takes me through he will always provide a way of Escape through that temptation because it's not me doing the work he is in me and doing the works of himself when we start trying to do it then he stops he can't do it through us when we're trying to do it but could you imagine it though if you could just actually take God at his word and follow him to the letter and watch spiritually speaking the enemies just get slayed just destroyed left and right if you read some of the stories in the Old Testament about how the enemies were destroyed many times they actually destroyed themselves they went to their neighbor and they stuck each other with a sword and they didn't realize that they were killing each other but the Lord Jesus is going to do the same thing for us brothers and sisters he's going to take those enemies those Temptations and he's going to make a way of Escape for us through them and they're going to destroy themselves simply because we believe the word of God and that in itself is the super sign our ability to say I recognize my position I recognize his position I don't feel like it I sure don't look like it but that's irrelevant because his word says that I am and I remember I I had that conversation a long time ago when I was really starting to catch this Revelation I just couldn't believe it and and I know the devil came around and said to me who said You Are a son of God who said you are and I had a voice come to my mind immediately it was like on one side literally there was one voice speaking and on one side literally there's another voice speaking one voice said who said you are another voice said the word of God I believe it was said I am said I am and you know brothers and sisters when the Devil comes around and says it to you I just want to encourage you just say that I am said I am not that I was or I will be it's got to be the I am today it's got to be the Lord today John 10 says if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do though ye believed not me believe the works that they may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him and how are we going to do the works brothers and sisters we might not see the great tremendous healing campaigns and and signs and wonders don't worry about that don't look at that look at the word look at your ability to receive the word of God in your day if you can say Amen to the message of the hour and live it you don't have to worry you are that super sign you are the answer to the devil's question will he actually have a bride of his own choosing what will she be like will she be big and fancy will she be in the in the in the great tremendous Church boy when we were in Helena Montana they've got a cathedral there that's beautiful for anybody that's ever seen it it's tremendous we didn't get to go inside it but the outside of it the spiers the Steeples just tremendous and I just I said I said to Lisa when we were driving there I said you know I wonder how that church over there feels I bet you they're Spirit-filled but they just there's one little church on the corner there and I mean little it was just tiny little church and and there's this ginormous Cathedral right over here you could throw a stone and hit it and here's this other funny little building over here with the church and I just thought my isn't that the difference between the Believers and and maybe the make-believers and I know brother Brandon said there's Believers in every group so I'm not going to put anybody in or anybody out but we know that Jesus he didn't decide to come for the God didn't decide to come for the Rich and Famous he didn't come for the the the the most religious folks of the day he came for the Sinners he came for the publicans he came for the ones who were sick that needed healing he came for those people that needed Deliverance paragraph 91 brother Adam says I'll give you an everlasting sign for God was made flesh Among Us he dwelt in flesh it'll be an everlasting sign not only to the Shepherds to look and believe but for you the Branham Tabernacle and for this cruel world to believe that that is God and I just can't help but say you know what because I believe this message of the hour I put myself in that Branham Tabernacle maybe that's just me being a little bit crazy but but I just think that's the way it is not only to the Shepherds to look on and believe but for you the Branham Tabernacle and for this cruel world to believe that is God God gave us that sign Jesus said as the living father has sent me and come with me and was in me so send I you the living father to go with you and be in you an everlasting sign these signs shall follow them that believe we know that it's Mark 16 in action right and and all else is false that's what brother Branham said in the church age book Mark 16 in action is the true church and that's the only one that he claims is his own and all else is false don't don't don't let that be the measuring stick though don't let that be your measuring stick as to whether you believe or not because you know what brother Branham says it very clearly in the message that God could call a man one time to use that man one time in his life his entire life and maybe give them the ability to live to a good old ripe age maybe three score and ten plus 20. who knows that's 90 years for those who don't know the problem I says three score and 10 which is 70. but here we have the understanding that he'll be with us even in us to the end of the world he might only use us one time in our lives that's why we can't let that be the measuring stick that one time could be at the end of our life could be at the beginning of our life and the rest of our life we just wonder maybe did we have something was there something in our life that's not the measuring stick that's what brother Branham said that's not the the the the Perfection of the Bride the Perfection of the Bride is is the measuring stick of the word the ability to stick with the word for her day that's why that's the true evidence of having the Holy Ghost In Our Lives is the ability to say Amen to the word but not just say Amen to the word but to live the word and then you know what brothers and sisters we've talked about this a while ago in the past it's already 12 o'clock I'm sure we'll be okay for a couple more minutes I hope but you know what Jesus said that I am the vine and ye are the branches and you know what every Branch gets purged and whatever's inside that branch is going to give the fruit of what's inside that person and and whether we like it or not whether we understand it or not when we come around the word of God when it's true word teaching and preaching the word of God is going to purge every single branch and every single branch is going to give fruit from their Ministry from their lives and whether they know it or not whether they believe it or not whether they recognize it or not the whole entire world is going to see the fruit of that Ministry of that life we can't help it it's the spirit of God it's the way it works if he is the vine and we're plugged into that vine and we are the branches we're going to give the same fruit that they did back in the book of Acts we're not going to give other fruit if we're an orange tree we're not going to produce lemons and you know what brothers and sisters if we see people producing lemons if we are an orange tree it's not up to us to go and prune those branches I think it's important to say it it's not up to us to do that that's up to God to do that keep watering that tree keep making sure that that tree is protected those are our brothers and our sisters maybe they just don't have the same Revelation that we do but they're still our brothers and our sisters we want to treat everyone the same way we want to give everyone the opportunity that we've got paragraph 109 of this message it shall be light again in the evening time oh this dark day that we've been through but for 40 years the clouds has been clearing back through the first reforming of the bringing forth of the message that God and Christ are one that God was made manifest in flesh he chose to dwell in human flesh and today they make him something sitting on a throne they put him out there as the eye will be they put him out there sorry and today they make him something sitting on a throne they make him a some prehistoric something some of them wants to take him back to a philosopher some wants to make him a prophet but brother he is God in you God manifests in flesh how how did they know he was God In the Flesh he said if I don't do the works of my father that I've told you wrong but if I do the works of my father you believe it how does that work in our lives I keep saying it and maybe I'll say it this way the same thing just in a different way The Works that we'll do in the name of our father is to believe the word that's the works that we'll do we'll go to church we'll worship we'll actually pay our tithes we'll actually go to church half an hour early like the prophet said we'll actually go to communion and foot washing will will follow all of the leadership of the spirit through the prophet that is our sign to this world that's our sign that we believe this word of God for our day it's not something that we say it's pretty easy to say oh God said a prophet and I can just get my own Ministry and now maybe I can act in a certain way and and draw men unto me that's not the way it works that's not the way it works the ministry that wants to do that you know it's false because they want to point to God the the true Ministry of of Jesus Christ will always point to God we know that twice John tried to Worship in the Book of Revelation and the angel message Angel he said no see thou do it not worship God don't worship a man don't worship an angel worship God how did they know he was God in flesh he said if I do not the works of my father then I've told you wrong but if I do the works of my father if I follow the word then believe it and brothers and sisters you're a super sign then we'll draw into a close here maybe I'll call the musicians and now the same thing paragraph 111 the message is revived again in the last days the message of who he is what he is when the church recognizes what it is then the Rapture will go I think this is just beautiful because I believe it wasn't until 1962 or 63 that he was saying those words but here we have them in 1959 which wasn't really far behind or before and now the same thing the message is revived again in the last days the message of who he is what he is Emmanuel dwelling in you with the same works that he did manifest himself through you the very same things that he did it's the evening light it's evil spoken of it's a hard way it's not easy just to actually live the message of the hour brothers and sisters it's not easy we've said it before in the past I'll say it today you know what for the children to look at us we look like maybe some of the elders they're polished folks they come to church every Sunday every Wednesday they come to communion foot washing they pay their tithes they they help out with the potlucks they help out with the church cleanups and they're always there to to be in church and everything is fine in their life right some of those people are the most battle scarred spiritual Warriors that you'll ever meet but they keep getting up and they keep going to church and they keep giving God the praise that he wants they keep believing the word of God and that is the evidence of that super sign it's nothing else it's not saying that they've raised people from the dead that they've been able to maybe lay hands on a car that was sick or or a baby that was Ill or all kinds of different signs and wonders no that's the devil's work he's gonna try and make us believe that our life is going to be better if we see some of those things that's not it your ability to be better is to just receive the word of God just be able to take this book and eat it up and it'll make your belly bitter but it'll be sweet as honey in your mouth it's a manual dwelling in you with the same works that he did what were some of the first works that he did he went out into the Wilderness wasn't he when he got baptized he got baptized got the Holy Ghost then he went out and got his Temptations and what did he say Satan came around and tempted him speak to these turn them into a nice loaf oh my you're so hungry just go you've got the power Just Do It turn him into bread oh you want it so bad right he said you know what Satan man shall not live by bread alone oh my but by every word that proceeds out of him oh God we can do that brothers and sisters recognize that's our strength that's our power it's not signs and wonders we had the first and second Paul we're in the third poll now the third poll is the ability to live this word maybe stand with me as we close it's just bow and prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord I pray that somehow someway the words that were spoken today would just find the mark in the hearts of your children Lord that father we could recognize that there's no great sign or wonder other than our ability to believe and when we believe that that word and your spirit will just bind themselves together father and we'll have a new birth inside of us and that new birth will be Emmanuel God not just with us but in US father I pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us father as we go our separate ways today pray that if there is any sick or Afflicted Among Us Lord Jesus that we could just be delivered in the name of Jesus I pray Lord that you would just watch over those who are traveling father that you would bless their time a fellowship here and Lord that you would just give them traveling mercies on their way
