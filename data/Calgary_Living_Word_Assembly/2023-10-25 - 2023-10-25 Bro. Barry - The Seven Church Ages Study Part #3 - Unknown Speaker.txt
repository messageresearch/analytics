go forwards in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians once again if you have your Bibles I'd like to read from Revelations the first chapter excuse me Revelations chapter 1 just two verses tonight we have read uh Revelations 1 verse 1 to 3 we've read verse 1 unto six and we've read 1 to 18 I believe we've read the whole thing before but tonight I just want to read verse 9 and verse 10 Revelations chap 1 we know that it's the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which must show shortly come to pass that's Revelations 1:1 but I just wanted to say that just so we can read uh Revelations 1 ver9 I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice voice as of a trumpet let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father tonight we just invite that great voice that John heard as a trumpet Lord to witness to us once again your word father that you would just speak to us Lord through revelation we know that we can hear the words of man but Lord Jesus many times when the preaching is happening when we listen to a tape father we know that you minister to our hearts that are br brains father they go quickly and they fire many thoughts quickly and father we pray that you would just allow that to happen tonight that your Revelation would just happen in the hearts of your children father we want to commit this word into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen I bless you tonight you may be seated certainly uh looking like winter time out there now just uh one announcement tonight that we have uh gym night coming up on Tuesday and uh I believe that we have two hours booked in the gym so it should be a a wonderful time for some ball throwing and Sport if you're interested to just come out and have a good time that's kind of what we're going to be doing so uh if you have any questions by all means just reach out tonight I would like to get into the exposition of the seven Church ages um chapter one The revelation of Jesus Christ and uh I just wanted to mention if anybody is interested we have more of these books now they're in stock um if you're interested we have them I'm going to be using it as we go along there's uh a few things in there that I want to point out that could be really helpful for us but uh out of the Revelation uh the exposition of the seven Church ages the revelation of Jesus Christ we'll just start with uh the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized amenah that's what I want to really talk about tonight I believe we could just take a whole series even on that one paragraph but I'm not going to do that to us I'm not going to try and drill down too far that way I would like to try and get some progress into the book it seems like I haven't been able to even start with it so um if you could just you have that up the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized you know we can have a lot of Revelation in our lives human beings get Revelation and a revelation is something that's revealed that's that's that's given we're able to maybe comprehend it and and some some might say that it's actually an idea or a thought and and truly it is an idea or a thought call it a revelation when something is revealed to us and you know there's been many many revelations in the world and we can talk about Revelations like some of the great inventors invented what's called electricity but they didn't actually invented it was already there but it was just revealed it was revealed to them that they could actually uh harness the energy of electricity and use it even though you can't see it but somewhere along the way someone had a thought someone had an idea something came to their Consciousness and they were able to take it and then apply it and see that it worked and then they were able to test it and then prove it to prove that it worked but tonight we're not talking about the natural uh call it anointings of Revelation that this world has we know that another example would clearly be the the revelation of the magnetic recording device and we've talked about this in the past too that how many people would say I even believed it this way that uh you know it was created so that you could have movies and and music and all of the worldly entertainments that we have but but we know full well uh as Believers that this anointing this this information this this knowledge was released to the world released to mankind at a specific time for a specific specific purpose and that was so that it could record thus saith the Lord of the Prophet for our day and we know that Satan has taken it and perverted it in such a great way that it would just totally completely outshine what thus saith the Lord looks like to a Believer and even to most Christians in in the denominational World many many Christians in this world you start to talk about thus sayith the Lord maybe sounds a little bit crazy I don't think you hear that very often preached in in a denominational setting thus sayeth the Lord I wonder how many Catholic churches you would hear thus saith the Lord mentioned I I honestly I don't know but I can only assume that it's not a very big topic but there's a reason why that knowledge was released why that that information came into the mind or Into the Heart of a human being so that they could create what was revealed to them what was unveiled that technology was already in Earth we know that the tele Vision was there in the time of the children of Israel being in Egypt they just didn't understand it they didn't have the knowledge it wasn't yet revealed to them but we know there's many different things um that have been revealed I find it fascinating just a a fun fact I know we've probably already seen it everyone has but if you look at some of the early Egyptian hieroglyphics some of them actually show clearly a helicopter a very streamlined helicopter back from the days of the Egyptians now we would say that that knowledge is new but is it did did they have that knowledge before we know that that brother bradam said that they were way more technologically advanced before the anti-d deluvian destruction than where they are today because how did they put those blocks together in the pyramid even today they can't say how they could do that even today they say they can't actually replicate what went into the pyramid the perfect math all of the placement of those heavy blocks how on on Earth could it happened but we know it was a revelation somewhere along the way someone somehow was given an inspiration a knowledge was revealed to them about something that they could actually make happen all of that to say we want to talk about the Revelation by the spirit now not just any spirit because there's many spirits but the revelation of the Holy Spirit and not just to the masses I think it's so important how brother brandham says this the importance of Revelation by the spirit to who only to a True Believer only the True Believer is going to have the ability to catch this Revelation and brother Bram talks about it but I'm just going to jump ahead a little bit because you can take a look in early on in the Bible the Book of Genesis Abel he had a revelation he had a thought somehow somewhere along the way he had the ability to know that God wasn't looking for the best of the land he wasn't looking for the fruit he wasn't looking for the best flowery display he wasn't looking for the worship choir he wasn't looking for the best performance he wasn't looking for the best attire he wasn't looking for all the best everything of of that anyone could offer them what he wanted was a bloody sacrifice am he wanted able to take a stone or a knife and chop the neck of a bleeding lamb and we know that Cain said oh he's a fanatic oh that guy look at him he's always been a fanatic he's always talked about these visions and dreams maybe Revelations that God has given him but we know both were raised by the same parents why didn't Cain have the same idea right it was a revelation by the spirit to a True Believer now some might say well brother Barry the Holy Spirit wasn't given then but you know they had pretty close access to God that's right that's right Adam his dad was the son of God Amen so I would say he had pretty close contact to the spirit but maybe it could be disputed I I don't know I think we could get get that that could take us into that whole discussion brother Brown talks about a little bit later in the church AG book how they were torn the whole world was torn up over what is it the the sound of two different syllables in the same word called a dip thong we could get hung up on on on semantics on a simple little thing but how about we just look at this and think about how this Spirit to a True Believer we can never overemphasize the importance of it and that's why we come to church amen I know I said it in the prayer but many times we could be preaching talking about a specific thing and people's brains will be firing about something else they'll be out on a different planet somewhere but not necessarily thinking about sinful things not necessarily thinking about different things they'll be thinking about the word of God in a different way and I can say by experience from preaching I would listen to a minister preaching I would listen to brother Ken just preaching his heart out and I would be putting together a sermon in my heart I'd be thinking man this is great Yeah the more that he preaches the more I say Amen the more I'm getting Revelation about the word I'm thinking about different scriptures God's speaking to me individually it's revelation of the spirit amen Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized and that's why I think we could just go on and on and on I could never overemphasize this right we could never say Amen too much about Revelation by the spirit he goes on to say Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation and you I'm talking about all Revelation it's tremendous important to the church you know I think this is beautiful because it is the most important thing to the church because it is the new birth brother bradam says it very clearly in the message of the hour the new birth is what it's God revealing himself making himself known personally to the individual amen how does that happen that's Revelation but when that happens that's when people go out on the street corners and start start banging on a box and saying I don't care who's looking at me I don't care who's listening I want to get the word of God out to this world because he has spoken to my heart individually and once that happens it'll never a person can never go back from that amen never if God has ever spoken to an individual now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation and you you just clarifies that so good I'm talking about all Revelation it's tremendously important to the church so that's all Revelation brothers and sisters when we read a scripture and and we begin to recognize wait a second that's that sounds like another scripture in my heart and you you think about it and you maybe you have to go on your search and maybe you can just look it up in your Bible because you know it that well whatever it is you know that God speaks to you and that is the white between the words brother bradam said it you have to be able to read between the lines every scripture has a compound what Revelation and compound meaning yes I've heard it said that there's more white on each page than there is black or red there's more room to read between the lines than there is actually lines of words amen but that's the word of God he'll reveal himself however he will Amen brother bam goes on to say do you remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the disciples this question whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say thou art John sorry I'm getting ahead of myself here this is where I wanted to get to this tab and put a plug in for this book because in the in the original text and I'm sure this is the same um Matthew 16 do you remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the disciples a question who do men say that I the son of man am and they said some art say that thou art John the Baptist what this book does here is it actually brings up the Scripture it separates the scripture it'll say it says Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the disciples a question whom do men say that I the son of man have man am and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elijah others Jeremiah or of the prophets he saith unto them but who say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven yes and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock will I build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and at the bottom of that it says Matthew 16: 13 to18 so it separates the actual scripture out of the page of text whereas this is all just text that goes on the original Church age book the blue ones that's how it was printed but this one here actually separates it out it's it's pretty convenient if anybody's interested we have themen it's so important for us to recognize how he was doing it what what he was doing it's just beautiful because Revelation is what it takes for a Believer brother Bram goes on to say I'll just pick up here in mind um he says the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it the Roman Catholics say the church is built upon Peter now that's really carnal how could God build the church Upon A man so unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while doing it yeah God can't build his church upon any man born in sin and it wasn't some rock lying there as though God had hallowed the ground at that spot and it isn't as the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus it was the Revelation amen amen I love the way he says it read it the way it's written Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but my father hath revealed it and Upon This Rock revelation will I build my church the church is built on Revelation on thus saith the Lord the church is not built upon a man the church isn't built upon a theology but it's interesting I have a lot of quotes tonight that I'm going to bring from the revelation of Jesus Christ in 1960 and a lot of the inspiration for this book starts there if you're interested by all means uh take a look at some of the quotes in there but some of it's just profound when you when you take a look at what he was saying back then in 1960 um paragraph 143 it's 1960 D 1204m the revelation of Jesus Christ paragraph 143 brother B I'm I'm jumping way ahead in here but I just wanted to bring this point out because I think it's so pertinent even today you know this is all about Revelation what we believe in the message of the hour is all about Revelation and this is where people say that William Bram went off I I I had said it's paragraph 143 if that's what you were wondering sorry brother paragraph 143 of the revelation of Jesus Christ we know brother Bram talks about it very clearly in the church age book he talks about it in this message he talks about in other places as well Satan hates two books books of the Bible more than any he hates the Book of Genesis because it shows his origin it shows that he was an upright being in the garden he came and entered that upright being he wasn't that upright being I should back up but the serpent was that upright being and we know that upright being was cursed to crawl on its belly and eat dust all the days of its life and that's why humans can never find that Gene connection between chimpanzees and man there's no animal connection that was it that was the one connection but God cursed it so far that there's no way a human being is ever going to get it but Satan hates the Book of Genesis and he hates the Book of Revelation because Genesis shows his beginning he shows his evil ways how he got into the race of mankind and the re Book of Revelation shows his destruction he hates those two books Because he believes them he knows the word of God but paragraph 143 the revelation of Jesus Christ so then you see why Satan is so against the Book of Revelation talking about Revelation talking about all Revelation along with the Book of Revelation so then you see why Satan is so against the Book of Revelation anything that's revealed spiritual Revelation Satan is against it right he doesn't want people hearing from God directly he wants people to hear from a man because he knows a man is fallible he knows that if he can get people to hear from a man then he's going to go and infect that man he'll put a virus in that man and cause that man to take people away yes but if people are taught the right way don't listen to a man don't let any man be your influence listen to God then you'll have success but Satan knows that better than any Theologian does and that's why Satan wants people to believe you have to believe in theology you have to believe that theology is the way that's why when you start to talk about Revelation to people who are theologians then they start to get a little uncomfortable maybe even break a little bit of sweat because you're talking about things that maybe they don't know about they're taught to hold to the theology to hold to the theological way to say that I was taught in school I've got a degree that shows me this but did God show you that because if God didn't show you that and it just came from a school what are you holding on toen so then you see why Satan is so against the Book of Revelation anything gets revealed spiritual Revelation Satan is against it he doesn't want us to believe that we're saved right he doesn't want us to believe that we're healed but both of those are why he died that's right both of them he says that's why he's so against the ministry today because what is it the revealing of Christ now he was talking in 1960 back there and some might want to get hung up on the dip thong Theory it was 1960 and brother Bram was talking about it this was a prophet he was prophetically uttering and I believe that this applies to today there's a reason why people just want to press play there's a reason for it the only reason for that brothers and sisters is because the devil's behind it now that's hard and people I know are quiet saying brother Barry how could you say that but if that's the only way you're going to actually worship God it's incorrect but to press play and be a part of a fellowship and go to church and worship and be amongst Believers there's something about that brothers and sisters the five-fold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints any other way is against the Revelation that we've been given for our day amen I think it's beautiful that brother Brandon would say it because what is it it's the revealing of Christ that's why he's so against the ministry today amen he's not after the Anglican and the Catholics and the Baptists and the Pentecostals all of the denominational churches but what he is after is after the denomination of the message the people that want to denominate and say we've got to hurry up and try and protect this now we've seen a great move of God in our midst let's make sure that we keep it in our midst brothers and sisters we don't want to try and do it let God do it give it to God any true Minister will promote Jesus Christ and any true Minister will promote the revelation of Jesus Christ to the individual but only by the word of God Amen not by theology I just thought this was so profound listening to this today so then you see why Satan is so against the Book of Revelation anything that's revealed spiritual Revelation Satan's against it that's why he's so against the ministry today because what is it it's the revealing of Christ I think it's just incredible as we gather together in his name as we Fellowship around the message of the hour as we talk about the exposition of the seven Church ages what is it brothers and sisters it's the revealing of Christ it's the revealing of Christ it's the revealing of Christ and I believe Satan hates it with all of his heart he has the guns of Hell trained upon us but we love it Revelation is fresh Revelation is pure amen Revelation from God will never ever compromise it will never come contrary to the word of God and that's what I wanted to say early on but I got sidetracked how will you know if your Revelation that's coming into your heart the thoughts and the ideas are correct you take it back to the word of God brother Bram says give it the word test if you can give it to the word and give it the word test and it lines up with the word of God then just praise the Lord brothers and sisters you got every reason to scream and shout to jump up and down maybe to do summer Sals to thank the Lord because not everyone in this world gets that if we have been given Revelation we've got every single reason to praise the Lord in uh in the revelation of Jesus Christ right at the very beginning it's paragraph 4 brother Bram says but the reason for this special time he's talking about the introducing of this topic now just going back I know I jumped way ahead there with that last quote but he says the reason for this special time was that we would upon my heart the Holy Spirit had laid this warning of conviction that the church in this day should have this message because I believe that it's the most outstanding messages of the Bible because it reveals Christ in his church at this time amen we have the prophet saying this is what God's laid on my heart and this is why I want to bring it to the church he goes on to say then no one no one can have faith or know what they're doing or where they're going unless they have something to base their thoughts and faith upon aren't you thankful that God sent a prophet amen therefore if the scripture has revealed Christ to us in these last days and the condition of time it would do us good to search it and find out where we're at yes am and so we know that he's talking about the seven Church ages and this is the the first three chapters of the Book of Revelation and brother bradam he breaks it up we'll read the quote I think it's so good though he says it so clearly in the revelation of Jesus Christ I'm not sure if he says it that way in the in the exposition of seven Church ages but he says that Revelation is broken up into three parts the first part is the introduction of the church the second part is the is uh I'm going to read it I'm going to confuse myself here he just breaks it up into three parts it's it's really really good the way he says it in the revelation of Jesus Christ paragraph 11 it never dawned upon my heart so much until the last election and then I seen where where we're at the Holy Spirit began to reveal to me to warn the people and to place this and I cannot do it in a church like this sufficiently and then if I sat down and just wrote the book I feel that if I got to the pulpit and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit amongst the Christians Came Upon me to help me then I would be more sufficient to write the book then after I took it off the tape because there we'd get the inspiration of it and I I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters if you haven't listened to this you can hear the inspiration of this book by listening to this message by listening to the subsequent messages as well because we get the inspiration of it the books of course will be kind of straightened up a little gramar tized I say because in here we put things in that we could not put in the book and then we take too much time on repeating ourselves or I do and then in the book it'll all be straightened out but we're going to try to get it as much as we can on tapes this was 5 years before the book was released 1960 brother Bram talking about this it's just wonderful I'll just continue reading in paragraph 25 here the revelation of Jesus Christ he says this morning I am starting the first chapter of revelation of the Book of Revelation and Revelation is set in three parts and the first three chapters is what we'll be dealing with in these eight days when one Church age could take us a month but we'll just have to hit the high places as we call it and when you get the book it'll be written out more in detail I think it's just beautiful that he keeps referring to the book and and for anyone that's wondering this is the book the exposition of the seven Church ages I know we all know that but there could be people that maybe listen tune in or what have you paragraph 26 here he says now Revelation the first three chapters speaking of the Book of Revelation the last book in the Bible deals with the church then the church disappears we see it no more until the end time from Revelations 1:3 is the church Revelations 4-9 is Israel and a nation and 19 to 22 is both together and the plagues and the warnings and so forth at the end said in three parts see and we're taking the first three chapters pertaining to the church and the church age that we're living in now first it may seem kind of dry I love that he says this because it can seem that way I'm sorry on a Wednesday night it can be that way but now first it may seem kind of dry because we have to go back and make a foundation I prayed and studied and done everything that I could to try to get the feeling of the Holy Spirit which way to set this that the people will see it and that you might in seeing it be enlightened and cause you to come closer to Christ for we're at the end time amen I just thought that was so good because right there brothers and sisters that just goes directly ties directly in with Ephesians chapter 1 Verse 18 do you want to just turn there with me tonight Ephesians 1 verse 18 I'm just going to read out of uh the Strong's Concordance while you're turning there it's g54 61 enlightened fiso for tids and it's from G 5457 it says to shed rays that is to shine or transitively to brighten up literally or figuratively Enlighten ex illuminate bring to give light to make see Ephesians 1 verse 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened amen that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and the riches of the glory of his inheritance to the Saints speaking to you and I tonight the Saints those people at the end of time so here we have brother brandham saying um I'll just go back and read this that I could try to get the feeling of the Holy Spirit which way to set this that the people would see it and that you might in seeing it be enlightened and cause you to come closer to Christ for at the end we at the end time that we would be able to see what the riches of the glory of his inheritance to the Saints is and what is that brothers and sisters tonight we're talking about eternal life that's the bottom line here knowing that we know exactly where we stand if we were to step out of here and hit a patch of ice and go around a light pole and and Naturally Speaking expire in this life that we would actually know that we're not afraid we have no fear because we know that we've made it right with him we know what the riches of our inheritance are we know exactly all about this message of the hour out of paragraph 69 in in the revelation of Jesus Christ historians agree this is John's Life John lived the last of his years in the city of EP epis and died there isn't it interesting that before they put him on the aisle of patmas what did they do we we'll go Ahad into all of this later I just can't help but Jump Ahead sometimes what what did they do to him they were so upset with him they tried to boil him alive for 24 hours in oil and they couldn't kill him because he had a work to do I remember brother Ken saying something along the lines he was quoting a quote a man that's that's destined to hang he can't drown or or vice versa I can't remember exactly how he said that but it's so true if if we're destined for a certain thing nothing can harm us until we're actually completed what we're supposed to complete in this life am if we could just live our lives that way knowing that I I'm here serving the purpose the Eternal purpose of the king of kings and Lord of lords and nothing can harm me until I've served that purpose and once I've served serve that purpose then he will change my location he'll change my my body I'll have a body already waiting he says historians agree this is the life of John paragraph 69 John lived the last of his years in the city of Ephesus and died there he was on the aisle of patmas at the time he wrote the Book of Revelation it was not the story of his life but the story of Christ in future ages see it was a prophecy not the life of John not the life of Christ but prophesying of an age to come it was not his prophetic utterances right but the Lord's exaltations solemnly yes it was not the revelation of St John the Divine but the revelation of Christ the Lorden that's what this this is the revelation of Christ the lord Lord we're not looking at this from the position of not understanding we do understand the eyes of our understanding have been enlightened with this it's not something that we're poking and prodding at the in the dark at brother Bram he says in in the Revelation uh in the exposition of the seven Church ages sorry I'm jumping back and forth brother Logan you're doing really good with it bear with me it's paragraph six I believe the Roman Catholics say that the church is built upon Peter now that is really carnal how could God build the church Upon A man so unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while doing it he can't build his church upon any man born in sin and it wasn't a rock wasn't some rock lying there as though God had hallowed the ground at that spot and it isn't as the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus it was the Revelation the understanding read it the way it's written Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but my father hath revealed it and Upon This Rock revelation will I build my church the church is built upon Revelation on thus sayith the Lord in this message 1960 I didn't bring it tonight brother Bram talks about how theology is what gets in the way of Revelation the theologians don't like Revelation I touched on a little bit earlier but we'll just let it go now the the theological understanding does not like Revelation they want everyone to conform to a certain way Satan hates Revelation because that is the new birth we've said it already I'll say it again though when we get the Revelation that Christ Jesus is Lord we're able to push aside everything else in our life and allow him to have full control over our lives then nothing can stop us and Satan knows that better than most theologians how did Abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to God by faith he received the revelation of blood Cain didn't get such a revelation even though he had a commandment so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice isn't it amazing to think he had the right commandment but he still couldn't do it Abel had the Revelation and went ahead and did it and Cain had his own Revelation from his father and went ahead and did it but God didn't just leave him there God came back around and said hey you know what if you would just do like your brother you would be accepted too but if you choose not to do like your brother then sin lith at your door and death will surely follow but what did he do he got mad and we talked about this because he had different attributes didn't he he was manifesting the attributes of his father but Abel was manifesting the attributes of his father amen same mother two fathers right right we could get into that we will eventually I'm sure it was a revelation from God that made the difference and gave Abel eternal life now you might take what the pastor says or what the Seminary teaches and though it might be taught to you with eloquence but until God reveals to you that Jesus is the Christ and that it is the blood that cleanses you and that God is your savior you will never have eternal life it's a spiritual Revelation that does that amen now I said this book Book of Revelation and the revelation of Jesus and what he's doing in the churches for those Seven Ages it is a revelation because the disciples themselves didn't know these recorded truths it had not been previously revealed to them you remember that they came to Jesus in the book of Acts and asked him are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel and he said it's not for you to know the times of the seasons those men were still thinking of Jesus having an Earthly Kingdom but it was a spiritual Kingdom that he was going to build even he could not tell them about his place in it for the father had not revealed it unto him it's a very difficult thing to understand that the father could not have revealed it unto him even though he was the father manifest in flesh and we know that that's what the scripture says amen but we're not going to get into that tonight either we're just going to carry on here par arph 10 but now after his death and resurrection and at this particular time in his mediatorial ministry he is able to set forth here in this revelation of himself to John what his glory and presence in the church would mean and do in this Revelation he tells us what the end of the devil is he tells us how he's going to deal with the devil and cast him into the lake of fire I just believe he doesn't want me to say those words I think he doesn't like us all hearing those words I think he knows this word better than all most theologians do but he is going to cast him into the Lake of Fire he reveals the end of the wicked ones who follow Satan and Satan hates that have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books in the Bible more than all others through liberal theologians and pseudo scientists he's always attacking the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelation in both of these books we find Satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction that is why he attacks them he hates to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is I just want to jump ahead so bad but I have to just I hope it's okay we just take our time we'll just go through this book and we'll we'll read it together it's going to take a while but there's so much in here I think it's so important Jesus said about Satan he has no part in me and I have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word and I want to throw this in there Satan has moved from Beyond just destroying confidence in the word even though that's the that's the bottom line that that really is the objective but what he has done in the minds and hearts of people genuine when people good people who believe this message of the hour who want to believe this message of the hour what he does is he destroys confidence in those people about the five-fold ministry because if they would actually believe the word if they would follow the word entirely they would have faith in the five-fold ministry because they would believe it's not the five-fold ministry it's not just some man chirping off at the pulpit it's the Lord Jesus Christ working on the desires in their hearts amen the word Jesus said about Satan he has no part in me I have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word and I'll say and the ministry right yes but when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her and that's why I say tonight brothers and sisters if you can't sit under a Ministry go find a Ministry find someone that you can have confidence in so that the spirit can actually reveal himself to you because that's how he does it is through the five-fold ministry amen we can listen to tapes and that's good there's nothing wrong with listening to tapes so long as that's not our only way there's still a five-fold Ministry amen he goes on to talk about I'll just read it verse chapter 14 let me just put in a word here for my own Ministry if you don't mind you all know that this gift in my life is Supernatural it's a gift whereby the holy spirit is able to discern diseases and the thoughts of men's hearts and other hidden things that only God could know and then reveal to me I wish I could stand I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed right now it isn't the people that I'm talking about it is that Satan has got a hold of their lives through sin in indifference and disease I I I think take note of those three things sin indifference and disease Satan gets a hold in people's lives this is what he's saying here but you should see their faces Satan knows he's going to be exposed and the most peculiar changes come over people's countenances Satan is afraid I want to say it tonight brothers and sisters amen he's the same yesterday today and forever yes he is and this I'll tell you the difference between the five-fold ministry and the Prophet this is just my opinion but I can say by experience i' I've experienced this the difference between the prophet is the prophet can look at a person while he's preaching and and he can discern the thoughts and the intents that's in the heart of the individual but when you get into the five-fold ministry they can't determine whose thoughts are are actually happening why they're actually going a certain way but it's the spirit of the Lord through Revelation that is causing that minister to preach what he's preaching right amen the word of God is Discerning the thoughts and the intents of the heart amen and you can see it on the faces of the people when you're preaching the most peculiar looks come across their faces when you can see that the spirit of the Lord is Discerning it right amen and sometimes people get upset about it they think that maybe someone's been talking or whatever I know I've said this so many times but it's so important brothers and sisters to recognize if you're hearing something discern speak to you directly don't automatically assume that someone's having a carnal conversation if you've come here asking the Lord to talk to you if you've come here to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ then he's speaking to you give him pray say Amen because this is the way that he's ordained for the Perfection of the Saints amen the only way it's going to work though is to say what the prophet said we've got to preach this message of the hour but when we do it will change the hearts of the people it will discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart it has to otherwise it's a different God it's a different word but he's the same yesterday today and forever amen my let me just put in a word here from my own Ministry if you don't mind you all know that this gift in my life is Supernatural it's a gift whereby the holy spirit is able to discern diseases the and the thoughts of men's hearts and other hidden things that only God could know and then revealed to me I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed it's not people it's Satan knows he's going to be exposed now it isn't the people that I'm talking about here it's that Satan has got a hold in their lives through sin indifference and disease but you should see their faces Satan knows he's going to be exposed and the most peculiar changes come over the people's countenances Satan is afraid tonight Brothers and Sisters Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and so is Satan right he gets afraid when the word of God comes to town yes and we love it amen he knows that the spirit of God is about to let the people know of his works that's why he hates these meetings so much when names are called diseases are revealed Satan hates it now what is this it's not mind reading it's not telepathy nor is it Witchcraft and I'll say it's not people talking about people it's not gossip it is the Lord Jesus Christ ministering to the church brother bradam says it's Revelation by the Holy Ghost beautiful is he says that's the only way I can know it of course the carnal mind will call it anything but the Holy Ghost so brothers and sisters if the word of God discerns something going on in your life don't don't call it carnally anything else say it's the Holy Ghost amen I want to say this and I'm sure that everyone would agree to me with me on this point and it's too bad we don't have more people here tonight but I would say this brothers and sisters this Church Calgary Living Word assembly is not about any one man it's not about any one board this church is founded on the revelation of Jesus Christ to the church in Calgary this is all about Jesus Christ so if you've come here and you hear the word of God ministering to you it's the Lord Jesus Christ it's a revelation amen and you have a reason to Rejoice Oh my he says let me show you another reason why Satan hates This Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever and changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways thus Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be we still got 16 minutes let's turn over to Mark 16 quickly let's go there mark Matthew Mark 16 let's just let's just underline this here I'm just going to read the last bit it's called the Great Commission Mark 16 we'll start with verse 15 Mark 16 in action is what he said Mark 16:1 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues yes they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover doesn't even say lay hands on the sick and pray for them it just says lay hands on the sick and they will recover amen but you know we've seen carnal impersonations of every single one of those I'm sure that we've seen them if you haven't I can tell you that you know they they have it going on they've they've impersonated William brandom and I believe believe there's even people out there who have the ability to cast out a devil for a moment but that Devil comes right back to the person people do that they impersonate that they speak with new tongues and we know that Devils speak with tongues don't they brother Bram said that the devil Satan can impersonate any gift in the church they speak with new tongues they can take up serpents there's people that do that snake handlers they call them once they get really inspired by the worship and and the music and everything that's going on then they bring out the snakes and they'll pass around the box of snakes and people can reach in and and grab a hold of a viper and they can dance with it and and get in the spirit and put it around their neck and then pass it over to someone else and you know they know that they've lived and they know they've got the spirit of God they're taking and impersonating carnally Mark 16 trying to put it into action but it's false right right they drank any deadly thing it shall not hurt them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover we know that both of those have been impersonated I'm not going to get into that too much tonight to to try and and make a deal of it but what I do want to just underline is these signs shall what follow the first thing is revelation the first thing is the word of God getting the spirit to reveal himself personally to the individual we can get that to happen then you know what there's no stopping a Believer all of those signs will follow amen but God don't clown for nobody going on here paragraph 17 now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defy it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless I think it's really sad to look at that but it's true it will come into the church and defile it but it will never come into the bride that's right amen it will never come into the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah the truly elect people will never have the the the Antichrist Spirit enter into her and cause her to be lukewarm formal and Powerless because the Bride of Jesus Christ will be the one that says I don't care who's here I don't care what's going on I've got an opportunity to worship God I'm going to worship God with all that I've got because I know what he's done for me I know that I'm redeemed and there's millions and billions of people in this world that think they're redeemed but they're truly not and other people that maybe would want to be redeemed but don't have any concept of redemption right but somehow God chose me and him before the foundation of the world it causes a reaction something happens it says he says it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people see that attempted destruction not destruction the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he can't stand it that's why he's coming against the ministry so hard and he's not coming against the ministry so hard with bulldozers and tanks is he he's coming as an angel of Light to say that maybe there's a another messenger maybe there's someone else who's prophetic maybe they are prophetic but there's only one Prophet amen amen there's only one major prophet to this age he's come he's delivered the message thus saith the Lord and God took him home now it's up to us to take that message and carry on with it am amen but if we do that we're not going to do it differently than the way the messenger said true we're going to do it exactly the way the messenger said to do it yes and how is that that's exactly according to the word of God Amen is is not deviating from the word of God and saying that the prophet's message supersedes the word of God that's where the Crux of the problem is that's where we get down to the nitty-gritty because somewhere someone is trying to say that we can actually circumvent uh the word of God I'm going to stop with that I apologize I shouldn't go too far but it's true brothers and sisters we need to put the word of God at the central theme of Our Lives this has to be our absolute because that's exactly what the prophet of God said he did not say take my word over the word of God if that was the case he would have said that he would have said there was a misinterpretation to the Bible and you need to actually redo that portion of the Bible but he said if you can't take my word take his word amen paragraph 19 says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works amen she will be an invincible Army amen thank you Lord amen if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church because it's not going to be the two Spirits out in the world it's not going to be the two Spirits in Hollywood it's not going to be the two Spirits in rock and roll amen it's not going to be the two Spirits in all of the rest of the worldly stuff it's going to be in the Christian church amen if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit not their own by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her amen he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert personally when I read this book I come to that place and I have to just close it and I feel like running around the tree screaming and Shing I feel like having a Pentecostal Revival am because this shows me that there is a time right here where Satan will be powerless there is a time where we don't have to wait for the chains that's not a logging chain where where Satan will be bound with the chain for a thousand years we don't have to wait until a specific time where chains of circumstance will bind Satan and throw him into the bottomless pit no we'll be able to bind him here he will actually be powerless before us but first we've got to be able to discern the spirit within the framework of the Christian church we got to understand that that Antichrist Spirit goes to church that's right that Antichrist Spirit wants to tell us don't have faith in a five-fold Ministry amen that Antichrist Spirit wants to tell us there's something better than the word of God you know what there's nothing better than the word of God because that's what the prophet of God said thus sayith the Lord yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against who against us the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them we don't have to worry about the Gates of Hell coming against us brothers and sisters tonight I just want to over over over overemphasize get the true Spirit of Revelation in our lives allow his Spirit to come into our lives and minister to us maybe there's something in our lives that we've said you know I can take most of the message of the hour but I just can't take that one part or or or maybe there's there's something about having the five-fold ministry and I can only just go so far and then and then you got to stop there because of whatever happened you know what I want to say just try God and see if he's not God just say God if you're God and this is the word that you gave through the prophet for our day then go ahead and reveal yourself to me through this Revelation and see if he won't yes and I guarantee you brothers and sisters he'll take you to a higher level he will take all of us to a higher level if we're willing to let them the only way we can let them though is to get down because the Way Up Is Down we've got to Humble ourselves we've got to Humble our pride we got to be willing to say maybe the things that I've been taught the things that I've I've thought for years maybe for decades I just want to push them all aside and say Lord be fresh unto me tonight Lord reveal yourself further unto me tonight help me to just tear off all the scar tissue and get down to the fresh meat of the matter give me fresh meat tonight Lord and see if he won't do it I guarantee you he will but you know what happens when we do that it gets a little bit scary and I know it I know it does but you know I also know the only way that you're going to get anywhere with God is to be willing to do that to take down all of the high places in our lives to tear down all of the idol all of the things that we've we've followed and allowed to grow to be taller than the word of God in our lives tear them down smash them down kick out the trash out of the house and see if God won't reveal himself in a greater way brothers and sisters Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us what are the gates of hell today now let's get on with it brothers and sisters is it television is it video games is it movies is it pornography where's all the gates of hell those are all gates of hell and if you're going to allow them to Prevail over you you don't have the right Revelation but if you've got that Revelation that we're talking about tonight they won't have any power over you and what will that look like in your life you'll say I don't want to watch a movie I don't want to play a stupid video game it's a waste of time what I want to do is talk about the Lord I want to talk about the going home of the church I want to recognize the day and hour in which I live in amen the whole Middle East is blowing up brothers and sisters I don't know how many nuclear bombs are just right there on Red Alert just ready to go and what the prophet of God says he says it in the revelation of Jesus Christ in 1960 before one of those bombs can go off the bride goes home am where are we at tonight are we going to let the Gates of Hell Prevail over us and our families or are we going to take this Revelation and Prevail over the gates of hell because it's not going to be a church it's not going to be a teacher it's not going to be an evangelist it's not going to be any great ministry it's only going to be the revelation of Jesus Christ to the individual personally and when that happens brothers and sisters there ain't going to be no Idols there's not going to be no Groves there's not going to be any high places there's not going to be any any any any of this stuff going on but it's just going to be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in our lives God bless you tonight I'll stop there and call the musicians I know we even have five minutes left but I feel like I'm getting a little too crazy here I'm just excited about this I know where we're at uh we can see it the handwriting is on the wall brothers and sisters it's not a time to play church it's time to recognize that there are Gates of Hell and we've been given a revelation to overcome them and not to let them run rough shod over us and to overcome us we have the ability to overcome them am maybe stand with me as we close let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we thank you for your word Lord thank thank you for this exposition of the seven Church ages Lord because we know it's way more than just a historical book but we know that it ties up a bunch of loose ends and we know that it ties up Loose Ends through Revelation amen hallelujah and we know that Satan hates Revelation but Lord we love it because we know that we can take it back to the Bible and say that in the very very beginning that it was a revelation for abble to bring a blood sacrifice and that it was a revelation yes oh Heavenly Father for Peter to say to you when you asked your disciples who do men say that I am we know that it was a revelation and you said so that it was given unto Peter from from your father which is in heaven it wasn't Flesh and Blood it wasn't a theology school teaching he wasn't taught that by flesh and blood but it was by your father which is in heaven father we just love you and we thank you tonight for the Revelation that you've given us thank you Father for saving our souls thank you Father for healing our bodies Lord Father for giving us the ability to recognize that yes indeed Mark 16

into the promised land get up and get ready and watch that Ark and don't get too far behind and don't get too close just keep in step father we pray that we could just keep in step with your word tonight we pray that you would just be with each one father maybe who is battling with the Gates of Hell father help us to stop battling the gates of hell and just to allow your spirit to reveal yourself further to us Lord that way we would know that those Gates of Hell have no power over us amen father we love you and we thank you we just want to commit each life into your hands father we pray that you would just be with sister Helen as she goes this week father to to Ghana father to Lord to celebrate the life of her dad her late father Lord we pray that you would just give her strength father and encouragement Lord we pray that you would just be with her family Lord Jesus back home while she's away that you would help them all to Lord just all together and fill in the gaps while Mommy's away and father we pray that you would just allow her to be a true blessing to the family back home Lord that she would just take your light back home and and shine it to the family all around that she would just be an encouragement father to everyone along the way oh God and that Lord at the appointed time you would bring her back home safely Lord father we pray that you would just help the hearts who are broken to heal Lord we know that there's no person that can do it it takes you father and we know that Lord there's holes that will never be filled on this side of Eternity but Lord you give us peace that passes all understanding and we pray for a special measure for the family Lord we just ask now that you would give us all traveling mercies as we go our separate ways
