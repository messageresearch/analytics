[43:45] I said I'm going to go on a fishinary
[43:46] trip
[43:47] and uh
[43:49] and while I'm up there I'll get to get
[43:52] to see some of the Saints and stop in
[43:54] and visit thank you all that'll be just
[43:57] fine if while you're standing
[43:59] amen our brothers praying for us and if
[44:01] you have your Bibles I'd like for you to
[44:04] turn with me
[44:06] Into the Book of Psalms
[44:08] and there we want to be in the
[44:11] 118th psalm
[44:14] uh
[44:16] it's a it's a little
[44:18] Evangelistic thought this evening a
[44:23] had a preacher one time said that that
[44:25] every Pastor needs to needs to go out
[44:28] and preach so he can see if he still
[44:30] knows how
[44:31] and so you get to doing you have to kind
[44:34] of change the venue to come and
[44:37] and to work as uh as as a Shepherd over
[44:41] the flock you know you have to you have
[44:43] to kind of change your your uh your
[44:47] Mantra just a little bit
[44:48] and try to be all things to all people
[44:53] and so uh sometimes you have to teach
[44:56] and sometimes you have to you know you
[44:58] have to preach hard and sometimes you
[45:00] have to just be very patient but you
[45:04] know with an evangelist you know you get
[45:06] to kind of just love them and leave them
[45:08] you know you just uh just throw your
[45:11] head back and and let the chips fall at
[45:14] the pastor take care of it and so uh we
[45:17] got to do that for many years always I
[45:19] told Brother Berry today I Never Had a
[45:21] Bad Day in Calgary I just have to say
[45:23] that always been a blessing to be here
[45:26] amen sister Shelly God bless you amen
[45:30] each one that every time we've ever come
[45:32] this way why the Lord has always blessed
[45:35] us amen and trust that he'll be a
[45:39] blessing this evening

[45:53] these times amen and we'll treat you so
[45:55] many ways you'll like one of them

[46:03] and uh so I think we're our church sits
[46:07] at about 7 000 feet elevation so bring
[46:10] your oxygen
[46:12] and then we and so we want to read here
[46:15] this evening just as a little thought as
[46:18] we
[46:19] try to be mindful of our time
[46:23] we want to begin reading at verse 22 18
[46:27] 118th Psalm and verse 22.
[46:32] the stone which the builders refused has
[46:35] become The Headstone of the corner
[46:39] and this is the Lord's doing it is
[46:42] marvelous in our eyes
[46:44] and this is the day which the Lord hath
[46:47] made we will rejoice
[46:50] and be glad in it
[46:52] may the Lord Jesus bless the reading of
[46:54] the word this evening as you make
[46:55] yourselves comfortable
[46:58] I want to
[47:00] title the message this evening
[47:03] if I may
[47:05] it's marvelous in our eyes and it is the
[47:09] Lord's doing
[47:11] and we want to uh just
[47:17] take this little thought
[47:19] um
[47:22] striking to me first of all
[47:25] as we look at this passage of scripture
[47:30] that each one of those verses are used
[47:33] many times independently of each other
[47:37] you see a beautiful day
[47:40] this is the day you know you see Sunday
[47:43] you come to church birds are singing
[47:45] It's a resurrection oh this is the day
[47:48] that the Lord has made let us rejoice
[47:50] and be glad in it you know you and you
[47:53] but you seldom uh uh incorporate that
[47:57] passage of scripture along with the
[48:01] stone that the builders rejected
[48:04] you know you just it your mind doesn't
[48:06] somehow another meld these two together
[48:09] and then whenever you begin to think
[48:12] about how you know you see something how
[48:14] that the Lord does something you say
[48:16] well it's the Lord's doing and it's
[48:18] marvelous you know and you give God
[48:20] praise for those things but in reality
[48:22] as we look here this evening that these
[48:26] three scriptures run in concert with
[48:29] each other that they're all three
[48:31] together and they're there for a very
[48:33] important reason
[48:35] did I fall down
[48:38] and uh and they're they're there
[48:40] together for a purpose that they that
[48:44] the that when the uh when the psalmist
[48:47] then places these things here so now we
[48:50] have to uh we have to look at this in
[48:53] the context that it was that it was
[48:56] pinned because it was it was they were
[48:58] placed together for a very important
[49:01] reason as we as we look at Psalms 118
[49:07] and verse 22 it speaks of the stone
[49:10] which the builders refuse now
[49:14] first and foremost that this scripture
[49:16] is actually dealing with the nation of
[49:19] Israel that this is speaking not not
[49:21] primarily because remember it's in the
[49:24] Old Testament prior to the coming of
[49:26] Christ
[49:27] David here in this Psalm of Thanksgiving
[49:30] he's actually pointing to a greater day
[49:32] a time because brother Brown said he
[49:34] would get in the spirit as these
[49:36] prophets would get in the spirit and
[49:37] they would begin to prophesy that they
[49:40] actually placed themselves they were
[49:42] under such an anointing that they spoke
[49:45] concerning themselves David in the 22nd
[49:49] Psalm said you know my God my God why is
[49:51] Thou forsaken me you know my bones they
[49:53] stare at me they pierce my hands and my
[49:55] feet and it begins to cry out as though
[49:58] he was the very one that was being
[50:00] crucified well in this in this Psalm of
[50:03] Thanksgiving he comes down into this
[50:06] place and he begins to speak about the
[50:08] stone which the builders have refused
[50:10] and he's speaking of the nation of
[50:12] Israel as a whole and that they because
[50:14] they were A persecuted Church they were
[50:16] a forsaken lot and so and they were and
[50:19] so so he's speaking of that as whole but
[50:22] then you realize that as he speaks of
[50:24] Israel then he also has to speak
[50:27] concerning the very headstone of Israel
[50:30] or the very the very uh the very capping
[50:33] of what that Zechariah would later
[50:37] prophesy concerning The Headstone that
[50:40] was going to come down and there's a
[50:42] rubable and and Joshua would be there
[50:45] building the church and and it was
[50:47] speaking of this one that would come
[50:49] that Daniel had saw this stone that
[50:52] would come out of the mountain that was
[50:54] that was cut out but with without the
[50:57] use of hands and then it would come down
[50:59] and it would strike the image of the
[51:03] Gentile ages in the feet and it would
[51:05] crush it in the feet it would destroy it
[51:07] grind it the powder and this very one
[51:09] well it would speak of would then be
[51:12] personified in the person of Christ
[51:16] and that what Christ then would become
[51:18] that headstone he would become that
[51:21] stumbling Stone and Paul then tells us
[51:23] to the Greeks it's foolishness to the to
[51:26] the Jews it's a stumbling Stone but to
[51:29] us it's the power of God unto salvation
[51:33] and so that there would be this this one
[51:35] that would come but then we realize that
[51:38] he the person of Christ would be
[51:41] personified amen through the baptism of
[51:44] the Holy Ghost into the New Testament
[51:46] Church and that New Testament Church
[51:48] then would be the one that would be
[51:50] crying Grace Grace unto itself and it
[51:53] would then materialize itself in the
[51:56] fruition because remember it was head
[51:59] and Corner he's Alpha and Omega
[52:02] Allelujah and so then he would come down
[52:04] at the end and be personified in the New
[52:07] Testament Church at the end time
[52:11] and so now as it begins to speak
[52:15] of this headstone this one this Builder
[52:17] would read how the builders would refuse
[52:20] that this has become the very the very
[52:24] Crux of the entire message
[52:27] would be this one stone this one that
[52:31] would actually be the very the the that
[52:34] Peter said you have become Lively stones
[52:38] Hallelujah that we are the Living Stones
[52:41] we're the ones that the the Temple of
[52:45] the Living God and this is what the
[52:49] world has rejected
[52:51] and we are the ones that the ends of the
[52:53] world have come upon and now the the
[52:56] very the very
[52:57] the very rejection and we're going to
[53:00] look at a couple of things here as we
[53:02] move along
[53:04] and so this one
[53:07] where the man preached to us a message
[53:08] called the rejected King
[53:10] now
[53:12] when he in this message
[53:16] of the Masterpiece as well
[53:19] he uses this text
[53:22] in Isaiah 53 and in Masterpiece he uses
[53:26] the whole chapter I'm going to take an
[53:28] excerpt
[53:29] from verse 10 Isaiah 53 and verse 10.
[53:34] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him
[53:37] now look at the language here
[53:40] he hath put him to grief and without
[53:43] shall make his soul and offerings shall
[53:46] for sin he shall see his seed he shall
[53:49] prolong his days and the pleasure of the
[53:53] Lord shall prosper in his hands so it's
[53:58] a it's pleases the lord it's a pleasure
[54:01] to bruise this one this one that the
[54:03] stone which the builders have refused
[54:06] that this is something that pleases the
[54:08] Lord
[54:09] because it goes into the next verse he
[54:11] said this is the Lord's doing
[54:13] and it's marvelous in her eyes so now
[54:16] then what what what the Lord took
[54:19] pleasure in
[54:21] smiting
[54:23] the Messiah
[54:25] that and and so this becomes
[54:27] to uh to our our mortality into our to
[54:31] our to our
[54:32] mentality the way that we think that
[54:35] this is a horrible thing
[54:37] that is a terrible that for them to
[54:39] reject the stone for them to forsake the
[54:43] very Chief and Cornerstone for the
[54:46] smiting of the Messiah to see him
[54:49] despise and rejected of men that this
[54:53] becomes that this is not a the the the
[54:56] language of pleasure and the language of
[54:59] pleasing is somehow alienated from these
[55:03] two thoughts but yet the psalmist says
[55:07] it's marvelous
[55:09] in our eyes that that because this is
[55:12] the Lord's doing that when God did these
[55:16] things
[55:16] oh he knew uh the the what the result of
[55:22] what was going to happen from the
[55:24] smiding from the rejection from the
[55:27] bleeding from the torture that was going
[55:30] to happen to Christ that was going to
[55:32] happen to the church through the Dark
[55:34] Ages because the more that they
[55:37] persecuted the church the further the
[55:39] church was able to expand they they went
[55:42] into all the world and began to preach
[55:45] the gospel they forsooked their their
[55:47] their their their homes they forsook
[55:49] their their wealth they forsook
[55:51] everything for the cause of the gospel
[55:53] and there's the more rejection that came
[55:55] upon the church the it was like a
[55:58] casting of seed upon the Earth and and
[56:01] they were the more they murdered them
[56:02] the more the people would surrender
[56:04] their lives to Christ the more that they
[56:07] that they they drove them into the
[56:09] Foreign Fields the more the gospel got
[56:11] spread and it was like shaking a
[56:13] dandelion
[56:16] you know you think you're going to pull
[56:17] that dandelion you better be careful
[56:20] when they get in full bloom and those
[56:22] little those little Tufts you know you
[56:24] better you you go out and mow those
[56:26] things you say well I'm gonna cut those
[56:28] things down well you just spread them
[56:31] and it's a casting of the seed amen it's
[56:33] a it's a it's a a further manifestation
[56:37] and it's a marvelous thing
[56:40] hallelujah it's marvelous in her eyes
[56:42] but it's the Lord's doing
[56:45] the more he smoothed him the more the
[56:48] the more that he he uh persecuted the
[56:51] more despised he became the more
[56:54] rejected he came the more they forsook
[56:56] the Builder the the Cornerstone the
[56:59] greater the population of the church
[57:01] became
[57:06] but it's the Lord's doing
[57:08] in First Peter chapter 2
[57:13] it begins at verse 8.
[57:15] it says a stone of stumbling
[57:18] a rock of offense
[57:21] even to them which stumble at the word
[57:24] being disobedient where unto also they
[57:28] were appointed
[57:29] they were appointed to their
[57:31] disobedience
[57:32] there's a there was a group that was
[57:33] called to obedience and there was
[57:35] children of Disobedience of which we
[57:37] were one time identified but now through
[57:40] the Regeneration through the for the new
[57:43] birth there's a change that comes he
[57:46] says watch but but
[57:49] ye
[57:51] H ye means me
[57:54] Hallelujah ye means you
[57:57] you are a chosen generation
[58:02] oh think about it Church a royal
[58:05] priesthood
[58:09] awoke Nation
[58:12] so I throw that in there
[58:14] oh we're awoke all right the seals amen
[58:18] woke us up
[58:20] Hallelujah and made us a holy nation of
[58:24] peculiar people that you should show
[58:26] forth the Praises of him that hath
[58:28] called you out of Darkness into this
[58:32] Marvelous Light
[58:35] Hallelujah so with Marvelous Light in
[58:39] the end time and laodicea he said they
[58:42] would be blind they would be miserable
[58:44] they'd be wretched they would be naked
[58:46] but he said get some ice half anoint
[58:50] your eyes that you could see why because
[58:52] with ice have amen marvelous light
[58:55] shines into your marvelous eyes that you
[58:58] can see marvelous things
[59:01] oh praise be to God
[59:04] so this we're a chosen generation
[59:08] were chosen to see marvelous things
[59:12] we're chosen to see with Marvelous Light
[59:17] I was sharing with the church the other
[59:19] day that when I was a young man
[59:21] and some of you raised in Snow Country
[59:23] you understand this I got out playing
[59:25] with a young man and I got what they
[59:28] call snow blind I got my eyes burnt with
[59:30] the with the bright sunlight because we
[59:32] didn't have sunglasses we were just kids
[59:33] we're out there playing in that snow in
[59:35] the bright Sun shining on it reflected
[59:37] off and got my face all burnt and my
[59:40] eyes got burnt I couldn't see for a
[59:41] couple of days and and then later at
[59:43] different times of you know out welding
[59:45] and I'll be spot welding in your kind of
[59:47] look and turn your head you know pull
[59:48] your hood down and you know you spot
[59:50] weld a lot and that that flash of that
[59:53] of that uh that welder burnt the redness
[59:56] of my eyes and so it you know just just
[59:59] abused myself as a you know as a you
[1:00:01] know we're rednecks you know we just we
[1:00:04] just do what we're not supposed to do
[1:00:05] and and so over time that my eyes have
[1:00:10] become very sensitive to the to the Sun
[1:00:13] and to bright sunlight into like snow
[1:00:15] and and like days like today where it
[1:00:17] was really bright and I ran off and left
[1:00:19] my sunglasses and so so I said well
[1:00:22] tomorrow I know where I'm going I'm
[1:00:23] going to Bass Pro I'm going to give you
[1:00:25] some or Cabela's whichever one it is and
[1:00:27] I'm gonna get me some some sunglasses so
[1:00:29] and uh but I got to thinking about that
[1:00:32] and that this is Marvelous Light
[1:00:36] and so in Marvelous Light you can see
[1:00:38] marvelous things
[1:00:40] but yet that so there's many times that
[1:00:43] church people especially message people
[1:00:45] that they come in to The Marvelous Light
[1:00:49] but because of damage and because of
[1:00:53] Disobedience and because of fears and
[1:00:56] all these different things and many
[1:00:58] times it's just a lack of experience
[1:01:00] with God that they want to put on some
[1:01:02] kind of tinted lens
[1:01:06] so that they can take a certain amount
[1:01:08] of Truth
[1:01:09] but they can't take the full
[1:01:12] illumination
[1:01:13] that there's a certain part of it that
[1:01:16] they're willing oh I can see that God
[1:01:17] sent a prophet wonderful
[1:01:19] I can see that water baptism in the name
[1:01:21] of the Lord Jesus wonderful I can see
[1:01:23] one God that's great I can you know I
[1:01:25] can see the serpent seed oh wonderful
[1:01:29] but holiness
[1:01:32] oh I better I can't I can't take that
[1:01:34] because that that goes against what I
[1:01:37] what I want
[1:01:39] you know I want I want I want to filter
[1:01:43] the message through my filter
[1:01:46] but we can't do that because brother
[1:01:47] bear said if you have a thinking man's
[1:01:50] filter
[1:01:52] then you will have a holy man's taste
[1:01:55] and so when it comes to Holiness we find
[1:01:58] that people in the in and we're finding
[1:02:01] it more and more that they're you know
[1:02:04] the makeup's coming back you know the
[1:02:06] shorter skirts are coming back tight
[1:02:08] clothes are coming back you know men are
[1:02:10] wearing jewelry and and and and and and
[1:02:13] bracelets and necklaces and all kinds of
[1:02:16] things are coming back and you're saying
[1:02:18] where did that come from it's because
[1:02:19] they're not able to look at Marvelous
[1:02:22] Light
[1:02:23] they're looking at filtered light but
[1:02:25] the Bible says that we have come into
[1:02:27] out of Darkness into this Marvelous
[1:02:31] Light That Eagles are able to look
[1:02:33] directly at the Sun and go into the Sun
[1:02:36] and then look down because they've
[1:02:38] absorbed the light now they're the the
[1:02:40] pupil is opened up and now they can take
[1:02:44] in the full illumination they can look
[1:02:46] down and see fresh kill amen from great
[1:02:50] altitudes
[1:02:52] and now we've sworn up Amen in prophetic
[1:02:57] ability
[1:02:59] to look down and see
[1:03:01] fresh kill
[1:03:03] not some
[1:03:05] decomposed
[1:03:07] you know uh Roadkill
[1:03:10] but no this is this is this is the
[1:03:12] message of Marvelous Light
[1:03:18] in times past we were not a people but
[1:03:21] are now the people of God
[1:03:25] which have obtained Mercy
[1:03:27] which had not obtained Mercy but now
[1:03:29] have obtained Mercy
[1:03:32] this word
[1:03:34] that's used here in the phrase Marvelous
[1:03:38] Light it's also used there in the Old
[1:03:42] Testament as the English word marvelous
[1:03:45] but they're they're actually a little
[1:03:47] bit different they have app they could
[1:03:50] be applied the same way but they're I
[1:03:53] know I kind of bring you the comparison
[1:03:56] when David uses this
[1:03:59] this uh
[1:04:01] this word in Psalms 18 23 that it is
[1:04:05] marvelous in our eyes
[1:04:08] what he's showing us how the the the the
[1:04:10] stone being rejected
[1:04:13] and and and and and and being forsaken
[1:04:17] and uh
[1:04:20] and
[1:04:21] that that the to look at that and to see
[1:04:24] it in the in light of Isaiah 53 and to
[1:04:27] see it in light of Psalms 22 and and all
[1:04:31] the Messiah signs that speak of the
[1:04:33] Messiah prophecies that concern the
[1:04:36] crucifixion of the Lord Jesus and so
[1:04:38] when he uses this word marvelous in this
[1:04:40] in the in the in the Hebrew text it
[1:04:43] actually lends to the to the definition
[1:04:46] of difficult
[1:04:48] the word marvelous actually means not
[1:04:51] like not like it is in the New Testament
[1:04:53] but it means more that this is difficult
[1:04:57] this is hard for us to look at
[1:04:59] that this is hard for us to comprehend
[1:05:02] that our comprehension of the of of this
[1:05:06] Stone being rejected of this of this
[1:05:08] despising of the stone this despising of
[1:05:11] the Messiah this crucifixion this
[1:05:14] piercing of the hands this one that they
[1:05:16] that they knew that was going to be God
[1:05:18] and flesh and that how that he was going
[1:05:20] to be relative because brother I'm
[1:05:22] asking the the the rabbi he asked him he
[1:05:25] said what relationship does uh Christ
[1:05:28] have to God he said he will be God and
[1:05:31] so they understood that and so all Jews
[1:05:34] understood that this one that would come
[1:05:36] that he would be Isaiah 53 that he would
[1:05:38] come but yet he would be despised he
[1:05:41] would be rejected he would be he would
[1:05:43] be his the chastisement of our peace
[1:05:46] would be laid upon him and so the Jews
[1:05:48] understood that and when he looked at
[1:05:50] this and said he said the stone that is
[1:05:52] rejected this is difficult for our eyes
[1:05:56] that's what he was saying it's marvelous
[1:05:58] it's it's big it's terrible they
[1:06:00] actually use the word terrible in some
[1:06:02] places that it's a terrible thing and so
[1:06:04] much that it's that it's that it's
[1:06:06] drastic
[1:06:07] this is this is a this is a this is a
[1:06:09] big thing that's going on here and it's
[1:06:11] really hard for us to to comprehend it's
[1:06:14] difficult for us to comprehend but then
[1:06:16] when Peter then comes over and he's
[1:06:18] talking about the same verses scripture
[1:06:20] and he's and he says now then he said
[1:06:23] the stone of stumbling this rock of
[1:06:25] offense
[1:06:26] he said but he he's called us
[1:06:30] to be able to see this because of
[1:06:32] Marvelous Light
[1:06:34] and so this Marvelous Light that's used
[1:06:36] in the New Testament
[1:06:38] actually speaks of
[1:06:40] a uh a pious
[1:06:43] admiration
[1:06:45] admirable
[1:06:47] excellent
[1:06:48] it lends to the thought of passing human
[1:06:52] comprehension
[1:06:55] so think about it that you're a chosen
[1:06:57] generation
[1:07:00] that have been chosen to comprehend
[1:07:03] something
[1:07:05] that is beyond human comprehension so
[1:07:09] now that our human comprehension is is
[1:07:11] now uh uh unable to comprehend what God
[1:07:17] is doing but it's something that the
[1:07:19] Lord is doing but yet you've been chosen
[1:07:21] and with the choosing you've been
[1:07:23] pressurized you've been you've been uh
[1:07:26] illuminated you've been given marvelous
[1:07:29] highs by marvelous ice have to see
[1:07:32] Marvelous Light to understand marvelous
[1:07:34] things that are so far beyond human
[1:07:37] comprehension that we cannot grasp it
[1:07:40] humanly oh but but the new birth allows
[1:07:44] us to supernaturally step away from our
[1:07:47] from our uh uh uh uh uh uh human ability
[1:07:51] and say but Lord I see this but I don't
[1:07:54] understand it it's amazing to me that I
[1:07:58] even understood I've even called to this
[1:08:00] message I wouldn't have never called
[1:08:02] myself I never tried to call myself but
[1:08:05] this is amazing grace and it's a Beyond
[1:08:08] human apprehension and it's outside of
[1:08:11] my human ability but yet God has called
[1:08:13] me to it
[1:08:19] that it's it's beyond human
[1:08:21] comprehension it this word uh marvelous
[1:08:26] means
[1:08:27] causing amazement
[1:08:31] I'm Amazed
[1:08:33] that he loves me
[1:08:35] Hallelujah I'm Amazed
[1:08:37] that he called me I'm Amazed
[1:08:40] that's why it's amazing grace
[1:08:43] it's amazement joined with Terror
[1:08:48] Oh I thought Lord Jesus
[1:08:51] the Bible says behold
[1:08:53] the goodness
[1:08:55] and the severity of God
[1:08:57] that until you can understand the
[1:09:00] severity you can never really appreciate
[1:09:03] the goodness
[1:09:06] and when you've received the goodness of
[1:09:08] God and you see what the alternative was
[1:09:11] then you see the terror
[1:09:13] behold the goodness and the severity of
[1:09:18] God
[1:09:20] it means that it's striking that it's
[1:09:23] extraordinary it's surprising
[1:09:26] how many times has the word surprised
[1:09:29] you
[1:09:30] that it just shocked you brother Brandon
[1:09:33] said it's striking
[1:09:35] over and over he says strike isn't the
[1:09:38] Striking how that the Lord would do a
[1:09:41] certain thing a certain way and and and
[1:09:44] reveal something to you through such
[1:09:46] simplicity
[1:09:48] oh my
[1:09:51] it's it's a wonder
[1:09:55] and I got to thinking about the
[1:09:58] different wonders
[1:10:00] of the world
[1:10:02] that as man and is it in his exploration
[1:10:07] that he found these things in men and
[1:10:10] accomplishments that men did there so
[1:10:12] you have different things it's called
[1:10:14] the ancient wonders of the world like
[1:10:16] the Great Pyramids
[1:10:18] you know the Sphinx the Wall of China
[1:10:21] uh
[1:10:22] uh you know uh
[1:10:25] Leaning Tower peace these different
[1:10:27] things were wonders
[1:10:29] of the ancient world
[1:10:31] that man actually did and then they got
[1:10:35] credit
[1:10:37] accredited for those things
[1:10:39] but then there was what they called the
[1:10:42] natural wonders of the world
[1:10:44] and so you had different things and
[1:10:47] there's there basically seven of them
[1:10:50] we'll need to go into all of them but
[1:10:52] there was you know different ones uh we
[1:10:55] have some African folk with us so they
[1:10:57] understand along the what is it Zambia
[1:11:00] and uh Zimbabwe you have the you have
[1:11:03] the the Victoria Falls maybe somebody
[1:11:06] knows about those things they're they're
[1:11:08] there in Africa they have one of the
[1:11:10] great wonders of the world there's one
[1:11:12] in in Asia uh called Mount Everest
[1:11:17] way way high mountain they have one down
[1:11:21] in in Australia it's called the Great
[1:11:23] Barrier Reef it's a it's a it's an
[1:11:26] incredible uh Reef of crustacean it's
[1:11:29] got some of the most diverse uh fish
[1:11:32] life and Aquatic Life in the world
[1:11:36] South America has one it's called Uh
[1:11:39] guanara Bay it's actually uh they're in
[1:11:42] Brazil it's got one of the uh one of the
[1:11:45] other Wonders of the World which is that
[1:11:47] huge statue of Christ that looks out
[1:11:50] over the bay you've seen pictures of
[1:11:52] that well that bay itself actually is a
[1:11:56] a an inland Bay it's one of the largest
[1:11:59] in the world of it is the largest uh
[1:12:03] Inland Bay in the world uh you've got uh
[1:12:07] uh there's a volcano and volcano in
[1:12:09] Central and America it's one of them and
[1:12:11] then one right by my house there's
[1:12:13] called the Grand Canyon Joe
[1:12:16] these are what they call wonders
[1:12:20] of the world there's the seven uh
[1:12:23] natural wonders of the world they're
[1:12:25] naturally occurring man didn't have
[1:12:26] anything to do with it and so they call
[1:12:29] these the wonders of the world well even
[1:12:31] those wanders and then there's the one
[1:12:33] that's Way Way North up here that you
[1:12:35] see during the winter when it's real
[1:12:36] cold uh the Aurora Borealis the the
[1:12:39] northern lights and that's one of the
[1:12:42] wonders of the world well these things
[1:12:46] so man has called him the wonders of the
[1:12:48] world but then they all have some
[1:12:51] disclaimer
[1:12:53] that says well you know Mount Everest
[1:12:56] it's the highest above sea level but
[1:12:58] from base to Summit there's another one
[1:13:01] in Hawaii that's actually taller because
[1:13:03] but you can't see part of it because
[1:13:04] it's under the water
[1:13:05] you know so they have this disclaimer
[1:13:07] well this Bay is this but you know
[1:13:09] there's another one that's got this and
[1:13:11] there's all kinds of there's all kinds
[1:13:13] of disclaimers that that that that come
[1:13:16] to these things so it's a wonder that
[1:13:17] they're even a Wonder
[1:13:19] you know and and then and then of all of
[1:13:23] them God sends a Vindicated prophet in
[1:13:27] the last days and he mentions none of
[1:13:29] them
[1:13:31] in the message you know except for one
[1:13:34] and which I thought was striking because
[1:13:36] the one that he mentions is the Northern
[1:13:38] Lights
[1:13:40] and then he applies that in such a way
[1:13:42] and and I want to read what he what he's
[1:13:45] what he says there about the Northern
[1:13:46] Lights because he applies that in such a
[1:13:48] way so that so he he makes a spiritual
[1:13:52] application to it
[1:13:54] the rest of them they were just you know
[1:13:56] just a hill out there a hole in the
[1:13:58] ground or you know some water you know
[1:14:01] but he doesn't really uh deal with it he
[1:14:03] says I was standing near the North Pole
[1:14:05] here a few years ago
[1:14:07] and here I've seen them Northern Lights
[1:14:09] sweeping yellow green flashes dark
[1:14:11] midnight would make it as light as it is
[1:14:14] in this room I walked by I thought Way
[1:14:16] Down Yonder in Central America where
[1:14:18] that Compass will point right straight
[1:14:20] to that magnetic pole and so he's
[1:14:22] talking about how that there's you know
[1:14:25] that there's this this this Northern
[1:14:27] Lights or they're in the North Pole and
[1:14:30] that's just north and that's basically
[1:14:32] the the Crux of what he was saying but
[1:14:35] what's really goes on to say here
[1:14:38] he says right straight to that magnetic
[1:14:41] pole it'll guide you North every time
[1:14:43] and how glorious that that is that we
[1:14:46] got a magnetic system in glory
[1:14:51] so so now then so you have what is
[1:14:54] called the the uh the geographic North
[1:14:57] Pole
[1:14:58] then you have what is called the
[1:15:01] Magnetic North Pole which are slightly
[1:15:04] different
[1:15:05] but then brother Brown then begins to
[1:15:08] talk about this magnetic system that
[1:15:11] points us to Glory
[1:15:13] so we actually have what I want to just
[1:15:15] throw in here a dimensional North
[1:15:18] and dimensional North is not a direction
[1:15:20] at all but it's a it's an atmosphere
[1:15:23] it's a place it's a dwelling it's a it's
[1:15:27] a it's it's called Heaven it's called
[1:15:29] home for the believer
[1:15:31] and he said how glorious that is that we
[1:15:34] got a magnetic system in glory and every
[1:15:37] time that has been every man that has
[1:15:40] been made a compass to to guide through
[1:15:44] this life
[1:15:45] will Point towards Jesus Christ just as
[1:15:49] certain as we're sitting in this church
[1:15:51] today
[1:15:52] and so that so that this this this
[1:15:54] Marvelous Light that we've received in
[1:15:58] the end time is the person of Jesus
[1:16:01] Christ and so that when we're born again
[1:16:05] there's that little Crystal that little
[1:16:07] that little uh lodestone that was placed
[1:16:11] in our soul so that every time amen that
[1:16:14] we we we lose our direction we begin to
[1:16:17] look at the word of God and it points us
[1:16:20] back to Jesus Christ every single time
[1:16:23] it won't lead us astray it won't lead us
[1:16:26] to the north it won't lead us to
[1:16:28] Jeffersonville it won't lead us to
[1:16:30] Johnson City or Flagstaff or Phoenix
[1:16:33] Arizona or Calgary amen but it will lead
[1:16:36] us directly to Jesus Christ the word
[1:16:39] every single time without fail
[1:16:42] Hallelujah
[1:16:46] now this Marvelous Light
[1:16:49] it's wonderful
[1:16:51] to our eyes
[1:16:54] now
[1:17:00] prophet of God here he says look what
[1:17:03] taken place at that and that was only
[1:17:06] preparing
[1:17:07] for this now he's going to enter into a
[1:17:10] thought here he's going to give us a
[1:17:11] list
[1:17:12] and I got some bullet points here I want
[1:17:14] to hit uh quickly because we're uh
[1:17:18] running out of time
[1:17:20] they went out into the Dark Ages 1500
[1:17:22] years in the time of Wesley and Luther
[1:17:25] that sixth time looking out into the
[1:17:28] church ages
[1:17:29] he says that that there was a change
[1:17:32] come
[1:17:33] when the church was liberated from
[1:17:35] darkness and was brought into The
[1:17:37] Marvelous Light of the Gospel again so
[1:17:41] he's talking about the message now
[1:17:42] breaking out during the time of the the
[1:17:45] Azusa Street Revival 1906 coming down
[1:17:48] which introduced the message of the hour
[1:17:51] now
[1:17:52] he said signs and wonders oh God
[1:17:55] how no man stood and Divine Healing and
[1:17:58] signs and wonders took place and it was
[1:18:01] between the sacrifice and the second
[1:18:04] coming look what taken place then so all
[1:18:07] this other was a build up for what was
[1:18:10] going to take place at the end time the
[1:18:12] stone had been rejected in the days of
[1:18:14] Christ it had been rejected all the way
[1:18:16] down through the church ages persecuted
[1:18:18] martyred burned at the stake devoured by
[1:18:21] animals
[1:18:23] the sheepskin and goat skins and lived
[1:18:26] in caves and nakedness and Peril and of
[1:18:29] these things the world was not worthy
[1:18:31] then it comes on down between the
[1:18:34] sacrifice
[1:18:36] and the restoration of the Gospel now
[1:18:38] watch what he says
[1:18:40] between the sacrifice and the second
[1:18:41] coming he said look what taken place
[1:18:43] what's taking place now
[1:18:47] we're at the end time we're going into
[1:18:49] the Millennium every hand pointed that
[1:18:51] way the old clock is ticking away about
[1:18:53] two minutes until midnight which is in
[1:18:56] that time it's closer than that now
[1:18:58] it's only seconds away
[1:19:01] watch what he says
[1:19:03] omnipotence is speaking
[1:19:07] Angels appearing prophets prophesying
[1:19:10] prophets are coming on the scene Visions
[1:19:13] being poured out upon the people of the
[1:19:15] day
[1:19:16] the gospel is being preached sick is
[1:19:18] being raised up the blind naturally and
[1:19:21] spiritually
[1:19:23] the blind seed the deaf here the devils
[1:19:26] are raging impersonators Janice and
[1:19:28] jambres are here oh but omnipotent
[1:19:31] speaks hallelujah we're in the last days
[1:19:34] we're at the junction men's hearts are
[1:19:37] failing for fear it's a perplexity of
[1:19:39] time distress of Nations Earth is
[1:19:41] getting nervous it's bursting forth and
[1:19:43] earthquakes everywhere what's the matter
[1:19:45] the Earth knows that she's doomed she's
[1:19:49] nervous
[1:19:50] the world is nervous
[1:19:52] but
[1:19:54] the church is riding in the gospel
[1:20:00] well think about it it doesn't matter to
[1:20:02] the church if it blows up
[1:20:05] the bombs can come the the the whatever
[1:20:08] that the Earth wants to burst open like
[1:20:11] a watermelon it doesn't matter because
[1:20:13] the church are astronauts
[1:20:16] Hallelujah they've got a spaceship amen
[1:20:19] they've got a shuttle that'll take them
[1:20:21] out of this Dimension until the till the
[1:20:24] Wrath be passed and then he'll bring us
[1:20:27] back and we'll be on the earth for a
[1:20:29] thousand years of Peace amen Oh my he
[1:20:33] can flood it as in the days of the
[1:20:35] antiluvian it doesn't matter the church
[1:20:38] is riding in the gospel The Old Ship of
[1:20:42] Zion we've got an Ark of Safety amen he
[1:20:46] can burn it with fire it doesn't matter
[1:20:48] because we're with the Hebrew children
[1:20:50] Amen in the midst of the fire the fourth
[1:20:53] man was in the fire with the church
[1:20:55] Hallelujah
[1:20:57] oh it doesn't matter what he does why
[1:20:59] because she's secure writing in the
[1:21:03] gospel
[1:21:05] oh my brother Brown tells us that Paul
[1:21:08] Rader now that Paul Rader that he was he
[1:21:11] was he'd gone down into the mission
[1:21:12] Fields And while he was there he got
[1:21:14] Blackwater fever which is a death
[1:21:16] sentence
[1:21:17] and as he was dying he was there he's
[1:21:19] passing off into a into a coma now we
[1:21:23] know the story of Paul Raider but I just
[1:21:25] want to throw something in here that
[1:21:27] came to me today
[1:21:28] that Paul wasn't alone
[1:21:32] he was there with his wife
[1:21:34] and he told his wife wife keep praying
[1:21:38] keep crying out to God
[1:21:41] he told his wife honey
[1:21:43] it's getting so dark in here said I'm
[1:21:46] dying and she said oh Paul and she fell
[1:21:50] on her face and began crying now this is
[1:21:54] striking to me because everyone thought
[1:21:57] it was all Paul Raider's faith
[1:22:00] when she had great faith but remember he
[1:22:03] wasn't alone
[1:22:04] his little wife was there in the field
[1:22:06] with him
[1:22:07] she began to cry he told her you keep
[1:22:11] praying I I can't pray no more
[1:22:14] I've lost my my voice I I can't pray no
[1:22:17] more he said honey just keep crying keep
[1:22:20] crying out to God let me hear your voice
[1:22:24] let somebody pray I can't pray anymore
[1:22:27] said well I'm dying I want to hear it
[1:22:31] and she kept crying out to God oh God
[1:22:34] don't let him die his work isn't
[1:22:37] finished yet oh God please don't let
[1:22:39] Paul die she was laying across him like
[1:22:42] that
[1:22:43] and so it was her prayers that
[1:22:46] interceded it didn't matter if he
[1:22:48] crossed over he said I'm ready to die
[1:22:51] I'm not afraid I'm not afraid to die but
[1:22:54] keep praying all that little faith of
[1:22:57] that little wife she just kept praying
[1:23:00] he breaks into the dream
[1:23:02] and he remembers working up in Oregon
[1:23:05] where he was a logger
[1:23:08] and he said he was there and he was in
[1:23:09] the dream and he had cut down a big blog
[1:23:12] and he he needed to get it over he need
[1:23:15] to get it back down to camp but it was
[1:23:16] too big
[1:23:18] they kept struggling
[1:23:20] he said but then he heard his boss
[1:23:22] say why are you struggling Paul
[1:23:25] so he said I'm just I'm just tired I
[1:23:28] said but the river's right there
[1:23:31] just roll it over
[1:23:33] roll it over into the river Paul and get
[1:23:37] on it
[1:23:39] and ride it down to camp
[1:23:42] he said he rolled it over he said he'd
[1:23:44] come to himself with his hands up crying
[1:23:46] out I'm riding on it I'm riding on it
[1:23:49] completely healed standing in the middle
[1:23:52] of the room oh my we know the story
[1:23:56] here's the rest of the story here
[1:23:59] brother Adam says let him call me
[1:24:01] whatever they want to I don't care that
[1:24:04] doesn't matter to me I'm certain that
[1:24:07] it's God
[1:24:08] amen it's the Lord's doing and it's
[1:24:11] marvelous in our eyes this is the day

[1:24:21] is God's doing amen you may have trouble
[1:24:23] today you may be wore out tired you may
[1:24:26] be struggling you may be going through
[1:24:29] who knows what everybody has their own
[1:24:31] battle just get on it roll it into the

[1:25:51] everything I know to do I've got to a
[1:25:54] place
[1:25:54] where I can see and can't do no more
[1:25:58] I just laid the whole thing in the lap
[1:26:00] of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:01] and I'm riding on it
[1:26:04] I'm riding on God's purpose on God's
[1:26:07] promise

[1:26:38] he keeps it and I'm riding on it
[1:26:43] I believe it with all of my heart
[1:26:48] he said when you see these things happen
[1:26:50] raise up your head
[1:26:52] your Redemption draweth nigh
[1:26:54] omnipotence speaks and the miraculous
[1:26:58] takes place
[1:27:00] Hallelujah
[1:27:02] as our musicians come
[1:27:15] we've always asked ourselves well I want
[1:27:18] to see a miracle
[1:27:21] I want to see a miracle
[1:27:23] well
[1:27:25] I was a young Christian one time and I
[1:27:27] wanted to see miracles
[1:27:29] one day I was
[1:27:30] kind of disappointed you know it's
[1:27:32] because you know I heard all the things
[1:27:34] about brother Branham and so forth
[1:27:36] I was walking by an old mirror that was
[1:27:38] hanging on the door
[1:27:40] the Lord stopped me and said look in
[1:27:42] that mirror I looked in there he said
[1:27:43] there's your miracle
[1:27:46] you ain't joking
[1:27:48] you know when I began to look at myself
[1:27:50] I said look at me where I'm standing
[1:27:52] today
[1:27:53] I'm a man in my right mind
[1:27:55] when three months before that I didn't I
[1:27:58] wasn't in my right mind
[1:28:00] I was a
[1:28:01] victim of drug overdose I'd ate so much
[1:28:04] acid that I was I'd fried my brains I
[1:28:07] could even carry on a decent
[1:28:09] conversation slurred speech slobbers
[1:28:12] running out of my mouth walking up and
[1:28:13] down the street like a zombie
[1:28:17] but then Jesus came
[1:28:19] it was the Lord's doing
[1:28:22] it was marvelous in her eyes
[1:28:24] what he did for me I can't even explain
[1:28:27] it's outside of my human comprehension
[1:28:31] brother Adam says this and when you
[1:28:32] become converted from a sinner to a
[1:28:34] Christian
[1:28:36] it changes your opinions it changes your
[1:28:39] will it changes everything that's in you
[1:28:42] it brings you into another life
[1:28:44] it gives you another spirit
[1:28:47] that bears forth another record
[1:28:51] who hath believed our report
[1:28:54] and to whom hath the arm
[1:28:57] of the Lord been revealed
[1:28:59] that's the Lord's doing
[1:29:01] and it's marvelous in our sight
[1:29:05] he goes on he said omnipotence has spoke
[1:29:08] it spoke to my heart
[1:29:10] and spoke to your heart
[1:29:12] the miraculous was done
[1:29:15] once a little cowardly sinner
[1:29:18] maybe like you did a drunkard a
[1:29:20] cigarette smoker a runner dances and
[1:29:23] carrying on like that
[1:29:25] but omnipotent spoke
[1:29:27] and he received it
[1:29:30] and the miraculous was done
[1:29:34] you change from Death To Life
[1:29:37] and forsaken your sins
[1:29:39] omnipotent spoke
[1:29:42] and the miraculous was done
[1:29:44] certainly
[1:29:47] it's about our hearts
[1:29:49] father this evening Lord we
[1:29:54] we have to say as the psalmists
[1:29:59] this is the day
[1:30:01] the Lord has made let us rejoice and
[1:30:04] be glad in it
[1:30:08] omnipotence has spoken
[1:30:10] we were yet dead in sin and trespassed
[1:30:13] we were
[1:30:14] we were living in pleasure and dead
[1:30:17] while we yet live
[1:30:19] but omnipotence spoke
[1:30:24] the miraculous took place
[1:30:27] and this is marvelous in our eyes
[1:30:31] it's marvelous this is a day
[1:30:34] despised and rejected your Prophet said
[1:30:36] that she has been despised
[1:30:40] and rejected of men
[1:30:42] there is no Beauty we would desire
[1:30:45] in her
[1:30:48] Lord we're that little bride that little
[1:30:51] that little despised and rejected Church
[1:30:56] cut out from the world but you said we
[1:30:59] would be a peculiar people
[1:31:02] and we would be a a holy nation
[1:31:06] the rest of the world is
[1:31:08] turned over to reprobate minds and
[1:31:13] fornicating spirits and Evil
[1:31:17] all the way down into little children
[1:31:22] loss of identity loss of
[1:31:25] common sense
[1:31:29] but Lord your little bride she's
[1:31:31] she's rising up into the into the
[1:31:34] Ethereal Realms where she can see that
[1:31:37] all things are possible Lord she's
[1:31:40] grasping onto every Pentecostal promise
[1:31:43] that the skies are are full of Lord to
[1:31:47] to see the supernatural done in their
[1:31:49] own lives

[1:32:03] soon and imminent coming Lord that they
[1:32:05] would know you
[1:32:06] Lord that they would forsake the things
[1:32:09] of the world and
[1:32:11] or they would cleave to the cross
[1:32:16] or until they're
[1:32:19] trophies
[1:32:21] they would all lay down
[1:32:24] they would still cling

[1:36:54] it has
[1:37:02] been Hallelujah
[1:37:11] [Music]
[1:37:16] I just can't help but uh
[1:37:18] maybe sing another song we still have a
[1:37:20] few more minutes before nine

[1:37:27] watering once in a while some praise
[1:37:30] isn't that wonderful
[1:37:32] it's the Lord's doing
[1:37:34] and it's marvelous in our eyes
[1:37:37] certainly enjoyed that thought tonight
[1:37:39] you ask me why I'm happy brothers and
[1:37:42] sisters so I'll just tell you why
[1:37:45] might seem like I sing this a lot but I
[1:37:48] just think it's beautiful we don't mope
[1:37:51] around as believers do we

[1:40:27] [Music]
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:40] this can't help but think about that
[1:40:42] story brother Branham tells when I sing
[1:40:44] that song the reason I sing it is
[1:40:47] because I just can't help but think of
[1:40:48] that story but the random tells about
[1:40:49] being in that in that in that restaurant
[1:40:51] where he sees the the woman the
[1:40:54] ill-famed woman right the two lawmen and
[1:40:57] how he sees that Vision he's judging
[1:40:59] them and ask God to to to Smite them to
[1:41:02] judge them and and God says you know
[1:41:05] what there's a bumper of blood and you
[1:41:08] know he sees that vision and he says
[1:41:10] whose sins are those and he says those
[1:41:12] are yours the prophet of God those are
[1:41:15] your sins and if it weren't for that
[1:41:17] bumper of blood if it weren't for that
[1:41:19] cross of calvary some place for your
[1:41:22] sins to be hid my goodness
[1:41:24] that's why I like singing that that's
[1:41:26] why I sing that so much I just think
[1:41:28] about that you know um can we sing in
[1:41:31] Christ alone as we're dismissed tonight

[1:42:03] could pride myself in battle's world
[1:42:08] before I've been blessed beyond measure
[1:42:13] and my history
