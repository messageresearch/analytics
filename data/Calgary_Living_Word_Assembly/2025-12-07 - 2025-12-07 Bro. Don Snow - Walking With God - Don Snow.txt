Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, this morning we've come to say thank you for the life given to us once again. Father, not everybody went to sleep and came back alive. And here we are this morning, Father, with blood flowing in us. So, Father, we defy every every gravity and say thank you for your grace, Lord. Father, we don't deserve to be here this morning, Lord. Even how we drove here, we don't know how we did it because not because that we are good drivers, but your grace brought us here this morning, Father. And we want to thank you once again, Father, for bringing each and everyone from all over the city, across town, Father, to assemble in your name to worship you this morning, Lord. We want to say thank you, Lord. We do appreciate that, Lord Jesus. The roads are very treacherous, but we made it here this morning, Father. And we are here to say thank you. We are here to worship you, Lord. We are here to praise you and also to hear from you this morning, Lord. We believe that you have something for each one of us this morning. &gt;&gt; And as Father, our brother Dawn, one of us, Lord, you've chosen him, that vessel to speak to us, Lord. Father, we know that even if you can use the donkey to talk to your children, you can use brother Dawn to speak to us this morning. Lord, as our brother has labored, Lord, I pray that you help him, Lord, as he's coming forward to bring your mind. Would you calm his nails? Would you help him, Lord, to speak something for me, for my brother or my sister here this morning, Lord? We want to continue to father hold our pastor Lord who is troubled to Grand Prairie with some brothers Lord to preach your word. Would you help them as well this morning Lord Jesus? This morning brother Paul has also libert Lord would you help our brother and each one that has gathered here this morning Lord may we not be spectators but for Lord God may we be part of this service Lord. And we also want to remember each and every person, every need that is among us this morning, Lord. We never meet without any need among us, Lord. So I pray that Lord, you move from person to person &gt;&gt; this morning, Lord. At the end of it all, we shall be careful to bring thanks to you, Lord. We are bringing our tithes and offering. We pray that Lord, you receive it and bless it. For in Jesus name that we pray. Amen. Oh, it's hard to [singing] take the first. It's hard [singing] to take the first step when I don't [singing and music] know the way. Each step is so uncertain. [singing] But I learn to walk by faith. But you gave me that [music and singing] promise that you will never leave. [music] You will lead [singing] and guide me. And Lord, I do [singing] believe [music] Lord I [music] will follow. Holy [singing] Lord and I will [music] go. [singing] Oh, you have called me [music] and I have answered me [music and singing] Lord. I will go. You can have your seats for the last verse. The call of man. Brother Emanuel's got a special forest. Well, your plans for me are perfect. I never need to [music and singing] fear. For though sometimes I feel alone, I know that you are here. [music] My heart just wants to follow and I'm willing [music and singing] to obey. Just take my hand and lead me. [music] I'll follow all the way. [singing] [music] [music] [singing] Leave me alone.

We do have a spoken request, unspoken persistent Michelle. You have a need in your life and in your Let's just go before the Lord together as a unified body and God will exceedingly and abundantly more than we could ever ask. Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, one more time, Father, we arise with breath in our lungs, Lord, and desire in our heart, Father, to serve you with all of us and our being, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Thank you Lord for that desire Lord. &gt;&gt; It led us here today Father. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Father we commit ourselves aresh as a unified body Lord for your honor and your glory Lord. &gt;&gt; Father we surrender this service to you and in your name Father that thy will be done this day. Father &gt;&gt; Father take all flesh circumcise it away Father &gt;&gt; that Father we could just stand Lord as &gt;&gt; your bride. feeding one on another, fellowshipping around you, Father, Lord, making love to you, Father, receiving of you, Lord. You place gifts and men, Father, by the Lord. You're the one that operates them, Lord. And we just surrender to you, Father. Father, in this moment, Lord, we just [snorts] bring our needs before you, Lord. We are a needy people, Father, because we're in this flesh. Father, our sister Michelle wants to make it known that she needs a touch from you. Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, for healing my family. &gt;&gt; The sar pongs, Father. All of us can stand here and just give a million testimonies, Father, of your healing power, Lord. Father, we just ask that you'd bless Brother Mary, our pastor, our precious pastor, Father, as he traveled, Lord, to bring the word there. May accomplish, Father, that which you sent him to do, Father. &gt;&gt; May you bring them home safe to us, Father. We know the roads are treacherous, Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; And we know we're in your hands. &gt;&gt; We make good decisions, Father. And we just rely on you, your blessings, Father. My &gt;&gt; Uncle Ron in Newfaland, Father, a believer of your word, Father. The living word just needing a touch from you, Lord. &gt;&gt; May you give him the recovery that it requests, Lord. Father, &gt;&gt; all his life, Lord, deser desiring to serve you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; may you just heal him one more time, Father. Thank you Lord. We commit this service. Use me Lord I pray. Shut my mouth Father. The things that are not pleasing or not edifying Lord. Open my mouth and you speak Lord. In Jesus [music] Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you resistance. Amen. I'm just going to go straight into the word because then I know once I get talking about the word, I feel right at home. So, I don't want to make it awkward or you can be turning to your Bibles in Genesis 1. Just know that I love you all. My desire is just to bring a word of encouragement, a word of edification, maybe [snorts] help you in your walk. Yes. &gt;&gt; Today I just want to talk about walking with God &gt;&gt; through the good. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The very good and the abundantly exceedingly good. &gt;&gt; We're going to talk about desire, pleasure, frustration, &gt;&gt; satisfaction, and perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So here in Genesis 1:1, [snorts] in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. [snorts] And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. And God saw the light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. Amen. Let's turn to 31. 1:31. I wanted to read the whole thing, but this will at least give us a foundation to begin with. Genesis 1:31. &gt;&gt; And God saw everything that he had made. And behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. Let's just bow our heads one more time. [snorts] Heavenly Father, Lord, as we approach your holy word, Father, you in written form, Lord, we find such encouragement. Father, we find [snorts] our substances, the things that we have need of, Father, Lord, Father, we just commit this word, Father. May you open it and break it Aresh to us, Father. May the full revelation of it, Father. Lord, not a partial re revelation just come forth in our lives, Father, and understanding that we could walk in it, Lord. We pray. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for this word, this word of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may take your seats. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, I noticed that I'm one of those brothers that always has a runny nose, so forgive me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Greet you all in the name of the Lord. And like I said, I want to talk about walking with God. We're all in a journey. We're all here today. So therefore, we're we're walking with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And here in Genesis, we can see where God said something and it happened. &gt;&gt; And all the way down through Genesis 1, it says, "God said this and it happened." God said this and every time he said, "It was good. It's good. It's good." Six times &gt;&gt; and then when he got to the end, &gt;&gt; it was very good. &gt;&gt; So there's something in there for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I did a bunch of bit of a research that on this and uh because it meant a lot to me. It just struck me one day. It's like why? How did it change from good to very good? Amen. And this is just my nature, my personality, a gift you want. I'm very curious. Even when I was a kid, I would take my toys and smash them open because I wanted to see how they worked. But unfortunately, I didn't have the ability to put them back together, right? So, it kind of serves me well today. I'm a bit of a studyer. I get I get a hold of something and I guess brother Brandham called it prospecting. So I'm a prospector of this word. I just love diving into it &gt;&gt; and uh the Lord blesses us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So as you see here uh God said that it was good and this word actually means to ov the Hebrew and it just it's really interesting because as we know this word good is all throughout the Bible. But there's some other instances very good and exceedingly abundantly good that stand out. But if we look at this word uh good, it means that it was served its purpose. It it did come into existence and its purpose, but it wasn't very good yet. Amen. And that's uh I want to go to Satan's Eden. Sorry, I'll I'll settle down here in a second. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just read a quote from the prophet because if anything, I can say I read a quote and we're safe in that. Amen. Satan's Eden 1965829 paragraph 54 and God knew that we would be here but then he put us in flesh so he would con be contacted in order he could be contact he became one of us when he became Jesus Christ the son of God himself the fullness of the manifestation of God and therefore that was God's purpose to desire his attributes in fellowship ship. &gt;&gt; So, as we know before even Genesis here, the prophet taught us that God, the self-existing one, he had desires, he had attributes in him that he wanted to display. And I want to take Genesis here and show you how God first went about doing this because God doesn't change. So, we can see it in Genesis, we can see it all the way, and then we can see it in our lives. &gt;&gt; So, that's my purpose today is to show us maybe on our place of journey where we might be, but this is all on a journey, and it's the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God speaks things. He recognizes it. He says it's good. So if we carry on here, uh, paragraph 56, and as children of God, are you children of God? Do you profess? Is that your testimony? &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's speaking to us. We are part of God's attribute that was in him, made flesh like he was made flesh. So we can have fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon earth. And that was God's purpose at the beginning. So in Genesis 1 when he started to do it was its purpose was to have fellowship but this is how he brought it about and that was God's purpose at the beginning. Yes sir. That's what God wanted at the beginning. So God wanted fellowship. He was all alone and he wanted someone to worship him. But more than that he wanted fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had everything under control. &gt;&gt; He turned man over into the Garden of Eden on free moral agency. said, "Son, it's yours." This was the beginning. What a beautiful place. [clears throat] Amen. God was so satisfied till he just went back and rested from all his works. Every tree never brought forth thorns and thistles. No berries ever come off of a throne, a thorn tree. Everything was perfect. Genesis 1-31. That was perfect. &gt;&gt; All seeds were perfect. Everything was in perfect condition. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it went from good and when you get down to the to the uh 31 it says very good. So what happened was it was in perfect condition. It was all in harmony working together and serving his purpose. All of these individual creations now were working in harmony together serving the complete full purpose of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This was God's standard and it says that he was satisfied. Satisfied means he was pleased or content &gt;&gt; with what has been experienced or received. &gt;&gt; It means that it was paid in full. It came to full fruition of what he had in his mind. He was uh satisfied means that you're persuaded by argument or evidence. So the very thing was standing in front of him and he was satisfied. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking about this because most of my Christian walk, I was very frustrated and I was wasn't satisfied. And we'll talk about that. Maybe some of you feel that way here today that you're serving God and you have a desire in your heart, but you just seem to be always stumbling and falling and and and that thirst in you is not satisfied yet. &gt;&gt; But just know that desire, God put it there. It's good. &gt;&gt; And when God says something, he's immutable, right? Whatever he says has to come to pass. &gt;&gt; So that desire is leading you somewhere. &gt;&gt; So keep feeding that desire. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we said the the good to the very good was in Hebrew was to it means very good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good or to means good, pleasant, beautiful, functional, complete. That was the good. But in verse 31, the mud is literally means it's much, it's exceedingly, it's abundantly, it's utterly good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word mi actually amplifies. It means exceedingly good, abundantly good, &gt;&gt; utterly complete or perfectly fitting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That very good signals the perfection of the whole. Everything working together in divine order and purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, we want to bring this down to the individual, but we're looking in Genesis first. You got to be able to see it from Genesis all the way to Revelations. Amen. I guess you could say good described the parts that were right. &gt;&gt; But the very good described the whole that was now in perfect relationship complete. Remember we fell from this. Amen. Right after this, God rested and then man has dominion over there. He brings them and puts them in the earth. Amen. So this actually means that it came to full maturity there in verse 31 because he's saying it was very good. It's it's now uh in existence and it's all working together. exceedingly good, perfectly complete, overflowing in goodness is what that verse 31 means. Amen. &gt;&gt; His purpose, the order, and the harmony were full, overflowing and abundant. Nothing lacking. Everything perfectly expressing his will. &gt;&gt; This is what we're to be restored back to. &gt;&gt; Here now in the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seven church ages. Good. Good. Good. Good. We get to enjoy the very good. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not just good things, but good in total harmony the way God meant it to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ireanius, and I'm not quoting brother Brandham here, but Arreinius, I I really studied the Greek and the Hebrews, just who I am. And Arinius, there's a bunch of St. Basil, a lot of them commented on this very good. What is it? One day I'm driving in my car and that thought comes to me. Lord, what do you mean by very good and then three months of it just moving and unfolding and helping me in my walk. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I'll just say it now so maybe we can get back to it is I met I was water baptized when I was about 20 years old. I backslid away when I was about 25 with a desire in my heart to serve God. 20 years with a desire to serve God &gt;&gt; with a good thing in my heart &gt;&gt; but constantly frustrated that I didn't have the ability. &gt;&gt; I felt like a hypocrite &gt;&gt; because I couldn't live out the desire in my heart. &gt;&gt; Constantly frustrated my whole life &gt;&gt; but knowing I'm a son of God. How can this be? &gt;&gt; How can this be? Lord, &gt;&gt; I had to learn patience the hard way. &gt;&gt; That's just me. You don't have you don't have to walk the way I walked &gt;&gt; if this was maybe ministered at that time. But we know that maybe I would have been mature enough to receive it. &gt;&gt; But our lives are not meant to be full of frustrations with the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I now I will say a year and a half ago, my life completely changed. &gt;&gt; I have the ability now to do everything that's desired in my heart. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; For a long time, I thought I had the Holy Ghost, but my walk didn't prove it. &gt;&gt; It proved otherwise. There's an evidence. And the product, the product is very good, and it actually goes beyond that. [snorts] Let's talk about Enoch because Enoch was the perfect example of the bride, right? Joseph, Jesus, &gt;&gt; Enoch, and it's pretty interesting when you go and research Enoch, very little is said. &gt;&gt; It's almost like it's a mystery, &gt;&gt; right? [snorts] You don't have to turn there, but I will. Genesis 5 21- 24. This is our perfect type. Amen. Of us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet said it and I'll read it. Enoch [snorts] lived 65 years and begott Methuselah. Now, right there it said Enoch lived 65 years. [snorts] He had a son. But then it changes that Enoch walked with God. If you go back and look at the lineage, [snorts] there's only him and Noah where they said that he walked with God. The rest was they they were alive. &gt;&gt; It was they're alive. But here there's a statement that says he walked with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's one of the most descriptive ways that God talks about our perfect example is about he walked with God. What does that mean? What does it mean to walk with God? And I want to by the help of the Lord show you what that means today. So you'll know. &gt;&gt; You'll know beyond a shadow of a doubt. Enoch lives. And right here it shows. You'll notice that if you're wondering whether or not you have the Holy Ghost in the Bible it always says that he was such and such. It's a such a notable event that it says he was at this age and God appeared to him and spoke to them. Abraham, Enoch, it says right here he was 65 years old and then all of a sudden he started walking with God. It's an event that happened and it's put in scripture and you should have the same identification evidence in your own life that you'll know that there is no doubt I have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Enoch lived 65 years and begat Methuselah. And [snorts] Enoch walked with God after he begot Methuselah 300 years and begott sons and daughters. And all the days of Enoch were 365 years. And Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him. [snorts] &gt;&gt; This is our perfect type and all it says that he walked with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, what does that mean? M &gt;&gt; so we get another piece of uh evidence or description or something to work with where it says in Hebrews 11:5-6 by [snorts] faith okay now we have another piece by faith &gt;&gt; Enoch was translated that he should not see death &gt;&gt; and was not found because God had translated him &gt;&gt; now this is the main point for before his translation he had this testimony &gt;&gt; that he pleased God. &gt;&gt; This is the point we have to get into our walk is where you have to know that you please God &gt;&gt; because once you'll see that's the overcoming power. But &gt;&gt; so he walked with God. He had faith but he he knew he had the testimony &gt;&gt; that he pleased God. He knew it. &gt;&gt; But without faith it is impossible to please him. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God must believe that he is. And the prophet taught us that that's the I am. Even today, right now, we have to believe, not a god in history, &gt;&gt; your God. &gt;&gt; And that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; Now, they're they're together there in the Bible. So, they they they work together. So, I looked up the word, it's always kind of struck me, diligently. What does it mean to diligently seek God? [snorts] It means that you steadily seek God. &gt;&gt; You earnestly seek God. with energetic effort &gt;&gt; painstakingly, [snorts] &gt;&gt; exert considerable effort &gt;&gt; and care. This is how we're supposed to seek God. &gt;&gt; To search out, to investigate, crave, demand, require, and seek after. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, here we start to see now this this idea of desire. You have to desire this to see God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you have this the go after him with all that's in you. Yes. &gt;&gt; A lot of times it'll bring you to a point of desperation or crisis. &gt;&gt; The desire in your heart to meet God will always bring you to an opportunity &gt;&gt; to receive or reject the word of God in your life. &gt;&gt; And it's not just the message of the hour. It's the person of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For over 20 years, I accepted this message as truth. But I failed to walk in all of it. I hadn't received them as my truly as my Lord and Savior. I had an intellectual conception if you want to say or was the birth. It was something that was good, but it wasn't 100% satisfied in me yet. [snorts] Like I said, there's very little said, but he said he's a perfect type. So, I'm just going to read a couple quotes here about Enoch just to show what &gt;&gt; I'm sure all of you already know, but just to bring home this point here. God's only provided place of worship. 1965. The reflector doesn't reflect itself. The reflector isn't the reflection. There has to be something strike the reflector. The reflector to make it reflect. &gt;&gt; So a prophet is a chosen vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all. But he's in direct line with that reflection. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He's in direct line of that reflection. &gt;&gt; God to reflect the image of Christ. the word. See, nothing else can do it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, this is where you come. You are a reflector. &gt;&gt; You have to be in direct line with God. That's what this message does. &gt;&gt; That's the reason the prophet had to eat the book. Revelations 10, you have to eat the book because you have to reflect something. Amen. That's the reason he had to eat the scroll. He had to reflect the word of God for that age. And he says, "You got it. It's &gt;&gt; pretty simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You have to eat and reflect the word for your day. &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Notice Enoch, God's perfect reflector and type. God was through through him with him. He just translated him, took him up. The mechanics that he had reflected become dynamics with the spirit. &gt;&gt; And took him up. &gt;&gt; So this is what I'm trying to say that I would see in my own life. I had the mechanics, but I didn't have the spirit to make it live. I'd be able to come to church and worship God, and underneath that anointing, praise with everyone else, but as soon as I walked out the door, all of a sudden, my temper would flare. Or I'd be a different man at work, but thinking that that's life. That's the Christian walk. It's not. &gt;&gt; It's not. And thank God I can stand here and say today, &gt;&gt; it's not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I no longer just come here and sit underneath the anointing. I walk out there and he's with me. He's living through me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; This is what I want to encourage you to. &gt;&gt; The people are around you are telling you that you're not the man or the woman you think and you know, you respect them and they have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And you'll know if you have the Holy Ghost because if you're still desiring the Holy Ghost and you don't have it because once you get the Holy Ghost, that desire goes away. Now you start desiring the things of the Lord. He starts working through you. &gt;&gt; It's more about reflecting God's only provided place of worship, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Moses was in him. Paragraph 271. Joshua was in him. And if you are in him, you was in him before the foundation of the world. Before Genesis one one, &gt;&gt; the family of God. You suffered with him. You died with him. You went to the cross with him. You raised with him &gt;&gt; and now you're sitting with him. &gt;&gt; You're still with him sitting in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; There's the evidence that goes with it. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Uh let's just go to the Easter Seal. Just bringing up more because Enoch is our perfect type. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 173. Let's take another man with this quickening power. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a man way long ago by the name of Enoch. [snorts] Enoch walked with God. Whatever God said do, Enoch never missed one word. &gt;&gt; He walked with God. &gt;&gt; What was he? He was a son of God. He was an eagle that had been called [snorts] to that day. &gt;&gt; So totally he was obedient to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. 74. He was so full of that quickening power [snorts] and not one time had he had missed his word. Not one time did he misbehave himself. Not one time did he but keep the testimony. Everything that God told him to do, he went and done it. No argument about it. He just went and done it. No matter what anybody else said, &gt;&gt; what he had done, why he was full of that quickening power. And he ends it with that's the quickenity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can honestly say that's what's moving in me now. &gt;&gt; I don't want to do make one choice in my I stumble and fall every day. Yes. But I apply the word which supplies the blood. It goes into sees God. See for I have no desire. &gt;&gt; As soon as I step in a line as soon as I make a mistake, I go and make it right. &gt;&gt; The old dawn years, days, months, pride, stubbornness, whatever. and then be in misery because of the thirst in me, the soul longing to be expressed. [snorts] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit gives you the ability to line up with the word in every aspect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No excuses. It said that [snorts] &gt;&gt; walking gave them total obedience, but he only did it by the quickening power. We can't do it in our own in our own efforts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you do, that's self-righteousness. That's legalism because you're doing it for the wrong reason. You're not doing it in love with in a love with God and that you're doing it because you want to be perfect, but you're doing it your own effort. [snorts] &gt;&gt; The first seal, Enoch, paragraph 154, Enoch typed the bride, right? So, I'm not lying about that. But Enoch walked before God, had a testimony. He pleased God with rapturing faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; this quickening power brought him rapturing faith. And then we'll because he was the seventh from Adam. And then we look at uh Jesus testimony. This is in here ye him 1960. [snorts] I'm just I have a lot here. I have like 26 pages. So I just want to kind of hit the highlights and not just read it verbatim, but read the sections that stand out. Halfway down through 76. It says he took the body and set it on his right side and sent the spirit down here upon the church and the church will have to do the same this uh sorry and the church will have [snorts] to have the same spirit doing the same things that Jesus did or it'll never go in the rapture doveetailing. So he takes a, you know, a piece of paper and ties it. He says it has to come back together. Right? So this is the quickening power we're talking about. Halfway down through 77. That's exactly the way the church has got to be. Jesus was always about the father's business. &gt;&gt; Doing that which was right in his sight. &gt;&gt; Not just going about this and that what the church becomes to do, &gt;&gt; but it is about the father's business. &gt;&gt; And Jesus had the testimony, I always do that which pleases the father. So he knew it. &gt;&gt; He didn't just say it with the mouth. His life proved it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is what I I want to talk about is there's a testimony we have. But our our mouth and our feet have to be in agreement. &gt;&gt; And [snorts] if your mouth and feet are in agreement, that's head to toe. That is total obedience. You brought your whole body, your whole being into line with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, this is a desire. And by the Holy Spirit, you can do this. If you surrender all, this is the quickening power. &gt;&gt; It's not doesn't mean you're not going to have mistakes and failures, but what you're going to do is you're going to apply the word, make correction, repent, make it right, and then you're going to move forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, direct line with God. These are the points that were made. Uh, a reflector of the word for the day. quickening power, filled with the Holy Spirit, total obedience to the complete word of God, rapturing faith, and he pleased the father. So, this is what walking with God entails. &gt;&gt; Now, the thing is is we're placed here on free moral agency. &gt;&gt; So, God chose us just like in wedding veils. He said, "Will you marry me?" &gt;&gt; What is our reply? Yes, Lord, I accept. &gt;&gt; But then there's a life that we live back in reverence and in love. &gt;&gt; Free moral agency. It's our right to choose. &gt;&gt; We have to choose life. &gt;&gt; Not just on Wednesdays and Sundays or when it's suiting or when it in every aspect of our life. &gt;&gt; About six, seven months ago, I woke up one morning and this is what started all of this really. So I woke [snorts] up and I just said a simple prayer. I said, 'Lord, I just want to make nothing but good decisions today. &gt;&gt; The last time I stood here, I testified that I made many bad decisions. &gt;&gt; Now my testimony is every day I make nothing but good decisions. &gt;&gt; And what does that mean? &gt;&gt; I truly want to only walk in the light of the hour. every &gt;&gt; yes I stumble and fall &gt;&gt; but I get back up. I repent. I go and apologize to my wife, my brother, whoever it is. &gt;&gt; That's the perfect walk. It's not not making mistakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's applying the word. &gt;&gt; So I got thinking about this like Lord, I asked the Lord and I started doing it with my wife before we even left the room. We'd hold each other. Father, as husband and wife, as mother and father, &gt;&gt; we commit ourselves aresh this day. Give us the ability to only make good decisions. &gt;&gt; The life now that's coming for it's it's not fulfilled fully yet, but our lives change dramatically. Yeah, we still have our issues, but &gt;&gt; the communication, the the life, the &gt;&gt; all I care about now is the peace and joy, keeping in my home, not my selfish pride or this or that, keeping that love and that joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The joy that I now have in my heart because the thirst that I had has been satisfied because the Holy Spirit satisfied it. &gt;&gt; So many times I'd act out and, you know, be frustrated and mad. It was because I had such a thirst in me that wasn't satisfied and that was how it would show itself. &gt;&gt; I can say I'm satisfied. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I started researching choices and what did academia say and it's a common theme that almost all academia says that we make about 30 to 35,000 choices a day. It's about one every two seconds. A lot of them are involuntary, habitual, just but they say that we make about one to three decisions a day that are lifealtering decisions. &gt;&gt; Remember even when Cadre was here, he goes, you can be at a step and just running parallel for a very long time. What I've learned now is that to walk with God is to invite him into all of our decisions. &gt;&gt; Work, home, &gt;&gt; in our kitchen, in our living room, in our bedroom. &gt;&gt; That's what it means to love and serve God is to invite him. And what does that mean? To apply the word that we received through a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus did. [snorts] He only walked in the word for his day. &gt;&gt; It's like [snorts] firing a rifle. Brother Brown said, "You fired, you're off, you know, a fraction of a millimeter here, but you get out 300 yards, it's off three inches." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; We don't want to be off three inches. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, I'm talking about our part. Yes, God is waiting there to do everything for, but we have to choose. A pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon. Life is not life unless it's received as life. &gt;&gt; I had to learn this and I can tell you the fruit of it is just beautiful. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I'm becoming the man that I always desired to be. &gt;&gt; The husband, the father, &gt;&gt; the deacon, &gt;&gt; I wake up now with such purpose, &gt;&gt; not in myself serving the life that he's put in me. I started thinking about you know walking with God choices but it's we take about everyone about 10,000 steps right so we make 30 actually it's I'll say it's 35,000 choices but just to put it in a natural sense that you know [snorts] you start seeing people and they want to better their lives and they're like they start walking &gt;&gt; right simple thing not strenuous they start walking they become [snorts] healthier next thing they're Hey, I'm not getting enough water. And you start seeing them carrying around. I see brother Andrew sometimes carrying a big thing of water. [snorts] All of a sudden, you start thinking about more healthy conscious. Okay, I'm walking. I need more water. You start paying more attention. Now, remember, I'm talking natural. Think spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're making better choices. All of a sudden, now you start drinking more water and you feel better. Next thing you know, you start paying attention what food you eat, your calorie, your intake, &gt;&gt; at what time you eat. you know, [snorts] is it too sugary? Or Sister Lisa and the people on keto, Sister Judith and that, they they started watching their diet. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm good at least that was your testimony, sister. [laughter] [snorts] &gt;&gt; So, you start counting. You start watching your food intake. Next thing you know, you start stretching. You become more flexible. You're not as stiff or legalistic as you used to be. Next thing you know, you're like, "Man, I could probably even do better." You start maybe lifting weights a little bit. You start, you know, getting stronger so you can carry your brother and your sister. &gt;&gt; Next thing you know, you got better blood circulation, right? &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, people are like, "Man, how'd you do?" Now you have knowledge. How'd you do this? Well, I did this and I did that. And so people are coming to you now for advice. Like, man, how how did you become the person you are? &gt;&gt; Right? [snorts] That's good. &gt;&gt; Next thing you know, you got better cardio. &gt;&gt; You're not just walking. Maybe you're running [snorts] cuz the old man's dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe you become a fine specimen. Maybe even the stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Steps, choices. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; My testimony is is that about a year and a half ago, I shed about 200 lb of this old man, but unfortunately I 255 pounds. So, I have a little bit more work to go. I hope you know what I mean. It was a great victory in my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it came to a point where I had to choose. It was a crisis. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was either all or nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how I felt. It was either walk away from the message yet again. &gt;&gt; I couldn't go back. &gt;&gt; The Lord asked me for all. &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, I'll give you all." &gt;&gt; And he's honored it. &gt;&gt; He's given me his Holy Spirit. Not just a baptism. The Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; that gives me the strength to be able to stand here today and talk with conviction because I've experienced it. I'm not talking about something that I don't know. I've experienced it. &gt;&gt; Become a notable difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe [snorts] now you're full of life. &gt;&gt; You have a glow. Do you ever see healthy people? They have a glow about them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Talking about spiritual fitness. &gt;&gt; They become happier, &gt;&gt; more energetic. You &gt;&gt; start living with a purpose. &gt;&gt; You're able to do those things that you always desired to do, but you didn't have the ability to do it because of lack of mobility or no energy, no strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalms 37:23:24, [snorts] the steps of a good man, so here's this word again, good, are ordered or established by the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he delightth. So here's this satisfaction or desire. In his way, &gt;&gt; though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down. &gt;&gt; I can say there I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've fallen a million times. I've gotten up a million times. [snorts] &gt;&gt; My falls are less frequent now. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because I've learned instead of falling and scraping my knees, I now learn to just kneel down on my knees first and avoid the scrape. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I learned that the hard way. &gt;&gt; Invite the Lord into your life. &gt;&gt; For the Lord upholdeth him &gt;&gt; with his hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I just I guess the best way for me to kind of want to show this and maybe for the young people here is we're walking with God. &gt;&gt; We said there's about 35,000 choices a day. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to do good. Yes, &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to do good. &gt;&gt; I make a selfish mistake. &gt;&gt; Bad mistake. &gt;&gt; Bad. &gt;&gt; Bad. [snorts] But the Lord is so good. Donald, get back in step. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to do that. &gt;&gt; Honey, forgive me. &gt;&gt; Good. Good, &gt;&gt; good, &gt;&gt; good, bad, &gt;&gt; bad. Oh Lord, forgive me. &gt;&gt; See how your walk changes? &gt;&gt; Then it's good, &gt;&gt; good, &gt;&gt; bad. No, good. &gt;&gt; Good. That is the life that I want to live. &gt;&gt; Everything we have need of lays in the Bible and the message. &gt;&gt; Consult the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything we have need of is in the word. &gt;&gt; You don't never want to take a step unless you know 100% the Lord is in it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, we're on free moral agency and we have to make choices. And we're told there's two influences in the world, only two. And these influences are truly actually desires. There's a desire of the soul and there's a desire of the flesh. desires influence our decisions and our walk thoughts into captivity. &gt;&gt; That is how I'm choosing to walk. It becomes easier and easier and easier at first. It's it's so humbling because you start to see how many bad choices you've actually made. But it's good because God is still blessing your walk. &gt;&gt; So, let's just talk about Abraham because he's the the father of faith, correct? And we're the royal seed of Abraham. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. And here it is again. It's it notes a time. See, that's what I'm saying there. The pastor has been preaching it. There is a day. There is an hour when you know you've got the Holy Ghost. You do. Abraham [snorts] was 99, sorry, 90 years old and nine. The Lord appeared to Abraham at visitation. Amen. and said unto him, I am the Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Walk before me and [snorts] be thou perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfect. I looked it up. Walk with integrity. &gt;&gt; Walk in truth. &gt;&gt; Without blemish, without spot, complete full without or sorry, undefiled, uprightly and whole. just walk before me and be spotless. It's not the type of spotless we think &gt;&gt; doesn't mean that you're not g you're gonna fight your old man &gt;&gt; every day of your life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Some days are going to feel better and others sometimes you're going to, man, I hardly hardly fell today. The very fact that you're standing there in that flesh body, we're in need of his mercy and his grace. And this is so there's those of us that have walked away and come back and back, you know, backslid and we fought rock and roll sex. And then there's the sons and daughters that never went away, but you have to fight self-righteousness because you're like, "What do I need to be?" You were born in sin, shaped in iniquity. &gt;&gt; You still need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walk before me and be thou perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will make my covenant between me and thee. I will multiply thee exceedingly. Now if you go back and read the Hebrew on this, it says exceedingly greatly which is mahood mahood. So this is the abundantly exceedingly. So we go from good to the holy very good and now all of a sudden you're going to walk good goodly good mood what however you want to but it's abundantly exceedingly more than you'll be a better man than you ever thought a better woman than you ever thought because you're going to allow the Holy Ghost to reign in your life and it's going to look so humble and so sweet and so simple but &gt;&gt; you're a spiritual giant &gt;&gt; maybe other people around you don't know it &gt;&gt; but demons are afraid of you &gt;&gt; we'll get there Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is God's God chose to do this, but you have to choose to accept it. &gt;&gt; Not just to quote it with your mouth to take what I understand now. I used to hate this flesh body. I used to hate everything about it. Now I understand it's a tool in my hands. I have to be able to make contact with the co-workers around me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But I understand now it's actually now this is just a dawn thought, but this gives me such strength. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. that Satan now is so close to me. This inner man is so much stronger than this flesh that every morning I get to wake up and grab this flesh man by the throat &gt;&gt; and throw him underneath my feet. &gt;&gt; It's a choice. &gt;&gt; You can choose to do it. &gt;&gt; That's being the light of the world. &gt;&gt; He's still going to fight you. He's going to wrestle you and he's going to every once in a while get a punch in, but for the most part because Our husband put all things underneath his feet. &gt;&gt; And if we're baptized in into him, his body, then if we're in him and he's in us, then Satan's underneath your feet. &gt;&gt; You just have to accept it by faith and make start making good choices. And you'll see it. You'll see the evidence. God said, it's true. So therefore, &gt;&gt; it'll be you have to choose to walk in it. That's what faith is. If you desire to be free and and live above it, that's that desire means that it's warning you that you're able to do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it starts with a desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham fell on his face. Amen. Good choice, Abraham. [snorts] And God talked with him, saying, "As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name sorry neither shall thy name any more be called Abram that there should be called Abraham for a father of many nations have I made he already made him it that's what I'm trying to say he's already made you why he's justified you go already glorified you just had to start walking in that revelation it's going to be hard at first &gt;&gt; but that's what our whole walk is about is to get to that point to become what God already said you are you have to work your help You're going to work with God to make it come to pass. &gt;&gt; It's already done. Amen. &gt;&gt; For Abraham, it was decision time. He could be he could have listed all the reasons in his mind. What you talking when I'm 100 years old I've done? He chose to accept it. He still stumbled and fell &gt;&gt; when God told him that. He still w it was 13 years before he actually did it. He had Lot with him and all these other things. It was finally that he actually said got back in line. He got probably so desperate that once he finally did what God asked him to do, God blessed him and he became all of a sudden the promised son comes. &gt;&gt; And that's what we do is that I have to walk from here to here and I'm going to end up there because my footsteps are order. It's just either I'm going to come the easy way or the hard way. &gt;&gt; I'm choosing to go the easy way now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hebrews 11:13-16. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them a far off, and were persuaded of them and embraced them. Now, this in Hebrew right here means that they anticipate it with pleasure. &gt;&gt; There was a desire in them, and they knew, but they didn't receive it, but they they anticipated the pleasure, the fulfillment of it. For they say uh sorry, embraced them and confessed. So, here's a testimony that they were strangers and pilgrims. So, they're standing here. He's like, "Man, there's something else in me. I I don't seem to fit in in this world. I don't seem to be at peace. I'm always frustrated in my life." And he goes, "I I'm not of this world. This is not my home." And because of this testimony, [snorts] it says that for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek. And this word seeks means that they inquire for, they [snorts] intensively, they intensively to demand, they crave, they desire. Here's this this word keeps popping up. Desire and pleasure, satisfaction. &gt;&gt; They declare plainly that they seek a country. And then it says, "And truly, if they had been mindful of that country, so the one they came out of, they lost memory of it. They started seeking what they were looking for and they forgot actually where they so they didn't even go back." Amen. Came out, they might have had an opportunity to return. But now they desire, which is means to stretch oneself, to long for or covenant after. So now they desire a better country. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is a heavenly wherefore God. So because you say I desire something better than this life that I have here now. God is not ashamed to be called your God, their God. And he's already prepared it. So you're hungering for something that God's created, but you can't see it. Now that's faith. &gt;&gt; God created this. It's already made, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he's like, you're inhabitant of it. Now all of a sudden you're walking. I know I'm going somewhere. I know I'm going somewhere. &gt;&gt; Right? You're longing after something that you can't see yet. &gt;&gt; Maybe there's some people here longing for a husband or a wife. If you have a desire for it, the Bible teaches that God will fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Because that desire is there for a reason. &gt;&gt; And that's how things begin with God. There's either a carnal desire of the flesh or there is a desire of the soul. &gt;&gt; And if your soul is longing for a husband or a wife or God is obligated because he's the one that put that desire. You have to understand where desire comes from. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. They desired an invisible city, the land that God promised them. &gt;&gt; Yes. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So when we walk in the new city, oh this I heard this years and years ago, but there was an engineer in the message and he did the math and the dimension, you know, 1500 miles square, 1500. And he actually did the math and he said if you were walking up the side of that, you wouldn't even know you're walking uphill. The why I'm saying that is that's how easy this walk actually becomes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because your faith muscle builds and the more Satan comes, you're like, &gt;&gt; "God has been with me the last 10,000 decisions. &gt;&gt; It came out well." &gt;&gt; It's like, "Beat it. &gt;&gt; Beat it. I'm not entertaining." Because you have a choice to entertain Satan's thoughts or God's thoughts. &gt;&gt; That's just how simple this walk is. But the problem is is we fill ourselves with all this other garbage and we start doubting our walk. It's going to build up your faith to a point where you know you're you you please God. &gt;&gt; He's your husband &gt;&gt; and he's pleasing. Is he not pleasing you? So then you have this relationships that builds strength. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now all of a sudden I'll show you over here. He says that you're more than a match for the devil. Not by yourself but in that relationship. Amen. Numbers uh 14. So that was what was given to uh Abraham. And we see it again here now uh Joshua and Caleb. Numbers 14:6-9. And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Japna, which were the of them that searched the land, rent their clothes. And they spake on all the company of children of Israel, saying, "The land that we pass through to search it is an exceedingly good land." &gt;&gt; Now, here this is again, it's actually [snorts] uh same thing as what Abraham said. It's exceedingly great. It means mahood. &gt;&gt; Mahood. &gt;&gt; If the Lord delight in us, Amen. There's the credential. Then he be he will bring us into this land and give it us a land which flowth with milk and honey. &gt;&gt; So this milk and honey, I looked it up in the Hebrew and that &gt;&gt; I have four pages here on it, but I'll just read a summary in that of it. The milk speaks of your basic needs, your substance, the fat that you need, the calories that you need, and it's filled with the land is full of it. There's places where we can graze our animals. All of our basic needs are met. That's good. But then this this honey, it wasn't bees. It's of the fig and it's very, very sweet. So, it actually speaks of over it's actually uh luxury if you want to say it's over and above what you would what your basic needs are. This is what the means to be in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; A life fully supplied, fully satisfied, fully blessed, both nourished and delighted under the covenant of the care of God. &gt;&gt; That's what this milk and honey means. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not just here to be survive and make ends meet. &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. &gt;&gt; He's going to take care of our needs and then give you even more than what you would think. &gt;&gt; But here's the credential. Only rebel not against the Lord. Right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a warning. Neither fear ye the people of the land. Don't fear the giants. Don't feel those genetic defects. If you want to say we got down through our f you can overcome them. They're there for you to overcome to show the power of God. &gt;&gt; They are bred for us. Defense. Their defenses departed from them. The Lord is with us. Bear them not. So if you can stand and know the Lord is with you, just walk forward. Brother Brham said you're going to fight for every inch. &gt;&gt; Every inch. But wherever your feet lay. So claim your life. Claim your victory. &gt;&gt; Don't just say it with your mouth. Give God what I've learned now is when I give God what? My best. &gt;&gt; God will take it just like the fishes and the loaves &gt;&gt; and increase it tfold more than you could ever ever dream or imagine. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm curious to see how far that will go &gt;&gt; because my desire is not to be rich because I want it's to provide a safe haven &gt;&gt; for my family, my wife, my to be able to help other people. It's not a selfish motive. And there's nothing wrong if you have a desire for a nice car. Absolutely go for it. &gt;&gt; But if your motive is correct, &gt;&gt; God will bless it &gt;&gt; more than you could ever think. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe a little hint for a wife. What husbands? What I've come to understand now is that women are made different than men. &gt;&gt; Women have a desire or a need to be feel safe &gt;&gt; constantly. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Constantly. And we're men and we're made the other way. We're like, why? Because we always feel safe &gt;&gt; because we have the strength. &gt;&gt; So the need in your wife is there to help you humble yourself and share your strength. If you learn to humble yourself &gt;&gt; and help your wife feel safe, &gt;&gt; whether it's financial, emotional, she can really be the wife that she desires to be, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because you married a daughter of God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So ask her, "Honey, what is it you need of me? I know what it is my wife needs of me, and every day I have to choose. Do I want to do that or do I want to just be selfish? [snorts] But I like to think that I mostly make good decisions. &gt;&gt; What is the promised land for us today? Amen. It's the Holy Ghost. So in it is milk and honey. &gt;&gt; And when you're in it, life is exceedingly abundantly good. &gt;&gt; Now I want to bring it down here to us. Now [snorts] this scripture when I was backsliden, Philippians 1:6, most of my Christian walk, this is what I was holding on to. being confident of this very thing, &gt;&gt; that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it [snorts] &gt;&gt; until the day of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; that got me through a lot of dark places. &gt;&gt; He will perform it. But what is So [snorts] I've always loved the scripture and I quite I never question but now my question is what is the good work? If you're going to have confidence, you got to know that he started a good work in you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I believe &gt;&gt; I believe the Bible and the message proves it and we'll look at some quotes that it's the fact that you have a thirst or a desire to serve him. &gt;&gt; That thirst will grow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What do I got written here? It's begun. It's uh connected. Yeah. Good. Very good. Like I said many times, it got me to a lot. But this scripture now goes into Philippians 2:12-16. And this is really where I want to get to. I could preach probably 50 years honestly out of this scripture. This is how this is like my burning bush where God brought me. And this just keeps unfolding and unfolding and unfolding. This is through me all throughout the Bible. And I'm just amazed at how much like once I think I understand it just opens up more and more. Philippians [snorts] 2:12-16. Wherefore my beloved, I'm his beloved. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As you have always obeyed, which means you listened intently, you heeded, you conformed, you hearkened, you were obedient. Not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. &gt;&gt; There's a work for you to do. &gt;&gt; For it is God which workketh, [snorts] &gt;&gt; which means he's bringing about to cause a state to be to produce. It's God that workketh in you both to [snorts] will. Now I lived underneath just this portion for a long time. The will is that you have you desire, you want. [snorts] But like I said, I didn't have the ability to bring those desires to pass. And that's why I was so frustrated most of my adult life as a Christian, albeit a a backsliden one, because I hadn't surrendered all. But God in his love and his mercy showed me what I was lacking &gt;&gt; to will and to do. [snorts] To do is the energy. It's the act of the ability, the force, the doing. It's the function. It's the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; of his good pleasure. There it is again. &gt;&gt; So God has a purpose for you. &gt;&gt; And he started with a desire in your heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he's been all along nudging, guiding, sending a word here to bring you to the point of where you'll surrender to his Holy Ghost. and then you and him can work together in unison. &gt;&gt; I'm no longer frustrated. I have the joy of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm able to do the things that were always in my heart to do &gt;&gt; because of this right here. Now, here's this is the same thing back there. It's the Holy Spirit. It's the promised land. &gt;&gt; Do all things without murmurings and disputings. That's the rebellion. Because if you have the Holy Ghost and you know you have the power to do the things and you start murmuring, complaining, you're killing your testimony. You got a double tongue. &gt;&gt; It's either God or it's not. You've either surrendered all or you haven't. &gt;&gt; So if you know you have the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; only speak good things. &gt;&gt; It's the testimony of your mouth. &gt;&gt; I had to learn that. There's times in my life where I just wanted to cut my tongue out because this is what got me in the most trouble in all my life is this right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had a sharp tongue. &gt;&gt; My brothers and that, you know, they fought more with their fists. Well, I could cut somebody up and make them feel pretty small, real easy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they say words don't hurt. I'm telling you right now, I'd rather get punched in the face sometime. I'll recover real quick than to get cut up by someone I love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; that you may be blameless and harmless, &gt;&gt; the sons of God, &gt;&gt; without rebuke &gt;&gt; in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Among whom you shine as the lights of the world. &gt;&gt; This to will and to do. &gt;&gt; If you surrender, then you'll become you'll live the word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It'll become so easy to you. You're going to fight, yes, but you'll know the recipe. You're just going to apply the word, humble yourself. All you have to do is feed your soul and starve this. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram talked about the two dogs. &gt;&gt; See, we think we have to do everything by this &gt;&gt; this this. It's not. &gt;&gt; It's by this &gt;&gt; by this. &gt;&gt; It's by the word of God. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; If you got to work some, and I'm not knocking against it, but you'll get to the point where you understand that if you're doing something by the sweat of your brow, God will bless it. But if you have a desire to be there for your family, to be in your post of duty here, and you give God your best, and you still come here, &gt;&gt; God will bless you more than you can with your own muscles and your own effort. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how God wants us to walk. Right. &gt;&gt; Trusting on him. &gt;&gt; The message teaches there's a time coming where you won't even be able to provide with your own muscles. It's all going to be taken away from you. &gt;&gt; It's only your faith. &gt;&gt; Holding forth the word of life. &gt;&gt; That's what we do when we go to work. When we drive the streets, we're holding for a lived life. You can go to work and talk all day about this, but if you don't live that before them, I'm in sales. People can smell a fake person a mile away. &gt;&gt; God has really blessed blessed me in [snorts] my efforts in sales and I break all the sales rules. &gt;&gt; I go to just to genuinely help and surf. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's a gift as a deacon. I don't know. But it sure helped me in sales. Just disconnect. Not being a selfish. I just had a customer on Friday. They wanted to spend $15,000. I'm like, "You don't need to do that. Just buy the $6,000 option. You can replace I wouldn't be able to live with myself. &gt;&gt; Just like brother Brandham couldn't even drive away with candy in his pocket. He had to go back. And &gt;&gt; that's the same Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; This mouth will only speak truth. &gt;&gt; Most times when this mouth opened up, it just lies would spill out so easily. I didn't even know they were lies anymore. &gt;&gt; It's true. I won't give devil an inch. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Okay, 25 minutes. I think we'll get there. Remember, there's a war here. I'm not I'm not denying that. But the war, if you're standing and you know you please God, you know, there's so many places in the Bible where Galatians, you don't have to go there. I'll just paraphrase. The flesh lust again, the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. These are contrary one to the other. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Romans 7 19. The good that I would do not, but the evil which I do &gt;&gt; that I do. &gt;&gt; Frustrating. Very frustrating. &gt;&gt; I lived there for so long. Watch [snorts] and pray. This is Matthew 26:41. Watch and pray. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. [snorts] &gt;&gt; The Bible never hides the struggle. Paul confessed it openly. Jesus acknowledged it. The prophets lived it and we feel it. &gt;&gt; But there is a victory. &gt;&gt; There is a victory. &gt;&gt; There's a longing for God. There's a pull from the flesh. &gt;&gt; There's a desire to pray, a laziness of the body. &gt;&gt; The hunger is for the word, distraction of the world. These are all the realities. But make good choices. &gt;&gt; Make good choices. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Okay. Had right. We'll start. I just want to do some quotes on this thirst because it all begins with thirst. Now I didn't realize this but this is what brother uh what she said. This is from I have heard but now I see [snorts] paragraph 162 163. I said it's up to you to make your decision. I cannot make your decision. [snorts] She looked around the little woman all at once. She said, "Brother Brown, the greatest thing, the greatest, my greatest desire [snorts] in my heart is the salvation of my two boys." &gt;&gt; Remember, she could have a million dollars. She could. But her desire, &gt;&gt; she spoke it. God honored it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, this word uh thirst, because thirst is desire, [snorts] I just want to run. I have a lot here. I'll just hit some of them because I don't think I'll have time to get to where I want to get. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Uh this is I mean if anything I spent almost all my time ended up being in the message thirst. I would advise you to go listen to it. I'm going to hit some of the point. I can't hit all the points that I want to but just listen to the message thirst and just ask the Lord to open it up to you. It's from 1965 0919 but it's a he preached thirst. He preached thirsting after life. It's the same type of message, but he really brings this home, especially for you young guys, understanding the desire of your heart and desire of the flesh. He really explains it and lays it all out. &gt;&gt; Just because you stumble and fall in the desires of your flesh doesn't mean you're lost. &gt;&gt; Satan's a liar. &gt;&gt; As long as you have a desire in your heart to serve God, you can always serve God. &gt;&gt; Just pick yourself up, &gt;&gt; make it right. &gt;&gt; Even promise God you'll never do it again. and then you'll probably do it again [snorts] &gt;&gt; because bro God said that all of our our words are lies &gt;&gt; but God one day you'll fall maybe a million times but there has come a point where you'll stand up and you won't fall to it again &gt;&gt; and then you'll have a true victory and you'll understand that I tried a million times &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and I failed but this time I succeeded &gt;&gt; that is the nature of a son and daughter of God &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; they'll get up get up I mean I would hate to be Satan. To see someone just hit you a million times and you just get right back up and stand. Can you imagine if just think about that in a boxing ring or something or you're beating someone up and they just always got back up and you could hit them with your best shot and you'll get right back up again. Just get up. &gt;&gt; Just get back up and walk. &gt;&gt; That desire in you will. You won't be able to stay down. You won't. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh, I'm going to start I'm going to hit some of the points here, but from like paragraph 25 all the way over to 217 in the message thirst. So, I just want to hit some of this. Uh, I might go so quick that you guys might not be able to pull it up. Paragraph 25. Then I was looking and thinking about the word thirst, which is desire. So, I looked up the dictionary to see what it means. And here it is what Webster says. It's a painful desire. painful when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you. [snorts] &gt;&gt; 26 God gave God has given us that he would do give us a desire for something. [snorts] He's given you a control tower, something that sets inside of you that controls these different desires. And this thirst, this control tower that sets in a man's heart is something that God give him to warn him of desires that's needful for him. So if you're desiring something, you need it. Remember he talked about the kid with the eating the I think it was the erasers on the pencils or the p uh the &gt;&gt; pedal on a &gt;&gt; even mothers when they're pregnant will needs it. desiring the Holy Spirit. So if you're desiring the Holy Spirit, it means you need it. &gt;&gt; And that's why you have a desire for it. &gt;&gt; I desired, like I've said this many a times, but how God brought me back was I had a desire to be a good husband and a father. &gt;&gt; And for three and a half years, I tried and I thought I was, but my wife's testimony was, "No, you're not." So, we did counseling with the pastor and the pastor's wife. Best decision we I ever made. And it was hard. The thoughts that went through my mind, how could this be? But I sat through it and it hurt. But I'm sitting there with three people that I know and I trust and I love and I know they have the Holy Spirit and they're telling me there's something off in your life. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I look at it as a private interview. If the prophet was in the land today, &gt;&gt; we would all be lined up &gt;&gt; and he would discern. I'm telling you right now, the gift of the pastor is no different. &gt;&gt; It's not Barry and Lisa. There's a gift of ministry and the Holy Ghost will honor it. &gt;&gt; If you're lacking something in your life, you can't overcome it, have a private interview. Come on people. &gt;&gt; We're brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; We're family. We're all here for one another. &gt;&gt; Put the put the man aside. &gt;&gt; Feed that inner man. &gt;&gt; That's how I overcome. That's a part of it. I had a desire I couldn't understand. And then through the gift of a pastor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I heard something that I didn't want to hear. &gt;&gt; But that desire in me was stronger than my pride. I was willing to walk through it and it circumcised it away from me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was painful. Yes. But the joy that I now get to live, &gt;&gt; brother, it was worth it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've had a terrible life, I'd say. But you know what? I wouldn't change a thing now because it got me to where I am today. [applause] &gt;&gt; You told me five, six years ago I'd be standing here talking about I'd be like, "You're nuts. It's [snorts] by the Holy Spirit that I can do this. Amen. And I understand now all the little things that I went through. I used to want to hide them. Now I'll talk about them because that's how I defeat Satan with them because he has no when I can go and openly talk about my failures and my faults and I overcome. Satan loses all power of it. &gt;&gt; You're a son and daughter of God. You have faults and you have failures. Don't be afraid to talk about because that's how you'll be truly free from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. talks about desires in there. He talks about physical and spiritual, but then he talks about he goes to Psalms where David says, "My heart, you know, my soul thirsts after the living God." And that's what you have to find. Not just the word, it's the living word. Come face to face with him. [snorts] Happened some years ago, tale that someone told me. Uh, but for the living God, a God that's ever present, and his soul thirsted. He's talking about David. For that God, not for some historical thing. Amen. Uh, 29. And now the control tower in you is what directs you and tells you what you have need of spiritually speaking. And [snorts] it's brought and I'm just skipping down through what I've highlighted. I'm sorry. It's the only way I can get through it. And it's brought to you by thirst. And there's a control tower in your soul that tells [snorts] you the spiritual things that you have need of or something in your spirit. And you by this can tell what kind of life is controlling you. So this is a what is your desire of your heart, your soul. He's telling you by those desires, you can discern whether or not you have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; When you can see what your desires are, then you can tell by that what kind of something that's in you that's creating this desire that you have. See, there's a certain thing that you thirst for, and it can tell you what your you in your soul what this desire is, the nature of the thirsts that you have. I hope that you can understand that. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, even though I fell to my flesh, that my desire was always to serve God. &gt;&gt; I just didn't have the ability. God didn't put me on a hospital with cancer, but I had spiritual cancer &gt;&gt; and I've been completely healed from it. &gt;&gt; You can't see it other people because there I've had in the last year, I've spoken to more people about God and where I go to church than I have my entire life. Not even they ask me because there's an atmosphere I bring with me. I've even seen people in their homes just lay out their whole lives and they're like, "Man, I've never told I know what it is, but it's just a reassurance for me." They're like, "I've never told anyone this." People say, "You just seem so trustworthy. I just feel at ease and peace with you." I've had some very important people in my life, people that know me my whole life, and in the last year said, "Donald, I don't recognize you. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're not the same man. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's a noticeable difference. Even if you were born and raised in this message, there's a noticeable difference. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Each tower is a warning caller for the needs of the other. Each one calls to the need for what the caller is calling for. It sends out a wave of warning. &gt;&gt; So, there's a war, right? For instance, the flesh thirsts to satisfy the desires that's in the body and the spirit desires the things that's in the soul. Desire is and many times these war one against the other. We find there that that's a great trouble today. Too many people try to live between these two desires. &gt;&gt; For one of them desires the [snorts] things of the earth, the other desires the things of heaven. &gt;&gt; That was me. &gt;&gt; That [snorts] was me. I lived that. If he's talking about anyone, that's me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I chose my place came where like the rich young ruler and I had to choose. It was life or death. &gt;&gt; Let's talk about uh you go read them. I I have so many here. It'll talk about that that desire in you will actually vindicate to you who you are. the thirst. Uh he talks about Isaiah and he had that thirst and that's when he realized I'm a man of unclean lips and uh he talks so well about it better than I ever could. Obviously I'm just paring the prophet but with a revelation and experience in my own life. It's not just words. I I I lived it. I see the life behind it. [snorts] He talks about it's God himself in you. It's a satisfying portion is what he brings to. And that's what I'm trying to express is that all my frustrations are gone now. Now I have the joy of the Lord. Truly I can stand here and say it all I want but others can say that's true. The [snorts] Holy Ghost satisfies every fiber of your soul. He actually talks about amen. He says until the Holy Spirit itself is bubbling in you. Amen. Even if you don't have that and I'm speaking about is creating a desire in you then that's a godly desire. [snorts] He talks about be able to discern by desire. The Holy Spirit he only he talks about having this thirst. You can either try and satisfy it with something else or you can actually not try and sat and it'll die. So he talks about trying to feed it something and he talks about the Holy Spirit will only feed on the word and you can't even you try and feed it something it knows. He says so that's why once you you always want to be just walking in the word because that's the only thing that's going to satisfy you now right 100% the word. Uh he goes if not you'll spiritually die and that's what happened to the rich young ruler. He did all these good things, &gt;&gt; but brother Ram says that it never really counted much because he missed out on this chance of eternal life, right? [snorts] He says, "You will die." He actually in here talks about a Bible hitchhiker that you just pick the the word that you, you know, is comfortable for you and easy for you to live and you skip over. And he calls him a Bible hitchhiker. &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't try and feed it the wrong thing." He goes, "You've got to uh belong to Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to give into that desire. [snorts] Then he talks about fellowship, walking with God through fellowship. So that's Amen. Like I said, I've got so many here. Uh then he talks about the dove and the dove's diet, &gt;&gt; right? And it can't eat these other things. It'll kill it, &gt;&gt; right? So that's why when you get the Holy Spirit, you only start feeding on good things. Then he talks about the deep call to the deep. It takes it takes more, right? It takes something to satisfy inside of you that pours down from God into the soul. The deep callth to the deep at the noise of thy water spouts, oh Lord, the deep calling to the deep. Then he he ends it with, "What kind of thirst could we think was in us tonight?" We as Pentecostal people or message believers, where are we getting to? So, [snorts] excuse me. [snorts] What kind of a thirst is in us? What kind of a a thirst is in me? What kind of a thirst is you? Don't try to hush that holy thirst of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have that thirst, count yourself very blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to talk about this and and the pastor has been preaching on this. It was actually at a lasia church age and it's about overcoming. So I was trying to show that a thirst is good and then it brings you to the Holy Ghost and that's very good. But now there's an exceedingly abundantly good where God when you start working in unison with the Holy Ghost. You're a helpmate to the Holy Ghost. You're going to be like Joseph. &gt;&gt; It might not be in the material things, but spiritually speaking, even in this world, because God will give you the resources that you need to be able to fulfill your purpose. &gt;&gt; And it's it's so good now to be able to live and move with purpose in my life. And it's not a purpose in a fleshly way. It's a purpose that was born to be. &gt;&gt; It's a purpose to be a father according to the word of God, a husband, &gt;&gt; a worker. &gt;&gt; My desire is that one day, what's happening at my work right now is amazing. My desire is one day my manager or the owner comes to me, he's like, "What are you doing? How are you getting these results?" I want to be able to stand there and say, "I'm simply following the teachings of the Bible and a vindicated prophet. I'm applying it to my life and you get the benefit from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is my desire. &gt;&gt; Later to see a church age. Now what are we over what are we to overcome? That is the normal question to ask here. But that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we have we are to overcome but how we are to overcome. Now this is logical for does it matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome. &gt;&gt; And then he said in Matthew 4 I'm just going to skip down wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil. He co overcome the personal temptation of Satan by the [clears throat] word and by the word only. &gt;&gt; This is the voice of a vindicated prophet. You can try it any other way you want, but it's only by making word-based decisions, &gt;&gt; applying it to your life. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to skip down, but Jesus overcame by the word. &gt;&gt; And right now, let me say this that this is the only way to be an overcomer. Also is the only way that you can know &gt;&gt; if you are overcoming because that word can't fail. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. And if he begun a good work in you, &gt;&gt; that word can't fail. &gt;&gt; But you have to choose to die out to yourself. &gt;&gt; And that good work, let it start to manifest, start working with. &gt;&gt; Now, this is as clear as it gets. Notice now again how Jesus overcame the world systems of religion when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day. He constantly applied the word. simple but not always easy &gt;&gt; because this man is in total opposition to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now I'm going to go into how can I overcome? &gt;&gt; Yep. I think uh we'll be just in time. This is from uh let me see here. Yeah. 19 63825 in the morning. How can I overcome? Jesus told us how to do it. He overcome means overcome means to stand the test. &gt;&gt; That's right. Like all the old saints did. Like Jesus did. Amidst all of his enemies, he stood the test. Everything he was tested against, he stood it. In the very face of sickness, him being Messiah, he healed them. In the face of death, he brought remember the same life &gt;&gt; that was in him &gt;&gt; has to be in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brought back. In the face of Calvary, his own death, he defeated it by surrendering himself. &gt;&gt; Why? By the word said, you destroy this temple and I'll write raise it up in three days. The word said so. See, you're putting your faith in this word, not in your ability or your interpretation. It's by the word. &gt;&gt; Why? But sorry. All by the word and humility. Oh my. There's a real man. There's the one to make your example. See, he defeated everything. Overcome it. 105. Overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks. &gt;&gt; This man, this man. Okay, that's some I'll tell you right now, once you get control of this guy, all of a sudden, he'll start using outside forces because he can't get you this way anymore. A lot of people says there is no devil. It's just a thought. Don't you believe that? There's a real devil. &gt;&gt; He's just as real as you and I are to or anybody. A real devil that you must recognize him real. &gt;&gt; You must know that he's a devil. &gt;&gt; Then the same time you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you. &gt;&gt; Then to overcome, you must recognize that the God in you &gt;&gt; is greater and mightier &gt;&gt; than he is. &gt;&gt; That's the one that's in you &gt;&gt; has already overcome. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why in the Bible it says Abraham at 99 met God. He knew he could drive down a stake and say, "Listen, I I had my encounter and I chose life." Noah was God met him. It says that he walked with God. He chose life. And by his grace, you are more than a match for him. &gt;&gt; See, not you by yourself, you with the Holy Ghost. exceedingly abundantly working together. There's a real overcomering overcoming when you recognize. &gt;&gt; See, yes, we are a sinner saved by grace. &gt;&gt; But I'm also a son and daughter of God &gt;&gt; who's died out to himself &gt;&gt; and allowing the Holy Ghost to bring to pass the purpose that I was born here for. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't let your testimony only be never forget that yes, you're a sinner side by grace, but you're here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; It's to fulfill the word of God to overcome &gt;&gt; and all you got to do is he's already done it &gt;&gt; in Revel. Okay, if we're to reflect the word of God, what is the last major event that Jesus did? He descended with the open book &gt;&gt; and put his feet on the earth. He took all things under control. &gt;&gt; So if he's in you, What are you going to reflect? &gt;&gt; You're going to be able to overcome all these things because he's already done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You look back and say, "I'm doing this and I'm doing that." Then no, you're defeated. &gt;&gt; But there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, that walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. &gt;&gt; Then you realize that you've overcome. &gt;&gt; Remember, he said that you went to Calvary with them, you died with them, you you raised with them. Don't let that just be a theological message truth. &gt;&gt; Let it be reality in your life. &gt;&gt; He says just walk in it. Just choose it. &gt;&gt; Satan has no control. &gt;&gt; None. He's defeated. He when Jesus died on the cross, and I'm saying this now, and I've said it for many time, but now I I say it with revelation that it's done. You just have to die to yourself now and enjoy the benefits of it. Lord, &gt;&gt; but there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. Then you realize that you've overcome. Talking about walking, &gt;&gt; right? Walking with God. &gt;&gt; And you know that he is a devil. You can't say, "I got a sickness and I I don't believe it's a sickness." See, he's not about whistling by the graveyard and saying that, "Oh, yes, it's a sickness." You got cancer. Yeah. Don't believe it's Don't believe it's a cancer. It's a cancer. It is a cancer. But remember, greater is he that is in you &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; You must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this &gt;&gt; thing. And he's in you &gt;&gt; and you can overcome by him. That's exactly sensible. &gt;&gt; It's exactly the way the scriptures written, &gt;&gt; overcoming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Iius said, I don't even think I've read it before, but that's okay. For the glory of God is the living man, [snorts] and the life of man consists in beholding God. That's that to mahood. For the glory of God is in the living man shall live by every word that proceedth. &gt;&gt; And the life of man consists in beholding. So once you know you've beholding God, you can truly live. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come. Sorry [snorts] that was what's on my heart. &gt;&gt; I don't have the best of way and ability of explain it, but this is how the Lord has moved on me. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; I have two closings here. I'm going to choose one and I'll get you to go read the other. to scriptures. I'm going to read Ephesians 3:14-21 as to sum all this up. Everything you'll see now comes. I only found this this morning, this scripture. The other one is Isaiah 58:1-14. Go read it because it's about when the Jews, they were serving God. They were fasting and keeping the Sabbath, but they weren't they weren't doing it in the joy and love of serving God. They were doing it for their own pro. and go read the promise that he gives them if they'll return from he says do it in a loving way. This is what this message is about. If you don't love coming to church and worshiping God, if you don't love serving God, &gt;&gt; there's something wrong. &gt;&gt; It's not g commandments aren't grievious. &gt;&gt; If you're in love with him, it becomes your pleasure and his pleasure. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't know how much more simpler I can say that. But I'll tell you this. If you don't have that love, but you have a desire, if you want to get there, &gt;&gt; it's hard, but it's simple. &gt;&gt; Die out to yourself. &gt;&gt; And if you won't, God will bring you to a point where you you'll have to choose. &gt;&gt; I didn't read it. I meant to. The rich young ruler, he he had come to that point. And he was grieved at the word of God. The very thing that he was lacking, God told him in love, it'll either set you free or it'll at that point condemn you [music] to death. Everyone has in that thirst. He's talking about that desire, that thirst will always bring you to [music] that opportunity where you come face to face with God. &gt;&gt; And then you have to choose life or death. &gt;&gt; For some people it might have been one year. Some people it might be 40 or 50 but you'll come to that [music] crossroad if you want to say amen. Ephesians 3:14-21 for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. You have to be married to that name that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might or power, the Holy Ghost by his spirit in the inner man. This man now has to step back and let that son of God truly come forth and manifest. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, the length, the depth, and the height. It's not measurable, folks. It's all-encompassing. I don't know if that's he's talking about the city, but I just know that you can't exhaust God's love and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, the understanding of the message or the Bible if you want to say that you might be filled with all the fullness of God. &gt;&gt; Now fullness is full but he's saying all the fullness exceedingly abundantly &gt;&gt; more. It even comes down here, but over and over again, this is what he's trying to get to you. Give me your best. And I'll take it and multiply it. &gt;&gt; That is true strength. It's in humility. And to know the love of Christ, which paths knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God. Now onto him that is able to exceedingly abundantly mahood mahood above all that we ask or think. See when we think we want this and that then you get there and you're like it expands. Oh I can more more. Same thing like you might desire I wish I made $100,000. You get there $100,000 seems like much anymore. Oh I want 250,000. You get there and then your mind expands and it's the way the word of God is. When you start walking in that light, you're like, "Well, how far can [music] this really go?" &gt;&gt; It'll change your body. That's how far it'll go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, onto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that workketh in us. Remember back in Philippians, he workketh in us [music] to will and to do. Amen. Unto him be the glory in the church of Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus throughout all ages, with world without end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our testimony and I believe yours is too. All that I am is because of the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I see any good in you, I know it's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you see any good in me, &gt;&gt; please know that it's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's no good thing in this flesh. &gt;&gt; I might be able to, you know, give you a good meal, give you a little bit of money, and maybe a little bit, &gt;&gt; but I know living waters flows out of me now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever I go, &gt;&gt; I understand it's an opportunity now to impart eternal life. &gt;&gt; There was a time when I'd be in a restaurant and I'd pray and I'd do it as quickly and as quiet. I'm not ashamed anymore. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed. &gt;&gt; I go into so many homes now, everyone is hungering for what you have. &gt;&gt; You have to understand that. Don't be ashamed and embarrassed. They're hungering for what you have. &gt;&gt; They might have satisfied it with something else, but they're desiring for what you have. &gt;&gt; So, don't be ashamed of it. &gt;&gt; Walk proudly and humbly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord bless you all. Let's stand together and uh have a word of prayer. Brother Emanuel, if you want to come shortly. Heavenly Father, Lord, [music] thank you for this day and this opportunity, Lord, to get to know you a little more, Father, to express our love and our appreciation to you, Father. Lord, Father, we thank you for the desire that you placed in our heart, Father, Lord, and we thank you for watching over that word, Lord. We truly are your workmanship. It's all you, Father. We just learn to to bend the knee, to bow in humility, Father, and allow you to do that which you have purposed, Lord. We thank you, Lord. Lord, we have no other words, Father. We [music] can't express the gratitude in our hearts, Father. Lord, we just desire to work, walk perfectly before you, Lord, and with you, [music] Father, to invite you into every avenue of our life, Father. Not one corner of our lives left where you can't walk in freely and just enjoy yourself, Father. Lord, we grant you our mouth, our minds, our hands, our feet. Father, our toll beating being. Lord, thou knowest our heart. Father, we're so thankful because we don't have the words to express it, Lord. Father, I ask that you just be with each believer. I don't know where they're at in their journey, Father, but Lord, if they're sitting here today with the desire to serve you, I know the final destination, Lord. Your word declares it, and we accept it, Father. Lord, go us as we go. Father, may we just not leave you at the door. May you go to work with us, Father. Your prophet told us that maybe you're just called to be a housewife, but be the best housewife you can be. you might be called to be a farmer, but be the best farmer [music] that you can be by the Holy Spirit. And Father, forgive us when we have murmured and complained. Lord, we tell you, Lord, we won't do it again. That's our vow to you, Father. Lord, you are good. You fulfill us, Lord. You satisfy us. You are more than enough, Father. Lord, thank you, Lord, for your your love and your mercy and your grace. In Jesus Christ's name we commit ourselves aresh. Grant us traveling mercies. Lord bring the pastor back safe. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Emanuel. What song? &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Sing it. Amen. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; All the world [singing] today no [singing and music] other. Jesus is the [music] way. Amen. Thank you, brother Don, for yielding yourself. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you richly. Were you fed this morning? &gt;&gt; Glory be to the name of the Lord. [applause] You know, I was sitting down. I was standing out at the back and I was thinking how God must love himself. you know that he he he created all these things the mountains and valleys and wonderful lady bones and birds and everything but they were all good. You know when he said it was very good when he created something else that reflected his own attributes &gt;&gt; that was man that was you and I. And it never stopped there &gt;&gt; because he loves the manifestation of his spirit in flesh. &gt;&gt; He loves the manifestation of his attributes. When he sees it, he cannot avoid it. &gt;&gt; And because it was only after man was created that fellowship started. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now when that same spirit manifested again in the Lord Jesus Christ, what did it happen? Says, "This is my beloved son in which I'm well pleased." And I believe that if that spirit gets into any flesh, God will be pleased. Praise the name of the Lord. And I believe that is what God is looking for. And that is why if you if you watch clearly, he's given us everything we need to dress up and look good for him. &gt;&gt; Everything is in the word. Everything is in the message. I believe [music] the challenge is are we willing to take it only that or do we want to add one thing here one thing there and if you are tempted ever think of Queen praise the name of the Lord &gt;&gt; blessing at Calvary just realize I was talking to you &gt;&gt; Amen I spent in vanity [singing] and pride. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; My [music and singing] thought was for me.
