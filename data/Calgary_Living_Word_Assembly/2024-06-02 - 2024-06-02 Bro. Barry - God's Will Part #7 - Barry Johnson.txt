trem what a tremendous atmosphere thank you musicians God bless you today if you have your Bibles I'd just like to I'd like to read two scriptures first scripture we have uh read many times but i' just like to continue taking from that continuing on in our our thought about God's will second Timothy chapter 3 and then I'd like to turn over to Psalms 119 Psalms 119 we'll start with verse 9 but first we'll read 2 Timothy CH 3 starting with verse 10 2 Timothy 3:1 says but thou Hast fully known my Doctrine excuse me manner of life purpose Faith longsuffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch at laconium at leria what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me amen yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution Psalms 119 verse 9 Psalms 119 verse 9 we'll just read verse 11 for now Psalms 119:1 Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for the scripture that we've read this morning Lord knowing it's your word and as we go forwards this morning talking about your word being your will father I pray that scriptures that we've read would just resonate in our hearts Lord that we would understand that you have never left us nor forsaken us and it's always us father that leaves you and father I pray that if anybody needs to come back to you today or anybody here doesn't know you today Father that we would be able to come to know you in the power of your Resurrection father Lord if our cups are a little bit dry today Father we just want to raise them up to you and ask that you would fill our cups Lord Jesus father we pray that you would just minister to us father according to your will which is your word once again we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning you may be seated welcome everyone some people might be wondering what's going on it's June the 2nd and brother Dela delodon isn't here it's brother Barry again and uh I I just got notied this week that brother Dela he had a holdup with his passports uh something to do with his US Visa and they took his passports to process it and he wasn't able to get it back and so it it's the natural circumstances but we know full well that God never wanted him here today or he would be right here today that's just the way God works so we certainly thank the Lord for his leadership and his guidance and uh we just said to brother Dela you know when the Lord works it out we'd certainly love to have him come um his schedule is absolutely full and uh I'm sure that as you know if you understand what traveling Ministry is like when you make arrangements um it's like a stack of dominoes and if you take one Domino out it makes it just about impossible for the rest of them to work and God just decided that this wouldn't work for him so his schedule is booked and uh we may or may not see him this Summer we'll just see what the Lord has in store so that's why brother Barry's here today and not brother Dela I do apologize for anyone that might be confused or if anybody came specifically to see brother Dela I do apologize but I hope you didn't come to see brother Dell I hope you came to see the Lord because that's why we gather together you don't want to gather together to see a man if that's the only reason you come you come for the wrong reason because a man will always disappoint always disappoint it's only God that can make the difference in our lives we have a a prayer meeting June the 6th at 7:30 p.m. we have a church cleanup next Saturday I believe it is June the 8th and I think we'll probably did we have a time 10:00 that's okay if you want to come a little bit early that's fine too there's usually always coffee and we can have a little bit of fellowship before we start to sweat uh remember many hands make light work it's not just one or two persons that make this happen it is everyone it's a many membered body so we appreciate all the help we can get uh we have brother marot Chua here on June the 9th we certainly look forward to seeing him and family I believe will be here as well um we have a worship service on June 23rd at 6: p.m. so uh we just just definitely want to encourage anybody that has a desire to sing a special and uh if you want to come and just worship God by all means come show the devil whose side you're on we don't need to preach we can just sing unto the Lord and it doesn't have to be uh all specials it can just be congregational worship unto God but maybe a few specials mixed in is is a real good thing that's kind of what I would like to see but we'll just let it happen the way the Lord wants it to uh we have brother Cadre digs here on June 26th and we have the the youth service the youth function uh June the 30th at our house after the service on Sunday and uh it looks like I did it again I do apologize on the 12th we have uh brother Jack Duff but this time I caught it it's in June it's not July I was saying July so it's a busy month with uh different ministers but certainly look forward to seeing each and every one of them you happy this morning we've been talking about his will being his word and we've had a a tremendous study so far this is part seven of I don't know how many in a series but um it's just been a a wonderful discussion about his will being his word and just from a specific angle that I believe the Lord has shown me about it and uh sometimes it's just a good thing to to recognize that his will is very important but many times it can be over complicated it can become a complex sometimes almost like an algebraic equation and that's just exactly the way the devil likes it to be doesn't he he likes it to become confusing he likes us to wonder he likes us to ask are we in God's will is this really the direction that I should be going is this really the life I should be living God knows exactly where we are he knows exactly who our name what our name is he knows our parents he knows all about us many times we just need to learn about ourselves but you know uh the angle that I'm taking this from is that his will is his word and it's not a destination I've said it in the past we talked about Joseph studyed Joseph's life and now we're into Daniel and Daniel's life and his will it it's not just his word and and saying that it's his will is his word um I'm I'm wording this wrong it's not just a destination his will isn't whether we should go to university and get a University degree e even though if we're aspiring to do that we really ought to see if that's what God wants us to do and we ought to commit all of our ways unto the Lord if we should go to a specific church we should see if that's God's will for us and there's going to be one resounding way to tell whether that's God's will for our life does the preaching at that church line up with the message of the hour if it doesn't line up with the message of the hour I strongly recommend that you don't go to that church because it's not going to send you to the right destination but his will is his word but it's not necessarily a destination it's not necessarily a place that we're going to travel to I want to go and travel to Vancouver should it be God's will for me to go and we know the word of God don't get me wrong says Lord willing we ought to say we should do this or we should do that that means we should be considering God in all of our ways but it's not necessarily where we're at or where we're going that's not where we're getting at when we talk about his will being his word it's not where we're at it's not where we're going I want to say this brothers and sisters it's who we are it's who we are do you have his word in your heart that you might not sin against him many times we look at that scripture I think that's a lovely Sunday school scripture isn't it it's a great memory verse for children we learn that as a child and we take it home and we think about it and many times we can just take these verses and and put them away in our pocket and say yeah I know that verse yeah Psalms 1119 yep it's great with Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee but let's just examine that scripture a little bit maybe try and unpack it Lord willing by the the Holy Spirit today by the Holy Ghost to see really are we hiding his word in our heart according to the message of the hour many people will take his word and put it in their heart and there'll be theologians about the Bible but they can't follow that Bible the only way we're going to be able to have his word in our heart truly is to have himself in our heart today brothers and sisters many people claim it but not many people can say I can actually follow all of the word because his will is his word amen and many people will say well we've got all the word we're we're a we're a uh oh my we're we're a Full Gospel Ministry aren't we we have the whole Bible we preach the whole Bible according to our religion according to our tradition but it's not about where we're going it's not about where we've been necessarily and it's not about what we're going to be it's who we are right now brothers and sisters it's it's it's the present tense I am he is the I am every moment of our life is God living out through us and and it's who we are and I I I just we we prayed about it this morning and I just can't help but come back to that and think I want to impress in our hearts when we when we hear the words this morning when we think about his will being his word we're not just ordinary people we are a special class of people we're a prophetic class of people because we've been given the ability to hear the message of the hour the words of God given to a Vindicated profit to this age this is something that we cannot just Overlook and take for granted and say you know I I I know the message I I I've got the prophet I I've got all the books and tapes I've even got the app on my phone well good for us right what good does it do it if we don't live it he gave very specific instructions and brothers and sisters when we try and interpret that word when we try and interpret what the prophet said to us and make it suit Our Lives my goodness you know what we're doing we're heading down the road of balum and baac we're going to take God's word now and try and adapt it to suit Our Lives instead of taking our lives and trying to adapt it to suit God's word there's a major difference there oh my but the devil is so subtle so subtle he'll say well our parents did that and they got away with it everything was fine for them was it is it it's not about them this is about us the present tense I am and you know what I want to do is impress on us brothers and sister sisters that we if we have the ability to hear this message of the hour if we have the ability to receive it all even when it takes our hide off doesn't feel good you know what we are we are the manifested sons and daughters of the most high God living out in this age that makes us automatically that special class of people that prophetic group of people that can hear what the spirit says to the age not everyone has that ability but you know as we go forwards we want his perfect will and I I'm I'm I'm going to get into his perfect will versus his permissive will but maybe not so much today as we go we're going to get into Daniel we're going to pick up where we left off last time I think it's so incredible the story but maybe it's just me I don't know but we do have a perfect will of God and we have a permissive will of God and if you look it up in the message brother bradam he uses it over and over again he talks about balum and baac and the perfect will of God and the permissive will of God and many times God will just give us over he'll say you know what you've asked me and I know your heart's desire you just want to go ahead and do that thing anyway so I'm just going to say God bless you go ahead and do your thing don't worry about it just help yourself but that doesn't change God's will his first answer is his only answer it's not going to change the more we pray to him and say I just really want to do this thing I wish you would allow me to do this thing it's not the way it works out of the handwriting on the wall 1956 I read this last week I just wanted to pick up as sort of a picking up where we left off the recap just have a few visitors here today I just wanted to welcome brother Kenneth Sister Irene and Shir they're friends of brother Peter and Sister Janet from Ghana God bless you today and we have some other visitors from Nigeria I I hope I say this right forgive me if I don't and Dam dami and AD from Nigeria God bless you I'm not sure where everyone's at today I trust you feel right at home you have the quotes brother you do amen 1956 the handwriting on the wall brother brandham speaking here he says now I want you to notice as soon as the king saw this Vision talking about Nebuchadnezzar we're going to get into this uh notice as soon as the king saw this vision and he made it he forced every person in his kingdom in his domain to worship this image he made an image we're going to get into the image that's where we left off last week he made an image and it's believed by scholars in which I do believe that a spirit filled person would see it that he worshiped Daniel that was the image that he created theologians will uh say that when we went to Bible College they taught us that that was an image of Nebuchadnezzar because he was such a narcissistic King but if you go and you read the scriptures it does not one time say that was an image of Nebuchadnezzar and if you look at the Scripture it follows directly after Daniel was used by God to give the interpretation of the dream that this King had first God gave the king the dream let's be clear and then God gave the ability to interpret the dream and and and we know that that's what uh he did here but he says I do believe that a Spirit-filled person would see it that that he worshiped Daniel is what he did and he made an image to Daniel and he called it belthazar he called Daniel belshazzar which is the name of his God and he made an image and forced every person to worship that image he says I want you to notice that the beginning of the Gentiles when God dwelt with dealt with them they got hottie in their heart and forced every man to worship the image of a holy man and the Gentile age was issued in with that it will go out in the same way the same way a boycott of the mark of the beast that will force the people to worship images and to do the things that we've been taught that was contrary to the word of God now I believe that that little tiny sentence there kind of almost lands in a space of time right that will force people to worship images and to do things that we've been taught was contrary to the word of God and brother it'll be so slick and Sly until it will deceive the very elect if possible so I just want to I just want to pause here and talk about this for a little bit brothers and sisters this to me would indicate this isn't going to be out there in the world this isn't going to be raging monsters it's not going to be a zombie apocalypse is not going to be all of the mark of the beast coming and rounding up people and putting them into internment camps and making them March through and get the mark of the beast and if they refuse it then they get killed all of that could happen and likely will somewhere along the way but what we're talking about is the spiritual coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and to reject that which is the word from a Vindicated prophet in our day to reject that is to accept automatically spiritually the mark of the beast we had this prophet say that the thought in the forehead is the mark in the forehead and then to take that Mark and actually make it apply to the movement in our hands is the action part of it and so we have the mark in our forehead and then we have the mark on our hand our action towards it and I want to say today brothers and sisters don't think that the devil isn't Sly enough to say and and take this word and mix it up so far in our lives it's not just the action of doing something against the word of God many times we can look at people and say oh they went created an awful website and they created all of the things and they're all against the word of God I want to say this brothers and sisters in action to live according to the message of the hour is the same thing the devil don't care what side of the road you go off on but we know remember there is a Highway and there is a holy way down the middle of the highway that brother Bram talked about it's in the word of God we know that but in action in action according to this word of God is going to be counted exactly the same as coming against the word of God because it would have been better for us not to have known about the message of the hour than to hear it and then claim it and then not live it right Lord have mercy and brother it'll be so slick and Sly until it will deceive the very elect if possible all so where is it going to be brothers and sisters in the Baptist denomination how many elect are in there maybe Lots probably not lots because they're willing to cling to a denominational teaching who knows we know brother bradam said that there's Believers in every group and it's not up to us to put people in or take people out it's up to God to judge but I want to say this it'll be so slick and Sly till it will deceive the very elect if it were possible so you better purpose in your heart tonight this morning and be filled with God's holy spirit that you'll be able to discern the right and the wrong thing when the proclamation is issued Hallelujah cuz remember brothers and sisters we don't know what what what 10 minutes after service is going to hold for us we don't know what tomorrow has in store and when those times come in our lives we don't don't have time to pray it's too late our praying time is over we've already had the opportunity to show where we stand he says when we see all the Easter remember this is my what year is this 1956 1956 when we see all the Eastern Middle Eastern Powers when we see the eastern and western world again again uniting see them two feet in Daniel's Vision see it's just repeating again it's just a Revival of the old Roman Empire coming up as certain as I'm standing here it's true it's time for Daniels to rise it's time for Daniels to rise it's time for people who will purpose in their heart that they'll live true to God Amen and to the Holy Spirit and to the principles of the Bible regardless of rest of what the rest of the world will say and and brother Barry is going to throw this in here this morning brothers and sisters it's time for people who will purpose in their heart that they'll live true to God and true to the Holy Spirit and to the principles of the Bible and to the principles of the message of the hour regardless of what the rest of the world says it doesn't matter what anybody else says what anybody else does amen because God's not going to say oh you you heard about the message of the hour didn't you yep but your brother or your sister they just didn't like it and and so they talked bad about the the minister and you you just sort of sided with them and you didn't really take a stand and because of that you couldn't really live according to it either so that's okay don't worry about it it's not going to be that way it's not going to ask about anybody else's experience except for ours we're going to stand before him and give an account for our lives and we know Paul said Lord don't let us do it with shame let us do it with joy that we could count it all joy that we know people actually were able to receive the word you know receiving the word is one thing but living it is a totally different thing it's a totally different thing brothers and sisters we're not we're not running a sprinting race this is not something that we can just have uh uh uh oh my former Pastor said it so I'm I'm just going to say it it's not bad A A Hallelujah H holdown we were right downtown with the Stampede you know we can have a great Revival today and just be out in the world tomorrow what does that by not getting sealed in by the holy spirit in our lives we're talking about the perfect will versus the permissive will from the angle of Daniel turn turn with me over to Daniel chapter 3 as we get into the the study today I do want to get into a real specific study maybe next time next week we get to do this it will be definitely about the perfect will versus the permissive will we know that in in Daniel chapter 2 was the story of the dream and the image and uh how King Nebuchadnezzar erected an image and we know that that image was of Daniel Daniel chter 3:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits and a bread thereof six cubits and he set it up in the plain of dura in the province of Babylon then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up then the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up then a heral cried aloud to you it is commanded oh people Nations and languages that at what time ye hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbut Sury duler and all kinds of music ye Fall Down and Worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up and who so fth not down and worshipthe same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbut Sal tree and all kinds of music all the people the Nations and the languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up so we can see the story is set up now the image has been erected it's been raised and it's there for a purpose Daniel showed something tremendously Supernatural something that all of his magicians and Sorcerers and and advisers all of his committees they could never do and they even admitted it no man can do what you're saying to do remember he said I've got this dream and I need to know what's the interpretation of this dream and they came and they said oh King just tell us what the dream is and we'll be happy to give you the interpretation he said no you tell me the dream and then I'll know you actually are able to do the interpretation of it but if you can't tell me the dream then you know what you're going to be cut into pieces and your houses will be dung Hills what a terrible thing for those people and you can see that he was probably fed up with them and and he was troubled by this and and this is where I just think it's so beautiful we know this was God actually giving him a directive so that he would know exactly that God is over top of all of the Affairs of man that it wasn't just something surprising verse 8 says wherefore at the time certain calans came near and accused the Jews you can imagine in this situation how we have the kingdom and I think we talked about this in the past I'll try and get through it quickly but how had the kingdom and how all these people grew up in this Kingdom and worked their way up in the kingdom and made themselves uh politicians and followers and and all of the king's people they did everything they were taught to do they were trained up to serve the king to get high-ranking positions in the kingdom and we could even say what it is princes Governors captains judges the treasurers the counselors of the sheriffs the sheriffs and the rulers of all the provinces so this is everyone with a position in the country in Nebuchadnezzar's Kingdom but all these people witnessed all of the children being taken out of the land of Israel brought in as captives and suddenly now this one Daniel Rises to the top above everyone else suddenly this king is esteeming these guys this one in particular and he's bringing his friends along with him to one of the highest not just one of the highest but the highest position in the kingdom and isn't it interesting it's just like Joseph rising to the right hand of pharaoh where Pharaoh said you know what everything in the kingdom is yours you've got access to everything here the only thing is this Throne is mine but everything else is in your hands and here we have Daniel now rising to a place like that because of God yes not because he studied the Bible necessarily not because he had good church attendance not because of anything that he did other than he would not compromise on the word of God in his life and because of that we know that when the king made the pro Proclamation everyone's going to die he said wait you're being a little bit Hasty let's just do something about this let's just go and pray about it and what a what a tremendous thing that is even for the little things in our lives brothers and sisters to just pause for a second and just go and pray about it and and see what God has to say but many times we can trip over ourselves trying to find an answer for a solution that God's waiting to give us so Daniel he takes his friends and goes and prays about it comes back gives the interpretation we know the whole story but what what happened was he was elevated because of it to the place now you could imagine all of these guys lived their whole lives to get to this place we heard brother brandham say very clearly that that statue was an image of Daniel 60 foot Daniel raised up in the plains of dura and now all of these guys have to bow down to this guy he's a captive but now they're worshiping not just bowing down but Bow Down and Worship when you hear the sound of all of that it's a beautiful thing when you think about it because this King was extreme he wasn't interested in just going part way he was All or Nothing wasn't he King Nebuchadnezzar but I can't help but think he he actually was tapping into something he was seeing something and he just couldn't put his finger on it there was something really strange going on and and he really wanted to know what was going on and you know if you want to just turn with me over to Jeremiah chapter 39 when we're talking about Nebuchadnezzar this was a king that heard a prophecy this King heard about this prophecy and there's a reason why I want to point this out in in verse 11 of chapter 39 of Jeremiah my footnotes or the sorry the title at the top of the page here says Jeremiah loosed he was the prophet that was mistreated but he got loose verse 11 says now Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar sorry king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to neb zeran the captain of the Guard saying take him and look well to him and do him no harm why is that why would the King give his captain charge to let this prophet go when everyone else in the kingdom was sacked or taken prisoner yet this one was being told by the king to be set free and I I'll just leave it you can go through and read it for time sake I'm going to jump to to chapter 40 verse1 the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after that nebu zeran the captain of the Guard had led him go from Rama when he had taken him being bound in Chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah which were carried away captive unto Babylon and the captain of the Guard took Jeremiah and said unto him the Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place now the Lord hath brought it and done according as he hath said because ye have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed his voice therefore this thing is come upon you and now behold I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand if it seem good unto thee come with me unto Babylon to come to Babylon come and I will look well unto thee but if it is seem ill unto thee to come with me unto Babylon forbear behold all the land is before thee whether it seeth good and convenient for thee to go to their go so I just want to point out Jeremiah by following the word of the Lord at all expense just about everyone in the Kingdom there was a few but just about everyone in the Kingdom rejected the word in his mouth they said oh we know who your parents are his daddy did service in the temple and he actually started to hear the voice of the Lord and He alls he could do was follow the lord follow the the leadership of the Lord nobody was nudging him along saying you should be a prophet you should do this you should do that all he was doing was hearing from God and by doing so he spoke the word of God and God said to them because you've rejected me as your king you will now pay and we know the whole entire kingdom was sacked the whole story we know it I I don't want to go too far into it but what I do want to say is this King Nebuchadnezzar he understood there was a prophet in the land even the enemy from the north understood there was a prophet in the land isn't that amazing to think because of that he let him go and that's just astounding when you think about it because the only reason he did it we know it was God God said to him hey let my Prophet go and do them no harm but this King here was pretty full of himself he had he had a lot of character that he needed to express and uh so he erected this image he didn't know how to deal with this he knew somehow there was something going on and and we know that the the Babylonian religion which is the same as many other religions ancient religions even now modern religions I guess there's multiple gods a and you can have even a trinitarian religion where you've got more than one God you've got three distinct person of the Trinity we know that that's not even biblical but that's the way it is you can have many different gods and this is what Nebuchadnezzar was looking at he's like well I I can see that Daniel's God is a powerful God look at his God but all these other people there's something different about them we'll go on and read here verse verse 8 of uh Daniel chapter 3 wherefore at that time certain Chans came near and accused the Jews and they spake and said unto King Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever and you can imagine these were the ones who were jealous they were green with jealousy With Envy about all these captives coming in now and now suddenly here they are rising to a certain level of of political stature in the land and and now they don't have to listen but all the other ones do everyone else has to follow what the king says but now these ones are going to stand out my verse 10 thou oh King Hast made a decree that every man shall hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbut Sultry and damer and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image and who so falth not down and worshipthe fiery furnace now we have the story laid out we've got the accusation coming up in verse 12 there are certain Jews whom thou Hast set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach mesach and Abednego these men man oh King have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up now I think we might have left off somewhere around there last time I think it's so beautiful it's just like the disciples in the book of Acts we know in the book of Acts it was the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles it's not the acts of the apost Apostles it's the acts of the Holy Spirit the apostles but here we have the apostles Jesus saying go ye forth into all the world and baptize in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost right that was the instructions that Jesus gave but they knew who Jesus was they knew who God was they knew his name and his name was Lord Jesus Christ so that's why after Jesus went up in a cloud and and and we know the word says the way same way you see him go up that's the same way he'll come we won't go too far to that today but we have disciples that knew Jesus they recognized his voice they knew him he was not their Master he was their friend he even declared it that way I no longer call you servant I Call You Friend they understood that and here we have something very similar going on these these these men I'm going to say men we call them kids the the Hebrew kids the Hebrew children these Hebrew men they knew exactly who Daniel was Daniel was their brother maybe Daniel was their Pastor because he was a prophet in his day maybe he was their pastor but they did not Elevate they weren't interested in elevating him to be above their God they weren't going to fall on their knees and worship their friend who would do that people that don't know the word of God would potentially and you know brothers and sisters we got into this last week and Lord willing we'll carry it on a little bit more and I don't mean it to be bad but sometimes I think it can be we can start to erect images in our own minds the devil is so Sly and so slick we read about this just now the the last quote we read how how he's going to come in and try to deceive the very elect if it were possible how's he going to do that sometimes I just want to say this we can we can get a an image in our mind of the way things should be we can erect our own image and is that actually the way God wants it to be I don't think it is God wants one image to be worshiped and only one and that is the Lord Jesus Christ any other image is actually going to lead to destruction brothers and sisters it's just going to be a destraction from the word and that's all it's going to take is a distraction from the word hey just look over here hey just just one little thing over here and as long as we're doing that as long as we're following that we're not keeping our eyes focused on Christ out of the exposition of the seven Church ages a resume of the ages brother Bram he says we learn in no uncertain terms that this false Vine is the vine of Satan their Gathering is of him Satan they meet in the name of God and lie that they are christs they preach they teach they baptize they worship they partake of various rights given by Christ to the church yet are not of God what this is really strong why would they not be of God simply because they wouldn't follow his word it's real simple and and it might sound condescending I don't mean it to sound condescending I mean to make it sound like it's simple brothers and sisters we either follow all of the word of God or we don't to follow most of the word of God is not following the word of God and that's what's required in this age my we get into the seventh age and all the Mysteries and all the seals being open and preach heavy mysterious doctor and brother but we can't do the simple things brothers and sisters it's time to get back to the word we've got to know the ABCs before we're ever going to see algebra it's the the age we live in this is no time to play church it's no time to say that I associate with the message of the hour and that's going to help me it's not going to help you get into Christ better yet get Christ into you the only way that's going to happen is to throw away the traditions and to take all of the images that we've got in our mind about what we think the message of the hour is and smashed them brothers and sisters we've got to be willing to Humble ourselves before God to say hey be it unto me according to Thy word Lord if we say no I've heard it all I've heard the message I've been raised in the message I my parents my grandparents this that the other you know what it's not going to work because God has no grandchildren he only has Sons and Daughters the ones that truly follow his word brother bam he says but since they are I'll go back to the beginning again I'll stop we'll just read this whole quote so I don't wreck it we learn in no uncertain terms that this false Vine is the vine of Satan the Gathering is of him Satan they meet in the name of God and lie that they are Christ they preach they teach they baptize they worship they partake of various rights given by Christ to the church yet they are not of God so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible but since they say they are God will hold them responsible we don't have to hold them responsible it's not up to us to do that brothers and sisters it's up to us to pray for one another to encourage one another but since they say they are God will hold them responsible and in each age he speaks of them and to them they remind us exact of balum he had the prophetic office he knew the proper approach unto God as demonstrated in the sacrifice of the clean beasts yet he was not a true word Prophet for when God told him not to go honor baac with his presence he sought to go anyway for he was motivated by his Lust For Gold and prestige so God let him go the perfect will of God gave way to the permissive will of God because the heart desire because of the heart desire of balum that's why we we we need to I I believe I want to encourage us brothers and sisters when we when we sing the songs of of David the man who is after a man after God's Own Heart and he we sing that song that it's this psalm create in me a Clean Heart Lord and renew a right Spirit within me it's not our own Spirit don't give me my spirit give me your spirit that's the only clean Spirit there is but we know that God said actually said go ahead did God change his mind no sir God had his way regardless of balum going balum did not anull the will of God and we can neither anull the of God brothers and sisters because his will is his word and his word will always come to pass heavens and earth will pass away but his word is the only thing that will remain God had his way regardless it was balum who was the loser for he bypassed the word remember brothers and sisters it's not just going to be action against the word of God in our age that's going to cause destruction it's going to be inaction towards the word of God when we've heard it and then we just choose to do our own thing that's the same thing and today we have the very same thing women preachers organization false Doctrine Etc and people worshiping God manifesting in the spirit and going right on as did balum claiming that God has spoken to them even when the commission received is opposite to the revealed word Lord have mercy yes yes and we have the prophets say can you read that and I will not deny that God spoke to them wow right y but it was just like when he spoke to balum that second time as he knew that balam wanted his own heart desire above the world word I say Lord don't let us put our heart desires above this word me too I say Lord don't let me put my heart desire above your word there's nothing in this world that's worth putting above his word brothers and sisters if we put anything between us and his word it's idolatry brother bam says it was just like when he spoke to balam that second time he knew that balam wanted his own heart desire above the word and he gave it to him yet all the while in the end having his own way even so today God tells folks to go ahead in their own heart's desires for they have already rejected the word but the will of God will be done regardless amen isn't that tremendous brothers and sisters and what is the will of God his word what's the true identification that we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're willing to line ourselves up with the word we're willing to say be it unto me oh Lord according to thy will which is Thy word even if it takes the hide off me even if I know that I've done wrong I've got to go and fix and I need to make these things right but the one that will never do that is the one that's already rejected the word they've already rejected the word because guilty of the least is guilty of the whole but the will of God will be done regardless he says amen I hope you see this it will not only clear up much of what is seen in all ages but it will especially help in this last age which has so much manifestation and external blessings when the whole period is so against the word revealed will of God I just love that the word revealed will of God my goodness going back to our story today we know that Nebuchadnezzar he was good to His prophets we talked about that in in Jeremiah 39 and 40 and I just think it's interesting don't you how how how sometimes unbelievers because we know Nebuchadnezzar wasn't a Believer he was an unbeliever he was an idolator he he was a king that never knew the god of heaven and we know that God dealt with him he let his his life pass over him seven times we can get into that story later on but for time's sake we know that he came to know God in a different way and he came to the place where he declared there is one living God God knows exactly how to deal with us but isn't it interesting how unbelievers can sometimes be nicer to the people of God than those so-called Believers how does that work I I think it's amazing we know that Matthew 10:41 I'll read it for time sake he says he that receiveth prophet in the name of the Prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward brothers and sisters that's how we're going to see people come to the white Throne judgment and actually get eternal life because they were good to the bride that's right that's what the prophet taught yes but here we have in our story let's go back to it we left off in verse 12 verse 13 that nebuch Nezar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and Abednego then they brought these men before the king and you can only imagine when when they when they totally objected to the king they didn't listen to the king they stood out everyone else bowed down but these ones stood out isn't that the life of a Believer it's pretty easy for the brothers to blend in you know Lord have mercy on the sisters who stand out just like those Hebrew kids because they can't hide their garments they can't hide their hair they're the ones making a stand whether they want to or not Brothers we've got to pray for the sisters who take a stand and stand out just like these Hebrew kids did but we know Nebuchadnezzar verse 13 in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and Abednego then they brought these men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true oh Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and you can imagine here we have the king thinking I allowed you to follow this guy who I know has Supernatural God he told you along he brought you along all three of you and now you defy me openly my he must have been in a real fit Shadrach Meshach and abedo do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up now if ye be ready that at the what ye what time ye hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbut salry and duler and all kinds of music ye Fall Down and Worship ship the image which I have made well but if you worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands right isn't it interesting that he would ask that question after he set everything in motion created all of this this problem and and this image and and all of this worship and everybody is involved with it but yet he would still have something in him that would say who is this God that can deliver you and I I can't help but think they they actually knew the word of God those boys in job 13:1 15 though he slay me yet will I trust in him but I will maintain my own ways before him job understood the word of God in his life we know that even his wife came against him and said why why don't you just Curse God die look at you look at you you're miserable and job said you know what thou speakest like a foolish woman he didn't say you are a foolish woman he said thou speakest as a foolish woman that I would do that though he slay me yet I will serve him acts 4:18 and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus but Peter and John answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than to our God judgey but for we cannot speak the things which we have seen and heard they know they knew they understood exactly who their God was and they were willing to make a stand for it here we have King Nebuchadnezzar saying who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hand and you know these boys because they understood God they understood where they were and who they were and where they stood Shadrach Meshach and abedo verse 16 answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter that alone brothers and sisters was enough to put them in the burning fiery furnace I hope we understand that that that you did not come against King Nebuchadnezzar in the Babylonian province in in that Kingdom and stand up and defy openly the king to do that was death immediately remember even the the captain's guard who is feeding them they said no no no we can't eat this food that's tainted it's been sacrificed onto idols and that wine it's all unclean we can't eat that just give us pulse remember the captain of the the King's Guard said no I fear for my head you've got to actually allow me to to minister unto you but they said no just don't worry don't worry God has allowed us to find favor in your sight we went over all of that but but here we have the same children now saying hey doesn't matter who we talk to on side of Eternity we know there is one God and that's the only image that we're going to bow down to why is that because they received the word of the prophet in their day that's the only reason they could do it brothers and sisters many people might say oh brother Barry there's people there's many different ways you know what this whole world teaches that you can just get a GPS calculator and you can find your way around and they will even say there's many different ways to get to heaven there's only one way one truth truth and one life that's it that's Jesus Christ there's no way around it the only way we get to Jesus Christ is through the word of a Vindicated Prophet there's many people that will claim that they get there but they won't they don't you can't Shadrach Meshach and abedo verse 16 answered and said to the King Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thy hand oh King can you imagine a prophetic class of people amen they couldn't see how it was going to happen they didn't understand how it was going to happen my goodness I just think this is so beautiful boy I get talking and I just completely get off I do apologize off track Verse 18 but if not be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the gold an image which thou Hast set up so all of those verses those three verses 161 17 and 18 put this man who was already in a rage into like a a nuclear fusion or fision whichever you call it this guy was going crosseyed with anger right and isn't it interesting verse 19 said then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury and the form of his Visage was changed against Shadrach mesach and abedo you can only imagine he had veins popping out on his forehead his whole face was red he didn't even know what to do himself so what did he say oh we're going to take and we're going to make that furnace seven times hter than it's ever been i' got to do everything I can against these boys that are going to defy me openly like that then Nebuchadnezzar was full of Fury and the form of his vision was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat that furnace one seven times more than it was want to be heated and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and cast them into a burning fiery furnace then these men were Bound in their coats their hosen their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace can you imagine that brothers and sisters I think it's beautiful how they were able to say you know what it doesn't matter we're not careful to answer you that is Holy Spirit courage right there amen amen it's not rebellious Spirit that's people knowing exactly who they are and exactly where they stand because that word the only word his will they have hidden in their heart they knew exactly all about it just like brother bradam says about the message of the hour when you get the Holy Ghost in your life there's no questions about it you know exactly all about it but you know I can't help but imagine they they knew some scripture in their lives and uh you know for time's sake I'm probably not going to read a lot of this here but I think it's important for us to know they were able to say our God whom we serve is able and he's able to deliver us not only from your hand but to Deliver Us from this Burning fiery furnace amen sometimes in our lives I believe we need to be able to speak by faith brothers and sisters and you know what we've heard it said before that the prophet is just he he said that God is just waiting for us to speak the word and that's just for heaven to back up that word he he's waiting for us to actually just speak the word that is the third pole Ministry we know that's the opening of the word but how are we ever going to do that if we don't follow the word amen many times people will actually want the word in their hour of need but the rest of the time in their lives you know it kind of gets in the way it cramps the style they have to go and hear the the preacher preach and hear all of his teaching and you know there's there's men that are fallible and every man is fallible I'm fallible I'll tell you that don't look to me Look Away to Jesus he is the one with your salvation but we know these Hebrew kids they are able to say that he's able to Deliver Us from this Burning fiery furnace and I want to say today brothers and sisters where do we find ourselves when we are in the midst of it what is he able to Deliver Us from I'm sure that we could come up with a laundry list he's able to Deliver Us from a mental anguish he is able to Deliver Us From Fear he is able to Deliver Us from colds he's able to Deliver Us from cancer he's able to Deliver us from death there's nothing that he's not able to Deliver Us from and you know what it doesn't matter who we come up against who might come up against us rather in this world nobody can pluck us from his hand but in Daniel 18 3:18 but if not it doesn't matter it doesn't mean that God won't hear our prayer if God won't deliver them from the fire they're not worried it's not because God won't hear their prayer it's not because God will abandon us it's simply because it must be God's perfect will nobody passes on without it being God's perfect will nobody the only reason people go from this world to the next is because God said it's time it's time for that person to come home amen and these Hebrew kids were willing to stake it all on the line how many times in our lives are we willing to do that brothers and sisters it it it's not an easy thing but you know we're coming to the place where it's so Sly and so subtle we don't need to worry about having a tremendous problem in our flesh worry about the tremendous problem Waring for our souls that's what we need to be worried about but you know what these kids they knew these men they knew that God didn't abandon them I just can't help but think they understood the prophet Isaiah in Isaiah 43:1 but now thus saith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou wst through the fire thou shallal not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee these were Believers of the word for their day and they were not willing to compromise not for any King not for any image not for any Kingdom brothers and sisters we've got to be very careful about the images that we're willing to erect in our lives the Devil comes in so subtly it'll start out with just one thing and then it will grow into another and then it will grow into another we cannot have an image that will be acceptable in the sight of God sometimes we can have a church image tear it down Smash It To The Ground the only image is Christ sometimes we can have a family image that's a tradition it's a traditional teaching Smash It To The Ground sometimes we can have a cultural image there's no culture in the Holy Ghost that is false lie of the devil when people say well it's my culture that's a lie of the devil right these Hebrew kids they knew they knew the prophecy of Isaiah they knew where they stood when thou wst through the fire Thou shalt not be burned amen that's why they said we're not careful to answer the this matter don't have to you know what if if if not be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve thee we will not worship thy Gods nor worship the golden image which th set up and we know this guy drove him into a frenzy and we heard that they were thrown into the fiery furnace verse 22 actually 21 then these men were Bound in their coats their hosen their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace was exceeding ly hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach Meshach and Abednego isn't it interesting how God will always have a witness something had to demonstrate that this was actually hot something had to demonstrate the king's Fury something had to demonstrate the delivering power of God spoken by the prophet Isaiah when thou walkest through the fire thou shal not be burned amen therefore because the king's commandment was urgent the furnace was exceedingly hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach mesach and Abednego and these three men Shadrach Meshach and abano fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace brothers and sisters I want to say today many times we can find ourselves bound and and falling down in the midst of a burning fiery furnace but it's right there it's right then that is when God is on the scene brothers and sisters don't think for a second that he has abandon you or abandon your prayers he has heard every single prayer and he knows exactly what your situation is and here we have verse 24 then Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonied and Rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors now all these accusers huh did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true oh King and what did he do he answered God allowing this King to witness it he answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God isn't that amazing brothers and sisters if you want to see his will just apply his word if you want to see his will just apply his word my goodness oh it's good oh I'm just going to read one quote and then I'm going to close I'll call the musicians it's a long quote so you can stay sitting just for now 1953 0608 at Thy word it's a story that I read a long time ago and I just think it's so powerful brothers and sisters we need to remember that his ears are always open to our prayers and he's just waiting to see that we're willing to take him at his word he is not a vending machine we can't just go and live our lives willy-nilly and then suddenly have a problem and we got to come and put our coins in the machine and say oh God come and heal me oh God come and save me just apply the word in your life and then speak the word and see if God won't come on the scene brother bradam he said I was studying this out and brother bradam said you know those boys they had a prayer meeting that night those boys were saying while they were walking up the plank Shadrach Shadrach oh sorry brother I I'll take that Shadrach are you sure you prayed up last night you didn't fall asleep did you they knew they needed to make sure where they stood there's no room for error in this situation at Thy word brother browny says that's what it is take God at his word whatever God says God's able to perform God down through the edges I can see the Hebrew children that night when they came down to the fiery furnace they were down in Babylon what a condition what a Time way down in Babylon them boys had determined that they wasn't going to be defeated I can't imagine that we would never feel that way but brothers and sisters I can say it for sure there's times in my life where I have felt defeated have you ever felt defeated don't feel defeated when that feeling comes around that's the devil trying to come in like a flood but let that spirit of God raise up that standard inside of you to say there's nothing that can harm me they were going to take God's word for it we need some more of them tonight I want to say we need some more of them today Shadrach mesach and abedo what called the son of man on the scene brothers and sisters it wasn't King Nebuchadnezzar it wasn't even Daniel it was those Hebrew kids those ones that hid his word in their heart King made a prop Proclamation declaration and he said ever who won't bow to the image will excuse me don't give the devil any fear he says I like that determination the king said I will burn some of that Holy Roller religion out of them then and isn't that what the devil says to us today we'll be in a church service and God will say stand up and receive your healing and we'll be like oh my I don't know I think I'm going crazy because I I feel like I just want to stand up and shout in the middle of a service but everyone else is going to look around and say oh he's a holly roller brothers and sisters don't let nothing stop the spirit of God rising up inside of you because when he sees his word get a response then he's going to give you what you're looking for but as long as we sit in a church service and say oh my yeah I've heard that quote before yeah I've been around the message many many years d d God's just going to say you know what whatever have a nice day that's what he's going to say but when we're willing to actually say Lord I surrender all I'm willing to take all those images that have been raised up in my mind and just say be it unto me according to your your word then he's going to say hey now we're getting somewhere I'm seeing a response to my word when I see a response to my word that I'm going to pour out my blessings on you the king said I will burn some of that Holy Roller religion out of them don't let anybody worry you about Holy Roller religion in this building if there's ever a place that you can let off the pressure brothers and sisters it's right here if we can go to a hockey game or a football game or a baseball game and get excited what can we do about the word of God in our lives where can we go to get excited this isn't a pep talk I'm not trying to encourage you to just get excited I'm trying to encourage you to respond to God's [Applause] [Music] word the devil will never be able to burn that Holy Roller religion out of you brother bradam he talks about John on the aisle of patmas before they sent him there they tried to boil that Holy Roller religion out of him you're not going to boil the Holy Spirit out of nobody so they got the Old Furnace hot seven times hotter than it ever was was I seen them tie their hands behind them can you imagine a Vindicated prophet in our day talking about a vision that God has given him about this circumstance this isn't just storytelling brothers and sisters H he's seen them tie their hands behind them they had a prayer meeting all that night the next day the death march come along plank walk up there a road wherever it was Stone Road to the furnace and they dropped off the furnace I can see the great strong men the king set up and say now we'll see how good this religion is marome right now we'll see how good this religion is isn't that how it is today with people when people get in a circumstance now we'll see how good this religion is you just come down off that cross and then we'll believe that you're God it's the same Spirit now we'll see how good that religion is how much whether he will not take his word or not but they had an issue from God not to bow to images take God at his word I can see them start the Death March the old Skies roaring red with fire said you want to take it back you can take it back all you got to do is renounce what you believe and you can save your life they said no sir Our God he is able to Deliver Us from this we will not bow down to your image so up the road they went and as they got closer don't you worry you take God at his word and the devil will turn up the heat on you don't you think he won't brothers and sisters if you're getting heat today praise the Lord stand up and praise the Lord if the sky is red and there's sparks flying in your life stand up and praise the Lord I guarantee you today the furnace is heated seven times hotter against all those people who will not bow down to any other image than the image of the Lord Jesus Christ my oh up the road they went as they got farther hot hot and hotter hotter it began to get I can hear Shadrach say to meach are you sure you prayed through yeah everything is right let's go then on right up begin to stagger from the intense heat coming off there getting close one more step and they're going into there looks like a black picture for a Believer doesn't it truly does he says let's turn our camera can you imagine the prophet just saying let's just turn our perspective let's just turn our camera my let's just turn our camera all the time there's something going on down here there's something going on up there too brothers and sisters don't doubt it for a second even though we're going through the fire God has not abandoned us he'll never leave us nor forsake us all the time there's something going on down here there's something going on up there let's look up there and see what's going on maybe stand with me as we close I can see him sitting in his great Priestly robes hanging around him watching down there across I can see the great Archangel Gabriel come up pull his sword un sheath his sword and stand and say master have you looked down in Babylon my have you seen what's going on why there's men down there these people that took your word and they're standing on it and they're fixing to burn up this morning I can hear them say yes yes Gabriel I'm watching them I hear him say look I stood by your side let me go down there I'll change this scene this morning I believe he could have done it I hear him say Gabriel you've been a good Angel you've done just what I've told you ever since I created you stick that sword back in there stuck it back there Gabriel took his place at his side here comes another Angel flashing up real quick his name is wormwood he had the controls over the water I can hear him say master look down in Babylon have you considered Babylon why he said let me go down there in the anti- deliv and destruction you get G me power over the waters I broke up the Springs brought the atmospheres down I washed the whole earth over oh just let me go down there this morning I'll wash Babylon off the face of the earth I believe he could have done it that's right said have you considered them here we have God speaking through a Vindicated Prophet when he said let's just turn the camera let's remember that when we're going through something down here there's something going on up there he said yes I've watched them all night amen His Eye Is on the Sparrow you know he watches me sing because I'm happy he watches every hour he knows everything you're doing that's right he said I've watched them all night long and you angels are great men and you've done what I've told you to do but I can't let you go this morning because I go myself it's a man-sized job amen he said look they just got one more step they're going right in brothers and sisters sometimes God set still and lets us go to the last minute you're the only ones in a hurry not God he knows what he's got to do going to do you just believe him he's a he's on the answering side amen I can see him come walking down I can see him get up off his throne his Priestly garments drop around him like that the great king of majesty like everything obeys him I can see a great big Thunderhead hanging back there in the north I can hear him say East Wind South Wind North Wind and West Wind come here everything Minds him all but man man knows more about it than he does or thinks he does I can hear him say get over on that Thunderhead and bring it right here quick quick I got a mission for you the winds and the waves obey him everything else obeys him I can see that great big Thunderhead roll over there steps on it like a chariot my reaches up and got a hold of a zigzag lightning crashed it to the skies to let them know he's on the hearing side Hallelujah I'm watching you I know where you are crackling that lightning as he went through I hear shadra Say it'll be all right don't worry thinking he's just about to cross over into Glory and right then I could see him pass down by the sea of Life pick up a palm out of the Sea of life and about that time Shadrach Meshach and Abednego stepped into the fiery furnace there was one standing by their side Fanning away the fire hour after hour of pleasure in there hour after hour of pleasure in the fire brothers and sisters he's not going to let us go he's not going to let us go into a situation where we'll be destroyed no way it's so that we can draw closer to him hour after hour of pleasure in there King said open up the doors and see if they're there he said I thought you put in three I see four and one looks like the Son of God why why somebody took God at his word remember brothers and sisters his will is his word just put his word first and see if he won't come on the scene God bless you today let's pray
