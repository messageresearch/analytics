[35:37] to see you back he was in Lethbridge
[35:40] took the service down there today uh if
[35:42] you have your Bibles I'd like to read
[35:43] from 1 Corinthians chapter
[35:46] 10 start at verse
[35:55] 14
[35:58] Lord willing I won't really preach
[36:01] tonight just have a few
[36:04] words 1 Corinthians chapter
[36:08] 10 verse
[36:17] 14 says wherefore my dearly
[36:20] beloved flee from
[36:24] idolatry I speak as to wise men judge ye
[36:28] what I
[36:29] say the cup of blessing which we bless
[36:33] is it not the communion of the blood of
[36:36] Christ the bread which we break is it
[36:40] not the communion of the body of
[36:42] Christ for we being many are one bread
[36:46] and one body for we are all partakers of
[36:50] that one bread amen behold Israel after
[36:53] the
[36:55] flesh are not the they which eat of the
[36:58] sacrifices partakers of the
[37:01] altar what say I
[37:04] then that that the idol is anything or
[37:09] that which is offered in sacrifice to
[37:11] Idols is
[37:13] anything but I say that the things which
[37:17] the Gentiles
[37:18] sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and
[37:21] not to God and I would not that ye
[37:25] should have Fellowship with
[37:27] Devils you cannot drink the cup of the
[37:30] Lord and the cup of devils you cannot be
[37:34] partakers of the Lord's table and of the
[37:38] table of
[37:40] devils let's just bow in prayer one more
[37:43] time Heavenly Father we thank you for
[37:45] your word we thank you for your
[37:46] leadership and your
[37:48] instruction and Lord Jesus we know full
[37:51] well that we cannot partake of your
[37:54] table and the table with devil devil and
[37:57] we know that there's always a time in
[37:59] our lives where we have to choose this
[38:01] day whom we will
[38:03] serve and father tonight I pray that
[38:05] that would be our prayer that if there's
[38:07] anything in our lives Lord Jesus that we
[38:09] have esteemed greater in any way than
[38:12] your word then father forgive us for it
[38:15] and allow us to go forwards in true
[38:17] communion with you Lord Jesus we just
[38:20] commit all the rest of this service now
[38:22] into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus
[38:24] Christ's name we pray amen bless you
[38:26] tonight you may be
[38:28] seated I just uh think this kind of
[38:32] dovet tales with what we were talking
[38:33] about this morning and we only sort of
[38:36] brushed on it but idolatry is a it's a
[38:40] very big thing and it's a very subtle
[38:42] thing and really basically in a nutshell
[38:44] anything we put before the word of God
[38:46] is idolatry and that can be actions it
[38:50] can be thinking it can be tradition it
[38:54] can be Behavior it can be things that
[38:56] that we do it can be things that we
[38:57] don't do anything that we put ahead of
[39:01] the word of God in our lives is
[39:04] idolatry so I think it's just important
[39:07] for us to remember that you know we
[39:09] can't drink the cup of the Lord and the
[39:12] cup of devils we can't come to this
[39:14] table for communion and actually follow
[39:17] the ordinance of the Lord and then run
[39:19] out into the world tomorrow and just be
[39:21] worldly people and just do what we
[39:23] normally worldly would do and think that
[39:25] we're going to see a blessing what Happ
[39:26] actually will happen is we'll see a
[39:27] curse that's what will come upon us we
[39:30] have to know where we stand when we come
[39:31] to this table and we also need to know
[39:34] that when we come to this table we're
[39:36] not coming to this table to meet with
[39:38] men you're not coming to meet the
[39:39] deacons we're not coming to meet brother
[39:42] Barry we're coming to actually meet with
[39:44] MDC himself which is Christ Jesus for
[39:48] our day you know out of the service
[39:51] communion in
[39:52] 1962 I've got a pretty long quote that I
[39:55] thought I would just read tonight and
[39:57] and just see what the Lord would do with
[39:58] it and paragraph 111 brother brandham
[40:02] says what do you
[40:03] do you're building up your body to
[40:07] inoculation from the somebody comes in
[40:10] and says oh our church don't believe in
[40:14] shouting see you're built up what you
[40:18] got communion in you the word and you're
[40:22] inoculated from it if a bunch of
[40:25] nonsense comes in what is it it has no
[40:29] word in it then you're sure it's wrong
[40:33] he says I don't care how real it looks
[40:36] if it's not the word leave it alone amen
[40:41] I don't care what it does it must
[40:44] compare with the
[40:46] word he goes on to say in prayer I was
[40:50] quoting Micaiah standing there we know
[40:54] the story of Micaiah it's from First
[40:57] Kings and
[40:59] how um Jehoshaphat was called up by Ahab
[41:03] you know Ahab the king he married
[41:06] Jezebel Ahab was actually born into a a
[41:10] Christian home and we know he was a
[41:13] backslider that's what the prophet said
[41:14] he was a backslider and he realized that
[41:17] the land that the enemy was on was their
[41:20] land uh I believe it was the syrians and
[41:23] so he went up to Jehoshaphat and said
[41:25] hey buddy these guys are on our land why
[41:27] don't we go take it back we know that's
[41:29] our land they don't have any right to it
[41:32] and we know that josephat said you know
[41:33] you're the king so let's let's go and do
[41:36] what you want to do if you think it's
[41:38] okay let's do it and and Ahab said great
[41:41] and he had 400 prophets Ahab brought out
[41:44] 400 prophets and said he said to them
[41:47] brother Bram says these were God
[41:48] prophets too by the way he he said to
[41:50] them should we go up should we go and
[41:53] try and take back ramoth Gilead should
[41:55] we do do that and those 400 prophets
[41:58] those God prophets they said yes indeed
[42:01] go ahead and we know that it's
[42:04] interesting because even though there
[42:06] was 400 of them ahab's prophets josephat
[42:09] he said you know what isn't there one
[42:11] more isn't isn't there anyone
[42:14] else and we know that Ahab said yeah
[42:16] there is there's one more but I hate him
[42:19] because he never prophesies good and the
[42:22] reason he could never prophesy good is
[42:23] because we know that Ahab was completely
[42:26] totally immersed saturated in idolatry
[42:29] through his
[42:30] marriage he had a wife that was
[42:32] completely driving everything and so
[42:35] through that idolatry he didn't like the
[42:38] prophecy that came forward from that one
[42:40] God Prophet but josephat said you know
[42:42] isn't there one more in the land and he
[42:44] said sure I hate him but we'll get him
[42:46] we'll bring him up and we know that they
[42:47] went down they told him his messenger
[42:49] said you come up and you talk and you
[42:50] say what all the other ones are saying
[42:52] and brother bradam says we'll give you
[42:53] your fellowship card back we'll welcome
[42:55] you back into the group group you can be
[42:57] accepted again if you're just willing to
[43:00] buy into our idolatry and we know that
[43:03] he said you know what as the Lord liveth
[43:04] I ain't going to say nothing but what
[43:05] the Lord puts in my mouth it's only
[43:07] going to be the word it's only going to
[43:09] be the truth that's the only thing
[43:10] that's going to come out of my mouth I'm
[43:12] not going to say anything to try and fit
[43:13] in to try and appease anybody but we
[43:17] know um it didn't go well in the end it
[43:21] didn't go well for Ahab because this one
[43:23] God Prophet told him you know what if
[43:25] you come back at all then I'm not
[43:28] actually a prophet of God but brother
[43:30] Bram in this in this quote he says in
[43:32] prayer as I was quoting Micaiah standing
[43:35] there look it looked really right while
[43:38] there was Israel and that piece of land
[43:41] belonged to them those aliens had come
[43:44] in and took it away from them and had
[43:47] built their own houses and they was
[43:49] occupying part of the land that God give
[43:52] them I'm just going to pause there
[43:54] brothers and sisters sometimes death
[43:56] Devils will come in and think that they
[43:58] can actually build houses and inhabit
[44:00] our Promised Land come into our lives
[44:03] come into our families come into our
[44:05] marriages come into our relationships
[44:08] even come into our
[44:09] church and just set up shop they'll
[44:12] build their house they'll establish
[44:14] their place and their squatters on the
[44:16] land they have zero rights to the land
[44:19] and you know we don't have to tolerate
[44:21] it we can actually get rid of the Devils
[44:23] now I'm not saying get rid of the people
[44:25] I'm saying we can get of the devils in
[44:26] the name of Jesus Christ amen when a
[44:28] devil comes into our marriage and tries
[44:31] to stir us up we don't have to tolerate
[44:33] that we don't have to say well that's
[44:34] just their temper and they they just
[44:36] behave this way and you know their dad
[44:37] was that way and their grandpa was that
[44:39] way and their great grandpa was that we
[44:41] don't have to do that we can go on our
[44:43] knees and say I've got a prayer request
[44:45] for my husband I got a prayer request
[44:46] for my wife because there's something
[44:49] wrong it's a devil trying to stir them
[44:51] up we don't have to accept it and
[44:54] whatever the problem is whatever the
[44:56] situation is but talking about this
[44:58] Promised Land brother Bram says those
[45:00] aliens had come in and took it away from
[45:02] them and had built their own houses they
[45:04] was occupying part of the land that God
[45:06] give them they were getting real
[45:08] comfortable weren't they so it looked
[45:10] like those 400 Hebrew prophets was right
[45:13] but you know there was something about
[45:15] Jehoshaphat was spiritual he said
[45:18] haven't you got another one said I got
[45:20] another one but I said I I hate him the
[45:22] only thing he does is prophesy evil
[45:25] isn't it interesting the evil one is
[45:28] saying he only prophesies evil when
[45:31] really he was only prophesying truth he
[45:34] was saying the word of God but the evil
[45:35] one couldn't stand it so to him it was
[45:39] evil said go get him and let's hear him
[45:43] and he went up he said go on go up but I
[45:46] seen Israel scattered like sheep having
[45:48] no Shepherd and he told his
[45:51] vision now who is
[45:53] right it looked like the 400 was right
[45:57] 400 well-trained
[45:59] men you only imagine they were well-
[46:01] trained seasoned message Believers in
[46:03] their
[46:05] day they were part of the organization
[46:08] maybe even founding members they were
[46:11] right right 400 well-trained men saying
[46:15] go up the Lord is with you and even
[46:18] zedekiah zedekiah had a two two big Iron
[46:21] horns built he said by this you'll push
[46:24] the aliens out of the land
[46:31] he was sure he was
[46:32] right he know he was right but you see
[46:36] he was
[46:37] wrong he was under the influence of one
[46:39] of those squatters wasn't he he was
[46:42] under the influence of one of those
[46:43] spirits and he didn't even know it he
[46:44] made a perfect place for him to live and
[46:47] in habit habitation for him I just was
[46:50] thinking as I was reading this it just
[46:52] dovet tales with our our scripture this
[46:54] morning it's not by strength or by mind
[46:55] might brothers and sisters but by my
[46:58] spirit sayeth the Lord am he knowed he
[47:00] was right but you see he was wrong and
[47:03] here Micaiah one against
[47:07] 400 and he said if you go up Israel will
[47:10] be scattered with no Shepherd and the
[47:12] other said go up the Lord is with you
[47:14] now materially they was right the place
[47:17] did belong to Israel but the word of the
[47:21] Lord had condemned Ahab so how could God
[47:25] bless what he had
[47:28] condemned of course you didn't want to
[47:30] hear that prophecy about being condemned
[47:32] who would want to hear a prophecy about
[47:34] being
[47:35] condemned brother bam says there it is
[47:37] today
[47:38] see the word of communion was in
[47:43] Micaiah now if you're communing with God
[47:46] in taking the real
[47:48] communion and the spirit in you
[47:51] disagrees with this word you're not
[47:54] comping with God you're communing with
[47:58] devils and brothers and sisters I want
[48:00] to say one
[48:02] word if we dispute or disagree with one
[48:05] word of this message here's what the
[48:08] prophet says you're not communing with
[48:11] God you're communing with
[48:13] devils and they're so
[48:16] impersonating we know that the Devils
[48:18] love to go to church they love to get
[48:21] polished up they love to call themselves
[48:23] Christian and you know we had 400 God
[48:26] prophets here but one of them had the
[48:29] word of the
[48:31] Lord and they're so impersonating
[48:34] brother Bram says the Bible said in the
[48:35] last days they'd almost deceive the very
[48:38] elected if it were possible but isn't it
[48:41] wonderful praise be to God it's not
[48:43] possible there's only one way that it's
[48:45] not possible brothers and sisters that's
[48:46] to have the Holy Ghost in your life it
[48:48] always goes back to that it always will
[48:50] go back to that right up to the day we
[48:52] walk over and translate our bodies when
[48:54] we're translated into the next next
[48:55] Dimension because that's the only
[48:57] promise for us in Noah's day he had one
[48:59] message get in the boat today we've got
[49:01] one message get the Holy Ghost that
[49:03] truly is it brother Bram goes on to say
[49:06] but heavens and earth will pass away but
[49:08] my word shall not and if uh Paul said in
[49:11] Galatians 1 18 if an angel from heaven
[49:13] preaches any other gospel than this that
[49:15] you've already heard let him be ACC
[49:18] cursed even an
[49:22] angel even an
[49:24] angel
[49:26] in the early church when those men like
[49:28] St Martin irius those Godly men when the
[49:32] devil would appear like an angel of
[49:35] Light but you watch he'll be a little
[49:37] off the
[49:39] word you ever meet somebody who is a
[49:42] Believer and there just
[49:44] something just something can't put your
[49:47] finger on it just
[49:49] something it might not be that they have
[49:52] a
[49:53] devil they might just be a different
[49:55] individual
[49:56] idual but it might be they have a devil
[49:59] but you know brothers and sisters it's
[50:00] not up to us to determine whether
[50:01] someone's got a devil and then try and
[50:03] bring them before the church and
[50:05] excommunicate them that's not our
[50:06] mission our mission is to get people to
[50:08] Christ that's our
[50:11] mission but I think it's important to
[50:13] just see what the prophet says here it's
[50:15] very very difficult to tell they're
[50:18] impersonating there's only one way to
[50:20] tell the difference they're off the word
[50:21] how do you tell someone that has the
[50:23] Holy Ghost they're on the word amen
[50:26] that's the difference one is off the
[50:29] word one is on the
[50:32] word he appeared to Eve as an angel of
[50:34] Light told her sure the Lord said this
[50:38] but the Lord said this but he disagreed
[50:41] with God right at the end and that's the
[50:44] way false communion does today when
[50:47] people think they're praying to God and
[50:50] won't obey the word it's a false
[50:54] communion brother and sisters we need to
[50:56] make sure we know where we stand before
[50:57] we come to this table are we following
[51:00] the entire word of God all of the word
[51:02] of God in our lives and you know if
[51:04] you're not sure sometimes it can be a
[51:07] little bit confusing and I don't mean to
[51:08] make it a problem I just want to see
[51:11] that we're all on the right trajectory
[51:12] that's really my job is to see that
[51:15] we're going the right way and if anybody
[51:18] is wrong let's just get right let's just
[51:20] get in line let's shake ourselves this
[51:22] is the time to cross over it's not time
[51:25] to play church
[51:27] amen when people think they're praying
[51:29] to God and won't obey the word it's a
[51:32] false
[51:34] communion and I believe that's
[51:36] idolatry and that's terrible brothers
[51:39] and sisters but we know the word of God
[51:40] says if you abide in me and my word in
[51:42] you then ask what you will see and it'll
[51:44] be
[51:45] done you want to know whether you're
[51:47] actually in line with the word of God
[51:49] just ask the Lord say Lord search me and
[51:52] try me take me and break me and bless
[51:56] the broken pieces of my life that I
[51:59] might be able to be used by you but you
[52:01] know brothers and sisters he can't take
[52:02] and and bless our lives he can't
[52:04] actually see that growth unless he
[52:06] breaks the pieces first according to
[52:08] that song that we just sung you know the
[52:10] fruit doesn't grow on the top of the
[52:11] mountain it grows in The Valleys we've
[52:13] got to be willing to just let the Lord
[52:15] lead us and guide us let him take us to
[52:17] the depths of the valley if we truly
[52:19] believe that he's in charge and he's in
[52:21] control we don't have anything to
[52:24] fear if you abide in me and my word in
[52:26] you then ask what you will see I just
[52:29] don't think there's any better question
[52:31] that we could ask God is for a son and
[52:33] daughter of God for someone who wants to
[52:35] find God to say to him Lord am I in line
[52:39] with your
[52:40] word if I'm not then show me where I'm
[52:44] not with genuine Earnest he'll show you
[52:48] he'll show us for
[52:50] sure he abide in me and my word in you
[52:53] then ask what what you will see and
[52:56] it'll be done now it just can't go one
[52:59] time then off the next ye abide in me my
[53:02] words abide in you that's stay there
[53:05] abide means to rest there stay right
[53:08] there yes it's inoculation from sinful
[53:12] diseases and that is our Sabbath our
[53:15] place of rest isn't it brother bam says
[53:18] now let me close in saying this one word
[53:20] now before we go to the communion table
[53:23] the blood and the body of the Lord mixed
[53:26] with faith that's the blood and the body
[53:29] that's the spirit and the word mixed
[53:31] with faith equals eternal
[53:35] life he that eats my flesh and drinks my
[53:38] blood has eternal life and I will raise
[53:42] him up at the last day he says there you
[53:46] are what is it the communion of the Lord
[53:51] the word and the spirit this life is is
[53:55] in the blood the word and the spirit
[53:58] equals eternal life by faith in the
[54:03] Lord goes on to say here's my
[54:06] prayer as I see the end
[54:10] approaching see and see and see at any
[54:14] minute something could happen and know
[54:16] that we're not far off from the coming
[54:19] of the
[54:20] lord lord then in the name of the Lord
[54:23] Jesus the son of God let me take the
[54:27] word The Sword and wave it with what
[54:32] faith I have and cut my way through
[54:35] every demon power till I see Jesus by
[54:39] the communing of his
[54:42] word I just want to encourage us
[54:44] brothers and sisters because we wrestle
[54:46] not against flesh and blood but we're
[54:49] wrestling against principalities and
[54:52] powers and rulers of Darkness of this
[54:55] World spiritual wickedness in high
[54:57] places we're wrestling against Devils
[55:01] but we don't have to wrestle we have the
[55:04] ability to take this sword of the word
[55:07] and the faith of God and cut away all
[55:10] those Devils cut them out I I don't mean
[55:13] to be so blunt brothers and sisters but
[55:15] I think it's real important for us to
[55:17] just sometimes be straight let's let's
[55:20] just be honest and straight we're
[55:22] talking about dealing with Devils here
[55:24] devils want to get in our lives and mix
[55:26] things up they want us to think that
[55:28] we're behaving correctly but if we're
[55:30] one word off we heard it already one
[55:33] iota off is death that's really what it
[55:37] means brothers and sisters that's what
[55:38] happened to Eve in the Garden of Eden
[55:40] and it's going to be the same thing for
[55:41] us today we cannot think that we can mix
[55:43] any thought any idea any tradition any
[55:46] other Behavior except for the word of
[55:48] God take him at his word and we will end
[55:51] up
[55:54] right brother bradam says commune with
[55:56] his
[55:57] word if ye abide in me and my word in
[56:01] you then ask me what you will and it'll
[56:05] be done for
[56:07] you we have to abide in him but we also
[56:11] have to take his word and have it abide
[56:14] in us we know that John was instructed
[56:16] to take the little book and he it up
[56:19] it'll be sweet as honey in your mouth
[56:21] but it'll make your belly bitter this
[56:22] flesh doesn't want nothing to do with
[56:24] this word it can't happen this word this
[56:25] flesh is a hybrid flesh but we know that
[56:29] the spirit of God in us will allow us to
[56:32] rise above all of the confusion all of
[56:35] the frustration all of the upset stomach
[56:37] from this
[56:38] word commune with his word if ye abide
[56:42] in me and my word in you then ask me
[56:44] what you will and it'll be done for you
[56:47] how beautiful There's real communion
[56:50] with the word and the spirit with faith
[56:52] to wave it together ask what you will
[56:56] and it'll be done for you let us pray he
[57:00] says and you know brothers and sisters I
[57:02] just want to encourage us tonight get
[57:04] his word in you you abide in him and his
[57:07] word in you then ask what you will and
[57:09] God will do it for you he has to do it
[57:11] for you that's his word and when we
[57:14] remind him daddy that's your word you
[57:16] said you would do that now I've done
[57:18] everything in my life like we talked
[57:19] about this morning to consecrate
[57:21] ourselves go through our lives and see
[57:24] is it according to the word of God if
[57:25] it's not just get rid of it just ditch
[57:27] it just leave it alone just walk
[57:30] differently and see if God won't bless
[57:32] it I I I I I can tell you I I had a
[57:36] transformation in my life the Lord will
[57:38] bless you very quickly when you step
[57:41] towards him he will be there to receive
[57:44] you he won't just let you walk out in
[57:46] the desert Wilderness he won't leave you
[57:48] hanging out to dry what he will do is be
[57:51] there to bless you to show you yes
[57:53] indeed you're taking the right step
[57:54] you're heading the right direction and
[57:56] I'm going to show you that you're
[57:57] heading the right direction with
[57:58] something that you'll be able to
[58:00] understand you'll be able to comprehend
[58:01] it but you know the word of God it's the
[58:05] only absolute that we have it is truly
[58:07] our absolute our Anchor Point and if we
[58:09] just if we just continue to do the same
[58:11] thing over and over and over brothers
[58:13] and sisters hoping for a different
[58:15] result when we need a different result
[58:17] without making a change in our life
[58:19] that's a definition of insanity we know
[58:21] that let's just take a step maybe one
[58:24] little step you know when you shoot a
[58:25] gun Lord willing sometime we'll be able
[58:28] to show this we'll demonstrate it out
[58:29] our house when you shoot a gun if you
[58:31] just move a little bit sometimes if you
[58:33] just breathe sometimes holding the gun
[58:35] your heartbeat is just enough to move
[58:38] the gun off just a little teeny bit off
[58:40] when you shoot the gun is a long ways
[58:42] off at the Target and it's the same
[58:45] thing with us spiritually we need to
[58:47] make sure that we know exactly we're on
[58:49] target we're zeroed On Target because
[58:51] when that time comes to hit the target
[58:52] we want to hit the bullseye we don't
[58:54] don't want to be in the outside Rings we
[58:56] want to be right dead center and we will
[58:58] be brothers and sisters if we have his
[59:00] word God richly bless you tonight I know
[59:03] we're going to have some testimonies so
[59:04] I don't want to preach tonight I just
[59:06] want to try and encourage us remember
[59:09] this scripture 1 Corinthians 10 verse 21
[59:12] ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and
[59:14] the cup of devils you cannot be
[59:17] partakers of the Lord's table and of the
[59:19] table of devils it's pretty straight and
[59:23] it's pretty strong but but you know
[59:25] brothers and sisters this isn't an age
[59:27] to have uh uh a soft religion a soft
[59:31] religious experience this is the time to
[59:32] recognize who we are and what we're
[59:34] raised up for and and our our our
[59:37] ability brothers and sisters is to shine
[59:39] forth not be trampled down by Devils but
[59:41] to actually have Devils Under The Souls
[59:43] of our feet to go forwards and know that
[59:45] we will be more than conquerors so God
[59:48] richly bless you tonight I just want to
[59:50] move on to the next portion of the
[59:52] service now I'll just just call uh maybe

[59:59] the
[1:00:02] scripture read the scripture for uh
[1:00:05] communion service as we progress
[1:00:08] here and we can just flip the page it's
[1:00:11] 1
[1:00:11] Corinthians chapter
[1:00:19] 11 maybe stand with me as we read the
[1:00:23] word
[1:00:31] starting at verse
[1:00:36] 23 for I have received of the Lord that
[1:00:40] which also I delivered unto
[1:00:43] you that the same night in which he was
[1:00:46] betrayed took
[1:00:48] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:00:50] break
[1:00:51] it and said take eat
[1:00:55] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:00:59] this do in remembrance of
[1:01:02] me after the same manner also he took
[1:01:05] the cup when he had SED saying this is
[1:01:09] this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:01:11] blood this do ye as often as you drink
[1:01:14] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:01:17] you eat this bread and drink this cup ye
[1:01:19] do sh the Lord's death till he come
[1:01:23] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:01:26] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:01:29] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:01:32] and blood of the
[1:01:34] Lord but let a man examine
[1:01:37] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[1:01:39] and drink of that
[1:01:41] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:01:44] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:01:46] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:01:49] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:01:53] sickly among you and many
[1:01:55] sleep for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:01:58] should not be
[1:02:00] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:02:03] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:02:06] be condemned with the
[1:02:08] world wherefore my
[1:02:10] brethren when you come together to eat t
[1:02:15] one for another and if any man hunger
[1:02:17] let him eat at home that you come not
[1:02:19] together unto condemnation and the rest
[1:02:22] will I set in order when I
[1:02:26] come just want to read verse 27 one more
[1:02:30] time as we consider this brothers and
[1:02:31] sisters wherefore whosoever shall eat
[1:02:34] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:02:36] Lord
[1:02:37] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:02:40] and the blood of the
[1:02:42] lord we might say we never crucified
[1:02:45] Jesus but the word of God says that if
[1:02:47] we're willing to do this unworthily we
[1:02:49] have things in our lives that aren't
[1:02:51] fixed that are just loose the problem
[1:02:55] problematic we're drinking and eating
[1:02:57] unworthily and what happens is we eat
[1:02:59] and drink damnation unto ourselves and
[1:03:02] that's not a a nasty car accident
[1:03:04] necessarily the word of God says that
[1:03:06] many are weak and sickly among you and
[1:03:10] it's not weak in strength brothers and
[1:03:12] sisters it's weak in
[1:03:14] faith let's examine
