the god of Glory that created all of this wants to commune with me a little insignificant person but by his grace I was in his mind before the foundation of the world and I might have been sitting alone sitting alone and wondering but I'm Justified I am perfect I love that confession I know that in my life I know I don't confess this enough during the day but in my prayer I certainly do and I'm just looking for the Lord to help me do that more during the day when I'm beating myself up Lord that's my flesh not you I'm perfect in your sight blessed be his name this morning well I was sitting alone and wondering about what I'm supposed to do I can't deny the times I made mistakes I can't hide from him can you but I know that deep within my soul I feel sorry honest [Music] cry and say forgive me [Music] who are Justified you have not done it in the first place you're Justified oh Justified oh I've just divine I have not done it in the first place you're Justified oh so often I'm

first place you're Justified oh I'm Justified oh I'm Justified have not done it in the first place to justify Justified oh I'm Justified you have not done it in the first place you're Justified

morning once again for bringing us all together again father not because we know how to drive by Your Grace has put us all together again to speak to us one more time if this will be the last service that we are going to have we don't know but we're going to make use of this time that you've given to us to assemble in your name oh Father last night we were reading about something where your prophet was saying that as a child when a mother or father wants to put a cloth on them a coat the child cannot even lift up the hands well they cannot do it themselves it falls back it falls down this way that way and this is what the prophet said if we can yield to you to put on the clothes sometimes we forget that you are the only one that can dress us in your word we try to go the other way but this morning Father we want to ask you to help us We cannot put it ourselves whatever is coming Upon Us in this time this age we have we cannot do anything about it the only thing that we can do is to surrender to you is to feed upon this word because it's upon this word that we can withstand whatever is coming no president no economy can change what is coming we better get into the boat it's getting too late as the prophet said this morning Father we want to put away the things that we think we can do by ourselves by looking at one another but to look up to you Jesus this morning help us to raise up our eyes and look up to only you not even one person on in the same Pew with us Lord but look up to you this morning once again father we thank you we bless your name that your word is still alive Your Grace is still alive and this morning we are here to rejoice in what you are done father now we pray as your word is coming may you prepare place in our hearts to receive the word Lord Jesus as brother Paul is leading us through songs Lord may we forget about what we are going to do after service and put in whatever that we can this morning so we can receive the blessing once again we are bringing our tithes and offering we pray that you receive it now in Jesus name that we pray amen foreign [Music] oh dear pass Me by oh save you save yourself [Music] oh oh I am on others

privilege it is to assemble ourselves this way knowing that we haven't gathered together to hear from Brother Barry we haven't gathered together to hear from a man we have come to hear from the King we have come to Feast at the king's table and you know we don't have to eat pulse today brothers and sisters we can eat the king's meat we can eat the king's bread and we can drink the King's Wine and we can be Anointed with the king's anointing we just have a couple of prayer requests we'd like to bring before the church today I I just love the way the spirit moves I I just want to remember brother Aiden who is sick today brother Aiden lives he's at home we have a praise report I want to thank God for his healing touch on sister Tina she's out of the hospital and home still requiring a touch from the Lord but she's not in the hospital and we know the victories victories can come an inch at a time most of the victories in fact are an inch at a time they're not a great miracle certainly thank the Lord for that praise report if you have a request this morning just maybe make it known unto him with an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you this this morning Lord Jesus for another opportunity to come and feast at your table Lord Jesus we know that you have more prepared than we could possibly manage father and this morning we just ask father that you would just allow us to help ourselves to apportion father that we need a portion that will satisfy us father individually father we know that you deal with Israel as a nation but you deal with the Gentiles as an individual so father this morning Lord Jesus let it be all about me father let it be all about my brother and my sister today Father we pray that you would just touch each one father we know that you're already here so we're not going to invite you here we're going to welcome you and thank you Father for Lord just living up to your word Lord Jesus for being accountable to your word Lord we know that heavens and earth will pass away we know that we can't even take many times our brother or our sister's words father but Lord Jesus when you speak when we read your word we know that you will always back your word father and we thank you for that today Lord Jesus we thank you for your word that said Lord Jesus by your stripes we are healed and father we thank you that we can claim that word Lord Jesus as our present tense I am for brother Aiden livsy right now Lord Jesus father we pray that you would just raise him up Lord Jesus even in his own home father that he would just begin a little Revival in his own heart father in his own home Lord Jesus father we know that you can do that we know that you can bring a Revival here today Father and Lord Jesus I pray for each hand that was made known unto you with a request father that you would just bless them Lord that you would just Lord honor the faith of that individual Lord Jesus father I pray sovereignly for this church today Lord Jesus that you would grant us a little Revival here at Calgary Living Word father we know the great revivals are over lord Jesus but your Prophet said the bride's Revival is burning ever strong Lord Jesus that's not something that's ever going to go out we're going to take that Revival with us all the way across Jordan into eternity father for a millennium as you parade us in front of Satan Lord Jesus to show that you have taken a bride that will not be moved from your word Lord Jesus father this morning we pray that you would just be glorified in all that's said and done father we thank you for another opportunity to meet with you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen hallelujah oh my thank you musicians this morning you have your Bibles I just want to take a little bit of a different direction I want to turn to Isaiah 57 this morning Isaiah 57 certainly thankful for the leadership of the Lord many times I wonder where to go and and what to do what should we talk about Lord what should we oh my try and bring and it's in the wee hours of the day that he comes by and he shows us very clearly and then he backs it up with the Vindication and song A Vindication in word my my my Isaiah 57 verse 13. when thou cryest let thy companies deliver thee but the wind shall carry them all away vanity shall take them but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my Holy Mountain and shall say cast ye up cast ye up prepare the way take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place and with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones let's just bow in prayer one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your word we thank you for your goodness to us Lord and we thank you Father that you have shown us very clearly who will abide with you in your Holy Mountain we know that you resist the proud father oh Lord Jesus but you raise up the humble father and this morning we just ask father that you could just raise us up Lord father that we could just push aside any thoughts or any reasoning father that we could just take every thought into captivity father Lord Jesus that we could just tear down strongholds father and just allow you Lord Jesus to revive the fire in the hearts of your children this morning Father Lord Jesus and I pray don't leave mine out Lord father allow me to have a Revival as well father Lord Jesus we all long for that and we just ask that today you would be glorified in all that said and done Lord Jesus help the speaker to get out of the way let me get out of the way Lord Jesus and just give you the the full preeminence that you desire Lord Jesus and I pray that you would just speak to each one father as you see fit we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning you may be seated certainly excited about today I want to talk about being contrite today that's the word that came to me at about four o'clock this morning contrite being contrite that's the ones who are going to inhabit that Holy Mountain would you mind just turning down the monitors a little bit brother a just want to remind everyone as well if you're tuning in when I ask to turn down the monitors it's not turning down the sound to anybody it's just turning down the speakers that are on the stage here I had a question about that this week and just don't get nervous if I say that it's only the sound right here are you happy today is like today it makes me nervous I feel really nervous it's really strange how it works because I know the Lord's here I know that he's leading this and he's leading us and we certainly want to just be in service for him just want to welcome everyone and trust that you feel well today certainly excited because today is a real special day one of a few days that we see in our lives and this is the day where sister Jewel and sister Joanna and sister Victoria olaji are going to change their lives forever in a watery grave they're going to get baptized the Lord has revealed to them that it's up to them to make that step forward and I sure appreciate a parent's perspective on that that doesn't thrust their children forward to do something that's not been revealed to them but allows the Lord to reveal it because when that happens then it becomes their very own revelation and when they drive down that stake and and go forwards by Revelation they can always look back to that time we know that if someone can be talked into something then they can be talked out of it but when it becomes a revelation brother Branham said that's a free gift from God directly from God to the individual the ability to hear from him and then to act on it so we're certainly excited we're going to have a baptism after service today we have a communion service tonight it's just going to be a church day today we're certainly excited about that we've got the youth banquet coming up on Saturday it's posted on the youth chat if anybody has any questions please reach out to us um brother Toby is going to take the the meeting and I trust the Lord has put something on his heart for the Youth some words of encouragement words that will help them we know that we can come up with many different uh many different things in our own thinking and we can even get into the psychological Realms and and encourage people but nothing encourages a son or a daughter of God like the word of God does I just wanted to also inform everyone that uh this might be the last service that we see sister Rosie here with us her plane ticket has been sort of bounced around and it sounds like she might be going back either right away or on the first of December as I understand so if you get an opportunity please Shake sister Rosie's hand it's been a wonderful opportunity to fellowship with you sister it's wonderful when you Minister when you song Lead when you're at the pulpit here and you see someone who is a Believer because they're always engaged and they're just happy they just they just draw it's wonderful and that's that's that's how I would describe sister Rosie just a believer that draws draws the word out of me it's wonderful I have her phone number if you would like to keep in touch with her via WhatsApp we can certainly uh pass that along and I fully intend to keep in touch with sister Rosie there's a brother that's reached out to me from India and maybe Lord willing I told sister Rosie we'll come and visit her there one day we know that brother Wayne is quite familiar with the people over there as well so we'll just see what the Lord has in store God bless you Sister Rosie [Applause] you know I just uh I'm probably gonna seem scattered but I just trust the Lord will uh take the word today and just bless it just bless it to our spiritual nourishment you know when we look at our lives and we see who we are as believers we have to remember that we're not wrestling against flesh and blood we're not wrestling against our brother and our sister our husband our wives our children even though my goodness it feels like we're wrestling with our children and as parents we wonder why are we wrestling with our children the children are supposed to obey their parents why are we wrestling with our wives our wives are supposed to just submit to us as husbands but as husbands are we submitting to the Lord because the word says to follow me as I follow Christ that's what Paul told the church the female but we need to recognize that we are subject to a higher power Romans 13 verse 1 says let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of God the powers that are ordained of God Amen amen so if we have a power inside an office or inside a relationship it's only the power of God that we have we don't have our own power Every Soul needs to be subject unto the higher powers verse 2 says whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation and where I want to go today is just a discussion I guess about King David and the life of King David and how the life of King David it's just so good and so rich we're all super familiar with it I know but it's just the direction the Lord has taken me and I believe that the life of King David it parallels the life of a believer the life of a real believer it can be pretty easy to not act like King David King David had so much occasion to act upon his enemies but did he did not act on his enemies he simply took it and went forwards even to the point where and and I'm just jumping to the very end but even to the point where his son came against him and remember when Absalom came against him and and his generals went out and risked their lives to kill to take and destroy the enemy Absalom which was his son they went out and destroyed his son they put their lives at risk to go out and have this battle to save the king and to save his throne because absolence we know his his mission was to kill David was to kill his father murderer we know that was demonic it was satanic but we know that was a prophecy as well but his mission was to destroy his dad and in the end after they came back and gave word to say the boy is dead he even gave instruction to his generals bring no harm to the boy we know joash he said no no it's enough of this we need to get rid of this we're going to take matters into our own hands even after all of that putting all of their lives at risk David cried out for his son the heart of David just to think about how David's heart was wired is contrary to human thinking it's contrary to what we can comprehend with our human Minds that's why we have to remember that we need to be subject to a higher power not just sometimes not just when we come to church but when we walk the walk not just talk the talk it's easy to talk the talk but when we live our lives in our positions when we're with our families when we're alone we've got to be subject to the higher power we know that David he was taken from being a Shepherd boy to a mighty warrior and what did that we talked about it a couple minutes ago revelation God revealed himself to David David was able to go and save his father's Sheep by the anointing that God gave him not through the prophet but through a revelation and then we know that he was anointed there was an anointing there was a call but where did that call come from it's so beautiful it came from a prophet didn't it came from a prophet when he was just busy living his life doing his own thing David was nobody just doing nothing really in the eyes of the world and that's how many times us as Believers can be just out there doing our own thing but we hear the call of a prophet and something happens to us we follow that call when we follow that call there's an anointing that comes with it whether we recognize it or not and we know that he wasn't just anointed to be successful in looking after his father's sheep he was anointed to be king he was anointed to be king over Israel we know that all of this that was going on in the background was forming a character inside of David to become king to be able to take the throne to be able to Reign and and it's such an interesting parallel I believe but you know David wasn't able to be king on his own this is really what I want to get into and it's probably going to be a few service discussion we'll see maybe just today and tonight but what got David to the place where he was ready to be king was that he got to the place where he had a contrite spirit we had a humble heart he did not get puffed up he got crushed David was crushed to powder but yet something in him let him praise the Lord and we know that's exactly according to the word of God to say you know thank the Lord for the fiery trials don't get upset and say oh woe is me because of this trial we need to be rejoicing thanking God for the trial which is contrary to what this human flesh would say what the devil wants us to say thank the Lord for the trial because we know that it's worth more than the precious gold tried in the fire our trials are really what helps form us really what helps form us to have the character to rule and to Reign if we're going to be a king if we're going to sit with him in his throne brother and sister it's not going to be a free gift for us to just walk out of this world and into that world and set with him in his throne we need to be like King David and recognize that we are going to be tried tested and true we are going to prove that we have that Spirit of Christ in us through a contrite spirit through a humble heart we are not going to get puffed up and say hey I I believe God sent a prophet and all is good and I've baptized and saved and everything is going to be fine Satan's going to challenge us on every single front and you know what if we don't have the real deal then all that can be shaken will be shaken we'll be shaken right out of the church but what will get us to the place where we know that we know I hope we can get to that today James 4 verse 6 but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble he giveth Grace unto the humble and he resists the proud We were talking about this on the way to church today about resisting and I just can't help but think about the the the description how if you've ever played with magnets before you can have magnets and if you point them the right way I'm not an expert but I'm just going to word it the way that I know it if you point them one way they will actually attract together they'll snap together because there's actually an attraction but if you put them the other way one magnet turn it the other way it will resist you will not be able to push those two magnets together you can get them really close together but they'll never totally come together and it's interesting because I just can't help but think that's exactly what God's spirit does with a proud spirit with someone who is actually a bit puffed up in their life they're they're in a position where they just can't let go of something remember brother random preach the message doors in a door and usually what it is there's one place in the human heart we know there's one place in the human heart where God made for his own self to reside in and it's only in a human heart that was proven by science brother Branham said but we know inside that little space there's little compartments I'm going to word it this way there's little compartments inside that little space and unless we're willing to give that entire little space we will not see the spirit of Christ in our lives well it won't be a part of an anointing and we'll see a good move and it will feel good but it won't be the indwelling that sealing of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives because God resists the proud he resists the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you many times what I I see brothers and sisters and I'm guilty of it and I just want to say it this way I trust it's okay that sometimes many times we can find ourselves running from a devil and trying to to outwit a devil and outmatch a devil and outdo a devil and and maybe we'll take the word of God and try and apply it to a devil but that's not the way to deal with the Devil the only way we're going to deal with the Devil is to have the right attitude to recognize it's only going to be a humble heart that God will use to deal with the Devil but first we have to submit ourselves unto God then we have to resist the devil there is something for us to do we've got to do those first two parts but when we do those first two parts what's the scripture say we don't try and Chase the devil we don't try and run from a devil we just let the devil flee from us that's what the word says the devil will flee from us draw nigh to God He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up we cannot just lift ourselves up and think that it's going to be okay it won't be okay brothers and sisters we've got to make sure that we we keep ourselves in tune with the word of God and you know as I look at this stuff I I I study it I I think Lord help me I wonder Lord I I really don't feel like I want to go and talk about this because it almost feels like something is is is is is happening not in a good way it doesn't make me feel good to do this but I just have to follow the leadership of the Lord like I said to you that word came to me at about four o'clock this morning then I heard it in a prayer then I heard it in a song I say Amen okay let's go let's see what the Lord has in store for us you know in that message he careth for you first Peter 5 verse 5 likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you I just can't help but think that that could be the title of the service today but I know it's it's it's a contrite spirit it's a contrite heart just contrite would be the title if I had to give it one he cares for you brothers and sisters that's why he gives us trials that's why we get the Fiery trials in our lives because he cares for us he won't allow sin to go unpunished he won't allow sin to lay there in our lives undetected he will always identify the sin we know the word says be sure that your sins will find you out it's so that God will make sure that we are all in our position all of his children will come to him not one of them will be lost we know that's what the word says we want to see the spirit of the Lord move in our lives and you know what I I just think brothers and sisters is it's going to be a Revival and it's going to be the bride's Revival we can look up bride's Revival I'm not going there today but we all know it brother Bradham says it if you haven't known it or you haven't heard him say it just look it up bride's Revival brother Branham talks about it there is a revival going on and it's an individual Revival it's the bride's Revival his bride around the world it's happening whether people see it or they don't it's happening doesn't matter it's not a great big show we know that that's the third poll the bride's Revival it's the word being manifest to this world and as we eat it we become it you know today what I want to do brothers and sisters I want to tear down strongholds because that's what the word says I want to I want to try and get right down to the nitty-gritty of some of this stuff right down to the root cause because if we can get down to the roots of things we can actually fix things but if we just always maybe just spray the plant on the top and maybe just prune a little bit on the top and and try and do a topical ointment we're not really getting to the root of the matter but if we can get right down to the nitty-gritty I believe we can see the power of God move in our lives maybe in a way that would be maybe just a little bit different than what we've seen and I'm not saying that we're Sinners and and we've got terrible sin in the camp what I'm saying is I want to see great success spiritually speaking in our lives brothers and sisters where we know that any Joe Lewis Spirit could walk through that door like brother Branham said and actually be cast out we know that there would not be one Spirit able to stand in the midst of the Church of the Living God today I just want to potentially get into tearing down strongholds I just can't help but think about David's life being a parallel of the True Believer and how he was at one time out doing his own thing but he was called by the voice of the Prophet to be anointed and it's the same thing for us brothers and sisters we can come to that place where we've been anointed by the prophet and it can take some time for that anointing to actually come to the place where we're able to see something change in our lives but what we have to do is put one foot in front of the other and keep marching forward we cannot be weak we can't be cowardly we have to March forward brother Branham says God says he can't use a coward so if we just get upset and turn our back on the word or on the church then how can we ever go forwards in the word but remember he was anointed by the spirit from the prophet I think that's such a beautiful thought but in the meantime he was dealing with Saul who had an agenda and Saul wanted to kill him Saul didn't like the fact that he actually was maybe favored by God he he it started way back when they went out and they went to battle and when they came back into the city we know this was probably after he killed Goliath David after Saul and David came back from the battles they came into the City and and they said oh Saul he killed his hundreds they were singing the song right the women were or the people were but David killed his thousands what a tremendous thing that is to hear but what a terrible thing that would be for Saul to recognize but he realized something happened in his life he recognized that the kingdom was actually changing and we know that Saul he actually didn't follow the word of the Lord he actually took the king of the amorites was it and and they decided you know we're just we're just gonna take the fatlings we're going to take the good cows and we're going to take the good sheep and you know we'll kill most of the people but we'll bring the king in and we'll save him as well we won't kill him right away and what happened when the prophet came to him when Samuel came to him he said what on Earth are you doing firstly you're doing a sacrifice out of order you know brother Branham he talks about it try to do God a service without a being as well he just didn't want to wait for the prophet to come and allow the prophet to do what he was supposed to do to offer the sacrifice so what happened he goes ahead and does a sacrifice he goes ahead and keeps he does everything against what the instruction was and the prophet said to him you know what because of this this is not the first time it's not the second time it's it's many times and this is it God's done with you the kingdom is going to be rent out of your hands and what did he do then he got serious then he wanted to pray then he wanted to fast then he wanted to have a religious service then he wanted to get excited only because then he actually knew where he stood brothers and sisters we don't have to wait until the end until things get terrible in our lives to decide to get serious to decide to have a Revival in our lives we can do it now we can do it today I just can't help but think how exciting that is all had an agenda he didn't like that David had the spirit of the Lord the spirit of the Lord was with David and you know I I know this for sure brothers and sisters people don't like it when the spirit of the Lord is with you they can see it and you know they can't necessarily say the spirit of the Lord that person but there's something different about that person brother Branham says you might be a little bit of a fanatic right you need to be careful who who we look at and who we judge because that could easily be the spirit of the Lord with that person but Saul didn't like that David he had the ability to cast out Devils with music so through Saul's disobedience he was able to get angry at David because he was disobedient now he he was going to take it and take it out on David and we know that that drove him mad brothers and sisters this morning if I just want to say this it's so vital for us to recognize it's really kind of cut and dried call it black and white call it call it I don't know what you want to call it but call it good or bad but if we refuse to accept the holy spirit in our lives we don't just accept the mark of the beast that's that's one thing we do that's sort of a title that we can give it if we refuse the spirit of God in our lives then God will give us over to an evil spirit he won't just leave us on our own to be neutral in our own land to just carry on until we go into destruction he will give us an evil spirit he will allow that to come our way we need to make sure we know where we stand that's why I keep saying harping on the Holy Ghost you got to have the Holy Ghost you have to there's no other option in our day brothers and sisters and the only way you get it is to repent recognize that you're a sinner you come into the world speaking lies born in sin shapes and iniquity and that you need the Holy Ghost you need Christ to save you you need a savior and when you recognize that and you follow his word and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you'll get the Holy Ghost you'll be sealed in till the day of your Redemption that's it one one and done call it one and done and you know what how you can tell if you are one and done you'll follow the word that's all you'll just say Amen to the word for your day I think it's so beautiful I was listening to the messages and brother Brandon was talking about it how you know he was talking to a brother who was one of the hardest Brothers he said to uh convert I can't remember what the message is offhand but he said you know this brother he was baptized in uh titles and he was really really argumentative about it and brother Branham said to him you know you don't have to get so upset about it just get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ no no no no no it's got to be the Father the Son the Holy Ghost brother Branham finally said to him would you get baptized then would you baptize someone in the name of the Rose of Sharon nope the lily of the valley nope the Bright Morning Star nope he said those are all titles he said so is father so is Son and so is Holy Ghost they're all titles everybody here knows this I know there might be someone watching that doesn't but the true name is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's why he came in a Corporal body that's why he came to the Earth so that he could have that name so that we could comprehend with our finite Minds God in flesh in the beginning was the word the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us David was dealing with the King that turned mad and why did he turn mad because he resisted the Holy Ghost in his day he resisted the leadership of the Lord in his day and what was that in his day it was actually the word of the prophet some might say well the Holy Ghost wasn't yet given and no it truly wasn't but the leadership of the Lord is the same as the Holy Ghost it's the same Spirit whether it's in the Old Testament or the New Testament you know that uh David was given the opportunity to destroy this guy who was coming at him Saul Saul he wanted to kill him and David had many occasions a few occasions to kill him that we know of but he also knew first chronicles 16 22 saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm David knew the word so he wouldn't go further than the word said he could because he had a contrite heart because he had a humble spirit even when he heard Saul was killed I believe the messenger said let's Rejoice let's party and what did David do he said no this is wrong one of God's anointed were killed today this was a great man of God and he was anointed and raised up of God it wasn't just some haphazard thing but he was a rejected King he rejected the leadership of the Holy Ghost in his life he was given over to an evil spirit it's no different for us brothers and sisters if you're a king and a priest you reject the leadership of the Holy Ghost you won't just sit neutral but even when Saul was killed he was upset and you know brothers and sisters this is really where I'm going I'm just sort of laying a background here and and that's why it might seem a little bit weird I guess but David didn't climb his way to the throne many times people might paint that picture that David he just climbed his way right up the steps right to the throne what happened was David was crushed all the way to the throne David had to continually check his heart David had to continually throw down his own Pride he continually had to make sure that he was not puffing himself up and standing up and doing what maybe rightly he could according to the word what he did do was actually follow the leadership of the Lord and we know that David was the type of Christ isn't it interesting to look at the life of David as you go on maybe this is weird but I I don't know I guess we'll just go for the ride but David then after Saul was gone he did Ascend to the throne by following the word but what happened there were still some of David that had to be taken out of him wasn't there there was murder inside of David there was adultery inside of David both of those things had to come out of him and you know how do they come out of our Lives brothers and sisters by exposing them only by exposing them we know that David he was given the word from the prophet after this happened after he he had Uriah killed and and Nathan came to him and told him the story about the man with the sheep and how he had the lamb and and the one was was was full of plentius and and the other one he had only one it was his special lamb but this man came and took that one and we know the prophet Nathan he came in and he told them that's you David that's you David you need to actually listen up because God has a word from you because you took Uriah and you killed him by the sword of the enemy and you took his wife now God will judge you and isn't it wonderful to think in the midst of that judgment the prophet said oh by the way God will spare your life you won't die even though you should die because that was the word that you said what should happen to that man that actually stepped over we should require his life today plus he should pay fourfold the crime but God who is rich in Mercy hey says Nope he's a man after my own heart and we'll not kill you but that baby that baby will be required of you today kill this man took his wife had a baby he still had that that adultery and he still had that murder inside of him the anointed one but isn't it wonderful how God deals with that stuff like like we said he he deals with it by exposing it by exposing it by bringing it up to the surface so it's not hidden anymore and that's what trials do in our lives brothers and sisters brother Branham talks about the lake being stirred up what it does is it stirs up all the trash and it brings it out to the place where we can gather it up and get rid of it not try and push it down under the water and and just hide it and maybe just keep it around you don't want that in our lives God forgave him for his sin but he took the baby's life and we know in the word it's such an interesting thought that Bathsheba was never called David's wife was she was always called the wife of Uriah the king's wife was always called the wife of Uriah but as he went forwards he knew there was a prophecy in his life he heard it the prophet gave it to him for second Samuel 12. maybe we could just turn the there sorry turned he there second Samuel chapter 12 verse 8. it's okay this morning looking at a contrite heart and how the Lord used David to give us an example second Samuel 12 verse 8. this is the prophecy that David had now as he went forward as a king knowing god at the level that he knew God he had this prophecy in his heart Thy word have I hid in mine heart that I might not sin against thee II Samuel 12 verse 8 says and I gave thee thy Master's house and thy Master's wives into thy bosom and gave Thee the house of Israel and of Judah and if that had been too little I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things wherefore hast thou despised the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight thou Hast killed Uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou Hast despised me and has taken the wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus saith the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and I will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto Thy Neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this son for thou ditched it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun where I want to get to with that is that God would not hide this sin it turned into a tremendous problem for him when Absalom started this insurrection when his son raised up and decided that he was going to take over the throne we know that it started so subtly just with maybe a a conversation maybe in someone's living room just a discussion and then it turned into more conversation and more discussion and before long suddenly he started to feel like maybe there was something for him to do and we know that this was the pointed of the Lord this was prophecy coming to pass he probably couldn't even help it himself you know God said to David I gave thee thy Master's house and and all of his wives and everything that was in it and if that had been too little I'm moreover would have given unto these such and such things whatever you wanted David if you would have just said it to me if you would have wanted Bathsheba I would have gave her to you but you had to ask me for it if you would have wanted another wife I would have given her to you but you had to ask me for it you couldn't just go and do it on your own but I I just think this is the part here that really I think is critical for us when we look at this as paralleling the life of a Believer wherefore hast thou despised the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight how many times in our lives do we despise the Commandment of the Lord and what happens is we wind up doing evil in his sight when we despise the Commandment of the Lord and we know the Commandments of the Lord there's many of them but as Believers we live under grace don't we many times we could say that we live under grace so the Commandments don't have any effect but they do have effect and you know Jesus said when he came I don't come to do away with the law I came to magnify the law I I came to show you that we could actually live that law in our flesh and when we come to the place in our lives as a Christian believer where we say I just can't do it on my own that's exactly where God wants us to get because that's the beginning of a contrite heart and a broken spirit and a humble heart that's where God wants us to get to the place where we recognize we can't do it on our own and many times if people don't have the right foundation in their lives according to the word that's where they'll just burn up and leave they'll just be out of the church in the heartbeat because they can't do it on their own they're 100 right the only way we can do it on our own is to get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when we have the Holy Ghost in our Our Lives we will do it the right way and you know maybe we'll make a mistake we'll trip and fall we might not understand what the scripture says about a certain thing but if we do hear correction about that through the scripture through the message well what happened to us as a true son and daughter of God we will surrender our will to that word every single time we will not say no no no I'm I got it I know that I'm doing things right this is the way that I've been taught remember brother Branham talked about the little Sunfish that was raised up he told about that prophecy about that little animal that was going to be raised up I just can't help but think about that that man that was there with him that Jehovah's Witness I believe it was and he said that he was throwing that fly line out if there's anybody here that fishes you'll know what I'm talking about he's throwing the fly line out and and he's just taken and letting the fish swallow that hook all the way down instead of actually just catching the fish is what brother Branham said when you see a fish rise to a fly line you can actually catch it but what I'm saying is such a simple analogy is the prophet gave him correction he said you don't have to do it that way you can just catch the fish but what did he say oh that's the way we do it around here that's just the way we do it brothers and sisters sometimes we can be guilty of saying that that's just the way we do it around here that's just the way we've always done it that's the way I was raised does it line up with the word that's the only thing I can say if it lines up with the word then let's high five and say Amen to that but if it isn't lining up with the word if there is something that maybe isn't congruent with the message of the hour then let's take a step backwards and just maybe think about it for a little bit because he resists the proud and if we're not willing to say maybe I'll take a look at this word and and see what it is because I have a humble spirit and I've got a contrite heart we become proud if we're not there but wherefore hast thou despise the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight thou has killed Uriah the hittite with the sword taken his wife to be thy wife slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou Hast despised me and has taken the wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus saith the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and I will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this son for thou didst it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun I don't have the scripture in front of me but this is exactly what happened when David was disgraced when David walked away from the city when David went back out into the Wilderness the second time because he wasn't climbing his way to the throne he knew that this was coming in his life he knew that that sword would raise up in his house he knew that evil was just there in his house and there was no way that he could Escape it because it was the word of the Lord it was thus saith the Lord from the prophet and it was just a matter of time before it began to manifest in his life and the people around him couldn't understand that but David knew in his heart he knew that God had spoke and the only thing that he could do was just govern himself accordingly at that point and that's what he did he stepped aside and he went out into the Wilderness and he didn't take the throne he didn't climb clamor he didn't fight his son he just let his son do his thing and this scripture came to pass God allowed his sin to be manifest David's sin to be manifest before all of Israel if you recall the scripture it's the one I said I don't have it's there in Samuel I believe where Absalom was instructed by one of the one of the counselors in the king's court to take an erected tent on top of the building and show everyone now that he can have relations with his father's wives with the concubines what a terrible thing that is what an open display of sin that is but that's the way God will do it if we will not be willing to Humble our hearts in the sight of the Lord so he can lift us up he will take and expose whatever it is we've got in secret and allow it to manifest before everyone's eyes and that's when it becomes so difficult because we have got to either get real humble or run away one of those two things will happen but the Sons and Daughters of God they'll just get more humble because they'll recognize it's God dealing with them and you know brothers and sisters the reason I'm going this way is I want to see us I want to go back to it I want to see a Revival in our hearts I want to see a Revival in our lives I want to see us not just comfortable in the message of the hour not just comfortable sitting at Calgary Living Word assembly and fellowshipping it's good it's wonderful we want to do that but we want more we want to get out of here we want to see the power of almighty God living out through our lives otherwise what's the point in it contrite the seven Church ages brother Branham 1954.0512 you can get forgiveness for crucifying Jesus you can get forgiveness for taking his name in vain but who speaks against the Holy Ghost will never be forgiven him in this world or the world to come we're in the last day so be careful walk humbly have a contrite broken spirit a humble heart willing to let the Holy Spirit Lead You amen we've got to be willing to go that way brothers and sisters that's the word of the Prophet that's the word of the Lord through the prophet for the people we know that the word of the lord always comes to a prophet we need to have a contrite broken spirit a humble heart willing to let the Holy Spirit lead us if we don't have that then we don't have the leadership of the Lord in our lives Brothers but my sisters it's just not the way it works brother Branham talks about the lamb and the dove the lamb is led by the dove the lamb is not led by a wolf nature what happens is that Dove just flies up to the tree and says you know when you get the right nature again I'll come back and I'll visit you but until then I'm just going to sit up here and many times we can think that we've got that dove in our lives and we don't have that dove in our lives and this trick of the devil this is where the devil is it's so close that it would deceive they're very elected if it were possible he'll come around when you have the Dove and try and make you think you don't have the dove what is that but if you've got the right Spirit it will line up with the word of God it will say Amen to the word of God and if God exposes something in your life what you'll do is trip over yourself to make it better not run from it and cover it and hide it and fight it that's not a contrite broken Spirit a humble heart willing to let the Holy Spirit lead you but boy when that happens brothers and sisters there ain't nothing that will stand in your way there's no price that's too big to pay there's no no gift too big to give there's no nothing that we aren't willing to do when we get to that place in our lives where we have truly got a contrite broken Spirit a humble heart willing to let the Holy Spirit lead us there ain't nothing that we won't do to follow the will of the Lord in our lives nothing we'll quit jobs we'll actually move locations we'll leave churches we'll go to other churches we'll do whatever we need to do to please the will of the father because that's what a broken heart does that's what a contrite spirit does a humble heart willing to be led by the Holy Spirit we will just do what the Lord says for us to do you know many times in our lives we can talk about these things and uh I I don't want to make it so it's you know kind of out there and nebulous the the quotes can can sometimes do that and and even to the point where as message Believers children who are raised in the message of the hour the quotes can can make it seem like well it's just it's just do this and then you'll get that and it's a real simple equation but how does that apply to me in my life well there's things in our lives that are identifiers that I think we can talk about but you know one of the things that I want to I want to throw out there is is if we are looking for a different result brothers and sisters if we're looking for something different to happen in our lives we cannot just keep doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result I just want to say this in in my heart my heart of hearts I'm sorry Once Upon a Time I did say something and it was probably an immaturity but I think I I bear the results of it now and I truly am sorry for it I said we're going to have a prayer meeting on Thursday night and if you don't want to come we don't want you there anyways people got offended by that and I truly apologize for that because I don't want to offend anybody what I want to do is the opposite I want to encourage people and as I said out of immaturity I said that but you know brothers and sisters if we want to see more of God there's more of God to be had but the only way we're going to get it is to Humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord and He will lift us up and you know on Thursday night we read a scripture the chapter actually Psalms 86 maybe you want to bookmark that and just read it later we could read it now but I think it maybe we'll read it tonight or something I don't know Psalms chapter 86 I would say that let that be my prayer but you know brothers and sisters we we've we've got to be willing to put God before everything in our lives and not say there's anything before God in our lives because we know what the word says about that if there's anything in our lives that comes before God it's idolatry and that's what the word says that's what the prophet says talking about a prayer meeting Brother Brad I mean he says this quote and I just want to read it I read it on Thursday evening I just think it's important brothers and sisters remembering contrite remembering a humble heart remembering a broken Spirit that's what David had many times we look at David and say he was the mighty king he was a mighty warrior but look at his heart he had scars man he was broken he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him I'm not saying by his stripes we were healed but I am saying that he was a type of Christ David was a type of Christ if we want to see a different result in our lives maybe we need to do something a little different greater than Solomon is here in 1962 brother Branham says and then people stay home from prayer meeting it shows where their heart's at that's the reason there can't be a Revival that's right he says however that's your pastor's Place see and so I I guess I find myself there saying that and that's why I don't really want to say it but I I just believe what the prophet said he said see he tells you that listen I'm just telling you too so you'll know my part believe it too I believe the same thing yes sir oh God what we need is a Revival coming all the way from the pulpit to the janitor Stir It Up an old-fashioned backwards backwards blue sky blue God sent Pentecostal Revival that's right brothers and sisters this is where it really gets important for us to recognize he says this not not whitewashed but washed White not whitewashed not just outward apparel adorning good message Behavior I I come to church I pay my tithes I'm a member I I have lots of friends no not whitewashed but washed white that's right not saying talk about the glory of God but the glory of God revealing the glory of God that's what we need in the church today I just wanted to say that brothers and sisters if we want to see more of God there's more of God to be seen there's more of God to be had if we have things in our life struggles that are going on that we're silently fighting through come together confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed we don't have to just fight the battles on our own we don't have to do that brothers and sisters that's what the body of Christ is for getting back to our thought today talking about being contrite David recognizing that you know we can do things in secret we can do things in private but God nothing is hidden from him he sees everything that goes on he knows our every thought he sees our every action every single thing that happens and you know I love how brother Branham says it too in the message he'll say it that he knows even your thoughts right now right now he knows our thoughts what we're thinking what's in our hearts do we have a contrite heart a humble Spirit willing to be led of the Holy Ghost or is there some resistance saying brother Barry that's not the way that I've learned it that's not the way that my pastor taught me that's not what I was taught by my parents you know I don't know if it was or it wasn't I know it wasn't what I was taught but I know that I've actually been able to hear the word of God and I know that his word is true I can only say what the Lord has shown me according to the message of the hour contrite out of the seven Church ages 1954 you can get forgiveness for crucifying Jesus you can get forgiveness for taking his name in vain but who speaks against the Holy Ghost will never be forgiven him in this world or the world to come we're in the last day so be careful walked humbly have a contrite broken Spirit a humble heart willing to let the Holy Spirit Lead You amen you know we are talking about it this morning in the Bible study that there's two unpardonable sins and we have heard it many times that there's one and we all know that that's blaspheming right that's true there's another one and that one is unforgiveness brothers and sisters unforgiveness because as we forgive we will be forgiven if we're hanging on to something that we're not forgiving someone for then we won't be forgiven ourselves that portion is going to be refrained from us and you know I I know this is where we're getting down to the nitty-gritty this is where we really get into where it starts to hurt people but brothers and sisters we're not allowed to have unforgiveness in our hearts we're just not we have got to be willing to let go of all of the things in our lives there can't be anything holding back the spirit of God and you know many times we can look at it and say well back in the day so and so did such and such to me or so and so did such and such to so and so maybe our parents got hurt maybe our brother or our sister got hurt maybe a cousin or a friend got hurt maybe something happened in the church who knows what happened Satan will use any manner of things better yet God will allow any manner of things to happen so that circumstances will come to pass to prove Who We Are but brothers and sisters we can't hold on to nothing and you know if we've got hurt in our lives we have got to go back to where that hurt lies and uncover it and deal with it properly by giving forgiveness and then moving on and as long as we don't do that we give Satan an opportunity to be there in our lives we give that resistance to be there in our lives and that will quash the the benefit of a spirit that will quash the benefit of a prayer meeting that will quash the benefit of anything that could happen in terms of the Lord blessing our lives I'm not saying it will all the time but it certainly could and you know what's worse brother Branham says that if we have something that we drag into a service we could actually potentially Rob someone else of their blessing who on Earth would want to do that brothers and sisters if we've got something in our lives that goes way back and it's deep down just deal with it I'm not talking about a psychological thing I'm just talking about dealing with the root cause of the problem recognizing that it's a devil hiding there in your life and you've got the ability according to the word for your day to deal with it because if we submit ourselves therefore unto God resist the devil then he will flee from us but first we've got to recognize what it is we've got to go go and take a look sometimes and you know brothers and sisters we were we were having a conversation and I just I just think we can only be honest about this stuff how important it is to recognize that we can actually be holding on to things in our lives where you know maybe we have got forgiveness for everyone around us but something happened in our lives that just didn't seem fair and what can happen is we can have resentment to God we can have something in our lives where maybe we just don't think that that was fair that God allowed that to happen to me in my life and you know what's worse sometimes we can do things and even say that we don't forgive ourselves but as we're forgiven as we forgive we'll be forgiven can we forgive ourselves can we forgive God things will happen he'll allow us to get to a place so that we can have a contrite heart so that we can have a humble Spirit broken not our own will but his will because you know what just like David never climbed his way to the throne we ain't climbing our way to the throne The Only Way Up Is Down brothers and sisters and we know that to be the truth according to the message of the hour the only way up is down and the only way we're going to get down is to recognize that we have nothing on our own to bring we know that we are not saved through anything that we have done it's only a free gift from God out of the Seal of God in 1954. well did you ever see a Railroader loading the cars he will go out and he will set so much here and so much here the inspector comes by he looks in and if this is a little loose he shakes it nope I won't seal it got to tear it out and do it over again next thing he will try to load it again he will get this wrong the inspector will come by wrong do it over again and that's what God's been doing with his church for a long time and you know I'll say it brothers and sisters even today that's what God's doing with brother Barry how about you there's things in our lives that he wants fixed up he wants packed properly and the reason for it is it's got a journey to take and if we don't have it packed up right it's not going to wind up at the Final Destination but what we need to do is make sure that we get it right get it packed in properly the inspector comes by looks in and if if he sees that it's a little loose it shakes nope I won't seal it he says gotta tear it out and do it over again next thing he'll try to load it again he will get this wrong the inspector will come by wrong do it over again and that's what God's been doing with his church for a long time you load it up and you're going to heaven you're going to take everything with you your card games huh and I'm going to pause there and say whatever else take the card games out and say whatever else brothers and sisters maybe it's movies maybe it's magazines maybe it's social media maybe it's your job maybe it's your business maybe it's whatever it is it could even be your family it could even be your church whatever it is if you're putting it before God he's going to come by and take a look and he's going to shake it up and say nope I'll be back around time to just go through this trial just a little longer just a little another round on the merry-go-round he says you load up and you're going to heaven you're going to take everything with you your card games huh every other thing that you can load into the church you're trying to take it with you God just condemns it ain't ready for sealing but here we go brothers and sisters this is where it gets hard or whether it gets good I don't know what it is I don't know where we're at today I can only follow leadership of the Lord like I said this this kind of blows my mind when he does it this way he goes on to say but when God sees a man contrite broken Spirit sincere in heart down at the altar God closes the door of the world to him and seals him in there by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I just can't and express the importance of that brothers and sisters how we need to be that that willing it doesn't matter who's looking it doesn't matter what's going on in our lives doesn't matter what we think or feel on our own we've got to be willing to get down to the altar to have an old-fashioned sin killing Revival we've got to be willing to have a contrite heart a broken spirit and until we're willing to get there God's going to just keep allowing the trials to keep squishing us and as long as we don't surrender Our Lives to his will that's what will happen but when God sees a man contrite broken Spirit sincere and heart down at the altar God closes the door of the world to him and seals him in there by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and here's the beautiful part for the sisters that are getting baptized today this is for you I would say and everyone else but I think it's so important to recognize it he seals him in there by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it lasts until Jesus comes not from one Revival to the other but until the day of your Redemption we're not up one day and down the next we're not saved today and lost tomorrow and maybe in between the week following brothers and sisters we've got reason to Rejoice if we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're sealed till the day of our Redemption and remember it's not because you don't have trials you're going to have trials the trials are coming our way and you know we were talking about this too I hope it's okay what it means to grow up in the message and be a message believer and and to actually not have maybe that that lightning bolt experience maybe like I can say that I had I came to a service on a Wednesday evening and I was an alcoholic and I was a smoker and I had all manner of other things going on in my life but I knew I hungered and I thirsted for righteousness and in a moment there was a lightning bolt and it was silent there was no sensation there was no lightning there was no Thunder there was nothing there was just a broken heart there was a contrite spirit there was one willing to be led by the holy ghost that said hey Lord if you're God I'll take you at your word be it unto me according to Thy word that's all it was and when that happened brothers and sisters it changed my life forever forever but when you grow up in the message and you're fed Eagles food all the time many times it can be very difficult to discern when that's happened in your life how how has my life changed I I haven't started smoking and quit smoking I haven't started drinking and quit drinking I haven't been out in the world carousing and then now I'm not carousing I I just have grown up and I've eaten this at the king's table every day of my life and that's all I know how do I know I've got the Holy Ghost can you receive the word for your day does it does it stir you does it make you say amen that's the evidence of it but you know the beautiful part brothers and sisters this is what I want to say Don't Be Afraid don't think that because you you go on and you get the Holy Ghost in your life that that's when the trials start even though they do start you know what's going to happen is everyone is going to have trials in their lives wouldn't it be good to have the Holy Ghost in your life for your trials wouldn't it be good to know that you have the Lord to back you up as the prophet for our day said that I've got all of Heaven backing waiting to back up my words when when she speaks he speaks he's just waiting with all of his millions and millions of angels for your voice the spoken word condition to hear us speak I I just think it's an incredible thought you know brothers and sisters we don't have to live in fear and think that just because we get the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's when our trials are going to start our trials actually are going to become Victorious at that point that's what's going to happen we're still going to have trials we've heard it said many times you're going to fight your way to go to heaven you're going to fight your way to go to hell you're going to fight every inch of the way in this life that's the way this life is created it's it's a battle God has created it and we know the battle started in heaven and it was between Lucifer and God Lucifer and Michael Lucifer and Jesus however you want to call it it started there but he's brought it down to earth to finish it and he's going to finish it in his bride his bride is going to be the one that will say be it unto me according to Thy word and not be shaken from it brother Branham says when that boxcar door is closed and the government seal put on it it cannot be open no more until it reaches its final destination and every man that's born again and sealed into the kingdom of God has no more desire of the world until the day Jesus Christ takes him into the kingdom isn't that wonderful to think about brothers and sisters you know we've said it many times and I want to say it again because we're all humans living in this flesh fighting the same enemy we're and then that enemy is ourselves remember we said it I think at the men's meeting we have a thorn in the flesh Paul had a thorn in the flesh but that thorn in our flesh is our flesh you can't see the real me and I can't see the real you this is just what we've been given to live in we've bypassed our theophonies we've come down here to be tried tested and proved that we truly are Sons and Daughters of God but when we're sealed into the kingdom of God we have no more desire of the world until the day Jesus Christ takes us into his kingdom right now we can look back in our lives even the kids that were raised in the message of the hour if you truly are baptized and you truly have an Earnest desire for the holy ghost in your life you might not be who you want to be that perfect image of your theophany and likely you never will be here on this side of Eternity but you can look back and say you know what some of those desires that I had in my life because of my Earnest desire to have a contrite heart and a broken spirit and willing to be led by the Holy Ghost because of that I can look back and say you know what I don't live like I used to those things that I used to desire I don't desire them anymore maybe I'm struggling right now but God's given me that struggle to prove himself through me so that he can see me as an overcomer and better yet brothers and sisters so that you can see you as an overcomer just like Abraham was given that test to bring Isaac to the top of the mountain it wasn't so God would know now I love you Abraham it was so that Abraham would know that I love God with all of my heart and I won't hold nothing back from him when that boxcar door is closed and the government seal is put on and it cannot be open no more until it reaches its final destination and every man that's born again and sealed into the kingdom of God has no more desire of the world until the day Jesus Christ takes him into the Kingdom so if you're having trouble and saying you got the Holy Ghost whether you belong to the Methodist Church the Baptist Church the Pentecostal Church you know what brother Barry's going to say Church whether you shouted spoke with tongues baptized forward backwards sprinkled if you're still having them kinds of troubles you'd better come back and check up on the load have a contrite heart have a broken Spirit be willing to be led of the Holy Ghost don't care who's looking around come to the altar just make it right with the Lord and He will meet you there brothers and sisters and you don't have to come here to the stairs and and and cry even though a new birth is a mess you can do it in your seat you can do it in your car you can do it in your house it doesn't matter where just do it get into the boat while there's still time whether you belong to the Methodist Church Baptist Church Pentecostal Church whether you shouted spoke with tongues baptized forwards backwards sprinkled if you're still having them kinds of troubles you'd better come back and check up the load that's right take too much with you it's too loose shaking God won't seal it that way we need to know that all that can be shaken will be shaken brothers and sisters and that's the age that we live in all that can be shaken will be shaken we need to make sure we recognize that that's why we have to be rooted and grounded in love got to make sure that we know where we stand that we're not pointing fingers at people we're pointing fingers at ourselves saying Lord help me feed unto me according to Thy word don't be it unto them according to Thy Word be it unto me why the contrite spirit out of the Seal of God he goes on to say what we need tonight is a lot of this here Hollywood evangelism choked down in an old-fashioned God sent Revival men and women who get down at the altar and quit this shaking hands and holding up hands and sprinkling them baptizing Face Forward backwards and all these other little forms and isms and get down to a real contrite broken Spirit where sin is he says mix that together and start an old-fashioned crying out of a newborn child amen he says that's the kind that gets the Holy Ghost that's right not the kind that says everything is all right and everything is perfect in my life and you know brothers and sisters I want to say this I don't want to make a Hollywood religion I don't want to make an act but what I do want to do is encourage every one of us to not worry about what anyone's thinking worry about what God's thinking because there's nothing that we hide from God and if we're not willing to make it right before God he will make sure that it is exposed before the sun before the sun it will be very much apparent what's going on in our lives if we're not willing to make it right he says that's the kind that gets the Holy Ghost that's right and I want to say this that's what children need to see children need to witness a new birth children don't need to witness formalism and starchiness I'm a Canadian like brother Cadre would say I'm a Canadian so I can't say Amen or I can't get excited about the word brothers and sisters if something like this word doesn't get us excited what's going to do it is it is it a sports game somewhere is it is it some kind of a a an entertainment somewhere that's going to get us excited we know brother Branham says this is the quietest place we're going to live I'm not looking for radicalism I'm not looking for people to put it on but what I am looking for is real we want to make sure that we're real be real don't worry about what anybody thinks brothers and sisters worry about what he thinks is our heart contrite is our heart right do we have a broken heart a broken humble spirit before God you know what if we do brothers and sisters we're going to have it before our brothers and our sisters we're not just gonna say I've got it and that's all we need to do no no no no no no no no we're actually gonna live it it's going to be displayed in our lives We're not gonna say oh that brother this or oh that sister that or oh brother Barry or whatever it is We're not gonna do that you know what that is brothers and sisters that's absalom's Camp that's the group of people that hung out with Absalom that had the Insurrection that wanted to come up and take the kingdom we know that Satan's kingdom Believers are going to say nope I don't believe that about that brother and I'm not even interested in talking about it because that brother's not that way I know that he actually didn't mean it even if he said it and the same thing with that sister because they're children of God they're Children of the most high God that's the Lord Jesus Christ bride and you know what happens when we do that brothers and sisters if that person is out of order if they really are truly pretending false pretending God will expose it won't he there'll be a shooting star they'll burn really bright and then they'll just disappear poof right but if they're truly a son and daughter of God oh my far be it for me for us to speak anything against them my goodness Brother Brad I'm talking about it he says mix that together start an old-fashioned crying out of a newborn child amen that's the kind that gets the Holy Ghost that's right no matter whether you're a Methodist Baptist or Catholic or whatever they are when they get before the Altar and cry day and night oh Lord look at the sins of this city my heart can't rest I can't rest Lord to see the things going on oh God do something how many people cry and sigh for the Abominations in the City of Calgary remember brother Branham talked about it looking over the City I believe of Phoenix Somewhere in Arizona I might be getting it wrong sitting up on the hill where the coyotes used to be looking down on the city and thinking about how many adulteries are going to be committed in that City that night how many people are going to go and drink strong drink in that City that night how many different sins how many times the name of the Lord is going to be taken in vain all of the sins in that City back in the 60s I think that was in 62 or three or later maybe 64-65 where are we at today brothers and sisters how much of that's going to happen here in this city tonight are we actually looking at this city and sighing and crying for the Abominations that are happening here bye brother Branham goes on to say send us an old-fashioned Revival you're on the borderline of getting the Holy Ghost then brother but if you walk up there because you've jumped up or down or because you've danced with the music or because you've done something else and walked around and blowing up and unconcerned and pouting and fussing and church joining and jumping from place to place it shows you never got nothing in the beginning he says brother that's good strong medicine but it'll sure fix you up that's right yes sir it'll bring you out without a feeble one among you brothers and sisters this morning I didn't want to really go this way with it but I just can't help but trust the Lord when he shows me things we want to make sure that we have the right Spirit we want to make sure that we're in our right position brothers and sisters going forwards and conquering the land like Joshua that's what we want to do but where are we at in our own personal lives are we Conquering the land according to the word as husbands should be in our home and wives are we Conquering the land according to the word in our home in our marriages children are we obeying our parents in our homes that's conquering our lands brothers and sisters we're not just looking for Devils to be slayed that will happen all that stuff just follows but getting into our position is really getting into our position according to the word and until we get into our position according to the word I don't know are we really in our position I don't think so I think we want to be you know brother Branham he says it if you've walked up there because you've jumped up or down I'm going to call the musicians and and close early today because we're going to baptize and and we got a service tonight but if you walk up there because you've jumped up or down or because you've danced with music or because you've done something else and walked around and blowing up and unconcerned and pouting and fussing I just can't help but think you know what the Lord he gave us the word to deal with things but people pout and people fuss Church joining and jumping from place to place it shows you never got nothing in the beginning brother that strong medicine but it'll sure fix you up we need to make sure brothers and sisters that we've got the right Spirit his spirit is going to be a contrite spirit it's going to be a broken heart it's going to be a heart that's willing to be led by the Lord by the Holy Ghost In Our Lives maybe stand with me this morning gracious Heavenly Father
