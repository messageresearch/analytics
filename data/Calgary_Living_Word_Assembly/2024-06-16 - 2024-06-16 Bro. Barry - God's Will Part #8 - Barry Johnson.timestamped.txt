[50:12] amen amen thank you musicians if you
[50:16] have your Bibles this morning I just
[50:18] would like to turn to the first Epistle
[50:21] of
[50:22] John chapter 2
[50:29] the first Epistle of John Chapter
[50:35] 2 I want to carry on with our our
[50:39] discussion about God's will today and uh
[50:42] maybe from a father's
[50:45] perspective it's kind of a special day
[50:47] today
[50:49] but first John chapter 2 we'll start
[50:52] reading with verse 12
[50:59] he says I write unto you little children
[51:02] because your sins are forgiven you for
[51:05] his name's
[51:06] sake imagine if we could just remember
[51:09] that in every single trial and every
[51:11] single struggle in every single
[51:13] situation that we go through every
[51:16] Temptation that the devil brings us your
[51:19] sins are forgiven you for his name's
[51:22] sake verse 13 I write unto you fathers
[51:26] because ye have known him that is from
[51:30] the beginning I write unto you young men
[51:33] because ye have overcome the wicked one
[51:36] I write unto you little children because
[51:39] ye have known the
[51:42] father I have written unto you fathers
[51:45] because ye have known him that is from
[51:48] the beginning he says that
[51:51] twice I have written unto you young men
[51:54] because ye are strong and the word word
[51:56] of God abideth in you and ye have
[52:00] overcome the wicked
[52:03] one love not the world neither the
[52:07] things that are in the world if any man
[52:10] love the world the love of the father is
[52:13] not in him for all that is in the world
[52:17] the lust of the Flesh and the lust of
[52:20] the eyes and the pride of life is not of
[52:24] the father but is of of the
[52:27] world and the world passeth away and the
[52:31] lust
[52:32] thereof my but he that doeth the will of
[52:38] God abideth
[52:41] forever let's just bow one more time
[52:44] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus this morning
[52:47] we just pray that you would break this
[52:49] bread of life open to us fresh once
[52:52] again father that we would recognize
[52:54] what you have already declared in your
[52:56] word about us that we would be able to
[52:59] just rest on that and father that we
[53:02] would be those Lord Jesus that abideth
[53:05] in you forever we just want to commit

[53:26] 10:00 a.m. that's postponed from when we
[53:29] had it booked last time we had uh bit of
[53:32] a situation with the water and you know
[53:35] I don't know what's going to happen
[53:36] because we might well still be under a
[53:38] water restriction we might have to just
[53:39] come and do what we can do uh maybe
[53:42] we'll bring some water we have the
[53:43] capacity to do that as well we'll just

[54:38] to attend are you happy this
[54:41] morning just want to say Happy Father's
[54:44] Day to all the fathers who are with
[54:47] us
[54:55] amen I believe it's probably one of the
[54:58] greatest
[55:00] uh one of the greatest honors there is
[55:03] on Earth is to be a
[55:05] father as well as be a mother I'm not
[55:08] discounting that but today is Father's
[55:10] day
[55:12] so it's a tremendous um opportunity it's
[55:16] a tremendous blessing it's a tremendous
[55:18] responsibility we know that many people
[55:21] can actually have children but not
[55:23] everyone can actually be a true father
[55:26] or or a true mother to their children
[55:28] and uh today is just a wonderful day and
[55:32] uh if you're listening Dad Happy
[55:33] Father's Day sure love you and uh just
[55:37] want to welcome all of our visitors we
[55:40] have a tremendous amount of visitors
[55:42] with us today um many of them from uh uh
[55:47] BC and from Edmonton God bless
[55:50] you uh we have uh sister Faith egg Manis
[55:54] family with us as well we just want to
[55:56] God bless you
[55:57] welcome and brother Tois so and sister
[56:00] Marian they wanted to express their
[56:02] gratitude for the outpouring of Love
[56:04] yesterday in the uh wedding reception
[56:06] that we had for them they just wanted to
[56:09] have a note for the uh local assembly
[56:11] and for all those people who came from
[56:12] afar to to make the effort to celebrate
[56:16] the the union the visible Union that the
[56:19] Lord has given them here on Earth
[56:22] certainly was a a wonderful day
[56:24] yesterday certainly enjoyed it and uh
[56:26] yeah we uh were happy to be here
[56:31] today I want to get into uh our
[56:33] scripture here a little bit just talking
[56:35] about God's Will and certainly thankful
[56:38] for the study that we've had so far it
[56:42] has been a real blessing to me um for
[56:46] those people who haven't been around
[56:47] we've been discussing uh God's Will and
[56:51] the importance of it and recognizing
[56:52] that God's will isn't all about the
[56:55] destination he his will is that all
[56:58] would prosper and be in good health but
[57:00] not everyone has the ability to actually
[57:02] do that because we could say we we can
[57:04] have good health we know brother Bram
[57:06] had many people come in the prayer line
[57:07] and they would get healed and then they
[57:09] would die tomorrow or they would die in
[57:11] a few months but the main thing the main
[57:14] theme was to actually be in good health
[57:17] spiritually to have our souls in the
[57:20] position that we need them to be to have
[57:23] the Seal of God inside of us but you
[57:26] know we've been talking about God's Will
[57:28] and and the importance of understanding
[57:30] it and that it's not necessarily a
[57:31] destination or an accomplishment even
[57:33] though it is we want everything that we
[57:36] do to be according to God's will we want
[57:38] it to be his will for our life but we we
[57:42] for those people who haven't been around
[57:43] I'll just do a quick little recap we had
[57:45] been talking about the the fact that I I
[57:49] had struggled for a while in my life to
[57:51] understand that God's will is his word
[57:52] we know it's a quote um brother bradam
[57:55] says it I'll be bringing it here um and
[57:57] maybe I should just bring it uh I'm
[58:00] going to have to it it'll come I've got
[58:03] it in here we uh I I just wanted to
[58:06] express this on on my heart I believe
[58:08] the Lord put it there to understand that
[58:10] God's will is his word and it's not
[58:12] necessarily an accomplishment or an
[58:14] achievement it's not a place that we go
[58:16] to necessarily it is realizing that his
[58:19] will is his word and everywhere we go
[58:21] and everything that we do his word needs
[58:24] to be Paramount if we keep his word out
[58:27] front of us then everything will work
[58:29] out to the good because we know the
[58:32] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[58:34] of the Lord a and all things work
[58:37] together for the good to those who are
[58:39] called according to his purpose and
[58:42] those people who are called according to
[58:43] his purpose are going to have the desire
[58:45] to express that DNA that we had talked
[58:47] about a little bit earlier we we we
[58:49] preached on a little while ago we could
[58:51] see Cain's DNA and it makes it so easy
[58:55] to see
[58:56] the the topic of serpent seed how Cain
[59:00] was of the wicked one his father was the
[59:04] devil now some people would say oh they
[59:07] had some kind of act in the garden did
[59:10] they what was it that happened in the
[59:12] garden we know what happened in the
[59:14] garden but why is it that they would try
[59:16] and say that some kind of fruit eating
[59:18] of the fruit would cause the downfall of
[59:21] mankind the fall of Man we know that it
[59:25] wasn't that and we could say that that
[59:27] there was an act or or something
[59:29] happened whether they ate fruit or or
[59:30] whether there was some sort of a
[59:31] relation we we know that there was some
[59:33] sort of an action but the first action
[59:36] and the worst action that ever could
[59:38] have taken place was to reject the word
[59:41] of God because anything outside of the
[59:44] word of God is actually going to be
[59:48] false it's going to be death one word
[59:51] off is Satan's Eden it's not the Garden
[59:54] of Eden talk talking about our scripture
[59:56] today I just think it's so beautiful if
[59:58] we could just dwell on this for a little
[1:00:00] bit out of the first Epistle of John
[1:00:03] Chapter 2 I write unto you little
[1:00:04] children because your sins are forgiven
[1:00:06] you for his name's sake they're already
[1:00:08] done they're already forgiven all we
[1:00:10] have to do is accept
[1:00:12] it talks to the
[1:00:15] fathers and and and says I write unto
[1:00:19] you fathers because ye have known him
[1:00:21] that is from the beginning I write unto
[1:00:24] you young men because ye have overcome
[1:00:26] the wicked one I write unto you little
[1:00:28] children because ye have known the
[1:00:30] father all of these are past tense
[1:00:34] phrases ye have known the father your
[1:00:37] sins are forgiven you you've overcome
[1:00:40] the wicked one amen I want to ask a
[1:00:43] question how many people here this
[1:00:44] morning and I'm asking for a hand raise
[1:00:46] how many people feel like they've
[1:00:48] overcome the wicked
[1:00:51] one there's a few hands but not every
[1:00:54] hand
[1:00:56] because we can't rely on our feelings if
[1:00:59] we say I feel like I've overcome I don't
[1:01:01] know I I would kind of want to say have
[1:01:04] you because our feelings get in the way
[1:01:07] but you know what the prophet said that
[1:01:08] our feelings have nothing to do with it
[1:01:12] the baptism of the holy spirit is
[1:01:13] without sensation brothers and sisters
[1:01:15] it just is and when we follow the word
[1:01:18] of God God does the work in fact God's
[1:01:22] already done the work alls we do is
[1:01:24] accept the fact that he
[1:01:26] has I've written unto you fathers
[1:01:29] because ye have known him that is from
[1:01:31] the
[1:01:31] beginning I have written unto you young
[1:01:34] men because ye are strong you are strong
[1:01:38] you don't have to feel weak Satan's
[1:01:41] going to say you're weak Satan's going
[1:01:44] to say that you can't overcome but if
[1:01:46] you say nope I take the word of God over
[1:01:48] every single symptom over every single
[1:01:50] feeling over every single circumstance
[1:01:53] you've already
[1:01:54] overcome Satan's already already
[1:01:57] defeated and the interesting thing is he
[1:02:00] knows it he knows it but do we know
[1:02:05] it love not the world neither the things
[1:02:08] that are in the
[1:02:09] world this is tough because there's
[1:02:12] things in this world that are
[1:02:15] enjoyable but put the word first
[1:02:17] brothers and sisters in every
[1:02:19] situation and you know the the things of
[1:02:21] this world will grow strangely dim
[1:02:26] how in the light of his glory and his
[1:02:30] grace when we esteem him above
[1:02:32] everything else in our lives we'll come
[1:02:35] to the place where we won't love the
[1:02:36] things of this
[1:02:38] world nor the things that are in the
[1:02:40] world but we know the word says if any
[1:02:42] man love the world the love of the
[1:02:43] father is not in him and you know how
[1:02:46] would we identify that I'm just going to
[1:02:49] talk about his word today it's going to
[1:02:51] be about his word and that is his will
[1:02:53] but today brothers and sisters if we put
[1:02:56] anything in our life before the word
[1:02:59] guess what there we are what we're doing
[1:03:02] is we're actually loving the world
[1:03:05] anything in front of his word we know
[1:03:07] it's idolatry but I want to say verse 15
[1:03:10] says love not the world neither the
[1:03:11] things that are in the world if any man
[1:03:13] loved the world oh my the love of the
[1:03:15] father is not in
[1:03:17] him
[1:03:19] remember Eve in the Garden of Eden she
[1:03:22] loved the father didn't she but was the
[1:03:25] love of the father in her because she
[1:03:29] took one word
[1:03:31] deviation and what happened it put us
[1:03:34] where we are
[1:03:35] today verse 16 for all that is in the
[1:03:38] world the lust of the flesh the lust of
[1:03:40] the eyes and the pride of life is not of
[1:03:42] the father but is of the world and you
[1:03:44] know he says the very next verse 17 and
[1:03:48] the world passeth away the lust of the
[1:03:51] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[1:03:53] of life the images that we get in our
[1:03:56] minds about ourselves about other people
[1:03:58] about other circumstances they're all
[1:04:00] going to pass away brothers and sisters
[1:04:03] all of them but he that doeth the will
[1:04:06] of God abideth
[1:04:09] forever what's the will of God his
[1:04:13] word his word it's such a beautiful
[1:04:16] thing it it just really became so
[1:04:18] apparent to me I had this question in my
[1:04:21] mind and and I know my pastor he said it
[1:04:23] to me when I was younger um God's will
[1:04:26] is his word it was a direct quote from
[1:04:27] the prophet we'll get into it and and it
[1:04:29] just made me think how it's such a vague
[1:04:32] statement how can it be I I just need an
[1:04:35] answer Lord I don't understand this can
[1:04:37] you please tell me and it was probably a
[1:04:39] couple of years three years later the
[1:04:41] Lord finally came around and said you
[1:04:43] want an answer and it was that plain I
[1:04:45] was driving one day so you want an
[1:04:46] answer to your question and I'm thinking
[1:04:49] what I'm not hearing an audible voice if
[1:04:51] you've ever heard God speak to you you
[1:04:53] know what I mean so you want an ask
[1:04:55] answer to your question I was like okay
[1:04:58] when I got over myself I said okay this
[1:05:00] must be God okay sure I'd love an answer
[1:05:02] that'd be wonderful he said okay God's
[1:05:05] will is his word take a look at Joseph
[1:05:07] take a look at Joseph's life every step
[1:05:09] of the way that Joseph went he was in
[1:05:11] God's
[1:05:12] will he didn't deviate from the word of
[1:05:14] God take a look and and I I I thought my
[1:05:17] really I need to study this out so I
[1:05:20] went and started to look at it and then
[1:05:22] he said you know what I know that you
[1:05:23] don't want just one you want two you
[1:05:25] want two two scriptural
[1:05:27] identifications and I said yeah you know
[1:05:29] me and and what did he say he said look
[1:05:31] at Daniel Daniel's life the story of
[1:05:34] Daniel he he was carried away into
[1:05:37] bondage we'll get into all of this as we
[1:05:38] go but both of them through tremendous
[1:05:42] trials and circumstances in their life
[1:05:44] never one time deviated from the word of
[1:05:47] God they followed their teachings and
[1:05:51] what did God do he blessed their way oh
[1:05:54] my but they went through the Press
[1:05:55] didn't they they went through the trial
[1:05:58] they went through the tribulation if
[1:05:59] anyone had reason to maybe get a little
[1:06:02] upset with God to think why am I here he
[1:06:06] was Joseph was the one with the coat of
[1:06:08] many colors and he found himself thrown
[1:06:10] into a pit abandoned by his
[1:06:14] brothers what a terrible feeling that
[1:06:16] must have been did he hear his brother
[1:06:18] say go home and tell Daddy that a wild
[1:06:20] animal killed him will soak his coat in
[1:06:22] blood can you imagine being in the pit
[1:06:26] of despair literally thinking no
[1:06:28] thoughts now everyone's going to think
[1:06:30] that I'm dead what's going to happen to
[1:06:31] me then to be sold into
[1:06:35] slavery but to never give up on
[1:06:39] God and we know the story very well he
[1:06:42] he he went down into P Piper's house and
[1:06:45] was wrongly accused and then he was
[1:06:47] thrown in jail and even while he was in
[1:06:51] jail what happened he kept God first
[1:06:56] no doubt he had prayer meetings
[1:06:58] there no doubt he had Services
[1:07:01] there and what happened God blessed them
[1:07:04] God blessed the prison for his
[1:07:08] sake and God allowed that prisoner to
[1:07:11] become the head of the prison where does
[1:07:13] that
[1:07:14] happen all we know the stories I'm I'm
[1:07:17] I'm getting way ahead of myself here I
[1:07:19] I'm just fascinated with this first John
[1:07:22] chapter 2 and and how the world passes
[1:07:25] away and the lust thereof but he that
[1:07:29] doeth the will of God abideth forever
[1:07:33] what is the will of God brothers and
[1:07:35] sisters it's his word it's keeping his
[1:07:36] word first and Paramount in our lives
[1:07:40] and what truly is the word for our day
[1:07:42] now we can go a little bit further with
[1:07:44] that what was the word for the day in in
[1:07:46] the day of
[1:07:48] Jeremiah it was the prophet word it was
[1:07:51] the word from the prophet God only
[1:07:53] speaks to people through the prophets
[1:07:55] and what is it today it's through the
[1:07:58] prophet but the whole world is against
[1:08:00] it you know the word Prophet doesn't
[1:08:03] have to be scary I was thinking about it
[1:08:05] this morning when I was meditating I had
[1:08:07] to go through this myself when I first
[1:08:09] started coming around to church here
[1:08:11] because I kept hearing the word Prophet
[1:08:12] prophet and I thought I was like why
[1:08:14] does everybody have to talk about the
[1:08:15] prophet Prophet Prophet why do they do
[1:08:17] that they worship a man clearly
[1:08:20] right but if you just look up the
[1:08:22] definition of prophet it's a messenger
[1:08:25] that's what prophet means we're going to
[1:08:28] get into it you know what the word of
[1:08:29] God says to watch out for false
[1:08:32] prophets the word says
[1:08:35] that but what does it say it doesn't say
[1:08:37] watch out for prophets it says false
[1:08:41] prophets and how would we ever know if a
[1:08:43] prophet is real or false true or false
[1:08:48] there has to be an
[1:08:49] answer the prophet from God is only
[1:08:52] going to say what's already been said
[1:08:59] the one that we should watch out for is
[1:09:01] going to have some new spin some new
[1:09:03] doctrine some kind of edge that nobody
[1:09:05] else has heard
[1:09:07] about but you know what if we're not
[1:09:09] willing to actually look at it then how
[1:09:10] will we ever get it I know I'm preaching
[1:09:12] to the choir and I don't mean
[1:09:14] to this uh this scripture really it just
[1:09:19] it just inspired me today as you can
[1:09:20] tell you know as fathers being Father's
[1:09:22] Day what kind of an example did uh I
[1:09:25] just can't help but think what kind of
[1:09:26] an example did did did Joseph and Daniel
[1:09:30] receive from their fathers what kind of
[1:09:34] examples were held before them when they
[1:09:36] were taken out of their lives taken
[1:09:39] right out of their their way and put
[1:09:41] into the most adverse
[1:09:44] circumstances they still wanted to serve
[1:09:47] God many times we can have children who
[1:09:50] are not in adverse circumstances or
[1:09:53] situations who are in the mid of
[1:09:56] actually maybe a good word-based church
[1:09:58] but yet the children run away what's up
[1:10:01] with
[1:10:03] that brothers and sisters as Fathers as
[1:10:06] parents mothers and fathers we have a
[1:10:08] tremendous responsibility the children
[1:10:10] have got to see the representation of
[1:10:14] God in their life they need to see daddy
[1:10:17] in the word daddy who esteems the will
[1:10:20] of God greater than anything in his life
[1:10:23] amen that's the reason why Joseph and
[1:10:25] Daniel were able to do that we know we
[1:10:27] can say that you know if you're called
[1:10:29] by God if you have his spiritual DNA
[1:10:31] then nothing is going to harm you truly
[1:10:34] nothing is going to harm your
[1:10:37] soul but you know what if you actually
[1:10:39] are a true son and daughter of God
[1:10:41] brother bradam says it in a quote I'm
[1:10:42] going to get to here brother bradam says
[1:10:44] it that if you truly are a son and
[1:10:46] daughter of God if you fail to actually
[1:10:49] heed his calling he will make sure that
[1:10:52] you call come to his call he won't leave
[1:10:55] us he won't never ever leave us nor
[1:10:58] forsake
[1:10:59] us but uh I just wanted to read this
[1:11:01] first John chapter 2: 13-1 17 out of the
[1:11:06] Amplified Bible this morning and just
[1:11:09] for the record I'm not promoting another
[1:11:10] version of the Bible what I'm doing is
[1:11:12] just trying to shed a little light to
[1:11:13] have a little bit of a different
[1:11:15] perspective on the very same scripture
[1:11:17] just to expound upon it a little bit uh
[1:11:20] uh verse 13 says I'm writing to you
[1:11:22] fathers because you know because sorry
[1:11:25] I'm writing to you fathers because you
[1:11:28] have come to know recognize be aware of
[1:11:32] and understand him who has existed from
[1:11:36] the beginning how would we ever do that
[1:11:40] outside of the message from a Vindicated
[1:11:43] Prophet the message of God from a
[1:11:44] Vindicated Prophet how we ever get to
[1:11:46] that there's Revelation I'm sure that we
[1:11:48] would get that I'll carry on here he
[1:11:51] says I am writing to you young men
[1:11:53] because you have being Victorious over
[1:11:56] the wicked one don't put this out there
[1:12:00] and say that this is going to be someday
[1:12:02] I'm going to be victorious the word of
[1:12:03] God says that you are right now already
[1:12:07] Victorious the devil wants you to
[1:12:09] believe yeah when you can overcome this
[1:12:10] one thing yeah when you can overcome the
[1:12:12] other thing yeah when you get better at
[1:12:13] this and and you're no longer tempted by
[1:12:15] that brothers and sisters don't look at
[1:12:17] the problem if you look at the problem
[1:12:19] you're going to have a problem look at
[1:12:21] the end remember the child riding the
[1:12:23] Schwin bicycle everyone else who was the
[1:12:26] really good Riders brother Bram said
[1:12:28] they were riding Uptown Vancouver right
[1:12:30] they were riding their bikes with no
[1:12:32] hands going to get Mama groceries with
[1:12:34] no hands steering the bike they're just
[1:12:36] riding anybody ever ridden with no hands
[1:12:39] on a bike it takes a bit of balance but
[1:12:41] they were doing that but yet when they
[1:12:43] got on that narrow walk they couldn't do
[1:12:46] it they fell off why was it because they
[1:12:48] were looking down is what that kid said
[1:12:50] he saw what they were doing they were
[1:12:52] watching close don't watch close don't
[1:12:54] look at your circumstances or your
[1:12:56] situation look at the end
[1:12:58] goal look at the end
[1:13:01] game I'm writing to your fathers because
[1:13:04] you have overcome you have sorry because
[1:13:07] you have come to know recognize be aware
[1:13:10] of and understand him who has existed
[1:13:12] from the beginning I'm writing to you
[1:13:13] young men because you have been
[1:13:15] Victorious over the wicked one I write
[1:13:18] to you boys Lads because you have come
[1:13:21] to know recognize and be aware of the
[1:13:24] father
[1:13:25] I write to you fathers because you have
[1:13:28] come to know recognize be conscious of
[1:13:31] and understand him who has existed from
[1:13:34] the beginning I write to you young men
[1:13:36] because you are strong and vigorous and
[1:13:40] the word of God is always abiding in you
[1:13:44] in your hearts and you have been
[1:13:47] Victorious over the wicked one do not
[1:13:50] love or cherish the world or things that
[1:13:52] are in the world if anyone loves the
[1:13:55] world love for the father is not in him
[1:13:59] you can't serve God and Mammon at the
[1:14:01] same
[1:14:02] time for all that is in the world the
[1:14:05] lust of the flesh craving for sensual
[1:14:08] gratification and the lust of the eyes
[1:14:10] greedy longings of the
[1:14:14] mind and the pride of
[1:14:16] life Assurance in one's own resources or
[1:14:20] in the stability of Earthly things my
[1:14:23] look at the Kingdom that I've made in
[1:14:25] I I've made it look at the Kingdom that
[1:14:27] I've created look at how good I am how
[1:14:30] much of a a tremendous father I am you
[1:14:33] know brothers and sisters carefully we
[1:14:35] need to just really make sure that we're
[1:14:37] we're speaking clearly we can say look
[1:14:39] at how good of a religious example that
[1:14:42] I am to my family you know the worst
[1:14:45] spirit is a religious
[1:14:47] spirit the word of God says to humble
[1:14:49] yourself in the sight of the Lord and
[1:14:51] how do we do that one to another come to
[1:14:55] church is not humbling yourself in the
[1:14:57] sight of the Lord brothers and sisters
[1:14:59] coming to church is coming to church
[1:15:01] everyone comes to church polished up
[1:15:04] we've talked about in the past how the
[1:15:05] young people can look at the elders and
[1:15:06] think there's nothing wrong in their
[1:15:08] lives they don't have any struggles but
[1:15:10] you know what they're the battle scarred
[1:15:12] Veterans of this word they're the ones
[1:15:14] that know how to get through the trials
[1:15:16] and how do you get through the trials
[1:15:17] you get back
[1:15:19] up it's a pretty simple thing
[1:15:25] the pride of life the Assurance in one's
[1:15:28] own resources or in the stability of
[1:15:32] Earthly
[1:15:33] things these do not come from the father
[1:15:37] but are from the world itself and you
[1:15:39] know we talked last time about the image
[1:15:42] not the image of Nebuchadnezzar but the
[1:15:45] image that Nebuchadnezzar had made for
[1:15:48] Daniel the one that he recognized the
[1:15:52] the spirit of spirits of the Gods
[1:15:55] resided in him he had the ability to not
[1:15:57] only interpret a dream but to actually
[1:15:59] tell the dream
[1:16:01] first and nobody else could do that but
[1:16:05] the image how we can have an image
[1:16:07] there's never been an age with with such
[1:16:10] a tremendous push on image on what it
[1:16:13] means to have an image in this world you
[1:16:16] know if that's the case it's of the
[1:16:18] world brothers and sisters and you know
[1:16:20] the world passes away and disappears and
[1:16:23] and we know that the image of of Daniel
[1:16:25] did the very same thing verse 17 out of
[1:16:29] the Amplified Bible says and the world
[1:16:31] passes away and disappears and with it
[1:16:34] the Forbidden Cravings the passionate
[1:16:36] desires the lust of it but he who does
[1:16:40] the will of God and carries out his
[1:16:43] purposes in his life abides remains
[1:16:47] forever amen I just think it's so
[1:16:50] wonderful his will is his word no matter
[1:16:52] where we're at no matter what we're
[1:16:54] going through no matter who we're going
[1:16:55] through it with and what it's for keep
[1:16:59] God first brothers and
[1:17:00] sisters keep him first and even if you
[1:17:04] find yourself in his permissive will we
[1:17:06] know the prophet said that he'll take
[1:17:08] that permissive will and he'll make it
[1:17:09] his perfect will every single time out
[1:17:13] of out of the power of
[1:17:16] transformation brother Bram talking
[1:17:19] about Cain we had mentioned Eve already
[1:17:22] missing one word being one word off
[1:17:25] paragraph 246 he says he Cain knew the
[1:17:29] perfect will of
[1:17:31] God can you imagine
[1:17:34] that he knew the perfect will of God
[1:17:37] Cain knew
[1:17:38] it why but he just refused to do
[1:17:43] it and we know that in the
[1:17:47] garden all he had to do was what God
[1:17:50] instructed him to do he didn't want to
[1:17:53] do it but God even came came around and
[1:17:55] said hey if you just do like your
[1:17:57] brother just just do like him you you'll
[1:18:00] be
[1:18:01] accepted there was something inside his
[1:18:03] heart to say no no no no no no no no you
[1:18:05] don't see you don't see it man I I I've
[1:18:07] got an image I've got an image to
[1:18:09] protect here now I'm not going backwards
[1:18:12] on my
[1:18:13] stand pride is a terrible sin and we
[1:18:16] know that was exactly what his father
[1:18:19] had in heaven
[1:18:22] right brother Adam says he K knew the
[1:18:24] perfect will of God he
[1:18:26] knew he knew the perfect will of God
[1:18:29] Cain knew it why but he refused to do it
[1:18:31] he proved then to be the Serpent's Seed
[1:18:35] because of the DNA because of the life
[1:18:37] that he lived it demonstrates who we are
[1:18:40] brothers and sisters we can say all we
[1:18:42] want but the life we live is going to
[1:18:44] demonstrate who's our father but he
[1:18:47] refused to do it he proved then to be
[1:18:50] the Serpent's Seed when he seen the
[1:18:53] perfect will of God he refused it he had
[1:18:58] seen God vindicate Abel's message oh my
[1:19:01] and it just got him so upset didn't it
[1:19:04] look it he came and appreciated Abel he
[1:19:07] didn't appreciate me and what happened
[1:19:08] the word of God says his countenance
[1:19:10] fell and God called him out on it said
[1:19:13] what's your problem boy why is your
[1:19:16] countenance
[1:19:18] down he seen God vindicate Abel's
[1:19:21] message and what did God say to him and
[1:19:24] he just he said do the same do worship
[1:19:29] like your brother and you'll do
[1:19:32] well but you see he seen the perfect
[1:19:35] will of God but he didn't want to do it
[1:19:37] see he wanted to add something to it and
[1:19:40] these theologians see this Bible they
[1:19:43] read it but they don't want to do
[1:19:45] it
[1:19:48] my just going to let that soak for a
[1:19:51] little bit because brothers and sisters
[1:19:53] whether we go to a Bible school or or
[1:19:56] whether we have the message search on
[1:19:57] our phone whether we know the message
[1:19:59] for decades and decades and decades if
[1:20:02] we're not willing to actually do the
[1:20:04] word of God according to the message of
[1:20:06] the
[1:20:10] hour who's our
[1:20:13] father we certainly want to encourage
[1:20:15] everyone to do the will of the father we
[1:20:18] would that everyone would come you know
[1:20:20] brother bradam said my my objective is
[1:20:22] to take as many people with me as I can
[1:20:24] and that's what we want to do but the
[1:20:25] only way we're going to go is to do the
[1:20:27] will of the father because everything
[1:20:30] else in this world's going to pass
[1:20:32] away if you would just do like your
[1:20:34] brother and and you'd do well but you
[1:20:36] see he seen the perfect will of God but
[1:20:38] he didn't want it see he wanted to add
[1:20:41] something to it he wanted to Worship in
[1:20:43] his own
[1:20:44] way the prophet of God gave us a very
[1:20:47] specific direction for our day and for
[1:20:50] us to refuse that brothers and sisters I
[1:20:52] want to make this super clear crystal
[1:20:54] CLE clear I'll probably say it a couple
[1:20:55] times there's no no no no way that we
[1:20:58] can just be Lolly gagging around with
[1:21:01] this message of the hour this is time to
[1:21:03] preach fire and brimstone brothers and
[1:21:05] sisters it's life or it's death it's not
[1:21:07] time to play to reject one word of the
[1:21:10] messenger one word of the message of the
[1:21:12] hour isn't to reject the messenger and
[1:21:15] sometimes you see people they feel like
[1:21:17] maybe they can do that that's actually
[1:21:18] not rejecting the messenger that's
[1:21:20] rejecting God you're not rejecting the
[1:21:23] message you're re ing
[1:21:26] God we heard it on Wednesday with
[1:21:28] brother Jack it was so good those seven
[1:21:30] Church age Messengers when they came if
[1:21:32] you receive their message you receive
[1:21:34] God but to reject them you reject
[1:21:39] God there's no fooling around
[1:21:42] here one of these days the church is
[1:21:45] going to be
[1:21:47] gone and we know that there's probably
[1:21:50] call it two churches we'll say that
[1:21:52] there's one Capital CCH church and
[1:21:55] there's one little sea church one one
[1:21:58] church has enough oil for the journey
[1:22:00] and the other church just has oil but
[1:22:03] just not enough oil because when the
[1:22:05] shout comes forward to say that the
[1:22:07] bridegroom has come rise and trim your
[1:22:09] lamps oh my all 10 versions rise up and
[1:22:12] trim their lamps try to get them going
[1:22:14] but the the the five they recognize oh
[1:22:17] no I can't get my lamp going I can't get
[1:22:20] that flame up a little higher to make it
[1:22:22] nice and bright what's going on I don't
[1:22:24] have have any
[1:22:25] oil that's why we want the Holy Ghost
[1:22:28] the oil in the lamp typifies the Holy
[1:22:30] Ghost brothers and
[1:22:33] sisters and these theologians paragraph
[1:22:36] 247 see this Bible they read
[1:22:39] it but they don't want to do
[1:22:44] it and that's why I think it's so good
[1:22:46] with the message of the hour because the
[1:22:47] message isn't a new message the message
[1:22:50] actually just ties up the Loose Ends
[1:22:51] that are in the Bible the message of the
[1:22:53] hour points back to the King James
[1:22:56] version
[1:22:57] Bible Well you get these theologians
[1:23:00] they see they see this Bible they read
[1:23:03] it but they don't want to do it see oh
[1:23:06] my it shows their serpent seed otherwise
[1:23:10] they would want to do
[1:23:15] it they've seen it Vindicated and so
[1:23:18] simply before the people but it seems
[1:23:20] like it's so hard for people to Humble
[1:23:23] themselves to the word of
[1:23:26] God wear what wear a
[1:23:30] skirt don't cut your hair
[1:23:33] ever
[1:23:37] 10% my all these
[1:23:40] things all these different things that
[1:23:42] we know we've we've seen come in our
[1:23:44] day what is God's will it's his word
[1:23:49] brother Bram he says let me give you
[1:23:50] something a little shocking sorry this
[1:23:52] is out of one in a million let me give
[1:23:54] you something a little shocking see not
[1:23:56] all that says unto me Lord Lord will
[1:23:59] enter in but the one that doeth the will
[1:24:03] of my father amen his will is his word
[1:24:07] period his will is his
[1:24:10] word we can be ever so
[1:24:14] religious have great shouting times
[1:24:17] great times shouting jumping in these
[1:24:20] meetings which I I don't want to be
[1:24:22] critical but I have a duty to God and
[1:24:25] that duty is to be
[1:24:27] sincere and to say what he wants me to
[1:24:30] say and and I want to say this any
[1:24:33] Minister sitting standing behind a
[1:24:35] Pulpit according to the message of the
[1:24:37] hour any Minister standing behind a
[1:24:39] Pulpit they have to be sincere and they
[1:24:42] ought to say what the prophet
[1:24:46] said it's
[1:24:48] vital I just love that let me give you
[1:24:50] something a little bit
[1:24:52] shocking isn't it interesting to think
[1:24:54] that there's going to be people that
[1:24:55] will be there that day and say didn't we
[1:24:57] have a tremendous outpouring of the
[1:24:58] spirit we cast out
[1:25:01] Devils we raised the dead we saw people
[1:25:05] who were sick
[1:25:07] healed remember Judas had a Ministry
[1:25:11] just like
[1:25:13] that but Judas wasn't one of the 12 was
[1:25:17] he he he was given
[1:25:20] power my goodness we uh we we were
[1:25:24] getting into into this real strong in
[1:25:25] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:25:27] but you know it's all about instruction
[1:25:29] isn't it brothers and sisters it's all
[1:25:31] about training up the children in the
[1:25:32] way they should go and you know in the
[1:25:34] book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy chapter
[1:25:36] 4 verse 9 it says only take heed to
[1:25:41] thyself and keep thy Soul
[1:25:45] diligently lest thou forget the things
[1:25:47] which thine eyes have seen and lest they
[1:25:50] depart from thy heart all the days of
[1:25:52] thy life
[1:25:54] but teach them thy sons and thy Sons
[1:26:00] Sons such a beautiful thing isn't it
[1:26:02] when you're a father you don't stop
[1:26:03] being a father when your children grow
[1:26:05] up and and move out of your house you're
[1:26:08] still a father when you're a grandfather
[1:26:10] you're just a better father because you
[1:26:13] don't have to worry about the correction
[1:26:14] all you have to do is encourage at that
[1:26:16] point and and it's such a beautiful
[1:26:19] thing because sometimes a grandfather
[1:26:21] can see things that a father can't but
[1:26:23] this Deuter omy 4:9 only take heed to
[1:26:26] thyself and keep thy Soul diligently
[1:26:29] lest thou forget the things which thine
[1:26:31] eyes have seen and lest they depart from
[1:26:33] thine heart all the days of thy life but
[1:26:35] teach them thy sons and thy son's Sons
[1:26:38] especially the day that thou stood us
[1:26:41] before the Lord thy God in Horeb when
[1:26:43] the Lord said unto me gather me the
[1:26:46] people together and I will make them
[1:26:49] hear my words that they may learn to
[1:26:52] fear me all the days that they shall
[1:26:54] live upon the Earth and that they may
[1:26:57] teach their
[1:26:59] children it's beautiful because you have
[1:27:01] two people speaking here but one message
[1:27:04] isn't that true God ministering through
[1:27:08] his Prophet to the
[1:27:10] people the minister being the prophet is
[1:27:13] just bringing what the Lord has told him
[1:27:15] that they should teach their children in
[1:27:17] Proverbs 22:6 train up a child in the
[1:27:20] way he should go and when he is old he
[1:27:23] will not apart from it and you know
[1:27:25] brothers and sisters that scripture is
[1:27:27] so prevalent it's such a good one we
[1:27:30] worry many times about our children and
[1:27:33] uh how children can actually be a little
[1:27:35] bit Wayward we don't need to worry about
[1:27:37] them commit them to the Lord trust in
[1:27:39] the Lord with all your heart make sure
[1:27:42] that you train them up in the way they
[1:27:43] should go don't give them a double
[1:27:45] standard don't let them see a different
[1:27:47] daddy at home than they see at church
[1:27:50] don't let them see a different daddy in
[1:27:52] the car than they would see at church
[1:27:54] make sure that our yay is yay and our
[1:27:57] nay
[1:27:59] nay we can preach the message all we
[1:28:01] want but if the children see a different
[1:28:03] personality guess what it's a mixed
[1:28:05] signal and they're going to think my my
[1:28:07] my I don't know how I can ever do that I
[1:28:09] don't ever want to do that why would I
[1:28:10] want to do that we need to make sure
[1:28:12] that we have the same
[1:28:17] message Naturally
[1:28:20] Speaking brothers and sisters
[1:28:23] children specifically to the children
[1:28:26] there's always going to be a guy there's
[1:28:29] always going to be that guy no matter
[1:28:30] where it is we
[1:28:32] go isn't
[1:28:34] it he's going to be in our school he'll
[1:28:37] be in our
[1:28:39] class he'll be on the
[1:28:41] bus we could find him maybe as a boss or
[1:28:46] a teacher maybe as a neighbor and what I
[1:28:50] mean by the guy is the guy that just
[1:28:53] says stuff that just totally gets under
[1:28:55] our
[1:28:56] skin there's going to be a guy maybe
[1:28:58] it'll be a girl maybe it'll be a woman
[1:29:01] there's going to be a person in our life
[1:29:03] that's always going to grind on us and
[1:29:05] rub us the wrong way a and if you've
[1:29:08] lived you know what I'm talking about
[1:29:10] but you know what brothers and sisters
[1:29:12] you got to overcome that you got to be
[1:29:14] able to look beyond that personality
[1:29:17] trait and see what the main objective is
[1:29:21] that might be a person that's actually a
[1:29:23] son and daughter of God
[1:29:25] and you know naturally speaking in the
[1:29:27] world we have to contend with people
[1:29:29] like that we have to contend with some
[1:29:31] very abrasive people in our jobs our
[1:29:33] careers our schooling maybe even in our
[1:29:35] families
[1:29:38] amen um but what about
[1:29:44] church many times we can bear with
[1:29:46] people tremendously in a
[1:29:48] job oh my but at church oo nope not
[1:29:53] going to church I'm going to stay home
[1:29:55] and play tapes because of that brother
[1:29:57] because of that sister because of that
[1:29:58] song leader because of this because of
[1:30:00] that because of the other God's not
[1:30:02] going to say oh because of that that's
[1:30:03] okay you didn't have to actually follow
[1:30:05] my word knowing that my word is my will
[1:30:07] you don't worry about it it's okay we'll
[1:30:09] just make it no no no no no it's not
[1:30:11] that way his word is his will we've got
[1:30:14] to follow his
[1:30:15] word you know brother bradam said the
[1:30:18] reason I'm saying this is I want to get
[1:30:19] to this point brother bradam he said it
[1:30:20] very clearly in the exposition of the
[1:30:22] seven Church ages in the Ephesian Church
[1:30:23] age and brother Jack read it I believe
[1:30:25] on Wednesday he he said maybe he didn't
[1:30:28] somebody did never let anything get
[1:30:30] between you and that word amen and when
[1:30:34] we let a situation or an issue stop us
[1:30:38] from coming together to worship the
[1:30:40] Living God we've let something get
[1:30:42] between us and that
[1:30:45] word and you know what that is that gets
[1:30:48] between you and that word brothers and
[1:30:50] sisters the devil wants us to say oh
[1:30:53] it's that
[1:30:54] it's that thing it's that thing look at
[1:30:56] that thing that thing's in the way we
[1:30:59] can't go and worship because of that
[1:31:00] thing you know what it is it's not that
[1:31:02] thing it's the
[1:31:04] devil it's just the devil and he's going
[1:31:07] to masquerade and hide behind a
[1:31:09] circumstance or a situation and we're
[1:31:11] going to say well it's this or it's that
[1:31:14] it's not that it's the devil we just
[1:31:17] need to recognize that never ever let
[1:31:20] anything get between you and that word
[1:31:23] word
[1:31:25] never Matthew
[1:31:28] 7:3 enter ye in at the Straight Gate for
[1:31:31] wide is the gate and Broad is the way
[1:31:34] that leadth to destruction and many
[1:31:36] there will be which go in there at
[1:31:40] because straight is the gate and narrow
[1:31:42] is the way which leadth unto life and
[1:31:45] few there will be that find it now this
[1:31:48] is what we talked about a little bit
[1:31:50] earlier I jumped ahead of myself but
[1:31:52] beware beware brothers and sisters be
[1:31:55] careful be very aware of your
[1:31:57] surroundings and your environment
[1:31:59] because there's going to be false
[1:32:01] prophets beware of false prophets which
[1:32:04] come to you in sheep's clothing my but
[1:32:08] inwardly they are ravening wolves and
[1:32:12] you know brothers and sisters I
[1:32:13] personally think this this is just me my
[1:32:15] personal thoughts I just want to let you
[1:32:17] know that I'm not trying to come down on
[1:32:19] anybody or or any Ministry out there I I
[1:32:22] personally believe that some of these
[1:32:24] people they don't even recognize that
[1:32:26] they truly mean weal they truly mean to
[1:32:29] bring the word of God they truly mean to
[1:32:32] encourage people to Christ and they
[1:32:33] don't even recognize where they stand
[1:32:36] they don't recognize the spirit that's
[1:32:37] actually influencing them beware of
[1:32:40] false prophets how are we going to be
[1:32:42] able to know whether they're false
[1:32:43] prophet or not you got to know the word
[1:32:44] of God and you know there's one thing to
[1:32:47] know the word of God to know chapter and
[1:32:48] verse but it's another thing altogether
[1:32:50] to know the
[1:32:52] author but when you know the author you
[1:32:54] know the
[1:32:56] word that's why we say you've got to
[1:32:58] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost let
[1:33:00] this mind that was in Christ be also in
[1:33:03] you if you don't do that brothers and
[1:33:05] sisters you're just going to be a
[1:33:07] theologian and I promise you I guarantee
[1:33:10] you this if you're a theologian and
[1:33:12] that's as far as it goes maybe you know
[1:33:14] all maybe you're a message
[1:33:17] Theologian they exist maybe you're a
[1:33:21] Biblical Theologian Maybe you've got
[1:33:24] Bible School under your belt maybe
[1:33:26] you've got all that there but if you
[1:33:27] don't have Christ in
[1:33:30] you do you have a hope of glory we've
[1:33:33] got to have him inside of
[1:33:36] us we will be misled that's what my
[1:33:39] guarantee is if you just have all of the
[1:33:41] knowledge but you don't have the life I
[1:33:44] promise you you will be misled you will
[1:33:46] be deceived there's no way around it
[1:33:49] because it will be so close at the very
[1:33:51] end that it would deceive the very
[1:33:52] elected if it were possible and there's
[1:33:55] only one way that it's not possible
[1:33:56] brother bradam brings it out very very
[1:33:58] clearly that only one way is by the
[1:34:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost the true
[1:34:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost many people
[1:34:04] say I've been baptized already brother
[1:34:07] Barry have you been baptized in
[1:34:09] Christian baptism according to the book
[1:34:11] of Acts why didn't any of the Apostles
[1:34:14] baptize anybody in the name of the
[1:34:17] father and of the son and of the Holy
[1:34:20] Ghost if that was a thing why didn't
[1:34:24] they why isn't there a Biblical account
[1:34:27] of someone being baptized that way oh
[1:34:30] but there is people being baptized in
[1:34:33] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ why is
[1:34:38] that because that's what this message is
[1:34:40] for this message was to what restore all
[1:34:44] things we heard about it on Wednesday it
[1:34:46] was so good how many enjoyed that
[1:34:48] message from Brother Jack my it was good
[1:34:52] so glad that we were able to make his
[1:34:53] acquaintance God bless you brother Jack
[1:34:56] if you're listening my what a wonderful
[1:34:58] message and brother Mario last Sunday
[1:35:01] just been a wonderful time feeding at
[1:35:03] the table of the Lord and you know many
[1:35:05] people here probably aren't aware of
[1:35:07] this but we've been studying the
[1:35:08] exposition of the seven Church ages and
[1:35:10] we have come to the place in the pergan
[1:35:12] church age where where it is is it a
[1:35:16] perian s seean I'm getting myself all
[1:35:19] mixed up we're getting to the place
[1:35:21] where brother bradam talks about pick up
[1:35:22] your pen and write
[1:35:24] and I stopped just before we got there
[1:35:27] and and just right at the very beginning
[1:35:29] pick up your pen and write and and how
[1:35:31] tremendous of a message that is and
[1:35:32] brother Bram talks about how it's got to
[1:35:34] do with the bride and the word and and
[1:35:37] and I stopped there on a Wednesday night
[1:35:39] service and then we had brother marot
[1:35:41] Chua come from from Arizona and and he
[1:35:44] what does he do he picks up his pen and
[1:35:46] starts just talking right from where we
[1:35:49] left off just such a beautiful thing and
[1:35:50] then on Wednesday night the very next
[1:35:52] service three services in a row we have
[1:35:55] brother Jack Duff from from Florida
[1:35:57] we've never talked about any of this
[1:35:59] never talked to brother Mario there's no
[1:36:01] discussion about it and suddenly we're
[1:36:03] talking about pick up your pen and write
[1:36:05] brothers and sisters I wanted to bring
[1:36:06] that today but I just wanted to stick
[1:36:08] with it God's Will and and his word but
[1:36:11] what a tremendous thing it is to know
[1:36:13] the spirit of God is moving this is not
[1:36:16] a a human thing that's happening this is
[1:36:18] God speaking to us but beware of false
[1:36:21] prophets which come to you in sheep's
[1:36:24] clothing but inwardly they are ravening
[1:36:28] wolves ye shall know them isn't it
[1:36:31] beautiful you get the warning and then
[1:36:33] you get the identification you shall
[1:36:35] know them by their
[1:36:39] fruits what's the life they live
[1:36:41] brothers and
[1:36:42] sisters not how much money do they make
[1:36:44] what kind of business they've got what
[1:36:46] kind of job what kind of degree what
[1:36:47] kind of clothes what kind of house where
[1:36:49] they live geographically how many people
[1:36:51] are in their family what kind of church
[1:36:53] they have how big is their Church what
[1:36:55] kind of music program no it's got
[1:36:57] nothing to do with it what's the fruit
[1:36:59] are they leading people encouraging
[1:37:01] people to Christ the only way they're
[1:37:03] going to be able to do that is by the
[1:37:05] word for our day and that's to the
[1:37:07] message of the hour just simply saying
[1:37:09] what the prophet said but then living
[1:37:12] it that's the only way we're going to
[1:37:15] know them is by their fruit beware of
[1:37:18] false prophets which comes to you in
[1:37:20] sheep's clothing but inwardly they are
[1:37:23] are ravening
[1:37:24] wolves isn't it wonderful how brother
[1:37:27] Jack he brought that on on Wednesday I
[1:37:29] just have to say it I got to go back to
[1:37:31] it it's just beautiful if William Mariam
[1:37:35] Bram was so off on his Doctrine then why
[1:37:38] did God continually back him
[1:37:42] up didn't matter where he went he said
[1:37:45] whether he was in Florida whether he was
[1:37:46] in Calgary he would say so and so with
[1:37:50] such and such on you're here and address
[1:37:54] is this and you're not here for you
[1:37:57] you're here for your brother or for your
[1:37:58] sister your mother your father how could
[1:38:01] he do
[1:38:03] that the spirit of God but why would God
[1:38:06] back him up if he was so far off on his
[1:38:09] Doctrine just doesn't make any sense
[1:38:12] rationally speaking it's just
[1:38:14] irrational ye shall know them by their
[1:38:17] fruits do men gather Grapes of
[1:38:21] thorns or figs of thistles
[1:38:25] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[1:38:28] good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth
[1:38:32] forth evil
[1:38:34] fruit and you know we can go right back
[1:38:36] to the Garden of Eden here I'm not going
[1:38:37] to do it for long just going to touch on
[1:38:39] it remember there was two trees in the
[1:38:40] Garden of Eden right one the tree of
[1:38:43] knowledge of Good and Evil and the other
[1:38:44] one the tree of life and we know
[1:38:47] thoroughly that those were were were
[1:38:49] clearly identified as persons people
[1:38:53] right Jesus Christ and the devil you
[1:38:56] shall know them by their fruits even so
[1:38:59] every good tree bringeth forth good
[1:39:01] fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth
[1:39:04] evil fruit a good tree cannot bring
[1:39:06] forth evil
[1:39:08] fruit so you don't have to worry
[1:39:10] brothers and sisters you're not going to
[1:39:11] bring forth evil fruit it's not possible
[1:39:15] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[1:39:18] good fruit and every tree that bringeth
[1:39:21] not forth good fruit is Heen down and
[1:39:25] cast Into the Fire wherefore by their
[1:39:29] fruits ye shall know them by the life
[1:39:33] they live by their willingness to
[1:39:36] subject themselves to the word of
[1:39:38] God that's the only identification
[1:39:41] brothers and sisters that's why the
[1:39:43] prophet in our day brought the
[1:39:44] identification the true identification
[1:39:46] of the Holy Ghost is to be able to align
[1:39:50] with the word of God for your day to be
[1:39:52] able to say Amen to the word of God
[1:39:56] verse 21 says not everyone that saith
[1:39:58] unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:40:00] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[1:40:02] will of My Father which is in heaven
[1:40:06] what is his will his
[1:40:09] word and what's the will for today the
[1:40:12] message of the hour that's not William
[1:40:15] Mary and bram's message brothers and
[1:40:17] sisters we know that it's God's message
[1:40:20] given to his messenger
[1:40:25] many will say to me in that day that
[1:40:28] great white Throne Lord Lord have we not
[1:40:32] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[1:40:34] have cast out devils and in thy name
[1:40:37] done many wonderful works and then I
[1:40:41] will profess to them I never knew
[1:40:45] you and you know brothers and sisters we
[1:40:47] were talking about this a little while
[1:40:48] ago this goes
[1:40:50] beyond a
[1:40:51] handshake the
[1:40:53] introduction of of brother so and so and
[1:40:57] the Lord Jesus Christ it goes well
[1:40:59] beyond that this goes into the the
[1:41:01] intimacy of a a relationship a husband
[1:41:05] and a wife where the twain become one
[1:41:09] where they're no longer
[1:41:10] separate and I will profess unto them I
[1:41:13] never knew you I never had a personal
[1:41:16] relationship with you what's the new
[1:41:18] birth personal relationship with Jesus
[1:41:22] Christ him making himself known
[1:41:24] personally to the
[1:41:26] individual then I will profess unto them
[1:41:29] I never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:41:30] work iniquity those people that knew
[1:41:32] they should do and don't and those
[1:41:34] people that knew they shouldn't and do
[1:41:36] that's iniquity therefore whosoever he
[1:41:39] heareth these sayings of mine and doeth
[1:41:42] them I will liken him unto a wise man
[1:41:45] which built his house upon a rock upon a
[1:41:48] what a rock a rock a revelation an
[1:41:52] understanding of of the word of God
[1:41:54] something that didn't come from flesh
[1:41:55] and blood but came from my Father which
[1:41:57] is in heaven and the rain descended and
[1:42:00] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[1:42:02] upon that house and it fell not for it
[1:42:05] was founded upon a what a rock a
[1:42:08] revelation and when that happens nobody
[1:42:10] can take it from you verse 26 and
[1:42:13] everyone that heareth these sayings of
[1:42:15] mine and doeth them not shall be likened
[1:42:19] unto a foolish man which built his house
[1:42:21] upon the sand and the rain descended and
[1:42:23] the floods came and the winds blew and
[1:42:25] beat upon that house and it fell and
[1:42:28] great was the fall of it and it came to
[1:42:31] pass when Jesus had ended these sayings
[1:42:33] the people were astonished at his
[1:42:35] Doctrine I just this gets me excited
[1:42:37] brothers and sisters because when you
[1:42:39] think about this for he taught them as
[1:42:41] one having Authority and not as the
[1:42:44] scribes I just couldn't help but think
[1:42:46] maybe he got just a little bit
[1:42:48] Pentecostal while he was speaking these
[1:42:50] words maybe he actually got excited and
[1:42:53] started to
[1:42:55] preach you know we we we said this out
[1:42:57] of the exposition of the seven Church
[1:42:59] ages these seven Messengers are making
[1:43:01] known making God known to the people
[1:43:04] each one of the seven Church age
[1:43:06] Messengers he that receiveth them
[1:43:09] receiveth him that sent them and those
[1:43:14] that reject him unfortunately they're
[1:43:16] not rejecting him and that's what the PO
[1:43:18] world doesn't really see when you know
[1:43:20] and we're not talking about the world
[1:43:21] what I want to talk about very spefic
[1:43:23] specifically is the people that will
[1:43:24] take
[1:43:25] 99% of the message of the hour but just
[1:43:28] leave that one thing out when we leave
[1:43:30] that one thing out brothers and sisters
[1:43:32] we might as well leave it all out
[1:43:35] because we're actually not doing what
[1:43:37] we're supposed to as Sons and Daughters
[1:43:39] of God we being
[1:43:43] disobedient my now let's get into our
[1:43:47] our study this
[1:43:49] morning I like to talk a little bit
[1:43:50] about Joseph I just think it's wonderful
[1:43:52] his story to recognize that he was the
[1:43:54] first son of Rachel the one whom Jacob
[1:43:57] Loved At First Sight we know the story
[1:43:59] very well he was loved by his father
[1:44:01] hated of his Brethren hated the more the
[1:44:03] the more that he expressed who he was
[1:44:06] like a sheep expresses wool and a a dove
[1:44:08] just expresses white as Joseph expressed
[1:44:11] Joseph he was hated the more and there
[1:44:14] was nothing that he was doing he was
[1:44:15] just being he was just being himself but
[1:44:17] his brothers they persecuted him and we
[1:44:20] know that he was persecuted by his
[1:44:21] brother and he was rejected of his
[1:44:22] brother we know the prophet said that
[1:44:24] Joseph was actually a type of Jesus
[1:44:26] Christ and we know that the further he
[1:44:29] was rejected the farther down he went
[1:44:31] all the way down into the grave and what
[1:44:34] did he do he rose all the way up and sat
[1:44:37] at the right hand of pharaoh the most
[1:44:39] powerful position in the land we know
[1:44:42] that that not a person moved in Egypt
[1:44:46] without acknowledging
[1:44:48] Joseph when he came around nobody ever
[1:44:53] didn't recognize his his position but
[1:44:57] you know Joseph never let any of that
[1:44:58] get between him and that word and I
[1:45:01] would think if we were basing our lives
[1:45:03] on opportunity to say that I've got this
[1:45:06] situation and I've had that problem and
[1:45:08] I've got this thing and the other then
[1:45:10] if anyone had the opportunity to say
[1:45:12] I've got a reason I got a right to be
[1:45:14] maybe a little bit bitter a little bit
[1:45:16] down this man would have that wouldn't
[1:45:19] he but something never let him get there
[1:45:24] out of the pergan church age brother
[1:45:26] bradam he says he knew that the way man
[1:45:29] originally got away from
[1:45:31] God was by first leaving the
[1:45:35] word not by leaving
[1:45:39] church by leaving the word amen
[1:45:42] hallelujah but you know what if we leave
[1:45:44] church I want to say are we sticking
[1:45:47] with the word he knew that the way man
[1:45:50] originally got away from God was by
[1:45:53] first leaving the word if you leave that
[1:45:56] word you have left
[1:45:59] God that's
[1:46:01] powerful if we take some sort of
[1:46:03] substitute if we take some other Avenue
[1:46:06] other than the message for our
[1:46:08] hour what are we doing brothers and
[1:46:10] sisters we said it earlier on I think
[1:46:12] it's real sad it's a real difficult
[1:46:14] thing but we're not rejecting the
[1:46:16] minister we get fed up and say brother
[1:46:18] Barry or we get fed up and say brother
[1:46:20] so and so it's that Ministry it's not
[1:46:22] that Ministry it's
[1:46:24] God because if we really believe the
[1:46:27] word I want to say it and I'm sure we
[1:46:29] all know it but have you experienced it
[1:46:31] you could change what's being
[1:46:34] preached you have the ability to operate
[1:46:37] the
[1:46:39] gifts and it's not just in the preaching
[1:46:41] of the word it's in the playing of the
[1:46:44] music it's all the ministry if you want
[1:46:47] to see different music if you want to
[1:46:48] see different temples if you want to see
[1:46:50] different worship then start praying and
[1:46:53] see if God won't come on the
[1:46:55] scene because we either serve a living
[1:46:58] God or we serve a dumb
[1:47:00] Idol right and we serve a living
[1:47:06] God if you leave that word brothers and
[1:47:08] sisters you haven't left the church you
[1:47:11] haven't left brother Barry you haven't
[1:47:13] left the other Pastor you haven't left
[1:47:15] whoever whatever you've let something
[1:47:18] get between you and that word and if you
[1:47:19] leave that word you've left God
[1:47:24] you know Joseph he had parents that
[1:47:27] taught him they trained him up in the
[1:47:29] way that he should go we know that his
[1:47:32] mom passed away but there was a bunch of
[1:47:34] other moms around in Joseph's life after
[1:47:38] his mom died and you know even when he
[1:47:41] was real little you can just imagine
[1:47:44] that Rachel was actually singing songs
[1:47:47] to him teaching him about the prophets
[1:47:50] the law of Moses and his parents
[1:47:53] raised him up they taught
[1:47:56] him we can teach and preach our children
[1:47:59] all we want but we can't save
[1:48:01] them we have to train them up in the way
[1:48:04] they should go and and let them have a
[1:48:07] personal experience with Christ for
[1:48:10] themselves but I would say woe unto us
[1:48:13] if we make excuses and don't train up
[1:48:16] our children in the way they should go
[1:48:18] if we teach our children that it's okay
[1:48:20] to just leave church it's okay to just
[1:48:23] you know stay home and play tapes or
[1:48:25] make excuses if we start doing that
[1:48:27] brothers and sisters we're going to
[1:48:28] answer for our children who potentially
[1:48:31] don't serve God it it's not going to be
[1:48:34] something that we can just say oh it's
[1:48:36] okay it's their thing I just dedicated
[1:48:38] them to God and they'll be fine as
[1:48:40] parents we do have a responsibility
[1:48:43] that's why I say God bless you fathers
[1:48:45] for being the lead role in the home we
[1:48:47] know that in the Garden of Eden God
[1:48:49] never came down and said eve what have
[1:48:52] you
[1:48:53] done God came down and said Adam Adam
[1:48:58] and every single man who is a father and
[1:49:01] a husband God is going to hold that man
[1:49:05] responsible for that
[1:49:08] family he's not going to say oh you've
[1:49:10] got to pass your children will
[1:49:11] rebellious why were they
[1:49:14] rebellious what were the dinnertime
[1:49:16] conversations about the
[1:49:19] pastor about the brother about the
[1:49:22] sister about the teacher about the
[1:49:25] boss brothers and sisters our children
[1:49:28] are listening and it behooves us to make
[1:49:30] sure that we are prudent with the word
[1:49:32] of God they need to see the same person
[1:49:35] at the dinner table at home that they
[1:49:38] see sitting in church all polished up
[1:49:40] serving God and if they don't brothers
[1:49:43] and sisters they're getting an
[1:49:45] incongruent message they're going to
[1:49:47] think there's something funny either
[1:49:49] there's something funny with the church
[1:49:51] group or there's something funny with
[1:49:53] our home and you know what can happen is
[1:49:55] the children will typically say there's
[1:49:57] something funny with the church
[1:49:59] group that's what's going to happen the
[1:50:01] devil's going to get in their head he's
[1:50:03] going to give them rock and roll in
[1:50:04] movies Maybe video games whatever it is
[1:50:07] and they're just going to go
[1:50:09] off we got to be
[1:50:11] careful we have to make sure that we
[1:50:13] teach and preach our children but we
[1:50:15] can't save
[1:50:21] them I think uh another quote that I
[1:50:24] just wanted to say these seven
[1:50:25] Messengers are making God known to the
[1:50:28] people he that receiveth them receiveth
[1:50:31] him that sent them that's what brother
[1:50:33] Jack brought on Wednesday these seven
[1:50:35] Messengers are making God known to the
[1:50:37] people he that receiveth them receiveth
[1:50:40] him that sent them talking about Daniel
[1:50:45] we know that he must have been taught by
[1:50:46] his parents and just so beautiful
[1:50:48] because he would have been taught the
[1:50:49] prophet Isaiah and the Prophet Jeremiah
[1:50:53] he he would have been taught all of that
[1:50:55] stuff he would have been told you know
[1:50:56] what repent he would have heard all of
[1:50:59] that over and over and over again oh
[1:51:02] another message repent get back in line
[1:51:04] with the word they would have taught
[1:51:06] that over and over and that was the only
[1:51:08] way for them even when their city was
[1:51:10] under siege he heard them say he heard
[1:51:12] the prophets say you know what you can
[1:51:15] go out and surrender go surrender to
[1:51:18] King Nebuchadnezzar and you'll live
[1:51:21] you'll live as a slave for the rest of
[1:51:22] of your lives for rejecting the word of
[1:51:24] the Prophet but at least you'll
[1:51:26] live and they wouldn't do that why
[1:51:29] wouldn't they because of
[1:51:30] pride pride was there they had an image
[1:51:33] they had an idea of who they
[1:51:37] were but Daniel he was taught he heard
[1:51:41] the word of the prophets and his parents
[1:51:43] they said above all else take his word
[1:51:47] take the prophet's word because that's
[1:51:49] what's going to save you and you know
[1:51:52] what what interesting is the rest of the
[1:51:54] city was completely sacked wasn't
[1:51:57] it those people those those judgment
[1:52:01] Angels were told to go through the city
[1:52:03] not sparing women or children old or
[1:52:07] young to pull your sword and just slay
[1:52:11] and that's what they did but something
[1:52:13] saved this man how did he get saved
[1:52:16] because of his parents
[1:52:17] teaching they told him listen to The
[1:52:21] Prophet listen to the word of the
[1:52:24] prophet and you know it wasn't just that
[1:52:26] his parents taught him that it was that
[1:52:28] there was something inside of him
[1:52:30] something inside of him was able to say
[1:52:32] Amen to that word and we've heard it a
[1:52:34] couple times already it's that spiritual
[1:52:35] DNA we can't even control it you know we
[1:52:38] will come if we are his sons and
[1:52:40] daughters of God but you know I just
[1:52:42] think it's so beautiful Daniel even when
[1:52:44] he went into captivity what did he do he
[1:52:46] conducted himself just like that story
[1:52:48] we've heard the prophet talk about the
[1:52:50] slave right there was that that group of
[1:52:52] slaves maybe at that one Plantation but
[1:52:54] there was just this one he would not act
[1:52:57] like all the rest of them he had his
[1:52:59] shoulders back he had his chin up he
[1:53:01] knew exactly who he was he was the son
[1:53:05] of the king of the tribe back home and
[1:53:08] nobody was going to take that from him
[1:53:10] nobody could take that from him even if
[1:53:12] they tried to to do something to him and
[1:53:14] say you're you're you're a different
[1:53:16] person now they couldn't take that away
[1:53:19] from him he knew who his daddy was right
[1:53:21] from the very beginning right Daniel
[1:53:24] knew that so what did he do he conducted
[1:53:28] himself as a son of the
[1:53:32] king and you know even in the midst of
[1:53:35] the of the the the situation being held
[1:53:39] captive taken away put into captivity
[1:53:42] but you know I think it maybe helped him
[1:53:43] brought maybe a little bit of
[1:53:44] consolation because he knew that the
[1:53:46] prophet said this is going to happen
[1:53:48] this people has rejected God and now
[1:53:51] captivity is the only thing that's there
[1:53:52] for you and you know as we study this I
[1:53:55] I I think it's such a I'm sorry just
[1:53:57] such a deviation from really where I
[1:53:59] wanted to go we got 15 minutes left if
[1:54:01] we're on time uh uh being Father's Day
[1:54:03] maybe we could get a little extra 10
[1:54:05] minutes maybe but uh you know he
[1:54:09] conducted himself as a Son of God in
[1:54:11] every circumstance even where they tried
[1:54:13] to reprogram him and change his identity
[1:54:16] teach him a new language changed his
[1:54:18] name brought him into the circumstance
[1:54:20] gave him new food all of that he said no
[1:54:22] no no no no I'm not I just will not
[1:54:24] defile myself and just try me prove that
[1:54:26] I don't serve a living God prove that my
[1:54:29] God is a living God and just feed us
[1:54:30] pulse and we know that his countenance
[1:54:33] was fair their their countenance those
[1:54:35] four Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and
[1:54:37] Daniel their their countenance was
[1:54:38] fairer just eating pulse than the other
[1:54:41] ones who were eating the meat and the
[1:54:42] wine from the king's table and what
[1:54:44] happened to all the other
[1:54:46] captives God will not let his own alone
[1:54:50] he actually changed the circumstances
[1:54:52] for them and the chief guard he said hey
[1:54:54] you know what if it's good for these
[1:54:56] guys it's got to be good for them so
[1:54:57] we're going to change this all around
[1:54:59] and he saved the rest of them from
[1:55:01] completely defiling themselves which is
[1:55:03] what they were doing but he conducted
[1:55:04] himself as a Son of God in every s
[1:55:07] situation in every circumstance he as he
[1:55:10] went into
[1:55:11] captivity and you know it it it it
[1:55:15] wasn't because of his rejection of the
[1:55:17] word he still held fast to the word of
[1:55:20] God
[1:55:22] but he made I just think it's so
[1:55:24] beautiful he made a conscious decision
[1:55:26] to intercede for all the rest even those
[1:55:29] people that he didn't have anything to
[1:55:31] do with right when when the king had the
[1:55:33] dream and he called in all of his
[1:55:35] soothsayers and magicians and the Chans
[1:55:38] and all those people the sorcerers
[1:55:41] brought them in and said I've had a
[1:55:42] dream and I need you to tell me the
[1:55:44] interpretation and they said oh King oh
[1:55:46] we'd be happy to do that we just love
[1:55:48] the the payroll and the position that
[1:55:50] we've got so just tell us the dream and
[1:55:52] then we'll give you the interpretation
[1:55:54] he said you know what if you don't
[1:55:55] actually tell me the dream then I know
[1:55:57] that you're a liar and if you are that
[1:55:59] person then you're going to die I'm
[1:56:01] going to cut you into pieces and turn
[1:56:02] your house into a dungill if you can't
[1:56:05] actually do your job I'm sick of you
[1:56:08] guys always lying to me and they came to
[1:56:10] Daniel and said hey you know what The
[1:56:12] Jig Is up sorry we can't do anything for
[1:56:14] you now we're going to slay all you
[1:56:15] people and he said hold on a
[1:56:18] second I'm a son of a king let's just
[1:56:21] talk about this for a second
[1:56:23] uh if you'll just give me just a little
[1:56:25] bit of time maybe what I could do is
[1:56:27] take it to my God take it to my daddy
[1:56:29] just bring the need to him and see if he
[1:56:32] won't come on the scene and and tell you
[1:56:35] your dream and we know that he was given
[1:56:37] the dream he was given the
[1:56:39] interpretation of the dream we know
[1:56:41] that's only God there's nobody else that
[1:56:43] can do that but he still made a
[1:56:45] conscious decision to intercede is what
[1:56:47] the word says for those
[1:56:49] people the people who were against him
[1:56:52] yeah these were the people that went
[1:56:53] Green With Envy because we know the very
[1:56:55] next thing was that image that was
[1:56:57] erected in his honor Nebuchadnezzar was
[1:56:59] very much an idol worshipper very much
[1:57:02] into image very much into
[1:57:04] image and so what did he do he made an
[1:57:06] image of Daniel and he told everyone in
[1:57:09] the land if you don't worship this image
[1:57:11] of Daniel then you're going to be burned
[1:57:12] you're going to be thrown into a burning
[1:57:13] fiery furnace because this guy there's
[1:57:15] something special about him and he's my
[1:57:17] guy he's in my court he is on my team
[1:57:20] and if you don't follow what I tell you
[1:57:22] worshiping this guy you're done for I
[1:57:24] don't want nothing to do with you and so
[1:57:27] what happened his friends Shadrach
[1:57:29] Meshach and Abed ago they we know the
[1:57:31] story all too well right what did they
[1:57:33] say they said no way ain't G to happen
[1:57:36] it's our friend you you want us to
[1:57:37] worship our friend you're crazy man and
[1:57:40] you know when they didn't and they were
[1:57:42] brought before the king the Chans were
[1:57:44] very quick to accuse them because they
[1:57:45] were Green With Envy that they would
[1:57:47] have some sort of ability to be risen up
[1:57:49] to their level and we know they were all
[1:57:51] schooled and educ ated they were brought
[1:57:52] to the place where they worked they
[1:57:54] earned the right to be in their position
[1:57:56] but yet these captives come in and
[1:57:57] suddenly they're swooped up to the side
[1:57:59] of the king as advisers how could that
[1:58:02] be but they just took great great great
[1:58:05] joy in bringing them in before the king
[1:58:07] and they said hey we can't do it and the
[1:58:09] King said you know you're actually
[1:58:11] starting to get on my nerves you're
[1:58:13] starting to grade on me I like Daniel
[1:58:15] and and I tolerated you but now you're
[1:58:17] getting on my nerves now you're testing
[1:58:20] me in front of all of my subjects in the
[1:58:21] land you're going to defy me and they
[1:58:24] said hey King listen you know what we're
[1:58:26] not going to be careful to even answer
[1:58:28] you in this matter and that alone
[1:58:30] brothers and sisters meant certain death
[1:58:32] in the court of Nebuchadnezzar you did
[1:58:35] not defy a king like that and get away
[1:58:37] with
[1:58:38] it but they did they said NOP we're not
[1:58:40] even going to be careful to answer you
[1:58:42] if God be God then we're going to serve
[1:58:44] him and that's all we're going to serve
[1:58:45] we're not going to bow down to no image
[1:58:47] that you try and erect of our friend
[1:58:48] we're going to serve the Living God and
[1:58:51] if it means our life then so be it amen
[1:58:53] throw us into the
[1:58:55] furnace because we know that he'll save
[1:58:57] us either he'll take us home or he'll
[1:59:00] come on the scene and we know we know we
[1:59:03] read it last time brothers and sisters
[1:59:04] now I'm starting to preach I'm starting
[1:59:06] to get excited because if you remember
[1:59:07] brother bradam talks about that story
[1:59:09] and he says let's take the camera and
[1:59:12] change the angle now and he goes up into
[1:59:15] heaven and starts talking about the oh
[1:59:17] my the Angels
[1:59:19] wormwood oh my how wormwood said you
[1:59:22] know what I flooded out the anti
[1:59:24] deluvian destruction I wiped the face of
[1:59:26] the Earth everything with breath in its
[1:59:28] lungs oh my there's a real hot furnace
[1:59:31] down there have you seen what's going on
[1:59:33] Lord I could go and deal with that right
[1:59:35] now and he said no don't worry about it
[1:59:37] we know we know Gabriel drew his sword
[1:59:41] and said do you see what they're doing
[1:59:42] down there we've been watching them all
[1:59:43] night God said don't worry about it I
[1:59:46] got this under control but what happened
[1:59:48] he didn't send his Angel the point I
[1:59:50] want to get to is he came himself
[1:59:53] he came down himself into the fiery
[1:59:55] furnace for his children who were
[1:59:57] willing to not be careful to answer the
[1:59:59] king of the age they were willing to
[2:00:02] serve the Living God and why is that it
[2:00:05] was because they were taught they were
[2:00:06] trained up in the way they should
[2:00:09] go and what did God do he came down and
[2:00:11] he blessed them and even the king said
[2:00:15] whoa didn't we just throw three people
[2:00:18] in the fire I see four oh my and that
[2:00:21] one looks like the Son of
[2:00:23] God just so beautiful isn't
[2:00:26] it it's amazing to think about how the
[2:00:29] Lord dealt with these two men Joseph and
[2:00:33] Daniel every situation every
[2:00:35] circumstance they just put God first
[2:00:37] they just put God first that's all we
[2:00:40] need to do brothers and sisters is put
[2:00:41] God first in every situation of our
[2:00:43] lives and you know what it'll turn out
[2:00:45] right but if we're willing to deviate on
[2:00:48] the word of God because of some
[2:00:49] tradition because of some teaching
[2:00:51] because of whatever it is we've got it's
[2:00:54] not going to turn out right it's going
[2:00:56] to turn into a
[2:00:58] problem I think it's so beautiful going
[2:01:00] on to chapter 4 of of Daniel if you want
[2:01:04] to turn over there with me we've still
[2:01:06] got a couple
[2:01:10] minutes he made a conscious decision
[2:01:12] every single day to stay with the word
[2:01:14] to to intercede for those people around
[2:01:17] him that really needed
[2:01:19] help he kept himself chased to the word
[2:01:23] and you know he could only be who he
[2:01:26] was he couldn't try even if he tried to
[2:01:29] he couldn't be someone
[2:01:31] else I think it's just so good for us to
[2:01:33] remember don't try and be anybody else
[2:01:35] brother brandham says that very clearly
[2:01:37] just be you just let God manifest
[2:01:40] through you the way he created you he
[2:01:43] created every one of us to be just a
[2:01:44] little bit different for a reason so we
[2:01:48] could be flowers in his bouquet in
[2:01:50] Daniel chapter 4
[2:01:53] Nebuchadnezzar the king unto all people
[2:01:56] Nations and languages that dwell in all
[2:01:58] the Earth peace be multiplied unto you I
[2:02:02] thought it good to show the signs and
[2:02:04] wonders that the high God hath wrought
[2:02:06] toward me how great are his signs and
[2:02:09] how Mighty are his wonders his kingdom
[2:02:13] is an everlasting Kingdom and his
[2:02:15] Dominion is from generation to
[2:02:19] generation interesting to see his
[2:02:22] perspective now he's given glory to the
[2:02:25] Living God verse four I Nebuchadnezzar
[2:02:28] was at rest in mine house and
[2:02:32] flourishing in my
[2:02:34] Palace makes me wonder brothers and
[2:02:36] sisters how many times we can be at rest
[2:02:40] in our house and just flourishing in our
[2:02:45] Palace don't be flourishing in your
[2:02:47] Palace be resting in the Lord be resting
[2:02:51] in in the word be resting in the word of
[2:02:54] the Living God making sure that he is
[2:02:57] first and when that happens then you
[2:03:00] will flourish you won't have to say
[2:03:04] it you won't have to show anybody people
[2:03:08] will say what are you doing man how come
[2:03:10] are you so
[2:03:12] flourishing but you won't be saying in
[2:03:14] the mirror look at how much I'm
[2:03:16] flourishing in my Palace
[2:03:19] what for time sake I'm just to Jump
[2:03:22] Ahead we know that he had a dream he had
[2:03:24] this dream verse 8 he he called in
[2:03:26] Daniel he started to identify the Living
[2:03:29] God he said you know what I know there's
[2:03:30] already a guy I got a guy and we're
[2:03:32] going to call him in here in verse eight
[2:03:34] says but but at the last Daniel came in
[2:03:37] before me whose name was belto shazar
[2:03:39] according to the name of my God and in
[2:03:42] whom is the spirit of the Holy Gods
[2:03:44] before him I told the dream now we know
[2:03:48] that Daniel gave him the interpretation
[2:03:50] of it for time sake I'm not going to
[2:03:52] read it all I will let us do that but
[2:03:56] you know the the the Living God said
[2:04:00] that this guy needed to actually go and
[2:04:03] be humbled and every single man that
[2:04:06] will
[2:04:07] actually uplift himself boost himself
[2:04:10] try and shine an image to The World God
[2:04:13] will abase that man there's no way that
[2:04:16] we're going to escape that especially if
[2:04:18] we are a son and a daughter of God he
[2:04:20] knows exactly how how to Humble us but
[2:04:23] you know this this dream happened and it
[2:04:25] was a dream about the tree and the shade
[2:04:27] and how how he had this image and uh God
[2:04:32] had to show him God had to show him if
[2:04:34] we jump down to verse 28 we know that
[2:04:37] Daniel gives him the interpretation of
[2:04:38] this dream shows him that it's his
[2:04:40] kingdom and that you know what the
[2:04:42] Watchers have said they brought back an
[2:04:44] evil report to the the father above and
[2:04:47] and he said you know we we're going to
[2:04:48] have to do something about this we're
[2:04:50] going to cut this tree down but we're
[2:04:51] not kill it we're just going to cut it
[2:04:53] down and all of the the the flourishing
[2:04:56] in the branches of the animals and the
[2:04:58] shade that this this this giant Ministry
[2:05:02] brought to the kingdom it's going to be
[2:05:04] chopped down but there's going to be a
[2:05:05] root there and that root will still come
[2:05:07] again so verse 28 says and all this Came
[2:05:11] Upon King
[2:05:12] Nebuchadnezzar at the end of 12
[2:05:16] months he walked in the Palace of the
[2:05:19] kingdom of Babylon 12 months after
[2:05:22] hearing the word of God the
[2:05:25] interpretation of this dream the
[2:05:27] interpretation came true verse 30 says
[2:05:30] the king spake and said is not this
[2:05:34] great Babylon that I have built for the
[2:05:37] house of the Kingdom by the might of my
[2:05:41] power and for the honor of my
[2:05:45] majesty and while the word was yet in
[2:05:48] the king's mouth there fell a voice from
[2:05:51] Heaven saying oh King Nebuchadnezzar to
[2:05:53] thee it is spoken the kingdom is
[2:05:57] departed from thee and they shall Drive
[2:05:59] thee from men and thy dwelling shall be
[2:06:02] with the beasts of the field they shall
[2:06:04] make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven
[2:06:07] times shall pass over thee until thou
[2:06:11] know that the most high ruleth in the
[2:06:13] Kingdom of men and giveth it to
[2:06:16] whomsoever he will and if you jump down
[2:06:19] to verse 37 we we know seven times went
[2:06:23] passed over him he went out seven years
[2:06:26] into the Wilderness isn't it interesting
[2:06:28] that his kingdom remained though they
[2:06:31] waited for him verse 37 now I
[2:06:35] Nebuchadnezzar praise and exall and
[2:06:37] honor the king of Heaven all whose works
[2:06:40] are truth and his ways judgment and
[2:06:44] those that walk in Pride he is able to
[2:06:49] abase don't let Pride have a foothold in
[2:06:51] your life brothers and sisters there
[2:06:52] ain't one of us that's got any good in
[2:06:54] our lives not one of us the only thing
[2:06:57] that's good is Jesus Christ the same
[2:07:00] yesterday today and
[2:07:02] forever it's just amazing to look at
[2:07:04] this he had the ability to be humbled
[2:07:07] even whilst he was flourishing in his
[2:07:10] Palace that that it it's just kind of
[2:07:13] humorous the way that he wrote that but
[2:07:16] you know he had that out of the
[2:07:18] exposition of the seven Church ages
[2:07:20] brother bradam talking about his will
[2:07:22] being his word understanding that it is
[2:07:26] very important to keep this word in
[2:07:29] front of us but we can say which word we
[2:07:32] we want to remember that the prophet
[2:07:34] used the King James version Bible and
[2:07:37] that word is the word that we want to
[2:07:39] keep before our eyes we don't want to
[2:07:41] make excuses for it and say well I think
[2:07:43] there's some other scripture some other
[2:07:45] Bible some other interpretation you know
[2:07:47] brother Barry he will read from the
[2:07:48] Amplified Bible but I don't make that my
[2:07:50] absolute absolute is the King James
[2:07:52] version Bible the Bible that the prophet
[2:07:55] for our day used that God used to
[2:07:57] expound the word through that's the
[2:07:59] Bible we look
[2:08:00] at the exposition of the seven Church
[2:08:03] ages I just love this one brother Brown
[2:08:05] Andy says even so today God tells folks
[2:08:08] to go ahead in their own heart's
[2:08:12] desires that's why we need to make sure
[2:08:14] that we we we have a new heart in us
[2:08:17] don't we maybe I'll call the musicians I
[2:08:19] don't want to make anybody nervous here
[2:08:22] will close soon but you know we sing
[2:08:24] that song create in me a clean
[2:08:27] heart and renew a right spirit in me
[2:08:30] even so today God tells folks to go
[2:08:33] ahead in their own Hearts
[2:08:36] desires for they have already rejected
[2:08:38] the
[2:08:40] word you're going to do it anyways might
[2:08:42] as well go ahead that's why people have
[2:08:45] ask the question did God change his mind
[2:08:48] does God change his mind we know that
[2:08:50] the the message that brother brandham
[2:08:52] preached talking about balum and baac
[2:08:55] does God ever change his mind about his
[2:08:58] word nope his first thought is the only
[2:09:01] thought his first word is the only
[2:09:04] word but pseudo theologians would like
[2:09:07] to try and actually put a spin on it and
[2:09:09] say wow there's another interpretation
[2:09:11] for today no there isn't there's no
[2:09:13] other interpretation other than his
[2:09:14] original thought which is his word
[2:09:16] because he's the same yesterday today
[2:09:18] forever the word changes not the whole
[2:09:20] world will change the whole world will
[2:09:22] pass away but heavens and earth oh my to
[2:09:27] think that they will pass away but his
[2:09:29] word will
[2:09:31] remain my he says they've already
[2:09:34] rejected the word but the will of God
[2:09:37] will be done regardless that's so
[2:09:39] beautiful you know we we talked about a
[2:09:41] little while ago and Lord willing will
[2:09:43] maybe pick up from from here talking
[2:09:46] about God's perfect will and his
[2:09:48] permissive will we we said it very vag
[2:09:51] before and and and broad spectrum and
[2:09:54] I'll say it again now is simply this one
[2:09:56] word off is God's permissive
[2:09:59] will because we can have 99% of the word
[2:10:01] but we just can't do that one thing just
[2:10:03] can't come to communion service just
[2:10:06] can't wash my brother's feet just can't
[2:10:09] do this just can't do that that's one
[2:10:11] word off that's God's permissive
[2:10:13] will God's perfect will is his whole
[2:10:16] word saying just be it unto me according
[2:10:18] to Thy word I don't think I can ever do
[2:10:20] that on my own and you know what
[2:10:22] brothers and sisters there ain't one
[2:10:23] person that can serve God according to
[2:10:25] his word on their own and that's why you
[2:10:27] see people fall away because they've
[2:10:30] been taught some sort of form of
[2:10:31] tradition some sort of hybridization of
[2:10:34] a a theological study out there and try
[2:10:36] and mingle it with the message of the
[2:10:37] hour you'll never do that God will never
[2:10:42] ever mix with denomination
[2:10:45] ever he says go ahead though they've
[2:10:48] already rejected the word but the will
[2:10:50] of God will be done regardless amen he
[2:10:52] says I hope you see this it will not
[2:10:54] only clear up much of what is seen in
[2:10:57] all ages but it will especially help in
[2:10:59] this last age which has so much
[2:11:02] manifestation and external blessings
[2:11:05] when have we ever had so much wealth
[2:11:08] transfer so much external
[2:11:11] blessings so many children just waiting
[2:11:14] for their parents to die so they can
[2:11:16] actually
[2:11:18] inherit it's absolutely terrible but
[2:11:20] it's true
[2:11:22] the baby Boomer's wealth transition is
[2:11:25] is an amazing amount of
[2:11:28] money but this last age which has much
[2:11:31] manifestation and external
[2:11:33] blessings when the whole period is so
[2:11:36] against the word revealed will of
[2:11:41] God and I'm going to focus on this as we
[2:11:44] go forwards with this discussion the
[2:11:47] word
[2:11:49] revealed will of God
[2:11:52] not just the will of God being revealed
[2:11:54] not just the will of God not just the
[2:11:56] word of
[2:11:57] God but the word revealed will of God
[2:12:03] it's got to be not flesh and blood that
[2:12:05] imparts it because if Flesh and Blood
[2:12:08] imparts it flesh and blood can remove
[2:12:11] it but when it's actually a revelation
[2:12:13] from God when it's from Our Father which
[2:12:15] is in heaven oh my nobody can take that
[2:12:18] from you nobody will ever be able to
[2:12:20] touch that
[2:12:22] maybe stand with me as we close out of
[2:12:24] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[2:12:27] the sardan age brother Bram he says and
[2:12:30] the way that it was done was by God's
[2:12:33] perfect will and
[2:12:35] programming the Lutheran had the Holy
[2:12:38] Ghost potentially under justification
[2:12:40] the methodists had it potentially under
[2:12:43] sanctification and today it's brought
[2:12:45] back a
[2:12:48] restoration the Holy Ghost is here amen
[2:12:51] we don't have to look for another
[2:12:52] messenger don't look for another
[2:12:53] messenger there's no other messenger
[2:12:55] there's people who are prophetic there's
[2:12:57] a prophetic class of people there's a
[2:12:59] lot going on don't look for another
[2:13:00] messenger all of the restoration has
[2:13:03] happened already we heard on Wednesday
[2:13:05] so good way better than I could say in
[2:13:07] the couple minutes we've got here you
[2:13:08] know what the whole entire word of God
[2:13:11] has been restored all of it has been
[2:13:13] restored all the Loose Ends have been
[2:13:15] tied up there might be other people that
[2:13:17] come and claim to be Messengers and
[2:13:19] that's fine but those people who know
[2:13:22] the word of God who have taken the word
[2:13:24] and hid it in their heart they know
[2:13:26] exactly what's gone on we're able to
[2:13:30] identify who we are as we close today I
[2:13:33] just want to read this one quote
[2:13:35] here talking about Father's
[2:13:38] Day and the importance of being a father
[2:13:42] and I would say a word-based father for
[2:13:45] the Bram this is out of questions and
[2:13:48] answers in 1959
[2:13:52] brother Bram he says God has give
[2:13:55] us the perfect assurance that we are his
[2:13:59] children isn't that
[2:14:01] wonderful and it just goes right in line
[2:14:04] with the scripture that we read this
[2:14:05] morning out of First John chapter
[2:14:08] 2 God has give us the perfect assurance
[2:14:12] that we are his children and as his
[2:14:14] children he corrects us just like I
[2:14:18] correct my children you correct your
[2:14:21] children when in the wrong we correct
[2:14:23] them if my children does wrong then it's
[2:14:26] my duty as a father to correct them and
[2:14:29] then if God's children does wrong it's
[2:14:32] his duty as a father and he will correct
[2:14:36] you he says just remember that you'll be
[2:14:40] corrected but remember brothers and
[2:14:44] sisters the chastening of this present
[2:14:47] time isn't
[2:14:48] worthy for the glory that's going to
[2:14:51] going to be revealed in
[2:14:52] us and if we're children then we're
[2:14:56] going to receive the correction and it's
[2:14:59] not about
[2:15:00] abuse True Believers don't abuse their
[2:15:03] children True Believers love their
[2:15:07] children I'm not getting into an example
[2:15:10] on how to deal with your children
[2:15:11] brothers and sisters I'm talking now
[2:15:14] spiritually how God deals with his
[2:15:16] children he will correct us if we're
[2:15:19] gone astray just like we talked about
[2:15:21] those children of Israel those others
[2:15:24] who were eatting from the king's table
[2:15:26] and drinking of the wine they were
[2:15:27] partaking of things that were wrong but
[2:15:30] God didn't leave them in error he
[2:15:32] corrected
[2:15:35] them and if my children does wrong then
[2:15:38] it's my duty as a father to correct them
[2:15:40] then if it's God's children does wrong
[2:15:43] it's his duty as a father and he will
[2:15:45] correct you just remember that you'll be
[2:15:46] corrected but as long as you're his
[2:15:48] child the world better keep their hands
[2:15:51] off you that's right for he said it's
[2:15:54] far better for you that a millstone was
[2:15:57] hanged at your neck and you were drowned
[2:15:59] in the depths of the sea than even to
[2:16:02] bring an offense upon one of these
[2:16:05] little ones that believe in me that's
[2:16:08] right what is that judgment going to be
[2:16:12] brothers and sisters if you're a son and
[2:16:14] a daughter of God his his will is truly
[2:16:17] his word and if you are a son and
[2:16:19] daughter of God then you'll just line up
[2:16:21] with his word that's all because that's
[2:16:22] his will that's what we want the will of
[2:16:24] the father in our lives God bless you
[2:16:26] today let's just bow in prayer gracious
[2:16:30] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you
[2:16:32] for your word thank you for the
[2:16:34] restoration of your word Lord thank you
