I trust you all feel right at home we have a couple more guests here from Edmonton and I think it would be wrong just to not mention them we have brother Joel Hildebrand and we have brother Seth Dole [Applause] they both attend anti-message Tabernacle in Edmonton certainly wonderful to have them here God bless you this morning let's just read from the book of Revelation chapter 1 verse 1. the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who was the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for this word we know that it is the same yesterday today and forever father we're so thankful that we can have the Revelation today in our hearts that the Lord just as powerful as it was that day that you stood before the tomb of Lazarus and you you wept as a man but you squared up your shoulders as God and you spoke the word and you said Lazarus come forth father we know that it's the same word today and father that same word will be there tomorrow as well father even if there isn't a tomorrow in time that word will be there father and Lord It's my prayer this morning that that word that very same word would be in every single individual that hears this message this morning Father Lord Jesus that even if there isn't a tomorrow in time oh father that each one of us would be as Eternal as that word is father be it unto us according to Thy word is our prayer we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning you may be seated for a few minutes I'll try not to keep us too long today you happy this morning you know if I could be anything I do believe that's exactly right just let me be an offering let me be a sacrifice unto the Lord let me not be a hindrance to the body let me not be a false witness of this word oh my you know sometimes we live in our lives and and our lives some people would say can bear false witness but you know what we're all humans we're all learning and growing and we're living our lives and God is working with each and every one of us we're all on a journey and I just love what uh brother Tom Ernest said once upon a time it just made perfect sense to me we are in a one-room schoolhouse there's people that are preschoolers and there's people that are University PHD graduates people who are super smart and and people who maybe just aren't as educated and I wouldn't say that someone isn't smart I would say the word will actually do the dividing there and we'll get into that a little bit later we're having a conversation in in in our truck on the way to church today I do apologize I'm going to fiddle with this it's poking me again I think I need a new one it's just like a needle going in my skin so forgive me if I get a little fidgety we're having a conversation today about being educated and you know what nobody is not smart I would say that some people just aren't as educated as other people now there's some people that would say well you have an IQ test and brother bear you can say some people are very intelligent and some people aren't intelligent well how do people get intelligent they usually get trained don't they they usually get taught it's not something that you just actually in kindergarten you understand all the things that you would when you're in grade 12 it's not the way it works but I caught myself speaking to Christopher on the way in today you know maybe you're not as smart when you're young and I I just felt so checked and corrected to say no that's not true that's not a true statement because you are just as smart you have intelligence you're just not grown yet you're just not mature yet and I thought how much more in the spiritual realm does that apply in our lives sometimes we can be very intelligent but spiritually speaking we're still growing and every one of us are and I'll say it this way brothers and sisters if we're not growing we're dying That's the Law of the universe if we're not growing then we're dying I heard a brother say it one time you know God is only interested in one thing and I thought wow that's fascinating only one thing and he said yeah spiritual growth he's not concerned about your house he's not concerned about your car he's not concerned about your bank accounts he's not concerned about your Investments he's not concerned about any of the the trivial things that we contend with in this world that are frivolous it's all going to burn the only thing he's interested in is that character that matches his word his life being lived out through us and so long as we are willing to actually subject ourselves to that that's where the intelligence comes in that's where the true spiritual growth happens it's just beautiful I don't know I got so inspired when I was thinking about it but you know I I just thought I would take a little bit of a different direction today as we're going to start in October it's hard to believe that uh you know we're already 17 days into September there's been times in Calgary I'm sure some of us can remember where we've had a foot of snow at this time already in Calgary but thanks be to God we've got some nice warm weather here and we'll just trust that the Lord will allow us to do what needs to be done before that winter time condition sets in I just wanted to take a little bit a look at at the Book of Revelation as we as we begin our study into uh the exposition of the seven Church ages in October I just wanted to do a little bit of background a little bit of foundational work a little bit of discussion about this and and we'll just see what the Lord will do before we go too far with it though we have some announcements we've got the Sunday communion happening tonight at six o'clock all is welcome all are welcome however you want to say that um we do have brother James Nevada Bandy here on Sunday October the 1st that was changed from September the 28th so if you haven't changed your calendar maybe just mark it down those are circumstances Beyond My Control if that becomes a bit of a frustration I I can't help it it's just the way it worked out so we are looking forward to seeing brother James here again um and again as I mentioned we will be doing the uh the study of the seven Church ages if anybody's interested in getting their hands on a book please let me know we have some in the back um they're dwindling now though but I ordered a whole bunch more because I think it's really important for us even if you just misplaced yours and and you want to have another one that you can maybe underline and highlight by all means just let me know I really want to take some time and study this I think there's so much in there that uh really will help us um we also just want to make a note that uh sister Rosie who's just been a wonderful addition to our congregation every single time she comes today will be her last service with us she's going back to India this week so please take the time to greet sister Rosie she's just a fine example of a real believer and it's wonderful to see that you know even in India this message of the hour has has definitely taken hold we had a wonderful time Thursday night at the prayer meeting just a wonderful time together and I just would like to encourage everyone you know if in our lives we have circumstances and situations if we want to see change in our lives then we've got to make a change in our lives and you know I'll just leave it there we cannot do what we always do and expect to see something different I've heard it said if you do what you've always done you're going to get what you've always got I say Lord help me we had a wonderful time though and uh I just would like to encourage anyone if you have the desire to see change in your life then maybe take a step of faith and just see if God won't do something for you um The Book of Revelation just a wonderful book in my life I was always drawn to it and uh I know that I actually got in trouble at one point I was given the opportunity to and I'd say it that way to go to a Christian School for a while and uh I remember there was a class they called religion and I'll never forget clearly how they explained the godhead in that class and even then I couldn't really understand it how can you take God and make him a triangle of three circles it just it just didn't add up to me I could never understand it it just didn't settle right with me and I would read this book of Revelation and and while they would be talking about this godhead Theory I would be reading this book of Revelation and and and with John as he was looking at the open door that was given to him when he was called to come up a little higher into heaven you know and I would just be thinking about that in the picture that was there how he saw one on the throne but yet here they are talking about three if that was the case why wouldn't he have seen three on the throne if it was three separate persons as the doctrine of the Trinity says but I just find it fascinating we could we could just start with the very first verse the revelation of Jesus Christ and that's all we need to say that's what we're doing that's what this is that's what the message of the hour is the revelation of Jesus Christ and what is the Revelation it's God himself revealing himself personally to the individual and we know that that's what the new birth is it's not some great theological debate or discussion which is what some folks want to make it it's not that at all it's a new birth it's dying out to the old self and allowing some other life to come and live inside of us but my goodness that takes a lot of humility to be able to do that but it's wonderful with this God that we serve we spoke about at the very beginning the same yesterday today and forever the same one that was there with Lazarus at the grave is the same one that's here with us right now I just think it's beautiful you know when we talked about it a little while ago how we have the opportunity we've invited him just like Simon the Pharisee but brother Brown talks about the Pharisee and how how much they were enemies of Jesus they did not like Jesus at all they had disdain for Jesus but yet he invited Jesus to his celebration but wasn't it interesting that it was a prostitute one who was ill-famed that actually took the money that she got from her business and bought that ointment that spikenard and anointed him before he was to be sacrificed it took a prostitute someone who was that filthy to come and actually anoint him even when the most religious folks of the day stood there saying why don't you show us a miracle and then we'll believe why don't you turn this water to wine why don't you do something fantastic for us here today give us a show and then laughing at him but it took this prostitute this one who wasn't worthy and something inside of her though it gave her the ability to understand what needed to happen and you know what that is that's revelation that was God making himself real to her because everyone else said no way don't do it why would you allow this woman just like when Jesus said you know he had the needs to go by the way of Samaria he went and sat down on Jacob's Well didn't he he sent the disciples away to go and get some vittles they needed some food and they knew what time of day it was and they thought Master why do you want to sit here now don't you know what time of day it is don't you know what's gonna happen here you got the potential to be connecting yourself with ill-famed women but here he goes and sits down and they leave him and what happens the ill-famed woman comes out and it took an ill-famed woman to run into the city to say hey come and take a look at a man who's told me the things that I've done and what happened we know the whole city believed her but she was the ill-famed woman she was The Prostitute once again isn't it interesting to think brothers and sisters God doesn't do things the way the most religious people think that he should do it God does things the way God does things and we know for sure that if you trace the lineage of Jesus Christ when he came into the world he didn't come through the purebred bloodline of all of the Saints did he you can trace it right back to the Scarlet thread the woman who actually was cut the deal with the spies who was that woman that woman was an ill-famed woman too wasn't she in Jericho but they said just take this cord this chord let it be a an accord between us and thee and you make sure that you put that cord on display that Scarlet colored cord I remember brother Harold Hildebrandt preaching on that one time it just struck me so significantly the Scarlet thread and how it just goes through all the Bible all the way along just so you preached a masterpiece on that but isn't it interest testing it was the ill-famed woman again but that was the lineage of Jesus Christ take it back to the Bible and see if it's not true Jesus chose to come that way that's where we have to say brothers and sisters it wasn't Mary and it wasn't Joseph it was God it wasn't it wasn't God plus Mary it was God plus God in Mary and even Mary she had to have her own Upper Room experience but I just think this is beautiful this this is This Book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him God gave unto who God gave unto Jesus God wanted to reveal himself so he gave this Revelation to Jesus Jesus gave this Revelation unto John the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and I just think it's beautiful we could stop there and talk for a little bit because we know as Believers of the message of the hour that this is something that somewhere somehow sometime along the way this had to be revealed didn't it it has to Somewhere in Time and I'm sure that maybe theologians would say sure it has to happen Somewhere in Time there has to be an event a place a time where something becomes revealed to the people but the word says it must shortly come to pass now some people would say well it's already happened years and years ago and we're already in the Millennium and there's other people that will say well it's it's got to happen somewhere out there in the future but we had a prophet of God a messenger from God a man that God chose to use as his messenger his voice box as a major prophet to deliver a message unto the people that this is actually happening every single time you read this book it's unveiling it's revealing because if you go on further verse 3 says blessed is he that readeth and I think it's beautiful because you don't even have to read this book because it says and they that heareth this book so if we just listen to the Book of Revelation we're blessed for it but I think it's wonderful because it doesn't apply just to the Book of Revelation we don't want to take God and put them in a box and say that these words are only applicable to the Book of Revelation even though it's written in the Book of Revelation I'm not going to take it and try and spin it into something that it's not but I would say if you listen to this word of God you're blessed doesn't matter whether it's Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy Joshua Judges Ruth whatever it is all the way through any Scripture you're blessed by it just don't add to it or try and take away from it that's the key but I want to get to this part today you know um the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John I just want to take that and I'm probably going to stop there we'll maybe bounce around a little bit but I just think that's so rich it's so packed we'll take some time and try and unpack it a little bit but isn't it wonderful to think that he is the same yesterday today and forever and he did send and signify this message to a group of people isn't it wonderful to think that John is a type of the Bride so if we could just take John's name out of there just put your name in there he he sent and signified it what does the word signified mean it means to explain it means to show it means to declare it means to reveal he signified it himself by his angel unto John I think it's just amazing to think that we have been given the ability to see it we've been given the ability to recognize it who we are where we are at that he himself has come and signified it he sent it but then he came to signify it by his Angel and you know what what am I saying by that I'll say it plainly his Angel messenger we know that we can talk in the Bible and and angels are are called men it's not just that there was an angel that came to visit many times the the the the description in the scripture will say a man came to me I turned and I saw a man it's a description of a man a man a man and why would that be any different today why would it be any different today that it would be an angel we could say angel or a man the word of God says that many people entertain angels unawares we need to make sure that we understand where we stand that who we're talking to and I think it's wonderful because we could say you know if we saw an Angel Today wow we would have reverence for him wouldn't we we know that John tried to bow down twice in the Book of Revelation and worship that angel but what happened that angel said see don't do it not I'm I'm a fellow servant don't do that get up and worship God he's the one that we worship we don't worship men we don't worship angels we don't worship other men even prophets we don't worship them we worship God that's all and you know there's uh there's another story in the Bible I think it's even with Cornelius I could be wrong he desired to worship when Peter went to him and he got the Holy Ghost he got so inspired he got a little Pentecostal he wanted to worship Peter said don't do it no way the Same Spirit don't worship a man worship God I want to say that today brothers and sisters don't worship a man Calgary Living Word assembly ain't about Worship in men the message of the hour is not about Worship in men the message of the hour is about worshiping God and if anybody brings another message anything besides what Paul preached let him be accursed it's a revelation of Jesus Christ which God sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John so I just want to say it today you know what he has sent and signified it by his Angel I'll say it this way I'll say it plainly by his Angel William Miriam Branham to this generation because this is a type of John the Bride of Jesus Christ we have such an absolute privilege I can't even express it this morning what I feel have you ever thought about that how incredible is it that we're able to hear these words that we're able to receive these words that were able to be a part of this and and maybe not in a great way in terms of doing great things for the message of the hour you know what we don't have to do great things for the message of the hour the message of the hour will do great things for itself just like we don't have to make excuses for the word of God the word of God will actually defend itself so if we get caught up trying to defend the word of God you know what there's something maybe a little bit Askew I would say God will deal with it himself but you know looking at this this this revelation of Jesus Christ I trust that that's what's happened to every single one of us today we have to have the revelation of Jesus Christ and we know that William Branham he preached a message titled Christ is the mystery of God revealed not Christ is the mystery of three persons revealed Christ is the mystery of God revealed God decided to come in flesh and he used the word and morphe and that means just changing of a mask to go from one to the other how could we as human beings how could we say how God should do doesn't it say in the word that you know how can the pot say to the Potter how I should be how can we do that how could we say that God cannot change masks that God cannot operate through three positions three offices one God it's so important for us to know this I think it's wonderful and the reason I'm going this way I I had a conversation with someone who was very much trinitarian and very much wanted to express to me how important it was for me to understand that this trinitarian Doctrine is actually correct and when you start to get into Oneness Doctrine which is what he called me because of what he he just sort of slung on me you know what do you believe and I kind of told him a little bit I didn't tell him a lot but he said all your Oneness your Oneness and so he's trying to pigeonhole me in that position and I'm like hold on a second just relax but he said it's really important that you understand this Doctrine and I say why is that why are we having such a a discussion here what's the problem man aren't we believers I'm not looking to see what you believe I'm not pushing my agenda you're the one coming after me but hey if you want to talk about it let's talk about it one God three offices now I would step back and say well why couldn't it be God who would say that's three persons let's just be the advocate for a moment because it's possible it's God right but it's not God's that's the problem as soon as you put the plural on it you make it three individuals three persons is three individuals and that is exactly what the message of the hour said you can't take God and cut them into three pieces and give them to a believer you know that brother Bradham said you can't cut God in three pieces and give them to a Jew but I would say you can't give them to a Believer either it's not three persons it's one person the Lord Jesus Christ the mystery of God revealed and you know once you see it it's so simple but it can be so difficult to get Beyond those teachings you know the Catholic Church says give me a child till the age of five and we'll have them for life how much of the Catholic Doctrine is taken and actually preached to people in different churches different denominations different schools I think if we were to take a close look at it we would see it's quite prevalent but you know I'm not here to slam the Catholic church I'm not here to slam anyone the only thing I want to do is is represent this word of God and the revelation of Jesus Christ to the church today it's got to be a Living Word brothers and sisters not not some word from the past that some man had some great ministry and I'm sure that people would be getting upset with me right now because I may be saying something slight against the prophet I'm not saying anything slight against the prophet but I'll tell you what the prophet said the moment you try and make me anything more than what I am you make me Antichrist I'm your brother so I just want to present Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever out of 1960 1204m the revelation of Jesus Christ if you want to see where some of my Inspirations coming from for all of the discussion now as we head into this uh study of the exposition of the seven Church ages this message here is a real good place to start the radam says now we're holding the fourth and sixth verse in view both of them are the same let's just pause there for a second and just read them the first verse in Revelations chapter 1 it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he has sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John jump down to verse six and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever they don't sound the same to me do they sound the same to you but here we have brother Brad I'm saying now we're holding the fourth and sixth verse in view both of them are the same one says to he which was which is which is to come what's he trying to put before the church his deity today people try to make him a prophet he's more than a prophet and some people try to make him three Gods he's not three gods he's one God that live in three offices three manifestations of the same God I don't know where that becomes so complicated other than the schooling maybe where we get a degree and and we pass the test based on the answers that are asked the questions that are asked for the excuse me the answers that we give and all it is is studying the theological program this is what they're teaching this is what we need to actually explain it's not three Gods he's one God that lived in three offices three manifestations of the same God now remember this is the revelation and whosoever heareth it and don't keep the sayings of this book his part will be taken from The Book of Life Jesus is not revealing himself as three gods but one God in three offices oh it's going to get rich after a while when we get into those Church ages and see where they lost that it caused a great split at the niacin Council both of them went off on deep ends and this is where I think it's absolutely beautiful if we just take a breath and we just take a look and we're willing to just examine what's being said here it's so beautiful because he's not putting it off on one and saying one is terrible and putting it off on the other and saying the other one is terrible he's saying they're both just off they're just wrong but if you just look at the middle come back to the middle of it you can actually see the truth of the matter says they both went off on deep ends at the Nicene Council and they'd done the same thing in this last days again just like a pre-nicene council again because there will be another one and I'll bring it later on brothers and sisters there is a modern Nicene Council that's actually happened I'll bring it and and we'll talk about it but he says it here as a prophet it the same thing in this last days again just like a pre-nician council again because there will be another one just as certain as I'm standing here the Catholic and Protestant churches will unite something together or agree with one another does anybody remember the the the the the video that brother Ken presented of Tony Palmer in the states with uh with The ecumenical council boy oh boy and it explained exactly what brother Brown was talking about here he said you know what Luther's protest was then but the protest is over he said that there was an amends made between I think it's the Lutheran Church and the Catholic church and he brought it himself he went and made amends and they signed the document this is in the last decade in our world that we live in here we have a Prophet this is in 1960 I believe saying that they will happen again and now we have that the protest is over and he said so being that the protest is over and that the the name Catholic means Universal what's what's your protest and you know the interesting thing is that brother Branham brought was that you know it's the Harlot the great Harlot and then her daughters whether we understand it or not all of the denominational churches are falling under the headship of Rome all of them and it will come to the place we have the prophecy and people would say well now you're getting crazy talking about prophecy but we've got the prophecy that says there will come a time where you will either Kiss the Ring you'll say that I will just say you know it's going to be the best for the church to actually keep the doors open we don't want to actually have to close the doors and maybe have home church and be a bunch of weirdos on the street that are are singing the Praises of Jesus what we want to do is actually keep it calm and cool so we'll just say okay I'll sign the document and we'll fall under that headship and we'll keep the doors open there's churches that will do that there's others that will say I need a job I need a meal ticket I've got to stay in a position so long as I can feed my family but we got a prophet that said you know what when that happens watch the third poll then watch what happens then when they really try to put the squeeze on people and they really try to shut the churches of the Living God down then you'll see a short powerful demonstration of the life of Jesus Christ if you want to take away our food go ahead God will provide because we're going to live on every single word that proceeds out of the mouth of God we're not going to actually rely on natural bread brother Bradham says and they've done the same thing in this last days again just like a pre-nicene council again because there will be another one just as certain as I'm standing here the Catholic and Protestant churches will unite something together or agree with one another look at the Archbishop of Canterbury over there now all of it's heaping right up together and there's not a Triune God teaching in the Bible there's one God as true even the trinitarians will say that there's not a Triune teaching in the Bible but they'll say the Great Commission was you know to go into the world and baptized in the name of the father name of the son and the name of the Holy Ghost but if you listen to that statement it says names so who's the names we've gone over and over and over with this but I think it's just so important brothers and sisters we need to understand it we need to recognize it maybe somebody here today just doesn't really get it and that's the reason why we're going this way I don't know but we we just need to keep talking about it stirring up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance he says and it's revealed here in the Book of Revelation that the whole Canon of scriptures might be proven here and Christ set his seal upon it that's it if anyone takes away or adds to it the same will be taken out of the book of life for him so approach this not selfishly approach this with an open heart and an open mind I think that's so beautiful if we could just do that if if we could just look at it with an open heart and an open mind I believe God would reveal himself further to us we all want to go further with Christ we all want a greater Revelation I don't think any one of us wants to stay in the same position that we're at and and you know maybe some of this is is just just Elementary for the veteran Believers but maybe there's someone here in this one-room schoolhouse that's never really understood what this means I think it's beautiful because I'll say it this way if we have an open mind and an open heart we're not looking for a fight in fact when we believe this truth this message of the hour we're not looking for a fight we're not looking to go and get in our our our co-workers faces and our friends faces and our neighbors faces and put our finger in their nose and try and ramrod some Doctrine about this this this Oneness of God down their throat about the message of the hour we're not doing that and you know brothers and sisters when we see that when we see people claiming the message of the hour but looking to fight about it I want to say this there's something wrong it's not the right Spirit of Christ never went and fought against anyone the only thing that he did was he called out the most religious people of the day because he knew exactly where who they were and what they needed to do but that doesn't give us license to go and behave that way we need to live the life of Jesus Christ and that life is of love and of understanding and of forgiveness we talked about forgiveness last week are you your brother's keeper the week before are you your brother's keeper if we've got the attitude that we're not our Brother's Keeper then whose Spirit are we displaying but the battle says no the Nicene Council they come to two great decisions oh many of them in that day of the early church fathers they had two extreme views one of them was a Triune God a trinitarian and the other was a one God and they both come into existence and went out on two straight limbs out like that the tri-unity became a place of a three God person the Oneness became a Unitarian just as far wrong as the other one was so they both went out on limbs but right here reveals the truth right in the middle reveals the truth Jesus could not be his own father neither if he had a father outside of the Holy Spirit then he is an illegitimate child it's Joseph's child he's illegitimate and not the Holy Ghost conceived them and he said God was his father so the Holy Ghost and God that's Matthew 1 18 if the Holy Ghost and God has to be the same person or he had two daddies he just explains it so good doesn't he how could he have two daddies he can't so how can you say three persons especially when Jesus he told his disciples and he told everyone that was around him that day when they picked up stones to Stone him he didn't say I and my father are three or I and my father are too because that's really what it would have been the other two I and my father are one I and my father are why would he say that if it was three persons he says that's Matthew 1 18. it's the Holy Ghost and God has to be the same person or he's two daddies and he was called Emmanuel which is God With Us how could Jesus be God if it's three persons I just I was so fascinated with that a little while ago Emmanuel God With Us it just makes it so plain you just start to see it everywhere in the scripture it's not something that's a great mystery even though it is a mystery until God reveals it because we can talk about it till we're blue on the face but until God removes that Veil we're going to be blinded to it you know brothers and sisters it's only because he's removed that Veil from our eyes from our spiritual eyes from our hearts from our minds that we're able to see this truth there's no nothing in us that Puffs us up to say oh I was born into the message so I've got some special seating at the table you're a sinner saved by grace it's only through faith that we're saved lest any man should boast my goodness we're all the same that way we're all Sinners saved by grace but Emmanuel it's God With Us he he claimed when he was here on Earth that he was that he and the father was one says I got all the scriptures written out here so that if you could find if we had this this question or something strongly recommend just looking at this message if there's any questions he does have it all listed out and perhaps we'll get into it a little bit further I was having a conversation with myself this week I'm pretty good at doing it you know just thinking about the word I think about how the Devil comes around and tempts us and just tries to hang a number on all of us and he knows exactly where our weaknesses lie he knows exactly what our our parents maybe genetic strains are he knows all about it sometimes better than we do and he's always trying to get us always throwing banana peels in our path but I was having a conversation with myself about this topic and you know it just occurred to me that Satan really doesn't believe that we will believe Satan believes the word of God better than anyone because remember we talked about it I believe last time we were here Satan used to be the right-hand man of God he was his right hand agent he was the one who was there he was the Archangel created co-equal with God Sans the ability to create so he's got all of the ability but the only thing that he can do now is pervert since the fall but I was thinking about it you know he believes the word of God he knows that his time is short and that's why he has his guns trained on the Bride of Jesus Christ so while I was having this conversation with myself I thought man I I struggle sometimes it feels like I just can never overcome certain things they just continually come back and continually come up and continually come back constantly in my life but you know what it ain't gonna stop me I'm not looking at that I'm looking at the word I'm looking at the promise we're going to be with him we're gonna actually be with him we're gonna actually be able to touch him we're gonna actually be able to talk to him face to face there's coming a time where he's going to wipe away all the tears and I want to say this brothers and sisters when that time comes those aren't going to be just tears of Sadness and Sorrow those are going to be tears of joy recognizing that we're Sinners saved by grace that we've made it all the struggles that we went through were worth it every single Mountain that we had to climb it was worth every minute so I just wanted to say today brothers and sisters we could probably end the service right here but we're not gonna but you know what if you believe you have already gone beyond what Satan has the capacity to believe he doesn't even have the capacity to understand that you can believe the word of God that you can take this book and eat it up and that it will be bitter in your belly sweet as honey in your mouth my goodness we've been keeping bees in the honey that you get from bees is pretty sweet it's wonderful but you know what sometimes our bellies get a little bit bitter don't they Satan doesn't even have the ability to believe that we believe that's why he comes around and tempts us over and over and over and over and you know brothers and sisters there has been Believers throughout all of the ages and they've only been able to live under the light that they've been shown throughout all of those ages but I want to say this to us this morning take courage brothers and sisters because we have been given something that other ages haven't been given and that is the ability to overcome all of the devil but even though we have these Temptations in our lives and we continually fall down just remember this what's the desire in your heart do you still desire to serve God because if you still desire to serve God you've already got Satan beat he's all ready to defeated being in your life but he's not going to believe that and he's not going to let you believe that but I just want to say believe it brothers and sisters I got to do a little uh a little devotional it's strange but true I've had a couple opportunities to do it at a place called Trinity retirement Lodge and it's a place for old folks and old folks home and Lord willing I would like to get some musicians and some people that can sing maybe around Christmas time and go there and and maybe just witness to them through song I've got the door open for that and I'm just cultivating that but I've been asked to go and take some morning devotionals to these people and uh I'll tell you it's interesting because they're very much trinitarian and very much of of the the belief that they have and I don't even know what their beliefs are I just know that they they're they're in the Trinity Lodge but you know it's wonderful because I'm like Lord what can I say to them I don't want to go and talk about this heavy Doctrine and try and change their thinking that way I want to go and show them your life so how do I do that I just show them your love I believe that's what he showed me so I went there on Thursday and I just said to them you know what take courage brothers and sisters there was maybe eight people or ten people there just the word of God says he that believeth on me shall not come into the condemnation but shall have everlasting life these are people the The Pianist that was playing she said you know I I I just hope that by the next time you come here I'll be already gone this is the position of these people I shook her hand and I said take courage sister just believe just believe that's all you got to do there's no form of godliness that you can try and display try and work anything up just believe if you can believe then all things are possible I think it's wonderful God's moving in a certain way and uh I'm just going to keep going as long as those doors are open I'll keep going to do the morning devotionals for them it's certainly wonderful to just see the Lord move but remember Satan doesn't believe that we will believe but as long as you can believe as long as you can say I believe you got them beat Satan is already beat right there because the word of God says that you're already seated in Heavenly places don't get stuck in Revelation or in Romans chapter 7 where Paul recognizes when I want to do good evil as president and every time that I I try and fix it I just stumble and fall down again and I do evil and over and over again I just can't get past myself and in the end of that chapter we know that he says oh what a Wretched Man I am who's going to deliver me of this body don't get stuck there brothers and sisters it can happen just go flip the page go to rev go go to Romans chapter 8. there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus if you believe you're in Christ Jesus Satan wants you to stay stuck there he wants you to believe you're defeated he's defeated you're an overcomer I think it's wonderful to look at this scripture here you know Revelations chapter 1 verse one and I just thought about it I said it already the definition of signified and if you look it up you can you can see that it it is sealing it's it's revealing it's explaining it's exposing there's a bunch of different um Jewish descriptions that will go along with it or Hebrew descriptions that will go along with it out of the Strong's Concordance I don't want to really go too far into it but I think it's just worth talking about he sent and signified he sent and explained it he sent and revealed it by his Angel unto his servant John I just want to say it you know what he sent it and signify it by his Angel unto his servant the bride his wife the Bride of Jesus Christ because the word says blessed are they that read if you ever read this word brothers and sisters you are blessed already Satan hates that he hates the fact that you are blessed and remember we know the prophet said it and we know all of us know it that he hates two books in the Bible more than any books one of them is the Book of Genesis that shows where he first was exposed where he first was shown where the fall came in and what really happened in the Garden of Eden and the Book of Revelation one shows his beginning and one shows his ending and you know what happens this word of God doesn't show your beginning and ending this word of God shows your beginning and your Eternal destination there's no Eternal health Satan isn't going to burn for eternity all the Sinners that get cast into the Lake of Fire aren't going to burn for eternity they're going to burn forever and ever but that's still a space of time and we don't know how long that is but they're going to actually be there for a while but they that read are blessed I just think it's so beautiful because even if we don't read it even if we believe it but we don't read it and we just maybe we don't have that much strength maybe we're just busy in our lives maybe we're just fussed with our jobs and we've got all these pressures in our lives because we're busy people as long as you hear it you're still blessed you know I'm talking that way because I've been there I've done it I know what it's like to be so busy that I can't take the time out for God but that doesn't change the fact that you're still blessed as long as you hear it so if you're coming to church brothers and sisters you're hearing it there's a blessing in store you know talking about this scripture the Revelation or or apocalypse the revealing the unveiling the explanation of of the word of God what does it mean what does it really mean and I just think it's so beautiful it just goes back to a revelation is is an explanation it's an unveiling it's it's it's an exposing of of an idea or a thought right it's it's showing the idea or the thought and and Jesus to his disciples they said to Jesus Once Upon a Time what what might this mean talking about a parable and it's no wonder that Jesus wrote the Book of Revelation as a book of symbols is it because he didn't send his word for everyone he would that everyone would repent and be saved he would that everyone would prosper and be in good health but not everyone is given the ability to actually receive the word of God we know that Jacob he loved and he saw he hated but what did Esau do Esau didn't do anything according to the word of God Esau was the perfect child wasn't he he was always tending to the father's wish he was always doing what the father wanted Jacob was a troublemaker Jacob loved to bug his brothers and sisters he liked to poke fun at them all the time he liked to do things that were maybe just a little bit different a little bit uh off color for what maybe was right in the tradition of the family but God chose him over the one who was the the most well-behaved why is that it's God's choice it's election that's where I think it just becomes so incredibly humbling if we have the ability to receive this word if we really truly believe the message of the hour goodness sakes brothers and sisters we've got more than probably we could even comprehend we've got way more than we could comprehend and I think Lord help me because I don't even comprehend it but to know that we are given the ability to have eternal life I was having this other conversation with myself the other day what what are you going to be thinking about what are you going to be talking about brothers and sisters the moment the Rapture takes place where are you going to be what are you going to be experiencing who are you going to be talking to just like I've been thinking many times about you know how how certain people are where they're at I was fishing with my fishing buddy brother Larry Halverson a week ago and and he asked me to take his mother's funeral and I was so humbled by that I was just a new pastor and I went out to inform here and I did that for him it was such an honor and a privilege but we got talking about his mother and and he said how much of an honor it was to have me there and I thought my goodness how many other ministers would there be that would be real ministers to do that but he chose me his family did and I just thought it was so humbling and so we had a bit of a conversation you know I was just thinking brother Larry who's your mama talking to right now and what's she saying go catch that other fish keep going don't give up keep pressing on the same words the prophet of God heard you know but where are you going to be you what are you going to be doing when that happens because there's going to be a secret sudden going away of the Bride of Jesus Christ it's going to happen any day Nobody Knows the day or the hour many people have poked at it and prodded at it and tried to mathematically understand it and explain it and reveal it but we know that no man knows a day or the hour not even the angels in heaven not even the son Jesus Christ but the father himself he knows the time Hallelujah you know it takes a revelation to really understand the word of God the only way we can understand the word of God is through Revelation and that's through God's spirit making it known unto us and that's why brothers and sisters I'll say it today this will be my plug for it get the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost in your life if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're not going to understand the word of God we will not truly get the understanding of the word of God outside of him revealing it to us individually but when he does that we'll have the ability to say Amen to the word because we'll get the fact that there's a blessing in store every time we hear the word of God spoken there's a blessing there but in Luke chapter 8 verse 5 brother or Jesus he says A sower went out to sow his seed maybe turn there with me to Luke chapter eight sorry I get excited and ahead of myself Luke chapter 8 verse 5. we'll just talk a little bit about Revelation here I think Branham says in the church age book the exposition of the seven Church ages that Revelation means more to the believer than we think revelation to the believer it means a lot more than we can actually realize here we have Jesus saying to his disciples A sower went out this is verse 5 of Luke chapter 8 to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprang up with it choked it and the other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit on hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear I just want to stop there for a second and just explain this we all know it but for those who don't when we hear about the seven churches we know that there is actually a description John has given the invitation to make an explanation to the seven churches which are in Asia at the ending of each one of those exhortations for the churches the same words are said he that hath an ear let him hear have you ever heard his voice before if you have you'll know what I mean when you can hear his voice yourself I'm not saying an audio voice booming in the airwaves coming to you but it's inside the heart when you've heard his voice before you'll recognize it because he doesn't change and isn't it interesting that he would have the same words that he spoke to his disciples and Luke that he spoke to John on the Isle of Patmos the same voice the same words he that hath an ear let him hear verse 9 says and his disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand how could we have the ability to understand because God chose you he chose you to believe he chose you to be triumphant over Satan not because of Any works that you've done not because of Any display you could display not because of any words you could speak just because you could say Amen to the word of God you believe the word of God that's what does it for you and when you believe the word of God then you'll line up with the word of God you won't just say that I believe the word of God and go and live another life that's impossible let's turn over to Matthew chapter 13. while we're at it well we've got some scriptures here I think there's some real important points that I just want to bring out with this talking about revelation same story different perspective a different man's view of it we'll start with verse 1 of Matthew chapter 13. the same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the seaside and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore and he spake many things unto them in Parables saying behold A sower went forth to sow and when he sowed some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and devoured them up some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth and forth with they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprung up and choked them out but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some hundredfold and 60-fold some 30-fold who hath ears to hear let him hear we know the word of God goes on to explain this and Lord willing we'll get into that a little bit this morning but I just think it's wonderful when we look at this how we could say that we would fit that description in verse 8 but other fell into good ground the seed that the sower was sowing fell into good ground and what happened it brought forth fruit some 100 fold some 60 fold some 30-fold and some might even be one-fold but so long as you brought forth fruit so long as you actually were able to spring up and have life because there's a description in here just before that about how some seeds were sown in different places and you know some were on Stony ground and those seeds were there and they still were able to spring up but what happened once they sprung up brother Branham talks about the message of the hour in different places someone came and stepped on their toes said something that was offensive to them oh my they said that to me first I thought I was amongst Angels now I think I'm amongst Devils I can't go to church anymore because this happened you know brother Ken used to say it often any excuse is good enough when you really don't want to do something but what happens is people don't have the ability sometimes to have a root that actually goes down into good ground aren't you thankful for someone that would give the description that when the roots can go down into the ground the wind blows and causes the tree to sway to bend back and forth and the reason for that brothers and sisters so that those roots holding it into the ground they stretch and hold and oh they struggle sometimes they can't hold on and the whole tree will fall over but the ones that don't fall over those roots stretch and they caused holes looseness in the soil and what happens is those roots grow deeper and deeper and deeper it doesn't stop the winds from blowing but those trees they're in good ground and I want to say today if you have the ability to stay holding on You've Got Roots in the ground brothers and sisters you got reason to Rejoice we have every reason to just rejoice and thank God for the ability to have those roots that haven't just been been popped out and and so shallow that there's no experience to hold you there and as soon as the sun s-o-n of the word of God comes on the scene it doesn't cause us to wither up and die the preacher gives a spanking from the pulpit spiritually speaking we don't get all offended and upset and say oh I can't go back to see that brother he just always talks about this one thing a certain way I just can't do that no we say you know what Lord have mercy maybe that brother needs to have his own Revelation maybe his roots need to grow a little deeper we have the ability to pray for one another not get upset but let's go on to read here verse 10 of of Matthew chapter 13. remember Jesus said in verse 9 he who hath ears to hear Let Him hear the same one that we just read about over in Luke the same one that we know is in the Book of Revelation he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear and the disciples came and said unto him why speak as though unto them in parables and what does he say verse 11 he answered and said unto them because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but to them it's not given so I think we could just pause there and we will and and I just want to take some time with this so you know I'm not going to keep us here long I can see time is running out but brothers and sisters we can read this verse here by Revelation because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it's not given someone is going to be given the ability to understand the mysteries of Heaven the Kingdom of Heaven not everyone is going to be able to understand it and that's okay that's God's choice I want to say it this way from a believer's perspective we have the ability to potentially potentially impart eternal life to those people who haven't been given the ability to understand it not the ability to judge them and say oh you deserve Eternal condemnation or or damnation we know brother Bradham said it and I believe it's the spirit of Christ very clearly we wouldn't wish it on our worst enemy what's on the other side that's why I think when we come to church brothers and sisters we've got the every reason to Rejoice this is the place where we can literally make the window blinds rattle from the worship that we've got here because we understand what it means to be Believers we understand what it means to be redeemed now some people would say oh I don't have the ability to worship that way and that's okay you don't if you don't have that ability to worship that way that's just fine but don't judge those that do just like those that do don't judge those that don't but if it gets a little bit loud in here brothers and sisters this is the quietest place we're ever going to be in the church age book the one that we're talking about here brother Branham he says we have every reason to get loud every reason to Rejoice the whole entire world can jump up and down at their ball games you ever go to a game a hockey game a football game you ever go to one of those they'll be sitting there and they'll be watching the play and it'll just be happening but all of a sudden they'll jump up and they'll start screaming and yelling because the stupid piece of rubber is getting broken away down the ice and gonna be in a net are you kidding me have you ever seen people express it that way there's a touchdown made in football people get right excited over sports but what about the word of God what about the Mysteries being revealed to you it's not given to everyone to know the mystery but when we've been given the ability to understand the mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven Heaven Christ is the mystery of God revealed wow maybe it's just simply this today brothers and sisters let's not take it for granted let's not take for granted this tremendous gift that we've been given let's go on to read here verse 12. it says for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever shall have not from him shall be taken away even that he hath I just want to say it's not money I'm not talking about money here some people will try and monetize this and you can sure God will bless you for sure and he'll give you more but if it's as shallow as money I I don't know I think we should have a prayer meeting verse 13 says therefore speak I to them in Parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand they can see the word of God standing there right before them they can hear his voice speaking he that hath an ear let them hear what the spirit saith unto the church but they don't have the ability to hear it because they're not hearing with their ears he's talking about hearing with your heart therefore speak I to them in Parables because seeing they see not hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them it's fulfilled the prophecy of isaiahs which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceive for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed that just jumped out at me today when I was studying this real early today their eyes they have closed so they can't hear it they can't see it but they see it and and they hear it but they can't understand it so what do they do they close their eyes they don't want anything to do with it Lord have mercy lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them we know that John he wanted to see a little further and and and talk about the mysteries of what was spoken in the Thunders but he was told you know what seal up those things John and and write them not because they're not for your day they're not for your time but there is a time and there is a day and there is a people that will have the ability to receive what was hidden what was sealed up in those Thunders and I want to say it today brothers and sisters that's you that's us that's our day we've been given the ability to understand those Thunders and Lord willing we'll get into them in time but you know here we have Jesus instructing them that these people's heart is waxed gross boy oh boy we can look around this world and say that this world's heart is wax gross we're rich and we're increased with goods and we have need of nothing we don't have the need to go to church why would you go to church on a Sunday I remember living in that world anybody else here remember that in their lives why would you go to church on a Sunday I remember in Calgary when I was a kid everything was closed on a Sunday there might be a gas station open in case you had an emergency and you needed some gas but everything was closed how much has this world changed everything is open on a Sunday now even more stuff sometimes it's the world we live in this this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of here and they don't want to hear Christianity you know what maybe the Christian church at best maybe Catholic Behavior at best but when you start to talk about Mysteries and and Prophets and the message of the hour their hearts of wax gross their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they've closed don't talk to me about a prophet oh my that's crazy talk why would you be doing that because that's where the truth lies that's why I'd be doing it that's why we do it that's why we talk about it is because that's the truth for our day but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear the things which ye hear have not heard them and he goes on to say here ye therefore the parable of the sower now I'm going to explain it to you when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which receive a seed by the wayside they hear the message of the hour and they think oh William Miriam Branham interesting man but you know there's a lot of interesting men in this world God's used a lot of men in this world and and the days of of Prophecy prophets that was over in the apostolic age with the disciples there's no such thing as that you know what he says it right here we go out to verse 20 but he that received the seed into Stony places the same as he that heareth the word and Anon with joy receive it oh just love it it's wonderful to hear the message of the hour goes on to say yet he yet hath he no root in himself but Dura for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he's offended something trips him up he just can't do it nope can't go on anymore that brother said that thing that brother didn't say that thing maybe somebody else did another thing and we said it earlier any excuse is good enough when you don't want to do it yet he hath no root in himself but dearth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by He Is offended he also that received seed among the Thorns as he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful I just want to say I hope nobody is becoming unfruitful because of riches riches are fine God will bless us but we need to be careful that we're not actually deceived by the riches because we can get so many riches and so busy with all of our riches managing all of our riches that it will choke out the word of God it'll cause us to not be able to come to church it'll cause us to be so busy that we can't take time in prayer we'll be so fussed with the riches in this world that we will choke out the word of God in our lives but I want to say I'm believed that I'm talking to Believers here and verse 23 says but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth my word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some 100-fold and another some 60 and some 30. I just think this is so beautiful brother and sisters because there's some people that will not be able to receive the word but some people are able to receive the word and if we're able to receive the word in our day the revelation of Jesus Christ then we have every single reason to Rejoice every single reason to give God praise every single reason to serve him with all of our heart because we recognize that we're already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus maybe we don't feel like it has anybody ever felt like you're sitting in Heavenly places maybe sometimes when we come to church and we have a great service but when I go and sit in my truck and start driving no I don't feel like I'm seeing heavily places I look around and I see road rage I look around and I see wickedness pictures and things that I just would rather not see it's the world we live in but the word of God says that I'm already seated in Heavenly places and I choose to believe that over top of every single thing that I see with my eyes or here with my ears because it's the word of God that makes all the difference remember we were talking about this I'll touch on this as we call the musicians you know what who whosoever sends ye remit they are remitted unto them we have been given a responsibility in our day as the Bride of Jesus Christ we have the ability to go to the father on behalf of our brother on behalf of our sister and the word of God says that whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained we said this before I just want to say it again where are they retained brothers and sisters it might be easy to say that they're retained up in heaven but I personally my view is that we are retaining we are holding on to those sins and I don't think we want to do that you know over in Proverbs 26 if you want to turn over there quickly with me I just think it's beautiful how the Lord does this um I often wondered how would I ever have enough enough to say in in an hour an hour and a half and there's never enough time and I just want to be respectful you know I I don't want to try and keep us long but in Proverbs 26 verse 9 talking about parables this really caught my attention today as a thorn the Proverbs 26 verse 9 is a pro as a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard so is a parable in the mouth of fools now I don't know if anybody here has ever been drunk and I'm not looking for a show of hands but unfortunately I can say to you that I've experienced this very thing and you know when it happens you don't feel it you don't you hear about people that fall down in the winter time when they're drinking they usually don't get hurt people who are drinking who are in severe car accidents usually don't get hurt not nearly as bad as the people who weren't expecting things to happen the people who actually weren't drinking they actually really feel the effects really painfully but unfortunately with a fool someone who is drunk they don't feel it until afterwards until the alcohol wears off and then suddenly their thorn in their flesh in their hand where they fell they're thinking my goodness what is that why do I feel that there oh no but if they weren't drinking they wouldn't have fallen and that thorn wouldn't have went in and if you don't ever if you've never experienced this God bless you but I want to just take a moment to explain it a parable of the word of God in the mouth of a fool is just like that because they don't even understand what happened to them it just happened so fast the parable is just in one ear or not the other well you know maybe we just went and had a good church service and that's it you know what we don't want to be fools with the word of God verse 10 says the great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool and rewardeth the transgressors as a dog returneth to his vomit so a fool returneth to his folly it's amazing because if we look at this we can just keep on doing the same thing over and over again and and if you go on and you read down in this verse in this chapter it talks about a fool being like the hinge of a door and how the fool How could a fool be like the hinge of a door I really wondered about this I started to think about it I see what a door does if you ever wonder go look at a door and see what it does it only goes one way and the other way and one way and the other way and one way and the other way that's all a door does and sometimes it slabs but it only does the same thing over and over and over and over and sometimes it just gets squeaky when it does it and you know what that's what the word of God says a fool is like it just keeps doing the same thing over and over and over and over there's no correction there's no ability to change their ways but Sons and Daughters of God we've got the ability to change our ways verse 12 of Proverbs chapter 26 maybe stand with me as we close it says see us thou a man wise in his own conceit says there's more hope of a fool than of him that's where I say brothers and sisters we have no conceit the only conceit that we've got is that God chose us from before the foundation of the world to be able to believe his word to recognize Revelations chapter 1 verse 1 says the revelation of Jesus Christ and that doesn't mean the revelation of Jesus Christ some far way off place out there that means me myself going to the Isle of Patmos and recognizing the revelation of Jesus Christ to me personally that's what that means we don't have conceit except for Jesus Christ in our lives and what he's done for us I have more but I'll just pause there remember the communion service tonight brothers and sisters the revelation of Jesus Christ really is what separates us from anybody else and that doesn't make us better people it makes us humble people it makes us recognize that we had no way no ability on our own to ever be able to recognize our position it's just what he's done for us entirely God bless you this morning let's just bow Heavenly Father we're so thankful for your word we're so thankful Lord that you've given us the ability to take that seed father that you have placed inside of us Lord and and not just to go and find a good ground but to recognize that we are that good ground and father as your word comes forward and we hear your word it's your spirit that Waters that seed and causes that seed to crack open in the heart of your children and come to life and father as that seed comes to life it causes us to to change our lives Lord it causes us to allow you to live out through us and what you say you want to have done that's what we want to do father we don't want to continue going our own way and and just saying it's worked for me this long I'll just keep doing it Lord help us to hear that voice help us to have an ear Lord when we hear that scripture he that hath an ear let them hear what the spirit saith unto the Church Father give us ears to hear if our ears are dull of hearing father help us clean them out Lord if our eyes need to be refocused Lord Jesus help us to refocus our eyes upon thee Lord Jesus I pray that you would just bless each one who's made the effort to come out be with those who are maybe tuning in virtually or listening later father we all desire to be with you and we just ask that you would keep your hand upon each one now as we go our separate ways and father just be glorified As we sing a couple of songs unto you now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen foreign [Music] I need thee every hour [Music] I
