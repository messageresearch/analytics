[7:56] once again. Awesome Lord tonight. Our
[7:59] pastor, I know I think it was our pastor
[8:01] who had it, but just really good news.
[8:03] The Nigerian hostages have been freed,
[8:06] released. So,
[8:15] it comes that close to home. You know,
[8:17] you hear about the Israelis and just the
[8:19] travesty, horrible things that have
[8:20] happened, but it's this close to home.
[8:22] It really hits his heart and it's just
[8:24] wonderful to see the Lord intervene
[8:27] &gt;&gt; and I'm sure they are all rejoicing back
[8:30] in the journey as well. Thank the Lord
[8:32] for his mercy, his grace. Let's start
[8:34] with that song tonight. By his grace I
[8:37] am redeemed.
[8:39] Oh,
[8:41] by his grace I am
[8:46] redeemed.
[8:47] [Music]
[8:50] By his blood I am
[8:54] made
[8:56] free
[8:58] and I now can know
[9:02] him

[10:34] No one knew
[10:37] how alone
[10:38] I was feeling.
[10:40] [Music]
[10:42] And the emptiness I tried so hard to
[10:46] hide.
[10:49] Oh, I left it and said my life was fine
[10:54] without you.
[10:57] Well, I was covering up the secret
[11:00] tears. I cried.
[11:04] Oh, then one day someone told me of your
[11:09] mercy.
[11:12] Oh, and the love you showed that day on
[11:16] Calvary.
[11:19] Oh, there you
[11:22] purchase my redemption.
[11:27] Oh, when you broke sin's power, set my
[11:31] spirit free.
[11:34] Oh, I'm amazed
[11:38] that you love me.
[11:42] Oh,
[11:46] how you
[11:51] preious
[11:53] blood I found.
[11:57] And my sins
[12:00] are washed. Oh, they're all washed away.
[12:05] All my sins
[12:07] are washed
[12:10] away.
[12:11] [Applause]
[12:12] Yes, it's true.
[12:15] There's been days when I failed you.
[12:20] Oh Lord, the many times I've gone
[12:24] astray,
[12:27] but I've learned your love is stronger
[12:31] than my weakness. Aren't you glad for
[12:33] that tonight? Oh, and
[12:37] then every time I pray,
[12:42] oh, no one else can ever care for me
[12:47] like you, Lord.
[12:50] Other friends can never be as close to
[12:55] me.
[12:57] I'm not afraid to face the problems of
[13:02] tomorrow.
[13:05] Oh, knowing you are everything I ever
[13:12] [Music]
[13:17] love me. Oh,

[13:54] that you love me. Yes, Lord. Oh, I'm
[13:58] amazed
[14:01] how you came.
[14:05] Through your preious
[14:08] blood, I found pardon.
[14:13] And my sins
[14:15] are washed. Oh, they're all washed away.
[14:20] Oh, my sins
[14:23] are

[14:36] &gt;&gt; You're God. You're true. You're
[14:38] faithful.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, it's just a privilege to know you.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; And Lord, to know you in the power of
[14:46] your resurrection.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for the opportunity to
[14:49] gather again together tonight, Lord
[14:52] Jesus, to serve the risen king, to serve
[14:55] the God that was and is and is to come.
[14:59] The ones that the one that knows
[15:01] yesterday, that knows today, that knows
[15:03] tomorrow. The one that we can anchor our
[15:05] faith in, Lord Jesus. The one we can
[15:08] rest upon knowing for sure, dear Lord
[15:10] Jesus Christ, that our lives are in your
[15:12] ends, dear God. Thank you for the
[15:14] opportunity to gather together tonight.
[15:16] Thank you for the testimony, Lord, for a
[15:18] prayer request that's been on for three
[15:20] weeks, dear Lord Jesus Christ. And Lord,
[15:22] we can rejoice and say the God,
[15:26] the God that delivered
[15:30] to the hands
[15:32] &gt;&gt; of Abraham,
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Lot,
[15:35] &gt;&gt; and his people.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; When that brotherly love, Lord Jesus, as
[15:39] we heard this morning, drove him to go
[15:42] after his brother.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord,
[15:44] &gt;&gt; the God Lord Jesus that spoke to David
[15:48] &gt;&gt; and said, "You can pursue
[15:50] &gt;&gt; and you will overtake
[15:52] &gt;&gt; and without fail recover all."
[15:55] We called upon your name
[15:57] &gt;&gt; and you heard us there Lord Jesus.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; We give you the glory, honor and praise
[16:01] as saints Lord around the world. Lord
[16:04] Jesus return thanksgiving unto you for
[16:06] this prayer request that went around the
[16:08] world for the seven brothers dear Lord
[16:11] Jesus. Father Lord may you accept the
[16:13] thanks and praise that we bring as our
[16:16] offering unto you Lord Jesus. Bless the
[16:19] service tonight. Bless the communion.
[16:21] Bless a testimony service, Lord Jesus.
[16:24] Lord, we have many more testimonies to
[16:26] give, Lord Jesus. May our hearts
[16:28] rejoice, dear, Father, and may we have
[16:31] more confidence in you that our God,
[16:34] there's nothing impossible with him. We
[16:37] give you all the glory, honor, and
[16:38] praise. Bless the song service. Let it
[16:40] be a blessing unto us as we offer
[16:42] sacrifices of praise unto you, Lord
[16:45] Jesus, in spirit and in truth.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[16:55] Amen. Thank you my brother. May you have
[16:56] your seats this evening. Just thinking
[16:59] this evening what Jesus said. Just ask a
[17:02] question. Anybody want to be happier
[17:04] tonight? Happier. Well, Jesus said if
[17:07] you do these things, happy are you if
[17:09] you do these things. So I want to be
[17:11] happier.
[17:13] I mean I want the joy of the Lord in my
[17:15] in my heart. And I think part of that
[17:17] would just be starting with happiness.
[17:19] But the Lord promised it. So, I mean, we
[17:21] come to these footwash and communion
[17:23] services are always special.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; I think the Lord's just pleased. And
[17:27] tonight, I'm just so moved by the actual
[17:31] prayer for those Nigerians.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Just wonderful down from his glory. Our
[17:36] God came, took those 39 stripes, Jehovah
[17:41] in a manger, Jehovah on the cross,
[17:43] Jehovah in front of those task masters
[17:46] whipping him for our sake. We're clean
[17:49] tonight. We're We're made whole. We can
[17:52] come and celebrate that tonight. Well,

[38:19] gathered together in his name. What a

[38:24] opportunity.
[38:25] We just want to one more time
[38:29] remember Sister Charmaine before his
[38:32] throne. Thank the Lord for his will and
[38:34] her life. We want to remember Sister
[38:37] Elaine.
[38:39] We have an unspoken request as well. And
[38:41] if you have a need tonight, maybe just
[38:44] defy gravity, make it known unto him as
[38:46] we go in prayer. Gracious heavenly
[38:49] father, we exalt thee tonight.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Father, we exalt you above all that we
[38:55] can think, all that we can understand,
[38:59] &gt;&gt; all that we can perceive. Lord Jesus,
[39:02] we're so thankful that you are the
[39:05] author
[39:06] &gt;&gt; and the finisher of our faith.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, the only thing that you've
[39:11] called us to do is to believe it.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; And we thank you, Lord. But if we have
[39:16] that ability, it's because you've given
[39:17] it to us.
[39:19] So it makes it so amazing to exalt you,
[39:22] Lord Jesus.
[39:24] Tonight, Father, one more time, we just
[39:26] invite you to have the preeminence in
[39:29] our service, Lord, in our gathering. We
[39:31] know that your word declares where two
[39:33] or three gather together in your name,
[39:35] that Lord, you don't just send a
[39:37] messenger, you're there.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we welcome you here tonight
[39:42] in our midst, Lord. Father, not like the
[39:46] Pharisee did. Lord Jesus, we welcome you
[39:49] tonight with a kiss, Lord. Oh, Father,
[39:52] we anoint you with oil and we desire to
[39:54] wash your feet, Lord, to appreciate you,
[39:57] Lord Jesus.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, as a wife would tend to her
[40:02] husband, Father. We desire to do that
[40:04] tonight.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; We desire to love you, Father. to give
[40:09] you all the praise and glory, Lord, to
[40:11] exalt you greater than anything we could
[40:14] imagine.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we thank you for the
[40:17] needs once again, Lord. Sister Elaine
[40:20] and Sister Charmaine, and the unspoken
[40:22] request, Father. Lord, we know that you
[40:25] know all about them. You have them all
[40:26] in your control. And we thank you,
[40:29] Father, for the solutions. And Lord
[40:31] Jesus, each and every need that was
[40:32] expressed to you tonight by the raising
[40:35] of a hand. Lord, you know the the need
[40:38] behind that hand in the heart, Lord, of
[40:40] your children. And we just invite you,
[40:43] Lord, to sovereignly meet that need.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, sometimes it's just one
[40:48] grain of sand at a time for that
[40:50] mountain to move.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; And other times it's a it's a little
[40:54] landslide. And other times the whole
[40:56] mountain gets picked up and cast into
[40:57] the sea. However you want it done,
[40:59] Father, that's our desire.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. We just want to surrender to
[41:04] you tonight fully and completely, Lord
[41:06] Jesus. Mind, body, and spirit, Father.
[41:10] Lord Jesus, Lord, that our souls could
[41:13] just lie open before you tonight, Lord.
[41:16] That you could minister one more time to
[41:18] us. Father, we just ask that you would
[41:21] be glorified in this service, Lord, as
[41:23] we go forwards. Father, we pray that you
[41:25] would just open our eyes a little
[41:27] further, Lord Jesus, as we walk with you
[41:30] along the way.
[41:32] We love you, Father, and we thank you.
[41:34] We just ask all these things. In the
[41:36] name of Jesus Christ, we pray.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, we exalt
[41:45] thee.
[41:47] [Music]
[41:49] We exalt
[41:53] thee.
[41:56] We exalt
[42:00] thee.
[42:01] [Music]
[42:04] Oh
[42:05] Lord,
[42:11] we exalt
[42:14] me.
[42:18] He exalt
[42:22] me.
[42:26] He exalt
[42:29] thee.
[42:33] Oh
[42:35] Lord.
[42:36] [Music]
[42:38] Hallelujah.
[42:41] Thank you musicians.
[42:44] What a wonderful presence it is tonight.
[42:46] If you have your Bibles, I'd like to
[42:48] read from Luke chap 24.
[42:51] Luke chap 24
[42:54] verse 13.
[42:58] Thank you everyone for entering in to
[43:01] worship. It really sets an atmosphere. I
[43:04] know as you know as well the Lord is
[43:06] pleased with worship.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; He desires worship.
[43:13] My
[43:16] Luke 24:13.
[43:22] And behold, two of them went the same
[43:24] day to a village called Emmas,
[43:28] which was from Jerusalem about three
[43:30] score furongs.
[43:32] That's about seven and a half miles.
[43:36] And they walked together. They talked
[43:38] together, sorry, of all the things which
[43:41] had happened, the the crucifixion, the
[43:44] persecution, the scattering of the
[43:46] sheep.
[43:48] Verse 15. And it came to pass that while
[43:51] they communed together and reasoned,
[43:54] Jesus himself drew near and went with
[43:57] them.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; But their eyes were holden that they
[44:01] should not know him.
[44:03] And he said unto them, "What manner of
[44:06] communications are these that ye have
[44:09] one to another as ye walk and are sad?"
[44:14] And one of them, whose name was Cleopas,
[44:17] answering said unto him, "Art thou only
[44:20] a stranger in Jerusalem? And hast not
[44:23] known the things which are come to pass
[44:26] therein these days?"
[44:28] And he said unto them, "What things?"
[44:31] And they said unto him concerning Jesus
[44:34] of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty
[44:36] in deed and word before God and all the
[44:39] people,
[44:41] and how the chief priests and our rulers
[44:43] delivered him to be condemned to death,
[44:47] and have crucified him.
[44:49] But we trusted that it had been he which
[44:54] should have redeemed Israel.
[44:57] And beside all this, today is the third
[44:59] day since these things were done.
[45:02] Yay. And concerning, and certain women
[45:04] also of our company, made us astonished,
[45:08] which were early at the suppler. And
[45:11] when they found not his body, they came,
[45:14] saying that they had also seen a vision
[45:17] of angels,
[45:19] which said he was alive.
[45:22] And certain of them which were with us
[45:25] went to the suppler, and found it, even
[45:28] so, as the women had said.
[45:31] But him they saw not.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Then said he unto them, "Oh fools, and
[45:38] slow of heart to believe all that the
[45:42] prophets have spoken. Ought not Christ
[45:45] to have suffered these things and to
[45:48] enter into his glory?"
[45:51] And beginning at Moses and all the
[45:52] prophets, he expounded unto them in all
[45:55] the scriptures
[45:57] the things concerning himself.
[46:01] And we know for sure that he could have
[46:03] done many signs and wonders.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; But what did he do? He pointed them
[46:07] right back to the word.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; What did the prophet say? Because that's
[46:11] who I am.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; And they drew nigh unto the village
[46:16] whether they went. And he made as though
[46:19] he would have gone further. But they
[46:22] constrained him, saying, "Abide with us,
[46:25] for it's toward evening, and the day is
[46:27] far spent." And he went in to tarry with
[46:30] them. He always comes where he's
[46:32] invited.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass as he sat at meat
[46:35] with them, he took bread and blessed it
[46:37] and break it and gave it to them. And
[46:39] their eyes were opened and they knew him
[46:43] and he vanished out of their sight.
[46:46] Amen.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; And they said one to another,
[46:50] my did not our heart burn within us
[46:55] &gt;&gt; while he talked with us by the way and
[46:59] while he opened to us the scripture.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer one more time.
[47:06] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[47:08] revealing power, Lord Jesus.
[47:11] It takes revelation from you, Father, to
[47:14] open the eyes of our mind to open the
[47:17] eyes of our heart, Lord Jesus. Oh,
[47:19] Father, many times we can see with our
[47:21] eyes, but we do not perceive correctly.
[47:24] Help us, Lord Jesus, to perceive
[47:26] correctly in the day in which we live.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; We just commit these words into your
[47:30] hands now for your glory. In Jesus
[47:32] Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless
[47:35] you tonight. You may be seated.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Just a couple of comments.
[47:41] As we prepare for a communion service
[47:43] tonight, I just think it's so wonderful
[47:45] to hear the testimony of the brethren
[47:49] that were held captive for three weeks,
[47:52] have been released. What a tremendous
[47:54] thing that is.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:01] [Applause]
[48:05] I don't think I don't think that we'll
[48:08] ever be able to give enough praise or
[48:10] glory for that.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; What a tremendous thing it is to know
[48:14] that that's the God we serve right
[48:16] there.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; There's no need that's too great for
[48:19] him.
[48:21] You know, just thinking about our our
[48:23] little service tonight, I just I just am
[48:26] so encouraged to see everyone that's
[48:28] come out. We we've come not to see one
[48:30] another. We've come to see that God.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; That's who we've come to see. The one
[48:34] that would deliver the captives and set
[48:36] them free according to his word.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; You know, talking about our scripture
[48:40] tonight, these these disciples, they
[48:42] were with Jesus. They they knew who he
[48:45] was. They fellowshipped with him. They
[48:47] went fishing with him. They they they
[48:49] saw mighty signs and wonders with him.
[48:51] They they walked with him. They talked
[48:53] with him. But even though they were on
[48:56] this road to Emmas, they did not
[48:58] recognize that's who was with them,
[49:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:01] &gt;&gt; They were so caught up in the moment. So
[49:04] caught up in the in the sadness and
[49:06] maybe the sickness, maybe all of what
[49:09] was going on in the day in the city in
[49:11] which they were in, they just had to get
[49:13] out of town. They just had to go clear
[49:15] their minds. And here they were on this
[49:18] road to Emmas. And we know that as Jesus
[49:21] drew near himself, as they spoke about
[49:24] him, it pays to speak about him.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; It's worth it to say his name.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't want us saying in the
[49:32] name of Jesus. But we know that's where
[49:34] all power lies.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Only in the name of Jesus. When we eat
[49:39] and we bless our food, we ought to do it
[49:41] in the name of Jesus. When we ask any
[49:44] petition, we ought to do it in the name
[49:46] of Jesus.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Many times I've been guilty to say in
[49:49] your name,
[49:50] &gt;&gt; amen.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; But whose name is that?
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Say the name of Jesus.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; He comes where he's invited. But you
[50:00] know, even as these these brothers were
[50:02] were ministering, can you imagine
[50:04] ministering to Jesus,
[50:06] &gt;&gt; walking with him and ministering to him,
[50:09] beginning to preach to him and tell him,
[50:12] give him a lesson about what's gone on.
[50:15] I can't imagine it,
[50:17] &gt;&gt; but here they were doing that. And and
[50:20] they talked about how the the women were
[50:22] first at the supplr in the morning, and
[50:24] they thought that he was the one that
[50:25] would deliver Israel. And as they walked
[50:28] along the way with him, they began to
[50:29] express their hearts to him as he asked
[50:32] them questions. And they he even they
[50:34] even said to him that, you know, they
[50:36] thought that it had seen a vision of
[50:38] angels.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; And we know in another part in the
[50:41] scripture, I'm not sure which one it is.
[50:42] It might be in John, that they said that
[50:45] when the girls came back, when the
[50:46] sisters came back, they said that they
[50:49] were telling tales.
[50:51] They didn't even believe that Jesus had
[50:54] risen, even though that's what he
[50:55] himself, the word made flesh, told them
[50:58] would happen,
[51:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:01] &gt;&gt; And here they were walking with them,
[51:03] not even realizing that's who it was.
[51:06] It's amazing how wonderful he is.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; But there came a time, and that was at
[51:12] the evening time where they drew nigh
[51:14] unto the village where they constrained
[51:17] him. They said, you know, don't don't
[51:18] don't go. Just just come on. We kind of
[51:21] like our fellowship. There's something
[51:23] about this fellowship, isn't there? Why
[51:25] don't you just stay with us? Don't don't
[51:26] go any further. And we know that it was
[51:28] in the evening time that he broke the
[51:30] bread to them. He served them communion.
[51:34] I can only imagine that they recognized
[51:36] it in that moment. In that instant, the
[51:39] way that he broke the bread in that meal
[51:42] before he actually went into his
[51:45] passion, before he had to go through the
[51:47] crucifixion, the story they must have
[51:50] heard, those 12 that were there, that
[51:52] exclusive meeting that they were at, the
[51:55] description they must have had, the way
[51:57] that he did everything would have been
[52:00] so amazing.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; And for some, it might have just been a
[52:03] normal event. He just broke the bread
[52:05] and he just poured the wine and you know
[52:07] he just got a little bit weird and
[52:08] washed their feet. But for others it
[52:11] might have been amazing to think about
[52:13] if this truly is the Messiah and he
[52:16] wants to wash our feet. We know Peter
[52:19] had a problem with that. We'll get into
[52:22] that a little bit later. But I just want
[52:23] to talk about this scripture tonight.
[52:25] how they how they were able to walk
[52:27] along and talk along about Jesus, about
[52:31] what was going on, but not recognize
[52:34] what was taking place right before their
[52:36] eyes.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; I want to talk about recognizing what's
[52:40] taking place right before our eyes.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; If if we're talking about the Jesus that
[52:46] was there with them that could open that
[52:48] could stop their eyes
[52:50] &gt;&gt; first off,
[52:51] &gt;&gt; then he could open their eyes.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we're talking about that Jesus,
[52:55] we're talking about the Jesus that could
[52:57] come down on Sunset Mountain with an
[53:00] open book in his hand and put one foot
[53:02] upon the land and one foot upon the sea
[53:04] and declare that there shall be no more
[53:07] time. There's no more mystery. The
[53:09] mystery, our history, all of those
[53:11] mysteries are open now.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; If that same Jesus is here tonight,
[53:16] brothers and sisters,
[53:18] &gt;&gt; what's our petition?
[53:20] &gt;&gt; What do we have need of? You know, we
[53:23] heard it this morning. Depends on what
[53:25] you think it is.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; And that's the same with our service
[53:29] tonight. That's the same with every
[53:30] single service that we have the
[53:31] opportunity to go to. I just feel I need
[53:34] to go this way, brothers and sisters. It
[53:35] depends on what we think it is.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Is it just a gathering to get together?
[53:41] Is it just an ordinance that that the
[53:43] prophet of God said that we ought to do,
[53:45] so we just go and do it? Yes, indeed it
[53:48] is. All of that, but more.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't it more? Isn't it a lot more?
[53:53] We're actually getting together to
[53:55] fellowship with the King of Kings.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; But it depends on what you think it is.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; You can take your side with the priest
[54:04] or or maybe I'll say it this way. We can
[54:05] take our side. You could take your side
[54:08] with tradition
[54:10] &gt;&gt; the way that we've always done it.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; We sing the song this way all the time
[54:14] and we never get out of order. We always
[54:15] sing it that way. We've always done it
[54:17] that way and we'll always do it that
[54:18] way.
[54:19] We we always act a certain way. We never
[54:22] get out of order. Brothers and sisters,
[54:24] the prophet even says it sometimes it's
[54:25] good to get a little bit out of order.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Just change it up a little bit. Don't
[54:29] worry. God's never going to let us get
[54:31] out of order scripturally.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; If we filled with the Holy Ghost, we're
[54:35] never going to get too far out of order.
[54:38] We might get a little bit strange
[54:40] according to what people think, but it
[54:42] depends on what you think it is. Is it
[54:44] emotion?
[54:46] I can't help but think when we get in
[54:47] the presence of the king, I'm going to
[54:48] get em when I do, I'm going to get
[54:50] emotional.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; I'm probably liable to not even be able
[54:53] to speak
[54:55] &gt;&gt; probably want to wash his feet with my
[54:57] tears.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Only thing is I don't have that much
[55:01] hair to do much with. But can you
[55:03] imagine to be able to perceive being in
[55:06] the presence of the King of Kings?
[55:08] Brothers and sisters, depends on what
[55:09] you think. Because if you think
[55:11] according to the scripture, according to
[55:12] the word of God, where two or three are
[55:14] gathered together in his name, he's
[55:15] there in the midst. That means he's here
[55:16] right now. For some people think that
[55:18] he's here right now. Other people think,
[55:21] well, I'll just take the side with the
[55:22] priest, maybe my tradition, and I'll
[55:24] call it maybe the devil. Maybe I won't
[55:26] call it the devil. I'll just say, well,
[55:28] brother Barry, he's just getting a
[55:29] little bit emotional now. It's just his
[55:30] way. He does it once in a while. You
[55:32] know, I'll just shrug my shoulders and
[55:34] say, "There it is again." Or, you know,
[55:35] it depends on what we think about it. Or
[55:37] you can take the side with the believer
[55:39] and call it God. Whichever you believe,
[55:42] that's where your reward will come from.
[55:44] I think it's so beautiful. I want to
[55:46] encourage us. Don't look at the veil.
[55:48] Don't stumble at the veil. Don't look at
[55:49] your brother. Don't look at your sister.
[55:50] Don't look at your father. Don't look at
[55:51] your mother. Even though you should look
[55:52] at all of those, but don't look to them
[55:54] for your experience. Look to Jesus
[55:56] Christ for your experience and allow him
[55:59] to manifest that experience in your life
[56:01] the way that he wants it done.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And your eyes will be opened as
[56:06] well. Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; In 1964, Brother Brandham, when their
[56:09] eyes were open, he says, "I've seen not
[56:13] long ago where they had sunflower seeds
[56:16] they'd had packaged for nearly 4,000
[56:18] years in Egypt. They took that seed and
[56:22] some of that wheat that was in the
[56:24] garner, I love how he says this, that
[56:26] Joseph put in there."
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that?
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Some of that wheat that was in the
[56:32] garner that Joseph put in there.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Wow. all those years. How would he know
[56:37] that?
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Maybe just a little prophetic insight.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; The rest of the world might say, "Wow,
[56:43] that's just that's just not even real.
[56:46] That's not true." But here we have the
[56:48] prophet saying that Joseph put in there.
[56:50] Wow. All those years. And when it was
[56:52] placed in the ground and the sun struck
[56:55] it, it lived.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; That germ of life stayed there.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh brother, when we were ordained
[57:02] of God before the foundation of the
[57:04] earth to be sons and daughters of God,
[57:08] when that light strikes it, there's no
[57:10] denomination,
[57:12] no church boundaries. I'm going to say
[57:14] no traditions.
[57:16] There's nothing there's nothing there's
[57:18] no church boundaries. There's no
[57:20] criticism. There's no nothing going to
[57:22] stop it. It's going to live cuz God said
[57:26] it would. Amen.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; They recognize it.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Her eyes come open and she knew it. She
[57:33] knew it once inside. She knew the
[57:35] scripture. That's the reason she knew
[57:37] him. These disciples after his
[57:41] resurrection didn't know the scripture
[57:44] and that's the reason they didn't know
[57:46] him.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; That's why John,
[57:50] &gt;&gt; a type of the bride, he was commanded to
[57:52] take the book and eat it up. Amen.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; What was that book? It was the book of
[57:57] redemption. This is it right here.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; This book right here. Take that book,
[58:02] John. A type of the bride. And eat it
[58:04] up.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; And you know what'll be so sweet in your
[58:07] mouth? It'll be sweet as honey in your
[58:09] mouth. But it'll make your belly bitter.
[58:11] Your flesh won't like it. Your body
[58:13] won't like it. Your traditions won't
[58:15] like it. All of your ways, carnally
[58:19] speaking, will not like it. But it will
[58:22] be so good for you spiritually.
[58:25] These disciples after his resurrection
[58:27] didn't know the scripture and that's the
[58:30] reason they didn't know him. And that's
[58:33] the way the Pharisees didn't know it. He
[58:36] said, "Search the scriptures. You think
[58:38] you have eternal life and
[58:42] they're the one that tell you who I am."
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, the vindication of his being. Then
[58:49] when the promise is a vindicated, their
[58:52] eyes were opened. Isn't that beautiful?
[58:56] &gt;&gt; And they knew him.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, tonight I want to
[59:00] encourage us when we come to this
[59:02] communion table and we partake of this
[59:05] supper. When we partake of the bread,
[59:07] when we partake of the wine,
[59:10] remember what we're doing. We're
[59:13] remembering the Lord's body that was
[59:14] broken. We're remembering his blood that
[59:16] was shed for us. And you know, he's not
[59:19] off in some other dimension
[59:21] hoping that we're actually able to
[59:23] receive the word for our day. He's right
[59:26] here.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Right here tonight.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Melzdc himself, Jesus Christ, Michael,
[59:33] whoever we want to call him, the Holy
[59:35] Ghost,
[59:36] &gt;&gt; all the same. That one is here tonight
[59:40] to minister to us
[59:42] &gt;&gt; this bread and this wine. Don't look at
[59:44] the brothers. Don't look at the sisters.
[59:46] Don't look at the pastor. Don't look at
[59:48] anybody. Look away to Jesus.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say also that same thing
[59:54] that opened eyes closed eyes too.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Those who made fun of it eternally put
[1:00:02] them back to where they was at the
[1:00:04] beginning. You see, closed their eyes.
[1:00:08] Peter's eyes was opened by the same
[1:00:11] thing.
[1:00:13] He was looking for it. And I just
[1:00:16] believe that's the way it is for the
[1:00:17] believer in the day in which we live.
[1:00:20] When we're looking for it, we'll see it.
[1:00:22] When we're looking for him, we will see
[1:00:24] him.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; We know that brother Brandham, he
[1:00:28] brought it out in in uh
[1:00:31] boy oh boy, I'm drawing a blank now.
[1:00:36] We can look at nature and we can see God
[1:00:38] in nature.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. But many times people get so
[1:00:43] scientific with this word, they can't
[1:00:46] see Jesus and they put them off into the
[1:00:48] past or put them out into the future and
[1:00:50] just miss what's happening right now.
[1:00:53] But our eyes, I believe, have been open
[1:00:55] to what's happened in the day in which
[1:00:57] we live. Peter's eyes was opened by the
[1:00:59] same thing. The same thing that closed
[1:01:02] some eyes open others. And I think it's
[1:01:06] beautiful in the scripture that we read
[1:01:07] tonight how the same one was able to
[1:01:10] close eyes of those who were with him
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; but yet open them all at the same time.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Peter's eyes was opened by the same
[1:01:20] thing. He was looking for it.
[1:01:22] Nathaniel's eyes Jesus said he knew them
[1:01:26] before the foundation of the world that
[1:01:29] they were to be these messengers.
[1:01:32] Now, in the face of all of this, in this
[1:01:35] age that we're living in, what has it
[1:01:39] done to your eyes?
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; What has this message done to our eyes?
[1:01:46] I think it's just so beautiful. And I I
[1:01:48] love how Brother Brandham brings it that
[1:01:50] way. And that's why I'm doing it
[1:01:51] tonight, brothers and sisters. What has
[1:01:53] it done to our eyes tonight?
[1:01:56] What has it done to our eyes 10 years
[1:01:57] ago is is good, but where are we today?
[1:02:00] Because 10 years ago, we could have been
[1:02:02] on so on fire for Christ. And now
[1:02:04] certain circumstances come along and
[1:02:07] shake us down and cause our experience
[1:02:09] to be a little upset. Something is a
[1:02:12] little bit off. Just because we had an
[1:02:14] experience 10 years ago, that doesn't
[1:02:15] necessarily mean that everything is
[1:02:18] right tonight.
[1:02:19] I want to encourage us even while we're
[1:02:22] preaching, while we're talking about
[1:02:23] this, if there's anything in our life
[1:02:25] that we feel might hinder us from having
[1:02:27] the full revelation, having the full
[1:02:30] benefit of coming to the communion
[1:02:32] table, even now in our hearts, we can
[1:02:34] say, "Lord Jesus, just please forgive
[1:02:37] me. I I just want to be right with you."
[1:02:39] And you know, the moment that we do that
[1:02:40] in our hearts, even from our seat, he
[1:02:43] does it. He does forgive us. It gets put
[1:02:45] into the sea of his forgetfulness.
[1:02:48] We don't have to have an altar call.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; He knows where we are.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly where we are. And not
[1:02:54] just our geographical location. He knows
[1:02:56] our spiritual location.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Now, in the face of all of this, in the
[1:03:01] age that we're living in, what has it
[1:03:03] done to your eyes? Now, that's the
[1:03:07] question, not what it done to theirs.
[1:03:11] It's beautiful because we can see what
[1:03:13] it did to theirs. there. And I I think
[1:03:16] this is so interesting. This was just
[1:03:18] revealed to me as we were reading it
[1:03:20] tonight. You know, in verse 31 of Luke
[1:03:23] 24,
[1:03:25] and their eyes were opened and they knew
[1:03:28] him and he vanished out of their sight.
[1:03:32] It's beautiful. Their eyes were open and
[1:03:34] he they knew him. And they said one to
[1:03:37] another, "Did not our
[1:03:39] heart"
[1:03:41] They didn't say hearts.
[1:03:44] I've never seen that before and I'm sure
[1:03:46] maybe we all have seen it before. But it
[1:03:48] was heart, one heart
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; knit together in love, right?
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; The unity of the spirit, the bond of
[1:03:56] peace, our heart. Didn't our heart burn
[1:04:00] within us as he spoke to us along the
[1:04:02] way. And you know, I can't help but
[1:04:04] think that's why we come to church.
[1:04:06] That's why we gather together in the
[1:04:07] name of Jesus Christ. So we can walk
[1:04:09] down the road further and further with
[1:04:12] him. so he can slowly reveal further and
[1:04:15] further to us who we are and what it's
[1:04:18] all about. But I love how brother
[1:04:20] Brandham says now that's the question,
[1:04:22] not what it done to theirs. Which side
[1:04:25] are you on tonight?
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Now you've got to be either associated
[1:04:29] with the Pharisees or associated with
[1:04:31] the apostles or the believers. Now it's
[1:04:34] done something for you. You're just up
[1:04:37] against it. It's done something. If if
[1:04:40] you'd been living in that day, what
[1:04:42] would you have uh done? What does your
[1:04:46] present state now identify you? Where
[1:04:49] does it where does it make you think of
[1:04:53] it? I love how brother Brandham brings
[1:04:55] this out in the message in many
[1:04:57] different places. He says, you know, if
[1:04:59] people talk about it, they say, well, if
[1:05:01] I was back there in the days of Jesus,
[1:05:03] well, if I was back there in the days of
[1:05:04] brother Brandham, he says, who you are
[1:05:07] today is exactly who you would have been
[1:05:08] there.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; If we're sitting with a critical spirit
[1:05:12] today, we would have a critical spirit
[1:05:15] yesterday
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; and we'd have a critical spirit
[1:05:17] tomorrow. You know, that's the way it
[1:05:19] is. But if we're on the side of Jehovah
[1:05:22] tonight, that's exactly where we would
[1:05:24] have been then.
[1:05:27] If you'd been living in that day, what
[1:05:29] would you have done? What does your
[1:05:33] present state now identify you? Where
[1:05:36] does it make you think of it?
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "Well, my church, that's what
[1:05:41] the Pharisees said." See,
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; I want to say tonight, brothers and
[1:05:44] sisters, even now, if we have a
[1:05:47] different perspective, my desire, my
[1:05:50] heart's desire is that we would not be
[1:05:53] in that position of the Pharisee, that
[1:05:55] we would be able to say, "Be it unto me,
[1:05:57] Lord, according to your word. Open my
[1:06:00] eyes. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
[1:06:02] Jesus. Let me be like those two that
[1:06:06] walked with you on the road to Emmas."
[1:06:07] Maybe my teaching, maybe my tradition,
[1:06:09] maybe something stopped me up to have my
[1:06:11] eyes closed.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; It's only because you allowed it to be
[1:06:14] that way. Oh, but you have the power to
[1:06:17] open them.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; We have the power to leave tonight with
[1:06:20] our eyes open. We don't have to leave
[1:06:22] here with our eyes closed.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; He says, "Are you ready to recognize
[1:06:26] Jesus Christ through the power of his
[1:06:29] resurrection? Oh my. Are you willing to
[1:06:32] forsake everything and walk with him?
[1:06:34] Are you ready to believe him? Taking his
[1:06:37] light and life to others. What has it
[1:06:40] done?
[1:06:42] As he has revealed it in these last
[1:06:44] days, he promised it. Now you say,
[1:06:48] brother Brandham, the Messiah was
[1:06:50] revealed then.
[1:06:52] I know the scripture said so.
[1:06:56] Well, that same Messiah is promised to
[1:06:58] reveal himself today.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to say, brothers and
[1:07:03] sisters, let's not just stop with the
[1:07:05] quote and say, 'Well, this is Brother
[1:07:06] Brad. I'm preaching in 1964,
[1:07:08] even though it is.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; He was told to store up food for a
[1:07:12] season.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; When we read this, I want to bring it
[1:07:16] right up out of history, right out of
[1:07:17] 1964, bring it up to 2025. Let's let's
[1:07:21] make him the present tense I am like he
[1:07:24] is. Let's recognize him for who he is.
[1:07:28] Well, that same Messiah is promised to
[1:07:30] reveal himself today. Same thing. Now,
[1:07:33] Hebrews 13:8, now listen, identifies him
[1:07:36] to be the same yesterday, today, and
[1:07:38] forever. John 14:8 said that he that
[1:07:40] believeth in me, see, the works that I
[1:07:41] do shall he do also. John 14:9. Here we
[1:07:44] find he said, "A little while, and the
[1:07:46] world order, cosmos
[1:07:49] won't know me anymore."
[1:07:51] They'll be totally blind. And we know
[1:07:54] that we live in a day that he's
[1:07:55] described right there.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus is a fairy tale for many people.
[1:08:00] Most people in this world, children
[1:08:02] growing up don't go to church. Why would
[1:08:04] you go to church, join a cult, and be
[1:08:06] brainwashed? Many times that's what
[1:08:09] people do. There's no desire to raise
[1:08:12] children in the fear of the Lord,
[1:08:15] but they'd be totally blind. He says,
[1:08:18] "They won't see me anymore.
[1:08:20] Then a little while they won't see me.
[1:08:23] Yet your eyes will be open for you shall
[1:08:25] see me for I'll be with you even in you.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; to the end of the world.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; So tonight, brothers and sisters, I just
[1:08:37] want to encourage us. What do we think
[1:08:39] about it tonight?
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; When we take this communion table, when
[1:08:43] we partake of the bread, when we take of
[1:08:45] the wine, what do we think about it?
[1:08:48] because that makes all the difference.
[1:08:51] If we come and we do it just out of a
[1:08:53] duty, it's not going to give us the
[1:08:56] benefit that we need and and not just
[1:08:58] want but need. This is one of the three
[1:09:02] ordinances that was given to us by the
[1:09:05] prophet by the word. Water baptism in
[1:09:08] the name of Jesus Christ, communion, and
[1:09:11] footwashing. The only three ordinances
[1:09:14] that we need to do led by the spirit.
[1:09:16] And when we do those being led by the
[1:09:19] spirit, we get the benefit of the spirit
[1:09:21] in our lives, in our families. And you
[1:09:24] know, brothers and sisters, as much as
[1:09:25] we say we know the message of the hour,
[1:09:27] I'll say this loud and clear. And I'm
[1:09:29] sure that we'll all be able to say a big
[1:09:31] hearty amen to it, you know, talk is
[1:09:33] cheap. Because unless we're doing the
[1:09:36] three things that God has instructed us
[1:09:38] to do, we are not applying the token.
[1:09:41] That's right.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; We can say it all we want, but the devil
[1:09:44] knows exactly where we stand. And when
[1:09:47] we come out and we show the devil whose
[1:09:49] side we're on, when we're willing to
[1:09:51] actually forsake all and follow him, we
[1:09:54] are truly applying the token. Applying
[1:09:57] the token isn't just saying that I
[1:09:58] believe. I've got the baptism of the
[1:09:59] Holy Ghost. So now my family is saved
[1:10:01] because I believe. Even though it is
[1:10:04] our actions prove who we are.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; And how can I say that? Jesus said, "You
[1:10:10] know them by their fruit."
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; The lives in which we live demonstrate
[1:10:14] where we are.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you by experience,
[1:10:17] there's times in my life where I just
[1:10:19] couldn't come to a communion service
[1:10:21] because I wasn't right with the Lord. I
[1:10:26] didn't feel right. I had a wrong
[1:10:27] attitude. There's times where I didn't
[1:10:28] want to come to church because I had a
[1:10:31] bad attitude.
[1:10:33] Have you ever felt that? Or am I the
[1:10:34] only one?
[1:10:36] I felt that way at times I wouldn't come
[1:10:38] to church. But you know, brothers and
[1:10:40] sisters, we've got to fight the
[1:10:41] feelings. The prophet for our day said
[1:10:43] our feelings have nothing to do with it.
[1:10:45] The Holy Ghost is without sensation. We
[1:10:48] need to go against all of this flesh and
[1:10:50] come against it and actually push
[1:10:52] through so that we can actually see the
[1:10:54] full benefit of the word. Maybe tonight
[1:10:57] I'm going to stop right there. I'll
[1:10:58] invite the brothers to come forward.
[1:11:01] Call the brother Joel and we will begin
[1:11:03] with the communion service.
[1:11:05] We'll change the order of the service.
[1:11:07] Maybe if you want to just stand with me,
[1:11:10] we'll just bow in prayer.
[1:11:18] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, tonight
[1:11:21] we just thank you, Lord, that we know
[1:11:24] that you you have the power to open our
[1:11:27] eyes and to close our eyes.
[1:11:31] And Father, tonight based on on that
[1:11:34] that statement, Father, I just pray that
[1:11:37] you would close our eyes to the things
[1:11:39] of the world.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; I pray that for our families, Lord
[1:11:43] Jesus, that you would help us to close
[1:11:45] our eyes to the things of the world.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; And Father, I pray that you would help
[1:11:50] us, Lord, to open our eyes to the things
[1:11:53] of the Lord. that we would desire more
[1:11:57] of you
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; than ever before.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; I just was thinking tonight before the
[1:12:02] service, Lord, that you know, as we we
[1:12:05] knew that those hostages were hanging in
[1:12:08] the balance and Father, as we prayed, we
[1:12:11] desired more than anything as every day
[1:12:13] that passed, we desired more and more
[1:12:16] that they would be released. And then
[1:12:17] there came a day, Lord, where they were
[1:12:19] released,
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; answering the prayers. We thank you,
[1:12:23] Father.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord Jesus, I can't help but think
[1:12:26] that one of these days the rapture of
[1:12:28] the church that you have chosen before
[1:12:30] the foundation of the world is going to
[1:12:32] be the same way. Oh, Father, we've
[1:12:34] prayed and prayed and prayed about it
[1:12:36] and one day it's just going to happen.
[1:12:39] And Father, I pray that our eyes would
[1:12:41] be open to that reality that we would be
[1:12:43] ready, Father, willing and able by your
[1:12:47] spirit, Father, by the oil in our lamps.
[1:12:50] We know that the shout has already gone
[1:12:52] forth that behold the bridegroom cometh.
[1:12:56] Get up and trim your lamps. It's already
[1:12:59] happened. Oh, Father. And that voice now
[1:13:02] is echoing through the bride.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; And one of these days, that door is
[1:13:07] going to be closed. And it won't be
[1:13:08] closed by man. It will be closed by you,
[1:13:12] Father.
[1:13:15] that church that put you on the outside,
[1:13:18] Father, you will go in and you will suck
[1:13:20] with them and you will close that door
[1:13:22] once and for all.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to be ready for
[1:13:26] that door to be closed behind us.
[1:13:30] Now tonight, Father, as we change the
[1:13:32] order of the service and we look to you,
[1:13:34] Father, for that body, that ordinance
[1:13:36] that you gave us, Lord Jesus, for your
[1:13:38] body that was broken and the blood that
[1:13:40] was spilled, Father, we pray that you
[1:13:42] would just, Lord, allow the full
[1:13:45] revelation, Lord Jesus, the full
[1:13:47] manifestation of the blessing of
[1:13:49] partaking in this service manifest in
[1:13:52] our lives, Lord.
[1:13:54] Father, we love you and we thank you. We
[1:13:56] just ask all these things in Jesus
[1:14:00] Christ's name we pray.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles,
[1:14:08] I'd like to turn to First Corinthians.
[1:14:12] 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:14:20] Start with verse 23.
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:27] For I have received of the Lord
[1:14:31] that which also I delivered unto you,
[1:14:35] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:14:37] which he was betrayed took bread.
[1:14:41] And when he had given thanks, he broke
[1:14:44] it
[1:14:45] and said, "Take, eat.
[1:14:49] This is my body which is broken for you.
[1:14:53] This do in remembrance of me.
[1:14:58] After the same manner also he took the
[1:15:00] cup when he had stopped saying
[1:15:04] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:15:06] blood.
[1:15:08] This do ye as oft as you drink it in
[1:15:11] remembrance of me.
[1:15:14] For as often as you eat this bread
[1:15:17] and drink this cup, ye do show the
[1:15:21] Lord's death till he come.
[1:15:25] Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this
[1:15:28] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:15:30] unworthily
[1:15:33] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:15:36] the Lord.
[1:15:39] But let a man examine himself.
[1:15:42] [Music]
[1:15:43] And so let him eat of that bread and
[1:15:46] drink of that cup. For he that eateth
[1:15:49] and drinkketh unworthily eateth and
[1:15:51] drinkkeeth damnation to himself,
[1:15:55] not discerning the Lord's body.
[1:15:59] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:16:03] among you, and many sleep.
[1:16:06] For if we would judge ourselves, we
[1:16:09] should not be judged.
[1:16:11] But when we are judged, we are chasened
[1:16:14] of the Lord,
[1:16:16] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:16:19] world.
[1:16:21] Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come
[1:16:24] together to eat, tarry one for another,
[1:16:28] and if any man hunger, let him eat at
[1:16:30] home, that ye come not together unto
[1:16:33] condemnation,
[1:16:35] and the rest will I set in order when I
[1:16:39] come.
[1:16:42] Amen.

[1:17:26] Shall we bow our hearts before him?
[1:17:28] Our Lord and King, our master and
[1:17:30] Savior.
[1:17:33] You've been everything to us.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; and that is why we come together this
[1:17:37] evening in that all sufficient name, the
[1:17:40] name above all names, the name of the
[1:17:41] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; We come to lift up your name and praise
[1:17:45] you. Yes,
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; we can because we your children chosen
[1:17:49] from the foundation of the earth to
[1:17:51] fulfill your ordinance this day
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; in an age where
[1:17:57] you are completely almost forgotten
[1:17:59] father.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; We are here to affirm once more
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; that we know that our lord is alive
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; that he's present this moment in this
[1:18:08] place
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; because we have come according to your
[1:18:10] word.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; So Lord be merciful to us. Oh God, come
[1:18:15] and touch your children. Oh Lord, come
[1:18:17] and energize us. Come and quicken us, oh
[1:18:19] God, into what you're doing today, this
[1:18:22] day, this time, Father. Help us, oh
[1:18:24] Lord, to look forward, oh Lord, to the
[1:18:27] time and season when we've appear in
[1:18:29] your presence, oh God, to live forever.
[1:18:32] But now, Father, we came as a people
[1:18:36] with a testimony, Lord.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; You called us. We were in a difficult
[1:18:42] situation.
[1:18:43] Well, while your bride called on you and
[1:18:46] here we are today celebrating your
[1:18:48] victory.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; We just want to say Lord, you are good
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; all the time and we glorify your name.
[1:18:55] We exalt your name. We lift up your
[1:18:57] name, Father. But even as we go forth,
[1:18:59] oh Lord, we want to bless this bread
[1:19:02] that is being broken as a representation
[1:19:04] of your body because you blessed it the
[1:19:07] first time, oh Lord. Yes.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to say forgive our
[1:19:11] mistakes as we can, oh Lord,
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; and help us not to eat damnation onto
[1:19:15] our souls, but rather to come and
[1:19:17] receive all the blessings that come with
[1:19:19] it.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; May there be deliverance. May there be
[1:19:22] healing, oh Lord. May there be blessings
[1:19:26] upon blessings, oh Lord. May there be
[1:19:28] forgiveness of sins. May there be
[1:19:30] repentance, oh Lord. May there be every
[1:19:33] aspect of your way that we desire that
[1:19:35] we need in the body. Father, it's your
[1:19:37] body. You know it better than we do.
[1:19:39] Lord,
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; so have your will, oh Lord, as we come
[1:19:41] forward in our feeble effort in Jesus
[1:19:44] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Let's pray over the wine, our most
[1:19:51] precious heavenly father. Once again,
[1:19:54] Father, this is an opportunity given to
[1:19:56] us to assemble here this evening for a
[1:20:00] communion service. Father, once again,
[1:20:02] we ask you to be part of this meeting.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Oh Lord, this is one of your
[1:20:07] ordinances that Lord you told us to do.
[1:20:10] And this evening, Father, as you said in
[1:20:12] your word, where two or three are
[1:20:14] gathered in your name, there you be.
[1:20:17] Father, tonight we believe that you are
[1:20:19] here with us dining with you, Lord
[1:20:21] Jesus.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; And Father, we want to pray for each and
[1:20:24] everyone that made it this evening. And
[1:20:27] Father, in obedience to your word, came
[1:20:30] here this evening to partake this for
[1:20:32] this communion service. We ask you,
[1:20:35] Father, to bless us all together as we
[1:20:38] partake this.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Father, this is the blood that is shed
[1:20:41] on Calvary. The blood that never loses
[1:20:45] its power.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Father, as your children are going to
[1:20:48] file over here, Lord, we receive that
[1:20:51] blessing. Father, even those that could
[1:20:53] not make it here, Father, maybe they are
[1:20:55] working, maybe they are sick in their
[1:20:58] body, whatever reason, Lord,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; may you feed them as well.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to thank you. This is an
[1:21:04] opportunity. We might not be able to do
[1:21:06] this again. And so if we find it today
[1:21:09] doing this, Lord, we want to thank you.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; And father, we ask you to sanctify it
[1:21:14] for nourishment. The hands that are
[1:21:16] going to hold it, Lord, may you sanctify
[1:21:18] it as well. For in Jesus name that we
[1:21:20] pray over this wine. Amen.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Just start with folks over here.
