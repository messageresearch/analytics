[42:10] this microphone in it would be great
[42:13] amen The Book of John the 14th chapter
[42:17] and we want to look in the 12th verse of
[42:20] John 14.
[42:22] um
[42:23] for those of you that don't know me I'm
[42:25] brother Andrew Glover I don't have any
[42:27] strange doctrines I've just got the
[42:29] message so somebody told me one time
[42:32] said well all you God's the culture
[42:33] brother Branham I said that's all I need
[42:35] amen it's the Vindicated word of the
[42:38] hour amen and I believe it's going to
[42:40] address a bride for a Rapture amen amen
[42:42] The Book of John the 14th chapter
[42:45] and the 12th verse I know it's a very
[42:48] familiar reading to you in John 14 12
[42:50] Jesus you're speaking he says verily
[42:53] verily I say unto you
[42:55] he that believeth on me
[42:58] The Works that I do shall he do also
[43:02] brother Brahman said that's the head
[43:03] speaking to the body
[43:05] and Greater Works in this shall he do
[43:07] because I go unto my father now we know
[43:10] brother Brahman said Greater Works not
[43:12] in quality but in quantity he said he
[43:14] stopped nature raised the dead healed
[43:16] the sick said nothing greater could be
[43:18] done there would just be more of it the
[43:20] 13th verse and whatsoever ye shall ask
[43:23] in my name that will I do
[43:26] that the father may be glorified in the
[43:30] son
[43:30] if he shall ask anything in my name I
[43:34] love the authority of these next few
[43:36] words I will do it if you ask anything
[43:41] in my name I will do it now in the book
[43:45] of Hebrews 11 and verse 1.
[43:48] I know it's a very a familiar reading to
[43:51] you tonight Hebrews 11 and we want to
[43:54] look in the first verse
[43:56] um
[43:59] Hebrews 11 and verse number
[44:02] one
[44:09] Hebrews 11 and verse 1. Paul here
[44:13] writing he says now Faith is the
[44:17] substance of things hoped for
[44:19] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[44:22] for by it so by faith for by faith the
[44:26] elders obtained a good report
[44:30] so by faith they obtained a good report
[44:32] now watch what he says here and through
[44:34] faith we understand so by faith and
[44:37] through faith we understand that the
[44:40] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[44:44] that things which are seen were not made
[44:47] of things which do appear amen the
[44:51] things which are seen were not made of
[44:53] things which do appear amen we ask the
[44:57] Lord this evening to add the blessing to
[44:58] reading of his word is you can have your
[45:00] seats here uh
[45:02] amen
[45:04] we'll get it straightened out here in
[45:05] just a minute
[45:06] amen
[45:09] praise the Lord It's Working amen amen
[45:13] we want to tonight by the help of the
[45:15] Lord I tell you when we get to heaven
[45:17] there'll be no microphones
[45:18] amen I thank brother brother Daryl Ward
[45:21] said the other day he said everywhere I
[45:23] go he said I have microphone trouble and
[45:25] he said if I get to heaven and they hand
[45:26] me a microphone I'll know I didn't make
[45:28] it so uh but we we thank the Lord for
[45:31] for allowing these things to work out
[45:33] here tonight amen uh from those
[45:35] scriptures I want to tonight just a
[45:37] simple thought here on my heart but if I
[45:39] would title this tonight I want to speak
[45:40] to you for a few moments here on the
[45:43] thought of the bride's Paradox uh the
[45:45] bride's Paradox you know brother Branham
[45:48] preaches the message and I know you're
[45:49] very familiar with it he preaches the
[45:51] message about six different times and he
[45:53] calls it a paradox and I just want to
[45:56] maybe open up here tonight and make this
[45:59] declaration of faith and I believe amen
[46:01] that we are living in a season of
[46:03] paradox how many would agree with me
[46:05] we're living in a season of paradox now
[46:08] when brother Brandon preaches this he
[46:09] said it like this he said now according
[46:11] to Webster he said the Paradox is
[46:13] something that seems incredible but it's
[46:16] true he said therefore a paradox then
[46:18] would be the the same as a miracle he
[46:21] said a paradox is when something that
[46:23] seems like it just couldn't be the
[46:25] knowledge of the human mind it's all
[46:27] together incredible but yet it's proven
[46:30] true so a paradox is something that is
[46:33] incredible but it's true he said it's
[46:35] something that seems like it just
[46:37] couldn't be amen the knowledge of the
[46:39] human mind but it's incredible but yet
[46:41] it's proven true he said now a miracle
[46:44] would be the same thing for a miracle
[46:46] amen cannot be explained so when Birdman
[46:48] says a paradox we could easily say a
[46:51] miracle he said a miracle is something
[46:53] that happens that you cannot explain it
[46:56] that makes it a paradox amen it's
[46:58] incredible but yet it's the truth it's
[47:00] incredible but yet it's the truth he
[47:02] said now people today a lot of
[47:04] modernists believe that the days of
[47:06] Miracle surpassed they don't even
[47:08] believe in such a thing as a miracle he
[47:10] said but yet I believe that the world is
[47:12] full of Miracles how many agree said
[47:14] with brother Brown that the world is
[47:16] full of Miracles he said I believe amen
[47:18] that the Paradox is constantly so as we
[47:22] said another word for Paradox is a
[47:24] miracle and the prophet of God said I
[47:26] believe that Paradox is constantly I
[47:28] believe that Paradox is continually now
[47:30] when you look through the Bible the
[47:32] scripture actually records about 45
[47:35] miracles of Christ that he performed
[47:37] amen throughout the New Testament and I
[47:39] I believe it like this I've heard it
[47:41] said before amen that we we shall see
[47:43] Miracles we've all heard that I even
[47:45] believe it's a song that we shall see
[47:47] Miracles but I happen to believe amen
[47:49] that we have seen Miracles amen we are
[47:52] seeing Miracles and we shall see
[47:54] Miracles I I don't believe that we're
[47:56] just we're just looking at past Miracles
[47:58] or looking for future Miracles amen but
[48:00] I believe that Miracles are actually
[48:02] sitting here tonight amen because
[48:04] brother man said anything outside of the
[48:06] ordinary that's a miracle
[48:09] anything outside of the ordinary is a
[48:12] miracle now you say ordinary well we're
[48:14] living in a day and time where anything
[48:16] amen ordinary is normally not going to
[48:19] be the things of God and anything
[48:21] extraordinary or out of the ordinary
[48:23] amen is the things that God recognizes
[48:25] now when you think of this you realize
[48:27] in this generation it's not ordinary
[48:29] Amen to believe that God sent a prophet
[48:32] but actually you're sitting here tonight
[48:33] amen believing that God fulfilled his
[48:36] word amen by sending Malachi 4 so that
[48:39] actually amen is a miracle it's
[48:42] something amen that's out of the
[48:44] ordinary but it's it's incredible but
[48:46] it's true now when you when you look at
[48:48] this but remember said the world is full
[48:50] of paradox he said it like this one
[48:51] place he said the Earth itself is a
[48:55] paradox Hebrews 11 3 said through faith
[48:57] we understand amen that the worlds were
[49:00] framed by the word of God Amen so
[49:03] they're the things which are seen were
[49:04] not made of things which to appear
[49:06] remember I said this very Earth that
[49:08] we're sitting is a paradox what is it
[49:10] amen it's the word of God made manifest
[49:13] see he made it without anything to make
[49:16] it out of only thing he had amen was his
[49:19] word so the only thing he had Amen to
[49:22] make this world was his word and he said
[49:24] and his word is a creation in itself his
[49:28] word is a creation in itself when it
[49:31] once it spoke it could never return
[49:33] again until it is accomplished that
[49:36] which it's been purpose for he said oh
[49:38] doctor I'm beginning to feel religious
[49:40] his word amen cannot return until it is
[49:43] accomplished that which it has been
[49:45] spoken for now God he said is waiting
[49:48] this afternoon on a people amen that'll
[49:51] take a hold of that word and hold on to
[49:53] it until it's accomplished what it is
[49:55] purpose for so amen the word of God with
[49:58] the Bible says he sent his word and he
[50:00] healed the people so when God sends his
[50:02] word amen his word will not return unto
[50:05] him void but it will accomplish that
[50:08] when he sent it for to do if he sends
[50:10] his word to heal it's going to heal if
[50:12] he sends his word to deliver it's going
[50:14] to deliver if he sends his word to save
[50:17] it's going to save if he sent his word
[50:19] amen to perform a miracle that's going
[50:21] to perform a miracle because whatever
[50:23] God sends his word for amen it's going
[50:26] to do that and his word is not going to
[50:28] return unto him void now when you think
[50:31] about that I love how he says that the
[50:33] word itself is creative how many
[50:35] believes amen that we are actually under
[50:38] the power of a creative word
[50:40] we're actually sitting here tonight amen
[50:43] under the power of a creative word but
[50:44] like this he said every man and
[50:47] woman in here has everlasting life amen
[50:50] by the creative word of God who spoke
[50:52] things into existence another place he
[50:55] says in the beginning was the word and
[50:57] the word spoken was a creative word and
[51:00] every word that's spoken cannot be taken
[51:02] back for a mistake so when God speaks
[51:05] his word there's no there's no
[51:07] possibility of God taking his word back
[51:09] and saying well I made a mistake when I
[51:11] said this or I made a mistake when I
[51:13] said that amen but his word will
[51:15] accomplish that which he sent it for to
[51:17] do he said in the beginning was the word
[51:19] and the Word was with God and the Word
[51:21] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[51:24] dwelt Among Us which is Christ now the
[51:26] word of God written in the Bible is his
[51:29] word to us so amen it's not just in
[51:32] general amen but this word is a specific
[51:34] word this word amen is a it's a direct
[51:37] word and it's not just to anybody amen
[51:39] but it's a love letter to his bride he
[51:42] said and every promise has the same
[51:44] power amen of creation behind it that
[51:47] God's word did at the beginning if we
[51:49] believe it to be the word of God see it
[51:52] depends on where this seed Falls if it
[51:54] falls into ground a ground that can
[51:56] create a moisture a nourishment around
[51:58] the promise of God it'll bring forth the
[52:00] promise the Bible made he said the right
[52:03] mental attitude towards any Divine
[52:05] promise of God will bring it to pass if
[52:07] you'll just look at it and take care of
[52:09] the word amen because the infinite God
[52:12] spoke it it's God's word amen so the
[52:14] beautiful thing about this is its
[52:16] creative word amen and is falling into
[52:19] creative ground and there is a creative
[52:21] power behind it listen friends amen the
[52:24] prophet of God tells you that you were
[52:25] born amen with a gene seed in your soul
[52:28] he said you were prepared ground from
[52:31] before amen the foundation of the world
[52:33] when you came into this age you was
[52:36] prepared for one purpose and that
[52:38] purpose was to receive him in the age
[52:41] that you're living listen amen if you
[52:42] were living in Luther's day you would
[52:44] have received Luther's message if you
[52:46] were living in Wesley's day or Pentecost
[52:48] day you would receive those messages but
[52:50] guess what you're not in those days you
[52:52] are in this day amen and this is the
[52:55] bride's day so God is not sending amen
[52:58] just a message of justification he's not
[53:00] just sending a message of sanctification
[53:02] come on he's not even just sending a
[53:04] message of the restoration that gives
[53:06] amen that he's sending a restoration
[53:09] message which is restoring the whole
[53:11] word amen to put you in position to
[53:14] perform a miracle you say brother Andrew
[53:16] what is that Miracle going to be it's
[53:17] not going to be walking on water it's
[53:20] not going to be raising the dead so much
[53:21] it's going to be some morning amen
[53:24] between six and nine your bodies are
[53:26] going to be changed listen this word is
[53:28] not a powerless word amen it's not a
[53:30] helpless word this is a powerful word
[53:32] it's a creative word it's an
[53:34] authoritative word and the only thing
[53:36] this word needs is not your education it
[53:39] does not need your ability it does not
[53:41] need your understanding this word needs
[53:44] your body Amen to manifest itself
[53:46] through amen it's the creative word of
[53:49] God falling into creative ground and
[53:51] Jesus said abide in me and my words in
[53:54] you then ask what you will and it shall
[53:56] be given to you he said where is the
[53:58] church standing at amen let me ask you
[54:01] tonight friends where is the church
[54:03] standing at he said Moses said let there
[54:05] be frogs and there wasn't a frog Amen in
[54:08] the country but in an hour's time amen
[54:10] there were about foot deep in places he
[54:13] said what was it God the Creator amen
[54:16] was hiding himself in a simple man he
[54:19] said I want to ask you something if the
[54:21] blood of a bull or a goat be used for a
[54:23] bleach which can only cover amen could
[54:26] put a man in position to speak amen the
[54:29] creative word of God bring flies into
[54:31] existence he said then why would you
[54:33] stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ
[54:35] amen could speak a squirrel or something
[54:38] into existence listen amen people amen
[54:41] you going to church and tell them that
[54:42] Moses spoke and there were flies and
[54:44] then there weren't amen there was blood
[54:46] and then there wasn't amen they'll shout
[54:48] right with you amen but tell them that
[54:50] in this age amen a man was hat in the
[54:52] woods honey and needed squirrels and
[54:55] spoke and squirrels come into existence
[54:57] amen and they'll call you crazy you know
[54:59] why amen because they're not prepared
[55:02] ground to receive the creative word in
[55:04] the age that we're living but this bride
[55:06] amen has the ability to receive amen
[55:10] whatever God sends her amen he sent her
[55:12] Seven Seals and she received it amen he
[55:15] sent her the third pool and she received
[55:17] it amen he centered the pro amen the
[55:20] Spoken Word by creation power and she
[55:22] received it he said don't stumble over
[55:25] Simplicity amen believe that he still
[55:27] remains God
[55:29] hey man how many here tonight believes
[55:32] that He Still Remains God see if you say
[55:35] to this mountain be moved and don't
[55:37] doubt in your heart amen but believe
[55:39] what you said will come to pass amen you
[55:41] can have what you're saying now now
[55:43] sometimes people are getting their mind
[55:44] they meant to see a miracle we got to
[55:46] have a lot of people but a prophet
[55:48] changed that and said it only takes one
[55:51] believe her to see a paradox amen the
[55:54] only thing God's waiting on is to get
[55:56] one man not an organization amen not
[55:59] denomination one man he can wrap his
[56:01] Spirit into amen that he'll take the
[56:04] rest amen and there will be another
[56:06] Paradox listen if I didn't have the
[56:09] words of William Branham I could not
[56:10] preach to you tonight the bride's
[56:12] Paradox because as far as I could go
[56:15] amen was Moses Paradox and John's
[56:18] Paradox and Paul's Paradox amen but a
[56:20] prophet said if the same God that God in
[56:23] them amen gets in the church today there
[56:26] will be another Paradox he said until he
[56:29] can get someone come completely
[56:30] surrendered amen that's the way God does
[56:32] his work amen he used his paradoxes amen
[56:36] God looking for somebody amen who is
[56:38] completely surrendered and through that
[56:41] surrendered vessel he will perform
[56:43] another Paradox remember said see what
[56:46] we're either surrendered to amen Israel
[56:48] surrendered to God or we're surrendered
[56:50] to the devil you realize that amen every
[56:52] person in here tonight you're not your
[56:54] own person I don't care how much you
[56:55] think you are you're not your own person
[56:57] you're either surrendered to God or your
[57:00] surrender to the devil remember I said
[57:02] the maniac and gadaro is just so mean
[57:04] till he was cutting himself with rocks
[57:06] amen they'd binding with chains he'd
[57:08] break them he said now that's the
[57:10] devil's power did you ever fool around
[57:11] with somebody that was a maniac
[57:14] somebody with double their power
[57:25] it was Satan
[57:26] IC
[57:34] and will give them twice their strength
[57:36] amen now if a person is completely
[57:38] surrendered to the devil we'll give him
[57:41] twice his strength he said then what
[57:43] will a man completely surrender to God
[57:45] Amen it'll make you so weak maybe you're
[57:48] crippled and you cannot stand up amen
[57:50] but surrender yourself to God and new
[57:53] life and new strength comes in and
[57:55] you'll go to walking away listen friends
[57:57] amen up Shaw sit there for 66 years it
[58:01] was not William Branham that brought him
[58:03] out of the wheelchair amen it was a
[58:05] paradox amen that God got into a man
[58:07] amen and he surrendered himself to
[58:10] believe amen this Supernatural
[58:12] manifestation and when he surrendered
[58:14] himself to it it released his strength
[58:16] in him listen friends I don't know about
[58:17] you but I think we've been sitting on
[58:19] the premises long enough I think it's
[58:21] time to stand on the Promises amen and
[58:24] the only way we can stand on the
[58:26] Promises is if a supernatural strength
[58:28] will come into the church and will
[58:30] release you from the infirmity we'll
[58:32] release you from the disease where
[58:34] release you from the complex listen I
[58:36] believe my God is still in the releasing
[58:38] business I believe he can still release
[58:40] the young he can still release the old
[58:42] he can still heal the he can
[58:44] still raise the dead because he remains
[58:47] to be kind he's just looking for
[58:49] somebody to believe that he's still God
[58:51] and His word is true and his power is
[58:54] here
[58:56] it don't take a hundred it takes one it
[58:59] don't take a thousand it takes one one
[59:01] person completely surrendered to God
[59:04] with the anointing of God upon them amen
[59:07] you'll get up and walk amen you'll
[59:09] believe again you'll worship again
[59:11] you'll Rejoice again because it's not
[59:15] you it's the god of paradox
[59:17] oh Hallelujah
[59:19] my God is not dead he's a miracle worker
[59:22] he's a soul saver he's a home restorer
[59:26] he's a church Revival Giver he's Jesus
[59:29] Christ and he remains to be the high and
[59:32] the Mighty God
[59:33] oh you're superlander it's impossible
[59:36] not if Jehovah's in the midst because
[59:38] brother remember said Jehovah is the god
[59:41] of Miracles
[59:43] that's what we're under tonight we're
[59:45] under Revelation that Jehovah of the old
[59:47] is the Jesus
[59:51] Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the
[59:54] new then can I tell you where our
[59:56] strength comes from don't get him mad
[59:58] but our strengths don't come from the
[59:59] music our strengths don't come from the
[1:00:01] personality of a Preacher amen our
[1:00:04] strength comes from Jehovah
[1:00:06] how are you still sitting here tonight
[1:00:08] it's because the strength of Jehovah has
[1:00:11] become your strength how are you still
[1:00:13] believing this word because it's not you
[1:00:15] believe in it it's somebody on the
[1:00:17] inside of you amen that's stronger and
[1:00:20] mightier and more powerful than you amen
[1:00:23] remember said it's God believing his
[1:00:25] word through you
[1:00:26] love what Isaiah said he said behold God
[1:00:29] is my salvation I will trust and not be
[1:00:32] afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my
[1:00:35] strength he is my song and he has also
[1:00:38] become my salvation he said trust you in
[1:00:40] the Lord forever amen for in the Lord
[1:00:43] Jehovah is Everlasting strength well I'm
[1:00:47] just going to preach because I feel like
[1:00:48] I can amen you know what I want to say
[1:00:50] we're stronger now than we've ever been
[1:00:54] we're stronger now than we've ever been
[1:00:57] I know we got more problems but we got
[1:00:59] more shrinks we got more situations but
[1:01:02] we got more strength we got more against
[1:01:05] us but we got more strength and I want
[1:01:07] to say what the Bible said if God be for
[1:01:10] us then who can be against us if God is
[1:01:13] with us if God is in us if he is
[1:01:16] anointing us then there's no devil too
[1:01:18] big there's no mountain too high there's
[1:01:21] no trial too long but what this bride
[1:01:24] will persevere through because she's
[1:01:26] completely Anointed with the strength of
[1:01:28] Jehovah
[1:01:30] oh god Jehovah is our strength Jehovah
[1:01:34] is the god of paradox you say but Andrew
[1:01:36] what makes a paradox but remember said
[1:01:38] when somebody believes God and takes him
[1:01:40] at his word
[1:01:42] when somebody believes God and takes him
[1:01:45] at his word that's what makes a paradox
[1:01:48] now how many will agree with me that
[1:01:50] God's word is the truth
[1:01:52] and you know what the prophet said he
[1:01:55] said truth is Stranger Than Fiction
[1:01:57] think about that truth is Stranger Than
[1:02:00] Fiction he said like somebody told me
[1:02:02] one time that William Tell amen shot an
[1:02:04] apple off of his boy's head he said it
[1:02:06] never even happened he said but people
[1:02:08] believe that he said to prove that
[1:02:11] fiction amen sounds more real than truth
[1:02:13] I love this one he says I was over in
[1:02:15] France one time he said I was touring
[1:02:17] around I was up on a hill and he said
[1:02:19] when he got up on this hill they said
[1:02:21] now don't say nothing he said well why
[1:02:23] can't I talk they said well because this
[1:02:25] is a it's kind of like a uh uh how would
[1:02:29] I said a reverent place he said there
[1:02:31] was a man a hundred years ago supposed
[1:02:33] to be a saint got in the fight now
[1:02:35] listen to this he got in the fight down
[1:02:37] there somehow got his head cut off so he
[1:02:39] just decided he didn't want to die there
[1:02:41] a man gets in a fight gets his head cut
[1:02:44] off and then decides he don't want to
[1:02:46] die there so he just picks up his head
[1:02:48] puts it under his arm walks five miles
[1:02:50] up the hill and died and they built
[1:02:52] Church Reverend said you expect people
[1:02:55] to believe says Tommy right is that I
[1:02:57] said that's only by faith isn't it he
[1:02:59] said I want to tell you right now amen
[1:03:02] my faith is too weak for that now here's
[1:03:04] what I love about this amen as a prophet
[1:03:07] said my faith is too weak to believe
[1:03:09] that fiction now you realize the world
[1:03:11] we're living in actually will accept
[1:03:13] fiction and they will reject Vindicated
[1:03:15] truth they will accept that William Tell
[1:03:18] shot an apple off of this boy's head and
[1:03:21] they'll deny that a cloud appeared over
[1:03:23] a prophet's credit crib amen they will
[1:03:26] believe that a man had his head cut off
[1:03:28] packed it five miles up the hill and
[1:03:31] they'll denounce it that seven angels
[1:03:33] met a prophet and revealed to him his
[1:03:35] commission and sent him back East to
[1:03:37] open the word they will accept Tommy Rod
[1:03:40] amen and reject Vindicated truth now you
[1:03:42] know why they'll do that because it's an
[1:03:44] evil world and it's seasoned with
[1:03:46] fiction but I want to say this we are
[1:03:49] Sanctified by the god of righteousness
[1:03:51] can I say this young people we are in
[1:03:53] the world but we're not of the world
[1:03:56] we're in laodicea but we're not of
[1:03:59] laodicea program said look it's a
[1:04:02] paradox now in John 17 verse 15 Jesus
[1:04:05] actually prayed over you and said I pray
[1:04:07] that thou shouldest take them out of the
[1:04:08] world Amen but thou shouldest keep them
[1:04:11] from the evil so they would be in the
[1:04:13] world the bride would be in the world
[1:04:15] but she would not be a part of the world
[1:04:17] see they are not of the world even as I
[1:04:20] am not of the world see sanctify them
[1:04:22] through the truth I want this sanctify
[1:04:25] do it sets you aside it cleans you up
[1:04:29] sanctify them through the truth amen for
[1:04:31] Thy word is truth now I want to read you
[1:04:34] something here from the church age book
[1:04:35] the prophet of God said here is most
[1:04:37] evidently set forth at the perfect
[1:04:39] manifestation of God in the sun was by
[1:04:42] the indwelling spirit manifesting in
[1:04:45] word and works somebody say that with me
[1:04:47] word
[1:04:48] and works so we have the word and we
[1:04:51] have the works he said that is exactly
[1:04:54] what we have been teaching all along
[1:04:55] then when the bride will get back to
[1:04:58] being a word bride she will produce the
[1:05:01] very works that Jesus produced I've met
[1:05:04] people and they'll say like this brother
[1:05:05] Mary we're a word church we're just a
[1:05:08] word church we ain't in all those Works
[1:05:09] we're just a word church then I preached
[1:05:12] in churches and they we're on in that
[1:05:13] word we ain't in all that revelation we
[1:05:15] just want to see the works but here's
[1:05:16] the funny thing you can't have the word
[1:05:18] and not have the works
[1:05:20] and you won't have the works without
[1:05:23] having the word they're Inseparable
[1:05:25] they're the same thing see the word is
[1:05:27] God the spirit is God they are all one
[1:05:30] they cannot work apart from the other if
[1:05:33] one truly has the spirit of God he will
[1:05:35] have the word of God that's how it was
[1:05:37] with the prophets they had the
[1:05:39] indwelling spirit of God and the word
[1:05:41] came to them he said now Jesus in him
[1:05:44] was the spirit without measure and the
[1:05:47] word came to him he said now watch he
[1:05:50] was filled with the holy ghost from his
[1:05:51] mother's womb speaking of John when he
[1:05:53] was baptizing in Jordan the word of God
[1:05:55] Jesus came to him see the word always
[1:05:57] comes to the truly Spirit field that is
[1:06:01] the evidence of being filled with the
[1:06:02] Holy Ghost that is what Jesus said would
[1:06:05] be the evidence he said I will pray the
[1:06:07] father he will send you another
[1:06:09] comforter he may abide with you forever
[1:06:11] even the spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:06:14] cannot receive he said now we know what
[1:06:17] truth is he said Thy word is truth amen
[1:06:21] John John 8 43 why do you not understand
[1:06:24] my speech even because you cannot hear
[1:06:27] my word did you notice that Jesus said
[1:06:30] that the world could not receive the
[1:06:32] Holy Ghost you are in the world but
[1:06:35] you're not of the world and the world
[1:06:37] cannot receive the Holy Ghost amen
[1:06:39] neither could they receive the word
[1:06:41] because the spirit and the word are one
[1:06:44] and if you have the Holy Spirit as the
[1:06:46] prophets amen the word would come to you
[1:06:49] amen and you would receive it see John
[1:06:52] 14 26 he said here again we find the
[1:06:55] word coming because of the spirit of God
[1:06:59] now somebody asked me one time amen
[1:07:01] where do you find this well it's in John
[1:07:02] 16 13 gives us a beautiful commentary of
[1:07:06] that one scripture he says how be it
[1:07:08] when he the spirit of Truth he stops and
[1:07:10] says word is come
[1:07:13] he will guide you into all truth he
[1:07:15] stops and says Thy word is truth and he
[1:07:19] shall not speak of himself but
[1:07:20] whatsoever he shall hear he stops and
[1:07:23] says the word of God that shall he speak
[1:07:25] he says word and he will show you things
[1:07:28] to come he said the spirit bringing the
[1:07:31] word of Prophecy let me say this to you
[1:07:33] you're not just church members you're
[1:07:35] not just citizens of Canada amen you're
[1:07:38] a prophetic class of people that's why
[1:07:40] this message had to come to you because
[1:07:42] the spirit brings the word of Prophecy
[1:07:45] see I want you to catch this he never
[1:07:47] said the evidence would be that you
[1:07:49] danced or spoke in tongues or prophesied
[1:07:51] amen the evidence would be that you
[1:07:53] would be in the truth you would be in
[1:07:55] the word of God for your age amen see
[1:07:57] evidence has to do with receiving the
[1:08:00] word the proof of the indwelling spirit
[1:08:02] was to acknowledge and follow what God's
[1:08:06] Prophet gave for his age as he set the
[1:08:07] church in order I love this last part he
[1:08:10] said the evidence of a Spirit-filled
[1:08:12] Christian believer is not to produce the
[1:08:15] truth the word but to receive the truth
[1:08:18] the word and to believe it and to obey
[1:08:20] it
[1:08:22] the believer's responsibility is to
[1:08:25] receive the word amen obey the word come
[1:08:28] on church amen amen believe the word
[1:08:30] receive the word and Obey it listen
[1:08:32] people say well we're spiritual but you
[1:08:34] can't quote a prophet not very spiritual
[1:08:36] to me
[1:08:37] come on we're we're we're we're we're
[1:08:39] really we're really spiritual amen but
[1:08:42] we disagree with brother random here not
[1:08:43] very spiritual to me because the prophet
[1:08:45] said that the spirit only comes to the
[1:08:48] word that's why the spirit don't come to
[1:08:50] your feelings the spirit don't come to
[1:08:52] your emotions the spirit comes to the
[1:08:55] word the prophet of God said it very
[1:08:57] beautiful he said we are in the Battle
[1:08:59] For Truth amen all them lost sins amen
[1:09:03] must be restored he said and we're
[1:09:05] looking for Malachi 4 we're looking for
[1:09:07] his manifestation and we'll see the
[1:09:10] Vindicated word of God he said now there
[1:09:12] will be just a few understand it amen
[1:09:15] isn't that powerful there will be just a
[1:09:18] few understand it as it was in the days
[1:09:20] of Noah so will it be in the coming of
[1:09:22] the son of man amen as it was in the
[1:09:24] days of lots amen so shall it be in the
[1:09:27] coming of the son of man there will be
[1:09:28] very few saved amen translated in that
[1:09:31] time amen and one of the mysteries of
[1:09:34] that church is being taken up now how
[1:09:36] many will agree we're in the Battle For
[1:09:38] Truth
[1:09:39] we're in the world we're not of the
[1:09:42] world but we're in the Battle For Truth
[1:09:44] amen now somebody say well what what is
[1:09:47] the Victory Day for the Battle of truth
[1:09:48] it's the rapture the Victory Day for the
[1:09:51] Battle of Truth is the rapture you say
[1:09:54] how can you say that amen because the
[1:09:56] word must be restored you say then why
[1:09:58] are you focusing why why is this message
[1:10:01] so focused on restoring the word because
[1:10:03] the prophet said the bride takes the
[1:10:05] Rapture by the word amen when I when I
[1:10:08] caught that Revelation I about shouted
[1:10:09] all over my study amen the bride takes
[1:10:12] the Rapture by the word she does not
[1:10:14] take the Rapture by the way she feels
[1:10:16] she does not take the Rapture by Royal
[1:10:18] conditions she does not take the Rapture
[1:10:21] by who's in the White House come on
[1:10:23] church she does not take the Rapture
[1:10:25] amen by the conditions of the church she
[1:10:28] takes the Rapture by the word that's why
[1:10:31] you had to break out of feelings you had
[1:10:33] to break out of the emotions you had to
[1:10:35] break out a sensation you had to step
[1:10:37] over into the promise of the word amen
[1:10:40] to believe God regardless of how you
[1:10:42] feel regardless of what you concede
[1:10:44] regardless of what you can hear
[1:10:46] regardless of what you can remember you
[1:10:48] got to remember this one thing that's
[1:10:50] the word
[1:10:52] she'll go in the Rapture by the word now
[1:10:55] in this word that we're living it's a
[1:10:57] word age for the bride but listen we're
[1:10:59] in the world but we're not of the world
[1:11:01] I haven't left the Paradox we're in the
[1:11:04] world but we're not of the world so
[1:11:06] we're in a bright age can we agree but
[1:11:09] remember said we're in a bright age but
[1:11:11] he also said we're living in an
[1:11:12] intellectual age so in this intellectual
[1:11:15] age it's a bride age and the bride is
[1:11:18] preserved by the word that restored the
[1:11:21] bride he said God keeps his word in this
[1:11:24] intellectual age he said what is God
[1:11:26] warning he's wanting people to believe
[1:11:28] in a paradox he said now I believe it
[1:11:30] could be a paradox right here I believe
[1:11:33] that God is willing and wanting there
[1:11:34] are two powerful words God is willing
[1:11:37] and wanting to take his people and show
[1:11:40] himself if he can only get a man or
[1:11:42] woman boy or girl to lay down their own
[1:11:44] thoughts and become a prisoner to him
[1:11:47] and believe him he is the word amen and
[1:11:51] the Word was made cash now watch and now
[1:11:53] he is in you oh that's a powerful point
[1:11:56] now he is in you the hope of glory he's
[1:12:01] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:12:04] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:12:07] do shall he do also listen friends a
[1:12:09] prophet directly connected amen of
[1:12:12] paradox with John 14 and connected it to
[1:12:15] the Greater Works and announced amen
[1:12:17] that the God that was above us has been
[1:12:20] God With Us amen but now he's God in us
[1:12:23] you say how did everybody else get a
[1:12:26] paradox because the Paradox was not
[1:12:28] coming from the flesh it was coming from
[1:12:30] the word and the Word was in the flesh
[1:12:33] which was performing the Paradox listen
[1:12:36] let me say this plain as I know how amen
[1:12:38] the god of paradox is now in you
[1:12:42] the god of paradox is now in this bride
[1:12:46] you say well what is this bride she is
[1:12:49] the Sons and Daughters of God well
[1:12:50] brother Andrew someday someday will be
[1:12:53] the sons what about first John 3. amen
[1:12:56] now are we the sons of God see and it
[1:12:59] does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:13:01] amen but we know that when he shall
[1:13:03] appear we shall be like him amen for we
[1:13:06] shall see him as he is can I make an
[1:13:10] announcement to you he's already
[1:13:12] appeared
[1:13:14] we're not looking for his appearing
[1:13:17] we're looking for his coming his
[1:13:19] appearing was Luke 17 30. his appearing
[1:13:22] was Revelation 10 1. we are not looking
[1:13:25] for his appearing he has been identified
[1:13:27] the Invincible oh God the identified
[1:13:30] characteristic of God has been made
[1:13:32] visible in the church in these last days
[1:13:35] now we are the sons of God not we're
[1:13:38] going to be not we might be not someday
[1:13:40] we might work hard enough and become a
[1:13:42] son amen we will always be the sons of
[1:13:45] God
[1:13:47] well that's a shouting point we will
[1:13:49] always be the sons of God Amen we are
[1:13:52] this morning we are this very hour
[1:13:56] if you call a revelation that you'd whip
[1:13:59] a hundred devils in two seconds amen
[1:14:01] you're not going to be the sons of God
[1:14:03] you might not be the sons of God right
[1:14:06] now this very night this very hour this
[1:14:09] very second you are the sons and
[1:14:12] daughters of God
[1:14:14] come on you got checkbook Authority you
[1:14:17] are an invincible Army you are the
[1:14:19] Overcomers you are the elect lady
[1:14:23] well someday what about today well
[1:14:26] brother Andrew in the Millennium will
[1:14:28] have Miracles we're not going to need
[1:14:30] miracles in the Millennium we need
[1:14:32] Miracles right now
[1:14:35] well what are you saying I'm saying this
[1:14:37] we are in the god of paradox somebody
[1:14:40] say that with me we are in the god of
[1:14:44] paradox and and
[1:14:47] the god of paradox is in US
[1:14:52] we are in him
[1:14:56] Hallelujah we are in him and he is in US
[1:15:01] If any man be in Christ he is a new
[1:15:05] creature the old things are passed away
[1:15:07] and behold all things are become new
[1:15:09] come on what is it's Christ The Mystery
[1:15:12] of God revealed in you
[1:15:15] oh if any man be in Christ who is the
[1:15:18] god of paradox and if a god of paradox
[1:15:21] being any man the hope of glory
[1:15:25] well I feel like preaching If any man be
[1:15:27] in Christ and Christ be in that man
[1:15:30] every born-again member of the Bride of
[1:15:32] Jesus Christ is a paradox
[1:15:37] he said you're a paradox in yourself he
[1:15:41] said what are you a perfect example of a
[1:15:43] paradox he said how that you receive the
[1:15:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[1:15:48] something happened to you you were
[1:15:51] changed your whole being anyone could
[1:15:53] look at that and know what a paradox is
[1:15:56] it's a miracle
[1:15:58] come on church when something transpired
[1:16:02] in your soul you were changed he said
[1:16:04] then there must be a paradox for you to
[1:16:08] become a Christian
[1:16:10] because no one can change a spirit in a
[1:16:13] man and get him a new birth outside of
[1:16:15] God he said God Alone is the only one
[1:16:19] God Alone is the only one that can do it
[1:16:22] and it's a miracle how that God can take
[1:16:25] a man's thinking he can take his ways he
[1:16:29] can take his life and everything and
[1:16:32] change it from what it was to what it
[1:16:34] can be what he can make it I know where
[1:16:37] some of y'all sitting right now you're
[1:16:39] sitting there saying well brother Andrew
[1:16:41] I'm not what I want to be I'm not what I
[1:16:43] want to be I'll agree I'm not either but
[1:16:46] I can raise my hand and say thank God
[1:16:49] I'm not what I used to be
[1:16:52] I may not be what I can what I want to
[1:16:55] be but I'm not what I used to be but I'm
[1:16:58] on my way to being what I want to be
[1:17:01] because the god of paradox Has Come Into
[1:17:04] My Soul by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:07] he has changed my ways he has changed my
[1:17:10] thinking he has changed my nature he has
[1:17:13] changed my habits he has changed my talk
[1:17:16] he has changed my walk he has changed
[1:17:18] everything about me because he's a
[1:17:21] change in God he's a new creation God
[1:17:25] somebody say well amen not a lot
[1:17:27] changing listen amen it's Jesus on the
[1:17:29] inside
[1:17:31] working on the outside
[1:17:33] oh what a change
[1:17:37] oh what a change
[1:17:41] oh what a change in my life amen you
[1:17:46] just because you don't see it don't mean
[1:17:47] something ain't happening
[1:17:50] come on church just cause you don't see
[1:17:53] it don't mean something ain't happening
[1:17:57] what are you saying brother Andrew I'm
[1:17:58] saying when you're born again it's an
[1:18:00] easy thing for you to believe in
[1:18:01] miracles
[1:18:03] when you're born again because you are a
[1:18:06] part of God see then what is God he's
[1:18:09] his own interpreter
[1:18:11] and how does God interpret his word he
[1:18:14] interprets his word by bringing it to
[1:18:17] pass now I can read you second
[1:18:19] Corinthians 5 17 and take you to Matthew
[1:18:21] Henry's commentary
[1:18:23] I can read you Colossians 1 and take you
[1:18:26] to what Schofield said but that's not
[1:18:28] the true interpretation
[1:18:30] come on but if I read it to you and then
[1:18:34] I point it brother Barry I point it
[1:18:36] brother Mervin I point it some of you
[1:18:38] Believers I'm actually identifying God's
[1:18:41] commentary of his word in this age
[1:18:45] it's a Living Translation it's a living
[1:18:48] interpretation it's a living
[1:18:50] manifestation Christ is the living
[1:18:53] interpretation of his own word listen if
[1:18:57] the spirit of John Dillinger was in me I
[1:18:59] would be a murderer if the spirit of
[1:19:01] Beethoven was in me I would be a
[1:19:03] beautiful piano player I could play
[1:19:05] music like you never heard amen but if
[1:19:08] the spirit of Christ is in me
[1:19:11] come on church if the spirit of Christ
[1:19:13] is in you amen then you'll do what he
[1:19:16] done you'll forgive like Jesus
[1:19:19] you'll love like Jesus you'll pray like
[1:19:22] Jesus you'll come to church like Jesus
[1:19:25] you'll worship like Jesus
[1:19:29] because the spirit of Christ is in you
[1:19:32] he's the living interpretation of his
[1:19:35] own word what are you say about Andrew
[1:19:37] I'm saying amen that this Bible is the
[1:19:40] truth it's this bride is the living
[1:19:42] interpretation of this word of truth
[1:19:45] then I can declare to you tonight that
[1:19:47] we are not we are not following Fables
[1:19:54] we are not following stories
[1:19:57] We are following the word of God but the
[1:20:01] Bible said we have not followed
[1:20:02] cunningly devised fables when we make
[1:20:04] known unto you the power and the coming
[1:20:07] of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eye
[1:20:09] witnesses
[1:20:11] we were eyewitnesses of his majesty come
[1:20:16] on Church what other preacher could
[1:20:19] stand on a platform and tell you that
[1:20:22] when he raised the Widow of named son
[1:20:23] you was there with him when he walked on
[1:20:26] water you walked with him when he went
[1:20:28] up to Calvary you went with him when he
[1:20:30] healed Bartimaeus you was with him no
[1:20:33] other preacher could tell you that amen
[1:20:35] but a word Prophet who was anointed to
[1:20:38] preach the Paradox of the invisible
[1:20:41] Union of a Heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:20:44] Earthly bride could announce to you he's
[1:20:47] in you you have seen him you have heard
[1:20:50] him you have failed him
[1:20:54] oh God I feel like shouting he's in you
[1:20:59] the god of paradox is in you we're not
[1:21:02] following stories we're not following
[1:21:04] Kennedy devised fables I love I love
[1:21:07] that definition cunningly you know what
[1:21:08] it means it means to play the sofas
[1:21:12] the definition of kindly is to play the
[1:21:15] sofas listen to this when you look at
[1:21:17] that word play the sofas it is related
[1:21:20] to skepticism
[1:21:23] now you've got the tapes called the
[1:21:25] trial right
[1:21:26] who is one of the characters
[1:21:29] brother Branham identifies in that
[1:21:30] sermon Mr skeptic
[1:21:33] now listen to what he says he says may
[1:21:36] we see it tonight the living Christ who
[1:21:38] is not dead but is raised again for our
[1:21:41] justification he now lives Among Us he
[1:21:45] now lives Among Us in the person of the
[1:21:50] Holy Ghost may he come tonight and speak
[1:21:53] to every heart that's visible and
[1:21:55] invisible and may he perform in their
[1:21:59] hearts the work of the new birth and
[1:22:01] bring them to the Redemption power
[1:22:06] of his resurrection taking away all
[1:22:09] Shadows of doubt and unbelief are you
[1:22:11] ready for this and destroying all
[1:22:14] skepticism that the church might move on
[1:22:18] in perfect harmony with the will of God
[1:22:21] as presented by the Bible and the Holy
[1:22:24] Spirit now some of y'all say well
[1:22:26] brother Andrew I I don't have no Spirit
[1:22:28] of skepticism okay maybe you don't have
[1:22:31] a spirit of skepticism about the message
[1:22:33] or a spirit of skepticism about the
[1:22:36] prophet but maybe you've got a spirit of
[1:22:38] skepticism about who you are
[1:22:41] one day you're a Son of God the next day
[1:22:43] you don't know one day you're going to
[1:22:45] make it the next day you're lost one day
[1:22:48] all is well the next day all is falling
[1:22:50] apart are you hearing me you know what
[1:22:52] that is that's called a roller coaster
[1:22:53] it's called an emotional roller coaster
[1:22:56] that you're riding and what's what oh
[1:22:59] God how can I preach and what it is it's
[1:23:02] a spirit of skepticism but a prophet of
[1:23:05] God was anointed by the spirit of God
[1:23:07] and in that message from that time in
[1:23:09] Spokane Washington he said my Ministry
[1:23:12] is different he said my Ministry is not
[1:23:14] like a pastor or an evangelist he said
[1:23:17] my Ministry is to declare him he's here
[1:23:24] my Ministry is to declare him he is here
[1:23:28] listen church if there's a spirit of
[1:23:31] skepticism about somebody the last thing
[1:23:34] you want to do is get that spirit in the
[1:23:37] presence of the personal
[1:23:40] I'm on Church listen if I had it I'm
[1:23:42] just going to use you for an example
[1:23:43] brother Mary if I had a spirit of
[1:23:45] skepticism I don't know if a man named
[1:23:47] Barry Johnson actually exists is he
[1:23:49] really a human does he really live is he
[1:23:51] really a person if I had that spirit I
[1:23:53] could go around saying I don't know if
[1:23:55] Barry Johnson's a real person I don't
[1:23:57] know if he's a real person amen but if I
[1:23:59] ever met him or I come in his presence
[1:24:02] amen his presence is enough to deflate
[1:24:05] the skepticism
[1:24:08] yes oh God his presence is enough Amen
[1:24:12] to silence the voice of skepticism and a
[1:24:15] reality set in I know he lives because
[1:24:18] I've seen him I shook his hand
[1:24:22] I've had fellowship with him come on
[1:24:24] church and that's the same way it is you
[1:24:27] know what we need we need an experience
[1:24:29] with a person of this message
[1:24:33] and the person of this message is Jesus
[1:24:37] Christ now brother Birmingham says it
[1:24:39] very plain he said now I know this
[1:24:40] sounds rational but if you'll just bear
[1:24:42] with me a few minutes I believe that ah
[1:24:45] are you hearing this I believe that I by
[1:24:48] God's help with his word and according
[1:24:51] to his word I can bring him right here
[1:24:54] before you
[1:24:56] laughs
[1:24:59] I know this sounds rational but I
[1:25:02] believe that I by God's help with his
[1:25:05] word according to his word can bring him
[1:25:09] right here before you see then what is
[1:25:12] this message it's not a myth
[1:25:15] it's not an imagination it's not a fairy
[1:25:19] tale it's a supernatural manifestation
[1:25:22] of a supernatural God see now now let me
[1:25:26] say it like this the prophecy spoke of
[1:25:28] the end time that in the end time people
[1:25:30] would turn from truth to Fables
[1:25:34] right the Bible says for the time will
[1:25:37] come when they will not endure sound
[1:25:39] Doctrine but after their own lust shall
[1:25:42] they heat to themselves teachers having
[1:25:44] itching ears and they shall turn away
[1:25:46] their ears from the truth and shall be
[1:25:49] turned unto fables now listen to prophet
[1:25:52] he said the separation time is now
[1:25:54] taking place when God is calling a bride
[1:25:57] and the devil is calling a church
[1:26:01] God is calling a bride and the devil is
[1:26:05] calling a church how is the devil
[1:26:07] calling a church by turning their hearts
[1:26:10] from the truth unto fables but how is
[1:26:13] God calling a bride by the visible
[1:26:16] manifestation of his presence being here
[1:26:19] in the church
[1:26:22] oh can I say it it's something holding
[1:26:24] on to you
[1:26:27] brother Andrew what are you saying he
[1:26:29] said somewhere out in this mess they're
[1:26:32] still honest people that's ordained
[1:26:34] Alive Now The Devil's calling the church
[1:26:36] and God is calling abroad
[1:26:40] now here's the Paradox of the true bride
[1:26:43] is she will stay with her mate who's
[1:26:46] called her
[1:26:48] she will stay with her mate who's called
[1:26:51] her listen this on the wings of a snow
[1:26:53] white dove the dove is always somebody
[1:26:55] say always
[1:26:57] loyal to his mate
[1:27:01] always
[1:27:02] never leaves her and may I stop here
[1:27:05] just a few moments and say this a true
[1:27:07] bride a female dove is loyal to her mate
[1:27:11] too it won't inject any Dogma any
[1:27:14] denominational Doctrine anything of the
[1:27:17] world it'll stay loyal to its mate the
[1:27:19] word see always loyal now listen if you
[1:27:23] go through the Bible you can see and I'm
[1:27:25] just gonna I'm gonna give them to you
[1:27:27] very quick if that's okay the Bible is
[1:27:29] full of paradoxes of people who stay
[1:27:32] loyal to the word
[1:27:34] you know what the Bible says about Noah
[1:27:37] it says it was quite a hard thing for
[1:27:39] Noah and that great intellectual age he
[1:27:41] lived in to try to tell people by word
[1:27:43] of God that it was going to rain now it
[1:27:46] would be no doubt it didn't meet the
[1:27:48] qualification of their scientific
[1:27:50] research he said but Noah by Faith said
[1:27:53] there would be rain because God said
[1:27:55] there would be rain he said now God said
[1:27:57] so or thus saith the Lord it never meets
[1:28:00] the scientific approval of the day the
[1:28:04] saith the Lord or God said so never
[1:28:07] meets the scientific approval of the day
[1:28:10] he said but when the time come for the
[1:28:12] word to be fulfilled it Reigns just the
[1:28:15] same that was Planet Paradox to think
[1:28:17] that rain could come out of the sky
[1:28:19] where there is no rain amen the three
[1:28:21] Hebrew children was a paradox remember
[1:28:23] said there was a genuine Paradox of the
[1:28:26] keeping power of God against any enemy
[1:28:30] when a man is ready to admit that God is
[1:28:32] true when a man is ready to admit God is
[1:28:35] true he will perform a paradox through
[1:28:39] the believer that will admit the
[1:28:40] trueness of the one true Living God Amen
[1:28:43] Daniel was a paradox he was in a den
[1:28:46] full of hungry lines but oh how that
[1:28:49] group of hungry Lions stayed in the cave
[1:28:51] with him all night and Daniel came out
[1:28:53] without any harm
[1:28:57] Samson was a paradox are you hearing me
[1:29:00] Samson was a paradox amen Samson just an
[1:29:04] ordinary man that's all he was brother
[1:29:07] he was an ordinary man he was just a
[1:29:09] little bitty old shrimp little bitty guy
[1:29:11] here he was walking out like a little
[1:29:13] saying and with a Philistine
[1:29:15] garment he said up against him a helmet
[1:29:18] about an inch a half a thick a solid
[1:29:20] brass over his head he said now listen a
[1:29:22] thousand of them was trained and here
[1:29:24] they met the servant of Lord out there a
[1:29:27] little curly-headed shrimp probably a
[1:29:29] little jacket on but the spirit of the
[1:29:32] Lord came upon him and he picked up the
[1:29:34] Jawbone of a mule and beat down a
[1:29:37] thousand for this things he said why
[1:29:39] brother that old that old rotten Jawbone
[1:29:42] of that mule he had hit one of them big
[1:29:43] brass helmets it would have spattered a
[1:29:45] thousand pieces but it was a paradox see
[1:29:48] because God oh God because God was on
[1:29:51] that old Jawbone
[1:29:53] come on church it's incredible but it's
[1:29:56] true Robert said somewhere in history
[1:29:58] that that mule had died in a specific
[1:30:01] place
[1:30:03] are you hearing me that mule had died in
[1:30:07] a specific place for years it had been
[1:30:09] laying there rotten amen going down to
[1:30:12] nothing until it was just a brittle old
[1:30:14] Jawbone you know why because God of
[1:30:16] creation oh God
[1:30:18] God of creation God of Eternity god of
[1:30:22] time God of everything knew that one day
[1:30:25] his little curly-headed shrimp
[1:30:29] his little old servant little boy
[1:30:32] will be walking through there and would
[1:30:34] meet a thousand Philistines and he
[1:30:36] wouldn't eat something to whip them
[1:30:38] Devils with
[1:30:40] so God allowed a Jawbone of a mule to
[1:30:44] lay there
[1:30:45] oh it was brittle it was frail come on
[1:30:48] church but when Samson picked it up he
[1:30:51] began to slay one Philistine he began to
[1:30:54] slay toothless teens come on he slayed a
[1:30:57] thousand for listings with a dead dry
[1:31:00] rotten brittle Jawbone
[1:31:04] I'm gonna go ahead and say it if he can
[1:31:06] get on a dead one
[1:31:09] [Music]
[1:31:11] if he can get on that dead one hell
[1:31:14] glory to God you say preacher what are
[1:31:16] you getting at he can surely get on ours
[1:31:19] that's alive
[1:31:21] you got a job on
[1:31:23] you got a Jawbone you got a Jawbone come
[1:31:27] on you know where that Jawbone is it's
[1:31:29] in your mouth and you know what the
[1:31:30] Bible said amen from the heart of
[1:31:33] righteousness comes the word of faith
[1:31:36] come on Church how do you confess the
[1:31:39] word you confess it with your mouth you
[1:31:42] confess it with your Jawbone
[1:31:45] listen I feel like preaching right now
[1:31:47] amen amen there's a thousand devils in
[1:31:49] this building tonight there's Spirits
[1:31:51] all around you and they're trying to
[1:31:53] torment you they're trying to bind you
[1:31:55] they're trying to destroy you amen but
[1:31:58] for God of paradox is on the scene
[1:32:00] tonight
[1:32:01] and if he can get in a dried Jawbone he
[1:32:05] ought to be able to get into yours
[1:32:08] what are you saying preacher I'm saying
[1:32:10] the days of quiet Services ought to be
[1:32:12] over
[1:32:15] come on y'all know I'm telling the truth
[1:32:18] it's time to Rejoice it's time to
[1:32:21] confess
[1:32:23] it's time to preach with the preacher
[1:32:27] I know I know you get to preach about
[1:32:29] that people say oh my here we go emotion
[1:32:32] I am not promoting emotional fanaticism
[1:32:35] but I am preaching the authority of the
[1:32:39] confession of the believer
[1:32:40] [Applause]
[1:32:43] and you know what sometimes you got to
[1:32:45] do you got to defy every devil in the
[1:32:47] service to confess your promise
[1:32:50] you know what sometimes you got to open
[1:32:52] up your mouth and say I'm Healed
[1:32:55] you gotta open up your mouth and say I'm
[1:32:58] Delivered come on church when Samson
[1:33:00] picked up that Jawbone it was one whack
[1:33:03] two wax three wax you know what they
[1:33:06] heard whack whack whack
[1:33:08] whack whack whack well you know what

[1:34:49] too farther no I think it's time to put
[1:34:50] a whooping on the devil

[1:34:56] enough
[1:35:00] I think he's ripped our families around
[1:35:01] long enough
[1:35:04] I think he's whipped our churches around

[1:35:21] someday this day
[1:35:23] some hour this hour some message this
[1:35:27] message
[1:35:30] oh God
[1:35:32] what are you saying I'm saying the same
[1:35:35] God that God and Joshua and said Son
[1:35:38] stand still
[1:35:40] the same God that God in Joshua and said
[1:35:44] Son stand still is in this building
[1:35:48] come on Church he's in this building but
[1:35:51] he's not in this wood
[1:35:53] he's not in those those seats he's
[1:35:56] not in this carpet he's in your flesh
[1:36:01] come on Church he's in your flesh it's
[1:36:04] your turn to speak
[1:36:07] what are you saying I'm saying the part
[1:36:09] of God said that this today the same God
[1:36:11] Mark 11 22 if you say to this mountain
[1:36:14] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:36:16] but believe what you said will come to
[1:36:18] pass you can have what you said are you
[1:36:21] ready for that that's defy nature
[1:36:24] sure you have the power to defy nature
[1:36:29] but you have to have a motive and an
[1:36:31] objective to do it see motive and
[1:36:34] objective is connected with it now I
[1:36:37] find out in the word if it's supposed to
[1:36:39] be done and then God is calling you to
[1:36:42] do it oh God can I preach to you find
[1:36:46] out in the word if it's supposed to be
[1:36:48] done and then find out if God is calling
[1:36:51] you to do it
[1:36:52] and it'll do it
[1:36:56] direct quote
[1:36:57] find out if it's God's will to be done
[1:37:00] if it is find out if God is calling you
[1:37:03] to do it and if he is it'll be done
[1:37:07] come on Church why did God stop the son
[1:37:09] under the voice of Joshua because it was
[1:37:12] God's will
[1:37:13] why did God Amen allow rain to come out
[1:37:16] of the skies in the face of the critics
[1:37:18] because it was God's will why did God
[1:37:21] allow the three Hebrew boys to walk out
[1:37:23] of the fiery furnace unharmed by the
[1:37:26] fire because it was God's will
[1:37:30] he said now watch can I can I have a few
[1:37:33] more minutes
[1:37:34] when you know it's spoken in the word to
[1:37:36] do it then God has called you to do it
[1:37:38] then it'll happen if your motive and
[1:37:41] objective is right to God he said now
[1:37:43] watch that's why Visions take place
[1:37:45] while things are going the way you have
[1:37:47] to know and God promised at this hour
[1:37:49] now can I say it like this Jesus when he
[1:37:52] was on Earth he was a paradox
[1:37:57] I've come through Noah I've come to the
[1:37:59] Hebrew boys I've come through Daniel
[1:38:01] I've come through Samson I've come to
[1:38:04] Joshua now I've come all the way to our
[1:38:06] lord Jesus when he was on the earth you
[1:38:09] say you got there pretty quick I know I
[1:38:10] got a lot to cover when he was here on
[1:38:12] Earth he walked on water
[1:38:16] that's incredible but it's true
[1:38:19] see scientifically tell me how a man can
[1:38:23] walk on water
[1:38:24] paradox
[1:38:26] it's incredible but it's true see one
[1:38:30] day somebody say one day
[1:38:32] he took five biscuits and two fish and
[1:38:35] fed five thousand now I want to set you
[1:38:38] like this sometimes I think we ought to
[1:38:41] I think we ought to really tell a story
[1:38:44] don't you and we're gonna tell it let's
[1:38:46] tell it the Bible said five thousand men
[1:38:49] and their wives
[1:38:50] so if you've got five thousand men plus
[1:38:52] their wives That's ten thousand
[1:38:55] now we'll say that all ten thousand had
[1:38:58] five kids that's fifty thousand
[1:39:04] well let's make him as big as we can
[1:39:09] he took two fish
[1:39:11] Five Loaves and fed 50 000 people
[1:39:15] y'all don't ever forget that he took two
[1:39:18] fish Five Loaves and the Bible said fed
[1:39:21] five thousand he said now what kind of
[1:39:23] an item did he turn loose
[1:39:26] what kind of Adam did he turn loose he
[1:39:29] said the fist wasn't even alive
[1:39:33] we were not working with living fish a
[1:39:36] boy skipped school went to Jesus meeting
[1:39:38] heard him preached brought his lunch to
[1:39:41] him it was good fish cooked bread
[1:39:46] and the prophet said he lined them up
[1:39:49] and when he broke the bread he broke it
[1:39:52] off a piece of a biscuit now watch this
[1:39:54] when he handed it out he said the time
[1:39:57] he got his hand back there again there
[1:39:59] was cooked fish
[1:40:02] Oak amen amen it's like you got it it's
[1:40:06] like you got a line here and Jesus has
[1:40:08] got this two fish Five Loaves in his
[1:40:10] hand and he says here's your portion and
[1:40:13] when he brings it back there's already
[1:40:15] fish and bread here's your Porsche
[1:40:19] come on church he never put his hand in
[1:40:23] a denominational resource
[1:40:26] come on he never put his hand in the
[1:40:30] Pharisees ideas he called God
[1:40:35] I'm about to explode what he done was he
[1:40:39] just stood there and he preached the
[1:40:41] message
[1:40:46] what are you saying I'm saying we got
[1:40:48] some five-fold preachers
[1:40:49] that are standing in the pulpit and
[1:40:52] Wednesday night they're handing you some
[1:40:53] fishing bread and they're coming back
[1:40:55] Sunday morning and there's more fish and
[1:40:57] bread
[1:40:58] they're coming back Sunday night and
[1:41:00] there's more fish and bread they're
[1:41:02] coming back on Saturday night come on
[1:41:04] sir
[1:41:06] they're not putting their hand out there
[1:41:08] and then pulling it back and it's empty
[1:41:10] so they reaching Dr Dobson to find
[1:41:12] something to say they're feeding you the
[1:41:14] bread of his presence
[1:41:16] laughs
[1:41:17] now can I can I take it another step
[1:41:20] he said in his hand was a piece of fish
[1:41:23] another piece of cooked fish listen that
[1:41:27] element is given to us
[1:41:32] that element is given to us if we'll
[1:41:36] just abide in the word
[1:41:41] oh God I believe we're on the verge of
[1:41:44] sin it happen live through the word
[1:41:46] there you are he had cooked fish that
[1:41:49] was a paradox can I say it to you like
[1:41:52] this whatever element was in his hand
[1:41:55] okay brother Barry whatever element was
[1:41:58] in his hand is in his church
[1:42:01] whatever creative element was in his
[1:42:04] hand
[1:42:06] is in his church come on church it's in
[1:42:10] you
[1:42:11] it's in the bride listen we're not we're
[1:42:14] not a bunch of a bunch of fairy tale
[1:42:16] preachers we're preaching Vindicated
[1:42:17] word and the prophet said the Creator
[1:42:20] the creative element of God
[1:42:24] has returned to the church now
[1:42:26] I said do you like this when we get rid
[1:42:28] of the human element that element goes
[1:42:31] out then the spirit of God fills the
[1:42:33] vacancy he said what are you talking
[1:42:35] about then the love of Christ in the
[1:42:37] human heart moving in the Holy Ghost
[1:42:39] that great wonderful church will go
[1:42:41] forth with power and deity because deity
[1:42:45] will be revealed in human beings
[1:42:49] yet he will be revealed in human beings
[1:42:52] what are you saying I'm saying that's
[1:42:54] the same thing
[1:42:57] that happened when Jesus fed those
[1:42:59] hungry people was deity was being
[1:43:02] revealed in human flesh
[1:43:05] oh God whatever was in his hand is in
[1:43:09] his church
[1:43:10] deity revealed in human beings listen
[1:43:13] church when we lay aside that human
[1:43:15] element we lay aside the human mind he
[1:43:18] said get all the human elements all the
[1:43:20] scientific ideas all the days of
[1:43:22] Miracles has passed all that has to die
[1:43:24] all that has to rot and then from there
[1:43:28] grows The Germ of life into a new life
[1:43:31] now brother Mary if the human young
[1:43:33] woman has to go out then what element
[1:43:35] fills the vacancy the prophet of God
[1:43:38] said amen it's a supernatural element
[1:43:43] now what is your Supernatural can I have
[1:43:45] a few more minutes
[1:43:46] a mystery is a scripture which is a
[1:43:49] previously hidden truth but it's now
[1:43:51] divinely revealed which is a
[1:43:54] supernatural element Still Remains
[1:43:58] despite the Revelation see so when the
[1:44:01] human element goes out then the
[1:44:03] supernatural element comes in
[1:44:05] that's why you're seeing the
[1:44:07] manifestation in the degree that you're
[1:44:10] sitting in in this age because the
[1:44:12] message has removed the human element
[1:44:14] and is filled the vacancy where the
[1:44:18] supernatural element of God come on
[1:44:21] church that's why our meetings are
[1:44:23] becoming more powerful
[1:44:25] are you hearing me that's why our
[1:44:27] services are becoming more powerful
[1:44:30] because the human element's gone out now
[1:44:33] don't get mad at me but for years all
[1:44:36] the people fed on was the human element
[1:44:38] I was with brother Branham uh honey with
[1:44:41] brother Branham brother Branham called
[1:44:42] me friend brother random called me
[1:44:44] because y'all know I'm telling the truth
[1:44:46] and no disrespect but it was the human
[1:44:49] element but when the human element went
[1:44:51] out and the supernatural element of
[1:44:54] Revelation
[1:44:56] begin to pour into the vessel the church
[1:44:59] began to feed on the unfailing body word
[1:45:03] of the son of man and a strength came in
[1:45:06] the church
[1:45:08] an anointing come in the church a power
[1:45:11] come in the church come on church amen
[1:45:13] I'm not that old I'm just 27 years old
[1:45:15] but I've lived long enough to remember
[1:45:16] amen when you go service and all you
[1:45:19] heard was God sent a prophet God sent a
[1:45:21] prophet
[1:45:23] I remember I remember I was a little kid
[1:45:25] amen I heard a guy preach one time
[1:45:26] preached about 30 minutes God sent a
[1:45:28] prophet God sent a prophet I went home
[1:45:30] and I had a little bible I was just a
[1:45:33] little kid and I got over my great
[1:45:34] grandparents and I got to preach them
[1:45:36] God sent a prophet they were methodists
[1:45:37] had no clue what I was talking about
[1:45:40] God said probably and we got fat but
[1:45:42] then we begin to move further into why
[1:45:45] God sent a prophet and the reason he
[1:45:47] sent a prophet was to release the
[1:45:50] supernatural element
[1:45:54] come on church can I say this You're the
[1:45:57] Reason God sent a prophet
[1:45:59] you're the reason that God fulfilled
[1:46:02] Malachi 4. why brother Mervin because he
[1:46:06] wanted to perform another Paradox but he
[1:46:09] could not perform it as long as the
[1:46:11] human elements had the preeminence in
[1:46:13] the church so he sent a prophet with a
[1:46:17] message of the super sign and the super
[1:46:20] sense
[1:46:22] are you hearing me I feel good right now
[1:46:25] of the super sign and the super sense to
[1:46:29] show you that the only way a miracle can
[1:46:32] take place is by the super sign
[1:46:36] and the super sense Isaiah 7 14 the Lord
[1:46:40] himself shall give you what
[1:46:42] a sign but hold a virgin shall conceive
[1:46:45] bear a son and shall call his name
[1:46:48] Emmanuel
[1:46:52] super sign Mark 11 22 Jesus answering
[1:46:57] Seth and them have faith in God
[1:47:00] super sense
[1:47:03] brother said this Sixth Sense belongs
[1:47:06] only to the Christian
[1:47:08] he said the five senses inner outer was
[1:47:11] given the contact to Earthly home he
[1:47:13] said but that Sixth Sense is better
[1:47:15] known to the Christian as Faith are you
[1:47:17] ready for this it's the one that governs
[1:47:20] you and guides you it's Superior to all
[1:47:24] other senses he said and the super sense
[1:47:27] is the holy spirit are you ready for
[1:47:31] this the faith of God that dwells in you
[1:47:36] okay come on Church
[1:47:40] can I preach a minute
[1:47:42] why are some of you all still believing
[1:47:45] this message
[1:47:46] [Applause]
[1:47:47] come on church you've been through stuff
[1:47:49] that should have destroyed you but
[1:47:51] you're still here
[1:47:53] you've been through troubles it should
[1:47:54] erect you but you're still here
[1:47:57] some of y'all have come through false
[1:47:59] doctrines you've come through all kinds
[1:48:01] of things but you're still here do you
[1:48:04] know why you're still here because
[1:48:05] you're a paradox
[1:48:09] in the last days I will pour out my
[1:48:12] spirits saith the Lord come on church
[1:48:14] and you as a prepared ground to receive
[1:48:18] the presence of God the faith of God
[1:48:23] the faith of God is in every believer
[1:48:27] oh my oh if you're left that five
[1:48:31] centuries be yielded to The Sixth Sense
[1:48:33] it'll guide you and will bring all other
[1:48:36] five senses under the control of the
[1:48:40] super sense are you ready for this it
[1:48:42] makes you act where you do not think the
[1:48:45] five senses whatever think about it
[1:48:48] we're the five senses would never let
[1:48:51] you go The Sixth Sense takes you
[1:48:57] with the five senses which say is Off
[1:49:00] Limits The Sixth Sense takes you there
[1:49:03] listen are you ready for this I'll tell
[1:49:05] you what I'm trying to close but I tell
[1:49:08] you why the devil hate you it's cause
[1:49:10] the devil can get in those five sixes
[1:49:12] and lie to you but he cannot
[1:49:18] he cannot
[1:49:22] he cannot touch that super sense it's
[1:49:27] far beyond his reach
[1:49:29] come on Church it come from God
[1:49:32] oh that ought to make you want to shout
[1:49:34] hallelujah
[1:49:37] well we ought to take a minute and say
[1:49:39] praise God
[1:49:41] praise God the devil can get in your
[1:49:44] sight he can get in your hearing he can
[1:49:46] get in your smell he can get in your
[1:49:48] feeling he can get in your reason
[1:49:53] he can get in your imagination but he
[1:49:55] cannot get in your faith
[1:49:58] he cannot get into your faith because
[1:50:01] your faith didn't come from your mama it
[1:50:03] didn't come from your daddy but your
[1:50:05] faith
[1:50:07] Hallelujah your faith come from God
[1:50:11] come on church then that's why the devil
[1:50:14] can't have you because you come from God
[1:50:16] and you've got to go back to God
[1:50:18] [Applause]
[1:50:20] oh you're a paradox you're a paradox
[1:50:23] you're looking for a miracle look in the
[1:50:27] mirror you're a paradox
[1:50:29] the faith of God
[1:50:34] the faith of God is ruling
[1:50:38] raining governing oh I know what I'm
[1:50:42] talking about it's ruling right now
[1:50:45] it's raining right now it's governed
[1:50:48] right now your feelings don't want you
[1:50:51] to have this but your face says sit down
[1:50:55] shut up it's my promise it's my message
[1:50:59] it's my anointing it's my Revival it's
[1:51:03] my hour
[1:51:04] listen listen if you're going to see a
[1:51:07] miracle you're going to separate your
[1:51:09] faith from your feelings
[1:51:11] now I know where I'm at because the
[1:51:14] devil the devil's a liar
[1:51:18] that devil is a liar
[1:51:20] are you ready for this
[1:51:22] and The Sixth Sense come for only one
[1:51:24] reason
[1:51:25] that is to make five senses in you
[1:51:30] didn't deny anything
[1:51:35] deny anything that's contrary to God's
[1:51:39] word
[1:51:43] can I go ahead and read it
[1:51:45] any symptom
[1:51:48] that's contrary to God's promise the
[1:51:52] sixth sense says it's not there
[1:51:59] brother more than the sixth sense says
[1:52:03] it's not fair
[1:52:05] see what happens is the super sense
[1:52:08] comes in connection with the super sign
[1:52:11] are you ready for this and the
[1:52:13] supersonic I'm trying to close the super
[1:52:17] sign is God in man
[1:52:20] manifesting his written word
[1:52:23] then Greater Works in this she can do
[1:52:26] the Greater Works who is she she's the
[1:52:30] bride
[1:52:31] can I say this to you when brother Brown
[1:52:34] speaks sometimes you know I refers to
[1:52:35] you little bride

[1:55:15] as she nears the Capstone the honing
[1:55:18] time she will be fewer in number
[1:55:22] but she will be greater in power
[1:55:25] what are you saying if God got into fish
[1:55:30] and Five Loaves and fed five thousand he
[1:55:34] can get in the water with potentials and
[1:55:36] turn it into wine he can get into every
[1:55:38] believer
[1:55:39] amen
[1:55:42] and perform
[1:55:43] unlimited miracles
[1:55:46] what are you saying preacher I'm saying

[1:55:52] this is adoption time
[1:55:54] we have not received oh God y'alls are
[1:55:57] pulling church we have not received the
[1:56:00] spirit of bondage again to fear

[1:58:05] what are you saying I'm saying he's here
[1:58:07] performing Miracles can I tell you a few
[1:58:09] inclusion the other day out in
[1:58:11] Pennsylvania I was preaching that
[1:58:12] brother Jim shoemak's church just
[1:58:14] standing there preaching the word just
[1:58:16] preaching not laying hands on nobody
[1:58:18] hadn't even opened the alternate and
[1:58:20] while I'm preaching brother Mary I read
[1:58:22] across a quote when I looked at it I
[1:58:24] just kept on going I was going through
[1:58:25] some some through some discernments real
[1:58:27] quick and when I skipped over it
[1:58:28] something spoke to me said go back
[1:58:32] read it so I walked back over I said
[1:58:34] y'all forgive me I found that quote and
[1:58:37] I read it you know what it was it was a
[1:58:39] prophet calling out a sinus trouble
[1:58:41] when I read that quote there was no
[1:58:44] emotion there was no screaming I read it
[1:58:46] kept on preaching we got to brother Jim
[1:58:49] shoemake's house after service we're
[1:58:51] sitting around the table and his son
[1:58:52] Jimmy sitting there and all of a sudden
[1:58:54] brother his son Jimmy goes and just
[1:58:57] breathes in and he goes oh my Lord dad
[1:58:59] he goes I'm Healed
[1:59:02] he said I'm Healed brother Jim said
[1:59:04] really son he said yeah he said dad you
[1:59:07] know I've had this problem in my sinuses
[1:59:09] and hadn't been able to breathe out the
[1:59:11] left side of my nose in years he said
[1:59:13] but brother Andrew when you read that
[1:59:15] quote he said I didn't feel nothing
[1:59:18] he said all I did was say that's the
[1:59:20] truth
[1:59:23] the god of paradox performed a paradox
[1:59:27] you know why because we're not preaching
[1:59:30] doctrinal we're not preaching Dogma
[1:59:32] we're not preaching Creed we're
[1:59:34] preaching created word
[1:59:38] just last year out in Cloverdale I was
[1:59:40] there ministering I was preaching I pray
[1:59:42] it's okay to testify for a minute and
[1:59:44] I'm done I was out preaching in
[1:59:46] Cloverdale preaching there on a
[1:59:47] Wednesday night before the Winter Camp
[1:59:48] while I was preaching I was preached on
[1:59:50] the third pull creation power and I said
[1:59:53] now when brother man spoke those cross
[1:59:54] into existence he the spirit didn't come
[1:59:57] down and find some squirrel guts and
[1:59:59] squirrel DNA and squirrel bones and dry
[2:00:01] squirrel blood and say abracadabra
[2:00:04] abracadoo by the spirit I make a
[2:00:06] squirrel out of you
[2:00:08] no there was nothing there
[2:00:10] but created word
[2:00:13] created squirrels and a prophet killed
[2:00:16] him when I said that I didn't know but
[2:00:18] brother Murphy Wong's daughter sister
[2:00:20] Grace she was sitting there and her and
[2:00:22] her husband was Desiring a baby they
[2:00:24] were Desiring a little child I didn't
[2:00:26] know her condition the next year I go
[2:00:29] back to those meetings brother Murphy
[2:00:31] says you got to hear Grace's testimony
[2:00:32] sister Grace and her husband come over
[2:00:34] there she said with Andrew when you were
[2:00:36] preaching last year she said you read
[2:00:38] that quote and you said there was
[2:00:39] nothing there for God to work with but
[2:00:42] he created anyhow
[2:00:45] he said here's my testimony she said I
[2:00:47] went to the doctor and the doctor said
[2:00:49] if I was ever going to have a child she
[2:00:51] said I would have to have a surgery they
[2:00:54] meant to fix something in my body she
[2:00:56] said because there was nothing there
[2:01:00] was nothing there to create a child with
[2:01:04] are you hearing me listen to me there
[2:01:07] was nothing there to create a child with
[2:01:09] she said but when you said that she said
[2:01:12] something in my heart said I believe it
[2:01:15] she said I had been through a prayer
[2:01:17] line she said brother Ron had a vision
[2:01:19] brother Ron Spencer said she'll have a
[2:01:21] child she said I had settled to believe
[2:01:23] that by the vision and the surgery I
[2:01:26] would have the child she said but when I
[2:01:28] received that word that night she said
[2:01:30] the next morning I got up she said and I
[2:01:32] took a pregnancy test she said I come to
[2:01:35] Camp last year with a positive pregnancy
[2:01:37] test
[2:01:42] she said and here is the child
[2:01:46] are you hearing me church but God of
[2:01:49] paradox is back in the flesh of the
[2:01:53] Bride of Jesus Christ you're a creative
[2:01:55] bride with a creative word
[2:01:59] what are you say it I'm saying this is
[2:02:01] God's word
[2:02:02] these are God's Miracles oh my can I
[2:02:05] tell one more I feel the devil getting
[2:02:07] scared we might as well running back to
[2:02:09] Hillary come from
[2:02:11] my God still in the healing business
[2:02:13] it's not a man doing it it's the super
[2:02:16] sense by the super sign out brother out
[2:02:20] in the Church of the day my wife Mariah
[2:02:22] I thank God for a holy ghost-filled life
[2:02:24] our little baby just a few months old
[2:02:27] she was changing his diaper one day and
[2:02:29] noticed his in his belly button a little
[2:02:31] a little hernia pick him the doctor the
[2:02:33] doctor said ma'am said that's a some
[2:02:35] some type of hernia said if it's not
[2:02:37] gone by the time he's four years old
[2:02:39] she'll have to have surgery and it will
[2:02:41] have to correct it amen but my wife in a
[2:02:43] meeting one day I was preaching when I
[2:02:45] got done preaching she brought malachite
[2:02:47] for prayer she said I want to pray this
[2:02:49] hernia will be gone
[2:02:51] laid our hands on him in just a few days
[2:02:54] a hernia sticking that far out was
[2:02:57] totally gone
[2:03:00] [Music]
[2:03:03] as if it was never even there
[2:03:07] what are you saying I'm saying the
[2:03:09] creative word
[2:03:12] has fallen into creative ground
[2:03:17] the super sense is nourishing it
[2:03:21] let our musicians come
[2:03:24] [Music]
[2:03:27] this
[2:03:29] [Applause]
[2:03:37] this
[2:03:39] is the bride's paradox
[2:03:44] do you realize we're living
[2:03:46] in the season
[2:03:48] of creation power
[2:03:50] by the spoken word
[2:03:53] it's actually happening
[2:03:57] it's not currently devised Fables
[2:04:00] it's not Skeptics
[2:04:02] it's a prophet
[2:04:04] the Holy Spirit
[2:04:07] you know just the other day we was out
[2:04:08] in North Carolina
[2:04:10] and I I share this I pray it's okay we

[2:04:24] so it was Wednesday morning I was
[2:04:25] actually speaking that night

[2:04:28] paradox
[2:04:30] and I'm sitting there in the morning

[2:04:58] I was feeling good he said I just got
[2:05:00] home from the Amazon
[2:05:01] he said I went come here and preach went
[2:05:03] home he said a day after I got home I

[2:05:08] of details for the sake of time brother
[2:05:10] Mary said I went to the doctor
[2:05:12] he said when I went to the doctor they
[2:05:13] said sir there's something wrong with
[2:05:15] you we don't know what it is we don't
[2:05:16] know where you've contacted he said well
[2:05:18] I just came out of Amazon they put him
[2:05:19] in an isolation room not even his family
[2:05:22] Carly going there shut him in an
[2:05:24] isolation room and they began to run
[2:05:26] scans when they begin to run these scans
[2:05:29] on one of the scans his lungs was
[2:05:32] literally leaving his body I've got the
[2:05:34] pictures if you want to see me send them
[2:05:36] to me they were literally leaving his
[2:05:38] body like from the from I mean you can
[2:05:39] see they're gone well it was something
[2:05:41] he had contacted was destroying his
[2:05:44] lungs and he was basically laying there
[2:05:46] dying
[2:05:47] and he said while I was laying there he
[2:05:49] said I just began to praise and my wife
[2:05:51] was praying my babies was praying he
[2:05:53] said I'll begin to pray and he said Lord
[2:05:54] he said I need lungs to preach
[2:05:58] he said I need lungs to preach your word
[2:06:01] and he said I breathed in
[2:06:03] and he said all of a sudden something
[2:06:05] changed in my body
[2:06:07] he said the next day they did an x-ray
[2:06:09] to see how far up that disease and eat
[2:06:11] more of my lungs he said and they come
[2:06:13] in there totally shocked
[2:06:17] they said we don't know what happened
[2:06:18] but you got a brand new set of lungs
[2:06:21] [Applause]
[2:06:27] there's a bread
[2:06:30] he said
[2:06:31] [Applause]
[2:06:33] he said I didn't have a lung transplant
[2:06:36] he said the only thing I know was the
[2:06:38] creator come by
[2:06:42] and created me a brand new set of lungs
[2:06:46] now brother Barry I was sitting about
[2:06:47] where you're sitting and when brother
[2:06:49] when brother Nikki said that something
[2:06:51] spoke in my heart and said this is a
[2:06:54] creative meeting
[2:06:56] this is a creative meeting
[2:06:58] I just wrote it down on my notepad
[2:07:00] and right behind that the voice of the
[2:07:02] Lord spoke to my heart and I just spoke
[2:07:04] it out in the service
[2:07:06] cancer is trespassing on Creative lungs
[2:07:11] when I said that I literally wrote it
[2:07:13] down and then I went back brother and I
[2:07:15] underlined and highlighted and circled
[2:07:17] the word on because on the way to preach
[2:07:20] that meeting was brother Ron Spencer
[2:07:22] who's fighting stage four lung cancer
[2:07:24] stage four lung cancer fighting it and
[2:07:28] in that meeting in 2009 after the fire
[2:07:30] he received a brand new set of lungs
[2:07:33] in that same meaning received a brand
[2:07:36] new set of lungs and it just spoke out
[2:07:38] of me cancer is trespassing on Creative
[2:07:41] lungs
[2:07:43] so that not in the back room I left your
[2:07:45] brother on I said brother Ron I'm going
[2:07:46] to share your testimony from when
[2:07:47] brother bisco was preaching and your
[2:07:49] lungs were created brand new he said go
[2:07:51] right ahead he said can I give you
[2:07:53] something you may want to use too I said
[2:07:55] sure he said the other day they'd done
[2:07:57] scans he said when they've done those
[2:07:58] scans he said they ran the scans and
[2:08:01] come back and said the tumors the cancer
[2:08:04] the cancerous tumors he said your lungs
[2:08:07] are too powerful
[2:08:08] [Music]
[2:08:10] your lungs the doctor said your lungs
[2:08:13] are too powerful for the cancer to get
[2:08:15] in them
[2:08:17] the tumors are hanging on them
[2:08:20] I said brother Ron run that by me again
[2:08:22] he said that cancer can't get in my
[2:08:25] lungs
[2:08:28] it's just hanging on my lunch
[2:08:31] I said old devil isn't that just like
[2:08:33] the devil whenever God does something he
[2:08:36] can't get in it so he attaches himself
[2:08:38] to it
[2:08:39] but I want to tell you tonight if God's
[2:08:41] done something for you the devil has no
[2:08:43] right
[2:08:45] the devil has no right he has no right
[2:08:48] on your family he has no right on your
[2:08:50] ministry he has no right on this church
[2:08:52] Satan is a trespasser and we endure him
[2:08:56] in the name of Jesus Christ and we
[2:08:59] believe the presence of Jesus Christ is
[2:09:01] in this building to perform the
[2:09:03] miraculous once you stand your feet with
[2:09:06] me tonight
[2:09:09] he's here
[2:09:12] [Music]
[2:09:17] he's here in this building tonight
[2:09:21] why did you tell those testimonies
[2:09:32] because the devil's defeated
[2:09:36] Satan
[2:09:39] Satan
[2:09:41] is defeated
[2:09:43] [Music]
[2:09:45] he's defeated
[2:09:47] and I stand here tonight under a
[2:09:49] commission of almighty God to say what a
[2:09:51] prophet said and you know what a prophet
[2:09:54] said
[2:09:55] God is here
[2:09:57] to put Satan out
[2:10:02] God is here
[2:10:04] to put Satan out
[2:10:07] now listen I believe he's here in this
[2:10:09] building tonight
[2:10:12] I believe the god of paradox
[2:10:15] is right here
[2:10:17] [Music]
[2:10:18] he's here to put Satan out
[2:10:22] what's your bow your hearts with us
[2:10:23] tonight
[2:10:26] here
[2:10:28] I declare unto you that he is here
[2:10:31] [Music]
[2:10:33] and I tonight by God's help and God's
[2:10:36] word
[2:10:36] according to his word
[2:10:40] have brought the god of paradox
[2:10:43] right here
[2:10:44] before you tonight
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:10:47] he's here
[2:10:51] he's here to heal
[2:10:53] he's here to save
[2:10:56] he's here to deliver
[2:10:58] he's here to do exactly
[2:11:01] what his word
[2:11:02] he said he would do
[2:11:04] [Music]
[2:11:06] now listen
[2:11:07] Satan is a defeated being
[2:11:10] and a prophet said he knows it
[2:11:14] now think about that tonight as you
[2:11:16] bow your hearts before the Lord
[2:11:19] Satan
[2:11:21] is a defeated being
[2:11:23] and he knows it
[2:11:26] he knows he's defeated
[2:11:29] and he still showed up in this meeting
[2:11:31] tonight to try to defeat you
[2:11:34] he tells you you're not going to make it
[2:11:37] he tells you this message is not for you
[2:11:40] he tells you you're too sick you're too
[2:11:42] bound you're too you're too you're too
[2:11:44] far gone
[2:11:46] that's a defeated being telling you that
[2:11:50] but what if I tell you what the word
[2:11:52] said
[2:11:54] greater is he that's in you
[2:11:59] then he
[2:12:01] it is against you
[2:12:04] listen I believe tonight the god of
[2:12:06] paradox is in the building
[2:12:09] as we pray tonight this altar is open
[2:12:12] brother Bram said it like this he said
[2:12:14] why do we preach the power of paradox
[2:12:17] why do we preach the power
[2:12:19] of Deliverance in the Holy Ghost
[2:12:22] and deny the people the opportunity to
[2:12:26] experience it
[2:12:28] I believe you can experience a paradox
[2:12:30] tonight because it's your paradox
[2:12:34] almighty God
[2:12:36] we bow our hearts
[2:12:39] we humble ourselves in your presence
[2:12:41] tonight Lord
[2:12:43] father I heard your Prophet say one time
[2:12:46] he said I bring these people
[2:12:49] into your presence Lord
[2:12:51] by the means of Prayer
[2:12:54] father
[2:12:55] this is the little bride
[2:12:58] this is the elect lady
[2:13:01] this is the bride that you have called
[2:13:03] out
[2:13:05] by identifying your presence
[2:13:08] in her midst
[2:13:10] Lord
[2:13:12] this is the bride that has turned from
[2:13:14] fables to truth
[2:13:16] she's turned from Creeds and dogmas and
[2:13:20] false doctrines
[2:13:22] to truth
[2:13:24] to reality
[2:13:26] father your Prophet said it's so
[2:13:28] beautiful he said then lay your soul
[2:13:30] upon the altar
[2:13:32] and let the god of paradox
[2:13:34] make a paradox out of you
[2:13:36] Lord we invite you in this building
[2:13:38] tonight
[2:13:41] we invite you in this building Lord
[2:13:43] you see the needs of your children
[2:13:46] father you see the situations
[2:13:49] but I bound the spirit of the enemy in
[2:13:51] the name of Jesus
[2:13:53] Satan I a journey in the name of Jesus
[2:13:56] Christ
[2:13:57] come away from God's believing
[2:14:00] believing May the power and the liberty
[2:14:02] and the anointing the presence of God
[2:14:05] may they become completely anointed
[2:14:08] with the spirit of God
[2:14:11] Lord May their strength increase
[2:14:15] and increase
[2:14:16] an increase
[2:14:18] so Lord they step out of that situation
[2:14:21] they rise up out of that condition
[2:14:24] and they begin to walk
[2:14:26] they begin to walk as a paradox

[2:27:58] I believe we've heard from Heaven
[2:28:00] tonight
[2:28:03] these were not the words of a man this
[2:28:06] was not the words of Andrew Glover
[2:28:09] this was the word of God
[2:28:12] to remind us about Who We Are
[2:28:15] and where we stand
[2:28:18] and if Satan is here he's trespassing
[2:28:20] it's that simple
[2:28:21] he's got no right over our church
[2:28:24] no right over our families
[2:28:27] no right over our children
[2:28:29] no right over our relationships he's a
[2:28:33] defeated trespassing being
[2:28:36] [Music]
[2:28:37] and we know our position
[2:28:41] I don't think he's here right now though
[2:28:44] I think we put the run on him
[2:28:47] we have a testimony tonight that uh I
[2:28:51] believe sister Faith wants to share
[2:28:53] if it's okay
[2:28:56] I could give you the mic brother
[2:28:58] [Music]
[2:29:06] I believe the Lord's done something here
[2:29:08] tonight
[2:29:09] if he's done something for you say Amen
[2:29:12] [Music]
[2:29:14] [Applause]
[2:29:22] God bless you God bless you Church
[2:29:25] just in case anyone has any doubts that
[2:29:28] God is really here God is here
[2:29:31] amen I came to church today with a very
[2:29:34] heavy heart just trusting of many things
[2:29:37] and I was on my City airplane without I
[2:29:39] don't felt let's go to the front to go
[2:29:40] and pray and I prayed and I said Lord
[2:29:42] I want to hear my name today just just
[2:29:45] speak to me just just tell me something
[2:29:47] that will show me that it's really
[2:29:49] really you are with me
[2:29:51] and when the brother came remember
[2:29:53] Andrew came to preach the very first
[2:29:56] Bible verse you read was John 14. I've
[2:30:00] been studying The Book of John and
[2:30:02] today I was read John 14 but I missed it
[2:30:06] it's Wednesday said John for like wow
[2:30:08] John 14 I said Okay God is that to you
[2:30:12] and the next thing he read was Hebrews
[2:30:15] 11. I didn't even hear another thing I
[2:30:17] only heard now faith that was what I had
[2:30:20] now Faith and I said Lord this can only
[2:30:23] be used calling me out directly amen and
[2:30:27] as as he was preaching I was on my chair
[2:30:29] here you know I don't felt something
[2:30:32] cold like I said all the burnings in my
[2:30:34] heart just just lifted away and I
[2:30:38] personally thank God because I know that
[2:30:40] all I asked him for I know he's going to
[2:30:43] Grant every one of them
[2:30:46] hey man
[2:30:48] glory to God
[2:30:49] [Applause]
[2:31:01] we got service tomorrow morning
[2:31:03] I know it's just about 8 30 and some
[2:31:06] people might be getting nervous but
[2:31:09] remember that's not the spirit of God
[2:31:11] I just feel like singing
[2:31:14] Because greater is he that is in you and
[2:31:17] me than he that is in this world
[2:31:20] [Music]
[2:31:21] why don't we sing that song
[2:31:24] maybe sing a couple songs and then we'll
[2:31:26] dismiss and just think about these words
[2:31:29] that we heard tonight he's here brothers
[2:31:31] and sisters the prophet didn't come to
[2:31:33] say he's coming he came to declare he is
[2:31:37] here and if he's here then we should see
[2:31:40] him as he is
[2:31:42] we'll start with that first verse
[2:31:46] Satan's like a roaring light
[2:31:51] roaming to and from
[2:31:55] seeking whom he may devour the Bible
