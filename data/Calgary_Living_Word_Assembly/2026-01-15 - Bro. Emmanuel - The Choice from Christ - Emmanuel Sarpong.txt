Amen. God bless each one of you. Welcome once again in the house of the Lord this evening. Welcome you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus. Easy altogether lovely one as [clears throat] we sing this [music] song tonight. I lift your name, your holy name. &gt;&gt; Oh [singing] Lord, my heart can grow so far away and cold.

We're just going to sing all the verses through and then the chorus at the end. Just a little bit of time saving tonight. I didn't want to skip a one. They're all so good. So, all the verses and then the chorus. Standing on the promises. [music] Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] [singing] Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] Heat. [music] [music] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [music] [music] Heat. [music] [singing] Heat. [music] [music] Heat. Heat. [music and singing] [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [singing] [music] Heat. [music] [music] Heat. [music] Oh yeah. [music] Heat. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; standing on the proes of God. [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; I love those choruses. The one about standing on the word and I shall prevail only one way. I'm standing on his word. Blessed be his name. As brother Dawn comes, we'll sing this chorus. He's got a special for us tonight. In Jesus [music] [singing] name we press on. [music] Oh, in [singing and music] Jesus name we press. [music] [singing] Here Lord will [music] [singing] us [music] [singing] to [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless you all. Glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. For a month, I tried to put this into words and failed miserably about seven times. But Monday morning, I woke up and I just wrote it all out in one go. I want to share this with you. It's called the joy of the Lord. Oh, the joy of the Lord. It's hard to explain. It's not built by logic, nor learned through pain. It lives in expression, in breath, and in song. A knowing that tells you where you belong. It rises in places you'd never expect. In weakness and trial, in moments unchecked, it sings through the chains, though the night feels long. The quiet, defiant, heavenborns song. It endures what would break a heart left alone because it is rooted where Christ is enthroned. Not shallow or fleeting, not fading with time, but steady and sure, a strength so divine. It is rest for the soul that is finally seen that Christ dwells within. Peaceful and serene, not a distant companion, not passing through, &gt;&gt; but life in your life forever made new. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It takes gentle steps when you want to hide. When fear crowds your thoughts and hope feels [music] denied, still joy keeps you moving, not rushed, not forced, led softly along by your comfort and source. It passes all knowledge, all measure and scale. A peace that remains when explanations fail. It steadies your footing, lifts weary views, motivates, moves you, and keeps you true. &gt;&gt; It is revelation lived out each day, not shaped by conditions that come or that sway in every situation, both humble and pressed. It calls forth the heart, and requests its best. So here is my offering, simple and true, not fully explaining. We can't explain the joy in our hearts but pointing to him you in our hearts. For the joy of the Lord cannot just be deployed. It must be lived, breathed, [snorts] and most importantly quietly enjoyed. Lord bless you all. [applause] Yes, looks like we are on the same page. Brother Don, Joy Unspeakable was the first uh song just today. So, we just thank the Lord for the joy of the Lord. It truly is our strength. Thank you, brother Don. Love the gift and you're you, my brother, and just uh a wonderful wonderful blessing to the assembly. God bless you. Stand with me if you would. Thou art [music] worthy. Thou art worthy. Just give your give your husband tonight a little praise, little little joy in the quiet moments as brother Don's poem said [music] that those quiet times where you just tell the Lord how amazing he is. Oh, thou art worthy. Oh, thou [singing] [music] art worthy. are worthy [music] to [music] receive glory. [singing] [music] [singing] Heat. [music] Heat. [music] [music] Yeah. [singing] Heat. [music] [music and singing] My pleasure. [music] [singing] For thy [music] mother comes. Oh, touching Jesus is all [singing and music] that really matters. Isn't that the truth tonight? Oh, [singing] and your it will never be [music and singing] [music] [singing] just [music] when you touching [singing and music] Thank you Jesus. [music] [singing] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we sing my faithfulness for today? My faith looks up [singing and music] to thee now of calary [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Why I pray [music] all [singing] my way [singing] [music] from this Let me [singing and music] thart [music] [music] [singing] strength to my face. [singing] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [singing] [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] [singing] [music] Heat. Heat. [music and singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; My life [singing] I [music] [music and singing] is great. My [music and singing] God [music and singing] today [music and singing] [music] from &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts before him. Our merciful father, our gracious Lord Jesus Christ, there is none like you. Father, you are worthy of all our praise. You are worthy of all the honor that we can give and more. You are worthy of all our adoration. Father, what would be of us without you? And that is why we always we always approach you in humility, Father. That we will always come before you, oh Lord, with a heart of gratitude, Father, knowing that you are worthy more than we can ever give. And we always come, Father, to offer our lives, Father. It's even a privilege, Father, to find ourselves in your will, Father, fulfilling your purpose, Father. And that is why we gather this evening, Father, because we know the time is getting closer, Father. And without you, we are nothing. Father, we've come this Friday because of you. And Father, we are counting on you. Father, we pray that you lead us safely home. Father, have your way this evening even as we gather. Oh God, [music] inspire your word to the hearts of every soul present, including the speaker. Lord, Father, have your way, Father. Be pleased with this worship. Be pleased with the service, oh Lord. And whoever is tuning in, Father, speak to hearts, oh Lord. And Father, let your will prevail in all that we do. You're worthy of praise. You're worthy of honor. You're worthy of adoration. We commit the remainder of the service into your hands. Bless the musicians. Bless every soul present, oh Lord. And may we never go back the same way we came. &gt;&gt; We love you. We appreciate you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you to the musicians. Um I suppose we'll just read the word quickly so we can sit down. Um [snorts] I'm reading from Joshua 24. I think this has come up quite a few times in recent times. Such a privilege to be gathered this evening. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In his presence. And I know it's a bit unexpected, right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; but nothing surprises God. &gt;&gt; From the foundation of the earth, he knew what who will be here. &gt;&gt; And he he knew exactly what will be needed. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So my prayer is that this unexpected situation does not influence your expectation. Praise the Lord. I'm reading from Joshua 24:14. 15. Yes. I'll start from 14. Yeah. My my All right. Joshua 24:14. Now therefore, fear the Lord &gt;&gt; and serve him in sincerity and in truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt, and serve ye the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if it seems evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods which your fathers serve that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house will serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord have his blessings to the reader of the word. You may be seated. And so, um, we are already in the second week of the year. I'm not sure if it's still appropriate to say happy new year, &gt;&gt; but um it's just that at this time, well, the end of the year is a time where a lot of people get time off work, a lot of people get to spend time with family, get to connect with loved ones, and reflect on their performance in the past year and make decisions and make resolutions. ions just decide on how they can improve on what is passed. And so um when I asked I thought I should say something about uh uh decisions and resolutions specifically the choice or the decision to follow Jesus Christ. And so I want to title it, as you can see, the choice for Christ. The choice for Christ. So hopefully this I I I'm hoping that it'll not take too long. And so um the choice for Christ, yes, is that many times when we decide to follow the Lord Jesus Christ or in the course of our life for the Lord Jesus Christ, we always have a point or a place where we go back to. We always have a time uh an event or a particular instant where we know that this is where we give our life to the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this may be something that maybe it's been a year, it's been 10 years, 20 years, we always go back to that. And that is fine to have such an anchor in life. But what is happening is that we often fail to see that to deciding to live for the Lord Jesus Christ is a continuous decision. that descending deciding to live for the Lord Jesus Christ is a commitment that we make every day and that when you say I am living for Christ it means that for every time you have to make a decision you are choosing the Lord's way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are choosing the sight of the Lord. And so when we get to that place, when we get to that understanding, when we know that over and over again every day, we will choose the Lord again, &gt;&gt; now we are in a relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we are looking for the will of our partner. &gt;&gt; Now we are looking for the desires of our partner. And what happens is as we do that because a lot of times the desires and the wills are not automatically the same in an instant. But as we suppress our will, as we suppress our desires, as we do the will of the one we have invited, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; then the decisions become his. Now don't get me wrong, he will never take your decision away from you. because he he never takes your will away. But when you suppress your will and you suppress your will and you suppress your will and you are always doing what he wants, what happens is that you are killing the old man. &gt;&gt; You are killing you. &gt;&gt; And as you kill you, he leaves. &gt;&gt; So the less of you, the more of him. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. It's like when you see um like any young lady they are born they grow up they have a place they call home where mom and dad is but a point comes where something happens and suddenly they've moved from home and they living in another person's home and suddenly even they all home when they go there they are received as if they are visitors. What has happened? They are married. The points of reference has shifted. everything has changed. Praise the name of the Lord. And so this is some of the things that um I'm I'm beginning to look at that the decisions that we take for the Lord is not a one day decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The decisions that we take for the Lord is not an instant decision and that is it. No, it's a continuous thing. And it is even not necessarily our decision because when he comes in, he comes in to rule. When he comes in, he comes in to reign in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Let's understand it this way that if he's not ruling, he's not there. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord doesn't come and wait and see, oh, maybe you, but no, &gt;&gt; if he's not ruling, he's not there at all. &gt;&gt; And like the scripture says, he who has not the spirit of the Lord is not his. &gt;&gt; And so, these are things that we have to consider. And maybe some of these things may sound a little firm, but understand it. um that is what is on my heart and so that is how uh I think I'll the only option for me &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now recently I had to talk to the young people and my choice was the rich the rich young ruler and so I I just want to read uh Mark 10 and maybe start from there Um there won't be too many reading today but um &gt;&gt; Mark 10:17. Now, in talking about the rich young ruler, I realized that we we covered quite a bit um then and we sort of hinted at some of the other things, but there was just one aspect that I wanted us to read and then um sort of go along that way. So, I'm reading Mark 10. I'm reading from verse 17. And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running and kneel to him and asked him, "Good master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?" And Jesus said unto him, "Why callst thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God. Thou knowest the commandments. Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Defraud not. Honor thy father and mother. And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth. Then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him, One thing thou lackest. Go thy way, sell whatsoever thou has and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, take up the cross, and follow me." And he was sad at the saying, and went away grieved, for he had great possessions. I think I'll stop here. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. And so, decision- making is very important. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now what we don't see here but if you follow the message you know is that with just this one decision this man has changed his eternal destination. One decision his eternal his eternal destination is changed and we all have decisions to make. And what I'm saying here is it's not the decision to say I accept you Lord as my personal savior. No, this man has done that already. In fact, he has done that from his youth. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; My my &gt;&gt; and he has been good at it. &gt;&gt; But here we are. We find ourselves in a special situation. And so I'll read one quote from brother Abraham and sort of um go with it because it says that every two seconds we make a decision. Oh great. Every two second we make a decision. And so they say in a to in a in a day we make about 35,000 decisions and then they say more than 90 95% is automatic but the other ones are what we are talking about now at Kadesh Barnea uh 1956. Now Kadesh for the younger ones is where uh the people of Israel in their journey to Egypt. Kadesh was practically the last point because before they cross to the promised land. So Kadesh is the other side of Jordan just before they cross over and a lot of things happened there. That's where they sent for the spies and many other things. So when you cross to the other side you at Gilgal and when you are here you at at Kadesh. And so anyway, you've got a decision to make. Abraham says, "You are at Kadesh. You see, can't stand much longer. Why you halting between two opinions? Why isn't the church on fire? Why isn't the place packed &gt;&gt; out with people? Why isn't great signs and wonders done? Don't lay it onto the pastor. It's you." &gt;&gt; We got mixed attitude. one pulling one way and one the other. You've got to come to a time of decision. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we all know that this rich young ruler, he lived a blessed life. &gt;&gt; And that's because he chose to live his life for Christ. [snorts] And he chose to do that from his youth. And so when you see that he's young, he's in authority and he's rich, that is the blessing of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because you never take a decide in your heart to live a righteous life for the Lord and it will be in vain. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It never happens. &gt;&gt; No. If that life is righteous, the Lord vindicates it. &gt;&gt; He's the Lord who watches over his word to perform it. And the way he watches over his word is not in this Bible. No, he's looking at men. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And whenever he sees his word, he confirms that that is his word. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And so this man lived a blessed life. He was a righteous man. But you see, when you make a choice for Christ, what is happening is that you are choosing all the blessings that comes with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you make a choice for Christ, you are choosing life &gt;&gt; because he's the author of life. &gt;&gt; A choice for Christ, you are choosing peace because he's the prince of peace. &gt;&gt; It may not be not be as the world sees peace. But before God, you have chosen peace. You have chosen victory because he has gone ahead already. This journey is already known before God. &gt;&gt; He's gone ahead already. He's won the victory. He's handed it back to us and we're walking through it. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So a choice for the Lord is so many more. Now what is in is important is what I've told is that understanding that the choice for Christ is not a singular choice and it's not something that you make at one time and then you are done. No, the real decision for Christ is a decision to live for him every day of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And even within the day as well. &gt;&gt; And so when you wake up, you wake up, you are alive. Glory to God. You praise him. You are beginning the day, Lord, guide me and help me. &gt;&gt; You are going to work Lord use me for your purpose. Yes. &gt;&gt; You come home. Glory to God. Family is home. &gt;&gt; You're going to church. Anticipate &gt;&gt; that you are going to the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go under expectation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You see, this is something that a lot of times I think of that we can go to the mayor's office or his house and we're not going to letter there. &gt;&gt; We're not going to draw pieces of paper there. We can go to Trudeau's house and well the other person and we're not going to put leave things there. When we come with that attitude of reverence, honoring the sanctity of the sanctuary, it means that we understand who we are coming to meet with &gt;&gt; and that expectation gives us the benefit of what we came for. &gt;&gt; Because when we don't have that attitude, we miss a lot. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The thing is still coming, but it passes over our head. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I'm saying that, I'm thinking of a lot of brethren that I see here pitching in, helping their wives. And I give God glory for all of you because that was me not long ago. And it seemed like that was all I will do and it will never end. &gt;&gt; But you see, important things happen through that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Understand that. If you're a man, you're responsible for everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you should do everything, but you're responsible for everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not everything is your fault, but you're still responsible. &gt;&gt; And so pitching in is that it's the best way you can pass on knowledge to your children. &gt;&gt; They look at it, they see it, and they learn from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They understand what happens when mom and dad are doing this. It comes to my benefit. and they learn to also benefit from this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been here and I've seen a person and I hope I'm not talking about any individual here present. So it's many years ago talking with pride. Oh yeah. If if I come to church, it's it's your it's your duty. You the lady, it's your duty. Me I'm coming to do my duty is the word of God. And I'm thinking who is the head of that family, &gt;&gt; right? So you the head wants to still come and feed and she should just keep on laboring. That's it. And so anyway, I don't know where how I I went that way, but this is key that in life, everything we do, we make it a point to choose Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you have to understand that people throughout history who have done well have chosen Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And [laughter] and that's before Christ ever came on earth. &gt;&gt; Because from the Garden of Eden till now, Christ has always been in every age. &gt;&gt; The word for your day revealed is Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. &gt;&gt; And so go through scriptures. Everybody who has done well that we read about has chosen Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's been their life. &gt;&gt; It's not a decision they made and they okay they are part of a group. No, &gt;&gt; that is not it. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And so this man lived right. Brother Abraham tells us that he grew up in a good house. The parents taught him right. But the outstanding thing about him and I believe that uh it's the reality of most people was that [snorts] in spite of all what he had believed he knew that he lacked something. &gt;&gt; He knew that he did not have eternal life. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. And then two things are in his favor. One is he understood that he had a luck and the second thing is he knew the source to go to. And that is very important. &gt;&gt; Now consider the environment in which he was so that you will understand what I'm talking about. That this man could have chosen a rabbi somewhere &gt;&gt; and there were many of those in those days. &gt;&gt; He could have gone to the temple. He could have gone to a synagogue. He could have gone to the the high priest. But he chose to go to the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. And so he knew the source to go. And so two things were very important and they were in his favor. &gt;&gt; Now look at his approach. He came, he knelt down. &gt;&gt; He had the right approach. &gt;&gt; He went to the right source. &gt;&gt; He lived a right life. But all of that did not benefit him because he lacked the right intent. And that right intent is the choice for Christ. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he comes, he speaks to the Lord Jesus Christ and Jesus tells him [sighs] go and obey all the laws. And then he says, I have obeyed from my childhood. Isn't that beautiful? This man had a lot going for him. &gt;&gt; He had much to be proud of to have lived that. I know I cannot say that before the Lord Jesus Christ. But what is happening is that he said it and it was the truth. Why? Because that was God on earth. This is the discerner of hearts and discernment of thoughts and intents of the heart. and he stood there and he looked at him, the Bible says, and he loved him. &gt;&gt; The man was not telling lies. He loved him. He didn't say, "Oh, shut up. Get get thee from behind me or anything like that." No, he loved him. And this is where we have to see something again that there's a very important distinction between love of the love of God and the blessing of God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And a lot of times we mix them up. &gt;&gt; But understand, the love of God will always lead you into salvation. &gt;&gt; That is the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The love of God. Look at the apostles. Somebody was uh uh crucified head down. That was part of the love of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Somebody was sworn as sand. That was part of it. &gt;&gt; In fact, the scripture speaks of one uh John, it says the one whom the Lord loves. &gt;&gt; He was boiled in oil. &gt;&gt; That was love. &gt;&gt; Because the love of God will bring you to fulfill the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; And I remember brother Gary Walker here saying that if you knew all of it, you'll volunteer for it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he does not take you out of it. He strengthens you to go through it. &gt;&gt; That is the love of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, he blessed Solomon riches and everything. He blessed David. Glory to God. Those are blessings and they are good. &gt;&gt; But when you hear about we as humans mocking him and beating him and hanging him on the cross and all of that, that was the love. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he laughed him. And when he laughed him, what he did was he revealed what he lacked. &gt;&gt; That is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Solomon says love is corrective. &gt;&gt; So that kind of love is not very Canadian, &gt;&gt; right? Because here what we have to do is be nice, be gentle, and don't say anything and say, "Oh, things to improve upon." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Right. But the Lord Jesus Christ loved him. And when he loved him, he said, "One thing thou lstest." And in another part, in another uh version of the story, he says, "If thou must be perfect, &gt;&gt; then he goes on, he says, go sell all what you have, give it to the poor, and come follow me." That is the difficult part. The Bible says he left there grieved because he had great possession. Now I know the question of riches come up because further down the line Jesus actually said, "Oh, how hardly is it for uh a rich man to enter into heaven or into the kingdom of God?" And the Bible says the disciples were astonished. And so Jesus had to clarify it. He says, "No, no, no. I mean those who trust in riches." &gt;&gt; Now trust look, you can even be poor and trust in riches, &gt;&gt; right? And so he clarified that those who trust in riches, but still why did he make the decision for Christ and not or he made the decision for his possessions and not for Christ, &gt;&gt; right? His possessions got in the way of his faith. &gt;&gt; His riches got in the way of his faith. &gt;&gt; His position got in the way of faith. Hallelujah. So that a man who had lived a righteous life. A man who had been blessed as a result failed to enter into eternal life. Why? He did not place the giver of the blessings above the blessings. Instead, he made the blessings above the giver. Now, these blessings did not come from the devil. &gt;&gt; It came from God. &gt;&gt; It's our attitude. &gt;&gt; It's how we view them. It's how we cling to them. &gt;&gt; That is what can become a problem in the life of a believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will read this quote. Investment 63 investment says wonder if your stewardship of the church the organization is great enough to you this morning that you will turn away from it. same uh some of you men who belong to churches and sitting here this morning as businessmen. Think of it. The rich young ruler was presented that and turned it down and Christ turns and said the church age will do the same thing this last days. Now what this was in August 63. So he had just finished uh preaching indictment and now this is what he's saying. So the indictment wasn't just for the geographic location of uh United States but it was for the generation. &gt;&gt; Let's think about it and understand how privileged we are. &gt;&gt; Praise the of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he says Christ and said the church age will do the same thing in the last days. Now it's in Chicago now that you are faced to make a decision. The time is running out. I wonder what time it is. If in 1963 the time is running out says you must do it at once. make your decision for Christ to be born of a spirit. Now we find out that this rich man did this because that he loved the world. &gt;&gt; He loved his fellowship with his organization more than he loved the fellowship with the Lord Jesus. Now, if you see how he started, he said that there were some of the men sitting down there at the businessman meeting and now he's bringing this up. And so, it's for us all. This was not just for them. It's for us today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, we may find many examples in the Bible where people lean towards their possessions and their resources than their faith. In essence, they allow these things to come in between them and their God. And what happens is that the outcome has always been disastrous, irreversible harm. Sometimes the eternal destination has changed as a result of that. Consider the wife of Lot. It was the same circumstance. Now remember this lady is not her name is not even mentioned in the Bible. We just said it's the wife of Lord. But there was nothing said about her being disobedient, being proud, being arrogant. No, not in the Bible. Nothing at all. And this man was married, this lady was married to a a a godly man. But we find in an instant that she's out of Sodom. She's walking or riding away. But her house is burning. All her possessions are burning. &gt;&gt; If she has slaves, they were burning. &gt;&gt; The community where she has lived is burning. Her neighbors are burning. Her in-laws are burning. &gt;&gt; And what it she did was just turn around once. That was it. Now, I don't think it's the fire that did that, but it's the disobedience to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And so, the closer we get to the Lord, the more careful we ought to be. &gt;&gt; Now, we often talk about her her Lord's wife. But have you considered the situation of Lot himself and the children &gt;&gt; that you are walking? You all have the same instruction. And because mom turned around, she's become a pillar of salt. And so you cannot turn around even to look at mom. You cannot turn around even to look at your wife. You just have to keep going. That is the situation that her disobedience plays her family. &gt;&gt; Let's think about these things. When you are part of a collective, don't think that you own your decision. I'm a my own man. I'm a grown up. I'm my own lady. I can do what I want. No. &gt;&gt; You are part of a collective &gt;&gt; and your actions affect others. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's consider these things. Praise the name of the Lord. But now I'm hope you appreciate how difficult it is and how they had to go through. Now if a person does not have in their mind already in their soul already that no matter what I'll make a choice for Christ who can live this who can live this and that is why we need him every day. That's why we need to stay focused. That is why we don't need to allow ourselves to be distracted by frivolities. Sorry, I have to say it as it is because these things they drain us. These things they take away from us when we are supposed to be focused on we don't we shouldn't think that oh yeah I made a decision so I'm okay all is well. Faith is something else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith is the understanding that this is my life. The word is my life. &gt;&gt; That is faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not, oh yeah, I can do whatever I want. I'm going. No. That is turning grace against grace. So no matter who we are, without the grace of the Lord, situations will arise that bring out what is in us. She could not part completely with her belongings. And I personally understand it. It's it's not easy like that. And because of that, she missed eternal life. &gt;&gt; It's the same way with the rich young ruler. And what we have to realize is that these are not people who don't know God. No, these are people who know the Lord. They have lived for him. They have served him. But they still have to s face up with a situation where they have to make a choice. &gt;&gt; And they failed to make the choice for Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were believers. They had chosen the Lord's way over and over. &gt;&gt; But at this point, they failed. &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, that was the final one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; So what I'm saying is brothers and sisters, as long as we are in this life, we are going to have to make some of these decisions. &gt;&gt; And we have to, you see, the decision shouldn't be today I'm deciding for Christ. &gt;&gt; The decision should be that no matter what happens, for the rest of my life, I'm making a decision for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It may sound ridiculous. I'm making a decision anyway. It may sound odd. It may sound strange. You may not be able to even explain. But I think for the believer, the best explanation for your actions is the Lord says so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the only way and that's the best. Hallelujah. So you see if there is something in the past, if there is something that we know and we see and we think that it can get between us and our Lord, &gt;&gt; we think that it can weigh us down, get rid of it before it holds you back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it will get in your way, get rid of it before it holds you back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all what I want to say is that if you have any resolution, it should be to choose the Lord Jesus Christ over and over again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's consider Paul for a moment. In Philippians, Paul calls himself a Hebrew of the Hebrew. &gt;&gt; In Acts of the Apostles, he calls himself uh a Pharisee of the Pharisee. &gt;&gt; He says, "Concerning the righteousness of the law, I'm blameless. &gt;&gt; The man was in line to be the next high priest." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The man had Roman citizenship. Not only that, he spoke the Roman language. &gt;&gt; He was an academic. He was an intellectual. &gt;&gt; He had every resource he needed to play the role, whatever role it was given to him. What does he say? He said all those things which were gain account loss &gt;&gt; when he met the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. because all of those things and hey, what is wrong with being in line to be a high priest? What is wrong with being a Pharisee of a Pharisee? What is wrong with being a Hebrew of a Hebrew? All of that. There's nothing wrong with it. And so, think about it carefully. When something comes, oh, what is wrong? Where is that in the Bible? Think again. &gt;&gt; Consider it because it's something that can get in your way. This rich young ruler if he had actually obeyed the laws from his childhood then even his riches were not ill gotten not a scam he actually worked hard for it and the Lord blessed him but it still got in his way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's have let's be in that mode that will always make every decision for the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let's consider the children of Israel. Joshua 24. These are the people that Joshua is talking to. They were people of God. They were called of God. They were delivered from Egypt. And when they heard the message, they made a choice for Christ. They made a choice to believe it. But now they didn't believe it and just, "Oh yeah, I believe it. It's true." No. When they believed it, they put them into action. They left uh uh uh Ramses and Pitts, all those cities that they were building and went to go. But that was just the beginning. If they had believed it, then watch what they going to do now. They're going to take blood and paint their doorpost. How do you explain that to anybody? &gt;&gt; But that was the call. But that was also just the beginning. They are going to go to these people and ask for jewelry. People of citizens of this empire, they were slaves. But they went and ask for jewelry. And then they start following an old man, defying an empire &gt;&gt; with the strongest army. And they are following an old man. Not just that, [snorts] there's a straight path. They could have gone straight east across Sinan Peninsula. No, they went south all the way to the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Don't ask me to explain it. And then they go all the way and they get to h the Red Sea. And now they are stuck. They are stuck because there is mountain here, mountain here, sea ahead and the Egyptians are coming. Now the Egyptians had the same opportunity that Israel had. They heard the same gospel that Moses preached. Yes, some of them they were on the on the on the losing side, but even that they had the opportunity to believe because they experience the supernatural. At the beginning of the plague, some of them will listen and go and take their their cattle away from from from the field and their cattle won't suffer. So they knew that this was true. They saw the supernatural. They experienced the supernatural. But what happened? They rejected the supernatural. &gt;&gt; They thought it was not in their favor. How can we lose these slaves? Well, guess what? You are going to lose your land. You are going to lose your cattle. You are going to lose even the environment. It will be stinking. You are going to lose your water. You are going to lose your ferrisbones. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, they had the same opportunity, but they rejected the supernatural. And when they rejected the supernatural, they not only did that, they turned around and persecuted those who are believed. &gt;&gt; They turned around and are going after them. You see the situation? I'll read this quickly. Power of decision. Brother Abraham says, "If you notice this grateful host of Pharaoh who had seen the supernatural done and they disbelieved it, they shut up their compassion to it. They rejected it and they started out to even slay the ones that God was working with." A bit a beautiful type of what's going to happen in America one of these days. Watch that. So they not only rejected it but they persecuted those who have chosen it. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Praise the name of the Lord. Now if Israel had not followed Moses to that point which seemed ridiculous, how were they going to know that God can open the sea? &gt;&gt; That they slaves they had no military training. They were mad dobers. They could walk through the sea on dry land. &gt;&gt; But not just that, they will witness the complete destruction of the strongest army on earth. &gt;&gt; But they had to make the right decision for Christ first. &gt;&gt; This is what I'm saying. Sometimes there are so many other options that are logical. &gt;&gt; After all, he's sending us to Egypt. We can just go this is this is a shorter route. Why should we go all that way? God says so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That should be good enough for the believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We all know the story of Daniel. He had to take a stand. And he had to take a stand at the risk of his life. And when he took that stand and kept praying when he wasn't supposed to and had the windows open towards the east, that is when he got arrested. A lot of times you know we do something maybe we are wrong here and there we say oh yeah Lord you are the one who who opened the sea for for yeah they did but they followed the Lord to that point. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Daniel obeyed the Lord the Lord to that point &gt;&gt; and because of that he was dropped in there. &gt;&gt; You see when you obey God fully you become his responsibility. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that is what [clears throat] we are called to do. &gt;&gt; The Hebrew children is the same way. The was even more radical. They said, "Kin live forever. Even if he will not deliver us, we will still not bow." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that decision they have made from their childhood or whenever they accepted the Lord or they believed on the Lord is carrying them through. And part of that is that no matter the threat from the king, &gt;&gt; even they looking at the fire or they looking at whatever destruction is coming on them. Glory to God. For us, we love you. We'll respect you. We'll do what we want, but we shall not bow. &gt;&gt; That is the decision for Christ. &gt;&gt; And that is what we are called to do. If you want to see exploits in your life, if you want to see the Lord manifest himself in your life, these are the things we're supposed to do. take a stand for him and not yield under any circumstance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so to even venture into the Red Sea on dry land, it was a choice of obedience to Moses. And we can say we know how many times and instances they had to either make a choice for themselves and what is logical or make a choice for the Lord. And we know the outcomes. A lot of times the outcomes were not good. People died when they chose a golden calf. People died when they listened to Balam's deception and went for a party. people died when they looked at their circumstances. Oh, we don't have meat and whatever and and murmured. There were instances where people even uh uh um serpents even came in. You see, they had gotten closer. The Lord was revealing himself to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, the closer you get to the Lord, the more we have to learn his ways and live for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. because he also loves the opportunity to manifest himself in our lives. &gt;&gt; He loves to do it more than we want to see it. &gt;&gt; It's just that we've not taken out our stand completely. When we wholly follow him, he wholly stands in for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now all these people Joshua address in the scripture that we read, I think they made the right choices. That is why they are there where they are. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Either them or their parents made the right choices. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But at Kesh Baneer, Israel was faced with one of the most important tests in all their journey. And I believe the Lord permitted it to purge unbelief. The Lord permitted it to purge the desire for Egypt, the desire for slavery, the desire for the the things of the world because he knew that in the promised land they were going to deal with him on the basis of faith and not reason. And so they send these um spies, they go, they look out the land. And 10 of them did not tell a lie. &gt;&gt; They came back and said, "Yes, we saw these giants. Oh, man. We cannot stand them. Oh, these friends cities. Oh, they are great. We've never seen any like that before." Those were real. They were not lies. But you see the difference is that before Caleb and Joshua would go, they had the word of God in their hearts. &gt;&gt; And so when they went, all they were looking for is confirmation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. All other things meant nothing. &gt;&gt; If you look at their report, they did not even mention the giants. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They just came talking about the Lord and the Lord. And look at the proof. &gt;&gt; Look at these grapes. Oh, it's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And those who believe the other, the Bible calls it evil reports. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They also got their share. They face the wrath of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I'm just going to uh read it quickly. Um hopefully I have it here. Yes, Deuteronomy 1. I'll read it and then um I'm just getting ready to to to to finish. Like I said, today I'm trying to be good. Deuteronomy 1:34 the Bible says and the Lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth and swear saying now the all of Deuteronomy 1 we cannot read it we don't have the time but all of Deuteronomy 1 talks about the things that had happened and how the Lord had come and how they had not been faithful and all that but at this point it says and the Lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth and swear saying surely they shall Not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land which I swear to give unto their fathers. Now there is something coming in here. You see that he swore to give to their fathers. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And here they are about to inherit it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now no matter what I do, I can't shake that fatherhood thing. It's just it just keeps coming. It just keeps coming. like I'm I'm I'm learning so much and I don't want to say it scares me but it's it want it makes me say and I can say this categorically nobody can be a good father without the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; nobody it's impossible this is me and so I will stand by it if there is any issue here but what is happening is here that you see that he says the thing was made to the father. Anyway, let me keep going. Save Caleb the son of Japun. He shall see it and to him will I give the land that he had thrown in upon and to his children because he had wholly followed the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now imagine how many right decisions these people had made one after the other. They made the radish one after the and then they get here and they get it wrong and God is saying they will never enter into the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Think about it again. There are how many times they had experienced the Lord and just one or two distractions giants giants who never did anything to them and and and world cities which they were going to inherit anyway. But those things distracted them and they went against the Lord and they made the wrong decision. Let's always decide for the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the Lord swears to give the land to Caleb and to his children. Why his children? The 12 who went, none of them went with their children. The children are not even mentioned in in those instances. So why suddenly God is promising and swearing actually to give it to him and his children for his faithfulness. So he is faithful and therefore he benefits and his children benefit. The influence of fathers on their children. My sister, it's always worthy to pray for that man. Whether it's your son, whether it's your brother, whether it's your mother, pray for them. Children, pray for your fathers. &gt;&gt; Don't think it always has to be father for the children. No, pray for them. &gt;&gt; Always don't forget if they do well, you will do well. &gt;&gt; Pray for them. It's very important. Now I want to take a little time to mention an aspect of the decision study that struck me whilst I was preparing and that is Proverbs 4 and it's it's it's so important to me when I started looking at it and understanding it and I be reading for one to maybe eight. &gt;&gt; It's about Solomon and the first thing Solomon sees from whoever is reading is give me your attention. That is something that's difficult to get these days, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But understanding in this case the children, we are all children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says, "Give me your attention." And then he starts. So I'm reading from 1 to 8. He says, "Hear ye children the instruction of a father and attend to no understanding." Now, it doesn't say the instructions of your father or their father, but it's a father. So, it could be coming from any experienced person in the father position. So it says the instruction of a father for I give you good doctrine. Forsake ye not my law. Now I love people who have no qualms about who they are. They know their position. They know their ministry. And he's telling it's good doctrine. &gt;&gt; Just like Paul, he say be ye followers of me as I follow Christ. &gt;&gt; They they have no qualms. So it's up to us to decide to accept or reject. But he knows what he's given. He says good doctrine. For I was my father's son. Now watch that because he's talking about David now. And when he says I was, it means that when he was writing this, David has already passed on. I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. He taught me also and said unto me, let thine heart retain wisdom. In essence, pay attention and memorize these things that I'm telling you. It doesn't mean say your mind, your heart retain wisdom. &gt;&gt; So listen carefully. What is Solomon saying? I listen carefully and I want you to listen carefully to me now. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Remember it's David. That man who is uh after God's own heart. That man who understands what it is to fall from grace before the Lord. Who knows how is it to repent. Who know how to is it to have victories for the Lord? &gt;&gt; Who knows how it is to be exiled from his country? Who knows who has seen it all? And you will think that he will say, "Oh, well, get some good sword for battle and get some helmet and all." No, no, no, no, no. He's going to give him good stuff here. He taught me also and said unto me, "Let thine heart retain wisdom. Keep my commandment and live. Get wisdom, get understanding, forget it not. Neither decline from the words of my mouth. Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee. Love her, and she shall keep thee. Wisdom is the principle thing. Therefore, get wisdom, and with all thy getting, get understanding. Exalt her, and she shall promote thee. Watch the things that he's passing on to a young Solomon. Get wisdom. Five. Wisdom is the principal thing. Seven. Therefore, get wisdom. He repeats it the second time. &gt;&gt; And and you see what the way he describes wisdom. It's either a great treasure or a lover. What what the words he use here? Forget it. Not forsake her not and she shall preserve thee. &gt;&gt; Love her and she shall keep thee. Exalt her and she shall promote thee. I think it's good enough to think that this is like you know what a spouse or something right but this is what Solomon h David passes on to Solomon. And so in the heart of Solomon wisdom is number one. Wisdom is the most important thing. And so when the instant came when the Lord asked Solomon, "What do you want?" Understanding that because of what the father had passed on to him, he was prepared to give the right answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was in that disposition to give that right answer. &gt;&gt; Now, if you go through the Bible, you won't see any other person giving that offer. Ask whatever you want and I'll give it to you. You won't find one. Right? Of course, in the message we can talk about the rights because she also got that that same thing. Right? But what I'm saying is that and this is me, but I believe that if your heart is in that disposition, it will invites a divine favor. &gt;&gt; That's right. When you are trained to desire the things of the Lord, the Lord will grant it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because look at this. The Lord actually told him, you could have asked for your the head of your enemies. You could have asked for riches. You could have asked for a long life. &gt;&gt; You didn't. You asked for this and so I'll give all of that to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see how it is? But that was from father to son. The seed was planted there. And so for him the most important thing was wisdom. Now it turns out though that that is the purpose to which God called Solomon that the thing that he desires the most is what he actually needs to fulfill the purpose of God for his life. So think about it the influence fathers have on their children. Now we don't know what God intends to do with any of us in the future but we can be ready depending on what our hearts desire what we hold most important because if I am asked what do you want I think I'll dig in my heart and the most important thing the thing I assume the most is what I'll ask and I believe that's what Solomon also did. &gt;&gt; So in in his case it was wisdom. So we find out that in second Kings I think chapter 3 in 2 Kings chapter 3 the Lord asked him and he gave the right answer. So what I'm saying is that by the decisions we make in our own lives through the challenges that we face and everything we prepare our children for life &gt;&gt; and we also prepare them for future decisions. Solomon was given this marvelous option and it went well. So the way we prioritize things in our life might be what invites such divine favor. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now going back to the story, we have to know that these people on the promised land right now, they have made the right decision over and over and over and over again. But now they have to take a stand again for the Lord. And that's what I'm saying. If you have a a new year resolution, make the choice for Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The decision for the Lord, the decision is a decision for life and beyond. And it's not a one-time decision. It's the best decision for self. Like we've said, Solomon went through it and he got so many other things. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I read willingly decided to acknowledge the faithfulness of God and she ended up receiving the salvation of her children, &gt;&gt; decide for Christ because he has already decided for us all. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'll call the musicians. But I want to read just this one last man. I could talk about Mount Camel showdown. I could talk about Noah's decision for his family. But we all know these things. I just want to read one last quote &gt;&gt; and this is from the time of decision. Brother says, "So the time has been allotted to every man to make his decision." Sorry. Whether he's a preacher or a prophet or a church member or what more, he's got to make a decision. And this time came and Abraham was determined that he did not want his son to marry an unbeliever. That would be good decision for Christians today who are sons and daughters of Abraham to make the same decision about their children. Now it didn't make any difference how pretty those unbelieving girls were, how nice women they were. But Abraham did not want his son connected with that kind of stuff. And so he had to make a type of decision on who he should marry. Imagine going to the extent of you deciding for your children. But that is the expectation. One might ask, what era did Barraham live? And I'll say still the error of this same message. Now I'm I'm standing here. I'm a father of three children who are not yet there. You think I can I can reach there? Don't stop praying for your man. Don't stop praying for your man. The expectations are high. The standards are high. And nobody pretends to have the means to meet it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the power is in the word that is provided to us. &gt;&gt; And so we have to take the word back to the Lord and say, Lord, strengthen me to live this. &gt;&gt; This is your word. I believe it. Help me out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the name of the living God. &gt;&gt; So anyway, I know I I I went into the the fatherhood thing big time, but it's because it comes to me over and over, but all I'm saying is that let's make that decision for Christ. &gt;&gt; Because it's the best decision we can make for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's sing. Um, I'm anchored in Jesus. Upon life's boundless upon life's [singing] boundless oions where mighty beers roll my soul in Jesus bless my soul.
