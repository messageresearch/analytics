available to us and father you're so kind and so loving you've enabled us father to experience it once and we know that you had a prophet here on Earth just like you had many times in the past and he was declaring to the world to repent to get back in line with the word and declaring that this world is going through birth pains and the contractions are getting stronger and stronger and Lord tonight we're standing in the midst of a situation where the contractions are are getting stronger Lord and father we know that this world can't have very many more contractions but Lord Jesus you gave a promise to your elect lady at the End of Time father that you would not leave her nor forsake her Lord Jesus and father that in a moment in the twinkling of an eye that we would have our bodies changed Lord God and that we would not hinder those who have gone before us Lord oh Lord Jesus that they would come first out of the graves Lord Jesus and then we which are alive and remain would

that they travel to father and the companies they work for and Lord each one of the members of your body Lord Jesus that father when we go to work we would not be normal people father that we would Lord have something that would attract the people Lord that they would see a life being lived out that they would be able to see a Living Word father that it wouldn't be something that we just say

you also like to welcome back Sister Sarah odene certainly thankful that the Lord has kept his hand upon her and pray that your sisters are well and the rest of the family is also God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles maybe just open to the Book of Revelation as we continue our study in uh the exposition of the seven Church ages we're in the Ephesian Church age so we'll read from Revelations chapter 2 start at verse one Revelation 2 verse1 unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou cast not bear them which are evil and thou tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and H has found them liars and Hast borne and Hast patience and for my name's sake has labored and Hast not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nians which I also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches yes to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Jesus tonight we've come to eat from that tree in the paradise of god father we've come to feed on the unfailing body word of the Lord Jesus Christ and father we know that your word says that where the carcass is that the Eagles will be gathered and Lord we just ask that you would have your preeminence tonight that father we could all get out of the way and just allow you father to minister to us one more time we just Commit This service into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be [Music] seated I just can't help but think about the carcass in the Eagles and uh the other morning I was driving back home from dropping the kids off at school and I uh I Saw an Eagle sitting on a fence post just off the highway it was a secondary road so it wasn't a big Highway not a very big ditch either it was minus 20 and uh there was lots of Mag pies and some Ravens and there was this Eagle you could see all the little birds and mag pieses and Ravens are not really small birds but they were tiny compared to this one eagle and this Eagle was sitting on the fence post and uh you know I bet he was probably as far away as the sound booth is from here sitting on the fence post it was minus 20 and he had uh taken from a deer a fresh carcass that was right on the side of the road on the shoulder that must have been hit by a car and uh he had a piece of meat in his Talons on top of that fence post and and I stopped I rolled the window down and I just watched and and I was able to actually watch him for quite a while and I started to have a little conversation with them and uh you know Eagle to Eagle and it was interesting because there was magpies chirping around and flying around and there was the Ravens were chirping around and flying around they were jumping on the fence close to him just looking for him to drop a piece of the meat that he was eating and you know what he didn't even lift his head he wasn't bothered in the least he knew he had fresh meat he was feeding on the carcass and nothing was going to disturb him even my conversation to him I've got the video and I I I might send it out just because of this I shared it with this Bible study in the morning and uh I I'll send it out just because but it just made me think when I was I was there watching him there was nothing going to shake him he wasn't interested in any anything else going on the only thing he wanted to do was Feast on that food and he needed it to sustain him it was C out it was minus 20 and it was it was his Feast it was just wonderful are you happy tonight amen I just want to do a little recap from last week it's just such an amazing topic this exposition of the seven Church ages and the Ephesian Church age we know that a bit of each age applies to this age this is a culmination of all of the ages it's not just exclusive to one age just like scripture is not exclusive to one time or place every scripture has a compound meaning as well as Revelation but you know out of page 90 in uh in the exposition of the seven Church ages this is uh under Christ Praises his own paragraph 70 just the end of it brother maybe I'll go back and just read that part paragraph 70 and see what those false apostles were doing they came with their own word those Ephesians knew that word as Paul had taught it they were full of the Holy Ghost by laying on of Paul's hands they looked those false Apostles in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you are therefore false brother the BAM says oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it's not you that really tries the Apostle and the prophet and the teacher it is the word that tries them he says one of these days there is going to come a prophet to the leoan church age and you will know if he is the real one sent from God or not yes you will for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one ioda and we know that word ioda is a very small particle from from the Latin language he says in that last age when there will be many false prophets appearing watch and see how they keep telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you will be lost how many times have we seen that and I I just think it's astounding because I I mentioned it last time and I want to mention it again you know forget about the denominational world but how many people have you seen in and around the message preaching this gospel that if you don't believe them and what they say you will be lost not afraid to destroy families not afraid to destroy churches Not Afraid you know the book of Jude speaks about those men but they're not men they're spirits but they're spirits that get in men brother Brown goes on to say but when that last day Prophet comes on the scene if he is truly that prophet he will be crying out get back to the word or you are lost he won't build on a private Revelation or interpretation but on the word amen and amen and it's just such a an amazing thing when I think about it how isn't it wonderful how much we have with this word from a Vindicated Prophet to give us the absolute Key to Our Success to understand who we are to give us authority over the devil to give us authority over ourselves to understand that we we we will overcome and we will sit with him in his throne we don't have to be judged we don't have to go to the white Throne right we're going to be in that Throne amen you know the leoan church is the only one that's with him in that Throne that's the only one that has that promise but I think it's just amazing how we've been given this opportunity to understand so much we won't be uh misled as long as we have this word and as long as we're willing to take the whole word and nothing but the word there's no false Apostles that are going to come around and be able to mislead us and we might not be able to say I've got an exact scripture and verse where you're wrong I know you misquoted one word we might not be able to do that we might be able to actually say however that's not right there's something in there that's not right and then go and actually study it and find out what's not right but that's the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters when that happens and then the beautiful part is when you bring that and you say Hey you you know what I don't understand this you said this but the word of God says that or you said this and the message of the hour says that what are you saying did you actually do you really believe this and if they're a true son and daughter of God they'll actually fall right in line with the word there won't be any problem saying hey oh my I'm off on that I I actually am wrong do you know that message ministers who truly preach the word of God can say they're wrong right I would fear the ones that say they're not wrong those would be the ones I would be questioning right because man is is always going to make mistakes absolutely the word of God corrects those errors though thank you Lord the spirit of Truth paragraph 72 these false prophets are the Grievious wolves that Paul spoke of this is where we left off last week he said once I am gone they will try to come and claim equal Revelation but they purpose is not to help you but to destroy you and you know what's interesting with this is they're not going to come in and say we're going to take over the building and we're going to toss the chairs and flip over the desks and everything is going to become ours we're going to come in and do that no they're going to come in as an angel of Light and say oh did you ever hear this Revelation did you know that God told me this there will be something different that they're going to bring and you know what it is it tickles the ears of the people who are looking they've got itchy ears looking to Heap to themselves teachers but you know what when you've got the spirit of Christ you're not interested in that you're going to say buddy I've heard it already I I know I've got the pearl of great price I don't have to have a new revelation there's no new revelation Acts 20 27-32 for I have not shun to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood and we know that's his inheritance and he is not going to give not one iota of his inheritance away that's right continuing on he says for I know this that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise this really struck me I've been studying this all week also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things their own word and ideas not God's to draw away disciples after them not even men coming in yes sir therefore watch and remember remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone night and day with tears and now brother and I command you to God commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you in inheritance among all them which are Sanctified did you ever think about it we were talking about this but it's just such a powerful Revelation a powerful thought that when we are persecuted for Christ's sake it's his grace towards us and we know brother Bram he has a quote for it I can't remember it off hand I'll probably mix it up if I say it but we know that persecutions when they come for Christ's sake it's his grace towards us and his correction according to his word is his grace towards us it's not to punish us and to destroy us and to break us down is to build us up first joh John 41 brother brandham he says John knew of them also for he said many false prophets are already gone out in the world and brothers and sisters I'm I'm going to say it again we don't need to worry about the denominational world we don't need to worry about all of the ranked sinners in the world what we need to worry about is the people who claim to believe this message of the hour and we need to just call it plainly like that I'm not saying that anyone in here is that way but you know just like most of us we have probably favorite Ministry and and we can get online and go and listen to a Ministry it's so easy to do and and sometimes it's very uplifting but you know what there's a lot of different ideas in this world and now that we have this connection it's a very big pool that we can swim in brothers and sisters and there's a lot of false doctrin swimming around in that pool we've got to be very careful I would never tell you you can't watch anyone else you have to follow just this ministry that's actually falling in line with that what we're talking about you know the word of God says that you should have a pastor there's a five-fold Ministry and that's the way it is there is a five-fold Ministry yes and to try and rule that out is incorrect there's a balance to it though to stay home and say no I'm just going to stream because somewhere somehow some man hurt me or my family and I'll never give them the opportunity to do it again you're discounting discrediting the word of God amen you're saying that there's no way God can still operate in the office of a pastor God helped the pastors pray for the pastors cuz they're going to answer for every single thing that happens every single action but you know it's wonderful to think that even though those false prophets are out there there is a truth and we don't need to be afraid amen I would encourage you to actually listen to different Ministry now I'm going the other way with it but I would encourage you to listen with the ear that God has given you through his Spirit if you can listen through the holy ghost in your life you will be able to tell what's being preached and it won't matter who it is and it won't matter where it's at some of it is very very bold there's one Ministry that I heard of where they're actually praying in this man's name in the message but then there's other ones that will be mostly exactly right even praying in the name of Jesus Christ but one word off is Satan's kingdom one word off is what deceived Eve and you know the church is the feminine Christ is the masculine the church is the feminine so for us to say that the woman she's the weaker vessel who's the the woman in that scenario we need the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters we need his spirit in our lives this is a spiritual battle that's being waged and you know when we look around the world we can see natural circumstances and situations and they've got tanks on the ground they've got boots on the ground they've got planes in the sky they're moving forward and they're just crushing the enemy you know what that's what Satan's kingdom is trying to do it's trying to just do an onslaught to the Believers of this age outside of the Holy Ghost we won't stand paragraph 73 that Antichrist Spirit was already infiltrating the church and it was doing it by going against the word why here is where it all started right here in the first church age already they were denying the word and setting up their own Creeds and philosophies instead of the word and we know that's a way of thinking the philosophy right he says that is Antichrist for Jesus is the word to be anti- word is to be anti- Jesus to be anti- word is to be Antichrist you don't have to have the mark of the beast remember to reject the Holy Ghost is to accept the mark of the beast we're born in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking lies you've already got the mark of the beast when you came into this world brothers and sisters through this hybrid condition to reject the acceptance of the Holy Ghost at the age of accountability is to already accept what you have already you've got the mark of the beast that's the way it is but this Antichrist for Jesus is the word to be anti- word is to be anti- Jesus to be anti- word is to be Antichrist because the spirit and the word are one if you are anti- word you will have to be Antichrist you know I just can't help but think while we're preaching this someday and hopefully not really soon but someday we're going to get shut down for these words because people don't want to hear this people want to have the Liberty to do whatever they want to do right and and they want to have the Liberty to worship however they want to worship but the Believers will say it's going to be exactly according to the word right yes if you're anti- word you will have to be Antichrist and if it started in the first church it will have to grow until the end when it takes over and that is exactly what you will see as we cover all the ages it starts out real small in the Ephesian age and it grows in every age until the antiw word Antichrist system takes over entirely and the infallibility of the word is repudiated by the false Pro false Apostles of the false church now it's easy to get the wrong impression of what we are talking about because I'm making this so strong it could sound to you as though this anti- word Antichrist spirit is a complete repudiation of the word a denial of the Bible C culminating in its rejection no sir it's not that what it is Revelations 22:18-19 for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of this book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book it always goes back to the scripture paragraph 75 it is the changing of even just one word by taking way or adding to it and this is why brothers and sisters I mentioned it a while ago but you know the prophet in our day he used the King James version Bible and some of the other Bibles that that are out there they're available I I I look at the Amplified Bible once in a while and compare words just maybe scriptures just to maybe get a different perspective on it but I always go back to the King James version and that's my desire is to encourage people always just go back to the King James version make that your anchor and if there's something in there that we can't understand just ask God for Spiritual Revelation ask him to reveal what scripture means and he is obligated by that because he is his word his word is him in print form but some Bibles actually eliminate entire verses some Bibles eliminate words out of verses they change the meaning of the verse right one of these days we'll do a very clear demonstration of that we'll show which Bibles actually do some of those things it's it's important it's vital it's the trick of the devil that's what he did in the very beginning In the Garden of Eden take one word or add one word you take your part out of The Book of Life paragraph 75 it is the changing of even just one word by taking away or adding to it it is the original trick of Satan in the Garden of Eden he just added one little word to what God had said that did it it brought death and destruction and in Ephesus it was just the same just a word added just a word taken away and the antiw word Antichrist Spirit began to flourish remember the the statue of Diana that brother Bram talked about it was just a very vague figure it just was a a very fague feminine feminine figure and it didn't have very much to it it wasn't very appealing and it just had two arms of iron it was a very very subtle thing and and that was actually just the beginning but that's how Satan does it very subtle brother Bram he says that that anti- word Antichrist Spirit began to flourish just by one word one word off he says do you get it now paragraph 76 there are those twins again there are those two trees again growing side by side in the same Earth partaking of the same nourishment drinking in the same rain and benefiting by the same son but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of God exactly as God gave it and loves and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of God and changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own Creeds and dogmas for the living true word exactly as Cain did who ended up killing Abel remember they both woried they both were raised in a good message home they had message believing parents yeah Adam was the son of God he never had a belly button God formed him and I can imagine Eve never had one either because God formed her out of Adam's Rib she was actually a part of him but these two boys they actually had the same parents they knew how to worship but one had a revelation and one just had an instruction and isn't it interesting even the one that just had an instruction he couldn't receive the instruction right even though he was given the correction he wasn't able to receive that correction which identified him it identified his seed it identified his nature his father's nature because he turned into a a murderer he was angry he turned into a murderer a liar uh uh it's just ridiculous what what what happened the depths of Satan but that's you know that was his father he was a chip off the old block the other tree is from the seed that is anti- word of God and changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own Creeds and dogmas for the living true word exactly as did Cain who ended up killing Abel he said says but fear not little flock stay with the word we just want to stay with the word that's all we want to do keep that word between you and the devil Eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of Satan but remember the church doesn't actually close the doors and shut off the lights and and go out of existence the church goes on worshiping and you know what the church might actually begin to prosper the church might actually begin to thrive and bring new members in and actually have just a wonderful time of signs wonders and miracles but it doesn't mean they're right Revelations 2:3 and Hast born and Hast patience and for my name's sake H has labored and Hast not fainted he says this is just about the same as was said in verse two but in verse two the work labor and patience were from guarding the sacred word which was committed unto them how they kept away the adversaries what a credit they were to Paul and I remember thinking about this a long time ago and I just remember thinking I have an opportunity to be a credit to my pastor I have an opportunity to be actually something that would be a ability or a debit to my pastor or I could be a credit to my pastor and you know I chose to try my best to be a credit to my pastor and I know many times I probably failed that way but I thought it was so wonderful because I had the opportunity to try and actually encourage him and just show him that there was someone in his Corner that that someone is pushing for him and and this just really kind of encouraged me that way what a credit they were to Paul but in this verse their persecutions and trials and Patience are over the Blessed name of Jesus it had nothing to do with them it was all about the name of Jesus he says you know that is not at all strange for it is the word and the name that brings the enemy pouring after us like a flood that Mighty word which was manifested in healing signs and wonders and other demonstrations caused the Pharisees to to scream out for the death of the True Believers and now that name hated and despised by the Jews is mocked by the cultured as they laugh to think anyone could be so foolish as to believe in a man who died and rose again and is now seated in heaven I just can't help but think it's the exact same spirit that would say everyone else is baptizing in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost and your little groups of people are baptizing in this name isn't it the same Spirit brothers and sisters it's the name that brings the persecution because the name is what contains the power we can claim the blood all we want but if you've got the name of Jesus Christ that's where demons tremble but he goes on to say who to them was a false Messiah they were they were I'll just go back and pick up that again I always get in the way oh this word is so good they hated and despised by the Jews is mocked by the cultured as they laugh to think anyone could be so foolish as to believe in a man who died and rose again is now seated in heaven so here were the religious persecutors the Jews cursing this Jesus who to them was a false Messiah and here were the others laughing with delight and mocking sarcastic ially at the name of a new God who to them wasn't God at all right this just made me while I was studying this pondering it made me think about the the two maleactors on the cross you know yeah both of them committed crimes worthy of death a and one on one hand and one on the other and one of them was saying the same thing as the most religious as these Jews that were mocking him and laughing at him while he was there on the cross in the middle of the two a and he was saying yo Jesus you're you're a a miracle man get us down man let us get out of here there's no reason for us to perish if you're if you're this Christ if you could save everyone else save us and the other one is the one that corrected him isn't that interesting the other one is the one that said hey you fool we're worthy of this punishment you know that we are but this man this man is innocent he has done nothing and we know that Jesus said hey you know what he asked him will you remember me remember me when you're in your in your kingdom don't forget about me man and Jesus said you know for that saying you'll be with me in Paradise isn't that interesting and we've all probably heard the story recently but I just want to throw this out there because you know what will people say how are you bapti AP ized what did you do how how long did you serve in your church what was your tenure what's your lineage how long did you believe the message of the hour this guy's going to say hey you know what I just met this man I met the man named Jesus that's all I can tell you I don't have any theology I can just say that I met him and I believe him but here we have these people mocking him and and it's no different the same Spirits yes sir paragraph 79 now here is something else that started in that age and will continue right down Through the Ages getting deeper and darker that is people were repudiating that name it was not the true Ephesian church that was doing it no sir it was the false Apostles yes it was The Outsider trying to get in and defile the Believers the Ephesians knew that name and loved it recall the origin of that Ephesian church a little group of people who were looking for the Messiah heard that a prophet who called himself the Forerunner of the Messiah had appeared in the desert of Palestine and was baptizing people unto repentance of sins these then receiving the baptism of John but when Paul came to them he showed them that a prophet that the prophet was dead said that Jesus had come and fulfilled his life as a sacrifice for sin and that now the Holy Ghost was come and would enter in and fill all True Believers in Jesus the Messiah when they heard of this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus you know just as I was studying this I couldn't help but think there was a time and a place where there was a man on Earth who was baptizing in an afternoon about the 17th person in the Ohio river and what happened something very similar to this scenario happened a light came down and said just as John was sent to forerun the first coming of the Lord so you and your ministry will forerun the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and even there in that situation we know there was a girl sitting up on the bank I think even in a boat and she was mocking the prophet she was laughing she wasn't taking it serious one bit isn't that the exact same spirit that we were just talking about at the cross of Jesus and the most religious people those most religious ones not everyone can see it if we have the ability to see this it's truly a blessing truly a gift from God goes on to say and when Paul had laid his hands upon them they were all filled with the Holy Ghost they knew what it was to obey the word to be baptized in His Name Lord Jesus Christ and in that way they knew they would be filled with the Holy Spirit you could not get that people to change they knew the truth of Acts 19 veres 1-7 paragraph 80 they knew the power of that name they saw that name was so powerful that even aprons taken from the body of Paul and sent in jesus' name to suffering people could deliver the sick from all manner of diseases and cast out evil spirits so manifestly wonderful did that name perform that reprobate Jews at Ephesus attempted to use it to exercise Devils I'm just going to pause there for a second brothers and sisters make no mistake about it that was not just something from Paul that was not just something from William Mary and branam the same principle applies and it's all based on faith if a True Believer any True Believer even the smallest of child prays over a garment and gives that to someone that's a prayer cloth if they have the same spirit that was in Paul then the same action has to take place he's the same yesterday today and forever it does not take a great ministry and I know some folks might be saying Oh Brother Barry now you're pushing it we either have the same Spirit or we don't brothers and sisters he is either the same yesterday today and forever it it's got to be Jesus Christ I I think I would be very afraid if we actually look to other Ministries maybe pastors or or prophets or evangelists or teachers and said they're the only ones that have the ability to pray over a prayer cloth and actually give it to someone and see that someone put it against their body just like we talked about here in this in this book tonight the scripture about Paul having prayer cloths it's got to be the same Jesus Christ I think I would be afraid if we have a trust in somebody else more than we would have faith in our ability to take him at his word ourselves and I know that's a stretch maybe for some people but brothers and sisters we're not here to stay in the same place God is only interested in one thing in every single one of our lives and that is spiritual growth and if we're not growing we're dying that's the law of the universe here there's no neutral ground where I can just say hey I can just coast and I'll just be fine that's where the devil's going to come and get you and you know the devil he can't get you entirely God will say you know what if you're my son I'll I'll just say who's going to who's going to bring my word to pass in my son or my daughter's life they're just a little bit out of line we need somebody to come and actually do something for them who's going to do that for me and we know there's spirits that are right there saying I'll go they can't wait to get a chance and he'll say do what you want to do but you cannot go any further than what his parameters are we're not wrestling against flesh and blood brothers and sisters it's a spiritual Onslaught that we're dealing with going into this scripture here I think it's so good I don't know how far we'll get acts 191 to1 17 you want to turn there tonight or we could just read it here you don't have to turn it's it's in here I for that we have this and God wrought special Miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them I just love how it's it's Crystal Clear in the scripture here it's not just diseases something scientifically classified and named it's a devil that's then certain of the Vagabond Jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits in the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adjure You by Jesus whom Paul preacheth workers of iniquity right here and there were seven sons of one CA a Jew and a chief of the priests which did so and the evil spirit answered answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are ye and this just really speaks to me because when I first became a Christian when I first started attending I remember brother Ken preaching a sermon on this scripture in the upper room and man it was powerful it just really captivated me to think that there's people that will try and and deal with Spirits they will try and actually act like they've got some sort of a a thing going on and the reason I say this is because I was raised in a church and I went out into the world and I used to stay up very late and watch television and I would watch the televangelist and I would click and watch another Tel evangelist and click and watch another Tel evangelist and see the the things that they're doing with the people and how there's healings and and and there was one of them that would that would scream and yell and he would talk about death deaf girl and I remember him pulling on her ears saying come out in the name of Jesus and just doing all this and but I just remember seeing all of that and thinking is this even real is there anything to this this is all just a a bunch of Lies they're all just pretending false Pretenders but here in this scripture I'm able to see that no there's people that actually do attempt to do this there's people that really do try and control the situation my goodness we can carry on and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are ye and the man in whom the evil spirit was leapt on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling in Ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified we talked about it a while ago brothers and sisters Spirits are nothing to play with you got to know where you're standing and you know it's it's a real thing it's a very real thing but we know greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and we need to be able to say those words that scripture with authority with conviction we need to know where we stand because if we don't we can be overrun paragraph 81 they knew the righteous life that accompanied the bearing of that name for whosoever nameth the name of the Lord 2 Timothy 2 19 let him depart from sin be holy ye that bear the vessels of the Lord Isaiah 52:11 Thou shalt not bear the name of the Lord thy God in vain Exodus 20:7 these Ephesians were Christians they bore a name and that name was Christ who was the spirit of God within them and which was one of the three-fold names of their lord and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted these Believers weren't laboring for Paul or for an organization they weren't committed to programs and institutions whereby they built up Holdings of value they worked for the Lord they were his servants not the ponds of organization they didn't go to church on Sunday and talk about that name and then forget it the rest of the week I just want to pause there that's a very important point they didn't give lip service to that name no sir it was their lives that were given amen and you know brothers and sisters those ones who were the seven sons of one siba they were the ones that gave lip service to that name they were the ones that spoke the name probably on Sunday and maybe Wednesday but didn't give a thought about it the rest of the week there was no consideration for it paragraph 83 all they did they did in that name speaking about the Believers the Ephesian Church the real Church in that name they acted but if they could not act in that name then they refrained from acting these were Heavenly placed Christians whose Behavior was in the Lord but that false fineing group that wanted to defile that name hung like skull king wolves in the dark waiting to get in and tear down but the Saints stood the test and kept the word and the name you know brothers and sisters when we look at this we can see that there is the True Vine and there is the false Vine and and they're always going to be together and you know the True Vine doesn't behave like the false Vine the True Vine has the ability to perceive because of the spirit that's in her the True Vine has the ability to see those people who maybe aren't acting like True Vine but the True Vine doesn't have the ability to determine whether someone is a True Vine or isn't a True Vine the only thing that True Vine does or has the ability to do is to perceive their behavior right now the True Believer doesn't work like a skullking wolf and say oh my where's the Believers doesn't anybody believe like I believe how can that be no that's getting a little Pious and a little puffed up the True Believer says my if the people won't believe that I'm going to pray more if the people won't sing that I'm going to sing louder if the people won't go to church I'm going to go to church more the True Vine is going to be an encouragement to everyone the false Vine is going to be the one that just can't take it but it's not up to the True Vine to determine who the false Vine is right the True Vine just wants to encourage life amen but that false fine group that wanted to defile the name hung like skullking wolves in the dark waiting to get in to tear down but the Saints stood the test and kept the word and the name I just love how brother Bram said that earlier in this book they just kept the word between them and Satan we need to just keep that word between us and Satan and we need to do that in such a way that we know where we stand and you know some people are going to say you're holy rollers but you know there's there's those who are Holy Rollers that are praying and looking out for others and then there's those who are the Holy Rollers that we would say holy rollers that are saying oh my nobody is good like me look at me I never see everything in my life is good I want to say this which one is the skullking wolf remember the word of God says that Grievious wolves will get in not sparing the flock it's not going to be out there somewhere brothers and sisters and you know what was the biggest sin what was the first sin in heaven the very first sin in heaven was Pride that was the biggest one brothers and sisters and we know that we suffer from one of three the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes or the pride of life now we might not be like maybe one of these high rollers in the states that are billionaires and have the the suits and the Jets and the cars and all of the watches and everything else going on the houses and whatever but we could just be full of Pride sitting in a church thinking that I'm okay that I've never done anything wrong and it's the same Spirit that's anointing that person that's anointing these other people who are blatant full of pride but we need to know where we stand the True Vine is not going to be puffed up the True Vine is going to be humble amen and meek and of a good nature and we know the fruit of the spirit we can go into that but I'm not going to tonight maybe on Sunday we will but you know it's very clear the true and the false but the True Vine doesn't destroy the false the True Vine doesn't judge the false the True Vine encourages the complaint of God Revelations 2:4 nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy first love to understand this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original Saints of Ephesus alone this message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years its message then is to all the generations in that span Now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel we see Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third generation Embers may be growing slightly glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestage whatsoever of that original flame then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren there's no Apostolic succession brothers and sisters and the prophet says it here but just because Mom and Dad believed this message of the hour doesn't mean automatically the children are saved right we have to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling but I would go a step further to say that if we can believe then we have the ability to apply the token to our family amen and maybe maybe we could in a situation where our family doesn't get to go in a Rapture with us that's God's choice that's not ours and we're not going to say one way or the other but just to maybe bring some some light to the situation that doesn't mean that they're lost doesn't mean they're lost one bit right amen they might actually be saved it's not up to us to say who is or who isn't brothers and sisters it's not the spirit of Christ that does that we just want to believe my God then God lights the fire again the same process is repeated it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth anymore than there is any truth to Apostolic succession it isn't the word you start out with truly Born Again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they are no longer just plain Christians but they have taken a denominational name and are now Baptists Methodist Etc that is exactly what they are to they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved and that's why I say brothers and sisters just because we're in the message of the hour don't mean nothing right you got to be saved our children need the baptism of the Holy Ghost our friends and our family need the baptism of the Holy Spirit we all do but just to say that we're a member of a church it doesn't mean nothing that's right when we go out and try and contend in this world and there's people that hear that we're a part of a church and and their behavior the Devils that are inside of them begin to loathe our existence those devils are going to come after you they're going to come after us we need to know where we stand brothers and sisters this ain't no time to play church and say that I believe the message of the hour but I'm not willing to give my life all the way I just can't I just can't help it brothers and sisters I would say it's the anointing maybe call it the gift we have to get into Christ we cannot be playing church we can't just be coming to church we've got to get the Holy Ghost in our lives maybe this is a little bit about how the the prophets have felt in the past I'm not trying to make myself anyone like a prophet or anything but the only thing we've got is the holy spirit brothers and sisters outside of that we can have a Bible and it's not going to mean anything I I heard someone saying that they have children that go to school a Christian School and and they're being taught to memorize entire chapters of the Bible and isn't that wonderful I thought my goodness how could they do that and I know that there was a time in my life where they were doing that with the children and of course I was not that studious I don't know if I ever will be but you know it's interesting because the children they can do it they can learn the entire book the entire chapter upon chapter upon chapter and that's good isn't it but do they have an understanding of that word is there an actual Revelation that's coming into their life many people can be book smart but not very Street wise and we need to know exactly where we stand the only way we're going to be able to have this word have power that manifests in our lives is to have the Holy Ghost because when the two come together that's the power that's the mechanics is the word and the Dynamics is the spirit and when those two come together in the heart of a Believer watch out brothers and sisters that's where the devil has no power over you my you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together now by the will of man I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fires has died down they are not the same anymore the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it is cooled off and become a bit formal now I want to say this brothers and sisters I don't want to be formal and I don't want us to get too formal if we're being led by the spirit then we need to be led by the spirit we can start to create parameters and start to set things up and make things certain ways and do things certain somehow and and make things just perfect according to our thinking but is that what he wants he wants the praise from our hearts the fruit of our worship on our lips that's what he's looking for and if we're holding back because of some program or some thing in our life that we're doing brothers and sisters let's just take a step backwards and say Lord what do you want from me what's my purpose of coming to worship am I just coming to say that I'm going to church and and it's a nice way to say I go to church I'm going to worship this morning or am I going like the sons of God like the morning stars that sang together and what did the sons of God do they shouted to the Lord they weren't quiet and I can imagine they never let nothing get in the way of their worship nothing nothing stopped them not one ioda of anything can hold back worship true worship from a son or daughter of God Jesus said that the rocks will cry out that was God speaking through him right if you won't worship then the rocks will immediately cry out why oh my we don't want to get a bit formal that is what was happening back there to Ephesus they were getting a bit formal the abandonment of God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them that second generation coming on was just like Israel they demanded a king to be like the other nations when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway remember Samuel he was heartbroken because he did everything that he could to be in his position and God had to tell the prophet hey you know what don't worry because they're not rejecting you they're rejecting me and I can only imagine that broke his heart more but they did it anyway paragraph 88 that is the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and you know he says and start doing things they would do initially I just as I was reading this I was thinking this happens in marriage it happens in marriage we get so used to being married we can just take it for granted the husband's going to be there the wife's going to be there we're just husband and wife and we've got this life now and things are different what's different brothers and sisters the only way that it's going to work that you're going to go forward is that you remember your first love that you actually keep that romance alive now this is sounding crazy crazy for me to go here but I just think it's so important the natural type's the spiritual that's not what I say that's what brother brandham said but you know we can get comfortable in our position and we can just stop doing the things that we used to do we can stop being kind and loving and emotional and supportive and encouraging and and we can just allow ourselves to express ourselves our real self the self that maybe we didn't ever express before and start doing things that we wouldn't do initially like just have a temper tantrum and just blow our tops and and it's just whatever but you know we can start doing things like that in the church too brothers and sisters we can just forget about our first love we've got a good church everything is fine but forget about doing the little things that we used to do brother Bram talks about having all night prayer meetings I'm not saying we should or shouldn't do that but what I am saying is are we forgetting the first love we don't want to do that let's not get too formal and starchy we know that the Antichrist spirit is going to creep into the framework of the Christian Church causing it to be lukewarm formal and Powerless who wants to be lukewarm formal and Powerless not one of us he goes on to say they change their manner of dress their attitudes and their behavior they get lack now I think we could dwell here for a little while brothers and sisters they change their manner of dress their attitudes and and behavior they get lack that is what Ephesus means relaxed drifting I'll call the musicians I don't want to keep us late tonight he says that cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you have to do is recall this last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians went to church prayed all night took the street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes or old store buildings they had reality you know maybe stand with me as we close here I remember once upon a time in my life I got LAX did you ever get LAX I got to the place where I got a bad attitude my behavior changed and I even changed my manner of dress and you know when we're coming to Church why are we coming to church are we coming to meet with the king of kings and Lord of lords imagine if someone prepared a banquet and said tonight we're going to have maybe the president of the United States we're going to have the premere of Alberta and we're going to have the Lord Jesus Christ all of them you know very important people are going to be at this banquet how would we come dressed to that banquet would we just come in our work scrubs or would we dress up and give our very best I want to be real clear myself I know what it's like to work and and how on a Wednesday especially there's times where we can't go home and change to come to service because we work all day but we can bring a change of clothes who are we coming to meet when we come to this house are we coming to meet the king of kings and Lord of lords amen and you know once upon a time it was said that we would wear our Sunday Best to go to church to meet with the Lord and I I'm telling you this because I myself got a bad attitude I got LAX I had my behavior change once upon a time and I know what it was it was a spirit it was absolutely a spirit afflicting me coming after me attacking me but you know the spirit of God is always there to deliver us brothers and sisters amen I want to encourage each and every one of us don't get LAX don't allow the bar to go down right rise and trim the lamp amen because the bridegroom has come he's not coming brothers and sisters he's come and what's going to happen what's going to be the surprise what's going to be the Shocker is the bridegroom is going to be gone and that door is going to be closed and there's going to be some that are saying Lord we know you're there let us in let us in and he's going to say hey I never even knew you I called and called and called but you didn't answer you weren't willing to answer we have the opportunity to answer let's just go to him in prayer tonight gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your word we thank thank you for this book Lord that you allowed your Prophet to publish father the words that you gave to him Lord to put in these Pages the edification of your bride father tonight I pray that the words that were spoken Lord
