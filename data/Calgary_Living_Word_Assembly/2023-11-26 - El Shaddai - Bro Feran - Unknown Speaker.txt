--Song Lyrics--

EL SHADDAI

Chorus
El shaddai, El shaddai
El-elyon na Adonai 
Age to age You're still the same
By the power of Your Name
El shaddai, El shaddai
Erkamka na Adonai
We will praise and lift You high
El shaddai

Verse
Through the years You've made it clear
That the time of Christ was near
Though the people couldn't see
What Messiah ought to be
Your most awesome work was done
Through the frailty of Your Son
I will praise and lift You high
El shaddai

Chant
El Shaddai, the All-Sufficient One,
Powerful, Mighty, Magnificent,
My God,
Elohim, the Creator of Heaven and Earth,
Before the worlds were framed or formed,
There You are, the I AM that I AM,
Your ways are past finding out, Lord,
Jehovah Jireh, my Provider,
Jehovah Rapha, my Healer,
Jehovah Nissi, my Banner,
With You, nothing is impossible,
Yahweh, You are faithful to Your promises,
El Shaddai!!!
