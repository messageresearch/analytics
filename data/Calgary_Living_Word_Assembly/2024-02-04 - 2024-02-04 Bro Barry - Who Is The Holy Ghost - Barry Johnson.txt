what a tremendous Story how she just got inspired by the Holy Ghost yes and what happened was she Rose her up and she raised her hands to the Lord and just started worshiping spontaneously while she shouldn't be playing she should have been at her post of Duty but something overcame her and she started playing and isn't it interesting that the Lord took over that worship and you know brothers and sisters that same Lord that was there and that story is here right now it's a tremendous thing he's not the I was and he's not the I will be he's The Great I Am we just have a couple of requests this

brother and sister Young from Edmonton Spruce Grove brother Chris's parents God bless [Applause] you i' also like to welcome back brother Ezekiel we have haven't seen him for quite some time God richly bless you brother I trust you feel right at home this morning in our scripture reading just like to read from acts 7 verse 1 acts 7 verse 1 then said the high priest are these things so and he said men Brethren and fathers hearken the god of Glory appeared unto our Father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in cheron we know this is the story of stevenh he's preaching up a sermon here verse three and they said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy King Kindred and come into the land which I shall show thee then came he out of the land of the Chalan and dwelt in cheran and from then when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell and he gave them him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him as yet he had no child and God spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a Strange Land and that they should bring them into bondage and ENT treat them evil 400 years and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge said God and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place and he gave him the Covenant of circumcision and so Abraham begat Isaac and circumcised him the Eighth Day and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob begat the 12 Patriarchs let's just bow one more time in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the story of Steven the testimony of his life Lord and right to the very end how he could just stand upon your word and Lord Jesus not bring his own opinion but to just simply bring your word to bring the truth of the history of this gospel father that it was so alive not just out of the pages of a book that it was so alive in the heart of our brother we know that he saw you seated on the right hand of glory and father we know that as the world hated him as as the people stoned him and took his life we know that you just you allowed it father For Your Glory now Lord as we go forwards this morning we just want to commit this service all that's said and done into your hands For Your Glory bless the reading of your word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning you may be seated I don't know if somebody is missing this little brooch it was found I I think in the uh in the back room there the nursing room um the deacons found it and then put it in the office and I was supposed to mention it quite some time ago I apologize but um better late than never I guess if you're missing that brooch it's kind of beautiful I'm sure uh you could get it back if you desire are you happy this morning just a couple of announcements as we get going today we'll have a prayer meeting on the 15th at 7:30 we have a Youth Event coming up up at the 25th we've confirmed the date um there's an annual General men's meeting at the church February 29th at 7:30 p.m. we'll have all of this coming up in the very near future we are working on going away and uh we're going to go to Saskatchewan for a few days and so we'll have a couple of the brothers take two of the services here it'll be a Wednesday and a Sunday Lord willing and uh I don't know what happen on that side and I'm honestly not looking to preach I would just like to go and say Amen that would be fine with me so um this morning the direction that I would like to take uh from the scripture that we've read out of Acts chapter 7 is exactly the scripture that brother Bram took in the message what is the holy ghost in 1958 and and this is out of the Holy Ghost study out of the exposition sorry out of the table it's it's out of the table app I was going to say the exposition of seven Church ages just because it's top of mine for me it's really where I'm at these days but out of the table app if you were to look up the holy ghost in the different like the volume section of that search app you would see uh two sermons Under The Heading the Holy Ghost and uh I just think it's really important for us sometimes to never assume that everyone is on the same page that everyone just understands exactly what we're talking about sometimes we can be talking about some things and just assume that everyone is on the same page and and it's not the case sometimes the children don't know and and you know specifically to the Holy Ghost I remember when I was a child I I remember unfortunately we did see TV it was we had a television in our house when I was growing up it's not something I'm proud of but it's just the way life was and uh many people still have TV in their house and they're plugged in and they just watch whatever but you know when I was a child I think I saw too many things too many programs because I thought the Holy Ghost G was you would hear about the blood and you would hear about the ghost and all all of this different depictive terms and as a child the only reference point I had was what I was exposed to with television so I would look at the movies and see all of the advertisements and and begin to try and put it together that way as as a tangibility something that I could really understand but brothers and sisters the Holy Ghost is not something from a horror movie The Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ himself the Holy Ghost is that Pillar of Fire that we see over top of William Mary and Bram that's not just a fantastic picture of a man sent from God that is a picture of the Holy Ghost and you know when we gather together brothers and sisters we have pillars of fire also they're they're on a different Spectrum though we just don't have the ability to see that with our eyes now some people would say well brother Barry if if they could see that Pillar of Fire over top of the Prophet why can't we see it over top of each one of us because that's the way God made us yes Satan can't tell who we are Satan is only going to assume who we are and he's going to try and take every single one of our faults and failures all of our genetics he knows who our great great great great grandparents were um maybe some of them with dark pasts uh histories maybe they weren't very good people at all maybe they were under the influence of devils and we know that that spirits will travel through generations through generations through generations but you know brothers and sisters in our day and age where we live today we have been given a completely open book we have been given the complete Pillar of Fire we have been given complete deliverance from any one of those generational curses that could be over top of a family so to say that's the way my dad was that's no longer an excuse It's only because we want it to be that way we have the ability to overcome these things in our lives and it's not easy I'm not saying it's easy don't get me wrong it ain't easy it's hard but you know we've been chosen to take the harder way we've been chosen to walk the harder path how how easy was it for Jesus to take that cross and carry it up that hill as far as he could how easy was it for Jesus to go to Calvary how easy was it for Jesus to overcome his own will as a man that wanted to get married that wanted to have children that wanted to actually live as a human being to have his friends and fellowship but to lay all of that aside and say alas not my will but let thy will be done even though he was asking the Lord in one sentence earlier can I just let this cup pass from me my something changed in him he had the ability to overcome it and we know that Jesus was different than every other man although he was human he was God every wit but he still had to overcome amen he still had to have that battle yes amen but I just thought it'd be really good brothers and sisters you know we're talking on Wednesdays about the exposition of the seven Church ages and and and the Holy Ghost getting in the spirit on the Lord day getting in the spirit many times we can talk about that and say getting in the spirit is so important but what is getting in the spirit brothers and sisters it's entering in of course but we want to make sure that we're talking about the right thing we want to make sure that we're we're speaking the same language we don't want to assume anything about anyone we want to make sure when we say getting in the spirit it means getting into the Holy Spirit getting the Holy Spirit into us when that happens we will be like those people that were in the upper room 120 people they got in one mind one Accord not their mind not their ideas not their stuff history all of that they weren't busy looking at themselves in the mirror they weren't busy looking at each other saying look at what you've done look at what you haven't done they finally got all of that out of the way and that's why they were told to go wait until you're endured from Power with power from on high and when that time came when they stopped looking each other when they just got in unison and one mind and one Accord what happened the Holy Ghost came sweeping through their place and what happened we know there's identifiers we can see that there's identifiers and that's one of the things that brother bradam says over and over and over again the message of the hour it ain't no different today but somehow sometimes I think I I can see it I can perceive it that somehow some way it's almost demonstrated that it is different today than it was then they stumbled like they were drunk people Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen I'm not saying go and roll around in the aisles and do somersaults just to prove that you can be silly and act like a drunk person but what I am saying is if the Holy Spirit overwhelms you brothers and sisters don't resist them let it go because if it's the Holy Spirit it will actually Bear record of himself so you know as we go forwards with this study the Holy Ghost the first message is what is the holy ghost in 1958 it's 12 16 the second one is that's in the morning and the next one I believe is in the evening I I could have it wrong actually I think they're two days sorry um the next one is what was the Holy Ghost given for I I would like to just maybe see if when we talk about this if by the end of it we could actually change it from what is the Holy Ghost to who is the Holy Ghost not that I want to put words in and say this is what the prophet said this is what he meant I'm not doing that what I want to do is make it present tense I am I want to make it our Holy Ghost I want to say who is the Holy Ghost it's you brothers and sisters he's chosen a temple that's not made with hands and that's really where we're going with all this but what was the Holy Ghost given for I want to change that as well to say who was the Holy Ghost given for because the Holy Ghost wasn't given for everyone not everyone has the ability to get oil in their lamps there was five wise and five unwise virgins but then there was a whole bunch of other people brothers and sisters wasn't there isn't there a lot of people that will never ever ever be able to receive anything that we say here they'll say ah it's a bunch of nonsense it's a cult you guys are fanatical crazies following a man just like everyone else without even taking a look at it and they would say the same thing to any other religion because really it's just been spun to be some kind of a business for the pastor to get up and say you know what God's given me a revelation that I need to go out and buy a jet I need a Gulf Stream I need a golf stream six and God told me to get it because I can't fly in a tube of devils so we're going to take up an offering over the next six months and and we're going to get a jet because that's what God wants that's what people see and it grosses them out or they're on there calling for money just give and God will bless you it's true but they're not interested in seeing people get blessed there's been stories of of of people sending in envelopes with checks and money orders and even cash and what what what happens the reporters go and find all of the notes without the money without the money orders without the checks just dumped in the dumpster in the back thrown out in the garbage but all the money's gone how does that make people feel it grosses people out who could blame those people but you know they've never been given ears to hear they've never been given eyes to see there was never ever a desire in their heart to receive the word like it is in us who is the Holy Ghost I want to say today brothers and sisters if you've got the Holy Ghost then you're actually the representation of the Holy Ghost it makes it pretty heavy but it's true brothers and sisters because he's not interested in dwelling in a building he's not interested in dwelling in a church or or an assembly or a group it's not about that at all it's about having having a consecrated life before the Lord Jesus Christ getting in the spirit is getting in the Holy Ghost getting the Holy Ghost in us who is the Holy Ghost we're going to study from what is the Holy Ghost today though from 1958 it's message 1216 Lord willing will move on and we'll study from what was the Holy Ghost given for I I think that there's some really important lessons in here really significant things because you know brother Bram says it over and over again he says it in here in this message without the Holy Ghost it ain't going to matter what we do our works mean nothing our works will not get us in a Rapture our works will get us in a graveyard the Holy Ghost will get us out of that graveyard the Holy Ghost will get us in the Rapture so I just think it's really important for us to just stop and take a look at this you know many times we want to talk about the Mysteries and the seals and and the great healings and discern ments and how revelated we are in the message of the hour you know I I heard someone say it recently and I just thought it was astounding I I'm going to say it For Better or For Worse he said you get around some message Believers and they want to talk about the the quotes and they want to talk about the revelations that are given they want to talk about all of the deep things and the Mysteries and the prophet and all that stuff and it's good stuff but then you say to them what about Jesus Christ and they just sit there and they look at you like who's that brothers and sisters if that's what's going on we've missed the Mark we got to get him to Christ Christ is the one that died for our sins he's our savior amen hallelujah but he's come down in this age and anointed a man's lips just like every other major prophet in the Bible so that he could call himself a bride of his own choosing so we don't want want to worship the man we don't want to be busy focusing on trying to execute algebraic equations when we can't even spell properly so it just it just kind of made me think you know we should go back and talk about some of the ABCs let's talk about the Holy Ghost what about the Holy Ghost got me into it so here we go out of 1959 1216 I actually added one brother Logan I apologize this one is paragraph 12 from the app upon this place it's right at the very beginning brother bradam says upon this place this is Brother bram's heart as he's getting into this as he's opening the service upon this place we wish to approach the subject which I think is the outstanding subject of today and that's not just yesterday brothers and sisters is it I think is the out standing subject of today of the what is the Holy Spirit what is it and now the reason I have taken these subject in line like this you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is that one got me we can't come and expect to receive the Holy Spirit unless we know what it is amen and you cannot receive it if you if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you and then you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings remember we talked about this and I'm going to keep harping on it brothers and sisters brother Bram in in in in the revelation of Jesus Christ I want to make sure that we get that part figured out rock solid as we go forwards with the exposition of the seven Church ages because it's not just a theological study of the message of the hour what the prophet gave us even though it can be interpreted that way brothers and sisters that book is actually directing people to Christ so they can actually understand the historical value of what really took place in the world but you know if we get a great Revelation it's revealed by the spirit sometimes I think it's revealed by a spirit but if it's revealed by the Holy Spirit brothers and sisters it's going to actually be identified in the word amen and that's exactly what the prophet for our day said if it's revealed by the spirit it will be identified in the word and I'd say it today it'll also be identified in the message of the hour and the word amen the word of God the message of the hour as a whole the two actually are one right we won't get into that too far today but the message just points to Christ just points to the word the unfailing body word of Jesus Christ but brothers and sisters if we get a revelation it's going to be revealed by the spirit it's going to be identified by the word and then you want the rubber meets the road it's going to be manifest it's going to actually show the results that it bears by what it manifests and if it's not manifesting something according to the word if it's manifesting something outside of the word it's the wrong Revelation and if it's manifesting something that's outside of the word I guarantee you you're not going to be able to take it back to the word and say God gave me this Revelation I can behave this way it's okay if it's not in the word brothers and sisters it's wrong it's wrong he says if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you and then you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings and this is where it's so treacherous we can have a pastor that would say oh my I've got the Holy Ghost yes sir but I go and do this and I go and do that and I go and do the other thing and those things maybe most of them are completely in line with the word of God except for one thing I say Lord help me brothers and sisters cuz I don't ever want to actually behave that way but if I do I send the wrong message to someone someone's going to say look that's what the Holy Ghost is and how many people have done that how many people have actually been spun as charlatans because that's what they do they misrepresent the word of God and that's why I just go back to what my fundamental teaching was from my pastor when I grew up in the message of the hour he said you have to take it back to the word it's your responsibility to know what the word of God says because if a pastor if an angel or any other creature says anything outside of what's already been said then let them be a cursed but how will you ever know if you don't know the word that's why get the Holy Ghost because he the spirit of Truth Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he will lead you and guide you into all truth and then brothers and sisters when brother Barry or any other minister comes and bring something wrong then you're obligated to go to him not to kick him not to kick him but to say brother this is what I see and this is what the word says it just I'm having trouble lining it up can you help me but you know it's not just with the pastor it's with anyone amen with anyone we need to be our Brother's Keeper in fact we don't just need to be we are our Brother's Keeper we went over that a little while ago brothers and sisters Cain Cain nature says NOP I Ain't My Brother's Keeper my brother it's not my problem I've got enough problems in my life let him figure it out on his own that's not the nature of our daddy amen so if you know what it is and who it's to and what action it brings when it comes then you'll know what you've got when you get it see that would just settle it I think it's so beautiful when I heard these words when I saw that I was like yes amen thank you Lord I love when he gives me a direction to go cuz many times you have to wonder but I just think it's beautiful you know brother bradam he goes on to say talking about the circumcision this is verse eight of Acts chapter 7 the circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost it's a type of the Holy Ghost verse eight of Acts chapter 7 I'll just read it again and he gave him the Covenant of circumcision so Abraham begat Isaac and circumcised him the Eighth Day and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob begat the 12 Patriarchs all of them followed the instruction that was given to Abraham by the Lord Brother Brad I'm reading here this in in this message uh what is the Holy Ghost the circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost and God gave Abraham the circumcision sign after he had accepted God on his promise and walked out into a strange country see it was a sign and all his children and his seed after him should have this sign in their flesh because it was a distinction it was to separate them from all other people's this sign of circumcision that's the natural now brother Bram he steps into the next Realm and he says and that's what God uses today he's not talking about natural now he's going spiritual and that's what God uses today it's the sign of circumcision of the heart the Holy Spirit cutting away all of the old dead flesh getting rid of all of the old man getting rid of all of the old tradition getting rid of all of the old thinking getting rid of all of that so that you can just have a clean pure heart before God it's the sign of circumcision of the heart the holy spirit that makes God's Church a separated Church from all other Creeds faiths and denominations they're in all kinds of denominations but yet they are a separated people isn't that beautiful when you hear them say that you don't want to look at someone in the Alliance Church church and say that you're Canon F prophet of God said there's Believers in every denomination brothers and sisters this is God's program and you know there's the we talked about it the 10 virgins they're all virgins they all had oil they all slept and slumbered they all were together weren't they but only one of them had oil enough oil to see them through and we've said it and said it and said it that's why we keep coming to church so that we can lift our cup and say Lord fill me up not just according to a denominational Creed according to the message of the hour that was delivered by a Vindicated Prophet to this age just like he sent the Vindicated prophets to the people in the other ages amen get back in line with the word of God get back in line with the word of God just repent and get back in line with the word of God and God will bless you and the blessing that we're looking for today brothers and sisters is not only just a provision for our families and a place to worship God but to get a body ch change that's our ultimate goal it's not to get comfy here there are all kinds of denominations but yet they are a separated people you let me talk to a man two minutes I can tell you whether he's received the Holy Ghost or not so can you so can you it separates them it's a Mark it's a sign and the Holy Spirit is a sign remember it's revealed by the spirit revealed by a spirit I trust that it's the spirit is going to be confirmed by the word we can have the revelation we can confirm it by the word everyone can do that that's not exclusive to anyone but can we live the life can it make manifest in our lives do our families see it do they experience it being manifest in our lives does the church body collectively see it manifest in our lives do our co-workers see it manifest in our lives do our bosses see it manifest in our lives do our school Pals see it manifest in our lives you know brothers and sisters I think if there's ever something that we need to do today it's remember the children Amen in our congregation remember the children of Believers around the world in this age that we live in I don't think it's ever been so treacherous I don't think it's ever had so much pressure I don't think it's ever been so demonic where where we don't even have a say for the teachers to be able to be instructing our children that they can have a different gender what kind of a Satan's Eden is this we need to pray for our children and we are our brothers and sisters children's Keepers it's not just us exclusive brothers and sisters our family's perfect we pray for our family what about the other families you know there's many gifts in the body some are Prayer Warriors and some aren't some people have the ability to earn a lot of money and to be able to help people financially some people have the ability to perceive things to see things that other people can't see right there's many gifts in the body right I think it's so beautiful we've been given the ability to have this sign in our lives you know the children of Israel brothers and sisters we studyed with the Book of Joshua when we went over that how the children of Israel they had been delivered out of bondage there was this promise that was given to Abraham and to his seed and this is what we read out of the book of Acts how Abram when his name wasn't even changed to Abraham yet he was Abram and he lived in the land of the Chaldeans and what did he do he heard the voice of God as someone who was a gentile he wasn't even a Jew he wasn't Hebrew he was a gentile but he was called out from his Kindred and God spoke to him and said you know what you're going to be the father of many nations I want you to follow my instruction and we know that he had a journey that he went on he got away from all of his teachings his family his Traditions all of that stuff God called him out away from everything that he was used to and even though when he went he brought his nephew with him God didn't want his nephew to come with him but his nephew came with him anyways and we know that as long as his nephew was with him there was Strife in the camp wasn't there there there was problems there was issues there was politics in the church wasn't there there was all these different things going on and what happened was they had to go their separate ways and we know that Abraham being the the Son of God in his position he knew where he stood God D dealt with him he heard the the voice of God God dwelt with him as a friend what did he say he said you know what lot just go and pick whatever Direction you want to go just pick whatever you want in the L wherever you want to go you can take all of the pastures you can have it all wherever you go we'll just go the opposite direction and we'll be brothers it's okay don't worry about it I know that God's going to look after both of us just pick whatever way you want and we know that lot he couldn't help himself he was attracted to the worldly riches he was attracted to Sodom he was attracted to the nature of things and we know the Bible doesn't say that he ran right down into Sodom and bought a house and actually pitched out his flag put out a shingle and said the mayor is here that's not what happened he pitched his tent toward Sodom brothers and sisters watch what you look at because he looked at Sodom he began to desire it that's he pitched his tent towards Sodom don't pitch your tent towards Sodom pitch it towards [Applause] Christ but he was on his journey Abraham and we know that he went out and as he was on his journey he actually came came to a place where God met him and dwelt with him in the plains of mamry and we know that he had the ability to see God he was able to call him Lord this is all stuff I know we're familiar with but this this man was the the father of many nations and we know this promise that was given to him it was to his seed it wasn't his seed it wasn't all the difference in Allin Nations it was his seed and we know that there is the Hebrew seed there is the Hebrew seed but there's also the Gentile seed there is the natural and there is the spiritual there's the Royal Seed of Abraham which I'm speaking to today I think it's so beautiful brothers and sisters and that's really where we want to get to as the children of Israel they went into bondage according to the scripture according to the Judgment of the Lord they went into bondage hard bondage in Egypt 430 years of bondage then they came out God LED them out he sent them a deliverer because they began to cry and when they began to cry the deliverer came brought them out many signs Miracles and wonders happened in Egypt we're very familiar with that what I want to get to though brothers and sisters there came a day where they went through the camp and they said get ready because the priests the Levites are going to take the word they're going to take that Ark and they're going to cross over Jordan and we know that they did they crossed over Jordan they died out to themselves Crossing Jordan is death it's a type of death and they crossed over from their old selves into their new selves and even though some of their selves wanted to stay back in the old land they were pretty content there and that's the way it's going to be it just is some people are just going to be content with the life they've got and and you know what there's nothing we can do about that we can pray for people and encourage people but keep marching brothers and sisters don't keep your eyes on the people keep your eyes on that Ark because you have to keep at a certain distance in front of you because where we're at today nobody has gone this way before but what happened brothers and sisters what I want to get to what happened when they got to the other side there was many great victories that had to happen wasn't there tremendous victories but God said you know what Joshua things have got a little slack around here things have gotten down just a little bit off the Mark we're not quite living to the bar that I set long ago according to the laws and what I want you to do is go through the camp and circumcise every single male that is not circumcised they have got to get in line with this word if you want go forwards and see success in your life you have to follow the word of God to the letter and if you're not willing to do that you're not going to have success so everyone followed the word of the Lord that day we know that happened they went through and they got circumcised all of them now maybe this is a weird conversation and I don't mean it to be it's the word of God brothers and sisters we're talking about spiritual circumcision here circumcising the heart getting rid of all the traditions and saying this is the way of always done it if that's what you've always done then look what you've got right now because that's all you're going to get if you keep doing that but if you want to look at the Ark of the Lord if you want to pitch your tent towards heaven you will see different results but if you're just content on this side then hey that's fine it's okay there's no pressure we just want to see everyone go brother bradam said I want to take as many people with me as I can don't you amen amen amen they had to follow the word of the Lord they had to brush up on everything that was going on they had to go through their camp and their lives and take inventory they had to get right with God and it's the same thing for us today brothers and sisters I believe he's calling us to a higher walk with him every one of us and as we go forwards as we're willing to take him at his word that's why we gather that's why we come to church so that we can get Washed by the Water of the word amen sometimes our lives get a little cloudy sometimes our lamps get a little smoky on the inside we just need to polish the inside trim our lamps get some oil make sure that flame is burning bright and clear show the world we've got the Holy Ghost someone spits in our face we can just simply say you know what don't worry about it God told him to do that because God wanted to prove that I wouldn't do anything to them I wouldn't retaliate I would be just like Jesus Jesus when the high priest smoked me on the face just like Micaiah was when the high priest SME him on the face the god Prophet hit him in the face and said which way did the spirit of God go now sometimes we need those in our lives that's right because what they do is they prove not just to everyone else but they prove to us did I just do that how could I have behaved that way that's not me I would never do that man that guy would have a fat nose and a and a and a busted eye he might even be spitting out a tooth or something you know what I mean human nature yes we're talking way past human nature brothers and sisters we're not talking circumcision In the Flesh we're talking circumcision in the mind circumcision in the heart circumcision of of the the life of of the Our Lives that we have not having any of the old man alive out of what is the Holy Ghost paragraph 47 I'm going to have to get a little bit hard on this now lay down he says now you legalist Brethren just hold quiet for a little bit see did you notice how long that seal lasts the Seal of the Holy Ghost not till next Revival until next time something goes wrong until the day of your Redemption that's how long you're sealed brothers and sisters as someone who finds himself in this office of a pastor that's my desire is that we could get ourselves into that position where we recognize that we're sealed until the day of our Redemption and that if other people get to that place in their spiritual walk they are sealed until the day of their Redemption we're not up and down in and out all around that's works that's the legalistic Brethren that he said just sit back for a second and let me speak as a dispensational prophet I've got some words for you to hear you know some people might say now brother Barry this is only 1957 or whenever this is it's before the seals so it couldn't be completely anointed I want to say this brothers and sisters if you ever get the Holy Ghost in your life and you go back and you start listening to those old messages you can see very clearly this dispensational Prophet was preaching the same message from the very beginning beginning all the way up to the end there's only a couple things that changed but it wasn't his Doctrine he's preaching the message of the hour right from the very beginning you're sealed until the day of your Redemption when you are redeemed up to be with God that's how long the Holy Spirit seals you not from revival to Revival not from camp meeting to camp meeting not from service to service till your day of redemption amen amen but from eternity to Eternity oh my you are sealed by the Holy Spirit that's what the holy spirit is the Seal of God that he's found you found Grace in his sight and you know brothers and sisters we're going to drill down on this one for a little bit we're going to hit on this for a little bit isn't it beautiful that's what the holy spirit is it's the the Seal of God that he's found you found Grace in his sight when did you find Grace in his sight now we're not talking about sister Grace here we're talking about Grace in general when did you find Grace in his sight brothers and sisters was it when you got saved was it some place when maybe you shouldn't have been before the foundation of the world that's what you found Grace amen that's when he chose you that's when he sealed you there just comes a point in time where we recognize it brothers and sisters and when we recognize it we do exactly what Jesus said when he went to John that day in the river and he said you know it behooves us to fulfill all scripture doesn't it and John says hey man I I'm just a mortal I know who you are I want you to baptize me and he said John no we need to wash the sacrifice has to be washed before it can go up you know the scripture when we recognize who we are brothers and sisters we come subject to this word right now just so quick nothing wants to change in our life we just want to say whatever it is the Lord wants from from out of my life that's what I want to do I just want to do anything that he wants me to do and you know when we get to that place brothers and sisters it gets a bit crazy that's where it gets to be fundamental but I want to say if you've ever gone there you know exactly what I'm talking about if you've never gone there I want to challenge you to go there say Lord what do you want for me in my life what would you change what is the inventory in my life o open up all the cupboard doors open up all the doors Under the Stairs open up all of the hidey spots that we've got go into the safe dig into that safe open that big heavy safe door the place that nobody goes into except for you and then go into that other secret little compartment inside the safe that nobody sees you open nobody take him there and ask him Lord is there anything in here that you want changed in my life because if there is I want you to do it I want you to give me the strength to do it and I know brothers and sisters if you could ever say those words I promise you one thing he's already given you the strength to do it or you would never say those words that's what the holy spirit is it's the Seal of God that he's found you found Grace in his sight and he loves you and he believes you and he put his seal upon you what is a seal anyone why a seal designates or means a finished work amen God has saved you Sanctified you cleaned you up you found cleaned you up found favor with you and sealed you he's finished you're his product until the day of your Redemption a seal is a finished thing remember a servant or two ago we talked about the Box Car how the inspector comes around and Shakes the Box Car opens the door and takes a look inside to see what's going on those are all Goods that have to make it to their destination and they will make it to their destination and if the person who is in charge of that box car at that time doesn't do their job they'll be removed and someone else will be put there because that box car is going to make it to its destination it's going to happen and you know that that inspector can't put his seal on that door until that box car is actually packed properly right once that seal is on it ain't coming off until that box car makes it to its destination and you know spiritually speaking there's no man that can remove that seal there's no devil that can remove that seal I would throw this out there and I maybe I don't know sometimes maybe I wonder but you know you got to go with the anointing I want to say it this way brothers and sisters how many of us could be offended so offended that we would just leave this church any one of us I want to say if that's the case then I wonder if you got that seal yet right because you've been sealed till the day of your Redemption haven't you what could any man do that would stop you from coming to church now I know it's going a bit far you know brothers and sisters we're in an age where we need to go far right cuz no no's ever been here before right right no one has and Satan is doing everything that he can to try and discount the word of God trying to discredit the word of God and he'll take every single tool that he has in his toolbox which are human beings and try and get someone offended try and get him in a flap try and say that this happened or that happened or this didn't and that didn't whatever whatever whatever whatever just to upset people and you know it's Devils it's Devils if we're all sealed until the day of our Redemption then what have we got to worry about what do we have to fuss about brothers and sisters maybe I'm a bit crazy but uhuh leave me alone I like it this way brother bam out of what is the Holy Ghost he says what is the Holy Ghost and as we go forwards I got lots of quotes this morning I'm sure that you will see the theme what is the Holy Ghost is what I typed in what is the Holy Ghost you could go and look for yourself and some of them I didn't bring because I just for time sake I knew it was so many I've got probably 20 and I think I'm three in and I can't believe the time what is the Holy Ghost he says it's a sign we're going to get on that a little later on in another message the sign that Paul spoke of tongues was a sign to Believers or unbelievers now brothers and sisters speaking about that specifically tongues turn with me over to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 I just want to really not rush this I I really want to just take some time and talk about what is the Holy Ghost because many times we can have an idea of what the Holy Ghost is a and what the Holy Ghost should be potentially and what the Holy Ghost was but who is the Holy Ghost remember that's where I want to go with this who is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ Spirit back in the unbeliever because we know that there's spirits but you can't just see a spirit in the air can you can you see a spirit sometimes people see ghosts but we don't just see the Holy Spirit what we see is the spirit inside of a human being that's where the holy Bo Holy Ghost manifests but remember revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word made manifest by the results that it Bears that's exactly out of the exposition of the seven Church ages 1 Corinthians 12:7 but the manifestation of the spirit not just the spirit this is the holy spirit we're talking about the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit amen as we talk about this remember I am the vine ye are the branches and the branches that put forth fruit are the ones that he purges for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues this brothers and sisters is the manifestation of the Holy Ghost in his church it's not just a speaking in tongues it's not just healing right so because you don't speak in tongues doesn't mean you don't have the Holy Ghost in your life because you can't lay hands on someone and see them get healed at your whim doesn't mean you don't have the Holy Ghost in your life you might have the gift of discernment that's right you might have the gift of wisdom you might have the gift of working miracles now let's just pause there for a second this one really was getting me excited when I was thinking about it I I don't think that I'm there but I just couldn't help but think about brothers and sisters sometimes the manifestation of the spoken word takes place doesn't it right did you ever say something and then see it come to pass did you ever wish something for someone and then watch it actually take place and I'm talking good not bad that's the carnal nature that's the old man that's already circumcised he's gone dead don't even go there what I'm talking about is wishing good upon someone and actually seeing something happen some people have the gift of working miracles and that's not just healing maybe it's for someone to actually get a mortgage on a house when they should never get a mortgage they should never be able to qualify to get a mortgage maybe it's for someone to actually immigrate when all of the odds are actually stacked against them maybe it's for someone to have a baby when the doctors say you're just never going to have a baby but you know what when there's the gift of working miracles speak the word brothers and sisters and just watch God back it up is what the prophet said but to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits the word of God says to discern the Spirits by the way try the spirits and see if they're of God how do you know it'll be revealed by the spirit right confirmed by the word and the life that's lived will bear representation of what Spirit it is that actually gave that so we have wisdom knowledge Faith healing Miracles prophecy Discerning of spirits and tongues I think it's a beautiful thing the gifts of the Spirit excuse me we have the ability to see these things in our lives not because we want to show God's not going to clown for nobody this is a very special thing for a very special lady the truly elected bride of Jesus Christ she's going to say I can't do any of this I can't do none of it but he can and as soon as she does that and gets out of the way then he'll say oh my my darling H I'm here for you baby I'm going to get you you speak the word and I'll make it happen because my desire is to make you happy Hallelujah just like it is for a husband on Earth for his wife it's no different we know that in Ephesians Paul said it I speak concerning the husband and the wife but you know what I'm actually speaking a great mystery between Christ and his church so the relationship we have with our wives husbands is a direct reflection I'm going to keep saying this over and over because it's that important it's a direct reflection of our relationship with our heavenly father amen don't think for a second that we can be out of life with our marriage with our lives with our wives and yet be completely revelated and in in perfect standing with God and the Holy Spirit In Our Lives if we think that's the case what's happening is there is a spirit that's revealing things to us but it ain't the right spirit because the right spirit's going to be completely in line with the word of godall doesn't matter how many quotes we know about the message of the hour doesn't matter how well we pray doesn't matter how much we know the scripture Our Lives bear manifestation of the fruits of the spirit and I'm going to say this I'm going to correct myself the fruit of the spirit but doesn't it sound familiar while I was studying this I was thinking doesn't it sound like Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and what charity the Holy Ghost yes kind of similar 1 Peter 1:5 says and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and virtue knowledge and knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity need to make sure that we see these things in our lives brothers and sisters there's a reason for it if we read a little bit further verse 8 says for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of Our Lord Jesus Christ and it's not just about knowledge it's not just about knowing the word of God and knowing the quotes of the message of the hour and knowing having this knowledge in our heads it's about actually having it in our hearts brothers and sisters making that longest journey of Our Lives going the 18 inches down into our very beings what it will do is cause us to live it now as we live it we will see these things and that knowledge is of our Lord Jesus Christ he the spirit of Truth manifesting through our lives verse n says but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins a perfect identification of the legalist right remember brother bradam said he told those guys just hold on a second just take a seat and just relax we're going to talk about this for a little bit the the Holy Ghost but sometimes we can get so caught up in how good we are we forget about our old sins goodness sakes but for the grace of God brothers and sisters there go I we'd be right out there with those rank Sinners or we'd be right up there with those religious ones right you know what we want to do is be right down the middle we want to have that Holy Ghost living out through us and he's not going to say anything out of turn with the word of God but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure we say that many times we need to give diligence to make our calling election sure why for if you do these things ye shall never fall why because you're sealed you're sealed brothers and sisters by the Holy Spirit of Promise he does the work he seals us he's the one that takes us from our old life our old sins our old transgressions and brings us into the congregation of the firstborn but our lives speak it brothers and sisters we've said it I'm going to keep saying it it's got to be revealed by the spirit it's got to be confirmed by the word but it's got to be manifest by the results that it bears and you know there's something wrong if it can't manifest according to the first two if it's manifesting something that's different than those then we just need to get back to Calvary we just need to get back to Christ maybe we've just forgotten that we had old sins sometimes it happens sometimes we get an illness sometimes we'll say something about someone sometimes we'll start to look at someone a certain way sometimes we'll just start to act a certain way alls we need to do is just conduct ourselves according to the word of God Amen Our Lives speak volumes brothers and sisters we can say all we want but the life that we live says it all you know he goes on in uh in our scripture this morning out of Acts chapter 7 if we still have a few minutes left we'll probably come back to this in time I I don't know we'll see in Acts 7 if you go jump down brother Bram does this in this message he jumps down to to verse 51 but I just want to go back a little bit to verse 48 just to set the background this is Peter's sory this is Steven's sermon that he gives to the Pharisees and the Sadducees to Saul of Tarsus to everyone who is there he just hammers out this sermon he lays it down right from the beginning to where he's at you know in verse 48 it says how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will ye build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest you know brothers and sisters we are talking about our rest our Sabbath day we've got a rest but are we giving him a place of rest in our lives are we cleaning out all the trash and saying no as the dove the Heavenly Dove you don't have to continue flying and and hovering and looking for a place to land you can come down here and actually land right here where you want to be in this heart you can actually take your rest in your resting place the place the house that I have chosen to build for you once I recognized that I found Grace in your sight before the foundation of the world I want to clean out all the trash I want to get in line with your word I don't want to mess around anymore I want to push out all the nonsense in my life and I just want to give you the preeminence but you know he says hath not my hand made all these things verse 51 ye stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so did ye I want to say Lord help me I don't want to resist you now brothers and sisters I'm just going to talk plainly here I know he leads me I know he speaks to my heart he speaks to my mind and many times I want to say no I want to do it this way he says all right go ahead see how that works for you he doesn't zap me with lightning but what happens is you wind up in a prickly situation and you come right back to him and you say Lord I know you spoke to me forgive me Lord let me get back in line with your word don't resist the Holy Ghost but how do they resist how do the people resist I want to quote from the exposition of the seven Church ages I love how this all goes together brothers and sisters the revelation of Jesus Christ recognizing who he truly is who the Holy Ghost is that's the revelation of Jesus Christ he is our Jesus Christ today the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ today alive and well in the people who actually create a house for him but how do they resist him brother bramy says this in the exposition of the seven Church ages this one's for free brother Logan don't worry about trying to find it he says he's coming he's coming in clouds Clouds Of Glory as when he was seen upon the Mount of transfiguration and his garments were shining as the power of God enfolded him and every eye shall see him that means this is not the Rapture this is when he comes to take over his rightful place as World ruler and we know this is Revelations chapter 19 and we'll all be coming back with him this is when those who have pierced him with their Creeds and denominational doctrines shall mourn it's not just the Jews it's not just the ones that he says you they ask him you know friend how did you get those those scars and he says I got at the house of my friends that's not what's going to be it's going to be everyone that chose not to accept the message of the hour in their day out of every single age not just this age but every age the ones that said no no no no no I I've done it this way my whole entire life I've been in the message of the hour for decades and what are you going to tell me I'm only going to tell you what the prophet of God said and we have the opportunity to accept that and say Amen to it or we can say nope I'm just going to take what I've always done because I've got what I've always got I'm just going to do that because I know it's safe if we do that brothers and sisters and God's calling us to go further then what's going to happen is we're going to be piercing him with our Creeds our den ination I remember brother Ken saying it over and over again we can have a denomination of one I can have my own values in my own belief system I I could even take out a book and I could write out all the things that I believe and why I believe them and I can just read it every single day and say this is what I believe and that's good to do I remember brother Ken saying we should do that write out 10 things of what you believe but then take them back to the word and prove that they line up with the word and if they don't line up with the word get rid of it take it out of there amen this is when he comes to take over his rightful place as World ruler this is when those who have pierced him with their Creeds and denominational doctrines shall mourn and all the people shall wail in Terror because of him who is the word and remember the the five unwise virgins they went out to try and find oil they came knock on the doors of the wise virgin saying come on give us some oil man this is important this is really important like really really really important the bridegroom is actually here now come on man share some oil with us and what did the the wise virgins say they said hey look we can't give you the oil that we've got we've only got enough for ourselves you got to go and do what you got to go buy your own you got to go get your own go tithe to some of those Ministries that say Hey just name it and claim it send your money in and God will bless you go get your own oil and what did they do they came back and they knocked on the door no doubt they had some prayer meetings they had some tears they had some some wailing and nashing of teeth saying Lord open the door to us and what did he say to them you know what it's too late the bridegrooms come he warned you Prophet after Prophet preacher after preacher message after message you heard it you heard it you heard it but you still chose to resist it because of your place of comfort now the door is closed closed remember brother bradam was asked the question what are they going to preach after the Rapture what are they going to preach after the Rapture I find this just so fascinating he said the very same thing they preach all the way along they'll just keep preaching it they'll keep seeing people get baptized they'll think they're getting saved and the Rapture will done already be gone we don't want to be there seeing that brothers and sisters that's why I can only say get into Christ understand who the Holy Ghost is understand that's the seal that we need understand that's the only thing that we need in our lives and he the spirit of Truth when he comes into our lives he'll lead us and guide us through every single thing that we need he'll lead us and guide us in finances if we're willing to lay them open before him he'll lead us and guide us in relationships if we're willing to lead them out in front of him and say Lord help me with it he'll lead us and guide us in our education if we're looking for a job posting somewhere he'll lead us and guide us in all of that if we're looking to buy a house he'll lead us and guide us into all of that if we're looking to find a church where we can be fed he'll lead us and guide us into all that he'll lead us and guide us wherever we allow him to but he's a gentleman he's just going to stand back and say you know whatever you want honey whenever you say the word I'll actually be there to back it up but I'm not going to come and usurp Authority and just drag you through the non hole sideways that's not going to happen you have to be the one to be willing to surrender unto me you have to be willing to be submissive unto me that's why it's so incredible when we look at husbands that would just say she should submit to me because that's what the word of God says but where is his relationship to God is he submitted to God is he surrendered to God no I'll tell you right now he's not because if he was he wouldn't behave that way to his bride because that's not how God behaves to his bride so how could a human being a man a mere mortal think that he could behave that way to his bride to his Queen to his princess it doesn't add up does it it's just another spirit it's a denominational Creed it's a dog it's something we've learned somewhere along the way that gives us the liberty to behave to misbehave actually because it's not behaving what is the Holy Ghost that's what the holy spirit is we're only going to get this quote I think and then we'll uh probably have to wind it up here he says that's what the holy spirit is it's your Assurance it's your Assurance brothers and sisters that's what the Holy Ghost is when we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when we're sealed in when that box car of our life has been shaken and rattled and all the loose places filled unpacked and repacked and everything in our life has gone through and we've asked the Lord what can I do to make my life solid for you he becomes our Assurance it's your protection it's your witness it's your seal remember until the Rapture happens Satan has access to the throne of God and what does he do he goes and he accuses is the Brethren and you're the Brethren he says do you know what that brother did to the Lord do you know what that brother said do you know what that brother thought and who knows maybe there's a giant Jumbotron they call him video walls now and it'll just be the words that's what brother Barry thought nobody else knows it but now you do father do you know that that's what he thought do you know that's what he done did you you see he's the accuser of the Brethren but there's coming a day where he ain't going to be able to do a thing and as Sons and Daughters of the most high God even though we do things we have an attorney we have an attorney there saying yes but look at this Blood this blood stain here it represents the protection it represents the Assurance it represents my life that was given for him and you know the beautiful thing brothers and sisters this is where it's just not fair really when we get this Revelation it's just not fair our attorney is our judge I'd say there's a major conflict of interest there but you know what there's no way that you can ever be accused if you have the Holy Spirit the accuser of the Brethren is going to try all he wants but he's going to say NOP there's a blood stain nope nope NOP no no no there's a bumper of blood and I've already covered it all so just move on talk about someone else that's why brothers and sisters we need to be that vigilant for one another when someone comes around and starts wanting to talk trash about someone else if it's the spirit of Christ he's going to say nope there's actually blood covering that brother amen there's actually blood covering that sister I don't even want to hear it that's an accuser of the Brethren just move along because that same blood stain for them is there for me and I recognize that and I'm not willing to entertain that garbage amen the accuser of the Brethren when he can't get attention in heaven he's going to come to Earth and see if he can actually work up the brothers and the sisters and we know the legalist ones they're the ones that will say oh really wow I would never have done that really what's your seal he says it's your witness it's your seal it's your sign that I'm heavenbound don't care what the devil says I'm heavenbound why he sealed me amen he sealed me I can't seal myself and I can't seal you and that's why there's preachers that's why there's a five-fold Ministry we're saying get in the boat right now while there's time brothers and sisters get the Seal of Christ in your life I I I'm sorry I'll call the musicians I feel like we're just getting about halfway into this message today the devil says it but you know what I'm heavenbound why he he sealed me he gave it to me he sealed me into his kingdom and I'm glorybound are you glory bound today he says let the winds blow let Satan do what he wants to God has done sealed me till the day of my Redemption amen amen that's what the Holy Ghost is oh you should want it brothers and sisters you should want it I couldn't go on without it so much could be said there but I'm sure you know what I'm speaking of I'll ask you to stand with me today as we close I feel like if we go further it'll be a lot longer I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters let's take a look at the Holy Ghost and see what the Holy Ghost is and I think in time we'll look at what the Holy Ghost isn't as well because you know there is a religious spirit and that religious spirit loves to go to church that religious spirit loves to go to church with with the message Believers but you know what it's not our job to do the cleansing amen it's his job to do the cleansing and I'll be honest with you 100% transparent honest that's the reason why brother Barry keeps preaching the Holy Ghost because those religious ones they can't stand it but the Believers say Amen to it because they know that's the only way we're going to get out of here maybe it sounds Elementary but I want to say this brothers and sisters if we want to God in our midst then let's get our ABCs down pat you know children they do flash cards they learn the flash cards 2 * 2 2 * 4 2 * 6 2 * 8 on and on and on and on and they need to be able to answer them we need to be that way with the word of God that's our flash card when we can get that way with the word of God the message of the hour you know what's going to happen we're going to have it we're going to be ready we're not going to be needing to be trained we're going to have our ABCs down we're going to understand and the fundamentals and once we do brothers and sisters we'll see God move in our midst but we want to put him first we want to put him in the highest most prominent place in our church the highest most prominent place in our lives in our homes in our families in our marriages and our relationships if we do that brothers and sisters you will see signs and wonders trailing you all the way along and the whole world's going to say what's that God's name that you serve because something's different about you than anybody else that I've ever met in my life you should want it brothers and sisters I know I want it let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just love you and we thank you for your goodness and your mercy we are so thankful Lord that we can say that we found Grace in your sight Lord Jesus before the foundation of the world father we just are so thankful for what you've done for us and what you're doing even right now Lord if there's anybody here that questions whether they've got your home Holy Spirit or not in their lives father I just want to pray for them right now because I know that even right now in this very moment you're here in this building and you have the ability to impart yourself to that person if they really want you than Jes so father I pray that you would grant that that opportunity for those people who have taken the desire and and Lord recognized it in their heart that that promise is unto you and to your children and to as many as a far off even as many as the Lord Our God should call we have the AB ility to receive this free gift from you oh Lord there's no greater gift than to receive that holy spirit because that seals us until the day of our Redemption we heard it today oh Lord that gives us the assurance that gives us the protection it gives us the witness before your very Throne Lord Jesus that we're not our own father we're so thankful for your goodness and your mercy that you're our attorney and you're our judge that you're the author and the finisher of our faith Lord Jesus father we pray that if we have a offended anyone Lord that you would forgive us for it that you would just allow us Lord Jesus to make it right if we need to if we have ought Lord help us to follow your word amen hallelujah Lord we'll be careful to give you all the praise when we're done father we just ask now that you would go with us as we go our separate ways bring those away father home safely at the appointed time we pray we love you and we thank you and we pray that you would just Lord allow us to to build you the house that you desire help us to keep your house as your housewife not begrudgingly but out of love we love you and we thank you we just commit each life now into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen can we sing the great
