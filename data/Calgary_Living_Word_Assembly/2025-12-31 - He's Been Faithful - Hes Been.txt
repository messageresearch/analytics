Description:
In my moments of fear
Through every pain, every tear
There's a God who's been faithful to me
When my strength was all gone
When my heart had no song
Still in love He's proved faithful to me
Every word He's promised is true
What I thought was impossible
I see my God do

Chorus
He's been faithful, faithful to me
Looking back His love and mercy I see
Though in my heart I have questioned
Even failed to believe
Yet He's been faithful, faithful to me

When my heart looked away
The many times I could not pray
Still my God He was faithful to me
The days I spent so selfishly
Reaching out for what pleased me
Even then He's been faithful to me
Every time I come back to Him
He is waiting with open arms 
And I see once again
