[40:36] desire is so much for my family for my
[40:39] children and um you folks know because I
[40:43] have sent out a message on the assembly
[40:45] WhatsApp and um my my daughter my
[40:49] youngest daughter for the second time
[40:50] this week she said I want to go with you
[40:52] to church mom and you know she she will
[40:55] be here one day and um before I forget
[40:59] sister tell I want to say thank you for
[41:01] to you for coming up here and giving
[41:03] testimony and singing your songs for
[41:05] showing me that example and um coming
[41:10] back to what I was saying my my
[41:12] granddaughter um she took a an interest
[41:16] finding out about the nativity scene she
[41:17] took an interest and was wanting to
[41:19] learn more about Jesus I wanted to
[41:21] respectfully ask my middle daughter for
[41:24] permission to talk with her
[41:26] um and to bring her to church she wants
[41:28] to come to church too she's six years
[41:30] old and so um I respectfully asked and
[41:34] um and I also said can I share Bible
[41:37] stories and can I share children's
[41:39] songs because many in my family are
[41:42] probably somewhat close to being atheist
[41:44] in their beliefs and so um I
[41:47] respectfully asked and I was declined I
[41:50] found that out this morning all week
[41:52] long there was silence and and I didn't
[41:55] have opportunity to speak to them in
[41:57] person at the time that I was last with
[41:59] them and so I just sent a text and there
[42:01] was silence all week long there was no
[42:03] answer this morning that answer came and
[42:05] it was no and so a comfort came over me
[42:10] and I've been in this church and I
[42:12] witnessed his sister up front here who
[42:14] used to come through the side door with
[42:16] her walker and now she came with her son
[42:19] and he was baptized in this church and I
[42:22] claimed them that that day that that
[42:25] strength came into me and witnessing
[42:28] that sister had that experience and I
[42:30] know for me you know I was brought up in
[42:33] in this Faith as a Believer my father
[42:35] was an evangelist some of you know that
[42:38] and for 35 years I I set it all aside
[42:42] and that desire came back to me from God
[42:45] because for 35 years I knew he existed
[42:48] but you know he was he was just there
[42:51] and when I began to read my Bible it
[42:54] really touched me and that desire came
[42:57] back and it's you know it was
[42:59] non-existent for 35 years so
[43:03] um I just felt that this morning he
[43:06] touched
[43:07] me because I was given this strength in
[43:10] in my being that it didn't tear me up to
[43:14] hear my daughter say no because I know
[43:17] I've claimed her and like my mother
[43:19] claimed me and applied the token over me
[43:22] before she passed away and here I stand
[43:25] that my children will be here all of
[43:28] them will be here everyone in my family
[43:30] will be here and so I just was just so
[43:35] at peace and I was able to answer back
[43:37] and say that's okay it's okay cuz I have
[43:41] a peace and knowing that my God is
[43:43] behind me and he is with them and that's
[43:46] just amazing that I would be here to say
[43:48] this to you folks 35 something years
[43:51] later you know my mom had passed when I
[43:54] was about 9 or 10 and she applied that
[43:56] token over me before she passed and here
[43:58] I am so Hallelujah I just wanted to
[44:01] share that story with you and you know
[44:03] brother dawn is what he said why cry I
[44:06] anybody around me has seen me crying
[44:08] every time I'm in church singing I think
[44:10] there's a variety of reasons I don't
[44:12] know why I probably won't make it
[44:13] through this song without crying so
[44:14] please help me out too but um yeah this
[44:19] is not a gift that I have to sing but we
[44:23] grew up singing in church my sister was
[44:26] always the one who could sing and play
[44:27] the piano and be musical but I'm just
[44:29] going to give it a little try cuz Dad
[44:31] used to make me come up front and and
[44:33] sing so um I'm don't know what
[44:38] uh What uh key I sing and but I know the
[44:41] musicians will help me figure that out
[44:43] and I think I'll start with the
[44:46] course and um yeah thanks for having the
[44:50] music up on the prompter so he touched

[1:03:02] Hebrews chapter

[1:03:17] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:03:21] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:03:24] and the sin which doth so easily beset
[1:03:29] us and let us run with patience the race
[1:03:33] that is set before
[1:03:35] us looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:03:39] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:03:43] that was set before him endured the
[1:03:45] cross despising the shame and is set
[1:03:48] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:03:52] god let's just bow one more time
[1:03:56] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[1:03:58] you for your goodness we thank you for
[1:04:01] your mercy we thank you Lord Jesus for
[1:04:03] what you're doing even right now in this
[1:04:05] service Lord L and father as our brother
[1:04:09] prayed we don't want an ordinary service
[1:04:11] we want an extraordinary service father
[1:04:14] our desire in
[1:04:15] 2024 Lord Jesus is to go further and
[1:04:19] farther than we ever have before in you
[1:04:22] Lord so as we go for forwards now father
[1:04:25] we pray that you would just have the
[1:04:26] preeminence that you desire Lord father
[1:04:29] we thank you for ministering to the
[1:04:31] minister we pray that you would Minister
[1:04:33] to the hearer father that the minister
[1:04:35] and the hearer could become one that we
[1:04:37] could all just get beside ourselves Lord
[1:04:39] and allow you to minister to us father
[1:04:42] we just commit the rest of this service
[1:04:44] now into your hands For Your Glory in
[1:04:46] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[1:04:50] bless you this morning you may be
[1:04:52] seated Happy New Year to every everyone
[1:04:54] we're certainly thankful for the
[1:04:56] goodness of the lord we did it a little
[1:04:58] bit different this year and we didn't
[1:05:00] have a watch Night Service and I think
[1:05:03] that was all right we were able to have
[1:05:04] some fellowship I personally think it's
[1:05:06] real important to not get too
[1:05:08] comfortable into a set routine and uh
[1:05:11] just to allow the spirit of the Lord to
[1:05:14] have Liberty we can get in a rut and
[1:05:17] have a a bunch of tradition and it can
[1:05:20] just become what we do not what we
[1:05:22] really believe and I just think it's so
[1:05:24] good to take a look at the world from a
[1:05:27] few different angles and you know this
[1:05:29] year coming up I'm not saying we won't
[1:05:31] have a a watch Night Service we might
[1:05:33] we'll just see what the Lord wants maybe
[1:05:35] we won't even get to New Year's Lord
[1:05:37] willing and we'll just have a
[1:05:39] resurrection and Rapture all that all of
[1:05:42] the Saints had ever looked towards we
[1:05:44] might actually see someone's going to be
[1:05:46] alive on Earth to actually witness that
[1:05:48] to actually be the literal manifestation
[1:05:52] of that body change brothers and sisters
[1:05:54] someone is going to do that why not
[1:05:58] you just a couple of announcements this
[1:06:00] morning we've got prayer meetings coming
[1:06:02] up this month this uh Thursday the 11th
[1:06:05] and the 25th is a Thursday also at 7:30
[1:06:09] p.m. here at the church we've got the
[1:06:11] youth meeting I believe on the 21st
[1:06:13] we're going to have a communion service
[1:06:15] on the
[1:06:16] 28th as well if you have any questions
[1:06:18] by all means reach out uh you could see
[1:06:20] these I think reflected on our website
[1:06:22] as well on the calendar potion portion
[1:06:24] so um if you have any questions just let
[1:06:27] us know as uh mentioned as well on the
[1:06:29] group chat there is the food delivery
[1:06:32] downstairs and uh what a tremendous
[1:06:35] blessing that is proving to be and you
[1:06:38] know I just would like to be real clear
[1:06:40] I'm definitely a part of it but
[1:06:43] vicariously I I I would like to say that
[1:06:46] I I've done lots for it and and to make
[1:06:49] it happen and I've helped out I would
[1:06:50] say a little bit but you know what it is
[1:06:53] it's my wife
[1:06:55] and I I I think
[1:06:56] [Applause]
[1:07:01] that I just want to mention that she's
[1:07:04] the one that's been driving this we
[1:07:06] found out that we could get this food
[1:07:08] for animals and and you know some of the
[1:07:11] locations the food isn't really good and
[1:07:14] it's just fit for animal consumption but
[1:07:17] here we found that we can actually get
[1:07:19] some that is actually available for
[1:07:21] human consumption that that the store
[1:07:24] actually gives away so that people can
[1:07:26] eat it and they encourage that and if
[1:07:28] you're a charity uh you're able to
[1:07:31] actually participate in that so as soon
[1:07:34] as we heard that um my wife if you've
[1:07:37] ever seen what she does she gets after
[1:07:39] something she she kept asking until she
[1:07:42] was able to get that one particular
[1:07:44] store where it's all it is is human
[1:07:47] consumption food and there's stuff in
[1:07:49] there that's not really good but for the
[1:07:50] most part it's going to be something
[1:07:52] that will be for a blessing to the body
[1:07:55] and you know I I I've had people mention
[1:07:57] that you know maybe your wife should be
[1:07:59] quiet and she shouldn't say anything but
[1:08:01] I I just want to say this brothers and
[1:08:02] sisters if you've ever read proverbs 31
[1:08:05] it talks about a woman that is up and
[1:08:07] doing not just a a quet subservient
[1:08:10] doormat of a wife someone that's
[1:08:12] actually involved actively looking after
[1:08:15] her family and the community around and
[1:08:18] you know I I find myself saying this and
[1:08:20] people might be saying brother Barry
[1:08:21] you're really going off about your wife
[1:08:23] but I want tell you brothers and sisters
[1:08:25] that's the greatest thing outside of my
[1:08:27] salvation that God could have gave me
[1:08:28] sitting right here so I am going to
[1:08:31] brag I think we have the opportunity to
[1:08:34] if God's ever given you a good wife you
[1:08:36] could say the same
[1:08:38] thing you know
[1:08:40] it so I'd like to take some credit for
[1:08:43] it but all the credit goes to my wife
[1:08:45] and God brothers and sisters if you have
[1:08:48] any questions by all means reach out I'm
[1:08:50] pretty involved with it but I mean she's
[1:08:53] the one that's been been doing it I I
[1:08:54] lend her my truck and she goes to get it
[1:08:56] and then she brings it to the church or
[1:08:58] she brings it back home again so um
[1:09:00] We're In It
[1:09:02] Together Hallelujah God bless you honey
[1:09:05] I love
[1:09:06] you I want to spend a little bit of time
[1:09:09] brothers and sisters talking about
[1:09:11] leadership as we head into
[1:09:14] 2024 you know uh I believe with all my
[1:09:18] heart that in order for us to be
[1:09:20] successful in our Christian walk we have
[1:09:22] got to have leadership in our
[1:09:24] lives and you know we can look at
[1:09:26] leadership from so many different
[1:09:28] aspects so many different ways um I want
[1:09:31] to look at leadership for us I I I'd
[1:09:34] like to look at leadership with us maybe
[1:09:36] from a Grace
[1:09:37] perspective instead of a legalistic
[1:09:40] perspective and I think sometimes they
[1:09:42] can be a little bit confused and even in
[1:09:45] and around the message of the hour some
[1:09:47] folks will say that you know because of
[1:09:49] my good works I've got strong leadership
[1:09:51] and that's true that's true
[1:09:54] but do you have Grace because sometimes
[1:09:57] when you see people starched out with
[1:09:59] their good works they don't have a lot
[1:10:01] of Grace and they're pretty eager to
[1:10:03] point fingers at people and say look at
[1:10:05] this about that and that about the other
[1:10:08] and you know what that's not
[1:10:09] leadership that's
[1:10:12] dictatorship we're not into dictatorship
[1:10:14] we're not into communism from the pulpit
[1:10:17] we're not into any of that what we're
[1:10:18] into is Grace the grace of God and you
[1:10:22] know what if we've ever experienced the
[1:10:23] grace of God in our lives truly there
[1:10:25] ain't no room for legalism legalism gets
[1:10:29] nowhere in our lives in fact the more
[1:10:31] revelated we become in our lives the
[1:10:34] more humble we become in our Christian
[1:10:36] walk because we recognize there's
[1:10:38] nothing we ever
[1:10:42] did but you know if you read just a
[1:10:45] little further back in Hebrew in uh not
[1:10:47] Hebrews in uh Proverbs it talks about
[1:10:51] the man that's puffed up vainly it talks
[1:10:53] about the hottie Spirit there's
[1:10:56] discussion about what happens before the
[1:10:58] fall of a man and and you know we can
[1:11:01] see it with our eyes we don't have to
[1:11:03] preach it but we have discernment in our
[1:11:05] lives and and we can see people that
[1:11:08] maybe just aren't as revelated as they
[1:11:09] would like to claim they are and you
[1:11:11] know as we go forwards in 2024 brothers
[1:11:13] and sisters I want to encourage us to
[1:11:15] get into Christ I'll say it every single
[1:11:17] service when you get into Christ you
[1:11:19] will have a different walk you'll have a
[1:11:22] different perception a different
[1:11:24] Persona in your life you know many times
[1:11:27] people get into the new year going into
[1:11:29] the new year they'll set new goals and
[1:11:31] they'll have many natural aspects to set
[1:11:34] the goals for and and it's very
[1:11:36] important to do that I would agree to
[1:11:38] that it it's a good thing to do set
[1:11:40] goals set targets set yourself a a a
[1:11:43] direction chart your course but don't
[1:11:46] make that more than your spiritual
[1:11:49] walk I would say set some spiritual
[1:11:51] goals first brothers and sisters
[1:11:54] set the spiritual goals first let that
[1:11:57] be what actually dictates your future
[1:11:59] the way that you go when I talk about
[1:12:02] leadership going into 2024 I I just felt
[1:12:05] so incredibly led to go down the road of
[1:12:07] leadership not just leadership in
[1:12:09] general as a broad statement there's
[1:12:11] many different aspects or or directions
[1:12:13] you can go with that but what I want to
[1:12:15] talk about is Direction in the family
[1:12:17] leadership in the family because
[1:12:19] leadership in the family is either going
[1:12:21] to make the family or it's going to
[1:12:23] break the family because that leadership
[1:12:25] is inherently there whether people want
[1:12:27] to accept it or whether they don't want
[1:12:29] to accept it the whole family looks to
[1:12:31] Daddy and if Daddy is absent in the
[1:12:34] family guess what the family is going to
[1:12:37] be led somehow is it going to be the
[1:12:39] children that just take control and say
[1:12:41] Mommy we want to do this and Mommy can't
[1:12:43] contain because she's just a single mom
[1:12:45] dad's busy doing his own thing he's not
[1:12:47] paying attention to what the children
[1:12:48] are doing there becomes a power vacuum
[1:12:51] and when that happens something's going
[1:12:53] to fill it right there's leadership
[1:12:56] always it's always there so who's going
[1:12:58] to lead is it going to be the children I
[1:13:00] remember brother Ken those people who
[1:13:02] were here back when brother Ken was
[1:13:03] ministering he said this world is set up
[1:13:06] exactly opposite of the way it was
[1:13:08] intended by God from the very beginning
[1:13:11] where it is God and then it is man and
[1:13:13] then it is wife and then it's children
[1:13:16] the world has flipped it upside down
[1:13:18] completely put the children at the top
[1:13:21] put the mom next put the dead and then
[1:13:25] Christ at the very
[1:13:27] bottom that's not the way it is in
[1:13:29] amongst the Christian Church though I'm
[1:13:31] not saying that I'm just saying in
[1:13:32] comparison to this world that's what
[1:13:34] we're up against the whole entire world
[1:13:37] is structured to per per to promote that
[1:13:40] kind of behavior and what a terrible
[1:13:42] thing that is so as we go forwards I
[1:13:45] just want to say let's set spiritual
[1:13:46] goals brothers and sisters about having
[1:13:48] leadership in our family and not just
[1:13:50] leadership to set goals and and do the
[1:13:52] natural thing and and exercise the the
[1:13:54] natural laws call it the natural laws of
[1:13:56] the Bible you can tithe and you'll be
[1:13:59] rewarded for it you can be a good
[1:14:00] citizen and shovel your neighbor's
[1:14:02] sidewalk and you'll be acknowledged and
[1:14:04] rewarded for it God's watching every
[1:14:06] single thing we do and you will see a
[1:14:08] blessing for those things brothers and
[1:14:09] sisters but what about actually coming
[1:14:12] to the place where we can say I am my
[1:14:13] father are
[1:14:14] one because when we get to that place
[1:14:17] we're going to live ourselves a
[1:14:18] different life and the people who are
[1:14:20] the closest to us are going to say you
[1:14:22] know what you're not just preaching it
[1:14:23] you're actually living it wow what's
[1:14:26] going on who are you and what have you
[1:14:28] done with my spouse or what have you
[1:14:30] done with my parents what's going on
[1:14:31] something's different in your life and
[1:14:34] what you'll be able to say is yeah just
[1:14:35] like we sang in that song we're so glad
[1:14:37] that we trusted in Jesus he's able to
[1:14:39] now sit down on the throne room of my
[1:14:41] heart and actually live his life through
[1:14:44] me and once in a while I have to preach
[1:14:46] and say yeah I believe the word of
[1:14:49] God what if we set goals brothers and
[1:14:52] sisters about about spiritual things yes
[1:14:55] amen about simply saying I'm going to
[1:14:57] actually spend a little bit more time in
[1:14:59] the word I I'm actually going to listen
[1:15:01] a little bit more to the message I I'm
[1:15:03] going to attend church just a little bit
[1:15:05] more I I'm going to actually maybe go to
[1:15:08] prayer meetings once in a while I I'm
[1:15:10] actually going to go to communion
[1:15:12] service and I'm not going to let
[1:15:13] anything stand in the way you know the
[1:15:15] devil just loves to keep us from
[1:15:17] communion service to say oh you've got
[1:15:19] this thing in your heart you better not
[1:15:20] go up there you're going to eat and
[1:15:21] drink damnation to yourself you're going
[1:15:22] to eat and drink dation to yourself if
[1:15:24] you don't go as Believers we have got to
[1:15:28] follow the word of God it's an ordinance
[1:15:30] to
[1:15:32] do and to be able to Humble ourselves
[1:15:34] one to another and wash our brother or
[1:15:36] sister's feet oh my goodness
[1:15:38] gracious I would say this we don't have
[1:15:40] a whole lot of Revelation if we're not
[1:15:42] doing that we can say we believe the
[1:15:44] message of the hour but we live it
[1:15:46] that's what shows that we actually
[1:15:48] believe the message of the hour you know
[1:15:51] brothers and sisters I want to take a a
[1:15:53] direction today and I I just felt led to
[1:15:56] go this way I hope it's okay um
[1:15:59] sometimes as a minister as a pastor it
[1:16:01] can feel maybe a little bit weird
[1:16:05] but here we go turn with me this morning
[1:16:08] to Acts chapter 5 amen I want to talk
[1:16:12] about leadership in the
[1:16:14] family our leadership in the family how
[1:16:17] important it is as fathers to have the
[1:16:20] right leadership in the family
[1:16:25] Acts chapter 5 we'll start reading with
[1:16:27] verse
[1:16:33] one very familiar
[1:16:43] scripture sorry bear with me one
[1:16:47] second Acts chapter 5 verse
[1:16:50] 1 but a certain man named ananas with
[1:16:54] saf his wife sold a
[1:16:58] possession and kept back part of the
[1:17:01] price his wife also being privy to it
[1:17:05] and brought a certain part and laid it
[1:17:08] at the apostles
[1:17:09] feet I just want to pause there as we've
[1:17:13] set sort of the the the basis for this
[1:17:16] story as we move
[1:17:17] forwards so this man has has come and
[1:17:22] and and done what he was supposed to do
[1:17:23] what everyone was doing this is what was
[1:17:26] commanded for the church in that day
[1:17:28] they were excuse me they were communing
[1:17:30] together as one they were in one mind
[1:17:33] and one Accord and we know many people
[1:17:35] have tried to replicate this feeling
[1:17:36] like maybe they can get some good works
[1:17:38] under their belts and you know God will
[1:17:40] bless them and he will to an extent but
[1:17:42] the human can't exist this way it's not
[1:17:45] intended to be this way it's supposed to
[1:17:47] be families living together but the
[1:17:49] reason they were doing this bringing
[1:17:51] their stuff was because they were
[1:17:53] instructed to in Acts chapter 4 and if
[1:17:55] you want to read the story later I would
[1:17:57] recommend it just for the backstory
[1:18:00] verse three of Acts chapter 5 but Peter
[1:18:03] said
[1:18:05] ananas why hath Satan filled nine filled
[1:18:08] thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and
[1:18:11] to keep back part of the price of the
[1:18:14] land now remember he came and actually
[1:18:17] brought it he was doing what he was
[1:18:19] supposed to do but it wasn't that action
[1:18:22] it was what was in his heart part about
[1:18:23] it wasn't it verse four whils it
[1:18:26] remained was it not thine own and after
[1:18:29] it was sold was it not in thine own
[1:18:32] power why hast thou conceived this thing
[1:18:35] in thine heart thou Hast not lied unto
[1:18:38] men but unto
[1:18:40] God and ananas hearing these words fell
[1:18:43] down and gave up The Ghost and great
[1:18:45] fear came on all them that heard these
[1:18:49] things now I just want to talk about
[1:18:51] this for a couple minutes maybe before
[1:18:53] we go further with this story now
[1:18:56] remember he was doing what was supposed
[1:18:58] to happen he was given the instruction
[1:19:00] they were given the instruction by the
[1:19:01] Holy Ghost and and they were following
[1:19:04] it but you know isn't it interesting
[1:19:06] that Peter would say to him why have
[1:19:08] you've chosen to let Satan fill your
[1:19:11] heart and and lie to the Holy Ghost
[1:19:13] because was he speaking to the Holy
[1:19:15] Ghost did he go to church and go on his
[1:19:17] knees and have a prayer closet meeting
[1:19:19] and pray unto the Holy Ghost no he was
[1:19:21] just talking to men wasn't he
[1:19:23] but the Apostle said no you lied to the
[1:19:25] Holy Ghost so isn't it interesting that
[1:19:28] you can be talking to people and
[1:19:31] actually who are you talking to brothers
[1:19:33] and
[1:19:34] sisters it's very important for us to
[1:19:36] recognize this as we go forwards very
[1:19:39] important I I just I can't get away from
[1:19:42] this thought how important it really
[1:19:45] is verse 5 and ananas hearing these
[1:19:48] words fell down and gave up The Ghost
[1:19:50] and great fear came on all them that
[1:19:52] heard heard these things and the young
[1:19:55] man arose and wound him up and carried
[1:19:57] him out and buried him it was about the
[1:20:00] space of three hours after when his wife
[1:20:03] not knowing what was done came in and
[1:20:05] Peter answered unto her tell me whether
[1:20:08] ye sold the land for so much and she
[1:20:11] said yay for so
[1:20:13] much again then Peter said to her how is
[1:20:16] it that ye have agreed together to tempt
[1:20:19] the spirit of the Lord
[1:20:24] behold the feet of them which have
[1:20:26] buried thy husband are at the door and
[1:20:28] shall carry thee out then she fell down
[1:20:32] straightway at his feet and yielded up
[1:20:34] The Ghost and the young man came in
[1:20:35] found her dead and carrying her forth
[1:20:37] buried her by her husband and great fear
[1:20:40] Came Upon all the church and upon as
[1:20:43] many as heard these
[1:20:46] things isn't it interesting brothers and
[1:20:48] sisters how they were talking to men
[1:20:51] some people might say brother Barry they
[1:20:53] were talking to Apostles so they're
[1:20:54] great men you know what I want to say is
[1:20:56] if you have the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:20:58] you're no different than those Apostles
[1:20:59] the only thing is they held an office
[1:21:02] that's all some people hold offices some
[1:21:04] people don't spiritually speaking but
[1:21:06] there's no greater office than to be the
[1:21:08] Bride of Jesus Christ is there because
[1:21:11] that's what the apostles were they were
[1:21:13] the Bride of Jesus Christ for their day
[1:21:15] and that's exactly who I would like to
[1:21:17] be addressing this morning and as we go
[1:21:19] forwards in 2024 the Bride of Jesus
[1:21:22] Christ recognize it brothers and sisters
[1:21:24] when you're speaking to your brother
[1:21:26] when you're speaking to your sister who
[1:21:28] are you speaking
[1:21:29] to we need to be
[1:21:32] careful brother Bram talks about it in
[1:21:35] 1965 1212
[1:21:38] communion that's the trouble of us today
[1:21:42] I'll just let Isaac search that up
[1:21:44] that's the trouble of us
[1:21:50] today what I think
[1:21:53] I'm saying us me and the church that the
[1:21:59] Lord God has let me speak to in these
[1:22:01] last hours that we believe we're in the
[1:22:04] closing time do you believe you're in
[1:22:07] the closing time brothers and
[1:22:09] sisters we're in the closing of
[1:22:12] time we believe that God has give us a
[1:22:15] message it's been ordained of God it's
[1:22:19] been proven of God it's been showed of
[1:22:24] God now we must come to him with
[1:22:28] reverence and with love and with purity
[1:22:32] of heart and mind and
[1:22:35] soul because remember brothers and
[1:22:38] sisters when you're talking to your
[1:22:39] brother and your sister and they've got
[1:22:40] the Holy Ghost in their life they might
[1:22:42] not be Discerning your life but I
[1:22:43] promise you the Holy Ghost in them is
[1:22:46] and it's interesting because many times
[1:22:48] we can't understand the feelings that
[1:22:50] we're encountering the things that the
[1:22:52] emotions that are happening in our lives
[1:22:54] as we're conversing with folks but
[1:22:56] sometimes we'll just get funny feelings
[1:22:58] and we'll be like what's going on here
[1:23:00] you know what that is that's the Holy
[1:23:01] Ghost Discerning the word of God is
[1:23:04] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:23:06] two-edged sword brothers and
[1:23:08] sisters it's important that we live with
[1:23:10] purity of heart and mind and
[1:23:14] soul he says you know the hour will soon
[1:23:17] arise when right Among Us will be the
[1:23:20] holy spirit will speak out like it did
[1:23:23] in ananas and
[1:23:25] saf remember see that hour is arriving
[1:23:29] see and we are now you just remember
[1:23:31] that see that God is going to dwell
[1:23:33] among his people that's what he wants to
[1:23:35] do now 1965 how far down the road are we
[1:23:39] brothers and sisters how many years down
[1:23:41] the road is it how much farther are we
[1:23:44] along the road in terms of our Spiritual
[1:23:46] Development are we the same way that we
[1:23:49] would have been back
[1:23:51] there I just want to encourage
[1:23:54] us remember that we need to live with
[1:23:57] purity of Mind heart and soul and so
[1:24:01] when we talk about this as we go
[1:24:02] forwards I don't want to say that I'm
[1:24:04] not here preaching to us saying that you
[1:24:07] know the the hour is going to come that
[1:24:09] the holy spirit will speak out through
[1:24:10] us like ananas and Safa and and people
[1:24:12] will just be dropping dead in the
[1:24:14] service and they'll be carried out by
[1:24:15] the deacons and there'll be a truck
[1:24:17] taking people to the Undertaker that's
[1:24:19] not what I'm talking about what I'm
[1:24:21] talking about is eternal SE
[1:24:23] oparation spiritual death brothers and
[1:24:25] sisters that's what we're encountering
[1:24:27] in this world that we live in and that's
[1:24:29] what's so
[1:24:30] deceptive the devil is roaming like a a
[1:24:33] lion he's going to and fro seeking whom
[1:24:36] he may devour and if we don't have the
[1:24:38] token applied to our homes our families
[1:24:41] with proper Holy Ghost leadership that
[1:24:44] that that Lion's going to get
[1:24:46] in he's going to get in and he's going
[1:24:48] to ravage our
[1:24:50] families brother Bram says that it will
[1:24:53] be just like it did in an an annias and
[1:24:56] saf remember see that hour is arriving
[1:24:59] see remember brothers and sisters that
[1:25:03] hour is arriving paragraph 61 we can
[1:25:05] receive the message as saying if I was a
[1:25:08] young man and hunting for a wife and I
[1:25:10] could find a wife I said she's just
[1:25:12] perfect she's a Christian she's a lady
[1:25:16] she's all this I Got Confidence no
[1:25:19] matter how much confidence how much I
[1:25:21] think she's nice I've got to receive her
[1:25:24] she's got to receive me see upon these
[1:25:28] vows well it's the same thing we find is
[1:25:31] the message
[1:25:32] see I'm just saying see I I want to say
[1:25:35] it because brothers and sisters we have
[1:25:38] got to receive the message and you know
[1:25:40] the world around us we said it I think
[1:25:41] on Wednesday I'm going to say it again
[1:25:42] today the world around us they're going
[1:25:44] to say you're the same person that you
[1:25:46] were you're just a little bit funny
[1:25:47] you're into a cult or something and now
[1:25:49] you're all brainwashed what's going to
[1:25:51] happen is we know as Believers that we
[1:25:53] have the invisible Union of the
[1:25:55] bridegroom the Heavenly bridegroom and
[1:25:58] the Earthly bride of Jesus Christ but
[1:26:00] what needs to happen is the people
[1:26:02] around us who are the closest to us need
[1:26:04] to see that
[1:26:06] Union because if they're Believers
[1:26:08] they'll see that Union don't make that
[1:26:11] Union with the people who are the most
[1:26:13] close to us don't make it an invisible
[1:26:15] Union to them I say that I believe the
[1:26:19] message of the hour but I don't live it
[1:26:20] when I go home or when I go to work or
[1:26:23] when I go to school make it a visible
[1:26:26] Union amongst the
[1:26:28] Believers that's leadership brothers and
[1:26:31] sisters brother Bram says well it's the
[1:26:34] same thing we find is the message we see
[1:26:37] it's right we see God vindicates it's
[1:26:40] right it's perfectly right year after
[1:26:44] year year after year it continues right
[1:26:48] continues right everything it says
[1:26:50] happens just exactly the way way he
[1:26:54] said now the trick of the devil is going
[1:26:57] to say well you know we laid hands on
[1:26:59] the sick and we prayed for them and
[1:27:00] they're still sick or we laid hands on
[1:27:02] the sick and we prayed for them and they
[1:27:04] died but you
[1:27:06] said this is God's will this is God's
[1:27:09] word this is God's way it's going to
[1:27:11] happen exactly the way that he wants it
[1:27:13] to happen brothers and sisters it's up
[1:27:14] to us just to get in line with his word
[1:27:16] and say Amen to his word and just say
[1:27:18] it's up to you Lord however you want it
[1:27:20] done that's how it'll happen
[1:27:24] happen he said now we know it's right
[1:27:27] but see don't do it from an intellectual
[1:27:31] standpoint if you do you got a
[1:27:34] second-handed religion see we don't want
[1:27:37] a second-handed religion something that
[1:27:40] somebody else has experienced it and we
[1:27:42] are living off of their
[1:27:45] testimony now think about it brothers
[1:27:47] and sisters we can get into a situation
[1:27:49] where if we go back to our story this
[1:27:51] morning and just for for the the sake of
[1:27:53] maybe some I'll call it theatrical
[1:27:56] Liberty think about it now this brother
[1:27:58] he might have encountered someone in the
[1:28:00] church who actually was really money
[1:28:03] hungry and and and he might have thought
[1:28:05] that people were actually AIT a
[1:28:08] Scoundrels maybe he got burned really
[1:28:10] bad one time in a business deal with a a
[1:28:12] Believer maybe someone did something to
[1:28:15] his wife or someone close to him and he
[1:28:18] felt ripped off so he was going to do
[1:28:21] things from an inter ual standpoint and
[1:28:23] say of course we're going to come to
[1:28:24] church and and we're going to believe
[1:28:26] the prophet for our day and and we're
[1:28:28] going to give like they said to do but
[1:28:30] we're just going to hold back a little
[1:28:32] bit just a little bit that little
[1:28:34] conversation around the dinner table it
[1:28:36] it's only going to be for us and nobody
[1:28:38] else will know about it it'll be fine no
[1:28:39] one will ever
[1:28:41] know but you know what remember brothers
[1:28:44] and sisters be not deceived God is Not
[1:28:48] mocked whatsoever we sow that that shall
[1:28:52] we also reap so what we're doing with
[1:28:55] ourselves in our spare time we're
[1:28:57] planting seeds brothers and sisters and
[1:28:59] it's going to come to harvest we're not
[1:29:02] going to be able to hide
[1:29:04] it you know if we just live according to
[1:29:06] an intellectual standpoint we're going
[1:29:09] to say that the message of the hour is
[1:29:11] this or the message of the hour is that
[1:29:13] the message of the hour is Christ Jesus
[1:29:15] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:29:18] forever and that same Jesus Christ that
[1:29:20] was there discerning hearts of the
[1:29:22] brothers and sisters in Peter's Day in
[1:29:25] ananas and saf's day is the same Holy
[1:29:28] Ghost that's right here in this building
[1:29:30] right now in the hearts of the
[1:29:33] Believers we got nowhere to hide why
[1:29:36] would we want to hide what do we have to
[1:29:39] hide is there anything to hide if there
[1:29:41] is brothers and sisters get it out get
[1:29:43] it out you don't have to hide
[1:29:47] nothing it'll just lead us astray and I
[1:29:50] just think it's it's it's the most scary
[1:29:52] thing ever because you know as as
[1:29:55] someone who might have a family it's not
[1:29:57] necessarily going to lead us astray
[1:29:58] because we're strong and Resolute in our
[1:30:01] constitution about whatever it is we
[1:30:02] believe if it's a second-handed religion
[1:30:05] and we know that that we've seen the
[1:30:07] message and we've heard it preached and
[1:30:08] and on and on and on but you know what
[1:30:10] it's not going to affect us the devil
[1:30:12] who's going around like a roaring lion
[1:30:14] he loves children that's his favorite
[1:30:17] diet the devil loves to get his hands on
[1:30:20] children and if we're not careful he
[1:30:24] will but isn't it
[1:30:26] wonderful testimony we heard about
[1:30:29] sister
[1:30:31] jarmain sister
[1:30:35] Amber sister Glend brother Cyrus
[1:30:38] dedicate your children unto the Lord
[1:30:40] claim them in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:30:44] and if you've done that Brothers and
[1:30:45] Sisters You've Done all you can take
[1:30:47] them train them up in the way they
[1:30:48] should go that's why we've got to train
[1:30:51] them the right way it's got to be
[1:30:52] according to the word for our day not
[1:30:55] some second-handed religion but if we
[1:30:57] train them up in the way they should go
[1:30:59] that word will not depart from them they
[1:31:00] might go Wayward into the world but
[1:31:02] eventually at the time appointed of the
[1:31:05] father he will put his hand on their
[1:31:07] shoulder and say it's time for you to
[1:31:09] get back to the altar you have got to go
[1:31:12] and actually make it right for you it's
[1:31:13] got to be your religion now it can't be
[1:31:16] your mom's religion it can't be your
[1:31:18] dad's religion it can't be anybody
[1:31:20] else's but your very own and when it
[1:31:23] happens brothers and sisters it's just
[1:31:25] it's just so beautiful there's nothing
[1:31:27] nothing like it but you know brothers
[1:31:30] and sisters when we get into talking
[1:31:32] about things with our mouths be not
[1:31:34] deceived God is Not mocked for who
[1:31:36] whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also
[1:31:38] reap for he that Seth to his flesh shall
[1:31:43] of the flesh reap corruption but he that
[1:31:45] Seth to the spirit of the spirit shall
[1:31:49] sorry he that Seth to the Spirit shall
[1:31:52] of the spirit reap life
[1:31:55] Everlasting I love how it says that in
[1:31:57] verse 8 this is Galatians chap 6 verse 8
[1:32:02] for he that Seth to his flesh shall of
[1:32:05] the flesh reap corruption if we're
[1:32:07] looking at the hinder parts of people
[1:32:10] and we are sewing seeds with our mouth
[1:32:12] remember the spoken word is the Original
[1:32:16] Seed is it not true the words that we
[1:32:20] speak have
[1:32:22] power we were created to speak
[1:32:27] creation that's how we were created to
[1:32:29] have
[1:32:30] children but we know through the fall
[1:32:33] Eve being deceived God said okay you
[1:32:36] want it your way this is how it's going
[1:32:38] to happen you're going to have children
[1:32:40] through Labor through sorrow through
[1:32:43] pain through death that's how you will
[1:32:46] have children but it wasn't so from the
[1:32:49] beginning God intended full well for us
[1:32:51] to speak the word as Messiah s remember
[1:32:55] God was God Of Heaven man was god of
[1:32:57] Earth Man was created to be the god of
[1:33:01] the garden god of the Earth but he that
[1:33:03] Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh
[1:33:06] reap
[1:33:08] corruption I just can't help but think
[1:33:10] about balum and baac we know that story
[1:33:12] very
[1:33:14] well that that that King he wanted to
[1:33:16] get God's Prophet to go and curse the
[1:33:19] children of Israel didn't he he had a
[1:33:21] totally a different agenda and and in
[1:33:24] doing so he couldn't go and curse what
[1:33:26] was blessed and he told the king that
[1:33:28] the prophet told them I can't God told
[1:33:31] me no I can't curse them but what did he
[1:33:34] do he worked on them he said let's look
[1:33:35] at their flesh let's look at their flesh
[1:33:37] let's talk about their flesh let's talk
[1:33:38] about the problems let's have those me
[1:33:40] Meal Time conversations let's go and
[1:33:43] gossip let's go and talk about these
[1:33:44] people and slander their names and
[1:33:46] eventually what's going to happen is
[1:33:48] you're going to blend with them and we
[1:33:49] know that God said that's the one thing
[1:33:51] that I won't do I will not accept that
[1:33:54] moving
[1:33:55] forwards God doesn't like it when we
[1:33:57] gossip brothers and sisters God hates it
[1:34:00] when we talk about our brother and our
[1:34:02] sister and so much so that I believe
[1:34:05] this with all my heart it is possible to
[1:34:08] blaspheme the Holy Ghost speaking about
[1:34:11] a brother or a sister now we're going to
[1:34:13] really dig into this as we go forwards
[1:34:15] but it's really important remember
[1:34:18] ananas and saf just take the money out
[1:34:20] of the equation it he didn't die because
[1:34:22] of money it wasn't about money it was
[1:34:25] about poor leadership someone had
[1:34:27] something in their mind in their heart
[1:34:29] and they said I can do it better than
[1:34:30] what the instruction of the word for my
[1:34:32] day is I can mingle my idea and it will
[1:34:35] be just fine the Holy Ghost came around
[1:34:37] to say uh-uh not this time buddy it
[1:34:39] ain't going to be just fine you follow
[1:34:41] exactly according to the word for your
[1:34:43] day or you bring death that's what that
[1:34:46] example is just like Moses in the land
[1:34:48] of goam the last plague apply the blood
[1:34:51] and if you don't apply the blood exactly
[1:34:54] like the instructions are what's going
[1:34:55] to happen the death Angel's passing
[1:34:58] through and if you don't have that token
[1:35:00] you know brothers and sisters the death
[1:35:02] angel is passing through the land today
[1:35:04] if we don't have that token followed the
[1:35:06] instruction exactly for the word for our
[1:35:11] day let's turn over to Matthew chapter
[1:35:16] 12 Matthew chapter 12 talking about
[1:35:20] leadership
[1:35:22] leadership in the body leadership in the
[1:35:25] family today I want to talk specifically
[1:35:27] about leadership in the family you know
[1:35:30] we can talk about the body in the
[1:35:32] church and the real leadership in the
[1:35:35] church is going to be the one that
[1:35:37] actually is
[1:35:39] willing to put the word of God
[1:35:43] first and not just preach
[1:35:46] it the same thing in the
[1:35:48] home we've got to be willing to live it
[1:35:51] in our home we could preach it all we
[1:35:54] want you know we brought up that picture
[1:35:56] that image maybe we'll bring that up too
[1:35:58] do you have that of the of the monkey
[1:36:00] the tinkling symbol we'll bring that up
[1:36:03] in a minute let's read this Matthew
[1:36:10] 12:31 Jesus speaking here he says
[1:36:12] wherefore I say unto you all manner of
[1:36:16] sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
[1:36:19] men but the blasphemy against the Holy
[1:36:22] Ghost shall not be forgiven unto
[1:36:25] men and whosoever speaketh a word
[1:36:28] against the son of man it shall be
[1:36:30] forgiven him so remember Jesus God in
[1:36:34] flesh the fullness of the godhead made
[1:36:37] bodily is saying even to speak against
[1:36:40] Jesus the son of man it'll be forgiven
[1:36:43] it's okay right let's continue on but
[1:36:47] whosoever speaketh against the Holy
[1:36:49] Ghost it shall not be be forgiven him
[1:36:52] neither in this world neither in the
[1:36:54] world to
[1:36:56] come either make the tree good and his
[1:36:59] fruit good or else make the tree corrupt
[1:37:01] and his fruit corrupt for the tree is
[1:37:05] known by his fruit remember we talked
[1:37:09] about it last year I think it was last
[1:37:10] year maybe the year before it kind of
[1:37:12] Blends together I am the vine and who's
[1:37:15] the
[1:37:16] branches and every branch that puts
[1:37:19] forth fruit what's going to happen he's
[1:37:20] going to clip it and he's going to purge
[1:37:23] it but every branch that bringeth forth
[1:37:25] not fruit not fruit according to the
[1:37:28] word of God is going to be clipped off
[1:37:30] and thrown into the
[1:37:31] fire let let let the tree be good and
[1:37:36] his fruit good or else let the tree be
[1:37:39] corrupt and his fruit corrupt we know
[1:37:41] that in Revelation he said to the leodan
[1:37:43] church you know what you're you're
[1:37:44] neither War more cold and for that
[1:37:47] reason I'm just going to spit you out
[1:37:48] because you're you're neither good or
[1:37:50] bad you're nothing there's nothing going
[1:37:51] on for you I would that you were hot or
[1:37:54] cold at least there was something in
[1:37:56] you for the
[1:37:59] word it's important for us to recognize
[1:38:01] that when we're speaking and we're
[1:38:03] speaking specifically about brothers and
[1:38:06] sisters we need to make sure that we're
[1:38:08] letting that fruit be good that that
[1:38:10] tree that is actually doing the speaking
[1:38:13] the fruit of our lips brothers and
[1:38:15] sisters is good fruit because if it's
[1:38:17] not it's going to cause a major problem
[1:38:21] because we could potentially be
[1:38:23] blaspheming in the Holy Ghost and you
[1:38:25] know bring you can bring up that picture
[1:38:27] Isaac I put this up a while ago I'm
[1:38:29] going to keep bringing it up as we go if
[1:38:31] we just talk about the message of the
[1:38:33] hour and we act about the message of the
[1:38:36] hour this is what we are we're a
[1:38:38] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol if
[1:38:40] we have truly have the charity of the
[1:38:44] Holy Ghost the life literal love of
[1:38:47] Jesus Christ Living out through us we're
[1:38:48] going to live this message of the hour
[1:38:50] so not going to be something we're just
[1:38:52] preaching but until we actually begin to
[1:38:54] live it until it takes off in our lives
[1:38:56] this is what we are to the people around
[1:38:58] us you can take it down now we need to
[1:39:01] make sure that we know where we stand
[1:39:03] brothers and
[1:39:05] sisters we don't want to be that kind of
[1:39:07] a leader who wants to be that kind of a
[1:39:09] leader who wants to have that much of a
[1:39:11] blind spot everyone else can see that
[1:39:14] we're just tinkling the symbols talking
[1:39:16] about the message living about this and
[1:39:18] that but not actually showing the life
[1:39:21] of Jesus Christ in our lives by the
[1:39:23] fruit of our lips amen you know that
[1:39:26] Jesus he gave the disciples instruction
[1:39:30] and he told them to trry in
[1:39:32] Jerusalem and we know that we know that
[1:39:36] he was given for a purpose Jesus was
[1:39:39] given for a purpose and what was that so
[1:39:41] that he could atone for our sins he
[1:39:44] could be the sa sacrifice Made For All
[1:39:47] Mankind for the whole entire world and
[1:39:49] alls we have to do is accept it right we
[1:39:52] we don't have to do anything for it we
[1:39:53] just have to say amen and accept that
[1:39:55] sacrifice and and when he was done
[1:39:58] buried when he was put on the cross and
[1:40:01] and died he was buried and he
[1:40:03] resurrected again we know that he went
[1:40:04] back up to heaven and when he went up to
[1:40:08] heaven those two men were left standing
[1:40:10] there looking at the disciples as they
[1:40:13] watched him go up in the clouds and
[1:40:14] think wow and and they told him you know
[1:40:17] what ye men of Galilee what are you
[1:40:19] standing here looking for get big busy
[1:40:21] get moving get going get into Jerusalem
[1:40:24] and get together and wait until you are
[1:40:26] indued with power from on high and what
[1:40:28] was that that was Jesus Christ now going
[1:40:31] up to heaven and then dividing himself
[1:40:33] and sending that Pillar of Fire back
[1:40:35] upon men and we know that at Pentecost
[1:40:38] that's what happened but before Acts
[1:40:40] chapter 2 when the day of Pentecost was
[1:40:43] fully come we know that scripture very
[1:40:45] well before that could happen they had
[1:40:48] to have a little bit of a Shakedown Acts
[1:40:50] chapter 1 the latter part of it they had
[1:40:52] to get a little political they had to
[1:40:54] get all of the people into their
[1:40:55] positions and just the same with every
[1:40:58] single believer in order for us to get
[1:41:00] to that acts chapter 2 portion of Our
[1:41:02] Lives where the day of Pentecost is
[1:41:04] fully come for us in our lives we've got
[1:41:06] to do that in our lives we got to go
[1:41:08] back and make sure that we shake
[1:41:09] everything down pick out the details the
[1:41:12] devil's in the details brothers and
[1:41:14] sisters make sure that we're actually
[1:41:16] being led properly you know it's no
[1:41:19] accident that the message of the hour
[1:41:22] was recorded the way it was the very
[1:41:24] last message in the recordings of the
[1:41:27] message of the hour is
[1:41:29] communion the final ordinances that God
[1:41:32] has given that Jesus has given for the
[1:41:34] church in our day communion service but
[1:41:36] just before that the message was
[1:41:39] leadership and there's there's there's
[1:41:41] leadership for men were designed to be
[1:41:43] led brothers and sisters in the fall we
[1:41:46] were designed to be led and before that
[1:41:49] we still had a God and we love to
[1:41:50] worship him but we had the ability to to
[1:41:53] maybe lead ourselves as Messiah as God
[1:41:56] on this Earth but you know it's no
[1:41:59] accident that the message was recorded
[1:42:01] that way first leadership then communion
[1:42:04] if we cannot be led if we're not willing
[1:42:06] to be led brothers and sisters then I
[1:42:08] want to say this there's a pride spirit
[1:42:09] in us we're being affected by some kind
[1:42:12] of a spirit and I want to say it's Pride
[1:42:14] it's the devil and that's all it is
[1:42:16] let's just call it what it is if we've
[1:42:19] had a problem being led just call it out
[1:42:21] say I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[1:42:23] Christ you don't have to be in a
[1:42:25] situation where you're you're you're
[1:42:27] knowing you're in a transgression if you
[1:42:29] truly believe the message of the hour
[1:42:30] then you're going to be fully willing to
[1:42:32] be
[1:42:33] led because if you're being led
[1:42:37] astray who's going to be responsible for
[1:42:40] that if you're living in purity of heart
[1:42:44] mind and
[1:42:46] soul I want to say this though I just
[1:42:48] think it's so beautiful if you are truly
[1:42:50] a son of daughter of God and you truly
[1:42:52] have the Holy Ghost in your life you
[1:42:53] can't be led astray it's that simple you
[1:42:55] don't have to live in fear we know that
[1:42:58] love casts out all fear perfect love
[1:43:01] casts out fear is what the word says so
[1:43:03] what do we have to fear brothers and
[1:43:05] sisters but fear
[1:43:07] itself Jesus gave them instruction to go
[1:43:10] back to Jerusalem and and then they had
[1:43:13] to get all of the humanity out that's
[1:43:15] what they had to do I said a little
[1:43:17] political they had to get all the
[1:43:18] humanity out they had to come to the
[1:43:20] place they were in one mind and one
[1:43:21] Accord they were no longer looking at
[1:43:23] the flesh they were no longer thinking
[1:43:24] that Peter had a temper and John was the
[1:43:27] most loved and someone else had this and
[1:43:29] something else was that they had to get
[1:43:31] all of that out of the way and once they
[1:43:32] did get past the humanity then God said
[1:43:34] okay now we're ready to do something and
[1:43:37] that's what I want to try and encourage
[1:43:38] us to brothers and sisters forget about
[1:43:40] the sin that so easily besets us and
[1:43:42] let's just with patience run this race
[1:43:45] together because one of these days
[1:43:47] someone's going to go in that
[1:43:48] resurrection and Rapture why not us
[1:43:53] they had to get all the humanity out of
[1:43:55] the way and they had to just like his
[1:43:59] bride she's got to get all the humanity
[1:44:01] out of her
[1:44:02] way because she's got Humanity he chose
[1:44:04] a bride who is a human being isn't that
[1:44:09] strange but she's going to take and say
[1:44:12] you know what all this flesh it doesn't
[1:44:13] matter it doesn't count for nothing
[1:44:15] because I press towards the mark for the
[1:44:17] prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:44:19] Christ Jesus I'm not willing to let
[1:44:20] anybody get in my way I'm not willing to
[1:44:22] let anybody's hurt in the past get in my
[1:44:25] way I'm not willing to let any Pastor or
[1:44:28] someone else get in the way of my
[1:44:30] salvation in the way of my spiritual
[1:44:32] success it's not going to stop me and my
[1:44:34] family from going to church no way they
[1:44:37] had to stop with the politics and when
[1:44:39] they did they got the Holy
[1:44:42] Ghost one mind and one Accord you know
[1:44:45] brothers and sisters I want to just talk
[1:44:47] about this for a little while 1963
[1:44:49] brother Bram he preached Christ is the
[1:44:51] mystery of God revealed you can bring it
[1:44:53] up Isaac I'm just going to take a minute
[1:44:54] or two and let you find it love one
[1:44:56] another above
[1:44:58] everything look that up love one another
[1:45:01] above everything in Christ is the
[1:45:03] mystery of God revealed it's called the
[1:45:06] word to the church commonly there's a
[1:45:08] poster of it in the back in the hallway
[1:45:11] there I just want to dwell on this for a
[1:45:13] little
[1:45:14] bit love one another above everything
[1:45:18] love one another
[1:45:22] there's no room for anger there's no
[1:45:25] room for hurt there's no room for
[1:45:28] resentment there's no room for fear
[1:45:31] there's no room for any other emotion
[1:45:33] than love brothers and sisters
[1:45:35] everything else will lead us astray we
[1:45:37] talked about it in in a a past service
[1:45:40] you know our senses are going to lie to
[1:45:42] us and as soon as we recognize that
[1:45:44] they're going contrary to the word of
[1:45:46] God that's when we have to say our
[1:45:47] senses no longer help us so we're just
[1:45:49] going to push them aside we're going to
[1:45:50] to leave our senses aside and we're
[1:45:52] going to go by faith we're going to go
[1:45:54] by the love that's within us am you can
[1:45:57] go ahead and bring it
[1:45:58] up love one another above everything
[1:46:02] love one
[1:46:05] another he says this is Brother Bram
[1:46:07] speaking Jesus God Elohim speaking
[1:46:11] through his Prophet to this age don't no
[1:46:16] matter what the devil tries to say how
[1:46:19] does the devil talk brothers and S
[1:46:20] sisters how does the devil
[1:46:22] speak how does God speak isn't it
[1:46:26] interesting no matter what the devil
[1:46:29] tries to say now you're all one great
[1:46:31] big sweet group now but remember my
[1:46:34] warning see Satan won't let that stay
[1:46:37] that way no sir he'll shoot everything
[1:46:42] if he has to bring somebody in to make
[1:46:44] his Target he'll bring some critic or
[1:46:49] unbeliever in
[1:46:51] I like how he says that he'll bring some
[1:46:52] critics so a Believer will come in and
[1:46:54] sit down yeah a critic or an unbeliever
[1:46:58] in and sit him down and cause him to
[1:47:00] fellowship with with you under the
[1:47:03] quietness in things yeah we're Believers
[1:47:06] and then he'll shoot that guy with some
[1:47:08] kind of a poison stuff and he'll what
[1:47:12] he'll start through the church with it
[1:47:14] how does he do that he'll start through
[1:47:16] the church with it he'll want to talk
[1:47:18] bad about a brother he'll want to lamb a
[1:47:20] sister he'll say do you know what that
[1:47:22] Pastor did oh do you know what that
[1:47:24] Deacon did do you know what the song
[1:47:26] leader does all these different things
[1:47:28] and it's all based on a past experiences
[1:47:30] in our lives that's why we're going to
[1:47:32] be magnetically drawn to those faults
[1:47:34] but if we get the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:47:35] Lives brothers and sisters it puts us in
[1:47:37] a different spot he says he'll cause him
[1:47:40] to fellowship with you under the
[1:47:42] quietness and things and then he'll
[1:47:44] shoot that guy with some kind of a
[1:47:46] poison stuff and he'll start through the
[1:47:48] church with it what is the Prophet say
[1:47:51] what does God say through the prophet to
[1:47:53] the church he says don't you take sides
[1:47:55] with
[1:47:56] it that's the believer's position I'm
[1:47:58] going to just shout that tonight that's
[1:48:00] where the believer is actually going to
[1:48:03] live the make believer and the
[1:48:05] unbeliever they're going to be
[1:48:06] fellowshipping back and forth from cup
[1:48:08] to cup they're going to be going this
[1:48:09] way and you know what there's three
[1:48:11] kinds of Believers in every Group which
[1:48:12] one are
[1:48:15] you don't you have nothing to do with
[1:48:18] anything else amen you stay right loving
[1:48:21] and sweet and kind to one
[1:48:23] another Hallelujah pray for that man
[1:48:27] that he'll be Sav too or that woman or
[1:48:31] ever who it is just pray for them and
[1:48:35] stick with one
[1:48:37] another and you know I'm not saying this
[1:48:39] about me but it's here so I'm going to
[1:48:40] say it it says and stay with your pastor
[1:48:43] see he's the shepherd and I just say
[1:48:45] this if you can't respect the man look
[1:48:47] at the
[1:48:48] office and you give him respects give
[1:48:52] the office respects brothers and sisters
[1:48:54] because that office he'll lead you
[1:48:55] through and because he's ordained of God
[1:48:58] to do so brother bradam goes on to say
[1:49:01] here God through the prophet now do you
[1:49:04] remember that congregation says amen the
[1:49:07] enemy will
[1:49:08] come brothers and sisters this isn't
[1:49:11] just a fictitious statement from a
[1:49:13] prophet that that that was written up
[1:49:15] and put in a book and someone put on a
[1:49:17] poster this is about the life of Jesus
[1:49:19] Christ This is is about the Church of
[1:49:21] the Living God the devil is going to
[1:49:22] come in and sit down in our group he's
[1:49:25] going to try and shoot poison stuff
[1:49:27] through our church he's going to try and
[1:49:29] get us to slander one another but just
[1:49:32] stay right sweet and pray for that
[1:49:34] brother or that sister don't slander
[1:49:37] them back we don't want to do
[1:49:40] that and when he does just cling that
[1:49:43] much closer together and the one that
[1:49:45] the devil is using for an enemy will
[1:49:48] either get out
[1:49:50] because they can't stand the preaching
[1:49:52] of the Holy Ghost and they can't stand
[1:49:54] it when the someone else has that shut
[1:49:57] your mouth Ministry and when they start
[1:49:59] talking oh so gently and sweet about
[1:50:01] that brother and you know he does this
[1:50:03] they'll say shut your mouth I don't want
[1:50:06] nothing to do with that because I
[1:50:08] recognize that's Satan and I rebuke you
[1:50:11] in the name of
[1:50:12] Jesus what must that have been like hey
[1:50:15] for that Apostle they were having Church
[1:50:18] having such a a good time together
[1:50:21] Jesus said I've got to be delivered up I
[1:50:24] I've got to go and be delivered up so
[1:50:26] that I can die for the sins of man I'm
[1:50:28] going to go and get nailed to a cross
[1:50:31] and and they're going to do that to me
[1:50:33] and what did Peter say he said no not on
[1:50:35] my watch I'm going to show you my sword
[1:50:37] I'm going to go and I'm going to do in
[1:50:38] anyone that wants to get in the way I'm
[1:50:40] your bodyguard see you're my guy and I
[1:50:42] got you I got this intellectual thinking
[1:50:45] right and what did Jesus do he didn't
[1:50:48] say Peter don't you know know the
[1:50:50] scriptures I've got to be you know
[1:50:52] delivered up into sinful men and and and
[1:50:55] be killed and and buried and then raised
[1:50:57] again the third day and no he didn't he
[1:51:00] said Satan get behind me because you
[1:51:04] don't understand man I am God in flesh
[1:51:08] and my will is going to come to
[1:51:11] pass the devil loves to go to
[1:51:15] church it's just a fact but you know
[1:51:18] brothers and sisters that person whoever
[1:51:20] the devil is using for an enemy will
[1:51:22] either get out or come in and be one of
[1:51:24] you that's all isn't that beautiful he
[1:51:27] says don't never Clan among one or talk
[1:51:30] make yourself clannish he says we are
[1:51:33] one I couldn't say my left hand I'm mad
[1:51:36] at you I'm going to take you away cuz
[1:51:39] you're not a right hand he's my left
[1:51:42] hand and I I want him to stay there even
[1:51:45] the little tip of my finger I can tell
[1:51:48] you brothers and sisters even the little
[1:51:50] little tip of my finger I want it to
[1:51:51] stay right there and last night I almost
[1:51:54] took it off I want the little tip of my
[1:51:57] finger and and just like any one of us
[1:51:59] in the church we might not have a lot
[1:52:01] that we do in the church but brothers
[1:52:03] and sisters when you come here you might
[1:52:05] not notice what you do but the others do
[1:52:08] you bring an atmosphere and you know
[1:52:11] what if you're just a little tip of the
[1:52:12] finger in the body keep coming we need
[1:52:17] you he says he's my left hand I want him
[1:52:19] to stay right there even the little tip
[1:52:21] of my finger I want to stay right there
[1:52:25] every little part of my body stay right
[1:52:27] there and God wants us as a body of
[1:52:30] Believers to stay right exactly with one
[1:52:33] another right at with one another amen
[1:52:37] hallelujah this is the word to the
[1:52:40] church brothers and sisters we need to
[1:52:42] be very careful because as Leaders of
[1:52:45] our homes what we say it means
[1:52:48] something every word that we speak has
[1:52:51] power and you know the natural world is
[1:52:54] typing into this is is really dialing
[1:52:56] into it the spoken word and you know
[1:52:58] we've talked about videos in the past
[1:53:01] and and we all have probably heard this
[1:53:02] but I'm just going to throw it out there
[1:53:03] as we go into 24 you know they they've
[1:53:07] said that videos are the rage and that's
[1:53:09] why in every restaurant and every place
[1:53:11] you go into it's all video screens and
[1:53:13] you know even in Philippines you don't
[1:53:15] see it so much here but when we were
[1:53:16] there there was giant Billboards that
[1:53:18] were video screen screens huge why is it
[1:53:22] because it captures our attention but
[1:53:24] you know that's not really what the
[1:53:26] endgame is the end game for technology
[1:53:29] is the spoken word and you know if you
[1:53:31] want to test it when we leave service
[1:53:34] here I should say it from the microphone
[1:53:35] I'm not going to because I wouldn't want
[1:53:37] to put anybody on the
[1:53:39] spot I'll just turn this off and uh and
[1:53:42] I'll say it if if you want to see really
[1:53:45] who's listening just say hey Siri
[1:53:51] and see whose phone answers because
[1:53:53] she's always listening he's always
[1:53:55] listening whatever it is is always
[1:53:57] listening brothers and
[1:53:59] sisters the spoken word is the age that
[1:54:02] we live in and that's why we need to
[1:54:05] recognize the power of our words
[1:54:07] remember
[1:54:09] Elisha the prophet and how he followed
[1:54:13] his teacher he followed the word to a
[1:54:15] letter for his day he said to him you
[1:54:18] know if you follow me and you don't take
[1:54:21] your eyes off of me if you keep yourself
[1:54:23] focused with this word you can have what
[1:54:24] you ask and he said hey I want a double
[1:54:27] portion of what you got then and we know
[1:54:29] that's what he got but in between the
[1:54:32] time that that his master went up on a
[1:54:34] chariot of fire and he performed all the
[1:54:37] double Miracles that he asked for that
[1:54:39] double portion we know that he went
[1:54:41] across he had his his master's mantle he
[1:54:43] had that anointing was upon him and what
[1:54:46] happened there was all those children
[1:54:48] that were out playing and what did the
[1:54:50] children do the children were mocking
[1:54:52] the prophet of God in his day we know it
[1:54:55] was the devil in those children because
[1:54:57] the parents didn't recognize enough that
[1:55:00] there is power in their words and what
[1:55:02] happened what whatsoever they had sown
[1:55:05] they shall reap because God's not mocked
[1:55:08] and what were they doing they weren't
[1:55:09] mocking the prophet of God they were
[1:55:11] mocking God and they didn't even
[1:55:13] recognize it and that's why I want to
[1:55:15] say brothers and sisters make sure that
[1:55:17] we are not mocking God because if God is
[1:55:20] working through a brother or a
[1:55:23] sister and we mock him boy oh boy oh boy
[1:55:27] and you know what in the day in which we
[1:55:28] live don't worry about she Bears coming
[1:55:30] out of the woods worry about rock and
[1:55:32] roll coming out of the woods worry about
[1:55:34] the pressures of this life coming out of
[1:55:36] the woods worry about Hollywood coming
[1:55:39] out of the woods worry about all the
[1:55:40] attraction all the shiny things in this
[1:55:43] world coming out of the woods to capture
[1:55:45] the attention of our children because
[1:55:47] that's what we encounter that's what
[1:55:49] we're fighting against we don't have to
[1:55:51] worry about she bears not even seeing an
[1:55:54] enemy come in with rifles one day that
[1:55:57] could happen here brother bradam talked
[1:55:58] about it in places I'm
[1:56:00] sure but we've got this world oh see
[1:56:04] look at this
[1:56:08] my sorry my phone was
[1:56:16] listening what we say means something
[1:56:18] brothers and sisters and that's why that
[1:56:20] is why the world is dialing into this
[1:56:23] it's not about videos it's not about
[1:56:26] deep fake even it's about the power of
[1:56:29] the spoken word because our body hears
[1:56:31] it and we know we probably heard this
[1:56:33] said that every single cell in our body
[1:56:35] hears the power of our spoken word and
[1:56:38] the entire business world out there the
[1:56:40] athletes all of that understand the
[1:56:43] psychology behind it what it does is it
[1:56:46] changes our thinking and we might not
[1:56:48] feel a change but our feelings have
[1:56:50] nothing to do with it we will never live
[1:56:53] above our confession so speak High
[1:56:56] brothers and sisters testify about the
[1:56:58] things of the Lord recognize our
[1:57:01] position in Christ Jesus as we go
[1:57:03] through
[1:57:05] 2024 what we say it means something and
[1:57:08] you know when we say
[1:57:10] something isn't it amazing I was
[1:57:13] thinking about this when we say
[1:57:14] something we can become known by our
[1:57:17] word and you know we do become known by
[1:57:19] our word for
[1:57:21] sure either for keeping our word or for
[1:57:24] breaking our
[1:57:26] word we are known by our word the word
[1:57:29] that's spoken our vow we are known by it
[1:57:33] and our lives our actions display this
[1:57:37] we don't even need to
[1:57:39] speak I could say one thing to my wife
[1:57:41] and then do something totally different
[1:57:43] and she might not say anything to me she
[1:57:45] might just be completely silent about it
[1:57:47] and I might think everything is just
[1:57:49] fine there's no problem there's no issue
[1:57:50] we'll just carry on everything will be
[1:57:52] fine but eventually one day after that
[1:57:55] happens over and over and over again one
[1:57:58] of these days she's going to snap
[1:58:00] something's going to give and there's
[1:58:02] going to be a big huge problem that goes
[1:58:04] on why is that because I'm not keeping
[1:58:07] my word I'm saying that I'm a Believer
[1:58:10] but maybe I'm not acting like
[1:58:13] one or
[1:58:15] maybe I'm
[1:58:17] actually saying that I'm a believer and
[1:58:20] then I'm acting like
[1:58:22] one either way we become known by our
[1:58:25] words and you know the most important
[1:58:27] thing is for our children to see
[1:58:28] that our children our spouses our
[1:58:31] friends our family what I wanted to talk
[1:58:34] about today brothers and sisters is that
[1:58:37] blasphemy it isn't simply saying that I
[1:58:40] believe that I don't believe sorry that
[1:58:41] God sent a prophet because many times we
[1:58:44] could look at it and say well you know
[1:58:46] blaspheming is is saying that I don't
[1:58:48] believe the works of God
[1:58:49] that that it's the works of the devil
[1:58:51] and you know the prophet of God he was
[1:58:53] not the prophet of God he was maybe a
[1:58:56] charlatan like some people would try and
[1:58:58] paint him you know to maybe say that I
[1:59:00] don't believe the way that that Minister
[1:59:02] preaches or whatever it is all of that
[1:59:05] you know blaspheming in our day is going
[1:59:06] to be seeing the Holy Ghost operating in
[1:59:09] someone's life whether we discern it or
[1:59:11] not and then speaking evil of it
[1:59:13] brothers and
[1:59:14] sisters that's blaspheming right amen
[1:59:18] saying amen are not to the word that's
[1:59:19] not
[1:59:20] blaspheming I had a discussion with a
[1:59:22] young man about this and he felt like he
[1:59:24] blasphemed like he overstepped but you
[1:59:27] know he didn't because we said it before
[1:59:29] and we'll say it again if your soul is a
[1:59:32] a a son and daughter of God you can't
[1:59:34] make a deal with the devil for your soul
[1:59:36] you can't blaspheme away your day you
[1:59:39] you you're saved to the day of your
[1:59:40] Redemption but you know blaspheming
[1:59:43] can't be done by a Christian isn't that
[1:59:46] a beautiful
[1:59:47] thing and I got a quote for that one
[1:59:49] that I'm going to bring I'm going to
[1:59:51] make sure that we have that but I want
[1:59:53] to say Lord have mercy in our lives that
[1:59:57] that that we would not blaspheme the
[2:00:00] holy ghost that we would look at our
[2:00:02] brothers and look at our sisters as we
[2:00:04] read that quote that we have in the back
[2:00:07] this morning that we would say you know
[2:00:09] what I don't know what's going on that
[2:00:10] brother that sister's life but I know
[2:00:13] that God will deal with them accordingly
[2:00:16] and I want to say that they are a son
[2:00:18] and a daughter of God and blessed be the
[2:00:20] name of the Lord because he saved me I
[2:00:23] recognize myself to be a skunk and
[2:00:26] outside of the grace of God in my life I
[2:00:29] would be nothing
[2:00:34] amen the message of the hour isn't just
[2:00:36] so we can have knowledge it's so that we
[2:00:39] can have life and brothers and sisters
[2:00:42] it's not just so that we can have
[2:00:43] eternal life many times we can put it
[2:00:45] out there and say yeah praise the Lord I
[2:00:49] I know the message of the hour I got the
[2:00:50] message of the hour and I I know that
[2:00:53] I've got the message of the hour because
[2:00:54] I believe it and I can say Amen to it
[2:00:57] but for some reason we just can't live
[2:00:59] it do you have it do you have the
[2:01:01] message of the hour if we're not living
[2:01:03] it according to the way the prophet said
[2:01:04] for our day I'll say no we don't but
[2:01:07] it's not too late that's the point in
[2:01:10] 2024 we can get in line with the word
[2:01:12] for our day and we can see this life
[2:01:15] it's not about just eternal life it's
[2:01:17] about living the life of Jesus Christ
[2:01:20] today to the world around
[2:01:23] us Christ in you the hope of
[2:01:28] glory let's turn to Matthew Chapter 5
[2:01:31] quickly as we've got five minutes left
[2:01:34] Matthew Chapter 5 in
[2:01:38] [Music]
[2:01:40] five talking about blaspheming talking
[2:01:42] about our words having power talking
[2:01:44] about leadership correct leadership in
[2:01:46] our homes we need to teach our wives
[2:01:48] nope don't talk that way we need to
[2:01:50] teach our children nope don't say that
[2:01:51] about your brother or your sister that's
[2:01:53] potentially God living out through
[2:01:58] them Matthew chap
[2:02:03] 5:22 Sermon on the
[2:02:05] Mount Jesus speaking here he says but I
[2:02:08] say unto you that whosoever is angry
[2:02:11] with his brother without a cause shall
[2:02:14] be in danger of the judgment and
[2:02:17] whosoever shall say to his brother
[2:02:20] shall be in danger of the
[2:02:22] counsel but whosoever shall say thou
[2:02:25] fool shall be in danger of
[2:02:29] Hellfire therefore if thou bring thy
[2:02:31] gift to The Altar and there rememberest
[2:02:35] that thy brother hath ought against
[2:02:38] thee leave there thy gift before the
[2:02:42] Altar and go thy
[2:02:44] way first be reconciled to thy brother
[2:02:48] then come
[2:02:49] and offer thy
[2:02:51] gift he gives us very clear instructions
[2:02:55] on how to deal with this and when we
[2:02:57] come to church brothers and sisters is
[2:02:59] the altar when we go on our knees
[2:03:02] brothers and sisters is the
[2:03:04] altar we have an opportunity for God to
[2:03:06] speak to us and if you are a son and
[2:03:09] daughter of God you know exactly what
[2:03:10] I'm saying to you right now he will
[2:03:12] speak to your heart and when he does
[2:03:13] speak to your heart you have the
[2:03:15] opportunity now to apply this scripture
[2:03:18] right here
[2:03:19] but if you choose to step over it and
[2:03:21] say well you know this that the other
[2:03:24] whatever the thing is then what happens
[2:03:26] is you're in danger you're in danger and
[2:03:30] we know that brother brandham says it
[2:03:31] very clearly that our souls are hung
[2:03:33] over Hell by a chain and a chain is as
[2:03:36] strong as its weakest link don't let our
[2:03:39] pride be that weak Link in our lives
[2:03:42] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[2:03:44] Lord and He will lift you up and
[2:03:47] remember humbling yourself in the sight
[2:03:48] of the Lord isn't just coming to prayer
[2:03:49] meeting it's not just coming to church
[2:03:51] it's not just having prayer it's
[2:03:53] humbling yourself before your brother
[2:03:55] before your sister before your husband
[2:03:56] before your wife before your parents
[2:03:59] before your children having the ability
[2:04:02] to show that you have humility the life
[2:04:05] of Jesus Christ Living in
[2:04:08] you Hebrews chapter 6 number two as we
[2:04:11] close this morning I'll even call the
[2:04:13] musicians to prove
[2:04:15] it paragraph 313 brother bradam says
[2:04:18] some woman come to me not long
[2:04:22] ago some woman come to me not long
[2:04:27] ago I'll just give you the opportunity
[2:04:30] to look that up this is that quote I was
[2:04:32] talking about some woman come to me not
[2:04:34] long ago I I don't want to ever leave us
[2:04:37] in a situation where we think my
[2:04:39] goodness am I in danger of Hellfire I
[2:04:42] know I've said something about that
[2:04:43] brother and I've said something about
[2:04:45] that sister you know if you have just
[2:04:49] put it under the blood how do you do
[2:04:50] that just go and tell them say I said
[2:04:53] that about you I hope you'll forgive me
[2:04:56] and you know we've probably heard it
[2:04:58] said and I I would ask if anyone knows
[2:05:00] the quote specifically or I don't know
[2:05:03] if it's just a tradition go ahead bring
[2:05:05] it up um we wouldn't want to be guilty
[2:05:09] of taking something that's been
[2:05:11] thoroughly properly placed under the
[2:05:12] blood and pulling it out from under the
[2:05:15] blood to wave it in front of someone
[2:05:18] would we
[2:05:19] I've heard it said that that actually
[2:05:21] could potentially become our very own if
[2:05:25] we're willing to do that I don't know
[2:05:26] the quote if someone has it I'd love it
[2:05:28] if you could send it to me but brothers
[2:05:30] and sisters if something's under the
[2:05:32] blood leave it there because which one
[2:05:34] of us is without sin you know the one
[2:05:37] without sin go ahead and cast the first
[2:05:39] stone that's what Jesus said to the
[2:05:41] woman who was caught in the act that's
[2:05:45] right why brother bradam says some woman
[2:05:48] and come to me not long ago and said
[2:05:50] brother brandom I'm a Christian but I
[2:05:52] blasphemed the Holy Ghost I love it God
[2:05:55] speaking through his Prophet I said it's
[2:05:58] impossible a Christian could not
[2:06:00] blaspheme the Holy
[2:06:03] Ghost you can't do it a Christian Spirit
[2:06:07] Bears record with Christ's Spirit see
[2:06:10] and you'll call everything of God
[2:06:14] Gods I want to say this brothers and
[2:06:17] sisters if you have done something and
[2:06:20] you are a Christian you're not going to
[2:06:22] just leave it there it's going to haunt
[2:06:24] you every single waking hour God will
[2:06:27] not let you rest it will haunt you it
[2:06:29] will haunt you until you go make it
[2:06:31] right and as a son and daughter of God
[2:06:33] you will go and make it
[2:06:35] right brother bradam says I said it's
[2:06:38] impossible a Christian could not
[2:06:39] blaspheme the Holy Ghost you can't do it
[2:06:41] a Christian Spirit Bears record with
[2:06:44] Christ Spirit see and you'll call
[2:06:45] everything of God Gods but if your car
[2:06:48] Al minded you'll make fun and laugh at
[2:06:51] the Holy
[2:06:53] Ghost I don't care how much you go to
[2:06:56] church you're still a sinner and you're
[2:06:59] blaspheming the Holy
[2:07:02] Ghost remember the same thing as we
[2:07:05] talked about in our scripture today
[2:07:06] they're not talking about he's not
[2:07:08] talking about speaking to Jesus in
[2:07:10] prayer and and saying that whatever is
[2:07:13] happening is is the the the the life of
[2:07:15] the devil that's not what he's talking
[2:07:16] about it's the life of the brothers and
[2:07:18] sisters ERS right if you're carnal
[2:07:21] minded and you're looking at the hinder
[2:07:22] Parts you'll make fun and laugh at the
[2:07:24] Holy
[2:07:27] Ghost you're still a sinner and you're
[2:07:29] blaspheming the Holy Ghost when they
[2:07:32] seen Jesus Discerning their thoughts
[2:07:34] they said he was a fortune
[2:07:36] teller Jesus
[2:07:38] said I'll forgive you for that but when
[2:07:42] the Holy Ghost has come you speak a word
[2:07:44] against it it'll never be forgiven you
[2:07:48] because they said he has an unclean
[2:07:50] Spirit calling the spirit of God an
[2:07:51] unclean thing a Christian can't do that
[2:07:55] a Christian will always call the spirit
[2:07:57] of God righteousness see a Christian
[2:08:00] cannot blaspheme the Holy Ghost it's the
[2:08:03] outsider that
[2:08:06] blaspheme I just want to be clear
[2:08:08] brothers and sisters we can say things
[2:08:10] about a brother and a sister we can say
[2:08:12] things about family members but we can
[2:08:15] go and make it right and which one of us
[2:08:18] here which one of us here has never said
[2:08:20] something about
[2:08:22] someone I'm saying it now put up a hand
[2:08:24] whoever hasn't said anything about
[2:08:26] anybody in your life ever behind their
[2:08:27] back put a hand
[2:08:29] up I I can't do it either right we're
[2:08:32] all Sinners saved by grace aren't we
[2:08:35] isn't it the same Grace that we're all
[2:08:36] living off
[2:08:38] of if you have and it is bothering you
[2:08:41] you can go and make it right and I
[2:08:43] promise you brothers and sisters God
[2:08:45] will reward you abundantly for it
[2:08:50] and it might not come the way that you
[2:08:51] think it will it might just save your
[2:08:54] children it might prevent sickness from
[2:08:56] overcoming a child or overcoming a
[2:08:59] spouse it might prevent who knows what
[2:09:01] from happening in your life God he he
[2:09:04] wants to bless us a thousand more times
[2:09:06] that we want to be blessed this ain't
[2:09:07] about money about tithing and going to
[2:09:09] church this is about having the literal
[2:09:11] life of Jesus Christ Living out through
[2:09:13] his bride
[2:09:15] body he says that wasn't Christian step
[2:09:18] standing there it was religious
[2:09:20] people I hope there's no religious
[2:09:22] people here today it was Orthodox Jews
[2:09:25] doctors of divinity and so forth and
[2:09:28] they were making fun of him and calling
[2:09:30] his Works calling the works of God that
[2:09:33] it was an unclean Spirit doing it maybe
[2:09:36] stand with me as we finish this out here
[2:09:38] and how many do you think today
[2:09:40] blasphemes the Holy Ghost that's got a
[2:09:43] DDD PhD on their name how many great
[2:09:46] stiff necks orthodox Catholics
[2:09:49] Protestants walk the street and make fun
[2:09:51] of the operation of the Holy Ghost now
[2:09:54] I'm going to just whisper this in there
[2:09:55] brothers and sisters but how many stiff
[2:09:58] necks stiff necked I'll call it message
[2:10:02] people walk the street and make fun of
[2:10:05] the operation of the Holy Ghost just as
[2:10:08] polish Scholars I've been in the message
[2:10:10] for decades where'd you come from and
[2:10:13] slick as a button brother bam says right
[2:10:15] but they make fun of the Holy Ghost and
[2:10:17] therefore they blast blashe it but a
[2:10:19] born- again Christian cannot do that
[2:10:21] he'll say that's my brother oh my that's
[2:10:24] my that's the spirit of the Living God
[2:10:26] that's right a Christian cannot
[2:10:28] blaspheme the Holy Ghost it's the sinner
[2:10:30] that blasphemes the Holy Ghost the
[2:10:32] unbeliever The Sinner and unbeliever
[2:10:35] there's only two things either you are a
[2:10:37] Believer or you are an unbeliever and I
[2:10:40] believe we're talking to Believers here
