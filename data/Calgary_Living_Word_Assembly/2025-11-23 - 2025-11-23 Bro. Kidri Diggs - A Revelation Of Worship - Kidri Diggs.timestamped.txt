[48:18] Praise [music]
[48:20] you.
[48:24] Praise you.
[48:26] [music]
[48:28] [singing]
[48:30] my life.
[48:32] Oh Lord, [music] praise you. Can you
[48:36] have your seat this morning? Sing it.
[48:38] First verse [music] as the choir comes.
[48:40] As the choir comes, would you make your
[48:42] way up? Oh [singing] Lord, I sorry,
[48:45] second verse, I believe. Lord, you for
[48:50] me out
[48:52] of clay [music]
[48:56] and for [singing] your glory
[49:00] I
[49:03] was made.
[49:06] Oh, use this [music] vessel
[49:11] that you choose. [music]

[49:50] [music]
[49:52] Heat.
[49:56] [music]
[50:11] Amen.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you church.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Uh so church uh the choir has a song of
[50:17] testimony that they want to give to you
[50:19] today. Um we know that the Bible says
[50:22] that the devil goes around like a
[50:24] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.
[50:26] But that same Bible tells us that God
[50:29] has not given us a spirit of fear. Amen.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; But the spirit of love, power, and of a
[50:35] sound mind.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; And so the choir here wants to give
[50:39] their testimony of how with God we
[50:42] should have no fear. So if that is your
[50:45] testimony and you know the song, please
[50:46] feel free to sing along, clap along.
[50:49] Let's give God all the glory today,
[50:51] okay? And let's show the devil that he
[50:53] has no control over us. No matter what
[50:56] situation he brings to us, be it
[50:58] financial, be it health, be it family,
[51:01] be it whatever it is, in everything that
[51:05] the devil brings our way with God, we
[51:08] will have no fear. Amen.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; [music]
[51:27] [singing and music]
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Come on. Quiet.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; I got enemies every [music and singing]
[51:44] [music and singing]
[51:45] time. You might think that I'd be
[51:47] afraid. running scared with the shape of
[51:50] faith. But [singing] the God I know says
[51:52] it ain't over. The God I know is going
[51:54] to make a way.
[51:58] Though I [music and singing] walk
[52:00] through the valley,
[52:03] I [music and singing] will have no fear,
[52:07] no fear, no fear. The mighty [singing]
[52:11] power of [music] Jesus is fighting for
[52:13] me. No fear,
[52:16] &gt;&gt; no fear,
[52:17] &gt;&gt; no [singing] fear,
[52:18] &gt;&gt; no fear.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; The light of the world makes the
[52:22] darkness [music] disappear. No fear,
[52:26] my [music] life. [singing] No fear. My
[52:30] life my life.
[52:35] [music]

[52:46] fire cuz I know [music] what me

[55:31] devil know what side I'm on.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; And and and perfect love casts out fear.
[55:36] So
[55:36] &gt;&gt; why would we doubt that song? It's
[55:38] perfect. Thank you, choir. You did an
[55:40] amazing job. Thank you, brother Jason.
[55:42] Know you've been very involved. Of
[55:43] course, Lisa and Joel and everybody
[55:44] else, you've been very involved in
[55:46] putting that together. Thank you and God
[55:47] bless you for your efforts. Stand with
[55:49] me if you would as we change the order
[55:51] this even this morning. Sorry.
[55:54] I love this song.
[55:56] Thinking of Mary in the alabaster box.
[55:59] And there's a movie out there called The
[56:02] Chosen. I saw one episode where the
[56:05] Sadducees are just just completely
[56:07] annoyed about this woman crying with her
[56:10] tears up and and using the alabaster box
[56:12] [music] to anoint the Savior. Had no
[56:14] idea who they were talking to or who who
[56:16] they were in the midst of but didn't
[56:18] affect Mary one bit. She just kept on
[56:21] worshiping the Lord. May we do that with
[56:23] our praise this morning. Lord, may we
[56:25] pour our love on you. You're so worthy.
[56:27] I talk about it often. What an amazing
[56:29] husband he is. He's not a He's a
[56:32] gentleman. He never kicks a door down.
[56:34] Unlike me that have a constant fight
[56:36] with this flesh. He doesn't. He's just a
[56:40] gentleman. He loves embraces. He enjoys
[56:43] the love you bring back to him. Let's
[56:45] sing it this morning. Well, I don't know
[56:50] just exactly how I feel.
[56:56] [singing and music]
[57:00] has been. I'm lost [music] for words.
[57:08] [music] Is [singing] there
[57:11] a way
[57:13] to show you passion [music] in my heart?
[57:17] Can I
[57:19] express [music]
[57:21] how truly great I think you are?
[57:25] My dearest [music]
[57:28] pray
[57:32] [music]
[57:34] [singing] this is my desire
[57:37] [music]
[57:42] to pour [music] my love [singing] on
[57:44] you.
[57:46] Like oil upon your feet,
[57:50] like white,
[57:54] like water [music]
[57:55] from my heart. [singing]
[57:58] I pour my love on you.
[58:02] Embrace it like [music]
[58:06] I lavish my
[58:10] till every drop is gone.
[58:12] [music and singing]
[58:14] I'll pour my love
[58:18] on [music]
[58:19] you.
[58:25] Is there
[58:27] a way
[58:29] to [music] show the [singing] passion in
[58:31] my heart? Can I
[58:35] express
[58:37] how truly great I [music and singing]
[58:38] think you are? Heat. Heat. Heat.
[58:47] [music]
[58:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[58:58] &gt;&gt; My
[59:00] [music]
[59:01] go [singing]
[59:06] for you. [music]
[59:09] I
[59:12] [music]
[59:28] &gt;&gt; [music]
[59:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. Welcome each
[59:40] one once again to the house of the Lord.
[59:43] Certainly an honor and a privilege to
[59:45] gather together in the name of the Lord
[59:47] Jesus Christ.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; We're certainly thankful for each one
[59:52] present today. Certainly good to see
[59:54] your faces again to have the
[59:58] Odenovo back in [music] our midst after
[1:00:01] traveling to Nigeria. God bless you.
[1:00:05] [music] John Ojera
[1:00:07] who was in Nigeria as well. The Lord's
[1:00:10] given him traveling mercies as well. We
[1:00:12] never take it for granted when we travel
[1:00:15] the mercy of the Lord in our lives
[1:00:19] this morning. We're certainly thankful
[1:00:21] to have all of our visitors with us as
[1:00:23] well. Um not going to try and name
[1:00:25] everyone. I don't want to miss anyone.
[1:00:27] Just want to make sure that we
[1:00:28] acknowledge you and welcome you in the
[1:00:30] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; And I trust you get your fill today.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; If you come expecting,
[1:00:38] God always meets our expectations.
[1:00:39] [music]
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:42] And it just depends on what we're
[1:00:43] looking at. That's what we'll receive.
[1:00:47] I just wanted to
[1:00:49] mention one thing that was announced
[1:00:51] [music] last week, Brother Ed
[1:00:52] Hammermeister being ill with cancer and
[1:00:55] having a diagnosis that was terrible.
[1:00:59] And uh you know, he sent me a text
[1:01:02] [music] this week and it was just
[1:01:03] wonderful to see that you know, that was
[1:01:06] the doctor's report.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. originally, but there's more to
[1:01:10] the story
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; because there's a great physician.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; And the great physician doesn't have the
[1:01:17] [music] same report as the doctor.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; And in brother Ed's life, that's the
[1:01:22] story today.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the grim outlook that
[1:01:26] the doctor's report said that we, you
[1:01:28] know, heard last week. And uh we're
[1:01:30] certainly thankful for that.
[1:01:32] So, I'm sure he definitely still [music]
[1:01:35] covetss our prayers, but we thank the
[1:01:37] Lord for his healing touch in his life.
[1:01:41] Just a few announcements before we get
[1:01:43] into the the word today. We've got a
[1:01:46] prayer meeting coming up on Thursday the
[1:01:48] 4th of December. I'll be going to Grand
[1:01:52] Prairie that weekend [music] for the
[1:01:54] 5th, 6th, and 7th. I'll be taking three
[1:01:56] services there. So, I coveret your
[1:01:58] prayers and uh brother Don Snow will
[1:02:01] [music] take the service on Sunday the
[1:02:02] 7th here.
[1:02:04] We have uh a youth service here on the
[1:02:09] 12th [music] at 7:30
[1:02:11] and then we have on the 21st we'll be
[1:02:13] having the youth event in the afternoon
[1:02:16] after service. And uh remember the 31st
[1:02:20] which is a Wednesday evening we will
[1:02:23] have a communion worship service. Some
[1:02:25] might call them a watch night service,
[1:02:27] but I don't like to say watch [music]
[1:02:28] night because we might not be here till
[1:02:30] midnight. We just want to be here as
[1:02:32] long as the spirit moves, as long as we
[1:02:34] feel happy to be here. So, for those who
[1:02:38] don't know, brother Cadre Diggs is here
[1:02:40] from Columbia, South Carolina. He's been
[1:02:43] coming to Calgary for many years. I got
[1:02:46] to meet him with brother Ken here, and
[1:02:49] you know, he's just become a real good
[1:02:50] friend of mine since. And uh as we heard
[1:02:55] yesterday night, the Lord spoke to
[1:02:57] [music] us through our brother.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; And if you want to hear from the Lord
[1:03:01] today, just push aside all of your
[1:03:03] humanity and say amen to the word. Don't
[1:03:06] make him bring out his sign
[1:03:08] and see if God doesn't speak to you
[1:03:10] today.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing this chorus once again
[1:03:14] as we invite brother Cadre to come and
[1:03:16] just take his liberty.
[1:03:19] Like oil upon your feet, [singing]
[1:03:23] like wine for you to drink,
[1:03:27] like water [music and singing] from my
[1:03:30] heart,
[1:03:32] I pour my love on you.
[1:03:36] If praise is my perfe. you. [music]
[1:03:41] I [singing] love my
[1:03:45] till [music]
[1:03:51] my love
[1:03:53] [music]
[1:03:56] on you.
[1:04:02] is there [singing and music]
[1:04:04] a way
[1:04:06] to show the passion [music and singing]
[1:04:08] in my heart.
[1:04:11] Can I
[1:04:13] [music] express
[1:04:15] how truly great I think you
[1:04:17] [music and singing] are
[1:04:19] my dearest
[1:04:22] friend.
[1:04:26] [music]
[1:04:28] Heat. Heat. Heat. [singing]
[1:04:32] [music]
[1:04:38] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:04:40] [music]
[1:04:46] [singing and music]
[1:04:48] Yeah. Heat.
[1:04:52] [music]
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:05:12] [music]
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; One more time.
[1:05:19] Like oil upon your [music] feet.
[1:05:24] Like oil upon [singing]
[1:05:26] your
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Heat. Heat.
[1:05:32] [music]
[1:05:33] [singing]
[1:05:40] [music]
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:05:56] [music]
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads unto the
[1:06:07] Lord.
[1:06:10] Amen. As we bow our heads and close our
[1:06:12] eyes,
[1:06:14] you have an unspoken request, you can
[1:06:16] acknowledge it unto the Lord by an
[1:06:17] uplifted hand.
[1:06:22] We all are in need of something from
[1:06:24] God.
[1:06:27] Lord Jesus, we lift our hands to you,
[1:06:29] Lord,
[1:06:31] as an act of faith, Lord.
[1:06:36] Lord, we defy gravity to show that our
[1:06:38] need is greater.
[1:06:41] But Lord, in asking, Lord,
[1:06:44] let it be so, Father, that we receive
[1:06:47] nothing but your perfect will in our
[1:06:49] lives,
[1:06:52] Lord. For we know if it's your will,
[1:06:53] there'll be no expiration date.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; It won't cause any trouble. It won't
[1:06:59] offset anything, but it'll run in
[1:07:02] continuity with life
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; because it's your will.
[1:07:06] And Lord, our desire is to crave nothing
[1:07:08] [music] but your will, not your
[1:07:10] permissible will.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; But Lord God, to be in a channel, Lord,
[1:07:14] of life where we can grow and
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; we can see you, Lord, glorified
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; in our actions, Lord,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; in our thought pattern, in our behavior,
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; in everything we do. Lord, our desire is
[1:07:28] just to please you, Lord.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; So Lord, in asking, Father, we pray that
[1:07:32] you will touch our hearts, Lord, that we
[1:07:35] won't crave anything,
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; but the things of God.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, search us, Lord.
[1:07:42] Continue to make us fit for the master's
[1:07:44] use, Lord.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, and mold us into the image of your
[1:07:47] [music] thoughts, the image of your
[1:07:48] mind,
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Lord. And sometimes we don't understand
[1:07:51] what you're doing, Lord, but we are the
[1:07:54] clay and you're the potter. And we pray
[1:07:57] Lord that your hands will be upon us and
[1:08:00] continue to mold us Lord and shape us
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; by your word Lord.
[1:08:08] Lord, we pray for this church, Lord. You
[1:08:09] would just continue to bless, Lord, and
[1:08:11] pour out your spirit,
[1:08:13] Lord, and as a people, Lord, help us to
[1:08:16] go beyond just the thoughts of men.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; And let us see you revealed in your
[1:08:22] word, Lord, for we know that you're a
[1:08:24] God and simplicity. And we know that you
[1:08:27] brought gifts upon the earth, Lord, to
[1:08:29] use those gifts
[1:08:31] to continue to bring the people closer
[1:08:33] to you. Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; So Lord, we lay down every gift at your
[1:08:37] feet today, Lord,
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; that you may use it, Lord, that someone
[1:08:42] may be edified.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, if there's a need of a healing, we
[1:08:47] pray that the healer would move as he
[1:08:50] always does.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; If someone is bound, Lord, we pray that
[1:08:55] the deliverer
[1:08:57] would deliver this morning.
[1:09:01] and whatever need there is, Lord. Lord,
[1:09:03] we put you in place to be God.
[1:09:06] For you're our all and all. Lord,
[1:09:08] forgive us for our sins and trespasses,
[1:09:10] Lord. Lord, take this beyond just a
[1:09:13] church service,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; a Sunday morning, which can be no more
[1:09:18] than just tradition. Take us out of
[1:09:20] tradition, Lord.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; And Lord, bring us into that place like
[1:09:24] Adam and Eve when they came together,
[1:09:26] they knew they were meeting God
[1:09:28] Almighty, Lord. That's where we want to
[1:09:30] be. We believe that those days are
[1:09:32] restored. That time is restored where
[1:09:35] God comes down in the cool of the day
[1:09:38] and speaks to his children.
[1:09:41] Lord, will you operate
[1:09:44] the gift today, Lord?
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, and in hearing, Lord, let the
[1:09:48] people hear what the spirit is saying.
[1:09:51] In the wonderful name Jesus Christ, we
[1:09:54] pray. Let church say amen.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Church say amen again.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music]
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[1:10:01] the Lord today.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; How many glad about it?

[1:10:06] praise. [applause]
[1:10:11] Praise the Lord. [applause]

[1:10:17] hope you did. Hallelujah. Because we
[1:10:20] want Amen. the worship to go up before
[1:10:22] God
[1:10:24] and he could send down the fire upon our
[1:10:26] altars.
[1:10:27] Amen. Again, we thank God [music] for
[1:10:30] our pastor. Amen. Brother Barry,
[1:10:34] Pastor Johnson. Amen. We thank God for
[1:10:36] him and his his wife, his family. Amen.
[1:10:39] Thank God for all of you. You know, as a
[1:10:42] minister, when you come and preach, you
[1:10:44] just you just like last night, you know,
[1:10:46] it it wasn't hard to preach,
[1:10:50] you know, because of the atmosphere you
[1:10:51] guys set, you know, and that's a credit
[1:10:54] to the word that you're hearing, you
[1:10:56] know. So I thank God for men that just
[1:10:59] stay with [music] the word and you know
[1:11:01] when you come and you step behind the
[1:11:02] desk and we just stay with the word and
[1:11:04] we follow up in that same manner
[1:11:06] everybody will be blessed. Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to see. We want to
[1:11:09] see Christ. Amen. But um most of all we
[1:11:12] appreciate the presence of the Lord
[1:11:14] Jesus Christ. [music]
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm here to say that I don't
[1:11:19] have what you need but Christ does.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you focus in on him, if you
[1:11:24] pull on him, he'll grant your heart's
[1:11:27] desire. Amen. Let's let's just um turn
[1:11:29] in our Bibles to John St. John chapter
[1:11:33] 4.
[1:11:34] We appreciate all the music. That'll be
[1:11:37] it for now.
[1:11:45] St. John chapter 4.
[1:11:56] Y'all gonna have to pray for me. I left
[1:11:59] my alarm. [laughter]
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that clock right?
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:08] Okay,
[1:12:10] I'm about to close.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; St. John chapter 4 verse 21.
[1:12:20] The Bible says Jesus saith unto
[1:12:23] her,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh
[1:12:26] when ye shall neither in this mountain
[1:12:29] nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father.
[1:12:33] Ye worship ye know not what we know what
[1:12:37] we worship. For salvation is of the
[1:12:40] Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is,
[1:12:45] when the true worshipper shall worship
[1:12:47] the Father in spirit and in truth. For
[1:12:51] the Father seeketh such to worship him.
[1:12:55] God is a spirit,
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; and they that worship him must worship
[1:13:00] him in spirit and in truth.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; The woman saith unto him, I know that
[1:13:06] Messiah cometh, which is called Christ.
[1:13:09] when he has come, he will tell us all
[1:13:12] things. Jesus saith unto her, I that
[1:13:17] speak unto thee am he.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to uh the book of Psalms
[1:13:26] 151.
[1:13:31] Psalms 150
[1:13:34] 150 verse one.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Now, before I read this verse of
[1:13:54] scripture,
[1:13:56] I want to let you know today that what
[1:13:58] I'm about to speak on is going to be a
[1:14:00] challenge for some of you.
[1:14:05] It's going to start with these vers of
[1:14:07] scriptures right here I'm about to read.
[1:14:10] The Bible says one Psalms 150 verse1.
[1:14:15] Praise ye the Lord.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God in his sanctuary.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Praise him in the firminant of his
[1:14:22] power.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Praise him for his mighty acts.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Now, as we go through the scripture,
[1:14:28] recognize praise doesn't just stop in
[1:14:31] the sanctuary.
[1:14:33] But it's going to keep saying, Amen.
[1:14:35] It's going to keep giving us reasons to
[1:14:37] give him praise.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; It says, "Praise him in the firmament of
[1:14:41] his power. Praise him for his mighty
[1:14:44] acts. Praise him according to his
[1:14:47] excellent greatness.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Praise him with the sound of the
[1:14:50] trumpet. Praise him with the sulties and
[1:14:53] heart.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Praise him with the timberal and dance."
[1:14:56] Oh my.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; You mean dancing is all right in your
[1:15:00] praise?
[1:15:03] I told you it's going to be a challenge
[1:15:05] to some of us,
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Praise him with the string instruments
[1:15:09] and organs.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Praise him upon the loud symbols. My
[1:15:13] Where's the symbols? The symbols are on
[1:15:16] the drums.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Not in Africa. Right here in Calgary.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; According to the Bible. Right.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Praise him upon the high sounding
[1:15:32] symbols.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Let everything that hath breath
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Praise ye the Lord.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Now, let's give God a hand clap of
[1:15:44] praise. [cheering]
[1:15:47] [applause]
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; You can have your seats.
[1:15:56] You know, last night we took a a a
[1:15:58] title, spirit and truth. Well, this
[1:16:02] morning, even in the verse of scriptures
[1:16:04] we just read, the Bible says that the
[1:16:06] true worshippers when they come to
[1:16:09] worship, they're going to worship in
[1:16:11] spirit and in truth.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, uh by the grace of God,
[1:16:16] I think we identified the spirit and the
[1:16:19] truth last night. But let's identify the
[1:16:22] worshiper this morning.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look, my subject, my title is
[1:16:26] a revelation of worship. Hallelujah.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; A revelation of worship.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Now when it comes to worship, it's a
[1:16:35] very very sticky area.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; And what makes it sticky is that we when
[1:16:41] we think of worship, what we do is we
[1:16:44] concentrate on sound.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Worship is not Hallelujah. the dictation
[1:16:52] of sound.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Real worship is a person. Hallelujah.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Real worship is a
[1:16:59] revelation. Amen.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; But what's happened is we've made
[1:17:04] worship our sound. We may worship how
[1:17:06] the piano is played. We may worship uh
[1:17:10] how the drums are played or the string
[1:17:12] instruments and all these different
[1:17:13] things. Yes, that's a part of it. But
[1:17:15] worship is a true revelation. Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus told this woman that the true
[1:17:20] worshipper, he said, "You worship and
[1:17:22] you know not what you worship. He wasn't
[1:17:24] talking about an instrument."
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; It was a revelation inside what he was
[1:17:29] talking about.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; So, as I'm preaching this morning, I
[1:17:32] want you to ask yourself, [screaming] do
[1:17:34] I have the revelation?
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But, but what we've done,
[1:17:38] we've made worship about music and about
[1:17:42] this artist and that artist. That's a
[1:17:44] part of it. Hallelujah. But we not
[1:17:46] worshiping people.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're worshiping one God.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand something this
[1:17:54] morning. Every song that was sung in the
[1:17:57] right channel was only to one person in
[1:18:00] this church.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; And that wasn't to any personal
[1:18:06] individual. It was unto the almighty
[1:18:08] God.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the one I want to
[1:18:12] receive my worship.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now we know that through a
[1:18:16] vindicated prophet he said God the word
[1:18:19] God means what? An object of [screaming]
[1:18:22] worship.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; So while you're worshiping Amen.
[1:18:25] Hallelujah. Your worship really
[1:18:28] [screaming] tells what's the image of
[1:18:30] God in your p in your mind.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; For those of you who may never clap your
[1:18:37] hands, who who may never stand to your
[1:18:39] feet, who may never exalt the Lord, it
[1:18:42] shows what you think about him.
[1:18:45] Hallelujah. The Bible says, "Praise him
[1:18:48] for his mighty acts.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Praise him for his power. Praise him in
[1:18:53] the sanctuary." Hallelujah. Praise him
[1:18:56] for his goodness. Praise him for his
[1:18:58] healing power. [cheering]
[1:19:01] I'm saying today in this church,
[1:19:03] everybody should have a reason to give
[1:19:05] God praise.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; But what I want you to understand,
[1:19:10] Hallelujah. Nobody [screaming] in here
[1:19:13] has a patent on how we should give God
[1:19:16] praise.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. There's a rumor.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; There's a rumor that goes around in
[1:19:32] churches and I've seen it all over the
[1:19:35] world when it comes to worship. And you
[1:19:37] know, and no matter where you go, they
[1:19:40] always say that this rumor, they say
[1:19:42] that black people are the only ones who
[1:19:45] shop.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Is that just a rumor?
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all smiling.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is it a rumor or Hallelujah
[1:20:00] or is it that nobody has a patent on
[1:20:04] reasons to shout for God?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And that's what it
[1:20:08] should be. Amen.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; You know, we we we we know that the
[1:20:11] prophet said, "The further up north you
[1:20:13] go, the colder it get." Hallelujah.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Is that the truth?
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. Thank you. We want
[1:20:23] to Hallelujah. deal with some of these
[1:20:25] myths
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; that have been Hallelujah. put about in
[1:20:29] the church. Hallelujah. Just because I'm
[1:20:31] in Canada, that doesn't mean I don't I I
[1:20:33] I I shouldn't dance.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Or I shouldn't clap my hands. If it's in
[1:20:39] the Bible, I got a right to do it.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; But the thing of it is is, hallelujah.
[1:20:45] We want to do it by revelation. Not
[1:20:47] because somebody else is doing it, not
[1:20:50] because [screaming] it's a part of my
[1:20:51] culture.
[1:20:53] God don't care about your culture.
[1:20:58] [applause]
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Brother D, where I'm from, we're quiet.
[1:21:02] We want to steal small voice.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Church, let me say it like this. There
[1:21:09] are some there are some words I may deal
[1:21:12] with today that may challenge you.
[1:21:14] Hallelujah. In heaven, there won't be a
[1:21:16] word. There won't be a person called an
[1:21:19] introvert.
[1:21:23] Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But let's get into it. Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; I told you it was going to be
[1:21:31] challenging because what we've done,
[1:21:34] we've we've we we've made worship about
[1:21:37] the sound, about the music, about the
[1:21:39] instruments and all these things. And
[1:21:41] our worship should be a revelation.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Your worship should be testifying of who
[1:21:47] you're worshiping. Amen. But you know
[1:21:49] when we look in the scripture, Jesus was
[1:21:51] telling her, "You worship, you know not
[1:21:53] what you worship her." But he says, "We
[1:21:56] know who we worship." Now, if you see me
[1:21:58] kicking and dancing and screaming and
[1:21:59] holling or crying or whatever, raising
[1:22:01] my hand, trust me, I'm doing that
[1:22:04] because it's something that's that's
[1:22:06] reflecting Hallelujah. reflecting God.
[1:22:09] Hallelujah. And it causes me to give him
[1:22:12] praise.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, church, as I look at it, if
[1:22:17] I look at worship and I begin to think
[1:22:19] about it,
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Let me hit you with something real
[1:22:24] quick. You know, and and what's happened
[1:22:27] is uh [clears throat] we may worship
[1:22:30] this this nice steel thing and my
[1:22:33] culture this and my church this and my
[1:22:35] church that. He said, "Praise God in the
[1:22:37] sanctuary."
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; But look, listen to what your own
[1:22:41] prophet said. Now, the prophet says, "I
[1:22:43] like to worship." Amen.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't you now we don't come."
[1:22:48] Oh my. Now, this when I read this,
[1:22:50] Hallelujah. It it it just shattered some
[1:22:52] of the things I've heard in church. It
[1:22:55] shattered some of the things that I
[1:22:56] heard in [clears throat] the end time
[1:22:58] ministry. Hallelujah. Because you know
[1:22:59] what we do? I've heard this. I used to
[1:23:01] be a song leader. So, this right here is
[1:23:03] very near and dear to me. Hallelujah.
[1:23:05] You know, I will hear preachers say,
[1:23:07] "Hey, let's get the worship out the way
[1:23:09] because the best part of the service is
[1:23:11] the preaching of the word.
[1:23:15] I'm sure most of us has heard that.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; I know you're afraid to say amen.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; But listen what the prophet of God says.
[1:23:24] He says, "I like to worship. Don't you?"
[1:23:26] Now, we don't come to church just to
[1:23:29] hear a sermon.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said that goes with it. But we
[1:23:38] come to church to worship. Worship in
[1:23:41] spirit and in truth. You've heard the
[1:23:44] truth. That's the word. See, now to
[1:23:47] worship is to express yourself
[1:23:49] [screaming]
[1:23:50] to him.
[1:23:54] This is coming from a vindicated
[1:23:55] [screaming]
[1:23:56] prophet. It says once I've heard the
[1:23:59] word, I have a right to express myself.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Why? Because something about God has
[1:24:06] been revealed to me.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what we've done, we say,
[1:24:12] "Hey, let's just get this. Let's do this
[1:24:14] 15 minutes, 20 minutes, or whatever. Get
[1:24:16] it out the way so we can hear the word."
[1:24:18] God is [screaming] an object of worship.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; And I'll say this to you, word only
[1:24:27] people. We got the word, brother Digs.
[1:24:29] We're so beyond this, so beyond that.
[1:24:31] Well, let me say this. When we get to
[1:24:33] heaven, ain't going to be no preaching.
[1:24:39] Ain't going [screaming] to be no
[1:24:40] preaching in heaven.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; The only thing heaven is going to be
[1:24:44] full of is a bunch of worshippers.
[1:24:49] [applause and cheering]
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God [screaming] says
[1:24:52] what you are over here is what you're
[1:24:54] going to be over there. So if you can't
[1:24:57] worship God here, you're surely not
[1:24:59] going to be there. [laughter]
[1:25:01] Because the Bible says, hallelujah. In
[1:25:03] that day, every knee will bow. Every
[1:25:06] tongue will confess that he is Lord.
[1:25:12] [applause and cheering]
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; See, it always comes back to who you
[1:25:16] believe God is.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Brother say, "I got a gift. I can
[1:25:23] preach. I can." Your gift ain't gonna
[1:25:26] mean nothing in heaven
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; because the giver himself is going to be
[1:25:30] in display.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; It's going to be all about [screaming]
[1:25:33] worship.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; The greatest preacher you can think
[1:25:36] about is going to be a worshipper
[1:25:38] standing right beside you.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Paul a worshipper. Jeremiah a
[1:25:50] worshshiper. David a worshipper. Brother
[1:25:53] Brand, I'm a worshshiper.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Biscoll a worshshiper.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Billy Graham, hallelujah, a worshshiper.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Or Roberts, a worshshiper.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Diggs, you including
[1:26:11] them." The prophet included them in this
[1:26:13] message. He said they were a part of
[1:26:15] those three angels.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; They had [screaming] a part to play.
[1:26:22] Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; See, that's what we do. We cancel people
[1:26:26] out according to their worship.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; But look, he said, "We don't come to
[1:26:34] church just to hear a good sermon."
[1:26:36] Hallelujah. We come to worship him.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Because God is the object of worship.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; And we know that the prophet of God
[1:26:42] said, "You going to worship something."
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Some of us worship our jobs. That's why
[1:26:47] we ain't here to church every every time
[1:26:49] the doors open. Some of us worship
[1:26:52] family members. That's why, hallelujah,
[1:26:54] we can't go any further in God.
[1:26:55] Hallelujah. And different things we may
[1:26:57] worship that's in the place of God.
[1:26:59] Hallelujah. But God wants to move that
[1:27:02] all the all of that out the way and give
[1:27:04] you a revelation that he is the only one
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; that you should be giving arms to.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Now you think about it. Do you know what
[1:27:13] you worship
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; or who you worship? It's a revelation.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. which goes way
[1:27:21] beyond the sound of things. Even in the
[1:27:24] beginning, hallelujah. Look, when when
[1:27:27] God came down to have fellowship with
[1:27:30] Adam and Eve, what did they do? They
[1:27:32] worship.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say this, and I want
[1:27:35] it to be real plain. That had nothing to
[1:27:38] do with the piano.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; There was no [screaming] piano there.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; It was just two people. Hallelujah.
[1:27:47] Created in the image of God. And when
[1:27:50] God came down, they offered up worship
[1:27:52] to him. Hallelujah. They were giving
[1:27:54] back the life that they that he gave to
[1:27:56] them. Hal, [screaming]
[1:27:57] it was a revelation to be in God's
[1:28:00] presence.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you think about it. The
[1:28:04] Bible says wherever two or three are
[1:28:07] gathered, there would I also be in the
[1:28:09] midst. And you mean to tell me you're
[1:28:11] not going to worship?
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God came down and see I told
[1:28:19] you I was going to challenge you this
[1:28:20] morning.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Great.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because like I say, we've
[1:28:23] put it on our background and where we
[1:28:26] come from and our family and traditions
[1:28:28] and all these things that should only be
[1:28:31] about God.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; But look church, as we look at the
[1:28:36] worship and I ain't going to be long.
[1:28:37] I'm about to close. Hallelujah. As we
[1:28:40] look as we look into these things, he
[1:28:42] says, "And he's the spirit." God is a
[1:28:46] spirit and they that worship him must
[1:28:48] worship him in spirit and in truth. And
[1:28:51] God, the very word God means object of
[1:28:53] worship. So God likes to be worshiped by
[1:28:57] his children. Why?
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Why does God push us in these
[1:29:00] atmospheres to worship? There's a
[1:29:02] there's a purpose behind it. He said,
[1:29:05] hallelujah. He likes to be worshiped by
[1:29:06] his children that we can be free and not
[1:29:10] bound down in yolks. [screaming] So
[1:29:13] worship comes to set us free.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Worship comes to loosen the yolks
[1:29:19] [screaming] around our necks.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; You can tell [screaming] how free
[1:29:28] somebody is by their worship.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; You can watch a husband and wife and see
[1:29:36] who's angry.
[1:29:38] That's
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; right. [laughter]
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You [snorts] can see a man
[1:29:43] in church and he's clapping his hands
[1:29:44] and praising the Lord and our wife
[1:29:46] looking at him like
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; she knows something that we don't know.
[1:29:53] Hallelujah.
[1:29:55] Church, listen. He says, "But we can
[1:29:59] exercise our faith in him and believe it
[1:30:02] and not be ashamed." That's the reason
[1:30:05] why we don't have much expression in
[1:30:07] church because we're ashamed. We're
[1:30:10] ashamed. What? Somebody may think that I
[1:30:12] get around the church and run.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; We're ashamed that when we're hearing
[1:30:16] the word and tears start to come down
[1:30:18] your eyes and somebody may come, you
[1:30:20] say, "What you crying for?"
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; It's an expression
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; of how good God has been.
[1:30:28] [applause]
[1:30:29] [cheering]
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; And I know it's going to be a challenge
[1:30:34] for some of you because spiritually in
[1:30:37] these areas, some of us are lazy.
[1:30:40] You got it.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; And we'll blame it on coordination.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; And you feel like because I'm not
[1:30:54] coordinated, I just ain't going to clap
[1:30:56] my hands at all. That has nothing to do
[1:30:59] with it.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; What does God mean to you?
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Is he worthy of the clapping of your
[1:31:08] hands? Because the Bible says,
[1:31:10] hallelujah, clap your hands all ye
[1:31:13] saints.
[1:31:15] [applause]
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; No, I'm not trying to excite you, but I
[1:31:23] want you to see, hallelujah, your
[1:31:25] revelation of the object you worship.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; But look, church, he says, "Does it make
[1:31:35] our face so our oh my, this is this is
[1:31:38] going to hit real real close to home."
[1:31:40] He said, "It doesn't make our face red
[1:31:43] to testify of the glory of Jesus
[1:31:45] Christ."
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Now, he's not talking to me
[1:31:50] cuz my face don't turn red when it comes
[1:31:52] to talking about God.
[1:31:55] Hallelujah. When I feel ashamed about
[1:31:57] something, my face don't turn red. It
[1:31:58] hides real good. But some of you, your
[1:32:01] cheeks are turning red right now.
[1:32:04] [laughter]
[1:32:06] Hallelujah. But not in a bad way today.
[1:32:08] Hallelujah.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Listen. He says, "What is it?" God
[1:32:12] condescending to his creation. God wants
[1:32:15] to be worshiped. The word God means
[1:32:18] object of worship. And it's God trying
[1:32:21] to condition his people.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we say, "Well, that artist, I
[1:32:27] can't sing that." It's God trying to
[1:32:30] condition his people.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; My oh my. God trying to condition his
[1:32:36] people so that he can get from them what
[1:32:40] he created them for.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; So in your worship, God is trying to
[1:32:45] pull something out of you that's already
[1:32:48] there.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; And you're thinking it's just about the
[1:32:52] song. No, that worship is going to bring
[1:32:55] forth a release.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's something inside of
[1:32:58] you hiding, but that worship can bring
[1:33:00] it out.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Some of you may be bogged down in
[1:33:04] sadness, but that worship can bring real
[1:33:06] joy out. Some of you might have sickness
[1:33:10] in your body, but that worship can bring
[1:33:12] forth the healing. There's something
[1:33:14] inside of you. Hallelujah. There's a
[1:33:16] revelation in you that only worship can
[1:33:18] bring out.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. church. When I had cancer in
[1:33:24] my brain, hallelujah, God is
[1:33:27] intentional.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He allowed that to happen.
[1:33:30] Why? Because there was something inside
[1:33:32] of me, but the only way I could get it
[1:33:34] out, only way it could come out is that
[1:33:36] I first had to have cancer.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why cancer? Because cancer
[1:33:45] was the only thing that could bring out
[1:33:47] the revelation of Jehovah Rafi,
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; that God is a healer. Hallelujah. So God
[1:33:53] allowed something to happen just to get
[1:33:55] me in the place where I will worship and
[1:33:57] the revelation will unfold out of me as
[1:34:00] I [screaming] worship.
[1:34:03] As I gave God praise, the healer came on
[1:34:06] the scene. Hallelujah. And the healer,
[1:34:08] hallelujah, destroyed what was going on
[1:34:11] in my flesh and gave me a revelation
[1:34:14] [screaming] that still holds true to
[1:34:16] today.
[1:34:18] Once you become a real worshipper,
[1:34:20] [screaming]
[1:34:21] that revelation will follow you through
[1:34:23] eternity.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; we go from Adam and Eve and they worship
[1:34:37] God just being in his presence.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Are we in his presence?
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Now, think about this. I want you to
[1:34:46] think about this. That's right. Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; What reason did they have?
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Was it a car?
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Was it a house? [snorts]
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Was it the children that he gave them?
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Was it a good job?
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; They worshiped him just because he was
[1:35:04] God.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; That was the revelation.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Just because he's God. He don't have to
[1:35:15] do anything.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; God, just come down and I'll give you
[1:35:18] what you deserve.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; That's what Adam and Eve did.
[1:35:21] Hallelujah. They didn't worship him
[1:35:23] because of material things. They
[1:35:25] worshiped because they were glad to be
[1:35:26] in his presence.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; They worship because God was faithful.
[1:35:30] They worship because God Hallelujah.
[1:35:32] Even though he was God, he was never too
[1:35:34] busy to come down and show them that he
[1:35:37] loves them.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; But for us, we look for reasons. Lord,
[1:35:41] bless me with this and bless me with
[1:35:43] that. and [screaming] I'll give you
[1:35:44] praise.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; It wasn't so in the beginning.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; See, so you look at the object, they
[1:35:56] worshiped him just because he was God.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He would come down. It
[1:36:02] wasn't because of a good paycheck.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was Adam. Adam didn't
[1:36:06] worship God because of Eve. He worshiped
[1:36:09] because he was God.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. God came down and showed himself.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now we're in the
[1:36:16] presence of that same God. And we need a
[1:36:18] reason.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; My my my.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; You might be saying right now, you know,
[1:36:26] if somebody else shout, I'mma shout. You
[1:36:27] know, we do it. That's that's what you
[1:36:29] call learn behavior.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; That's not revelation.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, if we go to the next
[1:36:37] stage,
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve has two boys. Hallelujah.
[1:36:42] That we that they raised up in their
[1:36:44] house. But then there comes a time where
[1:36:47] they have to go and what? Worship.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:52] And let me say this to you. In that
[1:36:54] process of time when they went to
[1:36:57] worship, hallelujah, there was no
[1:36:59] [screaming] piano there.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There was no horns.
[1:37:04] [screaming]
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; There were no string instruments.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; All they were going to do is testify of
[1:37:10] the God that they believed in.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; But now they were going to show God
[1:37:15] their revelation of him in worship.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Not by sound
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; but by revelation.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Now you look the Bible says Cain went
[1:37:26] first and Cain started to worship. He
[1:37:29] gave him of the first fruit of his
[1:37:31] offering. You know if you know something
[1:37:34] came from the ground. It may have been
[1:37:36] apples or oranges or or tangerines or
[1:37:38] vegetables. Whatever it was, he came and
[1:37:40] brought that before God. Now I want you
[1:37:42] to understand something. It wasn't
[1:37:45] something moldy.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; It wasn't something stale.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; It was something fresh.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; It was the best he had.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; And he came and gave that to God. And
[1:37:57] God said, "Get that mess out of here.
[1:38:02] I don't want something nice and cute and
[1:38:04] pretty.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; I don't want something that you think I
[1:38:08] ought to want. I want your revelation.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; I want you. Hallelujah. See, where Cain
[1:38:14] messed it up. Hallelujah. God didn't
[1:38:16] want fruit. God wanted life.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; And what we do, [screaming] we'll give
[1:38:22] God our gifts, but we won't give him our
[1:38:24] life. Your gift is no good unless
[1:38:27] there's a life behind it. Your worship
[1:38:30] is no good unless there's a [laughter]
[1:38:31] life behind it. [cheering and applause]
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; So what? You got a good voice and no
[1:38:38] Holy Ghost. That don't mean nothing.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; So what you can bring down the house
[1:38:43] with your instrument, that don't mean
[1:38:45] nothing unless the Holy Ghost is behind
[1:38:46] it.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; And that's what Cain did. He gave God
[1:38:52] his fruit, but he wouldn't give God his
[1:38:54] life.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; And God said, "I don't want that mess.
[1:39:00] Keep in mind on the outward appearance
[1:39:04] it looked good.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; He was saying God should accept this and
[1:39:09] he brought it to the Lord and the Bible
[1:39:11] say God rejected it and Cain walked away
[1:39:14] mad. Then Abel comes
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Abel comes.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Abel comes with that that lamb.
[1:39:26] He's bringing it into God's presence.
[1:39:28] Hallelujah. And the prophet said he
[1:39:30] believed he had got a rock and he
[1:39:33] started to hack it up.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; He started to kill it. Amen. See, what
[1:39:36] was he doing? He was worshiping.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; First thing, your worship should always
[1:39:44] bring us back to the life.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your worship should be
[1:39:49] revealing the life. Hallelujah.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; And look, hallelujah. Abel. Abel now has
[1:39:56] the lamb. Hallelujah. Which is a type of
[1:39:59] Christ in his worship.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; And now he's hagging it up. Hagging it
[1:40:03] up. Why? So that he can pour out blood
[1:40:06] upon the altar.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; All of that was being revealed in his
[1:40:11] worship. His mom and daddy was standing
[1:40:13] there like, "Wow, who told him?
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Who told him, hallelujah, that I had two
[1:40:21] men in my life?"
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:25] Hallelujah. Look, church, Adam and Eve
[1:40:28] were not there. I mean, Cain and Abel
[1:40:30] were not there when God led Adam and Eve
[1:40:33] [screaming] out of the garden clothed in
[1:40:36] skins of animals,
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; dripping in blood.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; So, where did he learn [screaming] how
[1:40:42] to worship like that?
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; It was a revelation.
[1:40:47] Hallelujah.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Your revelation should be revealing
[1:40:53] something in your worship.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; It shouldn't be just a good song.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Because in this worship, there was no
[1:41:00] piano. There was no drums. [screaming]
[1:41:02] There was no hordes. There was no
[1:41:04] strings. It was only an unveiling of the
[1:41:06] life inside.
[1:41:10] [applause]
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Let's get the [screaming] life back in
[1:41:13] church.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; I can imagine Adam and Eve are standing
[1:41:22] there.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; And they're watching Cain. They're like,
[1:41:25] "Wow, God didn't accept that." And now
[1:41:28] they're watching Abel and they're like,
[1:41:30] "Oh my,
[1:41:33] did you tell him?" Eve's looking at
[1:41:36] Adam. Did you tell him what I did?
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; How do he know that it was blood?
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:41] How does he know
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; that it takes blood to forgive us of our
[1:41:45] sins?
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; How does he know that in the years to
[1:41:50] come there will be a sacrificial lamb?
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; All of that was revealed in his worship.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't even teach him that.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:42:05] Hallelujah.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Church, when you really find Hallelujah,
[1:42:14] the real object of worship, it'll bring
[1:42:16] out Christ every time.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Church, let's let's look at it where you
[1:42:21] say, "Well, in one place, hallelujah,
[1:42:25] you look at these two boys going forth
[1:42:27] to worship." Now, we have to think about
[1:42:29] it. Hallelujah. What kind of house did
[1:42:32] they grow up in?
[1:42:34] And a lot of times we look at our kids,
[1:42:37] we say, "Man, are you gonna participate
[1:42:40] in church? Are you gonna clap your
[1:42:42] hands? Are you going to sing the song?
[1:42:44] Are you going to do anything?" That's
[1:42:45] what we do as parents. We We're quick to
[1:42:47] criticize our kids and look at them and
[1:42:49] be like, "Come on, get involved."
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; And all they doing is doing what you do.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:58] They're watching your nice, quiet, still
[1:43:00] worship, your no involvement, and all
[1:43:04] they're doing is catching the same
[1:43:05] spirit.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; They're catching the life of your
[1:43:09] worship.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; And they're receiving it because it's
[1:43:13] more easy.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; A young man in my church, I asked him
[1:43:18] one time, I said, and he's a good a good
[1:43:20] a good kid. You know, I like to play
[1:43:22] around with him. You know, I sometimes
[1:43:24] before service, I say, I want you to be
[1:43:26] the loudest one saying, "Amen."
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; And he'll just smile at me.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; And sometimes I'll catch him going out
[1:43:32] taking a water break. Cuz you know, kids
[1:43:34] like to take a water break.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; You know, I'll catch him taking a water
[1:43:36] break. I said, "Man, I ain't heard you
[1:43:38] one time." And he'll say, "Amen."
[1:43:43] So, I know it's in him.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look, church, I asked
[1:43:47] him. I said, "Man, you don't clap your
[1:43:48] hands. You don't do nothing." You know
[1:43:50] what he said to me? He said, "My mom and
[1:43:51] daddy don't."
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:55] learn behavior.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; That's not revelation.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; You think about it. How many of us uh uh
[1:44:03] the way we worship? Hallelujah. We do
[1:44:06] it. Hallelujah. As [clears throat] as as
[1:44:08] a group of of of the church of Calvary.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; This is how we worship in church.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; That's not revelation.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; That's learned behavior. Right.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; You know, people say to me, say,
[1:44:23] "Brother Digs, I just love to come to
[1:44:24] your church." You'd be shocked
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; because me and my pastor are like night
[1:44:29] and day.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's not all over the place.
[1:44:33] He's not running the aisles all the time
[1:44:35] and all these things, but people see me
[1:44:37] and they think everybody in church is
[1:44:38] crazy.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; No, we are individuals with our own
[1:44:43] personal revelation of God.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And my revelation of God and
[1:44:50] how he's been to me may make me act
[1:44:52] different from you, but that don't mean,
[1:44:54] hallelujah, what I do is right and what
[1:44:56] you do is wrong.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Or what you do is right and what I do is
[1:45:00] wrong.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Because it's much more easier to accept
[1:45:02] a quiet spirit than a loud spirit.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; But I'll say this for you. Hallelujah.
[1:45:12] For those of you who think being loud is
[1:45:14] out of order, you couldn't be in heaven
[1:45:17] because the Bible says that the angel
[1:45:19] said, "Holy, holy, holy," till it shook
[1:45:21] heaven. [cheering and applause]
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The sound of this worship
[1:45:27] shook heaven. Hallelujah. Church, we
[1:45:29] need to be shook up again.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; If angels could say, "Holy, holy,
[1:45:33] [screaming] holy, Lord God Almighty,
[1:45:36] holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty."
[1:45:39] And they didn't have a reason. It was
[1:45:41] their job.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; But we got a reason.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; God saved our souls.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; God healed our body. Hallelujah.
[1:45:51] [screaming]
[1:45:52] We got a reason. So our worship should
[1:45:55] still be able to shake heaven.
[1:45:57] [applause]
[1:45:58] [cheering]
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; If I start singing,
[1:46:08] my God is greater.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; My God is stronger.
[1:46:13] God you are.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; God you are healer. Awesome.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Think about the revelation of that.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; My God is greater.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How you going to sing that
[1:46:36] with no expression?
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; How you going to talk about how great
[1:46:43] something is
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; and say I'm an introvert.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; God, you're so great.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; My God is healer.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever been healed?
[1:47:04] Hallelujah.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever been diagnosed with
[1:47:07] something? Hallelujah. Diagnosed with
[1:47:10] something and God comes in and shows his
[1:47:13] greatness. Hallelujah.
[1:47:16] And you don't want me to worship.
[1:47:18] [screaming] You don't want me to give
[1:47:19] him praise. You can't tell my story.
[1:47:23] [cheering]
[1:47:25] How good [screaming] God's been to me.
[1:47:28] You want me to sit down and shut up?
[1:47:31] [screaming] Well, I'm sorry.
[1:47:33] God has allowed me to escape death. God
[1:47:37] has healed my [screaming] body and gave
[1:47:40] me another chance. [cheering] And this
[1:47:42] time, I'm not going to mess it up. This
[1:47:45] time, I'm not going to stop because of
[1:47:47] what other people may think. But I'm
[1:47:49] going to give him praise. [cheering]
[1:47:52] I'm going to worship him.
[1:47:55] [applause]
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; because it's a revelation. [screaming]
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not doing it because it's a duty.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; I'm doing it because it's an expression.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Church.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Awesome in power. Amen.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; That means no matter what happens,
[1:48:24] there's nothing that can ever come your
[1:48:26] way that's stronger than God.
[1:48:28] [applause]
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Nothing [cheering]
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; can ever come your way that's stronger
[1:48:33] than God.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; He's awesome in power.
[1:48:37] W.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; That means when God finishes doing what
[1:48:44] he's doing, we stand there in awe.
[1:48:47] [cheering]
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Because awesome comes from the
[1:48:51] [screaming] root word awe.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; And God leaves us in awe because he's so
[1:48:57] [screaming] great. [cheering]
[1:48:59] Hallelujah.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; I know this is a challenge
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; cuz some of you are still stuck in your
[1:49:09] coaches.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Some of us are still stuck there.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; You know, I don't I don't normally do
[1:49:16] this. I don't normally clap. I don't
[1:49:18] normally ask yourself why.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Is he worthy?
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Is he worthy? It's a revelation.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Listen, church. Hallelujah.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Adam, hallelujah.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Was the father of his home.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; He was the shepherd of his home.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; He was the lead worshipper.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Father, a lot of times your kids look at
[1:49:48] you and they say, "Well, daddy ain't
[1:49:50] giving God praise. Why should I?"
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; All they're doing is picking up your
[1:49:54] mannerisms.
[1:49:56] But it takes a real experience with God
[1:49:58] to break that chain.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; But look, church,
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Adam raises his boys, raises those boys
[1:50:08] in a house of worship.
[1:50:11] [snorts]
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Really? Yes. I want you to catch this
[1:50:15] picture.
[1:50:17] Adam
[1:50:19] never knew anything about the devil.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; The devil never even spoken to Adam.
[1:50:31] [snorts]
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he came to Eve.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; The serpent came to Eve and we knew that
[1:50:39] the serpent, hallelujah, was in power
[1:50:41] with the spirit of the enemy, right?
[1:50:43] Hallelujah. So that that serpent came to
[1:50:45] Eve. He never made it to Adam
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; cuz by the time they all got together,
[1:50:50] God was handing down judgments.
[1:50:52] Hallelujah. And he messed the serpent up
[1:50:55] so bad he couldn't talk anymore.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; So So Adam never even heard the devil's
[1:51:01] voice.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. [laughter]
[1:51:09] [screaming]
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Think about it. It's in your Bible.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They never had a
[1:51:14] conversation.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; God said, "Who told you this?" He said,
[1:51:18] "It was the woman."
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Where'd you get it from the woman? The
[1:51:20] woman said it was the serpent. Then God
[1:51:22] starts handing down judgments and he
[1:51:24] changed the whole body of the serpent
[1:51:26] where the serpent could no longer talk.
[1:51:28] So he never got to Adam. Adam's worship
[1:51:30] was pure.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts]
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; By revelation,
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Adam would lead those boys into worship.
[1:51:41] Hallelujah.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Adam would come to the boys would come
[1:51:45] in there and Adam would start to sing,
[1:51:48] "My God is greater. My God is stronger.
[1:51:53] God, you are higher than any other.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; There was some days where he could
[1:52:00] reflect and he realized that he was once
[1:52:02] a god and now he's just a human being.
[1:52:05] And you may have sang songs like nobody
[1:52:08] greater.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Nobody greater.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Nobody greater than you.
[1:52:17] Hallelujah. [laughter]
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Adam, hallelujah.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Now he's in a sinful condition.
[1:52:24] Hallelujah. But all he could think about
[1:52:26] was where he came from. Hallelujah. Now
[1:52:29] Adam is in he's in Eden. Hallelujah.
[1:52:31] He's driven out of Eden. Hallelujah. But
[1:52:33] he has a remembrance of what perfection
[1:52:35] was. And all he could do was worship by
[1:52:37] perfection. Hallelujah. Adam can say, "I
[1:52:39] searched all over.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Couldn't find nobody.
[1:52:44] I looked high and low. Still couldn't
[1:52:48] find nobody.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Nobody greater,
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; nobody greater.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Nobody greater than him. See, that was
[1:52:59] Adam's testimony.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't know what failure
[1:53:05] [screaming] was like until sin came in.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; So his worship was by revelation. Amen.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; All he could do was exalt God
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; cuz he was created in the image of God.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; All he could talk about was perfection
[1:53:22] in the goodness of God. Hallelujah.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; God was never a failure to him.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He never lost a battle.
[1:53:30] [cheering]
[1:53:34] [applause]
[1:53:36] [cheering and screaming]
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; He could only sing songs of victory.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; He could only sing songs of triumph.
[1:53:44] He didn't know what it was like to lose.
[1:53:45] [screaming]
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; You know, culturally,
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; we have old spirituals,
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; slave songs.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to hide
[1:54:03] behind
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; that old mountain.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; I ain't hiding behind no mountain.
[1:54:11] My God say speak to that mountain and
[1:54:13] it'll move. [cheering]
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; I ain't hiding behind no mountain. I
[1:54:19] ain't singing no old negro spirituals.
[1:54:22] [applause and cheering]
[1:54:23] My God say speak to the mountain and the
[1:54:25] mountain will get out your way.
[1:54:28] Be careful what you let come out of your
[1:54:30] mouth. Stop singing those songs that
[1:54:33] don't identify who you are.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Sing songs of revelation.
[1:54:40] Amen.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Hiding behind the mountain and all that
[1:54:47] fool. I ain't hiding behind no mountain.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; God says whatsoever you say. [cheering]
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; If you if you say it and believe it,
[1:54:56] what you said will come to pass.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] Why? It's a
[1:55:01] revelation.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Your worship is a revelation. [cheering]
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; And I could go on and on with that,
[1:55:16] [snorts]
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; you know. And you've heard me say this.
[1:55:18] We come together and we Hallelujah. I
[1:55:22] can only imagine
[1:55:24] what it be like. Sounds so anointed,
[1:55:27] don't surrounded by your glory.
[1:55:34] I don't like that song.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz I don't have to imagine.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be there.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be surrounded around his
[1:55:46] glory.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to hold his hand. I'm going to
[1:55:50] cut. Hallelujah. I'm going to look at
[1:55:51] his eyes. Hallelujah. I'm going to
[1:55:53] follow him around heaven. I don't have
[1:55:56] to [screaming] imagine.
[1:55:57] I'm living in the reality of the
[1:56:00] revealed word.
[1:56:02] It's a revelation [screaming]
[1:56:04] to me.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; What will I do? I will give him praise.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; But you look,
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't teach those boys worship of
[1:56:20] defeat.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Because all they all he knew was a good
[1:56:24] God.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; God, great God, Jehovah.
[1:56:31] Nobody greater. Hallelujah.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; See church, and you think about that.
[1:56:36] Behold, he comes riding on a cloud,
[1:56:40] shining like the sun. As the trumpet
[1:56:42] calls, lift your voice. This is the year
[1:56:46] of jubilee.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; My worship puts me in a jubilee year.
[1:56:53] [cheering]
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; And what does jubilee speak of? Jubilee
[1:56:56] speaks of freedom.
[1:56:58] When I sing, I sing because I'm free.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; I worship because God has set me free.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; This is my year of Jubilee.
[1:57:10] [screaming]
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not bound to alcohol.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not bound to cigarettes.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; God has set me free.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering]
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:57:26] Some of you can't worship because you
[1:57:27] bound.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; You got things in your life that's a
[1:57:31] reflection before your face.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; And the devil says, "Don't you raise
[1:57:35] your hand.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; You know you got a problem."
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; But church, there's also a song we sing.
[1:57:43] Hallelujah. It says, "I'm not going to
[1:57:45] wait till the battle is over.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to shout now."
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:57:52] [cheering]
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Some of you waiting, hallelujah, till
[1:57:56] you get the victory. No, you worship
[1:57:59] because you already know you got the
[1:58:01] victory.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; You're already healed.
[1:58:08] I said already healed. No matter what it
[1:58:11] looks like, you're already [screaming]
[1:58:13] healed.
[1:58:15] Amen.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; And your worship should reflect your
[1:58:18] revelation.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; So we can see according to Revelation.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; They worship not according to sound.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; See, cuz I can take y'all to South
[1:58:38] Carolina and some of y'all wouldn't be
[1:58:41] able to follow me because you're worried
[1:58:43] about the sound. M
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; so I can start take you back. Get right
[1:58:48] church and let's go home. Oh, get right
[1:58:51] church and let's go home. See, like some
[1:58:53] of you looking at me now,
[1:58:56] but there'll be a whole group of people
[1:58:58] right there with me singing get right
[1:59:00] church and let's go home.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz they got a revelation of what I'm
[1:59:03] singing. Hallelujah. Not the sound, not
[1:59:06] the style that Hallelujah. One of these
[1:59:08] old mornings and it won't be long.
[1:59:10] You're going to look for me and I'll be
[1:59:13] going on home and I'll be going up
[1:59:15] heaven where we sing and shout and there
[1:59:17] will be nobody there to put me out.
[1:59:21] [cheering]
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; It's not a sound, it's a revelation.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; So that's why I'm living [screaming]
[1:59:29] right down here on this side because I
[1:59:32] know there is another home for me.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; And the crazy part is
[1:59:45] we'll put words up on the stream
[1:59:48] and some of you still won't open your
[1:59:50] mouths.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; That's cuz you don't have a revelation.
[1:59:57] But if you're singing something that's
[1:59:58] been revealed to you,
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; we love and and and
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Don't bring uncertain sound
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; about what I'm about to say,
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; but we love sad songs of deliverance.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Sad songs of deliverance.
[2:00:18] You unravel me
[2:00:22] with a meloyy.
[2:00:25] I'm no longer a slave. [screaming]
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; You should have been realized you
[2:00:35] weren't a slave.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; The Bible says perfect love castes out
[2:00:41] all fear.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; I don't need to hear a song to realize
[2:00:45] that I'm free.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't need to hear a song
[2:00:48] to realize that I got perfect faith.
[2:00:50] Hallelujah.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; But it's something about those sad songs
[2:00:53] of deliverance. They we identify with
[2:00:56] them more. You know why? Because we feel
[2:00:58] like we're not capable.
[2:01:01] [laughter]
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; But I told you last night, if that
[2:01:04] spirit that raised up Christ from the
[2:01:06] dead dwells in you, it'll also quicken
[2:01:09] your mortal body. So you don't have to
[2:01:11] be afraid. Jesus say, "Fear not, little
[2:01:14] flock. It is me. It is I." [applause]
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; But then church, as we go through the
[2:01:24] scriptures and we look, there's a man
[2:01:26] named Moses.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my. [snorts]
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Now we're going to transition to the
[2:01:33] sound.
[2:01:35] There's a man named Moses where God told
[2:01:37] him, "I've heard the cry of my people."
[2:01:40] Why do we worship? He said, "I've heard
[2:01:43] the cry of my people and I've come down,
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; but I'm sending you." He said, "I want
[2:01:49] you to go to Pharaoh and I want you to
[2:01:51] tell him, "Let my people go so that they
[2:01:55] can go and serve me."
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; So the only reason why you're free today
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; is so you can be a worshiper.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; The only reason why God brought you the
[2:02:09] message of the hour is so you can get
[2:02:12] away from Egypt. Hallelujah. And become
[2:02:14] a worshshiper.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[2:02:17] That was the only reason why he sent
[2:02:19] Moses. Hallelujah. To break the chains
[2:02:22] of the enemy that they can go and
[2:02:24] worship the true and living God.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; But then think about it, church. When
[2:02:32] God comes
[2:02:34] and he begins to show himself mighty and
[2:02:37] strong and he begins to do great things.
[2:02:39] Hallelujah. Think about it. If you can
[2:02:41] see it before it happens,
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; that ought to get something out of you.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; But look, church, uh, I like talking
[2:02:50] about Miriam.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; And Miriam was in bondage.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; And in bondage, hallelujah. They created
[2:03:00] an instrument called a tambourine.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; They did.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; It's in the Bible.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not making this up. Amen.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; That instrument was created in bondage.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; But then the Bible says, let's go to uh
[2:03:17] Exodus 15.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Everybody all right.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Exodus
[2:03:27] 15.
[2:03:29] I ain't going to be too much longer.
[2:03:35] I want you today to challenge your own
[2:03:38] revelation of God.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Is it pure enough to get some worship
[2:03:44] out of you?
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Right now, if I was to do a survey,
[2:03:55] I was to do a survey and run through
[2:03:56] this church or just by a show of hands
[2:03:59] by asking this question. Is there
[2:04:02] anybody in here that God has failed?
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Raise your hand.
[2:04:08] If you raise your hand, I tell you, you
[2:04:09] a liar.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Because there's one thing God can do,
[2:04:17] and that's he cannot fail.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; And the other thing that God cannot do,
[2:04:21] God cannot tell a lie.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if he said it, it's got
[2:04:26] to happen.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; And there's never been a challenge.
[2:04:30] Hallelujah. or anyone ever challenged
[2:04:32] God where God was defeated.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, he's never failed any of
[2:04:38] us.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; So, what reason do you have not to give
[2:04:41] him praise?
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, there are things,
[2:04:46] personal things within us that hinders
[2:04:49] our worship.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; It's our culture. It's the sound and
[2:04:53] what we think of it in that moment.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; When we should be thinking of God only.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; I like to draw out this scenario.
[2:05:06] Brother Paul, think about it. What if we
[2:05:09] all one by one come to the gates of
[2:05:13] heaven
[2:05:15] [snorts]
[2:05:16] and there's a mighty angel standing
[2:05:18] there and he says, "The only way you can
[2:05:21] get in here is if you worship."
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some of us wouldn't know what to
[2:05:27] do
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; because we've never done it on this
[2:05:30] side.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; And then some of us will be like, "Man,
[2:05:35] I I want to go to heaven. I don't know
[2:05:37] what to do, but I'm going to make
[2:05:38] something up cuz I I I [laughter]
[2:05:41] want to get in.
[2:05:44] Hallelujah.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to say something to you
[2:05:46] and it may sound connor. If you're not a
[2:05:48] worshshiper, you need to go home and
[2:05:50] practice."
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Go get in the mirror and
[2:05:56] start saying, "Lord, I thank you."
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're worthy.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, you've been so good to me.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, when I couldn't see a way out, you
[2:06:09] made a way.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; When my back was against the wall
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; and it looked like things were over, you
[2:06:16] made a way. You moved mountains. You
[2:06:19] caused walls to [screaming] fall. And
[2:06:22] I'm standing here today.
[2:06:24] only because you made a way. Hallelujah.
[2:06:28] [screaming]
[2:06:29] When you begin to talk about the
[2:06:31] goodness of God, I guarantee you, you
[2:06:34] will find a reason to give him praise.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; I guarantee it.
[2:06:41] Hallelujah. [cheering and applause]
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; See, we don't spend enough time to think
[2:06:45] about how good God has been.
[2:06:49] But I guarantee you if you set a little
[2:06:51] time aside,
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; you know what we do as
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; husbands and wives when things are
[2:06:57] challenging, you know, you go to the
[2:06:59] counselor. I've seen this. I've never
[2:07:01] done it, but you go to a counselor and
[2:07:03] the counselor say, "Hey, you know, the
[2:07:05] wife is just disgusted in you, brother."
[2:07:08] Hallelujah. Husband's just disgusted in
[2:07:10] you, sister. And that counselor say,
[2:07:12] "Hey, how long y'all been married? We've
[2:07:14] been married such and such amount of
[2:07:15] years." She said, "This is what I want
[2:07:17] you to do. I want you to write down all
[2:07:20] his good and I want you to write down
[2:07:22] all his bad."
[2:07:24] And as she started looking at that bad,
[2:07:26] she starts to get even more and more
[2:07:28] disgusted because that list is very very
[2:07:31] very very very [screaming]
[2:07:35] very
[2:07:36] long.
[2:07:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But then when
[2:07:42] she starts to look at the good,
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; even though that list might be shorter,
[2:07:47] it's more meaningful.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's considerate.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He loves God.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; He prays for me when I'm sick.
[2:07:56] Hallelujah. He stands on my side. He
[2:07:59] don't let anybody talk about me.
[2:08:00] Hallelujah. And when she starts to look
[2:08:02] at all those things, Hallelujah. She
[2:08:04] starts to realize why she fell in love
[2:08:07] with him.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; And all the bad things don't mean
[2:08:10] nothing. Hallelujah. Church, I'll be the
[2:08:12] first one to say, hallelujah, I've had
[2:08:15] battle after battle after battle and
[2:08:17] sometimes relentless battles.
[2:08:19] Hallelujah. But my God has showed up
[2:08:22] time after time, time after time, time
[2:08:25] after time, [screaming] time after time.
[2:08:28] Hallelujah. So my God outweighs the bad
[2:08:31] in my life. [applause]
[2:08:35] [cheering]
[2:08:36] When I think about the Lord, how he
[2:08:39] saved me, how he raised me, how he
[2:08:41] filled me with the Holy Ghost, it makes
[2:08:43] me want to shout. [cheering]
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; How he picked me up, how he turned me
[2:08:50] around, how he placed [screaming] my
[2:08:52] feet on solid ground, it makes me want
[2:08:55] to shout.
[2:08:58] [cheering and applause]
[2:08:59] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[2:09:01] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of
[2:09:05] all the glory and all of my praise.
[2:09:11] [applause and cheering]
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:17] [applause and cheering]
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; I feel like giving God a praise break.
[2:09:26] [cheering]
[2:09:28] [applause]
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:09:39] [applause]
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; I said, "I feel like giving God a praise
[2:09:43] break.
[2:09:45] He's been good to me. [cheering] He's
[2:09:48] worthy of all the praise." [applause]
[2:09:50] The Bible says, "Let [screaming]
[2:09:51] everything that has breath praise ye the
[2:09:55] Lord. [cheering]
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:10:03] [applause]
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Church.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; When you think about his goodness,
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; that should be a revelation.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with a sound.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. In my car where there's no piano
[2:10:28] or string instruments, God is good.
[2:10:32] When I'm on an airplane traveling, God
[2:10:35] is good. When my feet hit American soil,
[2:10:39] God is good. Hallelujah. When I finish
[2:10:43] eating my dinner at night, God is good.
[2:10:46] When I look at my family, when I'm
[2:10:47] thankful, hallelujah, [screaming]
[2:10:49] that everyone is alive and they healthy.
[2:10:53] Hallelujah. That's more than enough
[2:10:54] reason to give God praise.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; He woke me up
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; in my right mind [screaming]
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; with the blood running water through my
[2:11:06] veins.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; And you don't want me to give him
[2:11:08] praise. [cheering]
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You get mad all you want at
[2:11:20] my expression,
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; but this is a revelation to me.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; You might not express it like me.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that don't mean what I'm
[2:11:31] doing is wrong.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; It's what God means to me.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause and cheering]
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; And my God.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; My God is mighty to say.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's mighty to save.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Savior, you can move the mountain.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; You're mighty to save.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Church, if we would just for a moment,
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; think about how good God has been by
[2:12:05] revelation.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; And some of these things I'm saying,
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; some of you can't relate. It's because
[2:12:13] you haven't fully surrendered to God.
[2:12:15] Amen.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, you thought you was going to get out
[2:12:19] of here without that one, huh?
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Some of you can't relate with the
[2:12:25] goodness of God.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And worshiping the way we
[2:12:29] worship,
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; it's because you don't know him like we
[2:12:32] do.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; But he's more hallelujah
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; than available today.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; And God wants to reveal himself to you
[2:12:41] more than you want him to.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not a coincidence that
[2:12:46] you are here. God is trying to turn you
[2:12:48] into a worshshiper.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz you're probably worshiping the wrong
[2:12:53] thing.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; But look, churches.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, my time is running out.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Exodus
[2:13:06] 15.
[2:13:15] Look at this scene.
[2:13:19] Now, this is a church of people,
[2:13:23] a generation of people that have been in
[2:13:27] bondage for over 400 years.
[2:13:30] [laughter]
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; And I ain't talking about no Hebrew
[2:13:35] Israelites.
[2:13:37] Hallelujah. I'm talking about the
[2:13:39] children of God,
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; not some denomination people have made
[2:13:44] up to separate each other.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; But I'm talking about those who know
[2:13:47] their God by revelation.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; A God that's not racist.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; You know, God destroyed that in the
[2:14:02] Bible.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; When he when when he told this woman to
[2:14:05] say, "Woman, you worship, you know what
[2:14:07] you worship." First thing he did, he had
[2:14:09] to destroy racism in their conversation.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; First thing she could say, "Hey, you
[2:14:13] know me, me and you, me and you don't
[2:14:14] worship together. We don't get down like
[2:14:16] that."
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; That's how she was talking to him. He
[2:14:18] said, "No, you know, the Samaritans and
[2:14:20] Jews, we don't get, we don't worship
[2:14:21] together. We don't get down. Black and
[2:14:23] white don't mix."
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Woman, you don't even know
[2:14:30] what you talking about."
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; And then he started to talk to her. And
[2:14:36] the more he talked to her, the mystery
[2:14:38] of who she was started to come out.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; She thought that they had no connection.
[2:14:44] But as he began to speak, hallelujah, of
[2:14:46] himself, she started to realize that
[2:14:48] that word was inside of her.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; And she started to talk about a prophet.
[2:14:52] Hallelujah. She started to call him
[2:14:54] Messiah and all these different things.
[2:14:56] Hallelujah. And the next thing you know,
[2:14:58] before it's all over, she's running down
[2:15:00] into the country saying, "Come see a man
[2:15:02] who's told me all things." What
[2:15:04] happened? God gave her a revelation.
[2:15:08] [cheering and applause]
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; But look, church, the revelation was
[2:15:13] already there. It just took her coming
[2:15:16] into his presence.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Some of you are bride and don't even
[2:15:19] realize you're a bride.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; You're just coming to church cuz it's
[2:15:23] Sunday.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; But this is the question. Think about
[2:15:31] this. This is the question for some of
[2:15:34] you Sunday people. This is the question.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Who led you here?
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; There's only two spirits.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Who led you here?
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Who's in control of your steps? Who led
[2:15:46] you here?
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I just can't I just
[2:15:48] can't see it. I just can't I just can't
[2:15:50] get into it." Let me say it like this.
[2:15:52] Keep coming
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; because I know you're not going to admit
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; I know you're not going to admit that
[2:16:00] the devil led you here.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; There's only two spirits leading you
[2:16:10] this morning.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; And you mean to tell me, hallelujah,
[2:16:14] you're in an atmosphere of true true
[2:16:16] worship. Talking about the true and
[2:16:18] living God. talking about deliverance
[2:16:21] and healing and and power and joy and
[2:16:24] all the things that God are. And the
[2:16:26] devil say, "Hey, I want you to go to a
[2:16:28] church to hear how great God is today."
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; He would never do that.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; The devil would never lead you into a
[2:16:38] place where you could be set free.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; So, the only reason why you're here is
[2:16:43] because God led you here.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Woo!
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Satan, [screaming]
[2:16:53] you lose again.
[2:16:57] [cheering]
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; You lose again.
[2:17:00] [applause]
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] I just got told
[2:17:03] that I'm bride. [cheering]
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; I just got told that I'm a son or a
[2:17:09] daughter of [screaming] God. I might not
[2:17:11] look like it, but God led me here.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Church,
[2:17:21] what we have to understand about God is
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; God is intentional.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't make mistakes.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; He's perfect in all his ways.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; You know, I don't argue with the the the
[2:17:38] the the the
[2:17:40] LBG, the alphabet community.
[2:17:44] So many letters now you you got to keep
[2:17:47] soon it's going to be the whole
[2:17:48] alphabet.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; They just keep finding reasons to fight
[2:17:51] with.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; But you know what? I don't argue with
[2:17:55] them. All I do is ask one question. I
[2:17:58] say, "You believe in God?" It's like,
[2:17:59] "Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes." Oh, shada. I
[2:18:03] believe in God. God loves me. Say, "You
[2:18:07] believe that he's all knowing?" Yes.
[2:18:09] He's God. He's God. He's all knowing. I
[2:18:12] say, "Do you?" This is the This is the
[2:18:14] sinker. I say, "Do you believe he makes
[2:18:16] mistakes?" They say, "He's God. How can
[2:18:18] he make a mistake?" I say, "Exactly.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Why would he ever make the mistake of
[2:18:22] putting a woman in a man's body
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; or a man in a woman's body?"
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Now, you said you believe in God.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's omnipotent and all
[2:18:30] powerful and omnicient, knowing all
[2:18:32] things, and he doesn't make mistakes.
[2:18:34] So, why are you believing what you
[2:18:35] believe?
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; You see how simple it is?
[2:18:43] But people live lives that they want to
[2:18:45] live.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; And they make excuses for doing right
[2:18:49] and wrong.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; God didn't create lesbians. Man did.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; God didn't create homosexuals. Man did.
[2:18:59] God created a man and a woman.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly what he was doing.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything on this earth you
[2:19:09] can find in Genesis.
[2:19:11] Hallelujah. And in the beginning, he
[2:19:13] made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; If you are confused about your gender,
[2:19:18] that's a demon talking to you.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; As long as I've been a man, I've never
[2:19:30] have to take a pill that my body forms
[2:19:32] into a man.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; I've never had to take a shot that my
[2:19:36] body forms into a man. So if you got to
[2:19:39] do something extra, that mean you're
[2:19:41] enhancing something that God didn't
[2:19:43] create.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Barry, this one is touchy.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Some of you may got some family members
[2:19:54] or some of you may be challenging that
[2:19:55] in your mind. Hallelujah. And God is
[2:19:57] trying to set you free.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; Brother D, I think I think I'm a lesbian
[2:20:04] because my friends, they just always
[2:20:06] there for me. Is always a woman. She's
[2:20:08] always there for me. That's what friends
[2:20:09] are for.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; They're supposed to be there for you.
[2:20:12] You're not supposed to fall in love with
[2:20:14] them.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Let's keep moving.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible says when a person is drawn
[2:20:27] away, they're drawn away by their own
[2:20:28] lust.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; And the reason why people can't be
[2:20:32] delivered from homosexuality and
[2:20:34] lesbianism is because they like it.
[2:20:37] That's right.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; They worship that thing.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God didn't create you
[2:20:44] that way.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; You've been given over to a strong
[2:20:49] delusion.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; And God, even right now in this moment,
[2:20:52] is trying to set somebody free.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Stop listening to them lies.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; You are what [screaming] God made you.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Not what you're trying to be. You are
[2:21:03] what God made you. [applause]
[2:21:11] And you look at the word. The word is
[2:21:12] the absolute. He said, "Be fruitful,
[2:21:15] multiply, have dominion." Two men can
[2:21:18] never be fruitful. Two women can never
[2:21:20] be fruitful and multiply. That shows you
[2:21:22] it's against the word of God.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:36] I'm ducking from them stones.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just need to sit down and
[2:21:47] have a conversation with God.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; And ask the Lord,
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; God, am I in your will?
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; And if I'm not, show me the right way.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; I guarantee you, you give him a chance,
[2:22:01] he'll show you the right way. Amen.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Some of us get caught up with the wrong
[2:22:05] people
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; because we have a life we want to live.
[2:22:08] But you ought to ask God, God, am I
[2:22:10] living right for you?
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Am I worshiping the right thing?
[2:22:14] Hallelujah. Sometimes people fall into
[2:22:15] traps because they lonely. Hallelujah.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Like we said last night, the comforter
[2:22:20] is his spirit.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; You fall in love with God and in your
[2:22:25] lonely moments, he'll comfort you.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; Church, there's a sister in my church.
[2:22:30] She prayed 18 years for her husband. But
[2:22:33] when he came, boy, you talking about a
[2:22:34] king.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; His middle name was even king.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; And she stayed faithful. Hallelujah.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; See, if you stay faithful for God, your
[2:22:49] reward will be so great.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; But look, church, I, you know, like I
[2:22:58] said, the enemy challenges me with my
[2:23:00] finances. But there's going to be a day,
[2:23:02] hallelujah, brother Barry, where I'm
[2:23:04] walking and stepping on streets of gold.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; Something that money came by,
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; something that trials cannot even stand
[2:23:14] in the same category with. Hallelujah.
[2:23:17] Gates of pearls. [screaming]
[2:23:20] Oh my.
[2:23:23] Oh my. Listen. Oh my. Listen.
[2:23:28] Exodus 15.
[2:23:32] I ain't gonna be too much longer.
[2:23:36] The Bible says they sang
[2:23:38] Moses and the children of Israel. Verse
[2:23:40] one, this song unto the Lord and spake,
[2:23:44] saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for
[2:23:46] he have triumphed gloriously.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Look at why they're singing.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; They're singing because he has triumphed
[2:23:53] gloriously. Amen.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; This is why we're here. This is why we
[2:23:57] worship. This is why we come to church.
[2:23:59] This is why we live the way we live
[2:24:01] because he has triumph gloriously.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; And it says the horse and his rider have
[2:24:09] have have he thrown into the sea. The
[2:24:12] Lord is my strength and song and he has
[2:24:15] become my salvation. He is my God and I
[2:24:18] will prepare him a habitation.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I want to be God's habitation.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible says God inhabited the praises
[2:24:29] of his people.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; If you are his habitation, that means
[2:24:33] you have become his resting place.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; What a revelation.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; Wake up in the morning and say, "God,
[2:24:42] come and abide with me."
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord, come sit on the throne of my
[2:24:50] heart.
[2:24:51] You are my habitation.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "My father's God and I
[2:24:57] will exalt him." Exalt means to put
[2:24:59] above everything else in your life.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The Lord is a man of war. The
[2:25:04] Lord is his name. Hallelujah. Church.
[2:25:07] You look at what happened.
[2:25:10] What caused this to be written?
[2:25:15] It was a time of deliverance.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; And they've come out of Egypt. They
[2:25:20] didn't just come out quietly.
[2:25:23] They came out with signs and wonders
[2:25:25] following them.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God turning water into wine.
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; I told this testimony. There's a friend
[2:25:33] of mine. Hallelujah. A friend of mine
[2:25:36] who ran out of gas on the highway like 2
[2:25:39] or 3:00 in the morning headed home after
[2:25:41] work. He ran out of gas. He popped his
[2:25:44] trunk. He had nothing. He didn't want to
[2:25:46] call his wife and wake up in the middle
[2:25:48] of the night. He had nothing. So he sat
[2:25:50] on the edge of his car. He's like, "What
[2:25:52] am I going to do?" He popped the trunk
[2:25:54] again. Like, man, he said all he had
[2:25:56] back there was a jug of water. He didn't
[2:25:58] even have a gas jug. So he put back on
[2:26:01] the side of the car and he said, "Man, a
[2:26:04] thought came. A scripture came. Jesus
[2:26:06] turned water into wine."
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; And he was just foolish enough.
[2:26:14] Hallelujah. to say if my God turned
[2:26:18] water into wine, he can turn this very
[2:26:21] water into gas. He didn't pray, he
[2:26:24] didn't fast, he just obeyed the
[2:26:26] scripture. He took the top of the water,
[2:26:29] opened the gallon, open the gas tank,
[2:26:31] pulled the water in, and Joel, he jumped
[2:26:33] in, crunk it up, drove past the gas
[2:26:36] station.
[2:26:38] [applause]
[2:26:41] Some of [screaming] y'all need to drive
[2:26:43] past your unbelief. Drive past the
[2:26:46] devil. Drive past [screaming] the doubt.
[2:26:48] Drive past the sickness. Drive past the
[2:26:50] pain.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Church, [screaming] we have a real
[2:26:55] living gospel today.
[2:26:59] [applause]
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; What was that? That was a revelation.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Church, he didn't even stop to fill up.
[2:27:07] He jumped in the car, pulled the gas in,
[2:27:09] and drove all the way home.
[2:27:16] Hallelujah.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; And you take somebody like that.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; And they may be in church jumping and
[2:27:24] shouting
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; and you may criticize that. Hallelujah.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; But you don't know where they come from.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; And sometimes God will put somebody
[2:27:34] before you
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; because he's trying to set you free.
[2:27:38] Look, what did God tell Cain?
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Cain was mad and God showed him what
[2:27:44] real worship was.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Hey, if you do like your
[2:27:46] brother,
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; you'll be accepted."
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; But some of us think our brothers are
[2:27:51] fanatics.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But church, they worship.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; They didn't come out quietly.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. They came out with signs and
[2:28:00] wonders. And that same God is here
[2:28:03] today.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Miriam grabbed a tambourine
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; and she started to worship.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; And what I love about worship, sometimes
[2:28:10] all it takes is one person.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; All it takes is one person to get it
[2:28:16] started. Hallelujah. Because Hallelujah.
[2:28:18] I know I ain't the only one who feel
[2:28:20] that way. Hallelujah. And all it takes
[2:28:22] is one person and next thing you know,
[2:28:24] we got a whole line in church.
[2:28:25] Hallelujah. We got a whole group of
[2:28:27] people just worshiping the Lord, just
[2:28:30] giving them praise. Why? Because one
[2:28:32] person was free.
[2:28:34] Hallelujah. The prophet of God said,
[2:28:36] "Why did why did Miriam worship?" He
[2:28:38] said, "Because she looked behind her
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; and she saw every problem, every
[2:28:44] sickness, every disease, every trial,
[2:28:47] every tribulation, every pain, every
[2:28:50] hurt, every wrong thing in her life
[2:28:54] being drowned in the sea." And that
[2:28:56] woman started to worship.
[2:28:58] [cheering] She started to give God
[2:29:00] praise.
[2:29:01] I'm asking you, what do you [screaming]
[2:29:03] see this morning?
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; What do you see in your God? Is your God
[2:29:10] worthy of praise? [cheering]
[2:29:11] [applause]
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; That's why she worshiped
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; because she was no longer a [screaming]
[2:29:17] slave
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; and everything that ever bothered her
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; was destroyed
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; by her God.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; And that same God is here this morning.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Only if we would worship. Hallelujah.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; Don't wait for a prayer line only if you
[2:29:34] would worship.
[2:29:36] [applause]
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, Joy.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; We about to close.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Church.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; Worship.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; Has the power to cast out demons.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; God put an evil spirit on Saul.
[2:29:58] Hallelujah. spirit of jealousy,
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; spirit of envy.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; And every time he saw David, he threw a
[2:30:04] javelin at him.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; And David grabbed his harp,
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; in the midst of his enemies
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; and he let his gift operate. And he just
[2:30:16] started to serenate and started to play.
[2:30:18] And as he played, that demon lifted up
[2:30:21] off of Saul.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; I wonder,
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; can your worship be strong enough to
[2:30:25] drive out demons?
[2:30:29] Glory.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Your gift, your your worship testify of
[2:30:33] a life. Hallelujah. David, why did David
[2:30:37] dance? We sing a song, When the Spirit
[2:30:39] of the Lord comes upon me, I will dance
[2:30:41] like David dance. Why did David dance?
[2:30:44] Because David saw the ark of the
[2:30:46] covenant, which types out the presence
[2:30:49] and the word of God. David saw the ark
[2:30:52] on his way back home. Hallelujah. And he
[2:30:55] knew once that ark was restored, brother
[2:30:57] Mvin, they never lose a battle again.
[2:31:01] They never be defeated again. Once that
[2:31:04] ark was restored, that only be victory
[2:31:07] in his house.
[2:31:09] And David start to dance. David start to
[2:31:12] worship. Why? Because he knew victory
[2:31:14] was on the way.
[2:31:19] [cheering]
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; Church, the ark wasn't even there yet.
[2:31:24] Just knowing it was coming.
[2:31:28] [applause and cheering]
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; Just knowing that God is on his way
[2:31:31] causes me to worship. Just knowing that
[2:31:34] God is a restorer. Hallelujah.
[2:31:36] Restoration is on his way. I'll give him
[2:31:39] praise. Just knowing that my God,
[2:31:42] hallelujah, is mindful of what I'm going
[2:31:45] through.
[2:31:47] [applause and cheering]
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; David start to worship. Amen.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; But I want you to realize
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; whenever there's true worship, there'll
[2:31:58] always be some critics.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; Some people thinking that's just too
[2:32:02] much.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; That's just Brother Diggs. He's just
[2:32:04] [music] trying to excite the people. But
[2:32:06] would you rather have a atmosphere of a
[2:32:08] funeral?
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Would you rather have a dead atmosphere?
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "I'd rather
[2:32:14] have a wildfire than no fire at all."
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; Church, think about it. Hallelujah.
[2:32:20] David worshiping. Sometimes it's the
[2:32:22] people most close to you
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; that'll try to All right. Now, it don't
[2:32:26] take that [music] much. Just All right,
[2:32:28] let's just quiet it down. That's not us.
[2:32:31] We don't do [music] that.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; And his wife, she looking at, oh, the
[2:32:38] king danced out his clothes.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; The poor king. But what I love about
[2:32:43] David, [music] David said, you think
[2:32:44] that was something.
[2:32:48] Jesus is a mighty God. He's a mighty
[2:32:51] Jehovah is a mighty God. He's a mighty
[2:32:55] God. David David just didn't care. David
[2:32:58] just start to worship.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; Church,
[2:33:03] let's make it real clear.
[2:33:06] My worship is unto God.
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; It's not for anybody in this room.
[2:33:14] It's for God's
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; God himself.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; But church, one day
[2:33:23] I was in Canada
[2:33:26] and I went to a concert.
[2:33:30] There was no preaching.
[2:33:34] There was just worship.
[2:33:37] You see how we do that? It was just
[2:33:38] worship.
[2:33:41] But who are we worshiping?
[2:33:43] Hallelujah.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; And my voice is about gone. But church,
[2:33:48] we started to sing the song.
[2:33:51] God he reigns
[2:33:56] from heaven above.
[2:34:00] Here
[2:34:02] some power [singing]
[2:34:05] love our God
[2:34:09] is in all [music]
[2:34:13] our God. Our God
[2:34:17] [music]
[2:34:20] awome
[2:34:22] God.
[2:34:23] [music]
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; Let's slow it down. Let's bathe in it.
[2:34:29] Heaven [singing]
[2:34:31] [music] we
[2:34:35] just bathe in the anointing. Power in
[2:34:38] [music] love
[2:34:40] our God healing
[2:34:45] God.
[2:34:49] Our God [music]
[2:34:53] is in [singing] us.
[2:34:56] God
[2:34:58] here
[2:35:00] [music]
[2:35:02] from heaven love
[2:35:06] his name.
[2:35:10] All power
[2:35:13] and love
[2:35:15] [music]
[2:35:16] is enough.
[2:35:21] And as we sung that song, there was a
[2:35:23] sister
[2:35:25] who was in that worship service who
[2:35:28] couldn't walk.
[2:35:31] She was in there with a walker and this
[2:35:33] thing had wheels on it.
[2:35:36] It was so big it looked like a
[2:35:37] Volkswagen.
[2:35:39] in church. She came up front and she
[2:35:42] said, "Brother Diggs,
[2:35:44] I want to walk again."
[2:35:47] She said, "I believe, hallelujah, that
[2:35:50] God is able
[2:35:53] to make me walk again."
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; Hey, church, I realize that the power is
[2:35:57] not in me. Hallelujah.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; But the power is in him.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; So, you know what I did? I grab the
[2:36:07] hands and I say, "Sing with me." Our God
[2:36:14] is an awome
[2:36:17] God.
[2:36:18] He reigns
[2:36:22] from heaven above.
[2:36:28] Why don't you lift your hands to the
[2:36:29] Lord?
[2:36:31] [music]
[2:36:32] Love
[2:36:34] our God.
[2:36:36] Let's sing this by revelation
[2:36:39] all together. Our God. Our God. Our God.
[2:36:46] [music]
[2:36:49] He reigns.
[2:36:51] [music]
[2:36:53] Heaven above [singing]
[2:36:57] [music] within.
[2:37:02] [music]
[2:37:09] Let's just think about what we're
[2:37:11] singing for a moment.
[2:37:13] Now, let's just put these words
[2:37:17] above what you're going through.
[2:37:21] If there's sickness in your body, I want
[2:37:23] you to put above that, "Our God is an
[2:37:26] awesome God."
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; If you need direction, I want you to put
[2:37:31] these words above, hallelujah, that our
[2:37:34] God is an awesome God. If you need
[2:37:36] restoration or whatever it may be, let's
[2:37:39] put these words above that in the
[2:37:43] worship because God is an object of
[2:37:45] worship. And this sister with her hands
[2:37:48] in my hands as we sung the song, I
[2:37:52] pulled her up out of her seat and we
[2:37:55] began to sing it hand in hand. And I
[2:37:58] said, "Such as I have, Hallelujah, I
[2:38:01] give unto you in the name of Jesus
[2:38:03] Christ, walk." And I turn her hands
[2:38:06] loose, church. And she walked around a
[2:38:09] coliseum. Hallelujah. She walked around
[2:38:11] the right side. She walked around the
[2:38:14] left side. She came up the aisles and
[2:38:16] she said, "Brother D, the more I walk,
[2:38:19] the stronger my legs got." Hallelujah.
[2:38:21] [screaming]
[2:38:23] [music and applause]
[2:38:24] That's the power of a revelation of
[2:38:26] worship.
[2:38:29] [applause]
[2:38:31] He's an awesome God this morning.
[2:38:34] Don't walk out of here [screaming]
[2:38:35] wondering whether you're in the
[2:38:37] presence.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; You're in the presence. [music]
[2:38:39] Amen.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; But ask yourself, is there another
[2:38:42] object in your life that means more than
[2:38:44] God?
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; Because you're going to worship
[2:38:47] something.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; And just in a worship service where
[2:38:52] there was no preaching,
[2:38:55] there was deliverance.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts]
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; The power of worship, it unlocks gifts.
[2:39:03] There was a time when there was a
[2:39:05] prophet standing in the midst of the
[2:39:07] people and he was angry. And then he
[2:39:09] said, "Bring me a minstrel." And as they
[2:39:11] brought him a minstrel and he started to
[2:39:13] [music] pray, he started to see he
[2:39:15] started to play. He started to see
[2:39:16] visions. What was it? It was the worship
[2:39:19] that unlocked that gift.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; And as you bring forth to God to
[2:39:25] worship, your gift should testify of a
[2:39:28] life. Amen.
[2:39:29] &gt;&gt; When the wise men saw his star, they
[2:39:31] said, "Where is he, the king of the
[2:39:33] Jews? We've saw his star and we've come
[2:39:35] to worship him." But they brought gifts
[2:39:38] that testify of what was about to
[2:39:40] happen. [music] They brought
[2:39:41] frankincense, gold, and myrr, which
[2:39:43] meant deity and service. Hallelujah. To
[2:39:46] die. Before there was ever even a death,
[2:39:48] burial, and resurrection, their worship
[2:39:51] told what was about to happen.
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; What about us?
[2:39:57] What about us?
[2:39:59] Our worship, hallelujah,
[2:40:01] &gt;&gt; should speak those better things.
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; Now, you keep in mind, it's not about
[2:40:06] the sound.
[2:40:08] It's about the revelation.
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; It's not about your culture. It's not
[2:40:13] about where you come from. It's what you
[2:40:16] think of Christ.
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:19] Amen.
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; Don't let the enemy
[2:40:22] go through your mind and you pick out
[2:40:24] something that you a fight with just to
[2:40:26] walk out of here and not be a
[2:40:27] worshipper.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; Well, he said this and I don't agree
[2:40:30] with that. Pray about it.
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts]
[2:40:34] Let God be the deciding factor.
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; That he led you here this morning.
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't the invitation of
[2:40:42] a man. It was the invitation of God
[2:40:45] himself. Awome
[2:40:49] God he reign all together
[2:40:58] with wind
[2:41:03] power and [music]
[2:41:07] feeling
[2:41:09] of Oh, [music]
[2:41:15] come on. Let's sing it to the Lord.
[2:41:18] Awesome. [music]
[2:41:25] Heaven

[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:41:38] &gt;&gt; Do you serve that God this morning? Sing
[2:41:41] it to him. Our God, our God [music]
[2:41:47] is [singing] an awome

[2:42:11] almost there. Our God. Our [music] God.
[2:42:16] Come on. Break out of those chains.
[2:42:19] Break out of those chains of culture,
[2:42:22] those chains of religion, those [music]
[2:42:24] chains of bondage, and give God the
[2:42:27] worship that he deserves
[2:42:30] with wisdom and power [music]
[2:42:33] and love.
[2:42:36] The sure God is [music] he an awesome
[2:42:37] God this morning.
[2:42:40] Everybody say, "Our God, our God
[2:42:46] is [singing] an awesome

[2:42:52] [music]
[2:42:54] Heaven." [singing]

[2:43:25] of who you're worshiping. The object is
[2:43:28] among us right now. We're in his
[2:43:31] presence right now. We're in the
[2:43:33] presence of God, the object of worship.
[2:43:37] And we say to him, "Our God,
[2:43:41] our God,
[2:43:45] he [music and singing]
[2:43:47] let the devil know.
[2:43:49] Let the devil know that you're a God
[2:43:57] with [music] me. [singing]
[2:44:02] [music]
[2:44:07] All together one more time everybody.
[2:44:09] Our God.
[2:44:13] [music]
[2:44:16] Close your eyes. Lift your hands to the
[2:44:19] King. [music]
[2:44:20] Why don't you just give him worship
[2:44:24] in your own way?
[2:44:26] You don't have to do what anybody else
[2:44:28] is doing, but give him what he deserves.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:44:32] &gt;&gt; and he deserves our worship.
[2:44:35] Let's do it by revelation.
[2:44:38] [music]
[2:44:43] [music]
[2:44:49] [music]
[2:44:52] [singing] Yeah.

[2:45:15] an awesome God.
[2:45:20] He's an awesome God. [applause]
[2:45:25] He's an awesome God. [applause]
[2:45:29] Awesome. Is he
[2:45:34] [music]
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:45:44] [singing]
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; Just hum with me
[2:45:51] [music]
[2:45:56] as brother Barry comes.
[2:46:01] Don't miss the opportunity [music]
[2:46:04] to be a worshshiper.
[2:46:10] Sometimes you got to fight against your
[2:46:14] own self. [music]
[2:46:16] Sometimes you got to fight against what
[2:46:17] you're used to doing
[2:46:21] and [music] break free and say, "Lord,
[2:46:25] this is the question we ought to ask
[2:46:26] this morning.
[2:46:29] Does God deserve my worship?
[2:46:33] Has he been good enough for you?
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; For you to give him back the life that
[2:46:39] he's given unto you?
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:45] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't be right
[2:46:49] in this service as our heads are bowed,
[2:46:52] our eyes are closed,
[2:46:54] let's be obedient to the spirit.
[2:46:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:46:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:00] Because when we're not obedient to the
[2:47:02] spirit, we open ourselves up to an evil
[2:47:04] spirit.
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to be a habitation for
[2:47:08] demons.
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; But we want God to have his way as we
[2:47:12] bow our heads
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; right now in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; Let's be obedient. Bow our heads in the
[2:47:19] name of Jesus.
[2:47:21] &gt;&gt; Close our eyes.
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't be right if we didn't offer
[2:47:25] salvation
[2:47:26] in the service.
[2:47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. for you to become a real
[2:47:30] worshipper.
[2:47:32] &gt;&gt; Maybe you was invited by somebody this
[2:47:35] morning, but that somebody was Christ.
[2:47:40] Christ
[2:47:41] giving you an understanding that you're
[2:47:43] his child.
[2:47:47] &gt;&gt; Would you want to give your life to him
[2:47:48] this morning?
[2:47:51] &gt;&gt; Not to me,
[2:47:52] &gt;&gt; to him.
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody want to give their life
[2:47:57] to Christ? Raise your hand. There are no
[2:47:59] eyes on you but Christ.
[2:48:01] &gt;&gt; God bless the [music] hands.
[2:48:03] &gt;&gt; God bless the hands. Raise them high.
[2:48:05] Let God see you. Don't be ashamed.
[2:48:07] &gt;&gt; Worship is not ashamed.
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:10] &gt;&gt; Look at all the children of God coming
[2:48:11] home.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; Receiving salvation this morning.
[2:48:16] [applause]
[2:48:17] &gt;&gt; We receive it by faith
[2:48:20] in the name of Jesus.
[2:48:22] [cheering]
[2:48:23] &gt;&gt; We receive it by faith right now.
[2:48:26] And from this moment, you'll get
[2:48:27] stronger and stronger
[2:48:29] &gt;&gt; as long as you let God lead [music]
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; He's come to set us free. He's come to
[2:48:37] restore.
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; Let him restore.
[2:48:42] &gt;&gt; You may have gone wayward. [singing] You
[2:48:44] may have been trying to live your own
[2:48:45] life, but God is now showing you,
[2:48:48] hallelujah, the one you should be
[2:48:50] worshiping.
[2:48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:55] Keep your hands lifted to him.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[2:48:58] &gt;&gt; If you accept salvation [music] this
[2:49:00] morning.
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:49:03] &gt;&gt; If there's a restoring that you need,
[2:49:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:10] &gt;&gt; God sees your hand.
[2:49:12] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:49:13] &gt;&gt; God sees your hand.
[2:49:17] Thank you
[2:49:18] &gt;&gt; for this moment. I want you to walk by
[2:49:20] faith
[2:49:22] &gt;&gt; and put it back in God's
[2:49:23] [music and singing] hands.
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I receive you. Now you show
[2:49:27] me."
[2:49:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, I receive you as a savior. Now you
[2:49:31] show me your saving grace.
[2:49:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, I receive you as a healer. Now you
[2:49:35] show me what healing is. Lord, I will
[2:49:37] forever be a worshshiper.
[2:49:40] Just come closer
[2:49:43] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus.
[2:49:45] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus.
[2:49:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; In God's grace.
[2:50:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:03] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:50:07] &gt;&gt; It's the grace of God.
[2:50:11] Hallelujah.
[2:50:12] &gt;&gt; Remember the prostitute came through the
[2:50:14] back door
[2:50:16] &gt;&gt; and they said if he knew who was
[2:50:17] touching him, he wouldn't let that woman
[2:50:20] touch him.
[2:50:21] &gt;&gt; But realize if God didn't want to be
[2:50:23] touched, he couldn't be touched.
[2:50:26] &gt;&gt; But it's him allowing us to touch him
[2:50:28] this morning.
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; It's his grace. He's allowing us to
[2:50:31] touch him. If he didn't want to be
[2:50:33] touched, there wouldn't be an average
[2:50:35] sphere where he could be touched. But
[2:50:38] God wants to be touched by you. He wants
[2:50:40] to be worshiped.
[2:50:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; God bless every Lord Jesus.
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; Father, you see your children accepting
[2:50:52] salvation.
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, it is just a surrender of heart
[2:50:59] &gt;&gt; to acknowledge the true and living God
[2:51:02] by faith.
[2:51:04] Lord, we've had plenty of ceremonial
[2:51:06] actions in church.
[2:51:08] &gt;&gt; We've had plenty of traditional things,
[2:51:11] &gt;&gt; but we want to receive you in the
[2:51:12] simplicity of who you are.
[2:51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:15] &gt;&gt; Just by simple faith.
[2:51:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, we receive you this morning.
[2:51:21] &gt;&gt; And Lord, now we put our lives in your
[2:51:23] hands.
[2:51:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, for those who may have gone waver,
[2:51:26] those who may have backsliden, Lord,
[2:51:28] they've come home back today. Amen.
[2:51:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, they've accepted you and they've
[2:51:32] become worshippers again.
[2:51:34] &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, we just ask, Father, that you
[2:51:36] would make yourself available
[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; to cultivate that life.
[2:51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, to bring it closer and closer to
[2:51:44] you, make it stronger and stronger.
[2:51:47] Hallelujah. Lord, that they won't come
[2:51:49] in and go out. Come in and go out, but
[2:51:51] Lord, they'll come in and stay in.
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; That is the household of God.
[2:51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, Lord. We love you and we
[2:51:59] thank you for the grace that you've
[2:52:00] given us.
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[2:52:02] &gt;&gt; Lord. And we don't compare our worship
[2:52:04] to anyone else because it's by
[2:52:06] revelation.
[2:52:08] &gt;&gt; And Lord, only you know what's behind
[2:52:10] those hands that were raised.
[2:52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, only you knows the struggle. Only
[2:52:15] you know how many times they felt
[2:52:16] defeated.
[2:52:21] But now, Lord, we put it all in your
[2:52:23] hands.
[2:52:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you will let the worship
[2:52:27] arise.
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:52:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts]
[2:52:37] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus.
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, I give [singing] you my heart.
[2:52:48] I give you my soul.
[2:52:53] I live for you [singing] alone.
[2:52:58] Every breath [music] that I take.
[2:53:02] Every moment [singing] I'm awake.
[2:53:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, [singing] have your way. Lord, I
[2:53:12] give. Lord, [music] I give you my heart.
[2:53:18] I give you my [singing] soul.
[2:53:23] I live [singing] for you alone. [music]
[2:53:29] Every breath [singing] that I take,
[2:53:32] every moment
[2:53:34] [music] away.
[2:53:39] Lord [singing] have your way. [music]
[2:53:42] Lord, I give Lord I give you my heart.
[2:53:48] [music] I give you my soul.
[2:53:54] I live [singing]
[2:53:55] for [music] you, Lord.
[2:53:59] Every breath that I take,
[2:54:03] every [music and singing] moment I
[2:54:06] have your way. Have your way.
[2:54:09] Lord [music and singing] I
[2:54:13] Lord I give Lord I give my
[2:54:17] [music and singing] heart. Come on sing
[2:54:18] it to the Lord.
[2:54:21] Sing it to the Lord. Give it away
[2:54:22] church. Give it away to God. [music] I
[2:54:25] live for you alone.
[2:54:30] Every breath [singing] that I take,
[2:54:33] [music]
[2:54:34] every moment I
[2:54:40] Lord [singing] have your way. Lord I
[2:54:44] give Lord I give you my [music] heart.
[2:54:49] I give [singing] you my soul.
[2:54:54] Heat. Heat. [music]
[2:55:02] [music]
[2:55:11] Lord. [music]
[2:55:12] [singing]
[2:55:17] Hallelujah. Is that your desire today?
[2:55:20] &gt;&gt; Did you hear from the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:55:22] today?
[2:55:24] If you did, don't be back.
[2:55:27] [applause]
[2:55:35] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:55:36] [applause]
[2:55:40] &gt;&gt; You know, brothers [music] and sisters,
[2:55:41] it was months ago that I said this and
[2:55:44] I'm just so thrilled to hear about it
[2:55:46] today. And some people might say this is
[2:55:48] all emotion, [music] but that's not what
[2:55:50] the prophet said. He said the Holy Ghost
[2:55:52] is without sensation,
[2:55:55] &gt;&gt; not emotion.
[2:55:57] &gt;&gt; You cannot contain yourself.
[2:55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the spirit of the Lord comes
[2:56:01] upon you,
[2:56:02] &gt;&gt; you know what we're doing here is
[2:56:05] changing our character
[2:56:07] &gt;&gt; for when we're over there.
[2:56:10] &gt;&gt; We're not going to magically change
[2:56:11] [music] our character over there.
[2:56:14] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a body change that's
[2:56:16] going to change us. And that
[2:56:17] scientifically can't [music] be
[2:56:18] explained, but our character is being
[2:56:20] changed right now by our own free will.
[2:56:23] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; That's the only way it changes by us
[2:56:27] surrendering to the Lord and allowing
[2:56:29] him. You know what we're doing here now
[2:56:31] is practicing for the greatest special
[2:56:34] of our lives which is going to be
[2:56:37] worshiping the King of Kings [music] and
[2:56:39] Lord of Lords in glory from a perfect
[2:56:42] body.
[2:56:43] &gt;&gt; But isn't it wonderful? He's given us
[2:56:45] the desire and ability here in this
[2:56:48] imperfection [music] to worship him.
[2:56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to wait till we get
[2:56:53] over there for the glory to roll. Oh my,
[2:56:56] we can do it now.
[2:56:57] &gt;&gt; I think it's so wonderful. [music]
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; If you heard from the Lord today, just
[2:57:02] remember worship is not just in this
[2:57:05] building.
[2:57:06] &gt;&gt; Worship is every single breath in our
[2:57:09] lives.
[2:57:12] &gt;&gt; Every thought that fires in our mind is
[2:57:14] worship. Paul said to take every single
[2:57:17] thought, not most of them or some of
[2:57:19] them or just when you're at church, but
[2:57:21] every thought into captivity
[2:57:25] &gt;&gt; so we can control it.
[2:57:28] &gt;&gt; And make sure that the words that come
[2:57:30] out of our mouth match the meditation in
[2:57:33] our heart that it would be pleasing unto
[2:57:35] the Lord. Oh my.
[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song? I love you, Lord.
[2:57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; For your mercy, [music] it's never
[2:57:43] failed me.
[2:57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:57:45] &gt;&gt; It's never failed me.
[2:57:49] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord,
[2:57:53] [music]
[2:57:54] &gt;&gt; for your mercy never fails [singing]
[2:57:57] me.
[2:57:57] &gt;&gt; Never. Not one time.
[2:57:59] &gt;&gt; All my [music] days
[2:58:02] I've been held in your [singing] hands.
[2:58:07] From the moment [music] that I wake up
[2:58:12] until I
[2:58:17] see
[2:58:18] how [music]
[2:58:22] we be silent
[2:58:26] all my life you [music and singing]
[2:58:34] all my life [music and singing]
[2:58:36] you Heat.

[3:00:46] Yeah. Heat. [music]

[3:01:09] [music] All my life [singing] you have
[3:01:12] been.
[3:01:15] Thank you Lord.

[3:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:49] &gt;&gt; Can we sing It's [music] a Glorious
[3:01:51] Church.
[3:01:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:01:54] &gt;&gt; I know it might be getting late for some
[3:01:56] folks. [music] If you've got to go, by
[3:01:57] all means, God richly bless you on your
[3:01:59] way. We don't want to hold you captive
[3:02:01] here. This is an opportunity to practice
[3:02:04] worshiping. I know brother Cadre said
[3:02:06] sing at home in the mirror. But I want
[3:02:08] to say this. When you're in a crowd of
[3:02:10] believers, there's no better place.
[3:02:12] Brother Bradom said, "We ought to be as
[3:02:14] exuberant as everybody out there in the
[3:02:16] world. But there's no pressure. If you
[3:02:17] got to go, we have lives to live. Just
[3:02:20] go. [music] Don't don't feel pressured,
[3:02:22] but don't hinder this."
[3:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[3:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:27] &gt;&gt; Do you hear them coming, brother?
[3:02:33] They're strong. The street [music]

[3:06:06] You are that glorious church. That's not
[3:06:10] going to happen someday. That's right

[3:06:13] is that? Because these are the days of
[3:06:17] Elijah.
[3:06:20] &gt;&gt; These are the days of Elijah.
[3:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[3:08:52] Jehovah.
[3:08:54] There's no God like Jehovah.
[3:08:58] Is that right?
[3:09:00] There's no [music] God like Jehovah.
[3:09:03] There's no God. [singing]

[3:09:46] [applause and music]
[3:09:47] &gt;&gt; we sing? He abides.
[3:09:51] &gt;&gt; I do apologize. I just want to sing. I
[3:09:53] just want to shout. I just want to have
[3:09:55] a real jubile. I know what he's done for
[3:09:57] me. [music]
[3:09:58] &gt;&gt; It's just tremendous to be able to
[3:10:00] worship here.
[3:10:01] &gt;&gt; We'll [singing] sing two more songs and
[3:10:03] then we'll dismiss. [music] So, you
[3:10:04] don't have to be nervous. It's okay. But
[3:10:06] I just think, isn't it wonderful what
[3:10:08] he's done for us?
[3:10:11] &gt;&gt; Over 8 billion people in this world, and
[3:10:14] only a tiny little percentage can hear
[3:10:17] the voice of the vindicated prophet.
[3:10:20] [applause]
[3:10:21] We got every single reason to rejoice.
[3:10:23] My goodness,
[3:10:26] I'm rejoicing [music] night and day
[3:10:28] [singing]
[3:10:29] as I walk the pilgrim way for the hand
[3:10:33] of [singing] God in [music] all my life.
[3:10:35] I see
[3:10:38] the reason [singing and music]
[3:10:44] is that
[3:10:46] I'm

[3:13:36] Hallelujah.
[3:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause and cheering]
[3:13:42] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer as we close
[3:13:44] today. Gracious heavenly father. Lord,
[3:13:47] you are so wonderful.
[3:13:50] &gt;&gt; You're so magnificent, Lord Jesus. Lord,
[3:13:53] &gt;&gt; we don't even have words to express,
[3:13:55] Lord Jesus.
[3:13:57] Oh father, the desire to worship you is
[3:14:00] so strong in your children.
[3:14:03] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for coming by our
[3:14:05] way one more time.
[3:14:07] &gt;&gt; We invited you here today, Lord Jesus.
[3:14:10] And we thank you for coming. We know
[3:14:12] that you came,
[3:14:14] &gt;&gt; Father. We know that you spoke to us,
[3:14:15] Lord.
[3:14:17] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that the words that were
[3:14:19] spoken today would find the mark in the
[3:14:21] hearts of your children, Lord. Father, I
[3:14:23] pray that we would be able to consider
[3:14:26] who and what we worship. I pray that we
[3:14:29] would, Lord, examine our lives today.
[3:14:32] [music] That we would leave this
[3:14:33] building, Father, and consider our ways.
[3:14:36] Oh, Father, that we would take an
[3:14:38] inventory in our lives and see what it
[3:14:40] is we worship and see how we worship and
[3:14:43] see if it compares with your word. See
[3:14:45] if it matches up with the revelation of
[3:14:47] the word for our day. And if it doesn't,
[3:14:50] Lord, help us to change our lives to
[3:14:53] match that word because that's the only
[3:14:55] thing that will change our [music]
[3:14:56] bodies.
[3:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:58] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just
[3:14:59] bless each one, Father, who made the
[3:15:02] effort, Lord Jesus, to defy gravity
[3:15:04] today, Lord, and accept your word for
[3:15:07] them and their lives. Father, we pray
[3:15:09] that you would [music] just make
[3:15:10] yourself so real to them that Lord, they
[3:15:13] would be able to testify wherever they
[3:15:15] go, any time, day or night, because they
[3:15:18] know what you've done for them. [music]
[3:15:21] &gt;&gt; And Father, we pray that Lord, at the
[3:15:23] appointed time, that at each one of
[3:15:26] those people who raised their hands
[3:15:28] today to you that you would fill them so
[3:15:30] full of your Holy Spirit that there
[3:15:32] would just be room for nothing else in
[3:15:34] this world, Lord. [music]
[3:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, Father, we know that
[3:15:37] everything else will follow if we can
[3:15:39] get the right step right. And we know
[3:15:41] that that's the only step is to get your
[3:15:43] Holy Spirit in our lives. So, Father, we
[3:15:46] just ask humbly [music] that you would
[3:15:47] do that for each one of those hands that
[3:15:49] went up today. And Lord, if anybody else
[3:15:51] needs a top up of your spirit, we know
[3:15:53] that you're more than able. We just ask
[3:15:55] that you would do that today as well,
[3:15:57] Father. Lord, let us not leave this
[3:15:59] building the same way [music] that we
[3:16:00] came. Let us not leave this building
[3:16:02] worse than we came. Oh, Father, but help
[3:16:05] us to just [music] accept the full
[3:16:06] blessing that you've offered to us
[3:16:08] today, Lord. That challenge to examine
[3:16:11] who and what we worship. Lord Jesus, we
[3:16:15] thank you for your word. Thank you for
[3:16:17] the revelation, Lord, of worship.
[3:16:20] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that we would just go
[3:16:22] with the spring in our step, Lord.
[3:16:24] Father, we just ask Lord also that you
[3:16:26] would bless Brother Kadre. That you
[3:16:28] would just continue to use him for your
[3:16:30] glory.
[3:16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:16:31] &gt;&gt; That you would just continue to watch
[3:16:33] over his family, Lord. Father, that they
[3:16:36] would all desire to worship you, oh
[3:16:38] Father, according to the revelation
[3:16:40] granted to them, Father.
[3:16:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, we love our brother and we pray
[3:16:44] that you would just continue to use him
[3:16:46] for your glory in your kingdom.
[3:16:49] &gt;&gt; And Father, we pray that you would
[3:16:50] restore his strength. Grant him
[3:16:52] traveling mercies on his road back home
[3:16:54] again. Lord, Father, we love you today
[3:16:57] and we just ask all of these things now
[3:16:59] in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[3:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music] Can we sing that
[3:17:06] song? I worship you, Almighty God.
