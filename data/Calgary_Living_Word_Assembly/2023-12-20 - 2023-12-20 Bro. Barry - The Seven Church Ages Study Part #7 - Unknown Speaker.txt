careful to give you all the praise we just commit each need into your hands now in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen thank you musicians just have two scriptures tonight I'd like to read from the book of Malachi and then over in the book of Hebrews Malachi chapter 4 and Hebrews chapter 4 we just wanted to remind everyone that we just have regular services this month on the 24th we'll have a a service and the 31st we'll have a service both of them 10: in the morning that's uh Sunday the 24th and Sunday the 31st um Malachi 4: 5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord over in the book of Hebrews chapter 4 Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 Hebrews chapter 4 verse2 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword pierc even to the dividing aunder of the Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your word thankful that you have a program Lord and that you've given us the ability to understand it that you would would send us Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day that you have in store amen and father that you have given us through your Prophet a word your word Lord that's quick and Powerful oh Father and sharper than any two-edged sword and tonight we just ask Lord that it would just divide the soul and the spirit Lord Jesus that it would Lord Pierce even divide the the joints in the marrow tonight father let us have nothing before you getting in the way of your word we pray that your word would just have its will and its way tonight in our service father that you would just speak to us one more time we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated boy oh boy we're December the 20th today and tomorrow is the winter solstice the first day of winter is upon us Sister Mary Janette God bless you it's so good to see you we have a tremendous testimony coming sister Carol is she at home now praise the Lord to go from that oh my we have a tremendous testimony coming tomorrow is the uh first day of winter and that means that the days will now as the saying say is the days will be getting longer we know there's only 24 hours in a day but uh the daylight will actually start to get longer we'll have more and more Daylight right up until the 21st of June so we're uh we're enduring our our darkest day today and tomorrow and uh you know it's a bit like the scriptural thing spiritually speaking we're dealing with the darkest of days but we know the days will get longer and uh brighter are you happy tonight I just want to get into the exposition of the seven Church ages and carry on with it it's the I believe it's the eth eighth time that we have gotten into it and I'm thinking by the way this is going there'll probably be like 800 times that we'll talk about it but we'll just see what the Lord has in store um I really do want to try and actually start to make progress with it I don't want to just um cabbage down on individual statements but I think some of them are so important we really have to to make sure that we get the full value of it um I really do want to comment a little bit tonight about Sunday and Saturday the the weekend had so much to unpack and I really appreciated brother Cadre being here and you know many times an evangelist he does say things that a pastor maybe wants to say but can't say say or or won't say and uh you know if anyone was upset or offended by the things that were said on on on Sunday or even on Saturday then I I think we should probably have a conversation I would like to say I'm sorry because I don't want to see anybody get upset but um sometimes we need a spanking in our lives and spiritually speaking that's what we need that's what's going to keep us healthy that's what's going to keep us happy that's why the word of God says Des spare not the rod and if you do that if you try and actually do it a different way you're going to spoil the children children need to be corrected and and if we're Sons and Daughters of God then we need to be corrected and if we're not willing to receive that correction then we're not Sons and Daughters of God that's the way it works I I personally don't believe anything came over the weekend that wasn't according to the word of God in fact I think it went so good with the word of God and you know brothers and sisters when when the word of God comes on the scene when the spirit Falls in a service that's the time to reach out and touch the lord it's one thing to say Amen to the word as it's happening but when we have a need in our lives and the spirit of God Falls that's the time to get what you need and you can hear it said over and over and over again by the prophet you know that's the spirit that's that's the Holy Spirit get what you need he's here now stand to your feet and give him glory and we had the opportunity on on on Sunday it was just such a tremendous service I I think it was incredible because you know what was happening I just want to be real clear tonight to everyone there was discernment happening that was the word of God being quick and powerful and dividing the soul and the spirit brothers and sisters going well beyond what we think in our minds and our souls that was the word of God showing that there is something happening here now some people might say carnally speaking brother contre he was asking for money so how how spiritual was that you know the word of God the the the prophet for our day he said ask big and we know the word of God says to ask that our Joys might be full right so what I want to say tonight though is that it was tremendously powerful and it wasn't just an emotional workup for some people it might have been just an emotional workup and I I I'm sorry if that's all it was for you but you know for others it was the word of God it was God speaking directly to needs in people's lives and you know I'll say it again tonight maybe on record brothers and sisters I never had a conversation with brother Cadre and said please go and and preach on this and and and you know we have these needs over here there's there's this brother and this sister and this thing and that other problem and situation there's none of that and I want to be real clear and fact Saturday night I said to him you know there's these things and he said brother don't say a word let's talk after service on Sunday let's let God do the work yes so if we have any questions or concerns brothers and sisters I want to say it loud and proud and clear you heard from God now it's up to you with what you do with that word that God gave you I know I heard from him I could I could say this need that need this need that need this thing that thing the other thing but you know you know amen it was not a conversation it wasn't we need to deal with I just can't get over how how how brilliant and precise it was on Sunday like I said if anybody's got any questions or concerns let's let's talk about it but I want to I want to I want to just be real clear about the one thing that brother Cadre did talk about and that was the money thing you know we didn't send them home with $20,000 we just can't afford that um perhaps maybe if anybody feels led to we could take up an offering for the dear brother he he relies on evangelism that's his sole source of income he doesn't work in fact he's tried to work and he can't get a job God will not allow the man to work he's only doing evangelism so anyways um just wanted to bring a couple quotes just to be very clear about what you know he was talking about because some people who are stuck on money it could sound like it's super carnal and how could that ever be anything but you know let's let's just bring up the first quote Brothers if you if you got it did you get it it's 1955 where I think Pentecost failed brother Bram says this and God will never you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you you say well I hate to I hate I hate to bother you so much father he says he wants to be bothered that way he does don't never think that you could ever ask too much of God I believe the scripture said you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our Joys would be full he wants you to ask abundantly ask for big things don't limit your faith to some little Mustard Seed get on out here to some other kind of faith and move out and big things ask big things is just as easy to receive as little things you just have to believe that's all and you got faith just know exactly how to use it and it'll all be right it'll be all right you can put it right to work and it'll be just fine I just want to say if we are asking for something why do we want it I'll be real clear brother Cadre told me a little bit and uh you know maybe it's too much to say it but just because of the money thing brother Cadre wants to be able to do things with his family he wants to be able to be a grandpa he wants to be able to to be a good daddy he wants to be able to do nice things for his family and he's just cutting it from Bill to Bill to Bill to Bill and many times in our lives that's the way we can be and if you've ever been there you know exactly how he feels it's not a fun place to be just when you think maybe you're going to get ahead there's another unexpected expense bill that has to be paid it's got to be dealt with and it's really frustrating and and it's been that way for a long time for brother Cadre and and you know what God's dealing with him the way he needs to but I I just want to be clear that you know he wasn't misquoting the scripture and he wasn't misquoting the message we need to be able to ask big and you know God will give it to us but why are we asking is the key that's what the prophet said says I'm not going to get into why tonight but you know in James it says that many times we ask a Miss because we want to consume it upon the lust of our flesh I I want a better job so so I can have a bigger house so I can have better clothes maybe I want better finer food in my fridge maybe I want to do this maybe I want that but you know we we were talking about faith over the weekend and I said to brother kadre on the way out of here Saturday night I said you know we can ask about those things and and if we're asking because we want to provide for our family the right things if we want to make sure that our family knows there's milk in the fridge that there's there's there's bread in the cupboard we're we're going to have lunch we're going to have supper we know we don't have to worry about those things that's that's one thing but if we're asking about other things just because we want to look good or or or or sound good or maybe just feel good we want to you know we can ask about things the wrong way but what I said to brother kadre when we when we start asking about the salvation of our children we start bringing those prayer requests before the Lord when we start asking about the things that really mean uh Eternal value the things that will will last forever when we start asking our heavenly father for things like that brothers and sisters that's when I believe we're going to see tremendous action happen because we're not asking about it for ourselves we're not looking to consume it upon the lust of our flesh who cares what kind of a house we have amen our children saved that's what we want the next one out of hear ye him brother Bram in 1956 12:15 he says and don't never be afraid to ask big things God wants you to ask big things he don't want you to be little petty and juvenile he wants you to ask big things that your Joys might be full amen could you imagine a little fish about that big way out yonder in the Atlantic Ocean say I better drink just a little bit of this water I might run run out he says nonsense and remember I'm just going to throw this in there this is just for free tonight from Brother Barry remember in the story of sister Hatty Wright operating the third poll brother bradam said the Holy Spirit told me to tell you you said the right thing you pleased the holy spirit so what do you want do you want some money do you want a a million dollars you could have a million dollars right now so money isn't off the table if you really want to talk about money he says could you imagine a little mouse about that big down there in the great Garners of Egypt saying I just better eat two grains a day because I might run out before summertime again well that's nonsense if they had 1000,000 rats that size they'd never eat it up and they had billions times billions of tons of them fish they'd never drink the water up and how many times could we multiply you could never exhaust God in his powers and his mercies to his children he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life just drink and drink and drink and drink I just love that one more one more 1960 0729 what it takes to overcome all unbelief our faith he says now how are we planted we're planted in Christ Jesus amen now I believe just in my estimation of him he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life that you cannot exhaust his goodness some people think oh I hate to call on God so much that's what he wants you to do you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not ask abundantly that your joy your Joys might be full that's what God wants ask big things he says I'm asking for 100 souls in this meeting I'm asking that every sick person enters that door will go out of here well I'm believing it I'm believing that till we go that this won't be another gathering together but it'll be a Revival here in yaka here and I just want to say I'm I'm believing too I'm believing till that we go that this won't be another gathering together but it'll be a Revival here in Calgary here too let's ask big brothers and sisters amen we don't have to be cautious and careful let's ask big out of the abundance of that Spirit that's inside of us we don't have to be afraid but I know we get afraid when maybe we're not right with the Lord or something isn't right in our lives but we don't need to be be afraid just make sure that we know where we stand and just die out to ourselves we know we always have this other part too I'm going to throw this in there we we've got a March God can't bless us if we just sit down if we just sit in a chair and do nothing God's not going to just re our blessing Out of Heaven upon us we've got to get out of bed in the morning and we've got to March forwards brothers and sisters but it's when we're moving when we're doing when we're acting and up and doing is what brother brandham says that's where God will bless us amen getting into our scripture tonight behold I send you Elijah the prophet amen I just want to really emphasize that that's that's what we're talking about that's what this exposition of the seven Church ages is the beginning part of the Book of Revelation the the the book in the Bible the the first three chapters of Revelation talks about the church ages and uh God sends Elijah to the Earth before the great and terrible Dreadful day of the Lord and we know that he turns the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and and that's what's happened already it's not going to happen amen some people many people in this world you could show them that scripture in Malachi and say to them you know when is that going to happen and and they'll say well we don't know you know maybe sometime maybe in Palestine or something like that some sometime out in the future but we know that he's the not not the I was or the I will be he's the I am and the Believers see him that way we we don't want to put him off into the future sometime and say well sometime Elijah is going to come and we don't want to go back and say you know Elijah's already come so whatever's going to happen is going to happen there's nothing that can happen no no no we don't want to be ignoring what he's doing right now because he is he is alive and well Hallelujah today if you you will hear his voice hard and not your hearts brothers and sisters I think it's so beautiful because when we hear the word of God does it does it encourage us does it excite us does it give us the desire to press in to drink in and drink in and drink in or do we get a little bit uneasy with it you know the word of God is quick and and Powerful quick means alive the word of God is alive a and it is a living breathing person the word of God and I just was thinking about it how wonderful it is when we hear fantastic preaching like we did on the weekend when it's the word of God that's coming forward from the pulpit brothers and sisters that is God Discerning he's he's quick and he's powerful and he's Discerning he's sharper than any two-edged sword he's he's breaking down the soul and the spirit and getting past the joints in the M getting past all the fleshy thoughts getting past all of our spirits and and and our own ways our own traditions our own thinking and getting right down into the soul of the man and what it's doing is Discerning the thoughts and the intents of our hearts and and you know I think it's so beautiful because right now even right now it is Discerning the thoughts and the intents of every single human being's heart in this building right now he knows exactly what we're thinking he knows exactly why we're thinking it because the word of God is sharp it's quick and and alive and it's powerful and sharper able to to just get right down to the nitty-gritty in our lives like why are we here remember the prophet of God said our thoughts our thoughts are louder in heaven than our voice is here on Earth my goodness that's pretty powerful yes you know out of the Amplified Bible Hebrews 4:12 it says for the word of God speaks that for the word that God speaks is alive and full of power isn't that beautiful to think think about the word that God speaks and and we have the ability when we listen to the message of the hour to hear the word of God speak a and we have the ability to hear an evangelist preach we we are listening to the word that God speaks when we have a a teacher we are listening to the word that God speaks it's alive and full of power when a pastor is preaching it is the word of God that speaks speaking brothers and sisters it's not just a man Hallelujah and what is it doing it goes on to say making it active operative energizing and effective it's supposed to do something to us and I I know it's beautiful because even though I'll say it's supposed to it does every single time we hear the word of God preach brothers and sisters it changes us from glory to glory it it gives us the ability to actually see ourselves who who he sees us to be goes on to say it is sharper than any two-edged sword penetrating to the dividing line of the Breath of Life Soul and that Immortal spirit I think they've got this backwards myself that's my opinion because I believe the soul is what's Immortal the spirit isn't but maybe they're talking about the uh spirit of the Lord and we'll maybe take it that way it's sharper than any two-edged sword penetrating to the dividing line of the Breath of Life Soul in Brackets and the immortal spirit and of joints and Marrow of the deepest parts of our nature exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purposes of the heart personally I think that's just amazing because it takes us to a level the word of God takes us to a level that we can't even get to on our own amen yes maybe we can go on our knees and actually spend time in prayer a and the spirit will actually Quicken and speak through us but for us to just sit down with a book and a pen and maybe try and magnify our thoughts and try and get to a place where we can actually get to that that that Soul realm it's it's not it's not quite as easy as that it's not a human thing we can't do that on our own I just think it's beautiful brothers and sisters what happened here on Sunday was nothing short of the Lord Jesus Christ walking passing not our Gentle Savior and hearing our cries and knowing exactly what we need I think it's just amazing if you have any questions about it come and see me we'll uh be happy to talk about it are you okay tonight I just like to pick up with h where we left off and that's why I just think it's so beautiful it's it's like a hand to a glove you know um I never told Brother kadre Where I Was preaching from I never told him we were talking about Hebrews chapter 12 and and 11 I mean and talking about faith and and how it's impossible to please God without faith and and we never talked about any of that paragraph 61 of the exposition of the seven Church ages in the revelation of Jes Jesus Christ where where we left off last week is the ability to discern the heart thoughts in men made the elect of God to understand that here was the Messiah the anointed word of God Amen the disciples were able to recognize this is not an ordinary man when Jesus Christ came on the scene a and for three and a half years began to minister the grace of God to human beings isn't it interesting that it really only was three and A2 years that he did that and Messiah was cut off it's pretty bizarre that a whole book would be written as big as it is about him in three and a half years but it's nothing but the truth Hebrews 4:12 in this book it says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the defining aunder of Soul and Spirit and the joints and Marrow and it is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart next paragraph says when the woman at the well heard him discern the thoughts of her heart she acclaimed him a prophet declaring that Messiah would be known for that great ability now we'll go on and we'll read this story here and uh we've still got a bit of time but I just want to I want to dwell just on that I want to see where the rubber meets the road and I I just couldn't help but visualize it myself when we were in service and it's just me brothers and sisters maybe I have a a weird way but you know I just kept help kept thinking this is the rubber meetting the road and if anybody has ever driven in a car where you can actually spin the tires and squeal them you can hear that rubber hitting the road that's what I was thinking and feeling like this is acceleration in a spiritual level and this must be maybe something similar in a different way that this woman at the well was was feeling something is happen happening here there's a there's there's there's something I've never experienced before in my life this man is telling me all about my life but someone had taught her somewhere along the way that someone will come around and be able to do that and that will be the sign of the Messiah and I want to say this brothers and sisters if God spoke to you on Sunday that was the sign of the Messiah that was the sign of the Lord Jesus Christ yes don't dismiss it don't say it's carnal say be blessed be the name of the Lord be it unto me that that that that speaks to my soul that speaks to my nature I need to hear from the Lord I know he spoke to me the scripture here it says there cometh a woman out of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto her give me a drink for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat then saith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew ask askest a drink asked drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldst have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water the woman saith unto him sir thou Hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband hband for thou Hast had five husbands and and he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in that saidst thou truly the woman saith unto him sir I perceive thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews amen but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must wor worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things see she was taught right Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he it's John 472 4: 7-26 isn't that amazing isn't that what every anybody wants to hear I that speak unto thee am he just tremendous Revelations 15:3 and they sang the song of Moses the servant of God the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou King of saints now brother Ram goes on to say do you see it the lamb the high high priest holding his blood as atonement on The Mercy Seat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty amen it's not a different person it's the Lord God Almighty that is his present office that is what he is doing now pleading his blood for our sins amen but one day that lamb will become the lion of the tribe of Judah and you know brothers and sisters that's exactly where we talk about Malachi 4:5 be I'll send you Elijah before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and when he steps from that Throne Mercy's over and we know that there's doctrines that say well he's already done that and so anybody that's in the lineage of whatever the family is they're the only ones that are saved and everyone else is outed and that's not true he's still calling the blood's still on The Mercy Seat tonight brothers and sisters we know that that's a a doctrine of a devil but he's not going to come as a roaring lion into our Our Lives we know that the word of God says that it will be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible so it's going to be just like this it's going to be right in mixed in around the truth the only way we're going to be able to tell the difference is to actually have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's why I'd say it so much goes on to say but one day that lamb will become the lion of the tribe of Judah he will come forth in power and glory and take his authority to reign as king he is the coming King of the earth of course that does not say he is not King now for he is our king king of saints right now is a spiritual Kingdom it's not of this world system even even as we are not of this world that's the reason we act different from the world love this our citizenship is in heaven we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is the king amen that's that is why our women do not dress in men's clothing because the word of God says it's an Abomination so they don't do it or cut their hair because we know that that's their covering according to the word of God so they don't do it or use all those cosmetics and other things that the world likes so much because we know that there's only one girl that wore those Cosmetics like that in the Bible and her name was Jezebel amen and if you read the story of Jezebel it's not a good one right so that's why our women do not dress in men's clothing or cut their hair or use all those cosmetics and other things like the world likes so much that's why our men don't drink and smoke and carry on in sin our Dominion is the dominion over sin and in its and it is in force through the power that is in the spirit of Christ that indwells us so I want to say tonight brothers and sisters we have that strength when his spirit indwells us amen now some might say well brother Barry you have the Holy Spirit until the day of your Redemption until your destination and truly indeed you do but there's times where we do things that doesn't please the father right and when we do things that doesn't encourage the spirit of Christ in our lives brother bradam says it I don't have it tonight but he says it that that Holy Spirit is like a dove and it'll just go and sit up in a tree and just wait until we're done our fit with whatever it is is we're doing that's not pleasing of the Lord and when that happens brothers and sisters that allows the devil to come around our lives and that devil is going to come around our lives and he's going to affect our families he's going to affect maybe our jobs maybe our education maybe our friends maybe our families maybe church services but the devil's going to come around he's going to have the opportunity to get in our lives and mess with us but you know when we don't give them that opportunity when we say you know we only we're only going to eat sheep food we're only going to feed on the things that pleases the Lord that he doesn't have that ability our Dominion is the dominion over sin we heard it on the weekend brothers and sisters if the devil is anywhere else other than under our feet he's out of his position and the only reason he can get out of his position in our lives is because God allows it but when we submit ourselves therefore unto God first then resist the devil he'll flee we can't just resist the devil and he'll flee no there's an order to it first we have to submit ourselves unto God submit ourselves unto the word because that's God for us in our day our Dominion is the dominion over sin and it is in force through the power that is in the spirit of Christ that indwells us every Kingdom on Earth is going to be tore down but ours will remain why can you imagine that it's not our kingdom we know it's his kingdom but wow to be a citizen of that Kingdom just because he chose to give us a passport you get a passport you get a free pass you get to be a member of this Kingdom what a tremendous thing you go goes on to say now we've been talking about the offices and manifestations of the one true God and beholding His glory in a scriptural study but he is not to be known intellectually our critical thinking from University will not get us there our critical thinking from our family traditions will not get us there our critical thinking from a religious standpoint will not get us there the only way we'll get there is to know him by his spirit amen goes on to say he is known spiritually by spiritual Revelation this same one who was known as Jesus after the flesh went back to the pillar of fire that's why brothers and sisters I'm going to emphasize this tonight really hard when we see the picture of William maryi and brano I don't know if you do you have it there brother Logan the the pillar of fire picture when we see that picture brothers and sisters don't look at it and think well that's just a man he's got a halo over his head don't don't look at it and think well it's just God identifying himself with a man what it is is God identifying himself with men it's God showing himself that he has gone back to that Pillar of Fire like we're reading here and he's making himself known to humankind I'll just keep on reading but if you've got it there just just bring it up if if not don't worry about it it's not a big deal that's really putting you on the spot I know goes on to say but he promised that he would would come again and dwell amongst his people by the spirit and isn't it so beautiful when you look at this brothers and sisters and on the day of Pentecost that Pillar of Fire came down and it separated its s in tongues of fire upon each one of them what was God doing he was separating himself into the church giving all those men and women a part of himself he divided himself amongst his church just as he said he would that's why I think that Pillar of Fire picture is so powerful if you don't have one in your house it might be good to get one just so you can actually look at it and say wow this is the same Jesus Christ that was back there on the road to Damascus that knocked Saul off of his horse and told him you're are not going to be called Saul anymore you're going to be a new creature in Christ Jesus you're going to have a new experience but it was the same Pillar of Fire he divided himself there he divided himself on the day of Pentecost and he's divided himself again in this last Gentile age to show that he is the same yesterday today and forever so going on reading here and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him not but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you and I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you for yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also and at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you why if you ever want to talk about a trinity I would say that's it right there hey I am in the father and ye in me and I in you he that hath known my Commandments and keep with them he it is that loveth me amen and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judas saith unto him not a scariot lord how is it that thou Wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him how many want him to make his Abode with you tonight goes on to say he said he would pray the father who would send another comforter who was with them the disciples already but not in them that was Christ then in verse 23 speaking of himself and the father he said said we will come there it is the spirit is coming the same spirit of God that manifested as the father and as the son and will yet manifest in the many one God who is Spirit that's why no man can ever come along and say the holy man is a pope or the holy man is a bishop or priest and I want to say this the holy man is maybe an evangelist with a gift of discernment brothers and sisters it's the same Jesus Christ in a regular service with any Ministry behind the pulpit it's up to the people and their expectations the spirit that is inside of us to pull Upon A gift there's no holy men there's no great ministry in this world there's Jesus Christ amenallah I I'm just going to say it I wasn't really going to get into it but I will just for fun you know I I think sometimes it's it's good just to touch on things I was listening to a message discernment of spirit and uh brother bradam was talking about the discernment of spirit and and how the spirit is what discerns and uh it it's so good because he says it in there that there's no holy men there's nobody that's actually the holy person it's just Jesus Christ a and the motive and objective of the Man shows the inspiration that's behind him amen it's not about just knowing the word of God and being able to quote the word of God and being able to demonstrate a a Christian walk to the world around us it's actually being able to live it and every once in a while you get to say a word or two because people want to hear it but it's the life that we live live that actually demonstrates it but the Bram says that's why no man can ever come along and say the holy man is a pope or the holy man is the bishop or priest the holy man is Christ the holy spirit in us how dare the hierarchy declare that the leoty has no word to say each one has something to say each has a work each has a Ministry the Holy Ghost came at Pentecost and separated himself on each that it might be fulfilled whereof Christ said at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you amen tonight brothers and sisters I want to say what day is that that day ye shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you what I want to say is what day that is that's the day that you can say Amen praise the Lord I got the Holy Ghost in my life amen that day it's not someday in the future and it might be someday in the past but every single day is a walk with Jesus when you know that you are in him and he is in you it's a beautiful thing that's John 14:20 brother R goes on to say I am the sorry The Great I Am the almighty God has come as Spirit to fill his true church he has a right to move anywhere he wants to and upon on anybody he wants to I'm just going to pause and and let this soak a little bit I think it's so important brothers and sisters there's no great ones amongst us except for Jesus Christ amen and when you know that a man is pointing to Jesus Christ you know he has the right motive and objective but when the man starts to point at anything else you know there's something a Miss in Discerning of spirit brother bam talks about that the true Ministry is always going to point to Christ brother bam he goes on to say he wants to and upon anybody he wants to we don't make any holy men amongst us but the whole true Congregation of the Lord Is Holy because the presence of the Holy Spirit am I'm going to throw this in there too you know many times what it is is it's not even the men it's not even the men that get elevated they wind up getting elevated but it's not the men trying to draw people unto the what it is is a gift in their life that's actually manifesting and the people start to elevate that gift they start to increase that man because that man has the ability to have the gift that's not where it's at and a true man of God is going to say no I can't actually deal with people like that you you have to stop looking at me start looking at Christ amen it's only Christ he says it is he the holy spirit that is Holy not the Congregation of itself now that is the Revelation Jesus Christ is God the Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new no matter how hard you try you can't prove there are three Gods but it also takes a revelation by the spirit to make you understand that the truth the truth that he is one it takes a revelation to see that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Jesus of the new now just going to pause and just say this here when we say the word one maybe there's some people that are going to be watching or even here now I don't know that'll be saying oh see I knew it's Oneness it's not Oneness that way it's not Oneness like your finger he says it in here in this book it's it's one in three manifestations in three offices yes that kind of one Satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth yes sir and when they were blinded to it it wasn't long until the Church of Rome stopped baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'll say it where does it say in the Bible that they baptized in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost there's not one account in the Bible where they've done that he goes on to say I admit that it takes a real Revelation from the Holy Ghost to see the truth about the godhead in these days when we are in the midst of the perverting of so much scripture but the prevailing overcoming church is built on Revelation so we can expect God to reveal his truth to us so we can never take a part of the Bible out and say I just don't believe this for my day and I just don't believe that for my day because as soon as we do that we're actually adding to and taking from and we know that the word of God says that the the plagues that are in this book will be added to those people that add or delete from the word of God and we know this will be for free too that the word of God came to Malachi 4 in our day we believe that God sent a prophet and he gave him the ability to see the word of God he studied exclusively from the King James version Bible amen so why would we want to try and study from any other version some folks are are into to it they've got the new international version and there's the new King James version I think and all the different versions it's you know interesting to look at them once in a while and maybe cross reference and just see I know I do it with the Amplified but I don't have an amplified Bible at home by my chair where I study and and and examine the Amplified Bible I just sometimes get an inspiration for a word or something and think you know maybe what does it say about this verse we want to make sure that we follow the pattern that was set out for us brothers and sisters and sometimes it's a hard to say the King James version in Old English it's tough it is tough in some cases but be clear no no doubt about it that the Holy Spirit when he comes in our lives he's going to make that scripture come to life to us when we read it even though it's a hard read it's supposed to be because it's going to be sweet as honey in our mouths but boy it's going to make our bellies bitter brother bradam he says I hate to admit sorry that's that's me saying that let start over paragraph 71 I admit that it takes real Revelation from the Holy Ghost to see the truth about the godhead in these days but we are in the midst of the perverting of so much scripture but the prevailing overcoming church is built upon the Revelation on Revelation so we can expect God to reveal his truth to us paragraph 72 however you actually don't need Revelation on water baptism it's right there staring you in the face would it be possible for one minute for the apostles to be led astray from a direct command of the Lord to baptize in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost and then find them in willful Disobedience they knew what the name was and there is not one place in scripture where they BT baptized any other way than in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen it's so beautiful the way he has this written here it says Common Sense would tell you the book of Acts is the church in action and if they baptize that way then that is the way to baptize now if you think that is strong what do you think of this anyone who was not baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus had to be baptized over again yes sir and I'm going to say this I'm going to throw this in there brothers and sisters if someone was baptized any other way and they can see a scriptural identification that they need to be baptized over again in order for this to work if they're a true son and daughter of God they're going to line up with that word right quick and they're going to say be it unto me according to Thy Word of course I want to be baptized correctly I want to do it right I want to be in line with the word of God Amen scripture out of Acts 19 1-6 and it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto John's baptism then said Paul John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus amen not in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost even though they were it's about being able to read between the lines and understand how this happens goes on to say and when when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied paragraph 74 there it is these good people at Ephesus had heard about the coming Messiah John and preached on him they were baptized unto repentance of sins looking forward to Believing on Jesus but now it was time to look back to Jesus and be baptized unto remission of sin sins it was time to receive the Holy Ghost and when they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Paul laid his hands on them and the Holy Ghost Came Upon them oh those dear Folks at Ephesus were fine people and if anyone had a right to feel secure they did notice how far they'd come they had come all the way up to accepting the coming Messiah amen they were ready for him excuse me but don't you see that in spite of that that they had missed him they had come he had come and gone they needed to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ yes they needed to be filled with the Holy Ghost if you have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God will fill you with his spirit that is the word acts 196 which we read was the fulfilling of Acts 238 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen and I think this is just so beautiful it's such a critical factor to all of this brothers and sisters we need to get the Holy Ghost to be able to understand the message of the hour we need to get the Holy Ghost to be able to get into the depths the mysterious things the Deep things of God we have to have the Holy Ghost to be able to do that otherwise we're just in an intellectual State and we can read it and we can say it we can remember it but it doesn't really do much for us because it's not quickened it doesn't become quick and Powerful in our lives it just becomes a tradition and we don't want it to be a tradition paragraph 77 see Paul by the Holy Ghost said exactly what Peter said by the Holy Ghost and what was said cannot be changed it has to be the same from Pentecost until the very last elected one has been baptized but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a cursed I'm just going to read this paragraph I'm going to jump back to the other one and I'll call the musicians because we're already at time I just think it's so beautiful brothers and sisters I get a charge out of this I really do it just I where were we yeah I want to read this paragraph again see Paul by the Holy Ghost said exactly what Peter said by the Holy Ghost and what was said cannot be changed it has to be the same from Pentecost until the very last elected one has been baptized now remember we started out with paragraph 61 the ability to discern the heart thoughts in men made the elect of God to understand that here was the Messiah the anointed word of God only the elected can see it brothers and sisters other people will call it telepathy they'll call it mind reading they'll say It's Magic some kind of trickery maybe it's just a discussion when the word of God comes and and discerns the Very hearts of men that is the sign of the Messiah brothers and sisters we know that we have the ability to receive the word of God God but when we are in that place when we're in that state when we're in a position where we're calling on the name of the Lord and he comes on the scene it's not the devil right it's not men it's God I just can't get over I just want to celebrate the fact that we had the Lord here with us on Sunday I know it and we have him here right now with us even tonight in our service brothers and sisters the same one he's more than willing to help us in our our troubles in our trials to Grant to us the things that we ask big for because we won't ask a Miss if we've got his Spirit maybe stand with me as we close tonight we won't ask a Miss don't have to worry and you know what maybe if you ask and you ask wrong maybe the the simple thing will be that the answer just might not be the way that we ask for it it might not be what we ask for we might just might not get the answer that we want but what is that to us blessed be the name of of the lord we just need to keep marching forward and trust that he makes the best decisions for us every single time let's just bow in prayer tonight gracious Lord Jesus we're so thankful for your word amen we're so thankful that you did send Malachi Malachi 4 you sent us Elijah father you gave us the ability to have our hearts turn back to the Pentecostal Faith of Our Fathers Lord and Lord Lord the only way that could ever happen is because you chose us to be able to do that and we understand that to the degree that we can and we're so thankful for it Lord tonight Lord I pray that the words that were spoken would Lord just find the mark in the hearts of your children Lord the way that you've in intended father we pray that if there's any confusion or maybe frustration or or maybe someone's not sure father we pray that your word would Quicken it to our hearts Lord Quicken it to our Souls father that you would allow us to separate from our minds and our intellectual thinking Lord and and Lord just get right to our very Souls with your word because that's where life begins and father when your word germinates in our soul we know there's a new creature that comes forth a new new creature that grows inside of us Lord Jesus tonight we just want to continue to remember brother Pete clawen in prayer father we pray that you would just touch him Lord that you would raise him up in the name of Jesus he's been a faithful servant Lord for decades and Lord we know that Lord he's tired in his body and Lord sick as well and we pray that you would just heal Him Father in the name of Jesus father we just love you and we thank you and tonight we just want to commit each life into your hands as we go our separate ways Lord father as we as we travel Lord we pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us let us not ever take it for granted Lord that we've arrived back home safely again or that we've ever gone to our destination safely lord it's only because you have your angels encamp about us that we are safe and we trust in you that way Lord we just want to give you all the praise and all the glory of Our Lives we just commit each life into your hands now as we go our separate ways in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen I will take you from the [Music] Nations and bring you to your old land where I'll be Sanctified in you that's not a destination that's in the Holy [Music] Ghost a new heart will I give you you and place my spirit within I'll sprinkle clean water on you and save
