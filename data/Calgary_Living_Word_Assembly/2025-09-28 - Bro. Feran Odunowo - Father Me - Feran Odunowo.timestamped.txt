[0:11] [Music]
[0:20] Oh father of the fatherless
[0:25] in whom all families
[0:28] are blessed. I love the way you found
[0:34] me.
[0:39] You gave me life, forgave the past. Now
[0:44] in your arms, I'm safe at last. I love
[0:50] the way you f
[0:53] me.
[0:56] Father me
[0:59] forever. You'll father me.
[1:04] And in your embrace I'll be
[1:08] forever secure.
[1:13] I love the way you f
[1:17] me.
[1:20] I love the way you f
[1:24] me.
[1:28] When bruised and broken, I draw near.
[1:33] You hold me close and dry my tears. I
[1:38] love the way you father
[1:42] me.
[1:46] I'd lost my fear for hurt still.
[1:51] Surrender to your perfect will. I love
[1:56] the way you father
[1:59] me.
[2:03] Father me
[2:06] forever. You'll father me.
[2:10] And in your embrace, I'll be
[2:14] forever secure.
[2:19] I love the way you found
[2:23] me.
[2:25] I love the way you f
[2:29] me.
[2:34] If in my foolishness
[2:36] I stray, returning empty and ashamed, I
[2:42] love the way you found
[2:47] me.
[2:51] Exchanging for my wretchedness,
[2:55] your radiant robes of righteousness.
[2:59] I love the way you father
[3:04] me.
[3:07] Father me
[3:10] forever. You father me.
[3:14] And in your embrace I'll be
[3:18] forever secure.
[3:23] I love the way you find
[3:27] me.
[3:29] I love the way you found
[3:33] me.
[3:37] And when I look into your eyes from deep
[3:42] within my spirit cries, I love the way
[3:47] you father
[3:50] me.
[3:54] Before such love I stand amazed. I never
[3:59] will through endless days. I love the
[4:04] way you father
[4:07] me.
[4:10] Father me
[4:12] forever. You father me.
[4:16] And in your embrace, I'll be
[4:21] forever secure.
[4:24] [Music]
[4:25] I love the way you find
[4:29] me.
[4:31] I love the way you found
[4:35] me.
[4:38] I love the way you found
[4:43] the me.
[4:46] [Music]
[4:51] [Applause]
