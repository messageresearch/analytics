[55:22] youth uh service at our house afterwards
[55:25] we'll have lunch and then
[55:27] uh we'll discuss a few things with the
[55:28] youth there and certainly looking
[55:30] forward to that um we have a breakfast
[55:33] actually on Saturday morning for those
[55:34] people who are interested the brothers
[55:36] it's uh Men's breakfast um that will be

[55:56] on the 26th of February we will have the
[55:59] men's meeting the annual gen men's
[56:00] meeting here with the church so we will
[56:02] cancel the service it's a Wednesday
[56:04] night and uh we will meet in the
[56:06] basement and just go over all of the
[56:08] Relevant Church matters that we need to
[56:11] and then uh as I've mentioned in the
[56:12] past September 12th 13th and 14th we
[56:15] have brother Andrew Glover here and uh
[56:17] certainly looking forward to a wonderful
[56:19] time around the word in those days and
[56:22] we actually uh we were able to engineer
[56:25] these times so that we can actually have
[56:28] the majority of the people here I had
[56:29] scheduled it during the summer and kind
[56:31] of caught the tail end of August when
[56:33] people were going away and hopefully
[56:36] this time we can have as many people
[56:38] that would want to be a part of it be
[56:39] able to be a part of it and and not
[56:41] traveling but I know it's impossible to
[56:44] to make it work for everyone um we're
[56:46] all busy people and making plans so we
[56:48] certainly trust that you'll be able to
[56:50] make it and if you can't we certainly
[56:53] have the opportunity for you to stream
[56:55] or uh
[56:57] potentially listen later are you happy
[56:59] this morning amen amen certainly
[57:02] thankful for the opportunity to gather
[57:04] together again in his name um what I'd
[57:07] like to do today is uh just get into a
[57:11] little bit of church order I had
[57:13] mentioned in the past that it was
[57:15] something that I really wanted to do and
[57:17] uh I I really do want to do it so we're
[57:20] going to do it we're going to get into
[57:22] talking about church order and you know
[57:24] we're not just talking about the the
[57:26] Natural Things even though the Natural
[57:28] Things type the spiritual things you see
[57:32] the way people live their lives and the
[57:34] outward expression demonstrates what's
[57:37] going on on the inside and and that's
[57:39] just the way it is with humans with uh
[57:42] people and so when we're in the church
[57:44] we have uh we talked about it last week
[57:47] and I think it's really important I'm
[57:48] going to keep talking about it and I
[57:50] don't mean to do it in
[57:51] a in a way that makes people feel bad or
[57:54] uncomfortable it's just um it's
[57:57] important to make sure that we're having
[57:58] communication that that someone is
[58:01] talking and someone is listening and you
[58:03] know we're able to do that back and
[58:04] forth and and there's certain
[58:05] expectations that we do have for the
[58:07] house of the Lord and if we never
[58:09] communicate them then I think it's uh
[58:12] it's not really fair to expect anybody
[58:14] to behave any other way than they're
[58:16] used to behaving we come from many
[58:19] different walks many different
[58:20] backgrounds many different traditions
[58:23] and teachings even in the message of of
[58:26] the hour yes let's let's be honest one
[58:29] person on one side of the country might
[58:31] be taught something in the message of
[58:32] the hour that someone on the other side
[58:34] of the country could be taught something
[58:36] totally different what we want to do is
[58:38] walk right down the middle of the road
[58:40] and do exactly what the word says to do
[58:43] amen I think it's so beautiful the
[58:44] scripture that we read this morning out
[58:46] of 1 Corinthians chap 11 Paul who is the
[58:49] Apostle to the age he is the prophet to
[58:53] the age the age messenger his job was
[58:57] probably um maybe even the heaviest job
[59:00] out of all of the Apostles I'm not
[59:02] saying it is but maybe it was because he
[59:04] had to take and set the entire church in
[59:06] order according to the word and
[59:09] everybody had their own ideas they were
[59:11] coming out of Law and they needed to
[59:13] experience Grace but there was an order
[59:16] for that Grace to actually take place
[59:19] and that's what Paul was actually doing
[59:21] and that's why we have read this
[59:23] scripture here today I think it's so
[59:25] wonderful because really what Paul
[59:26] preached is what we believe that's the
[59:28] bottom line some people will say that we
[59:31] we we we're part of a cult that we
[59:33] follow a man William Mariam brandom and
[59:35] I'm I'm going to dig into that today a
[59:37] little bit I think it's really important
[59:38] to talk about it and I'm going to talk
[59:40] freely today so I trust that you'll bear
[59:41] with me in in maybe my Folly as we go
[59:45] forwards with it because it's important
[59:47] to be clear it's important to talk
[59:49] openly and honestly about this stuff so
[59:52] that there's an understanding of what's
[59:54] going on because many times people will
[59:56] hear oh William Bram who is that and
[59:59] what will they do
[1:00:00] immediately or and then whatever comes
[1:00:03] up is truth
[1:00:05] right that's the way it is now y people
[1:00:09] fact check I've even heard of people
[1:00:10] factchecking during the
[1:00:13] preaching not in this congregation for
[1:00:15] the record but I've heard it's a thing
[1:00:17] when you bring something and and you're
[1:00:19] saying that this is fact or this is what
[1:00:21] you know is what I believe or what I'm
[1:00:23] thinking or or feeling some people
[1:00:25] they're Skeptics and you know we live in
[1:00:27] a world where the whole world is
[1:00:30] skeptical and and even more so around
[1:00:33] people who are actually seeking the
[1:00:36] truth but remember brothers and sisters
[1:00:39] if you can find the truth the truth will
[1:00:41] make you free the truth will make you
[1:00:44] free and that's why we're here today I
[1:00:46] believe because we desire the truth
[1:00:48] we're not interested in false Doctrine
[1:00:50] we're not interested in getting hitched
[1:00:52] up with some kind of a cult or some kind
[1:00:54] of a a a thing where people are just
[1:00:56] going to be a part of an association
[1:00:58] that will put us into the path of
[1:01:01] Destruction that'll put us in the Great
[1:01:03] Tribulation we want to go on the
[1:01:05] Rapture and we're not screaming crying
[1:01:07] for the Rapture to come crying out Lord
[1:01:09] please hasten the day so we can have the
[1:01:11] Rapture what we want to do is fulfill
[1:01:12] the purpose that God's brought us here
[1:01:14] for we're all here for a purpose yes and
[1:01:17] who knows what that purpose is some some
[1:01:19] some purposes are are to be Apostles and
[1:01:22] and some are to be prophets and some are
[1:01:24] to be evangelists and and and and and we
[1:01:28] know there's gifts in the church
[1:01:30] right evangelists and teachers pastors
[1:01:35] we we all have a role to play and and
[1:01:37] some might say well you know I I don't
[1:01:39] fit that role at all I would say this
[1:01:41] brothers and sisters we're we're Kings
[1:01:43] and Priests according to God and
[1:01:46] especially the brothers we're pastors of
[1:01:48] our
[1:01:48] home we're pastors of our home we're the
[1:01:51] ones executing the office of the priest
[1:01:55] for our amilies and if we're not maybe
[1:01:58] we should take a look at it because our
[1:02:00] families are depending on it we're The
[1:02:03] Gatekeepers it's up to us to lay in the
[1:02:06] gate anyways uh talking about
[1:02:08] expectations and perceived versus
[1:02:11] communicated you know and the conduct in
[1:02:12] the house of the Lord in this house of
[1:02:14] the Lord just a few housekeeping items I
[1:02:17] just want to mention them continue to
[1:02:18] hold them before us brothers and sisters
[1:02:20] the basement is an extension of the
[1:02:22] sanctuary it is not a place to go and
[1:02:25] have a social Fair during the service
[1:02:27] it's not a place to have children
[1:02:29] running around with cars it's a place to
[1:02:31] just maybe take children that are a bit
[1:02:33] squirmy and maybe it's too hot in here
[1:02:36] whatever it is it needs to be an
[1:02:38] extension to the sanctuary we want to
[1:02:39] create an environment where we can go
[1:02:41] somewhere else with children so that if
[1:02:43] they're children in this Sanctuary that
[1:02:45] are squirming and and making noise and
[1:02:47] making a fuss you can pick them up and
[1:02:49] take them out and I would like to remind
[1:02:51] everyone to parents please be conscious
[1:02:54] of it because if your children are are
[1:02:56] fidgety and making noise it might be
[1:02:58] something that we're totally toned deaf
[1:02:59] to we could be completely used to that
[1:03:01] sound because that's what they do all
[1:03:02] the time but I I I think maybe sometimes
[1:03:05] in the house of the Lord people aren't
[1:03:06] aware that other people aren't used to
[1:03:09] that and when children are making little
[1:03:11] noises they can really irritate people
[1:03:14] and cause people to miss what's being
[1:03:15] said so I just want to encourage
[1:03:18] everyone the basement is an extension of
[1:03:19] the sanctuary please take your children
[1:03:21] down if they can't sit still in here or
[1:03:23] they need a drink or they need to go out
[1:03:24] you're welcome to go downstairs even if
[1:03:26] you feel a little bit warm in the
[1:03:27] service I'll say this too brothers and
[1:03:29] sisters if you're starting to feel
[1:03:30] sleepy it's a devil the devil wants you
[1:03:33] to go to sleep and not get what's coming
[1:03:35] out of the service if you start to feel
[1:03:37] a little sleepy just get up and go for a
[1:03:39] walk we have speakers in the washrooms
[1:03:41] for a purpose we have speakers in the
[1:03:43] basement for a
[1:03:45] purpose you can go and and and and just
[1:03:48] still be a part of the service even in
[1:03:50] the basement we just want to remind
[1:03:52] parents to monitor your children don't
[1:03:54] leave it to the deacon it's not their
[1:03:56] responsibility we're not one of those
[1:03:58] churches where you can just drop your
[1:04:00] children off in the basement and
[1:04:02] someone's going to watch them for you
[1:04:03] there's churches that are like that
[1:04:06] they're available if someone really
[1:04:07] needs that where they'll even give you a
[1:04:10] pager when you drop your child
[1:04:12] off this isn't the type of church that
[1:04:15] does that it's up to the parents to
[1:04:17] watch over your children so we just
[1:04:18] would like to ask that you please watch
[1:04:20] over your children and if they make a
[1:04:21] mess just clean it up for them and you
[1:04:23] know if you find a situation happens and
[1:04:25] you can or you're confused about the
[1:04:27] situation how to deal with it just ask a
[1:04:28] deacon the deacons will gladly assist
[1:04:31] you they're here for you we are all here
[1:04:33] for you and uh I hope that's okay I'm
[1:04:37] just going to continue to remind us and
[1:04:39] just trust that uh we'll just be able to
[1:04:41] be a blessing one to another in the
[1:04:42] house of the Lord as we go forwards you
[1:04:46] know we're uh talking about church order
[1:04:48] and uh basically I I just want to get
[1:04:50] into kind of what we believe and you
[1:04:53] know we listened to church order by
[1:04:55] William Mariam Branham in 1958 he
[1:04:58] preached this message it was uh number
[1:05:01] 107 and and we listen to it on a
[1:05:04] Wednesday night and I'm just going to
[1:05:05] pick through this and I'm going to take
[1:05:07] my time and go through through it real
[1:05:08] slow he preached another message on
[1:05:10] Church order and we'll go through that
[1:05:12] one and we'll pick our way through it
[1:05:14] where we need to but I just want to make
[1:05:16] sure that we all understand the
[1:05:17] direction that we're going each and
[1:05:20] every church is Sovereign we are not a
[1:05:22] part of an association there is no
[1:05:25] endorsement by any other church that
[1:05:28] gives us the ability to worship the way
[1:05:30] we do there is no separate um entity
[1:05:34] that actually funds this church this
[1:05:36] church is completely Sovereign it's
[1:05:38] governed
[1:05:40] independently excuse me by the the
[1:05:42] boards there's two boards one is the
[1:05:45] Deacon board the other one is the
[1:05:46] trustee board the deacons deal with the
[1:05:49] church matters the deacons are the call
[1:05:52] it spiritual leaders in the church
[1:05:54] that's an actual office in the church
[1:05:57] the lay Ministry is not an office in the
[1:06:00] church it's it's lay Ministry and
[1:06:03] there's wonderful gifts I'm not disput
[1:06:05] disputing that at all but the actual
[1:06:07] Church offices are the deacons and the
[1:06:09] trustees they're a part of what governs
[1:06:12] the church and I I just think it's
[1:06:14] wonderful brother Bram talks so clearly
[1:06:16] in these messages and we could just uh
[1:06:19] just press play and I feel like I could
[1:06:21] sit down he would say it much better
[1:06:22] than me but there's a couple things that
[1:06:23] I just want to really drill down into as
[1:06:25] we go forwards
[1:06:27] today you know brother bam he says in
[1:06:29] this message in uh Church order as
[1:06:32] mentioned 1958 17 he says we believe in
[1:06:36] an Apostolic
[1:06:38] Church teaching Apostolic blessings for
[1:06:41] peoples of this day I'm just going to go
[1:06:44] through sort of what he says we believe
[1:06:47] and then I'm going to come back and
[1:06:48] actually elaborate but I think there's a
[1:06:50] few things in here that are really
[1:06:51] important and uh it it's so good to hear
[1:06:54] this is what we believe brothers and
[1:06:56] sisters we believe in an Apostolic
[1:06:58] Church teaching Apostolic blessings for
[1:07:00] peoples of this day um we believe in the
[1:07:04] Full Gospel and believe that all the
[1:07:06] signs and wonders that was spoken of by
[1:07:09] our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany
[1:07:12] his church until he
[1:07:15] returns not until someone says they
[1:07:18] should be
[1:07:19] over he goes on to say we believe in
[1:07:22] those things and believe that they are
[1:07:24] to be set in in
[1:07:26] order that the church has its order and
[1:07:30] that each church has its doctrines and
[1:07:33] Order and
[1:07:35] discipline he goes on to say our church
[1:07:38] has no members as joiners we believe
[1:07:41] that the whole Universal Church of the
[1:07:43] Living God is our brothers and our
[1:07:46] sisters isn't that beautiful I'm just
[1:07:50] going to skip down and talk a little bit
[1:07:52] about what he says in in the next
[1:07:53] paragraph he says we believe in
[1:07:55] justification by faith Romans 51 he goes
[1:07:59] on to say we believe that the blood of
[1:08:02] Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for
[1:08:06] the service of the Lord and you know we
[1:08:09] talked about justification and
[1:08:12] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:08:14] Holy Ghost maybe I'll go back and read
[1:08:16] this paragraph I think it's important I
[1:08:17] hope it's okay if I do a lot of quoting
[1:08:19] today but I got a lot of talking that I
[1:08:21] want to do as well but I'd rather hear a
[1:08:23] Vindicated prophet's words than my words
[1:08:26] he says we believe in justification by
[1:08:28] faith Romans 5:1 we believe that after a
[1:08:31] person being justified by Faith remember
[1:08:34] that was Luther's protest he has peace
[1:08:37] with the Lord Jesus Christ and many
[1:08:40] people are willing to just stop there
[1:08:41] and say Amen bless God I'm a Christian
[1:08:43] I'm a good person and and sure enough
[1:08:46] likely they are but it might not be
[1:08:48] enough to actually see the entire
[1:08:50] blessing the apostolic blessing that's
[1:08:52] in the church and so we have brother
[1:08:55] about I'm saying here but it's possible
[1:08:57] that this same person could have habits
[1:08:59] such as drinking smoking doing things
[1:09:03] that he should not do filthy habits of
[1:09:06] the flesh wait a second I thought I
[1:09:08] thought he said that that we believe in
[1:09:10] justification by faith Romans 51 we
[1:09:12] believe that after a person being
[1:09:13] justified by faith he has peace with the
[1:09:15] Lord Jesus
[1:09:16] Christ I've got peace with God I I know
[1:09:20] that he died for me and rose again on
[1:09:21] the third day and and and I've accepted
[1:09:23] him as my savior but I still just can't
[1:09:25] kick smoking I just don't understand it
[1:09:28] I just can't quit drinking I've got this
[1:09:30] thing where I I just have to have a
[1:09:33] little sip here and there and everywhere
[1:09:35] it just I can't get rid of it I just
[1:09:37] can't stop watching movies I can't stop
[1:09:39] scrolling I can't stop whatever it is in
[1:09:42] our life if you can't stop it brothers
[1:09:44] and sisters there's a
[1:09:46] problem we need to actually seek the
[1:09:48] Lord but you know we can live in this
[1:09:50] state here and be good people yes many
[1:09:54] people do it
[1:09:56] amen there's a furtherance to
[1:09:59] it we can have peace with
[1:10:02] God but it's possible that the same
[1:10:04] person could have habits such as
[1:10:05] drinking smoking doing things that he
[1:10:07] should not do filthy habits of the flesh
[1:10:10] then we believe that the blood of Jesus
[1:10:12] Christ sanctifies this person for the
[1:10:15] service of the Lord so we have the
[1:10:17] justification process and then we have
[1:10:19] the sanctification process brother bam
[1:10:22] says and that's we believe in
[1:10:24] sanctification according to Hebrews
[1:10:26] 13:12 and 13 maybe let's turn over there
[1:10:28] today let's turn to Hebrews
[1:10:33] 13 just so we understand what he's
[1:10:35] saying as he references these
[1:10:43] verses I trust that everyone's warm by
[1:10:46] the grace of God it's a pretty miserable
[1:10:48] drive in this
[1:10:50] morning but we're certainly thankful for
[1:10:52] his traveling mercies amen amen
[1:10:56] in Hebrews chapter
[1:11:00] 13 verses 12 and
[1:11:04] 13 wherefore Jesus also that he might
[1:11:07] sanctify the people with his own blood
[1:11:10] suffered without the
[1:11:12] gate I I just love how he doesn't just
[1:11:14] read verse 12 it's not just the
[1:11:16] reference to verse 12 it's verse 13 as
[1:11:18] well let us go forth therefore unto him
[1:11:22] without the camp bearing his reproach
[1:11:27] how important is that brothers and
[1:11:28] sisters to make sure that we're bearing
[1:11:29] his reproach not our reproach if we look
[1:11:32] at our reproach we're failed it's over
[1:11:35] our reproach is continual and Perpetual
[1:11:39] until the day that we actually change
[1:11:41] these Robes of flesh but if we're
[1:11:43] willing to bear his reproach he paid it
[1:11:45] all that we wouldn't have to right if
[1:11:49] we're willing to judge ourself according
[1:11:51] to his word then we shouldn't need to be
[1:11:53] judged right I think it's just a
[1:11:56] beautiful thing here he goes on to say
[1:11:59] I'll just read where I left off here any
[1:12:01] and and that's we believe in
[1:12:03] sanctification according to Hebrews
[1:12:05] 13:12 and 13 whereby Jesus also that he
[1:12:08] might sanctify the people with his own
[1:12:10] blood suffered without the gates and we
[1:12:12] believe that sanctification is taught in
[1:12:15] the New Testament and meant for the
[1:12:18] Believers through the New Testament age
[1:12:22] which we are now living that's the age
[1:12:25] in which we're in brothers and sisters
[1:12:26] it doesn't cease it's not going to cease
[1:12:29] until the Rapture of the bride goes home
[1:12:33] because when she goes up Satan comes
[1:12:34] down that's going to be the next major
[1:12:37] change in the dispensations we know
[1:12:40] there was a major change at Calvary when
[1:12:42] Christ came it was Major when Christ
[1:12:45] came but when he actually died and rose
[1:12:48] again and triumphed over death hell and
[1:12:50] the grave for our sake what he did was
[1:12:53] showed there was an open Triumph of the
[1:12:56] love the love of Jesus Christ for his
[1:12:59] bride the next one that's going to
[1:13:01] happen is the rapture of his bride the
[1:13:03] catching away of his
[1:13:05] wife brother bradam goes on to say and
[1:13:08] we also believe that after the person
[1:13:10] has been Sanctified first they've been
[1:13:12] Justified then they've been Sanctified
[1:13:15] the unclean habits has gone from the
[1:13:19] person he is a Believer on the Lord
[1:13:22] Jesus Christ and his habits are
[1:13:26] gone we believe that he then is a
[1:13:30] candidate for the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:32] Spirit which comes as a filling of the
[1:13:36] believer and then when the believer dot
[1:13:38] dot dot I'm going to pause there I think
[1:13:40] it's important brothers and sisters to
[1:13:43] to to to just dwell on this for a second
[1:13:46] because I want to say this as a question
[1:13:48] I'm not going to ask you to raise your
[1:13:50] hand I'll say raise it in your heart how
[1:13:52] many people have been candidates for the
[1:13:55] Holy Ghost in their lives you know that
[1:13:56] you've been Justified you know that
[1:13:58] you've been Sanctified and I would say
[1:13:59] you know that you've even gone on to the
[1:14:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost but wait a
[1:14:03] second I still have habits in my life I
[1:14:05] can't get rid of how many people this
[1:14:10] morning hey the pastor here will raise
[1:14:12] his hand and say I've got things in my
[1:14:14] life that seem to never leave that seem
[1:14:17] to never I can never seem to conquer you
[1:14:21] know what Paul had things in his life
[1:14:23] too and he sought the Lord Thrice for it
[1:14:26] and what did the Lord say to him hey
[1:14:27] Paul you need to recognize that my grace
[1:14:30] is sufficient for you my grace doesn't
[1:14:32] give you the Liberty to make Grace a
[1:14:34] disgrace and continue sinning willfully
[1:14:37] but what it does is give you the
[1:14:39] opportunity to recognize that I've done
[1:14:41] at all it's got nothing to do with you
[1:14:43] the only thing you've got to do with it
[1:14:44] is to accept
[1:14:47] it
[1:14:49] Hallelujah hlj so we can be justified we
[1:14:51] can be Sanctified we can be filled with
[1:14:53] the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you what I
[1:14:56] want to say this brothers and sisters
[1:14:57] because I believe it with all my heart
[1:14:58] even though I still struggle in my heart
[1:15:00] in my life and my mind my mind is the
[1:15:03] worst
[1:15:04] place that's the the place the Devil
[1:15:07] comes and tries to get us but you know
[1:15:09] what I I I realize is it's not that we
[1:15:13] haven't been delivered we've been
[1:15:14] delivered every single time we cry out
[1:15:17] to Christ we've been delivered if we
[1:15:19] want to be he's already given it to us
[1:15:22] am the only thing is the Devil Comes
[1:15:25] around and says no you're not don't you
[1:15:27] remember how fun that is don't you
[1:15:29] remember how wonderful that is of an
[1:15:31] experience to do or whatever it is to
[1:15:35] think to say to act all of the stuff
[1:15:37] that we do as human
[1:15:39] beings and then suddenly we find
[1:15:41] ourselves doing it and then we're like
[1:15:43] see I know I don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:15:45] here I go again on this stupid
[1:15:49] cycle the best thing that we could ever
[1:15:51] do brothers and sisters is ignore our
[1:15:52] flesh ignore our problems make them
[1:15:55] right when we make them wrong because we
[1:15:56] do and we have to we've got to go and
[1:15:58] apologize we've got to submit ourselves
[1:16:01] one to another in the fear of God right
[1:16:05] if we're not willing to do that he can't
[1:16:06] help us that's right but when we're
[1:16:08] willing to do that if we can do it
[1:16:10] quickly why was David a man after God's
[1:16:12] Own
[1:16:13] Heart we had such I believe such a
[1:16:15] powerful prayer meeting on Thursday my
[1:16:17] goodness Hallelujah brothers and sisters
[1:16:19] why did David have the the description
[1:16:23] that he was a a man after God's Own
[1:16:25] Heart is because he repented
[1:16:28] quickly that's what the Vindicated
[1:16:30] Prophet said in our
[1:16:31] age he was quick to repent so he was a
[1:16:35] man after God's Own Heart he wanted to
[1:16:37] see the Lord in his life remember he was
[1:16:39] a murderer he was an adulterer he had
[1:16:42] all these things in his life that he had
[1:16:44] to to to witness and and say yep when
[1:16:47] someone come around and say you remember
[1:16:49] what you did he would have to say yeah
[1:16:54] yeah and it's wonderful because Paul
[1:16:56] would say yeah not me but the sin that
[1:17:00] lith in me that c nature that I can
[1:17:02] never Escape because it's in my DNA I
[1:17:04] just can't get rid of
[1:17:06] it but David was quick to repent right
[1:17:10] amen even when the prophet came to him
[1:17:12] and said hey you know there's this man
[1:17:14] he's got this problem in this Kingdom
[1:17:16] and he's got all this money he's got all
[1:17:18] everything in his life he's got at all
[1:17:21] and this's one person with this one
[1:17:23] Widow with this one little lamb and this
[1:17:26] guy with everything just had to go and
[1:17:28] take that little
[1:17:29] lamb what did David
[1:17:32] say that man should die that man
[1:17:35] deserves death that's what David said
[1:17:38] and the prophet turned to him and said
[1:17:40] That's you that's you David and what did
[1:17:43] he do he repented but think about it
[1:17:45] brothers and sisters this is the god
[1:17:47] that we serve this is a God that has a a
[1:17:50] a heart for his children he has a desire
[1:17:53] to see us come High
[1:17:55] think about it this Ahab who was married
[1:17:59] to
[1:18:00] Jezebel we know the story we know all
[1:18:03] about him and all the stories and how
[1:18:05] terrible he was and the backsliding
[1:18:07] condition remember when the prophet came
[1:18:09] and told
[1:18:10] him you're doomed for what you've done
[1:18:14] the dogs are going to lick your
[1:18:16] blood you will not make it back from
[1:18:19] Battle and and and we know what happened
[1:18:25] Ahab this rank sinner who had that wife
[1:18:28] Jezebel the word of God says that he
[1:18:30] walked softly before God he recognized
[1:18:32] oh my I know that God's real and I know
[1:18:34] that I'm a backslider but I'm just going
[1:18:36] to tiptoe because I know what's going on
[1:18:38] here the prophets actually said the word
[1:18:40] of God the prophet said thus saith the
[1:18:42] Lord to me concerning me and what
[1:18:45] happened God said hey I heard his his
[1:18:48] his testimony I've seen the way he's
[1:18:50] walked softly and I want you to tell him
[1:18:52] I'm not going to bring it back in his
[1:18:54] day but it's going to come out upon his
[1:18:56] children and that's where I think
[1:18:57] brothers and sisters we can live a good
[1:18:58] life here today but if we're not serving
[1:19:00] God with all of our heart if it's some
[1:19:02] sort of a hidden sin thing where we're
[1:19:04] just only going so far you know what's
[1:19:06] going to happen we might be fine but our
[1:19:08] children might not be our children might
[1:19:11] be the ones who bear the reproach for
[1:19:12] our sin we need to make sure we know
[1:19:15] exactly what we're doing and that's why
[1:19:17] I think it's so important to make sure
[1:19:19] that we establish the church on proper
[1:19:22] conduct order and Doctrine to get Church
[1:19:24] short are established properly we can
[1:19:26] assume that everybody understands
[1:19:28] courtship dating and marriage we can
[1:19:30] assume that everyone does but I promise
[1:19:32] you everyone doesn't understand what
[1:19:35] that means if we're dating in the
[1:19:37] message you're not in the message dating
[1:19:39] is not a word for believers because
[1:19:41] dating means you're going to go and try
[1:19:43] it out and see if it works and if it
[1:19:44] doesn't work well I'm just going to move
[1:19:46] on it doesn't matter no when we engage
[1:19:50] ourselves to have a conversation with
[1:19:53] one or the other a man or a woman it
[1:19:56] oughtn't to be a boy or a girl but it
[1:19:58] should be a man or a woman if we're
[1:20:00] going to do that then we ought to be
[1:20:01] doing it with all all of our heart we
[1:20:02] should be doing it with the full intent
[1:20:04] to be married with children with that
[1:20:06] individual and if we're not in that
[1:20:08] position we don't do
[1:20:10] it dating is not in the vocabulary of a
[1:20:14] Believer anyways courtship
[1:20:17] is carrying on what brother bramy says
[1:20:19] here we also believe that after the
[1:20:21] person has been Sanctified the unclean
[1:20:23] habits has gone from the person he is a
[1:20:26] Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:20:29] his habits are gone I can tell you
[1:20:32] brothers and sisters he'll take habits
[1:20:33] away he'll take the ones away that need
[1:20:35] to be away and he'll leave the ones that
[1:20:37] need to remind us about his grace that's
[1:20:40] what it comes down to he'll take the
[1:20:42] ones away that will drive us into the
[1:20:44] ground but he will leave just maybe one
[1:20:46] or two to remind us about his grace I
[1:20:49] think it's so important to remember that
[1:20:51] we're going to fight all the way to the
[1:20:54] rapture
[1:20:55] or we're going to fight all the way to
[1:20:57] hell we're going to fight brothers and
[1:20:59] sisters one way or another that's the
[1:21:01] life that we've been given so we might
[1:21:04] as well be on the winning side right
[1:21:06] brother bam goes on to say it's just as
[1:21:08] many times as I have taught it like
[1:21:10] picking up a glass out of the chicken
[1:21:11] yard if anybody's ever seen a chicken
[1:21:14] yard you'll know what he's saying it's
[1:21:15] filthy it's all full of manure and you
[1:21:17] have a glass that's left in a chicken
[1:21:19] yard it it just gets disgusting you'd
[1:21:21] probably never want to use it again
[1:21:22] although you could if if it wasn't
[1:21:24] cracked or broken and and You' be able
[1:21:26] to pick it up and justify it brother bam
[1:21:29] he says justification is picking it up
[1:21:32] ready to use it with a purpose in heart
[1:21:35] that's what God does to The Sinner but
[1:21:38] he's still
[1:21:40] filthy then he excuse me then he is
[1:21:43] cleansed by the blood of Jesus
[1:21:46] Christ and the word sanctify is a
[1:21:49] compound word which means cleaned and
[1:21:51] set aside for service in the old
[1:21:54] Testament the altar Sanctified The
[1:21:57] Vessel and it was set aside for
[1:22:01] service he goes on to say this is
[1:22:04] probably one of the most important parts
[1:22:06] brothers and sisters because it can
[1:22:08] sound like justification sanctification
[1:22:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost you're
[1:22:12] climbing steps you're going up the
[1:22:15] stairs the ladder you're trying to get
[1:22:17] to the next level it's not a video game
[1:22:19] we're not trying to go on an adventure
[1:22:21] it's not our our our our actions don't
[1:22:24] actually caused us to be Believers
[1:22:26] because we're Believers we have actions
[1:22:29] it's very important to remember this
[1:22:31] brother bam he says we believe the holy
[1:22:33] spirit is putting the same vessel in
[1:22:36] service we don't become a new vessel and
[1:22:40] that's why the devil tries to play so
[1:22:41] hard on us to say look at you you're the
[1:22:43] old guy you're the old girl you're the
[1:22:45] same person nothing's happened in your
[1:22:47] life something's truly happened in our
[1:22:50] lives when we've been Justified and
[1:22:51] we've been Sanctified brother bramy said
[1:22:54] says this and I think it's so important
[1:22:56] to remember that the holy spirit is not
[1:22:59] another step of Grace right many times
[1:23:03] it's taught that way in the
[1:23:04] denominations and sometimes even in
[1:23:06] around the message it's taught that way
[1:23:08] it's not that way we have the prophet
[1:23:10] for our day saying we believe the holy
[1:23:13] spirit is putting the same vessel in
[1:23:14] service that the holy spirit is not
[1:23:17] another step of Grace but more of the
[1:23:20] same
[1:23:21] Grace more of the same Grace that picks
[1:23:24] the glass up out of the chicken yard
[1:23:26] more of the same Grace that brings that
[1:23:28] chicken Yard glass to church to become
[1:23:31] Washed by the Water of the disinfecting
[1:23:34] word from all of the filth of this world
[1:23:37] that's why we come to church to get
[1:23:38] Washed by the Water of the word amen but
[1:23:42] it's more of the same Grace that fills
[1:23:44] the believer to the extent where that
[1:23:47] signs and wonders such as the apostolic
[1:23:50] gift spoken in 1 Corinthians chapter 12
[1:23:53] manifest themselves through this
[1:23:55] believer when the Holy Spirit comes to
[1:23:57] take up the
[1:23:59] gift let's turn back over to First
[1:24:02] Corinthians chapter
[1:24:03] 12 just so we make sure we're on the
[1:24:06] same page with what he's talking
[1:24:12] about it's beautiful
[1:24:18] here I love it because both of the
[1:24:20] footnotes or the header notes in my
[1:24:22] Bible it says spiritual gifts on both
[1:24:23] pages
[1:24:26] spiritual gifts are
[1:24:29] important brother bam or
[1:24:32] sorry the
[1:24:34] word in chapter 12 1 Corinthians 12:1 it
[1:24:38] says now concerning spiritual gifts
[1:24:40] Brethren I would not have you ignorant
[1:24:43] isn't that beautiful we should
[1:24:46] understand spiritual gifts it shouldn't
[1:24:48] be something that we don't know that
[1:24:50] we're not aware of properly he says ye
[1:24:53] know that you were Gentiles carried away
[1:24:57] unto these dumb Idols even as ye were
[1:25:01] LED how many were a gentile carried away
[1:25:03] unto a dumb Idol I can say that I was I
[1:25:06] I went out into the Wilderness I had to
[1:25:08] be led away and have some dumb Idols in
[1:25:11] my life he goes on to say wherefore I
[1:25:14] gave you to understand I give you to
[1:25:17] understand that no man speaking by the
[1:25:19] spirit of God calleth Jesus a
[1:25:22] cursed so nobody speaking by the spirit
[1:25:25] of God is going to curse jesus' name and
[1:25:29] that no man can say that Jesus is the
[1:25:31] Lord but by the Holy Ghost isn't it
[1:25:35] beautiful the perspective we've been
[1:25:37] given as Believers of this
[1:25:39] message understanding the message is
[1:25:42] Jesus Christ we're believing Jesus
[1:25:43] Christ we're believing every single word
[1:25:45] of this Bible that's our absolute that's
[1:25:47] our reference point we go back to the
[1:25:49] prophet all the time but the prophet
[1:25:51] goes to the Bible that's why we do it
[1:25:53] but you know nobody is going to be able
[1:25:55] to say Lord without having the Holy
[1:25:57] Ghost in their life nobody many people
[1:25:59] are going to say Lord but many are going
[1:26:01] to go to you know the scripture many
[1:26:03] will come to me in that day and say Lord
[1:26:04] Lord have we not cast out devils in thy
[1:26:06] name haven't we seen many wonderful
[1:26:08] Mighty works and had many prayer
[1:26:09] services and song services and all the
[1:26:11] different services oh my we had such a
[1:26:13] wonderful life of Christianity believing
[1:26:15] the message of the hour down there
[1:26:16] didn't we and he's going to say depart
[1:26:18] from me because you worked iniquity and
[1:26:20] I never even knew you you weren't
[1:26:22] willing to actually go all the way to
[1:26:25] calling me Lord from your
[1:26:27] heart we know that the word says that
[1:26:30] many times people will say it with their
[1:26:31] lips but their hearts are far from
[1:26:34] them we need to know where we stand
[1:26:36] brothers and sisters and all it takes is
[1:26:38] just complete surrender to the to to the
[1:26:40] Lord to be able to call him Lord means
[1:26:42] that he governs every aspect of Our
[1:26:45] Lives not most of them not some of them
[1:26:49] but every aspect of Our Lives Hallelujah
[1:26:53] show some something in there whatever
[1:26:55] you want to say every aspect of Our
[1:26:58] Lives when he's in that position of Our
[1:27:00] Lives then he's Lord until he's in that
[1:27:03] position of Our Lives he ain't Lord
[1:27:05] we're just calling him Lord it sounds
[1:27:08] good we've been taught that it's a
[1:27:10] tradition he needs to govern every
[1:27:12] single area of our lives and you know
[1:27:14] I'm I'm saying this in such a way that
[1:27:15] I'm saying Lord help me all the way
[1:27:17] along here cuz I know me I know where I
[1:27:19] stand I know the struggles I have we're
[1:27:21] all humans brothers and sisters we're
[1:27:23] all sinners saved by grace the only
[1:27:25] thing that's absolute is his word
[1:27:29] am the only way we can call him Lord is
[1:27:32] by the Holy
[1:27:33] Ghost now where there are diversities of
[1:27:36] gifts but it's the same
[1:27:39] spirit and until we can recognize this
[1:27:42] we're going to be bumbling around and
[1:27:44] and mixing stuff up and and be being
[1:27:47] confused it's going to sound different I
[1:27:49] mean who is God and who is
[1:27:51] Jesus and who's the Holy Ghost what's
[1:27:53] all this this about it wasn't until I
[1:27:56] heard about the message of the hour that
[1:27:58] I actually caught the revelation of who
[1:28:01] Jesus Christ really is I'm not going to
[1:28:05] say was I'm going to say is because he's
[1:28:08] just alive today as he ever
[1:28:10] was but I'll tell you honestly where I
[1:28:12] caught the Revelation was watching the
[1:28:15] movie called The Gospel of John and it
[1:28:18] was such an interesting time in my life
[1:28:21] I can say it because it was just my
[1:28:23] testimony and I'm sure everyone would
[1:28:25] have an opportunity given the microphone
[1:28:27] to have their testimony about when they
[1:28:29] understood this this very specific point
[1:28:31] but I just saw Jesus walking on the
[1:28:34] shoreline it was right at the end of the
[1:28:36] movie I think it was when John or they
[1:28:39] were saying you know I can't remember
[1:28:42] how the the scripture goes I'm making it
[1:28:43] confusing but anyways Jesus was walking
[1:28:46] on the shore and and he said what's it
[1:28:48] to you about whether he's here till I
[1:28:50] come or not don't worry about that just
[1:28:52] follow me what is it to you and many
[1:28:56] times we can get caught up looking at
[1:28:57] one another wondering is that for them
[1:29:00] are they supposed to be doing that
[1:29:01] should they be acting that way what is
[1:29:02] it to us brothers and sisters just
[1:29:04] follow
[1:29:05] [Music]
[1:29:07] Christ but it was during that movie that
[1:29:09] I caught the Revelation that's not a man
[1:29:11] walking on that
[1:29:13] Shoreline that's not just an ordinary
[1:29:16] man that's God Amen that's God in flesh
[1:29:21] and we can read it all a hundred times
[1:29:23] over maybe our lifetime in the beginning
[1:29:25] was the word and the Word was made flesh
[1:29:28] and dwelt Among
[1:29:30] Us Jesus Christ is God and it's it's
[1:29:35] it's it's a beautiful thing it becomes
[1:29:37] so easy many times the scholars will
[1:29:39] make it so confusing to say the father
[1:29:42] is this and the son is that and the Holy
[1:29:44] Ghost is the other they're not three
[1:29:45] persons of the Holy Trinity brothers and
[1:29:48] sisters they're all different offices of
[1:29:51] The Same Spirit the same God God
[1:29:54] manifest in three different
[1:29:57] ways and morphe is the word that was
[1:30:00] used in the message of the hour God just
[1:30:03] changing a mask it's just like a person
[1:30:05] playing three different parts in a play
[1:30:07] sometimes they'll wear a mask that looks
[1:30:09] a certain way and they'll go off the
[1:30:10] stage and get another mask and come back
[1:30:12] in and they'll play a different role
[1:30:14] with different words it's the same
[1:30:16] thing brother Bram goes on to say we
[1:30:19] believe that the holy spirit is putting
[1:30:20] the same vessel in service that the holy
[1:30:22] spirit is not another step of Grace but
[1:30:24] more of the same Grace that fills the
[1:30:27] believer to the extent where that signs
[1:30:29] and wonders such as the apostolic gift
[1:30:32] spoken in 1 Corinthians 12 manifest
[1:30:35] themselves through this
[1:30:37] believer not through the pastor not
[1:30:40] through the teacher not through the
[1:30:42] Evangelist even though all of that
[1:30:44] happens but through this believer the
[1:30:46] one that gets filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:47] right I think it's so beautiful um we'll
[1:30:49] carry on here in the scripture now there
[1:30:52] are diversities of gifts this is verse 4
[1:30:55] of 1 Corinthians CH 12 diversities of
[1:30:59] gifts but the same spirit and there are
[1:31:03] differences of
[1:31:05] administrations but the same
[1:31:07] lord and there are diversities of
[1:31:11] operations but it is the same God which
[1:31:14] worketh all in all but the manifestation
[1:31:17] of the spirit is given to every man to
[1:31:21] profit with all right for to one is
[1:31:25] given by the spirit the word of
[1:31:29] wisdom to another the word of
[1:31:33] knowledge by The Same Spirit to another
[1:31:37] Faith by The Same Spirit to another the
[1:31:43] gifts of
[1:31:44] healing by The Same Spirit to another
[1:31:49] the working of Miracles to another
[1:31:51] prophecy to another learning of spirits
[1:31:55] to another diverse kinds of tongues to
[1:31:58] another the interpretation of tongues
[1:32:01] now this one this really blew me away
[1:32:03] when I realized all of this in my
[1:32:05] spiritual walk because I was raised to
[1:32:06] believe that really the the the fruit of
[1:32:09] the spirit is the ability to speak in
[1:32:11] tongues period not even interpretation
[1:32:14] of tongues but still there's all these
[1:32:16] other gifts that are a part of it hey
[1:32:18] isn't that wonderful verse 11 says but
[1:32:21] all these worketh that one and the
[1:32:24] selfsame spirit the Holy Ghost dividing
[1:32:28] to every man severly as he
[1:32:32] will for as the body is one and hath
[1:32:35] many members and all the members of that
[1:32:37] one body being many are one body so also
[1:32:42] is
[1:32:44] Christ for by one Spirit we are all
[1:32:48] baptized into one body whether we be
[1:32:52] Jews or gentiles Iles whether we be Bond
[1:32:56] or free and have been all made to drink
[1:32:59] into one spirit for the body is not one
[1:33:04] member but
[1:33:07] many I could go on here for the sake of
[1:33:10] time I'm not going to he talks about if
[1:33:12] the foot shall say I'm not the hand and
[1:33:15] we need every single part of the body
[1:33:16] brothers and sisters we don't want to
[1:33:18] look at our pinky toe and say you stink
[1:33:21] get lost we need our pinky toe
[1:33:24] we need our nose we need our ears we
[1:33:26] need every single part of the body it's
[1:33:29] it's vital to the church that every
[1:33:31] single part of the body is here and
[1:33:33] that's why I think brothers and sisters
[1:33:35] I just want to encourage us the more so
[1:33:38] even more so as we see the day
[1:33:40] approaching if we see a brother or
[1:33:42] sister that's just not around maybe
[1:33:44] they're just stumbling maybe for some
[1:33:46] reason they're not in service reach out
[1:33:48] to them encourage them send them a text
[1:33:52] we all need each other none of us are
[1:33:54] getting out of here until we're all come
[1:33:56] into the the unity of the spirit
[1:33:58] brothers and
[1:34:00] sisters he goes on to say I believe that
[1:34:02] the scripture teaches that gifts and
[1:34:03] callings are without repentance and
[1:34:08] isn't that true you can look at someone
[1:34:10] like Elvis Presley he speaks about Elvis
[1:34:11] Presley he says he sold his soul for a
[1:34:13] fleet of
[1:34:15] Cadillacs he had the gift there that
[1:34:17] gift was from birth before the
[1:34:19] foundation of the world and he could
[1:34:20] have chosen to use it for God for the
[1:34:22] glory of God or give it over to the
[1:34:24] devil and unfortunately that's what he
[1:34:26] chose to do he gave it over to the devil
[1:34:28] and I Marvel brothers and sisters at how
[1:34:29] many gifts we have in the body here how
[1:34:32] many gifts in the body of Believers
[1:34:35] worldwide that could easily just walk
[1:34:38] right into a record label and get signed
[1:34:42] right now without having any training or
[1:34:44] anything else just exactly as they are
[1:34:46] but they're not using it for the devil
[1:34:49] they're using it for the the kingdom of
[1:34:51] the Lord what an amazing thing it is
[1:34:54] amen I have no doubt there's Believers
[1:34:56] in even in this congregation that have
[1:34:58] that quality of music that quality of
[1:35:01] singing it it's the way it is and you
[1:35:04] know we all have gifts every one of us
[1:35:08] just because you have a musical gift it
[1:35:10] doesn't make it more important than
[1:35:12] someone who has the gift of wisdom and
[1:35:15] someone who has the gift of Prophecy
[1:35:17] someone who has the gift of healing
[1:35:19] someone who has the gift of tongues or
[1:35:21] interpretation
[1:35:24] there's those those gifts are in the
[1:35:26] body for a purpose he says I believe
[1:35:29] that that scripture teaches that gifts
[1:35:31] and callings are without repentance that
[1:35:33] when we are born in this world we are
[1:35:35] sent here by one purpose that is of god
[1:35:39] and that therefore we are even become
[1:35:42] adults before we are even become adults
[1:35:47] while we are yet
[1:35:49] children the gifts that we have of God
[1:35:52] is in US
[1:35:54] then isn't that
[1:35:56] beautiful and only the filling of the
[1:35:59] Holy Spirit puts these gifts into
[1:36:04] operation because if we've been given a
[1:36:06] gift which we have every one of us has
[1:36:09] nobody has has has not been given a gift
[1:36:12] is just a void person that's just here
[1:36:14] floating around is an empty Spirit no no
[1:36:17] that's not the way God does it every
[1:36:18] single person has a gift everyone I
[1:36:22] think it's beautiful that that's the way
[1:36:24] he does it he goes on to say but we have
[1:36:26] them in the beginning the gifts such as
[1:36:29] teachers and apostles and Prophets and
[1:36:31] Gifts of tongues and the nine spiritual
[1:36:33] gifts according to 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:36:35] 12 they're already
[1:36:38] there it just behooves us to make sure
[1:36:40] that we've got the Holy Ghost so we can
[1:36:42] see those gifts operate properly so that
[1:36:44] we can see those gifts develop
[1:36:47] properly it's important for the children
[1:36:49] to learn how to play instruments in
[1:36:51] church if anybody has a gift I want to
[1:36:54] say it this way if anybody has a gift as
[1:36:56] a child they've been learning to play
[1:36:58] the piano for the last 10 years and it's
[1:37:01] just a secret nobody knows about it by
[1:37:03] all means let me know let a deacon know
[1:37:05] let somebody know we we want to see that
[1:37:08] happen in fact moving forward we are
[1:37:10] we've talked about it as deacons we're
[1:37:12] going to have some musical Gatherings
[1:37:15] with the children and opportunities for
[1:37:17] them to bring their gifts and have
[1:37:20] church because you know brothers and
[1:37:22] sisters the Lord could decide to T for a
[1:37:25] few more years we don't know that some
[1:37:28] people want to say sure enough he is
[1:37:30] nobody's given me their Cadillac keys
[1:37:32] yet but if you have any I'd be happy to
[1:37:34] take
[1:37:35] them I'm just joking because I don't
[1:37:38] want to be here to drive it if the
[1:37:40] Church of the Living God goes home it's
[1:37:41] a joke about brother Bram he said you
[1:37:43] know someone offered their Cadillac Keys
[1:37:45] you know maybe that was import taste
[1:37:48] forgive me but brothers and sisters we
[1:37:51] have the ability to actually train them
[1:37:55] up in the way they should go and it's
[1:37:56] not just to get them saved we need to
[1:37:59] remember that if the Lord should T we
[1:38:01] could pass away who's going to be
[1:38:04] looking after the church who's going to
[1:38:05] be playing the piano who's going to be
[1:38:07] playing the guitars who's going to be
[1:38:08] playing the organ who's going to be
[1:38:09] doing the sound who's going to be
[1:38:11] leading songs who's going to be
[1:38:13] ministering if the Lord should T it's a
[1:38:17] very real thing and it would be very
[1:38:19] foolish of us to think that we should
[1:38:20] just not worry about it because God's
[1:38:22] just going to raise them up or it's like
[1:38:24] saying we're just not going to worry
[1:38:25] about it God's going to raise our
[1:38:26] children up we don't have to do that no
[1:38:27] no no we're the stewards of our children
[1:38:29] it it behooves us to make sure that
[1:38:31] we're teaching them properly amen amen
[1:38:34] just like in the house of the Lord the
[1:38:36] children are the next generation of
[1:38:39] Believers that's why Church order is so
[1:38:41] important to know how to do it so
[1:38:44] anyways if there's anybody with a gift
[1:38:46] that you would like to express as a
[1:38:47] child don't be bashful come and see
[1:38:50] me let me
[1:38:52] know will certainly make room for
[1:38:55] you says I believe that the scripture
[1:38:57] teaches that gifts and callings are
[1:38:59] without repentance and that when we are
[1:39:00] born in this world we are sent here with
[1:39:02] one purpose that is of god and that
[1:39:06] before we are even become adults while
[1:39:09] we are yet children the gifts that we
[1:39:12] have of God is in us then so those gifts
[1:39:16] are right here right now Brothers and
[1:39:17] Sisters Let's develop them and only the
[1:39:20] filling of the Holy Spirit puts these
[1:39:22] gifts into oper ation that's why anybody
[1:39:26] that plays up here needs to have the
[1:39:28] Holy Ghost in their life we need to know
[1:39:30] that the people who are actually playing
[1:39:32] as a gift or leading songs as a gift or
[1:39:36] preaching as a gift has the Holy Ghost
[1:39:38] in their
[1:39:39] life he goes on to say but we have them
[1:39:42] in the beginning such as teachers
[1:39:44] Apostles and Prophets and Gifts of
[1:39:46] tongues the nine spiritual gifts
[1:39:48] according to 1 Corinthians CH 12 now we
[1:39:50] believe that these gifts are in
[1:39:52] operation today and they should be in
[1:39:57] every local
[1:40:00] church so what gifts if you wonder this
[1:40:03] go back and study 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:40:06] 12 my we should be seeing according to
[1:40:10] what the prophet says here the word of
[1:40:12] wisdom the word of
[1:40:14] knowledge Faith Gifts of healing working
[1:40:18] of
[1:40:19] Miracles if you wonder if the Miracles
[1:40:21] are happening brothers and sisters come
[1:40:23] to a prayer meeting in
[1:40:25] here the testimonies are coming forward
[1:40:27] amen out of these prayer meetings amen
[1:40:30] it's amazing if you've got a need don't
[1:40:32] miss a prayer meeting they're powerful
[1:40:35] to another
[1:40:36] prophecy Discerning of gifts diverse
[1:40:39] kinds of tongues and interpretation of
[1:40:41] tongues all of those things are what
[1:40:43] he's saying here now we believe that
[1:40:45] these gifts are in operation today and
[1:40:48] they should be in every local
[1:40:52] church it's not something for us to be
[1:40:54] afraid of brothers and sisters if
[1:40:56] someone would speak out in tongues and
[1:40:57] someone would interpret there is an
[1:40:59] exact order for it to happen and as we
[1:41:01] advance in our study with this church
[1:41:03] order we'll definitely drill down in the
[1:41:06] operation of speaking in tongues there's
[1:41:08] a very specific order for it it it's not
[1:41:11] as we spoke on Wednesday is it called
[1:41:14] Galia it's not just talking to you and
[1:41:16] then all of a sudden I would just bust
[1:41:18] out in speaking in tongue some other
[1:41:19] language something something say
[1:41:21] confusion is what Paul said unless
[1:41:23] there's an interpretation there has to
[1:41:26] be an a proper order according to the
[1:41:28] word I'm so thankful that there is a
[1:41:30] proper order according to the word and
[1:41:33] and a prophet that would come and set
[1:41:36] the church in order take it back to
[1:41:38] where it's supposed to be all of these
[1:41:40] gifts should be in operation in every
[1:41:43] local
[1:41:44] church although in such we have found
[1:41:48] throughout the
[1:41:49] world that there's much fanaticism
[1:41:54] hooked along with people who profess to
[1:41:59] be Apostolic Believers now brothers and
[1:42:02] sisters I'm going to just take us and
[1:42:04] step aside from there a little bit and
[1:42:06] I'm not going to try and add to or take
[1:42:08] away from don't get me wrong I just want
[1:42:09] to change our
[1:42:11] perspective just want to change our
[1:42:12] perspective a little bit and and say
[1:42:15] that we have seen much fanaticism hooked
[1:42:17] along with the people who profess to be
[1:42:20] message
[1:42:22] believers now this is where I said at
[1:42:24] the very beginning I hope you can bear
[1:42:25] with me I'm going to really drill down
[1:42:27] on this and I'm going to be very clear
[1:42:29] it's going to take the operation of the
[1:42:30] Holy Ghost In Our Lives to know exactly
[1:42:32] what's right and exactly what's wrong
[1:42:35] it's not going to be something that
[1:42:36] somebody can do for us because the word
[1:42:39] of God says it's going to be so close
[1:42:40] that it would deceive the very elected
[1:42:42] if it were possible so this fanaticism
[1:42:44] brothers and sisters and and I know I'm
[1:42:46] preaching to the choir if you've been in
[1:42:47] the message for any amount of time
[1:42:49] you've seen fanaticism around the
[1:42:50] message and what happens is it causes a
[1:42:52] train wreck and people's
[1:42:54] lives we're just going to call it
[1:42:56] straight what it is is it's a devil
[1:42:58] because it's either good or it's
[1:43:01] evil so anyways we have have the prophet
[1:43:04] here saying although we have we have
[1:43:06] found throughout the world that there is
[1:43:08] much fanaticism hooked along with the
[1:43:10] people who profess to be Apostolic
[1:43:13] Believers or message believers they
[1:43:16] profess it brothers and sisters there's
[1:43:18] a difference between professing
[1:43:19] something and actually living
[1:43:22] something the professor is the one that
[1:43:25] just continually professes it but the
[1:43:27] one who's living it is the one that's
[1:43:29] doing it they're the ones that are
[1:43:31] actually got their shoulder to the wheel
[1:43:33] and doing it just as they are in other
[1:43:37] orders and so forth we have
[1:43:40] Fanatics I I want to be a fanatic myself
[1:43:43] if you listen to the message the Oddball
[1:43:45] brother bam talks about that guy wearing
[1:43:47] the sign right he's wearing the sandwich
[1:43:50] board and he's walking up and down the
[1:43:51] Boulevard and one side of it says I I'm
[1:43:54] a fool for Christ I'm a fool for Christ
[1:43:57] and people look at it and Scorn them
[1:43:59] maybe and the other side of the sandwich
[1:44:01] board says who fool are you cuz we're
[1:44:03] going to be a fool for someone in this
[1:44:05] world we're going to serve a dumb Idol
[1:44:07] or we're going to serve the Living God
[1:44:10] and it's just that simple it's life or
[1:44:12] it's death there's no middle ground no
[1:44:15] inet and that's just the way it is
[1:44:17] unfortunately but that's exactly the
[1:44:19] word that we believe I think it's so
[1:44:21] beautiful so there's much fanaticism
[1:44:23] hooked along with the people who profess
[1:44:24] to be a Apostolic Believers and the
[1:44:27] apostolic believer what is that brothers
[1:44:29] and sisters I'm going to go back into my
[1:44:30] notes and really start preaching what my
[1:44:32] notes are I haven't even gotten into my
[1:44:33] notes today but we're just sort of
[1:44:35] skipping across the pond as I say many
[1:44:37] times just sort of hitting the
[1:44:38] highlights and we're going to take our
[1:44:40] time with this if we've got to come back
[1:44:41] we will but what is an Apostolic
[1:44:44] believer one who has all these signs
[1:44:46] believing that all these signs are in
[1:44:48] operation in the church that's an
[1:44:49] Apostolic believer they won't get upset
[1:44:50] because they see speaking in tongues and
[1:44:52] interpretation they believe in wisdom
[1:44:53] they believe in healing they believe in
[1:44:55] miracles they believe in knowledge they
[1:44:57] believe in the nine spiritual gifts
[1:44:59] that's an Apostolic
[1:45:01] believer just as they are in other
[1:45:03] orders and so forth we have Fanatics
[1:45:05] that's been all along we've had had
[1:45:08] these Through the Ages they had it in
[1:45:11] the apostolic day and as Paul said there
[1:45:15] that how some had come and persuaded
[1:45:18] them away after other
[1:45:21] doctrines and so forth I want to say
[1:45:25] this brothers and sisters it's possible
[1:45:26] to have other doctrines that can
[1:45:28] actually persuade people away from the
[1:45:30] truth and it's not that somebody would
[1:45:32] come and preach any other gospel it's
[1:45:34] that they would preach the gospel and
[1:45:36] live another one when that's happening
[1:45:39] that's exactly what Paul is talking
[1:45:41] about here exactly what the prophet's
[1:45:44] talking about here we can persuade
[1:45:46] people away from the truth by preaching
[1:45:48] something and living something else he
[1:45:51] says but in his own teaching he said if
[1:45:55] an angel from heaven would teach
[1:45:56] anything
[1:45:58] else than what he had taught let him be
[1:46:02] a cursed so remember brother Bram said
[1:46:05] it I believe the Holy Ghost through
[1:46:07] brother Bram the Vindicated Prophet the
[1:46:09] church age messenger the seventh angel
[1:46:12] messenger the Holy Ghost said that our
[1:46:15] lives that we live preach the loudest
[1:46:18] sermon that would ever be preached we
[1:46:21] can say all we want but but our lives
[1:46:23] speak
[1:46:25] volumes and you know it's interesting
[1:46:27] because he even said this too that our
[1:46:28] thoughts are louder in heaven than our
[1:46:30] voices here on
[1:46:32] Earth but in his own teaching he said if
[1:46:35] an angel from heaven would teach
[1:46:36] anything else then what he had taught
[1:46:39] let him be cursed Paul was setting the
[1:46:41] church in
[1:46:42] order he says so we as the Bram
[1:46:46] Tabernacle at 8 and Penn Street here
[1:46:48] he's talking to his church there but I
[1:46:50] think we could say the same here we here
[1:46:52] at Calgary Living Word try to follow the
[1:46:54] teachings of the New Testament for we
[1:46:57] believe that Jesus Christ being the Son
[1:46:58] of God and Paul the Apostle was called
[1:47:01] and chosen vessel by election of God to
[1:47:04] be sent to the Gentile Church to set it
[1:47:07] in order and we know we had seven Church
[1:47:10] age Messengers we've gone through it
[1:47:12] there's the exposition of the seven
[1:47:13] Church Ages which is the study of the
[1:47:15] church ages as laid out in the Book of
[1:47:18] Revelations chapter 2 and Chapter 3 The
[1:47:21] the church ages are laid out there and
[1:47:23] and brother bradam he he wrote the book
[1:47:25] about it we know we've been studying it
[1:47:26] on Wednesday nights but you know there
[1:47:28] was a church age messenger at the
[1:47:30] beginning to set the church in order and
[1:47:31] there was a church AG messenger at the
[1:47:33] ending to put the church in order isn't
[1:47:35] it wonderful Hallelujah the Capstone
[1:47:38] Ministry of the church to actually set
[1:47:40] it right in order and we know that it
[1:47:42] was just exactly the same as John the
[1:47:44] Baptist it was to set the church in
[1:47:46] order because there was one coming he
[1:47:49] was the one voice crying in the
[1:47:51] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:47:53] Lord that's what John the Baptist was
[1:47:54] set for and to be able to baptize Jesus
[1:47:56] to introduce Jesus to the world we know
[1:47:59] that that's why he came a and so he did
[1:48:02] but there was another John the Baptist
[1:48:04] with an Elijah anointing I'm going off
[1:48:06] on a tangent here but that Elijah
[1:48:08] anointing happened with brother Bram and
[1:48:10] what did he do he set the church in
[1:48:11] order to and he said Behold the Lamb of
[1:48:13] God I have come to make a way for the
[1:48:17] Lord and he didn't even say that we know
[1:48:18] that a star came down ball of fire and
[1:48:20] said you know as John the Baptist was
[1:48:22] sent to forth on the first coming of the
[1:48:23] Lord Jesus Christ so your
[1:48:26] ministry has been sent to forerun the
[1:48:30] second coming of the Lord amen and now
[1:48:33] now God's chosen to take him off the
[1:48:35] scene and we know that he said the two
[1:48:37] of us won't be standing here if what I
[1:48:38] think is going on is happening the two
[1:48:40] of us won't be standing here because
[1:48:42] isn't it interesting that God doesn't
[1:48:43] just explain it all to us right he
[1:48:46] doesn't give us all the answers he gives
[1:48:48] us his word and we have to try and
[1:48:50] stumble our way along just by his word
[1:48:53] amen but it's beautiful because we don't
[1:48:55] have to stumble if we're willing to just
[1:48:56] go all the way and call him Lord and let
[1:48:58] the Holy Ghost rule over our lives if
[1:49:01] we're willing to do that then we're able
[1:49:02] to actually see the full manifestation
[1:49:05] of the word in our lives and we don't
[1:49:07] have to hiccup along we don't have to
[1:49:08] stumble around we're not groping in
[1:49:10] darkness I think it's just beautiful he
[1:49:13] he he he was to be sent to set the
[1:49:16] Gentile Church in order carrying on here
[1:49:18] he says now we believe in water baptism
[1:49:21] another big one so all of these we're
[1:49:23] going to actually drill down into and
[1:49:25] preach on I hope it's okay it's it's
[1:49:28] maybe just a little bit but I'm probably
[1:49:30] not going to try and hold us on a
[1:49:32] three-hour service today which I think I
[1:49:33] could I feel inspired enough to do it
[1:49:36] but we'll uh we'll just see how the Lord
[1:49:37] leads now we believe in water baptism in
[1:49:40] the Bram Tabernacle by immersing in the
[1:49:43] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen which
[1:49:47] is the apostolic teaching of the Bible
[1:49:51] and I just love how simp brother brownon
[1:49:53] made it when he brought this Doctrine to
[1:49:55] the denominational world he said show me
[1:49:58] anywhere in the Bible where they
[1:49:59] actually baptize people in the name of
[1:50:02] the father and in the name of the son
[1:50:04] and in the name of the Holy Ghost we can
[1:50:06] show you where he baptized in the where
[1:50:08] they baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:50:10] Jesus Christ but it was never once done
[1:50:13] recorded in the Bible in the name of the
[1:50:15] father Son and Holy Ghost even though
[1:50:18] Jesus told his disciples to do that but
[1:50:20] why did he tell his disciples to do that
[1:50:22] because they knew Jesus they knew his
[1:50:26] name they knew his voice they knew who
[1:50:29] he was they didn't have to be told that
[1:50:31] he's some father Jesus wasn't a father
[1:50:35] and we know there's deceiving spirits
[1:50:36] that have gone out in the world that say
[1:50:37] that he was and that he was married and
[1:50:39] that he wanted to be and you know it's
[1:50:42] all doctrines of devils he wasn't a
[1:50:45] father he was the son he was the
[1:50:48] manifestation of God in flesh the way
[1:50:51] that God chose
[1:50:53] to condescend from his absolute Glory
[1:50:56] down to a way that human beings could
[1:50:59] potentially begin to conceive a man
[1:51:02] called Jesus who is God manifest In the
[1:51:06] Flesh before his time who could speak to
[1:51:09] a
[1:51:10] storm right before his time who could
[1:51:13] make bread from bread who could make
[1:51:16] fish from Fish before his time who could
[1:51:19] go in and raise gyrus his daughter
[1:51:23] before his time who could actually say
[1:51:26] wow I haven't seen Faith such as this in
[1:51:28] all Israel just go home your servant is
[1:51:33] well before his time who could go and
[1:51:36] walk to the just ignore the people
[1:51:38] calling him saying you know what Lazarus
[1:51:40] is dead you got to come our brother our
[1:51:42] buddy come come come we know you can
[1:51:44] help him but he said you know I I'm a
[1:51:47] little tired I got to just take some
[1:51:49] time and and relax
[1:51:51] here I wonder I can't imagine that would
[1:51:54] have been an easy thing for Jesus to do
[1:51:56] I mean sure some would say well he was
[1:51:58] God but he was all man too
[1:51:59] remember when the people were calling
[1:52:01] him and he knew that he had the ability
[1:52:03] to speak to the storm to to raise people
[1:52:06] from the dead when they were saying his
[1:52:07] best friend Lazarus was dead oh
[1:52:12] my Mary and Martha were upset you know
[1:52:14] if you would have been here came four
[1:52:17] days too late why would you do that
[1:52:19] totally disappointed us and what did he
[1:52:21] say this happened so that I could show
[1:52:23] you who I
[1:52:25] am people would say you know what he he
[1:52:27] was just a man he was just man because
[1:52:29] he had emotion he
[1:52:31] cried but that wasn't a man that put his
[1:52:33] shoulders back according to the prophet
[1:52:35] and spoke Lazarus come
[1:52:39] forth that was all God brothers and
[1:52:42] sisters and he came for that purpose to
[1:52:45] demonstrate who he was I I think it's
[1:52:47] just magnificent when we catch the
[1:52:49] revelation of Jesus truly being God and
[1:52:52] there's no need to try and chop them
[1:52:53] into pieces and explain there's this
[1:52:55] personality and there's this personality
[1:52:57] and there's that personality and they
[1:52:59] all should behave in certain ways
[1:53:00] because they're separate persons and all
[1:53:03] that business it makes it confusing the
[1:53:05] devil's in the details he loves the
[1:53:06] details if we could just accept Jesus
[1:53:09] Christ as our Lord and savior who could
[1:53:12] be our Lord and savior but God yes
[1:53:16] sir we believe in water baptism in the
[1:53:18] Bram Tabernacle by immersing In The Name
[1:53:21] Of The Lord Jesus Christ which is the
[1:53:23] apostolic teaching of the Bible and many
[1:53:26] all members and or comers to the Bram
[1:53:29] Tabernacle who desire such May at any
[1:53:32] time requesting to be immersed in the
[1:53:35] name of the Lord Jesus May consult the
[1:53:38] pastor and if they have repented and
[1:53:42] Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:53:45] pastor will as soon as possible even
[1:53:49] then if he can baptize them
[1:53:53] immediately this does not bring them
[1:53:55] into the fellowship of Believers We
[1:53:59] Believe sorry this does bring them into
[1:54:02] the fellowship of Believers we believe
[1:54:05] that water baptism by water baptism we
[1:54:08] are brought into a fellowship and I
[1:54:11] would say the fellowship we are brought
[1:54:14] into the fellowship and we could you
[1:54:16] know say where he says at at Bram
[1:54:18] Tabernacle we could say Calgary Living
[1:54:20] Word right there if you desire to be
[1:54:21] baptized
[1:54:23] we we have a pool downstairs and we have
[1:54:25] stuff ready if you want to be baptized
[1:54:27] amen amen we've done it that way to make
[1:54:30] sure that we can we we like to say you
[1:54:32] know we'll uh fire up the pool and next
[1:54:35] week we can do it but if somebody just
[1:54:37] has the desire to get baptize we can do
[1:54:38] it on the spot no problem so just so you
[1:54:42] know I think it's so
[1:54:45] beautiful but by the baptism of the Holy
[1:54:48] Spirit we are brought into the members
[1:54:51] being members of the body of Jesus
[1:54:53] Christ which is all over the
[1:54:56] world now another thing that we believe
[1:54:59] that the manifestation of the spirit is
[1:55:01] given to every man to profit with all
[1:55:04] now we believe that when these gifts and
[1:55:07] so forth are operating in the
[1:55:10] church which we covet and
[1:55:12] desire that the people who are gifted by
[1:55:15] the Spirit come and worship with
[1:55:19] us I think it's beautiful he sets
[1:55:22] all of this in motion I'm going to stop
[1:55:25] reading the
[1:55:27] actual the actual uh
[1:55:31] message and now I'm going to open my
[1:55:34] notes you know in what we believe
[1:55:36] brothers and sisters the pattern that
[1:55:39] was established it it was set according
[1:55:41] to the Apostle
[1:55:43] Paul and it's beautiful because when we
[1:55:45] read that scripture that said you know
[1:55:48] if we or an angel from heaven come and
[1:55:51] preach any other thing than what we've
[1:55:54] already
[1:55:55] preached I think it's so important for
[1:55:58] us to catch that part what's already
[1:56:00] been said is what needs to be said if
[1:56:02] we're bringing a new doctrine into the
[1:56:04] church we're actually into something
[1:56:06] wrong because no angel messenger no
[1:56:11] Prophet no speaking in tongues no Pastor
[1:56:14] no evangelist nobody is going to preach
[1:56:17] anything who is a True Believer of this
[1:56:19] word is going to preach anything
[1:56:21] contrary to the this word every single
[1:56:24] one of them if they are Spirit-filled
[1:56:25] calling him Lord Jesus Christ in their
[1:56:28] life they're going to preach what Paul
[1:56:30] preached am amen and it doesn't matter
[1:56:33] how many people do something
[1:56:36] differently I want to say this brothers
[1:56:38] and sisters I think it needs to be said
[1:56:40] very clearly we could have 20 different
[1:56:43] message churches doing something
[1:56:44] different than what this message says it
[1:56:47] makes it wrong if it's doing it
[1:56:49] different than what this message says if
[1:56:51] it's doing different than what the word
[1:56:52] says it doesn't matter how many churches
[1:56:55] around the world whatever their
[1:56:56] denomination is if they're doing it just
[1:56:59] because many people do it don't make it
[1:57:00] right it's got to be according to the
[1:57:03] word and I I'll say this you know one
[1:57:05] really big one that's very popular these
[1:57:07] days not in the message for the record
[1:57:09] but what's very popular is a woman
[1:57:11] preacher the word says not to do it
[1:57:14] because what she's doing is usurping
[1:57:17] Spiritual
[1:57:18] Authority the word says not to do it so
[1:57:21] where did it change where did it become
[1:57:25] okay the only way that happened was
[1:57:28] because one person somewhere along the
[1:57:29] way said it's okay we can do it and then
[1:57:32] somebody else said well they're doing it
[1:57:34] so we must be able to do it it's it's it
[1:57:36] should be fine I mean we see
[1:57:38] manifestation of the spirit right we see
[1:57:40] gifts and tongues remember the devil can
[1:57:43] impersonate any one of the gifts any one
[1:57:46] of these gifts that we just mentioned
[1:57:47] the devil can impersonate this is where
[1:57:49] it becomes so close it would deceive the
[1:57:50] very elected if it were possible the
[1:57:52] only way we're going to be able to know
[1:57:53] the difference is to have the Holy Ghost
[1:57:54] in our life the only way we're going to
[1:57:56] know the difference is to make sure that
[1:57:58] when those gifts are operating they're
[1:57:59] operating according to the word in
[1:58:01] proper Church order amen and that's why
[1:58:03] I think it's so important for us to make
[1:58:05] sure that we're just taking our time
[1:58:07] we're not russing we're making sure that
[1:58:09] we're just taking our time to explain
[1:58:11] this and what I want to do is ex is is
[1:58:14] just mention this too brothers and
[1:58:15] sisters I think it's very important if
[1:58:17] we have questions about this please
[1:58:19] write them down contact us let's talk
[1:58:22] about it I'll take the question and and
[1:58:23] preach a sermon on the question I I
[1:58:26] think it's important for us it could be
[1:58:28] children it could be adults it can be
[1:58:30] anybody if you hear my voice and you got
[1:58:31] a question send the question and let's
[1:58:34] let's talk about this it's so important
[1:58:35] for us to make sure we know where we
[1:58:38] stand but Paul he said to the church he
[1:58:41] only said what was already said he
[1:58:43] didn't bring a new doctrine he was just
[1:58:44] trying to set the church in order out of
[1:58:46] Galatians
[1:58:48] 1:8 it says but though we are an angel
[1:58:51] from heaven
[1:58:53] my angel from heaven could you imagine
[1:58:56] that preach any other gospel unto you
[1:58:59] than what we have preached unto you then
[1:59:02] what you've already heard let him be a
[1:59:03] curse verse n says and as we said before
[1:59:07] so say I now again if you didn't get it
[1:59:09] the first time catch it now if any man
[1:59:12] preach any other gospel unto you than
[1:59:14] that ye have received let him be a
[1:59:20] cursed that's why I think it's so
[1:59:21] beautiful beautiful let's take a look at
[1:59:23] what brother branam actually said and
[1:59:25] you know what's amazing I love it this
[1:59:27] is the way the Lord does stuff I'm only
[1:59:30] just starting to get into the notes that
[1:59:32] I had planned for today I I wanted to
[1:59:35] get into the the message that we were
[1:59:36] talking about but if we could just part
[1:59:39] on one thing there's like we're almost
[1:59:41] at noon and I don't want to hold us
[1:59:43] because I know we've got commitments
[1:59:46] today and I don't want to rush this
[1:59:48] either the exposition of the seven
[1:59:50] Church ages out of the resume of the
[1:59:52] ages what what did Brother Bram say this
[1:59:55] man who we listen to who we call the
[1:59:58] seventh angel messenger who who who was
[2:00:01] the manifestation of the scripture
[2:00:03] Revelations 10:7 Malachi 45 and 6 behold
[2:00:06] I send you Elijah before the coming of
[2:00:08] the great and terrible day of the Lord
[2:00:11] what did he actually say if you type in
[2:00:13] Google William Mariam Bram you're going
[2:00:15] to get all of the Google stuff and we
[2:00:18] know for sure that you can't trust
[2:00:19] Google we got into this discussion we
[2:00:21] were hunting it's so good who who in the
[2:00:23] right mind would say I've got this
[2:00:25] problem in my life and I'm only only
[2:00:30] going to go to Google and self- diagnose
[2:00:33] my problem with my health by someone who
[2:00:36] has posted something on on some website
[2:00:40] to say that if you have this then you
[2:00:41] should do that who's going to trust that
[2:00:44] with their life we're all going to go to
[2:00:47] the
[2:00:48] doctor we're going to go and Trust our
[2:00:50] health with the doctor why would we
[2:00:52] trust our spiritual well-being with
[2:00:56] Google right it doesn't make any sense
[2:00:59] our Eternal
[2:01:01] rest we're going to base it on Google on
[2:01:04] a Google
[2:01:05] search
[2:01:07] seriously what about Revelation by the
[2:01:12] spirit what did this guy say though many
[2:01:14] times people will say we just follow a
[2:01:16] guy what did he say let's listen to it
[2:01:18] if we just followed the guy let's just
[2:01:20] take it naturally and say well if we're
[2:01:21] just following a guy what did he say to
[2:01:24] do he says not for one moment do I bring
[2:01:26] a message to the people that they can
[2:01:29] that they may follow me or join my
[2:01:31] church or start some fellowship and
[2:01:35] organization yes I have never done that
[2:01:38] and will not do that now I have no
[2:01:41] interest in those things but I do have
[2:01:42] an interest in the things of God and
[2:01:45] people and if I can accomplish just one
[2:01:48] thing I will be satisfied this is what
[2:01:51] he said
[2:01:52] right that one thing is to see
[2:01:54] established a true spiritual
[2:01:56] relationship between God and man wherein
[2:02:00] men become New Creations in Christ
[2:02:02] filled with his spirit and live
[2:02:04] according to his word I would invite
[2:02:07] plead and warn all to hear his voice at
[2:02:10] this time and yield your lives
[2:02:12] completely to
[2:02:14] him but we know that we live in the
[2:02:16] midst of a leoan church age where I am
[2:02:19] rich I'm increased with goods and I have
[2:02:22] need of nothing many times we've got
[2:02:24] degrees under our belt on our walls we
[2:02:27] have earned the right to have what we
[2:02:29] have I've worked really hard many years
[2:02:32] to be able to earn what I earn I've got
[2:02:34] a tremendous portfolio I'm rich I'm
[2:02:36] increased with goods and I don't need
[2:02:38] nothing there's nothing you could tell
[2:02:40] me there's nothing you could give me
[2:02:42] sure enough that's the age in which we
[2:02:44] live in others they've done nothing
[2:02:47] they're bums their whole life but their
[2:02:49] parents worked hard and their parents
[2:02:51] passed away and transfer all the wealth
[2:02:53] to them now they're loaded they're rich
[2:02:56] and increased with goods and have need
[2:02:58] of
[2:02:59] nothing but we have the Lord saying I
[2:03:02] challenge you to just buy of me gold
[2:03:05] that's DED in the fire a real character
[2:03:09] one that actually went to the cross that
[2:03:11] took all of the reproach that we got
[2:03:13] from the scripture that we read this
[2:03:15] morning and took it and bore it for your
[2:03:19] shame if we would just do that
[2:03:22] that's the age in which we live in
[2:03:23] brothers and sisters that's the spirit
[2:03:25] that's combating us you know the brother
[2:03:27] Prophet said that it's important for us
[2:03:28] to recognize the tactics of our enemy
[2:03:30] that's right that's a major tactic that
[2:03:33] he uses is to get us get us so that
[2:03:36] we've got it going on right we've got
[2:03:38] the portfolio everything's good in our
[2:03:40] life man what do we need we need Christ
[2:03:44] we need Christ more now than we've ever
[2:03:46] needed him oh
[2:03:48] my I think it's so beautiful so those
[2:03:50] are the words that he said
[2:03:52] those are the words that he said and I'm
[2:03:54] going to part on these words because I
[2:03:55] think it's real good we'll pick up from
[2:03:57] here next time and uh and really carry
[2:03:59] on with this because I think it's that
[2:04:01] important and I'm going to cause some
[2:04:02] questions here I know it there's going
[2:04:04] to be a stirring we believe in the Lord
[2:04:06] Jesus Christ here brothers and sisters
[2:04:08] we don't have to be afraid don't get
[2:04:09] nervous when I talk like I'm going to
[2:04:12] I'm going to mention what is a
[2:04:15] cult I know it gets to be a bit much
[2:04:18] when we're talking this way but I think
[2:04:19] it's important children
[2:04:22] remember there's three types of
[2:04:23] Believers in every Church we're not
[2:04:25] we're not ignorant as we read in the
[2:04:27] scripture he would not have that we're
[2:04:28] ignorant brother Bram told us there's
[2:04:30] three types of Believers in the church
[2:04:32] it's important to remember that there's
[2:04:34] there's the Believers the make Believers
[2:04:35] and the unbelievers who they are that's
[2:04:37] up to God brothers and sisters it's not
[2:04:38] up to us don't look at any human being
[2:04:41] and say they're that or they're that as
[2:04:43] soon as you start doing that I want to
[2:04:45] say you're
[2:04:47] that I was judging people as Christians
[2:04:50] to be weak but when brother Aaron mcir
[2:04:53] witnessed to me he said by the way
[2:04:54] you're calling people Hypocrites is
[2:04:56] causing you yourself to be one because
[2:04:59] there cannot be a real or a false
[2:05:02] without their first being a real there
[2:05:04] has to be someone who is genuine and
[2:05:06] even though there's a lot of people who
[2:05:08] are make Believers and and unbelievers
[2:05:11] and impersonators There's real
[2:05:13] Believers and I I was like wow I don't
[2:05:16] want to be a hypocrite I don't want to
[2:05:17] be judging people like that it was
[2:05:18] enough to get my attention to say well
[2:05:20] there's got to be a genuine I might as
[2:05:22] well stop and take a look at it and I
[2:05:25] can say for me that was my burning bush
[2:05:26] I was like man that bush ain't being
[2:05:28] consumed I got to go check this out but
[2:05:30] when I went in the first thing I saw was
[2:05:32] a picture of a man with a halo over his
[2:05:34] head and I was like there it is it's a
[2:05:37] cult that was my original human reaction
[2:05:41] but remember brothers and sisters it was
[2:05:42] that service July 27th 2005 that I heard
[2:05:46] my pastor preach and I got saved like
[2:05:49] I've never been saved before I never
[2:05:51] thought I would would ever be able to be
[2:05:52] saved but in that service the words that
[2:05:54] were spoken were the words that needed
[2:05:56] to be said to unlock the spirit in my
[2:05:59] life amen amen so we can have all the
[2:06:03] opinions we want when it's the time
[2:06:05] appointed of the father there ain't
[2:06:06] nothing going to stop him from
[2:06:08] moving just apply the token to your
[2:06:11] homes brothers and sisters put the token
[2:06:13] on your children put the token on your
[2:06:14] marriage put the token on your church
[2:06:16] put the token on your job apply the
[2:06:18] token the way we're supposed to the def
[2:06:21] of a cult if you just type it into
[2:06:23] Google which is what I did I'm going to
[2:06:24] be
[2:06:25] honest definition of a cult so this
[2:06:27] could be wrong but I don't think it is I
[2:06:30] think it's going to be popular opinion
[2:06:32] is going to be based around this right
[2:06:33] cult cult definition is a cult is a is a
[2:06:36] small group of people who have extreme
[2:06:38] beliefs and practices that are
[2:06:40] considered strange or Dangerous by
[2:06:42] others and you know it's interesting
[2:06:44] because if we look at what Paul preached
[2:06:45] in the world in which we live it looks
[2:06:47] strange and maybe even dangerous to some
[2:06:49] doesn't it
[2:06:52] oh my and you know there's some people
[2:06:54] even in churches that want to just
[2:06:55] gather together there's some people that
[2:06:57] are are insistent that we just drink
[2:06:59] communion out of one
[2:07:00] cup now it's getting down to the Brass
[2:07:03] tax because here we're actually using
[2:07:05] separate cups all because of Co right
[2:07:08] but I'm one that never wants to live on
[2:07:10] the dangerous side now I'm not saying
[2:07:12] that the spirit of God isn't able to
[2:07:13] sanctify that
[2:07:16] cup I'm really stepping in it now aren't
[2:07:18] I but I think it's important brothers
[2:07:21] and sisters we need to know where we
[2:07:22] stand we need to know who we are I'm not
[2:07:24] interested as the leader maybe of this
[2:07:27] church to try and take us down a
[2:07:28] dangerous path and say you need to drink
[2:07:30] out of one cup and if you don't you're
[2:07:31] not a Believer that's getting
[2:07:35] culty listen to the characteristics
[2:07:37] Cults are often controlling and
[2:07:39] manipulative and can isolate members
[2:07:41] from the outside
[2:07:43] world my you ever heard of anybody in
[2:07:46] the message stopping people from seeing
[2:07:48] their
[2:07:49] families oh my if you don't follow me
[2:07:52] you're
[2:07:53] lost I've got the keys to the kingdom
[2:07:56] God's given me a greater Revelation than
[2:07:59] anyone on and on and on you can go right
[2:08:01] you ever heard that before how many
[2:08:04] people here feel like you're being
[2:08:05] controlled or
[2:08:08] manipulated how many people here are
[2:08:10] being told that you need to isolate from
[2:08:12] other members of your family or the
[2:08:14] outside
[2:08:15] world how are you ever going to be able
[2:08:17] to witness to people if you don't W go
[2:08:20] and live your life the world that we
[2:08:22] live in amen we have to work in this
[2:08:25] world we got to go to school in this
[2:08:26] world we have to have friends we have to
[2:08:30] have neighbors do we talk to our
[2:08:32] neighbors or are we just like oh there's
[2:08:34] a neighbor there I don't want them to
[2:08:35] see that I'm going to church now or
[2:08:37] whatever whatever whatever or even worse
[2:08:40] oh my look at that scuzzy person they
[2:08:42] don't believe what I believe my goodness
[2:08:45] are we ever good and what we do but
[2:08:47] those people over there they're always
[2:08:48] doing this or that or the other you know
[2:08:50] but for the grace of God there go go ey
[2:08:51] that's the word of God the the way that
[2:08:54] we're we're we're created we would be
[2:08:57] right there with them if we didn't have
[2:08:59] ears to hear what this spirit says but
[2:09:00] Cults are often controlling manipulative
[2:09:03] and can isolate members from the outside
[2:09:05] world some of the
[2:09:07] characteristics the
[2:09:09] leader this really got me going this
[2:09:11] morning I think it's good Cults are
[2:09:13] usually led by charismatic figure who is
[2:09:16] worshiped by members I'm so thankful
[2:09:18] that I'm not that charismatic and I I'm
[2:09:21] sure that nobody's worshiping me and if
[2:09:23] you are
[2:09:25] repent I'm telling you I ain't nothing
[2:09:27] to worship I I will actually myself
[2:09:30] brothers and sisters now I'm not joking
[2:09:32] I'll lead you to hell if you try and
[2:09:34] worship me you need to worship Jesus
[2:09:37] Christ amen I need to worship Jesus
[2:09:40] Christ if anybody ever says you got to
[2:09:42] worship anything else you know they're a
[2:09:44] lying
[2:09:46] Spirit Cults are usually led by
[2:09:48] charismatic figure who is worshiped by
[2:09:50] members beliefs Cults have unusual or
[2:09:54] extreme religious spiritual or
[2:09:56] philosophical beliefs once again you
[2:09:59] take a look at the way the world is
[2:10:01] versus what Paul
[2:10:04] taught and it looks that way you could
[2:10:06] say whoa there's some unusual things
[2:10:08] some unusual behavior not a woman
[2:10:10] preacher wearing pants cutting hair it's
[2:10:13] it's all these different things that's a
[2:10:15] bit weird it's a bit hard on women isn't
[2:10:17] it and because of that it seems to be
[2:10:19] unusual and extreme and it's all
[2:10:20] religious and spiritual and
[2:10:23] philosophical it's the word of God
[2:10:26] that's what Paul preached that's it is
[2:10:28] and you know if you want to see it alls
[2:10:30] you have to do I believe is uh go back
[2:10:35] to uh 1 Corinthians chapter 11 where we
[2:10:38] read and that actually talks about the
[2:10:41] behavior of a woman in a church and how
[2:10:43] she should be and remember that feminine
[2:10:46] is an example of the
[2:10:48] church Jesus the Lord God Almighty is
[2:10:52] the masculine the church is the
[2:10:56] feminine the husband is the masculine
[2:10:59] the wife is the feminine that's the way
[2:11:02] it works anyways uh it goes on to say
[2:11:04] here in our our definition of a cult in
[2:11:07] in terms of characteristics isolation
[2:11:09] Cults can isolate members from their
[2:11:11] friends and families and what it does is
[2:11:14] it causes control coercion Cults can use
[2:11:18] brainwashing gaslighting and other Psych
[2:11:21] ological manipulation tactics to control
[2:11:23] members hostility Cults can be hostile
[2:11:27] to people who are not members and I say
[2:11:31] Lord help us have you ever seen someone
[2:11:34] in the message I'm just going to say it
[2:11:36] straight you ever seen someone in around
[2:11:37] the message who is hostile towards
[2:11:39] another message Church they don't see it
[2:11:41] the way that we see it they're Canon
[2:11:43] fodder serpent seed unwise virgin at
[2:11:48] best when you hear people talking like
[2:11:50] that you know what's going going on but
[2:11:52] it doesn't mean we need to actually come
[2:11:54] and have a fight with them either we can
[2:11:56] actually be wise as a serpent and
[2:11:58] harmless as a dove we can say Lord have
[2:12:00] mercy help that person they're obviously
[2:12:04] maybe not as mature as they could be
[2:12:06] because a Believer is going to say it
[2:12:08] that way they're not going to say Well
[2:12:09] they're not as mature as me my goodness
[2:12:11] I've got a message PhD I've got the holy
[2:12:13] ghost in my life I'm not like that you
[2:12:15] know as soon as we start doing that we
[2:12:18] are but Cults can be hostile to people
[2:12:21] people who are not members and that's
[2:12:23] not what we are there there's no no
[2:12:26] Creed but
[2:12:28] Christ there's no law but love amen and
[2:12:31] the only book that we have is the
[2:12:35] Bible even though we reference the
[2:12:37] message of the hour the message points
[2:12:39] to the
[2:12:40] Bible I just had one other thing that
[2:12:42] I'm going to bring out here because I
[2:12:44] want to talk about this more I'm going
[2:12:45] to I fully intend to and uh hopefully we
[2:12:48] can get some questions because remember
[2:12:50] we can preach all we want but what do
[2:12:52] our live show he says or it says here in
[2:12:55] this uh definition from Google the
[2:12:58] coercion Cults can use brainwashing
[2:13:01] gaslighting and other psychological
[2:13:04] manipulation tactics to control members
[2:13:07] sure enough Cults do that if you look
[2:13:09] around and you see some of the Cults I'm
[2:13:10] sure people have heard about different
[2:13:12] Cults I'm not going to get into naming
[2:13:13] them but you know we we can see the the
[2:13:17] brainwashing it happens I I would say
[2:13:19] that if this is a cult I'm I'm totally
[2:13:21] brainwashed into it because the garbage
[2:13:23] that was in my brain before it's not
[2:13:25] there
[2:13:25] now when Christ came into my life he
[2:13:28] washed my brain of all the stuff that I
[2:13:30] was interested in my heart's desire is
[2:13:33] no longer the same so I could say that
[2:13:35] I've been brainwashed but I know one
[2:13:37] thing is for sure I have not been
[2:13:40] gaslighted have you have you ever heard
[2:13:42] gaslighting I had to look it up I've
[2:13:44] heard it mentioned a lot and I thought I
[2:13:46] understood it at one point but I had to
[2:13:47] look it up and so I got another one of
[2:13:49] these Google uh definitions here I think
[2:13:52] it's important gaslighting is a type of
[2:13:54] psychological manipulation if there's
[2:13:57] any psychological manipulation I say
[2:13:59] Lord have mercy I'll call the musicians
[2:14:01] as I close I I want to continue this I'm
[2:14:04] not actually ending on this because I
[2:14:06] want to just stop here brothers and
[2:14:08] sisters this is only getting started
[2:14:10] gaslighting is a type of psychological
[2:14:12] manipulation where someone tries to
[2:14:14] convince another person that their
[2:14:16] reality is false I believe this is so
[2:14:19] important if we're message Believers and
[2:14:22] we're going to go and talk to people and
[2:14:23] try and win them to Christ we aren't
[2:14:25] going to win Nobody by saying you're
[2:14:28] wrong I'm right you're wrong if we do
[2:14:32] that brothers and sisters it is going to
[2:14:34] be a problem it's going to demonstrate
[2:14:36] that again we maybe aren't as mature as
[2:14:39] we can get to but gaslighting is a type
[2:14:41] of psychological manipulation where
[2:14:43] someone tries to convince another person
[2:14:45] that their reality is false it's a form
[2:14:47] of emotional abuse that can cause a
[2:14:49] victim to question their own own
[2:14:51] thoughts feelings and
[2:14:52] Sanity now I don't know if you've ever
[2:14:55] had someone Gaslight you I think
[2:14:57] sometimes people will do it and not even
[2:14:59] realize they're doing it right but when
[2:15:02] somebody says stuff to make you think
[2:15:04] they're right and you're wrong and you
[2:15:06] know that you're right you've actually
[2:15:08] got proof that you're right but they're
[2:15:09] saying that you're wrong you're getting
[2:15:11] gas
[2:15:12] lit but that doesn't mean that they're a
[2:15:15] bad person sometimes we think that we
[2:15:17] genuinely think that we're right and it
[2:15:19] causes confusion all we need to do is
[2:15:20] have a conversation about it brothers
[2:15:21] and sisters but as Believers gaslighting
[2:15:24] is something that we need to be aware of
[2:15:26] but this is all from that cult
[2:15:28] definition remember talking about a cult
[2:15:31] this is not what we believe this is not
[2:15:33] who we are there's nobody in here that
[2:15:35] is held by force nobody in here is held
[2:15:38] by control or
[2:15:39] manipulation if you want to go go if you
[2:15:43] don't want to attend here anymore
[2:15:44] there's so many other churches probably
[2:15:47] better ones but there's other people
[2:15:49] that might want to come they're welcome
[2:15:50] to to come there's no control get into
[2:15:54] Jesus Christ
[2:15:56] amen yes I think this is just amazing
[2:15:59] though when you look at this because it
[2:16:00] can totally be spiritually applied it's
[2:16:03] a form of emotional abuse that can cause
[2:16:05] a victim to question their own thoughts
[2:16:07] feelings and Sanity I'll say it's the
[2:16:09] devil brothers and sisters maybe stand
[2:16:12] with me as we
[2:16:14] close says here how it works the abuser
[2:16:18] uses a series of actions to confuse the
[2:16:20] victim and make them doubt their own
[2:16:24] reality the abuser may deny the victim's
[2:16:27] memory or perception of an event the
[2:16:30] abuser May blame the victim for things
[2:16:33] that aren't their fault the abuser may
[2:16:36] try to shift the focus away from their
[2:16:39] abusive
[2:16:41] Behavior now remember all of this came
[2:16:45] out from the definition of a cult but
[2:16:48] remember what we said what what did this
[2:16:50] seventh angel Messengers say he he never
[2:16:52] came to actually get people to follow
[2:16:54] him he did not come to set up an
[2:16:56] organization he wasn't looking to set up
[2:16:58] a a franchisable organization where
[2:17:01] everyone would pay homage to them
[2:17:02] financially he didn't come to do that he
[2:17:04] wanted to see one thing established and
[2:17:06] that was a true spiritual relationship
[2:17:09] between God and Men again that's his
[2:17:12] purpose that's why he came that's why we
[2:17:14] listen to what he said cuz I know that I
[2:17:16] can say I'm one of them I'm so glad that
[2:17:19] he came around and did what he did
[2:17:20] fulfilled the role that God gave him for
[2:17:23] this life in which we
[2:17:25] live I think it's real important
[2:17:27] brothers and sisters some of these
[2:17:29] things I know that we know have been
[2:17:31] exercised in and around the message and
[2:17:34] whether they're preached or acted
[2:17:36] they're still there and it's very
[2:17:38] important to know exactly where we
[2:17:41] stand and hey if you see any of these
[2:17:43] things exhibited in brother Barry you
[2:17:45] got to come and tell me because I'm not
[2:17:48] interested in that the only thing I'm
[2:17:49] interested in is Christ and seeing
[2:17:51] people get filled with the baptism of
[2:17:53] the Holy Ghost because that is the only
[2:17:55] thing that's going to help us in the day
[2:17:56] in which we
[2:17:58] live that happens through church order
[2:18:00] through teaching brother brandham said
[2:18:03] it very clearly that preaching saves the
[2:18:06] person but teaching positionally places
[2:18:10] them in the land and that is I believe
[2:18:13] where we're at brothers and sisters
[2:18:15] we're in the promised land we just need
[2:18:17] to know our
[2:18:18] positions and as we go forwards as we
[2:18:21] know our positions we're going to see
[2:18:22] the manifestation of the Lord in our
[2:18:24] lives maybe in a way like we've never
[2:18:26] seen before amen if we can just humble
[2:18:29] ourselves to the word not to our own
[2:18:32] thoughts or Traditions maybe our own
[2:18:35] experiences we we we know that Paul I'll
[2:18:38] probably preach on this too Paul he had
[2:18:39] such a tremendous experience wasn't it
[2:18:41] he was knocked off his horse he was
[2:18:43] knocked off his high horse his high
[2:18:45] religious horse Paul was knocked to the
[2:18:47] ground he met the pillar of fire he
[2:18:49] caught the greatest revelation ever
[2:18:51] right but once he did he didn't base all
[2:18:55] of his life afterwards on that one
[2:18:58] experience what did he do he went and
[2:19:00] checked up with the word amen he went to
[2:19:03] see if it was actually in the word and
[2:19:05] once he realized that it set his soul on
[2:19:07] fire and I just trust brothers and
[2:19:09] sisters that through the the coming days
[2:19:11] and weeks that we could just check up
[2:19:13] our experiences with the word don't
[2:19:15] leave it as just a pillar of fire
[2:19:17] experience don't leave it as a man
[2:19:19] William Mary and bram's experience don't
[2:19:21] leave it to Mom's experience dad's
[2:19:23] experience the pastors of their deacons
[2:19:25] experience make it your own experience
[2:19:27] amen and check it up with the word let
[2:19:29] let's just bow in
[2:19:31] prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we
[2:19:34] love you and we thank you for your word
[2:19:36] thank you Father for establishing it
[2:19:38] properly on a firm foundation Lord for

[2:21:00] the musicians is a levitical order
