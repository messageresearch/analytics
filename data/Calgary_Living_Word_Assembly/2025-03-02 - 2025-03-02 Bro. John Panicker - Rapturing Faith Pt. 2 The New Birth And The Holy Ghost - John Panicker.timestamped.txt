[54:56] you please be with us in the name of our
[55:00] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we ask this
[55:02] prayer amen
[55:06] amen while we are standing let us open
[55:08] our
[55:10] Bibles to the same old scripture that we
[55:13] were taking last
[55:15] time that is Hebrews
[55:18] 11 verse 1 thank you musicians
[55:27] now Faith is the substance of things
[55:29] hoped for and the evidence of Things Not
[55:33] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[55:37] good
[55:38] report through faith we understand the
[55:41] worlds were
[55:42] framed by the word of God so that the
[55:45] things which are seen were not made of
[55:48] things which do
[55:52] appear by faith Abel offered unto God a
[55:56] more excellent sacrifice than
[55:58] Cain by which he obtained a witness that
[56:02] he was
[56:03] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[56:06] and by it being by by it he being dead
[56:11] yet
[56:12] speaketh now this is the important verse
[56:14] verse five by faith Enoch was translated
[56:18] that he should not see death and he was
[56:22] not found because God had translated him
[56:25] for before he his translation he had
[56:29] this testimony that he pleased
[56:32] God but without faith it is impossible
[56:37] to please him for he that cometh to God
[56:40] must first believe that he is and that
[56:43] he is a rewarder of them that diligently
[56:46] seek Him
[56:48] amen may the Lord add his Blessing to
[56:51] the reading of the word may please be
[56:53] seated
[57:01] Shalom it is nice to be in the house of
[57:03] the
[57:04] Lord and I was happy when they said let
[57:07] us go to the house of the
[57:09] Lord Brother Jeff I love
[57:11] you God bless you nice to see all of you
[57:15] here now before I start there is a small
[57:18] thing that I want to mention here or uh
[57:21] little bit of scripture I want to
[57:24] read and also I want to tell you that
[57:26] you know we were looking at rapturing
[57:29] Faith last time and then there was a gap
[57:32] of around you know almost two months now
[57:35] I'm back and in these two months I had
[57:38] the opportunity of visiting India once
[57:41] again and in this short visit I was able
[57:44] to you know attend a funeral attend a
[57:47] wedding and a betr all three of them you
[57:51] know within the short span of time that
[57:53] I was in
[57:54] Delhi and
[57:56] I definitely do feel that you know in
[57:59] this trip there was something that I
[58:02] learned and I got to know which for
[58:05] which rather I would say the lord gave
[58:08] such a big gap because had I had this
[58:12] second session probably you know uh
[58:14] there was something which I would have
[58:17] not kept or I would have skipped so I
[58:21] want to really go uh you know over it
[58:23] once again just to remind you the things
[58:25] that we saw saw in the last meeting okay
[58:29] uh couple of things first we saw how the
[58:32] days of NOA are here do you remember we
[58:36] spoke about how we saw two you know the
[58:39] dove we flew it you know we left the
[58:41] pigeon out then he came back then left
[58:43] it once again and then came back second
[58:45] time and then you know all those things
[58:48] I I showed you couple of instances that
[58:51] these things happened okay now what I
[58:53] was not able to complete that day was
[58:55] that there is a scripture in the Bible
[58:59] which says as it was in the days of Noah
[59:04] so shall it be you remember have you
[59:07] read that I'm not taking it because I've
[59:09] got a lot of scriptures today so you
[59:13] have to understand that this
[59:16] Bible is not a book of
[59:20] History our God is in
[59:23] present right and how he deals with us
[59:26] is always from the
[59:29] scripture this book it comes to
[59:32] life and this book is the life which is
[59:36] sitting here each one of you have a
[59:39] portion in this okay now when I say this
[59:42] book this book this book I don't mean
[59:45] you know the paper or the ink you know
[59:48] we it will become idol worship right
[59:51] what I mean is the words that are
[59:53] written here inside the book book okay
[59:58] that is the Lord paper will stay here
[1:00:03] but these words they will go inside of
[1:00:06] us and they will change us okay so you
[1:00:09] to always remember that this is not just
[1:00:12] a history book this book repeats it
[1:00:15] reveals itself to its
[1:00:17] own okay so when you see these things
[1:00:21] happening you have to see It'll
[1:00:24] positionally Place us
[1:00:26] where we are standing at that point in
[1:00:28] time okay because it is very important
[1:00:32] that you know this is one of the I
[1:00:35] wouldn't say one of the this is the
[1:00:36] evidence of the Holy Ghost do you know
[1:00:39] what is the evidence of the Holy
[1:00:41] Ghost okay let us go turn to John
[1:00:44] chapter
[1:00:49] 14 I think this is important
[1:00:59] verse
[1:01:04] 26 it says but the comforter which is
[1:01:08] the Holy Ghost whom the father will send
[1:01:10] in my name shall teach you all things
[1:01:14] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:01:18] whatsoever have I have said unto you
[1:01:22] okay so the best evidence of the Holy
[1:01:24] Ghost is exactly this brother you might
[1:01:27] as well just leave that scripture there
[1:01:29] uh so that people can read now the best
[1:01:32] evidence of the Holy Ghost is a person
[1:01:34] who has received the Holy Ghost okay now
[1:01:37] the biggest confusion is that you know
[1:01:39] brother bam said in one of the sermons
[1:01:42] he said that the biggest confusion is
[1:01:44] that uh that devil brings in is that
[1:01:47] people who don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:01:49] feel like they have it and the ones who
[1:01:51] have it don't realize that they have it
[1:01:54] okay so now what happens is I'm going to
[1:01:57] give you the exact scripture and I
[1:02:00] believe the Holy Ghost will you know
[1:02:02] reveal it to you now how do you
[1:02:04] understand that whether you have the
[1:02:05] Holy Ghost or not it is very important
[1:02:09] very Ultra important because everything
[1:02:11] that we do and if you know we are not
[1:02:13] certain because Bible says make your
[1:02:15] calling and election sure that is the
[1:02:18] first step okay now you see the work of
[1:02:22] the Holy Ghost is to bring to
[1:02:24] remembrance okay now let us go and see
[1:02:27] how Holy Ghost actually works okay we'll
[1:02:31] turn to
[1:02:32] Acts chapter
[1:02:46] 2 yeah in the beginning okay I'll read
[1:02:48] from
[1:02:53] verse
[1:02:54] four or maybe
[1:02:57] three and there appeared unto them clo
[1:03:00] tongues like as of fire and it sat upon
[1:03:04] each of them okay now it says that the
[1:03:08] Bible says
[1:03:09] that tongues of
[1:03:12] fire like tongues like as of fire came
[1:03:16] down and sat on each of them okay it
[1:03:20] doesn't say that speaking in tongues is
[1:03:25] the Holy Ghost
[1:03:26] it says that the the flame that came
[1:03:29] down was in the shape of a
[1:03:31] tongue okay so all of them received the
[1:03:35] Holy Ghost this was visually this
[1:03:36] happened there okay then we read further
[1:03:40] and there appeared unto them cloven
[1:03:43] tongues like as of fire and sat upon
[1:03:45] each of them and they were all filled
[1:03:48] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:03:50] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[1:03:53] them utterance okay once they received
[1:03:55] the Holy Ghost they started speaking in
[1:03:58] different tongues now when they speaking
[1:04:00] in different tongues what is happening
[1:04:03] here is that they are not just going
[1:04:05] mumbo
[1:04:06] jumbo okay they are speaking in
[1:04:08] different
[1:04:09] languages and there are people sitting
[1:04:12] there who are listening to them in their
[1:04:14] own
[1:04:15] language because what happened is even
[1:04:18] before uh the Roman general Titus came
[1:04:20] and destroyed Israel Israel was already
[1:04:23] scattered the Jews were already
[1:04:24] scattered everywhere
[1:04:26] okay so some were settled in different
[1:04:28] countries and you know the Jews annually
[1:04:31] they used to come to Jerusalem to
[1:04:33] worship but they were citizens of
[1:04:35] different countries they had you know
[1:04:38] languages of those different countries
[1:04:40] they were speaking but they come
[1:04:42] together in Jerusalem at one point in
[1:04:44] time okay so they were people who speak
[1:04:47] different tongues different languages so
[1:04:49] when the Holy Ghost came the disciples
[1:04:52] they started speaking in the languages
[1:04:55] that they they could understand okay and
[1:04:58] these people who heard them there were
[1:04:59] almost people from 18 nationalities or
[1:05:02] 18 different countries there were people
[1:05:04] here I'm not reading all of their names
[1:05:06] the name of the countries but all of
[1:05:08] them heard these galileans speaking in
[1:05:11] their
[1:05:12] language okay now what happened and then
[1:05:16] they were all
[1:05:17] amazed when they were amazed what
[1:05:20] happened
[1:05:21] is uh I'll read from verse 12 chapter
[1:05:24] 2:2
[1:05:26] and they were all amazed and were in
[1:05:28] doubt saying one to another what meth
[1:05:32] this what is the meaning of all this
[1:05:35] others mocking said these men are full
[1:05:38] of new wine okay some people uh they
[1:05:42] were confused they like wow how can
[1:05:44] these galileans you know Peter was a you
[1:05:47] know a fish I I don't know what to call
[1:05:50] him but person who caught fish yeah fish
[1:05:53] monger is somebody who sells the fish
[1:05:54] but somebody who catches fish okay
[1:05:57] totally uneducated and now he's speaking
[1:06:00] in you know foreign languages all of a
[1:06:02] sudden okay and likewise so many other
[1:06:06] people now you have to understand this
[1:06:08] is what the Holy Ghost does okay see
[1:06:11] what Peter is saying but Peter standing
[1:06:14] up with the 11 lifted up his voice and
[1:06:16] said unto them ye men of Juda and all ye
[1:06:20] that dwell at Jerusalem be this known
[1:06:23] unto you harken my hearken to my words
[1:06:28] for these are not drunken as they as ye
[1:06:31] suppose seeing it is but the third hour
[1:06:34] of the day it is almost morning you know
[1:06:37] these people are not drunk like you feel
[1:06:42] okay but this is that which was spoken
[1:06:46] by the pro Prophet
[1:06:49] Joel okay now you have to see there is
[1:06:52] an there is a commotion happen happening
[1:06:54] here okay okay when this commotion is
[1:06:57] happening Peter stood up okay and now
[1:07:02] whatever is happening there he's able to
[1:07:04] place that somewhere in the
[1:07:07] scripture okay now this is exactly what
[1:07:10] we read in John 14 the Holy Ghost will
[1:07:13] come and interpret
[1:07:16] the happenings in your life and tell you
[1:07:21] that you know what this scripture is
[1:07:24] being fulfilled on this day yes okay
[1:07:27] this day the scripture is being
[1:07:30] fulfilled so when you know that now you
[1:07:33] are not worried now you're are not
[1:07:36] confused oh my God I was praying so much
[1:07:38] and now today this and now today that
[1:07:41] you know perhaps you have to understand
[1:07:43] that once you get the new birth okay you
[1:07:47] are a prisoner of
[1:07:49] Christ okay a prisoner of his love all
[1:07:54] right then from after you receive the
[1:07:57] new birth you are not living for
[1:08:00] yourself you cannot do
[1:08:03] it if you try to you will have more
[1:08:06] trouble yes sir don't
[1:08:09] resist because the New Birth has come in
[1:08:12] to make you a citizen of a different
[1:08:14] place
[1:08:15] altogether
[1:08:17] right uh my brother on the system can
[1:08:20] you project the photograph of the seven
[1:08:23] dimensions that I've showed last time
[1:08:26] no seven dimensions the triangle thing
[1:08:31] and yeah there are a couple of pictures
[1:08:34] I'm sure the brother will get it now
[1:08:36] what happens is
[1:08:38] that when we are born
[1:08:41] again we are born from
[1:08:44] above when you look at above uh brother
[1:08:47] will put it here when we look what we
[1:08:49] mean by above
[1:08:51] is yeah the one before this yes this is
[1:08:54] the one can you see it uh I think it's a
[1:08:58] little uh dark
[1:09:00] but uh yeah here this
[1:09:04] above okay this is the realm of Heaven
[1:09:08] this is where we are right
[1:09:10] now this is where we are right now okay
[1:09:14] the region of mortal beings this is
[1:09:17] where God dwells then Angels then the
[1:09:20] people who are saved in the message
[1:09:23] they've gone before us they are waiting
[1:09:26] here okay and this is the region of the
[1:09:29] lost people whove died outside the
[1:09:32] message and then here are demon
[1:09:35] Spirits this is all the Fifth Dimension
[1:09:38] this whole thing and the bottom you know
[1:09:41] which is Satan this is where the hell is
[1:09:45] now when we are born from above okay
[1:09:48] here we are influenced by things above
[1:09:52] so if you see in the Bible Jesus gets up
[1:09:54] in the morning he says say that today I
[1:09:56] have to go to go through sukar village
[1:09:59] where he will meet the woman of the well
[1:10:01] okay so every day he says the father
[1:10:04] shows me what I have to do okay Jesus
[1:10:08] came here he did not establish big
[1:10:11] organizations he did not make big
[1:10:13] schools big colleges big businesses he
[1:10:17] didn't do any of those things at the age
[1:10:19] of 12 he told Mary that I have to be
[1:10:23] about my father's business
[1:10:26] okay and that is exactly our position
[1:10:29] once we are born again once we receive
[1:10:32] the Holy Ghost okay once we receive the
[1:10:34] Holy Ghost now this is what we are
[1:10:36] supposed to be doing is that now I am
[1:10:38] not living for myself I even if I want
[1:10:42] to not possible okay that is why if you
[1:10:45] see uh in the Bible Paul was very highly
[1:10:50] educated but on the day he met Christ on
[1:10:54] the way to Damascus he fell from the
[1:10:56] horse and that day he realized that all
[1:10:59] his certificates are just dun good for
[1:11:04] nothing okay now my dear children please
[1:11:08] understand that you know I am not saying
[1:11:09] that education is not important
[1:11:12] education is pretty important it is you
[1:11:15] have to be uh there you have to do all
[1:11:18] those things but just to understand the
[1:11:22] concept of being born again okay now
[1:11:26] when we receive the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:11:28] Ghost will again time and again time and
[1:11:31] again Place Us in the scripture and this
[1:11:34] is a
[1:11:35] foolproof thing there is no
[1:11:38] impersonation for
[1:11:39] this because in the
[1:11:42] Bible uh if you read the book of
[1:11:44] Revelations it says that uh everybody
[1:11:48] received a new
[1:11:49] name okay and this new name was a
[1:11:53] secret okay and the secret is only for
[1:11:57] the person who receives it yes sir okay
[1:12:00] like for example this thing happened
[1:12:02] with Peter now Peter can say that you
[1:12:06] know what now I see myself in the
[1:12:09] scripture right now nobody else can
[1:12:12] impersonate that right I can tell you my
[1:12:16] experience you can hear my
[1:12:18] experience but that my experience is my
[1:12:22] Revelation is my new name
[1:12:25] okay so that is why says that you know
[1:12:29] there is no impersonation of this okay
[1:12:32] it is very
[1:12:33] individual all right and once again uh
[1:12:37] you know many of times what happens is
[1:12:39] that when I say that you know uh there
[1:12:42] is no Rapture outside the
[1:12:44] message okay it is absolutely important
[1:12:48] that we understand that anybody who has
[1:12:51] not accepted or not understood this
[1:12:54] message which is come right now in this
[1:12:57] age okay will not be cannot be a part of
[1:13:02] the Rapture many people feel bad upset
[1:13:05] about this thing but I want to just tell
[1:13:07] you this thing that how many of us today
[1:13:11] are expecting that Jesus Christ will
[1:13:12] come and take us to
[1:13:15] Heaven yeah okay now the question is
[1:13:20] when it comes to this
[1:13:23] scripture I'm on my topic of New Birth
[1:13:28] also okay the Holy Ghost I'm not I have
[1:13:30] not left it but I think I have to
[1:13:32] clarify this point also so that you know
[1:13:35] our foundation is absolutely Rock Solid
[1:13:38] where we are supposed to be
[1:13:42] okay
[1:13:48] so if you
[1:13:51] see I have one more question how many of
[1:13:54] us believe believe that Christ has
[1:13:57] already
[1:13:59] come
[1:14:02] right Christ has already come now if you
[1:14:05] look at the denominations or anything or
[1:14:07] anybody outside of the message people
[1:14:09] are very nice no doubt about it nothing
[1:14:12] against you know people good people in
[1:14:14] denominations or other places but the
[1:14:17] fact of the matter still is
[1:14:20] that the Bible
[1:14:23] says okay when you see the Fig leaf or
[1:14:26] fig tree putting forth new leaves okay
[1:14:30] know that the summer is N I think it's
[1:14:32] in Matthew
[1:14:33] 24 Matthew 24 yeah uh I'll give you the
[1:14:38] scripture let us read that
[1:14:41] once yes parable of the fig tree verse
[1:14:45] 32 Matthew
[1:14:47] 24:32 now learn a parable of the Fig
[1:14:49] Tree when his branch is yet tender and
[1:14:52] putteth forth leaves he know the that
[1:14:55] the summer is nigh next verse brother so
[1:14:58] likewise when ye shall see all these
[1:15:01] things know that it is near even at the
[1:15:06] doors verily I say unto you this
[1:15:09] generation shall not pass till all these
[1:15:13] things be fulfilled okay now of course
[1:15:16] heaven and Earth shall never pass shall
[1:15:18] pass away but my word shall never pass
[1:15:20] away now you see that the coming of the
[1:15:24] Lord has to happen in the same
[1:15:28] generation when the Fig Tree putteth
[1:15:31] forth new leaves that means that it has
[1:15:34] to be within a you know a gap of 30 to
[1:15:37] 40 butam said you know 40 years is the
[1:15:39] generation basically so the uh the
[1:15:42] youngest person probably will be like
[1:15:45] you know 1948 is when Israel became a
[1:15:47] nation okay so 40 years from then would
[1:15:50] be at the max you can stretch it to 1988
[1:15:53] okay but the coming has to happen before
[1:15:57] that you see and if you do not believe
[1:16:02] that okay how will you meet
[1:16:06] him so no matter how good a person is
[1:16:09] how holy and how Pious he is if he
[1:16:13] misses the
[1:16:15] cloud he misses the
[1:16:18] Rapture that is why I said that people
[1:16:20] sitting in this room are very elite you
[1:16:24] remember last time I I
[1:16:25] said special weapons and tactics yeah
[1:16:29] you know people sitting here are very
[1:16:32] very special so if you know of somebody
[1:16:37] who is interested in the Rapture and is
[1:16:40] not in the message now would be the
[1:16:43] right time to go and speak with
[1:16:46] them yeah because I am also looking at a
[1:16:51] couple of other things I want to share
[1:16:53] with you regard ing the coming of the
[1:16:55] Lord okay now uh I hope everybody's
[1:16:58] clear with the new birth and the baptism
[1:17:01] of the Holy
[1:17:02] Ghost yeah okay so now you're sure that
[1:17:07] this is how we say that uh we have
[1:17:10] received the Holy Ghost when you can
[1:17:11] place yourself somewhere in the
[1:17:12] scripture okay it is very individual
[1:17:14] personalized all right now the second
[1:17:16] thing is outside of this message there
[1:17:19] cannot be a Rapture brother bham said
[1:17:21] that you know uh the devil does not come
[1:17:23] and entice you it is you go outside the
[1:17:25] message and you meet with him and you
[1:17:29] get you know beaten up why because if
[1:17:33] any of these denominations or any of
[1:17:35] these people outside the message if they
[1:17:38] were to believe that the scripture is
[1:17:40] true that Jesus Christ had to come in
[1:17:43] the same generation when Israel was
[1:17:46] formed then automatically they are in
[1:17:48] the
[1:17:50] message you understand they have to
[1:17:52] believe you know that there was a cloud
[1:17:55] and there was a cloud coming of Christ
[1:17:58] now my question is if Jesus has already
[1:18:02] come why are we still
[1:18:05] here isn't it now we everybody the whole
[1:18:09] world is waiting for Jesus to come and
[1:18:10] they say like you know he will come on
[1:18:12] the clouds and then we will in the
[1:18:13] twinkling of an eye we will you know all
[1:18:16] be changed now the question is that
[1:18:19] people say that Jesus already come in
[1:18:22] 1963 28th February you know we
[1:18:25] celebrated the anniversary yesterday
[1:18:27] probably two days back yeah and
[1:18:30] incidentally this time what happened is
[1:18:31] that exactly on 28th February there were
[1:18:34] these seven planets which came you know
[1:18:38] in one line and brother brandham said
[1:18:41] that before God does anything on Earth
[1:18:45] he shows it in the
[1:18:46] sky yeah he shows it in the sky before
[1:18:50] he does anything on Earth okay and these
[1:18:53] planets aligning
[1:18:55] is not a simple thing
[1:18:58] because Jesus Christ was born when such
[1:19:01] an alignment happened okay Moses The
[1:19:04] Exodus Prophet was born when such an
[1:19:07] alignment was you know happened you see
[1:19:10] so this alignment of planets and that
[1:19:12] also almost all the planets because we
[1:19:14] are on the eighth there are seven
[1:19:16] planets which were you know visible in
[1:19:18] one line and we are on the eighth planet
[1:19:20] Pluto is no longer considered a planet
[1:19:22] so the whole solar system was you know
[1:19:25] witnessing a big event on the 28th of
[1:19:29] February okay the entire Cosmos was
[1:19:32] watching something happening on Earth
[1:19:37] yeah all seven of them were lined up
[1:19:40] okay now what happens
[1:19:42] is question again you know if Jesus
[1:19:46] Christ has
[1:19:47] come why are we still here why are we
[1:19:50] not
[1:19:51] gone the very simple answer for that is
[1:19:55] you have to look back at the first
[1:19:57] coming Jesus Christ was born on whatever
[1:20:01] day he was born on but he had to
[1:20:04] minister for 33 and a half years okay
[1:20:08] the dead were raised Graves were open
[1:20:11] did not happen on the same day he was
[1:20:14] born it took about 33 and a half years
[1:20:19] Jesus had to die he had he had to raise
[1:20:21] up when he rose up the dead in Christ or
[1:20:23] the Old Testament Saints they rose up
[1:20:26] and people saw them walking in Jerusalem
[1:20:29] okay similarly when the second coming
[1:20:32] happens it doesn't happen in a
[1:20:36] moment second coming also has three
[1:20:40] parts like I told you last time what are
[1:20:42] the three
[1:20:44] parts shout voice and
[1:20:48] Trump the shout will gather the living
[1:20:52] bride we might be in different phases of
[1:20:54] life life different places the shout
[1:20:56] will gather
[1:20:57] us okay now the message goes out okay
[1:21:03] and the voice will raise the dead Saints
[1:21:07] The Voice will come from within the
[1:21:08] bride it is the bridegroom who's
[1:21:10] standing there his voice Echoes from
[1:21:12] inside the bride okay the dead in Christ
[1:21:14] will raise up
[1:21:16] again and at the Trump all of us will be
[1:21:20] changed okay so now like he said last
[1:21:23] time I'm always is refering to the last
[1:21:25] meeting because this is in fact a
[1:21:27] continuation now what happens
[1:21:30] is like the last time shout voice and
[1:21:34] Trump and we saw that when the shout
[1:21:37] Goes Forth okay Rapture has already
[1:21:40] started potentially it has identified it
[1:21:43] you know its candidates okay and what it
[1:21:46] does is that it picks them up okay we
[1:21:49] read it in the scripture last time two
[1:21:51] will be in bed one will be caught up two
[1:21:53] will be in the field one will be caught
[1:21:55] up caught up where where are they caught
[1:21:59] up where the meat
[1:22:02] is that means they will be brought
[1:22:05] together where the carcass is where the
[1:22:06] meat is so they are all caught up and
[1:22:09] brought to the
[1:22:11] message okay so this is where we all
[1:22:14] meet all right now once this
[1:22:18] happens at a certain point in time when
[1:22:21] the last sheep comes in and you know the
[1:22:24] time is
[1:22:25] over Christ will take us home and the
[1:22:29] our body change will happen in the
[1:22:32] twinkling of an eye okay but Rapture is
[1:22:35] a process the second coming is a process
[1:22:39] it carries on it till the time all the
[1:22:43] thoughts of God are not manifested here
[1:22:46] it carries on okay because everybody
[1:22:50] who's a candidate of the Rapture has to
[1:22:51] appear on Earth and has to identify his
[1:22:55] position in Christ that is when the
[1:22:57] Rapture happens brother mam said that
[1:22:59] when the bride recognizes her position
[1:23:01] that is when the Rapture will come by
[1:23:04] okay now the coming of the Lord is one
[1:23:08] of the biggest mysteries in the
[1:23:12] Bible how many of us know that there are
[1:23:14] three Bibles that were
[1:23:16] written yeah one was in the
[1:23:20] sky yeah second was in the pyramid
[1:23:25] yeah and the third is this one that we
[1:23:28] have in our hands okay now when we read
[1:23:31] the
[1:23:34] scripture the Bible says nobody knows
[1:23:37] the day of his coming not even the
[1:23:39] angels but only the father who is in
[1:23:41] heaven okay now I would also want to uh
[1:23:46] read this a little further chapter 24
[1:23:49] that we learn read right now verse 32
[1:23:52] and 353 we read
[1:23:55] now uh I want to read verse
[1:24:00] 36 but of that day and okay I'll read
[1:24:03] one uh verse before so that you know we
[1:24:06] are we get the context we were reading
[1:24:08] this all this file okay Heaven and Earth
[1:24:10] shall pass away but my word shall not
[1:24:12] pass
[1:24:13] away but of that day and hour knoweth no
[1:24:16] man no not the angels of heaven but my
[1:24:20] father only okay go further brother but
[1:24:25] as the days of no were so shall be the
[1:24:30] coming of son of man
[1:24:33] be okay so now you see how this days of
[1:24:38] no
[1:24:40] okay is plugged into this scripture also
[1:24:43] okay so when you see things like this
[1:24:45] happening you know our Ana should just
[1:24:49] go up okay oh my God I read this
[1:24:52] somewhere okay now this is what is
[1:24:54] happening
[1:24:58] Brother for as the days that were before
[1:25:01] the flood they were eating and drinking
[1:25:04] marrying and giving in marriage until
[1:25:07] the day that no entered the
[1:25:10] Ark and knew not until the flood came
[1:25:14] and took them all away so shall also the
[1:25:18] coming of the son of man
[1:25:20] be okay it is important that you know
[1:25:24] why I'm emphasizing on this is because
[1:25:26] like I already told you the evidence of
[1:25:28] the Holy Ghost is that you know our
[1:25:32] present situations he will place it in
[1:25:34] the
[1:25:35] scripture okay and let us know that this
[1:25:38] is the time and season that you are in
[1:25:39] right now okay brother next
[1:25:44] verse there shall be two in the field
[1:25:47] one shall be taken and the other left
[1:25:50] two women shall be grinding at the Mill
[1:25:52] one shall be taken the other left
[1:25:54] left watch therefore for ye know not
[1:25:59] what are are your lord do come okay you
[1:26:03] don't know know the are okay go further
[1:26:05] brother but know
[1:26:07] this there is a butt here okay the butt
[1:26:11] changes the whole sentence you know like
[1:26:14] for example John is a very nice person
[1:26:19] but you know it changes the whole so you
[1:26:23] know uh brother go back to the previous
[1:26:25] verse watch therefore for ye know not
[1:26:29] what are your lord do
[1:26:32] come
[1:26:33] but yeah all this while he was saying
[1:26:36] that you do not know but know this that
[1:26:40] if the good man of the house had known
[1:26:42] in what watch the thief would come he
[1:26:45] would have watched and would not have
[1:26:47] suffered his house to be broken you
[1:26:50] understand that so what is the scripture
[1:26:52] saying here you know as it is you do not
[1:26:56] know but if you
[1:26:58] know the date when he
[1:27:02] came okay you can be
[1:27:05] prepared the world for them he's coming
[1:27:08] like a thief they will never know okay
[1:27:11] their house will be broken up anybody
[1:27:15] who doesn't know that he has come their
[1:27:17] house will be broken up you understand
[1:27:21] so this but makes a lot of difference in
[1:27:24] the
[1:27:25] scripture and we standing here today
[1:27:28] where we are 63 years prior we already
[1:27:33] know that on such and such date now what
[1:27:37] is the significance of knowing the
[1:27:39] date the significance of knowing the
[1:27:42] date see the scripture says here that if
[1:27:44] you know that you know the thief was
[1:27:46] going to come if you knew then what you
[1:27:48] would have been
[1:27:50] prepared to defend your home okay and
[1:27:53] those those people who don't know the
[1:27:55] thief is coming their house will be
[1:27:57] broken up so what that means is if you
[1:27:59] know when he's coming you can be
[1:28:01] prepared for the
[1:28:03] Rapture okay and in case if you do not
[1:28:06] know then God bless three and a half
[1:28:10] years of tribulation is on the earth
[1:28:14] anyways okay but you to understand this
[1:28:17] is exactly what the scripture says I am
[1:28:19] not setting the date for the Rapture I I
[1:28:22] I do not know when our bodies are going
[1:28:23] to to change but I definitely know when
[1:28:26] the Lord Has
[1:28:27] Come okay when he comes and he speaks to
[1:28:31] us I
[1:28:33] know right and this is exactly now
[1:28:37] coming to this point here okay uh let's
[1:28:41] go further there is something else I
[1:28:42] want to speak but uh let me finish this
[1:28:44] therefore be uh ye also ready see the
[1:28:48] Bible says be
[1:28:49] ready be you know if you don't know that
[1:28:52] time what will you be ready for
[1:28:54] Bible says very clearly be ready for in
[1:28:58] such an are that as ye think not the son
[1:29:01] of man
[1:29:03] cometh then who is a faithful and wise
[1:29:06] servant whom had the Lord made ruler of
[1:29:09] his household to give meat in due season
[1:29:12] okay now this the Lord is talking about
[1:29:14] the prophet in you know meat in due
[1:29:16] season so that the Bride Can mature okay
[1:29:20] blessed is that servant whom his Lord
[1:29:22] when he cometh shall find so
[1:29:26] doing
[1:29:28] okay and of course this is about the you
[1:29:31] know Rapture that we talking about so
[1:29:33] please understand that we today outside
[1:29:37] the message no scope there is absolutely
[1:29:40] no way they will know when the Rapture
[1:29:41] is coming okay first thing second thing
[1:29:44] is that if even if they try to copy it
[1:29:47] they cannot do it because you know the
[1:29:50] cloud has come and if you acknowledge
[1:29:51] the crowd you're already in the message
[1:29:53] if you if you don't know that then uh
[1:29:55] you know there's nothing else left you
[1:29:57] can just be in good hope that you know
[1:30:00] one day he will come he will take us one
[1:30:02] day he will come but the ones who are to
[1:30:04] go will already have gone by the time
[1:30:09] okay now what happens
[1:30:12] is when we see the
[1:30:15] scripture you know that you are going
[1:30:17] away is near and the biggest mystery
[1:30:21] like I was saying in the Bible is the
[1:30:23] coming of the Lord okay it was hidden
[1:30:27] from the
[1:30:28] beginning it was hidden from the
[1:30:30] beginning why because every time you
[1:30:35] know the coming was going to happen the
[1:30:38] devil he gets a wind of it he comes and
[1:30:41] corrupts it you know Christ was supposed
[1:30:44] to be born in the Garden of
[1:30:46] Eden he was supposed to be born there
[1:30:50] but the serpent beu Eve and
[1:30:54] you know Abel was
[1:30:56] born then once again now this is another
[1:31:00] instance which I want to go into in a
[1:31:03] little depth but before I do that I want
[1:31:06] you to take out one scripture brother
[1:31:08] Joshua
[1:31:12] 5:4 Book of Joshua 5 verse 14 can you
[1:31:17] display that
[1:31:22] please uh maybe you you can take it from
[1:31:24] 13
[1:31:25] verse and it came to pass when Joshua
[1:31:28] was by Jericho that he lifted up his
[1:31:30] eyes and looked and behold there stood a
[1:31:34] man
[1:31:35] against oh there stood a man over
[1:31:38] against him with his sword drone in his
[1:31:41] hand and Joshua went unto him and said
[1:31:44] unto him art thou for us or for our
[1:31:48] adversaries okay so Joshua is seeing a
[1:31:51] man who is standing there he goes and
[1:31:53] asks him
[1:31:54] are you with us or with the enemies and
[1:31:58] the man who was standing there says and
[1:32:01] he said nay but as the captain of the
[1:32:03] host of the Lord and I am now come and
[1:32:09] Joshua fell on his face to the ground
[1:32:11] and did worship and said unto him what
[1:32:15] sayith my Lord unto his servant now you
[1:32:19] should understand the reaction of Joshua
[1:32:22] a mighty warrior
[1:32:24] okay he sees the angel of the Lord he
[1:32:27] sees the Lord what does he do he falls
[1:32:30] on his
[1:32:32] face okay immediately he falls on his
[1:32:34] face he's like you know no no I I can't
[1:32:37] do you know I've seen the Lord okay and
[1:32:41] the Lord says take your shoes off you
[1:32:43] know next verse you'll see he says you
[1:32:45] know the land you're standing this the
[1:32:47] ground you're standing on is Holy yeah
[1:32:49] the captain of the Lord's host said unto
[1:32:51] Joshua losen thy shoe from thy foot for
[1:32:53] the the place whereon thou standest is
[1:32:56] Holy and Joshua did so taking off your
[1:32:59] shoes actually means removing your
[1:33:01] understanding okay changing your
[1:33:03] understanding you know do don't look at
[1:33:06] god with your own understanding you have
[1:33:08] to go to the scripture okay because God
[1:33:11] is his own interpreter so take off your
[1:33:14] shoes Okay so Joshua did that then there
[1:33:18] is another person in the scripture uh
[1:33:21] which is uh Gideon okay not just G there
[1:33:25] are so many people who have seen the
[1:33:27] angel of the Lord and they like you know
[1:33:28] they go like really scared if you want
[1:33:30] to read Gideon G is in Judges chapter 6
[1:33:34] verse 22 brother if you can display it
[1:33:37] then you know I can save some time uh
[1:33:39] and I can just read it off
[1:33:43] there Judges chapter
[1:33:45] 6 verse
[1:33:49] 22 God bless you and when Gideon
[1:33:52] perceived that it he was an Angel of the
[1:33:54] Lord Gideon said alas oh Lord God for
[1:33:59] because I have seen an angel of the Lord
[1:34:01] face to
[1:34:04] face and the Lord said unto him peace be
[1:34:06] unto thee fear not for Thou shalt not
[1:34:09] die okay if you read uh verse 21 also
[1:34:13] brother it says that you
[1:34:17] know okay so you know this is what the
[1:34:19] angel of the Lord did now Gideon sees
[1:34:22] this Angel and he's so scared he's so
[1:34:24] scared he's like you know I'm going to
[1:34:26] die okay now look at this this is what
[1:34:30] Warriors are doing okay when they see
[1:34:33] the angel of the Lord they get scared
[1:34:37] like anything they're like oh my God
[1:34:39] what do we do we've seen the Lord okay
[1:34:42] now this is what Warriors are doing but
[1:34:45] look at this Genesis chapter
[1:34:49] 18 verse 17 onwards h
[1:34:59] no I think we go a little uh before this
[1:35:02] probably 12 verse
[1:35:05] 12 therefore Sara laughed okay now look
[1:35:08] at this what SAR is doing therefore
[1:35:10] Sarah laughed within herself saying
[1:35:12] after I am waxed old shall I have
[1:35:14] pleasure my Lord being old
[1:35:18] also and the Lord said unto
[1:35:21] Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying
[1:35:24] shall I of a shity bear a child which
[1:35:27] I'm old okay now the Lord is saying here
[1:35:30] that you know Sarah laughed why did she
[1:35:32] laugh
[1:35:34] okay uh brother put the scripture back
[1:35:37] is anything too hard for the Lord at the
[1:35:40] time appointed I will return unto thee
[1:35:42] according to the time of life SAR shall
[1:35:45] have a son okay according to the time of
[1:35:48] life which means 28 days okay so uh
[1:35:54] probably you know February 28th yeah
[1:35:57] according to the time of life he was
[1:35:59] supposed to come back and Sarah was
[1:36:01] supposed to have a son and the son would
[1:36:03] have
[1:36:05] been son would have been
[1:36:09] Jesus okay but alas because Jesus also
[1:36:14] called the son of Abraham at some places
[1:36:17] so he was supposed to be born right
[1:36:18] there but because of Sarah's unbelief
[1:36:22] here
[1:36:24] another person was born not Jesus okay
[1:36:29] now the important thing here
[1:36:33] is next verse then Sarah denied saying I
[1:36:37] laughed not for she was afraid and he
[1:36:40] said nay but thou did
[1:36:45] laugh can you imagine somebody saying
[1:36:47] you know Lord standing right in front
[1:36:50] and Lord said why did you laugh and she
[1:36:53] goes like I did not
[1:36:57] laugh you know contrast this with the
[1:37:00] Warriors they're standing there they're
[1:37:03] falling on their
[1:37:05] face and
[1:37:07] this poor little lady she is calling God
[1:37:11] a
[1:37:12] liar this time she's not doing it behind
[1:37:15] his back this time she's doing it on his
[1:37:19] face can you imagine
[1:37:21] that she's saying on his face no I did
[1:37:25] not laugh you're
[1:37:28] lying and can you imagine
[1:37:32] if you know Joshua Gideon manoha so many
[1:37:37] people in the Bible you know they just
[1:37:39] imagine if they understood that this is
[1:37:43] where the Lord is and this is what he's
[1:37:46] capable of okay and they're falling on
[1:37:49] their faces but this poor little
[1:37:54] Sarah standing right in front of the
[1:37:57] Lord telling him that no Lord this time
[1:38:02] you are
[1:38:03] wrong you are lying because I did not
[1:38:07] laugh Bible says he was
[1:38:10] scared
[1:38:11] regardless you know God would have split
[1:38:14] her atoms at that very
[1:38:17] moment can you understand he would have
[1:38:21] split her you know made
[1:38:23] made her atoms disappear because he's
[1:38:26] the Lord okay but the Lord held his
[1:38:30] peace you know
[1:38:33] why because there was a seven ltered man
[1:38:37] standing right there who was her
[1:38:41] husband
[1:38:43] Abraham ending with h okay he was
[1:38:47] standing there that is why my dear
[1:38:50] sisters I would say this is the
[1:38:54] importance of your marital
[1:38:59] relationship can you imagine why does
[1:39:01] Sarah call Abraham Lord know Bible in
[1:39:04] First Peter it says that Sarah used to
[1:39:06] call Abraham
[1:39:08] Lord If Abraham would not have been
[1:39:12] there you know Sarah would not have seen
[1:39:14] the light of
[1:39:15] day the same is today for the church and
[1:39:19] the
[1:39:21] pastor the position that the Pastor
[1:39:23] holds in the church is
[1:39:26] phenomenal he stands in the
[1:39:30] Gap so
[1:39:33] please we do not want to be like Sarah
[1:39:35] in this situation yes Sarah is a very
[1:39:38] good person otherwise you know Hebrews
[1:39:40] 11 you see actually all everybody from
[1:39:44] Genesis to uh Revelation everybody has
[1:39:47] sinned but when God remembers in Hebrews
[1:39:50] 11 he only remembers the good things
[1:39:52] that they have done
[1:39:53] okay he just you know throws everything
[1:39:56] else in the sea of forgetfulness but
[1:39:58] that Sarah is me and
[1:40:00] you without this
[1:40:04] message you know what would have
[1:40:06] happened to
[1:40:07] us that is why I would not debate
[1:40:10] whether the wife is equal with the
[1:40:13] husband or husband is stronger or weaker
[1:40:16] I'm not getting into that all I'm trying
[1:40:18] to say
[1:40:19] is
[1:40:21] when a wife
[1:40:24] understands her
[1:40:26] position she can do
[1:40:29] wonders you know I would just give you
[1:40:31] an example like you know there is this
[1:40:34] uh acid called sulfuric acid okay I
[1:40:37] think it h204 isn't it yeah h204
[1:40:41] hydrogen sulfur and oxygen when you mix
[1:40:45] them it becomes very
[1:40:47] corrosive but otherwise we are always
[1:40:50] drinking water that has got hydrogen and
[1:40:52] oxygen
[1:40:54] okay but when these chemicals come into
[1:40:57] their
[1:40:58] position then you can't drink it you
[1:41:02] understand then the devil will get you
[1:41:05] know a jolt when he comes to touch a
[1:41:09] wife who knows her position when the
[1:41:12] Devil comes and you know tries to bring
[1:41:14] confusion in the house and the wife
[1:41:16] knows her
[1:41:17] position devil cannot touch her devil
[1:41:20] cannot touch her family devil cannot
[1:41:22] touch her children
[1:41:24] because she is a wife who knows a
[1:41:26] position yeah in the same way the same
[1:41:31] relationship happens with the church and
[1:41:34] the
[1:41:36] pastor a church which
[1:41:39] understands the the importance of that
[1:41:44] position is a formidable Church nobody
[1:41:47] can come close to it you know you speak
[1:41:51] and things will happen
[1:41:54] because you are in the position you know
[1:41:58] uh gave an example of a traffic
[1:42:00] policeman a 20 Tire a big huge truck you
[1:42:04] know coming at huge speed the policeman
[1:42:06] a frail man you know just shows his hand
[1:42:08] like this and no matter how big the
[1:42:11] truck is you know now how many wheels or
[1:42:14] whatever you know the uh cubic capacity
[1:42:17] the truck has to
[1:42:18] stop you know it's the power is not in
[1:42:21] the hands
[1:42:23] power is when the person understands
[1:42:26] that I am an officer of the law I am an
[1:42:29] ambassador of
[1:42:30] Heaven I have to stand in line I have to
[1:42:34] stand right behind my pastor okay when
[1:42:37] you do that you see your most of your
[1:42:42] problem in your life are already
[1:42:44] solved okay now I say
[1:42:49] this because these are foundational
[1:42:52] things fundamental
[1:42:53] things
[1:42:55] okay big Revelations probably yeah
[1:42:58] important but this is where the foxes
[1:43:01] you know he said the fox is the
[1:43:04] roots okay so you have to understand no
[1:43:07] matter how educated the wife is no
[1:43:09] matter how strong or how intelligent or
[1:43:12] how whatever but she has to understand
[1:43:15] her position with her
[1:43:17] husband and when she does that no devil
[1:43:21] can come close to her absolutely no the
[1:43:24] same is for the church and the same is
[1:43:27] when you understand the office of the
[1:43:31] Prophet you know forget the devil God
[1:43:34] could not do anything to
[1:43:37] Sarah can you beat that forget devil
[1:43:41] even the Lord had to stand there you
[1:43:42] know hands folded I can't touch her
[1:43:45] right now because there is Abraham
[1:43:49] here you see that no matter how big a
[1:43:53] sinner we are only if we understand our
[1:43:56] position we are totally you know in a
[1:43:58] different realm altoe we had we saw that
[1:44:01] you know chart so that is why you have
[1:44:04] to see that God has very good things in
[1:44:08] store for us and his scripture is very
[1:44:11] simple you don't have to be a PhD and a
[1:44:14] you know doctor of divinity and ddld and
[1:44:17] all those to understand it a Peter who
[1:44:20] could not sign his name can understand
[1:44:23] you and me can too okay now coming
[1:44:28] to the coming of the Lord you see this
[1:44:31] is another thing that I want to really
[1:44:33] emphasize on because rapturing faith is
[1:44:36] based
[1:44:38] on a lot of things but the important
[1:44:41] thing right now that we are going to
[1:44:42] look at is the coming of the Lord you to
[1:44:45] understand I was telling you that the
[1:44:47] Bible is written in three
[1:44:48] places and all these three places talk
[1:44:52] about the coming of the Lord God if you
[1:44:54] see
[1:44:55] Celestial in the
[1:44:58] skies okay it talks about Virgo Virgo is
[1:45:02] the Virgin which is the first coming of
[1:45:06] Christ virgin
[1:45:07] born okay
[1:45:09] then Leo Leo is the second coming as the
[1:45:14] lion of the tribe of Judah okay so this
[1:45:18] is the mystery see Bible says in Hebrews
[1:45:21] 10 that the old Testament is the shadow
[1:45:24] of the New Testament okay the original
[1:45:26] is the New
[1:45:28] Testament so the coming of the Lord the
[1:45:31] whole of the Old Testament was a shadow
[1:45:33] shadow is uh like for example you keep
[1:45:35] your hand here you'll be able to see a
[1:45:38] shadow you can say that this is a hand
[1:45:39] it's got five fingers but you cannot say
[1:45:41] what is the color of the hand yeah you
[1:45:43] cannot say if it's a male hand or a
[1:45:45] female hand okay it'll give you a vake
[1:45:48] picture the Shadow the Old Testament yes
[1:45:50] the same it give you a shadow example of
[1:45:53] a shadow uh Abraham went uh to mount
[1:45:56] morah he was supposed to sacrifice Isaac
[1:46:01] okay then he took the knife he was about
[1:46:03] to kill him and the uh Angel appeared
[1:46:06] said don't harm the child then he found
[1:46:08] a ram in the bush Okay then he untied
[1:46:12] the ram he sacrificed the ram both of
[1:46:15] them came back so this was what happened
[1:46:17] in the Old Testament now in the Old
[1:46:20] Testament it is difficult we can't say
[1:46:21] who the ram was who Isaac was okay and
[1:46:26] who Abraham
[1:46:27] was because that is a shadow the
[1:46:29] original was when Jesus Christ came he
[1:46:32] was the Lamb of God okay that is the
[1:46:35] original he was the Lamb of God Isaac
[1:46:37] was you and me who was supposed to be
[1:46:39] you know killed so instead of us he took
[1:46:43] the death okay so this is the original
[1:46:46] and Old Testament Shadow the complete of
[1:46:49] the Old Testament Shadow okay now to
[1:46:52] tell the truth even if you
[1:46:55] see the real thing the real deal is
[1:46:59] today the
[1:47:02] bride this is the real uh you know
[1:47:05] picture because everything else was made
[1:47:09] was written so that today you and me can
[1:47:12] identify our position Abraham did not
[1:47:14] have a Bible you see Abraham did not
[1:47:18] have a Bible neither did most of the Old
[1:47:21] Testament people okay they had just
[1:47:23] writings which they could refer to and
[1:47:25] you know they just wrote about
[1:47:26] themselves mostly you know David saying
[1:47:29] you know in the Psalms he's writing
[1:47:30] about himself but as a prophet as a
[1:47:34] prophecy he was writing about Jesus
[1:47:37] Christ okay so we saw the first coming
[1:47:41] was written in the
[1:47:42] skies the second in the
[1:47:46] pyramid brother I don't know if I have
[1:47:48] the picture of the pyramid is it there
[1:47:52] if it is there you can if you can just
[1:47:53] display no this is not yes now this is
[1:47:58] the uh image of the pyramid if you see
[1:48:02] in the pyramid there is the King's
[1:48:05] chamber there is the great gallery and
[1:48:08] the Queen's chamber and of course the
[1:48:10] entrance now this great Gallery it seems
[1:48:13] has seven
[1:48:14] steps and this is the place where uh the
[1:48:19] receiving uh thing is like you know
[1:48:22] where the elazer thing so now the seven
[1:48:25] steps are the seven Church
[1:48:28] ages okay and here is the prophet who is
[1:48:32] introducer okay and this is the King's
[1:48:35] chamber inside the king's chamber I
[1:48:37] forgot to put the picture but inside the
[1:48:38] king's chamber you find an empty tomb in
[1:48:42] the pyramid actually in the pyramid that
[1:48:43] is there okay so this once again talks
[1:48:48] about the second coming of Christ now
[1:48:52] there are too many numbers in the
[1:48:54] pyramid the casing stones of the pyramid
[1:48:56] were 1 lakh 144,000 which corresponds to
[1:49:00] the number of jeice that will be saved
[1:49:03] okay 1 lakh 144 12,000 from each tribe
[1:49:06] now the radius of the pyramid and it is
[1:49:09] in the bang center of the landmass of
[1:49:12] the earth that is where this pyramid is
[1:49:14] placed it lines up with stars in the sky
[1:49:18] Alpha draon is and you know all those
[1:49:20] things so this is where the second Bible
[1:49:22] was written okay and the third Bible of
[1:49:25] course we have it right here in our
[1:49:27] hands okay now uh you can take this off
[1:49:31] I'm not going in deep in the pyramids
[1:49:32] but I just want to show you that you
[1:49:33] know this is where the second Bible was
[1:49:35] written the third is with us okay
[1:49:39] now the coming of the
[1:49:42] Lord was a
[1:49:44] mystery but today it is
[1:49:49] history okay now it is happened and it
[1:49:52] is gone
[1:49:54] so when we read
[1:49:58] this you have to see where we are
[1:50:01] standing today where are we standing
[1:50:03] today okay now let us turn a little bit
[1:50:07] towards the world events okay I told you
[1:50:11] from the scripture we can deduce a
[1:50:13] little bit of the days of
[1:50:15] Noah okay from the scriptures we saw
[1:50:18] last meeting we corresponded with it
[1:50:20] okay and we were able to place but today
[1:50:23] if you see the world events which are
[1:50:25] happening Russia is going ahead and
[1:50:28] annexing a lot of countries okay it
[1:50:30] started with cria okay which is a part
[1:50:33] of Ukraine now there's a war which is
[1:50:35] going on for the last four years now the
[1:50:37] question
[1:50:39] is why is it important for us as
[1:50:43] Believers to see what Russia is
[1:50:48] doing uh brother if you can uh open one
[1:50:51] message okay I'll give you the name of
[1:50:53] the
[1:50:57] message but before I do that uh does
[1:51:00] anybody know about the three curtains
[1:51:02] that brother brandham spoke about three
[1:51:04] curtains can you name
[1:51:06] them Iron
[1:51:08] Curtain purple curtain and bamboo
[1:51:12] curtain okay these are the three
[1:51:15] curtains that we have to keep watching
[1:51:18] and incidentally uh I'll tell you the
[1:51:20] three curtains the purple curtain is
[1:51:23] Rome okay now do you know that the pope
[1:51:26] is
[1:51:28] hospitalized right so there is movement
[1:51:30] in the purple curtain do you know that
[1:51:34] Russia is already in the war the Iron
[1:51:37] Curtain right and also China for that
[1:51:42] matter right all of a sudden they've
[1:51:45] also become a world power yeah so these
[1:51:48] things were prophesied by the prophet
[1:51:51] already now if you actually look at it
[1:51:55] these are the countries which
[1:51:58] matter
[1:52:00] today so and also we as Believers are we
[1:52:04] supposed to be looking at all these
[1:52:06] politics which are happening there see
[1:52:07] let's see what the prophet said uh I
[1:52:09] want you to uh take the uh message
[1:52:12] brother perian Church age
[1:52:14] verse
[1:52:17] 177 yeah pergami pergami perian Church
[1:52:21] age par
[1:52:23] 177 it was preached in
[1:52:31] 1960 I'm sorry I should have given it to
[1:52:33] you earlier but it's
[1:52:36] okay here brother bam says watch Russia
[1:52:40] watch
[1:52:41] Russia the King of the
[1:52:44] North how do you watch Russia
[1:52:47] actually how do you watch
[1:52:50] Russia only if you're aware of what is
[1:52:53] happening there current affairs so is it
[1:52:56] important to follow the
[1:52:57] news is it important to know what is
[1:53:00] happening around you yes it
[1:53:03] is see
[1:53:07] uh yeah so there is three curtains
[1:53:09] remember this there is the Iron
[1:53:11] [Music]
[1:53:13] Curtain there is the bamboo curtain red
[1:53:15] China and so and there is the purple
[1:53:17] curtain and that is the deceiver okay so
[1:53:21] now here is says watch Russia I don't

[1:53:27] go you'll come down rather you know
[1:53:31] yeah there is three know a little bit uh
[1:53:34] further
[1:53:35] down more more more more yeah okay okay
[1:53:40] okay yeah I don't know how long I live
[1:53:43] but remember this as I've told you many
[1:53:46] years ago watch Russia there is three
[1:53:49] curtains remember this there is the Iron
[1:53:51] Curtain there is the bamboo curtain
[1:53:54] which is uh righted China and so on and
[1:53:56] the purple curtain you watch that
[1:53:59] curtain now here he's saying
[1:54:02] watch the purple curtain
[1:54:04] also so when the pope is just about to
[1:54:08] pass away keep watching something is
[1:54:11] going to happen there don't take your
[1:54:13] eyes off okay because your time is
[1:54:16] coming
[1:54:17] near yeah don't be see the whole the
[1:54:21] whole point of having the cloud coming
[1:54:23] of Christ is so that we pay attention to
[1:54:27] this
[1:54:29] message see the the cloud came with a
[1:54:33] message the cloud is not just another
[1:54:36] Cloud you know every day we have clouds
[1:54:37] here in Calgary it was not another Cloud
[1:54:40] not just another Cloud This Cloud came
[1:54:42] with a message which asks you
[1:54:44] specifically to do a certain
[1:54:47] thing if you believe in the
[1:54:50] cloud you will follow my Commandments
[1:54:53] you know that's what Jesus said you
[1:54:55] remember if you love me what will you
[1:54:59] do keep my Commandments yeah so if you
[1:55:03] identify that it was the cloud coming of
[1:55:07] Christ keep the Commandments when he
[1:55:09] says watch Russia watch the purple
[1:55:11] curtain you watch them the world is not
[1:55:15] watching they do not know what is
[1:55:19] happening they are waiting for a tariff
[1:55:23] War for this for that and then you know
[1:55:25] so many other things but you know the
[1:55:28] secret you know when there is a movement
[1:55:31] in the curtains something is fixing to
[1:55:34] happen so you better get ready like I
[1:55:36] said if you have got loved ones dear
[1:55:38] ones who are still not in the message
[1:55:41] this would be a very good time to get
[1:55:43] back to them and talk to them and you
[1:55:46] know brother bam said you know apply the
[1:55:49] token apply the token
[1:55:53] because now is the time to do it because
[1:55:56] later on you will not get a chance okay
[1:56:00] but before you apply the token for
[1:56:02] somebody else like you you know like
[1:56:04] they say In the Aeroplane put your mask
[1:56:07] first then you assist others make your
[1:56:10] own calling and election sure
[1:56:13] first yeah do that make sure that you
[1:56:17] understand where you're standing in the
[1:56:19] word and when you get that no devil can
[1:56:23] take it away from you that is your
[1:56:26] Revelation okay given personally to you
[1:56:30] right so when you know where you are
[1:56:33] standing that is a time when you can
[1:56:35] apply the
[1:56:36] token and like always the third pull has
[1:56:42] three
[1:56:43] folds first is preaching to the total
[1:56:48] lost I don't know who is the total lost
[1:56:50] but the scripture says preaching to the
[1:56:52] total lost which means there will be
[1:56:55] people who will reject the message okay
[1:56:59] there will be people so don't be
[1:57:00] surprised that is a part of the third
[1:57:02] pull the second
[1:57:04] fold manifestation of the spoken
[1:57:08] word now when I talk about manifestation
[1:57:11] of the spoken
[1:57:12] word I would like to draw your attention
[1:57:15] I still have some time I would like to
[1:57:17] draw your
[1:57:18] attention to a certain scripture once
[1:57:21] again
[1:57:23] or rather I will not open it in the
[1:57:24] Bible because we have well little time
[1:57:27] remaining I want to finish uh within the
[1:57:29] time so if you
[1:57:33] see scripture
[1:57:35] says um brother uh once again the
[1:57:39] seventh
[1:57:43] seal seventh seal para 390
[1:57:54] it's okay we have
[1:57:57] time yeah so here brother bam talks
[1:58:00] about
[1:58:01] America he talks about the economy of
[1:58:08] America and he says how you know America
[1:58:11] is spending money which will be
[1:58:13] collected you know 40 years from
[1:58:17] now uh yeah we were looking at par 390
[1:58:20] yeah yeah
[1:58:28] ising your uh no I think this is not
[1:58:32] that
[1:58:36] one coming of the Lord uh 390 yeah 390
[1:58:41] to 392 it's okay keep it on let us
[1:58:50] read okay
[1:58:58] notice there is a whole earth is to be
[1:59:00] purged there will be such a thing that
[1:59:02] the moon stars and all nature will be
[1:59:04] purged you see what is it the Earth is
[1:59:05] renewing herself being purged getting
[1:59:07] ready for the Millennium the Millennium
[1:59:09] is coming up and see everything that's
[1:59:11] got any filth in it is to be purged
[1:59:14] during The Sixth
[1:59:15] Seal next parab brother now now do you
[1:59:20] notice the opening of this seventh
[1:59:24] seal yeah opening of the seventh seal is
[1:59:26] also a three-fold mystery one I have I
[1:59:29] will speak to
[1:59:33] you yeah one I have uh this one I have
[1:59:37] will speak to you and have spoken that
[1:59:39] is a mystery of the seven Thunders seven
[1:59:40] thunders in heaven will unfold this
[1:59:42] mystery will be right the coming of
[1:59:44] Christ because Christ said no one knew
[1:59:46] that he would return did you notice when
[1:59:48] the Jews asked him uh that no when we
[1:59:52] compared the scripture here Matthew 24
[1:59:54] six seal seven seal was left out do you
[1:59:58] also know that you know these Seven
[1:59:59] Seals which were in Revelations uh
[2:00:01] chapter 6 you know were also in Matthew
[2:00:05] chapter
[2:00:06] 24 okay they were opened there also okay
[2:00:09] was and the seventh seal again like I
[2:00:11] said it was a silence it was left out
[2:00:15] why was there silence in
[2:00:19] heaven okay what usually happens in
[2:00:22] heaven there's a lot of noise what kind
[2:00:26] of
[2:00:26] noise worship okay so for about the
[2:00:30] space of half an hour there was
[2:00:33] silence why is there silence because the
[2:00:36] object of
[2:00:38] worship is on
[2:00:41] Earth you see the coming of the Lord
[2:00:45] that is why there is silence absolute
[2:00:47] silence now the devil cannot deduce
[2:00:48] anything out of this because there is
[2:00:50] silence nobody's speaking anything about
[2:00:51] it
[2:00:52] okay and it says that when we compare
[2:00:55] the scripture here only God himself know
[2:00:58] not even the angels no wonder it wasn't
[2:01:00] even written so there is no way that you
[2:01:03] know anybody can know you see the hashid
[2:01:06] nothing taken place Angels don't know it
[2:01:08] nobody knows when he is
[2:01:12] coming but there will be there'll be a
[2:01:15] seven voices of these Thunders that will
[2:01:17] reveal the great revelation of that time
[2:01:20] so believers who if we don't know and if
[2:01:23] we if it won't be know till that time
[2:01:26] see he doesn't say that it will not be
[2:01:28] known he's he's saying that it will not
[2:01:31] be known till that
[2:01:33] time you see that till that time so as
[2:01:38] soon as that happens we will all get to
[2:01:42] know we will all in the sense the people
[2:01:44] who
[2:01:45] are gathered here under the cloud okay
[2:01:50] yeah and and uh yeah I think that is it
[2:01:54] so now we have to go
[2:02:00] to First
[2:02:03] seal para 338 I got it this time this is
[2:02:06] the right one
[2:02:10] yeah this is about
[2:02:15] America see there is so much of stuff in
[2:02:18] this Bible you know it is absolutely
[2:02:20] until unless we get into it this is not
[2:02:22] a church game you know churchianity
[2:02:24] cannot save us coming to church every
[2:02:26] Sunday and then Wednesday and then going
[2:02:28] back and leading Our Lives no look at
[2:02:31] this now now oh now I believe I was
[2:02:34] talking to somebody here I might have
[2:02:36] been brother Robertson today or somebody
[2:02:39] I was talking on about this but not this
[2:02:42] there but just on the same thing I
[2:02:45] believed I preached on there not long
[2:02:47] back ago what will happen to this United
[2:02:50] States on this money situation C well we
[2:02:55] are now paying our deths on taxes that
[2:02:58] will be paid 40 years from today that is
[2:03:01] how
[2:03:02] far we are behind did you ever turn on K
[2:03:06] A iir up there or Lifeline or listen to
[2:03:10] it see from Washington why all are
[2:03:13] completely
[2:03:15] busted that's
[2:03:17] all okay so this was in 1963
[2:03:21] America was already busted today their
[2:03:24] debt is at $ 36
[2:03:27] trillion and even given the current
[2:03:30] situation their economy is growing less
[2:03:33] than the debt which means they will
[2:03:35] never ever ever come out of debt okay so
[2:03:39] if you're looking at a bright future by
[2:03:42] investing and making money and all those
[2:03:44] things I think you need to B it say
[2:03:47] something else okay now you go to
[2:03:50] brother uh 300
[2:03:52] 50 there's a way out this is the problem
[2:03:54] actually this is the problem you see the
[2:03:58] problem is America is going bust now it
[2:04:00] is written here but what is happening in
[2:04:03] our time right now why do you think
[2:04:07] Trump wants to make Canada the 51st
[2:04:10] state
[2:04:12] why because of the oil
[2:04:15] resources
[2:04:17] yeah because he knows that somewhere
[2:04:20] down the line they don't have the
[2:04:23] money why are they putting tariffs on
[2:04:25] other
[2:04:28] countries Trump very cleverly says that
[2:04:30] we are imposing tariff on other
[2:04:32] countries but in reality what is he
[2:04:34] doing he's raising the taxes on the
[2:04:37] people because China is not going to pay
[2:04:40] the Tariff it is the American Consumer
[2:04:43] who's going to pay the Tariff so he's
[2:04:45] calling the tax as a tariff and he it
[2:04:49] seems like the other country is getting
[2:04:51] punished
[2:04:52] no it is his own people who are going to
[2:04:55] pay the heightened tax increased tax the
[2:04:57] tariffs will go out of the pocket the
[2:04:59] people who are purchasing those Samsung
[2:05:01] televisions or whatever they are buying
[2:05:03] okay now you see the only thing that you
[2:05:06] can do in this situation
[2:05:08] is 350 there is only one thing that can
[2:05:12] happen that is to call in the currency
[2:05:15] and pay off the
[2:05:17] bonds which is to say change the
[2:05:24] currency okay what does it say it says
[2:05:27] change the currency all right now he
[2:05:30] says and we can't do
[2:05:34] it okay believe me America cannot do it
[2:05:39] but you and me can do
[2:05:43] it how do you change the currency see
[2:05:46] the problem is given here the solution
[2:05:48] to the problem is also here it is just
[2:05:51] that that the people outside of this
[2:05:53] message cannot implement
[2:05:56] it see that is the importance of being
[2:05:58] in the
[2:05:59] message the world is saying or they're
[2:06:01] feeling that you know the economy is
[2:06:03] going down it'll come up and this will
[2:06:05] happen that will happen and you know
[2:06:07] this will but the fact here is that
[2:06:09] until unless our currency is
[2:06:13] changed okay until unless our currency
[2:06:16] is changed we are going into the
[2:06:19] tribulation no doubt about it you know
[2:06:22] all our savings are going to be wiped
[2:06:24] off fiat currency is going to be like
[2:06:28] paper what is backing it actually
[2:06:30] nothing
[2:06:31] today yeah so if you are still you know
[2:06:36] thinking that I will make a big business
[2:06:39] and then I will uh do this and I will
[2:06:42] invest in this and I will invest that I
[2:06:44] am not against investing you should do
[2:06:46] it and you know it's a part of life but
[2:06:49] what I'm saying is that we in this room
[2:06:53] are a different category of
[2:06:56] people you see I read somewhere that you
[2:06:59] know if you have like you know a million
[2:07:02] dollars in Canada you are better than
[2:07:03] about 80% of the
[2:07:05] Canadians yeah because less than 80% of
[2:07:08] the Canadians have $1 million in their
[2:07:10] savings okay so that's a drastic thing
[2:07:14] so if you have that amount of money you
[2:07:16] are one of the Elites in the country
[2:07:19] yeah in the same way if you know this
[2:07:22] secret changing of the
[2:07:25] currency okay if you know how you can
[2:07:28] change your
[2:07:30] currency the devil cannot touch
[2:07:34] you now coming to this point okay now
[2:07:37] how do you change the currency what is
[2:07:39] the new currency going to be right
[2:07:41] interesting I'll tell you I I'll tell
[2:07:44] you that is the reason why I'm here you
[2:07:46] know when a preacher comes here and you
[2:07:50] know has to preach brother bam said that
[2:07:53] if you don't have the Holy Ghost you
[2:07:55] might as well not you know step in the
[2:07:58] pulpit and you understand when the god
[2:08:03] when the Lord has to use you okay he
[2:08:07] does not teach
[2:08:09] like pen and paper okay take your notes
[2:08:12] no you know what he does he takes you he
[2:08:17] makes you go through it you understand
[2:08:21] the troubles the pain the sorrow the
[2:08:25] everything you know you have to go
[2:08:27] through it and once you you see John the
[2:08:29] Baptist almost all 30 years he spent in
[2:08:32] Wilderness his only job was to introduce
[2:08:35] the
[2:08:35] Messiah what is the preparation 30
[2:08:39] years yeah and 30 years in
[2:08:42] Wilderness he used to eat wild
[2:08:44] Grasshoppers and
[2:08:47] honey why because he had to recognize
[2:08:52] who the Messiah is and that is the
[2:08:55] preparation that went into that man and
[2:08:57] Jesus said this is the greatest of all
[2:09:00] not one Miracle but he was the
[2:09:03] greatest you see so that is why my
[2:09:06] brother my sister when I coming here and
[2:09:08] I'm talking to you I do not want you to
[2:09:12] miss the
[2:09:13] Rapture you've done a lot we we are just
[2:09:16] right about there okay just hold on
[2:09:21] just a little bit
[2:09:23] more okay and we will be
[2:09:26] home don't give up
[2:09:28] now you know the world is going to
[2:09:33] tribulation they are going to be
[2:09:35] lost you don't be a part of it okay now
[2:09:40] I will tell you how you can change your
[2:09:43] currency what is the new currency that
[2:09:46] you are going to use for that I'm not
[2:09:48] going to take the scripture because I
[2:09:49] hardly have 5 minutes but still
[2:09:52] forgive me if I cross a little bit I'm
[2:09:54] trying to keep myself within the time
[2:09:56] limit but how do you change your
[2:10:00] currency there was a time when Jesus was
[2:10:03] here okay and he met the Rich Young
[2:10:07] Ruler do you remember Rich Young Ruler
[2:10:11] or Young Rich ruler okay the Bible says
[2:10:13] about it he said oh Master what should I
[2:10:17] do to you know get eternal life and
[2:10:20] Jesus said very very simple sell
[2:10:22] everything that you have and follow
[2:10:24] me yeah sell everything that you have
[2:10:27] and just follow me come behind me you'll
[2:10:29] get eternal life before that he said a
[2:10:32] couple of other things also he said that
[2:10:33] you know you follow the Commandments you
[2:10:34] do this that and he said I've been doing
[2:10:36] that I still don't have eternal life I
[2:10:37] don't have the I don't not have the life
[2:10:39] that you have you know you have
[2:10:40] something special something different
[2:10:42] you know you speak and the dead raises
[2:10:43] up I don't have that so he said okay now
[2:10:46] you know what just doing the
[2:10:49] Commandments will not get get you
[2:10:51] eternal
[2:10:53] life yeah so when the Bible says we've
[2:10:57] had a lot of meetings on tithing and
[2:10:59] stuff so when the Bible says that uh we
[2:11:02] have to pay 10% of our income in TI okay
[2:11:07] and we do it we do it
[2:11:09] religiously okay now the point is after
[2:11:12] doing
[2:11:14] that are we still
[2:11:17] like Rich Young rulers I have been doing
[2:11:20] that since my childhood I've been paying
[2:11:22] my
[2:11:23] tithes but where is the
[2:11:26] life the life will come you see if I
[2:11:30] think it is zakus uh whose house Jesus
[2:11:34] went in and then you know he was like he
[2:11:36] opened his safe and he said that you
[2:11:39] know I have taken whatever I've taken
[2:11:40] was it zakus brother or yeah it was him
[2:11:44] right yeah so he said that you know
[2:11:46] whatever I have uh illegally have earned
[2:11:49] I'm giving four times of that
[2:11:51] okay now what and Jesus said that this
[2:11:55] day salvation has come in this house he
[2:11:58] was also a lost son of Abraham okay now
[2:12:01] what has happened what has transpired
[2:12:04] there zakus at that point in time he
[2:12:08] changed his currency that's right he
[2:12:11] took his faith out of the material money
[2:12:13] that he had okay and then he realized
[2:12:17] that you know what the complete Earth
[2:12:20] belongs to this man okay and I am air to
[2:12:24] him okay so I don't have to work for it
[2:12:28] I don't want I don't have to you know
[2:12:30] die for
[2:12:31] this my brother my sister once you
[2:12:34] realize that your currency is
[2:12:37] different you will be able to create
[2:12:42] money not make money you'll be able to
[2:12:45] create money what did Jesus do when they
[2:12:47] said when they came to him they said
[2:12:49] that you know where is the where is your
[2:12:51] tax he said Peter go catch a fish in the
[2:12:54] fish's mouth there will be a coin come
[2:12:56] bring it okay and he came there he
[2:13:00] brought the coin now uh Jesus says that
[2:13:04] okay whose face is on the coin it is
[2:13:06] Caesar's face so then Jesus said okay
[2:13:08] fine you do one thing you pay my tax and
[2:13:10] your tax also with this right
[2:13:14] so when I am telling you this see when
[2:13:17] we are talking about tithing okay please
[2:13:21] understand understand that 10% is what
[2:13:23] the law
[2:13:24] says okay you have to understand how did
[2:13:28] we come to this 10% or how do we come to
[2:13:30] the tithing Point itself in the first
[2:13:32] place if you
[2:13:34] see there is this uh King called Mali
[2:13:38] sedc okay Abraham went to rescue
[2:13:44] his nephew lot okay there were these
[2:13:48] Four Kings which overcame the five Kings
[2:13:50] and then you know they had a war and
[2:13:51] then you know this fellow went in there
[2:13:53] so Abraham was there he took
[2:13:57] 319 men with him okay and now he's going
[2:14:02] to war with people who have already won
[2:14:06] the war so the total cumulative number
[2:14:09] of Kings were
[2:14:11] nine four who had already overcome on
[2:14:14] the five and then you know so such a big
[2:14:17] Victorious Army he's going to fight and
[2:14:19] he's going there with
[2:14:21] 318 or 19 people okay when he reaches
[2:14:26] there Abraham knows
[2:14:30] impossible I
[2:14:33] cannot defeat these
[2:14:35] people how can I I have got you know 318
[2:14:40] or 19 people who are like cooker cooks
[2:14:42] and bearers and you know stuff in my
[2:14:44] house I've got all of them to fight with
[2:14:46] this big Mighty Army okay now okay
[2:14:50] whatever they can hold hold and stuff
[2:14:51] but it's not possible brother and sister
[2:14:55] this is exactly our
[2:14:57] condition we say that we work hard we
[2:15:01] make money I pay 10% of the money that I
[2:15:04] have earned to God as TI on the
[2:15:09] contrary God gives you
[2:15:13] 90% of what he has given you you're
[2:15:16] keeping it you understand that you're
[2:15:20] not giving God
[2:15:22] 10% you are keeping 90% of what God gave
[2:15:26] you please understand
[2:15:29] that you see so the moment this
[2:15:33] connection of yours with money when it
[2:15:36] goes your currency
[2:15:38] changes okay then you will realize that
[2:15:42] you're no longer praying that God give
[2:15:44] me a bigger house God give me a bigger
[2:15:46] car God give me a bigger suit God give
[2:15:49] me this God give me that please help me
[2:15:52] I'm in dire situation I don't have you
[2:15:54] know sometimes you have to understand
[2:15:56] when you're born again you know when you
[2:15:58] get the Holy Ghost you are a prisoner of
[2:16:01] Christ like I said okay can you imagine
[2:16:04] you being put in jail for whatever
[2:16:06] reason you're in jail now and you're
[2:16:08] sitting there and you're praying to God
[2:16:10] God please get me out of here get me out
[2:16:13] of here I don't want to be here okay now
[2:16:16] contrast that with our brother Paul
[2:16:21] H not that the Paul and Silas in the
[2:16:23] Bible actually yeah they are they were
[2:16:27] beaten up with rods they were stripped
[2:16:30] they were beaten with rods okay and they
[2:16:33] were put in the jail
[2:16:35] cell and sitting there what are they
[2:16:38] doing
[2:16:40] exactly they are not saying God please
[2:16:43] why this is coming to me I am such a
[2:16:45] holy person I am only preaching and then
[2:16:48] you know I'm going to jail please get me
[2:16:50] out of jail
[2:16:51] no Paul
[2:16:54] knows sometimes the troubles that we
[2:16:56] have in our life is because there is
[2:16:58] exactly what God wants at that point in
[2:17:01] time so that he can manifest his might
[2:17:03] through
[2:17:05] US yeah so every time we are stuck it is
[2:17:08] not
[2:17:09] because we are stuck when Israel is
[2:17:13] coming out of Egypt you know the 2
[2:17:16] million people coming out of Egypt they
[2:17:18] were walking and going and suddenly they
[2:17:20] come and they see
[2:17:21] Red
[2:17:23] Sea is this the is this the root that
[2:17:27] Moses chose for us there is sea in front
[2:17:30] and Pharaoh behind us what do we do
[2:17:34] Moses at least you should have seen
[2:17:36] Google
[2:17:37] Maps what is this now what do we do now
[2:17:42] there is no going back no going forward
[2:17:45] but that is they reached exactly the
[2:17:47] place where God wanted them to be
[2:17:51] Red Sea was a part of their
[2:17:54] Journey your troubles your problems are
[2:17:57] a part of your journey that will refine
[2:18:01] you once you do that you know Bible says
[2:18:05] David he killed a lion he killed a bear
[2:18:09] now he can kill
[2:18:11] anybody yeah golad is like a you know
[2:18:14] like a Barbie doll yeah because see goth
[2:18:18] has to still follow some rules of
[2:18:20] engagement bear has no rules of
[2:18:23] engagement Lions have no rules of
[2:18:25] engagement they see you and they just
[2:18:27] vacum and they eat you that's it but
[2:18:29] golat has got limitations you know he
[2:18:32] has to come with the stuff he has his
[2:18:34] this and he has his that and everything
[2:18:35] okay and you know he has rules that you
[2:18:39] know that he has to follow and you know
[2:18:41] he has limitations but these animals
[2:18:43] don't have a wild animals they don't
[2:18:44] have any limitations so for David when
[2:18:47] he saw him he's like you know this
[2:18:49] Barbie doll I can you know how is he
[2:18:53] challenging the armies of the Living God
[2:18:55] how can he do that yeah how can you do
[2:18:57] that not possible so your troubles at
[2:19:01] some point in time are preparing you for
[2:19:04] something
[2:19:05] bigger so now when You Face a trouble
[2:19:09] you don't pray to God to change God's
[2:19:13] mind yeah you pray to God that God
[2:19:17] changes your
[2:19:18] mind yeah so that you you know what to
[2:19:21] do in this
[2:19:22] situation yeah can you imagine Paul and
[2:19:25] Cena sitting there clapping and singing
[2:19:27] and doing all that you know and worship

[2:23:46] flight now and plus I'm going to get
[2:23:48] lunch at the airport also so thanks you
[2:23:51] know good that we in so you have to
[2:23:54] understand that we are not looking at a
[2:23:56] god of past not even a god of 63 you
[2:23:59] know God is the same yesterday today and
[2:24:01] forever you know you just you know we
[2:24:03] just need to have the faith that you
[2:24:06] know our brothers back there in the
[2:24:09] Bible you know in those times had and
[2:24:12] you will see that God is always ever
[2:24:16] faithful there is no battle you cannot
[2:24:18] win without you know
[2:24:21] worshipping yeah the worst kind of
[2:24:24] situation you are in just take out time
[2:24:27] start worshiping you know what happens
[2:24:29] actually you know actually what happens
[2:24:30] when you start
[2:24:32] worshipping you know what happens we
[2:24:35] just saw why did the worship stop in
[2:24:39] heaven because the object of worship was
[2:24:42] not there so when you start
[2:24:45] worshipping what
[2:24:47] happens comes right here
[2:24:51] with
[2:24:52] you in the fury
[2:24:54] furnace you see they said we put three
[2:24:58] in how come fourth is also there with
[2:25:01] them yeah so you see you have the power
[2:25:05] to move God that is why I again and
[2:25:08] again tell you that people in the
[2:25:10] message in this church are Elite you
[2:25:13] have got simply you've got the power to
[2:25:15] do so you can create money you can
[2:25:18] create anything that you need to at that
[2:25:19] point in time
[2:25:21] but with the new birth comes the
[2:25:23] maturity to understand that am I going
[2:25:25] to use all this power to just create
[2:25:28] wealth Paul you know didn't do it he
[2:25:31] said this is waste
[2:25:33] useless I have to gather up wealth there
[2:25:37] amen yeah the more souls I bring into
[2:25:39] Christ that is where you know I am going
[2:25:41] to be that is my eternal gift yeah so
[2:25:45] that is when you see please don't
[2:25:47] misunderstand me uh okay there is one
[2:25:49] more uh instance I want to say this uh
[2:25:53] woman at uh with Alicia she was
[2:25:57] absolutely down and gone she had no
[2:25:59] money nothing there was a femine in the
[2:26:02] uh land and last piece of bread she had
[2:26:05] little bit dough she's like we'll make
[2:26:07] this me and my daughter will eat it and
[2:26:09] then we will die yeah have you all read
[2:26:12] about that yeah now El Elisha comes
[2:26:16] there and he says no wait it's not time
[2:26:18] for you to die first you do one thing
[2:26:21] whatever you have B and give
[2:26:24] me and she's like me and my child okay
[2:26:27] at Thy word you said it okay fine she
[2:26:31] gave everything that she
[2:26:33] had okay and when she did that now you
[2:26:36] have to understand her faith is not in
[2:26:39] that bread or in that dough okay her
[2:26:42] currency has changed now she believes in
[2:26:47] the word which came through the prophet
[2:26:50] okay now she knows that I am standing on
[2:26:53] a different ground yeah I no longer
[2:26:56] bound to this
[2:26:58] currency okay I'm no longer bound to
[2:27:01] this food yeah this is not going to
[2:27:03] sustain me yeah so he doesn't want food
[2:27:07] from you you know God he's the owner of
[2:27:09] the universe why does he need your
[2:27:12] money you know I am I give 10% and then
[2:27:15] I go and ask what did you do with the
[2:27:17] 10% you know what is the statements what
[2:27:20] you know how this thing happened how
[2:27:22] that happened you know this that and all
[2:27:24] and okay every church is Sovereign you
[2:27:26] know we do all that but you know but in
[2:27:29] our minds you see a thinking man's
[2:27:32] filter the Holy Ghost will tell us that
[2:27:36] where we are actually
[2:27:37] standing you see the money that we give
[2:27:39] to Christ is his money alt together
[2:27:43] right and when we give it to him he
[2:27:45] multiplies and give it gives it back to
[2:27:47] us sometimes not just in cash you know
[2:27:50] if you read the story of sister hatti
[2:27:51] ride she makes $200 she gave 20 and then
[2:27:54] you know her two sons got eternal
[2:27:57] life how much can you value that in
[2:28:00] money yeah money today we have tomorrow
[2:28:03] we might not have tomorrow we might have
[2:28:05] lots so it keeps growing and you know
[2:28:08] reducing and coming and going but
[2:28:10] eternal life is
[2:28:12] forever yeah and that is where we are
[2:28:15] standing
[2:28:16] today that is why the changing of our
[2:28:19] currency is very very
[2:28:21] important without that there is no going
[2:28:24] forward the message has come in so that
[2:28:26] we know see the poor Young Rich ruler
[2:28:30] could not do it because he had too much
[2:28:32] wealth he could not you know he could
[2:28:34] not cut off from that
[2:28:36] wealth do you think God would really
[2:28:38] have taken his wealth and you know made
[2:28:40] him a whatever no look at Paul we speak
[2:28:46] about Rich Young Ruler but does anybody
[2:28:48] know his name
[2:28:51] but do we know
[2:28:53] Paul messenger of the first church age
[2:28:56] almost 2,000 years back still we know
[2:28:59] him
[2:29:01] yeah you see the difference when you cut
[2:29:05] yourself from that currency from that
[2:29:07] money where do you
[2:29:10] reach the name of Paul has become
[2:29:15] immortal not only now you know even 10
[2:29:18] Generations from now if there was time
[2:29:19] that you know Rapture delays people
[2:29:22] still will know
[2:29:24] Paul how about the Rich Young Ruler what
[2:29:27] has he gained what did he on at the end
[2:29:29] of the day you know you see if you read
[2:29:30] the scriptures he was in Hell ended up
[2:29:33] there no salvation no nothing not even
[2:29:36] money what what could he do with that
[2:29:39] money so that is why we have to
[2:29:42] understand that when we pay our tithes
[2:29:45] okay we are meeting with maled
[2:29:50] we are not giving it to the pastor we
[2:29:52] are not giving it to the church we are
[2:29:54] not helping the pastor we are not
[2:29:55] helping the church we are not helping
[2:29:57] anybody simply because we can't even
[2:29:59] help ourselves what am I going to help
[2:30:02] anybody else you see I am
[2:30:07] only working on my
[2:30:10] salvation I whatever I have has been
[2:30:13] given by God I acknowledge that yes sir
[2:30:16] right and my
[2:30:18] wealth is is not what I have earned here
[2:30:22] is not my lands my houses my you know
[2:30:25] cars and this is all perishable things
[2:30:28] that is why the Bible says it is
[2:30:30] impossible to please God without
[2:30:34] faith yeah so unless and until your
[2:30:37] currency changes you will you know you
[2:30:41] cannot please God
[2:30:43] secondly the economy is going to go down
[2:30:45] any which ways you run around in any
[2:30:48] direction you know you cannot nobody can
[2:30:51] save the economy it is gone it is thus
[2:30:54] sayth the Lord Seven seal we read it
[2:30:57] it's
[2:30:58] gone so I have a disclaimer here now I
[2:31:03] am not asking you to sell everything
[2:31:05] that you have and donate and do all that
[2:31:08] no that is not what I'm saying and
[2:31:11] especially the children like you know I
[2:31:12] said also that you know you become a
[2:31:14] prisoner of Christ when you receive the
[2:31:16] Holy Ghost now I'm not saying that you
[2:31:18] know you become the prisoner of Christ
[2:31:19] from tomorrow words you're not going to
[2:31:20] school you're not doing your work you're
[2:31:22] not going to you know do all those
[2:31:24] things no that's not what I'm saying
[2:31:27] what I'm saying is very clear I want to
[2:31:30] reemphasize on that that you know like
[2:31:32] for example we have got Isaac here or
[2:31:36] Benjamin here okay now they are
[2:31:38] schoolgoing
[2:31:40] kids now when they get the Holy Ghost
[2:31:44] okay when they go to their
[2:31:46] school that is the only percentage of
[2:31:50] scripture the people in that school the
[2:31:53] principals teachers students will ever
[2:31:55] get to interact with the word right so
[2:31:58] it is important that I do my daily work
[2:32:01] God gives me a
[2:32:03] Target my car breaks down I go I meet a
[2:32:06] mechanic who's going to fix it and uh
[2:32:08] you know and he helps me and you know he
[2:32:09] does all the things this is the only
[2:32:12] time that mechanic has an opportunity to
[2:32:15] interact with the word in
[2:32:18] flesh so this is not about you you
[2:32:22] cannot say I am saved so now I'm putting
[2:32:24] my blanket on and I'm just not going to
[2:32:26] do anything because I'm saved I am I am
[2:32:28] in rest Holy Ghost gives you rest from
[2:32:31] your works but then you do the works of
[2:32:35] Christ you're not resting like you know
[2:32:39] resting yeah children you have to study
[2:32:43] you have to go to school you have to do
[2:32:45] all your responsibilities that you are
[2:32:46] doing but while you're doing that make
[2:32:49] sure and understand that you are the
[2:32:51] living Epistles of
[2:32:53] Christ when you find your position in
[2:32:56] Christ okay that scripture is living
[2:32:58] inside of you now you don't have to go
[2:33:01] and you know take out the Bible on the
[2:33:03] street and scream like you know this is
[2:33:06] uh you know Isaiah chapter 38 says this
[2:33:09] says this no you are Isaiah 38 standing
[2:33:13] there you are the
[2:33:15] scripture for the age word in flesh yes
[2:33:21] and when you go anywhere wherever you
[2:33:25] have the complete authority of Heaven
[2:33:27] behind
[2:33:28] you so there will be people who will
[2:33:30] help you there will be people who
[2:33:32] trouble you but they're not doing it to
[2:33:34] you they are doing it to the
[2:33:36] word so on the white Throne judgment
[2:33:39] you're not just sitting there nothing to
[2:33:41] do you have all these people you have
[2:33:44] interacted with yeah you're not sitting
[2:33:47] there and watching like you know okay H
[2:33:49] yeah yeah
[2:33:50] you are sitting there to judge these
[2:33:52] people give them eternal
[2:33:54] life or
[2:33:57] sorry yeah because the main thing is you
[2:34:01] know life is in
[2:34:04] identifying Abraham you have to
[2:34:07] understand when whatever shape form
[2:34:10] color what however God comes in front of
[2:34:12] Abraham he will always identify
[2:34:15] him lot could not do it Abraham saw that
[2:34:20] you know three people coming he did not
[2:34:23] go and say my
[2:34:25] lords he said my Lord why did he say my
[2:34:30] Lord because he had already met
[2:34:36] him during that
[2:34:38] battle yeah he had already met him there
[2:34:42] so now he knows that the one who changed
[2:34:44] my name is the this is the
[2:34:47] one you change your form and come any
[2:34:50] form you come in I will definitely get
[2:34:53] you you see and that is why Jesus said
[2:34:56] he was also a child of Abraham why
[2:34:58] because Abraham could identify
[2:35:01] Christ and the children of Abraham will
[2:35:03] also identify Christ you see when
[2:35:06] brother bar you know when he preaching
[2:35:07] here quite often it happens that you
[2:35:09] know like I did today exceeded the time
[2:35:12] you know he says that you know brothers
[2:35:14] sisters whoever wants to go can go we
[2:35:17] won't feel bad you have the time you
[2:35:18] know you you can do that uh it's okay we
[2:35:21] understand you have problems when you
[2:35:23] when you hear that you know you you just
[2:35:26] get to know that you know what this is
[2:35:29] Elijah he is telling uh Elisha you T
[2:35:33] here let me go he's like no no no no no
[2:35:36] no I am not going to let you go I am
[2:35:39] going to be right here I'm going to be
[2:35:41] right here this is my place you see so
[2:35:44] that's why you have to understand that
[2:35:46] you know the quality of God is I could
[2:35:49] couldn't read it but the seventh seal
[2:35:51] has got three fold on it the first fold
[2:35:55] you if you can read CMO that is Christ
[2:35:57] The Mystery of God revealed the message
[2:35:59] okay three folds of the seven seal first
[2:36:02] is whatever was in God was poured into
[2:36:07] Christ second whatever was in Christ was
[2:36:10] poured into the bride okay now whatever
[2:36:16] now the third part is whatever
[2:36:20] I wouldn't say whatever is in the bride
[2:36:21] but it is the restoration of the earth
[2:36:25] okay that is the third fold that is the
[2:36:26] third reason for the seven seal coming
[2:36:28] of the Lord okay now in a passing
[2:36:31] reference quickly I will say that you
[2:36:33] have to when you see when you read the
[2:36:34] Bible whatever happens to the
[2:36:37] Earth happens to our flesh yeah you
[2:36:42] understand that 70% of the Earth is
[2:36:44] water 70% of our body is
[2:36:49] yeah right and 30% is the flesh part or
[2:36:53] the solid part okay that is how the
[2:36:56] Earth is now you have to understand the
[2:36:58] coming of the Lord did happen on 208th
[2:37:01] February
[2:37:03] 1963 okay the mighty angel came down one
[2:37:06] foot on sea one foot on
[2:37:09] land okay that was the coming of the
[2:37:12] Lord but you also have to understand
[2:37:15] that God deals with Jews as a nation but
[2:37:19] God deals with Gentiles as
[2:37:22] individuals so that Mighty Angel has to
[2:37:26] come down in this flesh
[2:37:28] also yeah you see whatever minerals you
[2:37:31] find in the earth you have got same
[2:37:33] things in your body magnesium potassium
[2:37:36] iron you know I don't know all those but
[2:37:39] yeah all everything is in your flesh as
[2:37:41] well yeah in the new heavens and new
[2:37:44] earth you will see that there is no
[2:37:46] ocean yeah there is no Ocean or no Seas
[2:37:49] I I didn't find any Seas yeah when we
[2:37:52] get into a theophany there will be no
[2:37:55] flesh and blood and all in that okay so
[2:37:58] whatever happens in the Bible whatever
[2:38:00] happens to this earth renovation of the
[2:38:03] earth and all that you know happens to
[2:38:05] our body first so it's kind of a parable
[2:38:09] when God said in the Garden of Eden Adam
[2:38:11] because of you the Earth is
[2:38:12] cursed are this flesh was taken out of
[2:38:15] this Earth and thorns and thistles will
[2:38:18] the earth bring forth
[2:38:20] you know sickness and problems in our
[2:38:22] flesh yeah this will go away when that
[2:38:25] will go away yeah so that is the reason
[2:38:29] why the third fold of the seven seal is
[2:38:31] waiting that is the uh the nature is
[2:38:35] yearning for the coming of the sons of
[2:38:38] God I don't remember the exact scripture
[2:38:39] does anybody
[2:38:41] remember manifestation of the yeah
[2:38:43] exactly okay so that is why the nature
[2:38:45] is groaning yeah groaning is the right
[2:38:47] word it's groaning for the Manifest
[2:38:49] ations of the sons of God why because
[2:38:52] when our body gets
[2:38:54] redeemed the Earth is also going to get
[2:38:57] redeemed yeah because our because of our
[2:39:00] fault the Earth got all these problems
[2:39:04] yeah so uh yeah just 2 minutes
[2:39:10] more so now I
[2:39:13] hope we
[2:39:15] have covered many things time was very
[2:39:18] short I experienc by about 20 minutes
[2:39:20] but
[2:39:22] still I want to end with one thing that
[2:39:24] I want to say my brother my
[2:39:28] sister don't lose this opportunity right
[2:39:31] you know this is one important time that
[2:39:34] you are living in prophets like Daniel
[2:39:38] wanted to be here today they wanted to
[2:39:41] see this they were not given this
[2:39:44] opportunity it is only us that has been
[2:39:46] given this opportunity so please make
[2:39:50] maximum use of it and we've already
[2:39:53] reached the
[2:39:55] end just a little bit more just a little
[2:39:58] bit more push
[2:40:00] on push on yeah and for some get back in
[2:40:05] line keep back in line know that the
[2:40:10] Lord is here yes
[2:40:13] yeah he wants to speak to you you know
[2:40:17] like I said it is not easy
[2:40:21] all you need to do is just
[2:40:24] believe change your
[2:40:26] currency rapturing faith is lying right
[2:40:29] in front of you yeah it's lying right in
[2:40:32] front of you go ahead receive the Holy
[2:40:35] Ghost and if you have the Holy Ghost go
[2:40:38] for the refilling ask God again and
[2:40:40] again yeah
[2:40:43] and although I just want to end with one
[2:40:47] small example of what happened with me
[2:40:49] one time and I'm going to close with
[2:40:53] that only to know you know the position
[2:40:56] that we are in what happened was once I
[2:40:58] was in once again South India I was
[2:41:00] going to uh Delhi and I was uh supposed
[2:41:04] to catch a train now this in Delhi uh in
[2:41:08] the church I was doing the live
[2:41:10] streaming and all those things so uh
[2:41:12] this was watch Night Service 31st
[2:41:15] December in the night we have Holy
[2:41:16] Communion and we have this watch Night
[2:41:18] Service so I had to be there for the
[2:41:20] watch Night Service but incidentally I
[2:41:22] was very far away from Delhi so uh I was
[2:41:27] trying to catch a
[2:41:28] train from Gujarat I had come all the
[2:41:31] way there now when I was in Ahmedabad
[2:41:33] that is the capital of Gujarat one
[2:41:35] city uh I got the train I I I got the
[2:41:38] train but then uh the ticket examiner
[2:41:40] there I had to pay for the ticket and he
[2:41:42] said that you know usually in in India
[2:41:45] we pay with you know tap thing you know
[2:41:48] PTM and all so we don't usually use cash
[2:41:51] I got in the Train the TT said the the
[2:41:54] person who issues the ticket said that
[2:41:55] you know I cannot take uh this thing
[2:41:57] from you I need cash I said I don't have
[2:41:59] cash but I have to get this train
[2:42:01] because if I miss this train I will the
[2:42:03] journey is like 12 hours You by train so
[2:42:07] I will not be able to make it for the
[2:42:08] meeting tomorrow so I cannot miss this
[2:42:11] train by any cost at any cost so he said
[2:42:13] you know you still have time why don't
[2:42:14] you go to the gate and get there's a ATM
[2:42:16] there withdraw money and come back and
[2:42:18] you know get it I was like okay fine
[2:42:20] I'll do that I went to the gate of the
[2:42:22] Railway Station to get the uh money from
[2:42:25] the ATM I got the money from the ATM and
[2:42:28] I came back I Vis at the station at the
[2:42:30] platform and the train had started
[2:42:32] moving I started running and the train
[2:42:35] you will see it's a huge you know very
[2:42:38] very big train you know even if it moves
[2:42:40] like this you don't realize that it is
[2:42:41] so fast because it's such a huge thing
[2:42:44] you know it's got like 20 Bogies on it
[2:42:45] or something like that and it is going
[2:42:47] at maybe 10 or 15 km/ hour maximum 20
[2:42:51] I'm I'm looking at it it is right here
[2:42:53] where this chair is I thought I can just
[2:42:55] get in you know I I'm running I'm
[2:42:57] running I'm running I'm running really
[2:42:58] fast I am not able to even come close to
[2:43:01] it but the train is still at the same
[2:43:03] speed I'm trying to get get onto it no I
[2:43:06] could not and incidentally the last
[2:43:09] bogie of the train has got x on it okay
[2:43:12] so that the station Master can know that
[2:43:15] you know all the Bogies have made it and
[2:43:16] this is the last one so they have a x
[2:43:19] you know drawn on it this x is right in
[2:43:21] front of my eyes I am trying to get on
[2:43:23] it I'm trying to reach there I'm trying
[2:43:24] to go there you see yeah that is a
[2:43:26] picture you see and I'm not able to get
[2:43:29] it that X is right here it is within the
[2:43:31] hands reach but I'm not able to reach it
[2:43:33] and I'm running and I'm running and I'm
[2:43:35] running and every part of my body is
[2:43:37] just I have to get that train because if
[2:43:39] I miss that train I miss the you know uh
[2:43:43] the watch Night Service I miss Holy
[2:43:44] Communion on the first I miss everything
[2:43:47] I cannot let this train go this train
[2:43:48] has to you know I have to get on that
[2:43:50] train and the train is not stopping and
[2:43:53] I'm running running running really hard
[2:43:55] I'm running I can't breathe I'm I'm
[2:43:57] still running I'm not stopping and
[2:43:59] finally I realized that you know I'm not
[2:44:01] going to get it so incidentally this is
[2:44:03] the first time I was at this station and
[2:44:05] I saw that this platform is right next
[2:44:08] to the road so I just quickly ran uh you
[2:44:11] know the train is going like this I went
[2:44:14] down you know from the platform and
[2:44:16] there was a autoa standing there
[2:44:19] now I I jumped into the auto and I said
[2:44:21] you know come on follow the train follow
[2:44:22] the train he he said this is auto
[2:44:26] man you you you can't you can't catch a
[2:44:29] train with this I said today your auto
[2:44:31] can fly you just go don't stop just go
[2:44:33] go go go go and he was like okay fine
[2:44:35] where do I go I said follow the train he
[2:44:37] said the train is going to another city
[2:44:38] we cannot go in this to another city I
[2:44:40] said wherever it is going you just go
[2:44:43] and you know he started driving and but
[2:44:46] see if you have a picture of the autoa
[2:44:47] in that I I had Tred to take it okay and
[2:44:51] the and it will not go because it's it's
[2:44:54] just a Traw you know it is just a you
[2:44:56] know like a water pump you attach to a
[2:44:58] cycle that is the kind of energy that
[2:45:00] you know thing has but I was like you
[2:45:02] know this train cannot I have to catch
[2:45:04] this train and I have to be there there
[2:45:06] is no way this train can go whatever
[2:45:08] happens I will get and I you know this
[2:45:12] Auto is going and it is not reaching
[2:45:14] anywhere but then suddenly what happened
[2:45:15] this train left the platform it cleared
[2:45:18] the platform and it changed a couple of
[2:45:20] tracks around say five six tracks on the
[2:45:23] other end the train is going to turn
[2:45:24] that side now my auto is going this side
[2:45:26] so and suddenly there the train
[2:45:29] stopped and I'm like you know okay fine
[2:45:31] I I saw the train stop I took the money
[2:45:33] I threw it you know in the auto I
[2:45:35] couldn't have I I couldn't say bye or
[2:45:37] anything to the auto guy I just jumped
[2:45:38] out leaped out ran and got into the
[2:45:40] train and when I got into the Train the
[2:45:42] train started
[2:45:45] moving you know so that is what I'm
[2:45:47] saying you have the power of Creation in
[2:45:52] you the reason why I am telling you
