[0:00] Poems called made manifest.
[0:02] Creation waits with groaning voice. The
[0:06] earth in birth pain cries
[0:09] for suns to rise with spoken word and
[0:13] open blinded eyes. Not future hope but
[0:17] present hour.
[0:20] The bride takes up her stand. With
[0:23] perfect word and spirit fool, she rules
[0:26] at his command.
[0:28] Hear the testimonies of the end time
[0:30] hour where mystery meets the plane where
[0:33] sons of God arise in strength
[0:37] and Christ is seen again. No longer
[0:40] shadows, types or hints, no fragments
[0:43] left to find. The perfect word, the
[0:46] spirit's flame,
[0:48] &gt;&gt; hath come to claim mankind.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; They do not walk in borrowed light, nor
[0:54] live by serpent's design. The fullness
[0:57] of the spoken word now pulses through
[1:00] their spine. The seed of God within
[1:03] their soul ignite it with holy fire.
[1:06] Not just the longing of the heart, but
[1:10] power to fulfill desire. Each morning
[1:13] when the sun peaks up and breaks the
[1:16] night's retreat, the children of God
[1:19] awake in faith and stand upon their
[1:22] feet. They seized the flesh, this
[1:26] stubborn man,
[1:27] &gt;&gt; and cast him to the floor.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; Submit, O body, to the word, and serve
[1:32] the Lord once more.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; This power is not from mortal flame, nor
[1:38] courage of the brave. It's by the spirit
[1:41] of the lamb who left an empty grave.
[1:45] The very Christ now living in flesh. The
[1:48] mystery long concealed unveiled in sons
[1:51] and daughters here in Calgary.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; In Calgary,
[1:56] &gt;&gt; his glory now revealed.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; No chain of lust, no fear of death, no
[2:01] unbelief can remain.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; For liberty has crowned their walk and
[2:06] circumcised Satan's shame. They tread
[2:09] this world
[2:12] with pre-ordained steps. Their hearts
[2:14] the temple bright, their very bodies
[2:17] testifying of God's eternal light.
[2:21] Hear the prophesying, oh saints of God.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; The prophecy come true. The same great
[2:26] life that conquered sin
[2:29] &gt;&gt; is now living in you.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; Not just the wish,
[2:33] but ability to act. The victory's
[2:37] already won. The glorious body made
[2:39] manifest. today, united with the sun.
[2:44] This is really what I want to remind
[2:45] you. As you walk these blackened streets
[2:49] and labor through the darkest of days,
[2:51] you carry heaven in your steps, the word
[2:54] your staff and stay. For now the bride
[2:57] is one with him, the mystery complete,
[3:00] the throne of God was in your soul, and
[3:03] the world beneath your feet. Lord bless
[3:05] you all.
[3:07] [Applause]
