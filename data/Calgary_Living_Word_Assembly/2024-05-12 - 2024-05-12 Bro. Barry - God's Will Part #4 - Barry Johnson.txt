this morning maybe just make it known unto the Lord by way of an uplift hand we just have one request that I wanted to mention that is uh for Dawn Whitley she's a a woman who has helped us over the years many times with our children as a babysitter and just has become a real good friend of our family and she's found herself in the hospital and the doctors don't know why they've ran all the Tas and they have confirmed she doesn't have cancer she's clear of that but she's lost a lot of blood and she just they don't know where it's gone so let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness your Tender Mercies to us Lord thank you Father that we all have mothers that we can look to who we know have sacrificed of their lives Lord Jesus that we could be here today and Lord not that we could just be here we know that many different people can just have children but it takes a real special person to be a mother to have the Heart Lord to nourish and to protect and to be concerned and to lead and guide and to correct father we thank you for each and every mother and potential mother Lord and we pray that you would just bless them abundantly today Father and and over the course of the next year Lord Jesus let the blessings never stop for our mothers Lord father we thank you for your goodness and your mercy to us today we just want to remember Don Whitley father who's in the hospital Lord she's in need of a touch from you father and what a blessing it is to be able to have a conversation with her to to tell her even though the doctors don't know what's going on we can go to the great physician we can have prayer for you and for her to receive it Lord we pray that you would just bless her abundantly that you would her body Lord that she would be able to come to know you in the power of your Resurrection in a way like she has never known before Lord Jesus father we pray that you would just touch every hand Lord Jesus every heart that made known unto you this morning a need in their lives Lord and maybe those who didn't even make the effort to show you Lord you know their hearts and father we pray that you would just touch their hearts Lord each and every one of us father we have needs in our lives and we thank you for meeting them Lord we pray Lord Jesus for Lord those who are maybe shut in who can't get out Lord who would love to be in service but just can't make it father we pray that you would be with them wherever they are whatever they're doing Lord and father we just want to remember all those loved ones that we've mentioned in the past Lord Jesus we pray that you would just Reach Out And Touch them Father according to your word Lord Jesus we love you and we thank you we just want to commit each life into your hands now as we go forward Wards in this service we pray that we could all get out of the way Lord Jesus and just allow you to be the speaker Lord and allow you to be the hearer father Lord Jesus we just love you and we thank you we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians certainly thankful to be here was that me that was loud I don't know some fell or if that was sound either way you happy this morning I just want to carry on with our our uh study on Joseph thank you musicians um let's start reading with uh Second Timothy chapter 3 and then I'd like to turn over to Genesis Genesis chapter 45 2 Timothy 3: 11 persecu tions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch and at laconium at lra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered Meen yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution let's turn over to Genesis chapter 45 we're going to Lord willing conclude the uh the brief study about Joseph today Genesis chter 45 just the first verse then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and and there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his Brethren let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and your mercy to us we thank you for the revelation of your word the day in which we live Lord because we know it's not just what's on a book or a tape but it's truly you the heavenly father ministering to us Lord breaking this bread of life open to us fresh father we pray that you would just speak to us Sly once again today and we'll be careful to give you all the praise in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated certainly thankful for all the visitors here God bless you all I trust you feel right at home certainly uh wonderful to see The Smiling Faces here am God bless you brother Steven and sister Judith certainly good to see you back amen and uh yeah as we said Happy Mother's Day um just a couple announcements we've got uh Men's breakfast coming up I believe next weekend that's going to be at our place just a little time of Fellowship around the word for just the brethren we got a communion service coming up on the 26th and we'll be hosting that at 5:30 p.m. so we can hopefully get everybody out of here at a at a decent time we have brother Dela at delodon he's going going to be here June the 2nd and uh we have brother Jack Duff here on July the 12th and we're trying to fit brother Cadre Diggs in here he's going to be in Grand Prairie but I don't think it's going to work he wanted to come the weekend after uh the week after July 12th but that's uh already taken with brother Jack Duff so I don't know maybe he can come a little bit later we'll see we may see brother kre Diggs here um in July so uh God bless you this morning Amen in our scripture today we were just uh carrying on with the study in God's Will and understanding that you know even though we have a destination that we're all heading towards that we're pressing towards that that Mark that prize of the High Calling of of God in Christ Jesus that's our desire to to go there to go to heaven to go go to our Eternal destination the only place where there is eternal life we've talked about it in the past there's no eternal hell there is a a time and a space where hell will burn and that's one of the biggest tricks of the devil isn't it today to make people believe that there's no God there's no devil there's no Heaven there's no hell you can just do whatever you want anything goes it's just fine that's the biggest trick of deception of the devil there is a place that is burning with fire with unquenchable fire and there is a place that that is actually the best place that we could ever even imagine we can can't even imagine the place and and one of those two places is going to be our destination but only one of them is an eternal destination because God's life is the only thing that's Eternal but don't think for a second that one day we could just say well maybe I could just eat and drink and be merry for tomorrow I die it doesn't matter whether I serve God or not because it's only going to be a limited amount of time one moment of that time in that suffering will not be worth it not one moment so we want to make sure that we're pressing towards that Mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and I believe that's why we've all gathered here today certainly thankful for the will of God in our lives and to know that you know we are going to suffer we we read it that all who live Godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution but also make no mistake about it those people who don't actually live Godly in Christ Jesus suffer persec ution the only difference is there's no protection for those people it's a freef fall the devil can do whatever he wants to them but the Sons and Daughters of God they are the ones whose Angels God's angels are encamped about them all those who fear Him you know on 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 I just think uh in the will of God talking about the life of Joseph for those people who weren't here for this study this is part four of uh of what we were talking about Joseph and understanding that God's will is not necessarily exactly just a destination even though it is we know brother bradam teaches taught that every scripture has a compound meaning and Revelation so we can read a scripture today and then God can reveal something to us tomorrow that we didn't see today and it's a wonderful thing because that's what Revelation is all about but you know it just became so clear to me once upon a time God showed me this this this I'll say idea or this this theory that brother bradam brought that God's will is his word and I had talked to my pastor many times about God's will for my life because that's what my dad encouraged me to do when I was young and the Pastor said to me God's will is his word and so it took me a long time to actually catch a revelation from God directly about that and and when I caught that Revelation it wasn't just something that I could just maybe and I don't mean this to sound the wrong way brother dawn but it wasn't just something poetic that came out of the air and I said wow this is a revelation from God it was something that God spoke directly to my heart but then I I heard him say it in my heart you want a scripture for that don't you and the first part of it was take a look at Joseph's life Joseph the one whose brothers persecuted him he was a dreamer we know the story very well he dreamed dreams and he told his brothers about it how my sheep was in the middle and all of your sheep while we were harvesting in the field your sheep bowed down in obedience to my chief and of course all the brothers they were like really this guy the one who's loved by the parents more than anyone we know we talked about the mothers we talked about the handmaids we talked about all the Brethren but they were all part of the same family they had the same father and so the brothers hated him because he was loved more by his daddy than everyone else in the family and so Joseph suffered persecution just for being Joseph he didn't do anything and he was persecuted and uh so anyway way it was just just a wonderful Story the way the Lord has led this and given me the ability to see that you know the important thing to recognize I believe we're going to go to heaven when we're saved we're saved we're going to go to heaven when you believe you're sealed brother bam says it you're you're you're not really saved until you're sealed with the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters sorry to break that to us but that's what the prophet teaches we are not converted until we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when we get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives it's not just today and then tomorrow we can trip up and fall we could slip back into our old ways and lose the Holy Ghost in our lives that doesn't happen once you are sealed you're sealed till the day of your Redemption you don't need to fear you don't need to worry you are in your promised land and that is the Holy Ghost that's Christ Jesus himself not some scary ghost that's going to come floating into your life and floating out of your life this is the person of Jesus Christ he is identifiable by the life that's lived and that life that's lived is going to be exactly according to his word it's not going to be a spin on it someone else's interpretation it'll be exactly according to the word of God that was delivered through a Vindicated prophet in our age so there's no mixing it up and saying well I believe this way and and maybe I was taught that way that's that's that's not acceptable we're not going to be able to go and stand before God and say well that was what I was taught but did you hear the voice of the Vindicated prophet and if you did hear the voice of the Vindicated Prophet then did you choose to accept it entirely or maybe just reject portion of it we know that Eve she heard the voice of her husband and she chose to reject just one word and what did that do that caused the fall of mankind we know that I don't want to go too far with that but talking about the will of God and Joseph and and how I got to this conclusion how the Lord showed me this every single step of the way in Joseph's life he did not get angry with God he did not stop serving God because of the circumstances and you know if anybody had reason to get upset and maybe take his his things and go home Joseph did Where's God the brothers hate me just for being me even when he explained the second dream to his parents and brothers even his dad said you need to stop doing that you're actually going to say that Mom and I are going to Bow Down and Worship You are you kidding but we know the word of God says his dad took note of that and then his brothers hated him even more because of it it's interesting how God works works and you know he's in control of every single thing there's not one thing that's out of his control there's not one thing that's happening that's just temporarily out of his control everything is working towards God's will amen the footsteps of the righteous are what order of the Lord there's nobody acting in this world without God allowing it but you know I just couldn't help but think today I'm I'm going to go on a little bit of a rabbit hole and I think it's good sometimes what came to my heart actually was it's the Honeypot we're going to get into something here and it's just so good and you know the will of God whatever God's will is for our lives brothers and sisters it's not necessarily just the destination I've been saying this over and over again it's it's actually the journey amen God bless you Sister Rebecca it's good to see your face again she's been in Nigeria for a long time it's wonderful to realize that we can make the journey good or bad and we can make the journey good or bad not just for us but for others and what do we want to do do we want to make the journey bad for others sometimes we want to do that we want other people to live in our suffering we know we've heard the saying many times misery loves company and doesn't it doesn't it you know I'm saying this because I lived it I lived it for my life for a while for many years in my life I complained about my parents my parents weren't the way that I thought they should be my mother wasn't the way that I thought she should be my daddy wasn't the way that I thought he should be but you know what I came to the place one time where I was no longer looking at them the way I thought they should be they are who they are but now what am I going to do about it am I going to go and tell everybody what I think they should be some people live their whole lives doing that expecting other people to be different than they are and then getting angry at them when they don't become who they think they should be what way is that to to live why not just accept people for who they are and say God bless you because I know that God is working out his perfect will in your life just like he's working it out in mine but you know what I want to talk about today was the the honey pot so to speak and I don't mean that in a derogatory way I mean it like a barrel a bucket of honey where brother bradam talks about the the Bears in the tent and how they got into the honey tells it one time with honey and he tells it another time with molasses call it whatever your favorite bucket is that's what I want to talk about today and the will of God and how in everything 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 18 says in everything give thanks in everything give thanks not only sometimes not only most times not when I feel good or or when I'm on the Mountaintop experience not when I get a big bonus paycheck and not when uh maybe everything's going good in my life life but when I'm down in the pit because my brothers hate me for no reason when they take me and sell me into slavery I'm betrayed give thanks give thanks why for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you amen so for me I had to go and make that leap I had to change my life and recognize you know what these people are who they are why would I get mad because they're they're they're not who I think should be that's foolish what I need to do is get on with living in my own life and make the best of it because that's what I've been given and you know that was even before I got saved but I know that was God working in my heart giving me the ability to take another step up the stairs towards him and that's what we're doing we're on a journey are we going to mope our way to heaven that's not going to happen it's a wonderful thing amen you know uh just talking about all of this I'm going to read a quotee out of the the the mark of the beast 1956 brother bradam in uh paragraph 43 he says was Christ in Joseph why he portrayed portrayed Christ just perfectly born loved of his father hated of his brother sold for practically 30 pieces of silver put in a ditch supposingly to be dead taken up sitting on the right hand of pharaoh the greatest nation in the world when he went forth they bowed the knee Joseph is approaching perfect type of Christ how his Brethren was made known to him how they wept and said this is our sin and how that was portrayed letter by letter of Christ there came a time and there's coming a time where the Brethren will say how how H how did you get those wounds that are in your hand and what's going to happen he's going to say I got them in the house of my the people who I thought were my friends my brethren those tribes of Israel those ones but we know remember we actually looked at the genealogy and they weren't all loved they were just all there I'll just say it that way there was only one that was loved and that was Rachel and I think it's just a beautiful thing we know though the the Paradox is is that the tribe of Judah which is the lineage of Christ comes through Leah how do you explain that it's incredible but it's true amen you would think it would be coming through Rachel but not so but you know in uh we'll just do a quick little recap sort of as we go and then uh then we'll get into it and really what I want to what I got into myself this is what I thought was so sweet was you know give thanks brothers and sisters give thanks amen give thanks you want to change a circumstance in your life give thanks when you're going to have a meal give thanks but when you get up in the morning give thanks when you get to go to church give thanks when you get to go to work give thanks when you get to pay your bills give thanks God is actually providing for us in chapter 39 of Genesis you know talking about Joseph he was brought down into Egypt he was already sold betrayed by his brothers he was brought down into Egypt and and we know that he he was faced with being loved above all of his Brethren and and with his dreams but he was taken down into Egypt because of it they couldn't stand him they hated him for it but we know in verse two of chapter 39 it says and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and the ma his master saw that the Lord was with him and you know as I was going through this study I just want to encourage us I'm going to try and go quickly here but I just want to hit some high points here how many people in the world how many of our bosses can see that the Lord Is With Us brothers and sisters our masters our teachers our parents our husbands our wives how many people the neighbors can see that the Lord is with us and you know what happens Joseph he found Grace in his sight and what did he do he s served him he didn't regret going to to to be there with him God was with him and he knew it he served him you know in uh I just think it's beautiful thing in uh in uh sorry I just got a little a little uh turned around in Genesis Chapter 30 just going to read Genesis Chapter 30 verse 22 I might have got a little bit ahead of myself forgive me Genesis 30 verse 2 22 to 25 talking about his mom Joseph's mom and God remembered Rachel and God hearkened to her and opened her womb and she conceived and bear a son and said God hath taken away my reproach and she called his name Joseph and said the Lord shall add to me another son and it came to pass When Rachel had born Joseph that Jacob said unto laan send me away that I might go into my own place and into my own country and we know the story from there how all of the events were orchestrated to bring this to pass God was with them all of the way even though he was he was deceived into to take in Leah as a wife and all of that we we know about that I did jump ahead and I apologize but you know Joseph was 17 years old when uh when his story really began we talked about all of that I apologize but uh he was taught by his parents this is what I wanted to get into and uh I just think it's so beautiful because we need to teach our children this to give thanks yes we need to understand that all of our Lives all of our footsteps are ordered of the Lord and that is the will of God it's not just happen chance it's not just accidental you know it's just wonderful isn't it can you think about how Joseph must have felt we're going to get into this I'm jumping ahead but how did Joseph feel when he knew that his Brethren were standing before him brother brandham says it in one of the quotes I don't even know if I have it today but he said that Joseph didn't even know what he was doing he was just being Joseph he was just living his life and found himself ascending to the right hand of pharaoh to the place where we read the quote this morning where nothing happened unless they bowed the knee to Joseph when he came by what a tremendous thing that is but talking about our our our life's journey and and recognizing that we need to trust in the Lord I just looked it up and there's a a few scriptures I wanted to bring in Psalms chapter 4 you don't have to turn there I'll try and go through them quickly here because of time sake um Psalms 4:5 offer sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the Lord in Psalms 31 I have hated them that regard lying vanities but I trust in the Lord Psalms 37 Trust trust in the Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verely thou shalt be fed now brothers and sisters we're not talking about moving to a a place that's really wealthy and going to a land that's going to be flowing with milk and honey because that's already happened naturally we're talking spiritually as we read these verses we're going to go to a land and we shall be fed and and that is in the Holy Ghost that's our promised land today that's what brother Bram taught is to get the Holy Ghost in our lives and then we will be fed when we go to church you know brother bradam said it if you can't go to church somewhere then go to church somewhere else and even if there isn't the church that you believe go to church right amen go to church absolutely because God will feed you there yes amen he will take that Minister that doesn't preach a certain way and he'll get him to bring the word of God enough have to feed you that's right trust in the Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land dwell in the Holy Ghost and verily Thou shalt be fed he will speak to you you'll get Revelation in your life you'll be able to teach your children Psalms 40:3 and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God I love this many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the Lords 73:28 but it is good for me to draw near to God I have put my trust in the Lord God that I may declare all thy Works Psalms 11510 oh House of Aaron trust in the Lord he is their help and their Shield Psalms 1151 ye that fear the Lord trust in the Lord he is their help and their Shield Psalms 188 it's better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man and you know you see that you see it don't put confidence in a preacher don't put confidence in a man don't put confidence in a pastor even though you have to put confidence in Christ say Lord feed me if you're not being fed pray earnestly that God will feed you and he will it's better to trust in the Lord than to put TR confidence in a man Psalms 1189 it's better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes don't trust in prime minister don't trust in president don't trust in Kings of lands don't trust in people trust in God Amen Psalms 125 I thought this was really good a song of degrees how many knows what that means song of degrees they that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion which cannot be removed but abideth forever the word Zion Mount Zion is actually the Lord actually the bride and the Lord as one that's Mount Zion that's the New Jerusalem City Mount Zion but you know degrees is H 4609 ma Mal I think is the pronunciation it's the feminine that is the act literally a journey to a high place isn't that what happens when we sing a song of degrees a song of worship it takes us to a higher place doesn't it it takes us closer to him it draws him closer to us we know his word says that draw nigh unto me and I'll draw nigh unto you if we're willing to do that with the fruit of our lips the sacrifice of praise then you know he'll change the order of the service for us amen but if but if we come to church and you know what those Devils make no mistake about it the Devils come to church and they'll start putting weights on your hands on your arms on your lips on your spirit they'll try and make you think about work they'll try and make you think about all the problems in life all the issues and situations they'll make your shoulders sore so you can't raise your hands maybe you can just go this far but you know what happens when it's sore lean into it lean into the pain brothers and sisters be a warrior for Christ and lean into the pain and give him the glory because he said that if you won't cry out the rocks will immediately cry out he's not going to say because of the song leader because of the music because of the temperature whatever the circumstance or situation he's not going to say that he's going to say did you worship or not and you know when we have worship then he speaks to us it's a feminine elevation that is the act literally a journey to a higher Place figuratively a thought arising or concretely the condition literally a step or grade Mark I think that's beautiful just take a step of Faith brothers and sisters try and worship maybe like you never have before and see if he won't pour out a blessing that you can't contain a step or grade Mark figuratively or superiority of station superiority of station you can just go to a place brothers and sisters mentally where you don't have to worry about this life and you know we can see the whole world is tapping into this stuff let's do yoga yeah let's do yoga why do people do yoga some people say it's so they can stretch but you know why people do yoga is because it is a worship it's a worship but it's not a worship unto God and what happens if you've ever done it I'm talking from experience I got I'll tell you straight I got challenged I talked to a girl she was my my friend's sister and she was doing yoga and I was like Yoga Yoga go for a workout man go do something useful with your life and she was like oh yeah I dare you to come and try it so I was like hard could it be okay so I went to the yoga studio and I did yoga that's all I can say I don't know but you know what I tried it I tried it and all it is is a bunch of stretches and Maneuvers and different things as you go and and they say do this and you do this pose and then you do that pose and you do all these different things but you know some of it is actually worship there's there's a couple different I'm not going to preach yoga don't get me wrong what I want to say is a couple minutes into it I was Dripping sweat I was profusely sweating a couple minut minutes into it I was trying it right but what happened was because I did that physical exertion in my body when the end of it came they have you get still they have you rest and it gets quiet just like this and all you hear is nothing just the sound of Life out there with a room full of people and what happens is you actually are meditating there's something spiritual going on and I remember thinking that and and when it was over I heard I remember hearing the little bell Ding and that it was all over and then everybody sort of wakes up and comes to and you roll your mats and you go home you know what there's people trying to make literally take a step or grade Mark figuratively to a superiority of station to another place Transcendental Meditation I think it's called but you know what brothers and sister we don't have to do that we know the Living God we can raise our voice in praise and worship unto him and he will pour out a blessing that we can't even contain a literal step or grade mark figuratively a a superiority of station specifically in a climactic progression in certain Psalms things that come up high degree deal go up St step story and you know when I was reading this and studying I just couldn't help but think about that that that brother brother meno uncle brother meno I'll call him and how he told the story about seeing his sister the dream about how he was talking to his sister and he was just taken steps that day and every time he took a step he would just go higher and higher and higher in the in the air and I believe he said this felt like the Rapture was actually taking place but he was able to experience it it just made me think about that testimony that he told us here just a wonderful thing Proverbs 3:5 trust in the Lord with all thine heart not just a part of it not just on Sundays not just on Wednesdays not just maybe when I feel like it but all the time in all thy ways trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding but if you try and lean unto your own understanding while you're trusting in the Lord are you trusting in the Lord brothers and sisters it's a serious thing many times even in a church we'll actually be looking for a spiritual answer through a natural solution oh that's not the man that I wanted to see God put into position you know what if the voice of the Holy Ghost is spoken and a man gets positioned is that not God trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding how can how do you think Joseph must have felt was he thinking about this verse because it wasn't just David's inspiration that wrote this verse was it I I was thinking while he was in the in the myy clay while he was in the bottom of that pit he must have been having some of these thoughts himself now maybe it's a stretch brother Barry you're going a bit far you're taking spiritual Liberty scriptural Liberty Maybe but I'll say this trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding and you know brothers and sisters in all thy ways all thy ways acknowledge Him and then what whose will you're going to be in you're not going to be in his permissive will brothers and sisters it doesn't matter where you're at and remember when we worry about oh perfect will permissive will even if we get ourselves out of step with him and we go and use our own understanding that's going to put you directly in your per in his permissive will use our own understanding brothers and sisters we can say we trust in God all that we want to but as soon as we actually don't use his leadership in our lives if we're not acknowledging him all the way he's not going to direct our path he'll let us stray a little bit and get into the rambles get some prickles in our lives get some problems and then we'll turn right back to him and say Lord please help please help but trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not unto thine own understanding and you know what when you're all your ways are acknowledging him he will direct your paths he loves to take his permissive will and turn it into his perfect will his perfect will I personally think that his permissive will is part of his perfect will because he leads us if we're Sons and Daughters of God he leads us and I think it's not even really Fair we I talk to my dad about this all the time and some people might think I'm crazy because I was raised in a Pentecostal church when I was a kid I was dedicated unto the Lord period that's all and when I talked to my dad about how I strayed into the brambles I got out into different things and problems and issues in my life and completely left God my dad says every single time but God never left you but God never left you you were never as far away as you thought you were and I have to say Amen thanks Dad I mean oh what a tremendous thing it is Proverbs 28:25 he that is of a proud heart stirreth up Strife the legalists he that is of a proud heart stirreth up oh yeah I've heard it all I know it yeah there's nothing you can tell me that I haven't heard that's fine we're not talking about someone that's proud that dresses nicely or has a nice car or maybe that no no no no no this is all about who we are in our heart I've never sinned I've never gone out into the world I'm perfect are you do people know that you serve a living God do you say that I'm better because I've never gone and sinned in my life remember guilty of the least is guilty of the whole you haven't gone out and murdered someone doesn't matter you told a lie you're just as is guilty even if you haven't told a lie you're born in sin you're shaped in iniquity you come into this world speaking light nothing you can do about it but he that is of a proud heart stirreth up Strife but he that putteth his trust in the Lord amen shall be made fat and now we're not talking about fat not like brother Barry we're not talking about that we're talking about having food in your storehouse so that you can actually spiritually feed upon that word amen so that you could actually feed your children on that word so that you can actually look after your people he that is of a proud heart stirreth up Strife but he that putteth his trust in the Lord shall be made fat Proverbs 29:25 the fear of man bringeth a snare but who so putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe amen Hallelujah aren't those wonderful scriptures brothers and sisters as we walk in our lives just put the Lord First Trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He will direct your paths when you don't know what way to go when you don't know what to say when you don't know what to do he will tell you what to do just wait upon the Lord and He will renew your strength you'll Mount up with wings as an eagle you won't be dancing around in the barn yard with the chickens we got a potluck at our house today I'm sorry I never mentioned it but brothers and sisters if you feel inclined I want to ask you if you're coming out today just take a moment and go over and look at the chicken yard if you haven't looked at a chicken yard go and look at a chicken yard and visualize the story that brother bradam tells about how you can create an atmosphere anywhere and you can take an eagle egg and put it under a hen and that hen can hatch out the eagle and the eagle can be hopping around in the chicken yard and we take a bucket in the kitchen and we put it under the sink maybe it's too much information I'm going to get it from my wife but we put all the slot The Leftovers in there the stuff that the chickens can eat who cares if it's a little moldy and a little bit whatever it's chickens and we go out to see the chickens and we just dump the bucket and it goes in all the manure and take a look some people might not want to walk in there but if you want to we'll let you hold a chicken we've got some chicks there too and they're kind of cute until they grow up and then they get really stinky but you know brother Bram talks about that story for a reason go and look at this manure that's all around they're pecking in this manure their food gets sprinkled all through the manure and that's where they're living we don't have to live our lives like that like the rest of the world does brothers and sisters we can eat Eagle food we can say the master will prepare for us a table in the presence of our enemies and it will be great triple A oh my beef and we're going to be able to just feast on that we don't have to eat slop from under under someone's table just makes me think about Joseph being tossed in that well how many has heard that song even when I don't see it you're working even when I don't feel it you're working you never stop you never stop stop working even when I don't see it you're working even when I don't feel it you're working you never stop you never stop working I just can't help but think Joseph was singing that song in his heart because he couldn't see it he was in the bottom of a pit it was dark his brothers just threw him down there they just totally rejected him but somehow he knew he knew God was with he had a relationship with God and why did he have a relationship with God brothers and sisters because his daddy taught him right the word says train them up in the way they should go and it will not depart from them in in uh sorry chapter 43 carrying on here Joseph now he sees his brethren for the first time just for time sake I'm going to try and and go through these I've got a quote or two I still want to read but in in chapter 43 Joseph he sees his brethren for the first time and there's a famine in the land and and you know brothers and sisters we we can look at this land here that we live in and we've got plenty and and we've got this opportunity we we all know about it but some people might not you could go downstairs and see the tables just full of food and in the fridge there's full of food in the freezer it's full of food there's lots of food in the land we can talk about famine and there's places in the world where there's famine but in our day and age when we talk about famine in the land we're not talking about food natural famine brothers and sisters there is a famine in the land and that famine is for the hearing of the word and the word of God people don't want to hear it and even the people that want to hear it they can go to church and they can't hear it right but there was a famine in the land and that famine caused circumstances to take place didn't it it drove them down into Egypt even though Joseph was already already there they sold him into slavery and he got taken down into Egypt they didn't know where he was going they just said get rid of him and then we don't have to deal with this this dreamer anymore and and here we have God orchestrating it what does he say in the word just be sure that your sins find you out doesn't he he says that so here we have now his Brethren coming down and seeing this Leader Joseph he's on the throne he's the one that's controlling everything in the land the famine is sore everywhere except for there because of Joseph chapter 44 we know that Joseph he he wanted to see his brother his kin brother the one who was the brother from his mother he wanted to see Benjamin and you know when he saw him he had to go back he demanded that he see him we know the story he demanded to the brothers go get go get him you say you got another one I want to see that one get him and until you get him this other one I think it was Simeon he's going to stay here he's not leaving he's going to prison and and when you come back with Benjamin then I'll release him that's fine and and we know that they were quivering because they had to go back and tell Daddy now the one that you said can't go he's got to come and if he doesn't come then he's not even going to see us and so they they went they got him they brought him back and they showed him and he was so happy to see Benjamin his brother and we know Joseph wasn't willing to let them go that easy was he yes he gave them their money back he gave them the sacks of wheat the sacks of grain on their mules and and sent them on their way but he actually got his Porter to put the the Goblet the cup inside Benjamin's sack and and here we have the story now it it's starting to pick up a little bit bear with me for a second in chapter 44 he knew what he was doing he knew exactly what what ass was going to be Benjamin's and so he put it in there on purpose and you know he sent his Porter after them he said to him up in the morning after he sent them away get after them and I want you to go and and find out who stole my cup so I'm thinking it must have been a maybe another one that did it so he really believed this happened I don't know we don't know the story but his Porter went after them and and said why do you return evil for good I was good to you and then you've done this to me who would dare do that and they said hey man we're innocent we're perfect we haven't done anything wrong all of our sin is under the blood right we're perfect there's nothing wrong whoever did such a thing let him be killed kill that man and that the rest of us be your servants just made me think while I was studying this out isn't that exactly like the children of Israel just give us a a robber and a murderer and take this one that claims to be the Messiah and just do away with him just just get rid of him but we have uh we have the brothers claiming everything's good in their life yeah no problem whoever who who whomsoever of thy servants it be found both let him die and we also will be my Lord's bondmen this is verse 10 and he said of 44 and he said now let it be according unto your words he with whom it's found shall be my servant and ye shall be blameless fully knowing what's going to happen here and they speedily this is verse 11 of 44 they speedily took took down every man his sack to the ground and opened up every man is sack and he searched and began at the eldest and left at the youngest and the cup was found in Benjamin Zach can you imagine what happened to their hearts after promising to their dad just kill our lineage if we don't bring Benjamin back don't worry about it Dad we've got this all under control now they've got to go and tell them the second time remember be sure your sins will find you out it's just incredible then they rent their clothes and laid it every man has asked and returned to the city they went right back in there they had to go and plead now for Joseph's life plead now for their lives verse 14 and Judah and his Brethren came to Joseph's house for he was yet there and they fell before him on the ground didn't those sheep pay obedience unto Joseph right there and Joseph said unto them what deed is it that ye have done what are you doing here what ye not that such a man as I can certainly Divine I mean know he wasn't divining here he was just simply acting out what he wanted to he was getting a little bit of Vengeance in not in a bad way but he was letting them know without actually revealing himself and verse 16 and Judas said what shall we say unto my Lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my Lord's servants both we and he also with whom the cup is found I think it's just beautiful looking at this you know verse 17 and he said God forbid that I should do so but the man in whose hand the cup was found he shall be my servant and as for you get up in peace unto your father just leave Benjamin here and you guys get lost because I know what that's going to do so perhaps maybe he was divining what would happen in that circumstance oh my then Judah came near unto him and now for the second time interceded for Joseph remember the first time the Brethren were like let's kill him here comes the dreamer let's just do away with him thatat Roder we hate him get rid of him we'll just put some blood on his coat and send it to Dad and and we'll all be better without him but Judah came and said no no no no not so don't kill him don't kill him we don't want his blood on our hands let's just sell him into slavery but verse 16 says a Jew Judah said what shall we say unto my Lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves for God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants and I can only imagine he was not only thinking about that cup but he was thinking about his brother because later on we know when they're there they actually have a conversation in front of Joseph and they explain you know God's found out about us God is dealing with us that's the reason we're going through all this because of what we've done to our brother he leads him that way but Judah came near in verse 18 and said unto him oh my Lord let thy servant I pray thee speak a word in my Lord's ears and let not thine anger burn against thy servant excuse me for thou art even as Pharaoh knowing that unless he said it nothing was going to happen and it's just a an interesting thing to look at this this chapter Jose has Benjamin returned to him at first they simply said just slay the one that did such a thing so so flippantly just slay him we're perfect there's nothing wrong in our heart there's no iniquity found in our hearts just go ahead and slay him and then wow now they've changed it to pleading for the life of Benjamin don't don't let us go back home and tell Daddy that Benjamin is not here because we already told him that he's coming it's not going to be a problem and it's just interesting because now now the Brethren are back in front of Joseph God completely spun the tables and now they're pleading with Master Joseph it's just beautiful how God does it chapter 45 where we read the scripture today verse one then Joseph could no longer refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go up out from me and there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his Brethren and wept aloud and the Egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard and Joseph said unto his Brethren I am Joseph does my father yet live and his brother Brethren once again could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence can you imagine what that must have felt like the roller coaster of emotions that they were on and you know I'm not feeling bad for the brothers I'm just trying to illustrate it it's interesting to think about how terrible they must have felt how God allowed all of these circumstances to play out but we know Joseph he goes on to say you know what God did send me before you to preserve life amen that's the reason why you did what you did you had no idea why you were doing what you were doing I had no idea why I was doing what I was doing we were all just acting out the roles that God has created us to do amen and alls we have to do is make sure that we acknowledge Him in all of our ways brothers and sisters verse 7 said and God sent me before you to preserve you a prosperity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance so now it was not you that sent me hither but God isn't that interesting many times in our lives we can look at our lives and say that it was so and so sending of me it was so and so's doing that caused me to act you know what it was it was God it was God's will actually coming out and being performed in our lives and we know there's many things that we don't like there's prickly things about ourselves that we don't like that God doesn't like but he knows they're there and he's going to get them out of us and how does he do it he squeezes us he allows us to go through a fire he allows us to go through a trial because things have to come out of us remember David he was the King David was a man after God's Own Heart but he had iniquity in his heart he was still a murderer wasn't he he was still an adulterer wasn't he but God took both of those right out of his heart and even when the prophet came and said to him oh I've got a a situation King live forever there's this man he he he has great herds and flocks everything in the land the Lord has looked after him so diligently but yet he saw one man across the street and he only only had one she lamb and he had to take that lamb for himself and we know the story and David said oh right away let that man die I'm going to judge that man and you know what the prophet said to him that man is you don't ever let ourselves get puffed up within ourselves brothers and sisters because the moment we do that God's going to say that's you he allows us to go through pressure to show us who's on the inside but I just love this verse 45 then Joseph could no longer refrain himself and cause every man to go out from me and you know brothers and sisters that time is nearly just upon us we know that Israel is back in the Homeland and Joseph Jesus is just about to reveal himself to his Brethren some people might be saying well first brother Barry there's got to be two prophets that go and preach the message of the hour to them and true that's going to happen first there should be a Rapture of the church true there should be those things but don't look for things to happen brothers and sisters because as soon as we start looking for natural circumstances to decide that we're going to get in the boat it's going to be too late because man doesn't close the door man doesn't call man into the boat it's the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and outside of the Holy Ghost the real baptism of the Holy Ghost the inspiration is wrong we're going to have the wrong inspiration so our GPS is going to be tied into something wrong it's going to give us the wrong coordinates and we're going to drive to the wrong location thinking we're in the right place and we're going to find out the Rapture is already gone we're going to see the two witnesses in the land of Israel and we know that it's going to be three and a half years of absolute chaos like this world has never seen that is so close brothers and sisters any moment now you know the word of God says there's coming a time where Israel will be completely surrounded by the world has there ever been a time where it's like it is now the US is turning on them all the countries that were around they're calling for a uh what is it a court marshal or a issue a warrant for the arrest in the international court for Benjamin Netanyahu I would say the world is surrounding Israel right now they've got nowhere to go and uh that's why they're fighting for their life and they're not going to listen to anybody because they're going to fight for their life because there's 144,000 little Benjamins down there right now just waiting for messiah to come amen but God sent me before you to preserve a prosperity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance I just can't help but think how many people have we seen gone on before us brothers and sisters that have done things for us in our lives brother Bram laid his life down so that he could preserve a prosperity in the earth not just in Egypt but in the earth amen so that we could actually save our lives by a great Deliverance because we could get the message of the hour we could get the direction to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost because outside of that we're going to miss it I just can't imagine what that must have been like when Joseph revealed himself to his Brethren and you know that time is very very close where Joseph will reveal himself to the children of Israel once again and we know that that will call out the 144,000 that there will be a nation saved in a day and it's going to be an amazing time whether we'll be here or not I don't know I'm not going to say one way or the other brother bam talks about it one way and the other way you know what we're not supposed to look at natural times no man knows the day or the hour but we can certainly see the season and this is the season brothers and sisters that fig tree has put forth its bud in in in chapter 45 Joseph could no longer refrain frin himself and caused every man to go from me this is where brother bradam I believe he does lean more to this side where when Joseph reveals himself when Christ reveals himself the bride is going to be in the palace brother bradam says it very clearly that the bride is in the palace but what exactly when that time is I'm not going to try and and and go there but I do want to say this when he is revealing himself to his Brethren to those 144,000 Benjamins the ones that really truly love the Lord he's going to cause every man to go for me and that is where he's going to cause the Gentile Church to be gone the true church will be in the palace because she is the bride and you know we know the word of God says that we need to rejoice and be very glad why is that because the marriage of the Lamb has come and what not his bride has made herself ready his wife ha made herself ready and that signals something significant brothers and sisters it's no longer the wedding ceremony now they have consummated the marriage and the Twain have become one and that is actually happening right now today brothers and sisters I know we're living in the bride age but there's got to be some people getting married to their bridegroom and when you're married to your bridegroom you become one with your bridegroom and your thoughts are his thoughts his thoughts are your thoughts he can start a sentence and you can finish the sentence because you're no longer Twain You're one then Joseph could no longer refrain himself imagine what that's going to sound like for Jesus to go back and talk to his Brethren and to have that spiritual intimacy with them where there's no distraction now the bride's gone she's in the palace nice and safe at the marriage supper of the Lamb oh my she's not going to be dealing with life anymore he doesn't have to think about her for a moment now he's going to turn his attention to these little Benjamins and while he's dealing with them can you imagine how they're going to feel when they recognize when that blindness that was that blindness was put on their eyes so that we could be saved today they're going to recognize for centuries they have thought that he was a charlatan that he was not the Messiah but there's going to be a revelation just like we've been given about this message of the hour about our own salvation about the Holy Ghost In Our Lives the same Revelation is going to strike their hearts oh my I've never been to Israel but I have heard I've seen video of them worshiping before the Wailing Wall some of us have been there to Israel and have seen such a thing can you imagine what it will be like 144,000 crying out to God oh my I just think that's wonderful in chapter 46 Israel journeyed to beers Sheba Israel Jacob he decided to go and worship in beerseba according to the Lord he called him and said come and offer sacrifices in a place where your dad used to do it and so he did he went to beerseba to offer the sacrifices and God promised to him don't fear it's okay your son is down in Egypt he's got a good position there don't worry this is all under control I've got this you just go down there you just take your family down there and you're going to multiply you're going to become a great nation you are going to be just tremendous and then we go into uh chapter what was that 46 47 even in 46 we have the geneologies I'm just trying to move for time sake here in uh chapter 47 Joseph introduced his family to Pharaoh we know that he had sent Pharaoh he told Pharaoh about his family after revealing himself to his Brethren Pharaoh said just get your family bring them down here I want to meet him bring them to the Palace let's see your family I'd love to meet him like to meet your dad how did you become who you are we know somebody trained you upright in the way you should go so Joseph he introduced his family to pharaoh and you know I I just was thinking about this is struck my heart so strongly what's it going to be like one day because this maybe it's my own scriptural spiritual spin my own spiritual uh Liberty if you will but what if we as parents get to present our families to God we get to take our families to pharaoh and say yes this is my son this is my son this is my son they have all chosen to worship you they have all chosen to live listen to the teaching that I have gave them what a tremendous time that will be we know that the prophets get to take their people and introduce them don't they but here we have the scriptural version Joseph took his family and introduced them to pharaoh and you know I just believe we will in verse 5 and six of uh 47 Pharaoh said you know what Joseph just make sure your family's looked after just whatever they need don't worry about it just put it on my tab they have an open PO with the king of the land can you imagine they want a Cadillac Chariot they want the best horse they want really fine flour bread flour to bake their bread with they want the best whatever they want just give it to them just make sure they've got it Pharaoh said to them make sure you look after your family and he didn't say just look after them but he said give them the best can you imagine that that's Joseph interceding for us Jesus Christ they the family of Christ give them the best the father Pharaoh telling Jesus the Holy Ghost give them the best they're following me they're serving every ordinance that I've given them all of the Revelation that I've placed in their heart they're doing it just give them the best don't hold anything back from them in the land verse 11 to13 Joseph he placed his brethen he took the Holy Ghost and positionally placed his brethren in the land gave them the best power palaces the best houses the best everything they desired he nourished his father and Brethren with bread now this one kind of surprised me because I thought you know there is a famine in the land and there is grain there they've got lots of grain and stuff but it says in there that Joseph's family was nourished with bread verse 13 but there was no bread in all the land there was no bread in all the land even in Egypt and Canaan says that the people fainted because there was no bread there was no food but Joseph's family was looked after all of his Brethren were looked after everything was good for them trust in the Lord with all your heart brothers and sisters don't lean onto your own understanding on your journey make sure that you trust in the Lord and make sure that you worship Him amen yes don't wait for someday where I'm going to worship him when I get over there you're not going to get over there if you're not worshiping him now chapter 48 and 49 Israel blessing Israel was blessing his children Jacob took every one of the children just for time sake I'm going to blow through this but every one of them he pronounced a blessing upon them before he died the 12 patriarch and you know Their Blessings weren't that great they weren't that encouraging they weren't that exciting and that was because of their names that was because of the way they acted and if you go and you read it you'll see that it wasn't really the most exciting thing thing but he did he told them I know what you did I know what you did and this is what's going to happen this is how you're going to be this is how your children will be this is what you're going to encounter but it's the path you chose didn't mean they didn't get the blessings still in their lives and that's the crazy thing you know what happens is maybe we'll still have a blessing in our life God is that merciful he did that with Kings in Israel he said you know I I I won't judge you it's okay but your children and your children's children they're going to pay for your sins it's a terrible thing we need to make sure that we have our own salvation worked out with fear and trembling because we might still have many blessings in our lives but what about our children and our children's children some might say well the Rapture is going to go and we don't have to worry about that yeah we do have to worry about that we're supposed to Hal our potatoes like he's coming A hundred years from now but he pronounced a blessing on each one of them that wasn't really the greatest blessing some might say it was even a cursing but it's the way it was for them in their lives um it's the way it worked out it was the will of God but you know we we need to be careful and understand that whatsoever we sow that's what we're going to reap amen because God will not be mocked God will not be mocked in chapter 50 this is really what I wanted to get to to draw a a close of of the the story of Joseph in chapter 50 starting at Verse 18 you know again his Brethren came this ISS after the death of of of daddy he passed away and his Brethren were able to see all of the exploits of Joseph and to recognize and I Can Only Imagine because of Verse 18 the way they say this the the word says this and his Brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants verse 17 says so shall ye say unto Joseph forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy Brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the Servants of the god of thy father and Joseph wept when they spake unto him and we know Verse 18 that's where they bowed down again their sheaves actually paid obedience just exactly like he said would happen in the dream that God gave him that was a Dream from God it was a prophecy from the dream but I just I just can't help but think that when they did this it was because daddy died now perhaps Joseph was just being kind to us because Daddy was here and he didn't want to upset Daddy but they didn't realize that Joseph wasn't about that at all Joseph was actually a Son of God and Joseph truly understood where he was at even though on his journey as he encountered the pitfalls the slavery the beatings the mistreatment we know the story as he went along and encountered all of that he just still kept the word of God in his heart he remembered the teaching of his daddy and and God blessed him for it amen out of faith in uh in 1956 brother Bram said and I said I see so much evil on the street when I see that evil I look at the cross and I think oh God how I love you for saving me from such a corruption that's right let him let him always be before our face now Abraham was called by election Abraham is election Isaac is justification Jacob is Grace and Joseph is perfection am and you know brothers and sisters we know we read out of Hebrews 6 let us go onto Perfection not worrying about the traditions of church laying on of hands water baptisms and we'll do all of those Lord permitting but let's go on to perfection and the only way we can go on to Perfection is through the lives of the people before us Joseph is perfection he says now in the beginning when God called Abraham he called him not because he was a good man but because God fornew Abraham God knew Abraham would do knew what Abraham would do he knowed Abraham he said I'll know what Abraham will raise his children to fear the lord God knowed him God knows you I'll say it this way God knows you thank you Lord that's the reason we as Cong Congressman Upshaw used to say we can't make ourselves something that we hate that's right no matter how much you try to impersonate you can't do it it's the Sovereign Grace of God that calls you brothers and sisters don't pretend don't fake it till you make it just give your lives unto God Just Surrender unto him see if he's not God ask him if you're God be God in my life and see if he won't reveal himself to you and through you and Abraham was called by the grace and by election and when he was called when he was was received his call he was given the Covenant of God not because he was a good man but it was given unconditionally to him and every single one of us have the very same covenant not in a natural sense but in a spiritual sense which is even better than a natural sense because we are the spiritual Seed of Abraham the spiritual Royal Seed of Abraham and that Covenant isn't a conditional covenant not if you do I will I've done I sent myself my son my expression of God to the Cross to die and pay for every single sin on the earth and that's it there's nothing that we can do to atone for sin we just need to AC except that he did it but it was given unconditionally to him he says now this is going to hurt legalist Believers just a little bit now I don't mean to pinch but we want to know the truth see there's nothing that a man can do to save himself you are already saved by grace that's right you can't stop eating meats you can't stop doing this you can't stop there's nothing you can do and I want to say this brothers and sisters We Can't Stop anything in our lives Naturally Speaking spiritually speaking Naturally Speaking we have things in our lives where we would think oh my I've tried and tried and tried and tried and tried to stop this thing I I just can't seem to overcome it you know what you never will you never will and God allows those things to be in our lives to show us that we never will but by his grace brothers and sisters if we're willing to say God be Lord in my life that means surrender in every single thought every single action every single thing that I do you're going to have control over every decision in my life because you're Lord that's different that's where you will see God come into your life and you will start losing these things that you thought you could never overcome and and the biggest one is ourselves there's nothing a man can do to save himself you are already saved by grace that's right you can't stop eating meat you can't stop doing this you can't stop there's nothing nothing you can do Christ saves you and that alone and that's right you can't even come to him I love this unless he chooses you first he said you never chose me but I chose you and no man can come to me except the father draws him brothers and sisters if you feel the father drawing you don't resist them and all that comes I'll give him everlasting life and raise him up at the last day amen that settles it oh my that that would make the Methodist get happy think of it he'll raise us up at the last day now where am I going with this I'm I'm going somewhere and I've only got 10 minutes thinking about the story of Joseph with this he says why it's not we are but what Christ is for us Christ become you and I that you and I might become him he taken our sins that we might take his is righteousness isn't that beautiful so it's nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling nothing I could do nothing you could do it's the grace of God I just think it's so beautiful when we recognize the grace of God brothers and sisters talking about the story of Joseph verse 19 of chapter 50 his brothers came and said don't kill us now because Daddy's Gone don't do us in because they still hadn't forgiven themselves not recognizing really who Joseph was and that really he meant what he said and that was because of the iniquity in their own Hearts right because they were skunks and daddy proclaimed that blessing upon them yeah you're a skunk and this is what's going to happen in your life because of your behavior but it's God's choice it's his plan but par or sorry verse 19 of chapter 50 and Joseph said unto them fear not for I am in the place am I in the place of God verse 20 but as for you ye thought evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive now therefore fear ye not isn't that familiar words I go back to the Book of Joshua be strong and of a good courage don't be afraid because everywhere the soul of your foot tread in this promised land it's your possession Every Word of Promise in the book is mine and it becomes that to us brothers and sisters now therefore fear ye not I will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them I just can't help but think the compound Revelation for me today in this scripture is that he will nourish us and our little ones if we're willing to come if we're willing to put him first if we're willing to trust in the Lord with all of our hearts that we know that he's leading every single thing is happening according to his will and his will is according to his word now therefore fear ye not we don't have to be afraid we know that love casts out fear all fear doesn't it I will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and spoke kindly to them and Joseph dwelt in Egypt he and his father's house and Joseph lived and 110 years isn't this beautiful and Joseph saw ephraim's Children of the third generation can you imagine that of the third generation the children also of Meer the son of Manasseh were brought upon Joseph's knees as an old man he got the great great grandchildren up upon on his knees and Joseph said unto his Brethren I die and God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swear to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob as I was reading this I thought boy oh boy if there was ever a person that ever heard the prophecy of God and believed it that was the man to think about all the things that happen in his life how God led him through every single fire every single Valley every single trial every single Victory to know that was God in his life and to know that God promised that that's going to happen in verse 25 and Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and ye shall carry my bones from hence so Joseph died being 110 years old they inomed him and he was put in a coffin in Egypt and you know we've talked about the Exodus we've talked about it a fair bit I'm not going to preach on that today but we know the children of Israel when they left when Pharaoh finally said get out after his heart was hardened thoroughly and he said get out take you all the women all the children take all your flocks and herds take whatever you want go and take as much gold as much food just leave this land when they did did they actually went and they took Joseph as well and they took Joseph into the land of Israel I can see I'm running out of time I had a giant quote here but I don't think I'm going to read it just because it's too long but I just thought it was interesting anybody know of the place called Mella in Israel Mella some people might have visited it I think it would be a really neat place to visit this place is where the Patriarchs were buried this is the place the land that Abraham bought the cave that Abram bought Abraham bought this for his wife Sarah and apparently all of the Patriarchs are buried there and there's stories about supernatural events happening people trying to get into the tombs and and going blind people seeing lights all kinds of different things I wouldn't want to go because I'm Supernatural uh spook chaser I'm not into that at all but I just think it's interesting because this is an actual place their bones weren't just scattered to the wind they actually went to a very specific place for a very specific reason because there is coming a day brothers and sisters where those bones will rise again there's no senu on those ears but they're going to have ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church in their day and you know what there's coming a time where someone is going to stand at that SRE and put their shoulders back and they're going to say come forth with a voice that's not a voice of a man and it's not going to be specific to any one person it's going to be to everyone who is truly elect out of all the ages and when that happens all of those graves are going to burst and all of those Patriarchs are going to come out of those tombs I just think it's pretty powerful to think there's that many Patriarchs in one place this is a burial site of the Patriarchs it says a rich folklore has developed about the shrine and its history of those buried below this is Google according to Jewish Christian Muslim Legends not only are the Patriarchs and their wives buried in Mella but also Adam and Eve right Esau and the twel sons of Jacob some Jewish Traditions hold that the path to the Garden of Eden lies within the cave right and isn't that the wisdom of man brothers and sisters because we know that we've been given away back to the tree of life and it's not through a cave it's not through a shrine that was built by some man the way back to the tree of life is through Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Holy Spirit who is Alive and Well in our midst maybe stand with me this morning as we close amen I want to get into the the stories of Daniel as we go forwards I just think it's really important remember brothers and sisters his will is his word and so long as we're willing to take his word Thy word have I hid in mine heart that I might not sin against thee th that word has got to be in our lives and so long as it is you're in his will doesn't matter what we encounter it doesn't matter what trial or tribulation comes our way because when we're in his word we can say Lord where are you and he might not answer you right now but he will answer and he will deliver he delivers us from all of the evil in our lives we have so much to be thankful for let's just bow in prayer gracious heaven father Lord we love you we thank you for the story of Joseph thank you for the Revelation Lord the the understanding that your will is your word and so long as we're willing to allow you to be Lord in our lives we have your word we can say that we have your word but not live according to the statutes that you've given us father we pray that you would just help us Lord to to open your word and to see your reflection Lord when we look into the word that we wouldn't see ourselves but that we would see you according to the way that you created us Lord and we know that we were created in your very image so we pray that Lord Jesus as we open your word and we begin to read it that Lord we wouldn't see ourselves father that we would stop seeing ourselves reflecting back but that we would see you more and more Lord I just want to ask that you would bless us father as we go our separate ways today that you would keep your hand upon us father be with those who couldn't be here today for whatever reason wherever they are Lord we pray that you would just maybe grant them
