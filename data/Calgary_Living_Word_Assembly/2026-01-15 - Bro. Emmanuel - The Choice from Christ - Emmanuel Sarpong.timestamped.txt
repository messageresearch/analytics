[18:56] only one way. I'm standing on his word.
[18:58] Blessed be his name. As brother Dawn
[19:01] comes, we'll sing this chorus. He's got
[19:02] a special for us tonight. In Jesus
[19:06] [music]
[19:07] [singing] name
[19:09] we press on. [music]
[19:14] Oh, in [singing and music]

[19:30] [music]
[19:33] [singing]
[19:34] us
[19:36] [music]
[19:38] [singing]
[19:42] to [music]
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; Bless you all.
[19:52] Glad to be in the house of the Lord
[19:54] tonight. Yeah.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:59] For a month, I tried to put this into
[20:01] words and failed miserably about seven
[20:04] times.
[20:05] But Monday morning, I woke up and I just
[20:08] wrote it all out in one go.
[20:13] I want to share this with you. It's
[20:14] called the joy of the Lord.
[20:17] Oh, the joy of the Lord. It's hard to
[20:19] explain.
[20:21] It's not built by logic, nor learned
[20:24] through pain. It lives in expression, in
[20:27] breath, and in song. A knowing that
[20:30] tells you where you belong.
[20:34] It rises in places you'd never expect.
[20:38] In weakness and trial, in moments
[20:41] unchecked, it sings through the chains,
[20:45] though the night feels long. The quiet,
[20:48] defiant, heavenborns song. It endures
[20:52] what would break a heart left alone
[20:55] because it is rooted where Christ is
[20:57] enthroned.
[20:59] Not shallow or fleeting, not fading with
[21:03] time, but steady and sure, a strength so
[21:07] divine.
[21:09] It is rest for the soul that is finally
[21:12] seen that Christ dwells within.
[21:16] Peaceful and serene,
[21:18] not a distant companion,
[21:20] not passing through,
[21:23] &gt;&gt; but life in your life forever made new.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; It takes gentle steps when you want to
[21:30] hide.
[21:32] When fear
[21:34] crowds your thoughts and hope feels
[21:36] [music] denied, still joy keeps you
[21:39] moving, not rushed, not forced, led
[21:43] softly along by your comfort and source.
[21:48] It passes all knowledge, all measure and
[21:52] scale. A peace that remains when
[21:55] explanations fail.
[21:58] It steadies your footing, lifts weary
[22:00] views, motivates,
[22:03] moves you, and keeps you true.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; It is revelation lived out each day, not
[22:09] shaped by conditions that come or that
[22:12] sway in every situation, both humble and
[22:16] pressed. It calls forth the heart, and
[22:20] requests its best. So here is my
[22:23] offering, simple and true, not fully
[22:25] explaining. We can't explain the joy in
[22:28] our hearts but pointing
[22:31] to him you in our hearts. For the joy of
[22:34] the Lord cannot just be deployed. It
[22:38] must be lived, breathed, [snorts] and
[22:41] most importantly quietly enjoyed. Lord
[22:45] bless you all.
[22:47] [applause]
[22:59] Yes, looks like we are on the same page.
[23:01] Brother Don, Joy Unspeakable was the
[23:03] first uh song just today. So, we just
[23:06] thank the Lord for the joy of the Lord.
[23:08] It truly is our strength. Thank you,
[23:09] brother Don. Love the gift and you're
[23:11] you, my brother, and just uh a wonderful
[23:14] wonderful blessing to the assembly. God
[23:16] bless you. Stand with me if you would.
[23:18] Thou art [music] worthy. Thou art
[23:20] worthy. Just give your give your husband
[23:22] tonight a little praise, little little
[23:24] joy in the quiet moments as brother
[23:26] Don's poem said [music] that those quiet
[23:29] times where you just tell the Lord how
[23:31] amazing he is. Oh, thou
[23:35] art worthy.
[23:38] Oh, thou [singing]
[23:40] [music] art worthy.
[23:46] are worthy [music]
[23:55] to
[23:57] [music] receive
[23:58] glory.

[25:00] is all [singing and music] that really
[25:03] matters.
[25:04] Isn't that the truth tonight? Oh,
[25:07] [singing]

[27:58] [music and singing]
[28:03] [music]
[28:05] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[28:08] &gt;&gt; My

[28:20] is great.

[28:32] [music and singing]
[28:35] today
[28:39] [music and singing]
[28:48] [music]
[28:50] from
[28:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts before him. Our
[29:00] merciful father, our gracious Lord Jesus
[29:03] Christ, there is none like you. Father,
[29:06] you are worthy of all our praise. You
[29:09] are worthy of all the honor that we can
[29:11] give and more. You are worthy of all our
[29:13] adoration. Father, what would be of us
[29:15] without you? And that is why we always
[29:18] we always approach you in humility,
[29:20] Father. That we will always come before
[29:22] you, oh Lord, with a heart of gratitude,
[29:25] Father, knowing that you are worthy more
[29:27] than we can ever give. And we always
[29:30] come, Father, to offer our lives,
[29:32] Father. It's even a privilege, Father,
[29:34] to find ourselves in your will, Father,
[29:37] fulfilling your purpose, Father. And
[29:39] that is why we gather this evening,
[29:41] Father, because we know the time is
[29:42] getting closer, Father. And without you,
[29:45] we are nothing. Father, we've come this
[29:48] Friday because of you. And Father, we
[29:51] are counting on you. Father, we pray
[29:53] that you lead us safely home. Father,
[29:55] have your way this evening even as we
[29:57] gather. Oh God, [music] inspire your
[29:59] word to the hearts of every soul
[30:01] present, including the speaker. Lord,
[30:03] Father, have your way, Father. Be
[30:05] pleased with this worship. Be pleased
[30:06] with the service, oh Lord. And whoever
[30:08] is tuning in, Father, speak to hearts,
[30:11] oh Lord. And Father, let your will
[30:13] prevail in all that we do.
[30:16] You're worthy of praise. You're worthy
[30:18] of honor. You're worthy of adoration. We
[30:21] commit the remainder of the service into
[30:22] your hands. Bless the musicians. Bless
[30:25] every soul present, oh Lord. And may we
[30:27] never go back the same way we came.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; We love you. We appreciate you in Jesus
[30:32] Christ's name. Amen.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you to the
[30:37] musicians.
[30:39] Um
[30:43] I suppose we'll just read the word
[30:45] quickly so we can sit down. Um
[30:51] [snorts]
[30:51] I'm reading from Joshua 24.
[30:54] I think this has come up quite a few
[30:57] times in recent times.
[31:02] Such a privilege to be gathered this
[31:05] evening. Amen.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; In his presence. And I know it's a bit
[31:10] unexpected, right?
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Uh
[31:15] &gt;&gt; but nothing surprises God.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; From the foundation of the earth, he
[31:20] knew what who will be here.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; And he he knew exactly what will be
[31:24] needed.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So my
[31:28] prayer is that this unexpected situation
[31:32] does not influence your expectation.
[31:35] Praise the Lord. I'm reading from Joshua
[31:39] 24:14.
[31:50] 15. Yes. I'll start from 14. Yeah. My my
[31:56] All right. Joshua 24:14.
[31:59] Now therefore, fear the Lord
[32:02] &gt;&gt; and serve him in sincerity and in truth.
[32:04] Amen.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Put away the gods which your father
[32:07] served on the other side of the flood
[32:10] and in Egypt, and serve ye the Lord.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; And if it seems evil unto you to serve
[32:16] the Lord, choose you this day whom ye
[32:18] will serve, whether the gods which your
[32:21] fathers serve that were on the other
[32:23] side of the flood, or the gods of the
[32:25] Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as
[32:28] for me and my house will serve the Lord.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord have his blessings to
[32:34] the reader of the word. You may be
[32:36] seated.
[32:41] And so, um,
[32:45] we are already in the second week of the
[32:48] year.
[32:50] I'm not sure if it's still appropriate
[32:52] to say happy new year,
[32:56] &gt;&gt; but um it's just that at this time,
[33:01] well, the end of the year is a time
[33:03] where a lot of people get time off work,
[33:06] a lot of people get to spend time with
[33:08] family, get to connect with loved ones,
[33:12] and reflect on their performance in the
[33:15] past year and make decisions and make
[33:19] resolutions. ions just decide on how
[33:22] they can improve on what is passed.
[33:27] And so um when I asked I thought I
[33:31] should say something about uh
[33:34] uh decisions and resolutions
[33:38] specifically the choice or the decision
[33:41] to follow Jesus Christ. And so I want to
[33:45] title it, as you can see, the choice for
[33:49] Christ. The choice for Christ.
[33:53] So hopefully this I I I'm hoping that
[33:58] it'll not take too long.
[34:02] And so um the choice for Christ, yes,
[34:06] is that many times when we decide to
[34:08] follow the Lord Jesus Christ or in the
[34:12] course of our life for the Lord Jesus
[34:14] Christ, we always have a point or a
[34:17] place where we go back to. We always
[34:20] have a time
[34:22] uh an event or
[34:25] a particular instant where we know that
[34:27] this is where we give our life to the
[34:29] Lord Jesus Christ.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this may be something that
[34:35] maybe it's been a year, it's been 10
[34:38] years, 20 years, we always go back to
[34:41] that. And that is fine to have such an
[34:44] anchor in life. But what is happening is
[34:47] that we often fail to see that to
[34:50] deciding to live for the Lord Jesus
[34:52] Christ is a continuous decision.
[34:56] that descending deciding to live for the
[34:58] Lord Jesus Christ is a commitment that
[35:01] we make every day and that when you say
[35:05] I am living for Christ it means that for
[35:08] every time you have to make a decision
[35:11] you are choosing the Lord's way.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; You are choosing the sight of the Lord.
[35:16] And so when we get to that place, when
[35:20] we get to that understanding, when we
[35:22] know that over and over again every day,
[35:24] we will choose the Lord again,
[35:27] &gt;&gt; now we are in a relationship.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Now we are looking for the will of our
[35:32] partner.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Now we are looking for the desires of
[35:35] our partner. And what happens is as we
[35:37] do that
[35:39] because a lot of times
[35:42] the desires and the wills are not
[35:44] automatically the same in an instant.
[35:47] But as we suppress our will, as we
[35:50] suppress our desires, as we
[35:54] do the will of the one we have invited,
[35:57] &gt;&gt; amen,
[35:58] &gt;&gt; then the decisions become his. Now don't
[36:00] get me wrong, he will never take your
[36:02] decision away from you.
[36:06] because he he never takes your will
[36:08] away. But when you suppress your will
[36:10] and you suppress your will and you
[36:12] suppress your will and you are always
[36:14] doing what he wants, what happens is
[36:16] that you are killing the old man.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; You are killing you.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; And as you kill you, he leaves.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; So the less of you, the more of him.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. It's like
[36:31] when you see um like any young lady they
[36:35] are born they grow up they have a place
[36:38] they call home where mom and dad is but
[36:40] a point comes where something happens
[36:43] and suddenly they've moved from home and
[36:46] they living in another person's home and
[36:49] suddenly even they all home when they go
[36:51] there they are received as if they are
[36:53] visitors. What has happened? They are
[36:56] married. The points of reference has
[36:58] shifted. everything has changed. Praise
[37:01] the name of the Lord. And so this is
[37:04] some of the things that um I'm I'm
[37:07] beginning to look at that the decisions
[37:09] that we take for the Lord is not a one
[37:11] day decision.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; The decisions that we take for the Lord
[37:15] is not an instant decision and that is
[37:18] it. No, it's a continuous thing. And it
[37:21] is even not necessarily our decision
[37:24] because when he comes in, he comes in to
[37:26] rule. When he comes in, he comes in to
[37:29] reign in our hearts.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Let's understand it this way that if
[37:34] he's not ruling, he's not there.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; The Lord doesn't come and wait and see,
[37:39] oh, maybe you, but no,
[37:41] &gt;&gt; if he's not ruling, he's not there at
[37:43] all.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; And like the scripture says, he who has
[37:46] not the spirit of the Lord is not his.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; And so, these are things that we have to
[37:50] consider. And maybe some of these things
[37:53] may sound a little firm, but understand
[37:56] it.
[37:59] um that is what is on my heart and so
[38:01] that is how uh I think I'll the only
[38:05] option for me
[38:06] &gt;&gt; right
[38:09] &gt;&gt; now recently I had to talk to the young
[38:12] people
[38:14] and my choice was the rich the rich
[38:16] young ruler
[38:18] and so I I just want to read uh Mark 10
[38:22] and maybe start from there
[38:26] Um there won't be too many reading today
[38:31] but um
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Mark 10:17.
[38:38] Now, in talking about the rich young
[38:42] ruler,
[38:43] I realized that we we covered quite a
[38:45] bit um then
[38:48] and we sort of
[38:51] hinted at some of the other things, but
[38:53] there was just one aspect that I wanted
[38:56] us to read and then um sort of go along
[39:00] that way. So, I'm reading Mark 10. I'm
[39:04] reading from verse 17.
[39:07] And when he was gone forth into the way,
[39:10] there came one running and kneel to him
[39:14] and asked him, "Good master, what shall
[39:17] I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
[39:20] And Jesus said unto him, "Why callst
[39:22] thou me good? There is none good but
[39:24] one, that is God.
[39:27] Thou knowest the commandments. Do not
[39:29] commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not
[39:32] steal. Do not bear false witness.
[39:34] Defraud not. Honor thy father and
[39:36] mother. And he answered and said unto
[39:39] him, Master, all these have I observed
[39:42] from my youth. Then Jesus beholding him
[39:46] loved him and said unto him, One thing
[39:49] thou lackest. Go thy way, sell
[39:52] whatsoever thou has and give to the
[39:54] poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
[39:56] heaven, and come, take up the cross, and
[39:59] follow me." And he was sad at the
[40:02] saying, and went away grieved, for he
[40:05] had great possessions.
[40:10] I think I'll stop here. Amen.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[40:15] And so,
[40:17] decision- making is very important.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Now what we don't see here but if you
[40:25] follow the message you know is that with
[40:27] just this one
[40:30] decision this man has changed his
[40:32] eternal destination.
[40:34] One decision his eternal his eternal
[40:38] destination is changed
[40:41] and we all have decisions to make. And
[40:44] what I'm saying here is it's not the
[40:47] decision to say I accept you Lord as my
[40:49] personal savior. No, this man has done
[40:51] that already. In fact, he has done that
[40:53] from his youth.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; My my
[40:58] &gt;&gt; and he has been good at it.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; But here we are. We find ourselves in a
[41:02] special situation. And so
[41:06] I'll read one quote from brother Abraham
[41:08] and sort of um go with it because it
[41:12] says that every two seconds
[41:16] we make a decision.
[41:23] Oh great. Every two second we make a
[41:27] decision. And so they say in a to in a
[41:30] in a day we make about 35,000 decisions
[41:34] and then they say more than 90 95% is
[41:38] automatic
[41:40] but the other ones are what we are
[41:42] talking about now at Kadesh Barnea uh
[41:46] 1956. Now Kadesh for the younger ones is
[41:49] where
[41:51] uh the people of Israel in their journey
[41:54] to Egypt. Kadesh was practically the
[41:57] last point because before they cross to
[41:59] the promised land. So Kadesh is the
[42:02] other side of Jordan just before they
[42:04] cross over and a lot of things happened
[42:06] there. That's where they sent for the
[42:07] spies and many other things. So when you
[42:10] cross to the other side you at Gilgal
[42:12] and when you are here you at at Kadesh.
[42:15] And so anyway,
[42:17] you've got a decision to make. Abraham
[42:19] says, "You are at Kadesh. You see, can't
[42:23] stand much longer. Why you halting
[42:27] between two opinions? Why isn't the
[42:29] church on fire? Why isn't the place
[42:31] packed
[42:32] &gt;&gt; out with people? Why isn't great signs
[42:35] and wonders done? Don't lay it onto the
[42:37] pastor. It's you."
[42:39] &gt;&gt; We got mixed attitude. one pulling one
[42:42] way and one the other. You've got to
[42:45] come to a time of decision.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; So, we all know that this rich young
[42:55] ruler, he lived a blessed life.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; And that's because he chose to live his
[43:01] life for Christ. [snorts]
[43:04] And he chose to do that from his youth.
[43:07] And so when you see that he's young,
[43:10] he's in authority and he's rich, that is
[43:13] the blessing of the Lord.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Because you never take a decide in your
[43:19] heart to live a righteous life for the
[43:21] Lord and it will be in vain.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[43:24] &gt;&gt; It never happens.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; No. If that life is righteous, the Lord
[43:28] vindicates it.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; He's the Lord who watches over his word
[43:32] to perform it. And the way he watches
[43:34] over his word is not in this Bible. No,
[43:37] he's looking at men.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; And whenever he sees his word, he
[43:42] confirms that that is his word.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; And so this man lived a blessed life. He
[43:50] was a righteous man.
[43:52] But you see, when you make a choice for
[43:56] Christ,
[43:57] what is happening is that you are
[44:00] choosing all the blessings that comes
[44:01] with it. Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; When you make a choice for Christ, you
[44:06] are choosing life
[44:07] &gt;&gt; because he's the author of life.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; A choice for Christ, you are choosing
[44:12] peace because he's the prince of peace.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; It may not be not be as the world sees
[44:17] peace.
[44:20] But before God, you have chosen peace.
[44:22] You have chosen victory because he has
[44:25] gone ahead already. This journey is
[44:28] already known before God.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; He's gone ahead already. He's won the
[44:32] victory. He's handed it back to us and
[44:34] we're walking through it.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; So a choice for the Lord is so many
[44:40] more. Now what is in is important is
[44:44] what I've told is that understanding
[44:45] that the choice for Christ is not a
[44:47] singular choice
[44:50] and it's not something that you make at
[44:52] one time and then you are done. No, the
[44:55] real decision for Christ is a decision
[44:58] to live for him every day of our lives.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; And even within the day as well.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; And so when you wake up, you wake up,
[45:10] you are alive. Glory to God. You praise
[45:12] him. You are beginning the day, Lord,
[45:15] guide me and help me.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; You are going to work Lord use me for
[45:20] your purpose. Yes.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; You come home. Glory to God. Family is
[45:24] home.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; You're going to church.
[45:27] Anticipate
[45:29] &gt;&gt; that you are going to the house of the
[45:30] Lord.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Go under expectation. Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; You see, this is something that a lot of
[45:40] times I think of that we can go to the
[45:44] mayor's office or his house
[45:48] and we're not going to letter there.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; We're not going to draw pieces of paper
[45:53] there. We can go to Trudeau's house and
[45:56] well the other person and we're not
[45:58] going to put leave things there.
[46:01] When we come with that attitude of
[46:03] reverence, honoring the sanctity of the
[46:06] sanctuary,
[46:08] it means that we understand who we are
[46:10] coming to meet with
[46:12] &gt;&gt; and that expectation
[46:14] gives us the benefit of what we came
[46:16] for.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Because when we don't have that
[46:20] attitude, we miss a lot.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; The thing is still coming, but it passes
[46:25] over our head.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I'm saying that, I'm
[46:28] thinking of a lot of brethren that I see
[46:31] here pitching in, helping their wives.
[46:34] And I give God glory for all of you
[46:38] because that was me not long ago.
[46:41] And it seemed like that was all I will
[46:43] do and it will never end.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; But you see, important things happen
[46:48] through that.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Understand that. If you're a man, you're
[46:53] responsible for everything. Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you should do everything,
[46:57] but you're responsible for everything.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Not everything is your fault, but you're
[47:01] still responsible.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; And so pitching in is that it's the best
[47:08] way you can pass on knowledge to your
[47:11] children.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; They look at it, they see it, and they
[47:15] learn from it.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; They understand what happens when mom
[47:20] and dad are doing this. It comes to my
[47:21] benefit. and they learn to also benefit
[47:24] from this.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; I've been here
[47:30] and I've seen a person and I hope I'm
[47:34] not talking about any individual here
[47:37] present. So it's many years ago talking
[47:40] with pride. Oh yeah. If if I come to
[47:42] church, it's it's your it's your duty.
[47:44] You the lady, it's your duty. Me I'm
[47:46] coming to do my duty is the word of God.
[47:47] And I'm thinking who is the head of that
[47:49] family,
[47:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:52] So you the head wants to still come and
[47:54] feed and she should just keep on
[47:56] laboring. That's it.
[47:59] And so anyway, I don't know where how I
[48:02] I went that way, but this is key that in
[48:06] life, everything we do, we make it a
[48:10] point to choose Christ.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Now, you have to understand that
[48:18] people throughout history who have done
[48:21] well have chosen Christ.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; And [laughter] and that's before Christ
[48:26] ever came on earth.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Because from the Garden of Eden till
[48:30] now, Christ has always been in every
[48:32] age.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; The word for your day revealed is
[48:36] Christ.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; And so go through scriptures. Everybody
[48:42] who has done well that we read about has
[48:45] chosen Christ.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; And it's been their life.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; It's not a decision they made and they
[48:50] okay they are part of a group. No,
[48:53] &gt;&gt; that is not it. Praise the name of the
[48:56] Lord.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; And so this man lived right. Brother
[49:02] Abraham tells us that he grew up in a
[49:04] good house. The parents taught him
[49:07] right. But the outstanding thing about
[49:10] him and I believe that uh it's the
[49:12] reality of most people
[49:16] was that [snorts] in spite of all what
[49:19] he had believed he knew that he lacked
[49:21] something.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; He knew that he did not have eternal
[49:25] life.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. And then
[49:29] two things are in his favor. One is he
[49:32] understood that he had a luck and the
[49:34] second thing is he knew the source to go
[49:36] to.
[49:38] And that is very important.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Now consider the environment in which he
[49:43] was so that you will understand what I'm
[49:45] talking about. That this man could have
[49:48] chosen a rabbi somewhere
[49:50] &gt;&gt; and there were many of those in those
[49:52] days.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; He could have gone to the temple.
[49:56] He could have gone to a synagogue. He
[49:58] could have gone to the the high priest.
[50:00] But he chose to go to the Lord Jesus
[50:02] Christ. Hallelujah. And so he knew the
[50:05] source to go. And so two things were
[50:08] very important and they were in his
[50:11] favor.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Now look at his approach. He came, he
[50:15] knelt down.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; He had the right approach.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; He went to the right source.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; He lived a right life. But all of that
[50:26] did not benefit him because he lacked
[50:29] the right intent.
[50:33] And that right intent is the choice for
[50:36] Christ. [snorts]
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; So he comes, he speaks to the Lord Jesus
[50:44] Christ and Jesus tells him
[50:49] [sighs]
[50:52] go and obey all the laws.
[50:55] And then he says, I have obeyed from my
[50:58] childhood.
[51:00] Isn't that beautiful? This man had a lot
[51:03] going for him.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; He had much to be proud of
[51:12] to have lived that. I know I cannot say
[51:15] that before the Lord Jesus Christ. But
[51:18] what is happening is that he said it and
[51:20] it was the truth. Why? Because that was
[51:22] God on earth. This is the discerner of
[51:25] hearts and discernment of thoughts and
[51:27] intents of the heart.
[51:30] and he stood there and he looked at him,
[51:32] the Bible says, and he loved him.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; The man was not telling lies. He loved
[51:39] him. He didn't say, "Oh, shut up. Get
[51:41] get thee from behind me or anything like
[51:44] that." No, he loved him. And this is
[51:46] where we have to see something again
[51:49] that there's a very important
[51:51] distinction between love of the love of
[51:54] God and the blessing of God.
[51:57] Yeah.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times we mix them up.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; But understand, the love of God will
[52:04] always lead you into salvation.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; That is the love of God.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; The love of God. Look at the apostles.
[52:15] Somebody was
[52:17] uh uh crucified head down.
[52:21] That was part of the love of God.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody was sworn as sand. That was
[52:27] part of it.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; In fact, the scripture speaks of one uh
[52:31] John, it says the one whom the Lord
[52:33] loves.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; He was boiled in oil.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; That was love.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Because the love of God will bring you
[52:41] to fulfill the purpose of God.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; And I remember brother Gary Walker here
[52:46] saying that if you knew all of it,
[52:49] you'll volunteer for it.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; So he does not take you out of it. He
[52:55] strengthens you to go through it.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; That is the love of God.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, he blessed Solomon riches and
[53:04] everything. He blessed David. Glory to
[53:06] God. Those are blessings and they are
[53:08] good.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; But when you hear about
[53:13] we as humans mocking him and beating him
[53:18] and hanging him on the cross and all of
[53:20] that, that was the love.
[53:23] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; And so he laughed him.
[53:28] And when he laughed him, what he did was
[53:32] he revealed what he lacked.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; That is love.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Solomon says love is corrective.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; So that kind of love is not very
[53:42] Canadian,
[53:44] &gt;&gt; right? Because here what we have to do
[53:45] is be nice, be gentle, and don't say
[53:48] anything and say, "Oh, things to improve
[53:50] upon."
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[53:54] But the Lord Jesus Christ loved him. And
[53:56] when he loved him, he said, "One thing
[53:58] thou lstest." And in another part, in
[54:01] another uh version of the story, he
[54:04] says, "If thou must be perfect,
[54:07] &gt;&gt; then he goes on,
[54:09] he says, go sell all what you have, give
[54:13] it to the poor, and come follow me."
[54:20] That is the difficult part.
[54:22] The Bible says he left there grieved
[54:26] because he had great possession.
[54:31] Now I know the question of riches come
[54:34] up
[54:36] because further down the line Jesus
[54:38] actually said, "Oh, how hardly is it for
[54:40] uh a rich man to enter into heaven
[54:44] or into the kingdom of God?"
[54:47] And the Bible says the disciples were
[54:49] astonished.
[54:52] And so Jesus had to clarify it. He says,
[54:54] "No, no, no. I mean those who trust in
[54:56] riches."
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Now trust look, you can even be poor and
[55:02] trust in riches,
[55:05] &gt;&gt; right? And so he clarified that those
[55:07] who trust in riches, but still why did
[55:12] he make the decision for Christ
[55:14] and not or he made the decision for his
[55:17] possessions and not for Christ,
[55:19] &gt;&gt; right? His
[55:22] possessions got in the way of his faith.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; His riches got in the way of his faith.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; His position got in the way of faith.
[55:35] Hallelujah.
[55:36] So that a man who had lived a righteous
[55:39] life. A man who had been blessed as a
[55:42] result
[55:44] failed to enter into eternal life. Why?
[55:48] He did not place the giver of the
[55:50] blessings above the blessings.
[55:53] Instead, he made the blessings above the
[55:56] giver. Now, these blessings did not come
[55:58] from the devil.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; It came from God.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; It's our attitude.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; It's how we view them. It's how we cling
[56:07] to them.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; That is what can become a problem in the
[56:10] life of a believer.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:16] I will read this quote. Investment
[56:25] 63 investment says wonder if your
[56:28] stewardship of the church the
[56:30] organization is great enough to you this
[56:33] morning that you will turn away from it.
[56:39] same uh some of you men who belong to
[56:43] churches and sitting here this morning
[56:45] as businessmen. Think of it. The rich
[56:49] young ruler was presented that
[56:53] and turned it down and Christ turns and
[56:56] said the church age will do the same
[56:59] thing this last days.
[57:02] Now what this was in August 63. So he
[57:06] had just finished uh preaching
[57:08] indictment
[57:10] and now this is what he's saying. So the
[57:12] indictment wasn't just for the
[57:14] geographic location of uh United States
[57:18] but it was for the generation.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Let's think about it and understand how
[57:24] privileged we are.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the of the Lord.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he says Christ and said
[57:31] the church age will do the same thing in
[57:34] the last days. Now it's in Chicago
[57:38] now that you are faced to make a
[57:42] decision. The time is running out.
[57:45] I wonder what time it is. If in 1963 the
[57:49] time is running out says you must do it
[57:52] at once. make your decision for Christ
[57:57] to be born of a spirit. Now we find out
[58:01] that this rich man did this because that
[58:04] he loved the world.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; He loved his fellowship with his
[58:09] organization more than he loved the
[58:11] fellowship with the Lord Jesus.
[58:15] Now, if you see how he started, he said
[58:17] that there were some of the men sitting
[58:19] down there at the businessman meeting
[58:21] and now he's bringing this up. And so,
[58:24] it's for us all. This was not just for
[58:27] them. It's for us today.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Now, we may find many examples in the
[58:33] Bible where people lean towards their
[58:37] possessions and their resources
[58:40] than their faith. In essence, they allow
[58:43] these things to come in between them and
[58:46] their God. And what happens is that the
[58:48] outcome has always
[58:51] been disastrous,
[58:54] irreversible harm. Sometimes the eternal
[58:57] destination has changed as a result of
[59:01] that.
[59:03] Consider the wife of Lot.
[59:05] It was the same circumstance.
[59:08] Now remember this lady is not her name
[59:10] is not even mentioned in the Bible. We
[59:13] just said it's the wife of Lord. But
[59:16] there was nothing said about her being
[59:18] disobedient, being proud, being
[59:20] arrogant. No, not in the Bible. Nothing
[59:24] at all.
[59:26] And this man was married, this lady was
[59:28] married to a a a godly man.
[59:34] But we find in an instant
[59:38] that she's out of Sodom. She's walking
[59:42] or riding away. But her house is
[59:45] burning.
[59:46] All her possessions are burning.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; If she has slaves, they were burning.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; The community where she has lived is
[59:53] burning. Her neighbors are burning. Her
[59:57] in-laws are burning.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And what it she did was just turn around
[1:00:02] once.
[1:00:04] That was it.
[1:00:06] Now, I don't think it's the fire that
[1:00:08] did that, but it's the disobedience to
[1:00:10] the word of God.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; And so, the closer we get to the Lord,
[1:00:16] the more careful we ought to be.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Now, we often talk about her her Lord's
[1:00:22] wife.
[1:00:24] But have you considered the situation of
[1:00:26] Lot himself
[1:00:28] and the children
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; that you are walking? You all have the
[1:00:34] same instruction. And because mom turned
[1:00:38] around, she's become a pillar of salt.
[1:00:41] And so you cannot turn around even to
[1:00:43] look at mom. You cannot turn around even
[1:00:46] to look at your wife.
[1:00:49] You just have to keep going. That is the
[1:00:52] situation that her disobedience plays
[1:00:55] her family.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Let's think about these things. When you
[1:01:00] are part of a collective, don't think
[1:01:02] that you own your decision. I'm a my own
[1:01:05] man. I'm a grown up. I'm my own lady. I
[1:01:07] can do what I want. No.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; You are part of a collective
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; and your actions affect others.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; So, let's consider these things. Praise
[1:01:21] the name of the Lord.
[1:01:26] But now
[1:01:28] I'm hope you appreciate how difficult it
[1:01:30] is and how they had to go through. Now
[1:01:32] if a person does not have in their mind
[1:01:36] already in their soul already that no
[1:01:39] matter what I'll make a choice for
[1:01:41] Christ who can live this
[1:01:45] who can live this and that is why we
[1:01:46] need him every day. That's why we need
[1:01:49] to stay focused. That is why we don't
[1:01:52] need to allow ourselves to be distracted
[1:01:54] by frivolities. Sorry, I have to say it
[1:01:57] as it is
[1:02:00] because these things they drain us.
[1:02:02] These things they take away from us
[1:02:06] when we are supposed to be focused on we
[1:02:08] don't we shouldn't think that oh yeah I
[1:02:09] made a decision so I'm okay all is well.
[1:02:13] Faith is something else.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Faith is the understanding that this is
[1:02:19] my life. The word is my life.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; That is faith.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; It's not, oh yeah, I can do whatever I
[1:02:26] want. I'm going. No.
[1:02:29] That is turning grace against grace.
[1:02:35] So no matter who we are,
[1:02:38] without the grace of the Lord,
[1:02:39] situations will arise that bring out
[1:02:43] what is in us.
[1:02:47] She could not part completely with her
[1:02:49] belongings. And I personally understand
[1:02:51] it. It's it's not easy like that.
[1:02:54] And because of that, she missed eternal
[1:02:57] life.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; It's the same way with the rich young
[1:03:00] ruler.
[1:03:02] And what we have to realize is that
[1:03:04] these are not people who don't know God.
[1:03:07] No, these are people who know the Lord.
[1:03:09] They have lived for him. They have
[1:03:12] served him. But they still have to s
[1:03:15] face up with a situation where they have
[1:03:17] to make a choice.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And they failed to make the choice for
[1:03:22] Christ.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; They were believers.
[1:03:29] They had chosen the Lord's way over and
[1:03:32] over.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; But at this point, they failed.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, that was the final one.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:40] Right?
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; So what I'm saying is brothers and
[1:03:43] sisters, as long as we are in this life,
[1:03:46] we are going to have to make some of
[1:03:48] these decisions.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And we have to, you see, the decision
[1:03:53] shouldn't be today I'm deciding for
[1:03:54] Christ.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; The decision should be that no matter
[1:03:58] what happens, for the rest of my life,
[1:04:00] I'm making a decision for him.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; It may sound ridiculous. I'm making a
[1:04:08] decision anyway.
[1:04:12] It may sound odd. It may sound strange.
[1:04:14] You may not be able to even explain.
[1:04:17] But I think for the believer, the best
[1:04:18] explanation for your actions is the Lord
[1:04:21] says so.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; That's the only way and that's the best.
[1:04:28] Hallelujah.
[1:04:30] So you see if there is something in the
[1:04:32] past,
[1:04:35] if there is something that we know and
[1:04:37] we see and we think that it can get
[1:04:39] between us and our Lord,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; we think that it can weigh us down, get
[1:04:43] rid of it before it holds you back.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; If it will get in your way, get rid of
[1:04:50] it before it holds you back.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:58] So all what I want to say is that if you
[1:05:00] have any resolution,
[1:05:03] it should be to choose the Lord Jesus
[1:05:05] Christ over and over again.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:12] Let's consider Paul for a moment.
[1:05:17] In Philippians, Paul calls himself a
[1:05:19] Hebrew of the Hebrew.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; In Acts of the Apostles, he calls
[1:05:23] himself uh
[1:05:27] a Pharisee of the Pharisee.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "Concerning the righteousness
[1:05:31] of the law, I'm blameless.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; The man was in line to be the next high
[1:05:38] priest."
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; The man had Roman citizenship.
[1:05:43] Not only that, he spoke the Roman
[1:05:45] language.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; He was an academic. He was an
[1:05:48] intellectual.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; He had every resource he needed to play
[1:05:54] the role, whatever role it was given to
[1:05:57] him.
[1:05:58] What does he say? He said all those
[1:06:01] things which were gain account loss
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; when he met the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. because all of those things and
[1:06:10] hey, what is wrong with being in line to
[1:06:12] be a high priest?
[1:06:15] What is wrong with being a Pharisee of a
[1:06:17] Pharisee? What is wrong with being a
[1:06:20] Hebrew of a Hebrew? All of that. There's
[1:06:23] nothing wrong with it. And so, think
[1:06:25] about it carefully. When something
[1:06:27] comes, oh, what is wrong? Where is that
[1:06:29] in the Bible? Think again.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Consider it because it's something that
[1:06:34] can get in your way.
[1:06:37] This rich young ruler
[1:06:40] if he had actually obeyed the laws from
[1:06:42] his childhood then even his riches were
[1:06:44] not ill gotten not a scam he actually
[1:06:47] worked hard for it and the Lord blessed
[1:06:49] him but it still got in his way.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; So let's have let's be in that mode that
[1:06:56] will always make every decision for the
[1:07:00] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:08] Now, let's consider the children of
[1:07:10] Israel.
[1:07:15] Joshua 24. These are the people that
[1:07:17] Joshua is talking to.
[1:07:20] They were people of God. They were
[1:07:23] called of God. They were delivered from
[1:07:26] Egypt.
[1:07:29] And when they heard the message, they
[1:07:32] made a choice for Christ. They made a
[1:07:34] choice to believe it. But now they
[1:07:37] didn't believe it and just, "Oh yeah, I
[1:07:39] believe it. It's true." No. When they
[1:07:41] believed it, they put them into action.
[1:07:44] They left uh uh uh Ramses and Pitts, all
[1:07:47] those cities that they were building and
[1:07:49] went to go.
[1:07:51] But that was just the beginning. If they
[1:07:53] had believed it, then watch what they
[1:07:56] going to do now. They're going to take
[1:07:57] blood and paint their doorpost.
[1:08:01] How do you explain that to anybody?
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; But that was the call. But that was also
[1:08:06] just the beginning. They are going to go
[1:08:09] to these people and ask for jewelry.
[1:08:12] People of citizens of this empire, they
[1:08:15] were slaves.
[1:08:17] But they went and ask for jewelry. And
[1:08:20] then they start following an old man,
[1:08:23] defying an empire
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; with the strongest army. And they are
[1:08:27] following an old man.
[1:08:32] Not just that, [snorts]
[1:08:34] there's a straight path. They could have
[1:08:36] gone straight east across Sinan
[1:08:39] Peninsula. No, they went south all the
[1:08:42] way to the Red Sea.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Don't ask me to explain it.
[1:08:48] And then they go all the way and they
[1:08:50] get to h the Red Sea. And now they are
[1:08:54] stuck.
[1:08:58] They are stuck because there is mountain
[1:09:00] here, mountain here, sea ahead and the
[1:09:02] Egyptians are coming.
[1:09:05] Now the Egyptians had the same
[1:09:07] opportunity that Israel had. They heard
[1:09:11] the same gospel that Moses preached.
[1:09:14] Yes, some of them they were on the on
[1:09:16] the on the losing side, but even that
[1:09:20] they had the opportunity to believe
[1:09:23] because they experience the
[1:09:24] supernatural. At the beginning of the
[1:09:26] plague, some of them will listen and go
[1:09:28] and take their their cattle away from
[1:09:30] from from the field and their cattle
[1:09:33] won't suffer. So they knew that this was
[1:09:36] true. They saw the supernatural. They
[1:09:38] experienced the supernatural.
[1:09:41] But what happened? They rejected the
[1:09:43] supernatural.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; They thought it was not in their favor.
[1:09:47] How can we lose these slaves? Well,
[1:09:49] guess what? You are going to lose your
[1:09:52] land. You are going to lose your cattle.
[1:09:55] You are going to lose even the
[1:09:57] environment. It will be stinking. You
[1:09:59] are going to lose your water. You are
[1:10:01] going to lose your ferrisbones.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; So, they had the same opportunity,
[1:10:08] but they rejected the supernatural. And
[1:10:11] when they rejected the supernatural,
[1:10:12] they not only did that, they turned
[1:10:14] around and persecuted those who are
[1:10:16] believed.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; They turned around and are going after
[1:10:20] them.
[1:10:22] You see the situation?
[1:10:24] I'll read this quickly. Power of
[1:10:26] decision.
[1:10:28] Brother Abraham says,
[1:10:33] "If you notice this grateful host of
[1:10:35] Pharaoh who had seen the supernatural
[1:10:37] done and they disbelieved it, they shut
[1:10:40] up their compassion to it. They rejected
[1:10:43] it and they started out to even slay the
[1:10:46] ones that God was working with." A bit a
[1:10:50] beautiful type of what's going to happen
[1:10:52] in America one of these days.
[1:10:56] Watch that.
[1:10:58] So they not only rejected it but they
[1:11:01] persecuted those who have chosen it.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Praise the name of the
[1:11:07] Lord. Now if Israel had not followed
[1:11:11] Moses
[1:11:12] to that point which seemed ridiculous,
[1:11:17] how were they going to know that God can
[1:11:19] open the sea?
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; That they slaves
[1:11:24] they had no military training. They were
[1:11:27] mad dobers.
[1:11:29] They could walk through the sea on dry
[1:11:32] land.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; But not just that, they will witness the
[1:11:35] complete destruction of the strongest
[1:11:37] army on earth.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; But they had to make the right decision
[1:11:42] for Christ first.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; This is what I'm saying. Sometimes there
[1:11:46] are so many other options that are
[1:11:48] logical.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; After all, he's sending us to Egypt. We
[1:11:52] can just go this is this is a shorter
[1:11:54] route. Why should we go all that way?
[1:11:57] God says so.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; That should be good enough for the
[1:12:00] believer.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; We all know the story of Daniel.
[1:12:09] He had to take a stand. And he had to
[1:12:11] take a stand at the risk of his life.
[1:12:15] And when he took that stand and kept
[1:12:17] praying when he wasn't supposed to and
[1:12:19] had the windows open towards the east,
[1:12:22] that is when he got arrested.
[1:12:24] A lot of times you know
[1:12:28] we do something maybe we are wrong here
[1:12:30] and there we say oh yeah Lord you are
[1:12:32] the one who who opened the sea for for
[1:12:36] yeah they did but they followed the Lord
[1:12:38] to that point.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Daniel obeyed the Lord the Lord to that
[1:12:43] point
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; and because of that he was dropped in
[1:12:47] there.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; You see when you obey God fully you
[1:12:51] become his responsibility.
[1:12:53] Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And that is what [clears throat] we are
[1:12:57] called to do.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; The Hebrew children is the same way.
[1:13:02] The was even
[1:13:05] more radical. They said, "Kin live
[1:13:08] forever. Even if he will not deliver us,
[1:13:11] we will still not bow."
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; So that decision they have made from
[1:13:15] their childhood or whenever they
[1:13:17] accepted the Lord or they believed on
[1:13:19] the Lord is carrying them through. And
[1:13:22] part of that is that no matter the
[1:13:24] threat from the king,
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; even they looking at the fire or they
[1:13:28] looking at whatever destruction is
[1:13:30] coming on them. Glory to God. For us, we
[1:13:33] love you. We'll respect you. We'll do
[1:13:35] what we want, but we shall not bow.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; That is the decision for Christ.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; And that is what we are called to do. If
[1:13:44] you want to see exploits in your life,
[1:13:46] if you want to see the Lord manifest
[1:13:48] himself in your life, these are the
[1:13:50] things we're supposed to do. take a
[1:13:51] stand for him and not yield under any
[1:13:54] circumstance.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; And so to even venture into the Red Sea
[1:14:04] on dry land, it was a choice of
[1:14:07] obedience to Moses.
[1:14:10] And we can say we know how many times
[1:14:13] and instances they had to either make a
[1:14:16] choice for themselves and what is
[1:14:18] logical or make a choice for the Lord.
[1:14:21] And we know the outcomes.
[1:14:24] A lot of times the outcomes were not
[1:14:25] good. People died when they chose a
[1:14:30] golden calf. People died when they
[1:14:33] listened to Balam's deception and went
[1:14:35] for a party.
[1:14:37] people died when they looked at their
[1:14:40] circumstances. Oh, we don't have meat
[1:14:42] and whatever and and murmured. There
[1:14:44] were instances where people even uh uh
[1:14:47] um serpents even came in. You see, they
[1:14:50] had gotten closer. The Lord was
[1:14:53] revealing himself to them.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; And so, the closer you get to the Lord,
[1:14:59] the more we have to learn his ways and
[1:15:01] live for him.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. because he also loves the
[1:15:05] opportunity
[1:15:07] to manifest himself in our lives.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; He loves to do it more than we want to
[1:15:12] see it.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; It's just that we've not taken out our
[1:15:15] stand completely. When we wholly follow
[1:15:18] him, he wholly stands in for us.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Now all these people Joshua address in
[1:15:27] the scripture
[1:15:29] that we read,
[1:15:31] I think they made the right choices.
[1:15:34] That is why they are there where they
[1:15:36] are.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Either them or their parents made the
[1:15:40] right choices.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; But at Kesh Baneer,
[1:15:47] Israel was faced with one of the most
[1:15:50] important tests in all their journey.
[1:15:53] And I believe the Lord permitted it to
[1:15:55] purge unbelief. The Lord permitted it to
[1:15:59] purge
[1:16:00] the desire for Egypt, the desire for
[1:16:04] slavery, the desire for the the things
[1:16:06] of the world because he knew that in the
[1:16:10] promised land they were going to deal
[1:16:11] with him on the basis of faith and not
[1:16:14] reason.
[1:16:16] And so they send these um
[1:16:20] spies, they go, they look out the land.
[1:16:23] And 10 of them did not tell a lie.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; They came back and said, "Yes, we saw
[1:16:29] these giants. Oh, man. We cannot stand
[1:16:31] them. Oh, these friends cities. Oh, they
[1:16:34] are great. We've never seen any like
[1:16:35] that before."
[1:16:37] Those were real. They were not lies. But
[1:16:41] you see the difference is that before
[1:16:43] Caleb and Joshua would go, they had the
[1:16:45] word of God in their hearts.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And so when they went, all they were
[1:16:50] looking for is confirmation of the word.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. All other things meant nothing.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; If you look at their report, they did
[1:16:56] not even mention the giants.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; They just came talking about the Lord
[1:17:01] and the Lord. And look at the proof.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Look at these grapes. Oh, it's
[1:17:05] wonderful.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Right. And those who believe the other,
[1:17:11] the Bible calls it evil reports.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; They also got their share. They face the
[1:17:18] wrath of the Lord.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. And I'm just going to uh read it
[1:17:22] quickly. Um hopefully I have it here.
[1:17:27] Yes, Deuteronomy 1.
[1:17:31] I'll read it and then um I'm just
[1:17:34] getting ready to to to to finish. Like I
[1:17:36] said, today I'm trying to be good.
[1:17:41] Deuteronomy 1:34
[1:17:45] the Bible says and the Lord heard the
[1:17:48] voice of your words and was wroth and
[1:17:50] swear saying now the all of Deuteronomy
[1:17:54] 1 we cannot read it we don't have the
[1:17:56] time but all of Deuteronomy 1 talks
[1:17:58] about the things that had happened and
[1:18:00] how the Lord had come and how they had
[1:18:02] not been faithful and all that but at
[1:18:04] this point it says and the Lord heard
[1:18:05] the voice of your words and was wroth
[1:18:07] and swear saying surely they shall Not
[1:18:10] one of these men of this evil generation
[1:18:14] see the good land which I swear to give
[1:18:17] unto their fathers.
[1:18:19] Now there is something coming in here.
[1:18:20] You see that he swore to give to their
[1:18:23] fathers.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; And here they are about to inherit it.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Now no matter what I do, I can't shake
[1:18:31] that fatherhood thing. It's just it just
[1:18:34] keeps coming. It just keeps coming. like
[1:18:38] I'm I'm I'm learning so much and
[1:18:43] I don't want to say it scares me but
[1:18:46] it's it want it makes me say and I can
[1:18:48] say this categorically
[1:18:50] nobody
[1:18:52] can be a good father without the Holy
[1:18:54] Spirit
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; nobody it's impossible this is me and so
[1:19:00] I will stand by it if there is any issue
[1:19:03] here but what is happening is here
[1:19:08] that you see that he says the thing was
[1:19:10] made to the father. Anyway, let me keep
[1:19:12] going. Save Caleb the son of Japun. He
[1:19:15] shall see it and to him will I give the
[1:19:18] land that he had thrown in upon and to
[1:19:20] his children
[1:19:22] because he had wholly followed the Lord.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Now imagine how many right decisions
[1:19:30] these people had made one after the
[1:19:33] other. They made the radish one after
[1:19:34] the and then they get here and they get
[1:19:37] it wrong and God is saying they will
[1:19:39] never enter into the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Think about it again. There are how many
[1:19:44] times they had experienced the Lord
[1:19:48] and just one or two distractions giants
[1:19:51] giants who never did anything to them
[1:19:54] and and and world cities which they were
[1:19:57] going to inherit anyway. But those
[1:20:00] things distracted them and they went
[1:20:02] against the Lord and they made the wrong
[1:20:04] decision.
[1:20:09] Let's always decide for the Lord.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; So the Lord swears to give the land to
[1:20:16] Caleb and to his children.
[1:20:20] Why his children?
[1:20:23] The 12 who went, none of them went with
[1:20:25] their children. The children are not
[1:20:28] even mentioned in in those instances.
[1:20:31] So why suddenly
[1:20:35] God is promising and swearing actually
[1:20:38] to give it to him and his children for
[1:20:39] his faithfulness. So he is faithful and
[1:20:42] therefore he benefits and his children
[1:20:44] benefit.
[1:20:46] The influence of fathers on their
[1:20:48] children.
[1:20:51] My sister,
[1:20:53] it's always worthy to pray for that man.
[1:20:58] Whether it's your son, whether it's your
[1:21:01] brother, whether it's your mother, pray
[1:21:04] for them. Children, pray for your
[1:21:06] fathers.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Don't think it always has to be father
[1:21:09] for the children. No, pray for them.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Always don't forget if they do well, you
[1:21:15] will do well.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Pray for them. It's very important.
[1:21:23] Now I want to take a little time to
[1:21:25] mention an aspect
[1:21:29] of the decision
[1:21:32] study
[1:21:34] that struck me whilst I was preparing
[1:21:36] and that is Proverbs 4
[1:21:40] and it's it's it's so important to me
[1:21:45] when I started looking at it and
[1:21:47] understanding it
[1:21:49] and I be reading for one to maybe eight.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; It's about Solomon
[1:21:57] and the first thing Solomon sees from
[1:21:59] whoever is reading is give me your
[1:22:03] attention.
[1:22:05] That is something that's difficult to
[1:22:06] get these days,
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; But understanding in this case the
[1:22:10] children, we are all children.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; But he says, "Give me your attention."
[1:22:15] And then he starts. So I'm reading from
[1:22:17] 1 to 8. He says, "Hear ye children the
[1:22:20] instruction of a father and attend to no
[1:22:24] understanding."
[1:22:26] Now, it doesn't say the instructions
[1:22:30] of your father or their father, but it's
[1:22:33] a father. So, it could be coming from
[1:22:36] any experienced person in the father
[1:22:38] position.
[1:22:40] So it says the instruction of a father
[1:22:44] for I give you good doctrine. Forsake ye
[1:22:47] not my law.
[1:22:49] Now I love people who have no qualms
[1:22:52] about who they are. They know their
[1:22:54] position. They know their ministry. And
[1:22:56] he's telling it's good doctrine.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Just like Paul, he say be ye followers
[1:23:01] of me as I follow Christ.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; They they have no qualms. So it's up to
[1:23:06] us to decide to accept or reject. But he
[1:23:08] knows what he's given. He says good
[1:23:10] doctrine. For I was my father's son. Now
[1:23:15] watch that because he's talking about
[1:23:17] David now. And when he says I was, it
[1:23:20] means that when he was writing this,
[1:23:22] David has already passed on. I was my
[1:23:25] father's son, tender and only beloved in
[1:23:26] the sight of my mother. He taught me
[1:23:29] also and said unto me, let thine heart
[1:23:32] retain wisdom. In essence, pay attention
[1:23:37] and memorize these things that I'm
[1:23:38] telling you. It doesn't mean say your
[1:23:41] mind, your heart retain wisdom.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; So listen carefully. What is Solomon
[1:23:47] saying? I listen carefully and I want
[1:23:49] you to listen carefully to me now.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Remember it's David. That man who is uh
[1:23:56] after God's own heart. That man who
[1:23:58] understands what it is to fall from
[1:24:00] grace before the Lord. Who knows how is
[1:24:02] it to repent. Who know how to is it to
[1:24:05] have victories for the Lord?
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Who knows how it is to be exiled from
[1:24:09] his country? Who knows who has seen it
[1:24:12] all? And you will think that he will
[1:24:14] say, "Oh, well, get some good sword for
[1:24:17] battle and get some helmet and all." No,
[1:24:20] no, no, no, no. He's going to give him
[1:24:22] good stuff here.
[1:24:26] He taught me also and said unto me, "Let
[1:24:28] thine heart retain wisdom.
[1:24:32] Keep my commandment and live. Get
[1:24:35] wisdom, get understanding, forget it
[1:24:38] not. Neither decline from the words of
[1:24:42] my mouth. Forsake her not, and she shall
[1:24:46] preserve thee. Love her, and she shall
[1:24:48] keep thee. Wisdom is the principle
[1:24:51] thing. Therefore, get wisdom, and with
[1:24:53] all thy getting, get understanding.
[1:24:56] Exalt her, and she shall promote thee.
[1:25:01] Watch the things that he's passing on to
[1:25:03] a young Solomon. Get wisdom. Five.
[1:25:07] Wisdom is the principal thing. Seven.
[1:25:10] Therefore, get wisdom. He repeats it the
[1:25:12] second time.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; And and you see what the way he
[1:25:17] describes wisdom.
[1:25:19] It's either a great treasure or a lover.
[1:25:23] What what the words he use here?
[1:25:27] Forget it. Not forsake her not and she
[1:25:31] shall preserve thee.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Love her and she shall keep thee.
[1:25:36] Exalt her and she shall promote thee. I
[1:25:41] think it's good enough to think that
[1:25:42] this is like you know what a spouse or
[1:25:45] something right but this is what Solomon
[1:25:48] h David passes on to Solomon.
[1:25:52] And so in the heart of Solomon wisdom is
[1:25:56] number one. Wisdom is the most important
[1:25:59] thing. And so when the instant came when
[1:26:03] the Lord asked Solomon, "What do you
[1:26:05] want?"
[1:26:06] Understanding that because of what the
[1:26:08] father had passed on to him, he was
[1:26:11] prepared to give the right answer.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; He was in that disposition to give that
[1:26:17] right answer.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Now, if you go through the Bible, you
[1:26:21] won't see any other person giving that
[1:26:24] offer. Ask whatever you want and I'll
[1:26:27] give it to you. You won't find one.
[1:26:30] Right? Of course, in the message we can
[1:26:32] talk about the rights
[1:26:35] because she also got that that same
[1:26:37] thing. Right? But what I'm saying is
[1:26:40] that and this is me, but I believe that
[1:26:44] if your heart is in that disposition, it
[1:26:47] will invites a divine favor.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:51] When you are trained to desire the
[1:26:53] things of the Lord, the Lord will grant
[1:26:56] it.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Because look at this.
[1:26:59] The Lord actually told him, you could
[1:27:01] have asked for your the head of your
[1:27:02] enemies. You could have asked for
[1:27:04] riches. You could have asked for a long
[1:27:06] life.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; You didn't. You asked for this and so
[1:27:08] I'll give all of that to you.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; You see how it is? But that was from
[1:27:15] father to son. The seed was planted
[1:27:18] there. And so for him the most important
[1:27:22] thing was wisdom. Now it turns out
[1:27:24] though that that is the purpose to which
[1:27:26] God called Solomon
[1:27:29] that the thing that he desires the most
[1:27:31] is what he actually needs to fulfill the
[1:27:34] purpose of God for his life.
[1:27:37] So think about it the influence fathers
[1:27:40] have on their children.
[1:27:45] Now we don't know what God intends to do
[1:27:48] with any of us in the future
[1:27:53] but we can be ready
[1:27:57] depending on what our hearts desire what
[1:28:00] we hold most important
[1:28:03] because if I am asked
[1:28:07] what do you want I think I'll dig in my
[1:28:09] heart and the most important thing the
[1:28:11] thing I assume the most is what I'll ask
[1:28:14] and I believe that's what Solomon also
[1:28:16] did.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; So in in his case it was wisdom. So we
[1:28:23] find out that in second Kings I think
[1:28:25] chapter 3
[1:28:29] in 2 Kings chapter 3
[1:28:32] the Lord asked him and he gave the right
[1:28:35] answer. So what I'm saying is that by
[1:28:37] the decisions we make in our own lives
[1:28:40] through the challenges that we face and
[1:28:42] everything we prepare our children for
[1:28:44] life
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; and we also prepare them for future
[1:28:49] decisions.
[1:28:51] Solomon was given this marvelous option
[1:28:54] and it went well.
[1:28:56] So the way we prioritize things in our
[1:28:58] life
[1:29:00] might be what
[1:29:02] invites such divine favor. Hallelujah.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Now going back to the story,
[1:29:12] we have to know that these people on the
[1:29:14] promised land right now, they have made
[1:29:17] the right decision over and over and
[1:29:20] over and over again. But now
[1:29:25] they have to take a stand again for the
[1:29:27] Lord.
[1:29:28] And that's what I'm saying. If you have
[1:29:30] a a new year resolution,
[1:29:33] make the choice for Christ.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; The decision for the Lord, the decision
[1:29:42] is a decision for life and beyond.
[1:29:45] And it's not a one-time decision.
[1:29:48] It's the best decision for self. Like
[1:29:52] we've said, Solomon went through it and
[1:29:54] he got so many other things.
[1:29:57] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; I read willingly decided to acknowledge
[1:30:02] the faithfulness of God and she ended up
[1:30:05] receiving the salvation of her children,
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; decide for Christ
[1:30:11] because he has already decided for us
[1:30:13] all.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:19] I'll call the musicians.
[1:30:21] But I want to read just this one last
[1:30:26] man.
[1:30:28] I could talk about Mount Camel showdown.
[1:30:35] I could talk about Noah's decision for
[1:30:36] his family. But we all know these
[1:30:39] things. I just want to read one last
[1:30:43] quote
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; and this is from the time of decision.
[1:30:52] Brother says, "So the time has been
[1:30:56] allotted to every man to make his
[1:30:58] decision."
[1:31:02] Sorry.
[1:31:04] Whether he's a preacher or a prophet or
[1:31:06] a church member or what more, he's got
[1:31:09] to make a decision. And this time came
[1:31:13] and Abraham was determined that he did
[1:31:15] not want his son to marry an unbeliever.
[1:31:19] That would be good decision for
[1:31:21] Christians today who are sons and
[1:31:23] daughters of Abraham to make the same
[1:31:26] decision about their children. Now it
[1:31:29] didn't make any difference how pretty
[1:31:31] those unbelieving girls were, how nice
[1:31:34] women they were. But Abraham did not
[1:31:36] want his son connected with that kind of
[1:31:38] stuff. And so he had to make a type of
[1:31:42] decision on who he should marry. Imagine
[1:31:47] going to the extent of you
[1:31:51] deciding for your children.
[1:31:54] But that is the expectation.
[1:31:57] One might ask, what era did Barraham
[1:32:00] live?
[1:32:03] And I'll say still the error of this
[1:32:05] same message.
[1:32:07] Now I'm I'm standing here. I'm a father
[1:32:09] of three children who are not yet there.
[1:32:11] You think I can I can reach there?
[1:32:14] Don't stop praying for your man. Don't
[1:32:17] stop praying for your man. The
[1:32:19] expectations are high. The standards are
[1:32:22] high. And nobody pretends to have the
[1:32:25] means to meet it.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; But the power is in the word that is
[1:32:30] provided to us.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; And so we have to take the word back to
[1:32:34] the Lord and say, Lord, strengthen me to
[1:32:36] live this.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; This is your word. I believe it. Help me
[1:32:40] out.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the name of the
[1:32:44] living God.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; So anyway, I know I I I went into the
[1:32:48] the fatherhood thing big time, but it's
[1:32:51] because it comes to me over and over,
[1:32:54] but all I'm saying is that let's make
[1:32:57] that decision for Christ.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Because it's the best decision we can
[1:33:03] make for ourselves.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:33:13] let's sing. Um, I'm anchored in Jesus.
[1:33:31] Upon life's boundless
