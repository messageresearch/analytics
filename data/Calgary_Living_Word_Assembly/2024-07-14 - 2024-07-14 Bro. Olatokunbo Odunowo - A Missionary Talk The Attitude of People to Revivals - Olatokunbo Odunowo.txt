welcome to the house of the Lord amen certainly thrilled to be here today I uh I just want to say thank you for all of your prayers for your for traveling mercies the Lord was gracious to us we had no issues or problems and we went directly from service on Wednesday a week ago and found ourselves in Ohio and it's really meant a lot to me personally I've heard so much about Ohio over the years through our former Pastor brother Ken and his family and his in-laws just so the area is so rich with family Brother Paul's family lives there and it's just amazing it was amazing to be there and fellowship with the Believers but I'll tell you something there's nothing better than coming home and being with our family and I call you my family today this is where it's at and I'm so thankful for each and every one of you God bless you today I just want to bring greetings from the Saints at True Word Tabernacle in bluon Ohio that's the church we were at last Sunday we took the service at brother Wayne's request his invitation and uh you know thank you once again for your prayers the Lord certainly came on the scene but Brother Ray Ericson and brother Wayne Lawson both the pastors of that church send their greetings to each and every one of you here and uh brother Wayne said he'll come and see us he'll come and visit and uh just take a couple services with us we're certainly thankful for each and every uh opportunity we had for Fellowship there I could go on and on I'm not going to do that we just had a couple things we have a a prayer request we wanted to bring before the church here for sister Bethany Hatfield that is brother Wayne Lawson's youngest daughter she's having spells and uh they don't know what it is she's in the hospital this morning and they've asked for prayer so we want to remember her sister Bethany Hatfield in Ohio and Sister Mary Carpenter as well as a request for prayer for her body and uh you know before we go to the throne with these requests just like we like to do here we want to bring a praise report this is from Brother Jos and his wife sister Becky and uh he wanted me to read this this morning and I'm thrilled to do it he said we're praising our Lord Jesus Christ for his Mercy in our family on Sunday June the 30th 24 we had an unspoken request for our brother who was elected as the premier of The Province in DRC on May 29th 2024 on June 28th his competitor who lost the election formed some false accusations against our brother now it's interesting because this parallels with what we were preaching here as Christians and Believers of this end time message we brought the case to our God on Sunday June 30th as pastor Barry was preaching it was an answer to our prayer on Monday July 8th the court delivered its verdict and confirmed the election of our brother as a premier of The Province for that reason we are praising our Lord Jesus Christ who delivered our brother and gave him Victory like he did for Daniel Shadrach mesach and Abednego praise be the name of our God forever ni Samu family amen and your entire family here brother we're certainly thrilled to stand with you what a mighty God we serve if you have a need this morning maybe just make it known unto him as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father what an honor and a privilege it is to know who we are Lord Jesus to know where we stand father to know that Lord we go from being not just a son or a daughter but to an adopted son and daughter father knowing that you have called us by name you have positionally placed us Lord father we could run from church to church from place to place looking to find you but Lord we know that you won't be found by knowledge oh Father you will only be found through Revelation and we're so thankful that you've given us that Revelation today father if there's anybody here that doesn't have that Revelation today Lord I pray that you would grant that Revelation to them now father Lord that you would just settle their hearts Lord Jesus father that we wouldn't be running around trying to find you Lord that we would recognize we have you father better yet you have us Lord Jesus we just want to remember each and every request that we've made known today Sister Mary Carpenter needs a touch from you in her body Lord Jesus we know that you have been so faithful to the Carpenters Lord father we are so thankful that we could stand together with them and bring their request before you Lord knowing that you will meet that need father Lord we want to stand United with the Lawson family and the Hatfield family this morning Lord Jesus for sister Bethany Hatfield Lord we just ask that you would touch her body now in the name of Jesus Christ Christ father we just want to rebuke that devil that's trying to come against your daughter in the name of Jesus father we know that brother Isaac or husband has a desire to minister your gospel and we know that the devil just wants to do anything he can to try and destroy that he hates that but he can't stop it Lord and father we're so thankful for your goodness and your tender Mercy we pray that you would just give brother Isaac just a fresh coal off the altar Lord just a burning in his soul lord Jesus the more the devil presses we pray pray that Lord Jesus the more he would just have to speak out against it father that he would just have the desire to stand in his position give him strength as a husband Lord for his wife while she's down father we pray that you would watch over their baby Lord that you would just keep your hand upon the Hatfield family Lord we're so thankful for your goodness and your Tender Mercies to each and every one of us Lord we pray for each and every request that was made known unto you today Lord by way of an uplift hand maybe just an uplift heart father you know the needs father and I pray that sovereignly you would meet them Lord Jesus father we know that you're more than able what a mighty God we serve we're so thankful Lord Jesus for your goodness and your mercy to each and every one of us Lord now as we change the order of this service we pray that Lord you would just take our brother to kbo odoo father and just use him for your glory speak to us through him Lord Jesus father lip to ear and give us hearts Lord Jesus to receive that word it's so easy to pray for the pastor

special song but I don't think I will please musicians can leave uh I'm not going to preach this morning I'm going to give a missionary talk I'm going to give testimony amen of the goodness of God hallelujah under the ministry of Revelation 10 1-7 but before then I want to thank the pastor once more for allowing me to come to service here I want to thank brother Paul the first family that we visited and we had most marvelous time of Fellowship I want to thank Brother Don Brother Don is a twins is a twin I'm also a twin I don't write poems I also write poems so we have that in common and everybody that has prayed for me brother Steven Daniel just everybody and I want to thank my daughters-in-law who I think over feeding me I've gained three Kil three three 3 Kg since I came and uh I don't work I sit study walk come back home and I'm putting on and I my as as as my profession DET TT to me I should not put on wait so I'm trying to cut down on my feeling and they don't like it as I said we want to hear from our God the things that he has done over the years am to bring us to the hour that we are in and to be the presence that we are in in our part of the world Amen to encourage you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen and that as he walks in Canada amen that's the same way he walks in Africa yes and we want to encourage ourselves to know that God has more for us to manifest in US as the young man and the young sister sang we want to see that everything that we are called to do in the gospel work yes God lays it down for us as if we are to do them ourselves but he laid them them down for us to show to us that what he had been in the past he is today and he will be tomorrow amen and if it was he who did it in the past he's getting us to know and be relaxed and be assured that he himself will do it in our lives today the other way to look at it which are human wisdom and the things that we see around us make us to think is that God employed us asra Paul will employ somebody in his office and then give him the schedule of Duty and make that person to do it it is not that amen it is he that's right who employs us as partners in the business who tells us what to do it is he that will incline our hearts to do it is he that will Empower us to do it and then is he that will get the glory because he will share his glory with no man that's the testimony I want to give I'm talking about the missionary talk the testimony of the word of God the subject is the attitude of people to revivals and the driving thoughts is that God wants a ready Church a church that is ready right a church that God can by the N call to duty which he has taught them how to do and would do it in them but it requires one thing and that's just one thing that is our surrender our surrender is the strength of our obedience obedience is the first law in heaven and when we can get to that we get to that by our consecration our consecration comes from the intimacy that we have with him how often we are before him how often we can obey the appointed times the solemnities the times of meeting that he has proposed in his heart and he has shown to us in the books to engage ourselves with him the reason why we don't have the result that we must have I believe is because we don't get engaged enough with our husbands amen as brother Brown would say uh sisters please permit me to say this when we marry if we have the husband in Nigeria I'm sure I want to see if somebody is here it's not here if you have somebody if you have the husband in Canada and the wife is in Nigeria it's not possible for a child to come right as long as they St apart right that's right as long as we stay apart from the [Applause] designated appointed times of fellowship with him we will have perhaps just one child and then we are married the other children that must come cannot come because there's a law of God that law talks of a meting you must receive something from God to empower us to do the works of God let me read this there's going to be a ready church as radon has so wonderfully talked to us it takes a poet to understand the fullness of what another poet is saying amen you saw him that he was almost weeping it's not brother da it is the move it is the anointing of the wordss that were put together that is what is working in him as it did in Michelangelo mangalo used his hands to do some work and then he came to a point that he saw what was in his heart now in a non-living material it was so real to him that this one and this one are the same thing and in him this one was moving was talking was directing the children of Israel and he wanted this one of his own hands also to talk and he said speak Moses his Moses could not speak because his Moses was made by the hands of amen but when we become the masterpieces of God and God wants us to speak he doesn't strike us he just Nots us amen we understand because it is he within us willing and he will do his good pleasure amen the church is ready she's sealed in ready to come there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the skies exactly because the church the word the bride Christ his ministry in his Brides the ministry of Christ in his Brides amen which is his body the supernatural body of his here on the face of the Earth spiritual body on Earth his spirit is there living in his life right out until the church and him becomes one yes in the wedding that wedding is taking place right now on Earth it will be a minority right in it is the rising of the Sun the prophet said the bride be very very very few that will come out in this generation she will be Millions when we count all the generations of the seven Church ages but in this very age she will be very very very little and what's her power now I thank each one of you a few moments ago when you are singing for you I'm praying that's what I want you to do is prayer that I depend on that's the secret of all the mysteries of God am that's the key that opens the door to everything of God is prayer amen if it is then we must have prayers in every situation I want to give a missionary talk how we discover the power of God in the Divine Fellowship that it calls us to that brought us to a point to know that those things that the prophet said they are the absolute truth and when we lend ourselves and give ourselves over unto them he who promis knows the way Against All Odds to bring it to pass Against All Odds if he says we should pray every moment Against All Odds all the thing that he wants me to do is to believe that section of the word that portion of the word believe it in me allow it to go into my heart he himself will see to eat that every moment that God wants me to pray God will pray out in me am right amen it takes our complete surrender to know that he's leaning on us as we also lean on him he's waiting on us as we wait on him with without us he cannot do anything he cannot bring this word to flesh amen so in the less than one hour that I have I want to tell us what we found out what we enjoy in the gospel that you and I cherish so much that will call the message of the hour it is not history brother brah said our religion is not a history it's a living fact right it's a living God it's a living experience as it was in the days of Judah amen shall We rise up to read from First Kings chapter 8 1 Kings 8 the 56th verse to the 61st verse blessed be the Lord that has given rest unto His People Israel according to all that he promised there has not filed one one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant the Lord Our God be with us as he was with our fathers let him not leave us nor forsake us amen that he may incline our hearts onto him to walk in all his ways to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments which he commanded our fathers please you can be seated and may the Lord Jesus Christ add his Blessing to the reading of that portion of his word as a background to my testimony the testimony of the word of God I will also from Exodus 1ter 7 verse1 Exodus 71 I hope I'm not I will not be nervous because I want to talk of 40 50 years and I don't know how I will put that in 45 minutes but I trust that God will help me this is God's testimony to Moses and the Lord said unto Moses see I've made thee a God to pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophets if we connect that to Revelation 10 verse 8 to verse 11 I'll make you God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and it dwelt amongst us and it came down with a book in his hand a closed book in his hand and when it open when it was closed in Revelation 5 it opened Revelation 10 he brought it on Earth brother bramham was there and when he delivered to his servants he gave a commandment from Heaven to you and to me that we should take the book from the hand of he who has it amen and then we should take it and eat it all and when we eat it all that same God that was once in flesh will dwell in us and when he dwells in us at the end we will prophesy Moses and Aaron in one man the seed in that man in that woman and then when it goes through its process it will bring forth Amen in that man the word will come out in life in living and what will be will be God Amen as brother I think it was brother FF Bosworth illustrating it to the prophet said it will be if you take God all Mighty to be the mighty ocean the god that will be in brother Paul or in brother Dan will be a teaspoon yes or even a desert spoon or even a seven spoon or even a whole pale out of the mighty ocean but it will be the same not in qu quantity but be the same in equality and whatever he does in his majesty in the glory of his Beauty he can come again and do it in that little measure according to the measure of Faith given to that person amen that is what we want to speak about amen the journey of life in our part of the world the part that I know very well is the southwest of Nigeria or let me say Nigeria Because by the grace of God I travel around the country and in a little measure the southwest of Africa including from Cameroon to Gambia that would be about the size of maybe half of United States to see how God helped us in Nigeria in about 1933 there was a Pentecostal Revival brother abrah told one of the Brethren whose father had a small gift that in 1933 when the angel met him God gave a measure of the gift that was upon him around the world we had a man in Nigeria Joseph babala was his name he was a Methodist who when he was about his duty the Lord met him and then lifted him up and he brought the Pentecostal Revival of the return of the gifts of the Holy Ghost back to our nation and it spread like wildfire God was on the Move 40 years after that 73 we were in college and another wave came as we know in the pattern of God another wave came and then it went around the SE students in University and uh schools of Higher Learning and that was where our generation was uh sister fi's generation and such like amen we give our lives to Christ he gave us the assurance that we have given our lives to him and so young men young women who were caught in the fire of that Revival and God inclined our hearts as we read in first king God inclined our hearts to know that his will must be done in our lives and he gave us the grace to follow lime by line at that time we had Revival also in America so we had a lot of American evangelists TL Osborne Tommy Hicks V grants mauriceo uh non uh White a whole lot of them coming to Nigeria and because at some point in our own lives I was 17 when I gave my life to Christ more were less in age than myself but at that time the influence of the move of God overtook us amen and we were at those young ages to be able to stand alone our parents refused us they were not going to pay our goofies they were not going to take care of us but something in us which was the spirit of God made us to know that Jesus will do it even though we didn't know where it would come from but what would come from our mouth variously was that Jesus would do it Jesus would do it we did not have any work we did not have any means of doing it the unfailing god did not fail us their parents knew that these children have come to stay with their belief the gospel that were believed changed our manners of dressing our manner of talking it was just the wave of gifts that came it didn't come with the perfect word but the move that it was the move of God had an impact a positive impact on our living from there we were wi to what is very popular in our nation and across the Southwest coast of Africa as the Su the scripture Union the scriptural Union was and is still a Christian and Inter denominational Evangelical Christian group that mastered at our time mastered only John 3:16 and perhaps the gospels when were taught Romans or from Ephesians it was just KY they mastered the gospels and one of the common words was that read your Bible every day read your Bible and pray every day read your Bible and pray every day so we were taught that we must read our Bibles which we now today know as Clos book but we were reading the Clos books and God was speaking to us amen in our little little functions then by 76 the message came to the message of brother Braham came to Nigeria this is the manner in which it came brother Tommy Lee Osborne came to Nigeria a wonderful man of God he brought to Nigeria let me say hundreds of motorcycle hundreds of electric power generating sets T of uh Jeep SUVs which was then a Land Rover and then hundreds of uh projectors and it brought hundreds also of his eight films we had the meeting in a Stadium University students poly Technic students were there who were Christians and obviously those who are not Christians also be there and so he gave out at the end he gave out to some people the the the the the the the the Land Rovers distributed all these things for evangelism in Nigeria and in the countries around us incidentally we had we have French countries surrounding our nation except in the South where we have the sea so he advised us to learn French because he believed that Nigeria is going to evangelize West Africa and Africa so the race began it was a very very healthy race a race that had no competition in it but to serve the Lord amen so in our young age we were detailed to serve God we were challenged alleng to serve God we are challenged to spend everything that we have to serve God am still in the University at that time it fell our part to go to the prisons our parents are not supportive we didn't have any church to support us the only where we can only portion that we can get money from for transport from our school to the prisons and back is to a portion our feed money so some of us decided that we will not take breakfast all through the weeks we'll save the money to go and minister to we have the privilege and honor to minister to those who are little little criminals young young criminals and those who had uh life prisoners to minister to those who have life life imprisonment in our nation or they condemned to death it takes a special favor somehow they allowed Us in and we're able to at least tell them knowing nothing about the message at that time but what we knew served the purpose you were able to leave school and go for evangelism in The Villages and in the towns and the testimony of some of us was that when they come back and there will be exams next week they will sleep and God will download the questions for them so they will study the questions we have amongst them making first class in the University God began to let us know that we must evangelize we must tell what we know to others and it doesn't take big programs it just takes a few of you to go and uh stand somewhere we didn't have guitars and keyboards at that time but we have God's Own 10 string instrument I will make joyfulness to God I can remember now one time went to a village and it's we lighted in front of a house a small piece of ground front of the house and we singing and talking about Jesus we didn't know that the house behind us was the house of a witch Master the name of Jesus Christ does not match does not doil with what he's doing and he thought that now I can become bigger in this Village by killing these children getting something to happen to them and then people will know that yes I have power we didn't know anything was happening in his house we contined singing and preaching the man came out and came penitently out and he called a few of us and said please I beg you I you please leave my my front front Court we didn't know what was happening he told us the story that he had been trying to charm us but he had been failing his Devils have told you that these ones you can't touch them am by the grace of God we all also now knew that we shouldn't be too obstinate we shouldn't be obstinate we assed to his disband we left his court to another place it left a mark in that Village that there's a power greater than the power that they rever in that Village and that by itself encouraged us to know that we are not just going out to preach the gospel that the Su have given to us which was just live right you must don't fornicate don't commit adultery which you didn't have power to not to do but they told us the word came but we knew ourselves that we didn't have power to stop those things that's right but with all that we have we are trying to serve him when brother Tio came in giving his testimony of his own Ministry that evening he mentioned a name he told us what I Now understand we now understood where we now enter the message the story of the the the Poland Oregon madman right he said he saw a small American man that that man came he just spoke that was the first time we in our little group had the name William Miriam Branham that was in 1974 and after that meeting of brother Tiel Osborne it was gone that was we had it once and then it was gone but later on in 76 a brother came to our school and he brought two books he brought the scroll of brother Neil frisbee I don't know if anybody has heard about him he's also an American he's also a believer of the message I believe one of the FKS that derailed from the message who believe that he brother Braham was Malachi 45 and 6 but being that brother Bram died he was now to be Revelation 10:7 and in his books he will qu the prophet profusely he will say let the prophet himself speak and then he quote paragraphs of brother Abraham in his Cru at that time we were getting tired of the Pentecostal move because the Pentecostal move was not satisfying what God placed in our hearts the desire that is started in our justification in in in in we met him or let me say he met us in fullness that our sins were gone and that we must live right and I was taking us somewhere we didn't know the way like Philip said Lord show us the way we didn't know the way but we knew that it was taking us somewhere we were told that it was just live right and things but we knew innately that something greater was must be there so when at that time getting tired of Pentecostalism because in the church we were attending at that time on the stage the musicians will be there and then may I say like a routine from the corner there we'll be singing the song the usual song was uh I forgotten the song but it's one of these Hallelujah songs hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah somebody say then somebody would interpret at this side but in Monday this Pap Papa man will be seen doing what is ungodly with with with with the with the members of the choir chister will live wrong so our hearts knew that the god that met us at our gilgal our time of decision cannot be this he cannot call out of call us out of that error that nonsense that sin and then in church we me the same thing so there was a yearning and we have said we have read that it is he who inclines our hearts to that what happened when we came back from the T meeting we formed a little group in my school that we want to engage ourselves more in what we had in the meeting and that was that we should pray more we should be more Evangelical in our thoughts so we started a night vigil we will leave hostel about less than 10 of us or at most 12 I can't remember the number we were praying and as we were praying God was drawing us closer to himself things that we thought were manageable we now saw that they were not manageable in the Kingdom he began to divide for us what is right as he said in Philippians 1 we were able to try things that differ were able to choose things that were excellent in our journey to the kingdom that was what how the book Seven Church ages and the scroll of brother n frisbe met us somebody cling to the scroll when I had what he inclined my heart to cling to was the seven Church ages book when I got the book I was in my final years University I didn't go to classes for one week morning and I finished it I can't remember what I read but I believe all that are [Applause] read it made a turning point now we see where we are going now we know where we are going but at the same time bra frisbe books also will come bra frisby's book will come in big numbers the voice of God at that time spoken words will release only if you get one Salon book in 6 weeks if you get two in your mail you're a king because everybody will come to you and say as soon as you finish it please give it to me and so we started feeding all be it little by little on the message of the hour what difference did we see you could read other great evangelist books you could read two three in a day and you are still the same boy but if you read one of William Brown's books you must be on your knees you must weep am then we began to see the difference how is this one like we didn't know what he was we were just reading books the ones that will come from spoken word will be free we spend our money to buy the ones that came from others icept a few of them not because of the economic economical difference but because of the substance that we saw in brother Brown's books brother br's books would draw you Heavenly it was consistent we began to see a pattern of the Bible that was unfolding to us right and when when the time came we decided to do our with others to concentrate on what this man amen is saying hallelujah we married July 1st 1978 uh our friends came a year after was our wedding anniversary for our wedding anniversary our friends came to celebrate with us the fellowship that we attended at that time we have a brother who was a year two years my senior in secondary school in high school as you call it here and uh he was holding that church he was called as an evangelist in that time in our part of the world the ministry in the christom that was R highest was was the ministry of the Evangelist not because of scriptural setting but because of the work that they were doing it was the Evangelist that would go there go here go here so they were they were always on the move so that was the ministry of that brother but this for about 3 weeks before he has been telling us that he wants to preach a great message so on our first wedding anniversary we came people came because of us so the church was as the church we had was full here on last Sunday Fuller than this I guess so the the the the the the the the place that we use for the of for the church was filled up and he brought a message Elijah the prophets he was the if there was anybody among the ministers that preached and propagated the ministry of Neil frisbee that was the brother but now after the message began to come and he studied he saw that Neil frisbee was fake to this language fake news so he came and he dropped the bombshell what how can David say that this and this and this and this and that but he has said it he went to his room and he prayed usually like you do here don't let me say like you do here much less like you do here much less when service ends we just greet a little social station and then you go back home but that day nobody greeted the other person you took your wife if you have you are married go into your car go to your house because for three and a half years of Our Lives we were in frisbee we began to see that frisbee was not right because partly of the doctrines but partly of the life that it was bringing right young men in the in the because were expecting the coming of the Lord young men that were University age they will leave school and then they will take a sister and they will start living together as husband and wife common law living anointing they will go to the bank at that time the briefcase will call it portfolio at that time in Nigeria they take a briefcase and go to the bank and tell the teller fill this with money no medicine no Juju nothing the power of the words under that anointing fill it with money he will fill it with money and they take it and then they comfortably go and then they say they have done exploits Daniel 11:32 those that know their God they shall be strong and they will do exploits but we knew that that was wrong right because it took us from sin the foundation was that it took us from sin by his blood it was taking us somewhere we didn't know but we followed in the journey now we had a separation which was a separation that was due right those who wants to serve God and those who don't want to serve God I made an illustration here the attitude of people to revivals all that I've been talking about is a period of a Revival or several revivals within a Revival there are two parallel lines mathematic tell tells us that two parallel lines cannot meet if they are parallel lines they will never be together but in this spiritual paralel parallelogram one is going down one is going up the one going down will always be more like the world something in their in the Christian something in what they believe something in what we all believe together they will find something there that will be adding more weight to them and the weight will be lowering them down to their AB base on the other side there will be people there that their hearts will be in tuned to the things of God God will incline their hearts to follow him and when they follow him in all sincerity he will bring them up and they will be joined up to the coming of the Lord because he's the one that's preparing his people so when we came to the message now we know that frisbe is wrong all other ones they have served their purpose they were right they were good at their level they helped us at their level we couldn't have been where we were when we got to brother Braham if we didn't pass through them but they've their work stopped that's why brother brah says that in chrisom there are three spheres the sublime that's closer to heaven the Pentecostal Go full gospel Pentecostals and then the nominal God took us from the nominal we were been nominal by birth by placement by Desire by love we delighted to go I delighted to go with my parents to their church because I know there's no power in their church when I sin and they say we are going to church my parents had a church where they told us that there was power that God was moving there one day I did what was very bad I won't mention it so I was afraid to go with them to church I did all that I could to do not to go to church but my father was a school principal he was a disciplinarian to the core he said we must I must come to the car I went to the car I was shivering literally shivering that thinking that when I get to church the gifts will pick me when we came back nothing there's nothing in the church there's in the church you look those things when we when we say we are what we are not it empowers sin in us that's amen it embolden us to sin but God right who is reach in mercies to reveal his son in me he made me to meet the truth we knew from Brother Brown's message that there was power in the church but where was the power amen when we were now Avid readers of the message as they come we will read them we saw the principles of God which he laid down in his words for us to draw closer to him and for the power to come the first one we discovered was the principle of the unchangeability of God from our reading of the seven books we knew that God does not change amen hallelujah and that you cannot change him Amen brother Abraham says you cannot improve on the message amen amen amen it's God's perfect will amen Amen in his way in his words and in his Essence he cannot be changed and it cannot even change we took that we put it in our breast pocket underneath our fet you know what is there it was kept in our hearts that's right we also found out the inferability of God and his word am you can't fault him right he's always right he's omnipotent so whatever in our growing times whatever we had that it was God we know it can never change and we know it can never be wrong amen no matter how it was we know it was his will for us no matter how it was difficult for us to obey we know it was his will for us we found out the Dy and the Oneness of Christ in the godheads amen some of us were to go to baptism when we saw baptism in water but they told us that it would be in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost we have read this man that told us that God is one and that will also go for baptisma lesson because we have at that time we didn't have any message church so we were attending any any Full Gospel Church at that time we didn't see it in the Bible because brah has established for us that whatever you do must be in the Bible we refuse to have baptism in their midst and then we were told that you cannot have church if you die who will bury you if you if you give bir to children who will name your children if you want to baptize who will do this we find that those were just obstacles right mountains that the SAT the enemy put before us we began to think that if this is the gospel and we are God's children then we should not stop only at Fellowship we should have our own churches amen amen amen amen we did not stop at those he showed us the principle of God's being a god of details when God says put off your shoe your sandals from your feet he meant sandals God will not see sandals and call it shoe Moses was wearing sandals that's right right Moses knew enough of God to know that when God said Sanders it did not mean Hearts we cut all this from the prophet we knew he was a god of details so whatever he says is what it means and in its detail you remember brother brah at the beginning of the ministry the first pool God gave him a vision he went to that house house he prayed for that baby but there was to be a Mama Grandmother that must pray her glasses here another person must be at the door that person must be here but in his the youthfulness the infancy of the ministry not knowing this details of God he brought that child and then he prayed thinking that the boy will be fine the boy got worse that's right then he remembered that you are to do what I told you to do exactly amen God means what he says he says what he means that's what one of the things he told us in the seven Church his book he says what it means he means what he says that's right we began to apply that to our lives to know that when God says this is why you're here should be that is exactly what God means am this is how your church should be we knew that that was exactly what it means our lives began to take another turn of changes our languages began to change our Outlook to life began to change because we now learn that that's the exactness of God I'm telling you the history of what God did in our part of the world to those who believe that believe amen amen then we learned that every seed must bring forth of his kind we learn the principle of the continuity of God that when God starts something doing something here he would continue it until it comes back to that start when he plants a seed the seed will go through process that's right and then come back to se am amen it taught us patience with God it taught us perseverance with God it taught us to walk with God whatever we see as long as is coming according to the pattern of God Amen we should just follow it we began to see in details how God Lives amongst his people we also Le the principle of God's hiding in Simplicity and revealing himself in Simplicity we learned that humility is a very first sign of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen he put us in our position amen and to be anything of for God you must be humble it's not self-giving humility but God given humility the more we learn that the more that God was in you the more humble you will become the more you are accumulating of the virtues and the attributes of God the more humble you will become condescending to Men of lower States as brother Paul said it then he made us to learn the secret of prayer the first move of the Revival of the Holy Ghost to our nation the 1933 Revival came with prayer that church is a Praying was a Praying church that church I have a testimony of a brother in our church the father in their Village you know we have a lot of child mortality because of diseases poverty and ignorance which served his purpose in our nation but when a child dies the people learn to take the baby the dead baby and put it in in the front coat of the church and said the God of this church raised this child do you understand what I mean yeah that somebody's child dies a few minutes ago and then they have seen so much of God so much of answered prayers in that little village church yes that they will pack the child and put her down or him down and say the god of these people should raise the child I want the brother come around they know that they have as challeng them and God in his mercies will raise the childrenall I said that church was a Praying church when that Revival fire died down because they didn't follow the word of God for the season and the time they let down in their prayer life and so nothing was happening they became like Samson yes when the power was taken away though they still have prayer meetings but there was no power the god of the prayer had gone from them we learned that God loves secret prayers and learning from the mistake of our forefathers in that church we knew that we must keep him before us every time so we knew that there was power in prayer amen amen then having all this together we could no more operate in the established churches so it came to our hearts that we could also have our own assembly where we will now bring all these things that we have learned and we continue to learn from the prophet into reality so we started a local assembly we brought in so many carryovers from our local assembly from our old place so many carryovers when we get to church in the morning we sing a few songs uh a brother would just say have an exhortation he would speak another person will say have an exhortation we knew that in the parallelogram or in the body that is called The Church some of us by the grace of God knew that we it's it's not it's not the ecclesial church it's not the pure church it's still a gathering of people and we began to see signs even amongst us or people that just took church for another social Gathering some took church for that's just a routine that we are from Christian homes and we will follow what our parents have been doing then God sent the apostolic Ministry in our midst by the word the Apostolic Ministries set us in order Hallelujah conduct order and Doctrine amen brought us to know that the first message of Jesus Christ to the church was baptism of the Holy Ghost and then they began to preach we began to know what the fivefold ministry was and they were taking their turn Sunday after Sunday Wednesday after W Wednesday Fridays After Fridays all the meeting days which we have learned that were inseparable from our worship of God those as the prophet said those meeting days were appointed days of the Jehovah to meet his people as it was composing for the Jews to have the seven feasts of the Lord it was together with the with the with with with the Sabbath it was composing for us also to follow those step by step as we saw in the prophets amen Sunday morning service Sunday evening service made we prayer meting this vils on Friday and all and all like that when we saw that there was no more any brother saying I have exhortation everybody came under the word of God a Time came when some people could not bear it amen they said no and they left the church they went out of us because they were not part of us hallelujah if they have been part of of us they would have stayed with us not to glory in them they started Living wrong because they left the protection of the word of God of a true complete word of God revealed by God's mouthpiece for us today God did not stop there amen as we dig more into the message we began to see other things other other positions that will must be to be always with our God we found out that or I found out that comparing now and then our times of meeting with God has increased to what the message says the fullness of what the message says we started to have uh Sunday schools adult Sunday schools children Sunday schools uh adolescent suay schools we began to have cuted pyrami God inclined our hearts to do the things that we saw brother Mar mentioned in the books amen this morning we had the musician had a meeting we had people in our time in our in our place surrendering themselves to come to the church much earlier than the meeting time to find somewhere to pray for the meeting hours to pray for the meeting why because you saw it there amen we saw it there and we want to be eat it all take the book from the hand of the angel that has the book has his hands up in heaven and eat it all amen amen in other words everything there eat it because you are going to prophesy now this is prophesying time this is the time of manifestation of the word what you eat is what you can manifest and when the hour of manifestation comes remember that the enemy will still be there amen the enemy will be there to tell you that it's not done there it's not done here it's not done here we don't want to see what is done here on Earth our prayer has it taught us that Lord let thy will be done on Earth as it's done in heaven and this is heaven to us shall we bow our heads that's a short cut of 50 years in 45 minutes there's more that will be said we have seen God raise the dead have seen God done miracles signs and wonders we still see God in the manifestation of his power amen it is not a strength thing and it's not seldom that we see God by the power of His presence and the power of His word take away tumors cancers not what we do but it's our God Amen it's not our church it's our God it's not our home it's our God I'm telling you what our God does and I believe we still do amen when we are completely intimate with him when we are completely surrendered unto him when our time you Lord belongs to him amen the spending of our time when prayer becomes the very breath of Our Lives [Music] in every sphere in every condition that they told us when people come to our homes they we sanctify them by word of prayer as it is in the as it was in the scriptures why we want to leave our homes do we do it as the prophet did when we have Gatherings do we do it what's the place of the word of God in our Gatherings that's outside of the Four Walls of the church wherever you are wherever I am that's the church yes where two or three are gathered together in my name and every G must have the word of God when we lift him up when we glorify him amongst the people people that's when he can glorify himself when we ourselves are in tune with all his words which we are to manifest in this time and season that's when it can vindicate us because it's going there's going to be a time that will show up his people a bride without Sports without wrinkle without blemish or any of such things that's the goal of each one of us and to reach that goal we must follow that word in total in completeness am for victory to be our in completeness we must follow the word in completeness amen God is the god of Revival Revival is washing away the the trash the things that are not to be in our lives that's one stem of the Revival another stem of Revival is God's move in power one precedes the other cleansing us John 15 it precedes God moving in power in our lives as it was forgiv ion as it was for Ruth as it was for Esther as it was for David as it was for Joseph that's the way same way it will be for us God is calling us to more service for him amen the riment of this world the pleasures of this world should not take away from our God we should redeem the time seeing that days are evil and the coming of the Lord is here we are in the last days the church that have seen all that God did in all the ages all the virtues and all the the merits of each age and the darkest age before the loudan age which we came out of is that the tan age had this from God that the end of age work was greater than the beginning of age work which was a commendation your hearts my heart should desire that our end of age work should be more than the beginning of age work yes the founding fathers of this church they handed to us something that's glorious we should make it more glorious because the promise of God is is that the the glory of the latter house shall be greater than that of the former it's left in your hands if left in my hands what will we do with this unfolding word of God children of light stay with the word don't leave it watch it unfold itself as it unfold itself as it reveals itself unfold itself the Prophet said we also will be unfolding to be like the word I'm challenging your faith I'm challenging your desire amen I'm challenging you as beloved brothers and sisters fellow Travelers pilgrims strangers in this world that will not be conformed to this world we must take the custom of the Church of God as our true and real custom we must want and desire the realities of the Living God not the alter realities now we want what what our picture of the message is the that picture as in Michael Angelo must come to reality in our individual lives everything that the prophet said should be our duties to God when we believe it I assure you by the grace of God and the presence of God that God will make a way for it to be done amen dear heavenly father we thank you very much for so much in so little time the testimonies are true because we're testifying of what our God came down to do in our midsts and you are the same

and some people are looking back in the past but you know those people who have taken the book they've been given the ability to recognize what he's doing right now and I think that's probably the most important thing that I I got out of the testimony this morning it's just so beautiful for him to continually understand to continually identify what God was doing at every step of the way in his life and he is the same yesterday today and forever he's leading us and he's guiding us it's just so wonderful to be a part of his family um maybe we could just close in prayer gracious Heavenly
