[18:20] name. Isn't it lovely? Isn't it
[18:22] enjoyable to worship the Lord tonight?
[18:25] Bow with me if you would in prayer
[18:27] tonight as we go to the Lord. Father,
[18:30] it's just so wonderful to let you know
[18:32] how much we love you. Father, you
[18:34] expressed your love to us. We could
[18:36] never pay the debt that you that that we
[18:38] owe. But oh Lord, we're so thankful that
[18:41] we're recipients of that elective love
[18:43] before the foundation of the earth. Oh
[18:45] God, you called us. You knew through
[18:47] fornowledge what choices we would make.
[18:49] But Lord, we know in our hearts, Lord,
[18:51] there's not a single one of us that
[18:53] could boast on anything. But Father, you
[18:55] place that seed in us to say amen to
[18:58] your word. Not just any word, but the
[19:01] word you descended with in this hour.
[19:03] Lord, we're so thankful for that. Lord,
[19:06] as we have gathered together, you see
[19:07] the hearts and souls of each person
[19:09] here. Lord, would you meet those needs?
[19:12] Father, was thinking tonight just in
[19:14] prayer, Lord, would you just add one
[19:15] more cell to that spiritual man tonight?
[19:18] Just one cell. Lord, we'll leave here.
[19:21] We'll be rejoicing. We'll love you more
[19:23] than when we came in those doors. Lord
[19:25] will be more prepared, more equipped,
[19:27] and more ready for that great soon
[19:29] catching away. Lord, grant that. Bless
[19:32] the brother that would bring the word.
[19:33] He's traveled many miles. The friends
[19:34] that have come with him, Lord, bless him
[19:36] richly, Lord, tonight. And Father, may
[19:38] you bless the word. Bless the anointing
[19:40] of it. And oh God, may we receive with
[19:42] joyful hearts, Lord. May our hearts be
[19:44] opened, our ears just attentive tonight.
[19:48] We've come hungry and thirsting, Lord.
[19:49] That's our confession, Lord. And I know
[19:52] you you will never disappoint. You'll
[19:54] fill us, Lord. You'll feed us because we
[19:56] come that way. Thank you for these
[19:58] things, Lord. Receive our worship now.
[19:59] We pray in the precious name of the Lord
[20:01] Jesus, we ask. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may
[20:05] have your seats tonight.

[26:44] Oh, I will cast

[26:59] just
[27:01] I don't know
[27:04] how exactly how I feel and I can't begin
[27:11] to tell you what has meant. I'm lost for
[27:17] words. Isn't that the truth sometimes?
[27:20] Oh,
[27:23] is there a way
[27:27] to show the passion in my heart? Can I
[27:32] express
[27:35] how truly great I think you are, my

[29:47] Amen. God bless you tonight. Welcome to
[29:49] the house of the Lord. I trust you've
[29:52] come expecting.
[29:54] Just have a couple of requests tonight
[29:56] that we'd like to bring before the
[29:57] throne of grace. If you have a need
[30:00] tonight, maybe just make it known unto
[30:01] him by way of an uplift hand as we go to
[30:04] him in prayer.
[30:06] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[30:08] tonight we just want to pour our love
[30:11] upon you, Father.
[30:14] Lord Jesus, we've gathered here tonight
[30:16] because we desire to worship you,
[30:18] Father.
[30:19] Lord, as we heard about on Sunday,
[30:22] Father, if there's a desire for more of
[30:24] you, that means there's more of you to
[30:26] be had. And that's why we've gathered
[30:29] here tonight, Lord Jesus, for more of
[30:31] you. Oh father, we know that your
[30:33] prophets, they said that they must
[30:35] decrease so that you can increase. And
[30:38] that's our desire here tonight, Father,
[30:40] is that we could decrease so that you
[30:43] could increase, Father, in our service,
[30:45] Lord, in our lives, Lord, in our
[30:48] marriages, Father, in our relationships,
[30:50] Lord, in our careers, Lord Jesus. In our
[30:53] decision makingaking, Father, in
[30:55] everything that we do, Lord, our desire
[30:58] is to see more of you. So, Father, we
[31:01] just want to commit our lives in a
[31:03] greater way to you tonight, Father.
[31:05] Lord, we pray for the needs that were
[31:06] made known unto you tonight by way of an
[31:08] uplift hand. We just commit them into
[31:10] your hands, Father, unto you. And we
[31:13] trust that Lord, your will will be done.
[31:16] And Father, tonight we pray that you
[31:18] would be with Sister Michelle and
[31:20] Brother Emanuel, Lord Jesus, as the baby
[31:23] is on the way. Father, we just want to
[31:26] unite together as a body here with them
[31:28] and ask you, Father, for a safe
[31:31] delivery, Lord Jesus. We thank you,
[31:33] Lord, that we can bring our prayers and
[31:35] our supplications to you, Father. Oh,
[31:38] Father, tonight we also want to remember
[31:40] the Hoffer family, Lord, as they go
[31:42] through the valley of the shadow of
[31:44] death, Lord. Father, we don't know
[31:46] what's going to take place. We know that
[31:48] you have it all in your control, Lord
[31:50] Jesus. And we just commit all of the
[31:53] situation into your hands for your
[31:55] glory, Father. Lord Jesus, tonight as we
[31:58] turn turn our eyes upon you, Father, we
[32:01] just, Lord, look to the highest order of
[32:03] the service, Lord, where you come and
[32:05] you minister to us, Lord. Help us all to
[32:08] get out of the way, Father, and give you
[32:10] the preeminence, Lord. We just ask that
[32:12] you would anoint the speaker, Father.
[32:14] that Lord you would anoint the hearer
[32:16] alike Lord Jesus that we would be one
[32:18] with you. Father we'll be careful to
[32:21] give you all the praise. Father tonight
[32:23] we just ask that you would bless brother
[32:25] Joel and his family for coming by our
[32:28] way. Lord we pray that you would just
[32:30] anoint that burden that you have placed
[32:32] upon his heart. Father we love you and
[32:34] we thank you. We just ask all these
[32:36] things in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[32:40] Amen. I was thinking about it. It's been
[32:43] about a year since we had brother Joel
[32:45] with us and we're certainly thankful to
[32:47] have him here but only this time with
[32:49] his entire family. God richly bless you.
[32:53] They're going to stick around Calgary
[32:56] tonight and tomorrow and I believe on
[32:58] Friday they're going to head north.
[33:01] They're going to go out through Jasper
[33:02] and head up over to Edmonton and go and
[33:05] visit Edmonton Living Word for a couple
[33:07] days and we trust the Lord will bless
[33:09] them there as well. Can we sing that
[33:12] chorus? I love him. I love him. As we
[33:16] invite brother Joel, Joel Galant. He's
[33:18] the pastor of the church in Three
[33:20] Rivers, Quebec. The Lord's been doing a
[33:23] wonderful work there, and I'm sure that
[33:25] he'll he'll tell us about it. So, let's
[33:28] just sing that tonight as we invite our
[33:30] brother. Oh, I
[33:34] love him.
[33:38] I
[33:40] love him
[33:43] because
[33:45] he first
[33:48] love me.
[33:56] [Music]
[34:13] Once again, I love him.
[34:16] Glory.
[34:19] [Music]
[34:24] I
[34:26] love him
[34:29] because
[34:32] he first
[34:35] love me.
[34:40] Oh, and perious
[34:44] my
[34:46] salation
[34:48] [Music]
[34:52] on God.
[35:00] [Music]
[35:01] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[35:05] Amen. I'm glad to be here. May God bless
[35:08] you all richly. I still remember the
[35:11] last time. I think we had a blessed time
[35:15] last time, a blessed service and getting
[35:18] to know you. U
[35:21] even after I remember the restaurant as
[35:23] well. I met a sister downstairs that
[35:25] said, "I remember the timeout from last
[35:27] time." Amen.
[35:30] And it's a blessing to hear about it.
[35:33] You know that that the Lord spoke. If
[35:36] these are men's word, you'll forget
[35:38] about them. But when God comes down, it
[35:41] makes a difference.
[35:43] Amen.
[35:45] Amen. So before we um before we sit,
[35:48] let's just read a a verse as a context
[35:52] tonight.
[35:58] [Music]
[36:02] 2 Corinthians chapter 5.
[36:08] 2 Corinthians chapter 5
[36:12] and verse 21.
[36:17] I asked brother Barry to pray for my
[36:19] accent before service
[36:21] and he said he would pray for your ears
[36:23] instead.
[36:25] So I trust it will be all right.
[36:30] Amen.
[36:32] 2 Corinthians chapter 5 uh verse 21.
[36:37] For he made him who knew no sin to be
[36:41] sin for us that we might become the
[36:45] righteousness of God in him.
[36:48] Amen. And what I want to do tonight is
[36:50] read from two different translations,
[36:54] two more translations just to try to get
[36:57] even more context out of it. And the
[37:00] second one is uh the amplified version
[37:03] that goes like this.
[37:06] He made Christ who knew no sin to be sin
[37:10] on our behalf so that in him we would
[37:13] become the righteousness of God. That is
[37:17] we would be made acceptable to him and
[37:19] placed in a right relationship with him
[37:21] by his gracious love and kindness.
[37:24] And the Living Bible goes, "For God took
[37:28] the sinless Christ and poured into him
[37:32] our sins. Then in exchange,
[37:35] he poured God's goodness into us."
[37:39] Amen. Let's pray.
[37:42] Father God, thank you for this uh
[37:45] moment. We can gather ourselves tonight
[37:48] around your word. And I pray you come
[37:52] down Lord in a mighty way tonight and
[37:55] and uh search our hearts you know and
[37:58] and Lord if there is anything in our
[38:01] hearts that needs a change may you
[38:06] give us humility to
[38:10] to make a move Lord to surrender our
[38:13] hearts or parts of our hearts to you
[38:15] that need surrendering. May you take
[38:18] control over this service Lord. May the
[38:20] words that will be spoken not be my
[38:22] words but your words
[38:26] as I step aside Lord come down I pray
[38:29] and take control I ask in Jesus name.
[38:32] Amen. Amen.
[38:35] You may be seated.
[38:40] So in my church, as brother um Barry has
[38:45] mentioned, last time we were here, we
[38:48] were about six months in in a new
[38:50] church. So it's about a year and a half
[38:52] now. We moved to a permanent location,
[38:55] uh a church building, and we grew from I
[38:59] think we were 28 and to over 50, so kind
[39:03] of double you. and and God has been
[39:06] doing a a wonderful work because people
[39:09] are coming off the street, you know, to
[39:11] hear the word. And this has um um this
[39:16] has been a an opportunity for me to
[39:18] preach a simple gospel. Um and that is
[39:21] what I want to do tonight.
[39:24] I started a series in my church that I
[39:26] called the evolution of revelation.
[39:29] And uh we went back to the dark ages and
[39:33] and the coming out of it when light
[39:36] struck Luther. You know how how God
[39:39] restored to Luther this truth that the
[39:43] Catholic Church um tried to bury for
[39:47] hundred years, hundreds of years. The
[39:50] Catholic Church tried to bury truths to
[39:53] keep people uh under bondage under the
[39:57] dominion of the Catholic Church. And and
[40:00] then light strike. The just shall live
[40:04] by faith.
[40:06] And and the purpose of this series I'm
[40:08] doing in church was to walk with the
[40:11] light. You know, as the light struck
[40:15] Luther in in the 1500s, just walk with
[40:19] the light and understand how God works
[40:22] and how he restores truths because he
[40:26] said, "I will restore." He promised it.
[40:29] Amen. And I thought we would move quick,
[40:32] you know, a couple services on
[40:34] justification and then move along to to
[40:37] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[40:39] Ghost and and all these truths. But um
[40:43] this this topic of justification, the
[40:46] Holy Ghost had other plans for it. It
[40:48] just I've been stuck preaching
[40:50] justification for about three months
[40:53] now. And uh but we've seen lives
[40:56] changed. We've seen people saved. Uh
[41:01] church people saved. not only people
[41:03] coming out of the street but church
[41:05] people saved um out of their religion
[41:09] into a relationship with Christ
[41:13] and um
[41:15] and so just before we start I want to
[41:17] read out of the church age book tonight
[41:22] I know you've studied it a lot because
[41:24] brother Barry told me you spent
[41:26] something like 18 months on the church
[41:29] ages is that it 18 months
[41:33] 16 months, something like that. But I I
[41:35] want to read just um just one quote for
[41:39] you before we start that proved to be
[41:41] true in my church. And I've been
[41:44] preaching along the topic of
[41:46] justification in few churches lately.
[41:48] And it seems to be true that brother
[41:51] Brandham goes like this. And I hope you
[41:54] can see it.
[41:56] The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21
[41:58] that we have become the righteousness of
[42:00] God by by our union with Jesus Christ.
[42:03] Did you get it? It says that we are the
[42:07] very righteousness of God himself by
[42:10] being in Christ. It says that he Jesus
[42:14] became sin for us. It does not say
[42:17] became sinful but became sin for us that
[42:21] by our union with him we might become
[42:23] the righteousness of God. If we accept
[42:27] the fact and we must
[42:30] and we must that he really became sin
[42:34] for us by his substitution for us. Then
[42:37] we must also accept the fact that we by
[42:41] our union with him have become the very
[42:44] righteousness of God. To reject one is
[42:49] to reject the other.
[42:52] To accept one is to accept the other.
[42:55] Now we know the Bible says that it can't
[42:57] be denied. But the revelation of it is
[43:01] missing. It is not real to the majority
[43:05] of God's children. It is just a good
[43:08] verse in the Bible.
[43:13] This proved to be true for many
[43:15] Christians
[43:17] in our churches. It's a good verse in
[43:19] the Bible, but we need to have it made
[43:23] alive to us. And my prayer
[43:28] for us tonight is that this Bible verse
[43:31] is made alive for someone here tonight
[43:35] by the preaching of the word by the
[43:37] preaching of the truth that this Bible
[43:39] verse may be made alive.
[43:42] Amen. And you know the the restoration
[43:46] taking place throughout the church ages
[43:50] is not a restoration of doctrine.
[43:58] Even though doctrines are restored in
[44:00] the process,
[44:02] there are truths that are being
[44:04] restored.
[44:06] But it's the restoration
[44:09] of the church.
[44:11] Bringing the church back to original.
[44:15] That's the whole purpose of it. The
[44:17] whole purpose is not we know in better
[44:19] doctrine than others. The purpose of it
[44:22] is us the church because we are the
[44:26] church. The church is the people in the
[44:29] pews.
[44:31] So think
[44:34] think of restoration of a car. Let's say
[44:37] think of the restoration of a car. You
[44:40] can't restore an old car if it wasn't
[44:42] new once. You know, before you can
[44:46] restore anything, it had to be revealed
[44:49] first. And so what happens through the
[44:52] ages is what ca the Catholic Church has
[44:55] been burying, you know, they've been
[44:57] burning Bibles and and putting people to
[44:59] death. What the Catholic Church has been
[45:02] trying to hide from Christians is now
[45:05] being restored.
[45:07] And what happens in a restoration is you
[45:09] can't st you can't skip parts of the
[45:12] process. You know, if you take an old
[45:15] car, even if you put shiny wheels and
[45:17] brakes and and new chuckss and mufflers,
[45:20] if you don't put in a new motor, then
[45:23] it's useless. You can't go anywhere with
[45:26] it, right? And so, this this work of
[45:30] restoration is not about doctrine as
[45:32] much as it's about the people.
[45:35] So, we can be like our forefathers in
[45:37] the book of Acts.
[45:39] That's the whole purpose of it.
[45:42] Amen.
[45:44] And the heart is the first thing that
[45:46] needs to be restored. And Luther's
[45:49] message is just about that. It's just
[45:53] about that. And so I hope you all stay
[45:55] with me
[45:57] as we will take a look tonight at
[45:59] Luther's message because justification
[46:02] was Luther's message.
[46:05] But it didn't end when Luther died.
[46:07] Right? It's just uh knowing it's the
[46:10] same message. It's not a different
[46:12] message. Brother Ram said, "I preach the
[46:14] same message." Luther preach only
[46:17] something's been added,
[46:20] but but often I feel we want to start
[46:22] climbing the ladder by the last step
[46:25] and but we need to build on it.
[46:29] You see, I told my church we are
[46:30] Lutherans.
[46:33] That was not many amens the first time I
[46:34] said it. But brother said, you know, we
[46:37] are Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist,
[46:39] Pentecostals. We're all of this. We
[46:42] believe the truth. We believe the whole
[46:45] truth. And if we believe the whole
[46:48] truth, the whole council of God, we
[46:50] don't want to miss on one part of it or
[46:54] one bit of it. We want all of the
[46:56] goodness that's in the word. And that
[46:59] justification topic, it's so vast. It's
[47:02] so wide. It's such a blessing. It
[47:06] transforms
[47:08] the Christians,
[47:10] transforms the church, and and uh I know
[47:13] it for a fact because I've been stuck
[47:15] preaching for three months.
[47:17] And uh and I can't get away from it.
[47:20] It's it's uh it's beautiful. It's
[47:23] amazing. And so I hope you uh you jump
[47:26] in with me tonight as we take a a deep
[47:30] dive. you know just uh it will be only
[47:33] one one service not three months except
[47:35] brother Barry is really inspired but but
[47:38] uh tonight the title of my my sermon
[47:40] would be a divine exchange
[47:44] a divine exchange and u as individuals
[47:48] and that almost ties with the the
[47:51] message I preached last time I was here
[47:53] because as individuals we all have a
[47:54] motivation for our actions. We all do.
[47:58] There is something that that motivates
[48:01] our actions. If we work overtime, how
[48:04] many here work overtime?
[48:06] If we work overtime, it's either, you
[48:09] know, to treat ourselves with a trip or
[48:12] something or pay back the credit card
[48:14] because we've already treated ourselves.
[48:19] If you watch what you eat, you want to
[48:22] lose weight.
[48:24] There's always a motivation behind an
[48:27] action.
[48:28] And so my question tonight would be why
[48:31] do you go to why do you go to church?
[48:35] Why do you go to church? What is the
[48:38] motivation
[48:40] behind this Christian life that you
[48:42] live? What is it? Are you looking for a
[48:46] religion or for a relationship?
[48:50] This is the real question. Are you
[48:52] looking for a religion or for a
[48:54] relationship? Because chances are most
[48:57] of us are here tonight because one day
[48:59] we realized we were sinners.
[49:02] Like we realized our current life wasn't
[49:04] worth much.
[49:07] Well, we realized we wronged God. We
[49:09] wanted this to change.
[49:12] And that is actually the reason we're
[49:14] here. You know, when we're born, we're
[49:16] not aware of sin,
[49:18] right?
[49:21] But as we grow older, our consciousness
[49:24] grows. You know, when I was two, I
[49:27] didn't know it was bad to to throw food
[49:30] on the ground. I didn't know it yet when
[49:33] I was two.
[49:35] Our our consciousness grows over time.
[49:38] But in regard of sin, the truth is in
[49:41] regard of our sinful condition, we have
[49:44] that awakening moment like that
[49:46] lightning strike where we were living
[49:49] our lives the way we wanted to do it and
[49:53] then all of a sudden it strikes us that
[49:55] this life we live is not right.
[50:00] It's striking. It happens at once. Some
[50:02] have it at age 12, some at age 40. But
[50:05] when it hits, it hits. I'm a sinner. I
[50:08] have sinned against God. I'm lost. So,
[50:11] there's a reason why I asked about your
[50:13] motivation in being a Christian or what
[50:16] you are looking for in a Christian life.
[50:19] And it's because most human beings on
[50:22] planet Earth reacted the exact same way
[50:25] for 6,000 years when realizing they
[50:29] sinned against God.
[50:32] We do have a record
[50:35] of how people reacted
[50:38] when they realized they sinned against
[50:40] God.
[50:42] And it doesn't tend to change much.
[50:44] We tend to react the same way over and
[50:46] over again.
[50:49] And so let's look at the first two human
[50:51] beings to be hit with the fact that they
[50:54] have sinned against God.
[50:56] And the question remains as we are
[50:59] looking at Adam and Eve. Are you looking
[51:00] for a religion or relationship?
[51:04] And I really pray someone has the
[51:06] humility to search their own hearts
[51:07] tonight. Genesis chapter 3.
[51:11] So when the woman saw that the tree was
[51:13] good for food and that it was pleasant
[51:16] to the eyes and a tree desirable to make
[51:20] one wise, she took of the fruit and ate.
[51:24] She also gave it to her husband with
[51:25] her, and he ate.
[51:28] Then the eyes of both of them were
[51:30] opened and they knew that they were
[51:32] naked. And they sewed fig leaves
[51:35] together and made themselves covering.
[51:41] And they heard the sound of the Lord
[51:44] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[51:46] day. And Adam and his wife hid
[51:49] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[51:51] God among the trees of the garden. Then
[51:55] the Lord God called to Adam and said to
[51:57] him, "Where are you?" So he said, "I
[52:00] heard your voice in the garden and I was
[52:02] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[52:05] myself." And in these few verses, we
[52:07] witness the fall of humanity. Adam and
[52:10] Eve realize they are naked,
[52:13] their eyes open. Amen. They do realize
[52:18] it all at once. And just like most of
[52:21] us, I would assume that live this
[52:24] moment, the lightning strike. I'm I'm a
[52:28] sinner. Like 10 minutes ago, I wasn't
[52:32] aware, but now I know.
[52:35] And it hurts. But we also see in these
[52:39] few verses from Genesis what men do when
[52:42] they realize they have sinned against
[52:44] God. They manufacture themselves a
[52:48] religion.
[52:50] The fig leaves is a religion.
[52:53] We all know brother said it right. The
[52:55] fig leaves is a religion. The fig leaves
[52:58] is I hide my nudity.
[53:01] I hide my shame. I try to fix my problem
[53:05] myself.
[53:07] That is a religion. Adam told himself,
[53:10] you know, if we hide our nudity from
[53:13] God,
[53:15] God will not notice we sinned.
[53:19] That's what they try to do with the fig
[53:21] leaves.
[53:23] And it looks like a lot of Christians on
[53:25] Sunday.
[53:27] We dress nice, we put on a smile, we
[53:31] come to church, we sing, we clap hands,
[53:35] we lift hands,
[53:39] and it's all in an effort to look okay,
[53:45] right? God won't notice.
[53:48] I've put my best shirt. God won't
[53:50] notice.
[53:52] I sang the loudest I could. God won't
[53:55] notice. Trying to manufacture ourselves
[53:58] a religion. I want everybody to realize
[54:01] that Adam already had a relationship
[54:03] with God. Amen.
[54:07] It sounds crazy to me that someone who
[54:10] already has a relationship with God
[54:14] would still try to manufacture a
[54:16] religion when he becomes aware of his
[54:18] own sin.
[54:20] But Adam thought his religion is what
[54:23] would save his relationship.
[54:26] Adam thought his religion was what would
[54:28] allow his relationship to survive his
[54:32] sinful condition.
[54:35] But it didn't work.
[54:38] If I if I hide my shame, God will stay
[54:40] with me. If I make amend for my mistake,
[54:44] everything will be all right. He
[54:47] manufactured or tried to manufacture his
[54:49] own righteousness.
[54:51] But did it work? It didn't. In verse
[54:53] eight, it says, "When he heard the voice
[54:57] of the Lord, he ran in the woods and
[55:00] hide."
[55:02] That's what he did. Even with the fig
[55:04] leaves, even with his religion, when he
[55:08] heard the voice of the Lord, he ran in
[55:10] the wood and hid.
[55:13] He did showing us that religion doesn't
[55:16] work. It doesn't work to restore
[55:20] relationship with God.
[55:23] It serves other purposes, but not
[55:25] restoring relationship with God.
[55:27] And what I believe
[55:29] is that the more a man is sincere with
[55:32] God,
[55:34] the more a man has a conscience of his
[55:37] sin, the more chances he has of living a
[55:41] religion.
[55:45] You see, I don't want anybody to see a
[55:47] religion or somebody in a religion see
[55:51] that person as as lukewarm or or wicked.
[55:55] That person is really sincere. Actually,
[56:00] that person is really sincere.
[56:03] The more you you have conscience, the
[56:07] more you try to to do something to make
[56:10] amend for the wrong you've done. That's
[56:13] just human nature. The the more you're
[56:17] you're sincere with God, the more
[56:20] chances you will fall for a religion.
[56:26] Because when we become fully aware of
[56:29] our sinful nature, our conscience gives
[56:32] us a guilt trip,
[56:35] right? Like everything's our fault. And
[56:38] just like Adam and Eve, we do two
[56:40] things.
[56:42] First, we hide our arts
[56:46] from God.
[56:48] You know, because we realize we are
[56:49] unworthy of a relationship with him. So
[56:52] we hide our hearts from him or we
[56:55] withdraw from relationship if if we were
[56:58] fortunate enough to have one before
[57:01] before our conscience got to us. When we
[57:04] realize our sinful condition we hide our
[57:07] hearts from the only person who could
[57:09] take care of it. And the second thing we
[57:12] do once we hide our hearts we get in a
[57:15] religion.
[57:17] And I'm not talking about a specific
[57:19] religion.
[57:20] Some people find one, some people
[57:23] manufacture one.
[57:26] You can be in a religion of one person.
[57:29] You You don't need to be, you know,
[57:32] 2,000 people or 200,000 people to be in
[57:34] a religion. You can be in your own
[57:36] religion.
[57:40] That's what Martin Luther did.
[57:43] And boy, that man was sincere.
[57:45] I don't know if anybody ever studied the
[57:47] life of Martin Luther, but you know
[57:51] there there will always be someone out
[57:53] there who understands how our conscience
[57:56] works,
[57:57] who understand what we've just talked
[57:59] about, the fact that we feel guilt and
[58:02] want to make amend. And that person or
[58:05] that system that understands how your
[58:08] conscience work when you become aware of
[58:10] sin will always come and present a
[58:13] religion to you. They know you have a a
[58:18] a thirst inside of you to make yourself
[58:21] righteous before God to restore your
[58:25] situation to find favor with God to
[58:28] appease your conscience. And this is
[58:30] exactly what the first organized
[58:32] religion did. The great Catholic Church,
[58:35] they've put together a a whole bunch of
[58:37] deeds that you had to do to be right
[58:40] with God, to make amend.
[58:44] And they were circumstantials, you know,
[58:46] meaning that depending on what you did
[58:49] wrong, what you had to do to make amend
[58:51] changed and you could also pay for the
[58:54] wrong of others. That must have been
[58:57] very lucrative. I mean, man, and you
[59:01] know, using this loophole in our
[59:03] conscience, they've put together a
[59:05] religion that offered some kind of peace
[59:07] of mind supposedly
[59:10] in exchange for rulership, dominion over
[59:13] the people.
[59:15] And uh and I have to be honest with you
[59:17] tonight, I believe that Christians,
[59:21] all all of the Christians carry this
[59:25] Catholic heritage with them. no matter
[59:28] their affiliation.
[59:30] We all carry that that Catholic
[59:32] heritage.
[59:34] Uh it's true that Protestant broke away
[59:36] from from Catholicism, but but the
[59:39] heritage of looking for religion,
[59:42] looking for a covering for guilt and
[59:44] shame
[59:46] and being ready to give dominion to
[59:48] someone, you know, giving dominion over
[59:51] our lives to to anyone who could promise
[59:53] heaven or some kind of peace for my
[59:56] conscience in exchange to obedience to a
[59:59] set of rules. We're prone to do that.
[1:00:04] Many very sincere people that want to
[1:00:08] please God and do right get caught in
[1:00:10] religion
[1:00:12] and one of them was Martin Luther.
[1:00:15] Martin Luther was a brilliant young man
[1:00:18] and uh he was set to a bright future. He
[1:00:21] was supposed to go to university and and
[1:00:24] become an advocate, a lawyer. Uh that's
[1:00:27] what his dad had in mind. But the guy
[1:00:30] became a monk instead.
[1:00:32] He took a vow of poverty. And you know
[1:00:35] when we uh easterners think about monks,
[1:00:38] we think about an old guy because that
[1:00:41] there doesn't seem to be a lot of young
[1:00:43] monks nowadays. But but he was very
[1:00:46] young, you know, he was just 18 or 19,
[1:00:50] something like that. And he made a vow
[1:00:53] of poverty and he became monk. And what
[1:00:55] that meant is he spent eight hours a
[1:00:58] day, seven days a week, year round,
[1:01:02] praying, meditating, reading the Bible,
[1:01:05] and singing. Eight hours a day. He lived
[1:01:08] by charity, sobriety, chastity, poverty,
[1:01:12] obedience, fast, vigils,
[1:01:15] and mortifications of the flesh.
[1:01:19] That was his lifestyle.
[1:01:22] Why did he do that?
[1:01:25] a young a bright young man with a bright
[1:01:27] future. Why did he do that? Because he
[1:01:32] loved God.
[1:01:36] That's an important point to make.
[1:01:39] Because he loved God. Because he wanted
[1:01:41] to please him. Because he wanted to be
[1:01:44] good. But also because he feared God.
[1:01:47] Like was afraid of him.
[1:01:51] He was in terror before God.
[1:01:54] and he thought he could do things to
[1:01:56] make himself right before God, pay for
[1:02:00] for his pay for his failures and and
[1:02:02] appease his conscience. And here's a
[1:02:04] list of things Luther did in the
[1:02:07] monastery to try and become worthy of a
[1:02:09] relationship with God.
[1:02:12] You know, he fasted for no water, no
[1:02:15] drinking, and no no food, no water,
[1:02:18] rather no food, no water, no nothing for
[1:02:21] over seven days at a time.
[1:02:23] prolonged, you know, fasting periods,
[1:02:26] staying up all night, night after night,
[1:02:28] depriving himself of a blanket in the
[1:02:31] cold nights of winter until he almost
[1:02:34] froze to death. That that was one of his
[1:02:36] favorite ways, you to suffer, to try to
[1:02:39] be right, was hypothermia,
[1:02:43] hurting his physical body. He deprived
[1:02:46] himself from even all the necessaries
[1:02:49] necessities of life. Luther was such a
[1:02:52] good monk that he was selected by his
[1:02:54] fellow monks because all monks are not
[1:02:56] equal even if you become a monk you know
[1:02:59] and not everybody in church is is equal
[1:03:02] in terms of you know sincerity and deeds
[1:03:04] and stuff that's why we uh we tend to
[1:03:08] add an adjective be before the word
[1:03:11] Christian a good Christian you know a
[1:03:13] bad Christian it's because not all
[1:03:16] Christians are equal in our eyes in our
[1:03:18] eyes.
[1:03:22] He was selected for priesthood by his
[1:03:24] fellow monk to celebrate mess a mass and
[1:03:27] um to come to the altar and perform the
[1:03:30] miracle of reenacting the sacrifice of
[1:03:32] Christ. You know Catholics believe that
[1:03:35] the bread will become the actual body.
[1:03:36] You know that and that happens through
[1:03:39] the power of the priest. They think so
[1:03:41] that priest doing that miracle he has to
[1:03:44] be perfect
[1:03:46] utmost perfect. So he has to pay for a
[1:03:49] lot of things ahead of this ceremony and
[1:03:52] perform a lot of deeds to be in the
[1:03:55] right condition to approach the holy
[1:03:58] altar of a holy God. And Luther thought
[1:04:02] he really thought this is it. Like
[1:04:05] finally I will restore my relationship
[1:04:08] with God at this altar. I've been a monk
[1:04:12] for almost two years. I lived right. I
[1:04:15] paid for my mistakes. I done everything
[1:04:17] I could. I suffered. And now here's my
[1:04:21] opportunity to come before the altar and
[1:04:24] restore my relationship with God.
[1:04:28] I've done it all and now I'm going to
[1:04:31] find peace.
[1:04:33] But instead, Luther almost fainted. He
[1:04:36] was in terror at the idea of getting
[1:04:39] close to a holy God. And this is a
[1:04:41] turning point in his life where God
[1:04:43] could start working working with him.
[1:04:46] And for a while, you know what happened?
[1:04:48] It got even worse for him because he
[1:04:51] tried even harder because he failed at
[1:04:54] this halter. So he thought, I haven't
[1:04:56] done enough. I need to try harder to be
[1:04:59] perfect and I need to pay for more
[1:05:02] mistakes.
[1:05:04] And he came out of read that reenacting
[1:05:07] performance with two questions in mind.
[1:05:09] And the two questions he had in mind
[1:05:11] that would haunt him
[1:05:13] was, "How can a man stand in the
[1:05:16] presence of a holy God unless he himself
[1:05:19] is holy?
[1:05:21] And how can a man be holy?"
[1:05:25] And those are real questions.
[1:05:29] And in this state of mind, he turned the
[1:05:32] pages of his Bible to Romans chapter one
[1:05:35] and read this.
[1:05:38] For I am not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:05:39] Christ, for it is the power of God unto
[1:05:42] salvation to everyone that believeth, to
[1:05:44] the Jews first, and also to the Greek.
[1:05:47] For therein is the righteousness of God
[1:05:50] revealed from faith to faith.
[1:05:54] No works there. From faith to faith, as
[1:05:57] it is written, the just shall live by
[1:06:01] faith. And the light sparked. God
[1:06:05] revealed justification by faith to
[1:06:08] Luther. He restored righteousness by
[1:06:11] faith to the guy who could preach it.
[1:06:15] It's amazing how God does how he does
[1:06:18] things because let's say you have that
[1:06:20] lousy Christians that hates the deeds
[1:06:23] and he comes up with that new idea. It's
[1:06:25] by faith.
[1:06:27] You don't need to do no deeds. That idea
[1:06:30] is is hard to accept. But when it comes
[1:06:34] from the monk amongst all, you know,
[1:06:37] Luther said, I was a good monk and I
[1:06:41] kept the rule of my order so strictly
[1:06:43] that I may say if that if ever a monk
[1:06:47] got to heaven through his monkery, it
[1:06:49] was I. If I had gone on any longer, I
[1:06:54] would have killed myself.
[1:06:57] That's what he says. If there was one,
[1:07:00] it's me. All the deeds that Luther
[1:07:03] performed didn't bring didn't bring him
[1:07:05] no comfort, no peace. If I were you, I
[1:07:09] would stop trying.
[1:07:12] Stop trying to find peace in in your
[1:07:14] deeds.
[1:07:16] It doesn't work. None of us here are are
[1:07:20] as zealous as committed as Luther was.
[1:07:23] Right? I'm not I'm not afraid. I'm not
[1:07:27] ashamed to say it. I don't have that
[1:07:29] mental toughness Luther had. I don't
[1:07:32] have it.
[1:07:34] That's why I don't try.
[1:07:38] There is a provided way.
[1:07:44] He testifies to us even tonight,
[1:07:48] it doesn't work. It didn't bring me no
[1:07:52] peace.
[1:07:54] His
[1:07:55] testimony still speaks tonight. It
[1:07:58] doesn't work. The deeds doesn't work.
[1:08:01] The only thing you need to become a
[1:08:04] Christian is a personal relationship
[1:08:07] with Christ.
[1:08:09] But that's what Luther wanted.
[1:08:12] The problem isn't that he didn't want a
[1:08:14] relationship. He wanted deeds instead.
[1:08:17] It's not a eitheror.
[1:08:20] He wanted a relationship, but he thought
[1:08:22] that he had to do something to be able
[1:08:26] to get into relationship with God.
[1:08:29] The conclusion was, I can never stand
[1:08:32] before him as a sinner. I need to do
[1:08:35] something about it.
[1:08:38] But here's what God showed Luther. I do
[1:08:40] not ask you to change a thing to come to
[1:08:44] me.
[1:08:47] This is not an opinion. I'm giving you
[1:08:50] tonight. Jesus walked the earth. He
[1:08:53] walked the earth and we have four
[1:08:56] gospels as an account of his life on
[1:08:58] earth of the way he treated people of
[1:09:02] the way he acted when he faced a sinner.
[1:09:05] This is God in flesh showing us, you
[1:09:09] know, um God in flesh to make an an
[1:09:16] a holy God, almighty God, understandable
[1:09:19] to the human mind so we can understand
[1:09:23] the heart of God.
[1:09:27] Think about
[1:09:31] reading the gospels.
[1:09:33] Think about what religion religion is
[1:09:36] and what relationship is.
[1:09:39] Look at the Pharisees.
[1:09:41] They're trying to reform people to have
[1:09:43] them comply to a set of rules. Religion
[1:09:46] always wanted people to behave.
[1:09:51] Always.
[1:09:56] But they dragged
[1:09:58] a prostitute by the air
[1:10:01] to Jesus.
[1:10:03] And what did Jesus say?
[1:10:06] I condemn you not.
[1:10:09] You see Zakius, Zakchius, I think it's
[1:10:13] called Zakius. Yeah.
[1:10:16] The whole city was gathered to see Jesus
[1:10:18] come come in town. And Zakius was in a
[1:10:22] tree and he was the worst of all. The
[1:10:24] chief of sinners, the chief of tax
[1:10:26] collectors, the the worst guy in the
[1:10:29] city. And I feel like our Christianity
[1:10:31] today would sound like this. Jesus
[1:10:34] saying to Zakius, "Hey, Zakius, I wish
[1:10:37] uh I would stay at your place tonight
[1:10:39] and have supper with you, but man, your
[1:10:42] life,
[1:10:44] it's not on par." So,
[1:10:47] here's a list of all you got to do. You
[1:10:49] know, reimburse all the people you
[1:10:51] stole, make a man, get your life
[1:10:53] together, you know, ask for forgiveness.
[1:10:56] and the next time I come to Jericho,
[1:10:59] maybe I'll stop by.
[1:11:03] That's what modern religion often looks
[1:11:05] like.
[1:11:07] But that's not what he did. He said,
[1:11:09] "Zakius, come down
[1:11:12] for I'm having supper with you tonight."
[1:11:15] And to give you an idea of what that
[1:11:17] looked like, the whole city murmured.
[1:11:21] They started chatting about, "Isn't he
[1:11:24] supposed to be a prophet?
[1:11:26] I mean, he must know this guy is the
[1:11:28] worst in town.
[1:11:30] And yet, that's where he chooses to
[1:11:32] stay. It makes no sense.
[1:11:35] But something miraculous happened in
[1:11:37] these few words from Jesus. Amen.
[1:11:42] Justification by faith
[1:11:45] instantly
[1:11:47] without no need to tell him what he had
[1:11:50] done wrong or what he should change or
[1:11:52] do. No, nothing. Instantly
[1:11:56] because Jesus healed his heart, accepted
[1:11:58] him, justified him, entered a
[1:12:01] relationship with him without asking
[1:12:02] anything in return. Instantly he said,
[1:12:06] "I will repay every wrong I've done and
[1:12:09] give my money to the poorer." Why is
[1:12:12] that? Is that a religion?
[1:12:17] Matthew tax collector. Hey, Matthew. I'm
[1:12:19] I'm having supper at your place tonight.
[1:12:21] He was called a friend of
[1:12:25] self-righteous. No, a friend of sinners
[1:12:29] by the religious people. He was called a
[1:12:33] friend of sinners.
[1:12:36] My
[1:12:40] Amen.
[1:12:42] There has to be a change in our mindset
[1:12:44] where we go from trying
[1:12:48] to accepting.
[1:12:51] And and we need to look at the sacrifice
[1:12:53] for a little bit tonight because when we
[1:12:56] hear about Jesus on the cross,
[1:12:59] we hear about him dying for our sins,
[1:13:01] right?
[1:13:06] But the people, the Jews, they already
[1:13:08] had a provided way for the forgiveness
[1:13:10] of their sins,
[1:13:12] didn't they?
[1:13:14] They would slay a lamb
[1:13:17] and and their sins were forgiven
[1:13:18] according to the law of Moses.
[1:13:21] They would slay a lamb, put their hands
[1:13:23] on the lamb, the dying lamb, and there
[1:13:24] was a transfer of their sins to that
[1:13:28] dying lamb
[1:13:30] and the sin question was settled for
[1:13:32] them. So here's my question tonight. Why
[1:13:36] would the son of god come to die on a
[1:13:38] cross if a sheep did the work? Amen.
[1:13:45] There must have been hundreds of
[1:13:46] thousands of sheep in Israel,
[1:13:49] maybe millions of sheep. You just picked
[1:13:52] one, went to the temple, did a
[1:13:55] sacrifice, and the sin question was
[1:13:57] settled.
[1:14:00] But why, if you already have a provided
[1:14:02] way for your sins, does the son of God
[1:14:06] have to come down and die on a cross?
[1:14:10] Now we have to understand the Old
[1:14:11] Testament
[1:14:13] in order to get it because in the Old
[1:14:16] Testament the priest didn't only kill
[1:14:18] the lamb kill the lamb you you brought
[1:14:21] to remit your sins. That wasn't it. He
[1:14:24] also had to go inside the tent or the
[1:14:27] temple behind the curtain in the holy of
[1:14:30] holies
[1:14:32] get in there with blood. This is where
[1:14:35] the ark of the covenant was. You know,
[1:14:38] with the the Ten Commandments,
[1:14:41] it was in the Holy of Holies sitting
[1:14:43] there. No man could get in there. You
[1:14:47] would die if you got there. He the
[1:14:49] priest would get there. The mediator, he
[1:14:52] would get there with blood. And then
[1:14:55] there was that big plate of gold on top
[1:14:58] of the ark of covenant about three
[1:15:00] inches thick. A big plate of gold called
[1:15:02] the mercy seat. And that plate of gold
[1:15:05] was thirsty for blood.
[1:15:08] And that priest had to come and sprinkle
[1:15:11] blood on the mercy seat to appease the
[1:15:14] wrath of God over sin.
[1:15:18] Amen. Amen. And only if the blood was
[1:15:22] accepted, the p the priest would come
[1:15:24] out alive. And so the people would stand
[1:15:27] there, you know, outside the tent
[1:15:31] just wandering.
[1:15:34] They weren't rejoicing yet.
[1:15:36] Yeah, we've slayed the lamb. Praise God.
[1:15:38] No. No. The priest, he has to come out
[1:15:41] alive because if the priest dies, we all
[1:15:44] die. It's over. Amen.
[1:15:49] When the priest would come out alive, it
[1:15:53] would mean that the blood was accepted
[1:15:55] and the wrath of God over sin was
[1:15:57] appeased and the people would rejoice.
[1:16:01] Now, a normal human being couldn't get
[1:16:03] in there in the presence of God. You
[1:16:06] would die instantly
[1:16:08] because Adam lost that relationship with
[1:16:10] God. He did lost it.
[1:16:14] Because the relationship was lost, no
[1:16:16] man could get in the holy of holies but
[1:16:19] a mediator with blood. You with me? But
[1:16:23] when Jesus came to earth, he came to
[1:16:26] restore the relationship.
[1:16:29] When he died on the cross, not only did
[1:16:32] he take our sins upon him, not only did
[1:16:35] he pay the price for our sins, not only
[1:16:36] did he remit you your sins, but his
[1:16:40] blood went on the mercy seat and
[1:16:43] satisfied God rat over sin once and for
[1:16:46] all.
[1:16:48] And we have proof of that because the
[1:16:51] curtain was torn from top to bottom. And
[1:16:54] what was once hidden was now available
[1:16:57] in plain sight because relationship was
[1:17:00] restored.
[1:17:02] What nobody could see and live became
[1:17:05] available to all since the wrath of God
[1:17:08] was appeased by the blood of Christ.
[1:17:11] Communion with God was restored. A
[1:17:14] relationship with with God was made
[1:17:16] possible again.
[1:17:18] Now Jesus made a way for me to be in
[1:17:22] relationship for him again. What was
[1:17:25] lost in the Garden of Eden, fellowship
[1:17:28] with God is restored.
[1:17:31] In fact, those who believe in Christ as
[1:17:33] their savior, those who place their
[1:17:35] faith in the sacrifice on the cross,
[1:17:38] they become lovers with Christ, the
[1:17:40] Bible uses the analogy of husband and
[1:17:42] wife. You all know that. This is why I
[1:17:44] talk about relationship so much in
[1:17:47] opposition to religion. Relationship and
[1:17:51] religion, they don't go together. Not at
[1:17:55] all.
[1:17:56] Not at all.
[1:18:04] Let's read one more Luther quote. I hope
[1:18:06] you don't mind.
[1:18:08] Thus, the soul is free and cleared of
[1:18:10] all sin for the sake of faith. simply
[1:18:13] because the bethroal gift from the
[1:18:17] bridegroom that is because of faith and
[1:18:19] the soul is given the eternal
[1:18:21] righteousness of her bridegroom Christ.
[1:18:24] Is that not a joyous transaction when
[1:18:27] the rich noble upright bridegroom Christ
[1:18:30] takes the poor contemptable evil little
[1:18:33] in marriage and takes away all the
[1:18:36] evil she has and adorn her with all good
[1:18:39] things. So it is not possible that sin
[1:18:42] condemns her for she lies now on Christ
[1:18:45] and is consumed by him.
[1:18:49] Luther says that faith is a gift God
[1:18:53] gave you to begin with.
[1:18:57] All you need is faith. Paul says but
[1:19:00] then Luther says and God gives it to you
[1:19:04] because he's no respector of person.
[1:19:07] He gives the faith you need. He gives it
[1:19:09] to you. You can't be in church now and
[1:19:10] say, "Brother Joel, I wish I had that
[1:19:12] kind of faith to accept that exchange."
[1:19:15] No, he gave that faith to you. And then
[1:19:18] once you have that faith and you use it,
[1:19:20] a divine exchange happens. Before you
[1:19:23] used to be drawn to sin, but after the
[1:19:26] exchange, you are now drawn to your
[1:19:27] husband. Your desires change, your
[1:19:30] aspirations change. You are not
[1:19:32] reformed. You're not following a code of
[1:19:35] conduct or a set of rules. You're not
[1:19:37] fighting with yourself anymore because
[1:19:41] your heart was changed.
[1:19:44] It's about a new heart. Justification is
[1:19:48] about I will take away your heart of
[1:19:50] stone and give you a heart of flesh.
[1:19:54] You want to be with your husband now.
[1:19:57] You crave that relationship. You want to
[1:19:59] please your husband. You want to spend
[1:20:00] time with him. A divine exchange just
[1:20:03] happened by faith. A love unspeakable.
[1:20:06] You cannot explain such a love. Love
[1:20:09] with a capital L.
[1:20:12] How amazing that that royal being, a
[1:20:15] king, the king of kings, redeems such a
[1:20:18] miserable person as I, paying with his
[1:20:21] own life to offer to offer me all that
[1:20:24] belongs to him. In exchange for all that
[1:20:27] belongs to him to him, I gave him all
[1:20:30] that belongs to me. A divine exchange.
[1:20:34] Let's read second Corinthians again. He
[1:20:37] made Christ who knew no sin to be sin on
[1:20:40] our behalf
[1:20:42] so that in him we would become the
[1:20:44] righteousness of God. That is we would
[1:20:46] be made acceptable to him and placed in
[1:20:48] a right relationship with him by his
[1:20:50] gracious loving kindness.
[1:20:54] In that transaction, in that exchange,
[1:20:56] there's more than you think tonight.
[1:20:59] There's way more than you think. You
[1:21:02] become the righteousness.
[1:21:07] You become the righteousness.
[1:21:09] You do not receive righteousness.
[1:21:14] You become righteousness.
[1:21:16] There's a world of difference. Most
[1:21:19] Christians, they approach righteousness
[1:21:20] this way. I wish I could have a little
[1:21:23] righteousness. I wish I could feel
[1:21:26] righteous.
[1:21:28] No, you you don't feel righteous. You
[1:21:30] are righteous. You become righteous.
[1:21:34] When a king marries a woman,
[1:21:37] does she receives queen? No, she becomes
[1:21:41] queen.
[1:21:43] She becomes queen by oath. The new
[1:21:46] testament testament means oath. It's a
[1:21:48] new oath. It's speaking of Christ and
[1:21:50] his bride uniting.
[1:21:52] You know, she becomes queen. She becomes
[1:21:54] part of him. And we become the
[1:21:57] righteousness
[1:21:58] of God. And I can't help but think about
[1:22:00] Queen Esther. You know, she used to live
[1:22:03] on the countryside. She had a life of
[1:22:05] her own. But when she found favor with
[1:22:08] the king and he married her, her life
[1:22:12] has a peace and was over and new life
[1:22:15] began. She became queen. She didn't have
[1:22:18] to wander, you know, at night in in the
[1:22:21] castle trying not to be seen by the
[1:22:23] guards or she didn't have to pay for a
[1:22:26] visit, a tour visit of the castle. she
[1:22:28] was queen.
[1:22:30] But so many Christians, they they try to
[1:22:32] impersonate like they wish they were
[1:22:35] queen and so they dress like queens and
[1:22:37] they act like queens, but they're not
[1:22:39] queens because they don't have a
[1:22:41] relationship with the king.
[1:22:47] Amen. With that undeserved position as a
[1:22:51] queen that we get only because we found
[1:22:55] favor with the king comes a lot of
[1:22:58] benefits and perks prophesied in the
[1:23:01] book. Let let's read some Isaiah 53.
[1:23:06] Surely he has borne our griefs and
[1:23:09] carried our sorrows. Yet we esteemed him
[1:23:12] stricken and smitten by God and
[1:23:14] afflicted. But he was wounded for our
[1:23:18] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[1:23:20] iniquities and the chastisement for our
[1:23:24] peace was upon him. And by his stripes
[1:23:28] we are healed.
[1:23:30] We He took our grief. He took our
[1:23:33] sorrows. He took our our sickness and
[1:23:36] our affliction and our wounds and our
[1:23:38] transgressions and he gave us peace and
[1:23:40] he gave us healing.
[1:23:43] A divine exchange.
[1:23:45] Nothing I can do to deserve it. It's an
[1:23:50] act of love.
[1:23:52] Someone could ask this question tonight.
[1:23:56] Why to do all this?
[1:23:59] Why live this life and do all this? Why
[1:24:02] serve
[1:24:04] if I'm already saved without it?
[1:24:08] I thought I gained something out of it.
[1:24:12] I became a Christian and I started
[1:24:14] working and and doing things and I
[1:24:16] thought I gained something out of it. I
[1:24:18] thought I gained favor with God.
[1:24:23] I have a bad news and a good news for
[1:24:25] you tonight.
[1:24:28] The good news. You want the good or the
[1:24:30] bad? First?
[1:24:36] Let's go with the bad.
[1:24:39] The bad news is
[1:24:42] there's nothing you can do to make God
[1:24:45] love you more.
[1:24:53] And the good news is
[1:24:56] there's nothing you can do to make you
[1:24:59] to make God love you less.
[1:25:03] His love is unchangeable.
[1:25:06] Amen. Unchangeable.
[1:25:10] And so why do all this then if I gain
[1:25:12] nothing out of it? Let me ask you this.
[1:25:16] Why did Adam and Eve take care of the
[1:25:18] Garden of Eden?
[1:25:22] I mean, it was their full-time job.
[1:25:24] Basically, God created man and woman and
[1:25:28] he gave them a kingdom and dominion over
[1:25:31] the kingdom to take care of the kingdom.
[1:25:34] They had to name animals and, you know,
[1:25:37] switch trees around, different things,
[1:25:39] whatever that meant. They took care of
[1:25:42] the kingdom.
[1:25:44] But why did they do it?
[1:25:47] Was it to find favor with God?
[1:25:50] Was it to win something?
[1:25:53] I mean, they already had everything.
[1:25:56] They already had everything, right? They
[1:25:59] had nothing missing.
[1:26:02] Well, they should have sit.
[1:26:05] That's how the modern word the the
[1:26:07] modern world teaches us. You know, they
[1:26:11] put all this advertising
[1:26:13] on TV and on the side of the highways
[1:26:17] to make us, you know, crave for things
[1:26:19] we don't have. When you get this car,
[1:26:22] you'll be happy. When you go on this
[1:26:23] vacation, you'll be happy. When you do
[1:26:25] this, you'll be happy. And they do all
[1:26:27] this to keep us
[1:26:30] working.
[1:26:33] and and and we work overtime to get
[1:26:35] these things.
[1:26:37] But let somebody win $25 million.
[1:26:40] What do they do?
[1:26:42] They sit.
[1:26:45] I will never work one more day in my
[1:26:48] life.
[1:26:51] What could I gain out of it? I already
[1:26:53] have $25 million.
[1:26:56] But that's not scriptural.
[1:26:58] That is not scriptural.
[1:27:01] Now the day Esther became queen,
[1:27:04] her old life as a peasant was over. But
[1:27:07] as a queen, she had duties
[1:27:10] and she wanted to please her husband and
[1:27:12] help him, you know, rule the kingdom.
[1:27:15] Ain't that right?
[1:27:17] I mean,
[1:27:20] imagine Adam and Eve saying, "You're
[1:27:22] meaning we gain nothing from the work
[1:27:24] we're doing here in the garden?"
[1:27:27] No, Adam, you gain nothing because
[1:27:29] there's nothing more to gain. You
[1:27:31] already have everything.
[1:27:38] But if you find yourself in that
[1:27:39] position tonight where you want to gain
[1:27:43] something by your actions,
[1:27:47] I would like to say
[1:27:49] humbly that you haven't experienced this
[1:27:52] divine exchange
[1:27:55] because we only want to gain what we
[1:27:58] don't have.
[1:28:00] The minute you have that new car, you
[1:28:03] don't really want it anymore. or you
[1:28:05] want the next one. That's human nature.
[1:28:08] So if you find yourself wanting to gain
[1:28:11] something out of your Christian life,
[1:28:13] that thing you're trying to gain is
[1:28:15] something you don't have right now.
[1:28:19] Let's just hope you're trying to gain
[1:28:20] relationship or favor with God.
[1:28:24] You have found favor with God already.
[1:28:32] We cannot be
[1:28:35] Christians trying to win our seat in
[1:28:40] heaven.
[1:28:42] We cannot.
[1:28:44] That's now how Christ designed the plan.
[1:28:50] When a man realizes the value of God's
[1:28:54] gift, when a man realizes the value of
[1:28:57] the sacrifice on the cross and chooses
[1:29:01] to put his faith in Christ alone, a
[1:29:04] divine exchange happens. Something that
[1:29:07] transforms him forever.
[1:29:11] His old life ends, a new life begins.
[1:29:18] He's born again.
[1:29:20] A divine exchange.
[1:29:23] God took my sickness and gave me
[1:29:26] healing. A divine exchange. He took my
[1:29:29] anxiety and gave me peace.
[1:29:33] A divine exchange. He took my depression
[1:29:35] and gave me joy. A divine exchange.
[1:29:38] Don't tell me you're not interested in
[1:29:39] that exchange.
[1:29:41] That is not a one-time thing that
[1:29:44] happened 2,000 years ago. That exchange
[1:29:47] is available because that throne that
[1:29:50] used to be a throne of judgment is now
[1:29:53] become a throne of mercy because you're
[1:29:56] not a peasant anymore. You're a queen
[1:29:59] and you found favor in the eyes of the
[1:30:01] king. So you can come boldly to the
[1:30:03] throne of grace and and experience that
[1:30:07] divine exchange over and over again.
[1:30:09] Amen.
[1:30:11] He took my heart of stone and gave me a
[1:30:15] heart of flesh, a divine exchange. The
[1:30:19] world needs to hear about that exchange,
[1:30:21] not about a religion,
[1:30:23] but about a relationship with Christ,
[1:30:28] the relationship that Christ wants to
[1:30:30] have with us.
[1:30:33] He wants to Sometimes I wonder who wants
[1:30:37] the most. Who wants it the most? And I
[1:30:40] think the answer is Christ.
[1:30:42] He gave his life for that relationship.
[1:30:45] It's nothing we deserve. It's not
[1:30:48] distributed by merit. You cannot deserve
[1:30:51] it with God. You can't win your seat in
[1:30:55] heaven. You can't behave your way in
[1:30:57] heaven.
[1:30:59] Your way to heaven rather. You You can't
[1:31:02] work your way to heaven. You can't buy
[1:31:05] You can't buy your way to heaven.
[1:31:07] There's nothing you can do because Jesus
[1:31:10] paid it all. He did it all and he gave
[1:31:13] you faith as a beth throttle gift. He
[1:31:17] gave you faith
[1:31:20] as a gift. And now he asks you to
[1:31:24] believe on him, to trust him, to love
[1:31:27] him, to let him,
[1:31:30] to have faith enough to override your
[1:31:32] fear and run to him.
[1:31:36] that exchanges for everybody,
[1:31:40] all of us.
[1:31:42] And it's available tonight to whoever
[1:31:44] will. It's so simple. But we have to let
[1:31:49] go of pride and let go of trying.
[1:31:51] Because, you know, I've tried for 30
[1:31:53] years. I can't believe it's it's that
[1:31:55] simple. We have to let go of pride and
[1:31:58] let go of of trying.
[1:32:01] It's available now.
[1:32:05] But we have to override our fear and run
[1:32:08] to him.
[1:32:13] It's not a one-time thing.
[1:32:18] The mercies are new every morning.
[1:32:22] That divine exchange is available, you
[1:32:24] know, because that relationship is
[1:32:26] restored. You know, Queen Esther, she
[1:32:29] was queen. She's been queen for a while,
[1:32:33] but her mind wasn't renewed yet.
[1:32:37] She was in the castle, but the king
[1:32:39] hadn't called her for 30 days.
[1:32:43] And her pastor told her, you know, are
[1:32:45] you people is about to die. You need to
[1:32:48] go to the king.
[1:32:51] You remember the story? And she said,
[1:32:54] "No, I can't because if I go uh when I'm
[1:32:57] not called, I might die."
[1:32:59] She she did find favor.
[1:33:03] She was married to the king. She was the
[1:33:05] queen, but she didn't know yet.
[1:33:09] She didn't know what it meant. She
[1:33:13] thought the throne was still a throne of
[1:33:15] judgment. She thought if she'd come to
[1:33:17] the throne, she could be killed. But
[1:33:20] when she finally got there, when the
[1:33:23] king saw her, he said, "Whatever you
[1:33:25] want, if it is half of your kingdom, I
[1:33:28] give it to you.
[1:33:30] Write the letters yourself and seal it.
[1:33:35] The king didn't save the people. The
[1:33:38] queen did."
[1:33:41] Amen.
[1:33:43] Hallelujah.
[1:33:45] Jesus died to restore a relationship.
[1:33:49] You can come boldly to the throne
[1:33:52] knowing you found favor. You are Mrs.
[1:33:54] Jesus Christ.
[1:33:57] He didn't just die. He didn't just take
[1:34:00] your sins. He rose again. And he's here
[1:34:03] tonight ready to start a relationship
[1:34:06] with whoever will outside of religious
[1:34:09] walls in the secret place in your
[1:34:12] hearts.
[1:34:14] I have not come to Calgary to discourage
[1:34:17] you.
[1:34:19] I have not come to Calgary to tell you
[1:34:22] to tear your house down. You know that
[1:34:25] justification by faith, it's the
[1:34:28] foundation of the house.
[1:34:32] It is faith lays at the very foundation.
[1:34:37] Justification by faith,
[1:34:40] the very foundation of my Christian
[1:34:43] building.
[1:34:46] Yet, I'm afraid most Christians,
[1:34:49] they built houses, two stories, threecar
[1:34:52] garage on sand.
[1:35:00] You sit in a church and there's there's
[1:35:03] someone in church, you know, he's been
[1:35:05] there 25 years and he knows every Bible
[1:35:08] verse by heart and every message. He
[1:35:11] knows the page and the paragraph. He
[1:35:14] knows everything. He looks so strong in
[1:35:16] the faith. He's like a pillar in the
[1:35:18] church. And all of a sudden, a little
[1:35:21] wind blows and he's gone. And you wonder
[1:35:25] what happened?
[1:35:27] What happened? He had that great big
[1:35:31] house built like it was the biggest
[1:35:34] house on the block.
[1:35:37] How did that house fall?
[1:35:39] It had no foundation.
[1:35:43] Justification by faith is the foundation
[1:35:47] of our Christian lives. Knowing we found
[1:35:50] favor,
[1:35:54] but I haven't come to tell you to tear
[1:35:56] your house down. Maybe someone here
[1:35:58] tonight's been a Christian 20, 30, 40
[1:36:01] years and it's got a big and beautiful
[1:36:02] house. You don't have to tear it down,
[1:36:09] but you need the right foundation.
[1:36:12] or it will fall. And so I pray tonight
[1:36:15] someone will find the humility to go to
[1:36:19] the basement of the house and inspect
[1:36:22] the foundation.
[1:36:24] Inspect to see if it's made out of
[1:36:27] concrete or sand.
[1:36:30] And if you find sand instead of
[1:36:33] concrete,
[1:36:36] find courage to lift the house.
[1:36:40] Lift the house and pour concrete under
[1:36:44] it.
[1:36:46] Put your house on a brand new foundation
[1:36:49] tonight, church.
[1:36:51] Or it will fall. If you need to raise
[1:36:54] the house, do it, my brother. Don't be
[1:36:57] prideful. Be humble. Pour some concrete.
[1:37:00] Get out of that religion. Experience
[1:37:03] that divine exchange. It will change
[1:37:05] your heart. It will. Amen.
[1:37:09] It will change your heart.
[1:37:12] We all need a new heart.
[1:37:17] Amen. Let's inspect our Christian
[1:37:19] experience tonight as we bow our heads
[1:37:22] for prayer.
[1:37:28] Jesus,
[1:37:31] these few words I preached,
[1:37:34] they don't do justice to your word.
[1:37:39] They don't do justice to your sacrifice.
[1:37:46] They can't express properly
[1:37:52] the work of justification by faith,
[1:37:57] the restored relationship,
[1:37:59] the provision for the Christian, for the
[1:38:02] soul that believes, the gifts,
[1:38:06] the faith you give us.
[1:38:10] But I pray
[1:38:13] that these feeble words have reached to
[1:38:16] the heart of someone tonight.
[1:38:20] I pray someone realizes
[1:38:24] that the relationship is already
[1:38:26] restored.
[1:38:29] I pray someone realize they've already
[1:38:32] found favor.
[1:38:34] They don't have to do anything to find
[1:38:36] favor.
[1:38:38] The work is complete.
[1:38:43] May your Holy Spirit
[1:38:47] take these words and plant them in our
[1:38:49] hearts tonight
[1:38:52] that we may meditate on them. Inspect
[1:38:56] our houses, the foundations, and
[1:39:01] come out of this service a different
[1:39:04] people.
[1:39:08] May someone receive that divine exchange
[1:39:11] tonight. May someone that is anxious
[1:39:14] tonight receive peace.
[1:39:16] May someone that is discouraged receive
[1:39:19] joy.
[1:39:20] May someone that is sick be healed.
[1:39:24] Lord, make it happen tonight
[1:39:27] to any heart that believes.
[1:39:33] Hallelujah.
[1:39:34] I pray you be with that church and
[1:39:38] give them a new burden to serve.
[1:39:41] Not to gain anything or to find favor,
[1:39:45] but has the queen.
[1:39:49] Lord, empower them to rule the kingdom,
[1:39:52] to serve, to work,
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:57] testify,
[1:39:59] to shine their lights.
[1:40:03] May someone realize the power he has
[1:40:07] as Mrs. Jesus Christ tonight.
[1:40:11] It's my prayer in Jesus name.
[1:40:15] Amen.
[1:40:18] Amen. I don't understand how anybody
[1:40:21] would keep trying to make it on their
[1:40:24] own after tonight
[1:40:26] when the way has been made, the price is
[1:40:29] paid, and it's available freely.
[1:40:32] You know, Romans 10 says, "For with the
[1:40:36] heart one believes unto righteousness,
[1:40:39] and with the mouth confession is made
[1:40:42] unto salvation."
[1:40:44] Believe and confess. Stop hiding in the
[1:40:48] woods like Adam.
[1:40:50] Stop manufacturing your covering.
[1:40:53] I can't help but wonder what what would
[1:40:55] have happened if Adam had run to God
[1:40:59] instead of hiding. What if Adam run to
[1:41:02] God and say, "I messed up.
[1:41:06] I'm sorry,
[1:41:10] but you can do it tonight because a way
[1:41:13] has been made out of religion and back
[1:41:15] into a relationship with God. And so
[1:41:19] come as you are tonight,
[1:41:22] naked and ashamed, and let divine
[1:41:24] exchange take place."
[1:41:28] You know, God says in the Bible, "Fear
[1:41:30] not, for I am with you always."
[1:41:33] But I
[1:41:35] I wonder why most Christians
[1:41:39] have it upside down. It sounds more
[1:41:41] like, "I wish I was with you always, but
[1:41:44] I fear."
[1:41:46] But you don't have to.
[1:41:49] He kept saying, "Fear not. Fear not.
[1:41:52] Fear not. I'm with you. I'm with you."
[1:41:54] But all the while Christians are there
[1:41:57] far from God trying to reach him but
[1:42:00] afraid of coming to the throne.
[1:42:04] This can change tonight. You can come
[1:42:06] boldly to the throne because it's not a
[1:42:09] throne of judgment. It's a throne of
[1:42:11] mercy for the queen.
[1:42:16] Amen.
[1:42:17] Amen. So, I had on my heart to sing a a
[1:42:21] little special a song called Divine
[1:42:23] Exchange tonight
[1:42:25] as uh we end the service. And uh if you
[1:42:30] know it, you can sing along or you know,
[1:42:33] you can just pray and search your
[1:42:35] hearts.
[1:42:36] I pray it is a blessing for you. Is it
[1:42:40] working?
[1:42:41] [Music]
[1:42:56] Can you hear it
[1:42:59] on the cross?
[1:43:02] On my pain
[1:43:05] and the guilt
[1:43:08] and the shame.
[1:43:12] Jesus bore
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:15] the suffering
[1:43:18] to the grave
[1:43:21] to make me free.
[1:43:25] All the blood
[1:43:28] that was shed
[1:43:31] in now flows
[1:43:35] to cover sin.
[1:43:38] It washes clean
[1:43:41] and purifies
[1:43:45] in its heat
[1:43:48] and crimson time. Jesus he took my place
[1:43:55] in divine
[1:43:57] exchange. Hallelujah.
[1:44:01] Grace is mine
[1:44:04] now. I will live by faith for the one
[1:44:10] who saves. He gave all to give me mine.
[1:44:18] His spirit is
[1:44:22] present help.
[1:44:25] I'd be lost
[1:44:28] all by myself.
[1:44:30] [Music]
[1:44:32] He resurrects.
[1:44:35] He sanctifies.
[1:44:39] He's power
[1:44:41] [Music]
[1:44:42] and makes it mine.
[1:44:45] Jesus, he took my place in divine
[1:44:51] exchange.
[1:44:53] Hallelujah.
[1:44:55] Grace is mine.
[1:44:58] Oh now I will live by faith for the one
[1:45:04] who saves. He gave all to give me life.
[1:45:11] Jesus. Oh Jesus. He took my place in
[1:45:17] divine
[1:45:19] exchange.
[1:45:20] Hallelujah.
[1:45:23] Grace is mine.
[1:45:26] And now I will live by faith for the one
[1:45:32] who saves. He gave all to give me life.
[1:45:40] I lay down all lesser things
[1:45:45] for great again.
[1:45:47] He is alive
[1:45:50] inside
[1:45:51] of me.
[1:45:53] I lay down all lesser things
[1:45:58] for greater name.
[1:46:01] He is alive
[1:46:03] inside
[1:46:05] of me. I lay down I lay down all lesser
[1:46:09] things
[1:46:12] forever.
[1:46:14] He is alive
[1:46:17] inside
[1:46:19] of me. Oh Jesus, he took my place in
[1:46:26] divine
[1:46:27] exchange. Hallelujah.
[1:46:31] Grace is mine.
[1:46:35] Now I will live by flame. For the one
[1:46:40] who saves, he gave all who give me life.
[1:46:47] One more time. Jesus, Jesus, he took my
[1:46:51] place in divine
[1:46:54] exchange.
[1:46:56] Hallelujah.
[1:46:58] Grace is mine now. How I will live by

[1:49:00] of God. I'm no longer.
[1:49:12] I am a child
[1:49:16] of God from my mother's womb." Oh, from
[1:49:20] my mother's womb,
[1:49:23] you have chosen me.

[1:51:15] I am a child
[1:51:19] of God.
[1:51:22] Amen.
[1:51:24] Did you hear from the Lord tonight?
[1:51:28] There has been a divine exchange
[1:51:32] and we have the opportunity to accept
[1:51:34] that or reject that.
[1:51:37] It's one or the other. It's a wonderful
[1:51:40] thought to think that there's nothing
[1:51:41] more that we can do. We just need to
[1:51:44] accept what he's already done for us.
[1:51:48] Justification by faith is the foundation
[1:51:51] truly.
[1:51:53] We had a conversation about this a while
[1:51:55] ago. what it would be like to preach
[1:51:58] about justification.
[1:52:00] And uh I said, you know, Brother Joel,
[1:52:03] that's exactly what the church age book
[1:52:06] was based on, justification by faith,
[1:52:10] the works of the church age messengers
[1:52:13] and the works of the Holy Ghost in those
[1:52:16] messengers. But I just think what a
[1:52:18] wonderful, wonderful thought tonight.
[1:52:20] There's nothing more that we can do.
[1:52:23] Let's just bow in prayer tonight.
[1:52:26] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[1:52:28] tonight we thank you for one more time
[1:52:31] coming by our way and just reminding us,
[1:52:34] Lord Jesus, that we don't need to
[1:52:36] pretend,
[1:52:37] Father, we don't need fig leaves in the
[1:52:40] day in which we live. You have provided
[1:52:43] us with a garment
[1:52:45] that's spotless, pure, and white, Lord
[1:52:49] Jesus. And Father, we accept it the way
[1:52:52] that you've given it to us, Lord,
[1:52:54] through this word through your
[1:52:56] vindicated prophet to the age in which
[1:52:58] we live in. Lord, we're not looking for
[1:53:00] another religion. Father, we're so
[1:53:03] thankful that you have given us the
[1:53:05] ability to have an ear to hear what your
[1:53:08] spirit has said to this church, to this
[1:53:10] age. And Father, we dress ourselves in
[1:53:14] that word tonight.
[1:53:16] Father, if we have any other thoughts or
[1:53:18] any other ideas or traditions or
[1:53:21] religions,
[1:53:22] let us cast them down tonight in the
[1:53:25] name of Jesus Christ. Your word says to
[1:53:28] take every thought into captivity. And
[1:53:30] when those traditional thoughts creep
[1:53:32] in, Father, help us to take them into
[1:53:34] captivity. Father, when our our family
[1:53:38] traditions creep in and try and tell us
[1:53:40] that that's the way we ought to do
[1:53:42] things, help us to take them into
[1:53:44] captivity and to cast them down, Lord
[1:53:47] Jesus, and to allow your word to have
[1:53:49] the preeminence that it desires, that
[1:53:52] you desire, Father. Lord Jesus, we pray
[1:53:55] that you would just give us the ability
[1:53:57] to recognize we are nothing on our own.
[1:54:02] But, Father, because you have called us
[1:54:04] from our mother's womb before the
[1:54:08] foundation of the world, Lord, because
[1:54:10] you chose us first, that's why we love
[1:54:13] you.
[1:54:15] Father, we just pray that tonight, Lord,
[1:54:17] you would go with us as we go our
[1:54:19] separate ways. We pray that you would
[1:54:21] keep your hand upon the Galant family,
[1:54:23] Lord, as they sojourn with us here in
[1:54:25] Alberta.
[1:54:27] Father, that you would just give them
[1:54:28] traveling mercies, Father.
[1:54:31] Lord Jesus, tonight we pray that you
[1:54:33] would, Father, be with Sister Mariel.
[1:54:36] Father, she has a request tonight that
[1:54:39] you would be her strength, Father, as
[1:54:41] she goes to work at the at the Drum
[1:54:45] Heler institution. Father, with people
[1:54:47] that probably have never heard of you,
[1:54:50] and if they have heard of you, you're
[1:54:52] probably like a fairy tale to them.
[1:54:53] Lord, help her, Lord, to be able to go
[1:54:56] and bear witness that there is more than
[1:54:59] just a fairy tale. There is truly a
[1:55:01] divine exchange and it's taken place and
[1:55:05] father we're still here and that means
[1:55:07] that there's still more opportunities
[1:55:10] for the divine exchanges to happen. Give
[1:55:13] her strength, Father, and encouragement.
[1:55:15] We pray. Father, we just ask that you
[1:55:17] would be with Sister Kindness as well,
[1:55:19] Father, as she travels. That you would
[1:55:21] give her traveling mercies, Lord, that
[1:55:23] you would bring her back home again
[1:55:25] safely at the appointed time. Thank you,
[1:55:27] Father, for taking Sister Rebecca home
[1:55:29] to Nigeria, Lord, to be wed with her
[1:55:32] husband. Father, Lord, we're so thankful
[1:55:35] for your traveling mercies, for your
[1:55:37] many provisions that you make for us all
[1:55:39] along our ways. Now, Lord, as we go
[1:55:41] home, as we go our separate ways, we
[1:55:43] pray that you would just continue
[1:55:46] reminding us, Lord Jesus, that we are in
[1:55:48] the midst of a divine exchange. It's not
[1:55:51] something that just took place one time
[1:55:53] in our life when we stumbled into the
[1:55:55] mission on the corner when our parents
[1:55:57] told us about you, Father. It is a
[1:55:59] continual renewing. Oh, Father. It's a
[1:56:02] continual realization. It's a
[1:56:04] relationship. It's not a hierarchy. It's
[1:56:07] not a lordship, Father, where you want
[1:56:09] us to be like your minions. You treat us
[1:56:12] as your bride with kindness and love and
[1:56:15] encouragement. Father, we're so thankful
[1:56:18] that you are a gentleman, Lord.
[1:56:20] Help us Lord to be
[1:56:23] kind gentlemen as well. Help us Lord to
[1:56:26] be loving wives. Lord help us to be
[1:56:30] children with respect to our parents.
[1:56:32] Lord, Father, help us to realize this
[1:56:35] divine exchange is continual until the
[1:56:38] day you take us home. We love you
[1:56:41] tonight, Father. We just commit each
[1:56:43] word that's been spoken into your hands
[1:56:45] now for your glory. In Jesus Christ's
[1:56:48] name we pray.
[1:56:50] Amen.
[1:56:51] Amen. Can we sing that song? He has
[1:56:54] forgiven me.
[1:56:58] He has forgiven me.
[1:57:01] Just a chorus tonight.
[1:57:04] He has
[1:57:08] forgiven
[1:57:10] me.
[1:57:12] My sins have been washed
[1:57:17] from his memory
[1:57:22] by the blood
[1:57:24] of the lamb
[1:57:27] of Calary.

[1:59:03] about the divine exchange.

[1:59:54] from me.
