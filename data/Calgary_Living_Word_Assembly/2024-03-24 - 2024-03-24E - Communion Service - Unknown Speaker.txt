thank you we want to commit this service in every need into your hands For Your Glory now we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians certainly enjoy the songs and the special thank you sister Michelle it's wonderful it always sets an atmosphere if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to read a story that's fairly familiar I just like to take a little look at uh foot washing and communion and we'll just take some time as we have the communions services and and I don't want to take too long tonight but maybe just set a little bit of a background for it and that comes from Luke 7 a very familiar scripture Luke chapter 7 it's the story of Simon the fery I'm sure we're all familiar with that but if you're not it's about the washing of the Lord's feet amen and as I looked at this I was able to see there's more to the the washing of feet than just simply this story or everything in the New Testament this goes back to Old Testament and isn't it beautiful because Christ never did anything God never does anything outside of the scripture unless his father First shows him this foot washing thing is exactly out of the Old Testament and uh we'll get into that Lord willing verse 36 of Luke 7 tonight and one of the Pharisees desired Ed him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house bought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did White them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the FY which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner and Jesus answering said unto to him totally Discerning his heart and Jesus answering said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 Pence the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou Hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon seest thou this woman I entered into thine house and thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hair of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou did not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven amen let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your word we're so thankful that Lord Jesus we can see ourselves in your word amen because we know that we fit that description we just ask that you would break this bread of life to us fresh once again amen you would speak to our hearts Lord Jesus as we approach your table tonight father as we approach the partaking of the communion and the foot washing father we pray that Lord we could do it humbly that we could do it purely father that we could discern your body properly Hallelujah we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I will certainly try not to take very much time certainly thankful for everyone coming out a little earlier it's a little bit different but Lord willing uh at the end of it we'll be able to get home a little earlier and uh you know if the spirit moves and we want to stay a little bit later than I could see that happening also we just want to we just want to have Liberty where the Lord is don't we tonight I just want to talk about foot washing and and I think it's a an amazing thing when you look at it as I mentioned there's uh never an accident it's never a coincidence the way the Lord does things it's always with a purpose and uh it's always according to scripture and if you'll turn with me to Psalms 58 verse 10 Psalms 58 verse 10 Psalms 58:10 says the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the Vengeance he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked so that a man shall say verily there is a reward for the righteous verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth and isn't it interesting brothers and sisters out of John Chapter 13 where we are going to read tonight if you want to turn over to that just talking about foot washing we know that Jesus I just want to talk about this a little bit before we go into it we'll have the communion service first don't get nervous that we'll have foot washing first we'll have the communion service first then we'll do the foot washing and then we'll have some testimony and song afterwards in case anybody needs to leave um we can do it that way but I just want to discuss the the foot washing portion I think it's so f fascinating the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the Vengeance he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked and and here we have this this God in verse 11 so that a man shall say verily there is a reward for the righteous verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth do you imagine those disciples understood that this scripture was actually the one bowing down to wash their feet first he was washing their feet the god that's going to judge the Earth he's going to wash his feet in the blood of all of the Sinners was bowing down to wash their feet with water not with blood they did not have to go through the persecution they don't have to go through the Judgment that God who is righteous who is going to execute Vengeance on this world for turning him away was willing to actually be a footwash flunky brother bradam said to wash his disciples feet with water and to say to them do you know what I've done unto you do we recognize what he was doing unto them he was displaying Grace unto them because there is coming a time where that God of vengeance is going to wash his feet in the blood of the wicked and we know that the blood is going to run up to the horse's brother Idol for many miles in the valley megiddo I think it is in in in Israel in in the revelations it says that it's going to happen but here this righteous judge is going to wash his feet in the blood of the wicked but verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth and here the disciples in John chapter 13 we know that Jesus verse four says of John Chapter 13 He riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto himl Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter you don't realize Peter what's happening here but I am the god that's going to execute judgment that's going to execute Vengeance on this sinful world one day but I'm first going to minister Grace unto those who I love those who I call not servants anymore but I call friends and not even just servants or friends but the bride those ones I'm going to wash their feet so if you know what I'm doing unto you you ought to be willing to do that one to another this is a very significant thing this foot washing thing isn't just a weird thing that William Mary and brandom came out with this this goes right back to the Old Testament this is an ordinance to recognize one day there is going to be a Vengeance there's going to be a judgment but it's going to be feet that are washed in blood but here he is this God of Vengeance demonstrating Grace with water and humbling himself before his disciples before his friends to wash their feet and to say to them do you you don't even know what I'm doing here this is the god of Glory tabernacled in flesh and I am going to humble myself before you and wash your feet I just I got into this and sometimes it's just like getting into a a pot of honey like brother bradam talked about the bears in his tent and you know you just start to see more and more and more I hope it's not too convoluted and and confusing tonight I certainly don't mean it to be that way but I I just think it's beautiful the way the Lord does things he never ever does things just by accident it's always always exactly according to the scripture amen you know this is the god that we serve brothers and sisters the one that actually will one day come back and be the judge will actually execute judgment and will wash his feet in blood but here we have the opportunity to wash his feet tonight Hallelujah with water the way that he instructed us we have Grace one to another and we know his disciples he told them how will the world know that you love me he said if you have love one for another and and that's that's not it's easier said than done isn't it in the flesh we can't do that but with his spirit in our lives we have the ability to love one another with with a love that goes well beyond what we can comprehend that that passes all understanding but I just wanted to talk a little bit tonight about this house of Simon the parable of the of the of the woman and and and how Simon the most religious one he had no idea who it was that was with him at his house he called Upon Jesus we talked about this we preached on it a while AG go but we can call Upon Jesus we can invite him to the services we can invite him to our homes invite him to our lives but then not recognize him or appreciate him when he's there where two or three are gathered together in his name he's there in their midst he's here tonight brothers and sisters he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the same one that came and stood on stage with his his Prophet the seventh angel messenger that same God is right here tonight amen if you're willing to believe that and even if you're not willing to believe it his word said so so he's here there's no amount of unbelief that will stop him from actually fulfilling his word but that same one is here tonight and you know we have the ability to recognize his presence and to wash his feet when we wash one another's feet brothers and sisters you're not washing your brother your sister's feet at least I certainly hope not you know I think about this story here this woman who has the uh the hair right and and many might say well she was a prostitute brother Barry she probably was really unkempt and maybe she was but as Brothers and Sisters in Christ would we ever have the audacity to do that to wash a brother or a sister's feet with our tears amen let alone to get one or two hairs out of place maybe even when we just wash in a bucket oh we brush our our head against their knee or something and and and it's a problem this woman was all in there was nothing reserving her all of her reserv ations were gone she was pouring her life out washing his feet because she recognized he was left unattended brothers and sisters don't let anything stand in the way of you and God tonight anytime you have the opportunity to wash a brother or sister's feet recognize you're not washing your brother or sister's feet it's not about your brother or your sister it's all about you and God and we have the ability to allow someone to actually do that it's just like praying one for another but this God that we serve brothers and sisters he will execute judgment one day and we know that's what he did in Simon's house seest this woman my I entered into thine house and thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head why we need to recognize his presence amen you know there was a time where the disciples they said they were expecting Jesus to be someone different weren't they the the whole world was expecting a different Jesus they were expecting someone to come and execute judgment and to be that one who was going to wash his feet in the blood of human beings to to to set them free from the captors to get rid of the occupiers that's what they were expecting but they didn't recognize there was a lot of scripture that had to be fulfilled they didn't recognize there were seven whole church ages that had to happen and and we know that the disciples asked him in Acts chap 1 verse four it says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which he saith he ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power now I know that we all know it I'm sure in the church age book brother Bram talks about he couldn't tell them everything that was going to happen because there were seven full Church ages that had to be fulfilled and and if they knew the pressure and the trials that were going to come their way they probably would have fainted but they have the ability by his Spirit to withstand the Antichrist spirit in every single age you know we need to I I just want to try and encourage us I say we need to but I I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters to recognize the spirit of God recognize our brother and our sister not to be just our brother and our sister Holy Ghost filled Christian brother and sister the Lord Jesus Christ manifest in flesh the word made flesh that's the song that we sing We Are the word made flesh today that is what the scriptures say hallelujah so if we are this is the Lord Jesus Christ right here amen and I firmly believe it with all my heart brothers and sisters this is it this is the second coming of Jesus Christ the word coming of the Lord manifesting in his bride body and the world's looking for 60 foot Jesus but I want to say this is it right here brothers and sisters this is the Lord Jesus Christ right here let's discern his body properly tonight out of the Mighty God unveil 1964 brother bradam says I was reading a story some years ago and in this story it said a great Noble King I forget the name of him just now I I wasn't thinking about speaking of the story it perhaps fiction but it leads us to a point that gives us a background on what we want want to say this King he was such a noble King and such a great lover of his subjects till one day before his guard and his royalty he said today you see me for the last time for many years right and his guard and his Noble said unto him good King why are you saying that are you going to a foreign country somewhere to become an alien he said said no I'm staying right here well said I'm I'm going out amongst my subjects I'm going to become a peasant I'm going to cut wood with the wood Chopper I'm going to the to the ground with a toiler I'm going to prune the vines with those who prune Vines I'm going to be one of them in order to get better acquainted with what they are doing amen and I love them and I want to be more acquainted with them personally I love the way he says it they won't know me but yet I want to be acquainted with them in that way and the next morning when his delegates all of his people seen him or the ones was in the palace take off his crown and lay it upon the seat the throne and take off his robe and put on peasants clothes walk out amongst the common people people excuse me now in that little story we find out then about God they said to the king king we want you we love you we want you to remain King but he wanted to become one of them to know them better that they would know him better really what he was it was it it would display to them what he really was and and that's what God did he changed himself from being Jehovah God to become one of us that he might suffer he might taste death he might know what the sting of death was and take the penalty of death upon himself I could just stop there and probably preach for a little while amen what a tremendous thing it is yes to think that he just stepped aside from all of his glory and came down and took the sting of death for us and not just the sting of death but total humiliation beat to a pulp he washed feet with the lowly he dwelt in the tents with the poor he slept in the woods and in the streets with those who were under privileged he become one of us that he might understand us better and that we might understand him better and to think that in all points that were tempted he was also tempted he came down so that he could actually intercede for us so that he could be the high priest of our confession so when we wash one another's feet brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us take the time and recognize what it is we're doing it is not a light thing it's not a simple tradition of the church this is absolutely an ordinance of God we have been given this instruction through the word of God and it's just so beautiful because the prophet in our day he just simply said get back in line get back to the word and stay in line and this is an ordinance that he gave if you do this happy are you if you do these things because you recognize the Lord Jesus Christ you discern his body and his body isn't just the wine and and and and the bread it's not just the body and the blood it's his feet also 1964 the presence of God unrecognized this is the story that we read tonight brother Bram talking about it Simon the Pharisee and the ill- famed woman but the city they didn't have no confidence in him at the Pharisees house he invited him down at Simon a Pharisee and and had met a great supper and Pharisee wanted to prove to them he was no Prophet I so he was back there toasting with his glasses and his goblets and all the perfumes in the house can you imagine that just making a mockery of God manifest in flesh it just reminds me of the king making a mockery of God in the day when we know there was a hand that came and rode on the wall and said you know what your time is over and that same God was right there in this man's house and he was mocking making toasts and and having fun at his expense right why and Jesus had got in a in a past the footwash flunky and had sat down there and dirty and stinky off the field on him where the animals had been along the path and his garments that's the reason they washed feet in them days and you see the first thing when you're invited to a home there in Palestine when they wore those sandals the first thing they did did was to wash your feet and then give you something to walk on their carpets the great Persian rugs and things was beautiful the next thing they done they give you some oil in your hand it's got out of a little apple that's found way in the mountain the rose Apple after the rose is gone it leaves the apple and fine perfumes and they rub it all over their face and that direct raise of the pales and son is is horrible and you see that creates an odor and and then when you do then the host comes to the door and he kisses them on the neck and makes them welcome how did them flunkies ever let Jesus get by without washing his feet or giving him oil to anoint himself or even kiss him welcome now brother Bram he doesn't even answer that he just asked the question but I can't help but think there was a direction by someone when this man comes through the door step aside maybe direct him to go and sit back over there so we can go and see him and make toast and mock him and and make fun of him and and then when we're done with that we'll just ignore him because we know he's no Prophet can you imagine that the direction that must have happened yeah because we know that this was the custom and we know that the footwash flunky would have been paid to stand there at the door that would have been his job to make sure every single person coming in can you imagine the the Palestinian rugs and the fine stuff they had inside the houses for the footwash flunky to let somebody come by with stinky animal dong on their feet and come in and spoil their party while they're going to eat they've got to smell this guy's stinky feet can you imagine that right there had to have been a direction to say leave this one alone because we're going to do something with him tonight and you know one day we'll see this man we'll see him stand before the white Throne of judgment and give an account for the actions that took place and I'm not saying I know that I'm an authority I'm just saying just logically it would almost make sense that that could be the case there was a direction from someone to say just leave this one alone we want to have some fun we want to mock him not knowing that this was the one that's going to execute judgment this was the one that's going to restore the Kingdom of Israel back but it just wasn't at the right time but we know in paragraph 90 here it says but there was a little prostitute out on the street and we know that prostitute is what we are brothers and sisters that is an example of every single human being that accepts Jesus Christ as their savior all them religionists there now the whole company did not recognize him and a little woman of ill Fame she looked in through perhaps the gate and she seen him sitting like a Wallflower that's the way he is today amongst a bunch of religious too a Wallflower unwelcome unwanted filthy dirty Holy Roller they call it some kind of a a person that isn't in their right mind a fortune teller mental telepathy or some kind of an evil name and Jesus I'll get to it in a few minutes said speak a word against the son of man it shall be for forgiven you oh but when the Holy Ghost has come to do the same thing one word will never be forgiven you see remember whose feet you're washing tonight brothers and sisters but there in that little woman there that little woman seen he needed service and she rushed in real quickly went and got an alabaster box full of oil probably had bought it with the money from her prostitution can you imagine that but what was it she might have thought he is a prophet but I I remember another woman in my fix another character like mine she had the opportunity and she recognized him and she was forgiven up there at the well of sikar last night we talked of it and and if I could only get to him I know who he is I'll do him a service if the rest of them I I don't care what they do I'll do him a service I'll recognize he's the son of God she got a revelation and when that Revelation hit her heart there was nothing going to stop her from it was there she run in she got real close to him she felt so guilty that's the way a real penitent sinner feels in his presence guilty and the tears began to fall and she was trying to hide them they they dropped on his feet she was going to anoint him but the tears dropping on his feet can you imagine the scenario she got to the place where she couldn't even control herself what she wanted to do she couldn't even do the only thing she could do was drop to his feet humble herself completely and totally At His Feet just a mess in tears at his feet and she began to wipe them and crying and wiping them with her hands and and his his feet was all getting mused up with the dirt that was on it and if you want to really believe it the stink of the animals off the trail everyone walked the same Trail and there it was the stink on him sitting there and her tears was dropping on his feet and she was trying to wipe them off and she had no towel and you know the rest of the story her hair was there she used the covering that he gave her that God gave her she was probably raised in a Christian home and she knew that was her covering and that hair is what she used to wipe those tears and that stink off his feet and and to use that ointment that she probably got from her ill Fame but here we have this one who was going to execute judgment what did he do he said your sins are forgiven you he did not judge her for it he judged the fery the religious one the one that was all puffed up saying hey man I'm all good everything that I do in my life is perfect I've never sinned in my life we don't ever want to get there brothers and sisters the moment we get there it's just like the Pharisee tonight I just want to encourage us as we go forwards I want to study this a little further but think about it whose feet are you really washing tonight it is not just something that we do out of tradition it's not just something that's just an ordinance given by William Mary and bradam Jesus Christ said this to his friends happy happy are ye if you do these things and he is the one that led by example he didn't just go out and say go do this he showed them what to do and then he said go do it so God richly bless you tonight I just I I'll change the order of the service tonight we will go to the communion table we will talk in the future about communion we'll talk about the Lord's body Discerning the Lord's body there's so much in there I I really don't want to preach a a big sermon every time we have a communion service I just want to have a little exhortation to stimulate us to really think about what we're doing because the there's so much in a service like this tonight so maybe stand with me if you will and we'll just call the musician and and uh the brothers to come to the front and we'll just change the order of the service we'll go ahead and read from 1 Corinthians chapter 11 1 Corinthians 11 verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we should judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come let's just take a moment or two and T one for another before we proceed [Music] Heavenly Father Lord tonight we just Lord our
