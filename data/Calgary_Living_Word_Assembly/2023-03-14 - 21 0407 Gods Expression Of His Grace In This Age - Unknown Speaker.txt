the Lord trust that in the middle of the week the Lord wants to bestow a blessing upon us he wants to recharge our batteries he wants to speak to us one more time the beautiful part is we want to give him the opportunity to do that let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord one more time we're just so thankful that we can all be at our posts of Duty father those people who are tuned in those people who are helping to make the service possible tonight Lord Jesus myself as I stand before you Lord I pray that tonight something special will happen father that you will just speak to the hearts of your children Lord that I could just get out of the way as our brother sang let go and just let you do it father that's what we want we don't want to get in your way we want we don't want to hinder your program father we want to further your program we just want to say be it unto me according to thy will according to Thy word so that your life can come to pass inside us father Lord we just ask that you would bless our little service tonight in a real special way father we pray that if there's any prayer requests tonight father that you would just meet them sovereignly according to the needs in your children we want to remember Sister Grace's sister father we thank you for bringing her through to a recovery Lord we could pray that you would just continue watching over her Lord pray that you would just bring her to a full restoration we pray that you would be with sister Grace's mom who has it pray that you would just have mercy upon her father that you would just allow her Lord Jesus to not suffer through it Lord that you would just bring her through it swiftly we pray that you would watch over her dad as well father who doesn't have it we just thank you for your tender hand of Mercy in our lives Lord and the many other countless people that we know father who have been affected by this plague by this virus Lord we pray that you would just be with the families that you would just minister to those whose hearts are broken father those people maybe who have lost loved ones Lord we pray that you would just watch over those people who maybe are unsure father whether they should take a virus vaccine Lord Jesus we pray that you would be with those who have taken the vaccine Lord we pray that you would be with those who have been sick with the disease father Lord we're in a time of of real confusion but we know just like in the wilderness that you told Moses to create a brass Serpent and if the people would look upon that serpent that they would live even if they are bit so tonight father I pray that we could just look upon that serpent that we wouldn't look to men that we wouldn't look to science but that we would look to the almighty God the author and the finisher of our faith Lord that's what we desire tonight Lord Jesus is more of you and less of us less of this world less of mankind but more of you father because we know that the dimensions are blending that just any day now something real special is going to happen father and we just want to be found with oil in our lamps we know that's the only thing that's going to save us Lord we just love you father we pray that you would just sovereignly speak to us Lord as we commit this service into your hands tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen Hallelujah God bless you musicians thank you so much once again for bringing your gifts to the house of the Lord I trust everyone is having a good day if you have your Bibles tonight I just can't get out of First Corinthians chapter 13 so we'll just trust the Lord we'll bless it then I'd like to turn over to Hebrews chapter 6. First Corinthians chapter 13. Hebrews chapter 6. tonight I'll be talking a little bit out of the message what is the attraction on the mount of 1965 so in First Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 9 um we know in part for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face for now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 6. in parallel or in conjunction or in course with verse 10. Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works of Faith toward God of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the Dead and eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we've spoken you're holy writ we pray Lord Jesus that you would just bless it that you would just open our eyes of understanding that you would just give us ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church not tomorrow not yesterday but today right now tonight father we pray that you would just give us a fresh portion Lord Jesus that it would be fresh Manna Lord God that it would just be a fresh bloody sacrifice to us once again that we would just be able to see that that that that that lion that John turned to sea but he saw a bloody lamb father we pray that tonight this would be one more Living Sacrifice to us father that would just nourish our spiritual bodies father we just ask that you would just take control of this service now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated in Hebrews chapter 4 verse 16 let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in a time of need when have we ever had such a time of need as we do now we were just talking about it how in in 9 11 and uh just it's interesting I just find this fascinating in 9 11 there was so much broadcast of the blood and the fire and the carnality the Carnage The the pain the suffering the images that were presented to the world all over the place and everybody had such a desire to get back to God to to find a way to be saved and and here we have a global pandemic where people are supposedly dying in such great numbers and all of the stuff that's happening according to what's what this virus is but there's way less desire for God there's way less attraction to the mount and uh there's still a few people though that have that desire and I just want to underscore that point that if we have that desire we are blessed above all it's not elitism even though it truly is because not everyone has the desire and if we have the desire it is the greatest thing that we could ever ever ever ever achieve there's nothing greater in this world or the world to come that we could achieve than to have the desire to actually hear the word for our day brother Toby he he preached the message when he spoke last time the expression of God's grace Through the Ages and I just can't get away from that thought either and brothers and sisters that's what we're here to talk about tonight is God's expression of his grace in this age we can look at the age to come and we can look at the age behind but what good are they if we don't experience that Grace today and it needs to be today forget about tomorrow and forget about yesterday because neither one of them matter in the moment right now well we have our our breath in our lungs and our eyes are open and our our cognitive thinking is happening our reasoning we have the devil continually bombarding us with thoughts and thoughts and thoughts and ideas and thoughts and it's bombarding us with it we know that brother Branham said the lid was taken off of hell and they're not interested so much in all of the mainstream Christianity because they don't have oil there's an anointing hmm but if you think about it you have all the guns of Hell trained on you if you have the ability to hear this is no time to get lazy this is no time to get tired this is the time to press in you know how the world says it when the going gets tough the tough gets going it's all all these things are based on scriptural principles when the going gets tough It's Time to knuckle down and know what God we serve not be wondering not not not flailing back and forth kind of in kind of out I can't go and serve God according to the message of the hour because someone did something to me sometime or some somebody did something to my parents somewhere along the way what does that have to do with our our own experience with the Lord Jesus Christ he's not going to say to us if we stand Before the Throne if we do he's not going to say oh did that person offend you that's why you're there you know I gave you Grace and he's gonna I've got to be concerned about that he's going to say did you take the provided way that I gave you for the age in which you lived and that way for us it's not a boat it's not a boat it's a body change it's understanding that whether we live or we die we get a body change someone has to do it someone has to be there to be the recipient I just want to talk about us tonight and and Who We Are once again just another another mix of the leftovers that we've probably heard a hundred thousand times but you know he has a way of making it fresh we were talking about it again just something else quick conversations how profound they are when Brothers poor from vessel to vessel sisters Fellowship around the world you know the messages these same messages that were being preached years ago they weren't being preached the way they are today it's a further anointing as that Capstone comes down we sang that song it's manifesting time what are we manifesting we're manifesting him if we were to read that that scripture is it the Song of Solomon I think it is how how his beloved is there and and he's just catching glimpses of him here and there it's almost like and throughout the ages it's been that way to all the saints but brothers and sisters we are standing here today face to face full Revelation the entire word opened before us if we believe Revelations 10 7 and that book is open and it's on earth now it's not coming in the future but it's Satan's job to take and make millions and billions of people think that it's coming in the future that's happening in some future age that's why I can't get away from it I probably won't for a long time just like I harped on the Holy Ghost now I'm going to intertwine the Holy Ghost with the cloud because if we realize what that cloud is it's not just some event it's not God just vindicating his man saying you know this guy was a good guy this is my man if you you just hear him you'll be saved and and truly if you do you will be but something really really significant happened in 1963 If people could catch that Revelation that the coming of the Lord is here right now that it's happened that it's not some crazy whacked out perusia doctrine that it's us for and no more no it's a doctrine of a devil if we could understand that that Grace is actually standing on Earth today what would we be doing we think about those days about when maybe we'll start to see loved ones brothers and sisters I I just want to say this I just feel inspired to say this if we if we think we're going to see loved ones then and and things will be good it's going to be too late then we have got to be ready to see loved ones today we have to make sure that we have oil in our lap today because we know that all all ten of them were virgins right the story of the ten virgins they're all virgins and they all had lamps the only difference is five of them had oil and five of them did not have oil and the five that didn't have oil they asked give us some oil it's time we know the bridegroom cometh we've heard the shout too but what did the five wise virgins say they said sorry we just have enough for us I can't give you two you got to go buy it yourself go find it and while they went searching for that oil the bridegroom came and he closed the door he closed the door not the brides not not not not the five wise virgins they just went in where they were called to go in because they had the oil in their lamps they were ready while the others were searching so if we want to put that in a timeline think about it the shouts happened the bridegroom cometh behold stand and trim your lamps that's already happened in our lifetime maybe not in our lifetime maybe before our lifetime the bridegroom cometh the bridegroom is here if sunset Mountain was truly the coming of the Lord right have we got oil in our Labs brothers and sisters that door is going to close any day now when that door closes it's too late that's totally inspired for right now that's completely not in my notes that's bizarre praise the Lord out of what is the attraction 1965-0725e he says to speak a word is a man confirm a word is God to say something is one thing God to do it is another it's like a proverb for our age hey it just it just struck me it was so profound for me to hear that to speak a word is a man confirm a word is God to say something is one thing God to do it is another thing God don't need any interpreter I just love this quote he does his own interpretation and we know how he does his own interpretation according to the prophet of Malachi 4 of Revelations 10 7. he made it expressly clear how God interprets his own word isn't it amazing to think that we have that Revelation it's just something that we just have it's just part of who we are there might be people that are listening right now that don't know what that is and I'll say it what it is God interprets his own word by bringing it to pass but how is he going to bring it to pass if somebody doesn't speak it right there's got to be an inspiration from somewhere from the inside of the inside that just speaks the word not cry we know in Moses day he said to him why cry why are you crying to me you can see that I delivered you you saw the plagues you saw everything that's happened I raised you up to be a delivery you saw the burning bush all these different things you came out of out of Egypt and and you went on the back side of the desert all of your life and now here you are and you're crying you've got that stick in your hand speak the word and go forwards brothers and sisters I believe that somehow somewhere along the way it almost comes to the place where it just becomes common to us where we're just lackadaisical where it's just we just hope that we'll hear from God someday that maybe somehow some way he'll just make himself more real to us I'm talking about myself here maybe he'll just Express himself in a greater way he's expressed himself the greatest way that he can the way that he's chosen through a prophet of our day we've taken the message of the hour we have the fullness of the word he's waiting for us to just speak the word Mark 16 in action that's the true church somewhere and all I want to do is try and encourage us to just have that kind of Faith to have that kind of encouragement to not listen to the devil when you get that idea when something comes up in your life where you want to say Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus you're a trespassing devil and you have no Authority get lost when we have that rise up inside us and we need to speak those words maybe we'll just think them because he'll come and sit on our shoulder he'll get all the Devils around us quickly jump on them don't get them to speak those words get them to doubt doubt doubt because if he doubts he won't speak the words and then we'll have power we'll stay brothers and sisters we need to speak the word we need to have boldness right let us therefore come boldly unto the throne not afraid to come unto the throne but boldly unto the throne how do we come unto the throne we speak the word the word says that he's got Watchers right on Earth going to and fro in the earth seeing what's up what are we doing what are we saying bringing the report back remember the story of adoption the tutor is bringing a report to the father we have a father and he knows our name he's taking a report back to the father he's waiting to hear what we're going to say I've said it many times in the past little while but I'll say it again in this context you know how Jesus asked the disciples what's everyone out there saying about us what is he saying what are they saying about me some said you're Elias you're the prophet you know Jeremiah someone along the way but okay that's fine but what do you say who do you say that I am and that's really where it's come down to today brothers and sisters who do we say he is when we sing that song I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them do we understand what that means I think that Revelation is starting to break because when that time comes when that Revelation breaks we're not going to sing that song I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them it's not going to be like that we'll be jumping up and down because we're one of those redeemed people one that he chose from before the foundation of the world where all of heaven will be silent to listen to what it sounds like for redeemed sons of God to sing Hallelujah and you know what every age has a revelation every age has a portion of the word that's given and as we go forwards brothers and sisters I just believe that this Revelation is just unfolding a little further it's just unfolding a little further it's the same word the same Revelation the same message I'm not saying that I've got anything greater I'm saying that I just believe we need to encourage ourselves to just go a little higher to just go a little further to realize our authority to not get slapped around by the devil think about how strong Satan is getting in this day in this age and I think that might be part of it that just wears upon us as as as the Sons and Daughters of God we look at how how how powerful Satan is look at it's his Eden where do we even fit we don't fit we are not citizens of this Kingdom we're the bride that's being taken out of Satan's Eden but you know what as Satan grows in power so does the Bride of Jesus Christ and he's just waiting for us to exercise our Authority he's given us the full open word if we have access to the throne of mercy and Grace then what are we doing we don't need to be afraid we don't need to be afraid of Satan you know the word says Paul said to the Corinthians for we know him pardon we prophesy in part and that happened for years throughout all the ages they knew in part and they prophesied in part right but verse 10 but when that which is perfect is come there was coming a day where there's going to be a Perfection that comes where that Perfection comes then that which is in part will just be set aside because we don't need that part anymore we've got everything we need and it's like the Pentecostals right they want that that that part they want all of the gifts they're not realizing that Perfection has truly come that that the the the speaking in tongues the initial evidence all the gifts who cares about all the gifts they come they'll follow the camel train will follow with all the gifts behind us as we go to The Giver all we need is the giver and we'll have all the gifts but it's Satan's trick to try and keep us down keep us burdened thinking that we need to look for some little tiny piece some little tiny Park but verse 10 says but that when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away because when I was a child I spake as a child when I when I was a message believer I came in and I was a child I had childlike faith and I I thought I understood what the word was I I understood as a child and I thought as a child excuse me I even spake as a child and I understood as a child I think you know many times some of the conversations that I must have had with brother Ken he was he was patient and he would just laugh when I would say things he had a he had a real kind chuckle and he would just laugh when some of the things I would say and I'm sure that he was thinking about this this verse here when I was a child I spake as a child he probably thought that too when he was young we probably have experienced that in our own lives we think back on things and think man I actually thought that way about the word but you know brothers and sisters we're not children anymore we are full adults we're mature adults we're not dealing with skim milk we're not dealing with milk as babes we're dealing with strong meat in our day the fullness of the word being opened the the thing that all of the all of the brothers and sisters from all of the ages desired to look on and and see we just have it it's just common and I think because it's so common and so wide open we have all the technology to get to it it's just so easy it's too easy and we just get too distracted I find I do I can't believe it I have not even entered into notes wow every age has predestinated believers and you know there's just a desire in those Believers to just take in the message is what brother Branham says maybe not exactly like that but just like that out of what is the attraction on the mount every age has Believers and in those Believers there's just a desire for that word and and nothing else will satisfy we can try different things in our lives we can look different ways we can get distracted and and we always find out that that he'll allow us to go so far in whatever we're our thinking is about whatever our our desires are but he always brings us back to the center always and really what the center is is him he's not going to share his glory with anybody he doesn't care about our image he doesn't care about our skills he doesn't care about our money he doesn't care about what we can do humanly everything that we think we know is irrelevant he wants to have preeminence in his body and that's the only thing that he will accept but brothers and sisters when we can come to that place where we just give him all the glory all of the glory of our lives in in our careers any success we have in our career it's because of him right any success we have in our business it's because of him he is our marketing program any success we have financially is because of him any success we have in school is because of him any success we have in a marriage is only because of him any success in child rearing is because of him any success in service is because of him it's just his he has to be our entire Focus entire focus and we have to just push aside all the things in our lives I think we're just coming to a place where it's becoming absolutely urgent we need to understand this call this cry that's going out as the brothers preach this message of the hour in this age it's getting more and more urgent you know the bridegroom has come already and that door is about to close and when that door closes it's too late go search for oil go do what you want we'll knock on the door and say but Lord didn't we cast out devils in your name didn't we have great message meetings I was raised in the message let me in and you know what he'll say you had the opportunity you were shown the word you had a full message app on your phone but you choose to watch videos or you choose to do something else instead of look at that message that you had all of it all of it Lord help us just any day now that door is going to close but thanks be to God there are a certain select group of people that have the desire to just take it all to just take it all it's their absolute there's nothing more important to them than taking in the message of of their day you know the story of Martha and Mary Martha and Mary just a fine example you have two Believers right but one of them is busy with all the things in life all the busy with things in life got to go and do and get and fix and make and bake and do all the stuff and the other one just just has one desire one desire and that's to sit at the Master's feet just tell me more just tell me more just tell me more which one are we you know what Jesus said to to the sister when she was upset because the one wasn't helping you know I'm not going to be with you all the time just relax the things of this life they'll look after themselves I feel like many times we get way too caught up in the moment and by doing that it's just Satan's distraction he just allows us to get so far into that place where we just have to react now we have to move we can't not react and he just laughs but God will give us a way of Escape he always does and and boy when we get that Revelation in our life I've heard a brother speaking about it recently that you know what we'll move our home will sell all that we got we'll throw our business away we'll forget about our careers we'll do everything that we can to make sure that our family comes together and we serve God with all of our might there's nothing in this world that's worth missing out on that Rapture and if we are not careful things will drag us down and we'll be caught up in a situation where we'll miss out on the blessing for our day we don't want to be busy trying to make stuff happen we want to make sure that we're giving him the opportunity but you know in in the situation of Martha and Mary I just want to say this that it doesn't make one more religious than the other don't get me wrong if maybe that was interpreted you know what it is it's revelation it's Revelation that's what it is that's the difference they're both believers it's Revelation and Revelation is given by God it's not imparted by a brother or a pastor or a teacher it comes from God and and how do we get it we get it by prayer we get it by reading the word he reveals himself to whomsoever he will doesn't make any one or the other more religious what it does is it proves election it's God's choice and if we can choose that what it does is it humbles you can imagine that it doesn't make one more proud or boastful because I was sitting at the master oh my you know no not at all it makes one one the other to say my I wish that Revelation would be imparted there as well but it shows a level of revelation really is what that is what that story is doing a level of revelation we can just get so caught up in this world he can give us but we can get so caught up in this world that we just forget a little bit about that revelation we just get a little spiritual Harmony you know he gives us faith it takes Faith to get revelation we have to have faith to pick up our Bible and read we have to have faith that heal in part revelation we have to have faith that it will actually be us we hear about others and all the sisters maybe that are in prayer lines maybe great revivals happening in other people's lives but what about me it has to be a revelation about him for me but you know he'll give us his faith if we really want it because ending we've talked about it where where our faith ends human faith comes to if we actually get into the word and we actually get into the message of the hour which is Christ faith has got to come to an end but when that happens he'll give us a revelation and then he'll give Faith the revelation will be about the word the mystery of God being revealed but a faith that's his faith and then He blesses us with it he doesn't just give us Faith to say you've got great faith you could go and move mountains now Faith you could go in and cast mountains into the sea and and heal people from the dead like we talked about you know no it's not it's not about that it's about having his faith so that he will actually give us Revelation Revelation who we are Revelation about the word revelation that we've got the ability to come before the throne face that we have the ability to speak the word and go forwards that we can understand when creep into our lives creep into our homes get get in amongst our children and with our homes we have the ability to discern that go to God crying because of it he doesn't want us to do that he Punch Out the Devil right out of our house give the devil a black eye send him right now because that's where they belong hell was created for the devil and his angels not our homes not our families but he's going to try and make that that's the case but he gives us his faith and then once we have blesses us with it look at Abraham's life Abraham was given so many Revel given so much Faith great faith he staggered not at the promise of God through but was strong in faith giving God his faith gives us the ability forward his faith not ours his faith his words remember that quote that we read let's go back to it to speak a word and but to confirm a word that's God but how is God ever going to confirm his word if we don't speak it if we speak his word because we're afraid because maybe we look at something and say well so and so the word and they put their neck out there and they got shamed they got embarrassed because it doesn't actually did what they said but you know the word says in James that we ask of Miss if we have the spirit of God in us we won't ask amiss we won't ask consume it upon the lusts of our flesh the desires of this life will greater desire which will be his faith his actual life coming through us see us speaking the word brothers and sisters we say it over and over we're going to keep saying it the mind of Christ to know what to do with it sure the prophet for our day the one who who we don't worship but we follow because he opened the word to us God chose to express himself to us he said she has thus saith the Lord and the mind of Christ to know what to do with it and then she keeps still it's a really simple equation he's not he has it and then she doesn't have it no if she doesn't have it then she just doesn't say anything because she's afraid to speak it but brothers and sisters when we got the word in us that we're right with God we're not on the cycle of iniquity in our lives when we've done everything that we we can speak the word and allow him to confirm it we're not going to ask a miss and that's the thing that I think we just need to have and encouraged in our lives we're not going to ask you're not going to ask a mess if you've got the holy ghost in your life ask a myth and if you don't ask a Miss then it's actually not you speak speaking through you and when he speaks through you what happens [Laughter] you have the power to create a world and go and inhabit it but that would be asking it of your flesh because you don't need to do that but when a devil comes into your house and starts to flip financially or afflicting you physically or afflicting you mentally you have the rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ that Authority is in us as of God full adoption you know that song we we went to adoption full Authority and power not part Authority and power for tea and power when we sing that song do we believe that song we have that in our hearts is it real to us or is it a traditional form of worship just who we have to come to that place brothers and sisters where this is more than just what we more than just what we Fellowship around it's got to be the very essence of our lives around us needs to see this our children need to see god with skin on remember that story brother Bradham tells about that little boy he's sleeping upstairs in a rickety old clapboard house and the storms going through and Mama tells them go upstairs and he says I can't I don't want to I'm scared he comes down time and time again and and don't worry son God is with you we believe we're Christians God is with you and he says mom just need god with skin on right now come upstairs with me we need to be as little the word says He said it to his disciples unless you come as a little child you won't even see God there's no puffed up in this room for us there's no great Revelation the point that that we have pride in our lives that original sin no way no way we've got to be willing to come as little children you've got to be willing to confess our father and pray for one another so that what healed who doesn't want to be healed here he gives us his faith and you know what there's an expression of God's grace throughout every single age and we can look back and see all the people who benefited from that and we can we can look back at the messages and hear the message the prayer lines even the prayer line at the end of what is the attraction just kind of where I'm at right now but you can hear these people who are the ex of God's grace that that that brother Shepard who is in the baptismal in the baptismal during that service so that he could give room for another person to be there and brother Burns this man with his head down and and he needs a touch from God his wife told him another pair of shoes your shoes are worn out he said honey I don't need them I'm not going to live long enough foreign discerns that man an expression of God's grace it's so wonderful to look at that and see that but brothers and sisters it's no different now power is right here right now if two or three are guys in his name then he is there in the midst or he's not right there is or it isn't it's black or it's white it's no gray and and and they want to make it gray they want to say unless unless unless unless and less and less and less and yeah that's the way it'll be unless all these things happen unless you do it the theological way yeah but we've been sent a prophet to show us no traditions and get into Christ you have the ability you have access with boldness to go right to the very Throne of almighty God to become real to us and how is it going to come real to us if we just don't hear about it if we if we just get encouraged about it I just pray that it will become so real to us that we'll just Succeed In Action in our lives not because we're looking for for works because we have authority we don't have to tolerate the devil coming around and trying to torment us because that's what it means Tormentor we need to torment the devil we need to be a nuisance to the devil them to flight the word says to submit yourself therefore unto God then resemble and he will flee we don't flee from the devil he flees from us brothers and sisters what it needs to come to is can we look this grace to us word I found that word seeing this and just it's I just love how the Lord reveals stuff to us word he put that word in my heart so I looked it up in the Bible I'll just read a few scriptures here us word in Psalms 40 many O Lord God are thy wonderful works which thou Hast and thy thoughts which are to us word cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if I would declare of them they are more than can be numbered to uh not someone else in some other age behind us or someone else there in the front of us in ahead of us our our next Generations or whatever should the Lord oh right now it has to be us word in Ephesians 1 that the God Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation knowledge of him that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye make the hope of his calling and the riches of his glory of his inheritance in the Saints takes me right back to a adoption Ephesians paralleling Joshua and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his might usward and the way it comes up in the Bible is us Dash word us word I'm wording it wrong word osward w-a-r us word who believe what is the exceeding of his power to us word to think that one day this will be changed will either go by the way of the grave and we'll get our new theophany body go by the way of the sky and we'll get our new theophany body but one way or the other at our new theophany body nothing can harm us not even death and that needs to be on on our lips we need to be able to speak that when the devil will come knocking on our door and say oh here's a box of cancer here's a box of asthma here's a box of whatever put your label on it coved Whatever It Is we can say no no no no no no what is the exceeding greatness of his power to me word to us word to me I know what his great power is because whether I live or whether I die in this flesh I'm Christ you can't hurt me Satan what you do second Peter second Peter 3 chapter 3 story verse 8 but beloved be not ignorant of this one that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness long-suffering to us word not willing that any but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord it will Thief in the Night in which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that in shall be burned up it's coming a day where it's just going to be a complete reputation all of the sin is just going to vaporize then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness kind of brings it down down home to think about it for being a good Christian in church and then having a vicious conversation on around our dinner table or being a good Christian at home of an a vicious conversation with someone at work there's no room for that seeing that we understand his great power to usward and that all of the elements shall soon melt with a fervent heat and that we've been access to his throne we understand who we are and what we're raised up for we we people how should we be acting then in all whole conversation and godliness out of what is the attraction on the mount brother Branham in one of the president there he says and you're the same yesterday today and forever and you promise perks that I do shall ye do also brothers and sisters as I say and as I as I read this tonight I just want to say this encouragement can sometimes be put on the prophet and it's just what was the problem if it's office and that's what he had and he was the one that was given the ability to have this in his life it was the example if we only have six seals open a lot of room for many different interpretations but if you read the message and you take the message and it's all seven seals are open and I would talk to anyone about that but if they won't see this it will only be uh he was a good man and and there will be another man and maybe that man is Joseph and all these different things these weird things can come up I heard today and I just I never even really believe it I'm so thankful that I've never really there's a guy that's accepting worship as God right now in in a message format in in in in another continent in the world they're calling him Lord I I I myself was just on the floor I thought it was a joke but it's not the guy's actually accepting worship as God it's bizarre but you know it just comes down to this brothers and sisters if you don't get the Holy Ghost in your life that you're open to any doctrine of a devil and I mean any doctrine of a devil it can be some deity spirit it can be a a two two two one I'm not going to get into naming a bunch of different things they don't want to give credit to all these different doctrines of devil I want to give credit to the Holy Ghost I want to give credit where credit is due I want to say that if you don't get the Holy Ghost you're going to be able to be vulnerable to be opened up to whatever the cause is and going to capture your attention and you will be consumed by it if you don't have to post all of the guns of hell are trained upon you if you're going to mix and mingle around for our day if you're going to be around the message of the hour and not go all the way it would be better for you to not have known that's what the word says brother Branham says this and as he says this I just want to make it present tense I want to try to think that he wasn't just talking because he was in his office he wasn't just talking because he was talking and what I mean by his office the prophet's office it's not just for them and that he's speaking take it and make it a present tense I am this is a prayer for us today right now and you're the same yesterday today and forever and you've promised that I do shall ye do also More Than This shall you do because I go to the farm and behold in the last days I'll send to you Elijah prophet and he'll change the thoughts of the people his thoughts of the people is that interesting because the word says he'll change the hearts of the children he says he'll change the thoughts of the people turn parts of the children back to the apostolic teaching of the Bible and it shall be a light about the evening time here we are great God Of Heaven the ear in 1965 where are we at today the hour is still here brothers and sisters that door isn't closed is still here are upon the people I just love how he says this now Satan you're defeated you are a liar and as a servant of God how many Servants of God do we have out there single person who believes the message of the hour every single one you are a servant Satan you're defeated you're a liar and as a servant of and as servants I love how he puts that in there as servants so it's not just him Prophet as a servant of God but as servants we command him of Jesus Christ that you obey the word of God and you go out of the people because it's written and they shall cast out Devils who are they and all the people may be set free the punchline that I got from this all the people may be set free who's let them come right all the people that want to be free will be they come according to the word for their day he says granted dear God you are the god of Heaven that defeated that day with an attraction on the Mount Calvary all sick Jesus and all the devil all the works of the devil you and the people are healed by your stripes they are free of Jesus Christ they are free so who are they don't there and say the people in Branham Tabernacle take it right here and I am they you are they we are they that he was in that prayer it's not just the people there in that meeting I think that we need to do this once in a while hahaha mission that God's given me you know what I think we need to do we need to take ourselves and we need to die out to our we need to just Huck ourselves into the bones of the message of the hour and in second king 13 it says and it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold they spot men and they cast the man into the Sepulcher of Elisha and when the man went down he touched the bones of Elisha he revived and stood up on his feet Brothers we need to come to the place where we're willing to just throw ourselves on the altar of the messenger on the altar of Christ today just die out to ourselves and see if that same same Elijah Elisha John the Baptist and William Miriam Branham anointing manifested you like see if it doesn't act you up to a new level don't take whatever it is we think we know we think we know don't have a tradition don't say that I've already got the message of the app it's it's just fine it's going to take me through make it a daily sacrifice make die out to ourselves and this word becomes a bleeding word to us every day I heard it said that a sacrifice when we go on our knees and we pray place when we come to church and sing a sacrifice when we give our tithe if it is not with then it's actually pointless only has no meaning and how do we get blood willing to die out ourselves good works ain't going to do it for us good works are burned we know that the the I don't know if it's even I don't think it's in the word I know the road to hell is paved with good intentions works is not going to save us we need to make willing to die out to ourselves and just throw ourselves on on that anointing and align to actually come and manifest in our lives because when it does brothers and sisters we'll never ever ever be the same and nobody will ever be able to talk us out of it of people that will say oh did you hear that brother Branham was hunting out a season and and that wasn't even where he said it was and and he said this and he said that and 16 men on the bridge and all these different things all these doctrinal things that creep in and suck you in to make you wonder and doubt and see was was William Miriam Bradham how Blasphemous can people get we don't worship a man but good if you can't believe the man that he did which is exactly what Jesus said to the people we're not saying that he was Jesus he was fulfilling an office he was anointed by it but if we can allow that same anointing to come upon us if if we can't allow that anointing to come up then why did that anointing come brothers and sisters some people will say Office of the prophet he wasn't a wave chief that's a doctrine of a devil say that he wasn't a wave Chief I I pray that we could have a conversation that we could actually try and out the wrinkles because he was the wave chief he was the example of mature Daughters of God the ones who are Mark 16 in action the true church the only church that he claims as his own because all else is false because all is some other life it's a hybrid condition his life is marked attraction his very own life that's the only Mark 16 to happen the only thing we've got to be willing to just throw myself down cast down our imagination our righteousness is brags before him but you know in Romans chapter 8 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you Oh my he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that quickening power I don't know if anybody listened to it's the rising of the sun with eating here if you hear about that quickening power it just does something to Sons and Daughters of Christ from the dead shall also also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if he flesh ye shall die if you're caught up in all of the worldly things because I provide for my family and I still have to make a living and I still have to do all this stuff what we're doing is excuse for it to become an idol in our lives we need to put him first first and make him our marketing program make him all of our and when he is all of our life entirely that's when it changes for us he doesn't want our image he only wants his image he wants us His Image to the world around him and when we do that we're putting him first he'll bless us third we're not debtors not to we are debtors sorry not to the flesh after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die but if through the spirit purify the Deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by this God they are the sons of God present I am if we're led by the spirit of God not by our own thinking by our tradition not by something that came over from um grandparents Traditions that was pulled over into the message of the hour and Blended in with it because it's been with us for all these years it's it's part of the message of the hour is it being able to make sure that it is part of the message of the hour and if it's not part of the message of the hour we just need to put it away we're not bad people they don't want to put anybody in or out or say anybody we just want to make sure that we throw away our traditions and get into Christ because that's what the prophet said that's not what Barry Johnson said I'm just repeating I'm parroting the prophet I don't like that but hey that's the only thing that's going to save us that's the only thing that will but if you mortify if ye through this mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live I just love that they are the sons of God it's it's present tense they of God and you know brothers and sisters they're the brother Branham said that they're free I remember when he called out prayer he told him you're a liar you have no your powers were stripped at Calvary these people in Hebrews chapter one therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection what is perfect there's only one thing that's perfect brothers and sisters weigh your traditions and get into Christ I believe that that says that right there the principles of the doctrine of Christ we learned them when we were children we need to repent and that we need to get baptized and that we need to go on and Holy Ghost but then what when we get the Holy Ghost what does that do it doesn't get a way to live it doesn't give us a box of tools so that we can go into this world and just eat there's there's many religions out there that say that's what that is that'll give us the ability it gives us to actually Prosper because we can name it and then we can claim it and and we just can do that and and that's you know it's just a pendulum it swings both ways what it does though gives us the ability to get into Christ when we leave the doctrines and the principles that we've been taught as a child when I was a child I spake as a child and I thought as a child and I asked but when that which is perfect has come I have the ability to get right into Christ and I don't worry about those little things and what I'm getting at brothers and sisters is that we have full Authority and not just a song that we sing and we need to bring it from being just a song that we sing We need to can actually rebuke Satan in the name of Jesus Christ and he has to flee not just he might flee or or one day maybe he'll flee he has to remember how brother Bradham worded that I'm going to go back to that quote just because it's so good the way he worded it Satan you're defeated I just love those words you're actually going to be cast into a lake of fire and Revelations 10. I know he's listening that's why I'm saying it I'd love to actually do that and and I'm probably going to get steamrolled because of it but you know what what God wants then that's okay it'll be for my character but I'm just recognized that he has no Authority and why should I actually tolerate his antics I think the more that I talk about him being thrown into a lake of fire cast alive to fire well he'll be tormented day and night forever and ever he's hearing that but Satan anyways the prophet defeated and I believe it you're defeated you're a liar and as a God and as servants we command that in the name of Jesus Christ that you obey the god he has to obey the word of God he doesn't have an option we have the ability as human beings to obey the word of God but remember angel he has to follow the word of God one will but he knows it in my name the devils they shall speak with new tongues pick up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm them brothers and sisters we don't have to fear a vaccine I just want to throw that out there worry about a vaccine vaccine isn't going to take us to Hell a vacuum is going to give us the mark of the beast refusing the Holy Ghost today we have the option to get oil that is receiving the mark according to the prophet of Malachi 4. refusing to accept the is accepting the mark of the beast that's the mark of the beat there's come in a day where there will be a physical identification where there'll be something that's given to a person that will identify them and you won't buy or sell what but brother Branham says very clearly what the mark and the hand is in the mark in the forehead is the thoughts and the intents and the other one is the action the movement of the hand if you look into the message you'll see it it's not actually a microchip that's going in us that's going to happen to all the people maybe who are unwise virgin who will tribulation but it's not going to happen to the bride because she accepts the Holy Ghost in his fullness Christ she accepts the fact that Christ actually on Sunset Mountain just like he said he would just like the angel messengers of Galilee why stand you here gazing up into heaven into the cloud where this G he's going to come exactly the same way that you saw him go up into heaven that doorway open in heaven he's going to come exactly the same way so just go preach the God go back into Jerusalem and follow his instructions and get the Holy Ghost that's all we need is just to get the Holy Ghost and it sounds sounds Maybe I don't even know what the right word would be maybe it sounds a little bit hokey just get the Holy Ghost but it's the truth it really is the truth the only way today is to get the Holy Ghost if we think about the pressures of this life congratulations last night and this whole thing about children now in schools being able to be taught without parents permission that it's okay for them to change it just really magnifies the point how all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of and we can see it brothers and sisters if you look at it being just imposed so that way that if you talk against it it's hate speech it's now let's just hate speech but look at it how important it is for Satan's to try and actually manipulate people to change their bodies it's because change is so close get oil be caught without it we have to just get into Christ and that's our Perfection and what is that Perfection What is for today just to break it down as we close maybe I'll even call what is Christ today Brothers and Sisters Jesus Christ the same yesterday it's the message of the hour what was Christ in Noah's day what was Christ in Paul's day what was Christ in in all of the different ages throughout the ages it was the messenger they brought was Christ for that day Christ today it's the message of this age and what is the message of this age sisters just to bring it right down home it's shapes even though some might say it is and and two is but it ain't books and tapes and it's not a message app it's not a hero tablet it's not a belt buckle I think tangible that we can see what it is the message today is Christ in you hope of glory and how does that happen by the Holy Ghost by accepting the day we get the opportunity to realize how we need to receive the Holy Ghost for our day when we close for our day we've got the oil and that's all we need seek ye first God and all these things all the rest of it will be added unto you when you need to speak forwards when you see the devil come in and try and torment you or your wife or your life stomp on the devil our heel isn't going to be bruised by his head we know that Christ heal already was bruised for our sake and he crushed Satan he killed him took away all his powers he's got no power and he's doomed and he knows it and the only thing that he has going forward is the distraction of the Bride As long as he can keep her distracted from actualizing what she is he's got a little space of time just a teeny little space But as soon as we realize it as soon as we come to that standing that we don't have to tolerate all this stuff that we tolerate on a regular basis just the way this world is around us the tangibility of this life we come in born in sin come into this world speaking lies but there comes a point in time where we no longer speak as a child thinking talk as a child or act as a child we we come to full maturity and we know that time comes that which is in part shall be done away with because that perfect comes into our hearts and when that which is perfect has come we can just all the things that we thought we we needed to worry about we don't need to worry about fussing about all these little details in life what we need to do is just get into Christ just keep him first promote him to of our lives and when he's there he'll look after everything else and he won't come do it but he might give people in our lives he might bring people into our lives right at the time we need it with the exact encouragement that we need and maybe we need to learn about how to do something maybe we need to learn just a carnal example how to finances invest or how to deal with our taxes if we bring that to him as a child of God do you think he won't give us a solution to think that he won't give us a solution if we ask him many times Satan will just get us so caught up in it we'll just get carnal and we'll go to Google [Music] instead of actually going to God just a simple carnal example but works in every single area of our lives either it works or it doesn't brothers and sisters it either works or it doesn't there's no point pretending and saying that well that's good for some and not good for others it's good for everything if we're believers either it ain't sorry for being maybe hard forgive me but it's true the message for today is the hope of glory it doesn't do any good to just simply read or talk about it we've got to be willing to speak the word and go forwards someone has to get the word today and I say let it be us [Music] don't want to just sing about it and talk about it brothers and sisters maybe for years maybe it's felt that way for years and and maybe there's just a time where we just move from being children to being adults to being the the fully established Daughters of God where we recognize that which is perfect is come already it's right here waiting for me to say be it unto me according to Thy word according to thy and what is that that's the message of the hour be unto me according to thy will according to Thy Word experience it for yourself you know I was having a calm the brother today maybe stand with me as we close it's having a conversation today with the brother was pouring his heart out to me and just it was so encouraging to hear him have a rule of the Holy Ghost in his life and he said you know I've tried my whole entire life happened and I've been up and I've been down and I'm just not into it anymore it's not the right way I don't have to try and Chase it I don't have to damage I don't have to have something great to show the world around me I don't have to measure everything all I need is the holy ghost in my life and I wanted to say to him you've got it brother I can tell you you've got it because you've got that desire in you willing to just throw it all away it doesn't matter I've got my family word I don't need anything else if we can come to that place I think God really just wants to bless us he wants to see us speak the word he's not gonna word he's already spoken the word through a prophet he's already done it he's already given us an open book with our name written inside and without all we need to do is recognize that brothers and sisters God bless you tonight let's just go gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word for the progressive revelation in our lives Lord thank you Father Lord we can look back in our lives and think that there's times where maybe damn things and in in in due course you allow that Revelation to break for us and and and to take us and and train us as children the ability to understand things later on that maybe we didn't understand before father we just want to have that measure of Grace for those people around maybe once upon a time someone had a strange Doctrine or strenation in their lives and it caused us to just be a little bit skewed in our father forgive us because we know that they have the opportunity also for progressive revelation in their lives and so as as as humans as we grow as as Sons and Daughters we have the opportunity to grow and learn and all of us evolve and change and Lord there's only one thing that we change into that's your image Lord I pray tonight that you would just take the words that were spoken Lord Jesus and bless them to the spiritual nourishment of every one of us father myself and I pray Lord Jesus that I wouldn't just be talking I don't want a talker of the word Lord I want to be a doer and I that if there's anything in my life that that is unpleasing to you that you would just forgive me for it take it from me that you would show me Lord Jesus that I could make it better myself I don't want to be in a position where I mislead anyone father I want to make your preaching your word in season because that's the only thing that will change our body we pray father that you would just bless each one that you would watch over the homes father if we go into this next phase of of weirdness with the covet Lord it seems important and so confusing but we know that you are not the author of it and we pray give us peace of mind and resolution in our hearts Lord Jesus to just stay together to bind ourselves that much closer together as we go forwards say that Lord whatever your will is that we would just be sensitive to yours we would see your will being done in our lives that Lord just like Mary when she said me according to Thy word father that that word would just take root and begin to life would just come to fruition and that we would see that life manifest in our life so much Lord that our bodies just
