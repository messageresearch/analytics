Brother Ernie is a brother to Mike Fzen who was part of the believer group. So, back in our home province of Saskatchewan. God bless you, my brother. Amen. Let us bow, saints. Our precious heavenly father, we're so blessed, Lord, to be able to call you our father. &gt;&gt; Lord, by your grace are we saved, Lord. We thank you for that precious blood that was shed on Calvary. &gt;&gt; To atone for our weaknesses that we might have. Lord, &gt;&gt; you know our weaknesses. You know our needs. You know every heart, Lord, that has a need, Lord. And &gt;&gt; you're the allsufficient God. &gt;&gt; Creator of heaven and earth. You bow down. We bow down to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And the very earth that we just sang that you created, &gt;&gt; you so graciously came that you could redeem us unto thyself, Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not worthy of it, Lord. But &gt;&gt; you're the worthy one, and you created us in before the foundation of the earth, Lord. You already had us in your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're looking for your appearing once again, Lord. &gt;&gt; You said that happy are they that look for that appearing. And Lord, our hearts are crying within us, oh God, for that great and notable day &gt;&gt; when we shall all gather with all the saints that have gone on before. &gt;&gt; Thinking of our precious brother Ken that stood behind this desk. &gt;&gt; Lord, I remember him so clearly. Lord, &gt;&gt; my heart goes out, Lord. I thank you, Lord, for these memories, Lord, that you give us in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. They burn within us, oh God, because of that life that was lived here on earth, &gt;&gt; that was worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that worthy gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray now, Lord, that you would meet every need here this morning and bless our brother as he stands behind this desk leading us in song. And Lord, all the musicians. And I pray that you'd bless the speaker that would come. Lord, that's what we're looking forward to is that word that would come forth and speak to our hearts and meet every need in our heart. Lord, that's our desire. Lord, I thank you once again for this gathering for all the people that have come together to worship you in spirit and in truth in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And I give you all the glory and praise in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, my brother. Good to be in the presence of the Lord Jesus this morning. Maybe shake someone's hand as you're seated this morning. Wish God's richest blessing. [Music] God's great bouquet this morning. There many representation.

Wonderful to be around all the saints of God this morning. As our brother prayed, isn't it going to be wonderful to meet all you again? Never have to part. It's a wonderful, wonderful promise.

Father, each one coming from far and near, bringing their praises, bringing their sacrifices to your house. Father, we want to thank you once again for bringing Brother Danny all the way from Philippines with something upon his heart to come and speak to us. Father, we want to thank you for bringing brothers and sisters, Father, this morning. This assembly is full of them. They drove, they flew, Father, to come here to hear from you, not from Brother Danny. Lord, this morning, one thing that we want to do is to worship you. One thing that we want to do this morning is to praise you. We don't want to think about what you haven't done, but what you have done this morning. So this morning, we are full of praise and sacrifices to you. &gt;&gt; Father, this morning, this church is full because of you. Not any man. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Father, we continue to pray. If there's someone among us this morning that is feeling down, would you reach down and touch that someone? &gt;&gt; Father, we never meet without a need. &gt;&gt; As much as we never meet without a praise report, Father, may you receive every praise report in our hearts. Even if it is unspoken, you have done something for us. This morning we were able to shower and drove to your house. It is by your grace that we are here this morning. And as your word is about to come, may you prepare a place in our hearts to receive it. Lord, may we not look at one another but to look up to you this morning. &gt;&gt; Once again, we are bringing our tithes and offering. We ask you to receive it. Bless it in Jesus name that we pray. Amen. [Music] Gentle, gentle shepherd, gentle shepher, oh come and lead us, oh for we need you to help us find our way. Yes, Lord. Oh, gentle shepher, [Applause] won't you come and feed us?

Who can help us face another day? [Music] Oh gentle shepher, oh come and lead us. Oh, for we need you to help us find our way. Just for the local folk, most of us know this, but this is the last service. I believe Brother Justice, Sister Sharon will be here. Is that right? So, they're heading back, moving back to Africa. We're very disappointed that we'll be obviously missing you, but we know the Lord has his hand upon you and has guided you that way.

[Music] Oh, I [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; am to sing your praises.

Maybe one more hand clap for all those Blessed be the name of the Lord. Sisters and brothers. &gt;&gt; Thank you. What a wonderful contribution to the service. Stand with me if you would as we change the order this morning. We call our pastor. Word of God. One of my favorite favorite songs this week. I was just telling my wife just listening to the prophet through multiple services, but there's something that I don't know if it was just I imagine it was the Lord dealing with me specifically, but the Brandon would always refer back to the word. He would say something and I say, "Okay, that's interesting." And then he would say, "And there's a scripture in the Old Testament." He would just go back to the word, back to the word. And I just just what just was impressed on me this this week was this is a vindicated prophet. We all know that. But he had to be founded on the word. That's the only thing he could found himself on. &gt;&gt; And here we are this morning. What else are we going to found ourselves on but the word? Brother Danny brought it so well last night. The word is the only thing that is our absolute. &gt;&gt; Our prophet taught us that. He was a word prophet. Here we are standing on that word this morning. Holy word long preserved. All the martyrs through the ages, all our brothers and sisters that paid and paved the way for us. Even some of the ones brother brother Ernie prayed and brother Ken and others my dad was in brother Bram's meetings but all those brothers paved the way. So here we are this morning we have a glorious gospel that's been delivered to us. Blessed be his name this morning. Sing it with me as our pastor comes. Holy word, long preserved for our walk in this world. They resound with God's own heart. Oh, let the ancient words impart. Oh word of God, ever true. It's changing me and it's changing you. We have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God impart. Holy words of our faith. They've been handed down to this age. They came to us through sacrifice. Oh, he the faithful words of Christ. It's changing changing. We have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God. Amen. God bless you today. Welcome everyone to the house of the Lord. It truly is an honor and a privilege to gather together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To worship the King of Kings &gt;&gt; and Lord of Lords. This morning we have a few prayer requests that we would like to bring before the Lord. But you know, just before we do that, we would like to just take a moment and appreciate Brother Justice, Sister Sharon Rose, and the children. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As they depart. Are the girls here today? All right. Right in front of me. God bless you. I usually uh don't look down because I don't want to stare at anybody too hard in the front row. But God bless you sisters. Um it certainly is with heavy hearts that we have to say farewell, not goodbye. We certainly know that the Lord has his hand upon the life. he has when they brought them here from brother Mike Wall's assembly in Washington DC and many years ago. Certainly thankful for the opportunity that I've had to fellowship with brother Justice. He's really made an impact in my life when we started our business in 2013. there was a little downturn in the economy and brother Justice just came to work with me and I felt so humbled that he would just want to spend time with me and we did some pretty interesting things with uh with appliances. But you know this morning I just would like to invite the Elatche family to the front of the assembly here because this is the last time they're going to fellowship with us this way. and I would just like to have a word of prayer with them as we wish them well. [Music] If you don't mind, just enter into prayer with me. If anybody here desires to come to the front, by all means, you're certainly welcome to do that. I know we're packed here today, but we're seeing a part of our family leave, and uh we just want to wish the richest blessing of God upon them. going to come right down here and join you. Certainly hate to see you all go, but we know the Lord's leading you and we're thankful for his leadership in your lives. Yeah. Come on. Don't be bashful if you want to gather around. This might be our last time. You know, Brother Brandham says it. Don't wait. Don't wait to put a rose on a coffin. Give a bouquet while you can. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I remember brother Tim Mashong. I love what he said. I'm going to repeat it. I told him I'm going to copy it, too. He said, "Don't give me a tribute when I die. I don't want no tribute when I'm dead. If you're going to give me a tribute, do it when I'm alive so I can appreciate it." &gt;&gt; And you know, the only regret that I have is that we haven't done more for the Elatche family in their departing. But as a pastor, I want to do the best thing I can do that I know how to do. And it's not just to pray right now. It's to continue to pray for the Elaji family. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just like we have prayed for them. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Gracious heavenly father, we love you today. Lord, &gt;&gt; we're just so thankful for this family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Justice and Sister Sharon Rose. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Sister Victoria, Lord, Sister Jewel, Sister Joanne, &gt;&gt; Lord, Sister Bethl, and Brother Isaiah. Father, we love the Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to unite around together with them, Father, around your word. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, we just pray that you would keep your hand upon them, Father. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every step of their life, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We know that this is the part of the curse that we hate, Lord. That we have to say goodbye sometimes here on this side, but we know it's only temporal. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we will spend eternity together &gt;&gt; because of your word, Lord. And this morning, Father, as an assembly, as a family, Lord, we just unite together around the Elatches. And we just pray, Father, that you would just continue to watch over them. Bless their way, Father. &gt;&gt; Help Brother Justice as the head of the home, Lord, as the father and the husband, and help Sister Sharon Rose as the wife and the mother, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, bless the children. We pray that you would just help them, Lord Jesus, to follow stay in your word, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; all the days of their life. keep sickness from their home. Lord, just continue to &gt;&gt; allow them to be in that cycle of blessing. Father, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we love you and we thank you for them. Thank you for the Elijah family, Lord. We just ask that you would keep your hand upon them. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everywhere they go, Lord. That they would be a living witness of your life to the world around them. That they would take the blessing that they have given to Calgary Living Word and Father, offer it to the assembly where they're going now, Lord. Father, we love you and we thank you. We just want to ask that you would bless them abundantly, Father, above all they could ask or think about. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Sharon. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Justice, bless you, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you sister. God bless you sister. &gt;&gt; God bless you sister. Bless you my buddy. Let's just sing that chorus again. Word of God ever changing me, changing you. Here I come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God. [Music] Amen. just have a couple of prayer requests this morning. One of them is from Sister Amber. It's for her son-in-law's sister, Aaliyah. She has been in the hospital with a broken leg and a complicated health history, and she needs a touch from the Lord. We also have a prayer request for brother Joshua's mother-in-law. I believe sister Emily Monk Mona Ken Ziki. She is uh travel looking for traveling mercy. She's going back to Congo on September the 6th. So we want to thank the Lord for brother Joe's mother-in-law and traveling mercies for her and Aaliyah, if you have a request this morning, maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand. &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for your goodness and your tender mercies to each and every one of us, Lord, thank you for the specials this morning, Lord, because we know they're an expression of your life in the hearts of your children, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, to recognize that it all &gt;&gt; is only about your grace. Father, when we can catch that revelation, it changes us. &gt;&gt; As we heard last night, we recognize that it's only humility that reigns in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's nothing that we ever did to achieve your grace. Father, it's because you chose us in you before the foundation of the world to be recipients of your grace. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, it doesn't give us occasion to make grace a disgrace. That's not your spirit, Father. Your spirit is according to your word. And father, this morning, we just want to thank you for the atmosphere here. Thank you for each life represented, for each one who's made the effort to come and worship you today, today, Lord Jesus. Father, we just want to give you praise, Father, for touching Brother Juma and his wife, Lord, and opening the doors of immigration, Father. Lord, we know that you're more than able.

So, uh, in numbers chapter 27 in verse one, we read here, then came the daughters of Zilofiad, the son of Heer, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasse, of the families of Manasse, the son of Joseph. And these are the names of his daughters, Mala, Noah, and Hogla, and Mila, and Tiraza. And they stood before Moses and before Elizar the priest and before the princes and all the congregation by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation saying, "Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora, but died in his own sin and had no sons. Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family? Because he had no son. Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father. And Moses brought their cause before the Lord. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, The daughters of Zilopiad speak right. Thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren, and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. And if he have no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. And if he have no brethren, then you shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it, and it shall be unto the children of Israel, a statute of judgment, &gt;&gt; as the Lord commanded Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word. Let's just bow our heads in prayer. Dear heavenly father, we approach your throne of mercy this morning. &gt;&gt; We love you. But Lord, you first love us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we have come here through your word. Amen. You have gathered us, Lord, through this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And so God, please take full control once again. And &gt;&gt; have your own way. Spook to your speak to your people this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord God, we just certainly uh Lord, we have nothing to say, but we just want to speak what you want us to speak, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Lord, we just come out, come out here, Lord, with our open hearts, with our open ears, our eyes of understanding, Lord God. Amen. And may you have your own liberty in Jesus Christ's name. We thank you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's give clap offering to the Lord this morning. Amen. So, God bless you. You may now be seated. Hallelujah. Amen. So, uh it's a wonderful day. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's a sunny day, but it's a so s uh day as well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, uh thank you for another opportunity. Amen. My heart is so full. Amen.

And just to shake your hand, Amen. is uh something that really encourages me so much. Amen. So uh this is from the Old Testament and I would like to speak about the bride's inheritance this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride's inheritance. So we have come to the day that you know it's it's claiming time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's claiming time. It's standing to our ground, standing our position. And uh uh uh the Bible said every every inch every portion that we step into. Amen. Uh uh you know it's it's it's good to know uh uh what we are it it good it is also good what belongs to us. Amen. But it's always the best to enjoy what really belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. because that gives us uh a a a reality a a genuity of of God's promise. Amen. Uh being within our reach. Hallelujah. So may the Lord help us this morning. And uh uh you know as I say I am a uh message of the hour preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It just take one hour. Message of the hour not hours. Amen. So now the the uh focal point the the main characters the main characters in this portion of the scripture. Amen. Uh the five daughters of Zilopiad. Five daughters. Amen. And these five daughters they have come to a point uh that if we're going to study and look at it, Amen. They have come to a point to to claim something that have not been claimed before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh it uh it has come it just come to their knowledge to their uh understanding. For us it's a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's a revelation is something that is personally revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's personal. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that personal revelation is something that the devil cannot cannot be taken. It cannot be taken out of you. Even the strongest devil cannot pull that revelation away from you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes people may not be able to understand. Sometimes people will, you know, look at us, oh, you're crazy. You're you're an oddball. Amen. You're so different. You're claiming something. Amen. You know it it's it's out of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now my point this morning is Amen. My point this morning these five daughters of Zilopiad Amen they uh uh they presented a claim to prophet Moses in their time that have not happened before. &gt;&gt; So let's study. Amen. here uh in verse two he said in verse two let's see uh they stood before Moses and before Elisar the priest and before the princes and all the congregation of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation saying our father died in the wilderness and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora but died in his own sin and had no sons and then In verse four, why should the name of our father be done away from among his family because he hath no son? Give unto us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give unto us therefore a possession &gt;&gt; among the brethren of our father. No record. &gt;&gt; Amen. no reference whatsoever that a woman claim an inheritance that belongs to his father to their father. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the first time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now before we go uh further on. Amen. So we see let's go back in verse one. Then came the daughters of Cilopia, the son of Epher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manassef, the families of Manasse, the son of Joseph. And these are the names of his daughters, Mala, Noah, Hogla, and Mila, and Tarsa. You know, uh, nothing happens by accident in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing happens by accident. Everything everything is pre-planned by the Lord. Everything being, you know, God being absolute God. Amen. uh uh uh knowing. Amen. Because if if God never knew what is from the beginning up to the end, he's not God. &gt;&gt; Amen. In fact, Amen. God is even beyond the beginning &gt;&gt; and the end because he is eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not only a A and Z. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he is a between A up to Z. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And beyond that, he is the eternal &gt;&gt; God. He's eternal. Amen. He just he just stepped into time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is his own prerogative. That is his own uh h uh uh desire &gt;&gt; for a certain purpose. Amen. To bring us back where we come from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. And so now you see in the Bible seldom names of women are being mentioned. &gt;&gt; That's right. Unless they uh uh they present uh uh something that is so special, something that is so prominent. Amen. So that's why in the book of in the whole scripture, we only have uh two books, Ruth and Esther. Amen. And this book of Ruth and Esther, both of them speaks about the great love stories. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we also uh uh make mention of of of Rahab. Amen. uh uh and also Rahab had uh uh had occupied or uh had uh accomplished something that no other women have accomplished during her time. Rahab, Amen. And uh we we read of Mary also and Mara. So Sarah, so they they they uh uh they fulfill some kind of a role. Amen. that would be monumental in the days to come. &gt;&gt; And now we can we can go back and see all these all these women uh uh uh expressing amen uh or or making manifest the uh uh the characteristics of the bride in the day and age that we are living in. Amen. So now these five daughters of Zilopiad, Mala, Noah, Hogla, Mila and Thza. Amen. uh even their names uh you know the name the name Mala if we look the the closest meaning to the uh uh to Mala Amen is forgiven. Mala means forgiven. And remember uh uh the five daughters of Cilope had mentioned that our father died in the wilderness because of his own sin. Amen. But there is a catching statement. There's a catching statement that the daughters of Zilopia had mentioned though he died. Amen. He said he was not Amen. in the company Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was not in the company of those &gt;&gt; that rebel against Moses. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So he died. He made probably something wrong. But one special thing that these five daughters of Zilopiad remember so clearly that their father did not join the rebellion against Moses. &gt;&gt; I love that. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. What a kind of attitude, what a kind of characteristic we fathers, we parents can show to our children. Amen. That we have not been rebellious of the word of God. We have not been rebellious of the prophet. We have not been rebellious to our pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is something. And in due time, hallelujah, our children will benefit from it. &gt;&gt; Oh God, what an example these five children of Cilopia. But now, amen. Though he died in his own sin, now you will notice that that that uh uh the pur's daughter named uh named Mala. Amen. Which means forgiven. Hallelujah. So it must be the Holy Spirit that inspired him. Amen. To name his first daughter forgiven. Mala. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But aren't you glad this morning you're not just forgiven? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride is not just forgiven. The bride is being justified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're, you know, we we everything that we have done before. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have been thrown in God's sea of forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we cannot even forget ourselves. Amen. We cannot even forgive ourselves. Hallelujah. But when we ask God, Amen. When God look red, our sin red that is our sins that are red. Amen. If he looks through his blood that is red, it becomes white. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God will say, I don't remember any &gt;&gt; I cannot find record &gt;&gt; against you because we are justified. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now uh his second child and even the sequence, even the order of birth, Amen. Mala, of course, Noah, this is not Noah during the flood. He's a woman. And Noah, Amen. The name Noah, Amen. It means a a campaign or a in other words a revival. &gt;&gt; Nice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Noah means a movement. Amen. A great move &gt;&gt; and some kind of you know last time we talked about a an attraction. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what have you first felt when you realize you're not just forgiven? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're justified. Amen. &gt;&gt; As if you have not done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that Satan can charge against you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is an in internal revival that have happened in our hearts that made us rejoice and and and and move. Amen. According to what we believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So a in Noah and that that means a revival is something that that's a great move, a great movement, a campaign. Amen. and and and and Mila the third daughter. Amen. It means queen. &gt;&gt; The queen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And who's sitting beside the king? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The queen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is therefore now condemnation and no condemnation to them that are in Christ. &gt;&gt; No more condemnation. Justified. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we are being revived. And then we move. Amen. And now we know where we are going. We know that when judgment comes, we will not be standing before the throne. Amen. Chilling and being afraid. Amen. Uh what judgment will fall on us? What's going to be the verdict against us? Amen. We are so confident. This message has given us so much confidence. Amen. That we will not be uh standing before judgment because there is therefore now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. Now if you know who you are, &gt;&gt; if you know what you believe, &gt;&gt; if you know what we are standing for, there is therefore it's already a con conclusion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just laying out the premise of something. It's already a conclusion. &gt;&gt; Therefore is a finality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is therefore &gt;&gt; is a conclusion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is no doubt. Amen. And when the Supreme Court says therefore after after studying all the premises, all the uh all the evidences, Amen. before making giving the verdict, Amen. Amen. The the the the jury or the uh uh uh uh the judge will say, "Therefore, &gt;&gt; amen. There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're so sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we're in Christ, if we have entered into that, that's why uh uh this message has also given us stages of grace. How we will be able to enter into that &gt;&gt; realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're justified, &gt;&gt; sanctified, baptized with the Holy Spirit. We enter into that. Amen. Not only in the in the in in in in in the first uh stage. Amen. We don't stop in the uh in the altar right there. &gt;&gt; We enter into the holy place. &gt;&gt; And we don't stop in the holy place. We enter into the most holy place. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And in there, brother said, you are totally separated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan cannot even see you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not even affected but by what's going on outside. It's already an individual affair with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are the queen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know what the queen is? &gt;&gt; Esther. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, &gt;&gt; Amen. Declare. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm able. I'm the king. King Aspiritu said, "I am the king and I'm able to give you even half of the kingdom." &gt;&gt; Half. &gt;&gt; Now, half here is not 50/50. &gt;&gt; Amen. But half is not a literal half. If there's 100, you take 50 and I have 50. No. But but you have equal. Amen. I have I I am giving you half of my kingdom. &gt;&gt; That means it is a an equal sharing &gt;&gt; of the power. &gt;&gt; Now listen, &gt;&gt; it's not there's no there is no &gt;&gt; boundary &gt;&gt; boundary. &gt;&gt; Brothers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The queen. Hallelujah. Whatever I have, you have. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know there is not there is no agreement that when you enter into a marriage Amen here in in in the earth in the natural principles you can do that but it's not in the mind of God. It's not God's thinking. Amen. When you say you are the queen Esther say what you want. Even judgment have been bestowed upon the queen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why brothers and sisters, Amen. this message that you know uh the prophet had done everything for the bride to realize what she possessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that's why Amen. And so the being the queen Amen. And then you go on the port name Tza which means pleasing an apple of the eye. &gt;&gt; Favorite. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. And you know when you say a favorite when you have a favorite son or favorite daughter. Uh, don't get me wrong, but I'm just trying to to say something &gt;&gt; because we are God's apple of the eye, right? &gt;&gt; Now, you know, when when when it's your apple of the eye, you know, you don't see any fault. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your wife, husbands, your wife is your apple of the eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. When she cooked an egg, it doesn't matter whe it doesn't matter whether it's soft, hard, light, or overcooked. When she presents it, the best &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you don't see any fault. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't want her to be disappointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever she does, it's the best. &gt;&gt; It's your favorite. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Because that you are, the bride is is God's apple of the eye. That's the same thing. Amen. That's the same thing with our children. Amen. So that's why, you know, go back to the Garden of Eden. Hallelujah. They made a mistake. They they transgressed God. Amen. But Adam was the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the woman was part of the man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So even if they committed fault, they were they remained God's apple of the eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Israel is God's apple of the eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why God has always a plan for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the benefit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And aren't you glad this morning we have a father? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And we are his favorite. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we fail, he doesn't see our failure. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; God sees our need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he always has a remedy for whatever we do. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Sarah spoke against God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sarah insulted God. Me? I'm old. Shall I have pleasure with my Lord? Amen. But God was looking to Abraham, &gt;&gt; his apple of the eye. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he knew if God will kill Sarah, he will hurt &gt;&gt; Abraham &gt;&gt; because Sarah was Abraham's apple of the eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the power of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what happened to Mrs. Lot? &gt;&gt; She just looked back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I'm sorry. Amen. So he's apple of the eye. Hogla means and then you go h and the last daughter the youngest which means hogla and that means worshipper because hogla means circling dancing you know worshiing. So hogla was a worshipper. So all these five daughters of Zilope had &gt;&gt; with their characteristics. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With each one having attributes today, Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. In in in the book of Matthew being referred to as the five wise virgins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all these characteristics are being contained by the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know who we are, what we are standing for. We know &gt;&gt; the bride knows what she is. &gt;&gt; And she knows what's to be done with the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so uh uh that's why so the five daughters of the Zilopiad all these attributes all these characteristics are being being h absorbed or being made manifest the but the bride in the last days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know I'm justified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know I'm a part of the great revival and not not just the physical Pentecostal revival or something but there is something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

Don't even blame Satan. &gt;&gt; Sometime you say, "Oh, Satan is &gt;&gt; challenging me again. &gt;&gt; Satan is giving me so much problem, all this sickness, all these challenges. Don't blame Satan and the devils. They're just doing their job. What we have to do? We have to do our job. &gt;&gt; We have to claim our position. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank the devil. Thank you for doing your job. You are perfecting me. I'm just you're you're the job the problem that you're giving me. You're just pushing me to the full adoption of son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So all these things and that's why we have reason to worship. We have reason to rejoice. We have reason to go. Amen. And live and forget everything. Hallelujah. And and and the only thing that we have hallelujah is the confidence the the the comfort that we are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look. So see now in in in in verse two again, and they stood before Moses and before Eliza the priest and before the princes and all the congregation by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation saying, "Amen." So they presented their claim. Amen. Now, one good thing these five daughters of Zilope had, that's why I know they are taught well by their father, &gt;&gt; is that when they have a problem, they know where to go to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They know who to approach. &gt;&gt; They went to Moses. They went to the tabernacle. They went to the priest. They did not look for another church. &gt;&gt; They did not consult another minister. &gt;&gt; Amen. They respect their pastor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so now, Amen. And and and and so look at how Moses responded because Moses was a vindicated prophet of God. And if we put it in a little way, mass Moses was the pastor. Amen. So they approached their pastor. Amen. They went to the church. They want to settle the matter, settle the issue, present their claim. And that's the right thing to do. That's why brother Brandham said, "Our first obligation is to look for a home church." Amen. And he said, "When you have a home church, you have a pastor, give your full respect to the pastor because he can set you through." Amen. Hallelujah. So they present and look at Moses because they respectfully presented their claim. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Moses did not jump into conclusion &gt;&gt; saying, "Wait a minute, you women, you keep silent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not allowed to speak." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We already have a system. We already have a pattern. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this has been done long, long time ago. Amen. that the the the the possession of the father will be given to his son only male children receive the inheritance of their father. But Moses said well first time it come to my attention. Hallelujah. But you know because they approach right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They had the right attitude in presenting their claim. &gt;&gt; You know sometimes we have the right sometimes we we are in the the the the right position but because the way we present and the way we you know just like uh uh uh uh uh the people amen years ago they approached the Lord tell us and we will believe you. Amen. They had the wrong approach. So they did not receive the favor that we they were asking. &gt;&gt; Amen. But now now the children of God, Amen. They they are being taught, we are being taught how to approach the gift. And so they approach the gift. Amen. And Moses said in verse five, "Wait a minute." Amen. Let's pray about it. Amen. give me give me time. I'm going to consult God. So in verse five, and Moses brought their cost before the Lord. He never went to another bishop, &gt;&gt; Cardinal, &gt;&gt; or an elder. &gt;&gt; He approached God. Moses brought their cost before the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And you know, he never mentioned to anyone in the church, don't be like these women. &gt;&gt; They're claiming something that does not belong to them. Amen. They have no record. They we have no pattern. Amen. To uh uh uh to to have uh their claim uh uh be implemented at this time. We have no record. But Moses said he brought their cause before the Lord. Amen. And that is always the right thing to do. We ministers, we present everything to the Lord because there's no one higher than God. In the church, the the brother Bam said the authority is the pastor. Amen. And who's higher than than a pastor? Amen. Only God. We're just under shepherds of the chief shepherd and that's the Lord. Hallelujah. And that is where we that is where we approach. Amen. We present our cause, our claim and everything. And you know if we present something to God, he is able to respond. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. God has ear to hear. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now because of that look what have happened when Moses brought their cost to the Lord in verse three. Amen. or in in in uh in the next verse let's see we can see that something have happened amen to their presentation and God did something amen so when God gives uh uh uh when we present things to the Lord Amen he gives us an answer &gt;&gt; amen So let's let's read in verse 7. Let's see in verse 7 here. He said, "Now Moses brought their cause before the Lord. And the Lord spake unto Moses." I like this. And the Lord spake to Moses. And what did God say? The daughters of Silofiad speak right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren, and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. Right. &gt;&gt; The power of saying the right thing. &gt;&gt; The power of approaching the right person. &gt;&gt; The power of going to the right place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God said Moses. And here is the instruction to Moses. Moses. Amen. The Lord spake unto Moses saying, "The daughters of Cilopia speak right. Thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren, and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It never happened before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It never happened before. No basis, no reference, no record on file. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God is absolute. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. God is absolute. So God is saying something here. Amen. So because they spoke the right thing, give them the inheritance that belong to their father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it didn't stop there. Verse nine. And if he has no daughter, Amen. Then ye shall give his uh uh uh oh no in verse eight. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. Listen, look at the blessing. Because of the five daughters of Zilopiad, Amen. that did the right thing, said the right thing, went to the right place, approached the right person. Amen. They were highly favored by the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the favor of the Lord did not stop them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in verse eight, and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, from now on, &gt;&gt; Amen. from now on, if a man die and have no son, &gt;&gt; then you shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride is a game changer. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Something new. Amen. And the blessing did not stop to their father. The blessing went to the children, to the daughters, and because of their attributes, their characteristics, know not knowing what belongs to them. Amen. So now the favor went on through the next generations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. from now on and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying if a man die and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. Nine. And if he have no daughter, Amen. So it's spread out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he have no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. And if he have no brethren, you shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. And if his brother have no brethren, then he shall give his inheritance unto the his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it, and it shall be unto the children of Israel, a statute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It became a law &gt;&gt; that from that day on, it will continue on and on and on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just just just just look at this. Just because of these five women that were taught correctly by their father, they have he they have seen. Amen. How their father stayed true to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Although, you know, he had some uh uh uh uh uh uh because they said our father died in the wilderness. Amen. That's the only basis they had. In verse three, our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They did not revel against the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, dying in his own sin can only mean, you know, he might have died in sickness or something. You know, he had his own fault. Brother Brenham had his own port. &gt;&gt; Brother Danny had, you know, I had my own. Hallelujah. Amen. But you see the only basis the only basis that these five daughters held in their hands in their hearts was that by knowing by witnessing the life of their father being so loyal to God by respecting the prophet. And if there is something that we can pass on to our children, that is how we respect the father of faith in this generation because he's the patriarch. Brother Benham said on the other side uh uh uh uh Paul and you know like the the patriarchs they will be and and and Paul will present his you know his aids all the rest of the messengers even brother Brham. Amen. Hallelujah. So look at this thing and you know Of course, you're familiar with this. You know, now you know sometimes, you know, uh uh uh our our society, you know, we're in trouble because of uh uh children delinquency, so forth and so on. But Brennham said, "No, it's not just children delinquency, but parents delinquency as well." Amen. Because now, Amen. you uh uh uh you know on the table, breakfast table, dinner, something like that. You know, it's our children should witness how we respect the office. &gt;&gt; So that is something that we can pass on to the next generation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Look at this what brother Benham said. Now if you can't respect the man, respect the office he holds in God. That's exactly right. See, respect him. If a minister comes up, your pastor always respect him. I've heard congregations talk about their pastor. I'll just talk about him, run him down, ridicule him. How is that pastor ever going to do anything for you? He can't do it. Don't you I don't say this church. I'm not saying this church. Amen. I don't say this church, but I mean churches I have sinned. You've got to love your pastor. &gt;&gt; You've got to know that he's human being. &gt;&gt; But if we if the brother can help me, I like this portion here. He's a human being, but yet God has made him. Look at that. But yet God has made him his. Did you notice that? God made him his pastor, his prophet, his discipled ministry. Amen. So he's not just Yes, he's a human being, but if God chose him, if God called him, God made him his pastor. &gt;&gt; So every vindicated ministry is not called by men. God made him his. &gt;&gt; And if the ministry is his &gt;&gt; whatever we do to his, we do it to him. &gt;&gt; God made him his pastor. The Holy Ghost has made him overseer. And then you've got to respect him in that manner. And no matter what the pastor done, if you respect him in your heart as God's servant, God will respect you for doing it. We have seen that to the five daughters of Zilope. &gt;&gt; I have basis something will happen because of respect. Amen. So I don't have to tell you and relate you what have happened to those children. Amen. That because uh they they insulted they mocked the you bald-headed prophet. Amen. And and you know they insulted the prophet and they you know they were so innocent and yet brother Benham said where did they learn this how to disrespect the prophet of God they must have heard it they must have witnessed that from their parents. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're sure that Zilopead. Amen. He did the right thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He respected the prophet the way he should. He recognized the ministry so much. Amen. And when there were so much rebellion and division and so forth and so and these prominent people were uh were planning something against Moses, Cilopad was just right there. He did not join it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He stayed true &gt;&gt; the prophet and that was the only basis that these five daughters Amen. Pastor Moses, Prophet Moses, we have witnessed how our father have so much respect for you. How you know uh uh we have witnessed we have seen we have seen these rebellious men visiting our home talking about you. Amen. You have not you might have not known it prophet Moses but we were witnesses. We were young then but we would we we witness how. Amen. Our father stood his ground and said he was the called of men. Amen. Let us respect him and we have sin. I'm just giving you some kind of an illustration because this was their basis. He did not join to the company of those who rebel against Moses. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why parents are fathers, mothers. Amen. You know, elders in the family. Hallelujah. You see how this kind of respect can pass on, can be transferred from one generation to another. If the Lord will tar in if our children, Amen. They have witnessed how we have great respect. I've seen our brother Ernie prayed this morning. Amen. We were we were just right there at the back and you know and and when he stood before you said I remember everything there's so much memories remembering brother Ken. Amen. So I could feel that actually brother Ernie that that gave me some kind of a confidence to preach this this message this morning. Amen. You know it's something that the Lord has inspired you when I stood before him before this pullpit behind this pullpit there's so much memories. What are those good memories that somebody long time ago had stood &gt;&gt; Amen. It remained faithful to the word of God and that is always something that we can look on. Hallelujah. Our previous pastor stood for the word. He never debated amen from any preaching of the message of the hour. Amen. us something to recon. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a good example we can live. &gt;&gt; Amen. By just respecting the ministry. Oh God, help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now the power is say there, you know, just like what we said and it's there's power in just saying the right thing and and you know all these things, you know, it went on through and on. Last time we me we made mention about sister hat. She only said the right thing. &gt;&gt; It was just a horrible conversation. Brother Brenham was testifying. They're just having you know drink, coffee, juice or whatsoever. Amen. Sister hater and their mother was were serving uh uh the brothers including brother Brand. It was just a normal conversation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And let me borrow that story that you told me. Oh, is that okay, brother Barry? No copyright on that. Right. Amen. And he mentioned about our friend brother uh when Lawson because all these things had prepared my heart. Amen. We're just sitting just over a cup of coffee. But that story really uh inspired me. Lord, this is your message this morning. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And and by the way, during during that fishing, you know, perhaps most of you have known the story better much than me. Amen. But just to uh to give the uh bird's eye view on that, you know, they went to going to fishing and brother uh when Lawson had to buy a license and because he's not a resident of Calgary, Amen. Uh in order to get a license, they charge more. It can cost 245 or 250 or something which Amen. the uh the licensing agent is giving him an option in order for you to save. Amen. You just state that your address is in the address of your friend here. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just a normal offer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Dwayne said, "No, I am willing to pay." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just to compromise and tell a lie. I'm not a liar. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have to say I have come give me a license. Here is the money. Here's the amount. I don't care about the discount. I won't compromise the truth. Amen. Hallelujah. But later on he realized that that was a trap of the devil &gt;&gt; because you know something happened and you know there was something that a terrible accident have happened and something have happened at that time and I cannot h uh illustrate how it was but you know at that early brother Ken could have uh you know left the scene right at that moment. Amen. And brother Barry said he just he he he never knew what uh uh what to do. Amen. And he was shouting on the brothers. Amen. Don't don't move him. Don't you know something like that. And he just when he saw amen the situation of our precious brother and brother Barry said he just uh uh raised his hand, eyes open, look in the blue uh blue skies. Amen. And you know talking to God. Amen. And then brother Wayne Lson came. Amen. And upon seeing the situation, assessing the serious situation and the serious trouble, Amen. He just extend his hand, come let us pray right away. Amen. And just before the prayer was being finished, Amen. Precious brother stood and shake his head as if nothing had happened. Hallelujah. And if you look back, Amen. If that simple lying, &gt;&gt; Amen. had been done just for the sake of getting a discount. That lying could have prevented the prayer to be answered. Come on. Hallelujah. The power of saying the right thing. God bless you. Tell our precious brother we love him and appreciate standing for the truth with that simple truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on, bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Speak the truth. Say the right thing, the right attitude, the right approach. &gt;&gt; The right message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to be somebody that is so special. We are already special in the eyes of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now, Amen. Right. said, "Brother Brand, that's nothing but the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. And let I'm not going to repeat the story because I have told that before and you have heard that story before. But uh below that uh statement, Amen. Uh in paragraph 2002, brother Bernham said he said he said the suggestion there said crippled sister, her aged father, she was poor. She could ask for money. She could have asked for anything she wanted to. I said ask anything that's in your heart. Anything that you want to you ask it and thus sayeth the Lord, I'll speak it behind you and you'll have it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, &gt;&gt; amen. Don't just look at what miracle have happened. Amen. With his two her two sons. Amen. But I want you to look at what is really the right thing that sister hatight said. Amen. The prophet made mention of two good options. You're poor. Amen. You can speak bunch of dollars will just fall on your lap. Amen. Healing it will come to pass. But Haiti Wright said the right thing. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Because she knew what she was standing for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she had the right mind of God. &gt;&gt; So Haiti right in her rightful position knew what was most valuable right at that very moment. And let me tell you in this day and age we should know as a bride of the Lord Jesus Christ we should know where to invest. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is for the precious souls. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said hallelujah. It's not fair that we have heard this message quite a number of times. But there are people out there in the islands in some other cities that have not heard this message not a single ones &gt;&gt; single time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're so blessed. And that's why because we're so blessed, we are in the right position to say the right thing. We should know what is more valuable. &gt;&gt; Healing is good. &gt;&gt; But people who got healed, they may die again. &gt;&gt; People get the blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. But by just simply getting excited, you know, there's another another model, another brand of cell phone, another car, it will come to not &gt;&gt; Haiti said the right thing &gt;&gt; by basing that one opportunity &gt;&gt; to invest for the salvation of her two sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Others are questioning because they found out you know that this uh uh you know she asked for the salvation right and salvation is wide in the message hallelujah so I don't care how people can interpret that but as the five daughters of copiad spoke amen and presented claim for the very first time it never happened in the history of humankind hallelujah In paragraph 204, Amen. He said in 203, "And those two little modern teenage sneak boys that had hated the very cause of Christ grabbed one another and begin to scream the blessings of God. The power of God struck that place. Banks fell into his place. I don't know what happened for about 10 minutes." Amen. These two young kids, they never knew what happening inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. They had no idea. They were just in the parking lot playing probably. But there is a faithful mother who was given one last opportunity might be and he was she was able to use it rightfully. &gt;&gt; Amen. He never missed that opportunity and she spoke the writing. Oh Lord, brother Benham. Hallelujah. I'm asking for the salvation of my two sons. And suddenly the presence of God, Amen. Hallelujah. Swept the whole building. There was such a special presence right at that very moment. Hallelujah. And the hand of God, the presence of God, hallelujah, stretched forth to the parking lot. Hallelujah. And took all these two sons. Amen. And they walked through the path at the middle raising their hand. Hallelujah. Holding one another's hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And said paragraph 2004, friend, do you realize what was that? I have never in all my life had felt such an anointing. &gt;&gt; It happened for the very first time. &gt;&gt; I have never in all my life had felt such anointing. The first time I was ever it was ever performed in a human being. It bypassed aristocrats. It bypassed everything else. And went to a poor little old woman living up the in the hill there. God knew what she would ask. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, &gt;&gt; God knew. &gt;&gt; That's why she was given this kind of power to speak the word because because God knew what was in her mind. &gt;&gt; She He knew what she would speak. &gt;&gt; If she would have asked for $10,000, it would have been given to her. If she would have asked for her sister silly, it would have been given to her. Anything she would have asked, it would have been given to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And catch this. Paragraph 205. I believe that the church of the living God is moving into a sphere now, &gt;&gt; not tomorrow, &gt;&gt; now. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that the church of the living God is moving into a spirit now that's going to shake the whole world. &gt;&gt; That's the first time it's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being. Ask anything that you will and it shall be given unto you. Anything you desire. Don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled. We have entered now into that spear. Speak the word right. &gt;&gt; Speak the right thing. Know your position. Stand your ground. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It may not have happened before. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. The value of knowing what we are, who we are, what we're standing for. Amen. Thank you Lord. I believe that you know I have driven my point this morning. Amen. So I believe you know that the Lord has blessed us so much. Amen. But let me just uh uh uh uh bring you to another portion of the scripture because in in in verse one uh this is bonus. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Laughter] In verse one, then came the daughters of Cilopia, the son of Heer. Amen. Son of Gilead, Mckir, Anasse, Joseph. Amen. Now, if you if you look at it, Zilopiad, Amen. He was the son of Heer, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasse, which is the son of Joseph. &gt;&gt; Right now, in Genesis 48, Joseph had two sons, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It was Manasseh and Ephraim, right? So because Jose uh h uh Israel was old and so Joseph in respect he brought his two sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now because Joseph knew the pattern that the blessings go to the elder to the eldest son. Amen. and and he and and and he knew that the uh that Israel Israel's eyes was dim because of his old age. Amen. And so he made a decision based in history &gt;&gt; based on on what had been happening long time ago that the blessing goes to the elder. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so uh uh uh uh Israel was sitting. Amen. And when he was sitting probably. Amen. And so he put he put a frame on the right hand and he put Manasse on the left so that Jacob or Israel would just extend his hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know what have happened? Amen. So when uh uh Israel was about to bless them, his hand crossed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So brother Benham said, "But now notice what taken place. How glorious when Joseph after he married a gentile and received a family, Aphra and Manasse sons." Did you notice at the end Jacob started to bless Abraim and Manasse when he started to put his hands he put Abraim on the right Manasse on the left to get the right hand blessing to the oldest but when he started to pray his hands crossed and he gave the youngest one to the right hand blessing instead of the one that was on the right hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And for the first time Joseph said, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute, father." Amen. Maybe you know you had eye problem but this is the eldest. This is the oldest. Ephraim is already in your right hand right hand side. Amen. And and Manassi this is the younger. You should give the the full blessing to uh to the oldest. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Jacob said no it's not me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My God crossed my hands &gt;&gt; to give the blessing to Manasse. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Luke Manasse, Amen. All to go to Cilopad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now we we see we the bride, the five daughters of Cilopia types, the bride and we are spiritually in that lineage of Zilopiad down to Joseph. And so we receive the full blessing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. No, it's not me. It's God who crossed my hand. Thank God for the cross. We receive the full blessing. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's a bonus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me give you another another bonus here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Brother, can you put this and I'm closing with this bonus. Ah. Amen. Uh, take my rifle off the wall. Take my rifle off of the wall. Hallelujah. Paragraph 33. On the wings of a snow white dove, preached in 1965. Amen. November. And this is one of the last few messages the prophet have left us. And it has so much meaning. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in paragraph 33, David, the lover of the wilderness, when he got distressed and the people wouldn't believe him and the enemies had come upon him, he said, "If I had the wings of Adav, I would fly out into the wilderness and there remain." How many times have I thought that same thing? if I could take my rifle off of the wall, my camp bag, go out in the wilderness, and never return again. I've asked the Lord if I can leave to see the day. I don't never want a funeral service. I said if I can just go out in the woods somewhere, set old Blondie against the tree. You know what Blondie is? He named that rifle Blondie. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I can just go out in the woods somewhere, set all blondie against the tree. That's my rifle. Excuse me. I said that on account of my wife sitting there. You know that rifle a brother here gave me years ago. I killed 55 head of game with it. Double grace without missing a shot. All right. Hallelujah. 55 hitting through that rifle named Blondie. He never missed a single shot. Hallelujah. And and in some others uh uh preachings, Brother Brandham said, you know, when sometimes when I shoot, before I get to uh to the one I shoot, before I get there, there are already eagles get there ahead of me. So he shoot a creator for the eagles, the eagles to feed on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is the same thing with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He shoot and we're the eagles who benefit. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now let's continue on 100 yards. I call it blondie because my wife's a brunette. So she said, "I think more of the rifle than I do her." So I'd like to set it against a tree and say, "Lord, let Joseph find it someday. I like to take the wings of a dove and fly away." I want you to see that rifle, not just a literal rifle, but it's the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "One day I'm going with that wings of the snow white dove and I'm going to put my rifle on one side of the wall." Amen. And Joseph will find it there. Joseph is the son of the prophet, right? But Joseph is not the only son of this message. Joseph types the bride. One day I'm living the scene. I'm going to follow the snow white dove leading the eagle. Amen. And one day you'll find my rifle blondie bright. Joseph will find it there. I believe Joseph had find it already. The five-fold ministry had found already the rifle blondie on one side of the wall and were shooting in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's the same thing, brothers and sisters, that those five daughters of found something. They picked up where their father left them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our father did not go with the company of those who rebel against the message of the hour. Let's all stand up as we praise him this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As we claim our inheritance. Amen.

With all that we heard this weekend, what can we do but count our blessings? Who we really are and what we're raised up for. Blessed be the name of the Lord this morning. I enjoyed that so much. Enjoyed last night as well. Let's just sing the chorus as we call our pastor. Oh, count your blessings. Name them one by one. Count your blessings. See what God [Music] them one by one. Count many blessings. See what God has done. Are you ever burdened with a load of care? Does the cross seem heavy? you have called to bear. Count your many blessings. Every doubt will fly. And you will be singing as the days go by. Count your blessings. Name them one by one. Count your blessings. See what God has done. Count your blessings. Name them one by one. Count your many blessings. See what God has done. When you look at others with their lands and gold. Think that Christ has promised you his wealth. Count your many blessings. Money can not buy your reward in heaven. Not your home on high. Count your blessings. Name them one by one. Count your blessings. See what God has done. Count your blessings. Name them one by one.

Help and come for give you to your journey. Count your blessings, name them one by one. Count your blessings, see what God has done. Count your blessings, name them one by one. Count your many blessings. See what God has done. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We all have blessings. &gt;&gt; Did you hear from the Lord today, &gt;&gt; this weekend? &gt;&gt; What a tremendous blessing it was this morning. Just to think that blessing came through Manasseh, &gt;&gt; through the crossing of the hands, through doing something that had never happened before. And I just think it's so beautiful. We uh we know that we can look at it and say that it was a man standing here preaching, &gt;&gt; but we've got to come to the recognition that it either was a man or it was God speaking to us the way that his word says. &gt;&gt; He's only bound by his word. I just think it's so beautiful because I do believe with all my heart the Lord was here ministering to us today. You know, brothers and sisters, today I just have one comment about it that he he even said it. You know, the she bear story. The children's lives were at risk because of the parents' conversations. And you know, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. I just couldn't help but think that. Hebrews 13:8, don't worry about us. Worry about our children. &gt;&gt; The conversations that we're having, our children are hearing and the devil's coming for them. I just think it's such a an amazing thing. You know, it had never happened before. The the the idea that Sister Hadtie, right, she didn't just say the right thing. She had the right mind in her to ask for the right thing. And was it the right intellectual mind? No, it wasn't. It was the right heart. It was the right spirit inside of her to ask for the correct thing. Even though she could have had the worldly things, but it's just so beautiful. It had never happened before. I've got that written down a few times. It had just never happened before. And I can't help but think about the children of Israel in the book of Joshua chapter 3 crossing over Jordan. They were instructed just keep your eye on that ark. No one has ever gone this way. No one, brothers and sisters, has ever been in the position that we are today. &gt;&gt; Nobody has ever been where we are. How how awesome it is to be where we are. How awesome it is to recognize that we are justified. Can we sing that song justified? I was sitting alone and wondering about what I was supposed to do. You know, we heard a little bit about what we're supposed to do. Say the right thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Speak with confidence knowing that we have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; And if we don't know if we have the mind of Christ, ask him to show us &gt;&gt; and I guarantee you he will. Amen. &gt;&gt; My I was sitting alone and wondering about what I'm supposed to do. I can't deny the times I've made mistakes. I can't hide from him, can you? But I know that deep within my soul I feel sorry. Honest I do. So I try and try and say, "Forgive me, Lord. Forgive me again." And he will justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. [Applause] Justified. [Applause] Justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. [Music] So often I'm discouraged when I count the times I fall. Cuz he promised I'd be victorious when I know that I'm not at all. Then I heard an eagle screaming. His voice quickened my soul before I done it in the first place. You're justified. Justified. Justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Justified. Justified. You have not done it in the first place to justify. [Music] He looked at your perfect picture without blame, spot, or wrinkle. He didn't look at you where you are now. He looked from eternity. He said, "You're just trapped in that body. You bypassed your theophony. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. He said that. Amen. Hallelujah. Justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Justified. Justified. You have not done it in the first place to justify the invisible union of the bride. He looked at your perfect picture without blame, spot, or wrinkle. He didn't look at you where you are now. He looked from eternity. He said, "You're just trapped in that body. You bypassed your theophony, have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Already seen it. Justified. Justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Justified. justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Amen. Thank you, Lord. By his grace. You know, I just want to sing that song, that kind of blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you want that kind of blessing? The kind of blessing that we heard about today. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just want to say, brothers and sisters, we've already got that kind of blessing. &gt;&gt; We just need to recognize it. &gt;&gt; Because once we recognize it, then the rapture will go. &gt;&gt; My maybe help me start here. &gt;&gt; Met the Lord upon that lonely night and wrestled there alone until the morning light. He won a princely title to hurt him for the right. I want Amen. Don't you? He fought for it. I want that kind of blessing that saves and keeps and it satisfies the soul. I want I want that full salvation till the pillows of heaven glory below. Amen. When Israel at last came into Canaan's land, the Lord his riches gave so full on every hand. They drove their foes before them and dwelt a happy band. Do you want to be a happy man today? Hallelujah. I want I want that kind of blessing that saves and keeps and it satisfies the soul. I want I want that full salvation till the pillows of heaven for me roll. Amen. This is the day of grace. The comforter is here. We are a chosen race. Our God is drawing near. He's waiting to Oh, thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. [Music] I want I want that kind of blessing [Music] that satisfies the soul. I want I want that full salvation to the pillows of heaven for me. Amen. Amen. My &gt;&gt; Can we sing Who I am? &gt;&gt; Who I am? I just can't help but think that's what he was saying all all service this morning talking about who I am. &gt;&gt; Who I am, Lord. Who I am. Oh, glorious victory. That day he set me free. And he made my heart his very throne. My life is no longer mine. I'm a prisoner of love divine. And now I live to praise his name. Who I am, Lord. Who I am. I can see now who I am. I'm a part of my savior. I'm a part of his word. It's a revelation of who I am. On Calvary, he died to redeem his lost bride. The King of Kings became my savior. This is God's great mystery of his love expressed to me that Christ and I may be made one. Who I am, Lord, who I am. I can see now who I am. I'm a part of my savior. I'm a part of his word. It's a revelation of who I am. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He knows my name. &gt;&gt; He knows my name. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; He knows my name. [Music] I have a maker. He formed my heart. Before even time began, my life was in his hands. He knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls. and he hears me when I call. I have a father. Thank you, Lord. He calls me his own. He'll never leave me. No matter where I go, he knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls. And he hears me when I call. &gt;&gt; Amen. The part of the service that we don't like. But the justice, could I call on you? Would you mind closing in prayer today? [Music] &gt;&gt; Absolutely, brother. Thank you. All right. &gt;&gt; Yes. Um I told the pastor if I can say a few words before of course praying right. Um I just want to thank every one of you. Um me and my family we are truly humbled and uh for the last 15 years we've been here.

Would the choir mind doing that? This one of the songs you sung this morning, you pick whichever one. Is that okay? Am I getting too crazy? And we can sing along, too. They can put the words up. I I would like that. If we could do that one more time, that would just be wonderful. And after that song, just dismiss. We'll do it differently than we've ever done. I hope that's okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And like I said, if you have to go, don't get nervous. Just go. We don't want anybody upset. We don't want to upset the spirit here.
