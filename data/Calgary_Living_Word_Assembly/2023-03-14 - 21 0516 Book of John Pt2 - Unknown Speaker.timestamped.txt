[0:00] long as we are completely behind the
[0:02] word he has no power he has no Authority
[0:05] he has no rights they were all stripped
[0:07] from him at Calvary that was the actual
[0:10] physical
[0:11] manifestation of the scripture
[0:14] that that lamb was slain from before the
[0:16] foundation of the world the only thing
[0:18] that Satan is doing is exactly what God
[0:20] wants him to do brothers and sisters
[0:22] he's not doing one thing outside of the
[0:25] plan of God God doesn't do things to us
[0:28] he allows Satan to do things to us to
[0:30] perfect us that's all
[0:33] my goodness
[0:36] apologize for the technical difficulties
[0:40] you know I just look at this and I laugh
[0:42] if there's anybody frustrated this
[0:43] morning over it just relax
[0:46] just rejoice
[0:48] don't get upset and don't get flustered
[0:50] by it which is what the natural carnal
[0:53] tendency is is to get upset and
[0:55] frustrated by it but you know what if it
[0:57] wasn't actually having problems
[1:00] then we wouldn't have Satan coming
[1:02] against us this isn't God's will for us
[1:05] to struggle and and and and and and
[1:07] strive like this and get upset
[1:11] Satan doesn't want us to Rejoice he
[1:13] wants to try and interrupt the program
[1:15] we're experiencing here so we have the
[1:18] ability to rejoice in the midst of this
[1:20] trial and just do exactly contrary to
[1:23] what Satan wants us to do Satan wants us
[1:26] to get upset
[1:28] and say what are those guys doing and
[1:29] what aren't those guys doing and
[1:31] shouldn't or couldn't or wouldn't forget
[1:33] about all that just Rejoice anyways
[1:37] Just Praise the Lord Make a Joyful Noise
[1:41] right in the face of Satan
[1:43] say it doesn't matter what happens man
[1:45] I'm gonna Rejoice I don't care what
[1:48] anybody else does I'm going to shout
[1:51] because he has done something for me
[1:55] I just believe it with all my heart
[1:57] maybe I'm crazy but you know what when
[1:59] when you have truly got that experience
[2:01] in your life there ain't nothing that's
[2:02] going to stop you from praising God
[2:04] nothing will stop you
[2:09] brothers and sisters we're our brother
[2:11] prayed it earlier
[2:13] things have changed around here
[2:16] things have changed around the message
[2:18] if you talk to people who ministered the
[2:21] gospel of the message I I figured it out
[2:24] I came in around 2005. I'm still a
[2:27] message babe but there's people that
[2:30] were around in 1965.
[2:32] still alive today who actually heard the
[2:35] message of the hour what's being
[2:36] preached today isn't what was being
[2:38] preached then
[2:40] there's a revelation that has further un
[2:42] unveiled itself
[2:44] to us in our day
[2:46] just like covet coming around and
[2:49] shutting down all of our program and
[2:51] changing everyone's life everyone's life
[2:53] this isn't a spiritual persecution this
[2:56] is everyone persecution
[2:58] just like covet coming around like this
[3:00] brothers and sisters one day it's just
[3:02] going to be the secret silent going away
[3:04] of the church
[3:06] and you know those people that really
[3:08] get mad and complain and Grumble and
[3:10] murmur like we've talked about they'll
[3:12] be grumbling and murmuring because the
[3:14] sound isn't turned on because the
[3:16] streaming hasn't started because this
[3:19] because that
[3:20] you know the church will be gone
[3:24] we need to make sure we know where we
[3:25] stand brothers and sisters I'm not here
[3:27] to judge or condemn I want to encourage
[3:30] but I just want to encourage on the
[3:31] right things don't get caught up in all
[3:33] the stuff the devil wants you to get
[3:34] caught up in just move beyond that we're
[3:37] we're Beyond getting upset over over
[3:39] trivial things aren't we
[3:43] God bless you this morning welcome to
[3:45] the house of the Lord
[3:47] I'm truly sorry I don't mean to get
[3:49] upset I just think about it I know that
[3:52] it is frustrating when it seems like we
[3:54] continually have problems with this
[3:56] streaming and and everything but it's
[3:58] all being worked out we're all working
[4:00] on it we're trying we're on the same
[4:02] team we're working for the same thing
[4:05] serving the king
[4:07] we just want to see everyone get
[4:09] encouraged by the word
[4:12] there's so many things I'll just mention
[4:15] this
[4:16] since we started really trying to stream
[4:18] and making it a a Mainstay in in our
[4:22] lives here when covet hit for over a
[4:25] year we have been turning over every
[4:27] single Stone to try and get it to work
[4:29] here and and what we've encountered the
[4:32] the last and sort of final straw is that
[4:35] Shepherd Community being on the outside
[4:38] of the city it just doesn't have good
[4:40] internet service
[4:42] that's all and and as as good as they
[4:45] make it sound
[4:47] it's very unstable
[4:49] and you know that's the biggest problem
[4:50] that we've encountered with the
[4:52] streaming is that
[4:53] it's the internet service
[4:55] but let's just pray
[4:57] that supernaturally God will undertake
[4:59] for us
[5:00] and and just allow this internet to
[5:04] actually work because there's nothing
[5:07] that's too great for him
[5:11] maybe if we have the desire to get upset
[5:13] and and Grumble because it's not working
[5:15] maybe let's just take that and turn it
[5:17] around and just Rejoice that God has
[5:20] given us a problem that we can actually
[5:22] ask him to come around and fix is a good
[5:24] father for us because you know what
[5:27] brothers and sisters even when the whole
[5:29] entire land was dark in Goshen what was
[5:32] the story it was light
[5:34] in the evening time wasn't it there were
[5:37] some houses that had light in them even
[5:39] when it was so dark and so black they
[5:41] could feel that Darkness
[5:43] the whole Shepherd Community the whole
[5:46] city of Calgary could be out but there
[5:48] could be power and internet here in this
[5:50] building if we really want it
[5:53] let's just trust the Lord that way
[5:54] brothers and sisters
[5:57] this morning we just have a few prayer
[5:59] requests we'd like to remember before
[6:00] the church
[6:02] with a Jerry carpenter has asked for
[6:04] prayer
[6:05] from his examination the doctor said
[6:08] they found something and they would like
[6:09] him to come back and have a conversation
[6:13] he's asked that we would remember him
[6:14] and hold him before the throne in prayer
[6:18] brother Philippe chaganda has gone
[6:21] through a surgery this week
[6:24] he was at the Children's hospital and
[6:25] he's at home resting now we just trust
[6:27] the Lord will heal his body now
[6:31] I'd like to remember brother Paul in
[6:33] Lethbridge brother johannan in
[6:35] Lethbridge
[6:36] and brother Gabriel in Lethbridge and
[6:38] his family brother Gabriel and his
[6:40] family they wanted to come today to be
[6:42] in communion service tonight
[6:44] something in the in the heart of a child
[6:46] of God that just wants to be in service
[6:48] when they know the doors are open
[6:52] if anybody else has a prayer request
[6:53] let's just make it known to him this
[6:55] morning with an uplifted hand as we go
[6:57] to him in prayer
[6:59] our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we
[7:01] would just like to bring these requests
[7:03] before your throne of mercy and Grace
[7:06] we know that before they were even
[7:08] consciously acknowledged or recognized
[7:11] that you already had a solution for
[7:14] every one of the requests
[7:16] Lord Jesus we just like to remember
[7:18] brother Philip we pray that you would
[7:20] touch his body that you would just
[7:22] restore him back to his full strength
[7:25] Lord Jesus and that your will would be
[7:27] accomplished in his life
[7:28] Lord we just thank you for the testimony
[7:31] of his life Lord and and his family
[7:33] parents that want to raise their
[7:35] children in the fear and the admonition
[7:37] of the Lord Jesus Christ according to
[7:39] the message of the hour father we pray
[7:41] that you would just bless their home
[7:42] this morning
[7:43] Lord we pray for the Saints in

[8:22] heart Lord
[8:23] father we just ask that Lord as we go
[8:26] forwards that we wouldn't go by fear
[8:28] but that we would go by faith
[8:31] Lord God that when we would start to see
[8:34] the winds come up and the storms arise
[8:36] that we would just begin to sing this
[8:38] song only believe and that it wouldn't
[8:40] just be only believed that it would be
[8:42] now that I do believe and that we would
[8:44] be able to say now I do receive and that
[8:47] we would be able to say that Jesus is
[8:49] here Lord that we don't look for you in
[8:52] some other place in some other time and
[8:54] puts you off in some other traditional
[8:56] form or teaching but Lord that we make

[9:30] your will be done in Jesus Christ's name
[9:33] we pray
[9:34] amen
[9:37] hallelujah thank you musicians this
[9:40] morning if you have your Bibles
[9:44] if we could turn to The Gospel According
[9:46] to Saint John
[9:48] chapter 1
[9:52] in case you haven't guessed it
[9:55] I feel the Lord is just leading me
[9:57] through the Gospel according to John
[10:00] and uh
[10:02] this word is so rich
[10:04] it's just
[10:06] like brother Bradham tells the story
[10:08] about being out hunting and having his
[10:10] little canvas tent there and a bucket of
[10:13] molasses in one of the stories and a
[10:15] bucket of honey in one of the other
[10:16] stories referring to the same story
[10:19] and how the bear with her Cubs
[10:23] one of the Cubs got into the bucket
[10:25] and uh and he said when the Bears
[10:28] finally ran away when he came back to
[10:30] his tent the one Cub was so covered in
[10:33] the Molasses or the honey that the other
[10:35] ones were just licking them off trying
[10:37] to get it all off they're all just
[10:39] enjoying that little Jubilee that sweet
[10:42] Savor that they found and you know
[10:45] what's like that when we get into the
[10:46] word of God and and the message of the
[10:48] hour and that's what brother Bradham was
[10:49] relating to in that story and it's just
[10:52] like that when we read the word
[10:54] we'll just start with uh chapter 1 verse
[10:57] 1.
[10:59] in the beginning was the word
[11:01] and the Word was with God and the Word
[11:04] was God
[11:05] the same was in the beginning
[11:08] with God
[11:10] all things were made by him
[11:12] and without him was not anything made
[11:14] that was made
[11:16] in him was life
[11:18] and the life was the light of men
[11:21] and the light shineth in darkness and
[11:23] the Darkness comprehended it not
[11:27] remember Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[11:29] today and forever
[11:31] every day in our lives that we live and
[11:34] we interact in this world that verse
[11:36] right there verse 5.
[11:39] comes to life
[11:40] and the light shineth in darkness and
[11:43] the Darkness comprehends it not people
[11:47] understand and have no clue don't have
[11:49] any understanding about why we are the
[11:51] way we are
[11:53] there was a man sent from God whose name
[11:55] was John the same came for a witness to
[11:58] Bear witness of the light that all men
[12:01] through him might believe he was not
[12:04] that light but was sent to Bear witness
[12:07] of that light
[12:09] that
[12:10] was the True Light which lighteth every
[12:13] man that cometh into the world
[12:16] he was in the world and the world was
[12:18] made by him and the world knew him not
[12:22] he came unto his own and his own
[12:24] received him not but as many as received
[12:27] him have you received him today
[12:30] but as many as received him to them gave
[12:33] he power to become the sons of God even
[12:36] to them that believe on his name which
[12:39] were born
[12:40] not of blood nor of the will of Flesh
[12:43] nor of the will of man but of God
[12:47] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[12:52] Among Us
[12:53] and we beheld his glory
[12:56] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[12:59] father
[13:00] full of grace and truth
[13:04] let's just bow unto him once again
[13:08] Heavenly Father
[13:10] the only begotten of the Father the Lord
[13:14] Jesus Christ
[13:16] oh Lord how we just love you this
[13:19] morning how we love you every moment of
[13:22] Our Lives
[13:23] father we pray that you would just
[13:25] sovereignly come here and just divide
[13:28] this word to us Lord father we pray that
[13:30] I could just get out of the way and that
[13:32] you would just have the preeminence that
[13:34] you desire father that you would feed
[13:36] your children today Lord God that we
[13:39] could just rise above all of the
[13:40] carnality in this world Lord Jesus that
[13:43] we could cast down every imagination
[13:45] that would exalt itself against your
[13:47] word today and Lord Jesus most of all
[13:51] that you would give us ears to hear what
[13:53] the spirit saith unto the church
[13:56] today
[13:57] father we pray that you would just bless
[13:59] this word now
[14:01] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[14:03] amen God bless you this morning you may
[14:06] be seated
[14:09] I just
[14:11] feel like there's so much in here to
[14:13] to talk about
[14:17] it's taken a long time and I'm sure
[14:18] you've probably seen it to actually get
[14:21] to uh
[14:22] verse 14.
[14:25] but like I said there's so much in here
[14:27] and and I believe I could still go back
[14:29] to verse 12 and say as many as received
[14:31] him to them gave you power to become the
[14:33] sons of God even to them which believe
[14:34] on his name
[14:36] not on the titles
[14:39] not in the father not of the son not of
[14:41] the Holy Ghost not not putting into some
[14:44] different context not some doctrine of a
[14:47] devil because we know the trinitarian
[14:49] gospel is of hell
[14:52] it is not a religious thing or or maybe
[14:54] it is a religious thing maybe it's a fig
[14:56] leaf right out of the Book of Genesis
[14:59] but you know I don't want to talk about
[15:00] that today what I want to talk about is
[15:02] verse 14 and how so many times brother
[15:06] Branham and and many other people in
[15:08] this world they say verse 1 and verse 14
[15:12] together
[15:13] like a sandwich
[15:15] and that's really the way I would like
[15:17] to talk about it today as as we go
[15:20] forwards because many times we hear in
[15:23] the beginning was the word the word was
[15:25] with God and the Word was God and the
[15:28] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[15:31] and that's what we hear and and if we
[15:34] don't know many people do I know this
[15:36] but sometimes I feel like maybe people
[15:39] don't know they're not aware of this
[15:40] those are two separate verses and
[15:43] they're only partial uh the the first
[15:46] verse is the entire verse verse 1 of
[15:48] chapter one but verse 14 is only half of
[15:51] the verse it's only a portion of verse
[15:53] 14. but brothers and sisters if you
[15:56] think about it in the beginning was the
[15:57] word the word was made flesh
[16:01] the word was with God in the beginning
[16:03] was the word and the Word was with God
[16:05] and the Word was God
[16:07] how many verses are there
[16:10] there's like 12
[16:12] verses
[16:13] between verse 1 and verse 14. there is a
[16:17] lot of action going on there if you
[16:21] really step back and look at it so I
[16:23] just wanted to throw this out there as
[16:25] an encouragement when we listen to the
[16:27] message of the hour when we hear
[16:29] somebody say in the beginning was the
[16:31] word the word was with God the Word was
[16:32] God the word was made flesh and dwelt
[16:35] Among Us that is a powerful statement
[16:38] because really you can't have those two
[16:41] verses without having everything else in
[16:43] between
[16:45] it's big it's not little it's not just
[16:48] taking a portion of the two we know that
[16:50] we have to take the entire word
[16:52] all of it so I just believe it's really
[16:55] powerful to look at every single part of
[16:57] it there's so many things in here about
[16:59] this is John the Baptist this is the
[17:01] account of John the Baptist and John the
[17:04] Baptist is a type of William Mary and
[17:07] Bradham and how John the Baptist was
[17:09] sent to forerun the first coming of the
[17:11] Lord Jesus Christ William Branham was
[17:13] sent to four on the second coming of the
[17:15] Lord Jesus Christ
[17:18] he was not that light
[17:21] but was sent to Bear witness of that
[17:23] light
[17:25] amen and you know there's spirits today
[17:27] that still want to try and say that
[17:30] William Branham was that light
[17:33] and what a terrible thing and we talked
[17:36] about it a while ago but I'm just going
[17:37] to dwell on it for a second here just
[17:39] just hit on it a little bit and that is
[17:42] that even when that Spirit would rise up
[17:43] around the message of the hour before
[17:45] the seals would be open
[17:47] God had to correct that that spirit that
[17:50] that Antichrist spirit that would try
[17:52] and creep its way into the church and
[17:54] cause it to be lukewarm formal and
[17:56] Powerless he couldn't open the seals if
[17:59] people were going to make him Christ
[18:00] Branham
[18:02] and there's people that will look at it
[18:03] today and say well oh you follow William
[18:05] Branham you worship Him you follow a man
[18:08] no we don't follow a man we follow
[18:10] Christ because that man pointed to
[18:12] Christ what he did was he actually
[18:15] expounded upon the word as he was
[18:17] instructed to do
[18:19] and if anybody has the seed Gene of God
[18:21] in them I I've said this a few times
[18:23] recently to people if you believe in
[18:26] Jesus Christ with all your heart and
[18:29] that you have eternal life
[18:31] if you believe
[18:33] if you take a look at this message of
[18:35] the hour
[18:36] for real
[18:37] if you really examine it you won't be
[18:39] able to deny it
[18:42] but if you hold on to a former
[18:44] traditional teaching and say wow that's
[18:46] just as far as I can go I can't allow
[18:48] further Revelation to be given to me
[18:49] there you sit there you will be you
[18:52] won't be able to go further you won't
[18:54] see what the message of the hour
[18:55] actually is the revealing of Christ not
[18:59] just
[19:00] the masterpiece
[19:06] sometimes I just get off on a tangent
[19:08] and I just say forgive me
[19:12] there's a lot between those two verses
[19:15] we'll talk about that in a little bit I
[19:17] just have a few announcements there's a
[19:19] communion service tonight
[19:20] I just wanted to remind everyone that
[19:22] there's a calendar that's sent out every
[19:23] single month I heard that there was some
[19:26] confusion on whether there was a service
[19:27] tonight maybe it's a covid question I
[19:29] don't know but there's a calendar that's
[19:32] sent out and uh
[19:33] it's on the calendar that we're doing
[19:35] communion if you have troubles receiving
[19:38] the calendar maybe just reach out to one
[19:40] of the deacons or someone around you and
[19:42] we can certainly make sure that you are
[19:44] included in the email it shows what's
[19:47] happening in in the month in the church
[19:52] um so yeah look for the calendar we will
[19:54] be away at the end of this month the
[19:57] last week of the month
[19:59] um
[19:59] and uh we're just certainly thankful
[20:01] that brother Phil has agreed to take the
[20:04] service on the 26th which is a Wednesday
[20:07] and brother Mervin has agreed to take
[20:09] the service on the 30th so we just say
[20:12] pray for our brothers
[20:13] trust the Lord will bless you mightily
[20:16] through our brothers and that he has put
[20:18] something on their hearts that's just
[20:20] burning to come out
[20:22] so we uh we're certainly thankful
[20:25] um we in case anybody that's wondering
[20:28] we're going to fellowship with the
[20:29] stewards
[20:31] for the John Sister Sarah
[20:33] Steward and their son brother John
[20:36] Steward and for the John Steward for
[20:38] those people who are maybe unfamiliar
[20:40] but the John Stewart is the one John Jr
[20:43] is the one who actually donated a kidney
[20:46] to brother Jeremy this year
[20:48] and that was after his wedding so we're
[20:52] going to go and see them they've been
[20:54] inviting me to go and fellowship with
[20:56] them for many years and every year in
[21:00] June there's something special that
[21:02] happens with fish and uh it's going to
[21:04] be a fishing experience so I'm
[21:07] absolutely thrilled to be able to just
[21:09] go there this year and and do that so we
[21:12] just uh
[21:14] pray for traveling mercies we're going
[21:16] to be traveling I believe it's 14 hours
[21:19] 14 hours one way to get there and uh
[21:23] we'll just see what the Lord has in
[21:25] store we'll be taking our camper and
[21:27] it'll be a wonderful time of Fellowship
[21:29] I'm sure because we're going with
[21:31] Believers we're not going to mix in the
[21:33] world we're not going to a place where
[21:36] we can be unbelievers we're not looking
[21:38] to get a way to be different people
[21:40] we're looking to go fellowship and do uh
[21:43] you know what believers do
[21:45] that's just Fellowship around the word
[21:47] with a little bit of fishing of course
[21:50] so that's where we're going at the end
[21:52] of the month we'll be gone for about a
[21:54] week and we'll be back for service I
[21:57] guess uh the beginning of June it'll be
[21:59] the first Wednesday service Lord willing
[22:03] um
[22:03] I just would like to throw something out
[22:05] there as well uh moving on from the
[22:08] announcements remember communion service
[22:10] tonight at 6 pm I'll just throw this out
[22:13] there sorry we'll do it the same format
[22:15] we did last time we'll have two Deacon
[22:16] staging people just come park in the
[22:18] parking lot we'll make sure that we are
[22:21] connected via the Internet we've got the
[22:23] wi-fi system

[22:27] stream
[22:29] um yeah we'll just have a comedian

[22:32] service we'll just have a little
[22:34] exhortation and then you know do the the
[22:37] bread and the wine
[22:39] just so everyone can come together come
[22:40] to the communion table
[22:42] um
[22:43] I just would like to offer a bit of a
[22:45] correction as well
[22:47] on Wednesday I mentioned something I
[22:49] referred to a speech that Benjamin
[22:52] Netanyahu had had put forth and uh it
[22:56] truly it's a little embarrassing even
[22:58] for me to say this but I'm going to
[23:00] because it's the position that I'm in
[23:02] I'm not going to try and have too much
[23:04] pride to actually stand behind something
[23:06] that is wrong and what I said on
[23:09] Wednesday night was an error Benjamin
[23:11] Netanyahu had never said those words
[23:13] which is alarming for me I have to look
[23:18] at myself in the mirror and and hear
[23:20] people tell me did you realize that was
[23:22] actually a hoax and I'll just read sort
[23:25] of what I found I did a little research
[23:26] afterwards
[23:29] um it's just there on the internet it
[23:31] says the text of this speech
[23:33] is being newly shared on social media
[23:36] because of the conflict that's happening
[23:38] in Israel right now currently
[23:42] it's it's currently being shared on
[23:43] social media but it first appeared
[23:45] online in 2014.
[23:48] when someone named shawl B
[23:51] the owner of a blogspot called free
[23:54] thought posted it with the final line
[23:57] that's been omitted in the Facebook post
[23:59] that's going around now
[24:01] and the last line says and then I awoke
[24:05] and it was all a dream
[24:09] on May the 13th 2021 he wrote a new blog
[24:12] post titled I created a monster that
[24:14] addresses how this made-up speech
[24:16] started to spread without context I
[24:19] wrote a work of viral fake news
[24:21] completely unintentionally he said
[24:24] I wasn't specifically intending for my
[24:27] openly fictional prose to get copy
[24:31] pasted
[24:32] and circulated as if it were real
[24:35] it seems that every time Israel goes
[24:37] into yet another round of fighting with
[24:39] Hamas my monster seemingly of its own
[24:41] volition creaks open the top of its
[24:45] coffin lurches out into cyberspace and
[24:48] storms around the world now in multiple
[24:50] languages
[24:52] you know brothers and sisters I never
[24:53] want to be guilty of speaking anything
[24:55] false from here
[24:57] and that's the truth
[25:00] um and I'll never be too proud to say
[25:02] hey if I have made a mistake I say
[25:05] forgive me please forgive me I never
[25:08] want to present anything false ever and
[25:10] uh and that was false and you know
[25:13] really I I searched my heart and I said
[25:15] why would I be so interested in that and
[25:18] and I know why it's because brother
[25:19] Branham said if you want to see what
[25:21] time it is in the world stage just look
[25:23] at Israel Israel is God's timepiece and
[25:26] to hear something like that
[25:28] the the powerful context of that speech
[25:31] if you look it up I'm not going to quote
[25:33] it now but to think that there's coming
[25:35] a time where Israel will do what
[25:38] happened in The Six Day War there was a
[25:40] Six Day War it is history that everyone
[25:42] in the world knows
[25:44] some people might claim to not want to
[25:46] actually uh quote it or remember it
[25:51] but that's the latest story of God
[25:54] actually moving on the scene for Israel
[25:56] and you know what I'm getting at is I
[25:58] believe there's something in the heart
[25:59] of a True Believer that wants to see a
[26:01] great move of God in Israel
[26:04] but brothers and sisters we we don't
[26:07] necessarily want to be here to see that
[26:09] do we
[26:10] whether we're here or whether we're not
[26:12] is irrelevant it's not going to put us
[26:14] in a position where we believe any more
[26:16] or any less and if it does we need to
[26:20] just step back and remember that it's
[26:22] not for us Israel is is a totally
[26:26] separate thing the Gentile church is
[26:28] completely different and and the days of
[26:31] the Gentile church are just coming to an
[26:33] end just now don't don't look for a sign
[26:35] don't look for a wonder I just believe
[26:38] for myself the reason for it
[26:40] um
[26:41] right or wrong is that I just desire to
[26:45] see the move of God in the world in in
[26:48] in in the age that we live and we know
[26:50] that if Israel gets into a war that they
[26:52] won't be in war without God that he will
[26:54] be right there with them so long as
[26:56] they're in the promised land their enemy
[26:58] has problems
[27:00] so anyways forgive me I definitely don't
[27:02] ever want to
[27:04] mislead anyone
[27:06] today I would like to talk about our Our
[27:08] Gospel According to Saint John out of
[27:11] chapter one in the beginning was the
[27:13] word and the Word was made the Word was
[27:15] God in the beginning was the word and
[27:19] the Word was with God and the Word was
[27:21] God
[27:23] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[27:25] Among Us
[27:27] and really the ultimate direction that I
[27:29] want to go with that brothers and
[27:30] sisters is that through the message of
[27:32] the hour through the prophet in our day
[27:34] through
[27:36] 1963 the cloud the opening of the seals
[27:40] Revelations 10 verse 7.
[27:43] Luke 17 30 all of the verses that apply
[27:46] to us in our day
[27:49] here we are once again Jesus Christ the
[27:52] same yesterday today and forever
[27:54] and the word
[27:56] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[27:59] but it wasn't through William Mary and
[28:01] Branham
[28:03] he said in his life just like John the
[28:06] Baptist said
[28:07] brother Branham said it this way that if
[28:09] he's laying the foundation for something
[28:11] to come there won't be two of us here on
[28:15] Earth at the same time
[28:17] John the Baptist he said I must decrease
[28:21] so that he can increase
[28:25] so here we are brothers and sisters and
[28:27] the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[28:29] Us so where's that word today
[28:32] the word made flesh dwelling Among Us
[28:36] it's not a great mystery
[28:38] even though it is for many people
[28:40] the millions and billions of people who
[28:42] impersonate Christianity
[28:43] because Christianity is to be
[28:45] christ-like it's not to say that I'm a
[28:48] part of something and and I can go out
[28:50] and drink and I can go out and smoke and
[28:52] I can go out and feed my soul with rock
[28:55] and roll and I can go feed my soul with
[28:57] all of the worldly attractions that are
[29:00] out there whether it's sports or movies
[29:02] or entertainment all of the things in
[29:04] this world
[29:06] they don't satisfy
[29:08] Christ
[29:09] the only thing that satisfies Christ
[29:11] brothers and sisters is this here right
[29:13] here
[29:14] that's the only thing that satisfies
[29:16] Christ
[29:17] maybe to listen to the message maybe to
[29:20] have people Fellowship around the world
[29:22] we know there's a book of remembrance
[29:23] written about those people who speak
[29:25] about him who talk about the Lord Jesus
[29:27] Christ
[29:28] but you know we live in a world that we
[29:30] have to contend with all of these other
[29:31] things and sometimes we find ourselves
[29:34] in situations where we know that it's
[29:37] not pleasing to the father
[29:38] but that doesn't mean it doesn't mean
[29:41] that we're unbelievers if we have
[29:43] something in us that checks us then we
[29:45] just need to ask him to forgive us and
[29:47] move on
[29:48] many times we live our lives in a
[29:50] situation that can that can that can put
[29:53] us in a in a place where Satan will come
[29:55] around and try and make us feel like
[29:56] we're not Believers but remember I use
[29:59] that word feel
[30:00] he can't change the fact if we have met
[30:02] the requirements that we are believers
[30:04] because as many as received him to them
[30:08] gave he power to become the sons of God
[30:10] period
[30:11] even though it says a comma here even to
[30:14] them that believe on his name if you
[30:16] believe on his name brothers and sisters
[30:18] the name
[30:19] of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[30:22] is what all of the impersonators are
[30:24] going after
[30:26] right
[30:27] the Believers say the name
[30:30] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:33] and it's it's amazing because it's
[30:35] really that simple
[30:37] that's that's that's the two Vines
[30:39] growing together that it would be so
[30:41] close that it would deceive the very
[30:42] elected if it were possible
[30:45] the name that believe on his name not
[30:50] names name the Lord Jesus Christ water
[30:54] baptism one of the most contentious
[30:55] things that there is for people to have
[30:57] so much pride to say well that's the way
[30:59] that I've been baptized that's the way
[31:01] that we were taught that's the way my my
[31:03] dad was that's the way my grandpa was
[31:05] and my great grandpa we're all baptized
[31:07] in titles in the Methodist Church or in
[31:09] the Baptist Church or in the Pentecostal
[31:11] church or whatever Church
[31:14] That Ain't Gonna Save You
[31:16] That Ain't Gonna Save Us
[31:18] you know in Jesus day
[31:21] John the Baptist was doing something
[31:23] pretty fanatical
[31:26] and it was outside of all of the
[31:28] religious folks of the day and and they
[31:30] said he's a crazy man he's a wild man
[31:33] look at him dressed he doesn't dress
[31:35] like us in clergy clothes he doesn't
[31:38] speak eloquently he calls us serpents he
[31:42] he says that he's the voice of one
[31:44] crying in the wilderness prepare ye the
[31:46] way of the Lord
[31:48] what's he talking about
[31:50] and here he is quoting the scripture
[31:52] that they claim to know
[31:55] just like the same thing when they were
[31:57] hanging Jesus on the cross when they had
[31:59] him on the cross they were in the temple
[32:01] singing the songs that David wrote
[32:04] the Psalms
[32:06] my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me
[32:10] my feet in my hands have they pierced my
[32:14] bones they stare at me
[32:17] singing those songs in the temple the
[32:19] most religious people of the day not
[32:22] realizing the one that song was about
[32:24] was right outside there dying a slow
[32:27] most painful death ever known to man the
[32:30] most shameful death
[32:32] but that was for a purpose
[32:35] but right before their very eyes and
[32:37] they didn't see it hidden in plain sight
[32:40] brothers and sisters do you think that
[32:41] it's going to be any different today
[32:43] is the same yesterday today and forever
[32:46] going to be any different than he was
[32:48] when he came then the most religious of
[32:51] the day you know brother Bradham
[32:52] preaches that there there in the most
[32:55] religious place they the most religious
[32:57] people crucified him
[33:01] the lamb
[33:03] the one the only begotten of the father
[33:07] for us
[33:08] out of Christ is the mystery
[33:10] 1963. so all things was made by him
[33:16] and since he was made all things made
[33:18] for all of us
[33:20] all things was made for by him
[33:24] then since that is true
[33:27] we should make our identification
[33:30] should be with him
[33:32] we should be identified ourselves with
[33:35] him
[33:36] because he has identified himself with
[33:39] us
[33:41] brother Branham says this in this
[33:42] message that he is the principal theme
[33:44] of the entire Bible and that if we can't
[33:46] see Jesus Christ in every single
[33:48] scripture every single line then we need
[33:50] to go back right to the beginning and
[33:51] start over again until we do
[33:54] but he's the principal theme of The
[33:55] Bible and he says this also that he
[33:57] should be the Principal theme of Our
[33:59] Lives
[34:00] we should be identified with him how
[34:04] by living for him
[34:06] not just a confession
[34:11] so many people take a confession and say
[34:15] I say
[34:17] it's got you this place now are you a
[34:19] Christian
[34:21] brother Brown I'm asking that question
[34:22] are you a Christian
[34:26] someone says I'm a Methodist
[34:28] well that's a long way from being making
[34:30] yourself known as a Christian
[34:32] now look what the Methodist does
[34:35] I'm a Baptist
[34:38] look what the Baptist does I'm a
[34:41] Catholic look what they do see
[34:45] I'll throw this out there I'm a message
[34:47] believer
[34:49] what do you do
[34:51] brother Brown if we were to just take it
[34:53] into context here and put it in here I'm
[34:55] just saying it for an illustration an
[34:58] illustrative purpose
[34:59] have someone say I'm a message believer
[35:02] what do they do
[35:06] what do they do
[35:07] are they at the doors every time the
[35:09] doors are open
[35:11] we just can't wait to get to church
[35:14] just want to be a part of Fellowship
[35:15] just not interested in what anybody says
[35:18] if they hear something nasty that
[35:20] someone said something somebody just
[35:22] can't help it but take a shot at
[35:23] somebody else's character and and to
[35:26] hear it and be able to say wow you know
[35:28] I think they must not have meant that
[35:30] when someone would have the opportunity
[35:32] to take a shot because they're right
[35:34] they know they're right both parties
[35:37] know they're right and they take that
[35:39] shot because they're right
[35:41] in their own self-righteousness
[35:44] what does the other person do the
[35:46] message believer
[35:48] you know what brother Branham says
[35:50] when we're truly dead to ourselves we're
[35:52] a dead man
[35:53] kick a dead man what do they do
[35:56] they don't even move
[35:59] uh but one spot brother Bradham says you
[36:01] know what they'll do they'll actually
[36:02] just run away and quietly go pray for
[36:04] that person and just ask that the Lord
[36:06] would bless them and just just grant
[36:08] unto them all that they desire not
[36:10] actually go into the carnal Realms and
[36:12] say oh you did this to me you you you no
[36:14] good person no
[36:17] what does the believer what does the
[36:19] message believer do
[36:22] he says but the only way that you can
[36:24] actually be a Christian is for Christ to
[36:28] identify himself in you
[36:33] for Christ to identify himself in you
[36:39] this is the prophet speaking here how we
[36:42] got a stinger there
[36:44] and he says I hope everybody on the tape
[36:47] gets that too
[36:50] so brothers and sisters this really just
[36:52] stood out for me this is for us
[36:55] anybody that would listen to the tape
[36:57] this is a quote directly from the tape
[36:59] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[37:02] 1963 after the seals have been opened
[37:08] everybody on the tape gets that too
[37:15] I say Lord
[37:17] help me
[37:21] should everybody get their masks
[37:23] maybe we've got someone here coming to
[37:25] check us we're just knocking at the door
[37:26] here that's what brother Peter's doing
[37:39] on Wednesday we had a service with
[37:41] brother Gilbert it was wonderful
[37:45] certainly enjoyed it
[37:47] I trust that everyone was a part of it
[37:49] on Wednesday
[37:50] I know some people were working but the
[37:52] Gilbert took the service and he took a
[37:54] scripture out of John chapter 20.
[37:58] verse 21 then Jesus said unto them
[38:01] talking to his disciples
[38:03] Jesus said unto them peace be unto you
[38:05] as my father hath sent me so send I you
[38:11] brothers and sisters I believe that
[38:13] applies to us today if we've been able
[38:15] to receive him he's given us power to
[38:17] become the sons of God we have the
[38:19] ability to be sent to shine that light
[38:23] into a darkness that comprehendeth it
[38:25] not but it doesn't matter whether they
[38:27] comprehend it or not we just keep
[38:29] shining forth
[38:30] because the voice has gone forward
[38:33] for the foolish virgins and the wise
[38:36] virgins to rise and trim your lamps
[38:39] because all of them were slumbering
[38:40] those ten virgins remember they were all
[38:43] slumbering the voice has gone forth the
[38:45] shout the voice and the Trump has
[38:48] already happened and here we are
[38:50] brothers and sisters as that voice
[38:53] shining forth our voice into this age of
[38:56] Darkness
[38:57] then Jesus said to them again peace be
[39:00] unto you as my father hath sent me so
[39:02] send I you and when he had said this he
[39:05] breathed on them and said unto them
[39:07] receive ye the Holy Ghost
[39:10] imagine that and we know that they
[39:12] didn't receive the holy ghost at that
[39:14] moment they received it in the book of
[39:16] Acts it was a later thing but he
[39:19] prophesied he breathed upon them
[39:21] brothers and sisters I believe that we
[39:23] just need the Lord to breathe upon us
[39:25] today and we know that he has but just
[39:27] receive it
[39:29] just receive it
[39:31] receive ye the Holy Ghost
[39:34] I trust that was someone that's
[39:36] interested in coming to service God
[39:37] bless you brother Peter
[39:40] and when they had said this he breathed
[39:42] on them and said unto them receive ye
[39:44] the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters this
[39:47] is a prophecy for believers for the
[39:50] disciples for us today if you don't know
[39:52] that you have the Holy Ghost just think
[39:54] about it he breathed on you today when
[39:57] you hear the word of God being preached
[39:59] he breathed on you today when you listen
[40:01] to the word of God and the message of
[40:03] the hour he is breathing on you and you
[40:06] have given the ability to receive the
[40:08] Holy Ghost we have got to receive the
[40:11] Holy Ghost brothers and sisters it
[40:13] always goes back to that always in our
[40:15] age until the day we get out of here we
[40:17] have to keep preaching keep harping keep
[40:19] hammering on the Holy Ghost keep hitting
[40:22] on it over and over and over again the
[40:24] token is the only way that we will see
[40:26] the rapture
[40:28] if we don't get that token in our lives
[40:30] if we don't receive the fact that he
[40:32] breathed the word of God if he didn't
[40:35] breathe on us then we're not going to
[40:37] receive the Holy Ghost we're not going
[40:39] to be there in the Rapture we'll be some
[40:41] of the ones maybe wondering what wasn't
[40:43] wasn't something supposed to happen
[40:45] wasn't wasn't the Sound System supposed
[40:47] to get better or something before the
[40:49] Rapture happened brothers and sisters it
[40:51] might never get better
[40:53] I just want to say that we might never
[40:55] get past covid before the Rapture
[40:57] happens we might never have a better
[40:58] sound system before the Rapture happens
[41:00] we might never have better preaching
[41:02] before the Rapture happens we've already
[41:04] had the best preaching that we could
[41:05] ever have a Vindicated Prophet come and
[41:08] actually open the word to us to give us
[41:10] the word that we need to receive the
[41:11] Holy Ghost in our lives and the only
[41:13] thing that we've got to say about it is
[41:15] just get the Holy Ghost that that
[41:16] Prophet spoke about
[41:19] that's the only thing that's going to do
[41:20] it for us
[41:22] when he had said this he breathed on
[41:24] them and said unto them receive ye the
[41:25] Holy Ghost whosoever sins ye remit they
[41:28] are remitted unto them and whosoever
[41:29] sins you retain they are retained
[41:32] sounds like practice for that Throne
[41:34] that we get to sit in hey
[41:37] there's coming a day where we're going
[41:38] to be sitting in the throne he that
[41:41] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[41:43] in my throne and we know that's not just
[41:46] a comfy place to sit it's not just the
[41:48] best place ever to sit even though it
[41:51] probably is
[41:52] the most comfortable place at the white
[41:55] Throne judgment to sit because everyone
[41:57] else is going to be sweating bullets
[41:59] everyone else is going to be saying oh
[42:01] my I sure hope there's something left
[42:03] for me because my soul is dangling over
[42:05] hell because every single person ahead
[42:07] of me whose name is not found written in
[42:09] the Lamb's Book of Life or somebody
[42:10] doesn't have something good to say about
[42:12] them they're dropped into the Lake of
[42:14] Fire right before everyone
[42:16] and I've got maybe a hundred thousand
[42:18] people ahead of me that's not very many
[42:21] goodness sakes
[42:24] will I grant to sit with me in my Throne
[42:26] brothers and sisters whosoever sins ye
[42:29] remit they are remitted if we could
[42:31] think about that think of the power of
[42:34] that think that we will be judging
[42:35] angels
[42:37] we have the ability to see people go to
[42:39] heaven we have the ability to impart
[42:42] eternal life unto people on this Earth
[42:45] if we think about what the prophet said
[42:47] he wants to take as many people with him
[42:48] as he can
[42:50] every single person that we interact
[42:52] with every single time that we come up
[42:54] to someone in the world we've got an
[42:56] opportunity to shine that light into
[42:58] their lives to shine the light that that
[43:01] John spoke about John the Baptist here
[43:03] that he he was not that light but he was
[43:05] sent to Bear witness of that light
[43:07] brothers and sisters the prophet came
[43:08] and he was given that light he was given
[43:10] that life he was given the open word for
[43:12] a purpose now he's taken that word and
[43:15] he's given it to the people
[43:17] who will actually believe on his name
[43:19] not the prophet's name who will believe
[43:21] on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:24] but those are the ones who are actually
[43:25] bearing witness of that light now today
[43:28] it's not just a a message from John the
[43:31] Baptist it's not just a message from
[43:32] Saint John the Divine it's not just a
[43:35] message from Paul it's not just a
[43:36] message from William Miriam Branham all
[43:38] of those were for a purpose so that
[43:40] there could be a culmination of all the
[43:42] ages
[43:43] in you
[43:46] in me
[43:49] whosoever sins ye remit they are
[43:50] remitted unto them
[43:53] how many people wants to see people's
[43:54] sins retained unto them
[43:57] after you hear the prophet of God give
[43:59] an explanation of what it go what what
[44:01] it's like to go into the into the
[44:03] regions of the Lost he called it and he
[44:06] said that you wouldn't wish that on your
[44:07] worst enemy
[44:10] think about that what it would be like
[44:12] to be there and and realize that
[44:15] there's this conveyor belt and you can't
[44:17] get off it and it's coming towards the
[44:19] white throne and unless someone has a
[44:21] good word for you you're going to be
[44:23] thrown into that Lake of Fire because
[44:24] you know for sure that you did not
[44:27] receive the word for your day that you
[44:29] didn't have the token that you didn't
[44:31] remit sins for other people so why
[44:33] should anybody remit a sin for you
[44:36] how alarming it must be for those people
[44:39] in that moment you just can't even
[44:42] imagine the fear that must be on them
[44:44] I'm not trying to preach fear I'm trying
[44:46] to preach Joy I'm trying to preach
[44:48] encouragement because we have the
[44:50] ability based on this scripture to save
[44:52] people from that brothers and sisters
[44:53] that's where I'm going with this we have
[44:55] been able to receive him we've been able
[44:58] to receive him he's given us power to be
[45:00] the sons of God the ones that can remit
[45:03] sins for other people
[45:07] we don't want to attain sins
[45:09] I thought that was so good on Wednesday
[45:11] brother Gilbert
[45:13] receive ye the Holy Ghost he's breathed
[45:16] on you
[45:17] and if you haven't heard him breathe on
[45:18] you if you haven't felt him breathe on
[45:20] you just just pray and ask him to
[45:22] breathe on you and just press play on a
[45:26] message and see if he won't breathe on
[45:28] you
[45:29] just pick up the Bible and read it as a
[45:32] new book understanding that the seals
[45:34] are open not just six of them but all
[45:36] seven of them are open and just see if
[45:39] he won't breathe upon you and actually
[45:41] cause something to change in your life
[45:43] just accept him receive the Holy Ghost
[45:47] you know brothers and sisters that's
[45:49] what brother Gilbert was talking about
[45:50] and where we're going with this today
[45:51] Lord willing that you know once we
[45:53] receive him once we understand that he's
[45:55] breathed upon us once we understand that
[45:57] we have that ability to remit sin in
[46:00] other people's lives not just ours but
[46:02] other people's lives that's powerful
[46:03] that's really powerful once we get that
[46:06] though in our lives then you know what
[46:08] we can speak the word with authority
[46:10] brothers and sisters
[46:12] we don't have to tolerate the stuff the
[46:14] devil will try and hang on us we don't
[46:17] Satan wants us to believe that there's
[46:19] some sort of a ransom that that he can
[46:21] hold us for that that that we did
[46:24] something that nobody else can ever know
[46:26] about and and because of that thing
[46:28] because of that secret that's there that
[46:30] lies there in our lives that we just
[46:32] haven't quite attained to that place
[46:35] that we want to get to but you know what
[46:37] brothers and sisters that's a lie of the
[46:40] devil if you have met the requirements
[46:42] that God has set out for you today then
[46:45] you have met the requirements for all
[46:47] time
[46:49] it's not going to be some some day that
[46:52] I'm going to get there brothers and
[46:54] sisters right now if he is the present
[46:56] tense I am it's right now make it today
[46:59] just start speaking it speak the word
[47:01] have a positive confession say I know
[47:04] that I'm a Son of God do you know why
[47:06] because I believe on his name
[47:08] because I receive him
[47:10] how do we receive him receive a prophet
[47:13] today
[47:14] receive someone who is willing to speak
[47:17] the word
[47:18] I had a situation uh last Sunday
[47:22] we we wind up bringing two vehicles into
[47:24] the city because I come early to church
[47:27] and uh so
[47:30] the long and the short of it is I left
[47:31] my truck
[47:32] and and I jumped in with Lisa and we
[47:34] went to a couple of Mother's Day things
[47:36] last Sunday and we went and saw Lisa's
[47:39] parents and then we went and saw my
[47:40] mother
[47:42] and after it all it was about 4 30 5
[47:44] o'clock we were on the road well outside
[47:48] of Calgary almost to Okotoks and I said
[47:50] oh
[47:51] shoot I I forgot that I left my truck in
[47:54] Calgary
[47:56] and we said ah we'll just go get it
[47:57] tomorrow let's just go home we were
[47:59] weary after all of the day's events
[48:03] and so in the morning
[48:05] again I leave early I I got up and I
[48:08] just called an Uber I just left the
[48:10] family I didn't want to upset everyone
[48:11] it was the first day of homeschooling
[48:13] again and all this new stuff going on I
[48:16] just left it alone so I I took an Uber
[48:18] and as I'm in this van I knew something
[48:21] was different about this man right away
[48:24] and uh and as we are going I see that he
[48:27] has a holy bible sitting there right by
[48:29] his console shifter
[48:31] and I said to a man is that a Bible
[48:33] right there that I see and uh and he
[48:36] said well yes it is I said you're a
[48:38] Christian he's like well I'm I'm
[48:40] religious yeah I'm I guess I'm a
[48:42] Christian yeah and I said well that's
[48:44] wonderful I I just love that that's
[48:46] that's beautiful it's something to be
[48:48] able to actually have that testimony
[48:50] about one's life and uh and he said you
[48:53] know I I I I'm I'm a Seventh-Day
[48:56] Adventist and we just started to
[48:58] Fellowship we started to pour from one
[48:59] cup into the other and we talked about
[49:01] religion and and I gave him my opinion
[49:03] about how it can be a fig leaf and a
[49:05] covering and how so many people like to
[49:07] cloak themselves in that in that fig
[49:09] leaf and and religion and I I found that
[49:12] I kind of went a little far with that
[49:14] because he said well there has to be
[49:15] some sort of religion in people's lives
[49:17] it kind of keeps people sort of center
[49:20] of the road from all the fanaticism in
[49:22] this world and I said I guess I guess I
[49:25] get that you know
[49:27] um but what I mean more than anything
[49:28] instead of religion I'll just say it
[49:30] like this what what I believe it sort of
[49:33] came out and you know you get like five
[49:34] minutes to explain to someone what you
[49:36] believe you want to try and impart
[49:37] something that will be of value
[49:40] and uh you know I I just wonder maybe
[49:43] Lord willing that could be the brother
[49:45] that came here could be that Uber driver
[49:48] is wonderful because he asked me what
[49:50] church do you go to and I said well just
[49:51] a little church in in Shepherd you know
[49:53] it's uh the old Community Center and and
[49:56] I said to him you know what we believe
[49:57] there we just simply believe this we're
[49:59] interdenominational no denomination
[50:02] um International group of people from
[50:04] all over the world that meet there and
[50:06] what we believe is that we need to have
[50:08] the Life of Christ
[50:10] put away all of the fluff all of the
[50:13] religious behavior all the religious
[50:14] motions and just believe the word of God
[50:17] for your day just believe that Christ is
[50:19] being Christ like being a Christian
[50:21] means to be christ-like and and to be
[50:23] able to express that to this Dying World
[50:25] there's so few of those people around
[50:27] that's what we believe in a nutshell
[50:30] and he said my I really like that as a
[50:34] Seventh-Day Adventist that speaks to me
[50:36] and I said right on brother you know
[50:38] like we're brothers hey one day we're
[50:40] gonna meet over there if we don't meet
[50:42] again here and uh you know then we just
[50:45] started to talk about just just the
[50:47] little things in life and and how how
[50:49] important it is to just be kind to other
[50:51] people and to encourage other people and
[50:53] to try and just encourage other people
[50:55] to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and by the
[50:58] end of it we were like man I just want
[50:59] to get your phone number and hang out
[51:01] with you because we were just
[51:03] fellowshipping at the end of it
[51:05] and and for me that was so encouraging
[51:07] brothers and sisters that's what it's
[51:08] all about fellowshipping shining the
[51:10] light of the Lord Jesus Christ according
[51:12] to the message of the hour to as many
[51:14] people as we can in this world but once
[51:17] we receive him then we can just speak
[51:18] the world speak the word I mean
[51:22] over in uh
[51:25] over in the book of
[51:28] first John
[51:30] chapter 3
[51:33] verse 19.
[51:35] it says and hereby we know that we are
[51:39] of the truth
[51:41] and shall assure our hearts before him
[51:45] it's verse 19 of of First John chapter
[51:49] 3. and hereby we know that we are of the
[51:52] truth and shall assure our hearts
[51:55] before him
[51:57] in my Bible the word assure it's got a
[52:00] footnote that says encourage
[52:03] we shall encourage our hearts before him
[52:06] for if our heart condemn us God is
[52:09] greater than our heart and knoweth all
[52:11] things
[52:13] as believers we get condemnation in our
[52:16] lives there's things that happen in our
[52:18] lives and we just need to make it right
[52:23] in my Bible here again
[52:25] I'll just read this verse 24 if our
[52:27] heart condemn us God is greater than our
[52:29] heart and knoweth all things the word
[52:32] knoweth in my Bible it says understands
[52:34] God understands all things he's greater
[52:37] than our heart verse 21 beloved if our
[52:40] heart condemn us not then we have
[52:42] confidence towards God and whatsoever we
[52:44] ask we receive of him because we keep
[52:46] his Commandments and do those things
[52:48] which are pleasing in his sight
[52:52] we're not perfect people
[52:55] but he knows that
[52:57] we're not going to be perfect people in
[52:59] our flesh and he knows that
[53:02] but it's not what's in our heart it's
[53:04] what's the heart condition of the people
[53:06] and brothers and sisters we know it it's
[53:09] out of the abundance of the heart that
[53:11] the mouth speaketh when we live our
[53:13] lives what are we speaking to this world
[53:15] when we experience sound technical
[53:18] problems what are we speaking when we
[53:20] have the song leader sing the same song
[53:23] again what are we speaking
[53:26] remember I've said it we're going to
[53:28] either actually be the mouthpiece for
[53:29] God
[53:31] or we're going to be the mouthpiece for
[53:32] Satan and that's really the truth that's
[53:36] what's going to happen in our lives
[53:39] but what which one do we feed
[53:42] do we feed on the world the
[53:43] entertainments do we feed on all of the
[53:45] worldly junk all of the world they stuff
[53:47] or do we feed on the word and the word
[53:50] and the word and the word and the word
[53:52] and the word and the word and some
[53:53] people will say wow maybe I could just
[53:55] only do so much and that might be good
[53:56] for you and hey maybe it is and that
[53:58] might be the way it is but you know what
[54:00] there's only one thing that the Holy
[54:02] Ghost lives on only one thing and that's
[54:05] the word of God
[54:06] that's all
[54:08] and I say Lord help me because there's
[54:11] times where I'm guilty of feeding not
[54:13] the Holy Ghost if you know what I mean
[54:15] there's things in this world that are
[54:17] attractive there's things in this world
[54:18] that are shiny
[54:20] like YouTube
[54:22] it's easy to go off on a tangent and you
[54:24] know
[54:25] most things are lawful even Paul said it
[54:27] even though all things are lawful
[54:29] they're not necessarily expedient and
[54:31] what he's talking about is just because
[54:33] we can do something doesn't mean it's
[54:34] going to help us spiritually
[54:37] so we need to be careful
[54:39] if we want to see the word grow in us if
[54:41] we want to have the spoken word ability
[54:43] if we want to be able to have the
[54:44] authority that the sons of God truly
[54:47] already have they're not going to have
[54:49] it but they do have it right now
[54:52] if we want that in our lives then we've
[54:54] got to be willing to take that extra
[54:55] step those extra few steps those extra
[54:58] few cautious behavioral things in our
[55:01] lives we need to do those to allow him
[55:04] to be able to move in our lives
[55:07] remember that he's a perfect gentleman
[55:10] he's going to stand at the door and
[55:11] knock
[55:14] and he's going to see if will open the
[55:15] door to him because in that picture that
[55:17] that artist wrote Drew there's no door
[55:20] handle on the outside of that door based
[55:22] on that scripture out of Revelations
[55:23] chapter three behold I stand the door
[55:26] and knock if you open the door I'll come
[55:27] in and I'll sup with you and you with me
[55:30] but if we don't open the door
[55:33] we keep the door closed Satan has got
[55:36] free reign
[55:37] he's got the ability to do what he wants
[55:39] in our lives
[55:42] out of the first seal brother Branham
[55:44] says and and then God takes his
[55:46] messenger with the elect of that age and
[55:48] lays them away asleep and then he drops
[55:50] a plague upon them who rejected it a
[55:53] temporary judgment and then after that
[55:55] is over then he goes on and they
[55:57] denominate and they bring into
[55:59] nominations and start off with that
[56:02] man's work of like Wesley and all the
[56:04] rest of them and then it gets all in a
[56:07] scrapple again
[56:08] and another mystery comes forth then
[56:11] what happens another messenger arrives
[56:13] on Earth for a church age see then when
[56:16] he arrives he the trumpet sounds he
[56:18] declares war see and then what happens
[56:21] finally then he's caught away and then
[56:24] when he's laid away the plague Falls
[56:26] destroys them spiritual death hits the
[56:28] church and she's gone
[56:31] excuse me that group then he goes on to
[56:34] another one oh it's a great plan until
[56:36] it comes to that last angel
[56:39] oh it's a great plan until it comes to
[56:42] that last angel
[56:44] now he has no certain mystery
[56:46] but he gathers up all that's been lost
[56:49] in them other ages all the truths that
[56:53] wasn't truly revealed yet see
[56:57] as the Revelation come
[57:00] and then he reveals those things in his
[57:04] day
[57:07] he says if you want to read it there it
[57:10] is
[57:13] a Revelations 10 1
[57:16] to about four let's just go over there
[57:19] and read this here
[57:21] Revelations 10.
[57:26] sorry I don't mean to get excited and
[57:28] just start reading the scripture it's
[57:29] nice if we can turn to it I understand
[57:32] Revelations chapter 10 verses 1 to about
[57:36] four he says you'll get it all right see
[57:40] so we'll just read Revelations 10.
[57:43] verse 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel
[57:46] come down from heaven clothed with a
[57:48] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[57:52] and his face was as it were the Sun and
[57:55] his feet as pillars of fire and he had
[57:58] in his hand a little book open and he
[58:01] set his right foot upon the sea and his
[58:03] left foot upon the Earth and cried with
[58:06] a loud voice as when a lion roarth
[58:10] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[58:12] uttered their voices and when the seven
[58:15] Thunders had uttered their voices I was
[58:17] about to write and I Heard a Voice from
[58:19] Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[58:21] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[58:24] and write them not
[58:26] out of the first seal which is where
[58:29] this quote is from this is what brother
[58:30] Branham is referring to
[58:32] tying up all of those loose ends the
[58:35] profit for our day was given all of the
[58:37] mysteries from all of the ages that were
[58:40] tied up and actually
[58:42] they become revealed as he goes into the
[58:46] the series of the seals if anyone hasn't
[58:48] listened to it recently I strongly
[58:50] recommend it it's tremendous to listen
[58:53] to the seals there's so much in there
[58:56] but to think that in the first four four
[58:57] verses he he just says you'll get it all
[59:00] from those right
[59:03] he goes on to say takes the book and of
[59:06] seals and breaks them and shows the
[59:09] seventh angel for this alone the
[59:11] mysteries of God is the ministry of the
[59:15] seventh angel
[59:16] to tie up all those loose ends now we
[59:18] just come through the church ages with
[59:20] even history and prove that see it is it
[59:23] is the Angel's message of the seventh
[59:25] Church all right Reveals All the
[59:28] Mysteries that's been hid in the past
[59:30] all the things in the past Revelations
[59:33] 10 1-7
[59:34] that's to be
[59:37] so let's just go on and read from verse
[59:39] four we'll read verse five to seven and
[59:41] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[59:44] sea and upon the Earth he lifted his
[59:46] hand to heaven and he swear by him that
[59:49] liveth forever and ever who created
[59:51] heaven and the things that therein are
[59:53] and the earth and the things that there
[59:54] and are and the Sea and the things which
[59:57] are therein that there should be time no
[59:59] longer
[1:00:01] but this is our verse right here we're
[1:00:03] all familiar with this but in the day
[1:00:05] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:00:07] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:00:10] of God
[1:00:12] should be finished as he hath declared
[1:00:14] to his servants the prophets the word
[1:00:16] mystery in my Bible has this this word
[1:00:18] this note footnote the secret plan
[1:00:22] should be finished
[1:00:24] and you know many times I just want to
[1:00:27] hit on this a little bit here the the
[1:00:29] the the the thought that we we all are
[1:00:31] very familiar with Revelations 10 verse
[1:00:34] 1 to 7 and that's the identification of
[1:00:36] the prophet in our day and and to know
[1:00:38] that that that Mighty Angel descended
[1:00:40] with an open book with a shout and a
[1:00:42] voice in the Trump he was the only one
[1:00:44] that that had the rainbow Covenant
[1:00:46] around him could possibly be the Lord
[1:00:48] Jesus Christ
[1:00:50] and he put his foot on the land and he
[1:00:53] put his foot on the sea and he raised
[1:00:55] his hand to heaven and said there shall
[1:00:56] be time no more this is it all of the
[1:00:58] Mysteries are finished now
[1:01:00] there's no more mystery
[1:01:03] we go as far as verse seven many times
[1:01:05] and we just stop there
[1:01:07] but I just want to bring our attention
[1:01:09] to verse 8. and verse 9 and 10 and 11.
[1:01:13] let's read verse 8. and the voice which
[1:01:16] I heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[1:01:19] and said go and take the little book
[1:01:22] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[1:01:23] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:01:25] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[1:01:28] unto him give me the little book and he
[1:01:30] said unto me take it eat it up it shall
[1:01:33] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[1:01:35] thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[1:01:37] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[1:01:39] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:01:41] as honey and as soon as I had eaten it
[1:01:43] my belly was bitter
[1:01:45] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:01:48] again before many peoples Nations and
[1:01:51] tongues and kings
[1:01:53] brothers and sisters the prophet for our
[1:01:55] day he did his part
[1:01:59] Revelations 10 verses 1 to 7. now
[1:02:03] there's a second part
[1:02:04] Revelations 10 verse 8 to 11.
[1:02:08] whose part is that
[1:02:10] it's ours
[1:02:12] and the part is take the book first
[1:02:15] you've got to be willing to take the
[1:02:17] book we've got to be willing to say I
[1:02:19] receive the opening of the word for my
[1:02:22] day and then eat it up
[1:02:26] you know many times it can be sweet as
[1:02:29] honey
[1:02:30] to speak about the message of the hour
[1:02:32] and the Mysteries that go along with it
[1:02:36] but when we begin to live it brothers
[1:02:37] and sisters
[1:02:38] it can make our belly bitter
[1:02:41] and you know what happens is many people
[1:02:42] they just get stuck in in taking the
[1:02:45] book and not actually eating the book
[1:02:47] not consuming it because we are what we
[1:02:50] eat we can get stuck into a traditional
[1:02:53] rut where we say that we've taken the
[1:02:55] book I've got the message I've got all
[1:02:56] the books and the tapes and I know the
[1:02:58] quotes and I know the Mysteries and and
[1:02:59] my parents have been in the message
[1:03:00] forever and my grandparents they were in
[1:03:02] the message forever and and and and and
[1:03:04] we're just the message the
[1:03:05] quintessential message but have you got
[1:03:07] the book inside you
[1:03:09] because it's not about having something
[1:03:11] that's that's tangible it's about having
[1:03:13] the Holy Ghost and by taking the book
[1:03:15] and eating the book then we become the
[1:03:17] book and that's really where we need to
[1:03:19] be that's the token for our day we've
[1:03:22] got to have the book inside of us
[1:03:25] if my word
[1:03:27] if you imbibe in me and my words abide
[1:03:30] in you then ask what you will
[1:03:32] that's where we have no fear and we're
[1:03:33] able to speak but if we actually don't
[1:03:36] have the book in us if we haven't
[1:03:38] consumed the book then how could we ever
[1:03:40] speak and you know what what happens
[1:03:42] then is we become fair game for the
[1:03:45] squatter
[1:03:46] fair game for the one who has no
[1:03:48] authority to be on our territory
[1:03:51] but if we're willing to eat the book
[1:03:52] then then we push him out of our lives
[1:03:54] he has no room to move
[1:03:57] so just I wanted to throw this out there
[1:03:59] too just hopefully a little bit of a
[1:04:01] nugget in Revelations 10 1-7 that's the
[1:04:03] prophet's work and he's done his job now
[1:04:05] we have a job to do brothers and sisters
[1:04:07] it's Revelations 8 to 11. we've got to
[1:04:10] be willing to prophesy before many
[1:04:12] people's Nations tongues and Kings not
[1:04:15] just keep it to ourselves not just have
[1:04:17] our own little group and have everything
[1:04:19] in common as it were to be able to speak
[1:04:23] the word in truth to be able to stand in
[1:04:26] the face of a storm and say no just go
[1:04:28] right back to where you came from you
[1:04:30] can't touch my family like that or my
[1:04:32] job or or my education or whatever it is
[1:04:35] we're encountering
[1:04:37] Satan wants to come around and try and
[1:04:39] act like a squatter act like he has
[1:04:42] rights and as long as we we say really
[1:04:47] he's going to be there
[1:04:48] we're going to contend with them
[1:04:50] brothers and sisters we don't need to we
[1:04:52] have full Authority and power we are the
[1:04:54] word made flesh today this is what the
[1:04:57] scriptures say our names are seen within
[1:05:01] redeemed and perfect without sin are you
[1:05:05] anointed
[1:05:07] brothers and sisters let's let's not
[1:05:09] sing that song and and just make it a
[1:05:11] song that we sing let it be the very
[1:05:13] essence of Our Lives that we truly are
[1:05:15] anointed and we are inspired because of
[1:05:18] the original life that life that John he
[1:05:20] bore a witness of it he wasn't that life
[1:05:23] he came to bear witness of that light he
[1:05:25] wasn't that light but he came to bear
[1:05:27] witness of it the same thing for us
[1:05:28] brothers and sisters when we eat the
[1:05:30] book
[1:05:31] we can't help but bear witness of that
[1:05:33] light we can't help but bear witness of
[1:05:35] that life because that's what that light
[1:05:37] is it's not talking about a literal
[1:05:39] light like we see shining like the sun
[1:05:41] that shines it's on the Spectrum a light
[1:05:44] spectrum sure it's something that we
[1:05:46] can't see what it is in a life
[1:05:50] out of Christ the mystery brother
[1:05:52] Branham he talks about the purpose
[1:05:54] Christ's purpose of the Gospel the
[1:05:56] threefold purpose we all know this but
[1:05:58] I'll just hit it just so we can talk
[1:06:00] about it here notice now again now
[1:06:03] what's the threefold purpose to manifest
[1:06:05] himself in Christ Jesus to come into the
[1:06:07] body by Christ by Jesus Christ to have
[1:06:10] preeminence to what
[1:06:13] this is my words to take a bride of his
[1:06:15] own choosing that that's what
[1:06:17] and and to restore back Eden to bring
[1:06:20] back that which was lost
[1:06:22] he says that was the only thing out of
[1:06:24] order all the rest of his things was in
[1:06:26] order
[1:06:27] and to look at this world that we live
[1:06:29] in
[1:06:30] he did come and he did manifest himself
[1:06:32] in Christ and he has come to manifest
[1:06:35] himself in the body
[1:06:38] to have preeminence in his bride so that
[1:06:41] she
[1:06:43] having the sword of the word she being
[1:06:45] the church the female
[1:06:48] she
[1:06:49] can restore all things
[1:06:51] because she
[1:06:53] will be he
[1:06:56] and isn't it just wonderful I mean it's
[1:06:59] not wonderful it's it's horrifically
[1:07:01] terrible
[1:07:03] to look at the world naturally
[1:07:06] the natural types the spiritual brothers
[1:07:07] and sisters
[1:07:09] if she will be he
[1:07:12] look at what the people are doing to
[1:07:14] themselves
[1:07:16] look at what tax dollars People's Health
[1:07:19] Care money is actually being allocated
[1:07:22] to do
[1:07:23] to counsel people down that road
[1:07:26] to counsel children in school to counsel
[1:07:29] adults
[1:07:31] to pay for all of the therapy to go
[1:07:33] through
[1:07:34] the transition and then to actually do
[1:07:36] the operation to to manifest physically
[1:07:39] what's going on internally the outward
[1:07:42] expression of the inward issue
[1:07:45] if that's what all of creation is
[1:07:47] groaning about and doing brothers and
[1:07:49] sisters what's happening inside the
[1:07:51] Bride of Jesus Christ today
[1:07:54] I I say that and when I say that I'm not
[1:07:57] saying it to shine a light and say oh
[1:07:58] look at all that it's terrible it's
[1:08:00] terrible what I'm saying is look at
[1:08:02] what's going on right here if the if
[1:08:04] natural types of spiritual brothers and
[1:08:06] sisters there has to be something
[1:08:07] greater happening in The Bride of Jesus
[1:08:09] Christ today there has to be
[1:08:12] there has to be people whose bodies are
[1:08:14] changing who's whose recognition of
[1:08:16] themselves are are less I have to
[1:08:19] decrease so that he can increase it's
[1:08:21] not just something great that John the
[1:08:22] Baptist said or that William Miriam
[1:08:24] Branham said it's what the bride says I
[1:08:27] need to decrease I need to die out to
[1:08:29] myself daily so that he can increase so
[1:08:32] that he can live out through me not he
[1:08:34] but not me but he
[1:08:37] so he could restore it all back to Eden
[1:08:39] so that she can restore it all back to
[1:08:41] Eden so that he can restore it all back
[1:08:43] to Eden through her
[1:08:45] that was the only thing out of order
[1:08:47] brothers and sisters all the rest of his
[1:08:49] things was in order remember Satan he
[1:08:51] came into the Garden of Eden God's
[1:08:53] garden and he took a bride of his own
[1:08:56] choosing now God has come down into
[1:08:58] Satan's Eden okay we just read it in
[1:09:01] Revelations 10 verse 7 he descended with
[1:09:04] a shout he came down with an open book
[1:09:06] in his hand he put one foot on the
[1:09:07] ground one foot on the sea and he said
[1:09:10] the time shall be no more I've come to
[1:09:12] take a bride of my own choosing and
[1:09:14] nobody will stop my purpose from coming
[1:09:16] to pass
[1:09:18] and there's some people that can say
[1:09:20] Amen to that some people can just say
[1:09:22] amen I believe with all my heart that
[1:09:26] there's more to it there's an action for
[1:09:28] me to do and that's to take that book
[1:09:30] that came down from heaven that was open
[1:09:31] take that open book and consume it and
[1:09:35] you know what when you consume it then
[1:09:37] you become it you are what you eat
[1:09:41] out of Christ is the mystery brother
[1:09:43] Branham says no God he had a purpose and
[1:09:45] a hidden Mystery and that's what I want
[1:09:48] to speak on to the church
[1:09:50] this morning
[1:09:52] the hidden Mystery of God that he had in
[1:09:54] his mind before the world ever began
[1:09:57] and how that it's unfolded itself right
[1:09:59] down to this present hour that we're
[1:10:01] living see
[1:10:03] then you will understand clearly
[1:10:07] then
[1:10:08] you see on I believe what's being done
[1:10:13] God's great mystery of how it's a secret
[1:10:18] he kept it a secret
[1:10:20] nobody know nothing about it
[1:10:23] even the angels didn't understand it see
[1:10:25] he didn't reveal it
[1:10:28] he kept it to himself
[1:10:32] and just even that alone one thing to
[1:10:34] know that we're predestinated to know
[1:10:36] that we're elected to know that we're
[1:10:38] Sons and Daughters of God to know that
[1:10:39] we're going to sit with him in his
[1:10:40] throne if we could just forget about all
[1:10:43] that for a second just push it aside and
[1:10:44] just think about this that everyone
[1:10:46] wanted to see this
[1:10:48] and and and he kept it a secret
[1:10:52] but he kept it a secret
[1:10:54] only for a Time
[1:10:56] and there's a group of people that it
[1:10:58] was kept a secret for
[1:11:01] the many membered bride the mystical
[1:11:03] body of Jesus Christ
[1:11:06] nobody know nothing about it even the
[1:11:08] angels didn't understand it see he
[1:11:10] didn't reveal it
[1:11:12] that's the reason under our seventh
[1:11:14] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[1:11:16] there was silence
[1:11:19] and we know we're not going to get into
[1:11:20] that today but there was silence in
[1:11:22] heaven about the space of half an hour
[1:11:25] brother Branham he says that and I'll
[1:11:27] get to it here I always get ahead of
[1:11:29] myself he says that it's the coming of
[1:11:30] the Lord
[1:11:32] that's what that silence was in heaven
[1:11:36] Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted
[1:11:38] to know when he would come he said it's
[1:11:40] not even the son of man doesn't even
[1:11:42] know when it's going to happen see God
[1:11:44] has it all to himself it's a secret and
[1:11:47] that's the reason there was silence in
[1:11:48] heaven for the space of half an hour
[1:11:50] seven Thunders out of their voices and
[1:11:52] John was forbidden to write
[1:11:54] see
[1:11:56] the coming of the Lord
[1:11:58] this is Brother Branham Christ The
[1:12:00] Mystery of God revealed here
[1:12:01] that's the one thing he hasn't revealed
[1:12:04] yet this is what he says here of how he
[1:12:07] will come and when he will come
[1:12:10] it's a good thing that he doesn't
[1:12:13] no he has showed or revealed it in every
[1:12:16] type that's in the Bible
[1:12:18] it sounds contradictory he says no
[1:12:21] he hasn't shown it it's a secret but
[1:12:23] then he says he's shown it and revealed
[1:12:25] it showed it and revealed it in every
[1:12:28] type that's in the Bible
[1:12:30] the coming of the Lord
[1:12:32] the secret
[1:12:33] and you know the interesting part here I
[1:12:36] just will put this out there for free
[1:12:39] he says and that's the reason there was
[1:12:40] silence in heaven for the space of half
[1:12:42] an hour and seven Thunders uttered their
[1:12:44] voices and John was forbidden to write
[1:12:46] the coming of the Lord see that's the
[1:12:48] one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how
[1:12:51] he will come and when he will come it's
[1:12:53] a good thing that he doesn't no
[1:12:55] brother Branham almost says the exact
[1:12:57] same thing in the seventh seal
[1:13:00] there's a splice
[1:13:02] at the end of the seventh seal I believe
[1:13:04] brother Bradham he felt like he went too
[1:13:06] far and he said too much in that message
[1:13:10] because it was a secret it was a great
[1:13:12] secret the coming of the Lord
[1:13:15] and now brother Branham after he
[1:13:17] preaches that message it was a Sunday
[1:13:19] Sunday night Monday morning if you've
[1:13:21] heard the end of the message it says
[1:13:23] that brother Branham went to the hotel
[1:13:25] room and he actually asked the brothers
[1:13:27] to play the tape to a certain place and
[1:13:28] to stop it and then he created he
[1:13:31] recorded a space of the message the
[1:13:34] ending of it and and he changed the
[1:13:36] original format of what he preached the
[1:13:39] night before
[1:13:40] and basically he says he hasn't revealed
[1:13:43] it it's a good thing that he hasn't
[1:13:45] is where it starts out because if he has
[1:13:48] Satan could do great damage is what he
[1:13:50] says
[1:13:51] but brothers and sisters he has revealed
[1:13:53] it his word is fully open and and if
[1:13:57] we're willing to eat the book if we're
[1:13:58] willing to consume the message of the
[1:14:00] hour if we're willing to get that token
[1:14:01] in our lives when he the spirit of truth
[1:14:04] comes which is the message of the hour
[1:14:06] when he the spirit of truth comes and
[1:14:09] that token gets displayed in our lives
[1:14:11] in our heart he will lead us into all
[1:14:13] truth
[1:14:14] and you know the only thing that he'll
[1:14:16] do is lead us deeper into the message of
[1:14:18] the hour
[1:14:20] it's not a cult
[1:14:22] I I just say this for anyone who maybe
[1:14:24] has any any concerns read the book of
[1:14:26] Daniel and and when that writing was on
[1:14:29] the wall and and they didn't know what
[1:14:31] it was and and they said who can who can
[1:14:34] interpret this and and the queen said
[1:14:35] you know
[1:14:36] King there's someone in the land here
[1:14:39] he's a dissolver of doubts
[1:14:42] let's bring Daniel on the scene and see
[1:14:44] what he says see if he can interpret it
[1:14:45] he's a dissolver of all doubts you know
[1:14:48] there's there's someone in the land
[1:14:50] today brother Bradham said and and
[1:14:51] people will so sadly that people will
[1:14:54] say you know brother Bradham was the one
[1:14:55] that was a dissolver of all doubts and
[1:14:57] yes indeed potentially he was when he
[1:14:59] was here but now what he's gone 50 years
[1:15:03] later
[1:15:04] he said when he was here the Holy Ghost
[1:15:07] is the prophet in the land
[1:15:10] and there won't be two of us here at the
[1:15:12] same time
[1:15:13] so brothers and sisters if we get that
[1:15:15] token in our lives he is the one that
[1:15:17] will dissolve all the doubts
[1:15:19] and it's as simple as this if we're
[1:15:21] willing to say I might not understand it
[1:15:23] it's different than what I was taught
[1:15:26] my parents did it a different way my
[1:15:28] grandparents did it a different way but
[1:15:30] I believe that there is potentially more
[1:15:32] to this I'm willing to just say hey
[1:15:36] be it unto me according to Thy Word and
[1:15:39] if there's more promise available to me
[1:15:41] if I go and and set aside my pride
[1:15:44] which is the first actual sin but if I
[1:15:47] just set aside my pride for a second and
[1:15:49] say hey if there's something else that I
[1:15:51] could do to have more of God in my life
[1:15:53] wouldn't I want it wouldn't I want more
[1:15:55] of God in my life the carnal nature that
[1:15:58] we live in says no Cain's nature which
[1:16:01] is in us outside of having the Holy
[1:16:03] Ghost says no
[1:16:04] I don't want to do what the Lord tells
[1:16:07] me I don't want to accept what he
[1:16:09] breathes upon me if you would just do
[1:16:11] like your brother if you would just go
[1:16:13] and get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:16:15] Jesus Christ instead of being baptized
[1:16:17] in titles
[1:16:19] it would be well with you
[1:16:23] but if you don't
[1:16:25] sin lieth right at your door
[1:16:28] if you just got too much pride to say no
[1:16:30] I'm good I've done what I feel like I
[1:16:32] need to do and and I'll just I'll just
[1:16:34] roll the dice and I'll just say hey you
[1:16:37] know what whatever happens happens we'll
[1:16:39] see what happens
[1:16:41] we don't want to be on that conveyor
[1:16:43] belt heading for the white Throne
[1:16:44] brothers and sisters
[1:16:46] we want to be seated in that throne
[1:16:48] and the only way that's going to happen
[1:16:50] is if we're willing to consume the book
[1:16:52] and and that's that we just need to
[1:16:55] receive the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:16:56] that's all that's it
[1:16:59] he says that's the one thing he hasn't
[1:17:01] revealed yet of how he will come and
[1:17:03] when he will come it's a good thing that
[1:17:05] he doesn't no he showed or revealed it
[1:17:07] in every type that's in the Bible I just
[1:17:09] find so much consolation in that because
[1:17:12] I can see the coming of the Lord can you
[1:17:14] see the coming of the Lord
[1:17:16] as Believers today can we see the coming
[1:17:19] of the Lord that one thing that he
[1:17:21] didn't come right out and say it's going
[1:17:23] to be exactly like this and it's going
[1:17:25] to happen exactly that way and it's
[1:17:28] going to happen according to whatever I
[1:17:30] say right now
[1:17:32] do you know why he didn't do that
[1:17:34] brother Branham says it in the seventh
[1:17:36] seal he says because Satan could come
[1:17:37] around and impersonate any gift of God
[1:17:41] it was so secret and so special that all
[1:17:45] heaven was silent for half an hour and
[1:17:47] remember what brother Bradham said that
[1:17:49] that we live in the quietest place that
[1:17:51] we'll ever be in right now Heaven is
[1:17:53] much louder than it is here on Earth
[1:17:55] even in the loudest worship service that
[1:17:57] we get into and and the other place both
[1:17:59] places are loud
[1:18:01] right now we live in the quietest place
[1:18:03] that we'll ever be and so all heaven was
[1:18:05] silent for the space of half an hour
[1:18:08] because that's where the lamb came down
[1:18:10] that's where he descended with a shout
[1:18:13] because he went from being an
[1:18:15] intercessory lamb
[1:18:18] in the midst of the throne
[1:18:20] to the lion of the tribe of Judah coming
[1:18:23] down with an open book in his hand with
[1:18:26] a shout
[1:18:28] with the voice and the Trump of God
[1:18:31] all three in one brothers and sisters
[1:18:33] all heaven was silent for the space of
[1:18:36] half an hour while that happened
[1:18:39] if Satan had the instruction manual for
[1:18:42] how that would happen you can you can
[1:18:43] well imagine that he would have had so
[1:18:46] many different comings of the Lord by
[1:18:47] now can you see that
[1:18:50] that if we had a clear instruction laid
[1:18:53] out
[1:18:54] that there would already be so many
[1:18:55] different comings of the Lord because he
[1:18:57] can impersonate any gift the only thing
[1:19:00] that he can't impersonate is the word
[1:19:04] Christ the mystery brother Bradham says
[1:19:06] therefore the entire Bible is the
[1:19:08] revelation of God's mystery in Christ
[1:19:10] huh
[1:19:11] he says the entire Bible is an
[1:19:14] expression of one goal that God had one
[1:19:17] purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:19:19] entire Bible and all the acts of the
[1:19:21] Believers in the Bible has been in type
[1:19:23] expressing what God's Great goal is
[1:19:27] and now in this last day he's revealed
[1:19:30] it and shows it
[1:19:33] excuse me and God's help we'll see it
[1:19:37] right here this morning
[1:19:38] What the Lord Has Done in his mind all
[1:19:41] along and has expressed it therefore you
[1:19:44] can see the great meaning of what it is
[1:19:46] of what it's being to know this
[1:19:50] then to try and bring it to the people
[1:19:52] see
[1:19:54] then you don't I haven't went into
[1:19:56] details and tried to explain it as God
[1:19:59] has revealed it to me
[1:20:02] we know that the Lord told him to store
[1:20:05] up food for a season
[1:20:08] and here we have him saying that I
[1:20:10] haven't went into details and tried to
[1:20:13] explain it as God has revealed it to me
[1:20:16] and the reason for that brothers and
[1:20:17] sisters is because there was a specific
[1:20:20] day
[1:20:21] a specific hour
[1:20:23] a specific season that it had to come to
[1:20:26] and you know we're we're in that cycle
[1:20:28] we're in that day and we're in that
[1:20:30] season brothers and sisters all creation
[1:20:33] declares it all creation is groaning for
[1:20:36] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:20:40] out of paragraph 106 and Christ is the
[1:20:42] mystery of God revealed Jesus when he
[1:20:45] was on Earth they wanted to know when he
[1:20:47] would come he said it's not even the son
[1:20:49] himself would know when it's going to
[1:20:50] happen see God has this all to himself
[1:20:53] it's a secret
[1:20:55] and that's the reason there is silence
[1:20:57] in heaven for the space of half an hour
[1:20:58] and seven Thunders they uttered their
[1:21:00] voices John was even forbidden to write
[1:21:04] it see
[1:21:05] the coming of the Lord
[1:21:09] that's one thing
[1:21:12] he hasn't revealed yet of how he will
[1:21:15] come and when he will come
[1:21:18] it's a good thing that he doesn't
[1:21:21] know he showed or revealed it in every
[1:21:24] type that's in the Bible therefore the
[1:21:26] entire Bible is a revelation of God's
[1:21:28] mystery in Christ
[1:21:32] and you know brothers and sisters we we
[1:21:34] had brother Ken he would preach it and
[1:21:36] he would say it Jehovah of the Old
[1:21:38] Testament is Jesus of the New Testament
[1:21:41] is the Holy Ghost In You
[1:21:44] Jehovah is the old is Jesus of the new
[1:21:47] Holy Ghost In You and that's really what
[1:21:50] it is brothers and sisters that's the
[1:21:51] coming of the Lord
[1:21:52] it's not going to be a 60-foot Jesus
[1:21:55] don't look for Planes Trains and
[1:21:56] Automobiles crashing and great chaos all
[1:21:59] around the world it's just going to be
[1:22:01] the secret sudden going away of the
[1:22:03] Bride of Jesus Christ and the only way
[1:22:05] we're going to do it is to have the
[1:22:07] token in our hands to be able to say
[1:22:10] that when I get down to that River I've
[1:22:12] got that token in my hands and nobody
[1:22:14] can take it away from me because God's
[1:22:16] revealed it to me personally the only
[1:22:18] way that happens is through the baptism
[1:22:20] of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives we're
[1:22:22] not going to get it through a
[1:22:23] trinitarian baptism that's of the devil
[1:22:26] that's of hell and you know the Bible
[1:22:29] says it not even the prophet that it
[1:22:30] would be so close that it would deceive
[1:22:32] the very elected if it were possible how
[1:22:34] would that happen if it weren't right in
[1:22:36] the midst of the Christian church
[1:22:39] it's not going to be a great demonic
[1:22:41] monster that comes and tries to wrap
[1:22:43] itself in and amongst the church no way
[1:22:45] we talked about it earlier it's going to
[1:22:47] be the most religious people
[1:22:49] the most perfectly dressed the most
[1:22:52] educated and eloquent spoken
[1:22:55] in the world
[1:22:58] but if you don't have the ability to
[1:23:00] speak the word to accept the word for
[1:23:03] our day according to what the Vindicated
[1:23:04] Prophet brought
[1:23:06] brothers and sisters it's going to be
[1:23:08] the Antichrist spirit that will actually
[1:23:10] make us lukewarm formal and Powerless I
[1:23:14] don't believe any one of us wants to be
[1:23:16] there in that position every one of us
[1:23:18] wants to have the full Authority and
[1:23:19] power that we have and so I would just
[1:23:21] want to say this to you this morning as
[1:23:23] we as we begin to close I'll call them
[1:23:25] musicians I just want to say this just
[1:23:27] speak the word
[1:23:29] maybe you don't feel it maybe you don't
[1:23:31] even see it just speak the word
[1:23:34] doesn't matter if anybody else
[1:23:36] understands it or sees it just speak the
[1:23:38] word just say someone has to be the one
[1:23:41] to go
[1:23:44] children of Israel I said this many
[1:23:45] times the children of Israel and they're
[1:23:47] crossing over Jordan they'd never gone
[1:23:49] that way before
[1:23:50] but the prophet said just give yourself
[1:23:52] just enough space
[1:23:54] watch the Levites and when you see that
[1:23:56] Ark begin to go just keep a distance I
[1:24:00] think about a mile
[1:24:01] just give yourself enough distance so
[1:24:03] you can see exactly the way they go
[1:24:05] don't get too close but don't get too
[1:24:07] far just stay exactly in line and allow
[1:24:10] allow the Levites to show you where to
[1:24:13] go
[1:24:14] and you know the reason for it
[1:24:16] is what I want to get to is because
[1:24:18] nobody else had ever gone that way
[1:24:19] before
[1:24:21] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:24:23] and forever
[1:24:25] we just read it multiple times that
[1:24:28] every single type in the Bible
[1:24:30] was the revealing of the coming of the
[1:24:33] Lord
[1:24:34] every single type in the Bible
[1:24:37] brothers and sisters it's no different
[1:24:38] for us today we're not going to do
[1:24:40] something that someone else has done
[1:24:42] we're not going to go in a direction
[1:24:44] that anybody else has ever gone we're
[1:24:46] not going to do what anyone else has
[1:24:48] ever done everyone in Heaven when we get
[1:24:50] to the other side is going to say to you
[1:24:52] how did you withstand all the evil in
[1:24:54] your age how did you go through the
[1:24:56] Rapture what was it like to just be
[1:24:57] stepping through your life and one
[1:25:00] second you're here in one second you're
[1:25:01] there what's it like to be translated
[1:25:04] there's going to be a couple of people
[1:25:05] over there that will be able to have a
[1:25:07] conversation and be like I know what
[1:25:08] it's like
[1:25:09] I believe Philip is one of them we
[1:25:11] talked about him recently Enoch is
[1:25:14] another one
[1:25:15] there's a few people
[1:25:17] that will be able to say I know exactly
[1:25:19] what it was like to to just step from
[1:25:21] time into eternity
[1:25:24] but whether we go by the sky or whether
[1:25:26] we go by the grave we're the Lords if
[1:25:28] we've got the token so the only thing I
[1:25:30] can say to you this morning as we close
[1:25:32] is get the token
[1:25:34] get the Holy Ghost in your life it's the
[1:25:37] only thing that will help the only thing
[1:25:39] that will help
[1:25:40] we can say all the all that we want
[1:25:42] about the quotes and we can have all the
[1:25:44] books and tapes and and memorabilia the
[1:25:47] hats and the shirts and the license
[1:25:48] plates and the bumper stickers and
[1:25:49] everything else that goes along with it
[1:25:51] maybe we even got an eagle belt buckle
[1:25:53] it's not going to do a thing for us if
[1:25:55] we don't have the Holy Ghost in our
[1:25:57] lives
[1:25:59] I'm not going to judge anyone if you
[1:26:01] have any of those things
[1:26:03] they speak about something they speak
[1:26:05] about a prophet a Vindicated Prophet
[1:26:08] that was here on Earth in our day but
[1:26:11] for what purpose brothers and sisters
[1:26:12] not to create an organization to create
[1:26:15] a group of people to recognize that
[1:26:17] they're the PowerHouse of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:20] that's why that Prophet came here
[1:26:23] to introduce
[1:26:24] the bride
[1:26:25] to the bridegroom
[1:26:27] to introduce them so that they could
[1:26:29] have the wedding right here you're not
[1:26:32] going to the wedding don't think you're
[1:26:33] going to a wedding you're going to the
[1:26:35] wedding supper you're going to the
[1:26:37] reception the wedding is already
[1:26:39] happening
[1:26:40] and there's still time he's still
[1:26:43] knocking
[1:26:44] he's still saying just repent and be
[1:26:46] baptized for the remission of your sins
[1:26:50] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:26:52] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:26:53] sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[1:26:55] the Holy Ghost because I've breathed it
[1:26:58] to this age through the Gentile Prophet
[1:27:00] through the seventh angel messenger I've
[1:27:03] breathed upon him just like I did with
[1:27:04] the disciples
[1:27:07] whosoever hath in here let them hear
[1:27:10] what the spirit say if unto the church
[1:27:12] we've been given the ability to receive
[1:27:14] it
[1:27:16] if if we have that seed Gene within us
[1:27:18] stand with me this morning if you will
[1:27:21] or just past 12 I don't want to keep us
[1:27:23] too long today
[1:27:25] I just want to encourage us brothers and
[1:27:27] sisters
[1:27:28] just received the word
[1:27:30] as many as received him to them
[1:27:33] gave he the ability
[1:27:35] to become the sons of God what a
[1:27:38] tremendous honor and a privilege that is
[1:27:40] to think that
[1:27:41] because just like it was
[1:27:44] in John's day
[1:27:46] where the word came to the prophet
[1:27:49] even before the foundation of the world
[1:27:51] even before
[1:27:53] coming out of his mother's womb the word
[1:27:55] came to the prophet
[1:27:58] that word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[1:28:01] Us that word today brothers and sisters
[1:28:03] has been made flesh and is dwelling
[1:28:05] Among Us
[1:28:07] and you know his his word says that his
[1:28:10] spirit will not always strive with man
[1:28:14] and as long as he's here walking in US
[1:28:18] and talking through us his spirit is
[1:28:21] striving through man
[1:28:23] but there came a day when Noah entered
[1:28:25] into the ark and that door was closed
[1:28:27] and and there Comes a Day
[1:28:30] where the foolish Virgin Goes looking
[1:28:31] for oil
[1:28:33] and the wise virgin says hey there's
[1:28:35] only enough for me I can't help you you
[1:28:37] got to go buy your own
[1:28:40] and when they go to buy their own
[1:28:42] that door gets closed and it doesn't say
[1:28:45] that the virgins closed the door
[1:28:47] brothers and sisters we don't want to
[1:28:48] close the door on anyone we would that
[1:28:50] everyone would be able to come and
[1:28:52] repent and and come into the marriage
[1:28:54] supper of the Lamb let's just bow in
[1:28:57] prayer
[1:28:59] gracious Heavenly Father
[1:29:01] Lord I pray that
[1:29:03] you would just be glorified with the
[1:29:04] words that were spoken today Lord
[1:29:07] father I pray that somehow someway
[1:29:11] we could just go on to Perfection Lord I
[1:29:14] know that you gave me so much to say
[1:29:16] this morning there are so many thoughts
[1:29:18] and directions but this is the way it
[1:29:20] went father I pray that it would be for
[1:29:22] your purpose
[1:29:23] I pray that you would just forgive me if
[1:29:25] I said anything out out of turn Lord or
[1:29:28] or or incorrectly father I never want to
[1:29:30] say anything untrue
[1:29:32] I only want to minister your word to
[1:29:34] your children
[1:29:36] pray father that you would just take
[1:29:39] those Lord who have the desire for the
[1:29:41] holy spirit in their lives and just
[1:29:43] father pour out your spirit upon them
[1:29:45] without measure father if there's those
[1:29:47] who haven't received your holy spirit
[1:29:49] that don't even understand it I pray
[1:29:51] that you would just introduce yourself
[1:29:52] to them today Lord so that they could
[1:29:55] see that there's a promise for them and
[1:29:57] father for everyone else Lord Jesus who
[1:29:59] has already met the requirements and
[1:30:01] already had a filling of your Holy
[1:30:03] Spirit Lord sometimes we just need a
[1:30:05] little topping up sometimes we just need
[1:30:07] a little bit more oil a little
[1:30:09] freshening up Lord Jesus and father I
[1:30:11] pray that you would just freshen me up
[1:30:13] Lord God just pour out a little bit more
[1:30:15] oil in my cup father as I raise it up
[1:30:17] unto you and I pray that you would just
[1:30:19] do the same for everyone else who has
[1:30:21] the desire Lord Jesus just minister to
[1:30:24] your children I pray father Lord I just
[1:30:27] ask that you would bless each one as we
[1:30:28] go our separate ways today I pray that
[1:30:31] you would just bless our little service

[1:30:35] just want to try and be obedient and
[1:30:37] unto you and come to the communion table
[1:30:40] we can't do the foot washing Lord really
[1:30:42] effectively so Lord I pray that you
[1:30:44] would just take what we can do and bless
[1:30:46] it Lord we know that we want to serve
[1:30:49] you with all of our hearts it's just the
[1:30:51] laws of the land and where we are today
[1:30:53] father we just asked that you had
[1:30:55] blessed our our service Lord bless each
[1:30:58] one who's made the effort to be a part
[1:30:59] of it today whether in person or
