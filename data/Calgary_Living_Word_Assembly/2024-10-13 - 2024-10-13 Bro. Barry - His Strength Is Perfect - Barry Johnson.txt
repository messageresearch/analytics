the waters and I was thinking a lot of times we always seem like Jesus is the one that called him on the water but it was Peter's aidea Peter wanted to go and God just granted it in a way in a sense it was like a prayer request and Jesus or Peter had his eyes solely and directly on God or on Jesus when he was asking the request but he took his eyes when he got granted the request and that's as Believers that's I'm speaking to myself it's a constant thing let's not forget the reason for the provision the reason why we're here amen amen amen our God is good I just want I just want to take a

time before the foundation of the world if you have a need this morning make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity Lord that we can gather together in your provided Place Lord we know there's the natural building and oh Father all of the natural elements Lord the many Provisions that you make for us in our Our Lives along the way so that we could gather this way but Lord Jesus it's not so we could gather this way father according to our natural senses Lord not according to our feelings father but it's according to your word and the way that you've provided is in you father and Lord we humbly accept your provision for us spiritually speaking today Lord oh Father our desire is to push aside all of our carnality Lord to push aside all of our our past hurts Lord Jesus and to press towards that Mark for the prize of the High Calling of God In You Lord your provided place of worship father there's nothing else we desire Lord but Lord many times we have things in our lives Lord past hurts past traumas past things Lord that we we always get called back to by our old selves and father my prayer today is that Lord we could just die out to ourselves Lord that those past hurts would no longer be coming to the Forefront of our minds causing us to act Lord Jesus but Lord that it would be your spirit that would be leading us and guiding us father that we would recognize our position Lord Jesus that there's no devil in hell that could stand before us when we are in our promised land in you Lord Jesus Lord we love you and we thank you we just want to commit each life that's gathered together here into your hands father each Heart Lord Jesus we pray that you would speak to each Heart Lord father that there wouldn't be one person here today that wouldn't hear from you Lord amen father if there is any unbelief in our midst we just rebuke it in the name of Jesus and we invite it to leave in the name of Jesus if there's any iniquity in our hearts Lord that would get in the way father Lord please take it from us Lord let this not be just an ordinary Sunday boring service Lord but let this be a gathering oh Father where we can hear from the king of kings and Lord of lords father let us not leave this building the same way that we came in but change our hearts oh god father help us Lord to draw close unto you today we pray that you would just meet each and every need made known unto you today by the way of an uplift hand father and maybe even some needs Lord that we didn't reach out to touch you with Father we know that you know them you've given to them to us for a purpose you've allowed them to come to pass in our lives father for one purpose and that's so that we could draw closer to you and father we just thank you Father for the trials we thank you for the valleys oh Lord Jesus the Mountaintop experiences are wonderful but Lord we know the fruit grows in the valley and our desire is to see the fruit of your spirit living on the trees that you've created us to be so father we just want to commit this service now into your hands we pray that you would just meet each and every need sovereignly father in the hearts of your children oh Father we love you and we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians thank you everyone for bringing of your sacred portion week after week month after month year after year the gifts of Music they set the atmosphere it's wonderful if you have your Bibles this morning I would like to read from 2 Corinthians chapter 12 2 Corinthians chapter 12 very familiar scripture and we just trust that somehow some way the Lord will bless our meeting today 2 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I'm weak then I am strong amen let's just bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord we have persecutions Lord Jesus we have distresses we have afflictions we have everything that's mentioned here in this scripture that we just read Lord and we know that that scripture was for Paul speaking about his life but we know that we need to see ourselves in every single scripture there was a time where we needed to see you in every single scripture and we do Lord but father we know that through progressive revelation we need to see ourselves in every scripture as well father because if you're in us then we're with you in every word and father we have these afflictions L father sometimes they're in our flesh sometimes they're in our minds sometimes Lord Jesus they're in our Spirits sometimes they're just from without other people attacking us father Yes Lord Lord Jesus we have these afflictions and we know they're for a purpose and that is so that your strength can be made perfect lord it's so that you can allow us father to come to that place where we recognize we have no strength where we recognize there's no control that we have over any situation in our lives and the only thing we have is you and Lord help us not to diminish Our Lives to the only thing we have is you but help us Lord Jesus to acknowledge that the only thing we have is you and everything else is secondary father Lord Jesus help us to recognize you in every single area every single facet of Our Lives Lord Jesus father we love you and we thank you and we just invite you father to have your perfect will and your perfect way in our lives father in our service this morning Lord we pray that you would just Lord oh Father brood over us as a hen does her chicks Lord Jesus that when we leave this building truly as we've already asked father that we would say you spoke to us as you walked with us along the way we love you and we thank you Father we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning I guess maybe you might wonder why brother Barry's getting emotional I just can't help but read this scripture and I asked the Lord for something and this is what I believe he gave me and I just think it's wonderful because I guess maybe the more mature I get the more I recognize how weak I truly am and how little strength I really have and truly it's the Lord living out through me because I I could never do this I could never be who I am outside of the goodness of God in our scripture this morning Paul speaking we know that he's talking about his troubles and I guess before we get into that I'll just make sure we have uh couple of announcements here I apologize I get ahead of myself we have uh the 20th will be the uh October Youth Event and that will be brother Jerry Fox is coming from Edmonton end time message Tabernacle to do a little bit of a I guess a discussion on how the Lord has helped him in his life and how to prioritize Our Lives as young people so we're certainly excited to to hear from him that'll be on the 20th and then we have brother ciz atuan will take the service on the 27th before he departs to Toronto so we're certainly excited to uh have him as well and then uh one other announcement we have is that the neighbors who have been attending here for the last few years are planning to move to Edmonton and they will depart from Calgary on the 23rd of October and so we're certainly going to miss them and we wish God's richest blessings for them and for their family and we know that it's going to be for the best because they'll be closer to family on both sides and uh what a blessing it is and they'll be going to a wonderful church with a wonderful Ministry uh it's just a win-win except for us we'll have a bit of a loss but we know we'll all be together permanently one day and we certainly just want to invite you to shake their hand and say God bless you we uh didn't really have time to plan a a getaway uh appreciation for them as we desired but um Lord willing maybe we can do something in time maybe they'll be coming back again but it's just not going to work out to do something on the weekends before they go away so make sure you uh reach out to them and shake their hands and continue to pray for them moving is always a difficult thing and we just trust the Lord will continue to part the waters and open the doors and uh just help them along their way God richly bless you Sister Naomi and brother Levi if you uh are following me we are into 2 Corinthians chapter 12 this is Paul talking about the Lord's Grace how God showed him that his grace is sufficient for him and uh we know that if you go back in the scripture a little bit in uh chapter 12 Paul talking about how he was caught up into a a different realm and I can't help but think that maybe it was just a little bit like brother Bram he got to go and see beyond the curtain of time but only it wasn't time to talk about what he saw on the other side because we we know that uh he said he was caught up into paradise and he heard unspeakable words that which is not lawful for man to utter but yet there was a time we know where a man did go up into another heaven and he went beyond the curtain of time and was able to actually bring back word from that land and we know that the last words that he heard was keep pressing on and you know that's kind of where I want to get into today that's not going to be the title for today but I just think it's such a beautiful thing in verse six he says for though I would desire to Glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth and what a concept hey let us just speak the truth in love he goes on to say but now I forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and we know the word of God says to not know any man after the flesh if we do that we are not following the word of God if we get a bee in our Bonnet or a bur in our saddle about another man or another woman we are not in the way of the word we're actually getting a little bit outside of the word we're beginning to transgress it we don't want to see anybody looking at anybody after the flesh verse 7 says and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations God allowing this to happen abundance of Revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me I want to ask this morning how many people here experience that thorn in the flesh that messenger of Satan coming around to Buffet you if you're experiencing that you're being honest if you're not experiencing it I want to say today you're not being honest because as human beings Believers we're experiencing Satan coming around to Buffet us now you might say well brother Barry everything's good in my life I'm healthy I've got a good bank account the house is good the car is good the kids are good the wife is good everything is good is it I want to say is it good is it good spiritually if it is God bless you but we know the prophet said that if there's no battle there's a problem there's something wrong because that's the way we're created we're going to be buffeted we're going to be buffeted for a reason and that is so that his character can come out in us we know that brother bam talked about how the the the Native Americans for the proper terminology once upon a time they would take gold and they wouldn't smelt it they wouldn't melt it down to refine it what would they do to it they would fold it and they would beat it and fold it and beat it and fold it and beat it and when would they stop the prophet said when they would begin to see their own image reflecting back in it it's no accident the prophet chose to bring that as an example if we're being buffeted it's so that he can see his image reflecting back in us to him and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me the first church age messenger Lord take it away from me please Lord take this away from me but isn't it interesting that he came back excuse me he came back with verse n and God's response to him he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee my for my strength is made perfect in weakness my strength is made perfect when you recognize how weak you really are how you can't stop Satan from buffeting you but you can respond to how Satan is buffeting you you can have joy amidst all your trials and we know that that's what's going to put Satan in a position where he won't even know what to do with us because whether we're up we're happy and we're praising and whether we're down we're happy and we're praising all we're doing is praising that's what we're going to do one day is just praise and worship that's it therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities and persecutions who does that I want to say that who does that who takes pleasure in infirmities in sickness in our bodies who who takes pleasure in reproaches people that will do things to us step on our toes who takes pleasure in that who takes pleasure in Necessities I don't have enough food to feed the children I don't have enough money in the bank account to pay the bills who takes pleasure in that or in persecutions my but it's when we're weak brothers and sisters that's when he's made strong and when we're stepping up to the Forefront and saying look at me whoa What a Mighty Kingdom I've created I've got my investments I've got my rsps and I've got my my esps or whatever you want to call them I've got all the Investments maybe the 401ks or whatever they are when we've created our own little kingdoms he can't help us and you know what to be clear sometimes the financial Empires that we can create here on this side are not a blessing of God they become entrapments to us because we have created something that now consumes us if we're not careful but we've got to make sure that we know exactly where we stand so long as we're putting him first in every single thing it's not an entrapment I'm not going to throw off on anybody that's doing anything good with their lives that has a a business or whatever I know what it takes to run a business and it's not easy it takes a lot of energy but God will bless that business when we put him first when we put him first in everything in every area of Our Lives He blesses us beyond what we ever imagine he would bless us with and that's just the way he is but his strength is perfect and that's what I want to title today his strength is perfect our strength is corrupt our strength is crooked our strength is unbalanced our strength is going to get us into trouble when we start trying to operate in this life as Believers of this message Accord according to our strength we are in big trouble we're in big trouble because they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength right but his strength is made perfect in our weakness it just really spoke to me uh as I was thinking about this as I was pondering this we were having a discussion over the weekend we went up to Edmonton yesterday actually that's not true we came back from Edon yesterday we went up on Friday night and we went to the the The Men's breakfast and we heard brother Alistair uh Francis he spoke brother Jeff Fair he spoke and uh our dear brother Jeff Paige he spoke as well he could be a preacher you know we all are preachers aren't we we're written Epistles read of all men but each one brought of their sacred portion yesterday and uh what a tremendous tremendous time it was uh I hate to say it but I'm going to those who didn't come you missed out it was it was a really good opportunity just to Fellowship we just had a quick fellowship and then we left and uh brother Toby and brother faren and families are still up there they went for the weekend but it would have been nice to stick around but it was just wonderful to to to fellowship with the Brethren and and to hear you know that we're all human there's nobody that's perfect in our midst and uh you know we all have struggles and the struggles that we have are are normal they're human struggles but many times they're just not talked about and I think that's the most amazing thing and uh for those people who did listen I put it out there on the men's chat I highly recommend listening to it it's probably going to be come a bit of a discussion for us as we go forwards uh with the men because you know if we're not willing to talk about the problems that we have in our lives then we're going to have situations where there's no Deliverance for the problems in our lives we're going to suffer alone and we're going to think that we're alone we're excluded the nobody else knows what our problems are nobody else knows what our struggles are but that's what the devil wants the devil wants to isolate us he wants to separate us he wants to divide us and then conquer us but if we won't do that if we won't allow him to do that if we'll make sure that he knows that we are united and that we're not afraid to call out a devil because an exposed Devil is a what it's a defeated devil but when we don't confess our faults one to another and pray for one another guess what's going to happen we're not going to be healed right we're going to just make room for the devil all over the place and we're not interested in giving him any room no room no more than what the Lord will allow and that's the only reason we have afflictions from the Devil is because the Lord allows it but he's also given us an overcoming power he's also given us his holy spirit the ability to overcome not to be defeated not to be slapped around his strength is made perfect and I think that's just a beautiful thing our strength is perfect in our weakness his strength is perfect in our weakness you know I just was thinking about this you know as I was studying this here his strength is made perfect and and the idea I'm going to get into this a little bit I'll probably get into it a lot more as we go forwards but the idea of progressive revelation how wonderful it is isn't it that once upon a time we we knew the word of God and and we had a whole bunch of loose ends in the word word of God there was things that weren't explained there was seals that were sealed up for many many generations thousands of years and there was a time where those seals were opened we know that we believe that we believe God sent a prophet that all seven seals are open there's some people that want to believe that six seals are open and I personally believe you have to struggle to believe that only six seals are open but hey the majority I think of the people who believe this message of the hour will say that all Seven Seals are open because the way the Scrolls were written the seven Seal closes all of them amen that's the last one you can't open and get to the first one without opening the seventh one it's the seventh one that opens all other six but his strength is made perfect and I can't help but think about this idea of progressive revelation and how you know 60 years ago the prophet was here standing on Earth saying there won't be two of us standing here at the same time it will either be him or it will be me there won't be two of us here and we know that God called The Prophet off the scene so we can say look you know we know that the Revelation has gone just a little bit further not further than the word that was got brought To Us by the prophet that's a perfect word but what happens is that word begins to perfect the people amen and if it doesn't there's something wrong and there's nothing wrong with the word there's nothing wrong with that word that was brought by the Vindicated Prophet what it is is distractions of the devil people trying to live under their own strength having a head knowledge about the word of God having a head knowledge about the message of the hour but not able to actually come to the knowledge of the truth entirely because if we come to the truth the knowledge of the truth entirely what happens is we come according to the word we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost when we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost he the spirit of Truth begins to live out and teach us how to live talking about this progressive revelation just thinking about the book of Ephesians we'll probably get into it a little bit later here but just how we have this idea of progressive revelation but yet sometimes you still hear people saying that you know the husbands they're supposed to just have their wives submit to them and that's what the word of God says and we know that it's been preached I heard it when I first time I heard this I was amazed because it's not with conditions the wives are supposed to submit to their husbands according to the word of God period but the husbands are supposed to love their wives according to the word of God exactly the way that Christ loved the church where he would give his entire life for his bride so where do we stand today as husbands and wives not just according to the word not just according to a tradition one one way maybe that was taught a few years ago that was maybe a little bit legalistic where we could just say submit and the woman would submit because everyone in a message Church would just do what they're they're doing and and we all behave the same way but where are we today according to this Progressive Revelations progressive revelation about the all the Seven Seals being open about all the mystery of God being finished that we understand there's an invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ I want to say there is indeed an invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ but that invisible Union causes a physical manifestation that is visible and it's not contrary to the word of God it's not contrary to the word of God it is not an invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ when she is one with him she lives her life according to the word of God the husband loves his wife at all costs and understands that he is responsible for all of it for the wife for her behavior for the house for the children all of it rests on his shoulders and we know that in the Garden of Eden God didn't come down and say hey Cain or Abel Where Art Thou he didn't come down and say Eve what's going on with your husband he came down and said Adam where are you because Adam the man is responsible for all of it so when our wives are acting up when our our situations are going a little bit arai it's not her brother where do we stand with the verse verses in Ephesians 5:21 according to Progressive Revelations not tradition don't look at tradition don't don't look at the theories of the past we know there was an age where it was all legalism maybe not all I should back up on that mostly legalism and people were taught that their behavior the way they acted was going to reflect their Revelation according to the word of God and and that's CA Catholicism it's tradition that Creeps in to the message and we know that that spirit will be around because the word of God says that it will creep into the brother bradam said it that it will creep into the framework of the Christian church that that lukewarm formal and powerlessness it will happen but the only reason it happens is because people are trying to do it on their own strength if we are willing to surrender ourselves to submit ourselves verse 21 of Ephesians chapter 5 submitting ourselves therefore one to another in the fear of God so long as we're willing to do that then all the rest of the verses can actually be activated but when we're willing to just simply say no I'm the Man submit to me or or or I'm the wife and and it's supposed to be this way or it's not going to work it's going to ground the effects of the word of God you know in uh my Psalms 37 verse 1 Psalms 37 verse1 a Psalm of David fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity don't be looking around this world for they shall soon be cut down like grass and wither as the green herb I just can't help but think that this just can bring so much consolation for us when we look around in this world and see how maybe other people have things easier naturally speaking in their lives maybe they have health maybe they have wealth maybe they've got just things seem to be fine with them there's never any problems in their life everything they set out to do just happens every we know the world says sometimes people just have What's called the mest touch everything that happens in their life is just so easy and Flowery from the outside but there's always stuff going on behind the scenes but those people Naturally Speaking they shall soon be cut down like grass and wither as the green herb verse three says trust in the Lord and do good just trust in in the Lord and do good don't don't worry about all of the other stuff we see going on in the world so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed once upon a time we would look at this scripture and say thou shalt dwell in the land we'll dwell in the promised land we can travel to the promised land we can travel to a place that we buy maybe a a piece of land and we'll be able to dwell in our land on Earth but as progress of Revelation takes over according to the message of the hour we're not looking at that land as being a natural place it's not a geographical location it is the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we shall dwell in the land and verily truly Thou shalt be fed that's what that word verily means truly Thou shalt be fed Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thine heart seek ye first the kingdom of God brothers and sisters in every single decision every single area every single action we know that the word of God says that we should do everything in word and deed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and if we can't do that then we should not do it right the prophet said that if you got any questions about anything just don't do it Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thine heart he will Way Beyond what we can imagine commit thy way unto the Lord why trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the Noonday rest in the Lord wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass here's what I want to get to about this fretting stuff that happens cease from anger if we're getting angry in our lives brothers and sisters that's contrary to the word of God the word says cease from anger and you might thinkk brother Barry who you talking to here I'm talking to me brother Barry cease from anger that's what I'm saying cease from anger stop getting mad about things in my life and forsake wrath forsake that idea that I'm going to deal with that situation yeah it's coming up man I'm going to I'm going to get after it I'm going to get it done we're going to have a conversation something's going to change because I'm angry about this that's not the word of God it says cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do evil now let's just clarify this evil anything contrary to the word of God is evil evil isn't taking a baseball bat and wrapping something really sharp around it and thinking you're going to go and solve problems right we're not talking about evil maybe even it can be as simple as speaking something that's contrary to the word of God there's good and there's evil remember we were talking about this a little while ago there is no such thing as a little white lie if it's a lie it's a big black stain on our lives there's good there's evil there's right there's wrong that that's it there's no gray areas and that's one of the things the devil has specialized in our days to try and make a a gray smear let's talk about it well you know I really said it this way and and it was only meant like that you know what we're either telling the truth or we're telling a lie flat out and as soon as we're telling a lie a little teeny one it could sound a little bit like something and maybe we can constru it I really meant it that way did you God knows how you meant it God knows exactly how you meant it if we have a lying spirit it's a spirit ask God to take it out of the way and he will to bring it to our remembrance to say Lord help me not lie and you know what every one of us how many in here has never told a lie none of us can put our hand up because how many of us were not born in sin come on raise your hand who wasn't born in sin shaped in iniquity every one of us born in sin shaped in iniquity we come into the world speaking lies I'll never forget my pastor saying it children you don't even have to give them the opportunity to learn how to lie they just know how that's because of the word of God it's because of the hybrid condition we have Cain's DNA inside of us I'm sorry that's why the prophet of God said to reject to resist the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives means you already have the mark of the beast you don't have to go and get a chip in your hand you don't have to get something in your forehead we had the prophet teach very clearly that that Mark in the hand is the action toward sin a and the thought in the forehead is what causes the hand to move that is the mark of the beast when we're acting out of our own will evildoers shall be cut off and they will be oh my but those that wait upon the Lord they shall inherit the earth those that wait upon the Lord are we waiting upon the Lord or are we quick to wrath quick I got a I got a hair trigger temper on me I got a buzza that's in my backpack just just you try me and see if that's how we are we're contrary to the word and all we need to do is line up with the word let's turn over to Acts chapter 9 Acts chapter n just want to talk a little bit about Paul before he was Paul he had a nature didn't he he had a nature nature that had to change he couldn't Remain the guy he was and be who God wanted him to be he didn't just have a name change did he and you know sometimes brother bradam says it I if we're just trying to live this message if we're just trying to be a Christian if we're just trying to live a good personal life we're an impersonator of Christianity we'll get into that quote later but Paul the Apostle for the age the very first church age the one who actually set the pattern for all other Church ages we've learned as we've been studying the exposition of the seven Church ages he says here in verse one of chapter n acts and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and desired him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem and we know that he wasn't he wasn't very good to these people he was breathing out Slaughter he was breathing out persecution for these people and as he journeyed verse three he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and what happened when that light sha round about him he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me it's just beautiful because the next verse he says Paul Saul speaking he said who art thou Lord he knew who he was who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks and he trembled and astonished said Lord What wilt thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into this city and it shall be told thee what thou must do and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man and Saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus and we know that he was there for three days he was there blind he didn't eat he probably had very little to drink he might not even have drank at all but here he sat wondering what what was going to happen to him what actually happened to him who really was it that he called lord who who is this Jesus whom he is persecuting he must have had all manner of thoughts and I just couldn't help but think you know what brothers and sisters when we truly hear that that voice for ourselves in our own lives when it's not someone else's experience that they're trying to thrust upon us what what it is is is it's a name changing voice it is a lifegiving voice it is that Pillar of Fire that brother bradam said I can see it now it's it's hovering over those people up in the balcony and I can see it it's moving around it's over that man over there in the back don't miss it now and he would start to call out all of the things going on in their lives the same thing as the woman at the well come and see a man who told me the things that I've done it was only the spirit of God but it was that same Pillar of Fire that came and met Saul on his way to persecute but that that Pillar of Fire wasn't there to actually harm him that Pillar of Fire was there to give him a new name to change his name but not just change his name to change his nature we know this man had a new birth experience right there and once he actually went into the city God worked on the other end just like he does now he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not going to work just on one end he always works on both ends he told the man ananas I've got this guy right where I want him and I want you to go pray for him now isn't it interesting because God could have just gone and done it he could have gone down he could have just picked up all the different elements like brother bradam talked about and just created a body and stepped into it and went right down there and actually did it but what did did he do he took someone who was in position someone who was praying someone was in in their position with the Lord who knew where he stood with the gospel and what did he do he used that individual to now go and pray for the other individual we heard about it yesterday sometimes we have experiences in our lives where we we we ourselves understand the situation but there's other times where other people have experiences in their lives and and the way those experiences are we just can't relate to them because we've never gone through those experiences but that other person they can relate with other people who have gone through those very same experiences and situations and those are the people that God will take and use to go and pray for other people to be able to reach the other people and that's exactly what happened here when he went into Damascus he thought he was going into persecute but he actually got a name change he got a nature change more than just a change and I think it's so beautiful because it was right there that he was able to understand that his strength is made perfect in his weakness I can't help but think our scripture this morning out of second Corinthians Paul was going right back to that moment where he was high on his horse wasn't he and God came around and sha that Pillar of Fire on him and showed you know what without me you're nothing he had to put him right to the ground to say look look up son look up and we know that he couldn't see anything after that it's interesting all of the different types that are in there but I just want to carry on a little bit and think that you know immediately Verse 18 immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forth with and arose and what he was baptized he was willing to take that word and apply it in his own life he understood what needed to happen at that point I just can't help but think that he already knew it too but he received the Holy Ghost when annias went and prayed for him he followed the word of the lord we know that an ananas must have been very much afraid to go in there to see this one who had been laying waste the Church of the Living God he he had Steven stoned he was the one that was just coming in to start destroying people taking prisoners back to Jerusalem and yet God called him to go and pray for this man we need to know exactly where we stand brothers and sisters when we go on our knees and we hear voice we need to make sure we know that it's the Lord Matthew chapter 7 you know we know I think it's beautiful that he was told ananas was told go arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul gave him the exact instructions didn't he it's just exactly out of Matthew chapter 7 enter ye in at the Straight Gate don't just go anywhere I want you to to go to the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction that is what this whole world is going towards it's a big wide gate you can get to heaven all these manner of ways all these different ways religions and and and peoples and ideas we know we serve a mighty God that's what this world is propagating but we know we had a prophet in our day that said no way there's only one truth there's only one life and that that that truth and that life who is our way he is the same yesterday today and forever and he's only exactly according to his word and that's what Satan hates but you know this man was told enter ye in at the Straight Gate get down there to that that street which is called straight and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for behold he prayeth it's beautiful he must have been praying saying I don't even know who I am anymore I don't even know what's going on what happened to me back there I got knocked off my high horse and I can't help but think brothers and sisters that is exactly the same way it is when we have a new birth experience we're not the same person something happens inside of us people around us will say who are you and what have you done with brother so and so it's not it's not a joke it's real the prophet said a real New Birth is messy it's not just a pleasant thing it's not just is something that we say it's it's not a big thing you know we know that verse 14 here of of Matthew chapter 7 it says because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth unto life and few there be that find it I want to say today if you can understand the message of the hour if you have the ability to hear the word that the spirit says to the church today you are one of those few you can sing that song I I I'm one of the few I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I I I know that not many people in this world will ever be able to understand this message let alone hear it and what is the percentage it's a percent of a percent out of 8 billion people in this world my we have the ability to just go on to eternal life whoa perfect strength by Perfect weakness 1961 just an amazing message by the way 122 brother batam says but God's side was weak and humble that's how God uses them that's God's opportunity that's God's way of getting to us when we're weak we get something then and I know myself I can speak plainly and and openly that many times I'll just be going along through life and maybe I'll start to go off on a little bit of a tangent I'll start to stray a little bit and God will just allow a little pressure to happen in brother Barry's life and that pressure comes around and immediately I start to consider my ways immediately I start to think Lord what what's going on what am I doing wrong what's what do you want you want to get my attention that's God's way it's God's way of getting to us when we're weak when we get something then this encourages of course because God's whole kingdom is built out of these kind of people isn't that beautiful then when you get to that kind of a way then you can you're you're in his kingdom I say Lord thank you for the persecutions thank you for the times you come and and allow me to go through something because it shows me that I'm in your kingdom he says the case is with us that we're not that we're too weak the cas is we're too strong we're just too strong that's all I love the way he goes even further with it he starts to talk about human nature here he says the thing of it is we're too stronge headed we're too stronge headed I I've done it this way my whole entire life there's nothing that you're ever going to tell me I I know all about the message of the hour there's nothing that you're ever going to say that's going to encourage me you know what we're living in a place where we're we're we're dealing with progressive revelation it's not about just staying back in 1964 or 1963 imagine if we just said no I just believe the message right up to 196 2 that's all none of the seals would be open for me it's Progressive it goes on and on he reveals himself on and on we know the prophet said that he's going to reveal himself to us throughout eternity we're going to only see parts of him in the beginning the case with us though is that we're just we're we're just a little too strong that's all the thing of it is we're too stronge headed that's right we're too strong in our head remember my strength is made perfect in weakness he says that's right we're too strong in our head we we know too much and when was there ever an age where we had so much information about the message of the hour God wants to get that out of us that's right we're too strong we're too strong to yield to him and I want to say today what the problem is from my perception is we're too strong to yield to a Ministry we get to the place where we say oh it's just brother so and so I know him I know his parents I know his lineage he's okay but I like this other minister over here or whatever that's what we do in our lives we're too strong we're too strong to yield to him we've got to yield ourselves got to think well now here I got sense enough to know you know I want to I want to talk a little bit about that how we can we can begin to have a little bit of a perception that way let's turn over to Philippians the book of Philippians is a wonderful book such an encouragement the book of Philippians Paul the messenger of the church age this was this is an example of maybe a little bit how he had a a personality change and I love the way he describes it here in in Chapter 3 of Philippians verse one says finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not Grievious but for you it is safe beware of dogs beware of evil workers Beware of the concision for we are the circumcision which worship God in spirit and re rejoice in Jesus Christ and have no confidence in the flesh and we know at that time there's a whole sect of people that were trying to say that unless we have the Covenant of Abraham in our flesh then then we're not Believers and he's preaching the New Covenant to him saying there's a new way you don't have to do it in your flesh you have to Humble your flesh and allow him to do it in your life he's already done it that's what he's preaching about here though I verse four though I might also have confidence in the the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I more circumcised the eighth day here he goes describing his life who he is this man Paul now with the name change not breathing out persecutions on the church circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of Hebrews as touching the law a Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church the church touching the righteousness which is the in the law blameless to all outwardly experience or appearance this man was perfect he had everything going for him he was a message believer he came from message parents he went to a message church he had everything absolutely correct but what does he go on to say here in verse 7 but what things were gained to me those things I counted lost for Christ because brothers and sisters you might say why are you talking about the message that way I want to say it this way the message was to bring people to Jesus Christ that's the purpose of the message the message isn't just to say that's the message that there's a messenger the message was to introduce the Bride of Jesus Christ to Christ because the church church nominal had drifted away through denomination we were going through all of that in the exposition of the seven Church ages from this time that Paul was here as the first CH Church a messenger it didn't take very long for them in Ephesus to drift away from the word we know that we've studied it already but whatever things were gained to me I counted those things for loss for Christ verse 8 yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but what I count them but dung all those things that he just listed off my my personal position in my family my tenure in the message all the goodness that I've done all of the learning that I've had all the degrees that are on my wall all that I think that I am in my person are Dum why is that because he was no longer Saul of Tarsus he was Paul the Apostle he was the one that God created before the foundation of the world to be in his position he counted all them but dung that I may win Christ my and we know that that is the the acronym you just made me think about it I made me think about it someone made me think about it I believe the Lord did we'll say it that way the acronym Faith you know that acronym forsaking all I take him I'm actually getting it wrong but this is this is what the Apostle did he he forsook everything in his life all of his teaching everything that he thought he was his own righteousness and being found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and you know brothers and sisters that is my prayer for every single one of us that we would know him in the power of his resurrection not just know him that he died on Calvary that we could have maybe a cross on the wall or or or some sort of an emblem or or or just something we're a part of that we would know that he is the same yesterday today and forever in our own lives and you know our children they need to see that the children in this congregation need to see a god with skin on they need to see that there is a living God but we need to know him Paul's saying that I may know him I just want to say read that and think your own name that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead that's what we have to do if we're going to attain to that resurrection that General Resurrection if that's going to happen verse 12 says not as though I had already attained we've never just arrived brothers and sisters as message Believers we're marching forward we're marching to Zion not as though I had already attained either we all already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Remember You don't have to take it down brother you can leave it up there remember that he became a prisoner of Christ Jesus that means that he had no control over what he was going to do amen that meant that he had a master that was going to tell him what he was going to do he became a prisoner of Jesus Christ verse 13 He says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended this is the Apostle of the age he counted himself as not making it I can't think myself as a Believer how we could ever think that we've made it we've never attained every single day as Paul said I Die daily we've got to Die daily if we can't die daily then there is a prideful Spirit trying to rise up inside of us and I want to say this I know we have pressures of life sometimes we don't get on our knees to pray uh let's be real sometimes we don't have the time sometimes we're tired sometimes the pressures of life sometimes we want to take a little time in prayer and we just can't because life is going to push us that's why we need to know that we've already prayed it's like that but let's be real we can't always pray we can't always Die daily we desire to do we desire to every day to see this old man die so that Christ could live Brethren I count myself not to have apprehended count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do this is I think the critical key this is the Nugget if I could impart anything to us today I want to put this out there and harp on this a little bit forgetting those things which are behind amen and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press towards the mark for the price of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus now I want to say brothers and sisters where do we stand with the book of Ephesians are we willing to say that I've had a new experience like Paul has I'm not going to attain I'm never going to be a perfect husband but I sure want to be I sure want to try to be I sure want to line up with this word of God according to the book of Ephesians I want to give of myself for my wife and my family just like Christ did for the church I don't want to just simply say get in line woman children you better obey if you get out of line you're going to get a switch I got a few trees on the property we could go and peel back a nice one maybe the size of my thumb just a nice green one that'll Flex a lot I don't do that but I'm just saying there's people that could just take it and mix it up and say yeah that's what he's talking about no we're not abusive we don't abuse our children the word of God says spare the rod you'll spoil the child if you try to take and mix psycholog ol with this word you're not going to get the right results but to think about the things in our lives as husbands and wives even as children even as children we can look at our parents and think about my parents I could think about my dad and think you know I don't like the way that he did this and I don't like the way that he did that and because he did or didn't I have hurt in my life now I can talk about my life I'm not going to slam my dad I love my dad he did the best he could with what he had he actually took me to church he actually showed me that there is a redeemer he showed me that there is a way a truth and a life and you know as a child it wasn't according to the message of the hour but what's that got to do with me it was exactly what I needed for the time that I got it because there came a time where that seed that was planted actually heard the word of God and I'll tell you what I had an exp experience like Saul I went to a boring regular Wednesday night service heard the pastor preach his heart that he'd been preparing he probably never knew that I was even coming but then something happened in that service and I can imagine nobody saw a pillar of fire nobody saw Sparks and lightning but I'll tell you what I said God if you're God then be God to me in my life it wasn't about anybody else it was my own selfish little moment but that moment turned into something because I became a new creature in Christ I no longer desired the things that I desired but what I was getting at is I could say my dad never brought me up in the message my dad did this my dad did that my dad did the other I'm so thankful that my dad taught me something real important he said you know what be accountable for your own actions blaming your problems on other people is a cheap excuse it's an excuse to behave poorly thank you Dad for teaching me that be accountable for your own action you know what we need to do brothers and sisters to be accountable for our own actions is what exactly Paul says here forget those things which are behind now if anybody had the desire to forget about the things which were behind it must have been Paul yeah persecuting the church his Brethren the people that are supposed to love him now how is he ever going to have the opportunity to go and share with them what happened on the road to Damascus they're not going to want to talk to them and we we know they didn't want to talk to him naturally speaking they wanted nothing to do with this guy because they were looking at the flesh but here we have the first Apostle the first church age messenger saying forget about all the things in the past so you know what the prophet said in the exposition of the seven Church ages he said he set the pattern for all other ages yeah you agree with me there say amen he set the pattern for every other age so brothers and sisters we've got no right dragging around a ball and chain saying I remember this hurt I remember this pain I remember what happened we're doing it wrong some might say well this is the prophet he's an apostle he's got a supernatural Edge he's got a supernatural ability to forget those things brother Barry you don't know my heart you don't know what I've gone through nope I don't but you don't know what I've gone through either and I could go through my life and say that it's this person's fault and that person's fault and the other person's issue and because of all the rest of it now it's this and it might be but what's that to you and we know that's what Jesus said what's that to you follow thou me we don't have any right to try and drag around ball and chain because if we if we were to do that we wouldn't have his spirit inside of us brothers and sisters Paul recognizing that he counts himself not having to apprehend it he did not apprehend it he didn't make it there but this one thing he does he forgets those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before amen now really where I want to go this morning and we still have a little bit of time praise the Lord let's do some marriage counseling as husbands and wives how many things are we remembering how many things are we remembering how many times has our husband stomped on our toes how many times has our wife made us bitter how many times have we gone through all of that are we dragging that stuff around now I'm preaching to me amen I'm preaching right here brothers and sisters this is where we live this is the life we have as children are parents they freaked out and and they they maybe put their fist through a wall maybe they kicked a door in maybe they slammed the door maybe they they treated mommy badly because they were mad whatever children we don't have the opportunity or occasion to now I don't have to serve the Lord because of the way my dad acts we need to get aligned with the word and we need to honor our father and our mother that's what the word of God says and it is without condition it doesn't matter what the parents have done to us and some parents have been very very bad parents very bad parents but that does still doesn't exclude us doesn't give us the license to misbehave according to the word of God because Paul said follow me as I follow Christ follow me as I follow Christ forgetting those things which are in the past I forget all those things I forget the things that I think my wife has done wrong to me it's not going to do any good for the situation and you know what I'm I'm real good at it I'll tell you honestly I'm real good at taking a moment in time and saying this little problem right here is this problem right here from the very first time I got married we had this s problem this situation and and take this little tiny thing and make it this thing it's not that's my nature pray for me I'm so thankful that I've got a wife that does she prays for me and you know what when that prayer goes through something happens and I'm able to just not look at that that that whole thing I can just look at that little thing and say you know what just forget it just forget those things and put them behind us because as husband and wife we want to press to rewards the Mark or the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus we don't want to stay here it's coming a Time brothers and sisters where we when we do this when when we do press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus long enough the Rapture is going to happen and we're not going to have to endure here in brother Barry harp we're not going to have to go to church we're not going to have prayer meetings we're not going to have any of the stuff that we contend with in our lives what we're going to have is perfect affection and a thousand years to express all of the joy that's in our hearts for all of the battles that we fought all the sleepless nights that we've had we're going to be able to just get that out of our system we're going to have a thousand years to do that amen I just think it's wonderful though to think how Paul the Apostle first he goes through and names out all of these different attributes that he has all these great things according to the world according to the church all of these these maybe stickers and badges and diplomas that he's earned and he's earned them but he counts them all as dung they don't mean nothing they don't mean nothing compared to that relationship that he has with the Lord Jesus Christ my but you know to think about all the things that he had to put behind him we have to do the same thing in our lives brothers and sisters he said follow me as I follow Christ and I'm forgetting all those things which are in the past the things that I can't change because they're going to only Bring Me Down they're going to make me think you know if we did that in our lives if we just wandered around and we just said my I did this wrong and man I did that wrong all the different things that we do wrong in our lives could you imagine if we had that list we know the devil has that list he has that list and he's not afraid to bring it and he's not afraid to start reading it out and and saying it to us in our minds and in our hearts and making us think about all the terrible things that we've done but I if we're willing to die out to ourselves and humble ourselves one to another in the fear of God he he will come around and lift us up he will give us a release from all of that garbage in our lives that selft talk is so terrible in our lives I just want to say it today let's press towards that Mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let's not live in the past you know if we're living in the past there's no way that we're ever going to have any future how can we have future living in the past many people will say well you can judge the You can predict the future by looking at the past and sure enough you can when you're talking about history but let's talk about the Church of the Living God like Christians out of perfect strength by Perfect weakness in 1961 brother bam he says God took Paul and made a slave out of him he took Paul and made a slave out of him bound him to himself and sent him to the Gentiles which he hated that wasn't God that hated him just to be clear it was Paul he didn't like the Gentiles says he hated them but you see he had to be loosed from his ecclesiastical power to be bound to the power of God and brothers and sisters I just think this is so important for us to just maybe examine a little bit just think about sometimes we can have maybe a little bit of a a message theological ecclesiastical power in our lives that we can become bound to we need to get rid of that and say the whole purpose of the message of the hour is so that we can get to Christ Jesus so that we can have that new birth experience like Paul where all the people that knew him before would say who is this guy how could he be this way to be bound to the power of God he had to be loose from his ecclesiastical power to be bound to the power of God he had to lose his strength and become weak and nothing in order to receive the strength of God to be bound to God to do what God would tell him to do brother Bram says that's what we have to do today that's what I need I I say that's what I need amen I I need that that's what every man needs is a loss of himself loss of his ability loss of what he is that he might have a complete yielding to the Holy Spirit and we know that if you're a child of God and you're running you will come you will come oh my we can listen to that message a man uh running from the presence of the Lord a man running from the presence of God will come he goes on to say that's what we have to do today that's what I need that's what every man needs is a loss of himself loss of ability loss of what he is that he might have a complete yielding to the Holy Spirit the housewife needs that the school boy needs that we take even our little children I think it's so beautiful we all need that he says it in such a way that it's Crystal Clear there's no just guessing about it and saying well that's maybe just the minister and maybe it's just the the deacons of the church and and maybe it's the trustees of the treasurer maybe it's just the the whoever no it's every single one of us we all need that dying out and when we get that dying out there is a life that comes forward sometimes maybe even as a child it can sound a little frightening I don't want to die maybe even as an adult it can be that way man I like who I am I could look myself in the mirror and say I'm ridiculously good-look I don't want to die man I've got everything going for me I've got H uh nice cars I got a nice house I got lots of nice clothes I got a beautiful wife everything's going for me I don't want to die we're not talking about dying in this flesh we're talking about dying in our spirit remember what I I said on Wednesday I think it's so good you know there's the soul and there's the spirit and the spirit is who we think we are our spirit is who we think we are and who the whole world World sees us as I'm this great guy my goodness aren't I good but then the Soul on the inside is who we really are and when we go and present ourselves as this really good guy really good girl we're movers and shakers and we can do all this and we've done all that and we've got all of the other stuff in our lives everything's going good you know what that's a sign that that Soul on the inside is a skunk there's something wrong on the inside there but you know the the spirit is who we think we are the soul is who we really are and there's only one way to get those two divided and that's the word of God that that that sword that word that's a sword a two-edged sharper than a two-edged sword that that divides the suer the the bones and the marrow that that goes even to the Discerning the heart of a man that that is what we need brothers and sisters and when we can get that then we can recognize that we haven't apprehended that what we're going to do is forget about all the stuff in the past and we're just going to press forwards we're just going to live an example in our lives to show the world around us that we truly believe this message of the hour this progressive revelation thing I think it's so beautiful how far along down the road are we really from when the prophet was here we're not going to progress into a new message don't get me wrong we're not going to progress into a new theology or a new teaching that's not going to happen the prophet when he was here he already said we've gone beyond the actual leoan Church age and I'm just ad living here I'm not saying that's an exact quote but he did say that we are now in the bride age amen so what age are we in are we in the leoan age or are we in the bride age I would personally say that we're in the bride age because that's what the prophet said how far along are we brothers and sisters now that the word is completely open how far along are we that that we understand that we're the Bride of Jesus Christ that all of the Bible is open that all of the loose ends are tied up now how far along down that road are we and how now is our lives reflecting that progressive revelation are we still groping in darkness in certain things in our lives as a husband as a wife as a child as a brother to a sister as a sister to a brother are we still behaving like nominal church members or are we behaving according to the word of God now remember brother Barry's preaching to himself sometimes when I'm preaching I'll feel like maybe I shouldn't say that but I know what that is I know exactly what that is that's time to say it progressive revelation brothers and sisters where are we at we can have all the Revelation in the world but are we dying out to ourselves have we died out to ourselves do we know that we truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's only one way that we're going to see The Rapture and that's to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and if we go through life resisting the baptism of the Holy Ghost we've got the mark of the beast it's one or the other remember it's truth or error it's black or white there's no middle ground there's no in between there's no many different ways to get to Christ there's only one way one truth and one life so why do we seem to struggle why are so many people tossed about why are so many Christians not able to overcome why does that happen it's because they're too busy trying to do it on their own just say what it is let's just be honest with it and just say we're too busy trying to do it on our own we're too busy trying to make it happen we need to die out to ourselves so that he can live but why do we seem to continually struggle it's it's our own will you know the overcoming power in this life is to overcome the devil and it's to overcome sin and it's to overcome death but that overcoming power is also to overcome ourselves because if we can't overcome ourselves then we can't overcome any of the other stuff all of that other stuff maybe not all of it maybe it'll just be one little speck of of the devil and and maybe one little tiny Speck of sin in our lives not much live a good clean Christian life but there's one thing remember one one thing to be guilty of the least is to be guilty of the whole remember Jesus talked about the story of the leaven I I'm into sour dough I think it's fun I love to build things and create things and and I especially love to bake things now I got into it because you can actually eat what you make it's pretty cool I've done lots of Woodworking and I haven't really tried eating the wood I don't think it would taste good but you know baking bread is fun and you use the sourdough starter which is the same as yeast natural yeast and you know when there's a little tiny bit of yeast in in that jar and you put food and water in that guess what happens that yeast comes to life and it just bubbles over it just builds and and there's a life in there and if you have any of that contaminant with new flour and new water it's just going to happen if you don't want that you can't have any at all yeast get in that flour and water and it's the same thing in our lives if we have one little speck of sin we're we're guilty of all of it that little speck of sin that's not dealt with is going to cause us to be corrupt individuals in other areas of our lives but the word is completely open to Deliver Us from that isn't that a beautiful thought that's why the prophet came to give us the overcoming power to give us the open book to actually be used by God to be the mouthpiece for God to speak through for the angel of the Lord to meet with him seven nights in a row and explain to him the truth of the message of the hour and what those seals are so that he could preach Deliverance to us so so that he could give us the entirety of the word in our lives so that we could overcome our own will and say just like Mary not not my will but let thy will be done because you know brothers and sisters there's only one way that we can ever do that and that's according to the Free Will that he's given us if if we're willing to do that one time that's all he needs one time for us to say truly if you're God then be God to me see God for me in my life I can see God in other people around I can see God in my parents I can see God in my spouse I can see God maybe in in in the pastor or the treasurer the deacons or the trustees and my brother my sister I can see God all around but I need God to be real to me if you ever do that just one time you will never be the same if you genuinely mean it you will never ever be the same what that is is dying out to your own will and and I'll say this you'll be dying out to your own personal complexes you'll be dying out to every single thing in your life because what you get is overcoming power you get Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever taking up a boat inside of you we can talk about Abram on the plains of mammory when he gets a name change when he saw three men coming towards the tent In the Heat of the day he was just relaxing waiting upon the promise that God had told him but we know brother brandom talked about just taking those those elements and blowing and a body and he stepped into and his two angels came down with him that went down to Sodom he doesn't do that anymore what he does is has a man and a woman come together in a union and they have a child and once that child reaches a certain age I'll call it of accountability whatever age that is it could be six years old it could be three years old it can be 50 years old it can be 70 years old brother bradam said he led a woman to Christ when she was 90 years old that's what the prophet or that's what the Angel told him when he was there on the other side right that woman that you didn't recognize she was a 20-year-old woman God will take and use any one of us at any time in our lives but he'll give us the ability to overcome this guy ourselves I should probably call the musicians we're close to 12 now but you know brothers and sisters if we can ever really humble ourselves to the word recognize that our own weakness is where he's made perfect am I just think it might be a little bit of a help to us because sometimes we can live our lives and present strong strength we're we're we're strong individuals and we've got a really good solid Constitution sure enough we do but sometimes it doesn't hurt to be weak sometimes it doesn't hurt to say that I'm not Invincible that I hurt in my heart that I hurt hurt in my spirit that I've got pain in my life and I don't know how to fix it sometimes it doesn't hurt to admit those things because when we're willing to be honest that's when he's going to come on the scene and help us but as long as we're busy doing it and being strong he's going to say okay when we can recognize our own weakness I'm not going to look for anyone to recognize and speak out your own weakness you know your own weakness you we know we know exactly what our weakness is is because if we have the desire to serve Christ and we have come all the way up to the promised land maybe we've even got our foot over into the promised land but then we get a little bit nervous and we step back a little bit and then maybe we try again and and and maybe we get a couple steps in but then it just gets a little bit scary because we know the Giants are there and they see us as grasshoppers according to what the people said not what God Said but we just come to that place where we're just not sure and we just can't go all the way you know what happens is we can become a little bit tainted we can become a little bit calloused in our walk and and it can become normal for us to just go in and out and in and out but I want to say today brothers and sisters if you've never taken and just marched right into that Promised Land do it with all your might try it with all your might and we're not talking about a geographical location we're talking about the true baptism of the Holy Spirit the the the Lord Jesus Christ taking up his Abode in ourselves we know the word says to submit yourselves one to another in the fear of God try it try and submit yourself one to another maybe there's a circumstance maybe there's a situation in your life where there's unforgiveness where there's something in our lives that we just can't seem to get over just submit yourself one to another in the fear of God in genuine humility and you know what brothers and sisters where it seems like there's a mountain where it seems like there's an an immovable object there is a situation that cannot be fixed ever on this side of Eternity we are dealing with a God that specializes in in Miracles he can do anything brothers and sisters there's nothing that he can't fix in our lives he's just waiting for us to genuinely submit ourselves unto him and say I'm willing to forget about all those things in the past and alls I want to do is reach forth unto those things which are before me I only want to see the power of God move in my life if you're willing to do that genuinely I promise you he will he will this book will become a new book maybe stand with me as we close today this message of the hour will become a brand new message of the hour I want to say today brothers and sisters true Revelation doesn't puff us up true Revelation humbles us we were talking about it on the weekend on the car ride there's nothing better than having a car ride with Believers when all you've got to do is talk and you know true Revelation doesn't puff us up the further that I go down this road in in the message of the hour in this Walk With Jesus Christ the more I recognize that there's nothing that I did I did nothing to deserve this he did it all he paid it all he actually slew the lamb before the foundation of the world before this world was even created he spoke our names into [Music] existence my 1957 why is it so many Christians find it so hard to live the Christian Life brother Brandon preached a message called that 1957 why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live the Christian life now he's talking about watches clocks that have Springs inside them Precision Instruments he says now it's the main spring that does it it's the holy spirit that does it it isn't your church that does it it isn't your pastor that does it it isn't your shouting that does it it isn't your speaking with tongues that does it it isn't your healing service that does it because a brother has a healing gift and people are continually blessed with healings at that church that's not what does it it's it's the holy spirit that does it God's holy spirit in the middle of your new spirit that's what does it it makes the whole church operate just exactly one big bundle of love that sounds kind of pie in the sky doesn't it but here we have the prophet the messenger for our age saying this oh don't we need it friends examine ourselves today and I love how he says it every time he takes it back to that and I just love to point it out examine it by the word see is your life ticking off just like that see everything love what's the fruit of it I'm a good husband I live according to Ephesians chapter 5 my wife is supposed to submit unto me yeah what's the fruit in our marriage what kind of fruit is hanging on our husband Tree is it Joy is it love is it peace is it patience is it longsuffering oh don't we need it friends examine ourselves today examine it by the word see is your life ticking off just like that see everything love what's the fruit of it how do you know it's keeping right time it's got love because we're talking about keeping time with the word love is out of Corinthians now vth not itself doesn't say I'm the king submit to me love vaunteth not itself it's not puffed up it's sociable it's sociable it loves to get together with the brothers and the sisters because that's what we're going to do for eternity it's sociable it's neighborly loving believing all things hoping all things love joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness patience Meek Faith All These Fine qualities is ticking out of that person's life when the holy spirit's in there ticking it around I love how he brings this he says it why people find it so hard to live a Christian Life why people find it so hard to live in that realm he says it it's the Holy Spirit now it wasn't by intellectual conception it's not by saying that I understand the message of the hour I know all the quotes there's nothing you can throw at me that I don't know it's not by intellectual conception that brings this forth and I think that is unfortunately the trick or the Trap it's the problem in and around this message that causes people to just be right there on the edge they're never able to come in all the way they're just so close because because it's intellectual conception it can't be that that's not what it's going to bring it forth it's by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that brings this and he says this if you're trying to live a Christian Life I'm going to say this myself if you're trying to live a message life you're only impersonating don't impersonate brothers and sisters get the Holy Ghost in your life and that's why this message was given so that we could get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ the person of Jesus Christ the thing that all the a throughout all the ages all the sages and Prophets and Angels desired to see we've got it and what is it it's Jesus Christ Living out through us let's just bow in prayer as we close Heavenly Father Lord help us not to impersonate Christianity help us Lord to go all the way into the true
