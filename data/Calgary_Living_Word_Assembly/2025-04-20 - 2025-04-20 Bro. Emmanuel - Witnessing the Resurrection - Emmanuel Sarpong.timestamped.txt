[17:37] two, oh counselor,

[18:55] us. Falling before your

[20:01] Oh, our hearts always hunger.
[20:08] [Music]
[20:13] Let's just bow for a word of prayer.
[20:17] Precious
[20:19] Lord, you are the one we hunger for.
[20:26] This is why we're here,
[20:29] Lord, to feed from that living word.
[20:32] Lord, we just thank you for that, oh
[20:36] God. And Lord, Paul says we need to give
[20:40] an offering of sacrifice and praise,
[20:43] Lord. Help us to continually remember
[20:46] that when we're in our downs
[20:51] and even our ups in life, Lord, just to
[20:54] continually offer that sacrifice of
[20:56] praise.
[20:58] Lord, we thank you, Lord,
[21:00] for the testimony of our brother Pete,
[21:03] Lord, as he's
[21:05] gone, Lord, to the other side. Lord, we
[21:08] just thank you, Lord, for the time,
[21:11] Lord, that they could uh the family
[21:13] could spend
[21:16] together in the Saskatoon area. We just
[21:19] pray that you'd bless them, oh
[21:21] God. We just thank you, Lord, for this
[21:25] morning, Lord, as fair weather, Lord. We
[21:28] just thank you, Lord, for the warmer
[21:30] weather rather than the winter and cold,
[21:32] Lord. We have to accept them all, Lord.
[21:34] But we just thank you for that.
[21:38] Just pray Lord that you'd give our
[21:41] brother MVIN Lord as he comes Lord to u
[21:46] sacrifice his gift Lord to give them a
[21:50] col off the altar Lord and and Lord to

[21:57] Lord we just thank you for all these
[22:00] things we just want to remember those
[22:03] that are in
[22:07] need of uh prayer.
[22:09] Lord, just thinking of my daughter
[22:14] Catherine with a cold and not feeling
[22:19] good. You are the healer, oh God.
[22:23] We just thank you, Lord, that you do all
[22:26] things well.
[22:28] We just thank you, Lord, for this
[22:30] morning. We just pray that you'd be with
[22:32] us as we go into the remainder of the
[22:35] service.
[22:36] We ask this in Jesus name. Amen.
[22:41] Amen. You may be seated.
[22:44] We sing our next song. In Christ alone,
[22:46] my hope is found. He is my light, my
[22:49] strength, my
[22:52] [Music]
[22:58] song. Christ the
[23:00] Lord with whom he is
[23:04] found. He is my Lord, my
[23:07] strength, my
[23:09] song. This
[23:12] [Music]
[23:15] cornerstone firm with the
[23:18] faces and strong.
[23:21] What heights of
[23:23] love, what depths of peace, when fears
[23:28] are still when striving
[23:32] cease, my
[23:35] comforter, my holy
[23:38] call. Here in the love of
[23:42] Christ, I stand.
[23:46] Christ
[23:48] alone took
[23:51] flesh, fullness of God in
[23:56] helplessness. This gift of
[23:59] love and
[24:02] righteousness formed by the ones he gave
[24:07] to save.
[24:09] On that
[24:11] cross as Jesus
[24:13] died, the wrath of God was
[24:19] satisfied for every
[24:22] sin on him was
[24:25] laid. Oh, here in the Christ I live.
[24:34] There in the
[24:35] ground his body
[24:39] lay light on my
[24:44] darkness. Then bursting for his glorious
[24:50] day. Oh up from the grave he rose again.
[24:57] And as he
[24:58] stands in
[25:01] victory, sets curses
[25:04] across his grip on
[25:07] me. For I am
[25:10] his and he is
[25:13] mine. Hold on with the precious
[25:16] blood of
[25:20] Christ. No guilt in life.
[25:24] No fear in
[25:26] death. Oh, this is the power of Christ
[25:31] in
[25:32] me was cry to find the
[25:38] breath. Jesus commands my destiny.
[25:44] No power of hell, no scheme of
[25:49] man can ever
[25:51] block me from his hand. Till he
[25:57] returns for
[26:00] close. Oh year in the crown of
[26:04] Christ I'll stand. No power in hell. No
[26:07] power in
[26:08] hell. No scheme of
[26:11] man can ever
[26:14] block me from his
[26:17] hand to thee
[26:21] return
[26:23] home. Oh here in the power of
[26:27] Christ I'll
[26:29] stand. Amen.
[26:32] Hallelujah. Amen. We worship you Lord.
[26:34] We thank you Lord Jesus for what you've
[26:37] done for us Lord. Amen. Let's all stand
[26:40] to our feet as we sing you are my all in
[26:42] all. Then we'll ask the deacons to come
[26:44] forward and take up the
[26:48] offering. For you are my strength when I
[26:52] am weak. You are the treasure that I

[30:02] Amen.
[30:04] Just have a few announcements before we
[30:06] go to prayer. Uh we actually have a
[30:09] praise report from sister kindness. She
[30:11] wants to ask asking us to join her in
[30:14] thanking the Lord for healing of her
[30:17] body after we had prayed for
[30:24] Amen. Amen. We have a prayer request
[30:27] here for sister Fumi. she is uh on her
[30:30] way to Ohio and she's traveling for work
[30:32] and she'll be back next week. So, we
[30:34] want to remember her in in prayer and
[30:36] remember all the saints that are
[30:37] traveling this weekend. Uh let's
[30:39] remember all them in prayer as well. We
[30:41] also have another prayer request here.
[30:44] Brother Op, uh his mom has passed away.
[30:48] He wrote, "I'm writing with a heavy
[30:50] heart to inform you that my dear mother
[30:52] has passed away today." This was the
[30:54] other day. She had been battling cancer
[30:56] for some time, beginning with breast
[30:58] cancer and undergoing chemotherapy.
[31:01] After leaving Canada last year, she was
[31:04] later diagnosed with cervical cancer
[31:06] despite multiple surgeries and much
[31:08] effort. It has pleased the Lord to call
[31:10] her home. Amen. While we walk and take
[31:14] comfort in knowing she is at rest, my
[31:16] family and I humbly ask for prayers of
[31:18] the church for strength, comfort, and
[31:20] peace during this difficult time. Amen.
[31:24] So let's just remember that as we go to
[31:28] prayer. Gracious heavenly father,
[31:32] Lord, once again, Father, we assemble in
[31:36] your name, Father. Hallelujah. With
[31:39] thanksgiving in our hearts, Father, for

[32:04] forward in your promises, Father.

[39:53] Amen. Beautiful. Thank you, sisters and
[39:56] children.
[40:03] The last few services, our pastor's been
[40:05] asking, you know, what does Easter mean
[40:07] to
[40:08] us? What does it mean to
[40:11] you? Earlier this week, I was driving in
[40:14] my car and this thought came on my mind
[40:15] and it developed into this poem, but
[40:17] it's called Higher than the
[40:21] Eagle. I watched an eagle fly today,
[40:24] soaring on wings of golden gray.
[40:28] He glided upon the wind so high,
[40:31] carefree,
[40:33] unbound, with regal pride. He seemed the
[40:37] freest heart in flight, yet he even he
[40:40] knows not my
[40:42] height. Though his wings may kiss the
[40:45] blue and ride the heaven's deepest blue,
[40:49] you he knows not what my soul feels when
[40:53] Jesus comes and breaks my seals.
[40:56] For I, a child redeemed by grace, am
[40:59] soaring beyond time's dwelling
[41:05] place. The eagle flies, though his
[41:08] wings The eagle flies, yet bound, he's
[41:11] still he's bound to nature's pool, to
[41:14] earth's own ground. But I have been
[41:16] loosed from sin's dark chain, from self,
[41:20] from flesh, from inward shame. No longer
[41:23] clothed in rags of pride, but robed in
[41:26] Christ beyond sanctified.
[41:29] No voice of guilt, no whisper sly, no
[41:34] fear beneath the serpent's lie can hold
[41:37] me from my place above. I've tasted
[41:40] perfect holy love. The law fulfilled,
[41:44] the curse undone. The war is over.
[41:48] Victory won. Free from the grave. Free
[41:51] from fear and night. All things now
[41:54] brought into the light. My thoughts
[41:57] confined, my steps made sure. My soul
[42:00] proved clean. My heart made pure. No
[42:04] veil remains. No shadow hides. The
[42:08] living word within me
[42:10] rides. Oh eagle, noble in your flight.
[42:14] You rise on wings of sheer delight. Yet
[42:18] you know not the liberty bestowed by
[42:21] Christ who dwells in me. I've been
[42:24] raised from dust and sod to reign as son
[42:28] a child of God. True freedom breeds
[42:31] where spirit dwells where living water
[42:34] breaks the wells. Not just to fly but to
[42:38] become one with the father spirit son.
[42:42] This is liberty the world cannot see.
[42:45] The holy blood that purchased me. So let
[42:49] me fly, but not alone. I mount the wings
[42:52] that lead me home beyond the eagle's
[42:55] elevated heights to where my savior and
[42:58] king awaits. This is my freedom, pure
[43:01] and true. Not just to fly, but to be
[43:04] made new. Lord bless you.
[43:07] [Applause]
[43:12] Thank you,
[43:13] brother. Sister Katherine and her group
[43:15] can come up. Then, Brother Faren and
[43:17] then Sister Dina come and sing for us.
[44:19] God bless you all.
[44:35] [Music]
[44:46] And then the stream of
[44:48] pilgrims made their way into
[44:53] Jerusalem to offer up the gold, the lamb
[44:57] and
[45:01] death. Atonement for their sin was made.
[45:06] only for a
[45:11] season. Their empty hearts still cried
[45:14] out for a lasting peace and
[45:18] love. And from Bethlehem he
[45:23] came. Remember was his
[45:27] name. He knew the world would need a
[45:31] sacrifice.
[45:36] and a million lambs could never
[45:44] pay. Once for
[45:47] all, he walked the road
[45:52] to carrying the sins of every upon his
[46:00] shoulders once and for all.
[46:05] coner death
[46:08] victorious, tearing down the
[46:12] separated wall.
[46:16] And the price was paid
[46:19] in once and for all.
[46:26] Then the stream of
[46:28] mercy falls like rain from heaven's holy
[46:32] throne.
[46:33] to everyone who calls upon his
[46:41] name. Though we all were
[46:44] sinners, he loved beyond our
[46:49] weaknesses. Though we were not
[46:52] worthy, he came to suffer in our place.
[46:57] as his but fell to the
[47:01] ground. Our hope again was
[47:05] found. No longer are we guilty and
[47:13] oppressed. For he is thorough sin as far
[47:17] as
[47:18] east from the
[47:22] west. Once and for
[47:25] all. He walked the road to
[47:29] Calvary, carrying the sins of every man
[47:35] upon his
[47:38] shoulders once and for
[47:41] all. He conquered death
[47:45] victoriously, tearing down the
[47:49] searing
[47:52] wall. And the price was paid in full
[47:57] once and for
[48:01] all. He walked the road to
[48:05] Calvary, carrying the sins of every man
[48:11] upon his shoulders.
[48:15] Once and for
[48:17] all he conquers
[48:21] victoriously, tearing down the
[48:25] searing
[48:28] wall. And the price was paid in full
[48:33] once and for
[48:36] all. And the price was paid
[48:40] in once and for all.

[49:56] Jesus paid it
[50:03] all. To him I owe.
[50:08] [Music]
[50:12] sin had left a crimson
[50:17] stain, but
[50:19] he
[50:21] washed me
[50:24] white as
[50:26] [Music]
[50:30] snow.
[50:32] Precious is the

[51:26] blood gives me strength from
[51:30] day to day.
[51:33] It will
[51:35] never never

[52:29] And in Christ
[52:33] alone my hope is
[52:38] found is my light, my
[52:42] [Laughter]
[52:43] strength, my song.
[52:47] This corner
[52:49] stone is this solid
[52:54] ground firm through the fences
[52:58] drought and
[53:01] st what heights of
[53:04] love. What deaths of
[53:08] peace when fears are
[53:12] tears when strivings cease.
[53:16] is my comforter. Who is it to you? Is my
[53:21] all in
[53:23] all here in the love of
[53:27] Christ I
[53:29] [Music]
[53:33] stand in Christ
[53:37] alone to come
[53:39] [Music]
[53:40] flesh fullness of God in hell.
[53:45] Last
[53:47] B. This gate of
[53:50] love and
[53:53] rightuousness scorned by the ones he
[53:58] came to save.
[54:01] Seal on that
[54:03] cross as Jesus
[54:06] died. The wrath of
[54:10] God was
[54:13] satisfied for every
[54:16] sin on him was
[54:20] laid. Now here in the death of
[54:23] Christ I believe.
[54:27] [Music]
[54:31] Where in the
[54:33] ground his body
[54:36] lay light of the world by
[54:41] darkness slain. Oh, then busting
[54:46] forth in glorious
[54:49] day up from the grave he
[54:53] rose
[54:55] again. And as he
[54:59] stands in
[55:01] victory since cause has
[55:05] lost its grip on me. Hallelujah. For I
[55:10] am
[55:11] his and is
[55:15] mine. But with the precious
[55:19] blood of
[55:24] Christ, no guilt in
[55:27] life, no fear in
[55:31] death. This is the power of
[55:34] Christ in me.
[55:38] From life's first
[55:40] crime to final
[55:43] breath, Jesus commands my
[55:47] death in me. So no power of hell.
[55:53] No scheme of
[55:55] man can ever
[55:58] block me from a
[56:02] stand till he
[56:05] returns to take me
[56:08] home. Here in the power of
[56:12] Christ I'll stand.
[56:15] And as he
[56:17] stands in
[56:20] victory, sins cast as
[56:23] lost its grip on
[56:26] me. For I am
[56:30] his and is
[56:32] [Music]
[56:33] mine. Hearing the death of
[56:38] Christ
[56:40] I. Oh, thank you Jesus. Amen.
[56:46] [Applause]
[57:04] God bless you all.
[57:59] [Music]
[58:05] [Music]
[58:12] And I think of all the Lord has done for
[58:19] me. Fully prevailed so I could walk in
[58:25] victory.
[58:29] I've touched the cross and felt the pain
[58:33] he
[58:36] bore. Forsaking all my life
[58:40] before I've set out for heaven
[58:44] sure to go with him all the way, never
[58:49] to return again to yesterday.
[58:57] I can't turn back on
[59:00] him. I turn away from
[59:04] sin. I walk with him every
[59:09] day. There's just no other
[59:12] way. While bridges behind me
[59:17] burn, pressing ahead will be my
[59:23] end. I reached the point of no
[59:30] return. Having put my hands to the plow,
[59:34] I won't look back.
[59:38] Nothing behind could ever match what I
[59:43] now
[59:44] [Music]
[59:46] have. The Savior now that I have come to
[59:53] know has everything I need to
[59:58] grow. To whom shall we
[1:00:02] go? Don't ever want aart. Yes, it's true
[1:00:07] that Jesus, he has won my
[1:00:13] heart. I can turn back on
[1:00:17] him. I turn away from
[1:00:21] sin. I'll walk with him every
[1:00:25] day. There's just no other
[1:00:29] way. While bridges behind me
[1:00:33] burn, pressing ahead will be my
[1:00:39] earn. I reach the point of no
[1:00:46] return. For rich or for
[1:00:49] poor, in sickness and in
[1:00:53] health, for better, for so I give you
[1:00:57] all myself.
[1:01:00] [Music]
[1:01:02] to heaven to
[1:01:04] hold, to cherish in my
[1:01:08] heart. A vow even that can ever
[1:01:15] fall. I can't turn back on
[1:01:19] him. I've turned away from
[1:01:23] sin. I walk with him every day.
[1:01:28] There's just no other
[1:01:30] way. While bridges behind me
[1:01:34] burn, pressing ahead will be
[1:01:40] my I've reached the point of no
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:48] return. I've reached a point of

[1:03:43] You live to
[1:03:46] die. Rejected and alone like a
[1:03:52] rose trampled on the
[1:03:56] ground. You took the

[1:07:48] Michelle, all the
[1:07:50] musicians. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:07:53] Isn't it good to have people willing to
[1:07:55] put their shoulder to the wheels anytime
[1:07:57] is needed? Such a blessing. Such a
[1:08:00] blessing to belong to
[1:08:02] this a body like that. Now, are you glad
[1:08:06] to be in his presence this morning?
[1:08:08] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:08:12] Everywhere in the Christian world,
[1:08:14] people are celebrating.
[1:08:17] And they are celebrating in different
[1:08:19] ways.
[1:08:21] Most are looking back to 2,000 years
[1:08:23] ago. But we wake up knowing that that
[1:08:27] was for us.
[1:08:29] Hallelujah. He had to face death. He has
[1:08:31] to face hell. He had to face the grave.
[1:08:34] Conquer it all and hand it over to the
[1:08:36] bride. Praise the name of the living
[1:08:39] God. Um um I would say let's let's have
[1:08:43] a seat for a moment or
[1:08:46] two. Happy
[1:08:51] Easter. All right. Actually, I didn't
[1:08:54] expect this turn out with so many people
[1:08:58] traveling. I didn't expect this might
[1:09:00] turn out, but the will of the Lord be
[1:09:02] done. Amen. I'm not saying my
[1:09:05] preparation is according to my
[1:09:06] expectation. No,
[1:09:09] but and so um for our visitors, we say
[1:09:13] welcome. We hope you feel at home. We're
[1:09:16] grateful that you chose
[1:09:18] to worship with us this resurrection
[1:09:21] morning. I see Joseph Charles and the
[1:09:25] family. God bless you.
[1:09:28] Amen. Sister Ne, I saw you here.
[1:09:34] I don't know if at this point we can say
[1:09:36] you're a
[1:09:38] visitor, right? Uh God bless you. Good
[1:09:42] to see you. We are all looking forward
[1:09:44] to the great day. I think the difference
[1:09:47] is that we we are not
[1:09:50] nervous.
[1:09:52] Amen. All right. So,
[1:09:55] um like it has already been announced,
[1:09:57] brother
[1:09:59] OP, let's bear him before the Lord.
[1:10:02] A word of encouragement goes a long way.
[1:10:06] And then let's remember him when we go
[1:10:08] on our knees. You are never ready to
[1:10:11] lose a mother. And especially for us to
[1:10:14] think that not just not long ago, she
[1:10:18] was here in our midst. And so please
[1:10:20] remember brother Ope, sister Kik and the
[1:10:23] family here and in
[1:10:25] Nigeria. Um let's continue to bear the
[1:10:28] classes before the Lord.
[1:10:31] God willing, they should be back this
[1:10:33] week. Remember, Brother Barry as well as
[1:10:36] sister Lisa, they are also expected in
[1:10:40] in in the week.
[1:10:43] [Music]
[1:10:46] Um, Brother Dan is home with a cold and
[1:10:50] so please remember him in prayer as
[1:10:52] well.
[1:10:54] And sister Ruth, I believe this is her
[1:10:59] last Sunday
[1:11:01] here and then she goes back
[1:11:05] to for her
[1:11:07] wedding in a week or two. And so please
[1:11:11] let's continue to bear her before the
[1:11:13] Lord that the Lord will be with her.
[1:11:18] Yeah, it's it's a big step.
[1:11:23] And so, um, as far as I can see, I think
[1:11:26] that is
[1:11:29] all. Praise the name of the
[1:11:32] Lord. Now, if you have any requests,
[1:11:34] please make it known with to the Lord
[1:11:36] with an uplifted hand. Let's bow down
[1:11:39] our hearts before
[1:11:41] him. Our dear Lord and King, our master
[1:11:44] and
[1:11:45] Savior, you are everything to us. And on
[1:11:49] this resurrection morning, Lord, we
[1:11:53] cannot fully comprehend the depth of
[1:11:56] love that led you to the cross and to
[1:12:00] the
[1:12:02] grave, but we sure are
[1:12:04] grateful for the life that you gave us.
[1:12:08] And so we come in humility. We come in
[1:12:11] in the simplicity of faith to say,
[1:12:14] "Thank you, Lord, for what you did for
[1:12:16] us."
[1:12:18] We come, oh Lord, to worship you. We
[1:12:20] come to praise you. We come to glorify
[1:12:23] your name. We come to thank you for the
[1:12:26] privilege of knowing
[1:12:29] you. More than a father, we gather as
[1:12:32] your
[1:12:34] bride and see you as our
[1:12:38] groom. Father, as we gather, we invite
[1:12:41] your presence here in our midst. We pray
[1:12:44] that you'll come and bless us. Lord, we
[1:12:46] have come, Father, as a people who are
[1:12:49] needy. We come as a people who want more
[1:12:52] of you. We come as a people who cannot
[1:12:55] make it without you. We come as a people
[1:12:58] who are wholly dependent on you. Yes,
[1:13:00] Father, our lives and the world gets in
[1:13:02] the way. But help us to get all of that
[1:13:05] out of the way and focus on you because
[1:13:08] you are our only life. Father, we adore
[1:13:11] you. We appreciate you so much. Oh God,
[1:13:14] let's put aside all the curse of life
[1:13:16] this morning, Lord, and worship you in
[1:13:19] spirit and in truth,
[1:13:22] Father. Father, we pray that you'll be
[1:13:24] with our visitors who are away traveling
[1:13:28] that you protect them wherever they are
[1:13:30] and that at your appointed time, you
[1:13:32] bring them all in safely. Father, we
[1:13:35] commit brother Paul and the entire class
[1:13:37] family into your hands. Lord, we know
[1:13:39] they would be
[1:13:42] here, but this is duty call. And so we
[1:13:47] pray that your presence will be with
[1:13:48] them. Thank you for how far you've
[1:13:50] brought them. And as they make their way
[1:13:52] here, Father, may your presence be with
[1:13:54] them again. May you continue to
[1:13:56] strengthen and console them, Lord. Only
[1:13:59] your Holy Spirit, oh Lord, is that
[1:14:02] comforter. And we ask, oh Lord, that
[1:14:05] you'll be present in the life of my
[1:14:07] brother Paul and the entire family. That
[1:14:10] you be present in the life of my brother
[1:14:11] Opie and the entire family. That you
[1:14:14] visit him in a special way. Oh Lord,
[1:14:17] bless him even as he he thinks of all
[1:14:20] the details that comes with these
[1:14:22] things. We know it's your word, but as
[1:14:25] mortals, it's not pleasant, Father. and
[1:14:28] we we desire more strength from you even
[1:14:31] as our brother goes forward and faces
[1:14:33] this. Oh precious savior, I pray that
[1:14:35] you be with brother Dana as well. Bless
[1:14:38] him, oh Lord. Touch his body, oh God.
[1:14:40] Restore his strength, oh God.
[1:14:43] Merciful
[1:14:45] father, it's time for our sister Ro to
[1:14:50] go. We pray that you'll be with her
[1:14:52] every step of the way.
[1:14:54] Let the oppressors never ever depart
[1:14:56] from her.
[1:14:58] Father bless her going and father when
[1:15:01] she comes back
[1:15:03] safely. We will not fail to thank you.
[1:15:06] Be with every detail in all the
[1:15:09] activities that will be done. Oh Lord,
[1:15:11] let your name be made
[1:15:14] manifest. Now at this point, Father, we
[1:15:17] gather here because we desire for you to
[1:15:19] speak to
[1:15:22] us. Father, you know me. Yes. Amen.
[1:15:28] You don't need these nose to speak to
[1:15:30] your
[1:15:31] children. And I need you just as much.
[1:15:35] So I pray, precious savior, that you
[1:15:38] visit us in your own way. That you take
[1:15:41] control of the entire service. That you
[1:15:44] manifest your presence once more among
[1:15:46] your children. That you confirm your
[1:15:48] word that you are that living God and
[1:15:50] you are alive today. We believe you. We
[1:15:54] are relying on you. We are believing you
[1:15:56] father have your way even as we do our
[1:15:59] best to surrender even that help us to
[1:16:01] surrender completely in Jesus Christ's
[1:16:04] name do we pray.
[1:16:08] Amen. All right. So
[1:16:11] the announcements are out of the way. If
[1:16:15] you have your Bibles with you please
[1:16:18] let's turn to Mark
[1:16:21] 16.
[1:16:22] Um
[1:16:33] today I don't expect this to be a very
[1:16:36] um regular Easter
[1:16:39] message but then again the will of the
[1:16:42] Lord be
[1:16:43] done. I'm reading from Mark 16. I'll be
[1:16:46] reading from
[1:16:53] 9 and I'll probably end on at 15.
[1:17:04] Mark
[1:17:15] 16:9. Now when Jesus was risen early,
[1:17:18] the first day of the week, he appeared
[1:17:22] first to Mary
[1:17:24] Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven
[1:17:26] devils. And she went and told them that
[1:17:31] had been with him, as they mourned and
[1:17:34] wept. And they, when they had heard that
[1:17:37] he was alive, and had been seen of her,
[1:17:40] believed
[1:17:41] not. After that he appeared in another
[1:17:44] form, unto two of them, as they walked,
[1:17:48] and went into the
[1:17:49] country. And they went and told it unto
[1:17:52] the residue, neither believed they
[1:17:56] them. Afterward he appeared unto the 11
[1:18:00] as they sat at meat and araided them
[1:18:03] with their unbelief and hardness of
[1:18:06] heart because they believed not them
[1:18:08] which had seen him after he was risen.
[1:18:13] And he said unto
[1:18:15] them, "Go ye into all the world and
[1:18:18] preach the gospel to every
[1:18:21] creature." May the Lord add his
[1:18:23] blessings to the reading of his word.
[1:18:25] You may be
[1:18:30] seated. So, God bless you all and thank
[1:18:34] you again for coming.
[1:18:38] Um, most people in the Christian world
[1:18:40] are commemorating
[1:18:45] uh the the resurrection this
[1:18:48] morning. And so I suppose that makes it
[1:18:51] a an important day, a great
[1:18:54] day. Now, if you're going by popular
[1:18:57] culture, we all know that Christmas is
[1:19:00] often
[1:19:02] times esteemed up and above
[1:19:06] Easter and probably up and above
[1:19:08] everything
[1:19:10] Christian and that is in big part
[1:19:14] because you know the pagan ceremony that
[1:19:17] preceded Christmas or that that from
[1:19:19] which Christmas came was a very popular
[1:19:22] one. But I also think that um with all
[1:19:26] the commercialization attached to
[1:19:28] it that is what made Christian Christmas
[1:19:32] so big.
[1:19:34] But in all in all I don't think there is
[1:19:36] anything greater than the resurrection.
[1:19:41] Because without the
[1:19:42] resurrection there is no Christianity.
[1:19:47] Paul puts it this way. He
[1:19:49] says if the Lord be not
[1:19:52] reason
[1:19:54] then our preaching be
[1:19:58] vain and our faith as well be vain.
[1:20:02] Praise the name of the
[1:20:04] Lord. And so without the
[1:20:08] resurrection, there is no
[1:20:10] Christianity. Now we all know that
[1:20:13] resurrection is not meant to be
[1:20:15] uh a day that we
[1:20:18] celebrate. The resurrection is not meant
[1:20:20] to
[1:20:21] be one
[1:20:24] occasion. It's not even meant to be some
[1:20:26] scripture that we read maybe once a
[1:20:28] week, once a month or once a year.
[1:20:32] Resurrection is meant to be a life for
[1:20:34] the believer.
[1:20:36] Praise the name of the living God. It's
[1:20:38] a reality to be lived by
[1:20:41] the believer. Amen.
[1:20:44] And so this is a call for us as
[1:20:49] believers to yield ourselves to
[1:20:52] surrender and let that life flow through
[1:20:55] us. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:20:57] You as you're sitting here are chosen to
[1:21:02] declare his life in yours. Praise the
[1:21:05] name of the Lord. So wherever you are at
[1:21:09] school, at home,
[1:21:11] wherever, this is the way it's supposed
[1:21:13] to be. And you say, "How do you do
[1:21:16] that?" You just let go. Praise the name
[1:21:19] of the Lord. and focus on him and live
[1:21:24] that life in the face of whatever
[1:21:27] adversity we
[1:21:28] face. You just focus on the Lord and
[1:21:33] surrender your life and manifest it.
[1:21:36] Show to the
[1:21:39] world that that life means more to you
[1:21:41] than everything else. Hallelujah.
[1:21:45] Let it be known to the world that even
[1:21:47] your joy does not depend in what
[1:21:50] material things you
[1:21:51] have. That your joy does not depend on
[1:21:54] whose attention you
[1:21:56] have. That your joy does not depend on
[1:21:59] your popularity, your fame, your
[1:22:01] political power or your position in
[1:22:04] society. That your
[1:22:07] joy it
[1:22:09] depends on the continuous manifestation
[1:22:12] of his life in you.
[1:22:15] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:22:18] So the Christian life is always
[1:22:19] witnessing the resurrection. Amen.
[1:22:22] Sharing the
[1:22:23] resurrection, manifesting the
[1:22:25] resurrection.
[1:22:27] Hallelujah. Now the scripture we we just
[1:22:30] read had a few
[1:22:34] um how would I put
[1:22:36] it? Themes so to speak. There are things
[1:22:39] in it that stand out to me.
[1:22:42] And the first thing and the most
[1:22:43] important thing I want us to note is
[1:22:46] that every person who witnessed the
[1:22:50] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:52] had a prior relationship with him.
[1:22:57] So Jesus came, lived his life, met a lot
[1:23:00] of people in public, but those that he
[1:23:04] revealed himself to after the
[1:23:06] resurrection, everyone had a prayer
[1:23:09] relationship with him.
[1:23:11] Now the second thing about
[1:23:13] it and it may not be the
[1:23:18] best is that
[1:23:22] everybody who was told first about the
[1:23:24] resurrection did not believe
[1:23:28] it. Everybody did not believe it. But
[1:23:32] here is where it gets good. Because they
[1:23:35] were chosen by him. Yes. He followed up
[1:23:38] and confirmed with his revelation.
[1:23:43] Praise the name of the living God.
[1:23:44] Because these were people who were
[1:23:46] chosen to serve a purpose. And if it's
[1:23:49] God's purpose, if it is already
[1:23:51] declared, nothing was going to change
[1:23:53] it.
[1:23:55] Hallelujah.
[1:23:56] And so these
[1:24:01] people in spite of their
[1:24:04] unbelief they were
[1:24:07] still encouraged in the in a sense and
[1:24:10] they were still led to that greater
[1:24:12] revelation of him as the resurrected
[1:24:15] Lord and Savior.
[1:24:17] So as I was
[1:24:20] saying, living for
[1:24:23] him, it's about witnessing
[1:24:28] and then manifesting it. Praise the name
[1:24:31] of the Lord.
[1:24:33] Now different people commemorate the day
[1:24:35] in different
[1:24:37] ways and almost everybody looks back to
[1:24:41] what happened some 2,000 years ago or a
[1:24:44] little over
[1:24:45] that. But you see when we look back we
[1:24:49] look back to look for the standard to
[1:24:52] confirm what we have
[1:24:54] today. Hallelujah. Amen. Because he is
[1:24:58] risen today. He's risen in our lives.
[1:25:03] He's risen in this age. Amen. But how do
[1:25:06] we know that is right? How do we know
[1:25:09] that is the Lord? The only way is to go
[1:25:12] back. The only way is to look back into
[1:25:14] the scripture. The only way is to
[1:25:16] cultivate that relationship. Amen. So
[1:25:20] that when we see him manifested again,
[1:25:24] we can identify it. Praise the name of
[1:25:27] the living God.
[1:25:29] And so you will see
[1:25:31] that there was
[1:25:34] Mary and he revealed himself to
[1:25:41] her. There was Thomas at some point he
[1:25:45] revealed himself to him. There were
[1:25:48] these two that we read of on the road to
[1:25:50] Emos. He revealed himself to them. And
[1:25:54] all of
[1:25:57] them their
[1:25:59] reaction was a bit like it would be in
[1:26:01] the
[1:26:02] world but just that out of love the Lord
[1:26:06] pursued further. Amen. But now they
[1:26:10] missed the blessing though because the
[1:26:13] greater
[1:26:14] blessing was God getting us to accept
[1:26:18] the word. Praise the name of the Lord
[1:26:21] without any confirmation. Amen. So now
[1:26:24] what is that? When you receive the word
[1:26:26] and you believe
[1:26:28] it without any confirmation, it's called
[1:26:31] faith. Praise the name of the Lord. Now
[1:26:36] I want to say this that there is
[1:26:37] absolutely nothing anybody has ever
[1:26:40] received from God or anybody will ever
[1:26:43] receive from God that is not a product
[1:26:45] of the word.
[1:26:48] And so when God calls us and throughout
[1:26:52] Bible every time he tries to deal with
[1:26:55] us at a
[1:26:56] level and that level is the level of
[1:27:00] faith and that level of faith is very
[1:27:03] different from the level of reason.
[1:27:06] Brother Abraham tells us
[1:27:08] that the Lord took our hearts and the
[1:27:12] devil took our mind. And so we operate
[1:27:15] at very different levels. Now because of
[1:27:18] our fallen nature, we are comfortable
[1:27:21] with the level of
[1:27:23] reason. But you see, at the level of
[1:27:26] reason, none of us is a match for the
[1:27:30] devil. It's just like this. If if if I
[1:27:34] go underwater, if I go under water, the
[1:27:37] sea, the river, whatever, and I want to
[1:27:40] contend with a
[1:27:43] fish, it will just be a matter of time
[1:27:45] before I come up gasping for
[1:27:48] air because that is not my environment.
[1:27:51] That is not for me. I may be big, I may
[1:27:54] be smart, I may be whatever. Even I may
[1:27:56] have an oxygen tank, it's still finite.
[1:27:58] It it'll it'll finish. And when it is
[1:28:01] done, I'll have to come up gasping for
[1:28:04] water. How about if I bring the fish on
[1:28:07] earth? Then it stands no chance. And
[1:28:11] this is what the Lord has sought to do
[1:28:13] with us to get us to operate at a level
[1:28:17] that drowns the devil.
[1:28:21] And that level is faith. That level is
[1:28:24] the simplicity of the word. Hallelujah.
[1:28:27] that there is this reason, that reason,
[1:28:29] the other reason, but it doesn't matter.
[1:28:32] This is what the word says.
[1:28:35] Praise the name of the Lord. And so when
[1:28:37] children of God get to that position,
[1:28:40] you are drowning the devil in your life.
[1:28:44] Hallelujah. Amen. And so anyway, we'll
[1:28:48] go
[1:28:48] along that everything about our
[1:28:51] Christian life is about
[1:28:54] sharing, recognizing the resurrection
[1:28:57] and manifesting it in our
[1:28:59] lives. Now, of
[1:29:02] course, it is the resurrection that also
[1:29:05] that quickens us into the newness of
[1:29:06] life.
[1:29:08] Now you understand that all the talk
[1:29:12] about
[1:29:13] resurrection, all the historical proof
[1:29:16] that we can bring and there is all the
[1:29:19] scientific proof that we can bring and
[1:29:20] there are many but all of them have no
[1:29:24] use if that revelation of that
[1:29:27] resurrection does not lead us into a
[1:29:30] position in
[1:29:31] Christ. If it does not lead us into a
[1:29:34] position where we are possessing our
[1:29:36] privileges as sons of God, if it does
[1:29:39] not lead your sister to your position as
[1:29:41] a daughter of
[1:29:43] God. So yes, we can talk of a a
[1:29:47] resurrection 2,000 years ago. And glory
[1:29:49] to
[1:29:50] God, but he's risen today.
[1:29:53] And you and I are called to declare it
[1:29:56] to the world that he's not dead. He's
[1:29:59] risen and he's alive in our hearts.
[1:30:02] Hallelujah. Now, if you've not had that
[1:30:05] experience, welcome
[1:30:08] aboard. It doesn't take much. It's not
[1:30:11] too difficult. And look at the people
[1:30:14] around you. You don't hate
[1:30:17] them. You don't think you are having too
[1:30:19] much fun and they are not having it.
[1:30:22] Hallelujah.
[1:30:24] I was talking to uh brother Frank in New
[1:30:26] York
[1:30:27] and we just this thing came up that most
[1:30:31] of the
[1:30:32] time when a person has an itchy rash on
[1:30:35] their
[1:30:38] skin when they scratch it feels good.
[1:30:42] When you're scratching it feels
[1:30:45] good. But you don't say, "Oh, it feels
[1:30:47] so good. Let the rush
[1:30:50] stay." No.
[1:30:53] You try to treat it. You try to do. But
[1:30:55] understand it once it's gone. Once your
[1:30:58] skin is smooth, it's not that fun
[1:31:00] anymore. Understanding the wholeness of
[1:31:03] life, what has been defined at fun is
[1:31:06] actually destructive to you.
[1:31:11] This is the real fun. This is the real
[1:31:14] life. Praise the name of the living God.
[1:31:19] Hallelujah.
[1:31:21] And so everything about the
[1:31:23] resurrection should be tied to awakening
[1:31:26] us into a god-given position. Otherwise,
[1:31:29] it is of no use. And so this is what I
[1:31:32] want to comment on in the next few
[1:31:35] moments. And um that is the reality of
[1:31:38] the resurrection today. And my topic is
[1:31:43] witnessing the
[1:31:44] resurrection. Witnessing the
[1:31:46] resurrection. Now, like I said, it it
[1:31:48] won't be a a regular Easter style
[1:31:51] message, and I'm hoping with the help of
[1:31:54] the Lord that uh I'll make it.
[1:31:58] Hallelujah.
[1:32:00] And so, now we want to
[1:32:04] understand why I say and is the truth
[1:32:08] that you and I are chosen to manifest
[1:32:11] the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. why
[1:32:14] he chose to reveal himself to us and
[1:32:17] what is the
[1:32:18] purpose. Hallelujah.
[1:32:21] Now there is a story in the Old
[1:32:23] Testament
[1:32:25] and this is where it gets a little
[1:32:28] strange because this story in the Old
[1:32:32] Testament is a story that every time I
[1:32:35] read the only thing I can think about is
[1:32:38] a
[1:32:39] resurrection. It's a story
[1:32:42] that looking at it does not seem to have
[1:32:44] anything to do with the resurrection but
[1:32:46] every time that's what comes to mind and
[1:32:49] that was what was on on my mind when I
[1:32:51] was asked. So I said, "Okay, let me get
[1:32:53] this out of the way." And so please bear
[1:32:56] with me as I I try to reference uh this
[1:33:00] this story. But then again, um I want to
[1:33:05] sort
[1:33:06] of, you know, it's it's it's a it's a
[1:33:09] thing that we've not really looked at in
[1:33:11] Sunday school. And so in a one room
[1:33:14] schoolhouse, bear with me as we try to
[1:33:17] um sort of give a background to it and
[1:33:21] then we go into the story and I I I'll
[1:33:23] try to be
[1:33:24] quick. Now Israel as a
[1:33:27] nation or Israel as the United
[1:33:32] Kingdom when they were together they had
[1:33:35] four
[1:33:36] kings. They had only four kings.
[1:33:40] Afterwards it all was split in two. And
[1:33:43] so as the United Kingdom, Israel had
[1:33:45] Saul as their first king, they had David
[1:33:48] the next, they had Solomon the next, and
[1:33:51] then they had Rohobam the son of David.
[1:33:54] So it is at the time of Rahobam that the
[1:33:56] kingdom was split into two. Now you
[1:33:59] would understand that Saul displeased
[1:34:01] the
[1:34:02] Lord. And then there was David who
[1:34:05] pleased the Lord so much that the Lord
[1:34:07] said, "This is a man after my own heart.
[1:34:10] And then there was Solomon who also
[1:34:12] pleased the Lord with his request to the
[1:34:14] Lord. However, at the end of Solomon's
[1:34:18] life and I I want fathers to listen
[1:34:22] carefully, Solomon married too many
[1:34:28] wives. Counting wives and concubines,
[1:34:30] Solomon had a
[1:34:33] thousand. And so at the end of his
[1:34:36] life,
[1:34:38] his foreign wives, specifically the
[1:34:41] Egyptian wife, led him to worship idols.
[1:34:46] And so a very glorious
[1:34:48] life ended up not displeasing the Lord.
[1:34:52] Now I want the fathers to listen
[1:34:53] carefully. Now Solomon did something
[1:34:56] wrong and there was a punishment for
[1:34:59] that. God pronounced punishment for
[1:35:01] that. Now watch what happens. God says,
[1:35:05] "Because of your father David, I've
[1:35:08] pronounced this punishment, but it's not
[1:35:10] coming on
[1:35:12] you." And then at the same
[1:35:15] time, the punishment that was pronounced
[1:35:17] on Solomon went on her
[1:35:20] son. Understand it, sister. You need to
[1:35:23] pray for your men. You need to pray for
[1:35:26] your sons. You need to pray for your
[1:35:28] husband. You need to pray for your
[1:35:30] fathers because if they succeed, you
[1:35:33] will succeed.
[1:35:35] Hallelujah. Now let let's understand it
[1:35:38] carefully
[1:35:40] that Solomon was the one who did it but
[1:35:44] it still came from above that because of
[1:35:48] my servant David I'll not split it in
[1:35:51] your
[1:35:52] day. So the actions of fathers have
[1:35:54] effects on children. Of course this is
[1:35:57] not about fatherhood. So let's keep
[1:36:01] going. Now in Rhobwam's day, the kingdom
[1:36:05] was split and for the sake still of
[1:36:09] David, a smaller part was left for
[1:36:12] Rahobam. Otherwise, nothing would have
[1:36:13] been left because when Saul displeased
[1:36:16] the Lord, the kingdom, entire kingdom
[1:36:18] was taken from him. But in this case,
[1:36:20] for the sake of
[1:36:22] David, a southern kingdom. So we have
[1:36:24] the northern kingdom of Israel and the
[1:36:27] southern kingdom a smaller kingdom
[1:36:29] called
[1:36:30] Judah. Now watch what are happening here
[1:36:33] because what I'm going to what we're
[1:36:34] going to read now at the point of what
[1:36:36] we're going to read uh the the the
[1:36:40] northern kingdom had a king called
[1:36:42] Ahab and Ahab the Bible calls him
[1:36:46] wicked. Now wickedness does not mean you
[1:36:49] are starving people or you are poisoning
[1:36:50] people or killing them. This just means
[1:36:52] you shall not seek God. A person knows
[1:36:56] the Lord but will not seek the Lord.
[1:36:58] Right? Is the the fool is on the other
[1:37:01] hand when scripturally saying it
[1:37:05] means there is no God.
[1:37:08] So the great scientists who deny God
[1:37:11] I'll leave it like that. But the Bible
[1:37:13] has an an opinion about
[1:37:19] those. And so through these times Ahab
[1:37:24] marries
[1:37:25] Jezebel. Now Jezebel was an idol
[1:37:28] worshipper and Jezebel came to Israel
[1:37:31] worshiping her idols. Now when Jezebel
[1:37:34] came to
[1:37:37] Israel, she sought to influence her
[1:37:40] husband the king and she succeeded and
[1:37:43] from that point on she started spreading
[1:37:46] her worship. So the cult of Bal was in
[1:37:51] uh introduced in Israel by
[1:37:53] Jezebel and then it started spreading
[1:37:56] and then it started taking roots and
[1:37:58] when it had spread and when it had taken
[1:38:01] roots then he turned on she turned on
[1:38:04] the Christian on the believers
[1:38:08] and then she started persecuting them
[1:38:10] and she started killing the prophets of
[1:38:12] God. Now in the course of time Jezebel
[1:38:16] has a daughter Athaliah and
[1:38:20] Athaliah was made to marry the king of
[1:38:23] Judah. So Aallayia got into Judah with
[1:38:26] her mother's playbook in hand. Aallayia
[1:38:30] got to
[1:38:31] Judah seeking influence over the
[1:38:35] husband also woriing idols also
[1:38:38] spreading idols. And so this story that
[1:38:42] I'm about to read in 2 Kings
[1:38:45] 11, all of this has happened and that is
[1:38:48] where where I want to base it. Uh the
[1:38:50] only other detail I want to say is
[1:38:52] that with the introduction of uh the
[1:38:57] worship of Bal in Israel and
[1:39:01] in in
[1:39:03] Judah. The Lord had vengeance
[1:39:09] coming and that vengeance came in three
[1:39:13] form.
[1:39:16] When Jezebel threatened Elijah, who was
[1:39:18] the prophet messenger of the day, and
[1:39:21] Elijah said, "Oh, I'm tired, Lord. Take
[1:39:23] me off the scene. I want to go." God
[1:39:27] said, "Anoint Jahu to be king over
[1:39:32] Israel. Anoint Hazel to be king over
[1:39:36] Syria. And anoint Elisha to be prophet
[1:39:39] in yourstead." That was God's vengeance.
[1:39:42] Now, you say, "How do you know?" The
[1:39:44] very next verse says it, the one who
[1:39:47] escapes the sword of Jahu shall not
[1:39:49] escape the sword of Hazel. The one who
[1:39:52] escapes the sword of Hazel shall not
[1:39:54] escape the sword of Elisha. So even
[1:39:58] Elisha was anointed with the vengeance
[1:40:00] of
[1:40:02] God. Of course, if you know the story,
[1:40:04] and I'm not going to go through it all,
[1:40:06] but by the time Jah was through with
[1:40:08] them, there wasn't any left for Elisha
[1:40:10] to kill.
[1:40:12] But that was the vengeance of God on
[1:40:14] them. Now the other side of it is that
[1:40:17] when uh these nations were getting
[1:40:21] together and they were getting close to
[1:40:24] begin with they are the same people who
[1:40:25] were divided but also because of the
[1:40:28] worship of B now they have gotten
[1:40:29] together and so the son
[1:40:34] because eventually um Atallayia lost the
[1:40:38] husband and then the son of
[1:40:43] Atallayia Haziah
[1:40:46] went to battle with the son, no together
[1:40:50] with the son of Jezebel, they went to
[1:40:51] attack Hazel and the king of Israel was
[1:40:56] wounded. And so once the king was
[1:40:59] wounded, Haziah was going to visit him.
[1:41:03] And so that made things easier for his
[1:41:05] uh Ju because he was already anointed
[1:41:08] and the anointing was in operation.
[1:41:12] Amen. And so he came and he started
[1:41:15] killing and he finished with the house
[1:41:18] of uh Ahab and he got the two kings as
[1:41:22] well. And so now you may
[1:41:25] say why this story on the resurrection
[1:41:28] then how does this play into it?
[1:41:32] How it place it is the sense
[1:41:34] that what we I'm talking about right now
[1:41:37] it seems to be something on one person
[1:41:40] maybe on one woman but understand it it
[1:41:44] comes up in the gentile times and so in
[1:41:47] revelation the Lord picks it up again
[1:41:50] but when he starts talking about Jezebel
[1:41:53] it's no longer to Israel it's with the
[1:41:56] churches
[1:41:58] in the church age the Lord mentions
[1:42:00] Jezebel and Why does he do that? Because
[1:42:02] that same spirit, like brother Abraham
[1:42:05] said, the Lord takes his man, but he
[1:42:07] doesn't take the spirit. And then he
[1:42:09] says, and in the same way, the devil
[1:42:11] takes his man, but doesn't take the
[1:42:12] spirit. And so, if you follow these
[1:42:14] things, you understand that Jezebel
[1:42:16] opposed
[1:42:18] um Elijah throughout the time that
[1:42:21] Elijah was on earth. Now, these people
[1:42:24] left the scene. But when the spirit of
[1:42:25] Elijah came back again and joined the
[1:42:28] Baptist, there again you have Jezebel's
[1:42:31] spirit in Herodius. And then God got her
[1:42:35] daughter to dance in front of the king.
[1:42:36] And the king says, "Oh, ask whatever you
[1:42:38] have." He said, "I want the prophet's
[1:42:39] head." And so the greatest prophet up to
[1:42:43] that point that ever lived, the head was
[1:42:46] cut off. Yes. That is how serious and
[1:42:49] how dangerous that spirit is. Praise the
[1:42:52] name of the living God. And so that is
[1:42:54] why I'm bringing this up just to give it
[1:42:56] some some context that that does not
[1:42:59] stop there. That spirit is here today.
[1:43:02] Hallelujah. So please let's read
[1:43:06] um 2 Kings 11.
[1:43:27] And so 2 Kings 11, I will start reading
[1:43:32] very quickly. And so I'm beginning from
[1:43:35] verse one. And when Ataliah the m the
[1:43:37] mother of Haziah saw that her son was
[1:43:40] dead, she arose and destroyed all the
[1:43:43] seed royale. But
[1:43:47] Jehosha, the daughter of King Joram,
[1:43:51] sister of Aziah, took Josh, the son of
[1:43:54] Isaiah, and stole him from among the
[1:43:56] king's sons, which were slain. And they
[1:43:59] hid him, even him and his nurse in the
[1:44:05] bed chamber from Atalia, so that he was
[1:44:09] not slain.
[1:44:11] And he he was with her hid in the house
[1:44:14] of the Lord six years. And Atallayia did
[1:44:17] reign over the land. That's the land of
[1:44:20] Judah. And the seventh year Jehoidah
[1:44:22] sent and now Jehoa was a priest. The
[1:44:26] writer sent and fed the rulers over
[1:44:28] hundreds with the captains and the guard
[1:44:31] and brought them to him into the house
[1:44:34] of the Lord and made a covenant with
[1:44:36] them and took an oath of them in the
[1:44:39] house of the Lord and showed them the
[1:44:41] king's
[1:44:42] son. Now I'll jump down to
[1:44:49] 12. And he brought forth the king's son
[1:44:52] and put a crown upon him and gave him
[1:44:55] the
[1:44:56] testimony. And they made him king and
[1:44:59] anointed him. And they clapped their
[1:45:02] hands and said, "God saved the king."
[1:45:05] And when Atalia heard the noise of the
[1:45:07] guard and of the people, she came to the
[1:45:10] people into the temple of the Lord. And
[1:45:14] when she looked, behold, the king stood
[1:45:17] by the pillar as the manora was. and the
[1:45:20] princes and the trumpeters by the king.
[1:45:22] And all the people of the land rejoiced
[1:45:24] and blew with trumpets. And Atallayia
[1:45:27] rent her clothes and cried treason,
[1:45:30] treason. But Jehoa the priest commanded
[1:45:33] the captains of the handress and the
[1:45:34] officers of the host and said unto them,
[1:45:36] have her forth without the rangers. And
[1:45:39] him that followth her, kill with the
[1:45:41] sword. For the priest has said, let her
[1:45:43] not be slain in the house of the Lord.
[1:45:46] And they lay hands on her. And she went
[1:45:49] by the way by the which the horses
[1:45:53] came into the king's house. And there
[1:45:56] was she slain. And Jeha made a covenant
[1:45:59] between the Lord and the king and the
[1:46:01] people that they should be the Lord's
[1:46:04] people between the king
[1:46:06] also and the people. And all the people
[1:46:10] of the land went into the house of Bal
[1:46:14] and break it down. His altars and his
[1:46:17] images break they in pieces thoroughly.
[1:46:20] And slew Martin the priest of Bal before
[1:46:22] the altars. And the priest appointed
[1:46:25] officers over the house of the Lord. And
[1:46:28] he took the rulers over hundreds and the
[1:46:31] captains and the guard and all the
[1:46:33] people of the land. And they brought
[1:46:35] down the king from the house of the Lord
[1:46:38] and came by the way of the gate of the
[1:46:41] god to the king's house. And he sat on
[1:46:43] the throne of the kings. And all the
[1:46:46] people of the land rejoiced, and the
[1:46:48] city was in quiet, and they still at a
[1:46:51] lion with a sword beside the king's
[1:46:53] house. Seven years old was
[1:46:57] Josh when he began to reign. Amen.
[1:47:06] And so
[1:47:08] um in the Titarian church age, brother
[1:47:11] Abraham states that Jezebel brought
[1:47:16] idolatry into Israel and killed every
[1:47:20] prophet she could get her hands
[1:47:22] on. And then he says, "So did the
[1:47:25] popes."
[1:47:27] You see him
[1:47:29] now addressing that
[1:47:32] spirit. He mentions
[1:47:35] Jezebel. He mentions her murderous
[1:47:38] intent and the things he did she did.
[1:47:40] And then he says so did the popes. And
[1:47:43] so this Jezebel
[1:47:46] system has always sought to stifle the
[1:47:49] operation of God in his
[1:47:51] people. and then it seeks to sort of cut
[1:47:54] off or stop the fulfilling of God's
[1:47:58] word. And so that is why it becomes
[1:48:03] interesting to consider this. Now I will
[1:48:07] go on to my first
[1:48:10] um my first
[1:48:15] quote and that is
[1:48:19] uh from the church aid titarian church
[1:48:22] aid. Brother Arab says it is most worth
[1:48:25] okay. All right. It is most worthy of of
[1:48:29] note that the very name titera means
[1:48:32] dominating female. Thus, this age is
[1:48:35] characterized by a dominant force. A
[1:48:38] force that ruthlessly invades all,
[1:48:41] conquers all, and despotically
[1:48:45] controls. Now, a dominating female is
[1:48:48] the greatest curse in the
[1:48:50] world. And so, he says that and much as
[1:48:54] it is applicable in the natural, the
[1:48:57] focus now is on that spirit and what it
[1:49:01] is doing in the gentile church. Praise
[1:49:04] the name of the Lord. Now brother within
[1:49:07] that same paragraph he goes down and he
[1:49:09] says from the garden of Eden onward
[1:49:13] woman has constantly and successfully
[1:49:14] tried to take control over the man. And
[1:49:18] right today it is a woman's world with
[1:49:20] the goddess of America being a naked
[1:49:24] female. And so if you follow do that
[1:49:27] line he goes on picks it up and actually
[1:49:30] identifies the spirit among the Gentiles
[1:49:32] today.
[1:49:34] Now the next one he says being a
[1:49:38] dominating female is
[1:49:40] antirist and the seeds of the Roman
[1:49:42] Catholic Church are in
[1:49:45] her. So he gets to the point where he
[1:49:48] completely identifies it. And so what am
[1:49:51] I saying? When you see a prophet
[1:49:55] blasting against
[1:49:58] makeup, how harmful is that? makeup.
[1:50:01] It's just to look pretty, that's all.
[1:50:04] But it's the spirit behind it. It's an
[1:50:07] indication of the spirit behind it. Just
[1:50:10] imagine if I stand here with a swast
[1:50:12] sticker. If I had a nazy flag on this
[1:50:15] church, how many people wouldn't be
[1:50:17] offended? But this is what is going on
[1:50:20] that if you are the
[1:50:21] Lord's, then you understand that your
[1:50:24] mortal body still belongs to the Lord.
[1:50:27] Hallelujah. Amen. And so this is what
[1:50:31] has happened. You see a prophet blasting
[1:50:34] against a woman in pants. You see a
[1:50:36] blasted a a a prophet blasting against
[1:50:38] the doineering spirit in the woman. You
[1:50:40] you see a prophet outlining the role of
[1:50:43] it's not
[1:50:44] hatred. No, that is an indication of
[1:50:48] something and that is what is speaking
[1:50:50] against. Praise the name of the living
[1:50:53] God.
[1:51:00] Let me go in a little bit. In the
[1:51:03] Sadistician church age, Abraham
[1:51:05] continued says that Jezebel of Satara
[1:51:08] was in no mood to give up her hold upon
[1:51:10] the people and thus we see her daughter
[1:51:13] Atallayia raised her head in the
[1:51:15] Sardisian age and with the hopes that
[1:51:19] she would be able to strangle the true
[1:51:21] seed by her schemes of organization.
[1:51:23] Amen. Now understand it that when the
[1:51:26] prophet starts talking about sadis and
[1:51:29] he's talking about titera he's talking
[1:51:31] about the church and the moment he's
[1:51:33] talking about church like very mentioned
[1:51:36] uh on Wednesday then it's with us
[1:51:38] Gentiles the moment he says church when
[1:51:40] he say church it could it could be
[1:51:43] synagogue or temple with the Jews here
[1:51:45] but the moment he says church it's with
[1:51:47] us and so that spirit that is just
[1:51:51] mentioned in the Bible like
[1:51:53] It's actually a spirit that the devil
[1:51:56] has used to oppose God over and over and
[1:52:00] now it's with us in this uh time.
[1:52:04] So now you'll observe that the moment
[1:52:08] Atala realized that
[1:52:11] her husband is dead and when she
[1:52:14] realized that her son the king is dead
[1:52:17] then the denominating female spirit was
[1:52:20] on full
[1:52:21] display like we we heard uh Wednesday
[1:52:24] said just a little pressure and the
[1:52:26] character will
[1:52:28] show. And so here she is, husband dead,
[1:52:32] son dead, and by this time she had had a
[1:52:35] lot of influence in Judah. They have
[1:52:37] built temples, they built uh images,
[1:52:41] everything. And so right away she
[1:52:44] started killing everybody who has a
[1:52:46] claim to the throne. And so understand
[1:52:49] it, if grandma is killing her own
[1:52:52] grandchildren just to hold on to power
[1:52:55] and push the people further into
[1:52:57] idolatry, understand it is more than
[1:53:00] human.
[1:53:02] Is the devil in operation?
[1:53:05] And what is he doing? He's seeking to
[1:53:07] stop the fulfillment of prophecy. Yes.
[1:53:11] Because you see underlying all of this
[1:53:13] is a prophecy from God. It's a a promise
[1:53:17] from God that you, David, there will not
[1:53:21] fail thee a
[1:53:23] man on the throne of of of Israel. And
[1:53:28] when the whole thing was split, Judah
[1:53:31] stayed with God. Judah, they stayed with
[1:53:34] Israel. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:53:40] I think in first kings 9:5, but I'm not
[1:53:43] going to
[1:53:44] read the Lord makes this promise and he
[1:53:47] makes it over and over with in talking
[1:53:49] with Solomon and on and on. There are a
[1:53:52] few places that he does that. But you
[1:53:56] see, destroys all these people and takes
[1:54:00] the throne. This is something unheard of
[1:54:02] in the history of Israel. In fact, in
[1:54:06] all of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah,
[1:54:09] there has been one female monarch, and
[1:54:11] that is Atalia, the only one. But now
[1:54:16] she destroyed
[1:54:21] everybody. Okay? She destroys everybody
[1:54:24] and takes a
[1:54:25] crown. And now she is in control. But
[1:54:30] understand how it feels for the people
[1:54:33] because first of all she's a woman so
[1:54:35] she's not a king. Yes, she's a monarch
[1:54:38] but she's not a king. The second she's
[1:54:41] not from the house of
[1:54:42] David. And third and most important of
[1:54:45] all, she's not even from
[1:54:47] Judah. She is the daughter of Ahab and
[1:54:52] Jezebel. So she's from
[1:54:53] Israel. And now she controls the
[1:54:56] kingdom.
[1:54:58] Now Judah had remained faithful
[1:55:02] believing that be remaining faithful to
[1:55:05] the Lord remaining faithful to the house
[1:55:08] of David was being faithful to Yahweh.
[1:55:11] That is how Judah felt and so they did
[1:55:14] every effort to remain faithful but now
[1:55:17] that has been cut off. They knew about
[1:55:19] the promise but now there's no heir.
[1:55:22] Apparently there is no heir to the
[1:55:24] throne from the house of David. It is
[1:55:27] believed that everybody and everyone has
[1:55:29] been
[1:55:31] killed. And this is what I say. You
[1:55:34] see faithfulness to David is not the
[1:55:37] same as faithfulness to
[1:55:38] Yahweh. And understand it most of us
[1:55:42] live our life sometimes say if I go to
[1:55:44] church every Sunday and I pay my tithe
[1:55:48] then I'm a believer. If I believe that
[1:55:50] God sent a prophet and I dress right,
[1:55:53] then I'm believer. If I believed in the
[1:55:56] tenders
[1:55:57] and whatever doctrine
[1:56:01] else, let's just face it, the message is
[1:56:04] more than a doctrine.
[1:56:06] This message is life.
[1:56:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:56:13] so the dominating female spirit sought
[1:56:17] to eliminate every semblance of God from
[1:56:23] Judah. Now Atallaya reigned for six
[1:56:27] years. But in these six years the
[1:56:30] rightful heir to the throne was
[1:56:33] alive. Hallelujah.
[1:56:37] When she when the king could not be
[1:56:39] found, when everything godly had been
[1:56:43] replaced,
[1:56:44] still the rightful heir to the throne
[1:56:47] was alive. A new temple was erected to
[1:56:51] bow. Images were erected to bow. Even
[1:56:55] the the Levites lost their role and
[1:56:58] their place in the house of God. But in
[1:57:01] all of this time, the king was alive.
[1:57:05] Praise the name of the living God.
[1:57:10] It was a time of great sadness for for
[1:57:12] the people who were
[1:57:14] loyal. And then seemingly when the the
[1:57:18] the dominating female spirit seemed to
[1:57:21] have complete control.
[1:57:24] That is when the king was revealed.
[1:57:26] Hallelujah. It was at that point that
[1:57:29] the king was revealed. In essence, yes,
[1:57:32] six years was long, but six years is not
[1:57:34] the end of everything. There was a
[1:57:36] seventh year. Hallelujah. And seventh
[1:57:39] years in the seventh year in Israel is
[1:57:41] the year of Jubilee. And so that is the
[1:57:44] year that everybody goes free. Now you
[1:57:47] will realize the story that we were
[1:57:48] talking about the uh the two disciples
[1:57:50] going on. It lasted for six hours and in
[1:57:54] all six hours they were sad about Jesus.
[1:57:59] But Jesus was with them.
[1:58:01] Hallelujah. And then but at the end of
[1:58:04] the sixth hour, in the seventh hour,
[1:58:07] Jesus was revealed to them. Praise the
[1:58:10] name of the Lord. Amen. Now, I'm going
[1:58:13] on to read this from the
[1:58:16] 10 10 virgins and 144,000 just to hit on
[1:58:21] the Jubilee year a little bit and then
[1:58:23] I'll keep going.
[1:58:26] And on the seventh year, there was a
[1:58:28] priest that sounded a trumpet. And if a
[1:58:31] man had been a slave, I don't care what
[1:58:33] his death was, he was free. Now, that's
[1:58:36] a type of the gospel trumpet. You might
[1:58:40] have served the devil all these years in
[1:58:42] chains with drinking and smoking and
[1:58:43] gambling and sin and dirty things. No
[1:58:46] matter what you have done, and when a
[1:58:48] prophet says, "No matter what you have
[1:58:50] done," he means no matter what you have
[1:58:52] done. Hallelujah.
[1:58:55] But when you hear the gospel trumpet
[1:58:57] sound, it's a sign that you can go free.
[1:59:00] You can go. Faith cometh by and then the
[1:59:04] congregation says hearing.
[1:59:07] Hearing of the word of God. Now you've
[1:59:10] heard that full gospel. So you don't
[1:59:12] have to say bound. Hallelujah. And so
[1:59:16] this is my message that we gather here
[1:59:19] today because we've heard a call. We
[1:59:22] gather here to get today because we
[1:59:24] heard the gospel trumpet and he's saying
[1:59:27] we can go free and so we don't have to
[1:59:29] live under any atallaya system. We don't
[1:59:32] have to live under any Jezebel spirit.
[1:59:34] We don't have to live under anything
[1:59:37] that
[1:59:39] betrays our faith. Amen. Praise the name
[1:59:42] of the living God.
[1:59:45] It may be acceptable out there but
[1:59:47] understand it. We are called onto a very
[1:59:51] higher level. Don't leave that high
[1:59:54] level call and come to reason and come
[1:59:56] to pleasing people and come to blending
[1:59:58] with people and come to seeking
[2:00:00] acceptance.
[2:00:03] If the Lord has accepted you, what else
[2:00:05] do you need? Hallelujah. And so, let's
[2:00:08] base our faith on the reality of of of
[2:00:12] what we have received. Amen.
[2:00:16] And so I'm focusing on the revelation of
[2:00:18] the king who was presumed dead but was
[2:00:22] alive. And the purpose is that what was
[2:00:25] keeping him was basically a
[2:00:28] system that kept him
[2:00:31] hidden. But you see it could not keep
[2:00:33] him hidden forever.
[2:00:36] Hallelujah.
[2:00:39] And so the
[2:00:40] revelation and what it cost is where I'm
[2:00:43] getting to now.
[2:00:46] In the revelation of Jesus Christ,
[2:00:47] Abraham says, "The importance of
[2:00:48] revelation by the spirit to a true
[2:00:50] believer can never be overemphasized."
[2:00:53] Amen. Revelation means more to you than
[2:00:55] perhaps you realize. Now, I'm not
[2:00:58] talking about this book of Revelation
[2:00:59] and you. I'm talking about all
[2:01:02] revelation. It is tremendously important
[2:01:05] to the church. Hallelujah.
[2:01:09] And so the first thing about this great
[2:01:12] revelation of the king and in verse four
[2:01:14] you can see that was that the people who
[2:01:18] saw him the people he revealed himself
[2:01:20] to were a people of his own
[2:01:23] chosen. Hallelujah. Not everybody was
[2:01:27] called and but the people who came were
[2:01:29] a people of his own choosing. And I I'm
[2:01:32] I'm believing that this sort of gets
[2:01:34] into this teaching on election that we
[2:01:37] are going through in this church that
[2:01:39] understanding that the Lord comes for
[2:01:41] his own. Amen. Hallelujah. Now, how
[2:01:44] would I know you are his own? Because he
[2:01:46] calls you by this message. Praise the
[2:01:49] name of the Lord. He calls you by the
[2:01:51] gospel. And when you respond is because
[2:01:54] you are his own.
[2:01:57] Did he say my sheep hear my voice? Amen.
[2:02:00] Praise the name of the living God.
[2:02:05] Now, in the same manner that
[2:02:07] Jesus that h the king revealed himself
[2:02:11] to people of his own chosen, you'll
[2:02:13] understand that Jesus on
[2:02:16] earth. He had great meetings. He
[2:02:20] preached to thousands. He fed thousands.
[2:02:24] He healed hundreds of people. Even his
[2:02:27] his his uh crucifixion was in front of
[2:02:31] thousands. But what happened when he
[2:02:34] rose? No more public
[2:02:36] gatherings. When he
[2:02:39] rose, there was no more public
[2:02:42] gatherings, no large meetings. I can go
[2:02:46] to the extent of saying that even the
[2:02:47] people he revealed himself
[2:02:50] to and those who saw and recognized him
[2:02:53] was by revelation. Amen. Amen.
[2:02:56] Hallelujah. There was no other way that
[2:02:58] anybody could see him except by
[2:03:01] revelation. Now understand it though
[2:03:03] that he spoke about it in John 14:19 and
[2:03:07] I'm going quickly. He
[2:03:10] said, "A little while and the world sees
[2:03:13] me no more, but ye shall see me."
[2:03:17] Hallelujah. His people, those who listen
[2:03:20] to him, those who believe him, he said,
[2:03:22] "Ye shall see me." Amen. And so he told
[2:03:25] them, I'll be with you even in you. So
[2:03:28] he was going beyond Emmanuel. Now he was
[2:03:31] going to become one with his own. And
[2:03:34] when you receive the word and when you
[2:03:36] feed on the word, what you are doing is
[2:03:38] becoming one with the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:03:43] Thank you.
[2:03:45] And so if we had
[2:03:47] believed then we wouldn't be asking
[2:03:50] these questions. we there wouldn't be
[2:03:53] any
[2:03:54] doubts but again that is human
[2:03:58] reaction and so I'm reading from Acts
[2:04:02] 10:39 and I'm sort of trying
[2:04:05] to get
[2:04:07] into like emphasize the point that he
[2:04:10] showed himself to people of his own
[2:04:12] chosen
[2:04:14] and we are witnesses of all things which
[2:04:16] he did both in the land of the Jews and
[2:04:18] in Jerusalem whom they slew and hang on
[2:04:21] a tree. So this is Peter at the house of
[2:04:24] Cornelius. I see him God raised up the
[2:04:27] third day and showed him
[2:04:30] openly not to all the people but unto
[2:04:34] witnesses chosen before God.
[2:04:38] Hallelujah.
[2:04:43] And then Peter says, even unto us who
[2:04:46] did eat and drink with him after he rose
[2:04:48] from the dead.
[2:04:51] But watch this. The the revelation also
[2:04:53] had a purpose because right after the
[2:04:56] revelation, it says, "And he commanded
[2:04:58] us to preach unto the people and testify
[2:05:02] that it is he which was ordained of God
[2:05:06] to be the judge of the quick and dead."
[2:05:10] Hallelujah.
[2:05:13] And so this is what is happening that
[2:05:16] Jesus reveals himself and he reveals
[2:05:19] himself to people of his own choosing.
[2:05:21] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:05:24] If you you check uh John 20 talks about
[2:05:27] Mary and the encounter and I won't be
[2:05:30] going there. I'll just mention it
[2:05:32] quickly. But in John 20, it talks about
[2:05:35] Mary and her encounter with Jesus. Now
[2:05:38] Mary was that person who was part of
[2:05:41] these women. The Bible says they they
[2:05:43] followed Jesus and they ministered unto
[2:05:46] him of their own
[2:05:48] substance. Mary was a person who
[2:05:50] received Jesus in her home. Three days
[2:05:54] earlier Mary was there when Jesus was
[2:05:57] crucified. She saw Jesus hang on the
[2:06:01] cross. But three days later she cannot
[2:06:05] even identify Jesus.
[2:06:08] She stood in front of Jesus and said,
[2:06:10] "If you are the gardener, show me where
[2:06:11] his body is. Where have you taken him?"
[2:06:15] She couldn't recognize him. What was
[2:06:17] happening? And that is another part that
[2:06:19] I want to just draw your attention that
[2:06:21] the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ in
[2:06:24] many ways is different from the life of
[2:06:26] Jesus Christ that we saw. Amen.
[2:06:30] And so, but you see, much as she had no
[2:06:34] strength to move the stone and she
[2:06:38] couldn't recognize Jesus, the search was
[2:06:40] still worth it. And that's what I'm
[2:06:42] saying. Your presence here is worth it.
[2:06:45] Every effort you put in to look for the
[2:06:47] Lord is worth it.
[2:06:50] Because yes, she didn't find Jesus the
[2:06:52] way she was expecting to find, but Jesus
[2:06:54] found her. Amen. Amen. She was lost and
[2:06:58] she was looking and she was expecting to
[2:07:00] see a dead Jesus Christ and then Jesus
[2:07:03] found her.
[2:07:04] Hallelujah. But watch this that Jesus
[2:07:07] had to call her by name and then she
[2:07:11] recognized Jesus.
[2:07:13] And that is the revelation.
[2:07:16] Praise the name of the Lord. Now we did
[2:07:18] reach m Mark Mark 16 and I just want to
[2:07:23] quickly look maybe verse 12. We that's
[2:07:26] what we read when we started. I just
[2:07:28] want to point to something very uh
[2:07:31] peculiar
[2:07:34] there. Yes, just the verse 12 quickly
[2:07:37] I'll read and then we keep going. But
[2:07:40] Mark 16:12, he says, "And after he
[2:07:43] appeared in another form unto two of
[2:07:46] them as they walked and went into the
[2:07:50] country." And so that is the key. That
[2:07:53] is why they did not recognize him
[2:07:55] because he had resurrected in another
[2:07:58] form. In another form and so in another
[2:08:02] form he joined them. Why? They were
[2:08:05] talking about him. Praise the name of
[2:08:08] the Lord. Amen.
[2:08:09] If if if we
[2:08:12] if we focus on the word, if we read a
[2:08:16] lot of the word and think a lot of the
[2:08:20] word, it will invariably affect our our
[2:08:23] our conversation. And whenever two
[2:08:26] people meet and they are talking about
[2:08:28] him, he comes there.
[2:08:31] Praise the name of the Lord. And so
[2:08:33] Cleopas and this person they are talking
[2:08:35] about him and then right there he joins
[2:08:38] them. But the Bible says he was in
[2:08:40] another form and for 6 hours he preached
[2:08:43] to
[2:08:44] them. And I'm just hoping you will catch
[2:08:46] something here that for because you see
[2:08:48] here is not for speculation but if the
[2:08:51] Lord speaks to me I believe he can speak
[2:08:53] to you too. Amen. In the six
[2:08:57] hours, the Bible says he talked to them
[2:09:00] with Moses and the prophets. Now, at
[2:09:04] that time, that was the entirety of the
[2:09:06] Bible. Their history, which was the
[2:09:08] books of the kings and and and Samuel
[2:09:10] had not been added. And then the Psalms
[2:09:13] and the rest were were h books. So, the
[2:09:17] Bible or the Torah for them was just the
[2:09:19] book of the prophets and the law. And
[2:09:20] the law was Moses. And so,
[2:09:24] a six-hour sermon. I hope you wouldn't
[2:09:27] be mad if we go a little over
[2:09:30] 12:00. Jesus did six hours. 6 hours
[2:09:33] sermon. He spoke to them.
[2:09:36] And so they were thinking, "Oh, he's
[2:09:38] gone. We were hoping this will be the
[2:09:40] one who will help us and deliver us from
[2:09:42] the Romans and all that." And he was
[2:09:44] right there and he was talking to them,
[2:09:47] but in another form. And so they did not
[2:09:49] recognize him. I told you from the
[2:09:52] beginning when we look back to the
[2:09:54] Bible, we look at what is in the Bible
[2:09:57] to confirm what we have today.
[2:10:00] And the simple question is, has the Lord
[2:10:02] been with us today? Has he been in
[2:10:05] another form and therefore people did
[2:10:07] not recognize him? And if we did, aren't
[2:10:11] we the called?
[2:10:13] If we did, aren't we the people who are
[2:10:15] supposed to go forth and show a living
[2:10:17] God to the world? Yes. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:10:21] Amen.
[2:10:23] You know, there was a time when John,
[2:10:25] please forgive me, this is
[2:10:27] Easter and the song service took a bit
[2:10:29] of time.
[2:10:32] So, please forgive me. I always try to
[2:10:36] to to be fast.
[2:10:42] John John the Baptist when he was in
[2:10:44] jail and heard about Jesus. He actually
[2:10:48] sent to ask
[2:10:50] Jesus, "Are you the one who is to
[2:10:53] come?" You know what he did? He didn't
[2:10:56] say, "Oh yeah, I am the one and look at
[2:10:58] me and what?" No, he made the people
[2:11:00] wait and see what happened. He says the
[2:11:02] lame walk. He said the blind see. He
[2:11:05] said the deaf hear. He said the poor
[2:11:07] have the gospel preached unto them. That
[2:11:09] was his identification.
[2:11:12] If he manifest himself in this age, what
[2:11:14] will be his identification? And in this
[2:11:17] ministry of Malachi 4, haven't we seen
[2:11:20] seen the death risen? Haven't we seen
[2:11:22] the death here and the blind see? And
[2:11:26] haven't we had the because we prayed to
[2:11:28] the poor.
[2:11:31] Praise the name of the Lord. He
[2:11:33] identifies himself by his deeds.
[2:11:37] Hallelujah.
[2:11:39] but in another form.
[2:11:43] That is why he'll be present and the
[2:11:46] world will not see him but you will see
[2:11:49] him. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:11:56] And so in Luke 24, it talks
[2:11:59] about the women going to tell the
[2:12:02] disciples and they thought it was idol
[2:12:06] talk. And then it talks about uh the two
[2:12:11] uh disciples going all the way to uh
[2:12:16] Embias. And then in the seventh hour, he
[2:12:20] breaks bread. And he does it the same
[2:12:23] way he did when he was feeding thousands
[2:12:25] because they saw it and they recognized
[2:12:27] him. And so you can be sure that if you
[2:12:30] knew him before, if you had a
[2:12:32] relationship before, you'll recognize
[2:12:35] him when he comes today. Hallelujah.
[2:12:37] Amen. And then he meets his disciples.
[2:12:41] And now that this is beautiful because
[2:12:43] they get all the way seven hours to get
[2:12:46] to Emmas, but as soon as they caught the
[2:12:49] revelation, they were like footed.
[2:12:51] Straight away they dashed back to
[2:12:52] Jerusalem. The revelation brought them
[2:12:54] from Emiles back to where they started.
[2:12:58] Now they went with a testimony in their
[2:13:00] hearts. The Lord is risen.
[2:13:02] And I'm hoping you leave here with the
[2:13:04] same that the Lord is risen today.
[2:13:07] Hallelujah. And so they go back there
[2:13:10] and these people are also talking about
[2:13:13] the same thing. So this is talking about
[2:13:15] the Lord is risen. This is talking about
[2:13:17] the Lord is risen. As soon as they met,
[2:13:19] the Lord manifest himself.
[2:13:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the beauty
[2:13:25] of it is he rebuked them for not
[2:13:28] believing.
[2:13:30] Like I said, he still wants them to
[2:13:32] operate at the level of faith, not
[2:13:35] reason.
[2:13:36] Reason is good. It helps us in this
[2:13:38] life, but in his worship, he desires
[2:13:41] that we operate at the level of faith.
[2:13:45] Because what you can get in faith is way
[2:13:48] past what you get in in in in reason.
[2:13:52] But remember that scratching thing,
[2:13:54] that's what is keeping us. Oh, it's fun.
[2:13:56] Oh, it's good. Oh, so if I do this, it
[2:13:58] means I'm not going to have fun again.
[2:14:00] And then we stay within reason.
[2:14:03] And then you look at people, they'll
[2:14:04] think I'm crazy. So what?
[2:14:08] Especially if you're a sister, people
[2:14:10] are already questioning why you are
[2:14:11] always in scared
[2:14:13] and not doing the things that other
[2:14:16] people do already. You might as well
[2:14:18] embrace it all.
[2:14:21] Hallelujah.
[2:14:26] And so just as he
[2:14:28] appeared to people of his own
[2:14:31] choosing back then, he has appeared
[2:14:34] again this day. Hallelujah. And again to
[2:14:38] people of his own
[2:14:39] choosing. It says, "How are we supposed
[2:14:42] to know
[2:14:43] that he appears according to his word?"
[2:14:47] He told us, "The Lord himself shall
[2:14:49] descend with a shout. Yes.
[2:14:54] And so if we have the message today, we
[2:14:56] can say he's here.
[2:14:59] Hallelujah. So always let's go back to
[2:15:02] the Bible. Not to celebrate it there,
[2:15:05] but use this as the standard to assess
[2:15:08] what we have today.
[2:15:10] Hallelujah.
[2:15:13] Now I just want to quickly look at
[2:15:15] Matthew. No, no, I don't. I I won't look
[2:15:18] at it. Matthews
[2:15:21] 11:27 the Bible says no one
[2:15:24] knows the father but the
[2:15:27] son. No one knows the son but the father
[2:15:29] and no one knows the father but by the
[2:15:31] son and those to whom the son will
[2:15:35] reveal. So any revelation of the godhead
[2:15:38] comes from God himself
[2:15:41] and outside of Jesus Christ you have
[2:15:43] even no knowledge of the godhead. Amen.
[2:15:47] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:15:51] Let's read this. Uh in the trial
[2:16:04] 1964 if you could. Okay, I'll just keep
[2:16:06] reading. Brother says, "Here sits a man
[2:16:09] sitting right here, his head down
[2:16:10] crying, praying for himself and also for
[2:16:13] his wife. She isn't
[2:16:16] here. She's not with you this afternoon.
[2:16:19] She's suffering. You think God could
[2:16:21] tell me what her trouble is and her not
[2:16:24] here? You believe it. You do. I'm a
[2:16:27] stranger to you. Is that right? Your
[2:16:29] wife has female trouble. If that's
[2:16:32] right, raise up your hand. Hi. So they
[2:16:34] will see it. And your name is Mr. Smith.
[2:16:37] Do you believe that God will make her
[2:16:39] well? If that's right, wave your hand up
[2:16:41] and down like this. Then brother Abraham
[2:16:44] says,"I challenge you to believe that
[2:16:46] Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of
[2:16:49] son of man in human flesh through the
[2:16:52] bride's body."
[2:16:54] Hallelujah. But now when he says that
[2:16:56] then he says accept his call.
[2:17:00] The revelation is always a call to
[2:17:02] witness.
[2:17:04] Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:17:06] Yes. And that's why thinking about it, I
[2:17:08] chose that that that title, witnessing
[2:17:10] the resurrection, because I feel like
[2:17:13] not witnessing as an as a passive
[2:17:16] observer, but witnessing as a part of
[2:17:20] that resurrection and witnessing as an
[2:17:23] active person who has been impacted by
[2:17:25] it and witnessing as you becoming a
[2:17:28] witness of what you have observed,
[2:17:30] living it out. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:17:34] Amen.
[2:17:36] Let me go on to this next one. And yes,
[2:17:38] it's long, but I'll read it nonetheless.
[2:17:47] Now, I want you to know this. I want you
[2:17:50] to know this is you. You and you that
[2:17:53] listen to this tape, you might thought
[2:17:56] today that I was trying to say that
[2:17:58] about myself being that I was packing
[2:18:01] this message. So he was the one bringing
[2:18:03] the message down. It says I have no more
[2:18:05] to do with it than nothing. No more than
[2:18:08] a
[2:18:09] voice. Praise the name of the Lord. And
[2:18:12] my voice even against my better
[2:18:13] judgment. I wanted to be a trapper. But
[2:18:16] it's the will of my father that I
[2:18:19] declare to do and determined to do. I
[2:18:22] wasn't the one that appeared down on the
[2:18:23] river. I was only standing there when he
[2:18:26] appeared. Amen.
[2:18:28] So now he's putting the differences
[2:18:30] between himself and the Lord Jesus
[2:18:32] Christ. But yes, he did appear and we
[2:18:35] can't deny it.
[2:18:37] See, I'm not the one that performed
[2:18:39] these things and forells these things
[2:18:41] that happen as perfect they are. I'm
[2:18:44] only one that's near when he does. I was
[2:18:47] only a voice that he used to say it.
[2:18:52] Hallelujah. It wasn't what I
[2:18:55] knew. is what I surrendered myself to
[2:18:58] that he spoke through. It isn't me. It
[2:19:01] wasn't the seventh angel. Oh, no. It was
[2:19:03] the manifestation of the son of man. And
[2:19:07] I just want to pause here and say when
[2:19:08] you hear son of man, it means prophet.
[2:19:10] But usually when he says the son of man
[2:19:13] is a reference to the prophetic ministry
[2:19:14] of Jesus Christ because Jesus has the
[2:19:17] three sonship position, right? Son of
[2:19:20] God, that's the Holy Spirit in us. Son
[2:19:22] of man, that's prophetic ministry. and
[2:19:24] son of David which will be in the
[2:19:25] millennium when he reigns as a king. It
[2:19:28] wasn't the angel his message. It was the
[2:19:30] mystery that God unfolded. It's not a
[2:19:32] man. It's
[2:19:37] God. I I I will keep going. All right.
[2:19:41] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[2:19:45] And so these people who came to receive
[2:19:47] that revelation were people of his own
[2:19:49] chosen. But first they were also
[2:19:52] committed to it. They were completely
[2:19:53] sold out because when they came they
[2:19:56] took a vow. So the word goes first
[2:19:58] before the revelation, right? They took
[2:20:01] a vow from them and then they make a
[2:20:03] covenant and then after that he was
[2:20:06] revealed to them. Praise the name of the
[2:20:08] Lord because you know in a in in a sense
[2:20:13] oh the word always comes and then the
[2:20:17] revelation.
[2:20:19] God gives the revelation to your heart
[2:20:21] but it must always be confirmed by the
[2:20:23] word. Hallelujah. No matter how good
[2:20:27] your revelation is, no matter how many
[2:20:29] people accept it, no matter the heavens
[2:20:32] open then whatever happened, you check
[2:20:35] it with the word. Amen. Praise the name
[2:20:38] of the Lord.
[2:20:41] And so the first effect of the
[2:20:42] revelation, and I'm I'm
[2:20:44] I'm going quick now. The first effect of
[2:20:48] of the revelation was that they took
[2:20:50] their rightful position. Hallelujah.
[2:20:53] Hallelujah. In verse 11, when they
[2:20:56] recognized that the king was in his
[2:20:58] rightful position because the king came,
[2:21:01] they placed the crown on him, they give
[2:21:03] him the testament and he stands where
[2:21:06] kings stand. And so when they see that,
[2:21:09] they also took their positions around
[2:21:11] him. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Now if you
[2:21:15] know anything about divine order, you
[2:21:16] understand that any time that there is
[2:21:20] the there is divine order in place, God
[2:21:23] descends to confirm it. Hallelujah.
[2:21:27] That is why we all have to have our
[2:21:29] positions. Hallelujah.
[2:21:33] I always say I could be uh the rocket
[2:21:37] scientist. Maybe I'm going to the moon
[2:21:41] and my wife is a high school
[2:21:46] dropout. The Lord gave her to me as an
[2:21:49] helpmate. Amen. Praise the name of the
[2:21:52] Lord. And when I ignore her, oh, she
[2:21:55] doesn't understand the things we are
[2:21:56] talking and I ignore her and I go for
[2:21:58] it. I am missing out big time. First of
[2:22:01] all, I'm rejecting God's help for me.
[2:22:05] I'm not recognizing. and I'm not
[2:22:07] grateful for that help that God has
[2:22:08] given me. And so understand it, take
[2:22:12] your position, recognize other people's
[2:22:14] position, and let everybody be in their
[2:22:17] position. Because when there's divine
[2:22:19] order at home, God visits. When divine
[2:22:23] order at church, God visits.
[2:22:26] Sister, be in. Listen, share his vision.
[2:22:30] Support that vision.
[2:22:34] Don't try to prove, oh yeah, uh, I'm
[2:22:36] wiser, I'm smarter, or I make more
[2:22:39] money. What is that?
[2:22:42] Your position you have is a role. It's
[2:22:44] not a hierarchy. Amen. It's a role. And
[2:22:47] go, listen, I always say this way that
[2:22:50] no matter what I do, I can never have a
[2:22:52] baby in me. I don't know how it feels.
[2:22:57] So, it's a rule. It's not a hierarchy.
[2:22:59] Yes, the world has turned it into that.
[2:23:02] But let's stick in our positions.
[2:23:04] Children, pray for your family.
[2:23:08] Hallelujah.
[2:23:10] Pray for your parents. There's no way
[2:23:11] that it says only fathers can pray. No,
[2:23:14] you when you are a child, at the very
[2:23:17] least, when you obey your parents, yes,
[2:23:21] parents may be pleased, but at the very
[2:23:24] least, the Lord is pleased. Amen. He
[2:23:26] says, "Obey your parents in the Lord,
[2:23:28] but it's pleasing to him." And so, let's
[2:23:31] get this divine order in place. Let's
[2:23:33] experience him a little more. Amen.
[2:23:36] There is so many of the privilege that
[2:23:38] we just let by just because we want to
[2:23:40] keep scratching this
[2:23:44] rush. Can we get over it? Can we clear
[2:23:46] it? Can we approve it completely and
[2:23:49] enjoy something better?
[2:23:51] It's true. The Bible doesn't talk about
[2:23:53] happiness. The Bible doesn't talk about
[2:23:56] amusement, but it talks of joy.
[2:24:00] Hallelujah. And it's different. Praise
[2:24:03] the name of the Lord. Amen. So, let's
[2:24:06] assume our
[2:24:07] positions. If mom is not home and I'm
[2:24:10] telling the children, you see your mom,
[2:24:11] she did this and she did that and what
[2:24:14] am I doing? I'm completely out of place.
[2:24:18] Right? Let them see a united parenthood
[2:24:22] because it brings them under subjection
[2:24:24] too. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So we want
[2:24:27] to look we have received the word. We
[2:24:31] know the role of a pastor. We know a
[2:24:33] deacon and trustee and everything. Let's
[2:24:35] be in our places in the church
[2:24:39] because when everything is in place is
[2:24:42] God. He will not fail. He will confirm
[2:24:45] it. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:24:55] Now, after the crucifixion of Jesus
[2:25:00] Christ, practically none of the apostles
[2:25:02] stayed in
[2:25:04] place. This one said, "Oh, I'm going
[2:25:06] fishing." This one said, "I'm joining
[2:25:07] you." They were all demoralized and
[2:25:09] everything. They thought, "Oh, Jesus was
[2:25:12] the one who was going to restore the
[2:25:13] kingdom to Israel." And yes, he was
[2:25:16] going to restore the kingdom, but it was
[2:25:18] more than the kingdom of
[2:25:19] Israel. He was going to restore the
[2:25:22] kingdom of God to man. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:25:28] But even that they had completely
[2:25:30] abandoned what they were aspiring for
[2:25:33] and then the the Lord reveals himself to
[2:25:36] them and the revelation changes
[2:25:38] everything. And now they're ready to t
[2:25:41] in Jerusalem. And they're ready to wait
[2:25:44] for the promise of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:25:47] Hallelujah.
[2:25:49] And so if we take our positions, we will
[2:25:52] see his promise fulfilled in our lives.
[2:25:55] Hallelujah.
[2:26:00] Everyone who has studied the history of
[2:26:02] the church knows what happened after
[2:26:05] Isuza Street. know that the beginning of
[2:26:07] the century the Welsh revival and then
[2:26:09] Auza Street comes in and then as it's
[2:26:13] dying out there was just an explosion of
[2:26:16] all sorts of denominations and
[2:26:18] everything and everybody is doing what
[2:26:20] what what they want the chaos that that
[2:26:22] that
[2:26:23] ensued until the revival
[2:26:27] started. God started the revival.
[2:26:31] But you see the Lord knew that you and I
[2:26:33] will be here and so what did he do? He
[2:26:35] didn't let the con confusion continue.
[2:26:38] He just sent correction to the church.
[2:26:41] Praise the name of the Lord. And so with
[2:26:44] that, it comes to prepare us for the
[2:26:47] journey. Right? That correction is what
[2:26:50] prepares us for because you see it's
[2:26:52] very simple. The Bible says uh the the
[2:26:56] bride has made herself ready but it's
[2:26:59] the Lord who provides everything that we
[2:27:01] need and everything has already been
[2:27:03] provided. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:27:07] And so, it's up to us to take it and
[2:27:10] make ourselves ready. You know,
[2:27:14] um Esther, Queen
[2:27:17] Esther, she had to dress herself, right?
[2:27:22] And she had to dress herself in a way
[2:27:23] that will please the king.
[2:27:26] But the only way she could do that was
[2:27:28] take everything absolutely everything
[2:27:30] from the
[2:27:31] palace. From head to toe her dress was
[2:27:34] completely from the palace. She couldn't
[2:27:36] keep wanting oh this this my mom gave me
[2:27:39] oh this is my identity and put a pin
[2:27:41] there disqualified. Oh no no absolutely
[2:27:44] everything had to come from the palace.
[2:27:46] And this is what we are saying that God
[2:27:49] has given us everything it takes to make
[2:27:51] it and so it's up to us to use it.
[2:27:55] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:28:02] So the next effect of that revelation
[2:28:04] was that they were empowered to take
[2:28:06] what was rightfully theirs.
[2:28:10] Because once the people thought that
[2:28:11] there was nobody from the house of David
[2:28:14] to to to lead them, they were
[2:28:16] demoralized.
[2:28:18] Nobody could stand for anything again.
[2:28:21] The boldness was gone. And then
[2:28:24] everybody succumbed to this dominating
[2:28:26] female spirit. But understand that this
[2:28:28] dominating fe spirit, brother Abraham
[2:28:30] has identified it. It's the antichrist
[2:28:32] spirit, right? And what does the
[2:28:34] antichrist spirit do? It makes the
[2:28:36] church lukewarm, formal and powerless.
[2:28:40] And so that is what Atallaya did to the
[2:28:44] church and that is what the spirit of
[2:28:46] Atallaya will do. And that is why the
[2:28:49] church if you recognize it and you have
[2:28:51] you have revelation then we fight it
[2:28:54] because it doesn't belong here.
[2:28:57] Hallelujah.
[2:29:00] So I'm reading from the church age again
[2:29:05] quickly. But the book of revelation
[2:29:07] shows how the antichrist spirit would
[2:29:09] come into the church and defile it
[2:29:11] making it lukewarm formal and powerless.
[2:29:13] It exposes certain revealing his works
[2:29:17] and attempted destruction of God's
[2:29:19] people and the discrediting of God's
[2:29:23] word. That is what the antichrist spirit
[2:29:25] does. But now we know how it started and
[2:29:28] where it
[2:29:30] started right down to the time he's cast
[2:29:33] into the lake of fire. He fights that.
[2:29:36] He cannot stand it. He knows that if the
[2:29:39] people get the true revelation of the
[2:29:42] true church and what she is, what she
[2:29:45] stands for, she can do the greater
[2:29:48] works. She will be an invincible army.
[2:29:54] And so now all the rulers are
[2:29:59] powerless. But once the king was
[2:30:01] revealed, so these same people who have
[2:30:04] stayed under submission for six
[2:30:08] years, suddenly they
[2:30:11] changed by looking at a seven-year-old
[2:30:13] boy.
[2:30:15] That is all that happened. Yes.
[2:30:17] Hallelujah. That is all that happened.
[2:30:21] And so now that they saw this
[2:30:22] seven-year-old boy and they recognize
[2:30:25] it's not the boy, it's not the age, but
[2:30:27] they recognize his role. They recognize
[2:30:29] his position and they recognize they
[2:30:31] have a king and the king is in his
[2:30:33] position and they can also take their
[2:30:35] position. And that is where we see the
[2:30:38] presence of our power, the source of our
[2:30:40] strength is that everybody takes their
[2:30:42] place and everybody takes their
[2:30:43] position. And so they see that they
[2:30:45] recognize that they take their position
[2:30:47] and what happens is that they're
[2:30:50] emboldened. And so now um as a lawyer
[2:30:53] comes in, sees what is going on,
[2:30:56] recognizes that that is the king and she
[2:31:00] rents her clothing and starts saying
[2:31:02] treason, treason, apparently in defeat.
[2:31:06] But they were not satisfied with that.
[2:31:08] They followed through and killed her.
[2:31:11] Hallelujah. And then once they killed
[2:31:13] her, they took back their kingdom. Amen.
[2:31:18] We are called to take back what is ours.
[2:31:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's be bold as
[2:31:25] fathers. Amen.
[2:31:28] Let's bring back the devotion times.
[2:31:31] Amen. Let's bring back the prayer
[2:31:33] meetings. Let's bring back order at
[2:31:36] home. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:31:38] Let's take back our children. Let's take
[2:31:41] back our family. Let's take back our
[2:31:43] marriages.
[2:31:44] Hallelujah. Everything that is wrong,
[2:31:46] let's take back. If we've caught the
[2:31:49] revelation, we are empowered to declare
[2:31:51] that he's not dead. He's risen and he's
[2:31:55] alive in our hearts.
[2:31:59] Hallelujah.
[2:32:03] And so the revelation of the king
[2:32:05] destroyed all the works of the evil one
[2:32:08] in Judah.
[2:32:10] You understand that Atallayia was
[2:32:13] killed. The dominating female spirit was
[2:32:16] subdued in
[2:32:18] Judah. Idolatry was uprooted. Martin and
[2:32:22] the priest of Bal was
[2:32:23] killed. Their national identity as a
[2:32:26] people of God was
[2:32:29] restored. The temple of Baal was
[2:32:32] destroyed.
[2:32:34] Hallelujah.
[2:32:37] There was joy. Their hope was restored.
[2:32:40] The Levites were restored. They went
[2:32:43] back to temple worship.
[2:32:45] Something they had been denied for six
[2:32:47] years.
[2:32:49] And all of that because the king was
[2:32:51] revealed.
[2:32:54] And yet the scripture says in 1 John 3:8
[2:32:56] that he manifest himself to destroy the
[2:32:59] works of the evil one.
[2:33:03] So if we have received a revelation for
[2:33:06] a day, it has to quicken us into action.
[2:33:10] Hallelujah. It has to quicken us to take
[2:33:12] a stand for the Lord. It has to quicken
[2:33:14] us to be known at work as believers. It
[2:33:18] has to quicken us to be
[2:33:21] known everywhere else at home at a
[2:33:24] church as a people who believe. Praise
[2:33:27] the name of the Lord.
[2:33:30] Thank you. We have to become true
[2:33:32] witnesses because that's what happens.
[2:33:34] He reveals to
[2:33:36] us and then we share and in the course
[2:33:40] of time with our faithfulness we become
[2:33:42] channels through which he manifest
[2:33:44] himself. Hallelujah.
[2:33:48] Now you have to understand that the
[2:33:49] people who received this revelation they
[2:33:52] were all
[2:33:54] fighters. Hallelujah. So that revelation
[2:33:57] is a call to fight. Amen. And when they
[2:34:01] received that revelation, they lost all
[2:34:03] their fear of
[2:34:04] Atallayia. They took back their
[2:34:07] possession. But most important of all,
[2:34:10] they also took they also protected their
[2:34:14] revelation because when they saw the
[2:34:16] king, now the king was their revelation.
[2:34:18] And then they took
[2:34:20] positions. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:34:31] That is the same thing that
[2:34:33] happened at the time of
[2:34:35] Jesus. You can see the the the how much
[2:34:39] the disciples were before they were
[2:34:42] before Jesus was revealed to them and
[2:34:44] how bolden they became once Jesus was
[2:34:47] revealed to them.
[2:34:52] Right now Jesus calls the revelation of
[2:34:55] who he is the very foundation of
[2:34:58] church. He says upon this rock I will
[2:35:01] build my church. Hallelujah. And he says
[2:35:04] the gate of hell cannot prevail against
[2:35:07] it. And so the
[2:35:10] revelation is what starts it. Now
[2:35:13] without that revelation, without that
[2:35:15] foundation, no matter what you build, it
[2:35:18] will not stand the test of
[2:35:20] time. That is why in this end time, the
[2:35:24] Lord has revealed himself
[2:35:27] again. Yes, in another form, but the
[2:35:30] truth of the trinity is known. In
[2:35:33] another form, but mystery Babylon is
[2:35:35] known in another form, but serpent seed
[2:35:38] is understood.
[2:35:40] In another form, communion is known in
[2:35:43] another form. So over and over, we could
[2:35:45] keep going. But all that restoration to
[2:35:48] what it was is to give us a foundation.
[2:35:51] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:35:58] Now I I'll just be closing now. When the
[2:36:02] people took their position, the spear of
[2:36:04] David was also given to
[2:36:06] them and the shield of David was given
[2:36:09] to
[2:36:10] them.
[2:36:12] Hallelujah. I am always late. I
[2:36:15] apologize. I don't know what to say. But
[2:36:18] you see that the spear of David, the
[2:36:21] shield of David in which was in the
[2:36:24] temple was given to these people when
[2:36:26] they took their position. Now these are
[2:36:28] spears and these are shells that have
[2:36:31] never known any defeat. Hallelujah. They
[2:36:34] have a long history of battles for the
[2:36:37] Lord. And absolutely no defeat.
[2:36:40] Hallelujah. What an honor for such a
[2:36:42] thing to be handed to you when you're
[2:36:45] getting ready for battle. Amen. But it
[2:36:48] makes me wonder in this end time, has
[2:36:51] the King Saul been handed to us?
[2:36:54] Praise the name of the living God.
[2:36:56] Hallelujah. And so what are we doing
[2:36:58] with it? Yes. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:37:02] So these people were sent forth to
[2:37:05] go like David of Fold, fight the Lord's
[2:37:08] battles and bring back the victory
[2:37:14] home. And then just before brother
[2:37:16] Abraham preaches the seals, the king
[2:37:19] sword is handed to him. Hallelujah. And
[2:37:23] then he declares to us that he's not
[2:37:25] dead and that he's alive. Amen.
[2:37:30] So let's recap as I'm I'm just fixing to
[2:37:33] close in five
[2:37:35] minutes. The king has been hidden for
[2:37:38] six years. In the seventh year, these
[2:37:42] people of his own chosen are
[2:37:44] invited. When these people come the word
[2:37:47] first, they take an oath. They make a
[2:37:51] covenant and then they crown the king.
[2:37:54] It's revealed to them. They crown him
[2:37:57] and they they anoint him and they they
[2:37:59] hand him the testimony and then they
[2:38:01] place him at a place in the
[2:38:03] temple. And then once they do that the
[2:38:07] people shout God save the king. Amen.
[2:38:10] And as they shout God save the king it
[2:38:13] attracts
[2:38:14] atallayah. When you come here and you
[2:38:16] are praising the Lord, when you come
[2:38:18] here and you are worshiping, don't think
[2:38:20] it's in vain. And don't think the devil
[2:38:22] doesn't know.
[2:38:25] Your praise is causing havoc in the
[2:38:27] devil's camp. Your worship is destroying
[2:38:30] things in the devil's camp.
[2:38:34] So do it with revelation as if you know
[2:38:36] what you're doing.
[2:38:39] Because it's happening. Hallelujah.
[2:38:40] Amen. I don't think the devil is so much
[2:38:44] bothered if oh let's stand up. Okay, I
[2:38:46] stand up. Let's raise our hands and I
[2:38:48] raise my hands and no but if you have
[2:38:51] the revelation and from your heart you
[2:38:53] are worshiping
[2:38:55] understand that it's causing havoc in
[2:38:57] the devil's camp.
[2:39:00] And so all of that
[2:39:03] happens and then ata comes in and she
[2:39:07] comes in confused.
[2:39:09] She comes in desperate. She starts
[2:39:12] yelling
[2:39:13] treason when they had not done anything
[2:39:16] to her yet. At that point, they had not
[2:39:18] done anything to
[2:39:21] her. And yet the worship and the praise
[2:39:25] bring her to that position. But the most
[2:39:28] important aspect of it was that she had
[2:39:30] lost their attention. Hallelujah.
[2:39:35] She had lost their and and attention
[2:39:37] means influence. Yes. And so for her to
[2:39:42] even walk to a place and not be
[2:39:44] recognized as the monarch,
[2:39:47] it means the people had no attention for
[2:39:49] her. And this is key as believers. We
[2:39:53] cannot focus too much on what the devil
[2:39:55] is doing. Amen. We have to focus on our
[2:39:57] Lord and we have to keep serving him. We
[2:40:00] have to keep worshiping him because the
[2:40:02] power is there.
[2:40:04] Without doing anything, she was already
[2:40:07] neutralized. Without doing anything, she
[2:40:10] was already wounded.
[2:40:14] Hallelujah.
[2:40:16] Completely rendered powerless because
[2:40:18] the people were praising.
[2:40:20] So understand it. When you lose
[2:40:24] attention, you lose influence.
[2:40:29] If you're in doubt, look at Goliath.
[2:40:33] He didn't do anything to Israel. Not
[2:40:36] wanting to
[2:40:37] Israel. He he he didn't even run after
[2:40:40] anybody in Israel. He didn't even hit
[2:40:41] somebody with a stick.
[2:40:43] No. But he had that appearance that got
[2:40:47] the attention of the entire army. And
[2:40:50] once he got the entire army's attention
[2:40:52] and he started speaking, then he held
[2:40:54] them under his control. Yes. And for
[2:40:57] over a month, they were under his
[2:40:59] control. An entire army. Yes. just
[2:41:01] because they gave him their attention.
[2:41:04] But you see, a man came who didn't care
[2:41:07] about appearance or what he's saying. In
[2:41:09] fact, instead of being scared, when
[2:41:12] David got there, he was furious.
[2:41:16] So, understand it and think about this
[2:41:18] before you scroll through the next reel
[2:41:21] on on social media. Your attention is
[2:41:24] power to the devil. Amen. So watch it
[2:41:29] before you spend your time checking out
[2:41:31] the the the latest movie from Hollywood.
[2:41:34] Think of it. Your attention is the power
[2:41:36] you are giving to him. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:41:43] I have to call the the the the
[2:41:45] musicians.
[2:41:47] Um we we've gone quite a bit. Amen.
[2:41:52] And so, brothers, sisters, we are called
[2:41:56] and the call is to first witness the
[2:41:59] resurrection and if you truly witness
[2:42:01] it, you become a witness. Thank you,
[2:42:04] Lord. You go and manifest it. Amen.
[2:42:07] Hallelujah. Amen. Now, there was a
[2:42:10] covenant between the people and God.
[2:42:14] That covenant did not come at the
[2:42:16] beginning. That covenant only came after
[2:42:18] Atallaya was dead. Because the king was
[2:42:21] not going to be there with Atallaya. No,
[2:42:24] it was either Atallaya reigning or the
[2:42:26] king reigning.
[2:42:28] And if we want to welcome our ken, we
[2:42:31] have to kill Atallaya.
[2:42:33] We have to kill every trace of that
[2:42:35] woman. We have to kill everything that
[2:42:38] seems to to subject us and does not give
[2:42:42] us the liberty to worship God. Let's be
[2:42:45] mindful of that. Because we have
[2:42:46] received a call. It's a sacred call.
[2:42:49] It's an important call. It's a call for
[2:42:52] life. It's a call to declare the
[2:42:54] resurrected Jesus Christ today. It's not
[2:42:58] that happened 2,000 years. He's alive
[2:43:01] today in our lives. Let's be mindful of
[2:43:03] it. Let's be respectful of that call.
[2:43:08] And let's display him. Let's be on our
[2:43:11] feet.
[2:43:24] Hallelujah. Let's sing. Uh, he
[2:43:33] lives. I serve a
[2:43:37] rising
[2:43:40] savior is in the world today.
[2:43:47] I know that
[2:43:50] he's
[2:43:52] living
[2:43:54] whatever men
[2:43:58] say. I see his hand of
[2:44:04] mercy. I hear his voice of cheer.
[2:44:10] And just the time I need
[2:44:15] him is
[2:44:18] always
[2:44:21] near. He
[2:44:23] lives. He
[2:44:26] lives. Christ Jesus lives
[2:44:31] today. He walks with me and walks with
[2:44:37] me. I love my narrow
[2:44:42] way. He
[2:44:45] [Music]
[2:44:47] lives
[2:44:49] salvation to impart.
[2:44:54] You ask me how I know he
[2:45:02] lives with
[2:45:04] [Music]
[2:45:13] him to crown me. I see his love in care.
[2:45:23] And though my heart grows
[2:45:27] weary, I never will
[2:45:33] despair. I know that he is
[2:45:38] living through all the stormy past.
[2:45:45] The day of his
[2:45:48] [Music]
[2:45:49] appearing will come at
[2:45:55] last. He
[2:45:57] [Applause]
[2:45:58] lives. He
[2:46:00] lives. Christ Jesus lives today.
[2:46:07] He walks with me and talks with me
[2:46:13] along the
[2:46:17] way. He
[2:46:19] lives. He
[2:46:22] lives
[2:46:23] salvation to
[2:46:26] [Music]
[2:46:27] him. You ask
[2:46:30] me, I know he lives.
[2:46:36] They
[2:46:37] left you
[2:46:40] in my heart.
[2:46:47] Rejoice, oh
[2:46:50] Christian, lift up your voice and
[2:46:55] sing.
[2:46:57] Eternal
[2:47:01] hallelujah to Jesus Christ the king.
[2:47:07] and all the father who

[2:50:47] He

[2:51:11] arose. Hallelujah.
[2:51:14] Christ the
[2:51:23] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's bow down our
[2:51:26] hearts before the
[2:51:27] Lord. Our dear savior and king, our
[2:51:30] master and
[2:51:33] God, you mean everything to us, Lord.
[2:51:36] Amen. Yes.
[2:51:38] And father, we understand this falling
[2:51:40] under the authority of the of your word.
[2:51:44] that when you arose, you arose with your
[2:51:46] bride. And so we stand here, oh Lord,
[2:51:50] called to manifest the resurrected
[2:51:52] savior in our lives. Father, we have
[2:51:55] weaknesses and short falls. Yes, Lord.
[2:51:58] Help us to only
[2:52:00] believe. That is our call, Father, to
[2:52:03] believe what you have sent to us. Ask
[2:52:05] your bride to be faithful, oh Lord.
[2:52:08] Father, when we step out there, Father,
[2:52:10] we are one in a million. It takes your
[2:52:13] strength. It takes your presence. It
[2:52:16] takes your constant reminder. It takes
[2:52:18] your encouragement. It takes everything
[2:52:20] we can get from you to make it through
[2:52:22] this life. But we are confident, oh
[2:52:24] Lord, that you are more than able to
[2:52:27] provide. In reality, you've provided it
[2:52:29] all. Help us to recognize it. Help us to
[2:52:33] use it. Help us to live it. There's
[2:52:36] nothing more precious than what you've
[2:52:37] done for us, oh Lord. But even as we go
[2:52:40] forward, oh Lord, help us to be mindful
[2:52:43] of the people around us, to be mindful
[2:52:45] of our family, to be mindful of our
[2:52:47] friends. Father, help us to understand
[2:52:49] the position in which we have been
[2:52:50] called into. Oh Lord, and Father, let
[2:52:53] help us to take all that privileges that
[2:52:55] you fought for, that you died for us. Oh
[2:52:57] Lord,
[2:52:59] we are yours and we love you. And when
[2:53:02] we come this way, we just come to
[2:53:04] surrender once
[2:53:06] more and just
[2:53:08] worship you and express our love to you.
[2:53:10] Oh Lord, thank you for seeing us through
[2:53:13] today. Oh God, thank you for your word
[2:53:14] of life. Oh Lord, if there be anything I
[2:53:18] said not consistent with your word,
[2:53:20] Lord, wipe it out completely. Oh Lord,
[2:53:23] but my prayer is that you continue to
[2:53:25] speak to our hearts even as we leave
[2:53:26] here. That we remain united in your
[2:53:29] presence even as people are separate
[2:53:31] ways. Lord, bless every soul out there
[2:53:34] who was supposed to be here, who could
[2:53:35] have been here but has had to be away.
[2:53:38] Father, those traveling, lead them
[2:53:39] safely back home. We pray, oh Lord, that
[2:53:42] you anoint my brother Mary Ben as he
[2:53:44] prepares for Wednesday, Lord.
[2:53:48] Every time we meet, Lord, may you have
[2:53:51] that permanence, oh Lord, because you
[2:53:53] are the reason for our meeting and you
[2:53:55] are the one we seek to please, Lord. and
[2:53:57] help us to go out there and declare a
[2:54:00] living God who is risen today to a dying
[2:54:03] world. We love and appreciate the
[2:54:05] master. In Jesus Christ's name do we
[2:54:08] pray. Amen.
[2:54:13] Let's sing one last song and then better
[2:54:15] he abides. Amen. Hallelujah.
