[24:58] Lord.
[25:02] [applause]
[25:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to have the
[25:04] revelation that you're not fighting
[25:06] flesh and blood but principality of
[25:08] darkness and you can separate the person
[25:10] from the demon and just come against
[25:12] Satan, not come against [music] the
[25:14] person. It's a wonderful revelation when
[25:16] you get that and you I know I talking to
[25:18] my wife this week. You just look at at
[25:21] challenges and trials differently,
[25:22] [music] what people are doing to you.
[25:24] You can separate that. Say, "Lord,
[25:25] that's just the devil. Satan, I come
[25:27] against you and it defeats you in the
[25:29] name of the Lord Jesus." That's the way
[25:31] it is. And you can pray for the person
[25:33] or they might try to destroy you. It's a
[25:34] wonderful thing. Believe it's an
[25:36] attribute of Christ. He did that. He
[25:38] died for us. What a day that will be.
[25:40] Just the chorus this [music] morning.
[25:42] Maybe you can stand with me. Oh, what
[25:45] [singing] a day
[25:47] that will be. [music]
[25:50] When my Jesus [singing]
[25:52] I shall see.
[25:55] When I [music] look upon his face and
[26:00] what he say [music and singing]
[26:02] by his grace.
[26:05] When he takes [singing]
[26:07] me by the hand [music]
[26:10] and he leads me through
[26:12] and promises. [singing]
[26:14] Oh, what a day [music]
[26:17] and glorious day
[26:20] that will be. Oh, [music]
[26:23] what a day
[26:26] that will be. [singing]
[26:28] Oh my Jesus.
[26:33] When I look [music and singing]
[26:36] upon his face
[26:40] [music]
[26:41] [singing]
[26:44] and he takes [music]
[26:46] me by
[26:48] and he leads [singing] me through
[26:50] [music]
[26:51] and promis
[26:57] [music]

[27:07] that will be.

[27:17] [music]
[27:20] see [singing]
[27:24] [music]
[27:27] me [singing] by the hands
[27:30] [music]
[27:31] me
[27:32] that promise. Oh, [music] what a day.

[27:49] Shall bow our heads and pray.

[30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats this
[30:34] morning.
[30:36] have a little bit of a Christmas theme.
[30:39] I just did a little research on some
[30:40] songs here this morning. Some of you
[30:42] might know this, but it's rather
[30:44] interesting. So, the great awakening as
[30:47] Charles Wesley was part of that great
[30:48] awakening and and uh through that
[30:52] period, [music] the man age after after
[30:54] Luther, but his song was written almost
[30:56] 300 years ago, 1730 [music] somewhere in
[30:59] there. And Charles Wesley wrote
[31:02] approximately 6,000 hymns in his
[31:04] lifetime. 6,000 hymns. So very much like
[31:07] Fanny Crosby just was known and renowned
[31:09] for his hymnwriting.
[31:11] 300 years ago, Hark the Herald Angels
[31:13] sing. And this song is sung by many. And
[31:17] when you read the words, they're so
[31:19] pertinent. They're so powerful. Let's
[31:21] sing it with Revelation this morning. We
[31:24] know that Christ wasn't born this time
[31:26] of year, but he was born and he came for
[31:28] us. He came to redeem us. Let's sing it
[31:31] this morning with Revelation. Oh,
[31:35] the herald [singing]
[31:36] angels sing. Glory to the newborn king.
[31:44] Peace [music] on earth and mercy.
[31:49] God [music and singing] and sin is
[31:52] reconiled.
[31:54] Joyful [singing]

[32:00] Join the triumph
[32:02] of the skies [music and singing] with

[32:13] Bethlehem.
[32:16] The herald angels sing.
[32:20] Glory to our newborn king. [music]
[32:26] Christ by highest heaven adore.
[32:31] Christ the everlasting
[32:34] [singing and music]
[32:35] Lord
[32:37] made great in time. Behold him come
[32:43] [music] up of virgin
[32:47] failed [music and singing] in flesh. Oh
[32:49] God see he [singing] be incarnate.
[32:54] [music]

[33:23] peace.

[33:37] [music] in his grace. mouth. He
[33:41] [singing] lays his glory by. Born and
[33:46] man [music and singing]
[33:48] died.
[33:50] Born to raise the [music] son of earth.

[34:00] heart the [singing]
[34:03] angels [music]

[34:49] state of thy Now heart the herald angels
[34:57] sing
[34:58] glory to the newborn [music]
[35:02] king.
[35:06] Chuckling inside, smiling inside as I
[35:08] think about Charles Wesley, our brother
[35:10] 300 years ago. He had quite the
[35:12] revelation when he wrote that, didn't
[35:14] he? He knew about the deity and boy,
[35:16] just just how God's faithfulness all the
[35:19] way through. Here we are for this song.
[35:21] This was written by a last name
[35:23] gentleman by the name of Wade. But that
[35:26] first song was actually uh Mendlesson
[35:28] actually added the music to that as a
[35:31] commemoration the 400th year of the of
[35:33] the invention of the Gutenberg press. So
[35:36] we know with the Goodenberg press came
[35:37] the Bible the printing of the Bible. So
[35:39] a lot of these things so many things God
[35:41] did just allowed things to happen.
[35:43] [music] Of course the world thinks it's
[35:45] something different. We know it's
[35:46] different. We know exactly why it was
[35:48] printed. that like the recording was was
[35:50] created in our day for the prophet's
[35:52] message. We know that was for us. The
[35:54] printing of the printed the the
[35:56] Gutenberg printing press was printed or
[35:58] invented for the Bible. All these things
[36:01] are wonderful and just wonderful to just
[36:03] enjoy the history of this but sing it
[36:06] with revelation this [music] morning. Oh
[36:07] come all you faithful. Any faithful here
[36:09] this morning
[36:10] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God I'm faithful not
[36:12] because of me but because of the life
[36:14] he's placed in me. Let's sing it this
[36:15] morning. Oh come
[36:19] all ye faithful,
[36:23] joyful
[36:25] and triumphant.
[36:29] Oh come ye, oh come ye to. [singing]
[36:40] [music]

[36:46] him for [singing] the king of angels.

[41:38] But this morning, if blood is flowing
[41:40] through us this morning, we have every
[41:43] reason to rejoice in what you have done
[41:45] for us this morning. We want to say
[41:47] thank you for each and everyone, Lord.
[41:50] This morning that has gathered here this
[41:51] morning, Lord. And this morning, Lord,
[41:54] we know your word is about to come
[41:56] forth. Father, we know that we have
[41:58] needs among us this morning.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; We bring them all together, Lord.
[42:03] Father, may you bless the service once
[42:05] again. We are bringing your tithe and
[42:08] offering, Father. We pray that you
[42:10] receive it and bless it, Father, for us
[42:13] &gt;&gt; for in Jesus name that we pray. Amen.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:19] Let's sing that song again. Let's take
[42:20] it up one more key if you wouldn't mind.
[42:22] The first verse, [music] first verse.
[42:25] He's worthy of our glory this morning.

[43:02] Oh come

[43:09] him
[43:10] born the king of angels. [singing]

[43:21] him. Oh come let [singing]
[43:25] us adore
[43:28] him. Oh come let us adore [singing]
[43:34] [music] him.
[43:35] Christ
[43:38] the Lord. For he [singing and music]
[43:41] alone
[43:43] is worthy.
[43:46] For he alone [music]
[43:49] is worthy.
[43:52] For he [music and singing] alone
[43:55] is worthy.
[43:58] [music]
[43:59] Christ [singing]
[44:02] the Lord.
[44:04] [music]
[44:06] Amen. Amen. You may have your seats this
[44:08] morning. We have a lot of specials this
[44:10] morning and so sorry it'll take a little
[44:12] longer for song service this morning,
[44:14] but uh Sister Kindness, if you'd start
[44:17] the service this morning and then Sister
[44:19] Adena, I believe has a special and then
[44:22] the choir and then we're going to have a
[44:24] Sunday school group at the last. So if
[44:26] you come in that order, Sister Kindness,
[44:28] Sister Adena, the choir and then the
[44:31] Sunday school class. God bless you as
[44:33] you enjoy these specials that these
[44:35] folks have brought their gifts to the
[44:37] Lord this morning.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. It's not a
[44:52] Christmas song.
[44:54] Sorry. It's just um a testimony for what
[44:57] God has done for me, for my family and
[45:00] my church back home.
[45:02] I just want to say thank you for all
[45:04] your prayers for our brothers released.
[45:08] Um, and for God seeing my sister through
[45:11] an emergency surgery. She had to go this
[45:13] week. I'm just thankful to God that
[45:16] every day we wake up in the morning. We
[45:18] don't know what's going to happen, but
[45:19] he somehow carries us through
[45:22] &gt;&gt; and he has brought me and my family and
[45:25] all of us here through to the end of
[45:27] this year. And I am just here just his
[45:30] little us to just give him back the
[45:32] praise.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[46:19] &gt;&gt; The room grew still as she made
[46:22] [singing] her way to Jesus.
[46:25] She stumbled
[46:27] through the tears that made her blind.
[46:30] [singing]
[46:34] She felt such pain.
[46:38] Some [music] spoke in anger.
[46:41] Her folks whispered,
[46:43] "There's no place here [singing] for
[46:46] your kind."
[46:49] But still on she came
[46:52] through the shame that flushed her face
[46:56] until [singing] at last she knelt before
[47:01] his feet.
[47:04] And though she [singing] spoke no words,
[47:08] everything she said was hers.
[47:12] as she poured a love for the master from
[47:16] her box of alabaster. [singing]
[47:21] And I've come to pour
[47:26] my praise [music] on him like oil
[47:29] [singing]
[47:31] from Mary's
[47:33] alaster.
[47:35] [singing]
[47:39] Please don't be [singing] angry if I
[47:42] wash his feet with my tears
[47:46] and I try [singing] them
[47:48] with my hand.
[47:54] You went there [singing]
[47:58] the night he found me.
[48:01] You did not feel what I felt when he
[48:05] wrapped his love [singing] arms around
[48:08] me. And you don't know the curse of the
[48:14] oil and my alabaster.
[48:17] [singing and music]
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:25] See, I can't forget [singing]
[48:28] [music]
[48:29] the way life used to be. See, I was a
[48:33] prisoner to the sin that had me bound.
[48:41] And I've [singing] spent my days
[48:44] I poured my life without measure into a
[48:48] [singing] little treasure box I thought
[48:52] I found.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[48:56] &gt;&gt; until the day
[48:59] when [singing] Jesus came to me and he
[49:02] healed my soul
[49:04] with the wonder of he is touch.
[49:08] [singing]
[49:10] So now I'm giving back to him all the
[49:14] praise he's worthy [singing] of. [music]
[49:17] See, I've been forgi.
[49:20] And that's why
[49:22] I love him so much.
[49:27] I've come to pour
[49:31] my [singing]
[49:32] praise onto him like oil [music]
[49:36] from Mary's alabaster [singing]
[49:40] bus.
[49:41] [music]
[49:44] So please don't be angry if I wash his
[49:48] feet with my tears
[49:50] and I dry them
[49:53] with my hair. [singing]
[49:59] She were there
[50:02] the night he found me.
[50:06] [music] You did not feel what I felt
[50:09] [singing] when he wrapped his loving
[50:12] arms around me. [music] And you don't
[50:17] know the curse of my oil.
[50:23] You don't know the curse of my praise.
[50:30] [singing] You don't know the curse of
[50:34] the oil.
[50:37] In my [singing] head
[50:40] turn.
[50:54] [applause]
[51:01] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[52:30] God bless you all.
[52:40] I come to you with the weight [singing]
[52:44] of all my stress.
[52:49] You pick me up and let me catch my
[52:54] breath.
[52:58] Lord, [singing and music] you never
[53:00] condemn, never make a list of wrongs.
[53:07] In the light of your goodness, all the
[53:10] fear I've known is gone.
[53:15] I'm safe in your arms, [singing]
[53:18] your arms
[53:21] of love.
[53:25] I'm safe in your arms. [singing]
[53:28] Your arms
[53:30] are love.
[53:34] And all of my heart, [singing]
[53:37] my hope,
[53:39] my trust
[53:41] is he

[53:52] I'm safe in [singing] your arms,
[53:55] your arms
[53:58] of love.
[54:03] You were [singing] there when there was
[54:07] nothing left.
[54:12] A spark [singing and music] of hope
[54:14] where I saw emptyness.
[54:20] Somehow [singing]
[54:22] even in pieces you restore me with your
[54:25] peace.

[54:33] everending

[59:07] Christ is born.
[59:11] as you [music]

[59:48] the humble Christ.
[59:51] [music]
[59:52] God sent [singing] us salvation

[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:25] Amen.
[1:01:33] Why don't we give everyone another round
[1:01:34] of applause? Thank you [applause] for
[1:01:36] all the gifts this morning.
[1:01:41] If you stand with me, I believe the
[1:01:43] choir story of the Sunday school is
[1:01:44] going to be next Sunday. So, that was my
[1:01:46] my mistake. Next Sunday, we'll hear from
[1:01:50] the uh young folks.
[1:01:52] Looking forward to that.
[1:01:54] Looking forward to the word now [music]
[1:01:56] as we change the atmosphere of the
[1:01:57] service this morning. As we kind of
[1:02:00] change the tone as it were.
[1:02:03] Let's move down to 10:52. Word of God.
[1:02:06] Ever true. It's where we came here to
[1:02:08] receive this morning. Long preserved.
[1:02:12] Here we are walking in this word that
[1:02:15] the Lord descended [music] with, proved,
[1:02:17] vindicated. Heard the prophet the other
[1:02:19] day talking about all the things he
[1:02:21] said. See now he did in one service more
[1:02:23] than he's been recorded in his entire
[1:02:25] earthly ministry. He said that then he
[1:02:27] said then the tens of thousands of times
[1:02:29] he's done it besides this and I thought
[1:02:32] you know there's just no excuse. The
[1:02:33] [music] whole world has heard the whole
[1:02:36] world's had the vindicated message
[1:02:38] around and around the world. But here we
[1:02:40] are this little group of people seeds of
[1:02:42] God that I believe God's sporting for
[1:02:44] the foundation of the world. Here we are
[1:02:46] this morning. What a work of grace he's
[1:02:48] done in each of our lives. We have so
[1:02:49] much to be thankful for. Lord, will you
[1:02:52] just change me with your word as we hear
[1:02:55] it this morning? Oh, holy word,
[1:02:59] long preserved
[1:03:02] for our one
[1:03:05] in [music] this world.
[1:03:08] They resound
[1:03:11] with God's own heart.
[1:03:13] [singing and music]
[1:03:14] Oh, let the ancient words impart.
[1:03:20] Word of God, [music] it's ever true.
[1:03:26] It's changing me
[1:03:28] [music and singing] and changing you.
[1:03:32] We have come [music] with open hearts.
[1:03:38] Oh, let the word of God impart.
[1:03:44] Words [singing] of life,
[1:03:46] words of hope.
[1:03:49] It [music] gives us strength [singing]
[1:03:52] and helps us grow.
[1:03:55] In this [singing and music] world
[1:03:58] where we roam
[1:04:01] the word of [music] God will guide us
[1:04:06] [singing]
[1:04:07] of God [music]
[1:04:10] is never [singing] true.
[1:04:12] Is changing me
[1:04:15] and changing [music] you.
[1:04:18] We have come
[1:04:21] with open hearts.
[1:04:24] Oh, let the word of God imparty
[1:04:27] [music and singing]
[1:04:31] words
[1:04:33] of our faith. They were handed down
[1:04:38] [music and singing] to this age. Oh,
[1:04:40] they came to us through [music]
[1:04:44] sacrifice.
[1:04:46] Oh, he [singing] the faithful words of
[1:04:50] Christ. Father Mary, would you come? The
[1:04:53] word of God
[1:04:56] ever true
[1:04:58] is changing [music and singing] me and
[1:05:01] it's changing you
[1:05:05] have [singing] come
[1:05:07] with open hearts.
[1:05:09] Oh, let the [music] word of God
[1:05:13] when you come, brother. Oh, [singing]
[1:05:16] word of God.
[1:05:18] [music] It's ever true.
[1:05:23] [music]
[1:05:27] We have come with open
[1:05:31] [music and singing] hearts.
[1:05:33] Let the word of God impart. [singing]
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you today. Welcome
[1:05:42] [music]
[1:05:43] to the house of the Lord. We certainly
[1:05:45] thank the Lord for his goodness and his
[1:05:49] mercy to us. Amen.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Today I just want to welcome our
[1:05:54] visitors. We have uh sister an Anna from
[1:05:58] Ghana staying with uh Sar Pongs. God
[1:06:02] bless you, sister.
[1:06:04] [applause]
[1:06:09] And sister Mary Olerte has, I think,
[1:06:12] [music] her entire family here with her
[1:06:14] today.
[1:06:15] God richly bless each and every one of
[1:06:18] you. [applause]
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; And if I'm not mistaken, um [music] I'm
[1:06:25] so sorry I forget your name, but I do
[1:06:28] know that we prayed for you in Colombia.
[1:06:30] Is that right? This is the sister that
[1:06:34] had had the cancer, had such a terrible
[1:06:38] testimony from the doctors,
[1:06:41] but we went to the great physician and
[1:06:43] we stood with you up here in Calgary and
[1:06:46] we're so thankful that you could be here
[1:06:48] today. God bless you, sister. [applause]
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; It truly is an honor to have you with us
[1:07:03] each and everyone. If I haven't
[1:07:06] mentioned anyone, forgive me. God bless
[1:07:08] you and welcome.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; I trust you feel right at home today.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; I have [music] a note. I have a note
[1:07:14] from
[1:07:16] sister Jarmaine's sister,
[1:07:19] the auntie that was here visiting with
[1:07:21] us. and it was given to me today and
[1:07:24] asked if I would read it. Happy holidays
[1:07:27] from Sister Charmaine's sisters.
[1:07:31] They would like [music] to thank you for
[1:07:32] welcoming them at church. Unfortunately,
[1:07:36] they did not have the chance to say
[1:07:38] goodbye last Wednesday due to the road
[1:07:41] weather conditions.
[1:07:43] They're wishing everyone a happy
[1:07:44] holidays and are thankful for the warm
[1:07:47] welcome to the church community. God
[1:07:51] bless you all.
[1:07:53] Amen. [applause]
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; We certainly are thankful for the
[1:08:02] testimony of the believers.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; And even though we have to part ways
[1:08:06] here on this side of eternity, we know
[1:08:09] that we will meet [music] again.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; This morning, we're certainly thankful
[1:08:13] to have uh brother [music] Toby Odenovo
[1:08:16] taking the service for us. and uh he was
[1:08:20] actually in Nigeria recently and he
[1:08:22] [music] was able to fellowship with the
[1:08:24] church that was enduring the issue with
[1:08:28] the hostages. Just one of the of the
[1:08:31] many situations
[1:08:34] where the extremists are actually taking
[1:08:37] Christians as hostage. And there's many
[1:08:41] different outcomes, but the best
[1:08:43] possible outcome happened in this
[1:08:44] situation. [music] And we certainly
[1:08:46] thank the Lord for answering everyone's
[1:08:48] prayers because we know there is people
[1:08:50] praying all around the world for this
[1:08:52] situation.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; So we're certainly thankful for that.
[1:08:56] And brother Toby is going to take the
[1:08:58] service today and explain a little bit
[1:08:59] about that and uh you know a little bit
[1:09:02] more about what the Lord's put on his
[1:09:04] heart. [music] We're certainly thankful
[1:09:05] for him and what the Lord's done for him
[1:09:07] in his life. So we just want to invite
[1:09:10] brother Toby to come and maybe we could
[1:09:12] just sing this song again. Word of God
[1:09:15] ever true.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; And I I just want to ask the question,
[1:09:19] how many people want to stay the same
[1:09:21] that came in the building today? I
[1:09:23] believe every one of us wants to leave
[1:09:25] here changed individuals.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; And if not, perhaps something that is
[1:09:30] said today will tweak that that life
[1:09:33] inside of us to cause us to want to
[1:09:36] change, to grow into that that [music]
[1:09:38] manifested word for our day.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing that chorus as we
[1:09:44] invite brother Toby to come. Oh word of
[1:09:47] God,
[1:09:49] ever [music and singing] true,
[1:09:52] changing me,
[1:09:55] [music] changing you.
[1:09:59] We have [singing] come with [music] open
[1:10:03] hearts.
[1:10:04] Oh, let [singing] the word of God.
[1:10:09] [music]
[1:10:11] Word of God
[1:10:13] [singing]
[1:10:14] is true.
[1:10:17] Changing me,
[1:10:20] [music] changing you.
[1:10:23] We have come
[1:10:25] with
[1:10:27] heart [music and singing]
[1:10:29] and the word of God.
[1:10:35] Holy words
[1:10:38] of our [music]
[1:10:46] [music]
[1:10:48] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:10:51] [music]
[1:10:52] [singing]
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; changing
[1:11:08] changing [music]
[1:11:14] open [singing] hearts.
[1:11:17] I let [music] the word of God in my
[1:11:21] heart.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a privilege and honor to
[1:11:30] stand before the purchased possession
[1:11:33] of the Almighty God.
[1:11:36] Brother said if he had a jar with the
[1:11:40] blood of Jesus Christ in it, he will be
[1:11:43] very careful not to make it fall.
[1:11:47] He said, "If you think about that and
[1:11:49] then you think about
[1:11:52] what that Lord purchased, which is you
[1:11:55] and I, he said, which one will we be
[1:11:58] more careful about?"
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Because what you buy is greater than
[1:12:04] what you used to buy it.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; So, we're grateful to God for being here
[1:12:08] this morning. You might have your seat
[1:12:09] for a little while.
[1:12:12] want to thank the pastor for [music]
[1:12:15] the privilege to stand before you.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; I will spend some minutes to bring the
[1:12:21] testimony from Nigeria
[1:12:24] and then [music] we'll get into the
[1:12:25] word. I recognize we're starting a
[1:12:29] little bit late.
[1:12:30] Don't be nervous. I'll try not to be
[1:12:34] long with you,
[1:12:36] but if I need to be long, I will ask for
[1:12:38] permission. And I'm sure everyone will
[1:12:40] be kind enough to give me a few more
[1:12:43] minutes.
[1:12:44] I just want to read a scripture before
[1:12:47] um Yeah, musicians. Thank you. We should
[1:12:49] be good. Thank you. God bless you. I'll
[1:12:52] just read a scripture before um I give a
[1:12:55] brief testimony of what the Lord did.
[1:12:58] I'll read from Acts chapter 4 verse 20.
[1:13:03] just bring in a little bit of context
[1:13:05] from this um that might be different
[1:13:08] from the actual context.
[1:13:12] This is when the apostles were arrested
[1:13:16] for their faith and for what the Lord
[1:13:19] started to do as the New Testament
[1:13:21] church was starting and they had been
[1:13:26] taken and you know
[1:13:29] they had beaten them and dealt with them
[1:13:31] in a bad way.
[1:13:33] And uh Peter and John was replying to
[1:13:36] those that said they shouldn't talk
[1:13:38] about Jesus Christ. Verse 20 says, "For
[1:13:42] we cannot but speak the things which we
[1:13:45] have seen and heard." And I think that's
[1:13:48] what testimonies are about
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; to say the things that we have seen
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; and the things we have heard.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; So I'll just uh start with a little bit
[1:13:57] about the country Nigeria for those that
[1:13:59] don't know. There's so many Nigerians in
[1:14:01] here. So if I get anything wrong, I'm
[1:14:04] sure they can correct me. But I think
[1:14:07] I'm I'm Nigerian enough to to get it
[1:14:09] right. So Nigeria is uh one of the many
[1:14:13] countries in Africa. It's on the west 10
[1:14:17] part of Africa, the west coast of
[1:14:19] Africa. And uh the estimated population
[1:14:22] is about 230 to 237 million people.
[1:14:29] Um, they also say that one out of every
[1:14:32] four black people you meet is Nigerian.
[1:14:36] So we we're many there are many of us
[1:14:38] around the world.
[1:14:40] We have hundreds of ethnic groups about
[1:14:43] more than 250 ethnic groups and
[1:14:47] although English is the official
[1:14:48] language, there are more than 500
[1:14:51] indigenous languages that are spoken
[1:14:53] across the country. the three of them
[1:14:55] that are the main
[1:14:57] um languages, but if you have to get to
[1:15:01] the dialects, there are about more than
[1:15:03] 500 of them. So, don't see a Nigerian
[1:15:06] and say, "Do you speak Nigerian?"
[1:15:09] Because [laughter]
[1:15:10] there's nothing about there's nothing
[1:15:11] that's called Nigerian when it comes to
[1:15:13] language. Uh there is Heb, there's
[1:15:16] Yoruba and Husa. Those are the three
[1:15:18] major ones.
[1:15:20] Um, Lagos is where the message church
[1:15:23] where uh the brothers that were
[1:15:26] kidnapped, that's where they came from.
[1:15:28] I'll also say that uh we have a few
[1:15:30] people that grew up in that church here.
[1:15:31] I did not grow up there, but Sister
[1:15:33] Kindness grew up there. Brother Danielbe
[1:15:36] grew up there and brother Jason Okawo
[1:15:38] grew up there. So, um, but we we we
[1:15:41] moved to there um a few years before we
[1:15:44] moved to Canada and uh um it just became
[1:15:47] home to us as well.
[1:15:49] So Lagos has an estimated population of
[1:15:52] 17 million people. Um that is about I
[1:15:56] think Calgary is just about coming up to
[1:15:57] 2 million. Um so that's that's many
[1:16:02] eight times almost or more of the size
[1:16:06] of Calgary.
[1:16:07] And across Nigeria it's estimated that
[1:16:10] there are about 612
[1:16:12] message churches. Um and this is the
[1:16:15] account of voice of God. So churches
[1:16:17] that they support across uh Nigeria are
[1:16:21] 600 612 and Lagos will have uh
[1:16:25] definitely will have a large portion of
[1:16:27] that. um when it comes to percentage of
[1:16:30] churches that are in the different
[1:16:32] cities across the country um and the the
[1:16:36] local Christian assembly Lagos a church
[1:16:38] in Nigeria um I guess we'll have about
[1:16:42] 800 to a thousand believers depending on
[1:16:45] how many people show up in church um we
[1:16:47] also Lagos being the economic capital of
[1:16:51] Nigeria it's it's not the political
[1:16:53] capital but it's it's like uh the
[1:16:55] biggest city when it comes to trade and
[1:16:58] all of that. Um, Lagos has uh a lot of
[1:17:01] people moved to Lagos. They might have
[1:17:03] lived elsewhere. So, um, churches in
[1:17:05] Lagos sometimes benefit from that.
[1:17:08] So, we um already know that seven of our
[1:17:11] brothers were kidnapped. They were
[1:17:13] coming from um a funeral service in the
[1:17:17] eastern part of Nigeria. And um on their
[1:17:21] way
[1:17:22] actually there were a few cars or a few
[1:17:24] buses. They were traveling and uh the
[1:17:28] the kidnappers actually attacked the the
[1:17:30] vehicle that had sisters in it. Um and
[1:17:34] the sisters called and kind of sisters
[1:17:36] were there. They called the brothers um
[1:17:39] the vehicle that the brothers were in um
[1:17:42] and then the brothers had to come um to
[1:17:46] their rescue so to say. So they they
[1:17:49] came and um eventually the kidnappers
[1:17:52] took seven brothers. They were almost
[1:17:55] going to take eight of them but the
[1:17:57] vehicle only their ve the vehicle that
[1:18:00] they used to kidnap them only feed um
[1:18:02] seven of our brothers. So they they let
[1:18:05] the sisters go and then the brothers
[1:18:08] were kidnapped
[1:18:10] and uh for about 6 days we heard nothing
[1:18:14] like there was nothing that was uh
[1:18:18] said um there were no calls there was
[1:18:21] nothing that uh the families heard and
[1:18:24] uh of course that would have been a very
[1:18:26] difficult time because they couldn't
[1:18:27] tell whether they were alive or
[1:18:29] something had happened to them. But
[1:18:32] right after the situation happened, um
[1:18:35] the news went across the world very
[1:18:37] fast. Um LCA Lagos is also where the um
[1:18:42] I'll say the secretary for the voice of
[1:18:44] God recordings in Nigeria. That's where
[1:18:48] um he fellowships is one of the
[1:18:50] ministers there. So he was able to send
[1:18:52] the news across and uh during the three
[1:18:55] weeks I I tuned into one of the services
[1:18:59] um with brother Tims and I was humbled
[1:19:03] to hear that they were praying for them.
[1:19:05] So I was very very
[1:19:08] um interested to know what the Lord did.
[1:19:11] Um so they were there for about 3 weeks
[1:19:14] and uh if you remember on the 28 on the
[1:19:18] 26th of October we were still here and
[1:19:22] uh we brought the testimony that the
[1:19:23] brothers had been released.
[1:19:26] Um I and a few of us had tuned into the
[1:19:29] service in Lagos that morning because of
[1:19:31] course there Nigeria is currently eight
[1:19:32] hours ahead. So we had tuned in and uh
[1:19:36] it was jubilation and uh celebration in
[1:19:39] the church. Um um but turns out uh they
[1:19:42] had not been released yet. It was an
[1:19:45] action in faith uh because uh the pastor
[1:19:48] had said that next Sunday we're going to
[1:19:51] be celebrating the release of our
[1:19:53] brothers. We're going to have a
[1:19:54] thanksgiving service here in church. Um
[1:19:59] so we thought they were released and um
[1:20:01] we were happy and celebrating and
[1:20:04] already um making
[1:20:07] uh just thinking about being there
[1:20:09] because uh there are certain victories
[1:20:12] that when it's being celebrated you
[1:20:14] don't want to watch on the screen. You
[1:20:16] like to be there in person um because
[1:20:18] you you were part of the pain. You were
[1:20:20] part of the process of um calling God on
[1:20:24] the scene. So we decided uh on this 27th
[1:20:29] of October, the Monday to make the trip
[1:20:32] to Nigeria. It was very quick. Um I'll
[1:20:34] also say was inspired by sister kindness
[1:20:37] who um we had gone remember that day the
[1:20:40] 26th there was a um a lot supper
[1:20:42] service. So we had gone home. She had
[1:20:44] gone home with us in the afternoon and
[1:20:46] uh I had gone to take some rest upstairs
[1:20:48] and came downstairs and uh my wife said
[1:20:51] well kindness just bought a ticket.
[1:20:52] she's going to Nigeria. I said, "Is that
[1:20:55] how you go to Nigeria to just buy a
[1:20:58] ticket and uh go on uh I don't know how
[1:21:01] many thousands of kilometers?" Um but I
[1:21:04] didn't know that God was doing that to
[1:21:06] also kind of inspire me. So I got home
[1:21:08] that night. I asked my wife. Um I
[1:21:11] started checking tickets and the prizes
[1:21:13] were good. So I looked at my wife and
[1:21:15] said, "Do we go as well?" She was meant
[1:21:17] to go for work already and then she
[1:21:19] said, "Oh, let's all go together." So um
[1:21:22] we the Lord we prayed about it. I must
[1:21:26] say that we prayed about it and told the
[1:21:28] Lord a few things we wanted to see. We
[1:21:31] wanted to make sure that we wanted to um
[1:21:34] we asked the Lord that he should grant
[1:21:36] us favor that I could ask for permission
[1:21:38] to be away at work and that will be
[1:21:40] granted. Um Timothy was born here. So at
[1:21:43] the time he didn't have a Nigerian
[1:21:44] passport which meant he was a foreigner
[1:21:46] that was going to need a visa. Um, we
[1:21:48] also pray that God will make us be able
[1:21:50] to get a visa very quickly and then uh
[1:21:53] we also ask that the Lord will keep us
[1:21:55] all in good health and the Lord answered
[1:21:57] all of those prayers.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; So we traveled on the 30th of October uh
[1:22:04] with Sister Kindness as well, my family
[1:22:05] and sister kindness. We arrived uh early
[1:22:08] hours of November 1st in Lagos and the
[1:22:11] Thanksgiving service was on November
[1:22:14] 2nd. I will say that the service
[1:22:17] probably took approximately six hours.
[1:22:22] Um it's it's it's not entirely unusual
[1:22:27] for LC Legos. See, brother Jason is
[1:22:31] so um don't worry, we're not doing that
[1:22:32] tonight.
[1:22:35] [gasps]
[1:22:35] But uh it was a service. It was a
[1:22:39] service. I I was so glad to be home. I
[1:22:43] already told my musician friends that
[1:22:46] we're playing together. Um, one of the
[1:22:49] brothers that was kidnapped um is one of
[1:22:52] the finest organists I've ever met and a
[1:22:55] good friend of mine. I remember when
[1:22:57] they were in captivity, I told the Lord,
[1:22:59] if Michael gets back to church, if
[1:23:02] they're released, I will play with
[1:23:04] Michael. And um God granted that
[1:23:08] opportunity, that that prayer request.
[1:23:10] And uh we we had a wonderful service. Um
[1:23:14] there's too much to say about the
[1:23:15] service. It was Thanksgiving at at some
[1:23:18] point uh when the choir was going to
[1:23:20] sing. It wasn't just the choir actually.
[1:23:23] It was like everyone came on the
[1:23:25] platform. I was uh with the musicians at
[1:23:27] one of the corners and I was sweating
[1:23:30] too bad because the entire platform was
[1:23:34] full of people. Full of people dancing.
[1:23:37] The entire front was full of people
[1:23:39] celebrating. because it was a great
[1:23:41] deliverance. And I'll tell you a few
[1:23:42] things that the Lord did because my
[1:23:44] curiosity was what did the Lord do in
[1:23:47] answer to our prayers? It wasn't just
[1:23:49] their release, but what was happening
[1:23:51] when they were there? So, it turns out
[1:23:54] um the people that took them captive um
[1:23:58] told them that they are
[1:24:01] part of a a rebel group that is trying
[1:24:04] to um that is kind of conversing for
[1:24:07] another country.
[1:24:09] um like a part of the country to to
[1:24:12] become uh its own country and they did
[1:24:16] this to raise money to buy ammunition to
[1:24:18] be able to fight the Nigerian
[1:24:20] government.
[1:24:21] Um that was what they said to them. But
[1:24:24] one of the brothers that I had the
[1:24:25] privilege to speak with told me that um
[1:24:29] as soon as they were they were taken
[1:24:32] captive, he prayed and said, "Lord,
[1:24:34] grant us favor before this people." So
[1:24:37] they took them and
[1:24:40] they the the place where the vehicle
[1:24:43] could stop because it couldn't go any
[1:24:46] further and Nigeria is has a rainforest
[1:24:49] so that makes it very difficult as well
[1:24:51] because there are big trees everywhere.
[1:24:53] They had to walk three hours into the
[1:24:55] forest to the camp of the kidnappers
[1:24:59] and uh some of them had to walk barefoot
[1:25:01] because they told them to take off their
[1:25:02] shoes. And he said he prayed and so they
[1:25:06] had a tent where they kept them and at
[1:25:08] night well during the day and night they
[1:25:10] had guards on shifts that will come and
[1:25:13] go and God granted them favor before one
[1:25:16] of the guards. Uh the guards don't call
[1:25:19] their personal names. They use code
[1:25:21] names. But this actual guy told them his
[1:25:24] name and told them not to be afraid. He
[1:25:26] said, "We're not going to kill you. All
[1:25:28] we want is money and uh once we get the
[1:25:31] money, we'll release you." But there's
[1:25:33] another group that you should be
[1:25:34] grateful that you did not get um
[1:25:38] captured by like they were not the ones
[1:25:40] that took you because this group will
[1:25:42] collect the money and we kill you. So um
[1:25:45] we're not going to kill you. We just
[1:25:48] want the money. Of course they
[1:25:49] maltreated them the bit then they did
[1:25:51] too many things. I like what uh a pastor
[1:25:53] in Nigeria said. He said we will not
[1:25:55] boast about what Satan did. We want to
[1:25:57] boast about what Jesus did.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; So um so I want to talk about a few
[1:26:03] things that Jesus did. First that God
[1:26:04] granted them favor before the guards. Um
[1:26:07] one of the brothers doesn't do well with
[1:26:10] cold at all. So, um it was it's it's not
[1:26:13] as cold as here, but at night it gets
[1:26:16] cold,
[1:26:18] Nigerian type of cold when it rains. Um
[1:26:22] and they were they didn't have beds.
[1:26:25] They they hardly even stood for most of
[1:26:28] the time. They were either lying down or
[1:26:30] sitting down. Um and they were lying
[1:26:33] down on bamboo
[1:26:35] um bamboo trees. So they like bamboo
[1:26:38] beds, beds made of bamboo, like just
[1:26:40] makeshift beds. And at night um one of
[1:26:43] the brothers would shiver like really
[1:26:47] shivering and you will hear the bamboo
[1:26:49] bed really um cringing and all of that
[1:26:53] and and many times they will just pray
[1:26:55] and God will come on the scene and and
[1:26:57] heal them. One of the most spec
[1:26:59] spectacular miracles that God did for
[1:27:02] them and sometimes it might be hard to
[1:27:04] believe this but our God is
[1:27:07] he does the impossible
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; because the Nigerian government knows
[1:27:12] that they're there and the military
[1:27:13] knows that they're there. Sometimes they
[1:27:15] have operations and they will have the
[1:27:16] military fighter jets that will be
[1:27:19] shelling those areas. But the brother
[1:27:21] told me that this particular day they
[1:27:23] could feel the fighter jet right above
[1:27:26] the tent shelling but nothing dropped on
[1:27:30] the tent.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; He said his testimony is he felt that
[1:27:33] the Lord just put his angels and made
[1:27:35] them spread their wings so that as those
[1:27:38] shells were coming down, those bombs
[1:27:39] were coming down, he was just dispassing
[1:27:41] them.
[1:27:44] And um one of the brothers as well um
[1:27:47] has an atm asthmatic condition and he
[1:27:50] passed out twice
[1:27:53] um and they prayed that the Lord
[1:27:55] restored him as well. So that was also a
[1:27:58] miracle because in that condition where
[1:28:02] they couldn't shower for 3 weeks um they
[1:28:06] they were in distress. they had
[1:28:09] maltreated them, beaten them, and done
[1:28:11] all sort of things. Um, for someone to
[1:28:14] pass out and be able to come back, it
[1:28:16] was just God's grace.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Um, and then the strength that God gave
[1:28:21] them to walk for three hours in the
[1:28:22] forest,
[1:28:24] the way in and the way out, it was just
[1:28:27] the grace of God. So, I want to on
[1:28:30] behalf of the brothers and the church,
[1:28:33] thank you all for your prayers.
[1:28:36] um we will never really be able to tell
[1:28:38] what the Lord did.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; The whatifs are too many
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; that
[1:28:48] we can only say thank you Lord. And I'll
[1:28:52] also mention that the grace that God
[1:28:55] gave the brothers and sisters in the
[1:28:57] church to react the way God wanted or
[1:29:02] what the way God wants us to react in
[1:29:04] situations like this was another
[1:29:05] miracle.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; The devil wanted to bring panic. The
[1:29:09] devil wanted to bring uncertainty
[1:29:11] uncertainty and fear and all of that.
[1:29:14] But I will tune into the services whilst
[1:29:17] the brothers were still in captivity and
[1:29:19] you will find people dancing. You'll
[1:29:22] find people praising the Lord just like
[1:29:25] Paul and Silas did.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; And in their pain, in their chains, they
[1:29:30] continue to praise and I think the Lord
[1:29:33] was pleased with that.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; So that was the 2nd of November. We had
[1:29:37] the Thanksgiving service. Um, on the 9th
[1:29:40] of November, I had the privilege to
[1:29:42] speak at my father-in-law's church. Um,
[1:29:45] like I said, there many churches across
[1:29:47] Lagos and uh, the Lord gave us a
[1:29:49] message, Jesus is in your sheep, wake
[1:29:52] him up. An inspiration from the message
[1:29:55] brother preached called, uh, calling
[1:29:57] Jesus on the scene.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; And uh, we had testimonies from that
[1:30:01] service, people that came directly to
[1:30:03] say that the Lord spoke to them and uh,
[1:30:06] we're grateful for that. And on the
[1:30:08] 16th, just a day before we left, uh we
[1:30:10] had the privilege to speak at brother
[1:30:12] Daly's church. Brother Daly has been
[1:30:14] here um a few times. I was here in the
[1:30:17] summer. Um so we had the opportunity to
[1:30:20] speak for them. Brother Lee has about
[1:30:21] 250 people, I guess, in his church. Um
[1:30:25] and we spoke about uh for this cause,
[1:30:28] which I I think I took care in March, I
[1:30:31] guess. Um it turned out that there had
[1:30:34] been a wedding the night the the
[1:30:36] Saturday before and the couple were in
[1:30:37] church on the Sunday. I didn't even
[1:30:39] remember um until the day before and uh
[1:30:43] there were testimonies from that service
[1:30:45] as well. One other testimony I will
[1:30:47] bring from that service was so they will
[1:30:50] have morning morning service and evening
[1:30:52] service and uh the evening we were going
[1:30:54] to go say goodbye to our friends. So I
[1:30:56] told brother Dy that I will only take
[1:30:57] one service. I'm sorry. And as we're
[1:31:00] closing out the service, he really
[1:31:01] enjoyed what the Lord did. And he was
[1:31:04] saying like, I don't even know why you
[1:31:05] have to, you know, go somewhere else
[1:31:08] rather than taking the evening service.
[1:31:10] And he was like, you've got to come back
[1:31:11] next year. I said, well, we have no
[1:31:13] plans coming next year.
[1:31:16] Um, so the Lord had laid it in his heart
[1:31:19] to invite another brother to take the
[1:31:21] evening service. um when I told him I
[1:31:23] wasn't going to take it and uh his
[1:31:27] associate pastor is my good friend and
[1:31:29] and that night my friend texted me and
[1:31:32] said, "Have you listened to the evening
[1:31:33] service?" I said, "No." And he said,
[1:31:36] "You've got to listen to it. I'm going
[1:31:37] to send it to you." So he sent it to me
[1:31:40] and it turns out that the things that I
[1:31:44] didn't get a chance to get to,
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; that brother preached about it. The
[1:31:50] brother was he didn't his his title was
[1:31:53] nothing that had to do with marriage.
[1:31:55] His title was about prayer
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; but the Holy Spirit led him to talk
[1:31:59] about marriage. The Holy Spirit led him
[1:32:02] to take examples the same ones I took in
[1:32:04] the morning
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; to preach on it. So brother Daily came
[1:32:08] after the service and said well I as a
[1:32:10] man was thinking the same man needed to
[1:32:12] come but the Holy Spirit has as many men
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; and he knows how to use them.
[1:32:18] [snorts] So, thank you for your prayers.
[1:32:20] It was two weeks of being in Nigeria,
[1:32:22] but uh the Lord was gracious to us.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:32:26] praise this morning. [applause]
[1:32:35] All right, if you don't mind, let's be
[1:32:36] on our feet to go into the word for this
[1:32:39] morning.
[1:32:41] It's 13 minutes past 11.
[1:32:44] We're going to see how we will do this.
[1:32:49] and we're done by 12.
[1:32:52] We'll read first from Genesis chapter 1
[1:32:55] verse 26 to 28 and maybe you take your
[1:32:59] seat after so
[1:33:01] that I don't keep you standing for too
[1:33:03] long. I'll take my other context
[1:33:06] scriptures after
[1:33:09] Genesis 1:26-28.
[1:33:22] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[1:33:25] image, after our likeness, and let him
[1:33:28] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[1:33:30] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[1:33:32] the cattle, and over all the earth, and
[1:33:35] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:33:38] upon the earth. So God created man in
[1:33:41] his own image.
[1:33:44] In the image of God created he him, male
[1:33:47] and female created ye them." And God
[1:33:50] blessed them. And God said unto them,
[1:33:52] "Be fruitful and multiply."
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; And replenish the earth, and subdue it,
[1:33:58] and have dominion over the fish of the
[1:34:00] sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
[1:34:02] over every living thing that moveth upon
[1:34:07] the earth. You may have your seat for
[1:34:11] I was going to say for a little while,
[1:34:12] but we'll see.
[1:34:15] I'll go to the Psalms uh 1
[1:34:22] 7
[1:34:23] and I'll read from verse 3 to 5.
[1:34:30] It says, "Lo, children and are an
[1:34:33] heritage of the Lord and the fruit of
[1:34:35] the womb is his reward. As arrows are in
[1:34:39] the hand of a mighty man, so are
[1:34:41] children of the youths. Happy is the man
[1:34:44] that hath his quaver full of them.
[1:34:49] [laughter]
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Dependenca.
[1:34:55] You know when people come and like, "Oh,
[1:34:56] your quaver is not full yet." I'm like,
[1:34:58] "You don't know the size of my quaver."
[1:35:00] [laughter]
[1:35:02] [gasps]
[1:35:03] So depends on the size of your quaver.
[1:35:06] God will give you as many arrows.
[1:35:09] He said, "Happy is a man that has his
[1:35:11] quiver full of them. They shall not be
[1:35:13] ashamed, but they shall speak with the
[1:35:16] enemies in the gate.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; And very quickly, Ephesians chapter 6
[1:35:22] for from verse 1 to three.
[1:35:26] Ephesians
[1:35:40] 6 verse 1-3.
[1:35:43] It says, "Children, obey your parents in
[1:35:45] the Lord, for this is right. Honor thy
[1:35:48] father and mother, which is the first
[1:35:51] commandment, with promise, that it may
[1:35:55] be well with thee, thou mayest live long
[1:35:59] on the earth. Let's just have a word of
[1:36:01] prayer.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Dear father, we are grateful once again
[1:36:04] for the privilege to be here.
[1:36:07] We've given a report of what you did and
[1:36:10] we know that Lord that will bring faith
[1:36:14] and strength Lord Jesus that we never
[1:36:17] want that kind of situation but many
[1:36:19] other situations in our lives that we go
[1:36:22] through that we'll know that if we can
[1:36:24] just pray then you will answer.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; We ask you bless your word this morning.
[1:36:30] Speak to us Lord Jesus in your own way
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; and let the glory and honor be thine at
[1:36:35] the end of the service. Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:36:41] Amen.
[1:36:43] So I guess the last time I was here I
[1:36:46] the Lord gave us a message about
[1:36:48] parenting
[1:36:49] and someone must have been praying. I
[1:36:52] don't know if it's the parents that were
[1:36:53] praying like Lord this was really spicy.
[1:36:57] Can you give my kids something to or
[1:37:00] maybe the kids praying like Lord you
[1:37:01] spoke to the parents will you speak with
[1:37:04] me as well? So right after this that
[1:37:08] service uh this thought came into my
[1:37:10] heart and uh I just trusted that the
[1:37:13] Lord would give us an opportunity as his
[1:37:16] own appointed time and uh he pleased the
[1:37:18] Lord that it is right now. So kids, the
[1:37:22] Lord is thinking about giving you your
[1:37:24] Christmas present
[1:37:26] just before Christmas.
[1:37:28] I want to speak this morning on a title,
[1:37:31] the first commandment with promise.
[1:37:34] Amen.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; The first commandment with promise but
[1:37:38] said in the message leadership speaking
[1:37:40] to children he said you know Jesus loves
[1:37:44] little children
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; you know he does and there was a little
[1:37:48] boy one time named Moses we're going to
[1:37:51] talk about him in just a little bit and
[1:37:53] he was a very fine you know what made
[1:37:56] him helped make him a fine boy he had a
[1:38:00] good mother to raise him See that's what
[1:38:05] she taught him about the Lord. And you
[1:38:08] little boys and girls has got the same
[1:38:10] kind of mothers to raise you, teach you
[1:38:13] about the Lord.
[1:38:16] Just mind them.
[1:38:19] So children, brother Abraham is saying,
[1:38:21] mind your parents.
[1:38:24] You know what? You know what the first
[1:38:26] commandment is in the Bible? The first
[1:38:28] commandment with promise. with a
[1:38:30] promise. Maybe a little hard for you to
[1:38:33] understand this commandment. The first
[1:38:35] commandment is not to have any other god
[1:38:37] but him. But the great commandment, the
[1:38:39] first commandment that has a promise to
[1:38:41] it, see, is to the children.
[1:38:45] Did you know that? He said, "Children,
[1:38:48] obey your parents, which may lengthen
[1:38:51] the days upon the earth that the Lord
[1:38:53] thy God has given thee to mind your
[1:38:56] parents and do what you're doing. It may
[1:38:59] give you longer life upon the earth
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; that the Lord has given you more time to
[1:39:07] serve him.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; I hope today that I'm making I'm looking
[1:39:11] at a bunch of preachers and singers and
[1:39:15] evangelists of the day that is to come.
[1:39:18] If there is a day after ours.
[1:39:22] So, brother Abraham was saying there is
[1:39:25] you are the future. You children today
[1:39:28] are the future. I was anytime I'm in the
[1:39:31] pastor's room, my eyes will just go to
[1:39:34] that picture that was taken. I can't
[1:39:36] remember where it was. I I wasn't here.
[1:39:38] Um it it was 12 years ago. 12 years ago.
[1:39:43] Anyone that is below 12 years that was
[1:39:46] here at that time was not born yet. But
[1:39:49] if you look at those that were there,
[1:39:50] I'm looking at Andy, [laughter]
[1:39:53] they looked so tiny.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. And if you look at even the
[1:39:58] adults, they look younger than they look
[1:40:01] now. But 12 years has come and gone. And
[1:40:05] gradually the children of that time are
[1:40:09] becoming the adults of today. That's
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; So that means that at that time we could
[1:40:15] say that they are the future.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Because that is the future of the past
[1:40:19] is today. Amen.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ram is saying that I'm
[1:40:22] looking at a bunch of preachers and
[1:40:24] singers and evangelists of that of the
[1:40:26] day that is to come if there's a day
[1:40:28] after ours. But that is dependent on how
[1:40:31] the children listens and obeys their
[1:40:35] parents.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Now I want to start with the fact that
[1:40:40] it was God's design.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; That they are parents and that there are
[1:40:46] children. It was God's design that
[1:40:49] parents will have children. We read in
[1:40:52] Genesis 1, the Lord said, "Be fruitful
[1:40:55] after he made man." Remember, he made
[1:40:58] the spirit man. He had not yet created
[1:41:00] flesh for him. And he said, "Be fruitful
[1:41:02] and multiply
[1:41:04] and replenish the earth." So God was
[1:41:07] saying that I want you to have children.
[1:41:11] Now God made Adam and Eve, he made them
[1:41:13] as adults. God could have used the same
[1:41:16] process to make the rest of us. But it
[1:41:18] was God's design that man and woman will
[1:41:22] come together to have children. Now, why
[1:41:25] did God give us parents?
[1:41:29] According to the scripture, the first
[1:41:31] reason is that God gave us parents to
[1:41:34] train us up. That's why the wisest king
[1:41:39] told us in Proverbs, he said, "Train up
[1:41:42] a child in the way that he should go
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; and when he is old, he will not depart
[1:41:49] from it." Now, training or training up
[1:41:52] will also mean to initiate or to
[1:41:56] discipline.
[1:41:58] Sometimes when you use the word
[1:41:59] initiate,
[1:42:01] you understand it better when it comes
[1:42:04] to the point of view of cults.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; When you talk about initiation,
[1:42:15] it's a process to make someone who's not
[1:42:19] a member of a cult to become a member of
[1:42:22] that cult. In becoming a member, there
[1:42:25] are rules. in becoming a member. There
[1:42:28] are things they do. There are ways to
[1:42:30] behave. And the word the the the the the
[1:42:34] Hebrew word that was used for train up
[1:42:37] which you'll pronounce as chanak
[1:42:40] also translates to initiate.
[1:42:45] Now I'm not saying that we must
[1:42:46] indoctrinate our children. But the
[1:42:49] responsibility that God gave parents
[1:42:52] over your children is to bring you up in
[1:42:56] a way that they tell you the values that
[1:42:59] they want you to um um incure in your
[1:43:02] life, the values to embibe in your life,
[1:43:05] the way you should live your life. And
[1:43:07] brother prefaced it by saying that Moses
[1:43:10] had a godly mother. And because Moses
[1:43:13] had a godly mother, the godly mother was
[1:43:15] going to train Moses up or did train
[1:43:18] Moses up in the way of the Lord. So you
[1:43:21] have a responsibility
[1:43:24] to obey your parents because God has
[1:43:26] given them a responsibility to bring you
[1:43:29] up.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Now, as we're thinking about this as
[1:43:32] adults, we are also children of God.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; So we can also apply that to us as God's
[1:43:36] children.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. The second reason why God gave us
[1:43:40] parents, the second responsibility that
[1:43:43] God gave parents over us children is
[1:43:46] that our parents are to diligently teach
[1:43:49] us God's word. Now you remember that God
[1:43:53] will have his first church. Brother said
[1:43:55] the first church was Israel coming out
[1:43:57] of Egypt journeying to the promised
[1:43:59] land. And as they came out of Egypt, it
[1:44:02] got to a point where God started to give
[1:44:04] them instructions. Now you are a church.
[1:44:07] A church must have order. A church must
[1:44:09] have conduct. A church must have
[1:44:11] doctrine. They were God's people in
[1:44:14] Egypt. But brother said that when they
[1:44:16] came out of Egypt, they became God's
[1:44:18] church. And that's how God started to
[1:44:21] give them instructions on how they must
[1:44:24] behave, how they must live together,
[1:44:26] what they allowed to do, what they are
[1:44:28] not allowed to do. Now God knowing that
[1:44:31] he did not just want that for that
[1:44:34] single generation gave the parents a
[1:44:37] responsibility to diligently teach their
[1:44:41] children God's word. So he tells us in
[1:44:44] Deuteronomy he said here oh Israel the
[1:44:47] Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt
[1:44:50] love the Lord thy God with all thine
[1:44:52] heart and with all thy soul and with all
[1:44:55] thy might. And this word which I
[1:44:58] commandest this day, I command thee this
[1:45:02] day shall be in thine heart. Now the
[1:45:05] parents have the responsibility to make
[1:45:07] sure that the word is in their heart.
[1:45:10] But he did not stop there. He said,
[1:45:12] "Thou shalt teach them diligently unto
[1:45:16] thy children." So when your parents
[1:45:19] gather you together and have a family
[1:45:22] devotion and they're going through a
[1:45:24] Bible study, they are doing exactly what
[1:45:27] God wants them to do.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; And children, we must not take that for
[1:45:31] granted.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "Thou shalt and shall talk of
[1:45:36] them when thou sitest in thine house,
[1:45:38] and when thou walkest by the way, and
[1:45:41] when thou liest down, and when thou
[1:45:44] riseest up." If you start to think about
[1:45:46] this, it gets to a point you start to
[1:45:48] ask yourself, is it all about the word
[1:45:50] of God? Maybe your parents will remind
[1:45:53] you what the word of God said in every
[1:45:56] situation. Maybe about school, maybe
[1:45:58] about your diligence with school work.
[1:46:00] They will always point back to the word
[1:46:02] of God. And you're like, why do you
[1:46:04] spiritualize everything? They are just
[1:46:06] doing what God said they should do.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. He said, you
[1:46:11] shall diligently take them to your
[1:46:12] children. You will talk of them when you
[1:46:15] are sitting down in your house. You will
[1:46:18] talk of them when you are walking by the
[1:46:20] way, taking a walk, taking the your dog
[1:46:22] on a walk with your parents and they
[1:46:24] start to tell you about the Bible.
[1:46:26] That's exactly what God said they should
[1:46:28] do. And when thou liest down, maybe
[1:46:30] you're young, your parents come and you
[1:46:32] say, "I want I want you to tell me a
[1:46:34] story, a bedtime story." And daddy says,
[1:46:36] "I'm going to tell you about Moses."
[1:46:39] Said, "No, I want to know about Harry
[1:46:40] Potter.
[1:46:44] But God said they should tell you the
[1:46:46] same things you hear in church even when
[1:46:48] you're lying down.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; And when you rise up, we wake up in the
[1:46:53] morning. We gather the children together
[1:46:56] at breakfast table. We tell them about
[1:46:58] the word. Parents are only doing what
[1:47:01] God said they should do. He said, "And
[1:47:04] thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy
[1:47:06] hand." Why? So that they remember
[1:47:11] it could be bracelets on their hand was
[1:47:13] what the Lord was saying just to keep it
[1:47:16] right in front of them every time. And
[1:47:19] they shall be as frontless between thy h
[1:47:22] thine thine eyes and thou shall write
[1:47:24] them upon the post of thy house and on
[1:47:27] the gates.
[1:47:29] In Isaiah he said and all thy children
[1:47:31] shall be taught of the Lord and great
[1:47:34] shall be the peace of thy children.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God-given parents the
[1:47:39] responsibility to diligently teach the
[1:47:42] children the word of God. When you talk
[1:47:45] about diligent, it means it's
[1:47:47] continuous. It means it's intentional.
[1:47:49] It means that they never give up on
[1:47:51] doing it.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Even when you don't smile.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Another responsibility that God gave
[1:48:00] parents is they are to provide for our
[1:48:02] needs.
[1:48:04] First Timothy,
[1:48:06] Peter, Paul was saying to Timothy, he
[1:48:08] said, "But if any provide not for his
[1:48:10] own, and especially for those of his own
[1:48:12] house, he had denied the faith and is
[1:48:15] worse than an infidel."
[1:48:19] So we know that
[1:48:22] actually the story here was it had to do
[1:48:24] with widows in the church who were like
[1:48:29] very dependent on the church and and uh
[1:48:32] it was becoming a financial problem or a
[1:48:35] financial management problem in the
[1:48:36] church and and Paul was saying that
[1:48:39] people that can take care of their
[1:48:42] family members who are widows should do
[1:48:45] it
[1:48:47] right. But
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; though that was the context,
[1:48:52] this still covers providing for the
[1:48:55] family.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Because he didn't say widow, he said for
[1:49:00] his own.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Which means his children, his extended
[1:49:04] family, his nuclear family. So God has
[1:49:07] given our parents as children the
[1:49:10] responsibility to take care of us as
[1:49:12] well as they can. Brother Abraham
[1:49:15] advised parents. He said, "Make your
[1:49:18] home so sweet that your children can
[1:49:22] bring their friends to the house."
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; I'd rather for my kids, I'd rather their
[1:49:30] friends come for the play date in my
[1:49:31] house
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; than for
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; me to take them to their friend's house
[1:49:36] on the play date
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; just so that they in the right
[1:49:39] atmosphere.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:49:42] Now, our parents correct us
[1:49:46] and we're going to get to it. It is
[1:49:48] naturally difficult at certain age
[1:49:53] to
[1:49:55] appreciate the correction.
[1:49:58] I won't say to take the correction. I'll
[1:50:00] say appreciate the correction because
[1:50:02] sometimes you take the correction but
[1:50:03] you don't appreciate it.
[1:50:06] Now, Proverbs tells us the importance of
[1:50:10] responding to correction.
[1:50:13] I'm speaking slowly because I'm speaking
[1:50:15] to children.
[1:50:16] So, I'm trying not to preach. I'm trying
[1:50:18] to just have it as a conversation. I do
[1:50:21] want to be here and they there, right?
[1:50:23] Let's be at the same level
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; as we go through the word.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Everyone loves the Lord this morning.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; So, the wisest king
[1:50:35] advises us children.
[1:50:38] He is in the way of life that keepeth
[1:50:40] instruction,
[1:50:42] but he that refuseth reprove er that is
[1:50:47] going in the wrong way.
[1:50:50] And then he also told us in Proverbs 15,
[1:50:52] he said, "A fool despiseth his father's
[1:50:55] instruction,
[1:50:56] but he that regardeth reprove is
[1:50:58] prudent." And prudent means smart,
[1:51:02] right?
[1:51:04] So sometimes
[1:51:06] you actually feel that listening to your
[1:51:09] parents is not smart but listening to
[1:51:12] your parents the Bible say is smart.
[1:51:15] Now you realize as you know people do
[1:51:19] normal observation of how children grow
[1:51:22] up in life and we use our own personal
[1:51:25] um examples that um for a son the view
[1:51:29] of
[1:51:31] the father or or his point of view of
[1:51:34] his father changes as he grows up. So
[1:51:38] you often find that they say that at two
[1:51:40] years old
[1:51:42] uh a 2-year-old will believe that daddy
[1:51:44] knows everything
[1:51:46] and by the time he's five he feels daddy
[1:51:49] knows a lot.
[1:51:51] By the time he's 10
[1:51:54] he starts to realize that daddy doesn't
[1:51:56] know everything.
[1:51:58] At 15
[1:52:01] daddy doesn't know anything.
[1:52:05] At 18, dad becomes old-fashioned.
[1:52:10] At 25,
[1:52:12] well, dad knows a little, but times have
[1:52:15] changed.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; And at 35,
[1:52:19] then perspective starts to change. Oh,
[1:52:21] before we decide, let's ask dad,
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; At 50,
[1:52:29] what will dad have thought? Amen.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Most of the time at 50 that is probably
[1:52:36] very old or that has passed.
[1:52:39] At 60
[1:52:42] that knew everything.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; And at 70, I wish I could talk to that
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; one more time.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; That did not change.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; It was the point of view of that child
[1:52:59] that changed.
[1:53:01] Amen.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; A pastor was talking the other Wednesday
[1:53:03] about perspectives
[1:53:05] and that was so profound because I was
[1:53:08] thinking about it. If we are looking at
[1:53:11] something from different positions,
[1:53:15] we'll have a different point of views.
[1:53:19] You might have a point of view that does
[1:53:23] not adequately describe what you're
[1:53:25] looking at. It's not an illusion. You
[1:53:29] just need to change your position to a
[1:53:31] place where you have an adequate
[1:53:33] knowledge of what you're looking at.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; It also happens with girls. At four
[1:53:41] years old, they believe mom can do
[1:53:43] anything. At 8 years old, oh, mom knows
[1:53:47] a lot. A whole lot.
[1:53:50] At 12, they realize mom doesn't know
[1:53:53] everything.
[1:53:55] At 14, teenage. Oh, mom is so mom is so
[1:53:59] embarrassing.
[1:54:02] At [snorts] 18, mom is out of touch with
[1:54:05] reality.
[1:54:06] At 25,
[1:54:09] mom might know a few things.
[1:54:12] At 30,
[1:54:14] maybe I should call mom before I decide.
[1:54:18] At 40,
[1:54:20] how will mom handle this?
[1:54:23] At 50,
[1:54:25] I finally understand mom.
[1:54:29] At 60,
[1:54:31] mom was right about almost everything.
[1:54:36] And at 70, I wish I could talk to mom
[1:54:39] again.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:44] We realize that our youthful years
[1:54:48] are the most
[1:54:51] critical times of our lives.
[1:54:55] God is interested in those years, but so
[1:54:58] is the devil.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Because those are the years where we
[1:55:04] become shaped.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; That is what determines for most people
[1:55:08] who they will become
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; later on in life. And that's why the
[1:55:13] wisest king again says, "Remember now
[1:55:15] thy creator in the days of thy youth,
[1:55:19] while the evil days come not."
[1:55:22] Because evil days are going to come when
[1:55:25] you hardly have time for yourself.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; When you hardly have time for anything
[1:55:30] else.
[1:55:33] It's easier to have a better prayer life
[1:55:37] as an unmarried young person that has no
[1:55:40] responsibility, no bills to pay
[1:55:43] than when life starts to happen.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; And I know a lot of kids like to be
[1:55:51] adults as fast as possible, but if you
[1:55:55] have not heard the news, adulting is
[1:55:59] scam.
[1:56:02] is real scam.
[1:56:05] I want to pay my bills. I want to have
[1:56:07] my house. You know, our kids many times
[1:56:09] will have their conversations. Just
[1:56:11] reminds me of how we used to think back
[1:56:13] in the day.
[1:56:15] And oh, I want to have this. I'm like,
[1:56:17] okay, you can have it when you have your
[1:56:19] own house. I'm going to I'm going to do
[1:56:21] this. I'm going to have this. Right? You
[1:56:23] you it's natural because God has put us
[1:56:26] put something in us that desires to
[1:56:28] grow.
[1:56:29] But remember, it's not going to get
[1:56:31] easier.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; That's the reality.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; It's not going to get easier.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; I feel like I am at what they call
[1:56:41] middle age. And I think about middle age
[1:56:44] as the peak,
[1:56:46] right? For those that don't know, I'm
[1:56:48] 45. So middle age means
[1:56:53] you can see childhood and growing up
[1:56:57] days as well as you can see growing old
[1:57:02] and that's where crisis happens
[1:57:05] because you start to see that you are
[1:57:07] now getting to the declining state of
[1:57:10] life
[1:57:11] where things start to gradually go down.
[1:57:15] You have so many years to work,
[1:57:18] yet you're looking at your mortgage and
[1:57:20] asking yourself, "When am I going to get
[1:57:22] it paid off?" You see your kids growing,
[1:57:26] but you also see your parents growing
[1:57:27] older.
[1:57:29] And if you are sincere with yourself,
[1:57:32] might not take too long for that and mom
[1:57:35] to go if they are still alive. So, it
[1:57:37] puts a lot of pressure.
[1:57:41] So the point is when you're younger, you
[1:57:44] have a huge opportunity.
[1:57:47] When you want to, if you want to pick up
[1:57:49] a skill, you can do it better when
[1:57:52] you're younger.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; If you want to learn a musical
[1:57:56] instrument, you want to get into sports,
[1:57:57] you have more time when you're younger.
[1:58:01] So God is saying, "I need your youthful
[1:58:03] days." But remember, Satan is also
[1:58:06] saying, "I need your youthful days."
[1:58:07] Amen.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Now, we can look at examples in the
[1:58:11] scriptures of young people that had to
[1:58:14] make decisions, but I want to just point
[1:58:17] us to one
[1:58:19] for the sake of time. One, let's look at
[1:58:22] the life of Esau.
[1:58:25] Now, Esau was one of the twin boys,
[1:58:28] right? It was Esau and Jacob that were
[1:58:31] born to Isaac and Rebecca. These were
[1:58:34] children that God had foretold. Rebecca
[1:58:36] knew that she had this two children
[1:58:38] coming. God had given her a foresight of
[1:58:40] who they were going to be. The the the
[1:58:43] older shall serve the younger. She she
[1:58:45] already knew that. And then this
[1:58:47] children were born. And the Bible would
[1:58:50] tell us in Genesis 25, he said, "And the
[1:58:52] boys grew, and Esau was a cunning
[1:58:56] hunter, a man of the field, and Jacob
[1:58:59] was a plain man dwelling in tents." So
[1:59:02] they had two personalities, two
[1:59:04] different personalities.
[1:59:06] And Isaac loved Esau. And the Bible
[1:59:09] tells us why. Because he did eat of his
[1:59:12] venison.
[1:59:16] The venison was the reason why he loved
[1:59:19] him. But Rebecca loved Jacob.
[1:59:23] Bible didn't tell us why. But we know
[1:59:25] that J Rebecca had the revelation
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; of those kids. The Lord showed it to
[1:59:31] her.
[1:59:32] And Jacob sought pottage, and Esau came
[1:59:36] from the field, and he was faint.
[1:59:42] Therefore was his name called Edom. And
[1:59:45] Jacob said, "Sell me this day thy
[1:59:48] birthright."
[1:59:50] So Esau came, he was hungry,
[1:59:56] his body wanted something,
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; right? Right?
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; His body wanted something.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; He had a desire.
[2:00:06] But the problem was he did not think
[2:00:10] [snorts]
[2:00:11] before he let go was more important than
[2:00:15] the desire he had at the moment.
[2:00:19] And Isa said, "Behold, I am at the point
[2:00:21] to die. And what profit shall this
[2:00:24] birthright do me?"
[2:00:29] Now the birthright
[2:00:31] inside the birthright was the blessing.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; The blessing was meant for who had the
[2:00:37] birthright.
[2:00:39] Now he wasn't sincere with himself by
[2:00:41] saying that if I don't eat right now I'm
[2:00:43] going to die.
[2:00:46] Anyone ever got hungry to the point of
[2:00:48] like if I don't eat right I'm going to
[2:00:50] die.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's more of thirst. But the
[2:00:53] reality is there will be an alternative.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; You've got to measure it. Now, Esau, he
[2:01:00] despised the birthright. The Bible told
[2:01:02] us that he despised it. When you despise
[2:01:04] something, that means you undervalue
[2:01:07] that thing.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; We've heard many times the birthright
[2:01:15] today is equivalent to the Holy Ghost.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; So, when you undervalue the Holy Ghost,
[2:01:21] you are doing exactly what Esau did.
[2:01:23] That's
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[2:01:25] And many times why do we undervalue the
[2:01:27] Holy Ghost is for the things that please
[2:01:29] our flesh.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Why did I not get saved
[2:01:35] when I was 12 years old?" He said, "The
[2:01:38] devil hung over my shoulder telling me,
[2:01:42] wait a little longer.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; You're too young to get saved. You're
[2:01:47] too young to get the Holy Ghost. Enjoy
[2:01:49] your life just a little bit more."
[2:01:52] So, Esau made that decision because he
[2:01:55] wanted the pleasure of a moment.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; And Jacob said, "Swear to me this day."
[2:02:00] And he swore unto him. And he sold his
[2:02:02] birthright unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave
[2:02:04] Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he
[2:02:08] did eat and drink and rose up and went
[2:02:10] his way. The Bible said, "Thus Esau
[2:02:13] despised
[2:02:15] his birthright."
[2:02:17] Now we see that this problem
[2:02:20] already started from the garden of Eden.
[2:02:23] The problem of a pleasure, the pleasure
[2:02:27] of a moment of instant gratification.
[2:02:30] And that started with the first mother
[2:02:33] Eve.
[2:02:35] The Bible told us that when the serpent
[2:02:39] offered her the fruit of the tree,
[2:02:42] the Bible said, "And when the woman saw
[2:02:44] that the tree was good for food,
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; number one,
[2:02:51] and that it was pleasant to the eyes,
[2:02:55] number two,
[2:02:57] and a tree to be desired to make one
[2:03:00] wise."
[2:03:03] So, three things that made our fall,
[2:03:08] the lust of the eyes,
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; the lust of the flesh,
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; and the pride of life.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; So good for food lost of the flesh
[2:03:19] satisfies the flesh.
[2:03:22] Pleasant to the eyes, lost of the eyes.
[2:03:26] and a tree to be desired to make one
[2:03:29] wise.
[2:03:31] The pride of life
[2:03:33] to be wiser than God.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; That's what this devil was selling to
[2:03:38] her.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; She didn't realize it.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; And many times you can think that is far
[2:03:43] off. But anytime you step over the word
[2:03:46] of God and expect a different result,
[2:03:50] the devil is trying to make you think
[2:03:52] you are wiser than God.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:56] Amen.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Now, Esau went on like that. He had
[2:04:02] dropped the birth right. He had despised
[2:04:04] it. And the Bible would tell us that
[2:04:07] when he was 40 years old,
[2:04:10] he took to wife Judith, the daughter of
[2:04:12] Barry the Heatite,
[2:04:15] and Bashmath, the daughter of Elon the
[2:04:18] Heatite.
[2:04:19] The Bible said which were a grieve of
[2:04:22] mind unto Isaac and Rebecca.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; So he despised the birthight which is
[2:04:31] the Holy Ghost. When he got to the point
[2:04:33] of marriage, he got it wrong.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Disobedience.
[2:04:45] Now, if you remember,
[2:04:49] God called Abraham out of his kindred,
[2:04:52] out of his father's land, told him to
[2:04:55] take a journey to the land of Canaan,
[2:04:57] and he said, "I'm going to give you this
[2:04:59] land."
[2:05:02] Why was God going to give Canaan to
[2:05:05] Abraham?
[2:05:07] Because the people of Canaan were evil
[2:05:10] in the eyes of the Lord.
[2:05:13] Now they came from a different lineage.
[2:05:15] If you trace it back, they came from
[2:05:17] Ham, the same man that despised his
[2:05:20] father
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; and saw his father naked.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; So when it was time for Isaac to get
[2:05:29] married, Abraham will call the chief
[2:05:32] servant of his house, Eleazar, and tell
[2:05:34] Elezah to go back to his father's
[2:05:37] family.
[2:05:39] go back to Abraham's family where he
[2:05:41] came from and get a wife. Says, "Swear
[2:05:44] to me that you will not get a wife from
[2:05:46] here."
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; That's why Elazar had to go sought for a
[2:05:51] wife from the same lineage as Abraham.
[2:06:00] Now,
[2:06:02] Esau
[2:06:05] did what was contrary to that
[2:06:07] commandment.
[2:06:11] And when he did that,
[2:06:13] he became
[2:06:16] a weariness
[2:06:18] to his parents. The Bible said they were
[2:06:20] grie they were which were a grief of
[2:06:22] mine unto Isaac and Rebecca. When you
[2:06:24] get to chapter 27, and Rebecca said to
[2:06:28] Isaac, I am weary of my life
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; because of the daughters of those are
[2:06:35] the daughters of the the Hittites. If
[2:06:38] Jacob take a wife of the daughters of
[2:06:41] such as this, which are of the daughters
[2:06:43] of the land, what good shall my life do
[2:06:47] me?" So at this point we find that Jacob
[2:06:52] has already gotten the blessing by
[2:06:55] deceiving his father
[2:06:58] and Esau was going to kill Jacob. But
[2:07:01] this was the time when Rebecca was also
[2:07:04] telling Jacob to run away.
[2:07:08] But she brought a very vital reason
[2:07:12] why Jacob must not be allowed to marry
[2:07:16] from the women of the land.
[2:07:18] Now, the phrase weary of my life is an
[2:07:21] Hebrew expression of deep distress.
[2:07:25] It wasn't meaning that she wanted to
[2:07:27] kill herself. She was tired of life.
[2:07:29] That was not what it meant. But she was
[2:07:31] grieved of the possible loss of Jacob,
[2:07:36] not only physically, but spiritually if
[2:07:40] Jacob were to marry from the women of
[2:07:43] the land.
[2:07:45] Now, when this happened,
[2:07:49] we find that
[2:07:51] Esau tried to fix things.
[2:07:56] 28 Genesis 28 says, "And Isaac called
[2:07:59] Jacob and blessed him, and charged him,
[2:08:01] and said unto him, thou shalt not take a
[2:08:04] wife of the daughters of Canaan. Arise,
[2:08:06] go to Padan Aram to the house of Bethl,
[2:08:09] thy mother's father, and take the a wife
[2:08:12] from then of the daughters of Laban, thy
[2:08:14] mother's brother. And God Almighty bless
[2:08:17] thee, and make thee fruitful, and
[2:08:20] multiply thee, that thou mayest be a
[2:08:22] multitude of people, and give thee the
[2:08:25] blessing of Abraham to thee, and to thy
[2:08:27] seed with thee, that thou mayest inherit
[2:08:29] the land wherein thou art a stranger,
[2:08:31] which God gave unto Abraham. And Isaac
[2:08:34] sent away Jacob, and he went to
[2:08:36] Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethwell,
[2:08:38] the Syrian, the brother of Rebecca,
[2:08:40] Jacob's, and Esau's mother.
[2:08:44] And when and Esau when Esau saw that
[2:08:47] Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him
[2:08:49] away to Padanaram to take him a wife
[2:08:51] from then, and that as he blessed him,
[2:08:55] he gave him a charge, saying, "Thou
[2:08:56] shalt not take a wife of the daughters
[2:08:59] of Canaan." and that Jacob obeyed his
[2:09:03] father and his mother.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; See obedience there.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; The one who was the deceiver, the
[2:09:12] sunplanter,
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; he had a weakness in the flesh.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Yet he obeyed.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Because his deliverance was tied to the
[2:09:22] obedience.
[2:09:27] Boys and girls, as you grow older,
[2:09:30] you'll have your struggles.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to tell you that
[2:09:34] everything will be fine.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to tell you that you not
[2:09:37] do things that
[2:09:39] you know your parents have said you
[2:09:40] should not do that you're ashamed of and
[2:09:42] things like, but just continue to obey.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; I had a friend that we grew up together.
[2:09:49] I like to bring his testimony.
[2:09:52] Many times when I talk about this, he's
[2:09:53] currently a pastor in the UK.
[2:09:56] This brother at some point in his life
[2:09:58] was addicted to drugs and smoking and
[2:10:01] all of that and he was we were all
[2:10:04] living in Nigeria and we all knew that
[2:10:06] he was into stuff. He was even as far as
[2:10:09] getting into diabolical stuff
[2:10:12] and he said there are times he would
[2:10:13] have smoked weed.
[2:10:16] Maybe it's a Wednesday night
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; and he will come to church still. And he
[2:10:21] had one prayer request and that prayer
[2:10:23] request was God give me revelation.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Now God answered that prayer when he
[2:10:31] left the temp the the the tropical warm
[2:10:34] weather of Nigeria and moved to the
[2:10:37] temperate UK where he gets really cold
[2:10:40] and God delivered him from the demon of
[2:10:42] smoking.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he knew that the answer was
[2:10:47] in revelation. Amen.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; The answer was in obedience.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Jacob obeyed his father and his mother
[2:10:53] and was going to pardon a ram. And Esau
[2:10:55] seeing that the daughters of Canaan
[2:10:57] pleased not Isaac his father.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; So that means that when he was going to
[2:11:02] get married, he did not even go ask his
[2:11:04] parents,
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; right,
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; for their opinion
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; or for their counsel or for their
[2:11:10] guidance.
[2:11:12] He just went after his own heart
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; just the same way he did with the
[2:11:16] birthright.
[2:11:19] Then when Esau then went Esau unto
[2:11:22] Ishmael, and took unto the wives which
[2:11:25] he had, Mahalath, the daughter of
[2:11:28] Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of
[2:11:31] Neboth, to be his wife. [snorts] Now we
[2:11:34] see three categories of women here. We
[2:11:38] see the Canaanites, right, in the land.
[2:11:41] Then we see the daughter of Ishmael.
[2:11:46] But who was the mother of Ishmael?
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Can remind me.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Aar, right? Where was Aar from?
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Egypt.
[2:11:58] So Ishmael was
[2:12:01] a hybrid.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Although he was the son of Abraham, but
[2:12:06] he was a hybrid.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; And then the sec the third category will
[2:12:10] be Abraham's family.
[2:12:12] So we have believers
[2:12:15] make believers and unbelievers.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Many times we talk about how you should
[2:12:20] not marry an unbeliever.
[2:12:23] But let me also remind you there are
[2:12:26] make believers in the church.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; And it's as bad as marrying an
[2:12:32] unbeliever if you marry a makeeliever.
[2:12:34] Right.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; A young brother asked me a question when
[2:12:40] we were in Nigeria and said, "What do
[2:12:43] you think, brother Toby?" Brother Ram
[2:12:44] said, "Marry who believes." Marry
[2:12:46] someone that believes what you believe.
[2:12:48] We have different
[2:12:51] understandings of the message,
[2:12:54] different doctrinal differences. So who
[2:12:57] is the person that believes what you
[2:12:59] believe?
[2:13:01] So I started by telling him that that
[2:13:03] advice that brother gave is applicable
[2:13:08] not just for people in the message.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; It is applicable generally when you
[2:13:14] think about marriage and what comes with
[2:13:17] it.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; If you're not on the same page with the
[2:13:21] person you're married to, you are
[2:13:23] setting up yourself for failure.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; So when brother said marry someone that
[2:13:31] believes what you believe, that's why
[2:13:33] there is
[2:13:35] the phase of courtship
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; where you get to know this person, know
[2:13:42] their family, know where they came from,
[2:13:45] know what they were brought up with,
[2:13:48] know their belief system,
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; regardless of whether they're in a
[2:13:51] message church or not.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then check that with what you
[2:13:57] have been taught and what you believe.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; And as much as possible, take counsel.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Take counsel. Ask questions. Go to the
[2:14:09] pastor. Let him know what you're going
[2:14:11] through. Go to your parents. Ask
[2:14:14] questions because it will be easier
[2:14:19] when the storms come. Amen.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; I know that last year the Lord gave us a
[2:14:27] message that's we titled the definitive
[2:14:32] importance I guess of the foundation
[2:14:36] and I brought that from the parable that
[2:14:38] Jesus Christ gave of the wise men and
[2:14:41] the foolish men.
[2:14:44] Now, the wise man and the foolish man,
[2:14:46] if you read that story in Matthew, it
[2:14:49] tells you that there was a wise man that
[2:14:51] builds on the rock and then there was a
[2:14:55] foolish man that builds on the sand.
[2:14:58] And from that, if you think about it,
[2:15:01] the context will be that they built in
[2:15:03] two different locations,
[2:15:06] right? There was a location that was
[2:15:07] rock, there was another location that
[2:15:09] was sand, maybe by the seashore.
[2:15:13] But if you go to Luke chapter 6, I
[2:15:16] believe, let me see if I can find it.
[2:15:18] Otherwise, I'll just paraphrase.
[2:15:22] Luke chapter 6 explains it
[2:15:26] a different way. I won't say a different
[2:15:28] way, but just kind of throws more light
[2:15:30] to it. Luke chapter 6, I found it from
[2:15:33] verse
[2:15:35] 47. Let's read it together. Whosoever
[2:15:39] cometh to me and heareth my sayings
[2:15:42] endureth them. I will show you to whom
[2:15:45] he is like.
[2:15:48] It is like a man which built an house
[2:15:51] and did what?
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Digged deep
[2:15:57] and laid the foundation on a rock.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; So this tells us is the same location.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was just dependent on how
[2:16:07] deep
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; the duck
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; and what does rock signify?
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Revelation. Amen.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; So the revelation of how God intended
[2:16:23] marriage to be and how it should be
[2:16:25] approached is what differentiates the
[2:16:29] person who lays his marriage on the
[2:16:31] right foundation and the person who does
[2:16:34] not do the same.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; The person that says I don't have to
[2:16:40] listen to the counsel of my parents. I
[2:16:44] don't have to listen to the counsel of
[2:16:45] the word of God. This is too easy that
[2:16:48] they are making it. This is much more
[2:16:50] easier than they're making it. I can
[2:16:53] make this happen. I love this person and
[2:16:55] I'm going to go ahead. The Bible said
[2:16:57] the person is not digging deep enough.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; When the floods arose, the stream beat
[2:17:05] vehemently upon that house and could not
[2:17:08] shake it, for it was founded upon a
[2:17:11] rock. But he that heareth and doeth not
[2:17:13] is like a man that without a foundation
[2:17:17] without a revelation,
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; right? Built an house upon the earth
[2:17:23] against which the stream did beat
[2:17:25] vehemently and immediately it fell and
[2:17:28] the rain of that house was great.
[2:17:36] The ram told us as children to honor our
[2:17:40] parents while we have them because here
[2:17:44] we have no continuing city.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; He was given his own life story and
[2:17:51] in the message here we have no
[2:17:53] continuing city. He said, "And young
[2:17:55] people, remember if you are fortunate
[2:17:58] enough today to have a daddy and a
[2:18:00] mother living, love them. Honor them."
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; The hour will come when you'll think
[2:18:08] that they are the greatest people in the
[2:18:10] world.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; If you don't now,
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; There's a face in your life where your
[2:18:16] parents actually don't mean a lot to you
[2:18:19] because they're just those old folks.
[2:18:22] I went through it as well.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; But my testimony is not the same.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; I'm at the point where I don't think I
[2:18:30] want to do anything major without asking
[2:18:32] dad.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Because now I can see the wisdom
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; right
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; that he has
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; which some time ago I despised.
[2:18:47] But Rama said and some of this he said
[2:18:52] the hour we come where you think that
[2:18:54] they're the greatest people in the world
[2:18:55] if you don't now and don't never little
[2:18:57] fellows don't never give the slandering
[2:19:01] word
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; old man and old woman
[2:19:05] that's not the old man and old woman
[2:19:08] that's daddy and mother
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; in the time of Abraham that was the
[2:19:13] slandering words that was used for
[2:19:15] parents I don't know what's used today.
[2:19:18] But if the word is a slandering word,
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; don't use it on your parents.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; Don't take from what your classmates
[2:19:26] will do when they look down on their
[2:19:29] parents and just find some nicknames for
[2:19:31] their parents or some slandering words
[2:19:33] for their parents. Don't do that. But
[2:19:36] the Ram said that is daddy and mother.
[2:19:38] And some of these days when they go out
[2:19:40] of the room in the casket of flowers,
[2:19:44] you hear them lowered down in the
[2:19:46] ground. The pastors say ashes to ashes
[2:19:50] and dust. It won't be the old man then.
[2:19:53] The old woman, it'll be mother. You'll
[2:19:56] be ringing your hands and crying. Said,
[2:19:59] "That's right. Now, while she's leaving,
[2:20:04] give her her flowers now.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; And give daddy's flowers.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. And the best flower you
[2:20:11] could give them is obey them.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; The best flower you could give is obey
[2:20:18] them.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Even when their ideas look
[2:20:21] old-fashioned, still obey them. Even
[2:20:24] when you think they've not connected
[2:20:26] with the reality of the Gen Z's and the
[2:20:28] Gen Alphas, still obey them.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible told us there's nothing new
[2:20:34] under the sun.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; We thought a lot of things were new
[2:20:41] when we're growing up, but as you grow
[2:20:43] older, you realize actually there's
[2:20:45] nothing new.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. the advice that you that that you
[2:20:49] you you you did not take from your
[2:20:51] parents as an older person, you realize
[2:20:54] that that was to my heart. I wish I
[2:20:57] listened.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; And that's the first promise in the
[2:21:03] Bible. The first commandment with
[2:21:04] promise, honor thy father and mother,
[2:21:07] which may lengthen the days upon the
[2:21:10] earth that the Lord giveth thee.
[2:21:14] Now we talked about the challenge with
[2:21:16] obeying.
[2:21:18] The Bible made us to know that it's one
[2:21:21] of the spirits of the age.
[2:21:25] Paul was writing to Timothy. He said,
[2:21:26] "This also know that in the last days
[2:21:29] times shall come. For men shall be
[2:21:31] lovers of their own selves, covetous,
[2:21:33] boasters, proud blasphemers, disobedient
[2:21:37] to parents."
[2:21:40] So it's something that you have to
[2:21:43] fight.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Now anytime we are tempted
[2:21:49] the location
[2:21:52] of the beginning of that temptation is
[2:21:55] our minds.
[2:21:57] That's why brother Brown preached the
[2:21:59] message the greatest battle ever fought.
[2:22:02] And he said the location of that battle
[2:22:04] is in the mind.
[2:22:06] James was telling us that said, "Blessed
[2:22:08] is the man that endureth temptation,
[2:22:11] for when he is tried, he shall receive
[2:22:14] the crown of life,
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; which the Lord had promised to them that
[2:22:18] love him." Let no man say, "When he is
[2:22:20] tempted, I'm tempted of God, for God
[2:22:21] cannot be tempted with evil, neither
[2:22:24] tempted he any man." Let me just explain
[2:22:25] that very, very quickly. So he said,
[2:22:29] "The man that endureth temptation,"
[2:22:33] and then he used another word. He said
[2:22:36] when he is tried,
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; he shall receive the crown of life. So
[2:22:41] it's the same event,
[2:22:44] but where it's coming from is different.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; God will allow the devil to tempt you.
[2:22:52] And that temptation becomes a trial.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Now this is how you differentiate the
[2:22:58] weakness. The the the difference. The
[2:23:00] difference is based on the intent of
[2:23:03] where it's coming from. When Satan is
[2:23:05] tempting you, he wants you to fall.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; When God is trying you, God is putting
[2:23:11] you in the test with the notion that you
[2:23:14] are going to pass the test.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; So, he knows that he has trained you
[2:23:20] well enough.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; Remember the cheater, the Holy Spirit,
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; he's trained you well enough. He's
[2:23:25] giving you enough lessons to know that
[2:23:28] in this situation now, you got to calm
[2:23:30] down. But God inspired that person to
[2:23:33] speak rudely to you.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; Well, not God inspiring the person. God
[2:23:38] allowed the devil to inspire the person
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; because there's no evil that comes from
[2:23:42] God.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; Right. So God allows the devil just like
[2:23:46] the lying spirit.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Barry preached about it. The
[2:23:51] lying spirit had to come from where?
[2:23:53] From hell. Came into the presence of
[2:23:55] God. God had an assignment and God had
[2:23:57] to give it to the lying spirits to go do
[2:24:00] so that God's word can be fulfilled.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; So he's telling us here James that you
[2:24:04] cannot say God tempted me.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Now this is how temptation happens.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; He said but every man is tempted when
[2:24:14] he's drawn away of his own lust and
[2:24:17] enticed.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; It starts with that desire to have
[2:24:21] something. said, "Then when lust has
[2:24:23] conceived, it bringeth forth sin and
[2:24:25] sin. When it's finished, bringeth forth
[2:24:27] death." Let me read that in the
[2:24:28] amplified version.
[2:24:30] He said, "But each one is tempted when
[2:24:34] he's dragged away,
[2:24:37] enticed." When someone is enticing you,
[2:24:39] it's not actually what you want to do,
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; but the person is jingling a reward that
[2:24:46] you hardly can say no to.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; Look at this. This looks so nice. This
[2:24:52] is chocolate. You can't say no. And
[2:24:54] that's what the devil does,
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; It will bring it right before your face,
[2:24:58] tell you the benefit of it. Your entire
[2:25:01] body is saying, "Yes, I want. Yes, I
[2:25:02] want. Yes, I want." But then it's not
[2:25:05] good for you. That's
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:25:07] So he's telling us that when you are
[2:25:11] dragged away and enticed and baited to
[2:25:15] commit sin by your own worldly desire,
[2:25:21] the Adamic nature in you. So then when
[2:25:25] the illicit desire has conceived,
[2:25:29] it gives birth to sin and when sin runs
[2:25:33] its curse, it gives birth to death.
[2:25:38] Now, we've said all of these things, but
[2:25:41] I want to use the same words in closing.
[2:25:45] Yes, it's 5 minutes past 12. I'm
[2:25:46] closing.
[2:25:48] That Paul used in Hebrews when he said,
[2:25:51] "But beloved, we're persuaded better
[2:25:53] things of you."
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; And things that accompany salvation,
[2:25:59] though we thus speak. Amen.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; So we have brought this warning. We have
[2:26:06] brought the reminder
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; that God expects us to obey the first
[2:26:13] commandment with promise
[2:26:15] which is obeying our parents. God has
[2:26:18] been kind enough to give us godly
[2:26:20] parents. And we can have enough
[2:26:23] confidence not in them but in God that
[2:26:27] God had given them those
[2:26:28] responsibilities to train us up to
[2:26:30] diligently teach us the word of God and
[2:26:33] to provide for us that God will give
[2:26:35] them all they require
[2:26:38] to do that. Will our parents make
[2:26:40] mistakes? Yes, they will sometimes. But
[2:26:43] God will take care of it. All that God
[2:26:45] is looking for is for you to obey. Now,
[2:26:48] Brother Abraham told us, and I want you
[2:26:50] to always remember this regardless of
[2:26:52] what Satan tells you. Brother Abraham
[2:26:54] told us that you kids are the best kids
[2:26:57] in the world.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; Let me read that to you.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "I said to Brother Fred, his
[2:27:02] kids, why? They can just hear me say one
[2:27:06] thing that's wrong. They're ready to
[2:27:08] stop it right now, you see, and set with
[2:27:10] the highest respect
[2:27:13] instead of being a hot roden rambling
[2:27:16] around.
[2:27:18] When they hear you speak about the
[2:27:19] gospel, they are ready to sit right
[2:27:22] there and listen.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; You kids come to church with your
[2:27:27] parents knowing that you'll have to sit
[2:27:29] down maybe for an hour or two to listen
[2:27:32] to the word of God, and you still come.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:36] said, "Now I know we all want our kids
[2:27:39] is renegades and things like that, but
[2:27:41] we must stop that." Speaking to the
[2:27:42] parents, I believe that we must remember
[2:27:46] that these kids are the best kids in the
[2:27:49] world because they are our children and
[2:27:54] we claim them for God.
[2:27:58] [applause]
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; They're the best children.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; You are the best children. Amen.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; You might have your troubles. You might
[2:28:07] have difficulties. You might have things
[2:28:10] you're struggling with.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; But never let the devil tell you
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; anything different.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Each one of you as babies
[2:28:21] or as toddlers were brought forward and
[2:28:24] prayed for,
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; dedicated
[2:28:27] to the Lord,
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; initiated into his kingdom.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Though futuristic,
[2:28:37] but that sea germ that is inside of you,
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit is watching over it.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; And at the appointed time, he will fill
[2:28:45] you with the Holy Ghost.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what you go through, you
[2:28:49] just obey.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; Just obey. It might not make sense. It
[2:28:53] might not line up with what your friends
[2:28:55] are doing, what is in vogue, and things
[2:28:57] like that. You just obey. The Lord will
[2:29:00] lead you and you will have a wonderful
[2:29:03] life.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; I'll call the musicians. Let's be on our
[2:29:06] feet.
[2:29:15] I want us to sing the song as I invite
[2:29:17] the pastor. Where he leads me, I will
[2:29:20] follow.
[2:29:23] I'll go with him all the way.
[2:29:27] God wants us to do that as his children.
[2:29:31] Whether we adults or children,
[2:29:35] God wants us
[2:29:39] to follow him.
[2:29:42] I think it's is a different song.
[2:29:45] I can hear my savior calling. Thank you.
[2:29:48] That's the right one.
[2:29:52] I can hear [singing]
[2:29:56] my savior [music]
[2:30:00] calling.
[2:30:05] I can hear
[2:30:09] my savior
[2:30:12] calling.
[2:30:17] I can hear [music]
[2:30:20] [singing]
[2:30:21] my savior
[2:30:24] calling.
[2:30:26] What did he [music] say? Just take thy
[2:30:31] cross and
[2:30:34] follow
[2:30:37] for [singing]
[2:30:40] me. [music]
[2:30:41] Do you want to make the promise to him
[2:30:43] this afternoon? Where he [music] leads
[2:30:48] me, I
[2:30:52] will follow.
[2:30:54] [music]
[2:30:58] He [singing] leads
[2:31:01] me. [music]
[2:31:05] [singing]
[2:31:07] [music]
[2:31:09] [singing]
[2:31:14] I
[2:31:16] go far. [music and singing]
[2:31:19] I'll go with you.
[2:31:21] I'll go with you.
[2:31:26] with [music] him
[2:31:29] all
[2:31:31] [singing]
[2:31:32] the way.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; I'll go with him through the garden.
[2:31:37] I [music] go [singing] with
[2:31:40] him through
[2:31:43] the garden. [music]
[2:31:49] I'll [singing] go in
[2:31:53] truth. [music]
[2:31:56] the [singing] dark.
[2:32:01] I'll go with [music]
[2:32:05] him through [singing]
[2:32:08] God. [music]
[2:32:10] I'll go with thee.
[2:32:13] I'll go with you. [music]
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse three now. I'll go
[2:32:19] with him through the judgment [singing]
[2:32:22] of [music]
[2:32:23] the world.
[2:32:25] I'll go with you
[2:32:28] and I'll go [music and singing] with
[2:32:32] you through
[2:32:35] the judgement
[2:32:38] over [music]
[2:32:44] [singing]
[2:32:45] [music]
[2:32:47] the judge.
[2:32:50] Will you go with me?
[2:32:53] I'll [music] go away
[2:32:57] [singing] through
[2:33:00] the judgement. [music]
[2:33:02] I'll go with you. I'll go with [singing]
[2:33:07] you. [music]
[2:33:09] With
[2:33:13] [singing]
[2:33:13] [music]
[2:33:15] verse four, he will give me grace and
[2:33:17] glory. Does that make you happy? He will
[2:33:21] give [music]
[2:33:24] me praise [singing]
[2:33:27] and glory.
[2:33:30] [music] Yes, he will.
[2:33:32] He will. Just trust and obey. [music]
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; He will give you grace and glory.
[2:33:40] [singing]
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; Give me grace [music]
[2:33:51] and glory
[2:33:54] and go with [singing] you. Yes. [music]
[2:33:57] And go with me.
[2:34:00] Oh,
[2:34:03] [music]
[2:34:04] [singing]
[2:34:07] grace now. Follow me as I call.
[2:34:10] Oh,
[2:34:12] [music and singing] he is
[2:34:18] willing.
[2:34:20] [music and singing]
[2:34:25] [music and singing]
[2:34:35] [music]
[2:34:36] [singing]
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; Follow
[2:34:48] [music]
[2:34:50] me.
[2:34:53] [music]
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that [music] this
[2:35:04] morning? Amen.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to hear how the word of
[2:35:07] God works.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; You know, speaking [music] directly to
[2:35:12] the children,
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; but let's not take it and shovel it off
[2:35:16] on the children
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; because we're all children.
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; And I just couldn't help but think about
[2:35:22] it. You know, how parents, even when
[2:35:26] we're adults, we can look at [music] our
[2:35:28] parents and and see that they make
[2:35:31] mistakes.
[2:35:33] But that doesn't change who they are.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't change the value of them.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing with [music] the
[2:35:43] word of God.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; You know, the message in itself has no
[2:35:48] flaws.
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; Humans [music] have flaws.
[2:35:54] And you know what's happened in the day
[2:35:56] in which we live [music] is many
[2:35:58] different versions have been preached of
[2:36:00] what we would consider to be the
[2:36:02] message. [music]
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't change the fact that
[2:36:06] there is a truth in this message.
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; And that truth is what will make us
[2:36:12] free. [music]
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; Because the message is the word of God.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; To this age. [music] But many times we
[2:36:20] can look at it and say well you know
[2:36:21] this person they represented it this way
[2:36:24] and this person they represented it that
[2:36:26] way. Therefore I have liberty now
[2:36:28] [music] to disobey. When do children
[2:36:32] have the liberty to disobey the parents?
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; Never.
[2:36:37] There's no liberty.
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. It's
[2:36:41] powerful. I feel inspired. I could
[2:36:42] preach on this for a long time.
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with the message.
[2:36:46] Amen.
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; There's only fault with people who have
[2:36:48] misrepresented this message.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; And you know, I think it's so good
[2:36:52] because it's where I find all of my
[2:36:54] comfort and strength about this message
[2:36:56] is just say what the prophet said.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; And I love what he said today about the
[2:37:02] children. The children that we have,
[2:37:03] they're the best children.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; And you know, the devil can't have them.
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; We claim every single one of them in the
[2:37:10] name of Jesus Christ for the kingdom.
[2:37:14] [applause]
[2:37:17] They might not look like it. They might
[2:37:19] not sound like it, but that's got
[2:37:21] nothing to do with it. You know, my dad
[2:37:22] always told me that I was never as far
[2:37:24] from God as I thought. And if you're
[2:37:27] watching right now, I love you, Dad.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; But he said that. And you know what,
[2:37:31] brother Toby said right at the end here
[2:37:33] is so true because I know even though I
[2:37:36] was I was dedicated in the Pentecostal
[2:37:38] church, I was not dedicated to the
[2:37:40] Pentecostal church.
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; I was dedicated to God.
[2:37:45] as a baby.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; And every single one of us that is
[2:37:49] dedicated, we're dedicated to God.
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; Who knows how he works?
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; He's a wonderworking God. He's
[2:37:56] magnificent, isn't he?
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Let's let's just bow in
[2:38:00] prayer as we close.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[2:38:04] goodness, Lord. We thank you for your
[2:38:06] your [music] tender mercies to each and
[2:38:08] every one of us, Lord. Father, we pray
[2:38:11] that you would help us, Father, to
[2:38:12] recognize the only success we're going
[2:38:15] to have is to follow your word.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; And it's not grievious to serve you,
[2:38:21] Lord. Oh, Father, you said that my yoke
[2:38:23] is easy and my burden is light.
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; Father, when we live in this world
[2:38:28] thinking that we're going to do it our
[2:38:30] way,
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; it becomes so difficult. But when we
[2:38:33] finally lay down our own will and
[2:38:35] surrender to you and your word,
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; oh father, something supernatural takes
[2:38:40] place.
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord,
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; we're so thankful for your goodness,
[2:38:43] Lord. Thank you for the word today.
[2:38:45] Thank you for brother Toby and his
[2:38:47] family, Lord.
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for the
[2:38:50] representation they have. We thank you
[2:38:52] that they had parents, Lord, that
[2:38:54] trained them up in the way they should
[2:38:56] go. Amen.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; Father, and here he is now giving credit
[2:39:00] [music] to his dad who raised him in
[2:39:02] your ways
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; and his mom. Father, we pray that you
[2:39:05] would bless Brother Toby.
[2:39:07] &gt;&gt; We know the devil doesn't like this kind
[2:39:09] of talk, so he's not going to let it go
[2:39:11] easy. But Lord, we we [music] so thank
[2:39:13] you.
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just keep
[2:39:16] your hand upon each one of us now as we
[2:39:18] go our separate ways. Lord, thank you
[2:39:20] for the many, many testimonies we heard
[2:39:22] about this morning. You are the same
[2:39:25] today that you were before and that you
[2:39:27] will be in the future.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[2:39:29] &gt;&gt; We know that your word is just as
[2:39:30] enforced today as the the day that it
[2:39:33] was written, the day that it was thought
[2:39:35] in your mind before the foundation of
[2:39:37] the world.
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; Father, today we are here as living
[2:39:40] witnesses that [music] your word is
[2:39:42] alive.
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; We just pray that you would be glorified
[2:39:45] now, Father, as we go our separate ways.
[2:39:48] Keep your hand upon each one of us. be
[2:39:50] with those [music] who couldn't make it
[2:39:52] today, wherever they are, Father. Maybe
[2:39:54] some are hurting. Maybe some are lost.
[2:39:58] Maybe some are just disillusioned.
[2:40:01] Maybe some haven't just heard it the
[2:40:03] right way. But we pray, Father, for each
[2:40:05] and every one that you would minister to
[2:40:07] to them sovereignly, Lord Jesus.
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; And help us, Lord, to find that last
[2:40:12] predestinated seed in the city of
[2:40:14] Calgary. [music]
[2:40:15] We pray that you would give us that
[2:40:17] burden, Lord, in our hearts that we
[2:40:18] would desire to find that person whether
[2:40:21] it's at work or at school, oh father, in
[2:40:24] the shopping center, wherever we are,
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, that we could just bring
[2:40:29] more to your kingdom.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you. We ask all
[2:40:33] these things now in Jesus Christ's name
[2:40:35] we pray.
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that song, Hosana? I
[2:40:41] just couldn't help but think about that.
[2:40:43] Blessed be the rock.
[2:40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:45] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the rock, not of our or their
[2:40:49] but my salvation.
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:57] Oh [singing]
[2:40:58] magnify.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; Let's do [music] the verse. Let's do the
[2:41:02] verse. That's what I heard there. Oh,
[2:41:04] magnify [singing]
[2:41:05] the Lord
[2:41:08] for he [music] is worthy to be praised.
[2:41:12] Yeah.
