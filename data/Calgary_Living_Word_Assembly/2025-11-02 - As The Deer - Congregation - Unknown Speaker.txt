Description:
As the deer panteth for the water 
So my soul longeth after Thee
You alone are my heart's desire 
And I long to worship Thee

CHORUS
You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone does my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship Thee

You're my friend and You are my brother
Even though You are a King
I love You more than any other
So much more than anything

I want You more than gold or silver
Only You can satisfy
You alone are the real joy-giver
And the apple of my eye
