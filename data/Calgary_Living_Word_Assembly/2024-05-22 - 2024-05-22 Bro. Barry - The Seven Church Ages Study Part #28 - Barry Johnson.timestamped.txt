[35:57] something that we read that it wouldn't
[35:58] just be a traditional teaching or a
[36:01] fairy tale but Lord that these words
[36:04] that we hear they would become very real
[36:06] to us Lord that we would Lord not want
[36:09] to try and make this word adapt to fit
[36:11] our lives but that we would recognize
[36:14] the only way for us to not be heard of
[36:16] the second death is to adapt Our Lives

[38:09] it on Sunday and you know just talking
[38:11] about the spoken word seed and the bride
[38:14] and uh how you know we did not become
[38:16] seed by the rebirth and how there's a uh
[38:20] a very traditional teaching that
[38:22] somewhere along the way we recognize
[38:25] that we are seed
[38:28] and uh it's true that we do realize that
[38:32] we're seed we don't just become seed and
[38:35] that is what the traditional teaching is
[38:37] is that one day we become a seed of God
[38:40] and if we were uh if we are a seed of
[38:44] God then we always were a seed of God
[38:46] brother bam says that we did not become
[38:48] seed by the rebirth we were seed and
[38:51] therefore were
[38:53] reborn for only the elect can be reborn
[38:58] because we were seed that is the reason
[39:01] we could be quickened in nonseed there
[39:04] is nothing to Quicken hold this
[39:07] carefully in mind remember the children
[39:10] of Israel when they came out of bondage
[39:12] and they saw all the mighty signs and
[39:14] wonders God delivered them from 430
[39:18] years of hard bondage under the task
[39:21] Master's whips people never knew any
[39:24] portion of Freedom the only thing they
[39:27] knew is what it meant to be a slave and
[39:29] to actually be under the Dominion of the
[39:32] task Masters and if they wanted you to
[39:34] die then you died if they wanted to take
[39:36] your wife they took your wife if they
[39:38] wanted to kill and abuse your children
[39:40] that's what they did because they were
[39:41] task Masters and you know brother
[39:44] brandom says it very clearly that those
[39:46] people when they came out into the
[39:48] Wilderness the reason they weren't able
[39:51] to go on into the promised land is
[39:53] because they never had Faith to mix with
[39:56] that word when it came when the prophet
[39:59] came and brought the word and told them
[40:01] at Kadesh barnea you need to not do what
[40:04] you're doing you need to change your
[40:05] ways and repent and they said nope no no
[40:08] we're going to do it our way that is
[40:10] when they all fell away and it's because
[40:14] they were not seed they were Shu and
[40:18] there always has to be a shu to protect
[40:20] the seed but the life will never ever
[40:23] change the life is always the same and
[40:26] it just keeps progressing pressing
[40:27] through the plant but in the non seat
[40:30] there's nothing to Quicken hold this
[40:32] carefully in mind is what the prophet
[40:35] says here paragraph 175 he says now take
[40:38] the next step redeem means to buy back
[40:43] it restores to the original
[40:46] owner God by his death shed Blood Bought
[40:51] back his
[40:52] own he didn't buy another he didn't just
[40:55] one day go searching for some people
[40:57] that he could find he bought back what
[41:00] he already owned amen he bought back the
[41:04] spoken word seed bride amen my sheep
[41:09] hear my voice word and they follow
[41:13] me you always were a sheep and this is a
[41:17] beautiful thing I just it's so beautiful
[41:20] because many people can come around the
[41:22] word and many people can quote the word
[41:24] and many people can act like the word
[41:27] but not everyone can live the
[41:29] word those who live the word are the
[41:32] true seed bride of Christ they're the
[41:35] ones who always were sheep he goes on to
[41:39] say you never were a pig or a dog turned
[41:42] into a sheep that's impossible for every
[41:44] kind of Life produces the same kind and
[41:48] and there is no change in species as we
[41:52] were in the thoughts of God and then
[41:55] expressed in flesh there there had to
[41:57] come a day when we would hear his voice
[42:01] the word and upon hearing that voice
[42:05] become aware of our father calling us
[42:08] and recognize that we are the sons of
[42:11] God
[42:13] Amen I love that not that we're going to
[42:16] be that we are the sons of
[42:21] God we heard his voice and we cried out
[42:25] as did The Prodigal Son save me oh my
[42:29] father I am returning to thee amen a Son
[42:34] of God can go a long time before he
[42:37] recognizes that he is a son isn't that
[42:42] wonderful that's why brothers and
[42:43] sisters we can't point the finger at
[42:45] anybody else as soon as we start
[42:46] pointing the finger at anybody else
[42:47] we've got three pointing right back at
[42:49] ourselves we're not interested in trying
[42:52] to figure out who is the Son of God and
[42:53] who is not that's God's business to do
[42:55] amen our business is to get ourselves in
[42:58] line with this word amen
[43:01] hallelujah a Son of God can go a long
[43:04] time before he recognizes that he is a
[43:06] son blessed be the name of the Lord it
[43:09] took me 33
[43:10] years in fact a lot of true Christians
[43:14] are like the story of the baby eagle
[43:16] that was hatched out under a hen you
[43:19] know that eagle is a type of the True
[43:21] Believer well a farmer took an egg from
[43:24] under an eagle's nest and he placed it
[43:25] under a hen
[43:27] in due time all the eggs under the hen
[43:30] hatched out the baby chicks got along
[43:33] fine with the mother hen but that little
[43:35] Eagle could not figure out the clucking
[43:38] and scratching for food in the manure
[43:41] pile he managed to make a living but was
[43:44] pretty confused about it all but one day
[43:48] from way up in the air the mother Eagle
[43:51] that laid that had that had laid the egg
[43:55] spied that little eag e on the ground
[43:58] she swooped down with a tremendous speed
[44:00] and screamed at the top of her voice for
[44:02] him to fly up to meet her he had never
[44:05] heard an eagle
[44:06] cry but when he heard that first scream
[44:10] something in him stirred and he longed
[44:13] to launch out toward it but he was
[44:16] afraid to try I just wonder today how
[44:19] many people are actually afraid to try
[44:22] don't be afraid to try brother and
[44:24] sister if you've got that desire again
[44:27] again that mother screamed for him to
[44:29] rise in the wind and follow her he
[44:33] screamed back that he was afraid many
[44:36] times I think we try and connect the
[44:38] dots we try and wonder well how am I
[44:39] going to do it don't think about how
[44:41] you're going to do it just do it just
[44:44] jump and flap your wings brother bradam
[44:46] says just just jump one time he
[44:48] says once more she called out screaming
[44:52] that he try beating his wings he hurled
[44:56] himself into the air and answering the
[44:58] Cry of his mother he soared off into the
[45:01] blue
[45:02] skies you see he was always an
[45:06] eagle he wasn't a chicken that turned
[45:08] into an
[45:10] eagle he acted like a chicken for a
[45:13] little while but he could not be
[45:17] satisfied but when he heard the call of
[45:19] the Great Eagle he came to his own
[45:23] place and once a true Son of God hears
[45:26] the Cry of the
[45:28] Spirit by the
[45:31] word he too will realize who he is and
[45:35] run to the great prophet eagle and be
[45:38] with him forever seated in Heavenly
[45:41] places in Christ
[45:43] Jesus I just think that's such a
[45:46] beautiful statement such a beautiful
[45:48] story isn't
[45:49] it now comes our triumphal Capstone on
[45:53] the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[45:57] Galatians
[45:59] 44-7 but when the fullness of time was
[46:01] come God sent forth his son made of a
[46:04] woman made under the law to redeem them
[46:08] that were under the law that we might
[46:11] receive the adoption of
[46:14] sons and because ye are Sons God hath
[46:18] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[46:21] your hearts amen crying ABA father
[46:27] wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but
[46:31] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[46:35] through
[46:36] Christ there it is Jesus Christ came
[46:39] forth died upon the cross and
[46:42] accomplished Redemption
[46:44] restoring to original
[46:48] owner by means of purchase or paying the
[46:51] price and thereby placed us as Sons
[46:57] I just think that's so beautiful thereby
[46:59] placed us as
[47:01] Sons he did not make us Sons for we were
[47:03] already his sons but he placed us as
[47:06] Sons for as long as we were in the world
[47:11] in the flesh we could not be recognized
[47:14] as his
[47:15] sons we were held captive by the
[47:18] devil but we were Sons
[47:21] nonetheless and hear this and because ye
[47:25] are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit
[47:29] of his son into your hearts whereby you
[47:33] cry father father amen and that's what
[47:37] we do every single time we come to
[47:38] service brothers and sisters it's not
[47:41] just because we receive the word of God
[47:43] when we come to service we come to
[47:44] service to worship amen and we know the
[47:46] highest form of worship is the preaching
[47:48] of the word but when we have the
[47:50] opportunity to close our eyes and open
[47:52] our hearts raise our hands and sing
[47:54] praise unto the Lord that is not
[47:56] something that's just a traditional form
[47:58] it's not something that's just taken for
[48:00] granted you're singing to the king of
[48:02] kings and Lord of lords and what we do
[48:05] here who we are here remember is who
[48:08] we're going to be there we're not just
[48:10] going to suddenly become worshippers
[48:12] when we get over there that's not going
[48:15] to happen if you don't worship here I
[48:17] don't know will you worship over
[48:20] there upon whom did the Spirit fall at
[48:23] Pentecost Sons at Corinth upon sons
[48:28] while they heard the
[48:31] word what is the baptism with the Holy
[48:33] Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you
[48:36] into the body of Christ it is the new
[48:38] birth it is the spirit of God coming in
[48:41] and filling you after you have repented
[48:44] having heard his word and been baptized
[48:47] in water as an answer of a good
[48:50] conscience toward
[48:51] God what we have just set forth would be
[48:55] much easier for all to understand if all
[48:58] believed the doctrine of the Oneness of
[49:00] the godhead for there are not three
[49:03] persons in that godhead but one thus we
[49:07] are not born again by the spirit of life
[49:10] of Jesus coming in and then subsequent
[49:14] to that the Holy Spirit coming in to
[49:16] give us power if that were true why are
[49:21] we dishonoring the father by not giving
[49:24] him a part in our complete Sal salvation
[49:28] for if salvation is of the lord and
[49:30] there are three Lords then he father
[49:34] must have something to do too but surely
[49:39] it can be seen that Jesus made this very
[49:42] clear that it was he and he alone who is
[49:48] God just so clear and it is he and he
[49:52] alone who is coming into the believer
[49:55] John 14:6 says that the father will send
[49:58] another comforter but in verse 17 says
[50:00] that he Jesus dwelleth in them and
[50:03] should be in them later in verse 18 he
[50:07] says he will come to them in verse 23 in
[50:10] speaking to the disciples he said we
[50:13] father and son will come unto him thus
[50:16] it is Father Son and Holy Ghost all
[50:20] coming in at the one time for it is one
[50:25] person amen Rising the
[50:27] godhead that advent took place at
[50:30] Pentecost there aren't two comings of
[50:32] the spirit just one the trouble is that
[50:35] people don't know the real truth and
[50:38] they simply believe in Jesus for
[50:40] remission of sin but never go on to
[50:41] receive the spirit I say oh Lord help us
[50:44] to go on to receive the spirit am don't
[50:48] let us just stay stuck in a rut where we
[50:50] think that we're saved and everything is
[50:52] fine paragraph 183 before I close this
[50:56] subject I know know there is a question
[50:57] in your minds you will want to know if I
[50:59] believe in the doctrine of pre-existence
[51:02] I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine
[51:04] of the pre-existence of souls anymore
[51:06] than I believe in reincarnation or the
[51:09] transmigration of souls be careful here
[51:12] and see this it is not the person that
[51:16] comes predestinated eternally from God
[51:19] it is the word or
[51:22] seed that's it way back there too far
[51:26] back for the human mind to grasp the
[51:29] Eternal god with eternal thoughts
[51:32] thought and decreed Jacob have I loved
[51:36] but Esau have I hated Romans 9:13 and
[51:40] neither was born and neither had done
[51:42] good or evil see it was the thought and
[51:47] then that good sorry it was the thought
[51:51] and then that thought became expressed
[51:53] and God brought back Jacob because Jacob
[51:57] alone was seed Jacob alone had the seed
[52:01] that is why he had respect to the
[52:04] birthright and Covenant of God am but if
[52:08] you know the story which we do very well
[52:11] he wasn't a very good guy for all
[52:13] intents and purposes outwardly speaking
[52:16] looking upon them as men we know that
[52:19] Esau was a gentleman Esau was a good
[52:21] Hunter Esau was fine upstanding and
[52:25] Jacob what did the prophet say he was a
[52:27] Shyer he was a Shifty one he was willing
[52:30] to go and pull a dirty deal and we know
[52:33] that his mom encouraged him in it but
[52:35] that didn't change that fact that he was
[52:38] the seed Gene word of God inside of him
[52:42] which gave him the desire to go after
[52:44] that birth rate and that's why every one
[52:46] of us has the desire to follow this
[52:49] message of the hour because there's a
[52:51] seed Gene word of God in every one of us
[52:56] amen
[52:57] if you are true seed you will hear that
[53:00] word the spirit will baptize you into
[53:03] the body of Christ filling you and
[53:05] empowering you and you will receive the
[53:08] word for your day amen and age see how
[53:12] clear the true evidence becomes when the
[53:14] word is revealed to you again note Jesus
[53:18] was the royal seed he lived in a human
[53:20] body when the spirit called to him the
[53:23] word manifested thought he went to the
[53:26] Jordan
[53:27] and was there baptized in water upon
[53:30] obeying the word the Holy Spirit came
[53:33] upon him and the voice said this is my
[53:36] beloved Son hear ye him the voice did
[53:40] not say this has become my son Jesus was
[53:45] the son the Holy Ghost positioned him as
[53:49] that son before them all then having
[53:53] being filled thus and the same pattern
[53:56] holds at Pentecost and Ever After he
[54:00] went in demonstrated power receiving the
[54:03] full revelation of God and from God for
[54:07] that
[54:08] day now we have been constantly saying
[54:11] that the true evidence of being baptized
[54:13] with the Holy Ghost is for the believer
[54:15] to receive the word for the age in which
[54:17] he lives let me show you most clearly
[54:21] The Seven Ages as set forth in
[54:23] Revelations chap 2 and 3 take in the
[54:26] whole span of the fullness of the
[54:28] Gentiles or the whole time in which God
[54:30] is dealing with the Gentiles unto
[54:32] salvation in every single age Bar None
[54:37] it says the very same thing in opening
[54:40] and closing the message to each age unto
[54:43] the messenger of Ephesus Smyrna pergamus
[54:46] thyra Sardis Philadelphia leoda right
[54:51] these things saith he etc etc he that
[54:55] hath an ear let him singular hear what
[54:59] the spirit saith to the churches notice
[55:02] here that Jesus by the spirit in every
[55:06] age addresses himself to only one person
[55:12] relative to the word for that
[55:15] age that's very important Point only one
[55:20] person relative to the word for that age
[55:23] only one messenger for each age receives
[55:27] what the spirit has to say to that age
[55:30] and that one messenger is the messenger
[55:33] to the true church that's where a lot of
[55:36] people will say that this man fell off
[55:38] his rocker and went off on his Doctrine
[55:41] but we know for sure there's all the
[55:43] church ages we know we have a specific
[55:46] identity and what makes these people
[55:48] stand out and how they fit this
[55:50] description he goes on to say he speaks
[55:52] for God by Revelation to the churches
[55:55] both true and false
[55:57] the message is then broadcast to all but
[55:59] though it is broadcast for all who come
[56:03] within range of the message that message
[56:06] is received individually by only a
[56:09] certain qualified group in a certain way
[56:13] each individual of that group is one who
[56:16] has the ability to hear what the spirit
[56:19] is saying by way of the
[56:22] messenger those who hear are not getting
[56:25] their own private Revelation nor is a
[56:28] group getting their Collective
[56:30] Revelation but each person is hearing
[56:34] and receiving what the messenger has
[56:37] already received from
[56:40] God so beautiful and so
[56:44] perfectly clearly laid out there's no
[56:48] private interpretation to the message of
[56:50] the hour saying that I can take it and
[56:53] just put my own spin on it or I can take
[56:55] it and just live it the way that my
[56:58] church teaches it or that the way my
[57:01] parents taught it or the way my pastor
[57:03] brought it all of it's fine if it lines
[57:06] up with the word of God Amen if it
[57:08] doesn't line up with the word of God
[57:09] brothers and sisters it's not going to
[57:11] take you in the Rapture it's got to be
[57:14] according to the messenger for the
[57:17] age now think it not strange that this
[57:20] is the case for Paul set this pattern
[57:23] under the hand of God Paul alone had the
[57:26] Revelation for his day as evidenced by
[57:29] his con confrontation of the other
[57:32] apostles who admitted that Paul was the
[57:35] prophet Messenger to the Gentiles for
[57:36] that day and also noted by actual
[57:40] illustration in the word that when Paul
[57:42] desired to go to Asia God forbade him
[57:46] for the Sheep his children were in
[57:48] Macedonia and they the macedonians would
[57:51] hear what the spirit had to say through
[57:53] Paul while the people in Asia
[57:56] would
[57:57] not in every age we have exactly the
[58:01] same pattern that is why the light comes
[58:06] through some god-given messenger in a
[58:09] certain area and then from that
[58:11] messenger there spreads the light
[58:14] through the ministry of others who have
[58:16] been Faithfully
[58:18] taught are you thankful that you're
[58:21] Faithfully taught and you know brothers
[58:23] and sisters I'm not even saying brother
[58:25] Barry I I just want to stick as close as
[58:27] I can to this word this is the only
[58:29] anchor that I've got the only navigation
[58:32] the only GPS that I've got is the
[58:34] messenger's message the word that God
[58:36] gave to a Vindicated Prophet that's the
[58:38] only thing that I've got to bring but if
[58:39] you've got ears to hear somewhere along
[58:41] the way somebody must have taught you
[58:43] correctly so that you're able to take
[58:45] this word when it's spoken it's so
[58:49] beautiful and every age has exactly the
[58:52] same pattern
[58:54] amen oh my
[58:57] but of course all those who go out don't
[59:00] always learn how necessary it is to
[59:03] speak only what the messenger has spoken
[59:08] they might say they're a teacher they
[59:11] might say that they're an apostle they
[59:14] might say that they're a prophetic class
[59:16] of people and God's able to show them
[59:18] further light there's nothing further
[59:20] than what this Prophet
[59:22] brought everything falls under this
[59:25] prophet there is no greater Revelation
[59:28] because this Prophet taught what Paul
[59:30] taught and Paul was the first pattern
[59:32] Setter he was the first age messenger
[59:35] and every single messenger after Paul
[59:38] Falls right under the ministry of Paul
[59:40] and preached exactly what Paul preached
[59:44] amen remember Paul warned the people to
[59:46] say only what he said 1 Corinthians
[59:49] 14:37 If any man think himself to be a
[59:52] prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge
[59:56] that the things that I write unto you
[59:58] are the Commandments of the
[1:00:00] Lord not the Commandments of Paul not
[1:00:04] the Commandments of the message of the
[1:00:06] hour not the Commandments of some church
[1:00:10] like Calgary Living Word the
[1:00:11] Commandments of the Lord what came the
[1:00:15] word of God out from you or came it to
[1:00:18] you only this is God's word this is
[1:00:22] God's work we only preach what Paul
[1:00:25] preached that's what brother brandham
[1:00:27] brought and the thing is this world is
[1:00:29] set up now in such a way that everything
[1:00:33] in this world is contrary to this word
[1:00:35] of God and you know what we can say just
[1:00:38] about everything and we're not going to
[1:00:40] go too far with that tonight but
[1:00:42] brothers and sisters it it is not it's
[1:00:44] not a joking time it's not time to play
[1:00:46] Church it is so much later than we think
[1:00:49] this Beast system is fully fully in
[1:00:53] place 100% already there and the only
[1:00:56] thing that has to happen is the rapture
[1:00:58] of the bride and when that happens look
[1:01:00] out it's going to go
[1:01:03] crazy paragraph 189 they add here or
[1:01:06] take away there and soon the message is
[1:01:08] no longer pure and the Revival dies down
[1:01:11] how careful we must be to hear one voice
[1:01:14] for the spirit has but one voice which
[1:01:17] is the voice of God Paul warned them to
[1:01:20] say what he said even as Peter did
[1:01:23] likewise he warned them that even he
[1:01:26] Paul could not change one word of what
[1:01:29] he had given by Revelation oh how
[1:01:32] important it is to hear the voice of God
[1:01:34] by the way of his Messengers and then
[1:01:37] say what has been given them to say to
[1:01:40] the churches there's no other messenger
[1:01:43] after William Miriam brandham he was
[1:01:46] that messenger for this age we just need
[1:01:48] to press play and Obey amen hear what
[1:01:52] the messenger said amen yes I hope you
[1:01:56] are beginning to see it now perhaps you
[1:01:59] can understand now why I don't hold with
[1:02:02] a
[1:02:02] fundamentalist and the
[1:02:04] Pentecostals I have to hold to what the
[1:02:07] word I have to hold to the word the way
[1:02:11] the Lord revealed
[1:02:13] it now I did not cover it all that would
[1:02:15] take a separate book but by the help of
[1:02:17] the lord we will get many sermons and
[1:02:20] tapes and messages on all these points
[1:02:24] to help you understand and dovetail all
[1:02:29] scripture he that hath an ear let him
[1:02:31] hear what the spirit saith to the
[1:02:33] churches of each age in every age it was
[1:02:37] the same cry amen hear what the spirit
[1:02:40] says if you are a Christian you will get
[1:02:44] back to what the spirit is teaching that
[1:02:46] is the word of this age amen we won't be
[1:02:50] making excuses we won't be trying to
[1:02:52] find a loophole we won't be doing our
[1:02:54] own thing we'll be going exactly with
[1:02:56] the word every Messenger to every age
[1:02:59] will preach that word every fresh and
[1:03:03] true Revival will be because men have
[1:03:07] gotten back to the word for their age
[1:03:11] amen The Cry of every age is the
[1:03:14] rebuke you have left the word of God
[1:03:18] repent and come back to the word from
[1:03:21] the first book in the Bible Genesis to
[1:03:24] the last book revelation
[1:03:26] there was only one reason for God's
[1:03:29] displeasure isn't that easy and simple
[1:03:31] doesn't it just make it so clear there's
[1:03:32] only one reason for God's displeasure
[1:03:35] and that's leaving the word making some
[1:03:38] sort of cultural change saying oh pants
[1:03:41] that's that was for a different culture
[1:03:43] a different age that's old fashioned
[1:03:45] cutting your hair etc etc etc just
[1:03:49] leaving the word that's what displeases
[1:03:51] God and there was only one remedy to
[1:03:54] regain his favor back to the word and I
[1:03:58] just think that's so beautiful because
[1:03:59] that's how we can tell this is a prophet
[1:04:01] of God this is a god Prophet saying back
[1:04:03] to the word not I'm going to write my
[1:04:06] own book and I'm going to put my own
[1:04:07] spin on it and say that there's some
[1:04:09] great new revelation that's come that's
[1:04:12] outside of the Gospel no every single
[1:04:15] line back to the word amen yes in the
[1:04:20] Ephesian age and in this the Holy Ghost
[1:04:23] you will esteem his word above your
[1:04:26] necessary meat and yearn to live by
[1:04:31] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:04:33] mouth of
[1:04:35] Goden this is my Earnest prayer for all
[1:04:37] of us that we may hear what the spirit
[1:04:41] is bringing from the word for us
[1:04:44] today and that brings us to the end of
[1:04:47] the samran church
[1:04:48] age I uh I guess I'll just call the
[1:04:51] musicians I'm just
[1:04:54] joking we still got some
[1:04:57] time would that be okay if I did that
[1:04:59] sometime when people get
[1:05:02] upset you know what I want to do is
[1:05:04] actually uh I want to do a recap so it's
[1:05:07] beautiful I went through and I just
[1:05:09] started thinking you know where's
[1:05:11] where's the high points in this there's
[1:05:13] so many points that we have you know
[1:05:15] we've gone over in this in this study
[1:05:18] and I'm just going to I'm just going to
[1:05:20] hit on them you don't have to try and
[1:05:21] find them Isaac you know uh just talking
[1:05:24] about this the messenger we know the
[1:05:26] messenger was irius for this for this
[1:05:28] church age and he stood solidly for a
[1:05:32] unified spirit filled gift manifesting
[1:05:35] local church it wasn't about uh having a
[1:05:39] a bishop over a couple of churches and
[1:05:42] congregations and you know a
[1:05:44] conglomeration it wasn't about that at
[1:05:46] all he was very clear on his
[1:05:49] understanding of the godhead and and we
[1:05:51] know that he was the right choice for
[1:05:53] the age and uh brother bradam says in
[1:05:56] here that it's unfortunate that the
[1:05:57] other ages did not have in their
[1:06:00] Messengers such a balance of fruit power
[1:06:04] and leadership in the Holy Spirit and
[1:06:06] the word what a tremendous admonition
[1:06:09] that is to think that someone could
[1:06:12] actually have that in their life and I
[1:06:15] don't think that's exclusive to him I
[1:06:16] believe every one of us could have that
[1:06:18] am you know it was a it was a bitter age
[1:06:21] filled with death we know that's what
[1:06:22] Suna means and uh you know I remember
[1:06:26] brother Ken preaching this uh quite
[1:06:29] early on in my walk with the Lord and uh
[1:06:32] I just it stuck with me and brother Bram
[1:06:35] he says in here that uh no True Believer
[1:06:37] is any stronger and spiritually healthy
[1:06:39] and Alive than his knowledge of and
[1:06:41] adherence to the pure word of God and I
[1:06:46] say Lord help us to have help us to be
[1:06:50] oh my to have the knowledge of and
[1:06:51] adherence to that's all it is that the
[1:06:54] knowledge of it and the adherence to
[1:06:56] just sticking with the word of God when
[1:06:57] the word comes and corrects us just say
[1:07:00] Amen thank you Lord thank you that you
[1:07:02] love me enough to correct me it's not
[1:07:04] about getting my back up and saying
[1:07:06] you're just a a little two bit
[1:07:08] uneducated little fella up there
[1:07:10] thinking you can just preach the gospel
[1:07:11] it's not about that at all this is this
[1:07:13] is the Holy Ghost when we come to church
[1:07:15] when we come to church brothers and
[1:07:17] sisters if we don't come to church
[1:07:19] expecting to hear from the Holy Spirit
[1:07:21] then we've come to church for the wrong
[1:07:22] reason because that's why we gather here
[1:07:25] we Gather in in in in the name of Jesus
[1:07:28] Christ to invite him to speak to us to
[1:07:30] change our lives to correct us to give
[1:07:32] us extra overcoming power in our lives
[1:07:35] and I just think this is so good no no
[1:07:38] no True Believer is any stronger and
[1:07:40] spiritually healthy and Alive than as
[1:07:42] knowledge of and adherence to the pure
[1:07:44] word of God now some people could say oh
[1:07:45] I know the Bible inside and out but do
[1:07:47] we know the message inside and out if we
[1:07:49] do know the message inside and out plus
[1:07:51] the Bible inside and out do we live it
[1:07:53] inside and out
[1:07:56] it's pretty easy to say that we do but
[1:07:58] to actually do it is a totally different
[1:08:00] thing you know I just think these uh
[1:08:03] little nuggets are so good I'm going to
[1:08:05] try and go through quick so we don't
[1:08:07] have to carry on with this we can get
[1:08:09] into the next one the next chapter uh
[1:08:12] next
[1:08:13] time you know uh brother bradam he talks
[1:08:17] about it how
[1:08:21] uh
[1:08:23] my the sorian church age it's just
[1:08:26] bringing up memories of Prior Services I
[1:08:29] apologize for just pausing like that but
[1:08:31] you know the one service we took we we
[1:08:34] got into how the people brother Bram
[1:08:36] says you see they could not figure out
[1:08:37] God's love they thought that love meant
[1:08:40] no suffering they thought that love
[1:08:41] meant a baby with parental care but God
[1:08:45] said that his love was elective love
[1:08:48] remember elect of love the proof of his
[1:08:50] love is election no matter what we go
[1:08:54] through we will actually go through
[1:08:56] trials we'll go through struggles but it
[1:08:58] doesn't mean that he's not actually with
[1:09:01] us it doesn't mean that he's not caring
[1:09:03] for us amen he gives us the ability to
[1:09:06] go through these things remember the
[1:09:08] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[1:09:10] signs of God's
[1:09:13] disapproval neither are the bright skies
[1:09:15] and Still Waters signs of his love and
[1:09:18] approval we could be having a a storm in
[1:09:21] our life everything could be upside down
[1:09:24] in our our lives in our homes but that
[1:09:26] doesn't mean God doesn't disapprove of
[1:09:28] us amen and we can have big fat bank
[1:09:31] accounts and everything cruising along
[1:09:34] just perfectly calculated in our lives
[1:09:36] and that doesn't mean that's God's
[1:09:38] approval
[1:09:40] either the cloudy skies and storms of
[1:09:42] life are no signs of God's disapproval
[1:09:45] neither are the bright skies and still
[1:09:47] wat signs of his love and approval his
[1:09:50] approval of any of us is in the Beloved
[1:09:53] his love is elective with he had for us
[1:09:56] before the foundation of the world does
[1:09:58] he love us ah yes but how shall we know
[1:10:01] we shall know because he said so and
[1:10:04] manifested that he did love us for he
[1:10:06] brought us to himself and gave us his
[1:10:10] Spirit placing us as Sons just like we
[1:10:13] just read right at the end of the
[1:10:14] chapter and how shall I prove my love to
[1:10:18] him this is where it shows whether we're
[1:10:21] pleasing him or not based on what we
[1:10:23] just read at the end of the chapter by
[1:10:25] by believing what he said and conducting
[1:10:28] myself with joy amidst the trials that
[1:10:31] he in his wisdom allows to come to pass
[1:10:35] my it's not always easy the Christian
[1:10:39] walk is not easy but he has given us
[1:10:41] overcoming power amen he has given us
[1:10:44] the ability to endure
[1:10:50] amen he says later on in the chapter you
[1:10:53] see one difference between Israel and
[1:10:55] the rest of the Nations was
[1:10:57] God put God to one side and Israel was
[1:11:01] like any other Nation when Samson cut
[1:11:04] off his hair he was like any other
[1:11:07] man put the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:10] aside and the church is nothing but the
[1:11:13] world with God's name attached to it
[1:11:17] right we never want to negate the
[1:11:20] leadership of the Holy Ghost every step
[1:11:22] of the way we want the leadership of the
[1:11:24] Holy Ghost the only thing that's going
[1:11:26] to save us brothers and sisters it has
[1:11:29] to be the Holy Ghost leadership in our
[1:11:31] lives in our
[1:11:34] homes the minute the church moved toward
[1:11:37] form and ceremony and toward priesthood
[1:11:41] by organizing the ministers into a group
[1:11:45] that decided
[1:11:46] leadership apart from the Holy Spirit
[1:11:49] and his
[1:11:50] word that very moment death entered and
[1:11:54] she started to get get
[1:11:55] sick and as she got sick she changed to
[1:12:00] a powerless group of people whose only
[1:12:03] weapon was
[1:12:07] argument she could produce nothing in
[1:12:09] the spirit for her hopes were built on
[1:12:13] program and not on faith in his word
[1:12:18] they swed program and they reaped
[1:12:19] program they SED provision so they
[1:12:22] reaped perverted children
[1:12:25] my he says you tamper with God and you
[1:12:28] reap exactly what you
[1:12:31] injected just incredible the some of
[1:12:34] these are just absolute nuggets
[1:12:38] here oh my brother Bram he talks about
[1:12:41] the truth is that the writing is on
[1:12:45] writing the truth is that it is writing
[1:12:49] the Finish to all of man's ideas
[1:12:52] programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of
[1:12:54] God is being ushered in wake up people
[1:12:57] of God wake up if you don't think this
[1:12:59] is true just listen to this all over the
[1:13:02] world in both Pentecostal and
[1:13:04] fundamental groups they they are
[1:13:07] organizing the
[1:13:08] businessmen they have invaded the pulpit
[1:13:12] without a call from God they have styled
[1:13:15] themselves the Fishers of Men and the
[1:13:18] founders of a move of God and they say
[1:13:21] the gifted Ministry of Ephesians 410
[1:13:26] 13 that God gave the church has failed
[1:13:30] so they are taking over here we are
[1:13:33] right in the midst of the Fulfillment of
[1:13:35] the prophecy calling the gain sayings of
[1:13:38] Kora and they don't even know that they
[1:13:42] have fulfilled
[1:13:43] it they are blindly going on preaching
[1:13:47] experience for truth may God have pity
[1:13:50] on them may their eyes be opened before
[1:13:54] it is too late
[1:13:57] I had a brother send me a a text message
[1:14:00] this week and some others might have
[1:14:01] seen it of brother Danny steeman
[1:14:04] preaching we all know him he's from
[1:14:07] Florida if you don't know him he's a
[1:14:09] really good brother he friends with
[1:14:10] brother Ken and he was here he's
[1:14:11] preached a couple times here but he
[1:14:14] preached and I think it was a camp that
[1:14:16] he was preaching at and he said two boys
[1:14:19] in the front come on up here I want to
[1:14:21] show you something he said you might not
[1:14:23] get it now but you might get it in 10
[1:14:24] years from now and he said you you're
[1:14:27] going to be signs and you you're going
[1:14:29] to be
[1:14:30] wonders and I want you to follow me
[1:14:32] everywhere I go and what did he do he
[1:14:34] started preaching he started talking
[1:14:36] about experience and he started talking
[1:14:37] about signs and wonders and how we don't
[1:14:38] need to try and Trump anything up
[1:14:40] because guess what they follow and he
[1:14:43] walked all over the place he got down he
[1:14:45] walked around the front and as he talked
[1:14:47] he said you know I don't have to try and
[1:14:49] and produce them I don't have to try and
[1:14:50] call them I don't have to try and do
[1:14:52] anything because everywhere I go they
[1:14:54] follow follow me and they did and he
[1:14:56] went around he made a big deal about it
[1:14:58] he made a point and these two little
[1:15:00] boys they would not let him go they
[1:15:02] followed him closely and at the back
[1:15:04] there was even a dark place that was
[1:15:07] kind of you know hidden or whatever a
[1:15:09] curtain or something but he even went in
[1:15:10] in there and he said even in the Dark
[1:15:12] Places signs and wonders follow even
[1:15:15] when there's no other light when there's
[1:15:17] nothing else around signs and wonders
[1:15:20] I'll actually send it out if you'd like
[1:15:22] I'll forward it just a wonderful thing
[1:15:24] brothers and sisters don't try and put
[1:15:26] experience out front of the word of God
[1:15:30] the children of Israel were instructed
[1:15:32] to get up and get ready and follow that
[1:15:35] Ark because when that Ark goes across
[1:15:37] we're going across but they were told to
[1:15:39] keep a very specific distance from that
[1:15:41] Ark just make sure that you can see it
[1:15:44] that's all you need to do
[1:15:46] amen don't make
[1:15:48] experience the way we actually judge
[1:15:51] things brother Bram says it I don't know
[1:15:52] if I have it as one of these nuggets
[1:15:54] here but he says away with experience as
[1:15:57] our Plum line we don't want experience
[1:15:59] to be whether God's with us or not we
[1:16:02] have his word if we have his word he's
[1:16:05] with us if we're willing to say be it
[1:16:07] unto me according to Thy word that
[1:16:09] you've given to a Vindicated Prophet I'm
[1:16:12] going to surrender myself to every
[1:16:14] single word that you gave him then you
[1:16:16] know you got
[1:16:20] him
[1:16:22] my H there's so much in here so
[1:16:30] good brother Romy talks about the Revol
[1:16:33] under the reward for
[1:16:35] overcoming I stand here on the authority
[1:16:38] of the word of God and deny that the
[1:16:41] unbeliever goes to an eternal hell and
[1:16:43] burns
[1:16:44] eternally he talks about this how
[1:16:47] there's no such thing as an eternal hell
[1:16:49] because it was created for the devil and
[1:16:52] his angels that's what the word of God
[1:16:53] says we know that just for time sake I'm
[1:16:55] trying to to gallop along here but if it
[1:16:59] had a beginning then it can't be Eternal
[1:17:01] is what brother brandham says and uh
[1:17:03] it's such a beautiful thing it's one of
[1:17:04] the things that we know the
[1:17:06] denominational world really challenged
[1:17:07] him on because it goes right against
[1:17:10] everything that they believe in that
[1:17:12] there is uh an eternal hell just like
[1:17:15] there's an eternal heaven and uh
[1:17:17] Christianity we know that's the
[1:17:18] Catholics believe that for sure that
[1:17:20] there is an eternal hell and uh it's
[1:17:24] it's a pretty big organization and uh
[1:17:26] we're just thankful that we have the
[1:17:27] Revelation for our
[1:17:29] day he says now then only sons of God
[1:17:32] have eternal life the kind that never
[1:17:35] had a beginning but always was that's
[1:17:38] right you have something in you right
[1:17:41] now that is eternal without beginning or
[1:17:44] end it is the spirit of God it is a part
[1:17:48] of God himself it is the life of God and
[1:17:53] that's why I think it's so beautiful
[1:17:55] when we can step back from ourselves and
[1:17:57] and our own stations our own positions
[1:18:00] in our lives our own shortcomings faults
[1:18:02] and failures and recognize that this
[1:18:05] flesh will not inherit the kingdom of
[1:18:08] God this flesh has to perish that's why
[1:18:11] every single human being here in this
[1:18:13] world outside of going in a Rapture has
[1:18:15] to go in the
[1:18:16] grave because the only thing that goes
[1:18:19] is the soul that's it it's not who we
[1:18:22] are it's not who we think we are it's
[1:18:25] not how we feel it's not an emotional
[1:18:27] experience it's got nothing to do with
[1:18:29] it it's all about his life inside of us
[1:18:33] and if we have the ability to get his
[1:18:34] life inside of us then you know what we
[1:18:37] are as Eternal as he is
[1:18:41] eternal not one of the
[1:18:44] redeemed will be anywhere except where
[1:18:47] Jesus
[1:18:49] is
[1:18:52] beautiful you know he talks about the
[1:18:54] blood
[1:18:55] and this the blood
[1:18:56] test and how if you belong to
[1:19:00] God he's only going to look at the
[1:19:03] blood he's not looking at our brand he's
[1:19:06] not looking at what church you attended
[1:19:09] he's not looking at what family you came
[1:19:11] from he's not looking at even what you
[1:19:14] claim to believe he's looking to see if
[1:19:17] you have his life inside of you that's
[1:19:20] what's going to make the difference if
[1:19:21] we have the blood tag then we have all
[1:19:24] that we need
[1:19:26] need so many different things in here so
[1:19:33] beautiful so
[1:19:39] beautiful sorry if this seems broken
[1:19:44] up goes on to say every age we hear the
[1:19:47] same truth he that hath an ear let him
[1:19:48] hear what the spirit saith to the
[1:19:49] churches but only a spirit filled man
[1:19:53] can hear the Revelation for for that age
[1:19:56] none other can no sir they cannot
[1:20:00] because that exact is exactly what Paul
[1:20:03] said in 1 Corinthians 2
[1:20:07] 6-16 now this ought to make you rejoice
[1:20:11] there is a most peculiar Doctrine in the
[1:20:13] air that's causing much misunderstanding
[1:20:15] and hard feelings for when the
[1:20:16] Pentecostals say You must speak in
[1:20:18] tongues or you haven't been baptized
[1:20:21] with the Holy Ghost they are either
[1:20:23] denying that great men like Knox Moody
[1:20:28] Taylor go forth and others did not
[1:20:31] receive the holy ghost or
[1:20:34] saying that they all secretly spoke in
[1:20:36] tongues and were not aware of what was
[1:20:38] going on now that is not true no sir
[1:20:42] that is gross error tongues are not the
[1:20:45] evidence of being Spirit-filled it is
[1:20:48] simply one of the nine manifestations
[1:20:51] mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 there is
[1:20:54] no scripture that says you receive the
[1:20:56] Holy Spirit speaking in tongues or that
[1:20:58] you receive the Holy Spirit by speaking
[1:21:00] in tongues it does say that after they
[1:21:03] were all filled with the Holy Ghost they
[1:21:06] spake with tongues and later on it says
[1:21:09] that they
[1:21:11] prophesied it's just so
[1:21:14] beautiful brother Bram talks about this
[1:21:16] here and you know what he says is
[1:21:18] speaking in tongues is actually ushering
[1:21:21] in the end of the age
[1:21:24] it's a pretty profound
[1:21:33] statement now when God is silent we had
[1:21:36] better be
[1:21:37] silent but where he has spoken we had
[1:21:39] better speak too and say what he has
[1:21:41] already said he told us the evidence or
[1:21:44] what would happen after being baptized
[1:21:47] with the Holy Ghost was that we would
[1:21:50] have the teacher come and teach all
[1:21:52] truth
[1:21:54] But the teacher was an inside teacher
[1:21:58] not an outside
[1:22:00] teacher if the spirit wasn't
[1:22:03] inside you wouldn't hear the truth and
[1:22:06] receive it by
[1:22:08] Revelation if you heard it every moment
[1:22:11] of the
[1:22:12] day that's why we need the spirit we
[1:22:15] need the Holy Ghost in our lives that
[1:22:18] was the sign of the indwelling spirit in
[1:22:20] the days of Paul those who were filled
[1:22:23] with the Holy Ghost heard the word
[1:22:26] received it and lived by it those who
[1:22:29] did not have the spirit heard it only as
[1:22:33] carnal men put a wrong interpretation on
[1:22:37] it and went into
[1:22:41] sin I just say we need to get the Holy
[1:22:44] Ghost otherwise we're looking at it as
[1:22:46] carnal men and that's what's going to
[1:22:47] happen to us it'll just be a matter of
[1:22:49] time but we will find ourselves out
[1:22:51] there in sin in every age
[1:22:55] and every age is the age of the Holy
[1:22:58] Ghost for the True
[1:23:00] Believer I say in every age the evidence
[1:23:04] was the
[1:23:05] same those who had the spirit the
[1:23:08] teacher heard the word and that spirit
[1:23:11] in them took the word and taught it
[1:23:15] revealed it to them and they were the
[1:23:18] group that heard the messenger and his
[1:23:22] message and took it
[1:23:24] and lived
[1:23:26] it I have that highlighted right there
[1:23:29] with arrows pointing at it they took it
[1:23:32] and they lived it it wasn't something
[1:23:35] that they just said oh that's nice I
[1:23:39] just believe that with all my heart but
[1:23:41] then put their own interpretation to it
[1:23:44] that's not the way it happens amen so
[1:23:52] beautiful so now
[1:23:55] so you can see now that we cannot afford
[1:23:58] to say what the Bible has not said when
[1:24:00] the scripture teaches us that the work
[1:24:02] of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:24:04] manifestation of that blessed person is
[1:24:06] to bring the truth of each age to the
[1:24:10] true seed of that age then we know that
[1:24:13] the spirit has to be abiding in the
[1:24:15] person or he cannot receive the truth
[1:24:18] for that time amen that is exactly
[1:24:22] correct amen
[1:24:24] now before we leave this subject I want
[1:24:26] to make myself very clear on what the
[1:24:29] baptism with the Holy Ghost is according
[1:24:32] to the word I think this is so important
[1:24:35] for us how brother brandham brings this
[1:24:37] stuff out and it's not all specific to
[1:24:40] this Myan Church age we know that he
[1:24:42] says it over and over again that this is
[1:24:43] to every single
[1:24:46] age he says now before we leave this
[1:24:48] subject I want to make myself very clear
[1:24:50] on what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:24:51] according to the word it's not according
[1:24:53] to me
[1:24:54] and it's not according to you it has to
[1:24:57] be according to thus saith the Lord or
[1:25:00] we are falsely
[1:25:02] led to begin with you notice that in my
[1:25:05] meetings when I have finished preaching
[1:25:07] an Evangelistic service or some teaching
[1:25:09] message I cast the net and invite a
[1:25:12] response from the people I ask them to
[1:25:15] come forward and receive the Holy Spirit
[1:25:19] my Pentecostal friends upon hearing me
[1:25:21] say this believe that I am inviting
[1:25:24] people to come forward to be baptized
[1:25:27] with the Holy Ghost because they are
[1:25:29] already born
[1:25:30] again so when I invite those who are
[1:25:33] Spirit-filled to come and deal with
[1:25:35] those who have answered the invitation
[1:25:38] to receive the spirit these dear ones
[1:25:40] surge forward and deal with the people
[1:25:43] in such a manner as to encourage them to
[1:25:46] yield to God and believe to speak in
[1:25:50] tongues this has caused a great deal of
[1:25:53] confusion and I want to tell you exactly
[1:25:55] what I
[1:25:56] mean I mean for The Sinner to come
[1:25:59] forward and be born again which is to be
[1:26:02] baptized into the body of Christ by the
[1:26:05] Holy Ghost which is exactly what took
[1:26:08] place at Pentecost when the church was
[1:26:11] launched in other words to be born of
[1:26:14] the spirit is to be truly baptized with
[1:26:18] the Holy Ghost it is one and the same
[1:26:26] such an important part now I realize
[1:26:29] that it's going to be confusing for a
[1:26:30] moment here but as most people know that
[1:26:33] I that I was ordained a Baptist preacher
[1:26:37] and I have steadfastly declared that the
[1:26:38] Baptists have missed it for saying you
[1:26:41] receive the Holy Ghost when you believe
[1:26:45] for that is not so you receive him since
[1:26:48] you
[1:26:50] believe and he says Acts 2 Acts 19 verse
[1:26:54] verses
[1:26:55] 2-6 and he said unto them have ye
[1:26:57] received the Holy Ghost since ye
[1:26:58] believed and they said unto him we have
[1:27:00] not so much as heard whether there be
[1:27:02] any Holy Ghost and he said unto them
[1:27:04] unto what then were you baptized and
[1:27:07] they said unto John's baptism then said
[1:27:09] Paul John verily baptized with the
[1:27:11] baptism of repentance saying unto the
[1:27:14] people that they should believe on him
[1:27:16] which should come after him that is on
[1:27:18] Jesus Christ when they heard this they
[1:27:20] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:27:22] Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands
[1:27:25] upon them the Holy Ghost Came Upon them
[1:27:27] and they spake with tongues and
[1:27:30] prophesied the Bram says there it is
[1:27:32] Paul asked have you received since not
[1:27:35] when you believed and there's a great
[1:27:37] difference there for it is after we
[1:27:40] believe that we
[1:27:42] receive Ephesians 1:13 is an exact word
[1:27:46] repeat of what happened in Ephesus
[1:27:48] according to Acts 19 in whom ye also
[1:27:51] trusted after that ye heard the word of
[1:27:54] Truth The Gospel of your salvation in
[1:27:58] whom also after that ye believed not
[1:28:02] when ye believed ye were sealed with
[1:28:05] that Holy Spirit of
[1:28:07] promise I just want to
[1:28:10] say have ye received the Holy Ghost
[1:28:13] because ye
[1:28:15] believe we don't need to make it uh a
[1:28:18] big thing I know that it's not a big
[1:28:19] thing amongst uh our ranks the people
[1:28:22] that are here but it's just important to
[1:28:24] recognize that the the the true New
[1:28:27] Birth is the one and the same thing we
[1:28:29] don't come and get saved and then we
[1:28:32] take steps because we're saved now we're
[1:28:34] going to take steps to come to the place
[1:28:36] where we one day get the baptism of the
[1:28:38] Holy Spirit if we're truly saved if
[1:28:41] we're truly adopted Sons and Daughters
[1:28:43] of God we get the Holy Spirit when we
[1:28:47] believe because we believe we don't have
[1:28:50] a progression to go down to try and
[1:28:53] receive the AP ISM of the Holy
[1:28:55] Spirit brother Bram he says have you
[1:28:58] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:28:59] believed this is the whole of our
[1:29:01] problem right here people repent of
[1:29:02] their sins they get baptized in water
[1:29:05] but they do not go on and receive the
[1:29:07] Holy Ghost you believe unto receiving
[1:29:10] the spirit Believing on Jesus is the
[1:29:13] step in the right direction which is
[1:29:15] toward the Holy Ghost but the people
[1:29:17] stop there they go as far as water and
[1:29:19] then stop they believe and then stop the
[1:29:22] Bible does not say that you receive
[1:29:24] when you believe it is have you received
[1:29:27] the Holy Ghost since you believed the
[1:29:29] exact and literal translation is did ye
[1:29:32] having previously believed received the
[1:29:34] Holy Ghost the people
[1:29:37] believe and then stop you don't receive
[1:29:40] the Holy Ghost when you believe unto him
[1:29:43] having repented you go on and receive
[1:29:46] the Holy Ghost do you see it that is
[1:29:48] what is wrong with our fundamentalists
[1:29:50] they have no power for they stop short
[1:29:53] of penny cost and we know that brother
[1:29:55] Bram he goes on to say that it's just
[1:29:57] like the children stopping short of the
[1:29:59] promised land the promise was there they
[1:30:01] could taste the fruit they could see the
[1:30:03] evidence they heard the prophecy they
[1:30:05] knew that everything was lining up for
[1:30:07] them but they just didn't go all the way
[1:30:10] into the promised land we know that only
[1:30:13] two stayed with the word and that is the
[1:30:16] difference for us today just stay with
[1:30:18] the word if we can just stay with the
[1:30:20] word then we will truly get the baptism
[1:30:23] of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:24] because we believe and the only reason
[1:30:27] we can believe is because there's a seat
[1:30:29] inside of us that he placed there before
[1:30:31] the foundation of the world and when the
[1:30:33] word preached in season the pure word of
[1:30:36] God preached in season comes upon that
[1:30:39] seed what happens is there's a life that
[1:30:41] Springs forward and says be it unto me
[1:30:44] according to Thy word I just can't help
[1:30:46] but worship him and call him Abba
[1:30:52] Father excuse me I'm
[1:30:55] still trying to get over this I know the
[1:30:58] Lord has healed me he's given me the
[1:31:00] ability to get better and know him more
[1:31:03] and more as my own healer and I'm
[1:31:05] certainly
[1:31:06] thankful remember brothers and sisters
[1:31:09] you are the Eternal thoughts of
[1:31:12] God he thought about you before the
[1:31:14] foundation of the world he thought about
[1:31:16] you even before there was a speck of
[1:31:19] Stardust is what brother brandham
[1:31:21] says you know some of the uh most
[1:31:24] highlighted portion of this chapter is
[1:31:28] where we'll wind up tonight and it's
[1:31:30] kind of where we
[1:31:32] started according to Romans 4:16 we find
[1:31:36] that God has given a sure promise to all
[1:31:37] of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself
[1:31:40] and all believers under that designation
[1:31:43] because he says Abraham who is the
[1:31:46] father of us all then he goes on to not
[1:31:50] only narrow down his definition but
[1:31:52] rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3
[1:31:56] he identified the seed singular with
[1:32:00] Jesus and counted the seed children as
[1:32:04] children of
[1:32:06] promise and promise as having to do with
[1:32:10] election or the choosing of God and that
[1:32:13] is exactly what we have been
[1:32:16] saying these who are of the royal seed
[1:32:19] are the excuse me the elect of God are
[1:32:22] the predestination had forn of God and
[1:32:25] were in the mind of God and His
[1:32:28] Thoughts in very plain language the true
[1:32:31] bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[1:32:36] eternally though not expressed until
[1:32:38] each came forth in the designated
[1:32:41] decreed
[1:32:43] season every one of us here is in the
[1:32:47] designated decreed season don't think
[1:32:50] for a second that we've missed out or
[1:32:52] that we're here just by accident you are
[1:32:55] here because you've come forth in the
[1:32:57] designated decreed season as each member
[1:33:00] came forth it became expressed and took
[1:33:04] its place in the
[1:33:06] body how many have taken their place in
[1:33:09] the body tonight thus this bride is the
[1:33:13] literal spoken word seed bride and
[1:33:17] though she is feminine in designation
[1:33:19] she is also called the body of Christ it
[1:33:22] is very apparent that she ought to be
[1:33:24] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:33:27] him came from the same Source was
[1:33:29] eternal with him and is now manifesting
[1:33:33] God in a many membered body whereas once
[1:33:38] God manifested in one member even our
[1:33:41] Lord Jesus
[1:33:43] Christ I think this is real important
[1:33:45] here too brothers and sisters that's why
[1:33:47] I'm reading
[1:33:48] it because if we have this ability to be
[1:33:51] the seed if we can recognize the word
[1:33:53] and the seed Gene of God is pumping
[1:33:56] through our veins then we are now
[1:33:58] manifesting God in a many membered body
[1:34:02] amen that's what we're doing when we
[1:34:04] live our lives that's what we're doing
[1:34:05] when we gather together that's what
[1:34:07] we're doing when we go to work when we
[1:34:08] go to school we're not manifesting
[1:34:10] ourselves we're not working on our own
[1:34:12] brand and our own image I
[1:34:15] hope we're working on his
[1:34:17] image because the sooner we get fully In
[1:34:21] His Image or better yet his image fully
[1:34:23] in us the sooner we get out of here the
[1:34:26] sooner that we see this body change now
[1:34:30] then here we are coming to a conclusion
[1:34:33] as the Eternal logos God was manifest in
[1:34:35] his son and in Jesus dwelt all the
[1:34:39] fullness of the godhead bodily and that
[1:34:41] Eternal one was the father manifest in
[1:34:43] flesh and thereby gained the title of
[1:34:46] son so even so we Eternal in his
[1:34:51] thoughts in our turn became the many
[1:34:55] membered spoken word seed manifest in
[1:34:59] flesh and those Eternal thoughts now
[1:35:02] manifest in flesh are the sons of God
[1:35:07] even as we are soall amen we did not
[1:35:10] become seed by the rebirth we were seed
[1:35:14] and
[1:35:15] therefore were reborn for only the elect
[1:35:19] can be
[1:35:20] reborn because we were seed that is the
[1:35:23] the reason we could be quickened in
[1:35:26] nonseed there is nothing to Quicken now
[1:35:29] he says hold that in mind carefully and
[1:35:32] uh I'll call the musicians now I'm just
[1:35:34] going to close we'll pick up the pergam
[1:35:37] and church age next Wednesday Lord
[1:35:39] willing or the next
[1:35:42] time in the Ephesian age and in this age
[1:35:45] and in every Age We
[1:35:48] contemplate we will see that this is
[1:35:52] true and in the the last age which is
[1:35:54] our age we find the blackout of the word
[1:35:58] the complete apostasy ending in the
[1:36:01] Great
[1:36:02] Tribulation if you are true seed if you
[1:36:05] are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:36:08] you will esteem his word above your
[1:36:10] necessary meat and yearn to live by
[1:36:14] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:36:16] mouth of
[1:36:17] God now this is the prophet for this age
[1:36:20] the messenger saying this is my Earnest
[1:36:22] prayer for all of us that we may hear
[1:36:25] what the spirit is bringing from the
[1:36:26] word for us today let's just stand as we
[1:36:33] [Music]
[1:36:38] close gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[1:36:41] Jesus we thank you for your goodness and
[1:36:43] your mercy to us
[1:36:45] Lord we thank you Lord that we have been
[1:36:48] given the ability to hear what the
[1:36:50] spirit saith unto the church amen
[1:36:54] father tonight I just pray that Lord as
[1:36:56] we go forwards from here and contemplate
[1:37:00] the words that were spoken tonight and
[1:37:03] Lord as we read the words in this book
[1:37:06] and we consider your word and your life
[1:37:10] and our positions in your body that Lord
[1:37:13] father we would just begin to look at
[1:37:15] ourselves maybe in a little bit of a
[1:37:17] Different Light yes amen help us Lord
[1:37:19] Jesus to look at
[1:37:21] ourselves as the manifestation
[1:37:24] of your thoughts for this
[1:37:26] age Lord that we would look at one
[1:37:29] another and recognize that maybe that
[1:37:31] brother is weird maybe that sister is
[1:37:33] weird maybe we are different in our own
[1:37:36] ways but we are still the manifestation
[1:37:40] of your Eternal thoughts and we know
[1:37:43] that there's not one quirky nature about
[1:37:45] us that you were not aware of before the
[1:37:47] foundation of this world and you still
[1:37:49] chose to place your seed within the
[1:37:52] confines of that body Lord Jesus help us
[1:37:55] to look at one another and not see one
[1:37:57] another but to see
[1:37:59] you father as we go forwards tonight I
[1:38:02] pray that we would just consider these
[1:38:03] words that we would think about who we
[1:38:06] are and what we're really doing in this
[1:38:09] life father we know that the time is
[1:38:11] short we know that the stage is set for
[1:38:14] the tribulation to start and father the
[1:38:19] bride oh Lord Jesus your wife has found
[1:38:23] this word and heard the voice and she's
[1:38:25] making herself ready father if there's
[1:38:28] anything in our lives Lord that we can
[1:38:30] change that we need to do to make
[1:38:32] ourselves more ready father we pray that
[1:38:35] you would show us we pray that you would
[1:38:37] lead us and guide us father that Lord
[1:38:40] when that great day arrives that we
[1:38:42] would not find that there's any trouble
[1:38:44] in our lives anything to hinder us
[1:38:46] father from being able to take that
[1:38:49] Heavenly
[1:38:50] flight we love you and we thank you we
[1:38:52] just pray for those Lord who are sick
[1:38:55] tonight in their bodies that you would
[1:38:57] just touch them in the name of Jesus
[1:38:59] Christ amen father we know that the
[1:39:01] devil is roaming around as a roaring
[1:39:04] lion seeking whom he can devour but we
[1:39:08] know he has no teeth we know that's the
[1:39:11] Revelation that you gave us in this age
[1:39:13] and we thank you for it Lord and
[1:39:15] everyone who is sick tonight who serves
[1:39:17] you who is an eternal seed son and
[1:39:21] daughter of God oh Father tonight we
[1:39:23] just rebuke the devil together in the
[1:39:26] name of Jesus Christ for our brother and
[1:39:28] our sister Lord and we pray that you
[1:39:30] would raise us up and allow us to gather
[1:39:32] together again on Sunday if it Be Your
[1:39:34] Will Lord Jesus father we love you and
