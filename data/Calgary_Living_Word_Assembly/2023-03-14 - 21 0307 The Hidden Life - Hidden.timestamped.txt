[4:38] when he reached when he reached town is
[4:43] for me are you grateful for that when
[4:48] you reached down your hands for me
[4:53] the springboard to receive the message
[4:56] of the hour and to be able to receive
[4:58] the Revelation from that and and that
[5:00] that that that Revelation brothers and
[5:02] sisters will change our bodies one day
[5:04] one of these days our bodies won't be
[5:06] able to contain the the entirety of that
[5:08] Revelation because once the church
[5:10] recognizes what it is then the Rapture
[5:13] will go and that day has never been
[5:15] closer Brothers and Sisters Jesus Christ
[5:17] the same yesterday today and forever
[5:19] Christ on Earth again in flesh
[5:23] you know we say that he came in 1963 and
[5:26] he opened the seals he came he descended
[5:28] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[5:30] and the Trump of God he had an open book
[5:33] when he descended he said his his right
[5:35] foot on the land and his left foot on
[5:36] the sea and and declared that there
[5:38] shall be time no more and opened open
[5:40] the word to us gave us the little book
[5:43] and told us to eat it up just like John
[5:45] that Revelation what that does to us is
[5:47] it gives us the ability to see now we're
[5:50] going from being in in the earth in an
[5:52] Earthly carnal state to a spiritual
[5:54] state that there is actually a
[5:56] revelation of a door open in heaven
[5:58] where John was called to come up hither
[6:00] not just stay here in the denominational
[6:02] teachings not just stay here in in all
[6:05] of the things that we thought we knew
[6:06] but to come up higher and that higher
[6:08] Revelation is the message of the our
[6:10] brothers and sisters
[6:12] in this message adoption brother Branham
[6:14] goes on to say you know after we talked
[6:17] about Revelation and the importance of
[6:19] it he talks about this here he says that
[6:21] you know about a dead man he says tell a
[6:23] Dead Man He's a hypocrite and see what
[6:24] happens and what he's talking about is
[6:27] getting that Revelation in our lives
[6:28] about who we are having the new birth in
[6:30] our lives truly having his Spirit within
[6:33] us when we have his Spirit within us
[6:35] we're new creatures in Christ Jesus we
[6:36] are not the same carnal men that we were
[6:39] he says tell a Dead Man He's a hypocrite
[6:41] and see what happens kick him on the
[6:43] side and say you old hypocrite you
[6:47] he won't say a word he says he will not
[6:49] say a word did you ever kick something
[6:52] that's dead
[6:53] it doesn't squirm
[6:56] usually stinks
[6:58] it just doesn't even move
[7:01] brother Bradham says and that's right
[7:02] he'll just lay there kick him in the
[7:04] side call him a hypocrite and a man
[7:06] that's dead in Christ
[7:08] you can call him a hypocrite
[7:10] call him anything you want to
[7:13] and he'll never rise up about it
[7:15] I just love this part this is the best
[7:17] part right here he says that man if
[7:20] anything
[7:21] he'll just slip off somewhere and pray
[7:23] for you
[7:25] he'll just slip off somewhere and pray
[7:26] for you
[7:28] how many of us could have someone come
[7:29] and call us a hypocrite
[7:31] and kick us in our side
[7:33] and not do something about it
[7:36] I believe we need to get to that place
[7:38] brothers and sisters we have to
[7:41] we have to brother Bradham says but oh
[7:44] some of them is very much alive
[7:47] and you know it there's some people you
[7:49] can't say anything to doesn't matter
[7:50] just even words you can't say anything
[7:52] to let alone if you've got a little
[7:54] prickly with them oh my you might even
[7:56] have a fight
[7:57] physical
[7:59] believers
[8:02] they're just not dead enough yet
[8:04] we need to get that Revelation into our
[8:06] souls not just in our minds
[8:09] and not just in our hearts brothers and
[8:10] sisters but all the way into our souls
[8:13] many people have still remained on the
[8:17] longest journey of their lives I heard
[8:19] this a little while ago and it's just
[8:20] gonna stick with me forever and the
[8:22] longest journey of many people's lives
[8:25] is the distance of that Revelation
[8:27] that's up in their head stuck in their
[8:29] head the distance to their heart to
[8:33] their soul the distance that that
[8:35] Revelation has to travel that 18 inches
[8:37] that it takes to get all the way down in
[8:40] there many people have had knowledge
[8:42] many people are Justified and Sanctified
[8:44] and even filled with the Holy Ghost on
[8:47] the carnal level on on the spirit level
[8:49] on the flesh level and and God has
[8:52] blessed them abundantly you can see it
[8:53] loud and clear in their lives but they
[8:55] still don't have that life inside them
[8:57] all the way down in their souls because
[8:59] if you were to accidentally kick them or
[9:01] even kick them on purpose but I don't
[9:03] believe a Christian would ever kick
[9:04] someone on purpose a true Christian a
[9:06] True Believer if somebody actually did
[9:08] get look out those people who don't have
[9:11] the Holy Ghost all the way down my
[9:14] goodness
[9:15] the power of God will manifest in in a
[9:18] life of a son and daughter of God
[9:19] brothers and sisters we don't have to
[9:21] try and drum up the works we don't have
[9:22] to try and drum anything up it just
[9:24] happens the signs and the Wonders they
[9:26] follow these signs shall follow those
[9:29] people who believe Mark 16 in action the
[9:31] only true church the only church that
[9:35] Christ claims as his own Mark 16 in
[9:37] action the power of God will manifest
[9:41] you know he goes in his message adoption
[9:43] in in in adoption uh
[9:47] I think it's the fourth one
[9:49] I could be wrong sorry about the the
[9:51] lack of transparency on which one it is
[9:54] but he's talking about uh Adam and and
[9:57] losing his sonship here he says and he
[10:00] lost oh his godship and he lost his
[10:02] sonship he lost his domain and Satan
[10:05] took it over and we know that Adam
[10:07] willfully did that Adam wasn't deceived
[10:10] the woman was
[10:12] the serpent deceived the woman
[10:15] and Out of Love Adam
[10:17] followed his wife
[10:19] because he loved her so much
[10:22] and you know the same thing happened to
[10:23] Christ in the church
[10:25] the church
[10:27] stepped out
[10:28] and and we didn't do it
[10:30] but it just happened that way we're now
[10:32] beneficiaries of that curse and and
[10:35] Christ
[10:36] our husband
[10:38] stepped out after us
[10:40] to bring us back
[10:42] brother Branham says Satan took it over
[10:44] but brother
[10:46] we are waiting for the manifestations of
[10:48] the sons of God who will come back and
[10:50] take it over again
[10:52] and I can say with authority I can say
[10:55] for sure
[10:57] here we are
[10:59] brothers and sisters every single one of
[11:01] us who has had that Revelation drop in
[11:03] our heart we can say here we are there
[11:06] has to be someone sometime that says be
[11:09] it unto me according to Thy word there's
[11:12] got to be someone that can recognize
[11:14] that they are a son and daughter of God
[11:17] but brother we are waiting for the
[11:19] manifestations of the sons of God who
[11:21] will come back and take it over again
[11:24] Satan thinks he's God at all and he
[11:26] thinks he's got the Dominion and he
[11:28] thinks he's just going to take us down
[11:29] but you know what
[11:31] all of his power has been robbed
[11:35] and as much as he thinks it he knows it
[11:39] he's the greatest liar there ever was
[11:40] everything that he says he believes
[11:44] but we know it's a lie
[11:47] brother Adam says waiting for the
[11:49] fullness of time when the pyramid gets
[11:50] up to the top when the full sons of God
[11:54] will be manifested
[11:56] what's going to be the full sons of God
[11:58] brothers and sisters
[12:00] we just talked about it Mark 16 in
[12:02] action being the true church the one
[12:04] that Christ chooses as his own the only
[12:06] one that he calls his own the true
[12:09] church Mark 16 in action you know what
[12:11] waiting for the fullness of time when
[12:13] the pyramid gets up to the top when the
[12:14] full sons of God will be manifested it's
[12:17] just having the word
[12:19] it's being so far into the word and
[12:21] having the word so far into us that
[12:23] we're in that hedge that we're in that
[12:25] that cleft of the rock that we're in
[12:28] that that rock of Revelation in our
[12:30] lives that rock of Revelation is in our
[12:32] lives so far that we are the full
[12:34] manifestation of the sons of God the
[12:36] world will look at us and say look
[12:37] that's brother Mervin that's brother
[12:39] Faron that's brother Toby that's brother
[12:40] Justice that's brother Joel that's
[12:42] brother miles they're all the same
[12:43] people flesh and blood
[12:45] but something on the inside's way
[12:47] different than what the world sees
[12:49] way different than what the world sees
[12:52] waiting for the fullness of time when
[12:54] the pyramid gets to the top we know that
[12:56] we're at the top brothers and sisters we
[12:58] know that we're at the top and right at
[12:59] the top where that headstone comes down
[13:01] there's no mortar in between I remember
[13:03] brother Meadow saying that there's no
[13:05] mortar between The Headstone and the
[13:07] pyramid that Capstone Revelation is what
[13:09] it is brothers and sisters that Capstone
[13:11] Revelation about Christ in the true
[13:14] church is the manifestation of the sons
[13:16] of God and here we are when the full
[13:20] sons of God will be manifested when the
[13:22] power of God will walk out Hallelujah
[13:25] and will take every Power that Satan's
[13:27] got away from him yes sir it belongs to
[13:31] him
[13:32] he's not saying that it's being taken
[13:34] away God isn't taking that power away
[13:37] he's saying the manifested sons of God
[13:39] are taking that power away I'll just
[13:41] read it all again waiting for the
[13:42] fullness of time when the pyramid gets
[13:43] up to the top where the full sons of God
[13:45] will be manifested when the power of God
[13:48] will walk out the power of God in the
[13:51] manifested sons of God and will take
[13:53] every Power that Satan's got away from
[13:56] him yes sir it belongs to him you know
[13:58] brothers and sisters the word says that
[14:00] now we are the sons of God it just it
[14:03] just we just don't know what it will be
[14:05] but we know that when we shall see him
[14:08] that we shall be like him when he shall
[14:10] appear well she will look just like him
[14:12] and you know what it'll be it'll be our
[14:14] character brothers and sisters
[14:16] where he prudent prunes that hedge and
[14:19] just lets that little bit change in our
[14:21] lives and that little other bit change
[14:22] in our lives where Satan just gets a
[14:24] little bit and and just pokes us a
[14:26] little bit and gets our attention and we
[14:28] come back and we say yes daddy forgive
[14:30] me I know that I've overstepped I just
[14:32] want to be right I don't want to be
[14:33] wrong I want to be in line with your
[14:35] word and then he'll just let that hedge
[14:37] grow back in over there because that
[14:39] part of the character is developed
[14:40] enough and then maybe just another
[14:42] little part over here will just get
[14:43] opened up just a little bit just to
[14:45] correct us a little bit where we'll come
[14:46] back and say I'm so sorry Daddy forgive
[14:48] me I don't want to upset you I want to
[14:50] be in your perfect will be it unto me
[14:52] according to Thy Word
[14:55] brothers and sisters now we are the sons
[14:57] of God that's what the word says we
[14:59] don't have to wait to say that someday
[15:01] out there we're going to become a sons
[15:02] of God I believe that's one of the
[15:03] biggest tricks of the devil to the
[15:05] church today is for us to think that
[15:07] someday somewhere it's going to happen
[15:09] you know what it's already happened all
[15:11] of it's already happened Christ has
[15:13] already died and rose again and took the
[15:15] keys of death and Hell from Satan that's
[15:17] already happened the prophet of Malachi
[15:20] 4 has already come
[15:22] he's already descended with a shout and
[15:24] the voice and the Trump of the Archangel
[15:26] he's already given an open book He's
[15:28] already placed the sword back in the
[15:30] hands of men all that Adam has lost has
[15:32] already been given back what are we
[15:34] waiting for brothers and sisters it's
[15:35] time to start to speak those words to
[15:38] speak the words into existence now we
[15:41] are the sons of God we don't have to
[15:43] wait until another day someone has to
[15:46] rise up and say be it unto me according
[15:48] to Thy word Lord
[15:51] I personally believe it this is this is
[15:54] my opinion and I'm just going to say it
[15:55] I personally believe it that he's just
[15:57] waiting for us to recognize it he's just
[15:59] waiting for us to start saying someone
[16:01] has to do it someone has to cross over
[16:04] Jordan someone has to be the one to go
[16:06] into the promised land and Conquer The
[16:08] Devil and take away all the powers that
[16:11] he's got and it's not going and taking
[16:13] all the powers away and and and rushing
[16:15] over to my brother's house and and
[16:17] laying on of hands and anointing with
[16:18] oil and praying a holy prayer on him
[16:20] because I'm going to take away all the
[16:21] powers of Satan in my brother's life no
[16:24] it's going and getting on our knees and
[16:26] saying no you have no more power over me
[16:28] Satan you have no more power over this
[16:31] flesh Satan you have no more power over
[16:33] my family Satan this sacrifice is fresh
[16:36] right now I drive down a stake right now
[16:38] in the name of Jesus Christ again so you
[16:42] have no power and the more we do that
[16:44] the more we demonstrate that we truly
[16:46] are sons of God that we truly are coming
[16:49] into our position that it truly is the
[16:51] manifestation of the Son of God in the
[16:54] children's lives
[16:56] brother Adam says that remember we are
[16:58] now his bride
[17:00] we're not going to be someday we are now
[17:04] you know when we say bride Sons and
[17:06] Daughters same thing
[17:08] might sound a little weird to say it
[17:10] that way but it's the same comparison I
[17:13] would say even even even more
[17:16] Dominion to be a bride than it is to be
[17:18] a child
[17:19] wouldn't you think
[17:22] Esther had half of the Kingdom if she
[17:25] wanted it
[17:26] all she had to do was identify with the
[17:28] word for her day
[17:30] she just had to reach out and touch that
[17:32] scepter
[17:34] he says and remember now as his bride
[17:36] pregnanted with his Spirit oh my the
[17:39] church bearing Children See pregnated by
[17:42] his spirit with this name bearing his
[17:44] name bearing his life bringing forth the
[17:46] signs of his life evident with the
[17:48] preeminence as evidence of his
[17:50] resurrection showing that he is not dead
[17:53] but Alive forevermore Christ in you the
[17:57] hope of glory not just being associated
[17:59] with a church affiliated with a
[18:02] membership to something that's good that
[18:04] sounds wonderful that the the blessings
[18:06] fall and the people are nice no no no no
[18:08] no the living Jesus Christ in flesh
[18:11] again
[18:12] in our lives in our homes
[18:15] in our families in our church an
[18:18] Apostolic blessing in every one of our
[18:21] lives
[18:22] that we experience
[18:24] letting our children see a god with
[18:26] flesh on them
[18:28] not one of us wants to see our children
[18:29] grow up and become grossed out with the
[18:33] message of the hour
[18:34] none of us wants to see that
[18:37] and how is that going to not happen
[18:40] the children need to see God
[18:42] the children need to fear God the
[18:45] children need to have that revelation of
[18:47] the Lord Jesus Christ they have to go
[18:49] and and receive that rock of Revelation
[18:51] that we talked about earlier that place
[18:53] that's right beside God
[18:56] where they know it's the safest place
[18:58] because if they get out from under the
[19:00] blood you know what they've just stepped
[19:01] out from behind that hedge and you know
[19:03] there's no protection outside of that
[19:05] hedge unless God really wants you and
[19:08] you know if you are a son and daughter
[19:09] of God he might just let Satan Crush you
[19:12] but he can't touch your soul
[19:16] we don't want to get outside that hedge
[19:18] we want to stay right there right beside
[19:20] our trainer right beside the Lord Jesus
[19:23] Christ right there where that safest
[19:25] place is for us
[19:28] he says oh my the church bearing
[19:29] pregnated by his spirit with the name
[19:32] this name bearing his name bearing his
[19:34] life bringing forth the signs of his
[19:36] life evident with the preeminances
[19:37] evidence of his resurrection showing
[19:40] that he is not dead but Alive
[19:41] forevermore god with skin on him alive
[19:44] today this is eternal life and
[19:47] vindicates to the world that we are
[19:49] alive in him
[19:50] I'm sorry I threw a couple of sentences
[19:53] of my own Christ with flesh on him today
[19:55] this is a quote out of Christ The
[19:57] Mystery of God revealed I did a little
[19:59] paraphrasing I injected a sentence
[20:01] forgive me for it but brothers and
[20:03] sisters that's what our families need to
[20:04] see that's what the world needs to see
[20:06] the world doesn't want to see another
[20:08] church passing around the offering plate
[20:10] getting together and being holy and then
[20:13] getting out into the world and just
[20:14] being whoever you are people want to see
[20:17] Jesus Christ people want to see the Life
[20:20] of Christ if you could show people the
[20:22] true sign of the true witness of the
[20:24] Lord Jesus Christ you would get their
[20:26] attention and you know what every single
[20:28] time that we go into this world and we
[20:30] talk to people and and we deal with
[20:32] people we interact with people they know
[20:34] it we've talked about it so many times
[20:36] they'll apologize for swearing without
[20:38] even understanding why they've
[20:39] apologized for swearing it's because
[20:41] they've come into the presence of the
[20:43] almighty God and don't even know it but
[20:46] something on the inside of the inside
[20:47] recognizes it remember when Jesus Christ
[20:49] was here the most religious just people
[20:51] of the day they couldn't understand that
[20:53] he was God but the Devils recognized
[20:55] them the Devils cried out and said oh
[20:58] what have we done that you've come to us
[21:00] before the time please don't send us all
[21:02] the way back just let us go into that
[21:04] herd of pigs over there can you imagine
[21:05] that the devil's recognized it but the
[21:08] most religious people just went right by
[21:10] them he was a heretic in their day same
[21:13] thing for us brothers and sisters that's
[21:15] why people can't recognize him but you
[21:17] know
[21:18] there's a few people that will
[21:20] as we live our lives every single one of
[21:22] us has a testimony somewhere along the
[21:24] way some how some person the Lord Jesus
[21:27] Christ in flesh he came and introduced
[21:29] himself and told us of his grace
[21:32] showed us that there was a better way
[21:33] showed us that we were actually not just
[21:36] called into an association but that
[21:38] we've been called from before the
[21:39] foundation of the world to come and
[21:42] actually partake at his table that
[21:43] there's actually a place marker with
[21:45] your name from before the foundation of
[21:47] the world at the marriage supper of the
[21:49] Lamb
[21:50] can you imagine that every one of us has
[21:53] to come every one of us has to learn it
[21:55] that there is something for us
[21:58] it's because of Revelation
[22:00] it's that rock of Revelation brothers
[22:01] and sisters and everyone has the
[22:04] opportunity to hear about it if we don't
[22:06] go and interact in this world if we
[22:07] don't deal with people in this world how
[22:09] will they ever know about our testimony
[22:10] how will they ever know who we are
[22:16] this is eternal life brother Branham
[22:17] says and vindicates to the world that we
[22:21] are alive in him
[22:24] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[22:27] you know there's another little thing
[22:28] here I'll just call the musicians as we
[22:31] start to wrap it up here
[22:33] we're going to have service again on
[22:34] Wednesday and then again on Sunday and I
[22:37] don't want to wear the people out
[22:39] but you know
[22:41] there comes a point in time brothers and
[22:43] sisters where I believe I trust that
[22:45] we're all
[22:46] feeling good these days with where
[22:49] things are at
[22:50] in terms of the church and the stability
[22:52] in the church
[22:54] you know we might not understand some of
[22:55] the things that are happening or or not
[22:58] happening maybe according to the way
[22:59] things were before or what we want to
[23:02] see things maybe be like in the future
[23:04] but you know just like in Jesus day
[23:07] there were things that were happening
[23:09] that were confusing for the people
[23:11] and the people didn't really understand
[23:13] it necessarily
[23:15] but you know what there was something in
[23:17] their hearts that just said amen
[23:20] when the word came
[23:22] and and I just I've just had this
[23:25] thought on my heart
[23:28] you know
[23:30] I apologize if I'm certainly not what
[23:33] maybe you anticipated as a pastor here
[23:37] because
[23:39] if we have an idea in our mind that
[23:41] something should be a certain way
[23:43] and and it doesn't turn out the way that
[23:45] we want it to be it can be a very
[23:46] difficult thing for us to actually just
[23:49] go forwards with joy to go forwards with
[23:53] happiness in our lives
[23:54] [Music]
[23:55] but you know even if we see things that
[23:57] maybe aren't the way that we would like
[23:59] them to be if I could just encourage one
[24:02] thing
[24:03] when you hear the word just say Amen to
[24:05] it
[24:06] just say Amen to it Mary might not have
[24:09] understood what was happening when
[24:11] Gabriel came to her and said
[24:13] hail
[24:14] thou highly favored among women
[24:19] but she said amen to the word
[24:23] brothers and sisters just say Amen to
[24:25] the word
[24:27] God will use even a donkey to speak to
[24:32] man
[24:33] and if he wants to call me a donkey hey
[24:37] I want to serve him with all my might
[24:40] I don't want to put myself anywhere the
[24:42] only thing I want to do is try and
[24:43] encourage everyone to come to that place
[24:45] where they see the fullness of Christ in
[24:47] them that they would be able to say this
[24:49] is eternal life and and that my life
[24:51] vindicates not me Barry Johnson but us
[24:54] individually Our Lives it indicates it
[24:58] vindicates to the world around us that
[25:00] we have him alive and well in US
[25:04] that's my desire brothers and sisters
[25:06] not not to try and promote my agenda or
[25:08] my ideas just to to maybe have the ball
[25:12] and try and run with all my might and
[25:15] see if we can get it a few more yards
[25:17] down the field and and if the Lord
[25:20] should tarry someone else will get the
[25:22] ball it's the way it works we don't want
[25:25] to try and take it from anyone we want
[25:27] to try and encourage what God's doing
[25:30] but brothers and sisters just say Amen
[25:32] even if you don't understand it just
[25:34] just say Amen Mary I don't think she
[25:36] necessarily understood it do you think
[25:38] she understood it what the angel was
[25:40] telling her maybe she had a teaching
[25:42] that that she understood that Isaiah
[25:43] said that you know there there would be
[25:45] a sign that that a virgin shall concede
[25:48] maybe she was taught that in her life
[25:49] but she could could she understand that
[25:51] it was her could she understand how
[25:53] there's no understanding of it
[25:56] did Hattie Wright understand
[26:00] to speak squirrels into existence
[26:04] something in her that eternal life from
[26:06] before the foundation of the world it
[26:08] just said it just said that ain't
[26:10] nothing but the truth
[26:12] and you know what was in her heart
[26:14] manifested in her mouth and came out and
[26:18] because she said amen to the word what
[26:20] did the prophet of God say God just told
[26:23] me to give you anything that you want in
[26:25] the name of Jesus Christ
[26:28] brothers and sisters if we're in Christ
[26:30] today just say Amen to the word just say
[26:33] Amen to the word don't get caught up in
[26:35] the flesh don't get caught up in the in
[26:38] the church don't get caught up in all
[26:39] the things of Life the time is short
[26:42] we're at the Finish Line it's time to
[26:44] keep pressing on more than ever
[26:46] encourage one another exhort one another
[26:48] even more so as you see the day
[26:50] approaching
[26:53] brothers and sisters we are here
[26:56] every one of these people Mary and
[26:58] sister Hattie you know they had one
[27:00] thing in common stand with me this
[27:02] morning you know what they had in common
[27:03] they believed
[27:05] and I believe the same thing brothers
[27:06] and sisters
[27:07] I I don't want to be standing here on my
[27:10] own Steam on my own
[27:12] my own
[27:14] idea
[27:16] I I only want to be serving the lord
[27:18] that's my desire is to see the Lord
[27:21] served and to see the brothers and the
[27:24] sisters in this church just grow to the
[27:26] fullness the full stature of a perfect
[27:29] man to see the Lord Jesus Christ
[27:30] vindicate himself personally to each and
[27:33] every life that the children would see
[27:36] God with flesh on that when the children
[27:38] are confronted with things in their
[27:39] lives they would have such an anointing
[27:41] of the spirit of God in their lives that
[27:44] the children around them would all not
[27:46] just have peer pressure but they would
[27:48] say oh no we need to leave them alone
[27:50] because they're special there's
[27:51] something special about them that the
[27:53] spirits that are within those kids
[27:55] trying to put peer pressure on everyone
[27:57] else would say no no no no no no oh no
[28:00] that's highly favored among God we need
[28:03] to leave that one alone that's what we
[28:05] need brothers and sisters that's my
[28:07] desire is to see the power of God live
[28:09] out through our lives in such a way that
[28:11] maybe we have never seen before
[28:15] let's just bow before him this morning

[1:00:50] foundation of the world

[1:02:39] God bless you welcome to the house of
[1:02:41] the Lord once again
[1:02:43] Sunday morning in honor of the
[1:02:46] Resurrection
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:48] we know that it was in the morning that
[1:02:50] people started to understand
[1:02:53] that there actually was a resurrection
[1:02:56] and that's why we gather Sunday mornings
[1:03:00] not because of tradition
[1:03:02] in honor of that Resurrection because we
[1:03:05] know one of these days
[1:03:06] Everything Will Change
[1:03:11] once again welcome to the house of the
[1:03:13] Lord God bless you musicians thank you
[1:03:16] so much
[1:03:17] if you have your Bibles today
[1:03:20] we have a couple of scriptures we'd like
[1:03:22] to get into
[1:03:23] Maybe
[1:03:25] look at things just a little bit
[1:03:28] differently today
[1:03:31] many times we have ideas and thoughts
[1:03:33] and trust that the Lord will lead us and
[1:03:36] guide us
[1:03:38] here
[1:03:39] I'd like to read from Matthew chapter
[1:03:41] 16.
[1:03:43] verses 13 to 18.
[1:03:52] Matthew chapter 16.
[1:03:56] verses 13.
[1:03:58] to 18.
[1:04:02] a very familiar scripture
[1:04:05] just trust the Lord will speak to us
[1:04:07] today
[1:04:08] when Jesus came into the coast of
[1:04:10] caesarea Philippi
[1:04:12] he asked his disciples saying whom do
[1:04:15] men say that I the son of man am
[1:04:20] and they said some say that thou art
[1:04:22] John the Baptist
[1:04:24] some Elias
[1:04:26] and others Jeremiah's or one of the
[1:04:29] prophets
[1:04:31] and he said unto them but whom say ye
[1:04:34] that I am
[1:04:36] and Simon Peter answered and said Thou
[1:04:39] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:04:43] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:04:46] blessed art thou Simon barjona
[1:04:49] for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[1:04:51] unto thee
[1:04:53] but my Father which is in heaven
[1:04:56] and I say also unto thee that thou art
[1:04:58] Peter and Upon This Rock will I build my
[1:05:02] church
[1:05:03] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:05:06] against it
[1:05:08] verse 19 and I will give unto thee the
[1:05:11] Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and
[1:05:13] whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[1:05:15] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:05:18] Thou shalt loose on Earth
[1:05:20] shall be loosed in heaven
[1:05:23] let's just bow one more time
[1:05:25] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[1:05:28] your word
[1:05:29] we thank you Lord that it's not just a a
[1:05:31] word a page of History it's not a an
[1:05:36] encyclopedia or a theological study but
[1:05:39] it's truly a Living Word it's a Living
[1:05:42] Sacrifice it's a living person and every
[1:05:45] time we speak your word it brings you to
[1:05:48] life and father we pray that you would
[1:05:50] just take these words that are spoken
[1:05:52] today take this scripture that was just
[1:05:55] read and just reveal it to us further
[1:05:57] Lord according to your will today
[1:06:00] and will be careful to give you all the
[1:06:02] glory we just love you and we thank you
[1:06:04] Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:06:07] God bless you you may be seated this
[1:06:09] morning
[1:06:12] it's certainly nice to see some good
[1:06:14] weather some milder temperatures outside
[1:06:17] we've been very fortunate this year and
[1:06:20] we haven't had a a terrible winter so
[1:06:23] we're certainly not complaining but boy
[1:06:24] oh boy when we start to hear the birds
[1:06:27] change their songs they start to sing a
[1:06:31] different song when the weather gets
[1:06:33] nice isn't it an amazing sort of a type
[1:06:37] there's going to be a different song
[1:06:39] sung in heaven when that when that
[1:06:42] weather changes
[1:06:43] when the redeemed are there
[1:06:46] you know our brother I just asked the
[1:06:48] Lord I ask him every time to just
[1:06:50] confirm his word
[1:06:51] I talked to Lisa many times
[1:06:55] my wife about this and trying to get
[1:06:57] ready for a service and you know she'll
[1:07:00] ask what are you going to talk about and
[1:07:02] I say you know I have a few ideas a few
[1:07:04] thoughts and and and stuff and
[1:07:08] I say that you know I just don't want to
[1:07:10] go and speak just to speak
[1:07:13] you want to bring something fresh and
[1:07:15] and new something that will encourage
[1:07:18] God's children that will feed his sheep
[1:07:21] so it could be so easy to just come and
[1:07:23] and speak eloquently but
[1:07:26] boy
[1:07:27] we just sure love when he confirms his
[1:07:29] word and that's what I'm getting at this
[1:07:31] morning I ask him to confirm his word
[1:07:33] just to show me a little just a little
[1:07:35] sign something that will just make me
[1:07:37] feel good just give me that courage to
[1:07:39] know that this isn't just Barry's
[1:07:41] thoughts I don't want to bring you my
[1:07:43] thoughts I I don't have anything to
[1:07:45] bring
[1:07:47] you know
[1:07:49] just hearing brother Mervin pray you
[1:07:51] know all we need is one word from him
[1:07:54] if we could just hear him speak the word
[1:07:56] to us
[1:07:57] to just have that little confirmation
[1:07:59] that we need in our lives and when he
[1:08:01] was praying he just made me think about
[1:08:03] it when he said just speak the word the
[1:08:05] the Centurion you know he said I'm I'm
[1:08:07] not even worthy to come under your roof
[1:08:09] to have you come under my roof I'm I'm a
[1:08:12] gentile and you're a Jew but just speak
[1:08:14] the word if you could just speak one
[1:08:16] word to me you would actually bring all
[1:08:19] that I ever need in one word and and boy
[1:08:23] oh boy Jesus we know he said to his
[1:08:25] disciples there I haven't seen such
[1:08:27] faith not even in Israel and here is a
[1:08:30] gentile speaking this kind of thing to
[1:08:32] me
[1:08:33] my goodness
[1:08:35] we just want him to speak the word today
[1:08:39] amen I have a quote here that I'd like
[1:08:41] to start out with just as a little bit
[1:08:43] of encouragement maybe for someone
[1:08:45] somewhere somehow I don't know how this
[1:08:47] this happens all the time but it does
[1:08:49] the Lord just puts something there so
[1:08:52] you know what brothers and sisters some
[1:08:54] someday
[1:08:55] someday
[1:08:56] um
[1:08:57] isn't good for much
[1:08:59] if we tell ourselves someday if we tell
[1:09:01] our children someday even though someday
[1:09:04] there will be a rapture
[1:09:06] but someday
[1:09:08] there has to come a day
[1:09:10] where people recognize who they are
[1:09:16] we were sowed with the word
[1:09:19] someday I'll bring the life into the
[1:09:21] Earth and replenish it replenish the
[1:09:24] Earth
[1:09:24] what he failed to do Mary did
[1:09:27] she took the word
[1:09:30] just that one word
[1:09:32] she just took it
[1:09:33] and through Mary seed replenishes the
[1:09:35] Earth again through his bride through
[1:09:38] the word and will bring up the
[1:09:40] millennium
[1:09:41] out of the spoken word is the Original
[1:09:43] Seed
[1:09:45] I believe we're going to get into the
[1:09:47] seed discussion soon but just to think
[1:09:49] about how we're starting to see the
[1:09:51] milder temperatures you can hear a
[1:09:53] change in the songs that the birds sing
[1:09:55] we don't really have the new the the new
[1:09:57] birds back yet the birds that fly south
[1:09:59] that migrate to go to warmer
[1:10:01] temperatures but you know you can see
[1:10:03] the sun is getting taller in the sky the
[1:10:06] the sun is shining higher the days are
[1:10:10] getting longer the sun rises earlier
[1:10:12] it's it's a wonderful time because it
[1:10:15] just like Sunday morning is on honor of
[1:10:18] the Resurrection the springtime it just
[1:10:21] speaks of Resurrection it speaks of Life
[1:10:24] coming back out of the ground all the
[1:10:26] entire cycle is is happening and we know
[1:10:29] that that seed Gene of God is on Earth
[1:10:31] again just waiting for the the
[1:10:33] springtime the resurrection and Rapture
[1:10:36] to take place and it's never been closer
[1:10:40] out of the spoken word is the Original
[1:10:42] Seed is what we just read
[1:10:45] before we get too far we got a couple of
[1:10:47] announcements
[1:10:49] Monday March 22nd
[1:10:52] could be a real special day around here
[1:10:54] that could be the day that they change
[1:10:56] the restrictions if we keep on keeping
[1:10:59] on the trajectory that we are in Alberta
[1:11:01] the government might relax the
[1:11:03] restrictions
[1:11:05] um Monday March 22nd is the target date
[1:11:08] on the AHS website hopefully we can get
[1:11:11] there and begin to Fellowship together
[1:11:14] again here in church
[1:11:16] so I would say that if if it does change
[1:11:18] on the 22nd
[1:11:20] um
[1:11:22] I hope that we have some people that
[1:11:24] want to come to church on Wednesday
[1:11:25] night
[1:11:26] the 24th of March could be a real good
[1:11:30] service
[1:11:31] to see everyone here
[1:11:34] today I want to talk about a hidden life
[1:11:37] and uh that's really sort of the
[1:11:39] direction that I want to go with this
[1:11:40] service today that I felt impressed to
[1:11:42] talk about
[1:11:44] just understanding that as a believer
[1:11:47] we live a life that's strange
[1:11:49] but we live a life that's hidden in
[1:11:51] Christ
[1:11:52] and uh
[1:11:54] it's by revelation
[1:11:56] that's the only way we can do it
[1:11:58] we know that many people they they live
[1:12:02] a religious life
[1:12:03] because they're Associated to a church
[1:12:05] they they live a a special life because
[1:12:08] out of their tradition that their
[1:12:10] families give to them they're they're a
[1:12:12] part of a a traditional form of worship
[1:12:16] and and each one believes that they're
[1:12:19] living a hidden life
[1:12:20] but isn't it amazing to know that God
[1:12:23] wouldn't leave us in the dark groping in
[1:12:25] darkness gross Darkness upon the land he
[1:12:28] would take the darkest of Ages and
[1:12:31] actually give us the fullest of word
[1:12:33] give us the entirety of the word so that
[1:12:36] we can get the maximum Revelation for
[1:12:39] our day
[1:12:40] so talking about Revelation I just I'm
[1:12:43] going to step back and and do a little
[1:12:46] um
[1:12:47] I guess just read a quote from the
[1:12:48] church age book The Seven the the the uh
[1:12:52] the revelations of the seven Church ages
[1:12:56] it's out of the introduction brother
[1:12:57] Branham says the importance of
[1:12:58] Revelation by the spirit
[1:13:00] to a True Believer can never be over
[1:13:03] emphasized
[1:13:04] Revelation means more to you than
[1:13:06] perhaps you realize now I'm not talking
[1:13:08] about this book of Revelation Revelation
[1:13:11] the book of symbols the last book of the
[1:13:13] Bible he's not talking about that he's
[1:13:14] talking about the understanding that God
[1:13:16] gives to the individual
[1:13:18] it's it's the new birth is what brother
[1:13:20] Branham calls it God revealing himself
[1:13:22] personally to the individual the
[1:13:25] revelation of who God is revelation
[1:13:28] means more to you than perhaps you
[1:13:29] realize now I'm not talking about this
[1:13:32] book of Revelation and you I'm talking
[1:13:35] about all Revelation it's tremendously
[1:13:38] important to the church
[1:13:41] now we get into the scripture that we
[1:13:43] read in this quote here he says do you
[1:13:45] remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked
[1:13:47] the disciples this question whom do men
[1:13:49] say that I the son of man am
[1:13:53] and they said some some say that thou
[1:13:56] art John the Baptist some Elias others
[1:13:59] jeremius or one of the prophets
[1:14:02] but then he narrows it down
[1:14:04] and he says that's fine for all them
[1:14:06] that's what they say but who do you say
[1:14:10] that I am
[1:14:11] brings it to the personal level and
[1:14:14] that's brothers and sisters where we are
[1:14:15] today
[1:14:16] associations are fine and good but
[1:14:19] they're not going to save you
[1:14:21] it's the personal revelation of Jesus
[1:14:24] Christ to you individually
[1:14:26] that will make you eligible to be saved
[1:14:30] I don't even want to talk necessarily
[1:14:32] right now at this point about the
[1:14:33] resurrection and Rapture just
[1:14:34] understanding that salvation is
[1:14:37] revelation the only way that we can be
[1:14:40] saved is by a revelation that Jesus
[1:14:43] Christ died 2 000 years ago and rose
[1:14:45] again
[1:14:46] but you know brother Branham says
[1:14:47] somewhere in the message what good is
[1:14:49] that for me that he died back there if
[1:14:52] he's not alive in my life right now
[1:14:55] what good is it to us to know a Christ
[1:14:58] that died 2 000 years ago and you know
[1:15:00] there's millions and billions of people
[1:15:01] out there worshiping under that Banner
[1:15:03] that Christ died 2 000 years ago but
[1:15:06] they're not living a life like he's
[1:15:07] alive in them today and that really is
[1:15:10] the true Revelation is Christ needs to
[1:15:12] be alive in us today if he's not alive
[1:15:16] in us today brothers and sisters we are
[1:15:18] not Christians
[1:15:19] we are not Christians because Christian
[1:15:22] means christ-like
[1:15:23] and it doesn't mean cloaking myself in a
[1:15:26] in a religious garment we went and
[1:15:29] bought some uh we bought some uh
[1:15:31] utensils some trays and some cups for
[1:15:34] doing communion up in Edmonton at a at a
[1:15:37] at a supply store up there for churches
[1:15:40] and it says it's an uh
[1:15:41] interdenominational I think is what it
[1:15:43] said or multi-denominational but I'll
[1:15:46] tell you uh I was with brother Curtis
[1:15:48] and and it's mostly uh Catholic
[1:15:51] incredible
[1:15:53] but uh while we were up there I I had a
[1:15:55] look at a couple of garments I was you
[1:15:57] know we had talked about it so much in
[1:15:59] the past about having Robes of his
[1:16:01] righteousness and and having a clean
[1:16:03] white garment and and how people they
[1:16:05] wear these garments and and they
[1:16:07] actually sell them there and I thought
[1:16:08] wouldn't that be funny to to get one of
[1:16:11] those robes I don't even know what they
[1:16:12] call them but you know what good would
[1:16:15] that do me to put on a robe it wouldn't
[1:16:17] do me anything I would have just put on
[1:16:19] a row but I'd still be the filthy me
[1:16:21] underneath and that's what everyone does
[1:16:23] if they don't accept the word for their
[1:16:25] hour they're still wearing just a robe
[1:16:28] but it's filthy it's as filthy rags
[1:16:31] before God that's what the word says our
[1:16:33] righteousness is but filthy rags before
[1:16:36] him
[1:16:37] we need to come according to the word
[1:16:38] for our day the only way we can do that
[1:16:40] is by revelation
[1:16:43] he saith unto them but whom say ye that
[1:16:45] I am and Simon Peter answered and said
[1:16:47] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:16:49] Living God and Jesus answered and said
[1:16:51] unto him blessed art thou Simon bar
[1:16:52] Jonah
[1:16:54] for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[1:16:56] unto thee but my Father which is in
[1:16:59] heaven hath revealed it unto thee how
[1:17:03] did that happen
[1:17:04] it was a revelation
[1:17:06] it was you know we'll just speak plainly
[1:17:09] as human beings it was a fresh thought
[1:17:11] call it a thought that came into the
[1:17:14] heart of Simon
[1:17:16] but suddenly he had an understanding
[1:17:18] that was beyond his wreck recognition as
[1:17:21] a human being Beyond his thinking he had
[1:17:23] something that just spoke to him that
[1:17:25] just gave him the understanding of who
[1:17:27] Jesus was
[1:17:29] and that's what happens to us when we
[1:17:31] get saved something tells us
[1:17:34] more about who we are something tells us
[1:17:37] that we're more than just people we're
[1:17:39] more than just associate members we're
[1:17:42] more than just message believers
[1:17:44] were more than conquerors
[1:17:47] not because we can read the Bible and I
[1:17:49] can skillfully pull up a scripture
[1:17:51] faster than anyone else can if you say
[1:17:53] the word and I'll just go and find it no
[1:17:55] it's because we've got revelation
[1:17:58] we've got the revelation of the Lord
[1:17:59] Jesus Christ Living in US
[1:18:02] the word says take no thought for what
[1:18:04] you shall say in that day because of
[1:18:07] Revelation because he will give it to us
[1:18:09] he'll give us the words to speak that we
[1:18:12] need when we need them
[1:18:15] blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh
[1:18:17] and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[1:18:18] but my Father which is in heaven and I
[1:18:20] say unto thee that thou art Peter and
[1:18:22] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[1:18:25] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:18:27] against it
[1:18:29] the Roman Catholics say the church is
[1:18:32] built upon Peter
[1:18:35] imagine that not just the Catholic
[1:18:37] Church
[1:18:38] many churches
[1:18:40] I believe that I haven't listened to
[1:18:42] many denominational teachings as of late
[1:18:46] for probably the last decade
[1:18:48] but I doubt they're preaching Revelation
[1:18:50] I doubt that they're preaching this this
[1:18:53] level of discussion
[1:18:56] the message of the hour brother Branham
[1:18:58] says now that's really carnal
[1:19:01] that they would say the church is built
[1:19:03] upon Peter but wait a second didn't
[1:19:04] Jesus say thou art Peter upon thee will
[1:19:08] build this church Upon This Rock we'll
[1:19:11] build a church calling Peter a rock
[1:19:15] brother Branham says now that's really
[1:19:16] carnal how could God build a church Upon
[1:19:18] A man that's so unstable that he denied
[1:19:20] the Lord Jesus and he cursed while doing
[1:19:23] it
[1:19:26] God can't build his church upon any man
[1:19:29] born in sin
[1:19:31] remember this is a church without spot
[1:19:33] or wrinkle
[1:19:36] this is a church dressed in his garments
[1:19:39] his righteousness
[1:19:41] this is a church that's willing to say
[1:19:43] be it unto me Lord according to thy will
[1:19:46] be it unto me according to Thy word I I
[1:19:50] I have nothing to bring on my own Lord
[1:19:52] on our knees in the morning saying to
[1:19:54] him Lord just forgive me for every sin
[1:19:57] in my life not if I've sinned forgive me
[1:19:59] for every sin because I'm a man of
[1:20:01] unclean lips I am a man that's not
[1:20:03] worthy there's something in us that
[1:20:05] recognizes this robe is not of
[1:20:08] righteousness this robe has to perish
[1:20:11] but you know brothers and sisters when
[1:20:12] we come to that level that we make that
[1:20:14] sacrifice fresh every single day in our
[1:20:16] lives because of that Revelation that we
[1:20:18] have about who we are and who Jesus
[1:20:21] really is you know what happens is we
[1:20:23] start to speak out to our new bodies our
[1:20:26] new bodies our new theophany bodies are
[1:20:28] just right right there just just calling
[1:20:31] out to us saying amen preach it brother
[1:20:33] amen just keep praying amen just keep
[1:20:36] sacrificing don't give up just keep
[1:20:38] pressing on
[1:20:39] because there's a tremendous prize
[1:20:41] waiting for you at the end
[1:20:44] he says God can't build his church upon
[1:20:46] any man born in sin and it wasn't some
[1:20:48] rock lying there as though God had
[1:20:50] hallowed the ground at that spot even
[1:20:52] though they have a place I believe I
[1:20:55] could be wrong but I think they have a
[1:20:56] place where they say that that's what
[1:20:58] happened and the first thing that
[1:20:59] happened the Catholic Church went in and
[1:21:01] built up a church and made an altar and
[1:21:04] we know that in Rome they've got the
[1:21:05] same thing they've got Saint Peter's
[1:21:06] Cathedral and and it's a tremendous
[1:21:09] thing and they say that Saint Peter's
[1:21:10] actually buried there under the altar
[1:21:13] that they've got that church is
[1:21:14] tremendous
[1:21:16] God can't build his church upon any man
[1:21:18] born in sin and it wasn't some rock
[1:21:21] lying there as though God hallowed the
[1:21:23] spot that that ground
[1:21:25] but many times people will do that
[1:21:27] they'll look at the carnal and they'll
[1:21:28] just grab onto it
[1:21:30] will celebrate the things that are
[1:21:31] tangible in our lives
[1:21:34] but that's what makes Revelation so
[1:21:36] special it's God revealing himself
[1:21:38] personally to us that makes it so
[1:21:41] special because nobody can take that
[1:21:42] away from you
[1:21:44] it's kind of like going and getting a
[1:21:45] University degree I would think
[1:21:48] you can go and go to school and go to
[1:21:50] school and go to school and you do all
[1:21:51] the learning and you might not remember
[1:21:52] all the learning but eventually you wind
[1:21:54] up with something with your name on it
[1:21:56] it doesn't matter you don't have the
[1:21:58] diploma anymore you could
[1:22:00] see it disappear but you have that
[1:22:02] training you've met the requirements
[1:22:04] nobody can ever take away that degree
[1:22:06] from you you understand you've studied
[1:22:09] you've learned that Revelation is inside
[1:22:11] you now and you know that's what happens
[1:22:13] when we get the the word we get
[1:22:16] salvation in our lives it's a revelation
[1:22:18] to us it's not something that somebody
[1:22:20] gives us not to compare it to the
[1:22:23] University degree somebody can't say
[1:22:25] that you have now you have now graduated
[1:22:27] come up and and receive your degree in
[1:22:30] the message of the hour no no no no no
[1:22:32] it's God revealing himself personally to
[1:22:35] us
[1:22:36] and there isn't a special place
[1:22:39] even now many people
[1:22:41] you know back in in brother branham's
[1:22:42] day in in the Cod books if you want to
[1:22:44] go back and look at it in the Cod books
[1:22:47] I find it astounding actually these are
[1:22:49] people that were around when God's
[1:22:50] Prophet was here isn't it amazing to see
[1:22:53] that you know brother Bradham he brought
[1:22:55] it out so clear God's Prophet for our
[1:22:57] day that he said you know many times we
[1:23:00] say if we were there in Jesus day we
[1:23:03] would have been there in all the
[1:23:04] meetings if we were there in Jesus day
[1:23:07] we we would have supported with
[1:23:09] everything that we had in us if we were
[1:23:10] there in Jesus day you know brother
[1:23:12] Bradham says he says whatever you are
[1:23:13] today that's what you would have been
[1:23:15] there then
[1:23:16] you wouldn't be any different because
[1:23:18] this is your day this is the day the
[1:23:21] Lord has made are you going to rejoice
[1:23:23] and be glad in it or are you going to
[1:23:25] say oh if I was at another day then I
[1:23:27] could serve God better brothers and
[1:23:29] sisters there's no better day for you to
[1:23:31] serve God it's right now right here
[1:23:33] according to the revelation of the
[1:23:35] message of the hour
[1:23:37] God didn't hallow the ground at that
[1:23:39] spot God didn't hallow the ground on
[1:23:42] Sunset Mountain
[1:23:44] God didn't hallow the ground in
[1:23:47] Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:23:50] God didn't hallow the ground in Calgary
[1:23:52] Alberta
[1:23:54] well maybe he did a little bit
[1:23:57] but he still gives us cold weather
[1:24:00] he didn't hallow any ground on this
[1:24:02] Earth what he did do was he hallowed the
[1:24:05] ground that he wants to Tabernacle in
[1:24:08] the Tabernacle of the Saints the hearts
[1:24:11] of the children
[1:24:13] but the Protestants say that the church
[1:24:15] is built upon Jesus
[1:24:18] it was the revelation
[1:24:21] brother Branham says read it the way
[1:24:22] it's written Flesh and Blood hath not
[1:24:25] revealed it but my father hath revealed
[1:24:29] it
[1:24:30] and Upon This Rock
[1:24:33] he says in Brackets revelation
[1:24:36] will I build my church
[1:24:39] the church is built on Revelation
[1:24:42] on thus saith the Lord It's not built on
[1:24:45] a man
[1:24:47] and it's not built in a location because
[1:24:49] the ground is hallowed that's man's
[1:24:52] doing that's that's Satan's doing you
[1:24:55] know we've talked many times about Cain
[1:24:57] and Abel and and that's just a direct
[1:24:59] example that brother Bradham goes into
[1:25:00] later on in the church age book right
[1:25:02] after I think it's the very next
[1:25:03] paragraph of what I've just read
[1:25:05] um he goes into the the story of Cain
[1:25:08] and Abel and and Cain and Abel they both
[1:25:11] brought sacrifices they both brought
[1:25:13] their sacrifice to the house of the Lord
[1:25:16] they wanted to worship they were both
[1:25:18] raised by their parents by by Adam and
[1:25:21] Eve
[1:25:22] they were both given the teachings the
[1:25:25] instructions I'm not saying that Cain is
[1:25:27] of Adam I'm just for the record but
[1:25:29] they're raised by their their carnal
[1:25:30] parents they both instructed them they
[1:25:33] taught them how to eat and and how to
[1:25:34] live their lives but both of them had an
[1:25:37] idea a revelation from somewhere of how
[1:25:40] they should worship and one of them
[1:25:42] brought a a a a fruit of the field
[1:25:45] Revelation and that one wasn't accepted
[1:25:48] and the other one brought a revelation
[1:25:50] of a sacrifice of a bloody lamb and we
[1:25:53] talked about them and I don't really
[1:25:54] want to spend a whole lot of time but
[1:25:56] what I do want to say is that perhaps
[1:25:58] there well not perhaps there was a time
[1:26:00] for sure and according to the Old
[1:26:03] Testament law Jesus Christ is saying
[1:26:04] yesterday today and forever the mighty
[1:26:06] Jehovah the same one it's not two or
[1:26:09] three it's the same one there is a time
[1:26:12] for an offering from the field
[1:26:15] there is a time for a heave offering
[1:26:17] there is a time to bring in the sheaves
[1:26:20] and and offer them before the Lord to
[1:26:22] have the showbread to to offer of the
[1:26:24] fruit of the field
[1:26:26] but that wasn't the requirement for that
[1:26:28] sacrifice for that worship service the
[1:26:31] requirement for that worship service the
[1:26:33] atonement was blood
[1:26:36] and that's why it wasn't accepted and
[1:26:38] you know what happens today brothers and
[1:26:40] sisters we can be guilty if we're not
[1:26:42] careful of trying to bring a different
[1:26:44] type of sacrifice than what's required
[1:26:46] for our day today and you know what's
[1:26:48] required for our day today is the
[1:26:50] acceptance of the full word the entirety
[1:26:53] of the word for us today being able to
[1:26:56] say I might not understand the message
[1:26:58] of the hour but you know what be it unto
[1:27:00] me according to Thy word remember the
[1:27:02] Revelation if we get it we can check it
[1:27:04] we don't have to just say just because
[1:27:06] Barry Johnson said this I have to accept
[1:27:09] it just because a great Minister said
[1:27:11] that just because even William Branham
[1:27:13] said that
[1:27:14] every one of the brothers who do believe
[1:27:17] the word who have that Revelation they
[1:27:19] will say take it to the word give it the
[1:27:21] word test for yourself don't take my
[1:27:24] words take the word
[1:27:27] remember brother Bradham we've been
[1:27:28] saying it over and over and over it's
[1:27:29] got to be revealed revealed by the
[1:27:32] spirit when it's revealed by the spirit
[1:27:34] then we can confirm it by the word and
[1:27:37] when we confirm it by the word guess
[1:27:39] what we can go forwards with confidence
[1:27:41] and just sit back and trust that if it's
[1:27:43] been revealed by the spirit it's been
[1:27:45] confirmed by the word that it's going to
[1:27:47] bring forth fruits and whatever those
[1:27:49] fruits are will prove what it is
[1:27:52] but if the first two requirements have
[1:27:54] been met you can just about guarantee
[1:27:55] that it's going to bring forth fruit
[1:27:57] unto righteousness
[1:27:58] it's going to match the word
[1:28:01] Upon This Rock revelation will I build
[1:28:04] my church the church is built on
[1:28:06] Revelation not on on on on on on a man
[1:28:09] not on a a place you know going back to
[1:28:12] the Cod book The reason I was mentioning
[1:28:14] that sorry I just got excited and went
[1:28:16] off on a tangent the reason I said that
[1:28:18] if you look at the Cod book see how many
[1:28:20] times people who were right there with
[1:28:22] the prophet of God who understood praise
[1:28:24] the Lord You're the prophet of God
[1:28:26] you're the Vindicated messenger of the
[1:28:27] day but should we go out west
[1:28:29] should we come to Arizona
[1:28:31] should we move
[1:28:33] and what did he say to them every single
[1:28:34] time no
[1:28:36] I mean by all means if you want to move
[1:28:38] and change your location by all means
[1:28:40] but don't move to follow me
[1:28:42] the Rapture is not going to happen out
[1:28:43] there don't come because of me
[1:28:45] I don't know how many times it's in that
[1:28:47] book but just to look at the carnality
[1:28:49] of men not relying upon their own
[1:28:52] Revelation not allowing God to reveal
[1:28:54] the word to them themselves relying on
[1:28:56] another person's revelation
[1:28:59] we have to be careful brothers and
[1:29:01] sisters
[1:29:02] amen but as much as we have to be
[1:29:04] careful when we can get that Revelation
[1:29:06] into our heart this is what I want to
[1:29:08] try and do I don't want to try and
[1:29:10] discourage us and make us feel bad
[1:29:11] because we could be going off on the
[1:29:13] wrong direction or we just don't have
[1:29:14] the right Revelation I don't want to do
[1:29:16] that what I want to do is speak to the
[1:29:17] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:29:19] there's people that maybe ha are new to
[1:29:21] the message of the hour who could be
[1:29:22] turning in you know what this word will
[1:29:25] change your body one day if you just sit
[1:29:27] and let it wash you just get Washed by
[1:29:30] the washing of the water of the word and
[1:29:32] see what happens you know what there's a
[1:29:34] place that we can come to brothers and
[1:29:36] sisters where the devil won't even know
[1:29:38] what to do with us we've read that quote
[1:29:40] many times and I'm not going to read
[1:29:42] that one but there's coming a place in
[1:29:44] our lives by Revelation about who we are
[1:29:47] and about how we can just submit
[1:29:49] ourselves unto the word Just Surrender
[1:29:50] ourselves unto the word and say I might
[1:29:52] not understand it completely but there's
[1:29:54] just something about it I just want to
[1:29:56] let it wash me I just want to let it
[1:29:58] feed me I just want to let it nourish me
[1:29:59] and you know what will happen it will
[1:30:01] put us in a position where Satan just
[1:30:03] won't even know what to do with us
[1:30:04] because we'll have so much Revelation
[1:30:06] about the word not just about the word
[1:30:08] but about who we are with that word in
[1:30:10] US
[1:30:12] but there's another quote that I I heard
[1:30:14] and I found and I know I'd heard it
[1:30:16] before but it was just so good to hear
[1:30:18] it again you know what there's coming a
[1:30:20] place where the devil you just won't
[1:30:21] even be able to find you
[1:30:23] amen not that he won't know what to do
[1:30:26] with you but he won't even be able to
[1:30:27] find you
[1:30:29] can you imagine that
[1:30:31] and so here we go right back into
[1:30:34] adoption again Ephesians paralleling
[1:30:37] Joshua
[1:30:38] oh my brothers and sisters we're talking
[1:30:41] about a hidden life today brother
[1:30:42] Branham says remember I said God does
[1:30:44] not condemn a sinner for sinning he's a
[1:30:46] sinner to begin with he condemns a
[1:30:49] Christian for sinning and then because
[1:30:52] he has condemned him
[1:30:54] Christ took our condemnation
[1:30:57] Christ took our condemnation so there's
[1:31:00] no condemnation to them which are in
[1:31:03] Christ Jesus that walk not after the
[1:31:05] flesh but after the spirit
[1:31:07] I have been just churning on this
[1:31:09] scripture for for about a year now or
[1:31:12] more I'm sure longer than that but to
[1:31:15] think about that brothers and sisters
[1:31:16] what does it mean to be in the spirit
[1:31:18] and we've talked about it being in the
[1:31:21] spirit overcoming in the spirit the only
[1:31:22] way we're going to overcome by the
[1:31:24] spirit is to have Revelation in our
[1:31:25] lives to have the Revelation that we are
[1:31:28] more than conquerors that we don't need
[1:31:30] to walk around beaten down and
[1:31:32] downtrodden we're Sons and Daughters of
[1:31:34] God of of the most high God God Almighty
[1:31:37] Elohim the same one that talked to all
[1:31:39] of the Saints all of the the sages all
[1:31:42] of the prophets throughout all of the
[1:31:43] Bible that same one
[1:31:46] he condemns a Christian for sinning and
[1:31:49] then because he has condemned him
[1:31:52] he sent a sacrifice he sent Christ
[1:31:56] took our condemnation now I I say that
[1:32:00] that he sent Christ
[1:32:02] but Christ was him
[1:32:04] Christ had to be him
[1:32:06] or the sacrifice wasn't valid
[1:32:09] right
[1:32:13] so there's no condemnation to them which
[1:32:15] are in Christ Christ Jesus that walk not
[1:32:18] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:32:21] that just have such a longing in their
[1:32:24] heart
[1:32:24] to be together with brothers and sisters
[1:32:26] of like Precious faith
[1:32:28] they sigh and they cry for the
[1:32:30] Abominations in the land we can see all
[1:32:33] of the trouble and all of the problems
[1:32:36] and all of the heartaches and all of the
[1:32:38] broken marriages and all of the
[1:32:40] different things that go on in this
[1:32:42] world and all the children who will
[1:32:43] never ever know what it means to have a
[1:32:46] dad in the home they never had a dad to
[1:32:49] start with they'll never have that
[1:32:50] Revelation they'll never understand what
[1:32:53] it means to have a mom to raise them and
[1:32:55] nourish them and encourage them
[1:32:58] what they're getting now is Two Dads or
[1:33:01] two moms
[1:33:03] I saw just recently even three dads
[1:33:07] sigh and cry for the abomination in the
[1:33:10] land
[1:33:12] this is a
[1:33:13] this is an amazing time to look around
[1:33:15] as a Christian believer
[1:33:17] we have we have been given such an honor
[1:33:19] to be here to understand the word to
[1:33:21] represent the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:26] there's no condemnation to them which
[1:33:28] are in Christ Jesus that walk not after
[1:33:30] the flesh but after the spirit just live
[1:33:33] in the spirit always singing in the
[1:33:35] spirit
[1:33:36] praying in the spirit thinking in the
[1:33:39] spirit taking every every single thought
[1:33:41] that comes into our minds into captivity
[1:33:44] and subduing them taking them to the mat
[1:33:47] and saying are you of God because if
[1:33:50] you're not of God then you're not coming
[1:33:51] out of my mouth because the words that
[1:33:53] come out of my mouth by the Revelation
[1:33:55] that I've got about who is inside of me
[1:33:57] those are creative words those words
[1:34:00] have power and if I just let fly with my
[1:34:02] mouth all the time if I think with my
[1:34:04] mouth and just few spew spew who knows
[1:34:08] how much damage I'm doing to those
[1:34:10] people around me
[1:34:12] no we need to take every single thought
[1:34:14] into captivity we know that a word is a
[1:34:17] thought expressed
[1:34:21] but if we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:34:23] and we don't walk after this flesh we
[1:34:27] don't desire to do the things that the
[1:34:28] world desires to do go the places the
[1:34:31] world desires to go to see the things
[1:34:33] the world desires to see if we live in
[1:34:36] the spirit then you know what there's no
[1:34:37] condemnation to us
[1:34:39] then all of this this sin that that that
[1:34:42] so easily besets us in our lives it has
[1:34:45] no power over us no power over us
[1:34:48] brother Branham says if you do anything
[1:34:50] wrong it isn't willfully if you're
[1:34:53] walking in the spirit and not after the
[1:34:55] flesh if you do anything wrong it isn't
[1:34:58] willfully you don't sin willfully a man
[1:35:00] that sins willfully goes out and
[1:35:02] willfully sins never come into the body
[1:35:05] yet that's why you see people come in
[1:35:07] and round the message of the Hour come
[1:35:09] in around church and and sometimes most
[1:35:12] times they seem like the most religious
[1:35:14] people the most righteous ones but
[1:35:17] somehow some way somewhere along the way
[1:35:19] they just vaporize they just go out into
[1:35:22] the world and sadly they usually don't
[1:35:25] go alone
[1:35:27] we know that's the devil
[1:35:29] but brother Bradham says it right here
[1:35:30] the reason for that is they just never
[1:35:32] made it all the way in they just never
[1:35:33] had that full Revelation they just never
[1:35:36] had a true conversion
[1:35:39] but a man that's once in there
[1:35:42] I love how brother Branham says this and
[1:35:44] man that's once in there he's dead
[1:35:47] and his life is hid in God through
[1:35:49] Christ
[1:35:50] remember we're talking about being hid
[1:35:52] in Christ today a man that's Once Dead
[1:35:56] once there he's dead and his life is
[1:35:58] hidden God through Christ sealed by the
[1:36:01] Holy Ghost
[1:36:02] and the devil can't even find him
[1:36:05] he's so far back in there
[1:36:07] he would have to come out of there
[1:36:09] before the devil can ever get in for
[1:36:11] you're dead
[1:36:13] now in this quote here I've talked about
[1:36:15] this many times I'll I'll
[1:36:18] um I have it here I'll read it remember
[1:36:23] brothers and sisters in the Bible in job
[1:36:26] the story of of God and Satan and how
[1:36:29] how
[1:36:31] God and Satan had a conversation one day
[1:36:33] and he said what's up Satan
[1:36:36] what you been up to
[1:36:37] where you been
[1:36:38] he said I've been walking to and fro up
[1:36:41] and down in the Earth
[1:36:42] seeking whom I may devour
[1:36:45] and he said have you have you considered
[1:36:46] my servant job
[1:36:48] and he said yeah you know probably have
[1:36:51] but you've got a hedge around him he's
[1:36:53] all protected
[1:36:55] so I can't do anything to him and I have
[1:36:56] never been able to
[1:36:58] you know brother Brown I'm in this
[1:37:00] message he brings it out
[1:37:02] um I can't even remember what one it was
[1:37:03] I've been through so many recently but
[1:37:05] you know what he says about it is that
[1:37:07] there was actually a hedge around job
[1:37:12] job was so far in there
[1:37:15] so far Sanctified unto God by the
[1:37:18] Revelation that he had
[1:37:20] Satan couldn't even get to him
[1:37:23] and you know brothers and sisters that's
[1:37:25] no different for us
[1:37:27] many times I think it can be worded in
[1:37:29] such a way that it seems so Elusive and
[1:37:31] so out there you know all it takes is a
[1:37:34] greater sacrifice in our lives and I say
[1:37:35] that Loosely all it takes is a greater
[1:37:37] sacrifice in my life and I don't feel
[1:37:39] like I've attained it and I don't know
[1:37:41] if I ever will but I sure want to try
[1:37:44] I sure want to try to get to that place
[1:37:46] where I know that when I speak
[1:37:50] it's God speaking many times it doesn't
[1:37:53] feel like it
[1:37:54] and you know I'm so thankful that the
[1:37:56] prophet said our feelings have nothing
[1:37:57] to do with it we live in this
[1:37:59] contamination in this flesh we can't
[1:38:02] live in this world and not get filthy I
[1:38:04] remember I can't remember who it was a
[1:38:07] brother said it years ago you know back
[1:38:09] in the in the in the New Testament days
[1:38:11] when they would walk there's a reason
[1:38:12] why they had foot washing
[1:38:14] and and that was because they couldn't
[1:38:17] walk down the street in their sandals
[1:38:18] and and not get dirty their feet would
[1:38:21] sweat and the dust that would kick up
[1:38:23] would get on their feet and stick to the
[1:38:25] sweat and maybe as they're walking they
[1:38:27] would step in a wet spot or a really
[1:38:29] super squishy spot and I'm sure you know
[1:38:31] what I'm talking about there and and
[1:38:33] maybe some of that would dry out and the
[1:38:35] dust particles would get into their
[1:38:36] sweat and stick to their feet their feet
[1:38:38] were filthy you know what it's a type of
[1:38:40] walking in this world we can't walk in
[1:38:42] this world and not become filthy
[1:38:45] this flesh has to perish but if we can
[1:38:48] just understand that and accept that
[1:38:50] then we can understand the devil and his
[1:38:52] tactics and we can understand our
[1:38:54] enemies tactics we can have success over
[1:38:57] him and then we can actually just
[1:38:59] understand that you know what this flesh
[1:39:01] is gonna fail this flesh does fail every
[1:39:03] single day that's why Paul died out to
[1:39:04] himself every single day that's why we
[1:39:06] have to do it I heard a brother say it
[1:39:08] recently that sacrifice has to be fresh
[1:39:11] every day on the altar in order for us
[1:39:14] to be fathers in our homes in order for
[1:39:16] us to be Pastors in our churches in
[1:39:18] order for us to be strong Christians we
[1:39:21] have got to have a fresh sacrifice in
[1:39:23] our life if it's one and done if we say
[1:39:25] man
[1:39:27] I was at a Revival before you were even
[1:39:29] born son
[1:39:31] and I got saved there and it's all good
[1:39:33] I fixed it up with God there and that's
[1:39:34] it there's nothing you can teach me I'm
[1:39:36] not interested in trying to teach
[1:39:37] anybody anything I just want to speak
[1:39:39] the word I just want to see that
[1:39:41] sacrifice fresh in my life every time
[1:39:44] that I hear the word every time that I
[1:39:46] speak the word that's that leading
[1:39:48] bloody lamb of Jesus Christ that's the
[1:39:51] same lamb that that Abel slew in the
[1:39:54] garden and that's the same thing that
[1:39:55] happened to Abel he became a sacrifice
[1:39:57] too
[1:39:59] Christ became our ultimate sacrifice
[1:40:01] brothers and sisters so that we could
[1:40:03] live today
[1:40:04] but you know there's a time there's a
[1:40:06] place where God will put a hedge around
[1:40:07] us and many times I think that God has a
[1:40:10] hedge around us and we can't even tell
[1:40:14] many times we can get caught up in the
[1:40:16] moment and say look at this problem in
[1:40:18] my life and it must be the devil coming
[1:40:19] at me you know what God's got a hedge
[1:40:22] around you because if the devil had free
[1:40:24] reign in your life you would be crushed
[1:40:27] we would be destroyed he doesn't want to
[1:40:30] see us live and have any breath in our
[1:40:32] lungs he doesn't want to see us have any
[1:40:33] Revelation in our hearts Satan wants to
[1:40:36] kill and destroy if we've got problems
[1:40:39] in our lives and we have breath in our
[1:40:41] lungs it's because God has a hedge
[1:40:44] around us and we're just like job we
[1:40:46] need to get on our our heap of ashes and
[1:40:49] rejoice what did job do well well yet
[1:40:52] the people came and told him the
[1:40:54] servants came and told him well they yet
[1:40:56] spoke and other people came and told him
[1:40:58] and while they yet spoke more people
[1:41:00] came and told him and while they yet
[1:41:02] spoke there was another Calamity coming
[1:41:04] towards him they spoke to him and told
[1:41:06] him your life is over everything that
[1:41:08] you have is gone what did he do he
[1:41:12] didn't lament he got on his Ash Heap and
[1:41:15] he rejoiced he started to praise the
[1:41:17] Lord that's what we need to do brothers
[1:41:19] and sisters in the midst of our trials
[1:41:20] is just start to Rejoice start to praise
[1:41:23] the Lord maybe we have children who are
[1:41:25] Wayward start to praise the Lord because
[1:41:27] as they're his children and he will do
[1:41:29] what he wants with them he will save
[1:41:31] them he will bring them up the word says
[1:41:34] to train him up in the way they shall go
[1:41:35] and it won't they won't depart from it
[1:41:37] you know what that seed Gene of God is
[1:41:39] in them just keep praying just keep
[1:41:41] watering it just keep rejoicing and
[1:41:43] Watching God do the work because it's
[1:41:45] his work we can't save our children many
[1:41:47] times if we try and do it we just get in
[1:41:49] the way and make a mess but when he
[1:41:51] comes around if he could just speak the
[1:41:53] word everything would be fine
[1:41:56] let's turn over in our Bibles to Exodus
[1:41:58] chapter 34. Hallelujah
[1:42:01] Exodus chapter 34 we're talking about
[1:42:04] having a hidden life in Christ Jesus
[1:42:06] today understanding that there's a hedge
[1:42:09] around us many times we can see problems
[1:42:11] come into our life you know what it is
[1:42:13] it's because God might just allow the
[1:42:16] the gardeners to go down there and just
[1:42:18] cut a little tiny hole in that hedge
[1:42:19] because there's just that one little
[1:42:21] part in our life that's just distracting
[1:42:23] us a little bit from this word just
[1:42:25] distracting us from that little that
[1:42:27] little extra bit that we could be giving
[1:42:28] to the Lord It's consuming us it's
[1:42:31] becoming an idol in our life and God
[1:42:33] will say to the gardeners just go down
[1:42:34] there and trim a little hole over there
[1:42:35] in that little part right there and just
[1:42:37] let Satan have a little bit of access to
[1:42:39] that that that part of that person and
[1:42:42] we start to get a trial in our lives you
[1:42:44] know what we need to Rejoice because
[1:42:45] God's allowing that so that we can
[1:42:47] actually grow not so that we can be
[1:42:49] consumed remember if Satan had free
[1:42:52] access he would destroy us just like
[1:42:54] that
[1:42:56] just like that he would take our lives
[1:42:59] in Exodus chapter 34
[1:43:03] verse 17.
[1:43:05] I trust the Lord will Stitch this
[1:43:06] together because I I myself I struggled
[1:43:10] I wondered
[1:43:12] verse 17 he says and the Lord said unto
[1:43:14] Moses
[1:43:16] I will do this thing also that thou Hast
[1:43:18] spoken for thou Hast found Grace in my
[1:43:22] sight and I Know Thee by name
[1:43:26] and he said I beseech thee show me thy
[1:43:28] Glory
[1:43:30] and he said I will make all my goodness
[1:43:32] pass before thee and I will proclaim the
[1:43:35] name of the Lord before thee and I will
[1:43:37] be gracious to whom I will be gracious
[1:43:39] and will show Mercy on whom I will show
[1:43:41] Mercy remember election brothers and
[1:43:44] sisters
[1:43:46] and he said thou cast not see my face
[1:43:48] for there shall no man see me and live
[1:43:52] and the Lord said behold
[1:43:54] oh my there is a place by me
[1:43:58] and thou shalt stand upon a rock
[1:44:01] and it shall come to pass while I my
[1:44:04] Glory passeth by
[1:44:06] that I will put thee in a cleft of The
[1:44:09] Rock
[1:44:10] and we'll cover thee with my hand while
[1:44:12] I pass by
[1:44:13] and I will take away mine hand and thou
[1:44:16] shalt see my back Parts but my face
[1:44:20] shall not be seen
[1:44:24] you know the word says
[1:44:27] that we knew in part we prophesied in
[1:44:30] part
[1:44:31] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:44:37] we look through a glass Darkly
[1:44:40] but then we shall see him
[1:44:43] face to face brothers and sisters
[1:44:47] this scripture here
[1:44:49] and the Lord said behold there is a
[1:44:52] place by me
[1:44:55] we were talking about some teachings
[1:44:58] from a camp
[1:45:00] Lisa was telling me about the teaching
[1:45:02] from Brother Eugene Braun
[1:45:06] trains horses for those people who don't
[1:45:08] know
[1:45:09] and you know one of the things that
[1:45:10] stuck with Lisa she said
[1:45:13] the safest place for a horse
[1:45:16] when they've been broken and trained
[1:45:18] the idea is to get it into a horse we
[1:45:21] know how powerful they are but that
[1:45:23] horse has to come to the place where it
[1:45:25] realizes the safest place
[1:45:27] is right beside the trainer
[1:45:30] not running around anywhere else
[1:45:32] and to think about it brothers and
[1:45:34] sisters that's our place right beside
[1:45:38] our trainer right beside our God and the
[1:45:41] Lord said behold there is a place by me
[1:45:45] that thou shalt stand upon a rock and we
[1:45:48] know in this story here he got to stand
[1:45:50] in a rock and the Lord's Glory passed by
[1:45:53] him you know I just can't help but tie
[1:45:56] this together with the scripture we read
[1:45:57] earlier
[1:45:59] where Jesus said Thou Art Peter
[1:46:02] Simon barjona
[1:46:04] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this
[1:46:06] unto thee but my Father which is in
[1:46:08] heaven hath revealed this unto thee and
[1:46:10] Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:46:12] Revelation Brothers and Sisters Jesus
[1:46:16] Christ is saying yesterday today and
[1:46:17] forever you know there's a place on a
[1:46:20] rock that's right beside him the safest
[1:46:23] place for us to ever be in our lives is
[1:46:25] right beside him and you know as we're
[1:46:28] right beside him we want to take that
[1:46:30] and apply it to our lives today when we
[1:46:32] come to that place of real Revelation in
[1:46:34] our lives about us being saved not just
[1:46:36] being saved but filled with the Holy
[1:46:37] Ghost not just filled with the Holy
[1:46:39] Ghost but actually the living Tabernacle
[1:46:42] of the Lord Jesus Christ his flesh on
[1:46:44] Earth again when we come to that place
[1:46:46] you know what Satan can't even touch you
[1:46:48] you're so far into the Lord You're so
[1:46:50] far into the word he's got such a hedge
[1:46:53] around you he can't even touch you he
[1:46:54] can't even find you
[1:46:57] this just spoke to me so much and I will
[1:47:00] take away my hand and thou shalt see my
[1:47:02] back parts once upon a time we'll look
[1:47:04] through a glass Darkly but then when
[1:47:07] that which is perfect is come we shall
[1:47:08] look at him face to face we don't have
[1:47:11] to look at his back parts we can look at
[1:47:13] him in the face and if you want to see
[1:47:15] where he's at today brothers and sisters
[1:47:17] go look in the mirror
[1:47:18] don't look in the mirror of the word I'm
[1:47:20] not saying don't look in the mirror of
[1:47:21] the word what I'm saying is look into
[1:47:23] your eyes look into your brother or your
[1:47:25] sister's eyes that's the Lord Jesus
[1:47:27] Christ today
[1:47:30] it's not your brother or your sister if
[1:47:31] they're saved if they're Justified and
[1:47:33] they're Sanctified and they're filled
[1:47:35] with the Holy Ghost that's the Lord
[1:47:36] Jesus Christ right there
[1:47:38] and to get caught up in thinking about
[1:47:40] something some ISM or something they did
[1:47:43] or didn't do think about it that's the
[1:47:45] Lord Jesus Christ you're speaking about
[1:47:48] goodness we don't want to do that
[1:47:51] an adoption brother Branham says but the
[1:47:54] purpose of this the purpose of all of
[1:47:56] this brothers and sisters is seeing your
[1:47:58] position in Christ seeing that it's not
[1:48:00] something that you just stumbled into
[1:48:02] it's not something we just happened
[1:48:04] across in our lives we didn't just
[1:48:06] stumble into it or something that might
[1:48:07] have have merited something you merited
[1:48:10] something somewhere along the way but
[1:48:12] it's what God did for you himself
[1:48:13] according to predestination from before
[1:48:16] the foundation of the world he chose us
[1:48:19] to be able to have ears to hear what the
[1:48:21] spirit saith unto the church
[1:48:23] was it Isaiah
[1:48:25] was it the prophet Isaiah that was in a
[1:48:28] vision and and God said to Isaiah can
[1:48:31] these bones these Dry Bones can they
[1:48:32] hear
[1:48:34] do they have ears to hear
[1:48:36] you know brothers and sisters it was a
[1:48:37] prophecy of a day and and for the Jews
[1:48:41] but you know what's also for the
[1:48:42] Gentiles to have ears to hear what the
[1:48:45] spirit saith unto the church
[1:48:49] it's not something that we might have
[1:48:50] merited somewhere but it's what God did
[1:48:52] for you himself
[1:48:55] not that you were so good that you went
[1:48:58] to a church one night and some poor
[1:49:00] brother LED you up to the altar it
[1:49:02] wasn't that
[1:49:04] and you know many times we can all stop
[1:49:06] and and say well you know I did have
[1:49:08] someone that actually talked to me about
[1:49:10] a prophet I did have someone that said
[1:49:11] God sent a prophet and it captured my
[1:49:13] attention and you know what it was
[1:49:15] brothers and sisters it was God using
[1:49:17] that person it wasn't that person
[1:49:20] it was totally God using that person
[1:49:21] just like God used that bush to not be
[1:49:24] consumed so that Abraham could look upon
[1:49:27] it or Moses sorry could look upon it and
[1:49:29] say wow why isn't that bush burning it
[1:49:33] caught his attention and when God saw
[1:49:36] that he caught his attention then he
[1:49:37] spoke to him brothers and sisters if he
[1:49:40] can see that he's got our attention how
[1:49:42] will he know that he's got our attention
[1:49:44] how will he know that he's got Barry
[1:49:46] Johnson's attention
[1:49:48] when he's got that sacrifice fresh every
[1:49:50] day
[1:49:51] not just too busy
[1:49:53] not just too too too too into my life
[1:49:56] and doing things I can honestly say I
[1:49:58] have made so many Idols in my life since
[1:50:01] I've been messaged believer since I've
[1:50:02] been saved I have created so many Idols
[1:50:05] in my life I say Lord forgive me I have
[1:50:08] had a prayer meeting and said Lord
[1:50:09] forgive me because there have been
[1:50:11] things in my life that have been more
[1:50:13] important than me getting on my knees
[1:50:14] and having that daily sacrifice
[1:50:17] Lord help us we don't want to do that
[1:50:19] when we do that we teach our children
[1:50:21] that it's okay to say that we believe
[1:50:24] the word but it's also okay to have an
[1:50:26] idol we don't want to have an idol
[1:50:28] we don't want to put anything before the
[1:50:30] word of God in our lives in our homes
[1:50:33] and you know
[1:50:35] God just wants us to actually tear it
[1:50:37] down to get that Revelation and tear it
[1:50:40] down and if we can do that brothers and
[1:50:42] sisters it's not too late if you've got
[1:50:44] an idol in your life I don't know why
[1:50:45] I'm speaking about it but I'm telling
[1:50:47] you if you got an idol in your life it's
[1:50:49] not too late if you can see that you've
[1:50:51] got it tear it down Smash It Up kick it
[1:50:54] out and you know what it might be
[1:50:56] frightening you might say well that's my
[1:50:58] way of making a living how could you
[1:51:00] dare say that about me I can say it
[1:51:02] because God
[1:51:04] who is rich in Mercy our brother prayed
[1:51:07] it today
[1:51:08] ask him
[1:51:09] you know what we're doing we're creating
[1:51:11] an idol brothers and sisters
[1:51:12] we're robbing him of our tithes and our
[1:51:15] offerings
[1:51:16] and you know what the word says
[1:51:18] where wherefore have we robbed you of
[1:51:20] our tithes and our offerings you know
[1:51:22] what he says
[1:51:23] another part you've robbed me of time
[1:51:27] you've taken your time and you've given
[1:51:29] it to other things you've given it to
[1:51:31] other idols brothers and sisters we
[1:51:34] don't want to do that we do not want to
[1:51:36] have an idol in our lives and Satan is
[1:51:38] so slick he'll get us running to and fro
[1:51:40] and up and down in the earth I'm moving
[1:51:42] and shaking I've got a business I've got
[1:51:44] this I've got a job I've got a career
[1:51:47] I've got school I've got all these
[1:51:49] different things I'm so busy you don't
[1:51:51] know what it means to be me no I don't
[1:51:53] but I do know this if any of that stuff
[1:51:55] is coming before God in your life then
[1:51:57] you're an idolater and you need to
[1:51:58] repent and if you do he will restore
[1:52:01] he'll restore every single thing that
[1:52:04] you thought you had and greater
[1:52:06] I'd rather pray to see if he won't pour
[1:52:09] out a blessing on you that you can't
[1:52:11] even contain see if he won't open the
[1:52:13] windows of heaven and just pour it out
[1:52:14] upon you you know many times we talk
[1:52:17] about tithing and we talk about money
[1:52:18] it's not about money it's about that
[1:52:20] sacrifice it's about understanding that
[1:52:22] God has given you ten percent more than
[1:52:25] you deserve
[1:52:28] he's overpaid every one of us and are we
[1:52:31] willing to say that hey I'm just going
[1:52:33] to make sure that he gets what's his
[1:52:34] because he's given me 90 percent if I
[1:52:37] give him 10. man I don't even know why
[1:52:39] I'm not even I don't want to talk about
[1:52:41] this but it's interesting because it's
[1:52:43] not about money it's not even about
[1:52:45] money
[1:52:47] the true true offering is where it's at
[1:52:50] the true tithe is in the offering
[1:52:52] offering is is above and beyond it's the
[1:52:55] sacrifice that we give to him
[1:52:57] and it can be in many different ways
[1:52:59] helping Brothers helping sisters helping
[1:53:02] the church helping giving extra money
[1:53:04] whatever it is is doing more than what
[1:53:07] you normally would going further giving
[1:53:09] of that which you actually that other
[1:53:11] ninety percent of your life whatever it
[1:53:13] is time resources skills money
[1:53:18] whether Bradham says that it was God
[1:53:20] before the foundation of the world
[1:53:21] predestinated you to eternal life
[1:53:25] that's what it was
[1:53:27] when you get there that day
[1:53:29] on the other side Before the Throne
[1:53:33] not before the throne in the throne
[1:53:35] when you get there that day no wonder
[1:53:37] the four the 40 24 Elders laid off their
[1:53:41] crowns everybody laid down their Crown
[1:53:43] everybody fell on their faces they
[1:53:45] didn't have one thing they could say no
[1:53:48] preacher no Elder no nothing
[1:53:51] all praise to the lamb God will gather
[1:53:55] in him all things at that day
[1:53:58] to think that Revelation in our lives is
[1:54:00] nothing that we've ever done nothing we
[1:54:02] could ever do
[1:54:04] nothing we have ever done
[1:54:06] it's just what he's done
[1:54:09] and recognizing
[1:54:10] that I the the Lord said behold there is
[1:54:14] a place by me that thou shalt stand upon
[1:54:16] a rock a rock of Revelation brothers and
[1:54:19] sisters about who we are not just that
[1:54:22] Peter was Revelation was was given to
[1:54:25] Peter and that he understood who Jesus
[1:54:26] Christ was that's fine and good it's
[1:54:29] very important to understand that that
[1:54:31] we're talking about all Revelation and
[1:54:33] not just the Book of Revelation but what
[1:54:35] that's doing is giving message of the
[1:54:37] hour but Lord Jesus that rock of
[1:54:39] Revelation about who we are and that
[1:54:41] there is a place of perfect rest and
[1:54:44] it's right beside you Lord Jesus
[1:54:47] father I pray that we could just take
[1:54:49] these words today and just meditate upon
[1:54:52] them in our hearts that we could just
[1:54:54] look for that place closer to you that
[1:54:57] we could just draw our our lives so
[1:55:00] close to you Lord Jesus that Satan
[1:55:01] wouldn't even be able to find us Lord
[1:55:05] we thank you for your word we thank you
[1:55:07] for your message we thank you for your
[1:55:09] encouragement to us today Lord I pray
[1:55:11] that more than anything your children
[1:55:13] would be encouraged to know that if they
[1:55:15] have that Revelation in their lives that
[1:55:18] Satan can no longer touch them he can't
[1:55:20] touch them until you say
[1:55:23] go ahead
[1:55:24] and if you do say it that it's going to
[1:55:26] be for our Perfection it's going to be
[1:55:28] to help us it's going to be so that we
[1:55:30] will grow
[1:55:31] father you're such a a wonderful father
[1:55:33] we just love you and we thank you and we
[1:55:35] bless your name we pray that you would
[1:55:37] just be glorified in our lives be
[1:55:39] glorified in our homes Lord help us to
[1:55:41] tear down the Groves help us to tear
[1:55:44] down the high places to kick out the
[1:55:46] idols and smash them before you Lord
[1:55:48] that you would see that we are serious
[1:55:51] about serving you in our lives that
[1:55:53] there is nothing in our lives that's
[1:55:55] more important than you are
[1:55:58] and then we know you will pour out a
[1:56:00] blessing on our lives that we just can't
[1:56:02] even contain and it's not necessarily a
[1:56:04] financial blessing it's a revelation
[1:56:06] blessing where we can stand before Satan
[1:56:09] and go toe-to-toe with him just like
[1:56:11] David did with Goliath that Revelation
[1:56:13] that as long as this circumcised Phyllis
[1:56:16] uncircumcised Philistine is standing in
[1:56:18] the promised land he is as defeated as
[1:56:21] anyone is because when we're in our own
[1:56:23] Promised Land we have full Authority and
[1:56:26] power Lord we just love you and we thank
[1:56:28] you and we pray that you would just
[1:56:29] bless your children today keep your hand
[1:56:31] upon each one we ask in Jesus Christ's
[1:56:34] name amen
[1:56:37] Hallelujah
