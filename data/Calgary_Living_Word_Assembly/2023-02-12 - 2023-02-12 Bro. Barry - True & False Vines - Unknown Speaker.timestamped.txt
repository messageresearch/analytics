[1:06:10] to listen how the redeemed worship those

[1:06:17] hand are you happy this morning

[1:06:24] to bring before the church the
[1:06:25] Carpenters have a family friend who is
[1:06:28] in need of a heart heart surgery he had
[1:06:33] a problem I guess there was a surgery
[1:06:35] that went wrong and uh and he needs he
[1:06:38] needs a touch from the Lord so we just
[1:06:40] want to Remember The Carpenter's family
[1:06:41] friend this morning if you have a need

[1:06:53] thank you Lord Jesus that you reach down
[1:06:55] your hand father we can say it for
[1:06:58] everyone else but it needs to be for me
[1:07:00] Father we thank you for your goodness to
[1:07:02] us Lord that you would consider us Lord
[1:07:05] Jesus worthy to be able to hear your
[1:07:08] word father we just want to remember
[1:07:10] each and every hand that was lifted unto
[1:07:12] you this morning Father my hand is well
[1:07:15] Lord we all have needs in our lives and
[1:07:17] father we pray that you would just
[1:07:19] sovereignly meet the needs once again
[1:07:21] father we pray that you would just meet
[1:07:23] the friend of the Carpenters Lord I
[1:07:26] believe his name is Art Lord who who is
[1:07:28] in need of a heart surgery Lord Jesus
[1:07:31] and we don't know the circumstances we
[1:07:33] don't know what exactly needs to happen

[1:07:40] throne this morning Lord we just ask
[1:07:42] that you would be glorified Lord in all

[1:07:46] in this service this morning Lord as our
[1:07:48] brothers already prayed we thank you for
[1:07:49] being with those who are traveling Lord
[1:07:51] that you would bring them back home
[1:07:53] safely at the appointed time father Lord

[1:08:03] Christ we pray amen amen God bless you
[1:08:06] this morning thank you musicians
[1:08:09] you have your Bibles this morning I'd
[1:08:11] like to read from John chapter 15.
[1:08:17] and then I'd like to turn over to John
[1:08:19] chapter 18.
[1:08:22] John chapter 15.
[1:08:26] it's interesting we can sing that song
[1:08:28] that we just sang by Revelation
[1:08:30] recognizing that we were lost and undone
[1:08:32] without God or his son
[1:08:35] but we know those aren't two separate
[1:08:36] persons and we know there isn't a third
[1:08:38] person involved it's one God
[1:08:42] one God
[1:08:46] this morning we want to talk about the
[1:08:47] True Vine once again John chapter 15
[1:08:50] verse 1 I am the True Vine and my father
[1:08:54] is the husbandman every branch in me
[1:08:57] that beareth not fruit he taketh away
[1:08:59] and every branch that beareth fruit he
[1:09:03] purgeth it that it may bring forth more
[1:09:07] fruit
[1:09:08] now ye are clean through the word which
[1:09:12] I have spoken unto you
[1:09:14] turn over to John chapter 18.
[1:09:18] actually 17 sorry
[1:09:21] my Bible is set up oh my John chapter 17
[1:09:25] verse 15.
[1:09:31] I pray not that thou shouldest take them
[1:09:34] out of the world
[1:09:36] but that thou shouldest keep them from
[1:09:38] evil
[1:09:40] they are not of the world even as I am
[1:09:43] not of the world
[1:09:45] can you imagine that
[1:09:47] Jesus saying that Jesus declaring that
[1:09:49] they're not of the world just like I'm
[1:09:51] not of the world
[1:09:53] the same way
[1:09:55] wow
[1:09:56] verse 17 sanctify them
[1:10:00] through thy truth
[1:10:02] Thy word is truth
[1:10:04] let's just bow one more time
[1:10:06] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:10:08] for your word we thank you for your
[1:10:10] truth Lord we thank you that you are the
[1:10:12] True Vine and Lord Jesus every branch
[1:10:15] that bringeth forth fruit you purchase
[1:10:18] it and Lord this morning we just pray
[1:10:20] that you would Purge the branch once
[1:10:22] again father Lord that you would speak
[1:10:24] to us and through US father that you
[1:10:26] would help me to get out of the way our
[1:10:28] brothers already prayed it and I just
[1:10:29] want to surrender unto you as well
[1:10:31] father we just ask that you would have
[1:10:33] the preeminence that you desire Lord
[1:10:35] that the speaker and the hearer come
[1:10:37] together to be in one mind and one
[1:10:39] Accord father let there not be any
[1:10:41] resistance let there not be any any
[1:10:43] filters Lord Jesus just have the
[1:10:46] preeminence that you desire Lord let
[1:10:48] your will be done today we pray father
[1:10:50] we ask all these things now in Jesus
[1:10:53] Christ's name we pray amen bless you
[1:10:55] this morning you may be seated today
[1:10:58] just a couple of announcements we'd
[1:11:00] certainly like to just have a special
[1:11:02] appreciation and welcome brother Tony
[1:11:05] ojerbesa who is with us his brother
[1:11:07] John's dad
[1:11:12] God bless you brother Tony
[1:11:15] the uh the brothers did a good job
[1:11:18] protecting him
[1:11:19] he didn't come in until I guess nine
[1:11:22] o'clock last evening I didn't know that
[1:11:23] he was coming so
[1:11:26] um otherwise we probably would have had
[1:11:27] him take the service today but he's
[1:11:30] traveling to Edmonton and uh he's going
[1:11:32] to go and spend some time with brother
[1:11:34] Ed and the church there and then he's
[1:11:36] going to go over with brother Jerry and
[1:11:38] take a service there I believe but I
[1:11:40] think he has a little bit of time for us
[1:11:42] at the end of the week where maybe he'll
[1:11:44] take the service on Sunday we'll just
[1:11:45] see
[1:11:46] we certainly don't want to put any
[1:11:47] pressure on or get in the way but uh you
[1:11:50] know there's an opportunity for the Lord
[1:11:52] to use our brother and just Express
[1:11:54] what's on his heart it's always
[1:11:56] wonderful to hear how the Lord is
[1:11:58] speaking to us and through Us and how
[1:12:00] it's the same spirit
[1:12:01] it's not another spirit it's the same
[1:12:03] spirit and whether it's on one continent
[1:12:06] or another it's always the same Spirit
[1:12:08] when it's the spirit of Truth
[1:12:11] so God bless you brother Tony welcome
[1:12:13] trust you feel right at home
[1:12:16] we just have a few announcements about
[1:12:18] the calendar coming up we have brother
[1:12:20] Gilbert taking the service on Wednesday
[1:12:21] we have a deacons meeting on the 16th we
[1:12:25] have the youth meeting on the 17th and I
[1:12:28] believe that we're going to be hosting
[1:12:29] that it's going to be at our place on
[1:12:31] the 17th which will be fun we certainly
[1:12:34] enjoy the the youth
[1:12:36] um we have a trustees meeting coming up
[1:12:38] and I do believe I misannounced it last
[1:12:40] Sunday forgive me for that I believe I
[1:12:43] said it was for the 13th and originally
[1:12:44] I had done that but we have moved it it
[1:12:47] is to the 20 uh third is the trustees
[1:12:52] meeting
[1:12:53] and uh we have a gym night we'll text
[1:12:56] you with the information with the
[1:12:57] details I believe it's at Central
[1:12:59] Memorial High it's on the 24th and I do
[1:13:02] apologize it's a little bit later but we
[1:13:04] have done them in the past where they're
[1:13:07] kind of earlier and it makes it
[1:13:09] difficult for people to actually get
[1:13:10] there on time and we only get a
[1:13:13] scheduled hour in the building so if you
[1:13:15] come half an hour late then there's only
[1:13:17] a half an hour left to play so we just
[1:13:20] tried to do it a little bit later it was
[1:13:22] my fault sister Shelley gave me the
[1:13:24] opportunity to choose the time and I
[1:13:26] just went a little bit later so that we
[1:13:27] could take the time and hopefully
[1:13:29] everybody get there that wants to on
[1:13:32] time and then have the time to to rip it
[1:13:34] up and and have fun so the 24th will
[1:13:37] text you with the details and the 28th
[1:13:39] we have the annual men's meeting that
[1:13:42] will be seven o'clock in the church here
[1:13:44] and uh I trust that is all right
[1:13:48] just have a couple of housekeeping items
[1:13:50] we wanted to mention and that first one
[1:13:53] is if if you're going to have food in
[1:13:56] the church we would ask that you would
[1:13:58] refrain from having food in the
[1:13:59] sanctuary
[1:14:00] for your children
[1:14:03] just no food in the sanctuary please we
[1:14:06] would like to ask that secondly in the
[1:14:09] room the baby room at the back
[1:14:11] the the
[1:14:13] Brothers have had to clean two weeks in
[1:14:15] a row
[1:14:16] clean the carpet in the room
[1:14:18] someone is feeding their child there or
[1:14:21] something is happening with food in
[1:14:22] there I don't know what's happening but
[1:14:24] if you're going to have food please
[1:14:26] clean up after you have food we would
[1:14:29] trust that you would ask that you would
[1:14:31] take it downstairs if you're going to
[1:14:33] eat and if you are downstairs please
[1:14:35] just clean up don't leave a mess if your
[1:14:39] children have food if they have crackers
[1:14:40] if they have any food parents it's your
[1:14:42] responsibility to make sure that you're
[1:14:44] watching that child that you're you're
[1:14:46] looking after them and if there is a
[1:14:48] mess just please clean it up or if there
[1:14:50] is a mess that you can't clean up just
[1:14:51] please let someone know and I'm sure
[1:14:53] that we would have uh one of the deacons
[1:14:55] gladly help clean it up maybe get a
[1:14:57] vacuum or whatever we need to do so
[1:14:59] please
[1:15:00] um if if you're having food with your
[1:15:02] children we know that they need snacks
[1:15:04] and and that's the way it is it's the
[1:15:05] life that we live in please just monitor
[1:15:07] your children and if there's a mess we
[1:15:09] certainly want to clean it up as soon as
[1:15:11] possible
[1:15:12] so thank you for that
[1:15:14] um tithes tithing we will have tax
[1:15:16] receipts available I believe they're
[1:15:18] coming up the end of next week I think
[1:15:21] is what we talked about is that right
[1:15:23] um so we will have tax receipts emailed
[1:15:25] out to everyone by the end of next week
[1:15:27] and if you're looking for a tax receipt
[1:15:30] please ensure that your email address is
[1:15:33] in the church directory if it's not in
[1:15:36] the church directory it's impossible for
[1:15:38] us to email it so um if you do want to
[1:15:41] actually have a tax receipt for tithes
[1:15:44] that you've given
[1:15:46] um like I said just please reach out and
[1:15:47] make sure that your email address is on
[1:15:50] the church directory if it's on the
[1:15:51] church directory you will not be getting
[1:15:52] a tax receipt via email
[1:15:54] and if you want one perhaps you can ask
[1:15:57] for it at that point
[1:15:59] uh one of the things we did want to
[1:16:01] point out as well if you could bring up
[1:16:03] the picture brother
[1:16:04] we have the envelopes for tithing and uh
[1:16:08] if if you want to see a tax receipt you
[1:16:11] have to use the envelope
[1:16:13] if you do not use an envelope
[1:16:15] they have no way of telling who actually
[1:16:17] donated the funds we wind up with a
[1:16:20] bunch of loose cash that has to go into
[1:16:23] the account but there's no way of
[1:16:25] accounting whose cash it came from who
[1:16:28] it came from so if you would like a tax
[1:16:30] receipt please ensure you use the
[1:16:31] envelope and you put your name in it if
[1:16:34] if you don't do that we don't know who
[1:16:36] gave the money also on the top right
[1:16:39] there there's the opportunity to Mark
[1:16:42] whether it's a tithe an offering or
[1:16:44] missions every one of those is uh
[1:16:47] scriptural we we rely on them it's part
[1:16:50] of the body so please just make sure you
[1:16:53] indicate which one of those you would
[1:16:55] like to allocate the money for as well
[1:16:57] so if you have any questions please just
[1:16:59] reach out to us after service or even
[1:17:01] during the week we'll be happy to answer
[1:17:03] them for you
[1:17:05] um we just want to make sure that we get
[1:17:08] the advantage every Advantage we can and
[1:17:11] if you're donating there's no reason why
[1:17:14] you shouldn't get a tax receipt for the
[1:17:15] money that you donate
[1:17:18] um so like I said if you have any
[1:17:19] questions please just reach out after
[1:17:21] service or later in the week and we'll
[1:17:22] certainly try and answer them for you
[1:17:25] we have uh
[1:17:28] we have
[1:17:29] just a tremendous opportunity one more
[1:17:31] time to Feast on the word today are you
[1:17:34] happy this morning
[1:17:36] today I just want to carry on our
[1:17:38] thought talking about the True Vine and
[1:17:40] I can't get away from the thought about
[1:17:42] Revelation so some of this might be a
[1:17:44] little bit of a repeat and I apologize
[1:17:45] if it is I'm going to try and go a
[1:17:47] little faster today to get maybe a
[1:17:49] little further but it's good to just
[1:17:50] sort of go back and then push forwards
[1:17:53] go back and and remind and stir up our
[1:17:56] Pure Minds by way of remembrance and
[1:17:57] then go forwards I'm going to start
[1:17:58] talking about Revelation this morning
[1:18:00] our Christian walk is solely dependent
[1:18:04] on Revelation the ability for us to hear
[1:18:06] the word for our day is all about
[1:18:09] Revelation if we don't have Revelation
[1:18:10] in our lives then we miss completely
[1:18:12] what's going on
[1:18:15] uh welcome brother Gabriel by the way
[1:18:17] and your family certainly a pleasure to
[1:18:19] see you here today
[1:18:21] what is revelation brother Brown talks
[1:18:23] about it in the in the church age book
[1:18:25] he says this book is usually termed the
[1:18:28] revelation of Saint John speaking about
[1:18:31] the Book of Revelations it's usually
[1:18:33] termed the revelation of Saint John but
[1:18:35] that is incorrect it is the revelation
[1:18:38] of Jesus Christ
[1:18:40] given to John for Christians of all ages
[1:18:44] it's the only book in the entire Bible
[1:18:45] that is written by Jesus himself through
[1:18:49] personally appearing to a scribe
[1:18:54] it's the last book of the Bible yet it
[1:18:56] tells excuse me the beginning and end of
[1:19:00] the dispensations of the Gospel
[1:19:03] the dispensations of the Gospel is
[1:19:05] something I just want to maybe put in
[1:19:07] there as a little marker as we go
[1:19:09] forwards just to think about we talked
[1:19:11] about it in the past but I don't know if
[1:19:13] I
[1:19:15] really did it justice so we'll try and
[1:19:17] push forwards think about the
[1:19:19] dispensations of the Gospel brother
[1:19:21] Bradham goes on to say now the Greek
[1:19:22] word for Revelation is apocalypse which
[1:19:25] means unveiling
[1:19:28] this unveiling is perfectly described in
[1:19:30] the example of a sculptor unveiling his
[1:19:33] work of Statuary exposing it to the
[1:19:37] onlooker it is an uncovering revealing
[1:19:40] what was previously hidden
[1:19:43] now the uncovering is not only the
[1:19:46] revelation of the person of Christ but
[1:19:48] it is the revelation of his Future Works
[1:19:51] in the oncoming seven Church ages I
[1:19:54] think this is beautiful to talk about
[1:19:55] because here we are in 2023 talking
[1:19:58] about the future work and the oncoming
[1:20:01] Church ages and here we are we know that
[1:20:04] we are just blending past the laodicean
[1:20:07] church age we know we talked about this
[1:20:09] thoroughly that we are all the way into
[1:20:11] the bride age now some people are still
[1:20:14] stuck in laodicea and we're not here to
[1:20:16] put anybody in or put anybody out or say
[1:20:18] say one's up or one's down one's in or
[1:20:21] one's out I I don't think that's our
[1:20:22] position to do that our position is to
[1:20:25] discern the spirits and pray for one
[1:20:27] another and love one another not put
[1:20:29] someone in or out but here we are
[1:20:32] recognizing this by Revelation that
[1:20:34] there is a future work in a future
[1:20:37] Church age for something to be happening
[1:20:39] Brother Brown goes on to say the
[1:20:40] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[1:20:43] to a True Believer can never be over
[1:20:45] emphasized I think that that that that
[1:20:47] that paragraph right there we could just
[1:20:49] preach a whole sermon on that the
[1:20:51] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[1:20:54] not by a minister
[1:20:56] not by a book not by a theologian
[1:20:59] not even by a tape we could say a tape
[1:21:01] we could say a book but it's got to be
[1:21:04] the spirit of God that comes by and
[1:21:05] quickens that word if he doesn't come by
[1:21:08] and energize that word then it's only
[1:21:10] reading and learning it's only chapter
[1:21:13] and verse but we have got to have the
[1:21:16] quickening spirit of the Holy Ghost In
[1:21:18] Our Lives to be able to understand the
[1:21:20] Future Works in the oncoming Church ages
[1:21:22] the importance of Revelation by the
[1:21:24] spirit to the True Believer can never be
[1:21:26] over emphasized I think we could just
[1:21:29] keep talking about it over and over and
[1:21:30] over because brother Branham said so
[1:21:32] amen I just love that Revelation means
[1:21:35] more to you than perhaps you realize now
[1:21:38] I'm not talking about this book of
[1:21:39] Revelation on you and I apologize if
[1:21:42] this is Elementary for those people who
[1:21:44] understand the message of the hour
[1:21:45] people maybe who are veterans of the
[1:21:47] word who have been around the seven
[1:21:50] Church age book for years and years but
[1:21:52] this is fresh Manna From Heaven I
[1:21:54] believe this is really the Keystone
[1:21:56] Revelation for the believer if we don't
[1:21:58] have Revelation then we don't understand
[1:22:00] it what does it mean that God sent a
[1:22:02] prophet how many people can say God sent
[1:22:04] a prophet Amen to that we believe God
[1:22:07] said a prophet we know all about it we
[1:22:09] know where he came from we know where he
[1:22:11] he passed away we know all the events in
[1:22:14] between and that's fantastic we can know
[1:22:16] all the history some people are even
[1:22:18] putting together memorabilia of the
[1:22:20] Prophet but what good is any of that
[1:22:22] without revelation
[1:22:25] why did that Prophet come brothers and
[1:22:27] sisters it wasn't so that we could get
[1:22:28] memorabilia so that we could put
[1:22:30] together books and tapes it was so that
[1:22:32] we could preach the gospel brother
[1:22:34] Branham said it's not about going and
[1:22:37] printing materials he said it's not
[1:22:39] about going and creating schools and
[1:22:41] hospitals it's about preaching the
[1:22:43] gospel that's what the disciples were
[1:22:45] commissioned to do preach the gospel
[1:22:47] when we preached the gospel then the
[1:22:49] dynamic power of the revelation of who
[1:22:52] Jesus Christ truly is comes into the
[1:22:54] heart of the believer then we can
[1:22:56] recognize this word for our day we're
[1:22:58] given the opportunity to recognize Jesus
[1:23:01] Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:23:05] and that's the Crux of it right there
[1:23:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ when we
[1:23:09] get that Revelation in our lives we're
[1:23:12] no longer the same that's where we
[1:23:13] become a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:23:15] but the battle says Revelation means
[1:23:16] more to you than perhaps you realize now
[1:23:18] I'm not talking about this book of
[1:23:19] Revelation and you I'm talking about all
[1:23:22] Revelation it's tremendously important
[1:23:24] to the church
[1:23:26] he says do you remember in Matthew 16
[1:23:28] where Jesus asked the disciples this
[1:23:30] question whom do men say that the son of
[1:23:31] man have and they said some said that
[1:23:34] thou art John the Baptist some Elias
[1:23:37] others jeremius or one of the prophets
[1:23:40] and he saith unto them but who say ye
[1:23:43] that I am
[1:23:44] and this is where we're talking about
[1:23:46] the Revelation that brother branham's
[1:23:47] talking about here it comes down from
[1:23:49] being just something that is is
[1:23:51] ministered to us and we hear it at a
[1:23:53] high level and we say Revelation and
[1:23:55] it's a buzzword it's got to go further
[1:23:57] than that brothers and sisters the
[1:23:59] message of the hour has got to come down
[1:24:01] to that place where he can say to you
[1:24:03] who do you say that I am who who do you
[1:24:07] say that brother Branham was who do you
[1:24:10] say what do you say that brother Branham
[1:24:12] came to the Earth to do was it just to
[1:24:15] have memorabilia and books and tapes in
[1:24:17] a geographical location and a and a
[1:24:20] massive industry it's not about that at
[1:24:22] all brothers and sisters it's about
[1:24:24] preaching the gospel about people
[1:24:26] getting saved and then that person when
[1:24:29] he's saved he can go to his people and
[1:24:31] he can get people saved and that person
[1:24:33] when they get saved they can go to the
[1:24:35] next people and they can get saved it's
[1:24:37] not about holding a hand and having a
[1:24:40] denomination and saying that we're a
[1:24:41] nice fine group of people look at us
[1:24:43] let's just stick together and we'll be
[1:24:45] fine you know what we will be and we'll
[1:24:47] probably even see signs and wonders if
[1:24:49] we do that but it's not going to be the
[1:24:51] dynamic power of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:53] brother Branham talks about it very
[1:24:55] clearly you know what there'll be a few
[1:24:56] people that will just vanish one day
[1:24:58] it'll be the secret sudden going away of
[1:25:00] the church and the churches will just go
[1:25:01] on and you know he said it we I I just
[1:25:04] think this is wonderful he's he had a
[1:25:06] question asked to him what will they
[1:25:08] preach after the Rapture happens brother
[1:25:09] Branham and he said they'll preach the
[1:25:11] same thing because the same thing is
[1:25:14] what they think is right but it's not
[1:25:15] according to the word
[1:25:17] that's why I think going back to our
[1:25:19] original topic here the True Vine I am
[1:25:22] the True Vine the only way we're going
[1:25:24] to see that Rapture is to have that True
[1:25:26] Vine we've got to be grafted into that
[1:25:29] True Vine but you know we're not even
[1:25:31] grafted into that True Vine that True
[1:25:33] Vine we come out of it it's a branch
[1:25:35] that grows out of that True Vine and as
[1:25:38] that Branch grows out what happens is he
[1:25:40] purges that branch and when that branch
[1:25:42] is purged it brings forth fruit and when
[1:25:45] that fruit is there he says amen look at
[1:25:47] that's my son that's my daughter I want
[1:25:49] to see more fruit on that branch and the
[1:25:51] more fruit that comes out of it the more
[1:25:53] he's glorified is what his word says and
[1:25:55] that's why we're here brothers and
[1:25:56] sisters is to glorify him isn't it to
[1:25:59] give him the fruit of our lips to give
[1:26:01] him the worship in our heart to
[1:26:02] recognize that he reached down his hand
[1:26:04] for us we did not reach up our hand for
[1:26:07] him we didn't one day decide hey I want
[1:26:09] to hear if God said a prophet I want to
[1:26:11] hear the message of the hour God came
[1:26:12] knocking on our door and said hey I know
[1:26:15] where you are I know you're down in the
[1:26:16] depths of sin you're in the gutter but
[1:26:18] hey I have come for you
[1:26:22] I have Revelation for you
[1:26:25] who do who do men say that I am
[1:26:28] they said some say they were John the
[1:26:30] Baptist some Elias other jeremius other
[1:26:33] the prophets and he said unto them who
[1:26:35] who say ye that I am he makes it
[1:26:38] personal who do you say that I am and
[1:26:40] Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art
[1:26:43] the Christ the son of the Living God and
[1:26:45] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[1:26:47] art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and
[1:26:49] Blood hath not revealed it to thee but
[1:26:51] my Father which is in heaven
[1:26:54] and I also I say I say unto thee that
[1:26:58] thou art Peter and Upon This Rock will I
[1:27:00] build my church I don't really want to
[1:27:01] go too far with that I just want to
[1:27:02] Simply say this has anybody ever had
[1:27:04] Jesus speak that to you you ever hear
[1:27:06] that in your voice in your ear in your
[1:27:09] spiritual ear you ever have a situation
[1:27:11] where something gets revealed to you and
[1:27:14] maybe it sounds a little bit crazy and
[1:27:15] you just don't understand it but you
[1:27:16] take it back to the word of God and you
[1:27:18] say wow that's actually what Jesus said
[1:27:21] there or you take it back to the message
[1:27:23] of the hour and you hear that's exactly
[1:27:25] what brother Bradham said about that
[1:27:27] where did that crazy idea come from
[1:27:29] brothers and sisters call it crazy all
[1:27:31] you want that's the word of God
[1:27:32] revealing himself to you personally and
[1:27:35] when that happens my goodness we have
[1:27:37] the opportunity to Rejoice if it's ever
[1:27:40] happened to you one time brothers and
[1:27:41] sisters I want to tell you this that's
[1:27:43] the Holy Ghost talking to you
[1:27:45] that's the Holy Ghost talking to you and
[1:27:47] you know what the Holy Ghost don't talk
[1:27:49] to everyone
[1:27:50] he don't talk to everyone if you have
[1:27:53] the ability to hear the Holy Ghost once
[1:27:55] you've got the ability to hear the Holy
[1:27:57] Ghost twice and if you've heard them
[1:27:58] once or twice if you've heard them once
[1:28:00] or twice in your life brothers and
[1:28:01] sisters I want to say likely you have
[1:28:04] the Holy Ghost
[1:28:07] you don't have to worry about praying
[1:28:08] for the Holy Ghost and hoping for the
[1:28:10] Holy Ghost and wondering about the Holy
[1:28:12] Ghost if he speaks to you you've got it
[1:28:15] you you have the spirit of Christ Living
[1:28:18] out through you we're going to always
[1:28:19] contend with this flesh though and
[1:28:21] Satan's going to come around and say
[1:28:22] look at you you're a scoundrel and you
[1:28:24] know according to this flesh we all are
[1:28:26] right that's not how God sees us because
[1:28:29] remember in the garden brother Branham
[1:28:31] said there's only one thing he asked for
[1:28:33] when he prayed over the disciples and
[1:28:36] the church and the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:28:38] in the garden he prayed for every one of
[1:28:40] his Believers from the beginning until
[1:28:43] the ending he prayed for all of them and
[1:28:45] he says sanctify them through thy truth
[1:28:48] Thy word is truth and here we have a
[1:28:52] Prophet come in our day that says
[1:28:54] Revelation is more important to you than
[1:28:55] you realize and and you know what his
[1:28:57] will is his will is his word
[1:29:00] because his word is truth
[1:29:06] let's start though Simon barjona for
[1:29:08] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[1:29:10] unto you and I want to say blessed
[1:29:12] every one of us every one of you not
[1:29:14] because we're good people because we're
[1:29:16] Scoundrels and we recognize that outside
[1:29:18] of him reaching his hand down and
[1:29:20] actually putting our names in the Lamb's
[1:29:22] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:29:24] the world outside of that happening we
[1:29:26] would never be able to hear this word we
[1:29:28] would never have an ear to hear what the
[1:29:30] spirits saith unto the church so blessed
[1:29:32] start you
[1:29:33] just like he says here let's start
[1:29:35] though Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood
[1:29:37] hath not revealed it to you but my
[1:29:38] Father which is in heaven and I say unto
[1:29:41] thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock
[1:29:43] will I build my church and the Gates of
[1:29:45] Hell shall not Prevail against it so if
[1:29:47] you've ever had a revelation in your
[1:29:48] life if you've got a revelation about
[1:29:50] who the prophet is and why the prophet
[1:29:52] was sent brothers and sisters the Gates
[1:29:53] of Hell cannot Prevail against you
[1:29:56] cannot Prevail against that Revelation
[1:29:58] because that's what the the whole entire
[1:30:00] gospel is built upon our Salvation is
[1:30:02] built upon the gates of hell not being
[1:30:05] able to Prevail against us
[1:30:07] the Roman Catholics say that the church
[1:30:09] is built upon Peter now that is really
[1:30:12] carnal how could God build the church
[1:30:13] Upon A man so unstable that he denied
[1:30:15] the Lord Jesus and cursed while doing it
[1:30:18] God can't build his church upon any man
[1:30:21] born in sin
[1:30:23] and it wasn't some rock lying there as
[1:30:25] though God had hallowed the ground at
[1:30:27] that spot and it isn't as the
[1:30:30] Protestants say that the church is built
[1:30:33] upon Jesus
[1:30:35] it's pretty heavy when you really listen
[1:30:37] to this
[1:30:38] it was the Revelation it was the
[1:30:41] Revelation he says read it the way it's
[1:30:43] written Flesh and Blood hath not
[1:30:45] revealed it but my father hath revealed
[1:30:49] it and Upon This Rock Revelation I will
[1:30:53] build my church the church is built on
[1:30:57] Revelation the thus saith the Lord how
[1:31:01] important it is to recognize the
[1:31:03] Revelation Brothers and Sisters of the
[1:31:06] True Vine revelation of the spirit of
[1:31:08] Truth the Revelation that he Sanctified
[1:31:11] them through his word through his truth
[1:31:14] he did it all
[1:31:16] the only thing that we did was one day
[1:31:18] recognized that he did it all and when
[1:31:20] that happened brothers and sisters it
[1:31:22] changes everything in our lives my
[1:31:24] goodness
[1:31:26] I just can't help but think about how
[1:31:29] how Jesus Christ is all that God was
[1:31:33] it's a stunning thought to think that
[1:31:36] there's people that want to try even in
[1:31:39] and around the ranks of the message of
[1:31:40] the hour try and and cut Jesus up cut
[1:31:44] God up and and try and compartmentalize
[1:31:46] the the differences and say that the the
[1:31:49] godhead is some sort of technical
[1:31:51] difficulty that unless you see it my way
[1:31:54] or the way that my teacher has given it
[1:31:56] then then you just don't see it at all
[1:31:58] that's not it
[1:32:00] he is not he has not come to be the
[1:32:03] author of confusion is he his word says
[1:32:05] that I'm not the author of confusion
[1:32:07] when we start to get confused and
[1:32:09] something's taken us astray brothers and
[1:32:11] sisters because he has hid himself in
[1:32:14] Simplicity and revealed himself in the
[1:32:16] same and and it's not as complicated as
[1:32:20] some would try and make it but this this
[1:32:22] doctrine of splitting him up and making
[1:32:24] him something other than what what
[1:32:25] brother Bradham said he was
[1:32:28] is is amazing
[1:32:31] but all that God was he poured into
[1:32:32] Christ
[1:32:34] and all that Christ was he poured into
[1:32:36] his church is what brother Bradham said
[1:32:38] isn't that wonderful wouldn't you think
[1:32:40] he would say all that God was he poured
[1:32:41] into Christ and all that Christ was he
[1:32:43] poured into the Holy Ghost
[1:32:46] wouldn't you think that's what he would
[1:32:48] say but we know that would automatically
[1:32:50] turn into the the three-sided stick that
[1:32:52] people already wield and try and Club
[1:32:54] the bride
[1:32:56] or the female the feminine the church
[1:32:58] but you know it's not like that at all
[1:33:01] he's one all that God was he poured unto
[1:33:03] Christ and all that Christ was the
[1:33:04] prophet said he poured into his church
[1:33:06] and here we are this morning recognizing
[1:33:08] that we're not just the church he didn't
[1:33:10] pour it just into the church nominal he
[1:33:12] poured it into the bride
[1:33:14] the Bride of Jesus Christ but you know
[1:33:16] what brothers and sisters if we're not
[1:33:18] careful we're going to miss what's
[1:33:19] actually happening what's really
[1:33:20] happening Brother Bradham says in the
[1:33:22] message of rapture it would be
[1:33:23] astounding for me to explain to you
[1:33:24] what's actually taking place I want to
[1:33:27] say this let us rejoice and be very glad
[1:33:29] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:33:31] and his bride hath made herself ready
[1:33:34] and that's what we're doing every single
[1:33:36] time we get together in service like
[1:33:38] this is getting ourselves ready
[1:33:39] recognizing that his word is what's
[1:33:42] going to address us to get over there
[1:33:44] we're putting on the wedding garment
[1:33:46] right now we're in the midst of the
[1:33:48] wedding this is the marriage of the Lamb
[1:33:51] don't look around for something great
[1:33:53] some great Fantastics brother Bradham
[1:33:55] says don't look for great signs and
[1:33:57] wonders one day will actually achieve
[1:33:59] something the only thing that we're
[1:34:00] going to achieve is the ability to
[1:34:02] receive the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:34:03] because when we get that token in our
[1:34:05] lives we can hold that token over our
[1:34:07] prayers here today we can hold that
[1:34:09] token over our families here today we
[1:34:12] can hold that token over our churches
[1:34:13] here today
[1:34:15] but without the token brothers and
[1:34:16] sisters we're just another denomination
[1:34:19] we don't want to take the token and make
[1:34:21] it something that's tangible and say
[1:34:23] that I can say the token is this and and
[1:34:25] explain it perfectly who can explain God
[1:34:29] because that's what the token is
[1:34:31] the token is the Holy Ghost
[1:34:33] we know that back in in the days of the
[1:34:36] Exodus the children of Israel they were
[1:34:38] told there will be a token I'll give you
[1:34:40] a token and it will be to take that
[1:34:42] blood from the lamb take a lamb and and
[1:34:45] slay it and apply it above the door and
[1:34:48] on the link on the doorpost and on the
[1:34:51] lintel and and when that death angel
[1:34:53] passes over the land I'll pass over you
[1:34:56] and we know that was the start of the
[1:34:58] Passover but that is such an incredible
[1:35:00] thought because how were those people
[1:35:03] instructed to apply that blood
[1:35:07] God never voiced from Heaven apply the
[1:35:10] blood take the lamb and kill the lamb
[1:35:12] what he did was he spoke to his prophet
[1:35:15] according to the way children of Israel
[1:35:16] said don't speak to us no no no no no
[1:35:18] we'll die if you speak to us but if you
[1:35:21] just would talk to a man and he hasn't
[1:35:23] changed this program
[1:35:24] today he still speaks through a man
[1:35:29] but all that God poured into
[1:35:32] all that God was he poured unto Christ
[1:35:33] I'll just read the quote again of the
[1:35:34] marriage of the Lamb he says you can be
[1:35:36] an artificial professed Christian but
[1:35:38] you can't be a Christian until Christ
[1:35:40] injects himself by the baptism of the
[1:35:43] Holy Ghost In You
[1:35:46] then you're connected with him
[1:35:47] and you're no longer Twain You're one
[1:35:50] and we know that's what Paul talked
[1:35:52] about in Ephesians chapter 5. this is a
[1:35:54] great mystery speaking about a husband
[1:35:56] and a wife it's a great mystery but this
[1:35:59] mystery that I'm talking about isn't
[1:36:00] about a husband and a wife necessarily
[1:36:02] on Earth not not not the sensual husband
[1:36:06] and wife on Earth no no not the way they
[1:36:08] fell in the Garden of Eden not about
[1:36:10] that at all we're talking about the
[1:36:12] mystery Christ The Mystery of God
[1:36:15] revealed that's what we're talking about
[1:36:17] that's what he's talking about here he
[1:36:20] says then you're connected with him and
[1:36:21] you're no longer Twain you are one
[1:36:25] Christ promised
[1:36:27] to be in US
[1:36:29] as the father was in Christ
[1:36:32] you know if we could we could read this
[1:36:34] in in John chapter 17 and and maybe
[1:36:37] maybe I will a little bit later maybe we
[1:36:40] can together he says you're no longer
[1:36:43] Twain You're one Christ promised to be
[1:36:45] in us as the father was in us I and my
[1:36:47] father are one you and I are one see
[1:36:50] Christ in us all that God was he poured
[1:36:54] into Christ and all that Christ was he
[1:36:56] poured into the church to continue the
[1:36:59] work of the Gospel
[1:37:01] then we become not by artificial name
[1:37:03] but by reality of the Holy Spirit of
[1:37:06] Life connecting us into Christ
[1:37:09] then through the power of his
[1:37:11] resurrection we're raised from the dead
[1:37:13] things of this world and set it seated
[1:37:17] with him in Heavenly places
[1:37:20] not everyone goes through an experience
[1:37:22] where you're raised from the dead things
[1:37:24] of this world I understand that but
[1:37:26] brothers and sisters if you're not out
[1:37:28] party ended up like the rest of the
[1:37:30] world and and you have something in you
[1:37:32] that constrains you to come to church on
[1:37:34] a Sunday something constrains you to
[1:37:36] want to pray to speak to the Lord Jesus
[1:37:38] Christ yourself individually something
[1:37:41] that constrains you to want to read his
[1:37:43] Bible read his word there's something in
[1:37:45] you brothers and sisters that's the Holy
[1:37:47] Ghost I would say you too are no longer
[1:37:50] to your one your Twain his spirit is
[1:37:53] living out inside of you
[1:37:55] all that God was he's poured into the
[1:37:57] church all that God was he poured into
[1:37:59] Christ all that Christ was he's poured
[1:38:01] into the church now remember we talked
[1:38:02] about this in the first seal 1963
[1:38:05] brother Brown I'm preaching the seals
[1:38:07] first seal right at the beginning when
[1:38:09] the angel of the Lord came and met him
[1:38:11] in the room brother Bradham said I would
[1:38:12] have preached it wrong I would have said
[1:38:14] it wrong but the angel of the Lord the
[1:38:17] angel of the Covenant came and met me in
[1:38:19] the room and he corrected me so when he
[1:38:21] was saying these words brothers and
[1:38:22] sisters I believe with all my heart this
[1:38:24] wasn't the man speaking this was God
[1:38:27] bringing out something he wanted his
[1:38:29] church to know and what he said was I no
[1:38:32] longer call you church I call you bride
[1:38:35] and I call you this so that you might
[1:38:37] understand what's happening he says the
[1:38:41] twain become one you're no longer two
[1:38:43] you're going to be one as soon as all
[1:38:45] these seals are unraveled unopened once
[1:38:48] you can actually open rather not
[1:38:50] unopened once they're opened you're
[1:38:52] going to be one once you receive this
[1:38:54] word into you
[1:38:56] but we know it wasn't for that time I
[1:38:59] think there was a conversation that
[1:39:00] happened somewhere along the way where
[1:39:02] brother Branham asked the question do
[1:39:03] you understand what's taking place I
[1:39:05] think it was in the seventh seal and in
[1:39:07] the seventh seal some of the people said
[1:39:09] yeah and he said no I don't think you do
[1:39:12] understand what's going on I could be
[1:39:14] wrong about that I know he said it
[1:39:16] somewhere people at the time didn't
[1:39:18] understand what was happening but here
[1:39:20] we are 60 years down the road brothers
[1:39:21] and sisters that Revelation that when we
[1:39:24] listen to this when we read this when we
[1:39:26] preach this he opens it further and
[1:39:29] further to us and we recognize our
[1:39:31] position he said you know when the bride
[1:39:33] recognized it when the church recognizes
[1:39:34] its position that's the exact quote then
[1:39:37] the Rapture will go
[1:39:39] and one day that's going to happen and
[1:39:41] and he says he can discern it as a
[1:39:44] prophet he said no no no someone's
[1:39:46] Discerning saying saying something in
[1:39:48] their heart oh no he's wrong with that
[1:39:50] he says no it's true
[1:39:52] it's true when the church recognizes its
[1:39:54] position and I want to say this it's
[1:39:56] position if she is bride its position is
[1:39:59] right beside him as bride but when the
[1:40:02] twain become one brothers and sisters
[1:40:04] that's the critical Factor here that's
[1:40:07] what we're talking about when the two
[1:40:08] become one when the two become one then
[1:40:11] when she speaks he speaks it's no longer
[1:40:14] her it's him
[1:40:16] and it all is about him
[1:40:19] I just can't help but think about this
[1:40:21] that all that God was he poured unto
[1:40:23] Christ all that Christ was he poured
[1:40:25] into his church or let's say the bride
[1:40:27] he poured it himself into the bride and
[1:40:30] I think even this morning he's pouring
[1:40:31] himself into the bride every time we
[1:40:33] Press Play He's pouring himself into the
[1:40:35] bride every time we open our hearts and
[1:40:38] start to speak with our lips he's
[1:40:39] pouring himself into the bride we have
[1:40:42] so many opportunities for that we talked
[1:40:45] about this on Wednesday I believe and I
[1:40:46] just want to say it again but if that's
[1:40:48] what God would do through Jesus Christ
[1:40:50] to his bride to his church how are we as
[1:40:52] husbands to pour ourselves into our
[1:40:55] bride how ought we to pour ourselves
[1:40:57] into our families
[1:40:59] same thing with the wives in their
[1:41:00] position same thing with the children in
[1:41:02] their positions
[1:41:03] and we talked about this I'm just going
[1:41:05] to say it again we can take this quote
[1:41:07] many times Look Away to Jesus 1963.
[1:41:09] brother Brown I'm talking about his wife
[1:41:11] how she sends his clothes to the
[1:41:12] cleaners and washed his shirts and have
[1:41:14] everything wetter and and he says how
[1:41:16] how she says how can I serve God and in
[1:41:19] this quote he says she serves God the
[1:41:21] way she serves me wives the way you
[1:41:23] serve your husbands is the way you serve
[1:41:25] God
[1:41:26] and it's an interesting way to look at
[1:41:29] things because now today we have a
[1:41:32] spirit that's raising up even in the
[1:41:34] message of the hour I'll say it honestly
[1:41:36] where the wives are actually trying to
[1:41:38] use serp Authority but you know what
[1:41:40] happens is the husbands they get out
[1:41:42] from under the blood they get out from
[1:41:44] under the word they get on their own
[1:41:46] little track and what happens when that
[1:41:48] happens is the wife sees that there's
[1:41:50] nobody at the wheel spiritually speaking
[1:41:53] of the of the family and that's when the
[1:41:55] wife grabs control
[1:41:58] and you know
[1:41:59] we want to get back from that as
[1:42:01] husbands we want to say no you got to be
[1:42:02] in your position but you know what
[1:42:04] happens that's not the way to do it the
[1:42:06] only way we get it back is to get in our
[1:42:08] position when we get in our position and
[1:42:10] go to our wife and say forgive me honey
[1:42:12] I haven't been in my position forgive me
[1:42:15] Lord I haven't been in my position then
[1:42:17] what happens spiritually she will fall
[1:42:20] under that headship she will fall under
[1:42:23] that rulership
[1:42:26] but we're not going to get outside of
[1:42:27] our position and then demand someone get
[1:42:29] back in theirs
[1:42:31] there's a word for that
[1:42:34] healing line brother Bradham says this
[1:42:36] and I think this is the critical part
[1:42:37] this is the part that I really want to
[1:42:39] focus on and I'm going to as we go
[1:42:41] forwards it's so important brothers and
[1:42:43] sisters we can point the finger at
[1:42:45] everyone else and say that you know
[1:42:47] someone should be doing and and it's not
[1:42:49] about that it was what are we doing
[1:42:52] all about us this is this is a
[1:42:55] narcissistic thing this is all about me
[1:42:57] it's got to be all about you brothers
[1:42:59] and sisters don't worry about anybody
[1:43:01] else just get in your position just get
[1:43:03] this word in your life and get in your
[1:43:05] position with this word and that's where
[1:43:07] you will see the Lord move in your life
[1:43:09] he says in so much as you have done unto
[1:43:11] the least of these my little ones you
[1:43:13] have did it unto me is that right he
[1:43:15] says listen here's a lovely thing as
[1:43:17] you're serving one another you're
[1:43:19] serving God see the love of God is in
[1:43:22] every Christian heart and be kind one to
[1:43:26] another
[1:43:27] forgive one another
[1:43:30] if you don't see the scriptures just
[1:43:31] alike well you behave anyhow and and
[1:43:34] pray for the other person and just love
[1:43:36] one another
[1:43:38] you might say brother Barry that's
[1:43:39] pretty easy blanket statement but you
[1:43:42] know we're not talking about love
[1:43:43] affiliate love we're talking about agape
[1:43:46] love we're talking about the love of
[1:43:48] Jesus Christ here this is the love we're
[1:43:50] talking about in in being able to
[1:43:52] forgive when your enemy spits on you
[1:43:56] I've seen Christian believers
[1:44:00] they have a temper like a buzzsaw I'll
[1:44:03] just say it straight out if someone
[1:44:06] Stomps on their toes look out man
[1:44:09] look out
[1:44:10] and you know brothers and sisters that's
[1:44:12] the old man it's the old nature
[1:44:14] that old man's Gotta Die
[1:44:17] in order for him to live
[1:44:21] we want to make sure that we're given
[1:44:23] Christ the room that he wants that he
[1:44:25] needs that he demands in our lives when
[1:44:28] we do that he'll live out through us
[1:44:31] the beautiful part is
[1:44:33] even though we contend with the old
[1:44:35] flesh the old man he's very resilient he
[1:44:39] he doesn't want to lay down and die
[1:44:41] that's why Paul said I Die daily so long
[1:44:44] as we're willing to reconcile with this
[1:44:46] word brothers and sisters his ears are
[1:44:49] always open to our prayers he's always
[1:44:51] listening to see if his sons and his
[1:44:54] daughters are willing to actually humble
[1:44:56] themselves in the sight of the Lord so
[1:44:58] that he can lift them up you know we
[1:45:00] read that quote I think it was last week
[1:45:02] where brother Bradham said he doesn't
[1:45:03] even look at you he doesn't even look at
[1:45:05] your flesh he's not even looking at you
[1:45:06] and your deeds and all the good things
[1:45:08] that you do and all the bad things that
[1:45:09] you do he's not even doing that what
[1:45:11] he's doing is listening to your voice he
[1:45:13] wants to hear who you're talking about
[1:45:15] he wants to hear what's in the heart of
[1:45:18] the believer because out of the
[1:45:19] abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:45:21] speaketh
[1:45:23] we've talked about it in the past you
[1:45:24] know many times you can get together
[1:45:25] with Believers and some people just want
[1:45:27] to talk about sports the whole time
[1:45:29] you're together some people want to talk
[1:45:31] about whatever else it is they're into
[1:45:33] and other people you get together with
[1:45:34] them and immediately they want to start
[1:45:36] talking about the word they start
[1:45:37] talking about the word they start
[1:45:38] talking about what God's done for them
[1:45:39] and and what God's doing in their family
[1:45:41] and what God's doing their job and all
[1:45:43] these different things and you just
[1:45:44] start to pour from one cup into the
[1:45:45] other you know what are the abundance of
[1:45:46] the heart the mouth speaketh brothers
[1:45:48] and sisters what are we doing with our
[1:45:49] lives what are we doing with our time
[1:45:51] you don't have to spend very much time
[1:45:52] with people to know where they're at
[1:45:54] it's not about judging people it's about
[1:45:56] recognizing you know what if we hang out
[1:45:58] with people who aren't in the word we're
[1:46:00] going to be dragged down we're not going
[1:46:03] to be built up but we have the
[1:46:05] opportunity in that situation to try and
[1:46:07] encourage them to build them up
[1:46:09] it's the Dynamics of the Lord the
[1:46:12] Dynamics of the life in US
[1:46:15] brother Branham goes on to say here he
[1:46:17] says just believe anyhow and pray for
[1:46:19] the other person and you just love one
[1:46:21] another you'll find there's no greater
[1:46:23] evidence of a Christian in the world
[1:46:25] than love
[1:46:28] I think it's so beautiful because in
[1:46:30] that in that quote he's not talking
[1:46:31] about saying you know what I love you so
[1:46:33] I'm I'm going to spank you now I'm gonna
[1:46:36] discipline you now according to the word
[1:46:39] that's not the love he's talking about
[1:46:41] amen that's not it at all
[1:46:43] God isn't like that brother Branham said
[1:46:45] it isn't it wonderful to think about he
[1:46:48] he used to think that God was mad at him
[1:46:51] there was a time in my life where I
[1:46:53] thought the same thing that God was mad
[1:46:54] at me I had no idea who Jesus who is
[1:46:56] Jesus this guy Jesus who is he I
[1:47:00] remember in my life wondering that I
[1:47:02] could never just never make the
[1:47:03] connection who is this Jesus I I don't
[1:47:06] get it and I remember thinking about it
[1:47:08] you know in school I went to a Christian
[1:47:09] School for a little while and they
[1:47:11] taught very clearly the the three
[1:47:12] circles in the Triangle the father of
[1:47:14] the son the Holy Ghost and and they're
[1:47:16] the three persons and and it just made
[1:47:19] it so confusing this this business of
[1:47:21] Jesus who is Jesus people talk about
[1:47:23] Jesus but one day he came and revealed
[1:47:26] himself to me and he made it crystal
[1:47:28] clear that Jesus was the manifestation
[1:47:31] of God because our human finite Minds
[1:47:34] would never be able to comprehend the
[1:47:36] glory of the Majesty on his throne in
[1:47:39] this Dimension we could never do it
[1:47:40] brothers and sisters the word says that
[1:47:42] no flesh will ever see him and live
[1:47:44] all this flesh has to pass away it has
[1:47:47] to perish but isn't it wonderful to
[1:47:49] think that he chose us he reached down
[1:47:51] his hand for me my goodness
[1:47:54] I think it's wonderful
[1:47:56] really what we're getting at brothers
[1:47:57] and sisters this Revelation is going
[1:47:59] somewhere we're going somewhere with
[1:48:01] this today we still have half an hour
[1:48:02] are we okay
[1:48:05] faith is the Revelation that we're
[1:48:07] talking about that's the ultimate
[1:48:09] Revelation faith in the word because
[1:48:11] what does the word of God says it says
[1:48:13] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:48:16] him but when we can have faith in the
[1:48:18] word of God that he has Sanctified Us by
[1:48:22] his word which is the truth I am the
[1:48:25] True Vine I am the I am that sent you
[1:48:28] down to Egypt Moses to do the one-man
[1:48:31] takeover the one-man Invasion I am the
[1:48:34] True Vine that is a revelation and that
[1:48:37] takes Faith but that faith that we're
[1:48:39] talking about is not our faith and and
[1:48:42] this is the trick the Devil comes in and
[1:48:43] he'll say well you know what sometimes
[1:48:45] people lose their faith if you've ever
[1:48:46] had your faith brothers and sisters
[1:48:48] you'll never lose your faith if you've
[1:48:49] ever had the holy ghost in your life
[1:48:51] you'll never lose the holy ghost that
[1:48:53] that's a denominational teaching that's
[1:48:54] a trick of the devil if you've had the
[1:48:56] faith to believe in this word of God you
[1:48:59] can never have it taken from you the
[1:49:01] reason people lose their faith though
[1:49:03] this is said very clearly by the prophet
[1:49:05] the reason people lose their faith is
[1:49:07] because they never really got the faith
[1:49:09] the faith that was once delivered unto
[1:49:11] the Saints the faith that was once
[1:49:13] delivered unto the Saints caused them to
[1:49:14] go up in an upper room afraid and come
[1:49:16] out bold as all get out saying you know
[1:49:19] what this is that that the prophet Joel
[1:49:21] spoke about and we talked about that
[1:49:22] prophecy circling the earth for many
[1:49:24] many years but there came a time where
[1:49:26] God positionally placed his people there
[1:49:28] there had to be a people to fulfill that
[1:49:30] prophecy and when they did they stumbled
[1:49:32] as drunk people they said they must be
[1:49:34] drunk they're crazy look at them but no
[1:49:36] it wasn't that it was that they received
[1:49:38] the word for their day and you know
[1:49:40] brothers and sisters when this
[1:49:41] Revelation hits the heart of a Believer
[1:49:44] you'll stumble as a drug person
[1:49:45] something will change you to behave in a
[1:49:48] different way and you know many people
[1:49:49] in the denominations will say well you
[1:49:51] got to speak in tongues and and maybe
[1:49:53] you've got a shiver or shake or maybe
[1:49:54] you'll get slain in the spirit or all
[1:49:56] these different manifestations maybe all
[1:49:58] of that will happen who knows that's God
[1:50:01] but we're not seeking those things we're
[1:50:03] seeking the word of God the word of God
[1:50:05] is the only thing that's going to get us
[1:50:07] in that Rapture it's the only thing
[1:50:09] that's going to get us out of the
[1:50:10] graveyard if we ever find ourselves
[1:50:12] there because the only thing that's
[1:50:14] going to save us is the word the truth
[1:50:16] and the faith in that word in that truth
[1:50:19] the faith that we're talking about is
[1:50:21] the end of our faith there comes a point
[1:50:23] in time as a Believer where we have to
[1:50:25] have the end of our faith where we just
[1:50:26] don't understand anymore
[1:50:28] I just don't get it I can't understand
[1:50:30] Jesus who is Jesus who is this man Jesus
[1:50:33] talking about my own testimony and
[1:50:35] forgive me for sounding this way but
[1:50:37] it's true it's the way it was but there
[1:50:38] was a time one time in my life where
[1:50:41] where I actually saw Jesus for who he
[1:50:43] was he was actually that manifestation
[1:50:45] the literal manifestation in flesh
[1:50:48] God so we could perf we could we could
[1:50:51] we could perceive God
[1:50:54] as a human being but when that happens
[1:50:57] brothers and sisters when that happens
[1:50:59] then it changes everything it's not
[1:51:02] three persons there ain't no triangle
[1:51:04] it's not three persons it's not three
[1:51:06] personalities it's one God it's one
[1:51:09] Revelation it's one Jesus because we
[1:51:13] know that that's the only name that will
[1:51:15] save us out of the anointed ones at the
[1:51:17] end time brother Bradham talks about
[1:51:18] faith being a revelation he says you
[1:51:20] said it wasn't a rebel it wasn't a
[1:51:22] revelation
[1:51:24] he says what is faith
[1:51:26] faith is something that's revealed to
[1:51:28] you
[1:51:29] that is not yet
[1:51:31] but you believe it will be
[1:51:33] anybody believe in something today
[1:51:36] that's not yet but will be
[1:51:42] faith is a revelation
[1:51:43] of the will of God
[1:51:46] his word is his will
[1:51:49] faith is a revelation that that's all we
[1:51:51] need we don't have to have a special
[1:51:53] Ministry we don't have to have someone
[1:51:55] prophesy over us because you know what
[1:51:57] brothers and sisters that's already
[1:51:59] happened
[1:52:00] Jesus prayed for us and prophesied for
[1:52:02] us in the garden
[1:52:04] the only thing that he asked for was our
[1:52:06] fellowship that's all and it wasn't our
[1:52:08] flesh it wasn't this flesh it was our
[1:52:10] theophany and you know what he's got it
[1:52:12] because he also said in his word that
[1:52:13] we're already seated in Heavenly places
[1:52:16] in Christ Jesus
[1:52:19] it was
[1:52:20] oh what does he say here sorry faith is
[1:52:22] something that's revealed to you that's
[1:52:24] not yet but you believe it will be faith
[1:52:27] is a revelation of the will of God
[1:52:29] so by revelation
[1:52:32] and the churches today don't even
[1:52:33] believe in spiritual Revelation they
[1:52:36] believe in a dogmatic teaching of some
[1:52:38] system
[1:52:40] and and I want to say this brothers and
[1:52:41] sisters if we're saved today and lost
[1:52:43] tomorrow if there's that in anybody's
[1:52:45] heart you unfortunately have been given
[1:52:48] a revelation of a dogmatic teaching
[1:52:50] system
[1:52:52] but by Revelation Abel offered unto God
[1:52:56] a more excellent sacrifice than that of
[1:52:58] Cain which God testified he was
[1:53:01] righteous amen I hope you see that see
[1:53:04] where we are living see the hour
[1:53:09] we talked about it on Wednesday but I
[1:53:11] just don't think it gets old recognizing
[1:53:13] that God he's not unjust he's not an
[1:53:15] unjust God Cain even though he didn't
[1:53:18] have the revelation God still came to
[1:53:21] him and said but if you would just do
[1:53:22] like your brother
[1:53:24] and and you know if he would have just
[1:53:27] received it then that would have changed
[1:53:29] everything for him wouldn't it have
[1:53:31] but he had nothing in his heart to mix
[1:53:33] with that word when it came to him right
[1:53:34] just like the children of Israel
[1:53:36] they had no faith in their heart they
[1:53:39] had nothing in their heart to mix with
[1:53:40] that word when it came for them but if
[1:53:43] you have something in your heart that
[1:53:44] mixes with that word if you have faith
[1:53:46] in your heart to mix with that word it
[1:53:48] changes it
[1:53:52] he goes I was not talking I was talking
[1:53:55] to a gentleman not long ago a Christian
[1:53:56] scholar gentleman he said Mr Branham we
[1:53:59] refuse all revelation
[1:54:02] can you imagine that we refuse all
[1:54:04] Revelations and I I think personally I
[1:54:06] guess
[1:54:07] excuse me it would be a safe place
[1:54:09] wouldn't it
[1:54:10] did this refuse all Revelations because
[1:54:12] if you've seen people manipulate the
[1:54:14] word of God you've seen false prophets
[1:54:17] false anointed ones false christs is
[1:54:19] what brother Branham says out of the
[1:54:21] false anointed ones if you've seen
[1:54:23] people misrepresent the word of God
[1:54:25] you'd want to refuse Revelation too
[1:54:27] and we can be clear when people talk
[1:54:29] about profits it's scary if you don't
[1:54:32] know about the the word of God and how
[1:54:35] he speaks to people through prophets if
[1:54:37] you don't understand that it can be a
[1:54:39] scary thing to say the word Prophet
[1:54:40] there's been some terrible terrible
[1:54:42] example some very very naughty false
[1:54:46] anointed ones that have come forward
[1:54:48] over time but you know to refuse all
[1:54:51] Revelation would just be easy wouldn't
[1:54:53] it to just say that we have a church and
[1:54:54] we have a a an idea book and and this is
[1:54:57] where all of our our our our inspiration
[1:55:00] comes from we just don't go outside the
[1:55:02] parameters of this and it would be a
[1:55:04] safe place but you know there's no room
[1:55:06] for the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost to
[1:55:08] move in that church and we want to see
[1:55:11] the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost move in
[1:55:13] our life so I can't help but imagine
[1:55:14] that that's why this this man this
[1:55:16] Christian scholar would be saying that
[1:55:18] you know what we just refused all
[1:55:19] Revelation because there's some quacks
[1:55:21] in the world and they're going to bring
[1:55:22] something really weird into the church
[1:55:24] and it's going to cause people to be
[1:55:26] lost or go astray
[1:55:28] and that's true we've seen it
[1:55:30] but here he is talking to the prophet of
[1:55:32] God now the seventh angel messenger he
[1:55:35] said Mr Brown and we refuse all
[1:55:37] Revelations I said then you have to
[1:55:38] refuse Jesus Christ for he is the
[1:55:41] revelation of God God revealed in human
[1:55:45] flesh
[1:55:46] unless you see it you're lost
[1:55:49] and I can say it myself when I realized
[1:55:52] who Jesus was it changed everything for
[1:55:55] me amen when I recognize that Jesus was
[1:55:58] God it changed everything for me I was
[1:56:00] able to recognize that God came down to
[1:56:04] die on the cross for my my sins for for
[1:56:08] my shortcomings for all of my faults and
[1:56:10] failures that's who Jesus was God's
[1:56:12] expression his sacrifice I couldn't
[1:56:15] understand who the sacrificial the
[1:56:16] sacrificial lamb the blood Jesus all
[1:56:19] that was just kind of Mumble jumbo to me
[1:56:21] in my mind until I caught that
[1:56:23] revelation of who Jesus Christ was but
[1:56:26] boy oh boy when you recognize that it
[1:56:28] changes everything brother Adam says
[1:56:30] accept your belief that I am he you'll
[1:56:32] die in your sins he is the revelation of
[1:56:35] God the spirit of God revealed in human
[1:56:37] form if you can't believe that you're
[1:56:39] lost
[1:56:41] if you put them in a third person second
[1:56:43] person or any other person besides God
[1:56:45] you're lost except you believe that I am
[1:56:47] he you shall die in your sins
[1:56:50] it's a revelation
[1:56:52] and you have to have faith in order for
[1:56:55] a revelation to come you have to have
[1:56:57] faith in God's word that it is the
[1:56:59] absolute we I remember one time one time
[1:57:03] I I went in a situation and and and I
[1:57:06] may have told this Story Once Upon a
[1:57:07] Time and I I can't remember but I was in
[1:57:09] a situation where where I was stuck with
[1:57:12] some guys that were drinking and I was a
[1:57:14] believer
[1:57:15] I was in in London England
[1:57:17] and and and I was out on the town it was
[1:57:19] a a a wedding
[1:57:22] stag party
[1:57:23] and nothing untowards really happened
[1:57:25] except for they were drinking and and
[1:57:27] honestly they wanted to go and do
[1:57:29] untowards things and I said I'm out I'm
[1:57:31] not doing it but this one guy he he was
[1:57:34] really upset because I I was the the
[1:57:37] spoilsport I was the party pooper for
[1:57:39] the group I didn't want to go and do
[1:57:40] what they wanted to do and and here I am
[1:57:42] I'm in a foreign country as a Believer
[1:57:44] and I'm with a bunch of people who are
[1:57:46] not Believers and and they want to go
[1:57:48] out and start doing stuff that's not
[1:57:50] proper for a Christian even a a man to
[1:57:53] go and do and and I said no no no I'm
[1:57:56] not doing that I won't do it I'll just
[1:57:58] find a way to go home and at that point
[1:58:00] I had no idea even where home was I was
[1:58:03] staying with this fella that I was
[1:58:05] actually standing up to now
[1:58:07] and it was strange
[1:58:09] because what happened was I stopped the
[1:58:11] party I stopped them from going and
[1:58:12] doing the rest of that and they just
[1:58:13] carried on in the pubs drinking and and
[1:58:16] I was just loathing it and I was
[1:58:18] drinking a Coke or something with them
[1:58:20] and and maybe it's too much information
[1:58:22] forgive me but I just want to bring a
[1:58:24] point with it and the point that I'm
[1:58:25] bringing is there was one man in the
[1:58:27] group the rest of them were sort of
[1:58:29] semi-respectful they never really had
[1:58:31] any harsh words they were bummed out
[1:58:33] because it didn't happen and and they
[1:58:35] kind of just cracked jokes a little bit
[1:58:36] about me being the spoil sport but this
[1:58:39] one guy there he wanted to argue he
[1:58:42] wanted to argue argue argue he wanted to
[1:58:44] say oh you're one of those guys and
[1:58:46] clearly he had seen the mistreatment
[1:58:48] somewhere along the way the
[1:58:49] misrepresentation of a believer of
[1:58:52] someone who claimed Christianity and how
[1:58:54] many people haven't seen that in their
[1:58:56] lives so I couldn't help but become
[1:58:58] sympathetic to this man and I knew that
[1:59:00] he was inebriated but we still he wanted
[1:59:02] to have this conversation so we we
[1:59:04] talked about it and we went in circles
[1:59:06] and talked about it and and God and what
[1:59:08] what's with this and all this and we
[1:59:10] talked about it and I won't bore you
[1:59:12] with it any more than I am already but
[1:59:14] the end of it was I had to say to him do
[1:59:16] you believe in the Bible to be the
[1:59:18] absolute do you believe it to be the
[1:59:21] word of God that he chose to give to the
[1:59:23] world to express himself in word form do
[1:59:26] you believe that and he said no I don't
[1:59:28] and I said well good we're done then
[1:59:29] carry on get him another drink you know
[1:59:33] there's nothing more to talk about
[1:59:35] at that point if you don't believe that
[1:59:37] to be the absolute story we can't talk
[1:59:39] there's no there's no equal ground here
[1:59:43] but he chose the word of God to be his
[1:59:46] expression to this world
[1:59:47] and it's got to be our absolute but when
[1:59:50] it's our absolute brothers and sisters
[1:59:52] when we make it our absolute something
[1:59:54] happens when we read it we know that in
[1:59:56] the Book of Revelation it says everyone
[1:59:57] who reads and hears the Prophecies of
[2:00:00] this book is blessed everyone
[2:00:03] doesn't matter whether you're a Believer
[2:00:04] or not but if you can read it and hear
[2:00:07] it something supernaturally happens
[2:00:09] that's why we come to church many times
[2:00:11] there's things that are said that aren't
[2:00:13] even in the preacher's notes and we
[2:00:15] don't even understand why why am I going
[2:00:16] off on this tangent I don't know it's
[2:00:18] the spirit of God the spirit of truth
[2:00:20] that's coming around Discerning a need
[2:00:22] in the heart of a believer
[2:00:26] but it's one God it's not as not a third
[2:00:29] person a second person or any other
[2:00:31] person besides God and and outside of
[2:00:34] that he says you're lost except you
[2:00:35] believe that I am here you'll die in
[2:00:37] your sins
[2:00:38] you know I just got thinking about this
[2:00:39] and and how God all that God was he
[2:00:41] poured into Christ and all that Christ
[2:00:43] was he poured into the church and and to
[2:00:46] think about it go back to the very
[2:00:47] beginning and think about how Adam in
[2:00:49] his position what that must have been
[2:00:51] like for him to be in his position now
[2:00:54] he is created in excuse me in God's Own
[2:00:57] image
[2:00:58] here he is in the garden and and and
[2:01:00] God's expressed him and there he is now
[2:01:02] he's looking around and it's interesting
[2:01:05] because God wanted all of the animals to
[2:01:07] be named
[2:01:09] and God didn't come and name the animals
[2:01:11] what did he do he used man he went
[2:01:14] through man and got man to express his
[2:01:17] will
[2:01:18] and man expressed it Adam named every
[2:01:20] single animal how did he do that how
[2:01:21] would he have the ability how would he
[2:01:23] have the knowledge can you think about
[2:01:24] every single animal every single
[2:01:26] organism on Earth that got that Adam
[2:01:28] named how would he do that except the
[2:01:31] mind of God
[2:01:32] but Adam here he is in the Garden of
[2:01:34] Eden and God saw that it was not good
[2:01:37] for him to be alone so he took a bride
[2:01:39] out of him right we know the story he he
[2:01:41] put him to sleep and and he took a rib
[2:01:43] from his side is what the word says and
[2:01:45] then he woke him up and suddenly he
[2:01:47] introduces him to this woman now can you
[2:01:49] imagine what this woman would be like
[2:01:51] and really the point that I want to get
[2:01:53] to with this story is how do you think
[2:01:56] Adam would have poured himself into his
[2:01:59] bride
[2:02:00] can you imagine being a Son of God not
[2:02:03] not born by flesh but all the knowledge
[2:02:06] that he had
[2:02:07] oh the sun's on you a little bit honey
[2:02:09] just move that sun over a little bit
[2:02:11] maybe just a couple more clouds over
[2:02:13] here oh it's a little bit a little bit
[2:02:14] cool we'll just have a little bit more
[2:02:16] heat maybe not more sun but just a
[2:02:18] little bit more heat maybe coming from
[2:02:20] that direction oh you're hungry honey
[2:02:21] okay well we'll just get some fruit here
[2:02:24] just a little bit of fruit right there
[2:02:25] on that tree I want fruit right there
[2:02:27] right now just the way that she's
[2:02:28] thinking about it you know how he would
[2:02:30] pour himself into his bride can you
[2:02:32] imagine that I hadn't thought about that
[2:02:34] until this morning and I just thought my
[2:02:36] goodness to think about that that's
[2:02:38] that's the heart's desire of a man and a
[2:02:41] woman you know we've talked about it in
[2:02:42] the past too how how when a man and a
[2:02:44] woman they start to court there's
[2:02:47] something in the heart of each one of
[2:02:48] them they just can't get enough of one
[2:02:50] another but sometimes we can get into
[2:02:52] our marriages and our marriages somehow
[2:02:55] the burdens of Life can get us to the
[2:02:57] place where things can just be
[2:02:58] complicated and we're like we just take
[2:03:00] it for granted that we're together
[2:03:03] but if we can just go back and think
[2:03:04] about the beginning think about what it
[2:03:06] was like way back there once upon a time
[2:03:08] there was some real common ground and
[2:03:10] and on that Common Ground there was
[2:03:12] something in the heart that just wanted
[2:03:14] to be with my bride she she was that one
[2:03:16] and I knew she was that one and I could
[2:03:18] not get enough of her and no doubt she
[2:03:20] would probably say the same
[2:03:22] but to think about how it must have been
[2:03:24] for Adam and Eve I can't even really
[2:03:25] comprehend what that would have been
[2:03:27] like but just thinking about how he
[2:03:29] would have expressed himself then we go
[2:03:31] on and we know that God he had the
[2:03:33] church called out of Egypt we talked
[2:03:35] about this in the past but I just want
[2:03:37] to try and go somewhere with it today
[2:03:38] hopefully Lord willing that God called
[2:03:40] Israel out and we know that the called
[2:03:42] out of bondage was the church brother
[2:03:45] Bradham said that was being called out
[2:03:47] in the church lived for hundreds and
[2:03:49] hundreds of years under the called out
[2:03:51] name of church they lived there and we
[2:03:55] know that God he eventually came in
[2:03:57] Jesus and came to personally pay that
[2:03:59] debt of sin for all of the called out
[2:04:02] all those people who had come year after
[2:04:05] year brother Bradham talks about it how
[2:04:07] they would come year after year with
[2:04:09] their sacrifice and no doubt the
[2:04:11] sacrifices that came the majority of
[2:04:13] them for the longest time were pure they
[2:04:15] were true they were holy they brought
[2:04:17] the best that they had to sacrifice for
[2:04:20] the Lord and you know what happened was
[2:04:21] it meant the need for that day and and
[2:04:24] that was all they left that sacrifice
[2:04:26] with the Satan desire but after the
[2:04:29] Revelation came and hit the heart of the
[2:04:31] Believers who Jesus Christ was they
[2:04:33] would get that sacrifice in their heart
[2:04:35] where they would want to dial to
[2:04:36] themselves because they recognized the
[2:04:37] sacrifice that he made
[2:04:39] and they would no longer have the
[2:04:40] desires
[2:04:42] he would take those desires away and
[2:04:44] that is such a major change in the
[2:04:47] dispensations and that's really what I
[2:04:48] wanted to talk about here with this now
[2:04:50] he changed to the dispensations of time
[2:04:53] the church came out from under bondage
[2:04:55] and that was a change Jesus came and
[2:04:57] that was a change he came and he came to
[2:05:00] sanctify All Mankind we read it in in
[2:05:03] John 17 verse 14. I've given them Thy
[2:05:06] Word
[2:05:08] he could have given them a complete
[2:05:10] deliverance
[2:05:11] could have gave them a great sword an
[2:05:12] army of angels that would have came and
[2:05:14] just got rid of the occupiers
[2:05:16] that would have just slayed pilate and
[2:05:18] and went after the emperor and just got
[2:05:21] rid of Rome completely could have
[2:05:23] snapped his fingers and had an
[2:05:24] earthquake and Rome would have just
[2:05:25] rattled right down into the ocean but he
[2:05:28] didn't do that did he they expected that
[2:05:31] they expected a mighty conqueror to come
[2:05:33] forward but they weren't recognizing
[2:05:34] what he actually was supposed to do in
[2:05:36] their day he says in verse 14 of John 17
[2:05:39] I've given them Thy Word
[2:05:42] and the world hath hated them
[2:05:44] because they are not of the world even
[2:05:46] as I am not of the world I pray not that
[2:05:49] thou shouldest take them out of the
[2:05:50] world but thou should keep keep them
[2:05:54] from the evil
[2:05:55] such a beautiful scripture there he's
[2:05:57] not going to Deliver us from our trials
[2:05:59] he's going to take us through our trials
[2:06:02] he's going to be that Fourth Man in the
[2:06:03] fire but we're going to have to step
[2:06:04] into the fire there's no way around that
[2:06:06] brothers and sisters
[2:06:08] he's going to express himself he's not
[2:06:10] going to take us out of the world he's
[2:06:12] just going to keep us from the evil
[2:06:14] he says they are not of the world verse
[2:06:16] 16 even as I am not of the world
[2:06:19] sanctify them through thy truth
[2:06:22] Thy word is truth
[2:06:26] so brothers and sisters here we are
[2:06:28] talking about the called out the church
[2:06:30] God called out his bride from his side
[2:06:34] on the cross we know that there's water
[2:06:36] blood and spirit first John 5 for there
[2:06:39] are three that bear record in heaven the
[2:06:41] Father the word and the Holy Ghost and
[2:06:44] these three are
[2:06:46] two
[2:06:48] right they're one
[2:06:51] there's no room for two in there is
[2:06:53] there
[2:06:54] these three are one
[2:06:57] we can't go outside of that
[2:06:59] and there are three that bear witness in
[2:07:01] the Earth
[2:07:02] Spirit and the water and the blood and
[2:07:04] these three agree in one
[2:07:09] and we talk about the spirit the water
[2:07:10] and the blood we're talking about us
[2:07:12] right there
[2:07:13] Spirit the water and the blood his
[2:07:15] spirit
[2:07:16] the water and the blood inside of us
[2:07:19] they agree in one we agree in one and
[2:07:22] again hundreds of years later his word
[2:07:24] is still in full force the prophecy God
[2:07:27] raises up a prophet in the wilderness of
[2:07:29] Revelations chapter 13 in the United
[2:07:31] States of America just at the opening of
[2:07:34] the seals he says I no longer call you
[2:07:35] church I call you bride why will I call
[2:07:37] your bride why am I doing that so that
[2:07:39] you'll understand so that you'll have a
[2:07:41] be the ability to comprehend with All
[2:07:43] Saints what the height and the length
[2:07:45] and the breadth of it is that you'll be
[2:07:47] able to be filled with all the fullness
[2:07:49] of God you you remember that scripture
[2:07:51] in Ephesians
[2:07:54] I believe it's in Ephesians let's turn
[2:07:55] over there for a second
[2:08:01] I just think it's so important brothers
[2:08:03] and sisters
[2:08:07] so important to recognize
[2:08:10] he didn't want us to just come here and
[2:08:12] and be ignorant he didn't want us to not
[2:08:15] understand these things
[2:08:17] the mystery Christ The Mystery of God
[2:08:19] revealed
[2:08:21] verse 16 of Ephesians chapter 3.
[2:08:28] we can actually read verse 15.
[2:08:32] of whom the whole family in Heaven and
[2:08:35] Earth is named
[2:08:36] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:08:37] before the foundation of the world verse
[2:08:39] 16 that he would Grant you
[2:08:41] according to the riches of his glory to
[2:08:45] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[2:08:47] in the Inner Man
[2:08:48] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[2:08:52] what
[2:08:53] by faith that ye being rooted and
[2:08:57] grounded in love
[2:08:59] we heard the prophet say that didn't he
[2:09:01] just love one another there's no more
[2:09:03] powerful force in the universe Than Love
[2:09:06] you've got to be rooted and grounded in
[2:09:08] love Verse 18 that you may be able to
[2:09:11] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[2:09:13] breadth and length and depth and height
[2:09:16] and to know the love of Christ which
[2:09:18] passeth knowledge
[2:09:20] that ye might be filled with all the
[2:09:25] fullness of God
[2:09:27] sometimes I feel like maybe we can
[2:09:29] preach this or or teach this or talk
[2:09:32] about this in such a way that we're only
[2:09:34] going to get a partial understanding
[2:09:36] that we're only going to get a harsh
[2:09:38] part of of God but the word of God says
[2:09:41] the fullness of God
[2:09:44] to dwell in us it's not something that
[2:09:47] we're we're just going to have a portion
[2:09:49] of maybe a little bit here and there
[2:09:52] I think it's beautiful
[2:09:56] so here we have God raising up a prophet
[2:09:59] telling us
[2:10:01] telling a certain group of people so
[2:10:03] that you'll understand so that you'll be
[2:10:04] able to comprehend with All Saints what
[2:10:07] is the length and the breadth and the
[2:10:09] depth and the height to be able to to
[2:10:11] understand with with an understanding
[2:10:14] that passeth all knowledge you're not
[2:10:16] going to be able to learn your way into
[2:10:17] this the only way you're going to be
[2:10:19] able to get there is by that quickening
[2:10:20] power of the Holy Spirit but when that
[2:10:23] comes into you brothers and sisters all
[2:10:25] of it will come into Plain View
[2:10:29] I just think it's like Revelations 19
[2:10:31] verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and
[2:10:33] give honor unto him for the marriage of
[2:10:35] the Lamb has come and his wife hath made
[2:10:38] herself ready
[2:10:39] isn't that wonderful to think that
[2:10:41] that's talking about a past tense she
[2:10:43] already hath made herself ready she
[2:10:45] isn't going to make herself ready she
[2:10:48] already half made herself ready just by
[2:10:50] accepting his word his truth
[2:10:52] understanding that I am the True Vine
[2:10:55] and the words that I speak are truth and
[2:10:58] he came to sanctify us so that we would
[2:11:00] be able to get this this revelation of
[2:11:03] who he is not just who he was but who he
[2:11:07] is and so you know we're talking about
[2:11:09] there being a change in in the age in
[2:11:12] the dispensation there was a change in
[2:11:15] the age from the laodicean age to the
[2:11:17] bride and brother Branham talks about
[2:11:19] how there's always an overlapping it's
[2:11:21] not a hard stop and a hard start between
[2:11:24] the ages there's always an overlap and
[2:11:26] you know he says it that we're building
[2:11:28] a house we're not building a wall
[2:11:30] they're building a wall for hundreds of
[2:11:32] years but then there came a time where
[2:11:34] there had to be someone that could
[2:11:36] interpret the blueprint and that person
[2:11:38] that was chosen to interpret the
[2:11:40] blueprint we never would have been able
[2:11:41] to interpret the blueprint on his own
[2:11:43] outside of the quickening power of the
[2:11:45] Holy Ghost in his life but that man
[2:11:47] William Miriam Branham was given that
[2:11:49] ability to interpret that blueprint to
[2:11:51] say hey guys wait a second we're not
[2:11:53] building that wall anymore that wall for
[2:11:55] hundreds of years has been built it's
[2:11:57] been it reinforced it's all there now
[2:12:00] we're turning a corner and I no longer
[2:12:02] call you church but I call you bride and
[2:12:04] many people will say well that was just
[2:12:05] a man that was just brother Branham and
[2:12:07] for some people it will always be that
[2:12:09] way but for other people they'll say
[2:12:11] that was God speaking to me it wasn't
[2:12:13] speaking to anyone else it was speaking
[2:12:15] to me to say I no longer call you church
[2:12:17] I call you bride but then there comes a
[2:12:19] place where we recognize brothers and
[2:12:21] sisters we go from being the bride we're
[2:12:23] not just the bride walking up the aisle
[2:12:25] in the wedding dress we become the wife
[2:12:27] where we have that intimate relationship
[2:12:29] with him the husband and when that
[2:12:32] happens there is a conception and that
[2:12:34] life that comes forward inside of us is
[2:12:37] Jesus Christ
[2:12:38] it is Jesus Christ and I believe Jesus
[2:12:41] Christ it becomes the revelation of
[2:12:43] Jesus Christ to this age brother Branham
[2:12:46] says it too that we are all that all the
[2:12:48] Jesus that this world is going to see
[2:12:51] the lives that we live right here
[2:12:53] right now
[2:12:56] I just can't help but think I talked
[2:12:58] about it on Wednesday I believe that how
[2:12:59] Esther she didn't she didn't intend she
[2:13:02] didn't she didn't just decide one day
[2:13:04] she's going to be the queen
[2:13:06] she was just going about her life doing
[2:13:08] her business
[2:13:09] in the story of Esther she she didn't
[2:13:12] know who she was she was just trying to
[2:13:13] make the best of it
[2:13:15] and we know that something happened
[2:13:18] and someone called her and said no no no
[2:13:20] no you need to come and why do you need
[2:13:23] to come
[2:13:24] so that the king can show you what he
[2:13:26] likes
[2:13:27] not so the king can slap you around with
[2:13:30] a three-sided club and say that I have
[2:13:32] dominion over you and unless you see it
[2:13:34] my way you're you're not seeing it at
[2:13:36] all no no no no no no he didn't bring
[2:13:38] her in there to to say that we're going
[2:13:40] to conform you and change you no he
[2:13:42] brought her in to show the Chamberlain
[2:13:44] needed to show her God's or his his
[2:13:47] servants the king's servants needed to
[2:13:49] show her how she needed to conduct
[2:13:52] herself and that's the same thing for us
[2:13:54] today brothers and sisters the Sons and
[2:13:55] Daughters of God we have been called to
[2:13:57] be his bride we have been chosen
[2:13:59] selected to come and stand before the
[2:14:01] king where it's not even allowed to
[2:14:03] happen without there being an invitation
[2:14:05] but you know John he was shown that open
[2:14:07] door in Revelations chapter 3 there was
[2:14:10] an open door it's Revelations chapter
[2:14:11] four that open door he was shown that
[2:14:13] Open Door told to come up a little
[2:14:15] higher the same invitation has happened
[2:14:17] to us brother and says we've been given
[2:14:19] that opportunity to come in where anyone
[2:14:22] else could never come but that gives us
[2:14:24] the ability to recognize our position
[2:14:25] through faith to recognize it
[2:14:29] you know the word true I can't believe
[2:14:32] it's almost over here
[2:14:35] let's just keep going just trust the
[2:14:37] Lord you okay still
[2:14:38] the word true and Strong's
[2:14:41] is uh G 228
[2:14:44] and it just means true
[2:14:46] just means honest it just means truth
[2:14:49] but it's interesting because the word
[2:14:51] true is used many times in in the word
[2:14:54] and and we know that Jesus said that I
[2:14:57] am the True Vine
[2:14:59] and and we know that it's the true word
[2:15:03] we read it in John 17 those verses it's
[2:15:07] the same word that's used in in
[2:15:09] Revelation that that he is faithful he
[2:15:12] who is faithful and true
[2:15:15] it's the same word
[2:15:17] and and I just can't help but think
[2:15:19] about Isaiah 43. let's turn to Isaiah 43
[2:15:22] quickly just talking about
[2:15:25] true sorry that Pulpit mic is still on
[2:15:28] Isaiah 43
[2:15:36] I I got into this and it's just like
[2:15:38] brother Branham talked about the the
[2:15:40] Bears getting into the tent with the
[2:15:42] honey
[2:15:42] or the Molasses depending on which one
[2:15:45] of those you read the most or whatever
[2:15:47] you compare it to
[2:15:49] you get into it and it's just it's so
[2:15:51] rich it's so sweet when you look at this
[2:15:54] because
[2:15:56] I just can't help but put myself there
[2:15:59] let's just start reading with uh verse 6
[2:16:01] of Isaiah chapter 43.
[2:16:05] it's a prophecy
[2:16:07] Prophet speaking here
[2:16:09] God speaking through a prophet I will
[2:16:11] say to the north give up and to the
[2:16:14] South keep not back bring my sons from
[2:16:17] far and my daughters from the ends of
[2:16:19] the Earth
[2:16:22] excuse me every one that is called by my
[2:16:25] name
[2:16:27] for I have created him for my glory I
[2:16:31] have formed him yea I have made him
[2:16:34] bring forth the blind people that have
[2:16:36] eyes and the deaf that have ears
[2:16:39] isn't that wonderful to think about
[2:16:41] there's people that are they're blind
[2:16:43] but they still have eyes and they're
[2:16:44] deaf but they have ears bring them forth
[2:16:47] verse 9 let all the nations be gathered
[2:16:49] together and let the people be assembled
[2:16:52] who among them can declare this and show
[2:16:55] us former things let them bring their
[2:16:57] witnesses that they may be justified or
[2:17:00] let them hear and say it is truth
[2:17:03] ye are my Witnesses saith the Lord and
[2:17:06] my servant whom I have chosen that ye
[2:17:09] may know and believe me and understand
[2:17:12] that I am he before me there was no God
[2:17:16] formed neither
[2:17:19] shall there be after me
[2:17:23] talking about the word truth and
[2:17:25] recognizing there's prophecy about this
[2:17:27] word truth I can't help but put myself
[2:17:30] in there and well I know that some would
[2:17:32] say but brother Barry that's that's
[2:17:33] talking about the children of Israel and
[2:17:35] it is but brother Bradham says that
[2:17:36] every scripture has a compound meaning
[2:17:38] and revelation
[2:17:40] everyone and I I just can't help but put
[2:17:43] myself in there and think that I had
[2:17:45] ears and I had eyes but I was blind and
[2:17:48] I was deaf and there's many people in
[2:17:50] this world that are and many people
[2:17:52] still are brothers and sisters but that
[2:17:53] doesn't mean that God won't actually use
[2:17:56] you to Quicken those ears and those eyes
[2:17:59] to be able to see the truth because how
[2:18:01] does birth happen
[2:18:03] comes through the body
[2:18:05] how does healing happen it comes through
[2:18:07] the body it always comes through the
[2:18:09] body it's not because we do anything
[2:18:11] special it's because we live our lives
[2:18:13] and you know I want to say this praise
[2:18:16] be to God Sister Mary Jeanette we have a
[2:18:19] man who is going to come to church on
[2:18:20] Wednesday night he wants to come to
[2:18:21] church every night but he can't he's in
[2:18:24] a position where he can but Sister Mary
[2:18:25] Jeanette witness to another person we
[2:18:27] got him baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:18:29] Jesus Christ he recognized that he
[2:18:31] needed to do that according to the word
[2:18:33] the true word for his day and because of
[2:18:36] that now he's coming to church he's
[2:18:38] going to come to church Wednesday night
[2:18:39] we're going to bring him here Eric McKay
[2:18:41] pray for Eric McKay he's had a very
[2:18:44] difficult life but God is not done with
[2:18:46] him yet
[2:18:47] he wants to come he had a position where
[2:18:50] he he had eyes but he was blind he had
[2:18:53] ears but he was deaf but somewhere along
[2:18:55] the way God said now this is the time
[2:18:57] appointed of the father it's time for
[2:18:59] his eyes to see and it's time for his
[2:19:01] ears to hear and how did that happen is
[2:19:03] because God chose to use the body to
[2:19:06] speak to him
[2:19:08] that's why I said when we come to Easter
[2:19:10] brothers and sisters think about the
[2:19:12] people in this city think about friends
[2:19:14] and family there could be someone that
[2:19:16] might be able to hear there might be
[2:19:18] able to someone that might be able to
[2:19:20] see this word that they never have
[2:19:23] anyway
[2:19:24] it's by truth
[2:19:26] the truth
[2:19:28] if we can hear the truth the truth shall
[2:19:30] make us free
[2:19:33] first John 2 but the anointing which ye
[2:19:36] have received of him abideth in you and
[2:19:39] and ye need not that any man teach you
[2:19:43] but as the same anointing teacheth you
[2:19:46] of all things and is truth
[2:19:49] and is no lie
[2:19:51] and even as it hath taught you
[2:19:54] ye shall abide in him
[2:19:57] talking about truth
[2:20:00] I am the True Vine
[2:20:02] how how Jesus when he prayed for his
[2:20:05] disciples
[2:20:07] over in John 17
[2:20:10] I sanctify them through Thy word Thy
[2:20:14] word is truth
[2:20:16] it's over in the next chapter isn't it
[2:20:18] John 18 or 19.
[2:20:22] it's 18 sorry
[2:20:24] Pilate gets a chance to have a
[2:20:27] conversation with Jesus
[2:20:29] the same one that just Sanctified them
[2:20:33] pilate entered and said this you can
[2:20:34] turn over there John 18 verse 33.
[2:20:38] might as well
[2:20:42] John 18 verse 33
[2:20:48] some people have eyes
[2:20:53] some people can see some people have
[2:20:55] eyes and they can't see
[2:20:58] pilate was here and he didn't have eyes
[2:21:00] to see he had eyes he could see Jesus
[2:21:02] standing before him but he couldn't see
[2:21:04] who he was he couldn't see the truth
[2:21:07] John 18 33
[2:21:09] says then pilate entered into the
[2:21:11] Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and
[2:21:13] said unto him Art Thou the king of the
[2:21:16] Jews
[2:21:17] Jesus answered him say sayeth thou this
[2:21:21] of thyself or did others tell tell it
[2:21:24] thee of me
[2:21:26] pilate answered am I a Jew thine own
[2:21:29] nation and the chief priests have
[2:21:32] delivered the unto me what has thou done
[2:21:36] Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this
[2:21:38] world
[2:21:39] if my kingdom were of this world then
[2:21:41] when my servants fight that I should not
[2:21:44] be delivered to the Jews but now is my
[2:21:48] kingdom not from hence
[2:21:51] pilate therefore said unto him art thou
[2:21:53] a king then
[2:21:54] Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a
[2:21:57] king
[2:21:58] to this end was I born and for this
[2:22:01] cause came I into the world that I
[2:22:03] should bear witness unto the truth
[2:22:06] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[2:22:10] voice
[2:22:14] pilate saith unto him
[2:22:16] what is truth
[2:22:18] and when he had said this he went out
[2:22:19] again unto the Jews and saith unto them
[2:22:21] I find no fault at all
[2:22:23] what is truth
[2:22:25] he had ears
[2:22:27] but he couldn't hear
[2:22:29] he had eyes he couldn't see the truth
[2:22:32] the word was standing right before him
[2:22:35] but he did not have that Revelation not
[2:22:38] everyone had that Revelation very few
[2:22:39] people even had that Revelation in that
[2:22:41] day and the same thing today brothers
[2:22:43] and sisters very few people have the
[2:22:45] revelation of the truth standing before
[2:22:47] them
[2:22:49] isn't it wonderful to think though there
[2:22:52] are some people
[2:22:53] there are some people
[2:22:55] I just can't help but think this is just
[2:22:56] like the parable of the story I hope
[2:22:58] we're okay we're still
[2:23:01] should I keep going or or should we just
[2:23:04] end it I don't want to keep you over
[2:23:06] time I know we're past 12.
[2:23:09] I can we can end I don't know
[2:23:12] I have lots
[2:23:14] boy oh boy
[2:23:16] I just can't help but think of the
[2:23:17] parable of the sower you know I don't
[2:23:19] want to hold anybody if you have to go
[2:23:20] by all means uh
[2:23:22] just feel free we'll just go and and see
[2:23:25] what the Lord will do here talking about
[2:23:27] the parable of the sower in Matthew 13
[2:23:28] I'll just go hear ye therefore the
[2:23:30] parable of the sower when anyone would
[2:23:33] Hearth the word of the kingdom and
[2:23:35] understandeth it not then cometh the
[2:23:37] wicked one and catch us away that which
[2:23:39] was sown in his heart this is he which
[2:23:43] received seed by the wayside but he that
[2:23:46] received the seed in the Stony places
[2:23:48] the same as he that heareth the word and
[2:23:51] Anon with joy receiveth it
[2:23:54] he says yet hath he not root in himself
[2:23:59] but dearth for a while for when
[2:24:01] tribulation or persecution ariseth
[2:24:03] because of the word
[2:24:05] by and by He Is offended
[2:24:08] someone steps on his toes somewhere
[2:24:10] along the way oh no you said too much
[2:24:13] you know what I am my father are one oh
[2:24:15] oh you're going too far we're all just
[2:24:17] Believers here we're all just Sinners
[2:24:18] safe by Grace we're all Sinners saved by
[2:24:20] grace for a purpose and that's to be his
[2:24:22] very bride the very elected not just be
[2:24:25] the nominal Christian someone's going to
[2:24:26] be the nominal Christian there's nothing
[2:24:28] wrong with that to be an eternal life to
[2:24:30] be saved on the other side is better
[2:24:32] than not actually being annihilated
[2:24:35] there's only one form of annihilation
[2:24:37] and that's the opposite of eternal life
[2:24:39] but you know brothers and sisters there
[2:24:41] is still a calling for the very elected
[2:24:43] bride of Jesus Christ and that's what
[2:24:45] we're talking about this morning that's
[2:24:46] who we're talking to here he says yet
[2:24:48] have he no root in himself but duress
[2:24:51] for a while for when tribulation or
[2:24:52] persecution arises because of the word
[2:24:55] by and by He Is offended
[2:24:59] whatever's in the seat is going to come
[2:25:01] forth when that rain falls on it right
[2:25:03] whatever's inside that seat is just
[2:25:05] going to come forth we can't help it we
[2:25:07] cannot stop it all we want to do is
[2:25:09] preach the word and allow the word to do
[2:25:12] the separating allow the word of God to
[2:25:14] come forward and water that seed
[2:25:17] he also that receive a seed among the
[2:25:19] Thorns is he that heareth the word and
[2:25:21] the care of this world and the
[2:25:23] deceitfulness of riches choke the word
[2:25:26] and he becometh unfruitful
[2:25:29] but he that receiveth seed in the good
[2:25:31] ground is he that heareth the word and
[2:25:33] understandeth it
[2:25:35] remember we read there in Ephesians his
[2:25:38] will is for us to comprehend his word
[2:25:40] for it not to be a great mystery that we
[2:25:43] don't understand some some some deep
[2:25:45] thing that we just don't get we can't
[2:25:46] really comprehend it and one day maybe
[2:25:48] we're going to get it he wants us to
[2:25:50] understand it he wants us to catch the
[2:25:51] revelation of the message of the hour
[2:25:53] that he's called out a bride of his own
[2:25:55] choosing out of Satan's eat and that's
[2:25:57] what he wants us to get he wants us to
[2:25:59] understand that brothers and sisters but
[2:26:01] he that receiveth a seed in the good
[2:26:02] ground is he that heareth the word and
[2:26:03] understandeth it which also beareth
[2:26:06] fruit
[2:26:08] and some bringeth forth and some and
[2:26:10] hundredfold and some 60 and some 30. we
[2:26:13] heard it said brother Toby preached on
[2:26:15] it there's talents God's given us
[2:26:16] talents and you know when we take our
[2:26:18] talents and we say Lord be it unto to to
[2:26:21] me according to Thy word I want to take
[2:26:23] this gift that you've given me I never
[2:26:25] got this gift I never developed this
[2:26:27] gift you gave it to me and I want to
[2:26:29] place it before you and I want to put it
[2:26:31] before you and I want you to anoint it
[2:26:33] because I want you to get the glory from
[2:26:35] it well we can take it and do that
[2:26:36] brothers and sisters he will come and he
[2:26:38] will Purge that bridge and that Branch
[2:26:40] will bring forth the fruit that he's
[2:26:42] talked about here in this scripture it
[2:26:44] might be a hundredfold it might be
[2:26:46] 60-fold it might be 30 fold and it might
[2:26:48] be just just a little bit but it's it's
[2:26:50] all that he's given us and we want to
[2:26:52] make sure that we are good that we can
[2:26:53] give a full accounting for it you know
[2:26:56] there's a chew in a false Vine
[2:26:57] we talked about this in the past Brother
[2:26:59] Brad or Jesus said in in John chapter 15
[2:27:03] here 15 1 he said that I am the True
[2:27:06] Vine out of the anointed ones at the end
[2:27:08] time these these trees the True Vine and
[2:27:10] the false Vine you've heard me preach on
[2:27:13] that since from years ago how they
[2:27:15] growed up together brought them in
[2:27:16] individuals and showed that from Cain
[2:27:19] and Abel the two vines that met in an
[2:27:21] altar both of them religious both of
[2:27:24] them anointed both of them Desiring life
[2:27:27] and worshiping the same God and one was
[2:27:29] rejected and the other received and the
[2:27:32] only way that the one was received could
[2:27:35] have done anything different from his
[2:27:37] brother it was revealed to him
[2:27:39] for the Bible said by faith Hebrews the
[2:27:42] 11th chapter by faith Abel offered unto
[2:27:44] God a more excellent sacrifice than that
[2:27:46] of Cain which God testified that he was
[2:27:49] righteous Jesus said the spiritual
[2:27:52] revelation of who he was who does man
[2:27:55] say that I the son of manam said Thou
[2:27:57] Art Thou Art the Christ son of the
[2:27:58] Living God blessed art thou Simon
[2:28:00] barjona for my Father in Heaven has
[2:28:02] revealed this unto you
[2:28:04] brother Adam says there's the True Vine
[2:28:07] again
[2:28:08] that's the one
[2:28:10] out of anointed ones he goes on to say I
[2:28:12] said there you are methodists will bring
[2:28:14] forth methodists every time Baptists
[2:28:17] will bring forth Baptists every time
[2:28:19] Catholic will bring forth Catholic every
[2:28:21] time and I want to say this message
[2:28:24] Believers will bring forth message
[2:28:26] Believers every time but the Church of
[2:28:29] the Living God brothers and sisters now
[2:28:31] that's a different level now forgive me
[2:28:33] for saying that but let's not make
[2:28:35] ourselves clicky and denominational and
[2:28:37] say that we're message Believers let's
[2:28:39] say that we're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:28:41] we're the ones that have ears to hear
[2:28:43] and eyes to see and a heart to receive
[2:28:45] that word that's come forward for us not
[2:28:48] just try and fit in and blend in
[2:28:52] otherwise we're going to be no different
[2:28:53] than these he says the Catholic will
[2:28:55] bring forth a Catholic every time but
[2:28:57] the Church of the Living God will
[2:28:58] produce Christ from The Roots the word
[2:29:01] every time if it ever puts forth another
[2:29:04] Vine of its own it will be Jesus Christ
[2:29:06] it won't be a church member church
[2:29:09] members will bring forth church members
[2:29:11] but we want to live a life so so sincere
[2:29:13] before the world around us that they see
[2:29:16] Jesus Christ don't we we don't want to
[2:29:18] live a life where we say I'm a good
[2:29:20] Christian I go to a message church and
[2:29:22] everything is just fine because that's
[2:29:23] what I do brothers and sisters it's good
[2:29:26] to do that but there has to be the
[2:29:28] dynamic power of Jesus Christ
[2:29:29] manifesting in our lives
[2:29:32] otherwise it's all in vain
[2:29:38] first John chapter 5 the spirit is truth
[2:29:41] brothers and sisters not our words
[2:29:43] not our Behavior the spirit that lives
[2:29:46] out through us is the truth
[2:29:50] first John 5 6 this is he that came by
[2:29:53] water and blood
[2:29:55] even Jesus Christ not by water only but
[2:29:57] by water and blood and it is the spirit
[2:30:00] that beareth witness because the spirit
[2:30:03] is truth
[2:30:05] we read this before earlier today for
[2:30:07] there are three that bear record in
[2:30:09] heaven the Father the word the Holy
[2:30:10] Ghost these three are one and there are
[2:30:12] three that bear witness and Earth the
[2:30:14] spirit and the water and the blood and
[2:30:16] these three agree in one
[2:30:19] not two just one
[2:30:21] and you know what we just want to see
[2:30:23] one we just want to see that one that
[2:30:24] was Seated on the throne and we don't
[2:30:26] want to see him in another dimension
[2:30:28] brothers and sisters even though one day
[2:30:29] we will because we'll be seated with him
[2:30:31] in his throne but if we are willing to
[2:30:33] look at him right now where we're at the
[2:30:35] Judgment seat of Christ where we're at
[2:30:37] examine our hearts with all of our
[2:30:39] hearts Have No Reservations in our lives
[2:30:41] then we will too be able to receive the
[2:30:44] baptism of the Holy Spirit if we're
[2:30:46] going to receive
[2:30:47] the the anointing of the church if we're
[2:30:50] going to come and be a good member and
[2:30:52] everything is going to be okay what will
[2:30:54] happen is we will fall under the
[2:30:55] anointing of the church everything will
[2:30:58] look good from the outside we might even
[2:31:00] be fruitful in our lives God might bless
[2:31:02] us with a good job and a bank account we
[2:31:04] we might have many manifestations of
[2:31:06] real good things in our lives but
[2:31:07] brother Branham says don't let Financial
[2:31:09] blessings actually be an indicator of
[2:31:12] God's blessing in your life because
[2:31:13] sometimes that can be a curse what we
[2:31:16] need to do is make sure that we take the
[2:31:18] word of God and make that our barometer
[2:31:20] and say am I following the word of God
[2:31:22] for my day because if I'm following the
[2:31:24] word of God for my day then I won't be
[2:31:26] led astray nothing will take me off my
[2:31:28] path
[2:31:30] it's only going to be his spirit that
[2:31:32] bears Witness
[2:31:34] I apologize if I've come off on message
[2:31:36] Believers I don't want to do that but I
[2:31:38] just want to make sure brothers and
[2:31:39] sisters that we're put in Christ first
[2:31:41] because that's what the message of the
[2:31:43] hour is the message of the hour is Jesus
[2:31:46] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:31:49] forever and not just in a church body
[2:31:51] but in our own lives he's got to be
[2:31:54] living out through us for the world
[2:31:56] around us to see
[2:31:58] and if that's not happening something's
[2:32:00] wrong
[2:32:02] maybe stand with me this morning I'll
[2:32:04] call the musicians I'll quit now
[2:32:07] his word in Matthew Chapter 5 it says be
[2:32:09] therefore perfect even as your father
[2:32:12] which is in heaven is perfect maybe
[2:32:15] we'll pick up from here down the road
[2:32:18] how are we ever going to do that
[2:32:20] brothers and sisters we'll never do it
[2:32:21] on our own there's no way that we will
[2:32:24] ever be perfect on our own
[2:32:29] the only way that we will be able to do
[2:32:31] it
[2:32:32] is through his Spirit living out through
[2:32:34] us
[2:32:36] thank you brother Emmanuel
[2:32:39] it's true I had the conversation on the
[2:32:40] way to church today and uh
[2:32:44] and I just forgot I'm sorry
