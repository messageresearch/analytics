[Music] [Music] God bless you God bless you everyone amen welcome to church thank the Lord for his goodness upon us I just want to share something quickly before we start I was looking at the book of Jeremiah and um in the first chapter there's a verse there that um struck me this morning Jeremiah 1:12 says in KJV then said the Lord unto me thou Hast well seen for I will hasten my word to perform it and in Amplified version it said then said the Lord to me you have seen well for I am alert and active watching over my word to perform it in this book Jeremiah had that called Jeremiah and Jeremiah was initially hesitant and then he saw a vision of an Almon tree and that Vision represents fruitfulness represents positive things and God reassured Jeremiah that he will be with him and he will guide him and I believe that that word is is instant God's word um to Jeremiah is the same thing he saying to us today says he alert and active watching over his word to perform it if we believe that I believe it can be our testimony please stand with me as we start the song service I sought the Lord and he answered me [Music] he'll never [Music] be you'll never be this PO man cry this PO man

sisters for the special amen so wonderful to set an atmosphere on a Wednesday night thank you brother faren for stepping in and each one that just brings of their sacred portion week after week it really makes a difference in Revelations 2: 18 we're carrying on in the thyrian church age and unto the angel of the church in th tyia write these things saith the Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first not with understanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of of their deeds and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works but unto you I say and unto the rest in thota as many as have not this Doctrine and which have not known the depths of sin Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden but that which ye already hold fast that which he have already hold fast till I come and he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to Shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the Morning Star he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for that ear to hear what the spirit saith unto the churches Lord and father if there's anybody that just doesn't have that ear tonight we pray that Lord you would give it to him and father sometimes our ears can get a little stopped up and father we pray that you would just clear out the channels for us Lord amen if they have become stopped up Lord if our experience has grown cold father we pray that you would light that fire one more time and Lord Jesus we will rise and we will trim our lamps father we thank you for the ear to hear what your spirit says to the churches we just commit the rest of this service into your hands all the words that are spoken all the thoughts that are thought our very hearts Lord we just commit them into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just uh couple of announcements quickly we have the Men's breakfast in Edmonton this weekend we're certainly excited for that um just to see the old friends and maybe make some new ones we have the 20th of October Youth Event after the service and uh for those who have not noticed I'm sure everyone probably has by now we just like to thank brother Joshua and brother Henry for their efforts and the assist by Brother John panicker God bless you Brothers we have a a new monitor at the back and it's a tremendous blessing for those who are up here to be able to just look back and not have to try and look down and fight with the lights they reflect off the the screen here so God bless you Brothers I really appreciate your efforts I'm sure we all do it's a wonderful thing to be in the service once again we're working on the tharan church age I don't think we're going to finish it tonight and I don't think there's any rush to do it but I think it's just a uh another portion of this incredible study of the exposition of the seven Church ages I'll just continue on where we left off last week um on paragraph 48 I Know Thy works and uh this is out of the thot tyan Church age the eulogy it's near the end of the eulogy I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the sorry this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor role of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased how tragic it was that in the Ephesian age love waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages but in this age in the darkest of all ages they served him even more yes I just want to turn over to Hebrews and read a scripture that just came to my heart as I was sitting in the back tonight the thyrian church age is during the Dark Ages and I believe the Bible speaks about what these people had to go through in Hebrews chapter 11 this is the chapter of faith and I just want to read maybe verse 35 of Hebrews chap 11 we'll start with verse 35 women received their dead race to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection speaking directly to what we're talking about about here verse 36 and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were saw aunder they were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith they reive not the promise why God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect that's the people that brother bram's talking about here in this book what a lesson that is he says there is no ceasing of this gracious service of Love unto the Lord but rather an increasing of it and here we have the prophet I believe giving us a nugget he says that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is increased service when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout the Victory and that's where we left off last Wednesday he goes on to say I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first now as we have already said this age is called called the Dark Ages because it was indeed the darkest period of all history and it wasn't just because people were killed and tortured it wasn't just because of what we read about there brother Ram gets into detail here he says it was the age of Pope Innocent III who claimed that he was the Vicor of Christ Supreme Sovereign over the church and the world who instit instituted the Inquisition which under his Direction shed more blood than at any other time except in the reformation and we know that this is history we can look this up and see this it's interesting that it's not talked about though it was the age of pornocracy the rule of Harlot sarius III had a mistress and filled the papal choir with paramor and bastard sons and turned the papal Palace into a den of robbers anastasius III was smothered to death by marosia who was mistress to sadarius John I 6 was marosia illegitimate son John the 7th was the Grand grandson of marosia and he violated widows and virgins and was killed while in the act of adultery by the woman's enraged husband now this is the the leadership behaving this way it was the age of papal Schism for two lines of popes one ruling from aagon and the other from Rome cursed and fought each other the popes were not only guilty of immoral sex acts fathering scores of illegitimate children committing sodomy Etc but were guilty of selling Priestly offices to the highest biders they boiled it down to an economic transaction terrible it was the age when the light glowed ever so faintly yet the few Believers labored more fervently as the darkness increased until toward the end of the age many arose attempting reforms their labors were so fervent that they paved the way for the oncoming Reformation therefore as the word says concerning that age your last End of the Age works are more than the first they were running a marathon and they still had some energy at the end the word thara has various meanings amongst which is continual Sacrifice by many this is believed to be a prophecy concerning the use of the mass which is continual presentation of the sacrifice of Christ that is an excellent thought but it might also mean the continual sacrifice in lives and labors of the True Believers of the Lord surely the tharan saints were the cream of the crop full of the Holy Ghost in faith created unto good works showing forth his praise holding not their lives dear unto themselves but gladly giving all as a Sweet Sacrifice unto the Lord boy I think when we get a little bit down sometimes in our lives it might do us some good just to think about what these people had to go through our brother and sisters so that the cause of Christ could still go on the rebuke out of Revelations 2:20 not withstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest tolerate that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetes to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to Idols now with this verse I want you tow drop down to verse 23 and see the proof of a great truth I have been bringing to your attention all along Revelations 2:23 and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts you see we can try and hide all we want even the pious popes and those people who have the false religions can try and hide all they want but we know the spirit searcheth the Reigns of the hearts we can't hide that I have been saying right along that there are actually two churches though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age isn't that wonderful the spirit speaks to both of them nobody will be without excuse as though they were but one here it is plainly stated that there are churches and that it states just as plainly that some of those churches most evidently do not know that he is the one who searcheth the Reigns and the hearts he is going to prove to them that this is so now then what churches will be those that do not know this truth of course it is the false Vine group because the True Believer certainly know that judgment begins at the house of God that's where brothers and sisters when we hear the word coming forth we're not saying my that's a good service but I know I'm good it's where we say Lord how does that apply to me in my life how does it apply to me in my heart I heard something epic and I'm going to repeat it probably many times going forwards for me I thought it was epic you know the the soul the difference between the soul and the spirit the soul is who we are the soul we can't change the soul is what's Eternal the spirit is what we think we are the spirit is what we think we are the spirit is who we think we are but the soul can't be changed the soul is exactly who we are and when people die there's that separation between Body Soul and Spirit the soul and the spirit start to pull apart from each other but you know there's only one thing that can divide the soul and the spirit and we know that that's the word of God Amen the word of God is what separates our personalities from our souls I thought that was so good and I'm probably going to bring a little bit of a study on that in the future here but it's just a wonderful thing to know that he is looking at us he knows exactly who we are and judgment does begin at the house of God and you know but I know brother brandham says it it's got to start from the pulpit and it's got to go all the way through to the janitor it's got to go from the top to the bottom from the bottom to the top through every single heart mind and soul in the church and when it does watch out because we're going to see a Revival amen he goes on to say and they being God-fearing judge themselves that they be not judged now why does God call these churches his churches even though they are the false Vine the truth of the matter is that they are Christians are they amen that's what he says here the truth of it is that they are Christians but they are not Christians of the spirit my they are Christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain Mark 7:7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be a Muhammad hamadan is a muhammadan that is his religion no matter how he lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the Quran teaches in the same way a Christian is a Christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the son of God born to a virgin was crucified and died and rose again that he is the savior of mankind Etc in fact in the leodan age there will be those who call themselves Christians because they subscribe to the Fine qualities of Jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity and I think it's beautiful when we read read this when we study this I think it's so good to just pause and zoom out and remember that we look at it through the lens of progressive revelation because we're not just looking at it as Jesus Christ he came he he was born he he was crucified he died he rose again that's that's mainstream Christianity as Believers of this word we know that his spirit is still here on Earth but where is it it's in the true church it's in those that are able to say Amen to his word amen Christian Scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel we just make it comfortable for everyone God loves all of us and he does he would that all would come to repentance wouldn't he he is a nominal Christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer that kind of a Believer is one who has been baptized in the body of Christ and is a member of him amen but nonetheless it is in God's order that the tears grow up with the wheat and they are not to be uprooted that is the command of God their day for binding and burning is coming but is not yet but I'll say from this when this book was being authored and published that is actually taking place now we are all coming to the place where you look around the world stand up and be counted unless you're willing to subscribe to a certain belief structure the social justice machine will come our way and expose us for not actually being chosen one side or the other but I think it's just beautiful because we know we know that there will be a day where there will be a short powerful demonstration of the Holy Spirit hallu carrying on paragraph 57 here he says so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group on the one hand he's praising and on the other he's rebuking he has told what is right to the True Believer now he warns what the false Vine must do if it is to stand Justified before the Lord just makes me think of that story where brother Bram talked about it where someone said you know I was sitting in service and alls I heard was that I'm an eagle I'm an eagle I'm an eagle and someone else they said man all she said was I was a buzzard or or a crow I can't remember what the what the bird was but just makes me think of that yes so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group on the one hand he's praising on the other he's rebuking he has told what is right with the truth True Believer and he warns what the false Vine must do if it is to stand Justified before the Lord and isn't that beautiful out of our scripture Amen to know that he knows what's going on in in the life of the people there the ones that actually sufferest that woman Jezebel which called herself a prophetess he says I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not even even the one who was so terrible who was leading everyone astray we know the story of Jezebel I probably should get into it maybe next week we will um talk a little bit about Jezebel how she came and actually caused Israel to sin only because Ahab married her because of his Allegiance with her because he chose to marry her he brought the whole country into sin but here in this scripture two times he mentions giving her giving them a space to repent but they didn't what a loving God we serve James 1:14 and 15 that woman Jezebel but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed and when lust hath conceived how does it conceive in the mind when we get that Temptation and it comes our way I'm we don't say get lost when we see that woman on the street and we don't look away it's conceived in our mind when it goes that next step that's the conception it bringeth forth sin because we know to do wrong is sin when we know better to do wrong is actually sin and sin when it's finished bringeth forth death the trick of the devil is to say to us well you sure won't die you're not going to die if you eat of that fruit my goodness you're not going to get struck by lightning when you step off that curd and W curb and walk across the street no but we're not talking about physical death this is not speaking of physical death this is talking about spiritual death total separation from the Lord the Apostle James showed us the chor that sin takes now that is a picture of exactly what is happening in the church ages as Sin started in nothing but a feeling so the death to the church started with the simple little noticed Deeds from the nicians from the Deeds it went to a Doctrine from the doctrine it embraced the power of the state and the introduction of paganism now in this age it goes to its own prophetess teacher and so it travels on until it will find itself in the Lake of Fire for that is exactly where it is going to end up in the second death now the whole Cry Of God against this fourth age is found in his denunciation of this propheus Jezebel and to understand exactly why he denounces her so we will have to look her up in history in the Bible and when we find what she did back there we will know what is going on at this time the first and very important thing that we learn about Jezebel is that she is not a daughter of Abraham nor is her induction into the tribes of Israel one of spiritual admission as was that of Ruth the moabitas no sir this this woman was the daughter of ethal king of sidon First Kings 16:31 who was the priest unto estarte he had gained the throne by murdering his predecessor philis so we see right away that she was the daughter of a murderer and we know that this manifested in the vineyard of naboth and the prophecy about how God's word is going to come to pass in ahab's life and so on but she was the daughter of a murderer this certainly reminds us of Cain and the way she became a part of Israel was not through the spiritual channels that God had ordained for Gentile admission but she came in by marriage to Ahab the king of the 10 tribes of Israel now this Union as we have seen was not spiritual it was political and so this woman who is steeped in idolatry did not have the least desire to become a worshipper of the one true God but rather she came in with the avowed intentions of turning Israel away from the Lord and it's interesting because I just can't help but think perhaps I don't know for sure but perhaps she didn't even intend for that to happen her intentions may not have been to try and defile Israel although they might have been sometimes when we're under the influence of a spirit our intentions are the best but that Spirit that's inside of us is going to live out through us and cause us to behave certain ways that maybe we don't even understand maybe we can't even explain that's why we need the Holy Spirit In Our Lives now Israel the 10 tribes had already known what it was to worship the golden calves but as yet they were not sold out to idolatry for God was worshiped and the law of Moses was acknowledged I just my I just get inspired I just can't help but think about our lesson on Sunday talking about how they feared the Lord but they served their gods they feared the Lord but they still had their Groves and their high places their traditions and their ways but they feared the Lord but from the time of ahab's marriage to Jezebel idolatry progressed in a deadly fashion it was when this woman became a priestess in the temples that she erected to estarte Venus and bael Sun God that Israel came to the crisis point of her life with this in mind we can now begin to see what the spirit of God is setting forth in this thot tyrian age here it is Ahab married Jezebel and he did it as a political maneuver to strengthen his kingdom and secure it that is exactly what the church did when it Mar married under Constantine they both got together for political reasons though they put a spiritual air to it why now no one can convince me that Constantine was a Christian he was a pagan with what looked like Christian trappings he painted white crosses on his soldiers Shields he was the originator of the Knights of Columbus he put a cross on the steeple of St Sophia's thereby starting a tradition it was Constantine's idea to get everyone together the pagans nominal Christians and true Christians and for a while it looked as if he would succeed for the real Believers came along to see if they could bring back the ones that had drifted away from the word when they saw that they couldn't bring them back into the truth they were forced to break away from the body political then when they did they were called Heretics and persecuted my this next paragraph let me say right here that we have the very same thing going on right now the people are all coming together they are writing a Bible that will suit everyone whether it be a Jew Catholic or Protestant and I just can't help but think it's a probably a good time to mention they already have the abrahamic house if anybody doesn't know what that is maybe try and look it up the abrahamic house I think it might be in Saudi does anybody know where that is it's it's a temple that's built and it's built for the Jews it's built for the Christians and it's built for the uh muhammadans it's built for the uh islamics so we can have a one world religion and it's actually a functioning church and there's more of them coming up all around the world because it's supposed to happen the prophet said it there's no way around it let me say right here that we have the very same thing going on right now this was 60 years ago wasn't it the people are all coming together they were writing a Bible that will suit everyone whether it be a Jew Catholic or Protestant they have their own n seeeing Council but they call it the ecumenical council and do you know whom all these organizations fight they fight the true Pentecostals I don't mean the organization called Pentecostal I mean the ones who are Pentecostal because they are filled with the Holy Ghost and have the signs and Gifts in their midst because they walk in truth when Ahab married Jezebel for political reasons he sold his Birthright you join up with an organization and you sell your Birthright brother whether you want to believe it or not every protest group that ever came out and then went back sold their Birthright and when you sell your Birthright you're just like Esau my you can cry and repent all you want but it won't do you any good there's only one thing you can do and that is come out of her my people and stop partaking of her sins cuz if we can still hear that word those words if we can still hear the word of God then he's giving everyone a space to repent we're getting that space to repent now if you don't think I am right just answer this one question can any man living tell me what church or what move of God ever had a Revival and came back after she went into organization a and became a denomination read your histories you can't find one not even one and I I know for sure it doesn't take a lot to look back and see when when did the pants come in I know it's a touchy subject not so much around Believers but when did the pants come in when did it become fine for women to begin wearing garments that pertain to a man it changed somewhere along the way something caused that change and it wasn't very long ago that women all wore dresses in fact I was I was chuckling one time we were up at Bass proo and they've got pictures all over the store for those people that don't know it's an outdoor store but there's actually pictures in there of women climbing mountains to the top of the mountains wearing long dresses and and the boots that they wore in those days like fullon dresses climbing a mountain you wouldn't hear of that now people would say that it's unsafe there's no way that you could do it there' be all manner of excuses but you know it wasn't very long ago that women actually didn't wear garments that pertain to a man how how did it happen it's the change of of life you can look at the you're wondering how I'm getting into this I I I grew up in the penny costal Realms and uh I remember vividly seeing I've probably said it many times a woman uh speaking in tongues and she was a little woman she was elderly but she was in high heels and had short hair and earrings and a tight short mini skirt and boy could she ever speak in tongues and prophesy and is that the spirit of God it doesn't line up with the word but to take a look at that was probably 40 years ago 45 years ago where's the church today what's the condition you know brother randam said I just find it amazing because brother gram said it if you want to see where a church is at just take a look at the women right amen and I I think back to that and I think my where's that church today he says read your histories you can't find one not even one it was the Midnight Hour for Israel when she joined with the world and left the spiritual for the political it was the Midnight Hour at niia when the church did the same thing it is the Midnight Hour now that the churches are coming together now when Ahab married Jezebel he allowed her to take the state money and erect two huge houses of worship to estarte and Baal the one was erected for Baal was big enough for all Israel to come and worship there at and when Constantine and the church married he gave the church buildings and set up altars and images and organized the hierarchy that had already been shaping up when Jezebel got the power of the state behind her she forced her religion on the people and killed the prophets and Priests of God it got so bad that Elijah the messenger to his day thought he was the only one left but God had 7,000 more that hadn't bowed the KNE knee to Baal and right now out there amongst those denominations of Baptist method IST Presbyterians Etc there are some that will come out and come back to God I want you to know I am not I am not now and never have been against the people it is the denomination the system of organization that I am against I have to be against it amen for God hates it my that's beautiful I think he says it so well if people could just listen to what he said now just let us stop a minute here and rehearse what we brought out about the worship in thota I said that they worshiped Apollo who was the son God along with the emperor now this Apollo was called the averter of evil he turned evil away from the people he blessed them and was real God to them he was supposed to teach the people he explained about worship and Temple rights services to Gods about sacrifices and death and life after death the way he did this was through a propheus who sat entranced Upon A tripad tripod chair Ma and we know that she was called the Oracle do you see it here is that prophetess called Jezebel and she is teaching the people and her teaching is seducing the Servants of God and causing them to commit fornication now fornication means idol worship that is what its spiritual meaning is it is an illegal union ahab's union and Constantine's Union were both illegal both committed spiritual fornication every fornicator will wind up in the Lake of Fire God said so now then the teaching of the Catholic church the church is female it is a woman denies the word of God the pope who is literally Apollo in a modern version has taught the people to join themselves to Idols the ROM sorry the Roman Church has now become a false prophetess to the people because she has taken away the word of the Lord from the people and given her own ideas as to what constitutes forgiveness of sins what brings the blessings of God and the priests have gone so far as to State categorically that they have power not only in life but in death amen and I would have to say I agree with that because if people are following them and not following the word of God from a Vindicated Prophet then they surely do have the power over life and death because they will take people to the second death why they teach on their own that there is a Purgatory but you can't find that in the word they teach that prayers and masses and money will get you out of purgatory and into heaven works right the whole system that is based upon its teaching is false it does not lie in the sure foundation of the revelation of God in his word but lies on the shifting sinking Sands of its own diabolical untruths the church went right from organization to denomination and hence to false teaching that's right the Roman Catholics don't believe that God is in his word no no sir if they did they would have to repent and back up but they say God is in his church that would make the Bible the history of the Catholic church that isn't so look what they did to water baptism alone they took it away from being Christian baptism and make it made it a pagan one of titles it was the Catholic church that did that let me tell you what an experience I had with a Catholic priest a girl that I had baptized at one time turned Catholic so the priest wanted to interview me about her he asked what kind of baptism she had I told him I baptized her in Christian baptism which is the only kind there was to my knowledge I had buried her in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the priest remarked to me that at one time the Catholic Church did that right away I asked him when the Catholic Church did that for I have read the histories and I could not find what he said he told me that it was found in the Bible and that Jesus had organized the Catholic church I asked him if he thought Peter was really the first pope he emphatically said that Peter was I asked him if the masses were said in Latin in order to ensure that they were correct and would never change he said that was true I told him that I thought they had wandered a long way from what they had in the beginning I let him know that if the Catholic Church really believed the book of Acts then I was an old-fashioned Catholic he told me that the Bible was the record of the Catholic church and that God was in the church I disagreed with him for God is in his word let God be true and every man a liar if you take away or add to that book God has promised that he will add plagues to those who add and take away their part from The Book of Life if they dare subtract ract it from Revelations 228 and 19 let me just show how the Roman Catholic Church believes that God is in the church instead of the word here is an excerpt from the Diary of Pope John uh I don't know what that is my experience during these three years as Pope since in fear and trembling I accepted this service in pure pure obedience to the Lord's will conveyed to me through the sacred College of cardinals in conclave Bears witness to this maximum and is a moving and Lasting reason for me to be true to it absolute trust in God in all that concerns the present and perfect Tranquility as regards the future this Pope states that God spoke through the church revealing his will how false now if you don't have ears to hear what the spirit says to the church that would sound like someone very religious but to be able to pick it out that he got it through the sacred College of cardinals in conclave how false brother bradam says God is in his word and speaks by the word revealing his will he also stated that he placed absolute trust in the word of men and thereby obeyed it with Tranquility why it sounds so beautiful but it is so false just like the perversion in the Garden of Eden one word off and boy we can find ourselves in a bad place now let us get get over here in Revelation 17 and see this woman the church who is living on false prophecies and not the word of God in verse one God calls her the great why is she a because she's in idolatry supposed to be married to Christ but doing something else on the side she has caught the people up into the same thing what's the cure for idolatry the word of God Amen it's not complicated brothers and sisters it's just the word so this woman is a because she has left the word there she is sitting upon many Waters which means multitudes of people this surely has to be the false church because the Church of God is small few there be that find it Matthew 7:14 notice what she is like in the eyes of God no matter how wonderful she looks to people and how philosophical she sounds she is filthy drunk on her fornications now she was drunk with the blood of the martyrs just like Jezebel who killed the prophets and Priests and destroyed the people of God Who Would Not Bow Down and Worship Baal and that is exactly what the Catholic Church did they killed those who would not bow down to the popish rule those who wanted the word of God instead of the words of men were put to death usually by cruel methods but this church that dealt in death was dead itself and didn't know it excuse me there was no life in her and no signs ever followed her isn't it amazing I'll probably stop there tonight and call the musicians isn't it amazing that those people who renounced the church and state union that fornication and they said no no no I'll believe the word of God before I actually believe this fornication stuff they were given the opportunity to Simply renounce all they had to do was renounce and say I'll put the word of God aside I'll save my hide and sacrifice the word and they would be allowed to live they'd be permitted to live but there was something in inside of them there was another Spirit there wasn't there just a tremendous thing and and we have that same Spirit tonight God bless you Brothers and Sisters Let's just close in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your
