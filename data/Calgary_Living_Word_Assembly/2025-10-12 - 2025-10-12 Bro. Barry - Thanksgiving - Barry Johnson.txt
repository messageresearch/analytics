He said he's going to send rainbow to remind us every time we see rainbow. That is the God that we serve. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads for prayer. Our precious heavenly father, covenant keeping God. You never change what you said. But we change &gt;&gt; when you haven't done it. We don't have faith. We don't have patience to wait upon you. But whatever you said you would do, you always do it. &gt;&gt; We want to thank you. That gives us an assurance that we are serving a living God. &gt;&gt; Father, this morning we are in your presence again. We've come from all walks of life. We've come with all manners of thanksgiving to give to you this morning. We've also come with all manners of situations, whether good or bad, to come and bring it to you this morning. And it is my prayer that this morning, Father, you move from person to person this morning. You move from pew to pew this morning, Lord. Those that came with thanksgiving, would you receive it this morning? Those that came to ask you to do something for them, would you do it for them this morning? Father, we want to thank you once again, Lord, that this morning we've been able to drive from our homes to come into your house to have a fellowship with you this morning. I pray that Lord Jesus this morning, you come to speak to us individually. Come talk to us according to our needs and according to our faith. This morning once again, our pastor has liberted to bring your word. Lord, may that word that you have given to him find a resting place in our souls, in our hearts this morning. Father, this morning we want to commit each and everyone that is not even here this morning into your hands. &gt;&gt; Those that have traveled, Father, may you be with them. May you grant them travel mercy when they are going and may you bring them back when they are coming. &gt;&gt; When we all come together, we shall be careful to give you thanks. Father, this morning we are also bringing our tithes and offering to your house. We ask you to bless it, sanctify it for in Jesus name that this morning we pray. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing we for uh sorry above all powers number 1094. Above all powers, above all kings, above all nature and all created things. of all wisdom and all the ways of man. You were here before the world began. Crucified [Music] behind the storm. We live to die. rejected and alone like a rose trampled on the ground. [Applause] You took my fall and thought of me. My home above all king, above all, [Music] above all, the world is the approach. [Music] My treasures are the way to [Music] cross. Maybe I sle. [Music] All the ground [Music] crucified for you. [Music] You live down rejected alone by the cross. Travel on the ground. You touch when you thought of me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anybody take your seats? We have two s uh two specials today. Brother Don can come up as we just sing that uh chorus once again. And then sister Michelle's going to sing as well. So as we just sing this verse, brother Don can come up. You were crucified. Oh, laid behind the storm. You lay to die. Rejected and low like a rose trembled on the ground. [Applause] You took my and you thought of me. Amen. Lord bless you all this morning. Since it's Thanksgiving weekend, it's I just started thinking about all the things that I'm thankful for. And it all boiled down to one main thing. I'm so thankful for be born again and the gift of the Holy Ghost. This is called When the Lord Takes His Place. I was sitting at the table with my Bible open wide. Life was full of motions, but no real peace inside. Then the still small voice came softly said, "Son, it's time to see. I can't be Lord of all till I'm Lord inside of thee." It wasn't in the thunder, nor a far off mountain flame, but in a whispered moment the Savior called my name. He said, "I've walked beside you amidst the storms and witnessed your best, but I can only move through hands and hearts that give me rest." &gt;&gt; Amen. So I bowed my head in reverence, laid my burdens at his feet, and I told him, "Take the whole thing, Lord. My heart, my work, &gt;&gt; my seat." &gt;&gt; Then he turned the smallest action, disobedience in prayer into peace that filled my spirit like fresh heaven in the air. I thought of brother Brham in that canyon, calm and still. When the voice said, "Pick up a rock, son, and cast it where I will." He didn't question reasons. He didn't argue. He didn't doubt. He tossed that little stone. And God himself broke out. The skies rolled back in glory. The judge descended near. A ring of holy cloud appeared. And the devil stood in fear. I learned right there the secret. What true face meant to be. When a man moves by God's own leading he parts the sea for thee. It ain't in mighty thunderings nor shouting loud and strong. It's in the quiet yielding where our will no more belongs. For every promise written, he's waiting on our yes. One step in faith from mortal man brings heaven's righteousness. I see him in the morning when my job comes into view. And each moment and decision he's revealing what to do. For when a heart turns heavenward and gives him room to reign, the simple acts of daily life shine forth like golden green. Shortly when he comes in glory in that great eternal light, I know I'll know him by his presence that already ruled my night. For the Lord took his position, not afar, but close and near, when no man obeyed the whisper, and the word was made clear. Or bless you all. [Applause] God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Singing, but I just want to praise the Lord this morning with a very thankful heart for all his blessings and for all he's done for us. You feel free to join in. [Music] [Music] You are the and we worship you, oh Lord. You are worthy to be praised. You are the alpha and we worship you, oh Lord. You are worthy to be praised. We give you all the glory.

[Applause] Singing, "Holy, holy, holy are you, Lord. Holy elders and angels found the redeemer worship you now. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Amen. As we ask brother Barry to come forward. Let's sing that again. Singing holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Oh sing. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Holy elders and angels. All the redeemed we worship you now. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Let's see him one more time. Oh, singing holy, holy, holy are you. [Music] Oh, sing. Holy, holy, holy are you. We are the redee. We worship you now. Holy, holy, holy Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. Welcome to the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Certainly an honor and a privilege to gather together one more time in his name. &gt;&gt; The way that he's ordained for this age, &gt;&gt; the age in which we live. We just have one request this morning that we'd like to bring before the throne and that is for the hostages that are in Nigeria. There's trickles of information that are coming and I'm sure it's not enough for the families and those people affected, but we certainly stand with them and we trust the Lord is in control. &gt;&gt; Just want to remember them today in prayer and all the people affected by it as well. If you have a need this morning, maybe just make it known unto him by the way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, this morning, we thank you, Lord, for all that you've done for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord Jesus, for all that you're going to do. We know that there's many promises that still lie in store for us, Lord, and we thank you for them. &gt;&gt; But Lord Jesus, we thank you for what you're doing right now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even in this service, Lord Jesus, in our lives, Father, in our homes, &gt;&gt; we know that you're in complete control. And we thank you for that, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, this morning, we just want to ask, Lord, that we could continue to thank you for delivering those folks who are held captive, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; by those people in Nigeria. We know that you said yourself that Lord Jesus, you will set the captives free. &gt;&gt; That you will truly deliver those who are in bondage. &gt;&gt; And Father, we just want to thank you now. We've asked you before and we just want to thank you now. We want to confess, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; the full complete deliverance of these people. &gt;&gt; And Lord, the one thing that we do desire isn't retribution. We desire that the people who have done this, Lord, could perhaps come to know you in the power of your resurrection through this, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we just know that the the believers are always persecuted in every single age. It's no different today. But Lord, we know that you are greater than any persecutor could ever be on this earth. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, Lord Jesus. It's it's a spiritual battle and we know that you've already won it and we declare that in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And father this morning we just want to ask Lord that you would minister to each and every need that was made known unto you &gt;&gt; by the way of an uplift hand. Father &gt;&gt; we know that you're more than able to meet the needs in the hearts of your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever the need is, whatever the circumstance, whatever the situation, you are our tower of refuge, Lord. And &gt;&gt; Father, we know that you're more than able to deliver us from evil. You're able to bind up the brokenhearted, Lord. There's nothing too great for you. We just commit the needs into your hands now for your glory, Lord. And as we turn our eyes to your word, Father, we just pray that you would break it fresh to us once again, Lord. We love you, Father, and we thank you for your goodness to us, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, musicians. God bless you this morning. If you have your Bibles, I would just like to read a couple scriptures out of Exodus chapter 12. Amen. &gt;&gt; Might sound like a strange scripture for a Thanksgiving service, but I believe we have lots to be thankful for in the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Exodus 12 verse 12. &gt;&gt; Amen. says, "For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, and against all the gods of Egypt. And I will execute judgment. I am the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you. &gt;&gt; And the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you. And when I smite when I smite the land of Egypt, sorry. And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations. Ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that &gt;&gt; it's not just a word for the land of Egypt and the children of Israel, but it's very much applicable for us in the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; And Father, we pray that you would just help us, Lord, by your word to by your spirit, Father, to take this word and bring it to life once again, Father. &gt;&gt; That it would be by your spirit &gt;&gt; that we're gathered together. &gt;&gt; We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. You may be seated. Certainly like to welcome all of our visitors. Brother Bon Bonav Benu and family. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Did I say that right? &gt;&gt; God bless you. I apologize. &gt;&gt; And uh Sister Haley's parents are with us again. God richly bless you. Certainly thankful that you're with us. It's amazing how uh how it works. It seems the many people in the church go away for a holiday and uh come to church thinking I wonder how many people are going to be there and you can see the church is almost you know full again. It's amazing how the Lord does things. &gt;&gt; Are you happy today? &gt;&gt; Today we uh we just want to get into talking about a little bit of thanksgiving. It's a Thanksgiving weekend and we have a lot to be thanks thank thankful for during this season I believe. And uh I just was looking at this and you know I trust it's okay that we could look at it from the perspective of Exodus 12. I know this is the the Passover meal and we know this is actually a type of the communion and I don't want to go that far with it to try and make the two the same because they're not. But I think there's something interesting in our scripture here that I just felt led to to get into a little bit, you know, and uh you know, looking at the very first scripture that we read in in Exodus 12, I will pass through the land of Egypt this night. This is truly the Lord Jesus speaking. This isn't just uh another angel. It's not some other third person or second person of of a holy trinity. It it's not just a messenger. This is actually God himself. I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite the firstborn. And we know that this this is actually the destroyer. It's been called the destroyer angel. And you know, anybody that receives the word of God has no fear of this angel. Anybody that applied the word in in the way it was given in the way they lived in that day. Anybody who just accepted the word of the prophet the way the prophet gave it to them without interpreting it and saying that I've got something that I need to try and mingle with it my own way. Those ones had no fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't have to worry because they came under the blood. And I think it's beautiful how the next scripture it says, "And the blood shall be to you a token." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a token to him. It was given as a token to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were given something that they could actually stake their salvation on. They were given something that they could stake their security on. &gt;&gt; And it was following the word of the v already now vindicated prophet in the day in which they lived, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; They saw all the plagues that happened when Moses first came back. They said, "Who are you? And where do you come from? We know you. You're a murderer. You're a traitor. Your parents threw you away. Instead of giving you to the crocodiles like all the rest of us, we had to give away our firstborn. All of our children were given to the crocodiles. But you, you're a special boy. You were actually saved for some reason. And now you go and murder someone and run away and hide and come back and think you're going to find favor with us. Can you imagine the amount of of stigma that must have been in that man's life? All those meal time conversations, the families talking about this guy coming back saying, "Thus sayaith the Lord." He He sent me here to actually bring you out. &gt;&gt; I know I might have been a little bit of a skeptic &gt;&gt; based on everything I heard. But it doesn't change the fact that God chooses a man &gt;&gt; and gives him a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now we're not talking about individual men and and pastors and preachers. We're talking about very specific age messengers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. prophets of God because any man could have a message from God. In fact, we all should have a message from God. We all should be able to hear the voice of God in our own lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But talking about this here, if we have the blood, if we take the prophet's word and apply the blood the way that we're supposed to, you know, everyone could have had blood. Just to be clear, some people could have had blood and put it in a little cup &gt;&gt; on the step. We talked about this in the past. You know, it's probably pretty warm and moist there. They're very close to the ocean, right? The Mediterranean Sea. And and and the Nile River is probably quite humid. And to have a little bit of blood and and to put it on the side of the building, it might have attracted a lot of flies. It might have not been a very clean thing. In fact, I think in the land of Egypt, a little bit of blood on open display was probably sacriiggious according to the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; It probably was something that wasn't a very nice thing according to the traditions of the day. &gt;&gt; But that didn't change the fact that was thus saith the Lord by God through his prophet to his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now the people had the opportunity to decide that I'm going to follow that prophet's word to the letter. Why? because my children's life they they they depend on it. &gt;&gt; The firstborn in the land depends on it. &gt;&gt; Now we could look at it this way. Who would be the firstborn in the land? Is it just children? It's a very broad statement, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Because there's many adults who are firstborn. &gt;&gt; There could be fathers. There could be mothers. There could be aunts and uncles and grandparents. There could be a lot of firstborn in the land. It's not just a family with a husband and a wife and their first little baby is the one that's going to go. No, no, no. That's what Pharaoh did. God's judgment was executing firstborn judgment. &gt;&gt; And it was upon every single one in the land. &gt;&gt; That's powerful. &gt;&gt; But for those people that took the word of the prophet to the letter, &gt;&gt; they weren't willing to mingle with it. They weren't willing to compromise with it. They weren't willing to say, "I I I know that God had a good man and he used him in a mighty way, but I'm just going to do just a little bit of my own thing because it's good. I still have a job. Everything's happening in my life. I'm healthy. It's okay. I'll still make it to heaven." True, you will still make it to heaven. But you might have to go through a little bit of hell first, &gt;&gt; unfortunately. But the people who have the ability to hear the voice of the vindicated prophet can apply that word the way that it was given. They don't have to worry about that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I think it's so wonderful how he brought the message. William Brham brought the message according to God as he gave it to him and said, "Why would God want to take a bride? Why would a man want to take a bride that he's going to marry and then judge? &gt;&gt; Why would we want to take a bride and then get her married, put that wedding band of unmmerited grace upon her finger, and then judge her?" &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; he said, "I don't want to take a wife that I'm going to judge. I want a bride of my own choosing." &gt;&gt; And just that revelation alone, I think, gives us enough &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Enough revelation to just be so thankful. &gt;&gt; Just so thankful. You know, brothers and sisters, this weekend as we as we celebrate, as we observe, as we participate in the the Thanksgiving weekend, some of us it might be just the Canadian Thanksgiving weekend. Some of us it we might not do anything because we're we're we're US citizens and we're just going to wait specifically until the fourth the fourth weekend in November, which is the the US Thanksgiving. And that's okay. Whatever. The fact of the matter is there is a Thanksgiving. And there's a time in North America where we give thanks. We know that this is a celebration that goes around the world. And some people would say that it goes back many generations in many different ways. And truly it does. &gt;&gt; But while I want to speak about it today specifically through the lens of our vindicated prophet, &gt;&gt; the thanksgiving in North America. Now, there's some Canadians here and there's some US citizens here. I'm sure there's probably other citizens here. But you know, we're all believers here, aren't we? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I trust we are. &gt;&gt; But I just think it's so beautiful. You know, the blood shall be a token for you. It shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are. &gt;&gt; And when I see the blood, &gt;&gt; I will pass over you. &gt;&gt; And the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you &gt;&gt; when I smite the land of Egypt. I can't help but think that we're living in the land of Egypt right now, aren't we? &gt;&gt; We're living in the land of Goan. We've got task masters. We have to go to work. We We live under the curse &gt;&gt; whether we want to or not. I know there's some people that would potentially act in such a way that the everything is so good in their life. There's no curse. We all live under the bondage of the curse. We're stuck. We're bound by gravity. One of these days, gravity is going to give way though to a brand new body. But we still live in this world. We don't need to be of this world though just because we're in the world. &gt;&gt; You know, verse 14 says, "And this day shall be unto you for a memorial." And and I just can't help but think it's a little bit like us giving thanks, isn't it? This day shall be unto you for a memorial. Even till today, the Jews celebrate Passover. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because some people followed the word of a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; And the Jews are very very diligent at observing this. So much so that when they observe Passover, they will actually have an extra chair at the table. &gt;&gt; Because they believe that Messiah is coming. And one of these days Messiah is going to take that chair right there and they're going to say to him, "Friend, how did you get those wounds in your hands?" And he's going to say, "In the house of my friends. those ones that claim to be my friends. They're the ones. &gt;&gt; And we know a whole nation is going to be saved in an hour, &gt;&gt; in a day, &gt;&gt; but until then, this was given as a memorial. And I just think it's so beautiful when we look at this &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving. I want to try and encourage us, brothers and sisters, as we carve into our meals and and sit down and and participate in our fellowship and our our friendship and our families, let's think about what we have to be thankful for. And I just so appreciate how brother Don said it this morning. We have got the Holy Ghost, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. One day we're going to look back from eternity and we're going to say, "Thank God I saw that token. I was able to see that token myself &gt;&gt; because of that token. He saw the blood &gt;&gt; because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever." &gt;&gt; And you know, we can say, "Well, the plagues, there's plagues. We we could see plagues. There was there was the Corona virus and all of that. And I'm not claiming to be a scientist by any means. We know that there's plagues. They're still alive. The black plague is still here on Earth. It's not gone. &gt;&gt; All of these things are around. But I don't think those are the things that we need to worry about. Some people are just deathly afraid of COVID. And if you are, I want to say to you this morning, there is a deliverance. &gt;&gt; Not from COVID necessarily. Sure, there is. God will heal our flesh. But there's a deliverance from that fear is what I want to say. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we're afraid of dying, why are we afraid of dying? I want to say that loud and clear. Why do we have a fear of death? Because you know what? If you have this token, if you have this baptism of the Holy Ghost, you cannot experience death. &gt;&gt; This flesh will perish. &gt;&gt; It has to perish. &gt;&gt; But death has no hold. Now &gt;&gt; if death has any hold then Calvary was a false &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; what happened at Calvary &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ God in flesh came down &gt;&gt; and bore our shame took our iniquities to the grave &gt;&gt; he delivered us &gt;&gt; yes he did &gt;&gt; we don't need to live in fear &gt;&gt; but you know I want to say this. Don't be afraid of a plague that can come on the earth. Don't be afraid of the plague of maybe black death or the next crazy thing that's going to outbreak around the world and they're going to shut the world down. Don't think that's not going to happen. It'll happen again for sure. &gt;&gt; They've proven they can do it. They've got full control over all the economy now. Everything is in full control of the peace system. &gt;&gt; But I want to say this. Do be afraid of complacency. &gt;&gt; Do be afraid of not actually seeing that token in your own life. &gt;&gt; Because if you can't see that token, can he see the blood? &gt;&gt; I'm saying it that way because it's that important. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We don't need to be afraid of of all of the fleshly things in this world. Like we could die or get sick or maybe some of these things could happen to us. What we do need to be afraid of is just getting lackluster. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Getting complacent, letting things slip in our life, &gt;&gt; just getting comfortable here. Don't get comfortable here, brothers and sisters. We don't want to get comfortable in this world. This world is not our home. You know, it was the pilgrims that settled in the US and we know that this world is not our home. We're just pilgrims passing through. But the pilgrims who came and settled. I just wonder I wonder I know if you look up history I'm just saying it just the way that brother Barry does these things. I look at things in a different way I guess. But I wonder if the pilgrims look back to Exodus chapter 12 when they actually had a feast of thanksgiving. The very first feast of thanksgiving for those people that don't know was after their very first year of being landed in the United States. It wasn't the United States then. It was the new world. It was North America. But they they they got together with the natives. And we know that they struggled so hard. And isn't it wonderful to think how incredibly kind those natives were to those people who arrived because if it wasn't for those natives, those people probably would have perished. Those natives taught them how to cultivate food, how to grow, to plant, how to harvest, how to maybe hunt the game that was in the land, how to maybe treat things with with with with herbs and stuff when they were sick. Most of those people actually passed away &gt;&gt; according to the record. The first group of people that landed in uh in Massachusetts, it wasn't that at the time. It was it was it was just the new world. But, you know, it's interesting. It just makes me think, did those people when they decided after their first year when most of those people died in that first terrible winter, should we have a feast of celebration, should we just be thankful for what God has done for us? &gt;&gt; I believe there was 102, 105 people. There wasn't very many people that came. That sounds like a lot, but it's not really a lot. But from those people, it says in the in the history, there was like 34 of them, I think, that were actual believers looking for a religious freedom. And all the rest of them were workers. They were skilled trades. They were laborers. Some were indentured slaves. It says indentured servants is the word they use. They don't use slaves. But it's interesting to look at it and and think about where this this feast of Thanksgiving, the the the weekend of Thanksgiving began. It was with the pilgrims in Massachusetts in a place called uh Plymouth. And when we were there, it was kind of interesting. We actually got to see the sign pointing to Plymouth. And I thought, man, I wonder if that's where Plymouth Rock actually is. We went out to Cape Cod and you know, we didn't actually get there, but I I just thought it was really neat to see. I'd heard about it all my life. And you know, that's where the new world began. And to think that the whole entire purpose was so that God could raise a prophet to this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; To this world, God could get a vindicated prophet just from that original boatload of people. &gt;&gt; But where did the the tradition come from? We know they were God-fearing people. So, I can't help but think they had some sort of reference, some sort of navigation back to the word of God in the day in which they lived. And if you look at the if you look at the pictures, if you type in, you know, original Thanksgiving pictures, it shows pictures of the Puritans and the pilgrims and, you know, different folks who were around at that time, but they're all dressed in dresses. Pretty interesting to see. There's no cleavage. &gt;&gt; There's pretty much no legs, &gt;&gt; you know, there's there's there's a different appearance to the people. And and what are they doing when they're sitting down and they're actually going around the table? They're giving thanks. What are they doing? They're actually in prayer. They look like they're reverent. They're they're they're giving thanks. Someone is standing and you can see they've got their heart hand over their heart and they're looking up and it's like they're offering a prayer to God for thanksgiving for what he has done for them. They have an opportunity now for freedom of religion and and freedom of employment, the ability to actually own land and and be free. I just wonder how how much further down the road are we to think that all of this came from that. And some people might say, "Well, Brother Barry, there was the Canadians." And sure enough, there was. There was Champlain and and and all of that. There was the original settlement in Quebec, which is what is Quebec now. And you know, that actually happened before Plymouth Rock. That happened before the before the pilgrims landed there. the French were actually happening in Quebec. I'm not trying to give us a history lesson. I just think it's interesting to look at all of this to to see what's gone on. All of these people helped create this environment that we live in. &gt;&gt; And a lot of them fought with their lives &gt;&gt; for this cause for us to have specifically this ability to have freedom of religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we get down, we get tired, we maybe get frustrated, we get whatever the adjective is in our life and we just don't want to go to church, we just don't want to worship, we just don't want to whatever. But we have this freedom. H how could we just neglect such a great salvation that we've been given in the day in which we live? You know, I I I think about this is a an interesting thing. In Exodus, they were given the instructions by God through their prophet to actually create a memorial. That day, the Passover day was was to be a memorial. And you know there was a place in the US a time and place in the US where there was a presidential pro pl pro proclamation a presidential proclamation and it was officially declared a national holiday by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 to actually celebrate Thanksgiving and I believe it's the fourth the fourth weekend in uh November in the US and you know it was given in in Canada On January 31st, 1957, much later, the Governor General of Canada, Vincent Massie, he issued a proclamation stating, "A day of general thanksgiving to Almighty God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the bountiful harvest, which Canada has been blessed &gt;&gt; to be observed on the second Monday in October. And we know that in even the prophet in in the day in which we live, he said that Canada would be a leader of nations. &gt;&gt; And I remember vividly this is just from the hip. I wish that I would have prepared this a little more. But you know to this point about what what he declared there about Canada being a bountiful harvest. You know the prophet he declared that Canada would be a leader of nations. This was actually something that happened in the time in which we lived. It was on, I believe, was it MLAN's magazine or Time magazine? Brother Ken actually showed it. It was actually a headline, Canada, leader of nations. &gt;&gt; I remember thinking that's just amazing to see. Such a little thing. It doesn't change anything to do with salvation, but alls it does is just say, "Yep, that's my prophet. &gt;&gt; That's my prophet." You know, association association it does have uh it does have importance. There is a very very important reason to have an association with the prophet. We'll get into that a little bit later. But, you know, out out of the the the Bible, the most important thing that we have to refer to and and the Bible Thanksgiving is H8426. It's pronounced ta. And you know, it comes from a root word. I'm not going to get into it because it actually you can look it up if you get into the the lexicon or or the concordance. But thanksgiving, it comes from Oh, it comes from 3034 if you look it up. I didn't bring it up, but that word is pronounced yada. yada. And it made me think, is that where is that where you hear that that saying in the world when you have someone that's talking and and you might have somebody maybe a teenager who's got a little chip on their shoulder and they hear mom or dad saying something to them and and they just don't want to hear it and you hear them going yada yada yada. Is that what that means? I wonder. I wonder. I I want to look it up a little further. But the word we're looking at thanksgiving pronounced taa is properly an extension of the hand that is by implication of vowel or usually adoration specifically a choir of worshippers confession sacrifice of praise thanksgiving offering thanksgiving in the Bible that is the definition of it I thought that was so good you know we have been given given this uh this ordinance and I say that we've been given this ordinance because it is very applicable to a communion table when we look at what the magnitude of the communion table actually is because you know brothers and sisters it's good to look back it's good to have a little bit of a a history lesson but I also think it's very important to make it relevant for today and to realize that this this token is truly the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the day in which we But, you know, it's interesting to see the way God does things through history and and he brings it up and and makes it relevant. So, let's just turn over to Matthew chap 26 verse 28. Matthew chap 26 verse 28. Maybe start with let's just go to 26 26 26 that's interesting. Exodus 12:12 Matthew 26 26 and as they were eating Jesus took bread and blessed it and he broke it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat. this is my body. And he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them, saying, "Drink ye all of it. For this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this of this fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new with you in my father's kingdom. And I love verse 30 here. When they had sung a hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives. Something about singing a hymn. Even Jesus was interested in singing hymns. But that's not what I want to dwell on today. I want to talk about this uh verse 28. For this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins. He had not yet died yet on Calvary in the natural. But we know that lamb was slain before the foundation of the world is what the Bible says. But because that happened in the heavens, it had to actually happen on earth. There had to be a literal manifestation of that taking place. &gt;&gt; But looking at this scripture here, I think it's interesting. This cup, Jesus sitting down with the disciples as they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it, and then he gave them the wine. The the feast. It's interesting to see that that's how he desired to express this. We know that we have another scripture that we read and we're not going to get into that today for communion table. But this this one in particular I think is just interesting to look at how Jesus expresses the mind of God to the world. And as he does that, he takes and shows them the importance of having food. And it goes right back to Exodus. It's no different than that to remember this. And you know, brothers and sisters, the church in the day in which we live, we only have three ordinances that we are given to live by. We we remember those, I'm sure. But for the sake of of stirring up our pure minds by way of remembrance, I just want to want to bring it out to the the surface this morning. And that is baptism in Jesus' name, communion, and footwashing. That's what we live by. That's how believers in this day follow the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; But it's interesting how many people will actually claim to believe the messenger for the age. They'll say, "God sent a prophet," but yet &gt;&gt; they can't come to a communion table, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or they're not interested in coming to a footwashing. They say, "That's crazy. That was for a different time. That's a different culture. Why would I wash someone's foot?" &gt;&gt; We know that the word says that if we can't humble ourselves, that's what footwashing is all about. If God himself can come down and manifest in flesh and make himself a footwash flunky and wash all of his disciples feet and we can't do it ourselves. He's not going to judge us for other people's actions, is he? &gt;&gt; If we're willing to judge ourselves here, if we truly do judge ourselves here, then we will simply follow the commission that he's given us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no excuses for it. There's no way that we going to we're going to be able to go and stand before him. If we don't judge oursel properly, we won't do all that he has commissioned us to do. And that will be how how he said you'll know them by their fruits. That's how you'll know them because they won't follow my word. They won't follow the instruction for their day. But not everyone can. And it's not up to us to get upset or worried about it. It's only up to us to pray for those people. &gt;&gt; Amen. to have a desire for them to actually be able to follow the word for their day. &gt;&gt; You know, if if people back in the day of of of the children of Israel in Egypt, if they actually took the blood from their lamb and went over and applied it to their neighbor's house, that blood would maybe be in the exact right location. Maybe it would be the exact right blood, but it wouldn't be from their own sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. It had to be from their own lamb. And we know that God even made a provision for it for those people who maybe didn't have a family and and didn't have many people in their home. And if they killed the lamb, it would just be too much. He said, "Get together. &gt;&gt; Have some fellowship. &gt;&gt; Remember what's going on. Talk about the things of the Lord. Have this solemn feast, but apply the blood the way that I've instructed you." Right? &gt;&gt; And everyone who got together under that roof could identify with that scripture, could identify with that sacrifice. And as they did that, that death angel passed over them. &gt;&gt; But you know, that death angel was truly the word of God for the day in which they lived, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; The same thing that judged the entire world in the days of Noah is the same thing that saved Noah. Some people might say, "Well, it was the ark, brother Barry." But you know, he built an ark and he sat in it for seven days. Did it save him? &gt;&gt; The ark never saved him. The water saved him because it caused the ark to float. Remember, when the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of God raises a standard &gt;&gt; against that flood of the enemy. And we're not talking about floods of water in the day in which we live. We're talking about the onslaught of the devil in the day in which we live through fashion, through through whatever it is, critical thinking, all of these things where people are are choosing sides, the polarization now people are for Charlie Kirk, people are against Charlie Kirk, all these different things, these political agendas, all this stuff is a distraction by the devil. That's where we need to fear, brothers and sisters. If there's anything to fear, &gt;&gt; the devil is just getting us distracted &gt;&gt; or at least trying to. &gt;&gt; I remember saying it one time before and and I was having a conversation the other day about it how I got in trouble for saying from the pulpit, and I'm not going to back up on it. I'm going to actually double down on it. I got in trouble for saying that a son of God, a daughter of God, has got no place being out there protesting in any one of these protests. Why would we be doing that? &gt;&gt; If we're going to do something, we ought to get a drum and a soap box and go and stand on a corner and sing about Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Put on a sandwich board and said, "I'm a fool for Christ." on the front and on the back say, "Whose fool are you?" &gt;&gt; That's right. But to get involved in in a protest where we're going to go and jump on board with some movement that's happening in this world, the only thing we're doing is get involved in a movement that's happening in this world. And whose movement is that if it's in this world? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, it's either of God or it's of Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if it's not preaching this word of God or that God sent a prophet to this world, it's of Satan. &gt;&gt; And it can be so flowery. It can be so eloquent. &gt;&gt; Don't doubt for a second that both Cain and Abel went to the same church. &gt;&gt; They both worshiped. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They both knew who God was. And no doubt Cain had an even more eloquent &gt;&gt; movement. &gt;&gt; He had a more eloquent thing happening. His his his altar was so beautiful. &gt;&gt; But Abel, he just had what? What did Abel have by revelation? What did he do? We know that he went and he took a lamb and he chopped its neck. Brother Brandham says, "With a rock." And we know that as he did that, Cain must have been like, "Oh, oh, you're terrible. Look at the mess you're making all over the place. What are you doing?" Because he never had a revelation. &gt;&gt; And you know, back in the day, the people in in in Egypt, they must have been saying, "What are you doing? You're putting blood on the doors, the doorpost, and the lentils. You're bringing flies." Anybody here deal with flies? Now that we're on the acorage, we deal with flies. I'll tell you what, I'd probably have a real hard time taking blood and putting it on the doorpost of our door of our front door. My wife would be saying, "What are you doing? We have a hard enough time with flies." But I just can't help but imagine back in that day that would have been so terrible. &gt;&gt; You'd be bringing flies all over the place. Come on. Haven't we had enough flies? &gt;&gt; Right. Now you want to go and apply blood and bring more flies. It sounds crazy, but you know the people who truly are in line with the word for their day, they do sound crazy. &gt;&gt; They're not normal people. &gt;&gt; But you know, saying that I can actually have Jesus Christ in my life and I'm going to get to Jesus Christ, but I'm just going to circumvent his prophet. Guess what? You can have Jesus Christ, but it's going to take you some work to get there because you're saying, "I'm gonna do it the way that I want to do it." Instead of saying, "I accept the way that you've done it." &gt;&gt; Because a prophet is the way of the word. God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Yeah. Hebrews 13:8. We know that. You know, Brother Brad, I'm in in a message. Boy, I got it mixed up here. And the token, I looked it up. I thought it was so good. In the message, the token, I I type things up. The way I study is I'll I'll I'll study something and and then I'll see, well, what message says it the most. And and I just chuckled as I was doing this because it goes right to the token. I don't know how many times he says it in the token, but he says it a lot. I think the most out of any time. And what did I look up? It was Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is what I looked up. But brother Brandham in this in this message right at the very beginning in his prayer and he in part of his prayer here he says and we pray this will be a night that will be long remembered because your presence being with us as we stand tonight at this thanksgiving closing of the great celebration across the nation &gt;&gt; of how good you were to our forefathers. It's wonderful to look back and think about that. How good you were to our forefathers. We turn our heads to thank you, Lord. As he says this, I can't help but think about those those those 10 lepers. Leprosy being a sign of unbelief, the unbeliever. And Jesus said to that one that turned around to thank him, that turned his head to thank him. &gt;&gt; Weren't there 10? Yes, it was. &gt;&gt; What a tremendous thing it must have been for that one to realize and sad at the same time because no doubt some of them were his friends. He says, "You how good you were to our forefathers. We too turn our heads to thank you, Lord, for what you've done for us. Now we pray that you'll grant all these things that we ask for. We ask them in Jesus' name and for his honor." &gt;&gt; Amen. Sounds simple, but I think that prayer there, just the ending of that prayer is so relevant. &gt;&gt; When we pray, how do we pray? Are we asking asking it in the name of Jesus for his honor? If we're doing that, I think we're on the right track. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I want to say today, brothers and sisters, is that clock working? &gt;&gt; I'm like, yeah, they said that at the beginning. I was just joking. I knew it wasn't working. So, because the clock's not working, I don't even know what time it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Feels like we just started. I'm five minutes into the service. Is that right? &gt;&gt; What are we thankful for today, brothers and sisters? &gt;&gt; What What are we truly thankful for? We had a little conversation last night and that was with the family. What truly What are we thankful for? What is it that really we're thankful for? Some people are thankful for simple little things. Simple what we might think are simple little things, but we don't know the background behind their thanksgiving. Someone might be thankful for one thing and someone might be thankful for something totally different. And and and carnal things are nice, but brothers and sisters, I don't want us to talk about carnality today. We're in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are we thankful for? when we are standing maybe before him and we're able to shake his hand for real. The time is coming where we're going to see Jesus Christ in his corporal body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if we have that opportunity the very first time we meet him? He says, "I'm so glad you're here. &gt;&gt; I knew you before the foundation of the world. Enter ye into the joy of the Lord." And by the way, what are you the most thankful for? What will we say? I doubt we're going to be saying, "I'm so thankful that I got new tires on my car." I doubt that we're going to say, "I got a new job." I doubt that we're going to say, "This happened to me or that or the other." We're going to say, we're certainly thankful that we were given the token. &gt;&gt; We were given the ability to overcome ourselves so that we could actually be here today because we're going to realize really what the important things are. But you know, brothers and sisters, I'm not discounting new tires on the car. We need them. We live in a place where, you know what, winter tires are very important. And and sometimes you can drive without winter tires. It can just be all seasons. But new tires certainly work better than old tires. I'll tell you by experience. If you ever need to stop in the winter time, you'll know what I mean. But we don't want to discount the needs that we have in our lives. And I want to say this, I think it's important. He knows that we have needs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's allowed the needs to be there in our lives so that he can provide those needs because that's his word, which is actually his will. &gt;&gt; I will supply all of your needs &gt;&gt; according to my riches &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. But seek ye first the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; and all of his righteousness, and then I'll add all these other things unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just need to make sure that we're actually getting things in the exact right order. God is a God of order. &gt;&gt; He's not interested in it just being willy-nilly, is he? He wants it to be exactly the way that he has given it. And I think it's so beautiful the way that he gave the instruction to the children of Israel when they were in Gan in in Exodus, the scripture that we read, Exodus 12:12, you know, they were given a sign. They had to take that blood and apply it the way they were supposed to, the way the prophets said, which was God's instructions. And if they did, they didn't have to worry about any plague coming around. They didn't have to worry about the devil coming around taking their children. They don't have to worry about problems in their marriage because they know that they have a baseline and that is that token. They can always go back to that token. When things get tough, they can go back to that token. They can look at that token. We know that God gave them a basic example and that was a brass serpent, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It was the serpent wrapped around the pole. And and we know that even medicine today uses that. But why is that? Because when the plague came in into the camp of the children of Israel, because they were disobedient and the snake would bite them, alls they had to do was look at that pole, that brass serpent. &gt;&gt; And alls we have to do today is look at that token. The token wasn't given for him. The token was given for us. &gt;&gt; So I want to say if we can see that token in our lives, we've got every single reason to rejoice with thanksgiving in our heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what are we thankful for today, brothers and sisters? If you can't see the token, I suggest that you get to a place where you can see the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the death angel is passing through the land. &gt;&gt; But it's not as we suppose. We said it before. The death angel is only interested in getting us distracted, getting us from getting that token. That's all the death angel wants us to do. Get get us from getting the token and get our children distracted from getting the token. That's all the death angel's interested in. Of course, if he could harm us, he will. But it's not a death angel the way it was in Exodus 12:12 in the land of Goan. It's a death angel spiritually. So, what are we thankful for today? You know, brother Bradam, in this message, the token further on paragraph 115, he says, just like Thanksgiving Day, many people today never thought tens of thousands of times of thousands and millions of America eat dinner today in a Thanksgiving celebration with a turkey on the table and never as much as offered a blessing, returned thanks. Just made me think about it. I remember living in the world in in days like that and the food would be done and everyone would just dig in, just dig right in to that food, even maybe before everything was served, they'd be already munching down stuff. And it always did feel a little bit funny to me in the world, but you know, there's a lot of people that do that. And and why? Because they feel like they're entitled to it. &gt;&gt; Oh my, &gt;&gt; there's a lot of people that believe they're absolutely entitled to that food. And you know, one day that's going to change, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But here he says, and and never as much as offered a blessing, return thanks. &gt;&gt; But they wouldn't have this without having it on the same table where they had a turkey, a court of whiskey, and a lot of beer sitting around the table. It's become a tradition, and I've witnessed it. It's become a tradition. He says, "You say that's ridiculous. That's not even Americanism. Well, it very much is. It's even Canadianism speaking from experience. But here's the prophet of God, the seventh angel messenger, God speaking to this age through his man. &gt;&gt; I'll turn it right back into your lap. &gt;&gt; To come to the altar with a driedyed confession is a tradition. He says you should die there to your sacrifice as you identify yourself that you are dead. I was talking to someone yesterday about a new birth experience. You know, brothers and sisters, don't doubt this for a second. A birth is messy. And if you've never had a new birth in your life, you don't know what it means. If you've never seen a birth, you don't know what it means. But animals have children, they have a birth happens through an animal, it's messy. When humans give birth, it's messy. And brother Brandham, he says it, whether it's in a pig pen or at an altar, it's messy. &gt;&gt; A birth is a mess. &gt;&gt; But you know, we're not interested in what other people think, are we? &gt;&gt; Because if it's truly a new birth, it's only about what he thinks. Right? &gt;&gt; But if we're busy thinking about what other people think, I'll tell you what, we're not having a new birth. &gt;&gt; We're having an intellectual stimulation. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you today, don't come to church for an intellectual stimulation. &gt;&gt; That's not what this church is about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was thinking about it today. As a pastor, as a preacher, you you really start to wonder sometimes the devil works hard. &gt;&gt; He goes about as a roaring lion. you're not worthy. What are you doing? Blah blah blah. Give up. Go home. There's somebody else. All of that junk. It happens in your mind. The devil bombards when it's time to prepare for a service. But you know what? I just think it's so beautiful to think, where did I come from? &gt;&gt; How was I raised? And I could tell you without a shadow of a doubt, that's where I was able to say, "Beat it, Satan." Because I know that I know that I know that I met the Lord Jesus Christ. And how did I do it? I came to an ordinary Wednesday night service where my pastor was preaching the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; July 27th, 2005. So I was able to say, you know what, I'm not actually off track preaching the Holy Ghost. This is what we need for the day in which we live. And that's why my pastor taught me that. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, there came a revelation one day where I had to go and have an outward expression of the true inward work that happened to me. And brother Logan can testify to it. There's a witness right there. It was cold. It was September. It was the Bow River. We went to a watery grave and washed the old men downstream. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I wonder how far down they are now, brother. Maybe Hudson's Bay somewhere out there. But it happened. &gt;&gt; And for me, it was interesting because I was able to say, you know, I know that I'm not too far off base. The devil wants me to think that I'm I'm actually crazy. Maybe I shouldn't be doing this, &gt;&gt; but I know God put me here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as long as he wants me here, I'll be here. &gt;&gt; And as soon as he don't want me here, he's got something better for me. So, it's okay. But you know what I want to do is make sure as long as I'm here that I'm preaching the truth. And the truth for our day is that we need to see the token. &gt;&gt; If you can't see the token in your life, I would say be afraid. &gt;&gt; Let's let's be afraid of one thing, brothers and sisters, and that is that we don't have the token. &gt;&gt; But you know what that fear is going to do? That's a healthy fear. That fear is going to drive us to the altar where we do have that new birth. &gt;&gt; This message of the hour is about getting us saved. &gt;&gt; This message of the hour is about getting us to Jesus Christ. And that's the purpose of the message of the hour. If we've made it anything else, then we've got it wrong. Boy, &gt;&gt; it's pretty quiet. But brothers and sisters, this is about getting the token for the day in which we live. Amen. &gt;&gt; Water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins so that we can get the Holy Ghost. Because if we're baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and we say, "Oh, sure. I believe that God sent a prophet." Oh, yes. It's wonderful. He's a mighty man of God. He's got a tremendous ministry, but I've already been baptized. Have you? The prophet said, "You haven't." &gt;&gt; And I want to say it this way. God through the prophet said, "You haven't even been baptized yet." If you're only baptized in titles, you have to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that is the formula that he gave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; And if you are, you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think it's so beautiful because I always say this and I'm going to say it again. I think it's important to remember that there's some people that will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost based on their confession because God knows their heart. He gives them the Holy Ghost before they even get water baptized. &gt;&gt; It happens. But if it's truly the baptism of the Holy Ghost, guess what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They will come exactly according to the word of God. Acts 2:38 will take place in their life. &gt;&gt; They won't say, "No, I'm good, man. I I I've been baptized in titles. It's fine." That won't ever happen. That trinitarian spirit, it can't stand before the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's why people get so aggressive when you start talking about this very specific thing because without the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the Bible is just simply knowledge. &gt;&gt; And I'm not even going to apologize for that. There's no need to apologize for that. We're not into apologetics here. We're into the baptism of the Holy Ghost here. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost is the token for our day. And it gives us every single reason to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom, he says this though. I think it's so good. I'll turn it right back into your lap. To come to the altar with a dried eyed confession is a tradition. You should die there to your sacrifice as you identify yourself that you are dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Buried in Christ. The word world is dead behind you. And you come to the place I'll say it where you don't want to fellowship with the world. those old names and numbers that you were associating with in the world. When you truly repent, repent means to change your mind, you actually want nothing to do with that old self. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when we truly want to come to church and actually have the polished image and everything is good, you know, I'm I'm I'm conforming, everything is fine, but I still have the old friends numbers and they're still going to call me. And you know, if they you if you're still connected that way, you're not going to overcome. You won't. &gt;&gt; Satan will still bring you down. &gt;&gt; He'll still bring you down. You can go to them and testify that I've been saved &gt;&gt; and they're not going to want nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; But what they're going to do is try and encourage you to come out and party. &gt;&gt; Just just come to the party for a little while. Don't worry about it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to drink. You don't have to smoke. You don't have to do anything. But, you know, just get under the beat of that music. The devil knows exactly what it takes. And as that music starts to happen, then we start to get into the groove of it. You get in the spirit, right? Brother Brandham says it in the church age book. We ought to be just as exuberant as them, man. Those people will dance in the spirit. Don't take very much. And I'm I'm guilty of it. I could be walking through a store and I'll hear a song from the old me and I'll just start going like this and I think, "Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; it's bad." &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "You don't have to worry about anything. If if the Holy Ghost doesn't get your children, rock and roll will." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. We need to be careful as parents to make sure that we are the Holy Ghost for our children. &gt;&gt; But he says that you should die there to your sacrifice as you identify yourself that you are dead. How do we identify ourselves as dead? Do away with the old man. Get rid of all the old stuff. Throw out the trash. &gt;&gt; Get rid of all of it. Don't go and associate with all the people who are broken. How are you ever going to grow if you stay with broken people? &gt;&gt; How many people get healed and want to stay in the hospital? &gt;&gt; How many people do that? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; When they get healed, they run. &gt;&gt; They don't like hospital food. &gt;&gt; They don't like hospital bathrooms. They don't like the nasty viruses that live in hospitals. &gt;&gt; They want to go home. There is a place of rest. &gt;&gt; And it's not in a broken place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need to die there to our sacrifice. Having a dry-eyed confession, brothers and sisters, I'm sorry. It maybe I'm not sorry. It's not real. We need to have a real baptism of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; a real experience in our lives where we can say that I know right there that I met the conditions that God requires for me in my life. And because of that, I can go back to it every single time the devil comes in like a flood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because just because we get saved, don't think the devil ain't coming in like a flood. He's coming in harder like a flood once we truly get saved. &gt;&gt; But what's going to happen is those things that were holding us back, holding us with all the sick people, with all the situations in our lives seemingly overpowering us, overwhelming us will start to fade away. And one day we'll scratch our head and say, "Wasn't I tempted by that before? I used to have that used to be a problem for me. And then you can really have thanksgiving in your heart and say, "Thank you, Lord." When you come to church, something is going to be excited inside of you to be in church so that you can worship. &gt;&gt; We got to die to our die to our our tradition. I want to say it that way. We have to die there to our sacrifice. We have to identify ourselves. You know, there's people that maybe say they don't like the blood and all of that. They don't like the the teareyed confession and all of that. The children of Israel when they had to go in and actually bring a sacrifice once a year maybe for their family. It was the way that God ordained for them in the day in which they lived. They had to go and put their hands right on the head. Right on the head of that animal while the high priest actually slit the throat of that animal. Why did they have to do that? It's a death. It's not a birth. It's a death. But why did they have to do that? Because a a a death is a sign that there is going to be a life. That that blood that was coming out of that animal was that token in the day in which they lived. &gt;&gt; But you know, there could have been people that said, "I just don't like blood. I just don't like being there. I can't watch it. I can't touch it. I don't want to be there." And it was still outside of God's word. You could give the lamb to the priest and say, "Go ahead. I identified with it. I've got my name tag is around its neck." You know, you can undo it before you cut its throat and set it down and say, "This is the Johnson sacrifice." And proclaim it to the church. This is the Johnson sacrifice. Now, I'm going to slit its throat. No, it wouldn't matter. It wouldn't matter. It would be a stench in the nostril of God because he said, "You have to identify with your sacrifice." &gt;&gt; And we have to identify with our sacrifice, brothers and sisters. There's no getting around it. Saying that we can have a dry-eyed confession and and a dry-eyed experience. I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but I'm just going to never give God worship and I'm just going to be stoic and cold and I'm going to say it's my tradition. I'm never going to be able to have tears. There's never an emotion in my life when I come to church. The spirit of God never moves me, but I'm truly baptized with the Holy Ghost. Really? Has he saved you? &gt;&gt; If he has, you're going to give worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just the devil that wants to get in our life and say that I've got this thing. I've got this thing. I've got this thing. I've got an excuse. I've got a reason. Don't worry. I'm saved. &gt;&gt; Someone else ain't going to worry. But I think you should. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We should worry if we're not saved. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We need to be buried in Christ &gt;&gt; and the world dead behind us. Not dragging it around and saying, "I'm trying to help other people." Those other people are going to take you down. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, they will. &gt;&gt; I've heard it said, I'm not a lifeguard, but I've heard it said, there's probably people that know, smarter people than me, but when there's a drowning man, when you want to rescue that man, you can't actually grab him and then drag him by swimming. If you do, he's probably going to take you down because that man is in full panic mode. &gt;&gt; What he's going to do is take you down. I've heard it said that you've got to you got to knock him. You got to shock him to the place where he can no longer fight and you can rescue him. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I believe this word of God needs to do that to us. &gt;&gt; We've got to see that old man knocked out &gt;&gt; otherwise he's going to drag us down. &gt;&gt; He says you've got to be buried buried in Christ. The world is dead behind you and and you're to walk in a new life with Jesus Christ. not just be conformed to this message of the hour, but be transformed by this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And you're to walk in a new life with Christ Jesus in his resurrection. Last week we talked about the power of his resurrection. This is the power of his resurrection where the old man dies and there's a new man that comes to life inside of us. And people say to you, "What's wrong with you? Why don't you want to come out and party? What's wrong with you? Why don't you want to go and do this? What? Why? What's wrong? And all you can say is, you know what? I I I I I can't even explain it myself. It's something totally new to me. But you know what happens is eventually you get bored. You get tired of hearing people say, "Why? Why? Why?" You begin to want to hang out with people who say, "Praise the Lord. How long have you been saved? What's your testimony? How did you get the Holy Ghost? When did you hear about this message? What's God doing for you?" in your life right now today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because iron sharpens iron, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Who would want to go back and live in a hospital? Who would want to do that? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; You're to walk in a new life with Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in his resurrection, loving his word and taking his word. Watch him. This is so beautiful, brothers and sisters. Watch him. We don't need to do it. Watch him identifying himself in his word. And I want to say this, brother Barry's words, just inserting it into this quote. Watch him. Watch him identifying himself in his word in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the new birth experience. &gt;&gt; That's where you can say somehow someway, I know that I am a new creature in Christ Jesus. something has taken place in my heart and I'm not the same person that I used to be. &gt;&gt; But he's identifying himself in his word as giving you the identification that you've passed from death unto life. What a time that we're living in. Yes, sir. What a time we're living in today. Yes, sir. That's out of the token. You know, brothers and sisters, don't get me wrong. Reflecting is not bad. Reflecting is important, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's a scripture that I read and uh I think it's in Isaiah. I think I might have read at the prayer meeting, but there's coming a time where it says in the word that we will think about how God actually saved us and delivered us, but there's going to come a place where we will remember those no more. But that means that we will actually have a time in our life where we are actually delivered and we do actually remember. I had a conversation with someone once and they asked me, "Will you be able to remember? Do you think we'll be able to remember the old selves when we're over there?" And I think we will. &gt;&gt; I think we will. There's going to come a time though where it won't matter anymore. where there's a new heaven and there's a new earth and a brand new way to live, a brand new way to think, a brand new way to exist. It's just not going to be relevant to think back to all these times. But I do believe we will have a very strong understanding and consciousness. We know the prophet said there will come a day where we'll understand everything. All of those hidden mysteries, all of those things that just happened throughout history where people just disappeared and there's no explanation. All those different things. He said, "All history will understand one day, &gt;&gt; but reflecting isn't a bad thing." And I just want to make sure that I say that it's not bad to reflect. And I think it's important to reflect, &gt;&gt; but it's very important to not actually remain reflecting. Sometimes we can do that and it can be to our detriment. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we can reflect to a place where maybe we just can't get past in our life. Maybe we hurt someone really bad. If you've ever experienced that, you'll know what I mean. Sometimes you just seem to not be able to get over that and to reflect on that. If you do that, you'll never get past that. Sometimes someone has done something to us. And if we reflect on that all the time, we'll never get past it. We can remain stuck there in that reflection. And who wants to live in a reflection? &gt;&gt; To me, that would be just like living in a hospital, maybe even worse, because a reflection is simply an illusion. It's it's a it's an example of what's actually taking place. We're not actually living in the moment. We're living in a memory in in something other than what's taking place. Remaining in a state of time that's in the past is going to actually hinder us. it will not deliver us. Just like me, for example, if I said that I I continually say that I hung out with drunks and I hung out with smokers and parters, and I know I I mention it a lot of times, but I do it for the purpose to bring glory to God because I know where he's brought me from. But if I continually talked about that over and over and over and over, and it was just anytime there was an opportunity to just tell someone that that's who I was, you know what would happen? My thinking would actually take me back there. Right? &gt;&gt; Before long, I would actually not be living the life that I'm living. I would be dwelling in that memory. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, I ain't never going back. &gt;&gt; No way am I going back down into that rat hole. No way. &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; But remembering is important. Reflecting in our lives is important. But sometimes you can see people that remain stuck &gt;&gt; in a reflection. and and what a what a terrible place to be. And I'm not saying that it's impossible for me to go there. I think every single human is subject to that. That's human nature. But we have been given a delivering power in the day in which we live. And that's truly the baptism of the Holy Ghost where we don't need to stay reflecting. We don't have to stay living in a reflection. A reflection is just a negative of what the positive actually is. But you know there's there's a a point where we need to actually reflect. &gt;&gt; We do need to reflect. Are we okay for time? &gt;&gt; My clock says 11:46. So &gt;&gt; to be absolutely fair, I think we have 14 minutes exactly &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving weekend. &gt;&gt; Unless it was a long weekend. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then we have the caveat. Hey, &gt;&gt; right. where we can just let our hair down and just be in the presence of the Lord and &gt;&gt; and just feast spiritually while we have the opportunity. &gt;&gt; Where else would I be? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to drag us too long, but you know, brothers and sisters, brother Brandham, he talks about the Holy Ghost in the day in which we live in this message, the token, paragraph 127, he says, "Talk about a Thanksgiving day." I tell you, not a tradition. I tell you, not a tradition. Not at all. We got too many traditions now. My, this was in 1963. How many traditions do we have now? What we need today is a refreshing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A baptism of the Holy Spirit back in the church, &gt;&gt; not a celebration, but a filling, &gt;&gt; but a filling. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, my true heart's desire is that every one of us would have that filling. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every one of us would have that token that we can see &gt;&gt; that we can see God is identifying himself in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; not a tradition, not a celebration, but a filling. He says, "Then that ought to be our Thanksgiving Day celebration, as we would call it." Hey, we can give thanks every single week, twice a week, and maybe sometimes three times a week. That could be pushing our luck, though. Hey, sometimes if we have an extra service, it's tough. It's amazing to see what happens. The church is full on a Sunday, but you come communion service and it's half. Why is that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We need a filling. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then that ought to be our Thanksgiving Day celebration, as we would call it. It ought to be the Holy Spirit coming into our lives. If we could eat a turkey like our forefathers ate, we ought to receive the Holy Ghost, right? We ought to receive the Holy Ghost like the forefathers had. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not a tradition, but a commandment from God. We should receive it. You know, there was times where people would actually have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We saw it here. We saw it here. I'm going to say it this way. Asbury. &gt;&gt; What What state is that in? &gt;&gt; North Carolina. Asbury in the US. We know it was just last year, wasn't it? They had this great outpouring of the Holy Ghost. There was all these people. And what happened? And it caused the people in that university to not want to go home. &gt;&gt; They wanted to stay in the presence that was happening there. There was the Holy Spirit was taking place in their midst. And I'll tell you brothers and sisters, don't think because we belong to the message of the hour that it wasn't the Holy Ghost that was outpouring there. &gt;&gt; It's the same anointing. Brother Brandham said it in the day in which we live. It's the same anointing. It's just a different vessel. &gt;&gt; Right. Here we are with the open book, the full message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Oren we to be excited about the word of God in which we live. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But if you say all night prayer meeting, &gt;&gt; not a sound. I hear crickets. Why? Because it's the age in which we live in. &gt;&gt; We read about this on Wednesday. It's the pressures of this life. Why can't we pray the way we want to pray? &gt;&gt; It wasn't Wednesday. It was during the prayer meeting. Why can't we pray the way we want to pray? It's in questions and answers in in Cood. Does anybody here ever feel like you can't pray the way the way you want to pray? You can be honest. Raise your hand. I'll tell you, I got both of my hands up because most of the times it feels like I can't pray the way I want to pray. I want to pray, but I just feel like, you know what, brother Bradom, he says it in the church in that in that book, Conduct, Order, and Doctrine. I have three sets left, four sets left at the back if you want a set. But he says it in there in questions and answers. Why? Someone's asked the question, why don't we pray the way we would want to pray? The reason is the revival's over. &gt;&gt; The world revival's over. It's the pressure you and I've heard ministers say it this way. You probably have heard too. Because the spirit of Christ is lifting off of the Gentiles and going back to the Jews. that's taking place right now in the age which we live in. Brothers and sisters, the revival's over, but there's still a bride's revival, &gt;&gt; isn't there still a bride's revival? &gt;&gt; But if we could eat a a a juicy turkey like the forefathers, how oughten we to worship &gt;&gt; the way the forefathers did? Can't we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost the way the forefathers did? Why would it be different for us in the day in which we live now and say that I'm a Canadian, Brother Barry. I've got this history and this tradition and this is the way that we do things. I've always done it this way. What? Why would we do that? What what we're doing is saying that it's not the same Holy Ghost. That's what we're saying. This is out of the token. But, you know, association matters. As we heard this summer, there was such a real nice gathering of brethren that came through this year. Just beautiful. And and I just can't get away from this thought about how association matters. And remember when brother Danny Delmundo was here, he talked about the the daughters as of Zofhiad, Numbers 27. What was their claim to fame? They never had brothers. There was no way they were going to receive an inheritance in their land because there was no male. There was no seed raised up with the the male portion, no boy with the the family name. But what did they do? They went to the prophet of God and they said, "Listen, listen. We have one claim to fame and that's not ours. It's not even our claim. &gt;&gt; It was daddy's claim &gt;&gt; and that's that he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord." &gt;&gt; Wait a second. Didn't they gather themselves together against Moses? &gt;&gt; Wasn't it against Moses? It was totally against the prophet. It was against Moses. &gt;&gt; But it says here that they never gathered themselves together against the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because the word of God says, "Touch not my anointed. &gt;&gt; Neither do my prophets no harm." &gt;&gt; But their claim was that he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora. Now I'm saying this out of the context of this that association matters. &gt;&gt; Right? It does. &gt;&gt; It very much matters. &gt;&gt; Very much matters. &gt;&gt; And this is where when we want to say that, yeah, I've got Jesus Christ. He's right there. I can see. And you know, the world says it that there's many roads lead to home, right? And sure enough, through the denominational realms, there are many roads that will lead people potentially to eternal life. But for the bride of Jesus Christ, which is the true church, the one that he calls his own, that one will only come through the token of their day. &gt;&gt; That's the only way that it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; And I think it's a it's maybe a fearful thing for people that just choose to say, "I'm never going to subscribe to that guy called William Marryiam Brham." It would be a fearful thing because what if it's true? What if it's true? &gt;&gt; Are we willing to just wait and see? &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, I ain't willing to wait and see. &gt;&gt; But I know that I I just know that it it does something to me. It's done something for me. And and I could never walk away from it. I could never let it go. In fact, I could preach about it all day long. But, you know, we need to make sure that we understand association matters. If we're going to associate with people that want to chatter, chatter, chatter, negative, negative, negative, guess what? It matters. &gt;&gt; And it matters a whole lot more than maybe we think if we're still doing it. &gt;&gt; We haven't got the revelation that it matters. But I'm telling you today, it matters a lot. &gt;&gt; It matters a lot. We know in this day, the ground opened up and swallowed all those people. Moses said, "Whoever's for God, come and stand with me." and anyone else. Hey, take your chances. And we know the earth opened up and swallowed them up. But, you know, I I don't want to dwell too much about that. I just want to say that those those daughters, they associated themselves with their daddy. Their daddy did not associate himself with unbelief. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He just simply maybe said to them, "You know what, honeys? Maybe you don't understand it. Maybe you can't explain it. I can't even explain it to you entirely. But what that does is it causes there to be a space for faith. It takes faith to believe the word of God. In fact, it's impossible to please God without faith. &gt;&gt; So, if we're going to try and explain it all away, then there's no room for faith. And I'll guarantee you, we're not pleasing God. &gt;&gt; Because we become scientists of the word. Scientist of the devil is what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Let's not get too far on that. But you know talking about association and how it matters. Brother Bradam he says now tonight why don't you accept not that natural life which has to go back with the dead substance of the earth. But why don't you accept the eternal life where he gave something, raised it up, his own son, that you could be conformed unto his own image &gt;&gt; by the renewing of your spirit. And we know the word of God says by the renewing of your mind to take away yours and to receive his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is the token that you have life. And you know, brothers and sisters, I know from experience that the devil's going to say to you, "But I don't I just don't want to give this up." And and I don't know, that's a little bit weird. I just don't think that I can possibly go there. I guarantee you that he is life and joy. &gt;&gt; I guarantee you if you ever taste of that heavenly gift, you will never want to go back. &gt;&gt; You will never want to go back. That's why it says in Hebrews chapter 6, for it's impossible for those who were once enlightened. It's impossible for those who've been enlightened to ever go back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They can't. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says to take away yours and receive his, which is the token that you have life, and he'll pass over you and will raise you up at the day of resurrection. This would be a real thanksgiving. This would show your gratefulness to God who made a way for you and placed eternal life before you upon his own table and is inviting you to it tonight. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he's still calling? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "How could you turn it away? How could you sit at the table and be grateful for natural foods in a tradition that our pilgrim fathers did on a Thanksgiving day? Why not now when it's made so clear to you tonight by this simple little way of preaching it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't you accept it now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And say, "I want that kind of life, Brother Brandham." &gt;&gt; I'll accept that. &gt;&gt; Jesus died for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And maybe I've joined church. I've had a creed. but really to see the life of Christ just pulsating in me. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, that's the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the life. That's the blood that we talked about from Exodus 12:12. That truly is the blood that will cause the death angel to pass over. Satan will have no hold over us. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not calling the death angel from Exodus 12:12 because it says, "I will pass over you." I'm not saying that he was Satan. I'm not saying that. What I am saying is that the devil is going about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that token, guess what? &gt;&gt; He can devour. &gt;&gt; He has full authority to to devour. If we don't have that token and that's why the prophet said that we need to be the token for our children. I'm always going to say that. We've got to Why don't you accept it now and say, "I want that kind of life, brother Brandham. I'll accept that Jesus died for me. And maybe I've joined church. I've had a creed. But really to see the life of Christ just pulsating in me till the world is dead and he living his life in me like he lived it here on earth. I don't see it, brother Brandham. And I want to have it. I want to be sure. &gt;&gt; I want to say it this morning. How many people want to be sure? How many of us want to have it? &gt;&gt; You know, it's good to reflect and and it's good to understand that there is an importance with identification having association like those daughters we talked about from numbers. I I think it's wonderful to think how brother Brady says that if we were to leave here this world if we left this world before next Thanksgiving again the day of thanksgiving that every day in our life shall be a thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That the world still lives that we are identified with him in death, burial and resurrection. &gt;&gt; You know association matters. It matters so much. It took me a long time to actually get here, but I know it. I can see it. I know some people are saying, "Yeah, Brother Barry, it's taken so long for you to get here. Would you just get there?" But I'm talking about in my life, in my Christian walk. It's taken me a while to get here. And I've been here for a while. Don't get me wrong. It's not a new revelation. But you know, we're talking about association and how important it is. The people in in Kora's day, they were swallowed up by the world. And and it's going to be the same thing in the day in which we live. If we're not actually willing to actually follow the word of God according to what he has given us through his prophet, then we will be swallowed up by the world. Our children will be swallowed up by the world. Our families will be swallowed up by the world. We'll still be alive and well. We might not be sick. We might not even be living in a hospital. We might not have tremendous vices in our lives. We might be productive members of society, but we're going to be spiritually void. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; We'll be completely controlled by the devil when he comes around and says, "I want you to do this." We'll be like, "I don't want to do it." Okay, let's do it. That's what will happen. But when we're saved, when the devil comes around, he still says the same thing. I want you to do it. You're going to be like, "Buzz off. What was I doing? Maybe reading the newspaper. He'll snap the paper and continue reading. He'll come and do it again. You'll be like, "Get lost." &gt;&gt; He'll come and do it again. He'll be like, "Oh my, in the name of Jesus, I rebuke you, Satan. &gt;&gt; Beat it." &gt;&gt; And then he'll be gone. &gt;&gt; There's overcoming power. That's the difference. &gt;&gt; But this association that we're talking about, there's no shortcuts to Jesus Christ in the day in which we live. to say that we believe God sent a prophet. He's a good man, but I'm just not going to actually follow his way. I'm going to go my way and say that I can get to Jesus just the same way. Sure enough, you can, but that's tribulation material. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he talks about this this scripture here, how association matters. It's very important. Matthewap 10:40. Matthew chap 10:40. Very, very familiar scripture. I'm sure it is for those people who believe the message. He said, "He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me." And we know that's Jesus speaking. And everyone can say, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; All of Christianity, all the denominations, they all relate to that right there. They say, "Amen." Because I receive you. Oh my. But here's where it gets down to brass tax. &gt;&gt; This is where the rubber meets the road. Verse 41. He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. &gt;&gt; Who doesn't want a prophet's reward today? &gt;&gt; And he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whosoever shall give drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water. Now listen to what he says here. He doesn't say in the name of a prophet. He doesn't say it in the name of Jesus. He says, "In the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward." &gt;&gt; Who's a disciple of Jesus today? &gt;&gt; The whole room should put their hands up. Yeah. Amen. We're disciples of Jesus. So, if anybody gives us a cup of cold water in the name of any one of us, &gt;&gt; look at this God that we serve. &gt;&gt; We've got every reason to rejoice. Hey, &gt;&gt; isn't that beautiful? But this part that I wanted to get to, he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Association matters. &gt;&gt; Association is very, very important. &gt;&gt; Saying that we believe the word of God, but I just don't believe this prophet all the way. &gt;&gt; What's a prophet's reward? Again, if you're interested, I know we have questions and answers, excuse me, on the apps, but sometimes the books are good. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; there's four sets in the back. What's a prophet's reward? It's a question that's asked directly. There's a whole bunch of section in there that's about scriptures. What does this scripture mean? What does that scripture mean? What does the other scripture mean? It's not all just questions and answers. But here we have this one. What's a prophet's reward? And I'm sure everybody knows what a prophet's reward is. I know that uh I I I I I hung on this for a long time and I do believe it's a part of it. I haven't given up on it. I haven't. But I always take what the prophet said above what I think. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Always. And you know, I I I I stuck with this where brother Bradom was over on the other side and and he had his horse nighing on his shoulder. Remember when he went beyond the curtain of time and he saw his dog Fritz and that one that was killed by that man, poisoned by that man, and you know, he heard that voice say that all you ever loved and all that ever loved you is going to be here. &gt;&gt; That's that's your prophet's reward. That's what you get. And and I can't help but think that's the same for the believers. &gt;&gt; But I could be wrong with that. I don't know. Is it going to matter whether my dead hamster's there from when I was six years old and I loved him so much and I had to realize what it meant that the things you love in this world, they have to die. Is that going to be there? I don't know. My dog chick, will she be there? I don't know. Is it going to matter? I don't know. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But what does matter? The prophet's reward. He that receiveth a prophet, the name of the prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. So what's the prophet's reward? Brother Brandham says it exactly, clearly, concisely, precisely. He says to be a friend of the prophet, &gt;&gt; that's the prophet's reward. &gt;&gt; So, what does that mean? Going to have your pet dog there, your hamster, your gerbal, your goldfish, whatever. Is that going to be the what what we're looking for? I don't think so. Brother Bradomy says it this way. He says to be a friend of the prophet, you you might need it someday. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might need it someday. And what does that mean? Even if you step back and think about it, he goes on to say, "Do you remember the Shounomite woman?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the context of this question, who was the Shounomite woman? She was the one that was praying that God would send her Elijah &gt;&gt; because she was going out to fix her last meal. Remember? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That was it. two sticks, put them together. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "Hey, you know what?" He came out of his place and he said to her, "Why don't you actually fix me some some food? I'm I'm I'm pretty hungry. I've been fasting for days since this brook slowly dried up and I got no more food. Why don't you fix me a cake first?" And she had the opportunity to accept that level. I'm going to put my life and my son's life into the hands of this man now, this prophet here. I'm going to say his life is more important than ours. &gt;&gt; What he says is more important. I'm going to stake our very existence on his word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many mamas would do that? &gt;&gt; She baked him a cake. And what happened? We know that she was blessed abundantly. &gt;&gt; But I want to take it out of there, brothers and sisters. I don't want it to be that far back. 2,000 years, 3,000 years, 1500 years, whatever, 1,700 years. I don't want to be there because it's good to talk about. It's good to reflect on. But association matters because she associated herself with that prophet's word. She received a prophet's reward. She was a friend of the prophet. Remember the other woman? She had a son. She had a husband. She didn't even have a son. She just had a husband. But what'd she say? You know what? This man of God, he keeps coming by. Let's just build him a little shed on the side of our house. Let's hard jointed together. Give him a bed, a place to rest. Give him some fresh water. give him a candle, maybe a chair and a desk to study by and a window to look out. Let's look after this guy. And what happened? She was able to receive her son. &gt;&gt; We know that that was a direct result of that. And then one day her son actually had a headache and died. What'd she do? She saddled an ass and she rode. She said, "I ain't letting anybody get in the way." And she went right directly to that prophet again. Why? because she was friends. Friends with that prophet to be a friend of the prophet is the answer. &gt;&gt; You might need it someday. &gt;&gt; You know, talking about the Shounomite woman of the days of old, what about the Shounomite woman of our generation? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; This is where it gets good, brothers and sisters. I think it's really really good because this Shounomite woman in the day in which we live, she never even heard of William Mary and Brham, had she? &gt;&gt; But yet somehow she was able to have a plane stop out of the air, &gt;&gt; land in an airport in her city, &gt;&gt; with a prophet, &gt;&gt; have the plane held, put him up overnight, and have something tell him to walk. &gt;&gt; That's right. But the beautiful thing is she was able to recognize him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you explain that? That's the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; How can we explain salvation to that one thief that was on the cross? He all he's going to say is, "I met Christ. I met this guy &gt;&gt; that one day &gt;&gt; on Calvary." &gt;&gt; And I think it's got to be the same way for us. We have to say that one day when I recognize the power of Calvary in my own life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that Shounomite woman praying for her son who was dying of a social disease was able to call Elijah on the scene. &gt;&gt; She did. &gt;&gt; Association matters. &gt;&gt; Cuz one day you might need it. &gt;&gt; We're going to pray to Jesus and Jesus is going to say, "I gave you the way. &gt;&gt; I gave you the truth and I gave you the life." Now, don't don't take what I'm saying and say that I'm saying we should pray to a prophet because that is blasphemous. &gt;&gt; That is antichrist. The only one we pray to is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But we're never going to access him the way we want to without him, without going through the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But this woman, she was able to she was able to access Jesus Christ without knowing about the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; It's pretty amazing. But I think it's just exactly what her prayer was. Send me my Elijah. Where is my Elijah? And how much more ought we to be having thanksgiving knowing that he has sent us, not only sent us, but we can recognize Elijah in the day in which we live. Even Elisha who followed him, Elisha, when he went to the waters and he had the mantle, what did he do? He took the mantle and he smoked the waters and he said, "What? Where is the God of Elijah?" Hebrews 13:8. Brothers and sisters, as we close, I can see I'm over time. I'll call the musicians. &gt;&gt; You know, I just believe that as we go forwards, every single day, this world is changing so swiftly. We see so many different behaviors taking place. The enemy is coming in like a flood. We can see it everywhere. &gt;&gt; There's legislation that's already tabled, already in parliament, &gt;&gt; working towards changing the way that we function as a church. &gt;&gt; It's actually in Parliament right now, &gt;&gt; working on being passed as a law. &gt;&gt; And what that is is to destroy the charter, the charter of the what is it? the the society to be able to have the the the charitable organization is what it is to eliminate those statuses. If you actually have anything to do about coming against the LGBTQ movement, if you have any of that hate speech, then they're working on actually destroying it, saying that you're not a valid uh organization anymore. And that's the beginning of the end where they will close the doors of these churches, brothers and sisters. Because we ain't never going to, as long as I'm here anyways, we ain't never going to say that's right. &gt;&gt; We're going to say that's wrong because that's the word of God. &gt;&gt; It is absolutely abomination before the eyes of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But you know, we're in a time of decision and every single day is just a series of decisions, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It is. That's all we we do is make decisions in our lives every day. We make a decision to live or die. &gt;&gt; That's what we do. We make a decision to live or die. And that's naturally and spiritually. &gt;&gt; In a time of decision, brother Brandham, he says, maybe stand with me as we close today. He says, "Don't care if this one walks or that one walks. I'm going to walk anyhow. I don't care whether this one if what they say. I I they can call me anything they want to. So, I'm going anyhow. Why? &gt;&gt; The life is in the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same exact blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was shed on Calvary. The life is in the blood. The same exact blood that was shed before the foundation of the world that we talked about as a type in the book of Exodus today. The very same blood. The life is in the blood. And the life is in the church. The Christian that's born again by the spirit of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where the life is. The life is not inside this building. &gt;&gt; But even though we're inside this building, that life is inside this building. But as soon as we all leave, &gt;&gt; we take his life with us. &gt;&gt; They can call me anything they want to. I'm going anyhow. Why? The life is in the blood. And the life is in the church. And the Christian that's born again by the spirit of God. That's the spirit of life. Blood relation to Christ. The spirit of Christ in the blood of Christ leading a child of Christ. The seed of Abraham. The royal seed of Abraham. That's what the royal seed of Abraham is. Somebody who has that life inside of them. That's why they move peculiar peculiarly. That's why the world thinks so strange of them. And that's why it feels like we don't ever want to go there because that's just a little bit fanatical. That's just a little bit weird. We'll never be comfortable in this life. I can tell you, you will never be more comfortable in this life. Not because this world feels comfortable, but because you have that blessed assurance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you know that you know that you know if your time has come to actually cross over, if your number is picked, if your flower is clipped, if you're going to go, you know that you're not going to actually perish. He says, "And remember Rebecca hardly knowing what she was doing. And yet she watered the same animal, the camel that was to take her to the bridegroom to her husband, her lover. And always a beast burdened in the Bible represents power like the beast come up out of the sea. In Revelation, it was a power that raised up among people. And this beast being watered. Rebecca watering the same beast that she rode on that taken her away from her place here to her new home is a type of the church today. Watering and blessing the same Holy Spirit that's going to lift it up and take it to its new home. Remember brothers and sisters, the blessing, blessings fall at the end of the service. That's where hearts are changed. The word has gone forth and we have the opportunity to water that word with our praise. Remember the prayer lines, they didn't start at the front of the services with brother Brandham. Why is that? We know why. It's always at the end. But we have the opportunity to water that Holy Spirit. That Holy Spirit that's going to lift it up and take it to its new home. The church that's praising and blessing and watering with thanksgiving to the Holy Ghost who has brought the word to you. &gt;&gt; We have the opportunity to water that same Holy Ghost today. &gt;&gt; God richly bless you, brothers and sisters. I trust you have a wonderful weekend of thanksgiving. And as we fellowship around our tables, I just want to encourage us to remember remember Christ. Remember the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because of that, we have every single reason to be thankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you today. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for your goodness to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that we have your word, Lord, that we've been given the ability to receive it in its fullness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we know that through that it begins to live out through us. &gt;&gt; We don't want to make excuses for it. And Father, if we've ever made excuses for it, we pray that you would forgive us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Lord Jesus, this morning I just want to ask, Father, if there's anybody here, Lord, that is struggling in their mind, in their heart, Father, that just hasn't been able to come to that place where they can know you in the power of your resurrection. Father, I pray that in the name of Jesus, you would set them free according to your word. Father, that they would be able to step out of that that bondage that they've been held under and realize that they truly are a a son or a daughter of the most high God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Father, I pray that a a season of of thanksgiving would begin to take place in their life, Father, where they would just, Lord Jesus, be able to look to you and recognize what you've done all the way along in their lives. Oh father, when we come to that place of a new birth, we can see your hand in our lives from the very beginning all the way up. So many things happen in our lives that we just can never explain. And Lord, once we get saved, we can do it. We can say that was you &gt;&gt; truly your hand in our lives. You have kept us by your goodness and your mercy. And we thank you for it, Lord. Thank you for your word and the ability to receive it in the day in which we live now. Father, we pray that you would just go with us, Lord, as we go our separate ways. But before we do, Lord, we pray that you would just receive some worship from our hearts, Lord. That it would be truly from your throne back to you, Lord Jesus, the throne room of our hearts. Father, we pray that you would be with those who couldn't be here today, wherever they are, whatever they're doing, Lord, we just ask that you would bless them abundantly, Father, above all they could ask or think. And if it's your will for us to gather again on Wednesday, Lord, we'll be happy to do so. &gt;&gt; We just love you and we thank you. We ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Can we sing 12:12? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Exodus 12:12. Hey, the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love you, Lord, for your mercy never fails me. All my days I've been held in your hands, from the moment that I wake up until I lay my head, I will sing. of the goodness of God. Amen. All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. Every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire.
