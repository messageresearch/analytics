have a testimony um ever since we came here like the last time there was a youth I and we were announced that there was going to be a banquet I was really excited and I was wanting to come but um just last week a certain like a certain type of like discouragement came over me and I just felt like I wanted to fund every excuse not to come and like I would tell my friend at work I don't think I'm gonna be coming and then I all of a sudden I got a cold and then I got an excuse that you know what I have a cold I'm not gonna come I don't want to get anyone sick and everything else but um on Wednesday uh I was listening to a sermon and there's something that was said like that really like stuck out to me and then I read it to my friend at work and the testimony is that like in the line of what I I had read um brother Toby spoke about it yesterday um so he spoke about purified purified for service or purifying for service and where I was reading is um it's a message from Brother Branham where it the title of the message is if God be with us then where are the Miracles and on uh the 1616 paragraph it says take the cloud away then what happens the sun is right there the only thing on the only thing you have to do today see not oh Jesus come and heal me oh Jesus give me the Holy Ghost just take the cloud away he's already there he came he he come um 1900 years ago and he still there and he'll always be there I'm Alive forevermore the same yesterday to Dan forever and that goes in line with what brother Toby was saying about purifying yourself like most of the time we're asking ourselves do I have the Holy Spirit do I have this but there's a lot that we need to get rid of in order to even get to him because he already gave it in the like when he came and died for us there's a lot of things that he had already done for us and um I also wanted to thank Sister Lisa for the activity that she did because it's one of the reasons that I'm gonna be singing I was not gonna sing the song I was also discouraged to sing the song but um through the fellowship that we had I got to talk to a young sister and um it pushed me to want to sing this song even more so um bear with me I have a cold so I speak the name of Jesus over you and you're hurting in your Sorrows I speak the name of God I speak the name of Jesus over you in your hurting in your Sorrows I asked my God

good to be here in this service the atmosphere of the Lord Thou Art Worthy he certainly is Worthy of all of our praise as we turn the service to our pastor [Music] Thou Art Worthy O Lord [Music] to receive Glory foreign [Music] Hallelujah God bless you this morning welcome to the house of the Lord I just want to thank everyone for the specials this morning truly an honor and a privilege to be in his presence and we all know that as we sing we welcome him I just want to thank everyone for your prayers I uh as most of you know I had a fall this week and you know the Lord was good I met with the doctor and it was strange I'll just explain what happened I I slipped and fell on Wednesday and I just felt bruised I didn't feel any issue and I just carried about my life but Thursday about supper time I was busy doing something and I just Twisted a certain way and I heard a pop and I felt a pop and the thing that I thought was a bruise in my rib was actually a lot more than what I thought and so I went to emergency and the doctor told me you have a broken rib and so he's given me medication and uh I'm okay so I so long as I'm on the medication the pain isn't very strong but I just thought it would be safe to invite brother Toby to see if he wanted to expound upon maybe the Youth Event last night so we'll just see what the Lord has in store with our brother there but I do want to thank everyone for your prayers the Lord's been good to me the doctor put it into perspective when I told him I think I have a broken rib he said is that all said yeah I think that's all certainly wonderful sometimes just to take a step back and and look at our lives and recognize that the Lord is so good to us isn't he maybe if you have a need this morning just make it known to him with an uplift hand we just have one request from the Carpenters I believe it's a friend of brother Jerry's daughter that we've prayed for or not daughter sister or nice I'm sorry in Florida her name is Kimberly Petty it's it's for the Jerry's niece's friend Kimberly Petty she was in a motorcycle accident and is in serious conditions so let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we just love you and we thank you for your goodness to us Lord we know that there's no condition in this world that can stop your word from coming to pass father we thank you for your goodness to us this morning Lord Jesus we just want to come before your throne of mercy and Grace and just remember every need Lord made known unto you this morning Father Lord we've come Desiring to hear from you and we know that that desire Lord isn't something that we just learned about it's not something that we just came up with on our own it's something that you placed within us before the foundation of the world and Lord Jesus we have come here this morning to manifest that desire Lord to hear more from you Lord Jesus this morning we pray that you would just touch Kimberly Petty father in the name of Jesus Lord that you would just make yourself known unto her father that she could come to know you in the power of your Resurrection father Lord we know these bodies they will be broken we need to lay these bodies down father but there's one thing of Eternal value when that's our soul lord Jesus we heard about that on Wednesday and father we just ask that Lord you would help us to just purify our souls once again today Lord we pray for the service in Spruce Grove Lord that you would just anoint brother Mervin father that you would speak to him and through him Lord this morning and this evening father and Lord this morning we just ask for a special measure of Grace Lord as you use brother Toby and you speak to us through Him Father we'll be careful to give you all the praise we just love you and we

morning welcome to church um I want to say thank you to brother very forgiving me the opportunity to be here speaking this morning I don't think anyone is here to see me or to hear me we're here to hear from the Lord and we trust that the Lord is here to bless us thank you musicians thanks for setting the atmosphere thank you for the fall as well and for all the specials that were wonderful just before we read the scripture I just want to acknowledge some visitors in our midst brother tolu sister dolapo bang boy they're originally from Nigeria and there they have three kids Ron Jesse and Nathan you're welcome and uh God bless you I think we didn't get the chance to get their names earlier so brother Peter just go there and give it to me let's just quickly turn on the scriptures this morning to Romans chapter 8. very familiar scripture I don't want to have you sit and make you stand again so we'll just read the scriptures and I'll have you take your seat I'm going to start reading from verse 31 and I'll read you verse 39. if you don't mind just giving me some volume on the monitors so I don't find myself screaming all right so um verse 31 says what shall we then say to these things and we know this was false speaking right into the Romans said if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything against anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth we see that condemneth it is Christ that died year rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also makeeth into session for us he said who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or farming or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all those things we are more than conquerors it said through him that loved us for I am persuaded like neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities no powers no things present no death nor sorry no things present no things to come no height no death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord let's just vow to pray before we take us it's their father the hour is here Lord Jesus Christ where we are going to hear from you what you have to say to us today we know Lord Jesus Christ that before the foundation of the world you knew about today you knew about the state of every life that is present here you know the needs in our lives Lord Jesus at this very moment Lord Jesus and we know Lord Jesus that you have provided that Lord Jesus which is required to meet our needs this morning we ask that you open up our hearts yourself Lord Jesus may you take me out of the way father Lord Jesus May the Holy Spirit by inspiration speak to the hearts of your people may I be blessed as well Lord Jesus through those words that you are going to speak to us may we leave this place rejoicing for in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may have your sin just so anyone else not nervous I know this preaching is starting late but I would not take time at all so just uh sit down relax and trust that the Lord will speak with us this morning this morning I want to bring the title God is responsible for you and I don't know what that means to you but I was thinking about it I guess yesterday if you were trying to go on vacation and you were trying to save money and you know the bills are just too many you're not able to make it and just out of the Blues someone offers you an all-expensed paid trip to Hawaii you're not going to worry about saving money anymore what you desired in your heart you are no more responsible for it someone else is paying the bills someone else is taking up the cost someone else is responsible for your trip and if you work in a company that you know will send you overseas to to do some work some official work you know that you don't have to worry about the the ticket I mean the very first time I flew a business class it was it was so good I was going for um was supposed to be an official trip in in the UK then I was in Nigeria and I flew British Airways and when I sat in the business class and I started to get the business class service I was feeling like a big man people that saw me would think that I had the money you know that someone else that bought the ticket themselves had but it was not my responsibility it was the responsibility of this company that was sending me on an official duty to buy the ticket to put me in that flight and I enjoyed all the benefits I didn't have to be the one that paid for it but I enjoyed the benefits now this morning I'm saying to you that the god of Heaven the one that created heaven and earth is responsible for you I don't know if there's anything that should make you fear when you come to a realization that the god of Heaven is responsible for your life the brother Brian said in this message and this is a quote that if you have the privilege to book Market I will recommend that you bookmark it and always go back to it the message the great Shining Light brother Brahm says but it gives us consolation to know this that we do not hold our destiny god holds our destiny and he has ordained it to be so and there is nothing nothing we just read that now Paul told us he said there is I'm persuaded that neither debt nor life nor angels no principalities no powers no things present no things to come nor height nor deaths don't any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God and but the brand said there is nothing will ever interrupt the program of God nothing we interrupt the program of God he said we are bound to arrive oh this makes me feel good nothing we interrupt the program of God you know as humans many times we see our life in a limited uh uh uh from a limited lens I'll say we look at the present we look at the immediate past we look at we anticipate the immediate future but when God looks at our lives God is looking at his entire Plan of Redemption we're going to get to it but I want you to know this morning that before the foundation of the world God had a plan and as God was laying out that plan from when time will begin from when he said let there be light God laid out that plan from the beginning of time to the end of time which makes it from eternity to Eternity and when God was laying out that plan for each of his children God had a space for you in that plan from the moment when you were born to all through your life to the moment it will take you home or take you in the Rapture God was very detailed about the plan what does that mean there is nothing that is happening in your life that is outside of that Clan as a matter of fact if something is happening in your life that is not in that plan that means the plan of God is about to be defeated and the purpose of God cannot be defeated you believe that same amen this morning we see God demonstrate this to people and I was having a conversation with my dad on the phone yesterday just fellowshipping around the world and one of the things I said I said Dad I said it's interesting to know that you know the Bible will tell us that all the things in the scriptures were written for our examples and we can always go back to it but the man will tell us that if you see what God has done for something for someone before it gives you the opportunity it gives you the it gives you the Assurance to know that God that did that for that person upon the basis of the faith of that person if you come upon the same basis God will do the same for you and we know that there's this character in The Bible called Joseph was a dreamer he was born a dreamer he did not make himself a dreamer but God made a more prophet and by the way of her dream God was showing him his future now just there was so little to understand what was going on in his life was probably confused and as any little child will go and tell their dream sometimes it could be a nightmare and for Joseph that might have been very close to a nightmare they got to tell their siblings they go to tell their parents I had the street so Joseph went and told his parents I had a dream and told the siblings I had a dream I had a dream I saw myself we were all in in the field and and we all took our sheaves and and you laid your sheep down mine was there and all of you were bowing down to mine and then he had another dream he said he saw the sun and the moon and Eleven stars bowing down to him he didn't understand what this was but when he related his dream to the people that were supposed to understand people that were close to him he brought hatred for most of them they started to to to to resent that dream they started to hate him for that dream and Joseph didn't understand what was going on God was expressing to Joseph what was going to happen in his future and if Joseph you know were to anticipate how that was going to happen Joseph would not have seen everything that was in between so many times we are like Joseph we think that when God makes us a promise God fulfilling that promise is going to be a flowery bed of roses but that is not how it is because when God laid out that plan God ensured that there were Hills and Valleys there was day and night when God laid out that plan because God was trying to ensure that all that you require to bring you to that perfect purpose oh wonderful we're having a conversation on Friday night talking about the shepherd the Good Shepherd psalm 23. and if you go back and read I guess just six verses of that chapter you will realize that everything that was being said about the shepherd was showing how the shepherd is responsible for the Sheep now not all of the things sounded good for the Sheep when when David will say that he he he lead at me in the path of righteousness for example and again it now comes and says he takes me through the valley of the shadow of death that's no fun at all but that's part of the plan now the purpose of the shepherd the ultimate purpose of the shepherd is to ensure that that sheep can come to its full potential we as parents know what that means when we're raising our kids sometimes coming to full potential requires some spanking and I'm not advocating that you have to beat up your kids that's not what I'm saying here but sometimes it also requires some denial when your child will say Mommy I want this and you know that this is not good for the child the child does not understand that he's not good for them but you have a superior understanding and because you want the full potential of that child to come to pass in the future you deny them of that it's a way of showing love and the father a Heavenly Father shows us love many times just as he was doing to Joseph the Pastor Joseph becoming a ruler the path to Joseph having his brothers and and his mother and the father bow before him like he saw in the dream was not going to be a flowery bed of roses it was going to be the Crooked ways it was going to be the Lawson Park when it was it was going to find himself as a slave to the hidden God had given them a promise God had given Abraham the promise your sister possess the gates of their enemies and that would have been related down from from from the generations down to Joseph that was what the word says but the same enemies are taking him captive and was supposed to be a slave to them but one thing that God does all through our life's journey God will ensure that his presence is always felt I like what Mr Queen said this morning and that's quote that she read we just got to take away the cloud and we're going to see that the sun is there so sometimes God takes us through those experiences where it seems as if God is not there but you just take away the cloud and you will see that is the ever present help in the time of trouble so just have found himself in Egypt it was light against it was rejected it had hot trials he had testings all of this was part of the plan Joseph was not responsible for himself Joseph was not responsible for himself to come out of prison as a matter of fact Joseph was trying to help himself when those two servants of pharaoh that were in the in in the prison with him when they had their dreams and Joseph came and told them what okay this is the meaning of your dream and he came to pass just exactly and he had told the bot lab please when this happens don't forget me but God made the bottler to forget because the revealing of Joseph the revealing of the gifts in Joseph to Pharaoh was for an appointed time if it came earlier if if Joseph came out of the prison earlier than that it would have been before the dream it would have been before Pharaoh's dream but God signed it God made sure it was perfect God made the butler to forget so that when the time of need came when the King was looking for someone to interpret his dream it would be at that time that the butler will remember oh my Lord the king I'm ashamed of myself there was a man I met in prison and this man told me the meaning of my dream and this man can help you as well so God was watching over his word to perform it abacock tells us set for the vision is yet for an appointed time he said but at the end it shall Speak oh what Vision has the Lord given you that seem to linger what is that request you've placed before the Lord that seemed to linger and it seems as if it's not going to happen but he's telling us this morning but at the end it shall speak and not lie God is not a man that he should lie neither is he a son of man that she should repent we're having a conversation with the young people yesterday and the fact that when you grow up in the message it's a little bit different from someone that comes from the outside your Christian work because you've lived your life in such a way that it aligns with the word of God you've been obedient to your parents and you get to a point you're finding a difficult so think of what you can repent of because in actual fact you've done everything right and when you do something wrong you make it right and according to the word of God you're forgiven but sometimes we dwell in our self-righteousness and that becomes an hindrance for God to work in our lives for God to reveal himself to us so regardless of what you're going through regardless one of the things you should remember is that before the foundation of the world got planned out your life now God gave us a clue what the end will be he made us understand that your end is coming to perfection is to be conformed to the image of the Son of God and you're going to go through things that look totally different from that you're going to go through situations that will make you feel that that will never happen but he's telling you this morning though it's tari he said You shall do what wait for it it could be hard to wait think about those virtues in First Peter chapter 2. and the one I find you know as I'll call it a milestone of our growth as Christians as patients but the brand was saying in Statue of perfect blood he said what is patience he said patience with God and patience with man sometimes it's hard to be patient with God because we want God to do it right away and when it comes to being patient with men speak to the couples it's hard right it's hard to be patient with your husband it's hard to be patient with your wife God knows how to do it I've noticed that in many marriages God will bring two unlike poles together if you're very organized very likely your wife is not why will God do that but why will God do that because God the institution of marriage is a place for development it's a place for learning we understand why it's I mean you wonder why it's called an institution because it's a place of learning it's a place of building character and if you talk to those that have been married for years sometimes when they talk to the younger ones they'll just tell them you know you need to calm down oh is she going to change well she might not change well you'll get used to it and that's what happens because God brings us there to make us to develop character so all of those things they are planned out by God remember the title this morning is that God is responsible and if there's anyone that can actually make a plan that works then it's God you know I think about David I don't think there's any time I preach I don't talk about David because the life of David is just so much of a lesson to us but also a an expression of the grace of God an expression of God's blessings an expression of God's attributes various attributes that God expressed through David but you know that David was just an ordinary Shepherd boy turned into the Sheep at the backside of the desert and he must have been having some experience with God as we read on the terms and we'll know that God was actually teaching David about himself using nature God knows how to use what you know to express himself to you if you're a musician God can use music to express himself to you because he knows that that is something that you're familiar with so God was doing that to David expressing himself to David in in the wilderness in in the field David will talk about the creation of God he will talk about the greatness of God he will talk about the Sun the Moon it will talk about those Stars it will talk about all the creation of God how they were expressing God because God was revealing himself to David and when King Saul did something that God said was unpardonable for him at least when it comes to the decision of the Kingdom God sent Samuel the prophet to go and anoint David and we know the stories I'm not going to go into it but when Samuel anointed David one of the things I want you to realize we don't often talk about it but it took about 20 years before that promise was fulfilled took 20 years David was anointed king the anointing was upon him but between the time he was anointed king and when he really became king of Israel was about 20 years what was happening in between God gave him some victories that's that's good sometimes it gives us that it killed Goliath all the women were shouted and praising and saying Saul has killed his thousands but David has killed his ten thousands that would have made him feel proud that was that was a a an assurance to him again that God was with him that was a sign that that anointing that came from the prophet was right and was true but yet again just after that the king that David was servants to King Saul started to persecute him how do you explain that but that was all in the plan of God many times we want God to do things right at the time when he promised that he was going to do it sometimes we don't want to wait but God has a plan God is responsible for every step of the way so David got to a point where you had to look back at this creature and realized that there was a man before his time whose name was Joseph who also had to wait on the Lord because if we go and and you know look at Sam 105 verse 17 to 19 David was writing about Joseph he said the center man before them even Joseph who was sold for his servants whose feet they hurt with Fetters it was laid in Iron until the time that his word came God is the one that watcheth over his word to perform it what does that mean when God says something God takes responsibility for what he has said and God watches over that word as events start to unfold God is watching over that word waiting for the word to get to its point of manifestation and God ensures that he comes to pass just as he said it would as God made a promise to you this morning wait for it and when it comes to God making promises it applies to everything in our lives you want a new job God can give it to you you're going through some trials in your life there's a sickness there's something that's wrong with you there's something the wrong that's wrong with a loved one if you come to God upon the basis of his word God will do it for you is this promise whatever you desire I don't know how I'm feeling this morning but I'm just feeling so much Faith right here that whatever you desire whatever you desire if you've never desired it before if it's right now you're Desiring it lay a stick at this moments and say God you made this promise you will bring it to pass so why do we know that God is responsible for us what makes us know that God is not just watching us living our lives and being that's that's Headmaster or that's that principle that will just show up when we've done something wrong or that Taskmaster the Brahm said let's take a trip to before the foundation of the world when God was by himself he said it was not God at that time it was Elohim because there was no one to worship him he had not made any creature to worship Him it was when God was by himself that God had attributed himself God has the attributes to be a father God has the attributes to be a Healer God has the attribute he had the desire he had the potential to be a redeemer to be a husband to be the king of kings to be the mighty conqueror all of this were Desires in the heart of God and many more things so to fulfill that desire God started to lay out a plan God let our plan part of that plan was God was going to create angels part of that plan was God was going to make Man In His Image in his likeness it was going to make the spirit man and as we're learning Genesis chapter 2 God was going to put that spirit in a flesh body and God was going to bring out of that man the feminine part and the man was going to call her the woman in that plan was to fall but Ibraham said that God made us free moral agencies what does that mean God brought us God God brought us to this earth and gave us the the the the the the the the choice The Power of Choice you know he can make a choice but God also had a full knowledge so God knew the ending right from the beginning and when God did that part of that plan was the four was going to happen and our Plan of Redemption was set in place now when God was writing that Plan of Redemption he had you in that plan so he set out that Plan of Redemption in that Plan of Redemption there was election and what is election election tells us that God was going to elect a certain group of people now God is Not unfair and unjust just as I've said a moment ago God did his election by foreknowledge God is Not cherry picking and saying this will go to heaven that will go to Perdition no God knew the egg from the beginning and when God saw the ones that will accept him what did God do God put a stamp to it God predestinated them what is predestination I'd like to explain it this way it's a pre-de predetermination of your destination determination of your destiny where the Bram cell told us that quote I read he said that god holds our destiny we are bound to arrive so God knew that before the foundation of the world that this person this boy this girl would give their life to me they'll serve me they might go through trials they might go in sin they will repent they will come back to me and God put a stamp to it that this will happen and in that kind of redemption like I said before there was the form why did God allow the fall God knew that without the fall he could not express his attribute of being a Healer because there won't be sickness it says to Germaine is here this morning trusting the Lord for healing but that was part of the plan we as humans will look at it and we'll say why is this woman suffering why can't God just God I've read this happening to her and just keep her imperfect and all the days of our life but that was part of his plan because he wants to be a Healer brother said if no one is sick there is no one for God to heal but God takes us through those trials brings the sicknesses upon us so that we can depend on him and then he can express that attribute of being a Healer wanted to be a savior so people had to sin he also wanted to be a deliverer in times when we cannot help ourselves when we come to our wheat cent Peter we tell us he said that the trial of your faith being more precious than gold but I didn't I had the first time I had the opportunity to go to South Africa I was my colleague and I were in the car being driven by or driver and we were driving on the highway and I saw this like a hilly place on the left and I was asking the driver where is that he just looks like mountains Hills and he said well that is where they are mining gold I was like wow this doesn't look desirable at all just look like red sand or something it doesn't look like gold but when a human being who God gave the wisdom to understand that that can be something that becomes precious goes there and extracts it it's got to take it through a process is going to take you through the refiners fire it has to take everything that is unlike the substance that is looking for because what we were seeing at that um right there um on the left on the highway was not gold was inside it but that wasn't gold and that's how our lives are when the Lord calls us manifests us here we are not yet in the image of Christ but God is extracting that image out of us taking out everything that is unlike him so that we can be fully conformed to His Image ultimately so Peter was telling us here he said the trial of your faith is much more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire so he's telling us that the trying of our faith when you compare that to gold gold is gold is very it's very it's Priceless almost it's pricey people spend a lot of money on it some people get obsessed with it they use their money to buy so much gold much more than they require thank God our sisters don't wear jewelries at least except the husband gives them something necklace Bill Graham said is okay but you realize that women that were hearings that were chains on their legs that were they spent so much money on gold and I mean back back in Nigeria if if someone boggles your house the first thing they are looking for is gold because they can make a lot of money from it we even know that the currency the what we probably will call the currency of the Roman Catholic Church is gold the only app the largest amount of gold so it's it is actually precious from Human understanding it's pricing from Human understanding but Peter is telling us here that that in terms of value you cannot compare that with your trials what does this mean it means that God sees more value in the trials that he allows to come our lives than the value that we see in gold can you think about that for a moment the trials of my life I don't I don't value it I don't even want it was a song with my my wife was singing and he said sometimes you need to be you need to be careful of the kind of sounds you sing and I can't remember the song we had to do with God try me in the fire refine me and she was singing and she was getting scared if God were to refine me I said but God has to refine us we really need to get refined otherwise we can't be like him but Abraham said that that Goldsmith we continue to refine the gold until when it starts to see his reflection in the gold so refine us fire yes we all need it because that trial that we are getting it's more precious than gold tried in the fire so everything that is happening in your life was all planned out by God what does that mean for the believer no regrets but the brand said a Christian will never lose what does that mean there's nothing that happens in your life like oh I wish this never happened no it was part of the plan what do we have to do just trust the process trust the shepherd earlier on in the chapter we read Paul says that and we know that all things work together for the good for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose so if anything is not working for your goods that is altering the plan of God and that cannot happen the plan of God cannot be altered he said for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren so now we see that the reason why God brought us here as I've said before is that we be conformed to the image of his son remember I said as well that the purpose of the shepherd lead on the Sheep through various terrains is so that that ship can come to its full potential if the ship is being raised for the wool the shepherd will do everything possible to be sure that the wool comes out at the right time and he gets the maximum amount of wool that he can get if he's been raised you know for the meat is going to be sure that it comes to the size that is good enough for him to be able to get into the market and sell it at a good price bringing out the full potential of the Sheep but many times they are crooked ways they're rough paths there are ups and downs the things that we don't want in our lives that God we allow and that's why I always refer to that song only believe one of the verses said your Shepherd selected the path you must tread when you talk about selection it means that there were all the choices there were other choices that looked better to us but what did he do he looked at the one that he sees the best because he knows the end from the beginning so whenever you find yourself in a situation the right question to ask is not why me the right question to ask is will this situation lead me to becoming more conforms to the image of Christ if it's going to lead me to be more like Jesus if by time I've fallen and Rising will be so that I can have character and be like Jesus then that is the best for me that is working according to plan and I was looking up the song goodness of God and the person that wrote it the couple that wrote it I think it was a woman and uh the the story behind the song is not so much I mean it's not like very phenomenal but it had to do with this couple they were they had just adopted their fourth child and I think they they've had like couple of their they had their own children biological children I think and this was the second one they were adopted and she was just driving down you know after picking up the boy and she was just thinking about all the process of the adoption and that was when that song dropped in our hearts the goodness of God and started she started painting that down she was on the long Country Road just driving and thinking about the faithfulness and the kindness of God and I was thinking about how much that song has blessed people around the world today there's hardly anywhere you go to you will not hear it being sang most of the places most of our services we sing that song but that song came out of someone reflecting on their life and not seeing the negative but seeing the positive I know like process of adoption is is not an easy process because they're thinking about the child is this the right child this is the right family to get this child from I was not at the Men's breakfast but I heard about you know brother um Gilbert talking about you know like the genealogies and blessings or curses that could be passed on from Generations and a family trying to adopt a child will have all these considerations I said what he had to do was to wait on the Lord pray for to the Lord and let the Lord guide them to which child to adopt and after they had gone through this process at the end of it she was thinking about the goodness and the kindness of God and then she decided to write that song and that's what it should be for us that we look at our lives the way God sees us I've read this quote before and I'm just closing right now so I told you I was going to close early how many people are happy about that because people look tired and sleepy so let's just close and go home and have lunch right no but I wasn't going to stay long with you anyway still I read this quote before the water of Separation but the brand said that you are redeemed because he always sees you through Christ it's time for us to stop looking at ourselves from a human lens it's time for us to start looking at ourselves from the lens of God the way God sees us it does tremendous things in your life when that starts to happen because Satan will not be able to lie to you anymore your things in your life that looks real you have a weakness and Satan is pointing you to it this is your weakness you cannot tell me that you did not do this but that's not how God sees you is simple the one who is is scoring the exam right you write a paper you write an exam right and the teacher said the exam and your colleague is telling you your classmate is telling you you got that answer wrong But the teacher said you got it right who's right the teacher so that's that is what it is here when God says we are perfect Satan has no say and the moment we realize he has no say the quicker we'll put him in this position and we've heard before where is the position of the devil under our feet that's where you know I love that I can't remember he said very repeated it as well if he's not under your feet then you are out of your position so if you find out that it's not under your feet you get in your position and automatically you'll find Satan is under your faith because that is where he belongs when the ram said that's the reason we can be perfect is that not perfect in the sense of sinless we are perfect in the eyes of God when we are in Christ so what's the question today am I in Christ not self-righteousness but am I in Christ if I'm in Christ then I am sinless by his definition I am sinless oh you said I still did this thing wrong yesterday the question I ask is how did you feel when you did that thing wrong were you comfortable with it maybe this will help the young people because this is the lie that Satan told me I talked about it yesterday but when God is giving you the Holy Ghost you receive it by faith now Satan will lie to you that from that point on you're supposed to be a hundred percent perfect in your flesh and that is a lie because you've never seen a baby that's born that they start to talk on the day that they were born there is a growth process Peter told the young believers he said as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word when it's time for you to have milk be satisfied with milk don't try to eat meat it will kill you so let our expectations be right when God fills you with the Holy Ghost is enlisting you into his army brother Brahm said that King and land is not the Millennium why but the prayer said that many times why because there's fighting that happens when you cross Jordan which is a type of you Crossing to receive the Holy Ghost into the promised land you've got to fight for every inch of ground so when you find yourself doing that bad thing again what is the desire in your heart that's the question that's the proof whether you've got the holy ghost or not why if you desire to still do it again then you need to check yourself but if when you did it you couldn't wait to repent of it then ask yourself what is making you wanting to repent it's a desire in you it is the spirit of God in you that is telling you this that I've done wrong I cannot wait I've got to repent of it right now so when that happens and Satan comes tell Satan that the desire to repent is not my desire the desire to repent on my sins is the desire that God has placed in my heart and I know that tomorrow is going to give me the strength it's like you're climbing a mountain there are steps when you climb this step you trust that by the grace of God you're not going to fall off to to the step you've already passed you trust that you're going to keep going and moving forward but Abraham said that's the reason he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect Perfection come by Jesus Christ said now I'm not perfecting your sight and like brother but I'm talking about it here this way because it makes us understand that the ram is not talking about perfection by works he said now I'm not perfect in your sights you may not be perfect in my sights he said but what about in God's side that's where it lays and if you're born again into the body of Christ then God looks upon you as perfect as Christ was himself nothing you can do it's not by works that you can do at all it's by grace God has given you this offer and if you've accepted it in the sight of God you are perfect God gives you the offer if you accept it in the sight of God you are perfect you are redeemed you're washed in the blood of the Lamb but the man said you are without fault without blemish you are without spots I'll call the musicians now but that's how Christ wants us to see ourselves is responsible for us The Plan of Salvation was completed before the foundation of the world it was done it was closed it was sealed for a while we are living in the day and age where this plan has been fully unveiled revealed to us the seals have been broken why were they broken so that we can know the mind of God Amos told us he said the secret things of God belong to God but the things that God will choose to reveal they belong to us and our children so if the sales has been revealed my question is what is that to you what has that told you have you found your name in the book have you seen your life in that Plan of Redemption that God did not just bring you here for fun that God is ordering your footsteps according to his perfect Plan before the foundation of the world and it's going to bring it to pass you believe that this morning believe that this morning are we feeling cold looks like the weather is it snowing outside yet all right let's be on our feet this morning spend some time to Worship the Lord this morning let's sing that song Maybe the goodness of God just express your appreciation to him just before I turn it over to the pastor God's Plan of Redemption he decided to have you I look at

death nor life nor angels principalities no powers no things present no things to come nor a height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus whatever you've encountered in your life whatever you will encounter never ever get to a point where you think that God doesn't love you nothing can separate you from his love nothing can make him to stop loving you if he loses you you will have lost a part of himself and God cannot lose a part of himself you are so precious to him you're more precious than gold stride in the fire he allows those trials to come your way not because he's displeased with you but because he wants to achieve something that will bring glory to his name and will bring you benefits as well a single song
