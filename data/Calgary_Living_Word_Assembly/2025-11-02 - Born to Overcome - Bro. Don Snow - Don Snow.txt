Description:
Born to Overcome
Poem by Bro. Don Snow

Before the dawn had kissed the world,
before the stars took flame,
He knew your heart, He called your soul,
He spoke and wrote your name.
His Word was planted deep within,
His life your living sum 
You always was, you always are,
a child born to overcome.

When you first breathed that newborn air
and learned to walk and fall,
His hand was near though you knew not
the One who guided all.
Through childhood dreams and wandering steps,
His light would softly come 
For deep within the seed declared,
You’re born to overcome.

You chased the world, you played its games,
You sought its fleeting prize,
But mercy found you where you fell
and opened up your eyes.
Though you were lost in shadow’s hold,
His purpose still would run,
For what was sown before all time
must rise to overcome.

In youth you stumbled, failed, and wept,
Your pride would rise and fade,
Yet every fall just proved again
the work His hand has made.
For even when you turned away
and doubted what He done,
The seed of God within your soul
was growing to overcome.

Then grace revealed the cross to you,
our Savior’s crimson plan,
The Word made flesh, the spotless Lamb,
The Son became your stand.
And when you saw His victory
through blood and Spirit won,
You knew that you're chosen by Him
and born to overcome.

Now daily life becomes our ground
where faith and patience grow,
In quiet work, in simple ways,
His kingdom starts to show.
Each choice we make, each word we speak,
each battle faced and won,
Reveals the life that’s in the seed
the life that overcomes.

No storm can shake what God has sown,
no trial turns us back,
For every test just proves His strength
and keeps us on the tracks.
The Spirit leads through calm and flame,
till all His will be done,
And we reflect our Father’s life
His nature overcomes.

So we will praise Him all our days,
through fire, joy, and rain,
For we were His before the world
and ever shall remain.
The seed He spoke before all time
will shine l...
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. Beautiful. After Friday night's service, I was just so inspired and so encouraged that on my way home, I messaged brother Paul. I'm like, "Brother Paul, I have to do a special on Sunday." So, this is a word of encouragement for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This poem is called Born to Overcome. &gt;&gt; I think this is something that we always need to remember and focus on. Before the dawn had kissed the world, before the stars took flame, he knew your heart. He called your soul. He spoke and wrote your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His word was planted deep within his life. Your living some. You always was. You always are. A child born to overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; It's to overcome all of the struggles and trials of this life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can do it. &gt;&gt; Just surrender to him. &gt;&gt; When you first breathed that newborn air and learned to walk and fall, his hand was near. Though you knew not the one who guided all through childhood dreams and wandering steps, his light would softly come. For deep within, the seed declared, "You're born to overcome. You chased the world. You played its games. You sought its fleeting prize. &gt;&gt; But mercy found you &gt;&gt; where you fell and opened up your eyes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Though you were lost in shadows hold, his purpose still would run. For what was swn before all time must rise to overcome. &gt;&gt; In youth you stumbled, failed, and wept. Your pride would rise and fade. Yet every fall just proved again the work his hand has made. &gt;&gt; For even when you turned away and doubted what he done, the seed of God within your soul was growing to overcome. &gt;&gt; Then grace revealed the cross to you. Our savior's crimson plan. The word made flesh the spotless lamb. The sun became your stand. And when you saw his victory through blood and spirit won, you knew &gt;&gt; that you're chosen by him &gt;&gt; and born to overcome. &gt;&gt; Now daily life becomes our ground where faith and patience grow and quiet work in simple ways. This kingdom starts to show. Each choice we make, each word we speak, each battle faced and won reveals the life that's in the seed. The life that overcomes. No storm can shake what God has swn. No trial turns us back. For every test just proves his strength and keeps us on the tracks. The spirit leads through calm and flame till all his will be done. And we reflect our father's life. His nature overcomes. So we will praise him all our days &gt;&gt; through fire, joy, and rain. &gt;&gt; For we were his before the world &gt;&gt; and ever shall remain. &gt;&gt; The seed he spoke before all time will shine like morning sun. For we are born of God himself &gt;&gt; and here to overcome. &gt;&gt; Lord bless you all. &gt;&gt; [applause]
