praise reports that we want to bring Before the Throne of God one of them is for sister Shayla Livy we had prayed for her friend Brin who's been dealing with autism non-communicative and sister Shayla

this morning at 8:20 I received an email notice I had a new report in my Sask Health app and you can only imagine when you're dealing with this sort of a Circumstance the anxiety the the feelings

the chest to the pelvic there are no tumors benine or malignant no swelling anywhere no nothing in any part of my body there is not one thing that is questionable every note says no before the doctor

Lily because it is that simple how do we show the Lord that we trust him how do we show that we believe him we conduct ourselves with joy amidst the trials that we go through that's the teaching of

service this morning service Lord God into thy hands Lord God and we're expecting Lord Jesus blessing blessing blessing from you Lord we thank you Lord God Amen bless your people and bless Thy Word in Jesus name I pray amen amen amen before we SE Let's uh read the scripture praise God Hallelujah so I want to speak about uh we are the branches and we have the subtitle of uh what she is praise God he says here I am the vine and you the branches he that abided in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit amen for for without me you can do nothing then we read another verse in Revelation chapter 10: 7 to 11 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished that he had declared to his servant the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey then and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I have eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nation and tongues and Kings may the Lord add the blessing from the reading of this scripture you all may be seated praise God hallelujah it's always good to be in the house of the Lord I Thank your pastor Pastor Berry to allowing me to stand behind this ppit it's not easy to stand behind some other some others Pulpit praise God like the prophet said the apostles is the most suspicious person on the earth see because uh they want to protect the fla okay so and that's the best best thing you know the pastor need to protect his flock praise God hallelujah see so this morning I want to speak about uh uh we are the branches and what she is you know because uh this is the time uh this is the age uh uh God is not asking what you have done or what you're what you did and what you're going to do see praise God it this is like a you know at the cross see there is a two two person two uh two fellow one in the right one in the left praise God they did nothing in their life right the only thing that uh one person he recognize who he is see that's all he needs he recognize him praise God see and Jesus did not did not ask him what have you done no praise God see Hallelujah this is our age also you need to know what you are see and who you are praise God see because like what in the scripture said in Revelation 10 verse 11 praise God it says here and he said unto unto me thou must prophesy again amen okay so we are commissioned to preach the gospel amen PR praise God see if you believe that if you can see that uh John types the bride praise God see he is not commissioned to preach his commission the bride is commissioned to prophesy amen see praise God that's two different thing praise God hallelujah you know praise God see so we need to understand who what we are okay even the prophet said that see it says here now remember this Christ is the true church Christ is the true true church is a continuation if Christ is in the true church it is a continuation of the book of Acts okay but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it look one form more powerless it exposes Satan revealing his word attempted destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows he knows that if the people if the bride get the true revelation of the true church and what she is see the prophet keeps saying what she is not who she is amen okay praise God it not it is not who you are who are you no what are you see praise God hallelujah what she stands he says what she stand for and she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army am if you understand what you are that's why this message is trying to establish us okay praise God hallelujah that's why we are planted where we are planted on the Rock see that's why last night I told you we need to go to that holy of holies we're going to e something that is original praise God Amen but a lot of people Overlook it okay praise God everything is in is in the message praise God hallelujah see he says if she understand what she is then and in then she can do a Greater Works she will be an invincible Army right see if they get a true revelation of the true Spirit within the framework of Christian Church okay that's why we need to know who who we what we are praise God then we can overcome the trick of Satan amen amen praise God one more Hallelujah see I will not read all the the whole quotation okay to save time back home it's normal for us to have a a long service okay praise God it's I know it's different here see but home we travel go going to church sometimes the the lease is 1 hour okay people will travel two hours so everybody don't want to have a short service so I know it's different here okay don't you worry I will try my best praise God now it says here again in the next part paragraph same books the revelation of Jesus Christ it says here you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book praise God see Hallelujah see I think I hit amen right you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message uh mentioned at the beginning of this message that uh that this book we are studying is the act of revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages that I mention that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us to give us a revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together we see you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost okay that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people praise God see it will take one with prophetic Insight Hallelujah it will require the ability to hear from God right it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires a teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear see how we need to hear from God and lay of course ourself open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know okay the prophet keep on emphasizing to hear yes praise God but you know only the sheep can hear the voice of the shepherd praise God hallelujah see we need that is prophetic why do we need the a prophetic Insight he said even though you study the scripture you study the message unless you have this prophetic Insight praise God and it is not for everybody anymore it is for a special class of people praise God whether you like it or not that's me and you okay Hallelujah see praise God then the prophet said now Hallelujah okay now it says here amen okay I cut it okay as it was day as it in the days it says here of Noah praise God see as it was in the days of Noah so shall be in the coming of the son of man they were eating drinking marrying giving Maring as it was in the days of lot so will so will it be in the hours of that the son of man will be revealed on Earth not Son of God no more okay praise God hallelujah he is not in the Son of God Ministry anymore he is in the son of man Ministry come back as the prophetic message for the last day for the last day when that eagle will be flying not the lion not the ox in the sacrifice age then again it says hallelujah I this whole audience in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ if you could if your conscience don't let it be sear with unbelief don't let it be frustrated can't you see the son of man the son of man in the form of prophetic message returning back again in his church in Prophecy okay praise God hallelujah this message that we are we are receiving now is a prophetic message amen yes this is not like I say last night this is not a justification message this is not a sanctification message nor the baptism of the Holy Ghost message yes praise God we are now in the message of adoption am praise God and this message is a prophetic message meaning is keep on unfolding okay keep on revealing is Progressive see amen praise God hallelujah amen see if if we can follow it that's where always the problem come in praise God you know way back uh 1995 in the Philippines we don't know about the opening of the seals Hallelujah then during the time brother Ed Bisal come to the Philippines praise God see he share something to us he share you know about about the family of God see he said you know s Satan can do can do everything except to create praise God and Satan can see it every time that God speaks right he can see he can he can see the word of God flying and when it touch something it creating something amen and then here is the son Adam you know he's playing on the water you know and Satan saw it when the father speaks the word right and then Satan tried to grab it but it passed through his hand and then Adam when he saw it he catch it and then he put it on the water and it become a fish my goodness when I heard that Hallelujah we all jump see then speaks about the opening of the seals of the seventh seal praise God God Amen and that change our country upside down we look at the message differently see like the prophet said the Bible become a new Bible it is the same Bible okay but now we can read between the line we can see praise God hallelujah see you know during that time one night one night you know when that seal is open you know become clear to us see you know I always write uh the message for Sunday on Saturday as sometimes I build up some uh inspiration from Thursday Friday then Saturday night you'll start putting all of that praise God see during that time we still don't have that ebook we have no laptop we have no computer we are only relying on the spoken word book so I'm going to start the earliest uh that I can do is 9:00 in the evening the latest is 10:00 because I need all my children to sleep first during that time we I live in a Shanti praise God see you know we are in this satter area and definitely I have a lot of I have many children okay I have five girls okay Hallelujah and three boys so you they need to sleep first before I can write see so you need to wait then and um that's 2:00 you know in the early morning so I've been writing about this you know God is uh creating a family a family I said so if he's creating a family he's creating a family of God yes see and then so if the father is God so the children is God see I said can it be possible amen that I am God am Hallelujah you know praise God yeah I said yes yes I'm God hallelujah see praise God something happened you know praise God when that seal is when you saw that the seven seal is open see the problem if you close it praise God where that is where always a problem then I think that is a problem today some some of the churches they're closing it I don't understand why praise God hallelujah see so let's move on he says here praise God he he uh mine he said he a more of prophetic message see so if that is a prophetic message so we need a prophetic Insight amen praise God or else we will we cannot understand this message right praise God and that's why Hallelujah see he says now he is not in the Son of God anymore more the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ is not in the Son of God anymore okay praise God that why that's why he was not introduced as the Lamb of God but he was introduced how Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah okay praise God hallelujah see the prophet said he is no not Son of God no more but son of man see why because because this message is a mystery Hallelujah this is a prophetic message so we need a prophet to reveal it see praise God and who's revealing it brother Branham no he is revealing it okay praise God hallelujah if he is the vine is revealed is revealing it to whom to the branch okay praise God Amen Hallelujah see that's why he said the son of man in the form of what message spoken word message see if you read that message God is revealing his thought to his people with the prophetic Insight amen hallelujah see that's why if you read that spoken word that message amen hallelujah it's different right that's right see but it is Progressive see you know when I read that Masterpiece the first time I read it I just saw it something like an Evangelistic message praise God then the next time I read it praise God I was surprised you know when the prophet described Michelangelo he went on that on the mountain there's a lot of rock there but he said Michel Angel Angelo can he can see Moses inside the rock right then when he saw Moses inside The Rock he pulled that rock then he tiip off that is not part of Moses Hallelujah I said whoa amen see then the next thing praise God when I read it the third time you know keep on progressing keep on progressing amen you see different things this message is different Hallelujah it is like uh a living water flowing freely praise the Lord see Hallelujah see that's that's why we need a prophetic Insight because this message is a prophetic message praise God and it is being revealed by the son of man praise the Lord see hallelujah amen he is no longer amen he's no more Son of God okay if I said something that is not according to your pastor always stay with your pastor okay I'm just a your little uh brother a little servant you know praise God I just want to people to be uh to be encouraged and to be established remember that okay praise God then if you can see something just charge it to my ignorance will you do that amen praise the Lord hallelujah then we are not in the ripening SE we are not uh implanting season okay H Allelujah see we are we are now in the ripening season we are not in the growing SE we are not in the planting season we are not in the growing season we are praise God hallelujah see this is the Harvest Time okay but the Harvest time is the stages see when the fruit come out now you will say we are now now in the Harvest time but then that fruit starting to grow Hallelujah see that's why it says in the Harvest Time H have you noticed that in the Harvest time though there is a real acceleration in the ripening there is consequently a slowing of growth until there is no growth right see praise God hallelujah that is our time see we are not in the planting season anymore I that's that's why I've been telling it to the people I've been through that you know I went out and evangelize we preach under the lampost under the uh under the tree we did that in our church we were our church was established by signs and wonders we went out we prayed for the sick and they got healed okay dying when we pray praise God instantly God healed them praise God but those were the days of rain outpouring of rain praise God but during the ripening season Hallelujah we you need another thing okay so now he says here slowly praise God consequently a slowing of growth until there is no growth see that's why if you look at this spiritual he says is that not exactly in the natural what we are seeing now the false Vine is losing multitudes of to the Communist and various other praise God and various other types of belief imagine Christian right embracing okay are you online bracing another religion see sometimes I can't understand it praise God see but it's happening Hallelujah see the false B her numbers are not increasing as she would like us to think her hold on the people is not what it used to be and in so many cases going to church is just a show see you know before the false Vine he can hold the People by by his religion right by superstitious and all this kind of teaching by tradition but today the young people you know Hallelujah this is different amen they will not buy it anymore right praise God see that's why the prophet said this time will come when he's saying it praise God it's a prop it's a prophecy praise God it's keep on going now we can see it l Lally right Christian embracing others my goodness Hallelujah see right Christian right like I say even the American people they they they forgot their history you know about the First Amendment right you know it praise God why they built that har Harvard University Yale University if you you Google it it will tell you they build that university university so people can read the Bible and now they are throwing the Bible out of that University that's right see so they forgot the purpose why they built that University praise God then it says to produce more Minister Hallelujah see but now it's crazy right they don't they forgot that their history hallelujah amen see they don't know what is a freedom of religion they thought freedom of religion you can worship even Satan Hallelujah see they can understand it the persecution that the first Christian you know the Puritans when they run from persecution praise God they they cross the ocean and and they went to us you know New Foundland H Allelujah praise praise God Amen Hallelujah they don't know they don't understand really praise God they forgot that they forget their history Hallelujah see praise God Amen see and and that false by if you will not receive them they will kill you right right they they will hold you but today they cannot do it anymore everybody can do what they want to do amen praise God they're losing people and the true he says and the true bind and what about her her she is growing what are those B numbers that keep coming to revivals and answer alar calls are not most of them merely emotional in their approach or desires of something physical rather than Desiring that which is truly spiritual Hallelujah then when you in the message let's say hallelujah we believe this is a True Vine what's happening now he said praise God say they don't want to go into the revivals anymore praise God you know way back 1970s 80s in the Philippines after the service we we were hit by the Pentecost Revival 84 8586 see then you know we have a something a little still 87 and 88 88 after the service brother and sister I'm telling you once the service is finished all the people will line up they want to be prayed for but today Hallelujah they're almost dying and they still don't want to come to the church to be prayed for it's different now praise God hallelujah amen see that's why the prophet said is this age are not like the day in which Noah entered the Ark and the door was shut but yet God carried in judgment seven days right it's all it's almost the same thing now it's quieting down praise God hallelujah see so you need to understand it we are not in the growing praise God see we are now in the ripening season then it says here praise God hallelujah see now he promised to send you Heavenly light to ripen the world seed that will be swn for this day the seed is in here the seed is the Bible why Jesus said the word is a seed that the sers saw and now before you can have any crop no matter if you saw the seed it's got to have light to ripen the seed it don't need rain anymore amen see that's a problem today you we know the outpouring of rain that is the outpouring of the holy spirit that will produce the signs and wonders amen praise God I'm not against signs and wonders okay praise God that's why I told you beforehand that our church start with signs and wonder praise God but this message is keep on progressing keep on progressing praise God you know way back 1995 Hallelujah every time we we have this uh joint meeting after the service everybody is jumping shouting see when Brother bcal start preaching he's not he he's not saying anything anything he just breath people are hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah the brother bcal said how how can you hear me if you keep on shouting see it's pure emotion praise God that's why the prophet said Satan is not afraid of your shouting right see amen praise God see that's why when you lay you know when they lay hands to the sister who say Lord [Music] as simple as that see you cannot hear Brother Bram keep i k you he never did that because he said the devil is not afraid of your shouting he's afraid of your holy life see Hallelujah see praise God he says it's got to have light to ripen the seed or it it will rot and won't do no good it will perish but if it's God seed on the ground the right ground with the right kind of sunlight on it it got to ripen okay praise God hallelujah so it need to be ripened remember that praise God hallelujah see but it needs the light not the rain anymore see you know if you plant wi when the whe appear come out praise God when the rain come it will rot it will make the wheat it will rotten the wheat amen so we need a very strong not just sunlight but a very strong sunlight right praise God to ripen it and he promised and he promised in the last days when in the evening time imagine sometimes it sounds crazy he promise a very strong light in the evening time hallelujah how can there be a strong light in the evening time the son it says the s o n will come out see he will come out to ripen that seed the seed is being preached the Son of God is rening that seed by vindicating it making it push out before you and proving that is right see it's need to that's why this message the light of the message is getting is getting more stronger praise God and the message is getting and getting more deeper whether we like it or not okay praise God but to us it sounds very simple Hallelujah you know last night when I when I shared that uh go on to Perfection when I was in Indonesia my interpreter is uh The Interpreter of the government to the United Nation see he asked me what are you going to share brother Pastor he said about the Tabernacle of God then he went back home then he show me all this uh his notes he said I I uh interpreted for for Benny hin I interpreted for this and this and this all big men and here brother leester I don't see then when I share it he was so excited he was preaching his own message I don't know it that's why the pastor was so angry with him praise God see he stopped the pastor stopped the service and I you know I I was gried I said what happened then the Pastor said I'm very sorry brother Nestor but that interpreter is preaching his own okay I said praise the Lord thank you then you know when we were there he he told me I know your secret you know Indonesia is a is a Muslim country okay there are part in Indonesia that the Muslim are very radical and they be they are very Fanatics praise God they will kill you they will burn you praise God then when he said that uh I know your secret I know who you are I said what brother what it is he said I know you are a doctor of divinity I said what no this that is very BAS see in our church even our Deon can tell it well can share it to you see no no no no no unless you are a doctor of the vinity you cannot you cannot teach that kind of subject okay brother I I told him I'm going to give you a books oh you write that book no no that is a seven Church ages Hallelujah see he can't believe it when you go out a very simple message to the message believer is a very deep subject to the denominational people amen praise God and they can't believe it that I never went into any Bible School see praise God hallelujah see so the message remember see that's why it says when the seals is open it will connect all okay praise God hallelujah so again we we cannot do anything about it the message is just getting clearer and clearer the clearer it it become praise God to the outside the deeper it is okay but to us it's so simple right it's so simple praise God hallelujah see praise God see now this why he says here again again okay I make it clear see so we need uh uh praise God who is coming out the sun o and light praise God see at the opening of the seals it make everything clear remember that Hallelujah all the loose end that's why this says when the seal is broken okay it will connect all the Loose Ends what Luther's left what w left what the Pentecostal left he will just connect it praise God see because they really don't understand what they are saying see when Martin Luther said no that just shall live by faith Hallelujah is by Grace by faith see they really he he really don't know what it is when the Prophet come he make it more clearer see preise God what justification mean right praise God he said you know like me I'm brother Braham then one one one brother from the church WIll accuse me he said brother branam I saw you last night you're drinking in a in a beer house and with a woman with you then brother vanam said no I'm in the church I'm preaching and here's my Witnesses the deacons were here then the deacons will say yes he is in the church then the man will say to him okay brother branam I forgive you then he said how can you forgive me right if I did not me if I did not do it right that is the meaning of justification you have not done it in the first place you are Justified see that's why I've been telling it to the people how why is he going to save you when you have eternal life see he is not saving us that's why the future homes the prophet said he's not saving you you are always saved see he's redeeming us he's not saving us amen see he's justifying us yes amen blessed is a man that God will not impute sin praise God hallelujah see it's different I've been telling it to the people that's why the prophet said he can only redeem what his own amen praise God he cannot redeem everybody Hallelujah see only his own only the only the one that he can redeem not not for everybody okay that's why the prophet said only the redeemable can be redeem redeem and saving is two different thing okay it is like my son you know he went out of the world then praise God he make mistake then they put him in jail then as the father I go out and try and try to find and search my my son then I heard that he they put him in jail I went to the Jailer I will I will ask him so what happened so your son commit this and this and this so what should I do you need to pay you need to redeem him see how much do you need the blood of Christ amen still the blood okay praise God don't be me don't be uh you know I Believe In The Blood see praise God then I pay the blood there are there are so many inmates in there right see but I can only redeem that is my own amen hallelujah maybe when my son was in jail then my son will tell tell me you know Dad that man is good to me can you make a way yeah to save [Laughter] him okay now you understand the two thing praise God he is not redeeming us he's not saving us he's justifying us you know praise God like I say you know the word justified in Filipino is much better because the meaning of Justified in Filipino is ining Gap but when you said Inari mean your own Gap perfectly praise God completely see that is the meaning of justification in talog in Philippino you're completely owned praise God am see Hallelujah do you want it uh let's let's just say it in talog Hallelujah that is the meaning of justification praise God see God is justifying you those he call those he call he pred those he predestinate he call those he those he call he justify he's just trying to tell to the people he is Mine He's Mine own he's completely own by me Hallelujah see praise God he's showing it to the whole world that we are his amen amen hallelujah see now so now you understand what the message is okay we're going to start Hallelujah see we are the branches and he's the vine okay so when God create you know the message is keep on telling us that God is the god of universe okay praise God I'm not going to read all it says here praise God hallelujah he was Adam he was a God on the earth God God's the god of the universe everywhere praise God then he says here as a minor God under God our father because he was a Son of God okay so when when God created Adam he's he created a family of God see and God is the god of universe and the propes said God of everywhere okay praise God and Adam he is the god on Earth see so Adam came from the father so if the father is a Bast ocean ocean water of ocean then Adam is a St a teaspoonful of ocean right see Hallelujah he came from that same ocean water amen what the ocean has that small teaspoonful got it Hallelujah see now so the father hold the seed okay but he needs something he need an earth to plant to put that seed in amen praise God that's why he named Adam Adam because the meaning of Adam is red Earth praise God and in that Earth he planted his seed praise God am see and and the father did not name any names on the Earth see he only named one name Amen in Adam then he put all the name in Adam he put all the seed in Adam he put all his plan in Adam his program everything amen hallelujah see that's why even Michael and Gabriel and warmwood they were curious he said there's so many cre creature here but they have no name they have no name the Angels don't know it why he said look at this animal he got a big for in his neck they done then animal oh what is that then Adam said he is the lion lion then they saw another one lion then Gabriel saw another lion lion lion lion hallelujah amen all lion name lion right then there is a big bird he said oh look at that see that creature is flying he Big Bird what is that then Adam said that's an eagle Eagle Eagle Eagle hallelujah amen then when they look when when when Gabriel and and Michael look at the Father the father said amen hallelujah he amening Adam's word see praise God hallelujah H see so Adam names all the names of all the creation Creator on the earth praise God not the father see meaning to say that Adam's voice is the extend of the voice of the father see he is the voice of his voice praise God he's a final voice of that hour Hallelujah once he name names that's it it's finished Hallelujah see he's revealing the seed that's in in the father praise God see his voice is revealing the voice of the father praise God hallelujah see and all the SE is in Adam see that's why he expected Adam to go multiply replenish the Earth praise God make it beautiful but Adam fa see we know what happened in the Garden of Eden when the F come praise God see it did not though is ruin the plan of God but it did not stop the plan of God okay Hallelujah then Adam was separated praise God from the Tree of Life The Way of the tree of life right praise God because the Bible said if if God will not push them out and if Adam stret forth his H arm and itat from the fruit of the Tree of Life they will never die and and God don't want them into the uh to live in that kind of condition living eternally within a fallen state right amen praise God see that's why I've been telling it to the people you know imagine if all the people will not die even these crazy people praise God will not die right and the sister Mary a crazy guy who are lazy drunkard Gambler and he's he will not die and she will not die then every time the he that the guy come home her husband will slap her praise God then we'll ask ask for money and she if she has nothing to give will kick her slap her again punch her do you like to live that kind of Life sister eternally I tell you she will pray hard right she will pray very very hard and this is her prayer Lord kill me that's why even death is a grace of God Amen see hallelujah praise God see so after that when men went out of the garden they don't know the way of God anymore and the Bible said praise God they live according to the imagination see the men live according he says she here in uh Genesis 6:5 praise God and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually see that is Before the Flood then after the flood man's heart the heart of men are evil from his youth see and the Lord smell as with Sabor and the Lord said into his heart I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth see praise God hallelujah man lost the way of lost the way of the Tree of Life they don't know now the way of the Tree of Life praise God they do what they want to do see that's why I've been telling it to the people if you don't have God in your life you will just do what you want to do right praise God and at the end you will always cry amen see Hallelujah if you don't have God in your life oh when you're still strong you can say I don't need God I don't need God praise God but when you grow old Hallelujah see you will understand it praise God see that's why I've been telling it to the people you know God can bless you materially you can earn a lot of money God can bless you physically you can be strong in all your life praise God hallelujah but you are more blessed if you have a nice home church and a well and balanced Pastor I can tell you you are so blessed see praise God all those material things all those physical things today you can have it tomorrow you can lose it today you're very strong but after 20 years like brother Paul see whether we like it or not say like me you know before I can stay awake for 3 days and two nights and still will carry a 50 socks 50 kilo socks but today no more it will break my back praise God see I've been telling it to the people you know praise God I'm not sick okay I'm not sick but I am in this deteriorating body what can I do praise God I'm just old see I'm not sick I'm just old you know my hearing is not as good as before sometimes when there is a lot of people are talking see I I I can understand what uh what the other uh person talking to me you know I cannot understand him anymore because to no see see and I went to the I went to the hospital and they do a lot of check you know uh uh okay you're this this and this like this then I said you're not sick I said why why am I am like this he said because you're old so I so I praise the Lord because they told me I am not sick right I'm old that's all praise God and there is no cure for old age see the only only C cure that we need right brother praise God is a body Chase praise God and you cannot buy that in the pharmacy okay praise God hallelujah see that's why we have hope okay we have hope praise God see Hallelujah see so until you know then the time come praise God see in the time of Moses god gave him the seed okay praise God it says here in the time of Moses he gave him the seed right Israel started with a seed with the law it is a shadow praise God see that's why he says from that seed Something Beautiful will come out see what will coming out from that seed a holy nation A peculiar people a nation of priesthood Hallelujah that should be the fruits of that sin that's why the Bible is very clear the law having is Shadow praise God of the good things to come the law is a seed and it needs to Bear fruits that's why God is always addressing Israel as the fig tree right praise God see he said I found her in the wilderness praise God see so Israel started with a seed and God is expecting the fruits but Israel failed Hallelujah until the true seed right praise God see now when man lost the seed he gave it back to Moses praise God but Israel failed to produce that fruits then Jesus come right h Hallelujah see when Jesus come came he said now he said it I am the true bind see when Jesus came he fulfill he fulfilled the plan of God he fulfilled the program of God he is the mind of God in flesh praise God say he is the seed the seed okay not a seed praise God hallelujah he's the word of God he's the plan of God he's a program of God he's the mind of God made flesh but then in 15 he said I am the true bind and my father is the husband man okay the word husband man it says here he is the cultivator praise God and today we call it Farmer see he cultivate praise God now from sined now he become now the vine praise God see Hallelujah he says here I am the vine then he said you are the branches in verse five he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall us what you will and it shall be done unto you and greater thing you can do okay Hallelujah see now he's declaring himself as the tree vine praise God see first he is the seed now that seed grow into a Vine now he said you are it need to produce a Branch amen praise God then the prophet Hallelujah it says here okay in the mes of restoration of the Bright Tree said but what he was God's he was God's perfect Prophet tree you know when we study the restoration of the brigh tree we're always looking at the four insect right see that destroy that bright Tre and then the fourth stage of restoration praise God but then look at this okay he was God's perfect Prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree okay amen glory I'm going to say something directly he says here if he is the bridegroom tree do you believe do you believe it from the Garden of Eden so this bridegroom tree came from the Gard of Eden meaning this is the Tree of Life praise God then the bridegroom tree without a female don't bear fruit so he's got to have a Bright Tree he has got to be born of the same material the world made flesh in the tree hope you get it it's the same life in this female tree the bridegroom as it is in the bride The Works that I do shall you sh I do shall you also is that right he was the bridegroom remember praise God hallelujah then he says here oh you say that ain't is scriptural oh it oh it is I C that now see we're fixing to have healing meeting in a minute I caught that he was praise God then he says I will prove it to you you want proof of it he said now he quot this John 15 I am the vine you are the branches St John saying it I am the vine you are the branches you bear the fruit see and the male tree and the female female tree produces the poen one to the to the other brings the fruit and the branch and the vine does the same thing see that's exactly he said now this first tree was a prophet tree a perfect tree the god of the prophets he was a major tree he was God's perfect Prophet tree why he was the word now the others was Minor Prophets the word came to the prophets but he was the word himself in the form of a prophet praise God hallelujah see now he's trying to tell us this bridegroom tree cannot express his Beauty without the bride tree praise God see Hallelujah so same thing with me I have a lot of beautiful inside me I have a lot of beautiful daughters inside me and a handsome boy inside me see how can I express it I can't express it by myself I need my right tree praise God see so same thing with God he is the vine that's why the prophet said he needs a branch see the branch will only produce his seed the branch will not produce he her own seed praise God see my wife will will not produce his her own seed he will just produce he will just show the beauty praise God that's inside me Hallelujah so same thing with the bridegroom tree praise God without the Bright Tree Hallelujah see he cannot express himself Hallelujah see now it says here okay and I was just thinking okay we are God's fruit bearers we are the one that will produce we will we will uh produce the fruits and I believe in St John the 17th chapter Jesus said ye are the branches and he was the vine now the vine puts forth the fruit but the branches has to Bear the fruit it is the vine who will push out okay the fruits see Hallelujah say not okay the fruit not the vine will produce the fruits it is the branch who will show the fruits okay so now if the branch is getting its life out of the vine well is the same kind of life that's in the vine don't you think so it has to be now our hands and our lips our eyes then God's hand lips and eyes Okay praise God hallelujah see praise God it says here okay and I was just thinking we are God's fruit Bearer and I believe in St John the 17th chapter Jesus said you are the branches and he was the vine now the vine puts forth the fruit but the branches say to Bear the fruit so the branch is getting its life out of the vine well it's the same kind of life that's in the vine don't you think so now here here what I'm trying to tell you okay we are commissioned to prophesy we are not commissioned to preach Hallelujah see prophesying and preaching is two different thing okay praise God hallelujah but you cannot prophesy if you have no prophecy to prophesy see praise God hallelujah and then it says here you know the prophet okay so this is a old old Hebrew uh word you know impct to grab okay praise God it says here prophecy a fruit produced from inside see that is the fruits but then a prophet one who brings forth the inner fruit is his something to do with fruits fruits fruits fruits and Seed see praise God hallelujah now if Jesus is the vine he is the prophet okay all the prophecy all the seeds it's in him but it cannot it cannot reveal he needs a branch praise God see what the branch is going to do he will just take that out of the vine and to show the fruits that's why the prophet will show the fruits that inside praise God hallelujah and then the fruits will contain the seed amen see what now we now now what the prophet is showing to us that is the seed inside that tree revealing it prophesying it okay Hallelujah now look if the vine is a prophet the prophet then the branch is a prophet amen if he is the first fruits if the messenger is a first fruits is a prophet what will be the whole field hallelujah amen the whole field will be prophets praise God that's why all the mystery we are revealing the mystery to the people amen right you know when you go out and preach God loves you oh we know it God will bless you yes I know your God and my go and my God your God bless you my God also bless me you know when I went to a police station they want me because the brother asked me to go there and help him he said pastor please help me see he's doing it because uh the police they have a program we call it value formation and he part of that program and I don't want to be part of that I don't want to waste my time then he said please help me when he said maybe there there are fish you know in that place when he told me that I said okay okay we'll go then when I went to the police station these are policemen then I said I said I said to them how what what I'm going to teach you you are the one who arresting these bad people meaning to say that you know the good the good things see why I am here see am I going to teach you about to be to become a good person when you're the one who's arresting the bad people see but the problem I told them people don't know the mystery of sin what sin is right then I told them drinking is not sin right oh the policemen are very happy adultery is not sin gambling is not sin so they look at each other they're so happy you know see then they asked them after after this service you will go home raise the hand that when you go home will not drink wine and nobody's raising their hand so meaning to say when you go home you will drink see and they keep quiet they don't understand they don't know what sin is it's a mystery Hallelujah see I told them I did not come here to make you a a good cop a good policeman see we preach not to make you a good person and a good boy or good girl we preach people to be saved see because no good people will go to heaven neither bad people amen see praise God hallelujah that's the Bible righten amen see praise God that's why I've been always telling it to the young people don't you worry you come to the church I will not teach you how to become a good boy a good girl praise God say we come here to preach salvation see praise God that's why now every time we share how can you prophesy if you don't know the prophecy and how can you prophesy if you are not proph ETS that's why the that's why the prophet said see Minister when you Minister when you share the New Testament Prophet you know the one that I'm sharing this message praise God because this message is a mystery that's why we need praise God the son of man Ministry to reveal to us then when you go out am Hallelujah see you know when I go out with the denomination I always ask them the question this this question is see I told them if if you believe that we all come from Adam and Eve if Adam blood is blood is type A then Eve came from Adam meaning to say that he's she's also type A where did the other blood coming from and why God needs blood see they don't know it Hallelujah then when when they when they heard you now they got interested they will ask you can you say something more can you say something more I keep on dropping nuggets keep on Dr dropping nuggets then until they will say can you hold it can you h a seminar can you teach us then hallelujah that's we do it see because this denominational that's why those were Bishop I'm telling you brother and sister those were Bishop listening to you they've been in the bible school for 20 years when they heard the message when you prophesy to them they they're asking where did you get that kind of knowledge see they cannot understand it who teach you that where you got that about the serpent seed about the godhead praise God they cannot understand it why see you are prophesying you are revealing to them okay praise God see so the bride we are commissioned okay to prophesy not to preach see Hallelujah we have double portion don't don't don't don't go out here and say oh brother neso said we we are not uh to preach anymore don't don't do that okay the bride always have double portion do you believe that we preach and we prophesy okay praise God but those people in the outside they only preach but they can prophesy right praise God they are not part of that vine they are not part of that tree what kind of tree the prophet the perfect Prophet tree praise God see but that perfect Prophet tree need a branch in that way it can produce the fruits it can prophesy to sow the seed amen hallelujah see praise the Lord now we need to know what we are right praise God see so that is the bride what you are you are a prophet Hallelujah see now it says here in Revelation 5:10 what more praise God and has made us unto God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on Earth okay praise God hallelujah so now the bride she is Kings she is priests Hallelujah sees prophets amen okay that's why we can prophesy now we will go into another stage as a priest Hallelujah see we know it we are a chosen generation we are a royal priesthood see if there is a priest we need a temple right we need to serve in the temple that's why when Jesus was on Earth he cannot serve on the temple why because there are priests in the temple for serving according to the law praise God see but we know we are also a priest a royal priesthood in the order of melc okay you cannot be a priest without an order praise God hallelujah see now it says here God is going to build his Temple okay he said and in John chapter 2 verse 19 Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temp Temple and in 3 days I will raise it up then said the Jews 40 and6 years was this temple in building and will thou reel it up in three days but he spake off the Temple of his body see they can't understand it what kind of Temple Jesus is going to build see that's why praise God in Corinthian 6: 19 what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you the Temple of the Holy Ghost is in US praise God hallelujah see God is building his Temple okay praise God and it says here the father okay he promised he will be back in his mystical body see it says here if he one that's going to be in you it was him that cometh in spirit form go up and wait for I'm going to send a promise the father had promised you I'm going to send it upon you then I'll be with you even in you all the way to the end of the world I and I will be in you doing the same things that I did while I was here in this body then now he speaking of another body I will be back and I will be back in my mystical body doing the same thing see so it's a promise amen praise God see he's going to build another body that he can work in Hallelujah now if this is the seven Church ages We Know It This is the uh Gentile dispensation okay now we call it the seven Church ages that is the body of Christ right that is the body of Christ Hallelujah see and we and and we we type it with the moon and that body of Christ has a light we call it the Moonlight amen praise God now it says here for 3,000 years for all most praise God Hallelujah for nearly 2,000 years see God has been again making him a masterpiece because he struck Adam and get a piece of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him okay praise God now the prophet is trying to tell us that there that he's going to make the third Masterpiece for nearly 2,000 years it says God has been again making him a masterpiece okay Adam when God created Adam he is the Masterpiece of God he's the first Masterpiece then he cover it he protected it with his word he shielded it he put a wall but then Adam went out praise God Adam knew what's happening because Adam in him is all the plan of God the seed of God he know what's happening praise God but now the second Masterpiece Hallelujah Jesus right he is the word praise God see he is the body of God but now that third Masterpiece the prophet said for nearly 2,000 years God has been again making him a masterpiece then in the message of Master paragraph 109 it says as it taken him 4,000 years to make this masterpiece now he's been for nearly 2,000 years making another Masterpiece okay praise God for nearly 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a bride he call it a bride for Christ another Master peace praise God hallelujah see with that in mind he needs a body praise God see for what for so he can dwell in he said I was with this body but I will come again I promise you I will come again in my mystical he call it mystical body right praise God see in that body I will do what I'm doing when I was here on Earth hallelujah amen now the problem this kind of Temple Hallelujah God said how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as said the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me say the Lord or what is the place of my rest had not my hand made all these things now this kind of Temple is different that God is trying to build because he says Heaven is my throne and Earth is is my foot stol meaning to say this is a very big Temple see from Earth to Heaven how can you make it Hallelujah see now it says here in Revelation 3: 20 behold I stand at the door and knock if anyone hear my voice and open the door I'll come into to him and will St with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father with my father in his throne okay praise God imagine he said if you can overcome that closed door you will sit with me in my father's Throne where is my father's Throne is it's in heaven okay Hallelujah that's why in Revelation 4 verse1 it says after this I look and behold and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me okay now the church ages ended with a closed door see it was ended with a closed door you need to overcome this closed door the problem several people can go go out of this closed door but they cannot go up see that's why it create a lot of confusion you need to go up come up heater see praise God hallelujah how can you overcome that closed door on Earth he says you need to hear if my if they can if they hear my voice if you hear my voice see again that is the qualification to overcome that door you need to be able to hear the voice of the shepherd that's why he said when you have prophetic Insight you are you have the capability you have the praise God ability to hear amen the word of the proph the word of the shepherd see once you are overcome that closed door he said I will you will going to sit in the Heavenly places that's why the prophet said where we are now we are now sitting where in the Heavenly places right praise God and we are eating the he the hidden Mana praise the Lord see hallelujah amen if you can go into that heaven that's where a big problem again amen praise godj see because once you are in heaven you're going to eat different kind of uh food amen hallelujah see he says here notice and is not revealed until this book is not revealed until the church ages and denominational ages has run out and there's time no more see it it's only rever after the church ages after the Lan church close the door and denomination ages run out that's the reason the thing is such an scrupled tonight see Hallelujah until the until the seal is open everything is you know is very fuzzy okay we cannot understand it like I told you praise God hallelujah see and it says here he says okay those little loose end but those Mysteries are promised to be revealed in the end time it was called mystery again see it needs to be it needs to be revealed when in the end time it's little loose ERS that this great warrior that this great warrior has come on the scene okay that's why I told I I I I told you before you know Luther cannot understand what the meaning of justification the prophet clarify it to he to us right praise God he is not saving us because we are always saved he's redeeming us because we are his own praise God he will only reveal he he will only reveal that is uh that is his own praise God then when it come to sanctification right he tied that loose end praise God he showed that mystery of righteousness of God the whole book of the the whole book of Romans praise God is talking about the righteousness of God not our righteousness right see Hallelujah that's why he explained it farther he said it like this you know let's say your sin is like it is like a drop of a dark ink and then here is here is a drum of Clorox imagine it a drum of Clorox let's say that is 100 kilo and your sin is 1 kilo of dark egg he said when you confess your sin praise God it will drop in the drum of Clorox that one kilo of dark ink what will happen to that dark ink it will become also you call it bleach or Clorox bleach it will become blit you can see it anymore see the prophet said now your sin will counted it as your righteousness amen see Hallelujah it will become your righteousness if you confess it okay not hide it amen hallelujah see praise God he keep on revealing those loose end see that's why people think that oh I need to I need to leave at this kind of holy life this kind this and this and this no you need to understand you you praise God I mean uh see we do that okay we live a holy life right before we we try our best to live a holy life but then when the prophet reveal it you just confess it you just you just uh I mean uh Hallelujah some sometimes young people are asking me Pastor what should we do what should we do just tell it to him amen praise God just confess it accept it that you're a sinner that's all God want you to want you to do just accept that you're a sinner then God can do something praise God when you keep on reasoning then God cannot make it God cannot that God cannot move see just accept it Lord I am a sinner amen Lord I'm I'm weak Hallelujah then he can do something praise the Lord see Hallelujah those loose end those little loose end God is try see praise God now he's uh connecting it everything praise God at the opening of the seals see at the opening of the seals Hallelujah everything now becoming more clearer the light becoming more stronger praise God we can see now clearer praise God hallelujah we understand it now praise the Lord hallelujah then it says here s now the seals okay will tie all the Loose Ends praise God God hallelujah now is I turn it up okay this is a seven Church ages we call it the body of Christ see they show a Moonlight okay now this is just a body right right that's only a body praise God see the Devil Keep On attacking the body and he was surprised that body cannot die see that's why the pro that's why the scripture is very clear it says them without us cannot be perfected praise God see because they only produce the body Hallelujah the seven Church ages produce the body but we need the head now there's the head okay now it's complete right Hallelujah see that produce the sunlight see we call it what do we call it bright age not Church age anymore that's why we are beyond the church age we are now in the bride age now it's a complete body see we call it what do you call it that is the true church the mystical Body of Christ see hallelujah praise God amen amen that's why the prophet said okay now it says here the true church is the mystical Body of Christ Hallelujah it says here God's people is called is he called out people he's called out people okay praise God I believe there are every in every denomination they could be Catholic they could be Protestant they could be Jewish they could be any of kind of church but a real church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ now you cannot organize this mystical body mystical Body of Christ now every person that comes to Christ come out of the world comes into Christ comes into his mystical body see so we are now part of that mystical body amen we are not in the church ages anymore it's finished okay Hallelujah see we are now in the bright age the head age see not the body age anymore right praise God but the head it contained the mouth the eyes the ears see with the prophet coming com into the Feast of Pentecost the mouth Hallelujah then he went into the ice right then he Shout at the the voice of the seventh angel now we can hear it praise God but at the opening of the seals it opened the Mind amen see we have more than what they have right right praise God but in our time God is not just opening the mind of God he's opening the back part of his mind Hallelujah telling us what we are see you are the branch we are the branches if the vine is a prophet the BR the branch should be a prophet also praise God if the vine is full of meat mystery the branch will reveal the mystery amen he she will prophesy Hallelujah see we are not in the bride in this in church age anymore we are in the bride age we are in the head age Hallelujah don't go back to the body amen see God used it that's why the prophet said God used the church no question about it right but that time will come he will not use the Moonlight anymore when the sunlight appear he will not use the Moonlight anymore Hallelujah see when these things happen in the evening time because now the loudan age is in the evening time light will appear praise God that's why he said when when when he explained the Zariah he said now the you know praise God When when when when this when this morning star is is coming out now he will push all the darkness in one side it becomes so dark praise God hallelujah see it is not the prophet is not trying to tell us in the evening time there is there is son no praise God he explained it he said the Morning Star is now appearing he will announce the coming of Christ They will announce he said it they will announce amen praise God hallelujah see now this is the true church because the true church if you know the true church then she will know what she is then he can do Mighty works praise God hallelujah see praise God then who set it up he says here through all of it who set it up that is this mystical body who started this Jesus Christ and it is the he is the head of this mystical body he's the king over it working his own will in his Dominion we are his Dominion he's the king Hallelujah see now you can see it okay that's why we know know it at the opening of the seals when it when when that thing happened 1963 right praise God when that mystery clouds that's why the prophet said that is the head Hallelujah see now he's connecting to the body when that head come praise God the seals open see Church AG is finished denominational uh age is finished Hallelujah those seed that's in the denominational denominational Church says those praise God seed that is in the church ages they will just come out they will go to the Head Hallelujah see praise God who set it up Jesus okay now Hallelujah the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit right okay amen now we become the blood of Christ amen once he is in the son of man Ministry meaning to say he is not a the priest anymore because the Son of God is the ministry of the priesthood he is the one who will intercede for us but then when he is in the Son of God Min son of man Ministry who is going to intercede for the people right that's why the bride needs to know what she is he said he make us Kings he make us priests praise God hallelujah so if we are the priests in the altar of melkisedek we we should be touched by the infirmity infirmities of the people see we are not the one that who will condemn the people we are supposed to be like Moses remember that see when the Israelite make mistake when Moses was in the Mount Horeb then God said okay Moses go down I'm going to kill all your all your people they go against me what did Moses did he said Lord you know it he came from Egypt we've been there for 400 years we are contaminated by the religion what do you expect to from us Lord see then Moses said Lord if you will kill them then kill me first see when God hear that he said okay Moses I will not kill them I will not destroy them because of you because of Moses the whole nation was his spare praise God for only one person praise God I've been saying it to the people we are condemned by representation right we come here here condemned we were born condemned we did nothing wrong but we were condemned by representation then you will say oh God it's unfair I did not do it it's it's Adam who did it why should you condemn me see that's why God make a way also for you to be saved and you're not doing anything also see so now it will be fair right one person did that for you right Hallelujah did you you don't need to do anything Hallelujah he did it for you he paid the price that he didn't own Hallelujah see just for one person see H Allelujah now we're coming back to that to that point again because once the bride knew who she what she is then you will understand you are a priest God trusted you amen praise God see because if nobody will intercede for the people of God God will just destroy everything see Hallelujah but if the bride will understand what she is hallelujah you are a priest Hallelujah see you are the blood the blood of Christ amen hallelujah that's why that's why Paul said you know if the unbelieving husband Hallelujah married to an unbeliever praise God don't put her out when the when the when the wife is a Believer then the husband is unbeliever don't put him put him out praise God see you can sanctify him or else your children will be Unholy why because you are holding the blood in the spirit you are the blood amen praise God you are the blood of Christ amen hallelujah see hallelujah praise God now the mercy SE okay we need the temple why do we need the temple because The Mercy Seat is always in the temple praise God see and what is the what is the mercy seat it says here where is The Mercy Seat found in in the heart of man now we're living in another age okay where's the mercy she found in the heart of man where did it come in the heart of man at the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost which is God come into the human heart is that right now let's make let's make this down here mark this down here and get ready to draw it if you want to Pentecost PN T I'll put Pentecost this is The Mercy Seat the Holy Ghost amen Hallelujah see the Holy Ghost is The Mercy Seat of God Amen Hallelujah you know when they crucify Jesus right then God see divide the bail see from top to bottom see he ripped it from top to bottom to bottom see where is The Mercy Seat the prophet said they hung it on the cross if they can only understand he is The Mercy Seat of God and what where is that Mercy Seat now he said during in the time of Pentecost it went into the heart of the believer amen hallelujah see The Mercy Seat now where is The Mercy Seat now in the mystical Body of Christ Hallelujah see you are the temple of God Amen if you are the temple of God the mercies is in you amen amen that's why anybody anybody that will just give you a cold one cold glass of water it will not God will not forget it they God will give them a reward see what kind of reward eternal life amen see praise God hallelujah if the bride will understand what she is greater work what is the Greater Works that the bride can do Healing The Sick make the blind see I'm telling you praise God see if anybody touch you Hallelujah they will be saved imagine but why because you're the blood of Christ in spirit see Hallelujah right you you believe Amen in your household the Bible is very clear the Bible never said you believe and let your people believe and all of them will be saved no see we have a lot of scripture right Rahab only Rahab believed and all his household was saved see why praise God because he is the message he's the blood of Christ see what are you you are the bride you are the blood of Christ praise God Amen Hallelujah don't you worry that's why that's why the prophecy keep on saying even how we are your children is don't you worry see they are your inheritance see they will not go anywhere Hallelujah we have eternal life we have no beginning and end but some people will be rewarded with eternal life they have a beginning but they have no end that's a different with us see Hallelujah those people will ask Lord when when we saw you that you're hungry and we feed you when we saw you you are you're thirsty and we we give you water to drink when you did it to my mystical body Hallelujah see that's what we are brother and sister if you only know what you are you will go out see that's why I've been saying to the people don't you worry just live the life amen hallelujah just live the life even in this congregation that's why it's very important that you have a home church it's very important that you know your pastor Hallelujah if you think your pastor is the is a servant of God then respect him see amen praise God you need to respect him Hallelujah He will carry all this church because he is your spiritual father amen praise God see Hallelujah the prophet said that those you love and those who love you God will give it to you imagine if you love your pastor if your pastor you think your pastor will make it then you will make it see so it's very important hallelujah amen see so same thing you are you are the pastor of your house at home so don't you worry about your children okay I'm not saying that you let your children go go while okay I'm not saying that when it comes to Salvation don't you worry see as long as you serve the Lord praise God God will do something amen praise God there are your inheritance okay because how can we control our children right we cannot even change ourself hallelujah how can you change your children that's why we just put it in the hand of God what we are going to do we are going to serve the Lord see don't you worry right praise God hallelujah imagine in the time of brother branam right God saved his horse yeah God save his dog and God saved his couch also imagine if God is mindful of his horse and dog how about my children are they not important than our children Hallelujah see that is the bride

people you know this is this AG is very good because you don't need to worry you just need to believe amen just believe see what you are you are a prophet what you are you are a priest what you are

they they will be very grateful they will be very thankful to you amen praise God just live the life okay amen hallelujah that is the bride amen okay now I just want to show you some of our mission field Hallelujah in that way uh um so you have a little idea what we are doing see back in the Philippines we have this radio program is very it's very fruitful you know we have that radio program because that is in mindo in mindo is the southern part of of the Philippines where the Muslim are you know but the Muslim are just a minority we have no problem with them but the problem we have Message Church in that area and there are several of them praise God there is one uh the the father of Sami Durano this is Sami Durano he is the one okay praise God his father is a is a founder of a Bible School and they were being supported by the Korean Miss uh Presbyterian church and also uh by the moris culu Min Ministry but when he got hold of the message he found out that the woman cannot preach so he recall all his his missionary he said you stay home you stay in the kitchen then he got angry with the moru and the Korean you know you're not telling us the truth see cut all your support then they you know he he separated himself and then uh he established six me six churches see so when when when when these churches learn that uh their Pastor has no more support then each Church make a way for for their Pastor to survive one church will support his uh needs every day see but then uh because uh you know we know it in the message there are so many uh teaching then they isolate them self when they when he isolate himself you know they make their own teaching but then before he pass away he called his son thei Durano he said go out try to look for our brother I know we have a real brother in the message try to look for them and I met him you know uh praise God see so I go there I've been going there then he said pastor help us so we can cope up you know catch up up see praise God what can we do see I asked him he told me maybe we can do the radio broadcast see okay you ask how much it will cost then he said uh uh then then he he told me it cost $200 a month for four for um how do you said uh radio program uh once a week see for two hours see and for one month we only pay $200 I said that's ship for a radio program so what they did then every every Ser after the service so the radio program will start at one all of them in the island you know from uh outside of the Mainland in the island they will open the radio and they will follow it until they catch up praise God Hallelujah and then one of the one of the fruits of the radio program is this church in island in it it's a it's an island no separated from the mainland see the pastor when when when they when they are going in the uh on the field say his son said father this this is these are new you want maybe you try to listen when they listen he said yeah I like it what I like what I'm hearing so he called a brother Sami and he said he wants to be re baptized you know so he said he said to brother Sami can you help me just to cross the to cross the sea so I told them yeah just make a way for them to cross then I will I will pay back them you know then we baptize him he he he he come to the mainland you know when he want when we baptize him then I AB we ask him to we we asked him to testify in the radio while he was testifying in the radio see um their mother Church kick him out when he went back to the island he is no more they kick him out see but then 50 50 they they are only 75 members in the church 50 o o other member come with him see and we re baptized them and he only asked me one one thing he said pastor say can I can I ask a favor from you I said what do you what do you need we need a guitar because we have no more guitar okay so I buy a guitar for them then and what and they they're fellowshipping you know under the tree and and and unbeliever saw them

been working with the BCF I told them now we have this moral responsibility maybe we can help them see yeah we help them here it is look at those uh Boulders you know that that church really built upon the upon the rock praise God see now there it is see now we built the church see these are the these are the people in the church praise God hallelujah so this is the pastor we bought uh you know we bought a chair he needs to put it in the ferry to cross the sea to go you know Hallelujah then this uh prison ministry you know this prison ministry one the head of the inmat uh one of our brother went into Jail uh because he was falsely accused then the head of the inmates uh was curious how come that he is not participating in any religious activities in the in the city jail then he asked our brother what do you believe is said I believe this he show him the spoken word and that head of the enemy said I have that kind of book before but I gave it to another inmat then he said okay see then

this morning this afternoon certainly enjoyed that [Music] today we have many many points today that we heard certainly thank the Lord for it's wonderful though especially to see the Lord moving providing for his children amenallah and you know the prophet said as soon as we lose that burden in our lives then we need to get back to the altar we need to be searching for Souls amen I really like the way brother Nestor said it today I believe the Lord said it to us you know we're no longer dealing with the Son of God Ministry and that might have been misinterpreted that we're no longer it's no longer the Son of God we know that there is a Son of God and and we have the Son of God is Jesus Christ but he was the representation of God himself and morphe and we know that through kosis he pours himself out and we have been given the opportunity to see Christ is the mystery of God revealed but now through the Holy Spirit In Our Lives you are the mystery of Christ revealed and that's what we heard today I think it's just a wonderful wonderful message we had you know and AR Gap we heard that perfect justification and that's for something that was never lost and it was never someone else's it was always his we uh we've gone over time I know some people might be getting fussy because we have a a seminar coming up for 2:00 we had said we'll just bump it a little further just relax don't worry be flexible or we get bent out of shape right we just need to give room for the spirit to move amen and not be stuck in a rut right but I just think it's so wonderful that you know the quote that the brother read today is just so beautiful we become the blood of Christ how by the spirit it's by his spirit and without his Spirit we're just like every other human being on Earth We're certainly thankful for the word thank you brother P for coming today for yielding yourself we certainly want to continue accelerating in the ripening God bless you brother let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just love you and we thank you for your goodness and your Tender Mercies to us Lord thank you for sending brother ner our way Lord Jesus thank you for giving us ears to hear and eyes to to see what your spirit's saying to the church even today thank you Lord Jesus for the visual to understand that there's brothers and sisters of light precious Faith around the world that are struggling Lord Jesus and many times we have all of our needs met and even when one of our our our simple little needs gets interrupted we can find ourselves getting upset but Lord our brothers and our sisters on the mission field without shoes on their feet without a a way to get around without a a roof over their Church without food to eat Lord help us help those who need it father we pray that you would just bless brother Nestor and his wife sister Hannah Lord Jesus that you would just keep your hand upon them you would restore their strength Lord that you would just
