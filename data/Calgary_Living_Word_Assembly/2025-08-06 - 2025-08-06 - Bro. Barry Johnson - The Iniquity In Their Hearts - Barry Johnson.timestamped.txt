[3:17] come forth, Lord, faith cometh by
[3:18] hearing and hearing your word, Lord,
[3:20] that we'd worship you that way, Lord.
[3:22] Not our minds drifting into things that
[3:25] we we have to take care of tonight or
[3:27] tomorrow, but Lord, may we focus and
[3:29] concentrate on the King of Kings that's
[3:31] in our midst tonight. Lord, you promised
[3:34] you'd be here and you never ever miss an
[3:36] appointment. Not one time have you ever

[4:08] that that that tongue can't can't even
[4:10] explain. There's not songs that can be
[4:12] written that can explain that land. But
[4:14] Lord, we're longing for it. We know you
[4:16] place in our hearts a desire to see you,
[4:19] to worship you, to walk those streets of
[4:21] glory, one glorious day. And Lord, with
[4:23] all of us, Lord, each one of us, Lord, a
[4:27] a a representation, an an attribute of

[4:46] you all the praise that you're worthy
[4:48] of. Lord, may our hearts just receive
[4:50] the word gladly as it comes forth. Bless
[4:53] our precious brother that's labored for

[5:00] name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated tonight.
[5:07] Well, this world is not my home. I'm
[5:11] just a passing through.
[5:15] My treasures are
[5:18] somewhere beyond the blue.
[5:22] The angels beckon me
[5:25] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[5:30] feel that in this world anymore.
[5:39] I have no friend like you.
[5:44] Not my home.

[6:05] happy with that? And that's one thing I
[6:08] know. I fixed it up with Jesus
[6:14] many years ago. Oh, I know he'll see me

[11:21] Is that right?
[11:23] &gt;&gt; What a day
[11:25] that will be.
[11:28] When my Jesus

[15:02] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful thing it is to be able
[15:04] to cry that.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; If you have a need tonight, maybe just
[15:09] make it known unto him by way of an
[15:10] uplift hand as we go to him in prayer.
[15:14] Gracious heavenly father, tonight we
[15:16] just thank you that we can gather
[15:17] together one more time in your name.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; We know that when we gather together in
[15:22] your name, the name above every name,
[15:24] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[15:27] &gt;&gt; that you're there
[15:29] in our midst, we welcome you here
[15:32] tonight, Father.
[15:34] Lord Jesus, tonight we just ask that,
[15:37] Father, according to your word, that you
[15:39] would just do exceedingly and abundantly
[15:41] above all that we could ask or think.
[15:43] Lord,
[15:44] &gt;&gt; let us cast down our own imaginations
[15:47] right now, Father, before your throne.
[15:49] We know that our thoughts are louder in
[15:50] heaven than our words here on earth,
[15:53] Father. And Lord, we pray that we would
[15:55] just have honest, sincere hearts, Lord,
[15:58] that we would desire, Lord Jesus, the
[16:00] sincere
[16:02] &gt;&gt; meat of your word.
[16:04] Father, that we would desire to be
[16:06] changed by this word, Lord. That it
[16:08] would not be on books and tapes, that it
[16:10] would not be in an association, but Lord
[16:13] Jesus, that it would truly be a living
[16:15] word.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; Living out through your bride tonight.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to commit this
[16:21] service into your hands. Father, we pray
[16:23] that you would, Lord Jesus, meet each
[16:26] and every need that was made known unto
[16:28] you by way of an uplift hand. We know
[16:30] that you're more than able. Father, we
[16:32] pray that you would be with the Huckluck
[16:34] family, Lord, and the assembly at
[16:36] Edmonton Living Word, Lord.
[16:39] Father, we pray, Lord Jesus, that you
[16:41] would just be with the unspoken request
[16:44] tonight, Lord.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[16:46] &gt;&gt; and Father, we just want to thank you so
[16:49] much, Lord, for your traveling mercies.
[16:52] Thank you for bringing Brother Peter
[16:54] home to us once again.
[16:56] Father, we're so grateful for all that
[16:59] you do for us every day of our lives,
[17:01] Lord.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; We just thank you, Lord. And we just ask
[17:04] now all these things in Jesus Christ's
[17:06] name we pray. Amen.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you musicians. Thank you
[17:11] once again for your service unto the
[17:13] King. If you have your Bibles tonight,
[17:16] I'll try not to keep you standing long.
[17:18] I just like to read from Matthew chapter
[17:20] 24 and uh perhaps get into the scripture
[17:23] that I wanted to on Sunday
[17:26] &gt;&gt; but did not because I guess I just
[17:28] followed the leadership of the Lord and
[17:31] we didn't even get into the notes but I
[17:33] just think there's so much in here
[17:34] that's
[17:36] &gt;&gt; important in Matthew chapter 24
[17:40] &gt;&gt; verse 10
[17:43] it says and then shall many be offended
[17:46] and shall betray one another and shall
[17:48] hate one another.
[17:51] And many false prophets shall rise and
[17:53] shall deceive many. And because iniquity
[17:57] shall abound, the love of many shall wax
[18:00] cold.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; But he that shall endure unto the end,
[18:07] &gt;&gt; the same shall be saved.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time.
[18:12] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we just
[18:14] thank you for your word, Lord. Thank you
[18:16] that Lord Jesus, even though it's
[18:19] possible humanly for your children to be
[18:21] offended, you can bring the healing.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; And Father, we know that anyone who is
[18:28] offended will not remain that way.
[18:31] Because there's not going to be
[18:32] different divisions in heaven.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; There isn't divisions on earth.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; It's one body. Yes.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, tonight one one more
[18:43] time, we just invite you, Father, to
[18:46] surgically deal with each and every one
[18:48] of our hearts, Father, as your spirit
[18:50] discerns.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; We just commit this service into your
[18:53] hands. Break this bread of life fresh to
[18:55] us once again, Lord. In Jesus Christ's
[18:58] name we pray. Amen.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be
[19:00] seated.
[19:02] Just have a few announcements uh that I
[19:05] need to make. And uh yeah, so we just
[19:10] have the youth hike coming up on
[19:12] Saturday, I believe, August the 9th. And
[19:15] uh this Saturday also there's going to
[19:17] be a a private funeral for brother
[19:19] Johnny Huckluck who passed away. We had
[19:22] prayed for him some time back and he was
[19:24] in our our midst not long ago and I know
[19:27] that it's uh it's an amazing thing to
[19:30] see that the Lord chose to take him home
[19:33] and he checked himself into the hospital
[19:35] and I think within about a day he
[19:38] actually passed away. So, uh, I asked
[19:42] about the funeral and, uh, I found out
[19:44] from the family they're having a private
[19:46] graveside service and, uh, they just
[19:48] have requested that, um, nobody really
[19:52] comes. So, pray for the Huckleak family.
[19:55] They've had a real hard time, a real
[19:58] hard time. The Lord has allowed that
[20:00] family to walk through uh, the valley
[20:02] for a few years now. they they lost one
[20:05] son, then they lost the dad, and now
[20:08] they've lost another son. So those uh
[20:12] those people who remain definitely can
[20:14] use prayer. Just wanted to announce uh
[20:17] brother Tim Ashong is coming August the
[20:19] 13th. We have brother Gif Marufu here on
[20:22] September the 7th. And uh please don't
[20:25] forget brother Andrew Glover here in
[20:27] September. Uh we have uh Friday service
[20:29] at 7:30, Saturday at 6:00 p.m. and
[20:32] Sunday at 10:00 a.m. And as usual,
[20:35] Saturday we will plan for a breakfast
[20:38] and uh maybe we'll just see if we can't
[20:40] have uh a group breakfast this time.
[20:42] Maybe the brothers and the sisters
[20:44] because it seems to be it's just been
[20:45] the brothers. Maybe we can do something
[20:47] with everyone. I think it would be uh
[20:49] wonderful just to get together and have
[20:51] a little a little another time of uh
[20:53] fellowship. Also wanted to mention that
[20:56] we're going to have youth services
[20:57] Friday uh Friday September the 26 we're
[21:01] going to start them and uh they will
[21:03] just be the last Friday of every month
[21:06] Lord willing and uh we can just sort of
[21:08] pencil that in and go forwards and trust
[21:11] the Lord will bless it. Are you happy
[21:13] tonight?
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Certainly wonderful to be together in
[21:18] his presence. I just wanted to uh read
[21:20] our scripture one more time here. verse
[21:23] 10 of Matthew chapter 24.
[21:26] And uh then and then shall many be
[21:30] offended and shall betray one another
[21:32] and shall hate one another. And many
[21:35] false prophets shall rise and shall
[21:37] deceive many.
[21:39] And because iniquity shall abound, the
[21:42] love of many shall wax cold. Now I just
[21:45] want to read that tonight out of the
[21:46] Amplified Bible. It says, "And then many
[21:50] will be offended and repelled and will
[21:53] begin to distrust and desert distrust
[21:56] and desert
[21:59] him whom they ought to trust and obey."
[22:04] And that just really kind of strikes a
[22:06] chord with me,
[22:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Because who is it that they ought to
[22:10] trust and obey?
[22:12] &gt;&gt; I believe there's many layers to that.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; It can be parents.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; It can be friends. It can be spouses. It
[22:20] can be leadership.
[22:22] There's many different different people
[22:24] that can fit that description. Him whom
[22:27] they ought to trust and obey and will
[22:30] stumble and fall away and betray one
[22:32] another and pursue one another with
[22:35] hatred.
[22:37] Now, we can look at that and say that's
[22:39] actually taking place even right now.
[22:41] And I think it's really important to
[22:43] even though we look at this scripture
[22:45] and say, well, this is Jesus telling his
[22:47] disciples about what will happen because
[22:48] we know they asked him a question and he
[22:51] gave them a multi-part answer to their
[22:54] question. They gave him a multi-art
[22:56] question as well. But he really went
[22:58] into detail with them and and sometimes
[23:00] reading scripture, we can look at it and
[23:02] think it's just going to be out there
[23:04] somewhere. especially when we come to
[23:06] prophecy, prophetic utterances that
[23:08] happen and uh maybe not even realize
[23:11] that they're actually happening, taking
[23:12] place in the day in which we live. And I
[23:14] know myself, it became a real revelation
[23:16] to me when brother Brandham would speak
[23:19] the words that I don't think anybody
[23:21] else has really ever spoken. Maybe they
[23:23] have, but have never really made it as
[23:25] famous as he did. and and that is that
[23:27] you know in the day when Jesus was on
[23:30] the cross they the most religious in in
[23:32] in the message uh which one is it now he
[23:35] talks about it there the most religious
[23:37] place on earth they the most religious
[23:40] people on earth crucified our Lord they
[23:43] took him and they put him up on the
[23:45] cross they scourged him they mistreated
[23:48] him they they belittled him they did all
[23:50] those things to him and not realize that
[23:54] he was actually the fulfillment of the
[23:55] scripture that they claim to believe.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; That's why I say, brothers and sisters,
[24:01] we need the Holy Ghost.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we'll be just like them.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; We will be just like them. Brother
[24:07] Bradam says it very clearly that we are
[24:08] lost as lost can be. We are we are lost
[24:11] without the Holy Ghost in our lives. We
[24:13] will never be able to interpret this
[24:15] word. And and what's more, we won't be
[24:17] able to just interpret this word. We'll
[24:19] never be able to live this word. And I
[24:21] think that's really the stumbling block
[24:22] for children today when they say, "I I I
[24:25] just can't live it." Nobody can live it.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; But when he, the spirit of truth, comes
[24:30] and lives inside of us, he's the one
[24:31] that lives the word.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; It's not us.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; But you know, many false prophets will
[24:36] rise up and deceive and lead many into
[24:39] error. And the love of the great body of
[24:43] people.
[24:45] What's the great body of people? I can't
[24:47] help but think there's only one great
[24:49] body of people. The love of the great
[24:52] body of people will grow cold because of
[24:55] the multiplied lawlessness and iniquity.
[24:59] But he who endures to the end will be
[25:02] saved. It's just such a beautiful
[25:03] thought.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; I love that thought. He who endures to
[25:07] the end will be saved. Remember, we're
[25:10] not running a sprinting race. This isn't
[25:12] the 500yard dash. This isn't the 10year
[25:15] dash. It's not even a 15-year dash. This
[25:18] is this is a marathon.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; And we have got to run at a decent pace.
[25:23] We have to pace ourselves. And you know
[25:25] when we trip and fall, not if, when we
[25:27] trip and fall, just get up and run. Get
[25:30] up and go.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; Even if you have to walk, just walk. But
[25:34] get up again.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; We cannot just lay down. We cannot just
[25:39] quit. But it is until the end. He who
[25:41] endures to the end will be saved.
[25:45] You know, for some people the end will
[25:47] come quickly. And for some people, the
[25:49] end will actually last long. It will
[25:52] take a long time. Uh maybe they'll have
[25:54] good health and live a long time on
[25:56] earth. You know, again, we can look at
[25:58] this this scripture and say, "He who
[26:00] endures to the end will be saved." Maybe
[26:01] these are the people that are just going
[26:03] to be there at the time of the rapture
[26:04] or even beyond the time of the rapture
[26:06] when we're dealing with the wise and the
[26:08] foolish virgins, the the wise and the
[26:10] unwise virgins. You know, I I'm not
[26:12] going to go there with that tonight. I
[26:14] think that's a whole other series that
[26:17] can be preached on. But this this
[26:19] thought about he who endures to the end
[26:20] will be saved. When we reach the end of
[26:23] our road, are we enduring in this word?
[26:26] Is that word enduring and abiding in us?
[26:29] If it is, we will be saved.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; I think it's just beautiful. Looking at
[26:34] this amplified version, you know, many
[26:37] will be offended and repelled and begin
[26:38] to distrust and desert and will stumble
[26:41] and fall away and betray one another and
[26:44] pursue one another with hatred. It just
[26:47] really got me thinking about uh about
[26:49] brother Brandham and the preview of the
[26:51] bride. Isn't it interesting that he had
[26:55] we know he had two versions, two
[26:57] visions, it was one vision, but he had
[26:59] two previews of the bride. And uh it's
[27:03] just beautiful how he talks about it.
[27:06] I'm not going to get too far into that,
[27:08] but in the preview of the bride, she was
[27:10] shown twice. And you know, um I'll I'll
[27:12] probably read the quote a little bit
[27:14] later tonight. What happened with the
[27:17] preview of the bride? First, Brother
[27:20] Brham was shown the church and and that
[27:23] church was the church of America. And we
[27:26] know that brother Brham said, "Is this
[27:28] all that all this ministry, all that
[27:30] we've worked for? This is all that it's
[27:32] come to? It's terrible."
[27:36] &gt;&gt; And we know the description that he
[27:37] gives. I won't read it tonight just for
[27:39] time's sake. I've got some other quotes
[27:41] that I want to bring, but I I just I
[27:44] would recommend maybe go back and read
[27:46] it. go back and and listen to it and
[27:48] hear the way he describes the church,
[27:50] not not the general people, the the
[27:53] Gentiles in this world, not the
[27:55] unbelievers. He's talking about the
[27:57] church.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; It just really struck me when I was
[28:01] looking at this how he's speaking about
[28:02] the church. This is the preview of the
[28:05] church, but not the true church. I would
[28:09] say this would be this would be the
[28:11] unwise virgins, the ones that really
[28:13] think they're trying to do something.
[28:15] And we know, brother Brandham, he says
[28:17] in one place that that group was led by
[28:19] a what? By a witch. He said that they
[28:22] were led by a witch. My goodness. But
[28:25] that doesn't mean that they don't have a
[28:27] sincere heart. They could have a very
[28:29] sincere heart and desire to worship God.
[28:32] you know, and the god of this evil age.
[28:34] Brother Brandham says there'll be
[28:35] millions and billions of impersonators
[28:37] of Jesus Christ, thinking that they're
[28:38] worshiping God and actually worshiping
[28:41] the devil, not at a a temple set up to
[28:44] Molech or or Baal. It won't be temples
[28:47] like that. It'll be temples unto the
[28:49] living God,
[28:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[28:51] &gt;&gt; They'll be playing music. They'll be
[28:53] singing songs, clapping hands, jumping
[28:55] up and down, and thinking that they're
[28:57] worshiping God when they're actually
[28:58] worshiping Satan. Now, what's the
[29:00] dividing line? This is where it gets
[29:01] good. I'm so glad that the spirit of the
[29:03] Lord comes around and begins to discern
[29:05] the hearts of the people because what
[29:07] that is, the difference between the two,
[29:09] brothers and sisters, is real simple.
[29:11] It's oil. It's oil. And and to bring it
[29:14] right down to common terms, it's not
[29:16] going to be a a nebulous thing or some
[29:18] sort of a comparison that way. It's
[29:20] right simple. It's either full obedience
[29:23] to the complete word of God for your
[29:25] day.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Which entitles you to the token or not.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. full complete obedience to
[29:30] the word of God or not. That's the
[29:33] dividing line.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; One word off is Satan's Eden. One word
[29:38] off caused the fall of mankind. The
[29:41] woman saying, "Hey,
[29:43] maybe we won't die."
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Why? Because someone who she should have
[29:49] trusted misled her.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Who was that that she should have
[29:54] trusted in the garden?
[29:58] Yeah, she should have been listening to
[30:00] her husband. But we know as soon as we
[30:01] get out from behind the word of God, we
[30:03] become fair game for the devil.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; And how do we get out from behind the
[30:07] word of God, brothers and sisters? How
[30:09] do we get out from behind the word of
[30:11] God? If this is the word of God, how
[30:12] would I get out from I would take a step
[30:14] out, wouldn't I?
[30:16] &gt;&gt; By taking a step out, I'm actually now
[30:18] out from behind the pulpit
[30:20] &gt;&gt; to get out from behind the word of God.
[30:22] We take a step out. And we've heard it
[30:24] said probably in the past that ministers
[30:26] will talk about it and say there will be
[30:27] a red flag and alls we have to do is
[30:30] step over it. Step over it. Brother
[30:33] Brandham talks about uh from that time,
[30:36] right? From that time. We're familiar
[30:38] with that. From that time, that one time
[30:41] I decided to take a drink of alcohol.
[30:43] From that one time, I had a little teeny
[30:46] puff of a cigarette. From that one time,
[30:48] I said, "Okay, I'll allow myself to
[30:50] listen to that rock and roll." from that
[30:52] one time I watched that one movie.
[30:54] Getting out from the word of God is
[30:57] going to take us way further than we're
[30:59] prepared to go.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; But one word off is actually Satan's
[31:05] kingdom.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; And you know, to take the message of the
[31:09] hour and something that Brother Brandon
[31:12] would teach, a principle that he would
[31:13] teach in here, and for us to say, "Well,
[31:16] I don't know if I need to do that
[31:18] necessarily."
[31:20] Guess what? I'm going to say it real
[31:22] clear. We believe the message of the
[31:24] hour. We believe the message of William
[31:26] Mryiam Brown because it wasn't William
[31:28] Miams Brownham's message. It was the
[31:30] Lord Jesus Christ message that he gave
[31:32] to his prophet according to Amos 3:7.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; So when we decide we're going to do
[31:38] something just a little bit different
[31:39] than what that prophet said,
[31:42] &gt;&gt; we're getting out from behind the word
[31:43] of God. Amen.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; It's no longer full obedience to the
[31:49] complete word of God. Now, some people
[31:51] are saying, "I know it. Oh, Brother
[31:52] Barry, how could you say that William
[31:54] Miriam Brham's word is the same as the
[31:56] word of God?"
[31:58] Because he was God's mouthpiece
[32:02] &gt;&gt; and everything that he taught went back
[32:03] to the word of God. And there was times
[32:05] where he taught things that weren't
[32:07] according to the word of God and God
[32:09] revealed it to him and he apologized for
[32:11] it and changed his way. Amen.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; But we know that Satan doesn't like to
[32:18] be exposed.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Satan likes to hide. Satan likes to
[32:22] deceive. Satan likes to be a deceiver.
[32:27] I just think it's beautiful. We can see
[32:29] the identification of the the church in
[32:32] the last day. Then shall they deliver
[32:35] you up to be afflicted and shall kill
[32:37] you, and you should be hated of all
[32:39] nations for my name's sake. and and then
[32:43] shall many be offended and betray one
[32:46] another and shall hate one another. I
[32:48] just want to say this, brothers and
[32:50] sisters, if we have any hatred in our
[32:51] lives for another human being on this
[32:54] earth, then we actually need to go back
[32:57] to that altar and repent.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this real clearly,
[33:02] this altar is always open.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Someone might say this is, oh, now
[33:07] you're going all Pentecostal on us,
[33:09] saying the altar is open. We're going to
[33:10] have an altar call. We're not going to
[33:11] have an altar call, but if God calls you
[33:14] to come and deal with something in your
[33:16] heart, brothers and sisters, don't
[33:17] delay.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; Come up for prayer.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Get that dealt with in your life. If
[33:22] there is hatred in our lives for any
[33:25] human being, that's not us. That's the
[33:28] devil.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; But he's in us. We need to get him out.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; We need to starve him out of our lives
[33:36] &gt;&gt; cuz he'll take us down if we hold on to
[33:38] him. And how does that manifest?
[33:41] Sometimes it manifests in different
[33:43] ways. I'm not going to say one way or
[33:45] the other, but we can see that it does
[33:48] manifest.
[33:49] And we need to get the Lord to deal with
[33:51] it in our lives.
[33:53] But you know, the love of many shall wax
[33:57] cold. This word love is G G26, agape.
[34:02] We're pretty familiar with this. There's
[34:03] two two kind of types of love that we
[34:06] know of from the concordance. There's a
[34:08] filio which is a human love and this is
[34:10] agapo love. Agape love is is affection
[34:14] or benevolence
[34:16] especially plural a love feast a feast
[34:21] of charity charity and dear and love is
[34:24] what it says. But we know this is a love
[34:27] that's not even human love. This goes
[34:29] beyond the love that we're dealing with.
[34:31] And that's what this word here is in in
[34:34] Matthew, the the agape love, the love of
[34:38] many shall wax cold
[34:41] because iniquity shall abound,
[34:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Iniquity shall abound. And what is
[34:48] iniquity? Iniquity is knowing to do
[34:51] something and not doing it
[34:54] &gt;&gt; or doing something that we know we
[34:56] shouldn't do. It's either one of those.
[34:59] And it's G458. The word iniquity is
[35:04] anomia,
[35:06] illeg illegality,
[35:10] a violation of law
[35:12] or genative case, wickedness,
[35:15] iniquity, transgression of the law and
[35:19] unrighteousness. And you know, we we've
[35:21] talked about this in the past in
[35:22] conversation and maybe even from the
[35:24] pulpit, but what is what is wickedness?
[35:27] Wickedness is masked many times in
[35:30] goodness. People really desiring to do
[35:34] good
[35:35] &gt;&gt; when they're actually doing evil.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; People that aren't raising their
[35:40] children correctly
[35:42] according to the word of God, they're
[35:44] not just actually making a mistake and
[35:47] maybe being deceived. What it actually
[35:49] is is wickedness. It's evil if it's not
[35:53] according to the word of God because
[35:54] it's either good or it's evil.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; People that are treating people in
[35:59] relationships, husband to wife, wife to
[36:02] husband, if it's not according to the
[36:04] word of God, brothers and sisters, let's
[36:06] call it what it is.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; It's wickedness. It's evil.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's either good or evil.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; There's no middle ground with that. But
[36:14] that's where the devil likes to hide. He
[36:16] loves to make it just gray. Oh, we know
[36:20] it's just brother so and it's just
[36:22] sister so. Oh, it's just the way they
[36:24] are. Oh, yeah. No, it ain't.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; It's either good or it's evil.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; And if it's a son and daughter of God,
[36:31] if it's evil, if it's pointed out that
[36:34] it's evil, they will repent for it. And
[36:36] what does repentance mean? It means to
[36:38] change your ways.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Because we can say all we want, I'm
[36:43] sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[36:45] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. When we
[36:46] continually do that and continue on with
[36:48] our ways, what happens is people just
[36:50] tune out. They're like, "Yeah, whatever.
[36:54] Got it. Once again, you did the same
[36:56] thing over and now you're sorry again.
[36:59] Yep. I'm a believer." And and really
[37:02] what happens is you become a liar
[37:03] because you don't believe it. You just
[37:05] simply say you do so they'll shut up and
[37:07] move on and you don't have the awkward
[37:09] conversation. But it's iniquity. Knowing
[37:12] that you shouldn't do something, but
[37:13] going ahead and doing it.
[37:17] Knowing that you shouldn't do something
[37:19] and going ahead and doing it. Doing
[37:22] something that maybe you ought to do and
[37:25] not doing it. Iniquity. Because iniquity
[37:30] shall abound. The love of many shall wax
[37:33] cold. Brothers and sisters, I I hope and
[37:36] I pray that the love of many in our
[37:39] lives won't wax cold. That we will have
[37:42] a burning desire of love in our hearts
[37:46] for many. If we ever lose that love for
[37:49] people, that love for souls, that that
[37:51] desire to help people, then we really
[37:53] have a problem. You know, out of 1951,
[37:57] the resurrection of Lazarus, I uh I sent
[38:00] these on Sunday.
[38:04] 1951 the resurrection of Lazarus. The
[38:07] Bible said because the love of many the
[38:10] sorry the Bible said because the love
[38:13] shall wax cold. The love
[38:16] because iniquity shall abound the love
[38:20] of many shall wax cold. He says this is
[38:24] brother Brandham speaking. That's what's
[38:25] the matter with the world.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; They're dying for love.
[38:30] Now, we're not talking about human love
[38:33] because human love has been turned into
[38:35] a perversion. Human love is often
[38:38] imitated. Human love is is twisted and
[38:41] manipulated.
[38:42] But what the world is desiring is agape
[38:46] love. They're looking for a love that's
[38:48] beyond human comprehension. There's a
[38:51] hunger and a thirst for a real love. He
[38:54] says that's what's the matter with the
[38:56] world. They're dying for love. We got
[38:58] plenty of teaching, plenty of churches,
[39:01] but we need a love of God. Hallelujah.
[39:06] No. What's the matter with me today?
[39:08] Look, I tell you, brother,
[39:11] there they were. I can see her happy,
[39:15] rejoicing. He's talking, I believe,
[39:17] about Mary and Elizabeth at their
[39:20] discussion when they realized they were
[39:22] both about to give birth. and and and
[39:24] Mary prophesied and we know the story.
[39:28] Brother Brandham going back to that. He
[39:29] says, "Look, I tell you, brother, there
[39:30] they were. I can see her happy,
[39:32] rejoicing, and she run threw her arms
[39:33] around her and oh, how happy she was
[39:36] because that she'd heard about it. Now I
[39:39] can hear her say, put her arms around
[39:40] her and begin to love her." And they was
[39:43] hugging one another.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; I like that. Don't you?
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; I like to see women meet another like
[39:50] that. And I like to see men grab. A
[39:53] while ago, a man come out here and took
[39:55] a hold of my hand, just put his arms
[39:58] around me. A young fellow said, "Brother
[40:00] Brandom, I was in your meeting and my
[40:02] little girl was healed with something. I
[40:04] forget what it was." And said, "You
[40:05] stood there and said, "Thus sayaith the
[40:07] Lord, that child will be a certain
[40:09] thing." Watch. He said it was just
[40:11] exactly like that. That's right. And he
[40:14] put his arms around me like that. Amen.
[40:17] I'm just an oldfashioned backwood
[40:18] Sasrash preacher. I like it. Yes, sir.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; I just think it's amazing because that's
[40:25] exactly what he said he saw when he went
[40:28] beyond the curtain of time. Isn't it?
[40:30] &gt;&gt; The only thing is there was no human
[40:33] sensation.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; There was no eilio love there. It was
[40:37] all agape love. Brothers and sisters in
[40:40] their proper position.
[40:44] Now, I think we could take this and and
[40:46] say just for the record in case anyone
[40:48] is thinking it, if the devil is in here
[40:50] trying to corrupt our minds or if people
[40:52] watch this later, you know, we're not
[40:54] talking about the world's perversion of
[40:56] men and men and women and women.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; I rebuke that spirit in the name of
[41:01] Jesus Christ right now. And I'll go even
[41:03] further with it. We know the word of God
[41:05] says that we ought to greet one another
[41:07] with a holy kiss. Uh I've been in Kenya
[41:10] with brother Gilbert and experienced
[41:12] that where the brothers get so excited
[41:13] they come and suddenly you got a brother
[41:15] kissing you on your face and you're like
[41:17] hold on a second let's just shake hands
[41:20] we don't need to do that but you know
[41:21] what that's what the word of God says
[41:24] I could say my culture
[41:27] but my culture is not worth nothing
[41:29] &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters there ain't no
[41:31] culture with the Holy Ghost. So I would
[41:34] say who is in in in in in in the fault
[41:37] there who is wrong. I would say perhaps
[41:39] I ought to examine my heart just because
[41:41] in our culture we don't greet one
[41:43] another with a holy kiss,
[41:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe after service, you know, I'm not
[41:49] promoting that. I don't want to take it
[41:51] and make it a perversion, brothers and
[41:52] sisters. But what I am saying is the
[41:54] word of God reigns supreme.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; And just because someone does that
[41:59] doesn't mean it's wrong. Right.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; But that idea of it being maybe a
[42:03] perversion, a man hugging a man and a
[42:05] woman hugging a woman. That's what we're
[42:07] going to do on the other side.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; We're not going to a
[42:13] doesn't have to be a perversion. Don't
[42:15] do that. Brother Brown, he says this. I
[42:18] like this. He talks about the old time
[42:19] religion here. I like it. Yes, sir. I
[42:22] believe in it. I believe in an old time
[42:25] sky blue sinkilling religion.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. the Holy Ghost.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; You know what? It's the Holy Ghost. It's
[42:35] Jesus. The life of Jesus Christ. The
[42:37] baptism, the true baptism of the Holy
[42:39] Ghost in our lives or bust.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; That's what this is right here. Yes,
[42:44] sir. I believe in it. I believe in an
[42:46] old time sky blue sin killing religion.
[42:49] It don't whitewash you. It doesn't give
[42:50] us a cloak of goodness. I'm a message
[42:53] believer. Oh, I was raised in the
[42:56] message. I've never had to have any
[42:57] scars in my life. Oh my. But has it
[43:01] washed you white?
[43:02] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to say. If it has,
[43:05] say amen. If it hasn't, then it's only a
[43:08] whitewash. And it has to be the true
[43:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost living out
[43:12] through us. Every one of us has to come
[43:14] the same way. It don't whitewash you,
[43:16] but it washes you white. It makes you a
[43:19] new creature in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; And that makes the devil mad.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; And I like that. I think it's so
[43:27] beautiful. You know, we talked a little
[43:28] bit about it on Sunday. It's just in my
[43:30] notes today. I'm going to cover the
[43:31] notes that I didn't on Sunday. You know,
[43:33] we can have a religious spirit, and
[43:34] we've heard brother Bradom say it. We've
[43:36] heard other people say it. It's the
[43:37] worst type of spirit that there is. Why
[43:40] is it? Because it's a makeelieve spirit.
[43:42] It's the one that will come into church
[43:43] and sit down and and act like a believer
[43:46] amongst the brethren. It will be the one
[43:48] that actually tries to actually look
[43:51] like everything is okay. They'll know
[43:53] the quotes. They'll know the scripture.
[43:54] Oh, their life is just wonderful. You
[43:57] know,
[43:59] back in Jesus' day, the ultraorththodox
[44:02] Jews.
[44:04] I remember brother Canon teaching this.
[44:06] They could take the scroll.
[44:08] They could take the scroll of paper. And
[44:11] we know that books were scrolls back in
[44:13] that day. You can see that we've got the
[44:15] words written here, the notes. They
[44:17] could take the scroll
[44:20] that was all rolled up, the Bible, the
[44:21] Old Testament, the law of Moses, and
[44:24] they could take a pin and pierce it
[44:27] through that scroll, and they could undo
[44:30] the scroll. And before they undo the
[44:33] scroll, they could tell you exactly what
[44:35] verse and words that pin pierced.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; They knew their word. But it's
[44:42] interesting because they never knew the
[44:45] word.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:47] And I want to say that tonight, brothers
[44:49] and sisters, we can be ever so diligent
[44:51] with the message of the hour,
[44:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Ultra orthodox message believers
[44:59] and miss what God is doing right now.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; In our midst, right now, tonight.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about in the future.
[45:07] Maybe sometime in a in a meeting in our
[45:09] church here when we're having special
[45:11] meetings. It's right now, brothers and
[45:13] sisters. He is the great I am. He wants
[45:16] to deliver us right now from anything we
[45:18] have need of.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; But are we willing to accept it?
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Or do we have a religious spirit?
[45:26] &gt;&gt; I just want to encourage us to make sure
[45:28] that we don't have a religious spirit. A
[45:29] religious spirit is going to take us to
[45:31] hell. That's where religious spirits are
[45:33] going to go, brothers and sisters. They
[45:35] are not coming up in the second
[45:36] resurrection. They're not going in the
[45:38] first resurrection. They're going to go
[45:40] to hell. and they will actually take
[45:42] whoever is willing to go with them. You
[45:46] know, out of the the resurrection of
[45:47] Lazarus
[45:49] in 1951,
[45:52] talking about this religious spirit, I
[45:54] think it's really important. And brother
[45:55] Bham talks about it, how we could
[45:57] actually be that type of person that
[45:59] would walk down the road and actually be
[46:01] so stuck up, so so pious in our ways,
[46:04] got our nose so high in the air that we
[46:06] would drown in a rainstorm
[46:09] because we believe that God sent a
[46:12] prophet. We believe that everything is
[46:14] just fine in our lives. Brothers and
[46:17] sisters, I'm not saying that we're
[46:18] wrong. What I am saying is let's shake
[46:20] the foundations, the very foundations of
[46:23] what we believe and who we are. Make
[46:25] sure that we've got that Holy Ghost
[46:27] living out through our lives. I heard it
[46:29] said this week. I I I I forgot to
[46:32] mention, brothers and sisters, Brother
[46:33] Cadre Digs sends his regards. He said,
[46:35] "Greet the church for me." He's coming
[46:37] in November. I I forgot the dates to put
[46:40] them down, but you know, I was talking
[46:42] to him and we're talking about this very
[46:44] thing, the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[46:45] And he said, "You know what the problem
[46:47] is in the world today, even in message
[46:49] churches, is many people aren't even
[46:51] preaching this.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; They're preaching the deep things.
[46:54] They're getting into the mysteries.
[46:56] They're getting into all of that stuff.
[46:58] And it doesn't mean nothing if you don't
[47:00] have the spirit of truth in you."
[47:04] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, the seals are not
[47:06] going to put you in the resurrection and
[47:07] rapture.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; The thunders are not going to take you
[47:13] out of the grave,
[47:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:16] It's not going to happen. Understanding
[47:19] all of the mysterious things in the word
[47:21] of God are not going to save you.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; The literal life of Jesus Christ through
[47:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what
[47:27] will save us.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; And that's why we believe this message.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; It's not a a conformity. It's not a
[47:36] cult. It's not dos and don'ts. We we
[47:38] live our lives this way because we love
[47:40] him.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; He directed our path. What does the word
[47:45] say? Thy word
[47:47] &gt;&gt; is a lamp unto my feet.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; And a light unto my path.
[47:53] Thy word is
[47:56] &gt;&gt; But in 1951, Brother Brandham, he talks
[47:59] about this. I had never heard this
[48:00] before. Never heard anybody talk like
[48:02] this. He says, "That's right. 150 pound
[48:04] man has got enough chemicals in him to
[48:06] make 84 cents.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; That's all we're worth.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; My goodness. We'll go out and get a an
[48:13] Armani suit or a Hugo Boss suit. Maybe
[48:16] we'll get some really cool shades. And
[48:19] you know, for the brothers that have
[48:20] watches, I don't want to throw off on
[48:21] it, but we could get a really cool
[48:23] watch. We can get I'm a shoe guy. We
[48:26] could get a $2,000 pair of sho $1,000
[48:29] per foot, man. Like, we could get some
[48:31] really nice gear and think we're
[48:34] something, right? Jump in our Ferrari
[48:38] and pull into our mansion, our house. Oh
[48:41] my. But what are we worth?
[48:44] Brother Brandham said in in 1951,
[48:48] 84 cents for 150 pound man. So I was
[48:51] like, I wonder what that means. What is
[48:53] 84 cents in USD in 1951 equal to today?
[48:58] Maybe it's a few thousand.
[49:01] Nope.
[49:02] $1023.
[49:05] That's what we're worth today, brothers
[49:07] and sisters. Now, someone like me, you
[49:09] know, maybe 200 plus, maybe I'm worth a
[49:12] bit more.
[49:16] But, you know, as a human being, we
[49:17] ain't worth nothing.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; That's what the point is. We ain't worth
[49:20] nothing. The only thing that makes us of
[49:23] any value is his love, his life inside
[49:26] of us.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Because we don't have the the the the
[49:32] iniquity abounding in our lives.
[49:37] our our love won't wax cold for many.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; You know, I I just had to say this
[49:44] tonight. I think it's so good. When we
[49:45] talk about this stuff, we talk about
[49:48] understanding this has to happen by
[49:51] revelation. We can't do it on our own.
[49:53] Understanding what we're talking about,
[49:55] the spirit, the literal life of Jesus
[49:57] Christ. It it takes literal revelation.
[50:00] And what is revelation? Revelation is
[50:03] something that God gives you directly to
[50:05] your heart and nobody else can do it.
[50:08] You can hear it and hear it and hear it,
[50:10] but it's got to be a true revealing in
[50:13] your heart to you. And you know what
[50:15] that is? That brother Brandham calls it
[50:17] the new birth.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; God making himself known personally to
[50:21] the individual. Then God begins to speak
[50:23] to us. And make no mistake about it. I
[50:26] say it many times. I'll say it again
[50:28] tonight. You can get the baptism of the
[50:30] Holy Ghost without actually getting a
[50:32] drop of water on you.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; That's scriptural. We know that. That's
[50:36] what happened at Cornelius's house.
[50:39] That's the Bible.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; But what happened afterwards
[50:43] &gt;&gt; according to the word of God? Full
[50:46] obedience to the complete word of God
[50:48] &gt;&gt; entitles us. And I think it's so
[50:51] beautiful because there is a spirit of
[50:52] entitlement in this world. Why not be
[50:54] entitled about the right things? Why why
[50:56] why not be entitled about what we are
[50:58] entitled to truly the life of Jesus
[51:01] Christ living out through us? I think
[51:03] it's a beautiful thing. We look around
[51:04] and see this impersonation spirit. Oh,
[51:06] I'm entitled to be the first in line.
[51:08] I'm entitled to have the first and the
[51:10] best of everything.
[51:12] We're entitled to have the life of Jesus
[51:14] Christ.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; We're entitled to actually go in the
[51:17] resurrection rapture. We're entitled to
[51:19] actually be able to speak the word
[51:23] &gt;&gt; and see other people become impregnated
[51:25] with this same word that set us free.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; 1951, brother Bradom and believest thou
[51:32] this, he says, you know what's the
[51:34] matter with the people today? We're
[51:37] getting away from that.
[51:39] Don't feel for one another.
[51:44] I say, Lord, help us. This is in 51.
[51:50] don't feel for one another. Why? It used
[51:52] to be when I was a kid, if the neighbor
[51:55] got sick, why we went over there and cut
[51:58] wood for them and help them fill the
[52:02] silo, which means cut their grain,
[52:06] cut their corn, and mama would go down
[52:08] and wash up the kids and get their
[52:10] breakfast for them when someone was
[52:13] sick.
[52:15] But now you don't even know your
[52:16] neighbors dead
[52:18] &gt;&gt; unless you read about it in the paper.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, help us to know our
[52:23] neighbors.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Help us to know our brothers and our
[52:27] sisters in the church.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Because that's why we gather together in
[52:31] the body.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; When one person hurts, the whole body
[52:36] hurts. Amen.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; And I think it's amazing because I I
[52:39] haven't really been to many churches
[52:41] that I would call my home church. And I
[52:43] know many here have had a few different
[52:45] home churches in their lives. And I've
[52:47] heard it said many times that this
[52:48] church has something really special. And
[52:50] I believe that's what it is. And I don't
[52:52] think I started it. I think brother Ken
[52:54] started it. I think the founders of this
[52:56] church started it. What they did was
[52:58] they committed this church unto Jesus
[53:00] Christ. And the leadership of the Holy
[53:02] Ghost is what drives this church. It's
[53:04] not the leadership of man. And I think
[53:06] it's amazing. I I say this tonight, this
[53:09] quote here, because I want to encourage
[53:11] us to just maybe take a closer look at
[53:13] our brothers and our sisters and make
[53:15] sure that everything's okay. When we
[53:17] don't see someone, who's calling them?
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Is it the pastor? Is it the deacons? Is
[53:23] it the trustees? Is it the treasurer? Is
[53:25] it all the offices of the church? Or is
[53:27] it the brothers and the sisters?
[53:30] &gt;&gt; We need to look out for one another. We
[53:31] talked about in the past, you know,
[53:32] Cain's nature is to say, "Am I my
[53:35] brother's keeper?" No, I'm busy. I got a
[53:37] job. I'm busy. I got lots of lots to do.
[53:40] The pastor probably has nothing to do.
[53:42] So, he should be calling them.
[53:45] You know, if God puts him on your heart,
[53:47] that's God saying you should do it.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; And don't think for a second that God
[53:52] doesn't put people on my heart, man. He
[53:54] does. He does. He does. But I just want
[53:57] to encourage us. Let's not see iniquity
[54:00] abound because if iniquity abounds the
[54:03] love of many is going to wax cold and
[54:05] that is a terrible terrible thing
[54:07] especially for our children to see. And
[54:10] uh you know it can actually happen. It
[54:13] can happen. Why can it happen? Because
[54:14] the scripture said so. Because Jesus
[54:17] said so.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; And you know what? When he says it, we
[54:20] believe it.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; And that settles it. So I think it's
[54:23] beautiful because the disciples ask the
[54:24] questions and they get the answers. And
[54:27] when you get the answers, we have the
[54:29] keys to actually avoidance, the keys to
[54:31] preventative measures in our lives. It's
[54:34] just a beautiful thing, you know. I just
[54:36] can't help but think about this this
[54:38] devil. And uh we know that that's
[54:41] exactly what it is that's causing all of
[54:44] this. It's the devil. It's the Satan.
[54:48] It's uh it's iniquity.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Let's put it back where it goes. this
[54:53] iniquity is actually the devil because
[54:56] he's going to do everything he can to
[54:58] stop us from doing what we should do and
[55:00] everything he can to get us to do what
[55:02] we shouldn't do.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care what side of the road we
[55:05] fall on, what's what ditch, the right
[55:07] hand or the left hand. It doesn't matter
[55:09] to him so long as we fall. We can be the
[55:12] ultraorththodox religious or we can just
[55:14] be lax and and laxidasical in our
[55:16] Christian walk. It don't matter one way
[55:18] or the other. But let's not take it and
[55:20] make it our own. I don't want to say
[55:22] that iniquity is ours. Iniquity is our
[55:25] cause. Let's put it back on the original
[55:27] cause of iniquity. And if you turn with
[55:29] me in your Bibles to Ezekiel 28, let's
[55:33] put it right back where it belongs.
[55:37] Ezekiel chap 28 11.
[55:46] Once again
[55:48] according to the scripture
[55:51] God speaking through his prophet
[55:56] prophet Ezekiel verse 11 chapter 28
[55:59] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[56:02] me saying son of man take up a
[56:04] lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and
[56:09] say unto him thus saith the Lord God
[56:12] thou sealest the sum full of wisdom and
[56:18] perfect in beauty.
[56:22] Thou hast been in the in Eden, the
[56:26] garden of God. Who is this?
[56:30] Who has been in the garden of Eden of
[56:33] God? He goes on to say, "Every precious
[56:36] stone was thy covering. There was
[56:39] nothing that you didn't have. the
[56:41] Sardis, the topaz, and the diamond, the
[56:45] barrel, the onyx, and the jasper, and
[56:48] the sapphire, and the emerald, and the
[56:51] carbuncle, and the gold.
[56:54] You know, I just can't help but think
[56:55] while we're reading this, brothers and
[56:57] sisters, what would it be like if God
[57:00] would give us, and I know that he's
[57:02] giving it to us here in his word, but to
[57:04] be able to actually see it with our
[57:06] eyes, to see it with our hearts and our
[57:08] minds by revelation, to actually see
[57:13] Satan in his first estate,
[57:16] &gt;&gt; to see how far he's actually fallen.
[57:21] To think that he would be cast down like
[57:24] he is. We'll carry on here. But to hear
[57:26] this is where he was. This was his
[57:28] covering. The Sardis, topaz, diamond,
[57:30] barrel, onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald,
[57:33] carbuncle, and gold. The workmanship of
[57:37] thy tabets and of thy pipes was prepared
[57:42] in thee in the day that thou was
[57:45] created. He was the leader of worship.
[57:50] He was the one that knew how to make
[57:52] every single sound. He knew how to
[57:55] compose every single song, how to make
[57:57] every single instrument, everything
[58:00] perfect time, perfect synchronization,
[58:03] perfect harmony, perfect pitch,
[58:05] perfection.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:08] But verse 14 says, "Thou art the
[58:13] anointed cherub
[58:15] that coverth,
[58:17] and I have set thee so. Thou wast upon
[58:21] the holy mountain of God. Thou hast
[58:23] walked up and down in the midst of the
[58:27] stones of fire.
[58:30] Thou was perfect in thy ways from the
[58:34] day that thou was created
[58:38] till iniquity
[58:40] was found in thee.
[58:43] Satan,
[58:45] that cherub,
[58:48] he was perfect in all of his ways.
[58:50] Everything, his environment,
[58:53] everything, his thinking, his his
[58:55] creation, all that he did. And we know,
[58:58] I'll take that back. Brother Bradam said
[59:00] that he wasn't able to create. He had
[59:01] everything except for the power to
[59:03] create. He wasn't creating anything, I
[59:05] believe, that God didn't create. So,
[59:08] I'll I'll just back that up a little
[59:10] bit. Forgive me.
[59:12] But he had perfection in the palm of his
[59:15] hand. He was perfection according to the
[59:18] word of God. But what did he do? He had
[59:21] iniquity in his heart. He knew that he
[59:23] should do something and he didn't do it.
[59:26] A and he knew he shouldn't do something
[59:28] and he went ahead and did it. He knew
[59:30] that he would never ever be the son of
[59:34] the most high. He knew that he would
[59:36] never be that one. That's why he said,
[59:38] "I want to be like the most high.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; I want to be on the side of the north
[59:45] sitting in the congregation." But I just
[59:47] can't help but think here in this
[59:50] description, who are we talking about?
[59:52] We're talking about the serpent. We're
[59:55] talking about the devil.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Because who was it that was in the
[59:59] Garden of Eden? Let's turn back there
[1:00:00] for a sec. Let's go back to Genesis just
[1:00:03] for the sake of discussion. Genesis
[1:00:06] talking about iniquity.
[1:00:13] Iniquity.
[1:00:15] This one that was perfect in all thy
[1:00:18] ways. Perfect in all thy ways from the
[1:00:21] day that thou was created. Why? Until
[1:00:24] iniquity was found in thee.
[1:00:29] This is the one that was in the garden
[1:00:31] that we read about in this scripture
[1:00:33] here in Ezekiel.
[1:00:35] Genesis chapter 3 verse one.
[1:00:41] Now the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:00:46] beast of the field which the Lord God
[1:00:48] had made.
[1:00:50] And he said unto the woman, "Ya,
[1:00:53] hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every
[1:00:57] tree in the garden?"
[1:01:00] And the woman said unto the serpent,
[1:01:03] "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[1:01:05] the garden.
[1:01:07] But of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:01:10] the midst of the garden, God hath said,
[1:01:14] "Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
[1:01:18] ye touch it, lest ye die."
[1:01:22] And the serpent
[1:01:24] said unto the woman, "Ye shall not
[1:01:28] surely die."
[1:01:31] one word.
[1:01:33] For God doth know that in the day ye eat
[1:01:36] thereof, then your eyes shall be opened,
[1:01:40] and ye shall be as gods,
[1:01:43] knowing good and evil.
[1:01:46] So what happened here? This one that was
[1:01:49] created perfect
[1:01:52] in his day.
[1:01:54] He was created perfect in all of his
[1:01:57] ways
[1:01:58] until iniquity was found in him.
[1:02:02] He was cast down to the earth and found
[1:02:06] himself in the garden. And what did he
[1:02:08] do? He took that iniquity
[1:02:11] and gave it to the woman
[1:02:14] and persuaded the woman to accept that
[1:02:17] iniquity.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; In verse six,
[1:02:22] it's it's amazing. I just have to say
[1:02:24] this when you look at this scripture in
[1:02:26] in verse four and five. And the serpent
[1:02:27] said unto the woman, "And you shall not
[1:02:29] surely die." Verse five, for God doth
[1:02:31] know that in the day you eat thereof,
[1:02:33] then your eyes shall be open, and you
[1:02:34] shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
[1:02:37] Wasn't she already a god?
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; She was the god of the earth.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; She was the bride of the god of the
[1:02:44] earth. God created Adam to be the god of
[1:02:47] the earth.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; God Elohim was the god of heaven.
[1:02:55] But Adam was created to be the god of
[1:02:56] the earth. And here the devil came
[1:02:57] around and tried to tell her that she
[1:02:59] would become what she already is.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:03:06] master deceiver. Hey,
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; A formidable adversary is what brother
[1:03:12] Brandham said.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; But when the woman saw the tree was good
[1:03:15] for food and that it was pleasant to the
[1:03:17] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[1:03:21] one wise, oh my, isn't that interesting?
[1:03:24] We want to be wise. The tree of
[1:03:27] knowledge of good and evil.
[1:03:29] She took of the fruit thereof, and did
[1:03:31] eat, and gave also unto her husband with
[1:03:34] her, and he did eat. And we know that
[1:03:36] Adam was not deceived. She was deceived.
[1:03:38] She was the one in the transgression.
[1:03:40] But Adam would not let his bride go.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; And that's why I think it's astounding.
[1:03:46] I'll say it every single time that a
[1:03:48] human being could say, "I I believe that
[1:03:50] I could put my wife away. I could put my
[1:03:52] bride away." Who would want to do that?
[1:03:54] Right?
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't want to do it to his wife.
[1:03:59] Adam forfeited his life for his wife.
[1:04:03] Jesus came and forfeited his life for
[1:04:07] his wife. And a human being could still
[1:04:09] say, "I want to forfeit my wife for my
[1:04:12] life." Huh? I don't know, man. I don't
[1:04:17] think that adds up. That's just me.
[1:04:20] But isn't it interesting to look at this
[1:04:22] one word off? Thou shalt not surely die.
[1:04:28] But this is the one that was in the
[1:04:30] garden. We read this in uh in uh
[1:04:35] Ezekiel, right?
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel, what is it? Ezekiel 28:13. Thou
[1:04:43] hast been in Eden the garden of God,
[1:04:47] that cherub that was made to be perfect,
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; which is the serpent,
[1:04:53] which is clearly identified as the
[1:04:55] devil.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Now, this being the serpent, we know,
[1:05:00] I'm just going to say it this way. Well,
[1:05:01] maybe we'll just go on and read here
[1:05:03] since we're here in verse 7 of of
[1:05:05] Genesis chapter 3. And the eyes of them
[1:05:08] both were open and they knew that they
[1:05:10] were naked. You could see that they had
[1:05:12] gone from the veil of the word. They
[1:05:15] came out from behind the veil of the
[1:05:17] word is what brother Brandham taught.
[1:05:18] And and they were actually now living
[1:05:21] behind a lust veil.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Eve desired to lust is what caused this
[1:05:27] to happen. And what happened? Their eyes
[1:05:30] of them both were open. They were behind
[1:05:32] a different veil now. And they knew that
[1:05:35] they were naked. And they sewed fig
[1:05:37] leaves together. They got all religious,
[1:05:38] created their own religion, and made
[1:05:40] themselves aprons. And they heard the
[1:05:43] voice of the Lord God walking in the
[1:05:44] garden of the cool of the day. And Adam
[1:05:46] and his wife hid themselves in the
[1:05:48] presence of the Lord amongst the trees
[1:05:50] of the garden. And the Lord God called
[1:05:52] unto Adam. Adam never called to God. He
[1:05:56] never said, "Lord, forgive me for what
[1:05:58] I've done." God came down and said,
[1:06:00] "Adam, where are you at?"
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; God knew exactly where he was in the
[1:06:04] garden. He wasn't talking about his
[1:06:06] geographical location. He was talking
[1:06:08] about his spiritual location. Adam,
[1:06:10] where have you gone? And the Lord called
[1:06:13] unto Adam and said unto him, where art
[1:06:15] thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in
[1:06:17] the garden, and I was afraid because I
[1:06:20] was naked, and I hid myself.
[1:06:23] And he identified now that he was seeing
[1:06:26] things through a different veil.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; He our speech betrays us, doesn't it?
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Doesn't it? God knew his heart though.
[1:06:38] Verse 11. And he said, "Who told thee
[1:06:41] that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of
[1:06:44] the tree whereof I commanded thee that
[1:06:47] thou should us not eat?"
[1:06:51] And the man said, "The woman whom thou
[1:06:52] gavest
[1:06:54] to be with me, she gave me of the tree."
[1:06:56] Now the finger pointing, "And I did
[1:06:58] eat." And the Lord God said unto the
[1:07:00] woman, "What is this that thou hast
[1:07:02] done?" And the woman said, "The serpent
[1:07:05] beguiled me and I did eat."
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Here we go with that serpent. And
[1:07:11] remember, brothers and sisters, I I just
[1:07:12] think it's so important. It's beautiful
[1:07:14] how brother Brandham brings this. But
[1:07:16] remember, it's the Holy Ghost through
[1:07:17] brother Brandham that brought this to
[1:07:18] this age in which we live in. The
[1:07:20] serpent was not the serpent the way that
[1:07:23] we know the serpent to be. Yeah,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; there the serpent that we talk about
[1:07:29] here is the actual missing link in the
[1:07:32] genetic
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; study of human existence where they
[1:07:36] would say what's the link between the
[1:07:38] chimpanzeee and the human being? What's
[1:07:40] the link between the apes and the human,
[1:07:42] the animal kingdom and the humans?
[1:07:44] There's a break there somewhere that
[1:07:46] they just can never seem to figure out.
[1:07:49] And we know that that is because God
[1:07:52] placed a curse on this creature.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; So, we know the many times you see the
[1:07:58] story books and you hear people talk
[1:08:00] about the serpent, the serpent, how it's
[1:08:01] a snake, and you see the snake and and
[1:08:04] it's represented as a snake in the tree
[1:08:06] with the fruit and and the naked man and
[1:08:08] the woman and and you see that lovely
[1:08:10] picture in the Garden of Eden. But why
[1:08:12] would the snake be cursed to be a snake
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; if it's actually a curse?
[1:08:19] I want to start there. Why would the
[1:08:21] snake be cursed to be what it is? It
[1:08:24] doesn't make any sense.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; If the English language means anything,
[1:08:28] it just doesn't add up.
[1:08:31] But she said to God when he questioned
[1:08:33] her, "The serpent beguiled me, and I did
[1:08:36] eat." Verse 14, "And the Lord God said
[1:08:39] unto the serpent, because thou hast done
[1:08:41] this, thou art cursed above all the
[1:08:43] cattle and above every beast." So, isn't
[1:08:46] that interesting? Doesn't that mean,
[1:08:48] wouldn't you think that that would mean
[1:08:49] that that serpent was actually above the
[1:08:51] cattle?
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; So now he's cursed. He's got a curse
[1:08:58] greater than all the cattle.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; You're cursed above all the cattle,
[1:09:02] above every beast of the field. Upon thy
[1:09:06] belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou
[1:09:09] eat all the days of thy life. But here's
[1:09:12] the critical part to this whole entire
[1:09:14] story.
[1:09:16] Why if they ate fruit
[1:09:19] from the tree, which is what mainstream
[1:09:21] Christianity talks about, and I would
[1:09:23] say this, all of those unwise virgins
[1:09:26] talks about,
[1:09:28] why is verse 15 even in the Bible?
[1:09:31] Verse 15 says, "And I will put emnity
[1:09:33] between thee and the woman." Talking to
[1:09:35] the serpent, "I'll put emnity between
[1:09:38] thee,
[1:09:40] between thee and the woman, and between
[1:09:43] thy seed and her seed." What does that
[1:09:46] have to do with any of this?
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Why would he be talking about emnity
[1:09:50] between the seeds of these two
[1:09:52] creatures?
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; If there wasn't something more to the
[1:09:55] story,
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; why would that be? And it shall bruise
[1:10:00] thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
[1:10:02] heel. And we know this is prophecy. This
[1:10:04] is prophetic. It was actually fulfilled
[1:10:07] in in Matthew 13:25 and 28. It actually
[1:10:11] carries on. But verse 16 says, "Unto the
[1:10:15] woman," he said, "I will greatly
[1:10:16] multiply thy sorrow, and thy conception
[1:10:19] and sorrow, thou shalt bring forth
[1:10:21] children, and thy desire shall be to thy
[1:10:23] husband, and he shall rule over thee."
[1:10:26] And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast
[1:10:29] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife,
[1:10:32] and hast eaten of the tree which I
[1:10:35] commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not
[1:10:37] eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy
[1:10:40] sake, and sorrow shalt thou eat of it
[1:10:42] all the days of thy life. Thorns also,
[1:10:45] and thistles shall it bring forth to
[1:10:47] thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the
[1:10:50] field, and in the sweat of thy face
[1:10:54] shalt thou eat bread. till thou return
[1:10:56] unto the ground. For out of it was thou
[1:10:59] taken, for dust thou art, and unto dust
[1:11:04] thou shalt return. I lived my whole life
[1:11:07] thinking, "Thanks a lot, Eve. You're the
[1:11:09] one that did this."
[1:11:11] But we can say, "Thanks, Adam, because
[1:11:14] you wouldn't let your bride go."
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; So, I want to say this, brothers and
[1:11:18] sisters, anytime you sweat, think about
[1:11:20] this scripture here. Yes, sir.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; When we're sweating in our job, for our
[1:11:24] efforts to provide for our families, to
[1:11:27] put bread on the table, it's because of
[1:11:29] this right here.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; This is why we don't sweat because we're
[1:11:34] created to be sweaters. No, no, no, no,
[1:11:37] no, no, no. This is actually the curse.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; I think it's amazing, too, because when
[1:11:41] we look at this, God cursed the woman in
[1:11:45] her body and he cursed man through his
[1:11:48] environment. That's right.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; He cursed the snake to be a different
[1:11:52] creature alto together. It's pretty
[1:11:54] amazing when you look at it.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; But this is exactly the one who hast
[1:11:58] been in Eden, the garden of God. This
[1:12:01] one that was perfect in thy ways from
[1:12:04] the day that thou was created. This is
[1:12:06] the serpent. Turn turn with me over to
[1:12:08] Revelations chapter 12. I really didn't
[1:12:11] mean for this to become a Bible study,
[1:12:12] but I find ourselves here. So, let's go.
[1:12:16] Revelations chapter 12.
[1:12:19] I just think it's beautiful. Let's put
[1:12:21] this iniquity that we're talking about
[1:12:23] right back on the owner of this
[1:12:24] iniquity. This is where it was found
[1:12:27] originally. It was found in heaven in
[1:12:29] the heart of Satan, in the heart of
[1:12:32] Lucifer, in the heart of that cherub
[1:12:34] that was created perfectly. It wasn't
[1:12:36] found in our hearts, brothers and
[1:12:38] sisters. This is something that we just
[1:12:39] have to contend with. It's not something
[1:12:41] that we actually own even. It's not
[1:12:44] ours. This is the devil's and he's the
[1:12:46] one that's going to reap the reward for
[1:12:48] it forever.
[1:12:50] And uh Revelations 12:7
[1:12:53] says, "And there was war in heaven, and
[1:12:56] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:12:58] the dragon, and the dragon fought
[1:13:01] against his angels and prevailed not,
[1:13:03] neither was their place found anymore in
[1:13:06] heaven.
[1:13:08] And that great dragon was cast out." Now
[1:13:12] when was this brothers and sisters we
[1:13:14] can look at the scripture here. Remember
[1:13:16] we said at the beginning of the service
[1:13:17] we can take this scripture and say well
[1:13:19] this is going to be off in the future
[1:13:21] somewhere. Is it or did it actually take
[1:13:24] place already?
[1:13:27] I think many of these scriptures, we we
[1:13:30] we we just need to have a a willingness
[1:13:34] to just step back and say, "Maybe the
[1:13:35] way that I've thought about this my
[1:13:37] whole entire life isn't exactly the way
[1:13:40] that God intends for us to see it."
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Just because mainstream Christianity
[1:13:45] teaches it one way does not mean it's
[1:13:47] actually true according to the prophetic
[1:13:50] utterance in which God sends. But verse
[1:13:53] 9 says, "And the great dragon was cast
[1:13:56] out, that old
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; serpent called the what?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; The devil and
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; and Satan which deceiveth the whole
[1:14:04] world.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; He was cast out into the earth
[1:14:11] and his angels were cast out with him.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; His agents,
[1:14:16] they became the the principalities
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; and the powers. and the rulers of
[1:14:23] darkness,
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; the ones that try and fire their fiery
[1:14:28] darts at us. But if we put on the whole
[1:14:30] armor of God, brothers and sisters, it's
[1:14:32] not something we can just recite. It's
[1:14:34] literally the life of Jesus Christ in us
[1:14:36] by taking the true baptism of the Holy
[1:14:38] Ghost according to the word for our day.
[1:14:40] What happens is we put on the whole
[1:14:42] armor of God and we are able to quench
[1:14:44] the fiery darts of all of those evil
[1:14:47] devils that want to come against us and
[1:14:50] stop us from actually getting the
[1:14:52] revelation of literally who we are
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; once we realize who we are.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; There ain't no devil that can stop us.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; There ain't no minister that can beguile
[1:15:02] us. There ain't no untrue word of God
[1:15:06] that someone can bring. There is no such
[1:15:07] thing as an untrue word of God. But
[1:15:09] there's no word of God that can be
[1:15:11] manipulated in any way that would
[1:15:12] actually lead us astray. If we truly
[1:15:14] have Jesus Christ living out through us,
[1:15:16] he will never deny his word. He will
[1:15:19] deny all of men's words. He will deny
[1:15:21] all of men's traditions. He will deny
[1:15:24] all of the Christianity that people try
[1:15:27] and throw at him. But he will never deny
[1:15:29] his own word. And if someone has the
[1:15:31] genuine sincerity of heart to take him
[1:15:33] at his word, he will honor that. That's
[1:15:36] the only thing that he will honor. I
[1:15:38] just think it's beautiful to look at
[1:15:40] this because we can see the origins of
[1:15:43] iniquity
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; because iniquity shall abound. Just
[1:15:46] because it abounds, it doesn't mean we
[1:15:48] have to say, "I'm on board with it."
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; It's okay because it abounds. We can
[1:15:53] say, "No way. That's the devil's.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Give it back to him." Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; I just think it's beautiful because when
[1:16:02] we look at this scripture, if we just
[1:16:04] read a little further in Revelations
[1:16:07] chapter 12 verse 9 says, "And that great
[1:16:12] dragon was cast out, that old serpent
[1:16:14] called the devil and Satan, which
[1:16:16] deceiveth the whole world. He was cast
[1:16:18] out into the earth, and his angels were
[1:16:21] cast out with him."
[1:16:24] I can't help but think that, you know,
[1:16:26] when we read this, we we look at it from
[1:16:29] maybe a space and time perspective.
[1:16:33] We look at it in the space and time
[1:16:35] continuum sometimes, but we need to
[1:16:36] remember we're talking about an eternal
[1:16:39] environment
[1:16:41] where Satan is cast out. This is from an
[1:16:44] eternal environment.
[1:16:46] And I think it's beautiful because let's
[1:16:47] just continue reading here and then I'll
[1:16:49] I'll preach a little. I think it's
[1:16:51] wonderful. Verse 10 says, "And I heard a
[1:16:53] loud voice saying in heaven." What do
[1:16:56] you think that loud voice was, brothers
[1:16:57] and sisters? Now is come salvation and
[1:17:00] strength and the kingdom of our God. The
[1:17:03] kingdom of our God. This isn't God
[1:17:04] speaking,
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; is it?
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Now has come salvation and strength and
[1:17:10] the kingdom of our God and the power of
[1:17:12] his Christ. It wasn't angels speaking,
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Because the angels don't know about the
[1:17:17] power of Christ. Remember the angels
[1:17:20] will all be silent one day in heaven to
[1:17:23] listen to who?
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; To listen to the redeemed.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God for the power of his Christ.
[1:17:31] The one that came and gave redemption
[1:17:35] where no angel has redemption.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; If they fall from their first estate,
[1:17:39] they're gone. That's it. But not humans.
[1:17:44] Because of why? Because of the power of
[1:17:46] his Christ. Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; The power of his Christ.
[1:17:51] For the accuser of our brethren is cast
[1:17:54] down which accused them before our God
[1:17:58] day and night.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; And I just can't help but think,
[1:18:02] brothers and sisters, now what is there?
[1:18:04] There's just a bumper of blood, isn't
[1:18:05] there? Isn't that what the prophet
[1:18:07] taught? There is an accuser of the
[1:18:09] brethren there nattering, nattering,
[1:18:10] nattering, nattering. What there is is a
[1:18:12] bumper of blood. Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; And the prophet was clearly shown that
[1:18:15] when he was in that diner that day when
[1:18:17] he was accusing that woman who was an
[1:18:20] immoral woman. She was an immoral woman.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; The police officer who you should trust
[1:18:26] the legal guardian of society. You
[1:18:29] should be able to trust him. They were
[1:18:30] misbehaving and brother Brandham was
[1:18:32] identifying. He was condemning them. And
[1:18:35] God showed him this vision. And he
[1:18:37] showed him the sins going up and that
[1:18:41] bumper of blood protecting Christ.
[1:18:47] And he said, "You know those people, my
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; just my words,
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; those people. Look at those sins from
[1:18:55] those people." And what did God say to
[1:18:57] him?
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; It ain't it ain't their sins
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; that's hitting me in the face in that
[1:19:02] bumper of blood. I am the bumper of
[1:19:04] blood and and those sins that are
[1:19:06] hitting me are your sins
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; as the prophet of God. And what did that
[1:19:11] do? It was exactly what he needed to
[1:19:12] hear to go back and actually say,
[1:19:14] "Listen, sister, do you know the gospel
[1:19:17] of Jesus Christ? Do you know the power
[1:19:20] of his Christ?"
[1:19:22] Because I do and I wonder if you would
[1:19:25] like to know about it. And what did he
[1:19:26] do? He went and won her. He gave her the
[1:19:29] opportunity to know Jesus Christ for
[1:19:31] herself instead of condemning her. And
[1:19:34] how ought we to behave in the day in
[1:19:36] which we live. I just think it's
[1:19:38] beautiful to read this verse by
[1:19:40] Revelation and recognize that, you know,
[1:19:42] brethren, talking about the uh the
[1:19:44] eternal time, the eternal place. There's
[1:19:47] no such thing as eternal time, but
[1:19:48] there's a little speck of time in
[1:19:51] eternity. But to look at this and think
[1:19:53] about it, how brother Brandham said that
[1:19:54] he went beyond the curtain of time. He
[1:19:56] went into an eternal realm and he saw
[1:19:58] millions of people that were screaming,
[1:20:01] "You know what? Thank you." Because we
[1:20:03] are resting on that doctrine that you
[1:20:05] preached, which is exactly what Paul
[1:20:07] preached. We're resting on that. And we
[1:20:09] know that he came back and said, you
[1:20:11] know, just keep pressing on. I don't
[1:20:13] want to go back, but if I've got to go
[1:20:15] back, that was the voice that he heard.
[1:20:16] And that was just a very highlevel flyby
[1:20:18] with that revelation. But, you know,
[1:20:20] talking about that, I just can't help
[1:20:22] but think there was a group of people in
[1:20:24] heaven that were able to recognize what
[1:20:26] was taking place here. And they
[1:20:28] recognize that he was no longer there.
[1:20:31] There's just a bumper of blood.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; And that bumper of blood is the Christ,
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; the power of the Christ.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; And you know, verse 11, brothers and
[1:20:41] sisters, we hear this many times. I
[1:20:43] think it's so beautiful. Verse 11 says,
[1:20:45] "And they overcame him
[1:20:48] by the blood of the lamb
[1:20:50] and by the word of their testimony."
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; That's why I think it's so beautiful to
[1:20:57] have a testimony service.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Because the blood of the lamb gives us a
[1:21:01] testimony.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; The blood of the lamb in our life gives
[1:21:04] us the ability to recognize the Christ,
[1:21:08] the power of the Christ, the one that
[1:21:11] actually gives us the life that we live.
[1:21:14] They overcame him by the blood of the
[1:21:16] lamb and the word of their testimony and
[1:21:19] they love not their lives unto the
[1:21:22] death.
[1:21:23] And we know that there's a group of
[1:21:25] people that will actually have to give
[1:21:27] their lives who reject this message who
[1:21:30] reject the message of salvation.
[1:21:33] Many people will say, you know, there's
[1:21:35] there's many different ways that you can
[1:21:36] actually get there. And and if you're
[1:21:38] driving somewhere, sure enough, there
[1:21:40] are many different ways. But Jesus said
[1:21:42] that I am the way,
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; the truth, and the life. And that no man
[1:21:48] comes unto the father but by me.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; That's the only way that we will
[1:21:53] actually see the resurrection and
[1:21:56] rapture in the day in which we live. And
[1:21:58] you know, from the perspective that we
[1:22:00] want because unfortunately there's going
[1:22:02] to be people that see the resurrection
[1:22:04] and rapture and they're going to know in
[1:22:06] their hearts that it's actually taken
[1:22:08] place and they missed it. And I'm not
[1:22:10] saying it to scare us, brothers and
[1:22:11] sisters. I'm just saying it because it's
[1:22:13] a true reality.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; But then there's other people that are
[1:22:16] going to go on having church services,
[1:22:18] wonderful times, and and worshiping God
[1:22:20] and baptizing in the name of the Lord
[1:22:22] Jesus Christ for the remission of their
[1:22:24] sins, thinking they're getting the
[1:22:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the
[1:22:26] rapture will already be gone is what
[1:22:28] brother Brandham said.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; I just think it's amazing to think that
[1:22:32] that could even happen. How could that
[1:22:34] even take place?
[1:22:35] I'm sure that we've all heard other
[1:22:37] ministers talk about what it will be
[1:22:39] like the moment that the accuser of the
[1:22:42] brethren sees the bride in heaven.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Actually sees the queen of heaven, sees
[1:22:49] that the resurrection and rapture has
[1:22:50] taken place and recognizes that now he's
[1:22:54] got three and a half years to accomplish
[1:22:56] anything that he desires. That's all.
[1:22:59] Because after three and a half years,
[1:23:00] he's going to be bound for a thousand
[1:23:03] years. And then he'll be loose for just
[1:23:05] a little season, but he'll be bound not
[1:23:09] with logging chains. Brother Brandham
[1:23:11] says he'll be bound by chains of
[1:23:13] circumstance because he'll be able to go
[1:23:15] and tempt everyone who's in the
[1:23:17] millennium because you know what?
[1:23:18] They're going to have a brand new body.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; And blessed are they that are called
[1:23:22] unto the first resurrection. Right? And
[1:23:25] that's what that is, the millennium. Who
[1:23:27] doesn't want to go into the millennium?
[1:23:29] Who would want to try and make an excuse
[1:23:31] for this message of the hour? This is
[1:23:33] the message that's going to change our
[1:23:35] bodies,
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; I just can't imagine wanting to make any
[1:23:39] excuse for it. Lord, help us.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; But here we have this question.
[1:23:48] Why is the devil referred to as the
[1:23:51] serpent
[1:23:52] in this scripture? I think it's just
[1:23:54] beautiful. Because that old serpent
[1:23:57] which is called the devil and Satan
[1:24:00] which deceiveth the whole earth out of
[1:24:02] Revelations 12, it's an identification
[1:24:05] that God gave us through his word so
[1:24:08] that we wouldn't be deceived. But we can
[1:24:11] take it and and read it and and know by
[1:24:14] revelation that that is exactly what's
[1:24:17] taken place. That that dragon was cast
[1:24:20] out and and that dragon that was cast
[1:24:23] out was identified in the garden in 1954
[1:24:28] out of questions and answers. I'll call
[1:24:29] the musicians as we hit nine o'clock.
[1:24:33] I won't keep us late tonight. I kind of
[1:24:36] over overwent on Sunday. I hope it was
[1:24:39] okay. And uh you know, kind of like what
[1:24:41] we're talking about tonight. I could
[1:24:43] easily have preached it on Sunday. I was
[1:24:44] ready to go with it, too. But I know
[1:24:46] that if you go too far, then uh we can
[1:24:49] actually we can actually have uh
[1:24:56] we can actually have
[1:24:58] people that you lose, people get
[1:25:02] distracted.
[1:25:04] Are you happy tonight? Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Out of questions and answers in 1954
[1:25:09] talking about iniquity abounding and the
[1:25:12] love of many waxing cold. Maybe stand
[1:25:15] with me as we read this last quote here.
[1:25:17] He says, "You don't find that no more."
[1:25:20] What's the matter? The spirit of God is
[1:25:22] withdrawn.
[1:25:24] Jesus said predicted this that the love
[1:25:28] because the love of many their love
[1:25:30] would fail because iniquity would
[1:25:33] abound.
[1:25:35] The love of many would fail. See, grow
[1:25:38] cold, go away.
[1:25:41] The love is dying away.
[1:25:43] And what they got into
[1:25:46] just a form.
[1:25:49] I say, "Lord, help us."
[1:25:51] Beat the piano up and down real hard and
[1:25:54] yell, "Glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:25:58] Praise the Lord." See, like that, it's
[1:26:01] just a form.
[1:26:04] I believe we have the Holy Ghost, Jesus
[1:26:07] Christ, speaking through his prophets
[1:26:09] saying this. Don't fool yourself. See,
[1:26:13] just fooling yourself. See, listen,
[1:26:15] brother.
[1:26:18] Until we I go like this.
[1:26:23] I think it's important to just remember,
[1:26:26] let's not fool ourselves. Let's make
[1:26:28] sure that we understand what we're
[1:26:31] doing. He says, "I'm not talking about
[1:26:34] our tabernacle. I'm talking about what I
[1:26:36] find around the United States.
[1:26:39] It's become just a form
[1:26:42] just kind of acting that we used to have
[1:26:45] and the travail of soul. It's just about
[1:26:49] over. Oh, brother, sister,
[1:26:52] God have mercy on us.
[1:26:55] May God have mercy.
[1:26:58] That travail of soul, brothers and
[1:26:59] sisters, I say, Lord, help us. Lord,
[1:27:02] help me. Let's just bow in prayer.
[1:27:07] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank
[1:27:09] you for your goodness. We thank you for
[1:27:11] your tender mercies in our lives.
[1:27:14] Father, we thank you for your word,
[1:27:16] Lord, that you would give us the ability
[1:27:19] to take the book and eat it up, Lord.
[1:27:22] And even though our flesh doesn't like
[1:27:24] it, Lord,
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; we know that our soul thrives on it.
[1:27:31] And Father, tonight the word that we
[1:27:33] heard, help us, Lord Jesus, to not ever
[1:27:35] let our love wax cold because of
[1:27:38] iniquity.
[1:27:40] Because if we do, it's only because we
[1:27:42] allow Satan to give that to us, just
[1:27:44] like he gave it to Eve.
[1:27:48] Father, I pray that tonight you would
[1:27:50] give us discernment and wisdom, Lord,
[1:27:51] that we would recognize in our lives the
[1:27:54] things that we do,
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; that are displeasing.
[1:27:58] and help us Lord to recognize the things
[1:28:01] that we need to do so that we don't have
[1:28:04] iniquity in our lives because if we do
[1:28:07] we know with the love in our life will
[1:28:10] wax cold father we just thank you for
[1:28:13] your word we know it's our delivering
[1:28:16] power we thank you for sending us
[1:28:20] yourself the Christ
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; and Lord Jesus we know that it's not
[1:28:24] just in print it's not just 2,000 years
[1:28:27] ago it's the book that we eat every day
[1:28:30] and that sustains us from day to day.
[1:28:33] Father, we just ask that you would be
[1:28:35] with those who are traveling, who are
[1:28:36] away, Lord, that you would keep your
[1:28:38] hand upon them. Bless their their
[1:28:41] efforts in everything they're doing.
[1:28:42] Lord, we pray that you would bring them
[1:28:44] home safely at the appointed time. Lord,
[1:28:46] thank you for bringing the visitors our
[1:28:48] way. Father, bless the freezens
[1:28:50] abundantly. Father, we just ask now that
[1:28:53] you would keep your hand upon each one
[1:28:55] of us now as we go our separate ways.
[1:28:58] just ask all these things in Jesus
[1:28:59] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Can we sing 881?
[1:29:06] I'd rather have Jesus.
[1:29:08] Don't forget the prayer meeting tomorrow
[1:29:10] night, 7:30.
[1:29:14] Brother Juma has a prayer request for
[1:29:17] his wife's immigration. It's fully
[1:29:20] underway and we want to continue to
[1:29:22] stand with our brother and remember her.
[1:29:25] We certainly will do that, brother. We
[1:29:28] also want to remind you of the picnic in
[1:29:30] Prairie Park on August the 31st.
[1:29:36] I'd rather have Jesus.
[1:29:38] I'd rather
[1:29:40] have Jesus
[1:29:43] than silver
[1:29:46] or gold.
[1:29:49] I'd rather
[1:29:51] be his than have riches
[1:29:57] untold.
[1:29:59] I'd rather rather have Jesus
[1:30:05] than houses
[1:30:08] or land.
[1:30:11] My brother,
[1:30:14] let my
[1:30:18] dear
[1:30:22] to me
[1:30:37] That's way
[1:30:42] I'd rather
[1:31:05] have Jesus trust you and me
[1:31:10] the lost.
[1:31:13] I'd ra
[1:31:15] be faithful
[1:31:18] to him.
[1:31:24] I'd rather
[1:31:26] have Jesus
[1:31:29] than worldwide.
[1:31:34] I gather
[1:31:37] to truth
[1:31:39] to his holy
[1:31:42] name
[1:31:44] and to be
[1:31:47] the king
[1:31:49] of the master
[1:32:00] this way.
[1:32:05] I'd rather
[1:32:07] have Jesus
[1:32:10] than anything
[1:32:21] to
[1:32:28] li

[1:32:34] food
[1:32:36] is sweet
