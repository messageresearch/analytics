[0:23] I think of all the Lord has done for
[0:30] me. Fully prevailed so I could walk in
[0:35] victory.
[0:40] Since I've touched the cross and felt
[0:43] the pain
[0:46] he forsaking all my life
[0:51] before I've set out for heaven
[0:55] shore to go with him all the way never
[1:00] to return again to
[1:07] yesterday. I can't turn back on
[1:11] him. I turn away from
[1:15] sing. I walk with him every
[1:19] day. There's just no other
[1:23] way. While bridges behind me
[1:28] burn, pressing ahead will be my
[1:33] end. I reached the point of no
[1:41] return. Having put my hands to the plow,
[1:45] I won't look back.
[1:49] Nothing behind could ever match what I
[1:54] now
[1:54] [Music]
[1:57] have. The Savior now that I have come to
[2:04] know has everything I need to
[2:09] grow. To whom shall we
[2:13] go? Don't ever want aart. Yes, it's true
[2:18] that
[2:19] Jesus, he has won my
[2:24] heart. I can turn back on
[2:28] him. I've turned away from
[2:32] sin. I'll walk with him every
[2:36] day. There's just no other
[2:39] way. While bridges behind me
[2:44] burn, pressing ahead will be my
[2:49] earn. I breach the point of no return.
[2:55] [Music]
[2:57] for rich or for
[3:00] poor in sickness and in
[3:04] hell. for better, for worse. So I give
[3:08] you all
[3:10] [Music]
[3:12] myself to heaven to
[3:15] hold to cherish in my
[3:19] heart. A vow even that can ever
[3:26] fall. I can't turn back on
[3:30] him. I've turned away from
[3:33] sin. I walk with him every
[3:38] day. There's just no other
[3:41] way. While bridges behind
[3:45] me, pressing ahead will be
[3:51] my I've reached the point of no return.
[3:57] [Music]
[3:59] I've reached a point of
[4:02] no
[4:05] return. God bless
[4:07] [Music]
[4:13] you. Amen. Let's all stand to our feet.
[4:16] Amen. Let's all stand together. Did you
[4:17] enjoy the song specials this morning?
[4:19] Amen. Thank you to each one who rendered
[4:22] off their gifts today.
