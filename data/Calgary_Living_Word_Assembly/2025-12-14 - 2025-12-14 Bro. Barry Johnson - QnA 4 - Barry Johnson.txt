========================================

[music] Heat. Heat. Amen. Welcome each one of you. Welcome once again in the name of the Lord Jesus. Those of you that are guests, God bless you. Visitors, God bless you this morning. each one of you from various parts [music] of the world this morning. Good to be gathered around the revealed word of the hour. Good to be gathered around the Lord Jesus this morning. Stand with me [music] if you would as we started this service this morning. The voice of my beloved. I was thinking this morning, how many have heard his voice? How many have heard God bless you? I believe we've heard the voice and it's not our prophet's [music] voice was the vocal cords, but it was the voice of our beloved. Blessed be his name this morning. We've heard it and we've seen. We've believed. And here we are [music] testifying of that by our presence this morning. Well, the voice of my beloved, behold, he quickly comes [singing] sweeping over the mountains, [music] over the hills he runs. [singing] I long to hear his voice. I long to [singing and music] hear him say, "Arise, my love, my fair one, come away." [singing and music] Oh yes, it's manifesting time. The fruits are on the vine and our lovely one is coming [music] in plain view. Oh, to have God's [music] chosen bride. [singing] Redemption draweth nigh. He's that [music and singing] lovely one. He's coming in. [music] All the grapes are yours [singing] and mine. Little foxes spoil the vine. [music] For the vineyard blossom [singing] for the harvest time. Keep your eyes [music] on things above. [singing] Don't look at me or you see that lovely one. He's coming in for you. Yes, [music and singing] it's manifesting time. The fruits are on [singing] the vine and our lovely one. He's coming [music] in. Oh, God's [music] chosen bride. Redemption ro. [singing] He's that one. [music] He's coming in. Oh, in the cliff of that rock, in the secret place so high, till the day break, and the shadows [music] flee away. Oh, in that mountain place, a sweet [music] smell [singing] is coming through. He's that one. He's coming in. Oh [music] yes, man. time the roots are on the line and our love is coming in [music and singing] to have God chosen [music] redemption. [singing] He's that [music] lovely one. He's coming here with you one more time. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, it's been testing time. The fruits are and our lovely [music] one. He's coming in. [music] Oh, we have God's chosen bride. Redemption draw. He's that [music] lovely one. He's coming. And there's a fountain open [music and singing] in the house of David [music] to you who would believe. [music] Oh, and there are streams of grace that's [music] flowing [singing] down of Calary. Oh, come now [singing and music] to receive. I love this first verse. And I will take you from the nations and I'll bring you to your own land. [music] Will be [singing] sanctified in you before [music and singing] the eyes of man. Oh, and a new heart will I give you. [music] And I'll place my spirit within. [music] I'll sprinkle [singing] be water on you. And I'll save [music] you from your sed [music] [singing] in the house of [music] to you. [music] The windless stream of operation flowing down from [music] Calary. Oh [singing] come now and receive [singing and music] and I will pour upon the house of my [music] chosen one. the spirit of grace [singing] of supplication. [music] And in that [music and singing] day, oh what a day that will be. A fountain shall be opened [music and singing] up and you shall be holy clean. Oh, [music] there's a fountain [singing] open in the house of [music] David to you. Who would [music and singing] be the stream [music] of grace flowing down from Calary, [singing] oh [music] God? Now receive. Aren't you glad you received it this morning? We've got an open wound to his word, closed to anything else. God bless you, brother Steve. Where did you come in? Brother Steve, would you come and pray with us? Steve, sorry you came in by yourself this morning. God bless you. Would you come and open prayer? God bless you, my brother. God bless you. Good morning saints. God bless you all. Let's just bow our hearts to him this morning. Yes Lord God. We are thankful Lord to be in the house of God this morning. [music] &gt;&gt; Many saints who are joining hands together around this world. Lord God, &gt;&gt; just expounding upon the word and &gt;&gt; opening the door and shining the light for us to see the pathway for us to take &gt;&gt; to that life, eternal life that you've given for us, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, you gave us a special name &gt;&gt; in the name of the bride of Jesus Christ. So Lord God, may we just have that revelation of what that means to us, Lord God, &gt;&gt; and be able to partake in the service in a special way through songs, Lord Jesus, as we just dispel the things of this world, it's maybe on our minds, Lord God, as we sing songs of Zion for your glory. &gt;&gt; And then when the word comes, Lord Jesus, may it find a place, a resting place in our hearts, Lord [music] God, &gt;&gt; open our eyes, change our thinking, Lord Jesus, that Lord God, This will be the day that Lord, we turn the corner and we can see Lord Jesus with greater clarity of what you're asking of us &gt;&gt; as we commit this service unto you now for your glory Lord Jesus. We pray and ask. Amen Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe shake someone's hand as you're seated this morning. Greet a fellow pilgrim, brother, sister in the Lord from different parts of the earth. I think our family here is from Sri Lanka and visiting us this morning. God bless you my brother and sister family. Amen. Aren't you glad you found a friend in Jesus? Let's sing it this morning. Well, I have found a friend in [singing] Jesus. [music] He's everything to me. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my [music] soul. [singing] Oh, the beyond the [singing] valley. In him [music] alone I see. All I need to cleanse and make me fully [music] [singing] sorrow. He's my comfort. It's trouble. He's my [music and singing] strength.

[music] Thank you, Lord. [applause] We've been called up a little higher. &gt;&gt; I was reading Revelation, I think it's chapter 20 this morning. My goodness, the bride has made herself ready. Here we are following the word, just obeying the word as we heard from brother Don. I think brother Barry as well talking about just being being the word, being in church, just feeding and that soul knows exactly what to do with the word. We're thankful for that. Growing up to that place, we'll be caught up a little higher any moment. &gt;&gt; That rapture is upon us. And and you know, as we say these things and sing these things, it's so hard to explain it from our words. But Lord, would you listen to our hearts this morning? Just sing the song with me. How do you explain his love? How do you explain it? It's possible. But Lord, would you just listen to my heart? How much I love you from my heart? Oh, how do you explain? Oh, how do you describe? A love that [music and singing] flows from east to west, runs as deep as [singing] it is wide. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] you know all our Lord. You [singing] know all [music] our fears and words cannot express the love we feel. But we long for you to hear. [music] Oh, [singing] listen to our heart. [music] Hear our spirit sing. A song [music] of praise and glory. [music and singing] Oh, we will use the words we know to tell you what [music] God [singing] words are to tell you. [music] So listen to our hearts. Oh, if words could fall, I pray from these lips of mine. [music] I had a thousand years. Oh Lord, I would still run out [music] of time. But if you listen to our heart [music] every single [music] [singing] [music] [singing] Praise [music and singing] those who have [singing] words to [music] know to tell you what awesome [music] God you are. But words are not enough to [music] tell you [singing] of our love. So listen to us. Oh, if words could fall I [music] gra from these lips of mine. If I had [music] a thousand years long, I would still run out of time. Oh, if you listen to us, [music] every &gt;&gt; [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Thank you for Thank you for the truth. Thank [music] you for the [singing] way he comes. Oh, listen to [music] our hearts. Hear our spirit singing [music] from those you [music] have. We will use [singing] the words we know to tell you what [music] awesome God you are. But words [singing] are not enough to tell you of our love. [music] So listen to our words are not enough to tell you of our love. So listen [music] to our heart. Amen. Let's one more time bow our heads and hearts unto our Lord and Savior Jesus. Father, we're so thankful that thou knowest our heart, Lord. As the song says, Father Lord, our words fail us, Father Lord, but we're so thankful that thou knowest the desire of our heart, Father Lord. Our desire, Lord, is to always every opportunity, Father, to just slip into that secret place with you, to tell you how much we love you, Father. Father, we find in that secret place, Lord, where we can make love one to another, Father, we're giving you our prayers and supplications and telling you how needy and weak we are. Father, you take the opportunity to one more time to fill us aresh with thy spirit, thy goodness, and thy holiness. Father, we stand here today, Father, so thankful for the forgiveness of our past and to be able to stand justified. &gt;&gt; And Father, to be able to look forward by predestination and see our future is so bright. &gt;&gt; So bright. So, Father, we desire more of your spirit, Father, to be able to walk more in your word, Father. For your word is what leads us to that bright future. Father, receive our worship, receive our praise, [music] Father. Lord, we lift our cups up, Father, to be filled, aresh. Father, you told us if we hungered and thirst that we would be filled and satisfied. That is what led us here today, Father. The desire of our soul, Lord, to just Such a sweet atmosphere, Father. Such a sweet presence. That's you, Father. That's you. We recognize you, Lord. We greet you with a holy kiss. We open ourselves up fully to you, Father. We surrender all. Give us that which we have need of, and that's more of you. Father, we be sure to give you all the honor and praise, Lord. We lay our tithes and offerings, Lord, at your feet.

[music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. Welcome to the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Once again, we're certainly thankful to be able to gather together in the name above every name. If you have a need this morning, maybe make it known unto him as we go to him in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for this day and we thank you for another opportunity, Lord, that we can bring our licks of fire together, Lord. Lord Jesus, one more time manifest your pillar of fire [music] here as a body in one mind and one accord in unity. Father, we thank you that we can sing the songs of praise, the songs of Zion, Lord, that we can bring a sacrifice of praise unto you, Lord Jesus. And Father, we just ask this [music] morning that you would receive it. Father, we pray that you would just pour yourself out to us and through us this morning [music] in this service. Lord, we pray that we could push back all of the humanity, Father, all of the circumstances and situations and just give you the full preeminence that you desire in this service. We know that you had your mind on this service before the foundation of the world. And Father, we're excited to hear what you have to say. Lord Jesus, we pray that we could just get ourselves out of the way and give you, Father, all that you desire today from ourselves. Free will, Lord Jesus. Father, we pray that you would meet the needs that are expressed to you today by the way of an uplift hand, Father. Maybe not even by an uplift hand, just in our hearts. Father, we pray that you would just meet those needs. We pray for the unspoken requests, Lord, that you would meet them also. And father, we'll be careful to give you the praise. Lord, now as we turn to your word, we pray that you would just be glorified in all that's said and done. Just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians one more time for giving of your gifts. Just want to turn over to the book of Genesis chapter 48 this morning. Genesis chapter 48. Certainly want to welcome our friends from Sri Lanka. Trust you feel right at home. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 48. Start reading with verse 8 of Genesis chapter 48. And Israel beheld Joseph's sons and said, "Who are these?" And Joseph said unto his father, "They are my sons whom God hath given me in this place." And he said, "Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them." Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him, and he kissed them, and embraced them. And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face. And lo, God hath showed me also thy seed. And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manass's head. guiding his hands wittingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn. And he blessed Joseph and said, "God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my lifelong until this day. The angel which redeemed me from all evil. Bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. And when Joseph saw his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. And he held up his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manass's head. And Joseph said unto his father, "Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put thy right hand upon his head." And his father refused and said, "I know it, my son. I know it." See, he had already gone through a father giving the blessing. Not according to what we see, not according to what we think, &gt;&gt; but according to revelation. &gt;&gt; His father refused and said, "I know it, my son. I know it. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. But truly his younger brother shall be greater than he. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his seed shall become a multitude of nations. &gt;&gt; And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. And he set Ephraim before Manasseh. And Israel said unto Joseph, "Behold, I die, but God shall be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. Moreover, I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for your scripture. We thank you Lord Jesus for the word of prophecy because heavens and earth will pass away. &gt;&gt; But Lord Jesus, thus saith the Lord will never fail. &gt;&gt; And we thank you Lord Jesus that this word has just as much force, just as much power, just as much meaning today as the day that it was spoken. Father, we just commit the words that are spoken this morning into your hands now for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be seated. This morning I have another question I would like to get into. And uh I trust everyone is all right. Today I've come out of a little bit of a cold snap and got some warm weather. It's kind of nice. Today we have another question that I just thought was so good. And you know, many times we can look at these questions and think they're just they're so simple and obvious, but you know, sometimes we just don't understand them and that's why they're written down. And and other times, I think maybe someone might want the pastor to preach on this. So they might write down a question like this in such a way that it would potentially cause a little bit of preaching. And you know, either way, I'm happy to do it because there's really no question that I'm afraid of. If there's a spiritual question, there has to be a spiritual answer. And uh this one here is uh it's actually three questions in one. And the first one says, "Why are the eyes of Israel closed?" Why are the eyes of Israel closed? The next one, number two, and and it's I think written as one question with three points to it. The next one is, why are Jews still following Old Testament even though Jesus in brackets, the New Testament, was with them physically? Why are Jews still following the Old Testament even though Jesus, the New Testament, was with them physically? &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; The third one is, why are they still waiting for Moses and Elijah? Now, I hope we'll get into that third one today, but I can't promise. We'll see what the Lord has in store. But I I think it's wonderful because it just gives us an opportunity to take a look where there's a scriptural question, there has to be a scriptural answer. And uh you know, we can take it for granted. Why are the eyes of children uh blinded? Why are they closed? I mean, they can all see, but I think it goes back to our lesson that we were talking about in Grand Prairie that we preached on Wednesday, you know, a little bit about the story of Elijah and Elisha and maybe the Syrians and Ghazi and the servant and and how, you know, God can open eyes and he can close eyes. And the eyes that are being opened and closed aren't necessarily the eyes that we're looking at this morning that we're blinking through. It's the spiritual eyes that we're talking about. Why are the eyes of Israel closed? There's definitely scripture that we're going to get into about that, but uh I can tell you that it goes back this far in the Bible. This is exactly why the eyes of Israel are closed because the elder shall serve the younger. That is what the prophecy was and still is today. It hasn't changed. I think it's it's interesting when we look at this scripture out of Genesis and you know specifically out of Genesis um 48:14 and Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Ephraim's head who was the younger and his left hand upon Manasseh's head guiding his hands wittingly for Manasseh was the firstborn. it was supposed to be the other way around [clears throat] according to the the way the scriptures were in that day, the the customs of the age. That was the way it was supposed to be. But this word wittingly, he did it. He he was guiding his hands wittingly. This is a Hebrew word 79:19 out of the out of the concordance is wittingly. It's pronounced secal. Sakal and to be causitively make or act circumspect and hence intelligent. I think it's interesting because it's not just accidentally that he crossed his hands. He wittingly crossed his hands. He wittingly did this for the purpose that we could be here today. And uh we're just going to weave that in through the whole sermon. Um but it's intelligent. It's it's an intelligence behind it to consider. Expert, instruct, prosper, deal, prudent, prudently, give, skill, skillful, have good success, teach, have, make, to, understanding, wisdom, behave, self, consider, make, wise, wisely, guiding, wittingly. It was not accidental and it wasn't necessarily just because he desired to do it. It's because God crossed his hands. &gt;&gt; And we know that's where this goes. It's exactly where he goes. Let's turn over to Romans chapter 11 this morning as we get into this. Romans chap 11. Romans chap 11. Why are the eyes of Israel closed? I think it's just wonderful when we have these questions. It [snorts] tells us what's in the heart of the people and it gives us an opportunity to address them. Why are the eyes of Israel closed? Romans 11 verse one. We know this is Paul speaking to the Romans, the first church age messenger from the Ephesian church age. I say then, hath God cast away his people? God forbid? For I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast away his people which he forneew. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What she not? What the scripture saith [snorts] of Elias, how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and dig down thine altars, and I am left alone, and they seek my life. But what saith the answer of God unto him? &gt;&gt; Amen. I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. &gt;&gt; Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. &gt;&gt; Now I didn't even get into the church age book with this. I might have to come back to it and talk about it from the church age book perspective because there's so much in there about election. The Jewish people, the Jews are our brothers and our sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They are elected. &gt;&gt; They are not castaways. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is a strong teaching in the world today that says they're the ones that hung Jesus on the cross. So, they're murderers. Why are the Jews blinded? We're going to keep asking that question. We're going to make sure that we get this loud and clear today. It's such a beautiful thing to think about. Even so, then at this present time also, there is a remnant according to the election of grace. &gt;&gt; Not the election of the Old Testament law. &gt;&gt; Election of grace. mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if by grace then it is no more of works. &gt;&gt; Remember works is faith expressed. Otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works then it is no more grace. &gt;&gt; Otherwise work is no more work. What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for, but the election hath obtained it. And the rest were blinded. You know, in our age, not very long away, not very long time from today, we can see the handwriting on the wall. If you talk to the old-timers in and around this word and the things that have happened, the changes that have come along, we are definitely living right between the days of Noah where it was evil continually in the hearts of man. Continually evil thoughts all about themselves and the imagery and and all of the content that we can post of ourselves online to try and make ourselves appear a certain way. um all of that nonsense, all of that evil in the heart of man continually and then the Sodom condition over here. No other age has lived in between those two conditions but this age and it was prophesied that this people would be in that condition. &gt;&gt; But isn't it wonderful to think that there is a remnant of grace and that grace is only through election. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 8 says, "According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear unto this day." The children of Israel have been given this. Why are the eyes of Israel blinded? Why are the eyes of Israel closed? because of the scripture, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and why is the scripture so that there could be a bride of his own choosing? &gt;&gt; So that there could be a gentile church. That's why the children of Israel's eyes were blinded. I find it absolutely astounding, and I'm sure we all do, to think that people would turn and say that the Jews are murderers, and so we have to mistreat those people. You know, it was it was in within the 24 hours that we're existing right now, there was an attack in Australia specifically on Jews. Terrible to think about, &gt;&gt; people murdered just because they're a Jew. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit that's in this world. &gt;&gt; And you know, for a while, I thought that it was actually I don't know, maybe it's probably going to sound a little political today, but it's okay. We're going to talk the truth. That's all we can do. I thought that this was something that was done and gone and, you know, this this this anti-semitism behavior in people was kind of washed up and and not really so prevalent. But you can see it now. It's in every single university. It's in every single government. It's in every single country in this world. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit that wants to attack the Jews. And when you would see that in what we call the church to persecute our brothers, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Did we not just read that it was because of grace? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; But somehow we can get ourselves in a suit and say that we believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins and the Jews, they're murderers. I think it's beautiful when we can look back through Revelation and really see the truth of the matter. And it's not brother Barry's truth. It's it's the gospel. This is the word of God. It's not even an interpretation of a prophet to the age in which we live in. This is very clear. Cut and dried. They were blinded. For whose sake? &gt;&gt; Our sake. &gt;&gt; So if we ever sing that song, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Can't you see it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you see that you're one of them &gt;&gt; that was just given freely given grace &gt;&gt; according according to Israel [snorts] when he should have blessed the elder he blessed the younger &gt;&gt; the blessing went to the younger &gt;&gt; it's just beautiful to think about according as it is written verse eight God hath given them who's them the elder that we just read about they were given the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day. And you know, I I found it real interesting that when the feast of the Passover happens, um the Jews today even when they set up at the synagogues and and they celebrate the feast of the Passover and and they have their feast, they always have one extra chair at that table. And the reason for that is is they know that Messiah's coming &gt;&gt; and they have that chair there in remembrance of him. And they are very diligent about that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I I think it's so beautiful what you know to take a look at this this story that we were talking about today out of Genesis chapter 44. It goes back even a little bit further and and I just love this story. We preached on this a while ago. Remember we're talking about this question. Why are the eyes of Israel closed? Why are the Jews still following the Old Testament even though Jesus the New Testament was with them physically? Why are they still waiting for Moses and Elijah? I believe that we could pretty much wrap it up just with what we've read already. But I thought, you know, it will be good to just dig into this a little bit and just see what the Lord will do here. But it goes back even further to the story of Joseph and to think that Joseph was one of many brethren, wasn't he? He was born with his brother Benjamin from the same mother, the one that that his father loved. And he had a bunch of other wives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and the wives, remember, they had a bit of a contest because the one that he loved couldn't have children right away. Her womb was stopped up. A and so the other ones began to have children and and and began to name them. And before long, we find out that, you know, the children of Israel, the tribes of Israel, came from all of these brethren born in sort of a competitive nature. And and we know there was a time where where where where Joseph's daddy uh Jacob actually was so angry with the way things happened that he had hatred for one of the mothers and I believe it was Leia. He actually was so upset because of the way things were played out against him. We know that he tried really hard to be obedient but he did have a bit of an edge to his life. He did have a nature. Brother Brandham called him a shyer. He he he was pretty smart guy. He was pretty cunning. He was able to do things in in a way that was really different from everyone else. But you know in sorry I'm I'm talking about Joseph's dad there. But Joseph was born into this family through the wife that he loved that his daddy loved and we know that's Jacob or Israel. But through that story Joseph became a type of Christ. Joseph, he had a wife that he loved. Jacob had a wife that he loved. His father loved his mother is what I'm trying to say. But his brethren hated him for no cause. His He didn't do anything to his brethren. He was a dreamer. He had the ability, the gift to actually dream, dream dreams and actually be able to interpret dreams. He had the ability to encourage people through these dreams. But what his brethren hated was that his parents listened to him. They they thought it's interesting to hear the dreams. And and so in in those situations, it's funny because when you look at it and and you see how Joseph, even though he knew his brethren hated him, they did not like him. They detested him that his parents listened to him, he still had dreams and he still told about his dreams. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I could do that. I might want to just pull back and and maybe be a little bit reclusive and not tell because it would keep the peace. &gt;&gt; But he had to tell of his dreams. &gt;&gt; I I think it's amazing because we know that his dad celebrated him. His dad created him a coat of many colors, didn't he? &gt;&gt; None of the other brothers got that. [snorts] Anybody here have favorite children? Don't raise your hands. But this story, it talks about that. [snorts] And then we see that he actually would have a dream that would say, "You know what? I just had this dream, mommy and daddy." And and the brothers would be listening again. Oh, here we go. Another story, right? And and he would say, "You know, I dreamt that that I was out in the field and and and all of my brothers, they they actually bowed down before me in o obes o ob obedience obesessence to me. And and we know that they said, "Are you serious? You're actually gonna say that to us in front of everyone." But we know that daddy took note of it. He actually paid attention to it. And then he went further and said, "I had another dream. I dreamt that the sun, the moon, the stars, they all did the same thing. Now the they said, "Now you're crazy. Now we know you are a lunatic." &gt;&gt; They went out and they were about their father's business. And we know that he didn't have to go to work because he was the favorite child, right? He got to stay home. He was younger. So all the older brothers were out dealing with the father's sheep and and dealing with the herds and the flocks. But he got sent out to see him. Go [snorts] and give a report, see how these brethren are doing. Because daddy was smart. He knew how they would fool around. He knew their their behavior. He knew what they were doing. And and he just sent out the youngest, the second youngest, just go out and check them out and and see what's going on. And we know in doing that they manifested that life that was in them. It was murder. It was hatred. It was all of the above. &gt;&gt; Persecution. Joseph didn't do anything to them. He just did what his daddy told him. [snorts] But going out there, what happened? They said, "Oh boy, here comes that dreamer. Let's kill him. Let's do away with him once and for all. Daddy will never know. we'll just get rid of them and we won't have to contend with all of this nonsense, all of this favoritism that we have to put up with in our family. So, they devised and they were going to kill him. But, we know one of the brothers, he stepped up and he said, "No, don't do it. Let's do something else. Let's just throw them in a pit. And and and what we can do is take a lamb and and slay the lamb and and we'll bring it and put it all over the coat and we'll say that we just found this shredded coat of as many colors, this favoritism token. We'll bring it back to you with the shed blood of a lamb on it. Isn't that interesting that that would be what they would give back to dad? And they told him, and you could imagine, dad said, "Now I'm going to go down into my my grave with gray hair with this kind of sorrow. So, I've had all kinds of trials and tribulations in my life, and now this is what's come my way. It's amazing to think about. And and this guy, Joseph, he didn't do anything, did he? He just told the truth. I had a dream. This is my dream. Dad, he gave me a coat. I didn't ask him, "Can you get me a coat? Can I be your favorite?" He just did. So, what happened? They didn't kill him. We know they said, "Hey, maybe we could make a little bit of money here. Maybe we could actually do something better than killing him or just leaving him here because he could be found. What we should do is sell him. Let's sell him off. There's going to be some slave traders coming by here. Let's just sell him to them and and send him down into Egypt and and then he'll be gone. He'll just be gone. He'll be a slave and nobody will ever know him. His coat will be gone. It'll be the end of him." And that's what they did. They got some money for that transaction. They didn't just let him go. And it's interesting that they took the money. We're going to get into that a little bit later, but they took the money. They made the transaction. It was a contract. If you do, I will. Right? So, they did. They took the money, gave him their brother, and he went down into Egypt. And and we know the story. It's so terrible to think about how he did nothing wrong. And here he finds himself now probably in a chain gang with slaves being whipped, mistreated, terribly treated, taken down and thrown into the the masses of slaves and maybe go to a slave auction. And now this guy Pontifer finds him and says, "He looks good. He looks strong. I'll buy him and take him back to my house." And we know that he did that. And as he went back, he just lived the life that he was taught. The word of God says, "Train them up in the way they should go and it won't depart from them." &gt;&gt; He never had parents there saying, you know, you got to remember to pray. &gt;&gt; You know, we should have family devotions. We got to go to church. Remember, you got to read your Bible. Remember, there was none of that going on with the parents physically, but you can imagine they had already instilled that in their child. And so everywhere that he went, he just was. &gt;&gt; He didn't act. He just was who God created him to be, who his parents helped shape and mold him to be. And because of that, God's blessing followed him every day of his life. &gt;&gt; And can you imagine, was he thinking, "Oh my, this is God's blessing in my life." when his brothers were jostling around with him and about to throw him into a pit. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? Is this God's blessing for my life as I hit the ground in the pit and maybe feel like I dislocated my shoulder and I didn't do anything wrong? But yet here I find myself at the bottom of the pit. Oh my Excuse [snorts] me. &gt;&gt; That doesn't happen very often here. God's blessing in our lives might not look pretty. It might not be appealing. It might not be the way that we think it should be. &gt;&gt; But does that change the promise? &gt;&gt; Does that change God? Doesn't change his word? My his brethren hated him for no reason. He had a gift and he couldn't help it. [snorts] And I bet he couldn't even understand the gift, could he? &gt;&gt; Probably not. &gt;&gt; It just was. It just happened that way. [snorts] wrongly accused, thrown into the pit, sold into slavery, taken to Egypt, and now [snorts] as a slave finds himself in the house of Poniper. [snorts] But God's blessing is upon him because he just existed the way that he was. &gt;&gt; He wasn't a false pretender. I think that's so beautiful. I think [snorts] there's so much power just in that one thing. There was no desire to try and be anyone other than who he actually was. Somehow he was comfortable in his own skin. &gt;&gt; And I pray that we could be that way as well. But while he was there, God's blessing just followed him because of who he was. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to pretend. He wasn't acting. [snorts] And even in the midst of that, the devil still had to try and challenge him. God's blessing. Think about this. God's blessing was that Poniper's wife would come on to him and actually try and get him to fornicate or commit adultery. For him, it would have been fornication. For her, it would have been adultery. [snorts] But to try and get him to do that was God's blessing. Why? Because he found himself in prison. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't have gone to prison if he didn't actually have that trial, that tribulation in his life. He wouldn't have actually been exalted to the right hand of Pharaoh if he didn't go to prison. &gt;&gt; That was God's blessing in his life. &gt;&gt; Going to prison. &gt;&gt; But that gift that was in his life, gifts and callings are without repentance. &gt;&gt; There's no pretending about those. They just manifest. They just happen. You are who you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; While he was in prison, God's blessing followed him. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that he was again, wasn't he? Again, wrongly accused. Thrown in prison for something he didn't do, &gt;&gt; wrongly accused &gt;&gt; while he was there. The butler and the baker, the mischievous one. Someone did something wrong. And Pharaoh said, "I've had enough of it. Someone's going to pay." And both of them were in prison. And we know that they both spoke to Joseph. He found out about why they were there. Joseph was actually in another position in the prison. He wasn't just a prisoner slave in the prison because of God's blessing. They recognized it and he was exalted &gt;&gt; in the prison. &gt;&gt; The prisoner actually got exalted to leadership in the prison. &gt;&gt; It's amazing to think about &gt;&gt; God's blessing. He knows exactly how to encourage us, right? Exactly when to do it as well. But while he's there and and he's in this position, what happens is these two characters get thrown in with him and and they have they have this concern and they bring it to him [snorts] and he says, "Hey, I'll ask the Lord about it. He has a dream and he gets the answer, doesn't he?" [snorts] &gt;&gt; One of them is going to have their head hung high and the other one is actually going to bear the cup again to Pharaoh. And we know the baker is the one that was the guy that uh he was wrong in the situation. And he told him, your head's coming off in three days. Sorry about your luck. That's what's going to happen. And and the other one, the cup bearer, you're going to be back beside Pharaoh. And when you go there, don't forget about me. &gt;&gt; Please remember me. &gt;&gt; And we know it came to pass exactly as he said. But it wasn't right away. &gt;&gt; Years later, &gt;&gt; God's blessing in his life. &gt;&gt; Many times I think that we as believers in the day in which we live need to look back to these stories and recognize when God does something, it is not a simple text message and an immediate response. It's not just a voicemail. It's not just an email. It's not God's program. God's program is to wait upon the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To wait upon the Lord. He will renew our strength. He'll bring the answer. It will come exactly in his time. And when it does, brothers and sisters, it's perfect. &gt;&gt; It's exactly the way it needs to be, isn't it? &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; But for Joseph in his story here, he is in prison in God's blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. interprets these dreams. The cup bearer goes back. The baker goes to the grave and there's Joseph still thinking, "My, am I in God's blessing?" But, you know, he probably still read his Bible and still praised the Lord. &gt;&gt; Said, "Blessed be the name of the Lord. I still have strength. I still have health. I still believe. &gt;&gt; I know who my daddy is. &gt;&gt; I know whom I have believed." and that he is able. &gt;&gt; My [snorts] &gt;&gt; he goes and he actually just continues on living his life in prison just doing the best he can doing everything as unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not unto Pharaoh, not unto anyone else because he wasn't serving them. He was serving the living God &gt;&gt; because that's how he was raised. And in doing so, there came a day where the cup bearer said, "Oh, Pharaoh had a dream. He dreamt about the kind cows, seven fat and seven lean. He couldn't understand the dream. Pharaoh was troubled. He was perplexed by it." And what did he do? He pondered it. But the cup bearer said, "Hey, I might have a solution. I might know someone. Something's come back to my remembrance. And we know it was years later this dream happened. This dream wasn't just an accident. There's no coincidence. &gt;&gt; This dream was God bringing to pass his plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we know the story from there. We know Joseph was brought out. He was given the opportunity and he interpreted the dream and he told him you got seven good years and you got seven lean years coming and if we prepare properly for those seven lean years in the seven good years there will be life. There will be sustenance in the land. And we know that Pharaoh said, "Who can we get to do something like this? We're going to need someone who's really sharp in wisdom and able to discern the things that need to be discerned. someone who has maybe the spirit of God upon him. Oh, wait a second. How about you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your big idea. How about you execute it? Because I believe that that is the interpretation of the dream. &gt;&gt; And we know that Joseph went right to the right hand of Pharaoh. And so much that nothing happened, nothing moved in the land of Egypt if Pharaoh went if if Joseph went by. I mean, &gt;&gt; it's just such a beautiful story. Joseph, the one in our scripture today, saying, "Father, don't cross your hands." And the father wittingly said to him, "Hey, this is not my choice. This is God's choice. &gt;&gt; The elder is going to serve the younger." Now, we could stop right there and say, "The elder are the Jews and the younger are the Gentile." That's right. &gt;&gt; But there's so much more. There's so much more to talk about there. I think it's beautiful. We know that in this story that we're talking about in Joseph that it goes further. It's just such a magnificent story, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Because even once he rose to the right hand of Pharaoh and he got to the place where he was in his position, I can only imagine that he wondered if one day he could see his daddy again. if one day that his daddy potentially could see his children again, if his brothers still lived. And we know that when the seven years of of fatness in the land happened, they gathered the grain and and he executed everything, took the taxes and the tithes and everything and built up the storehouses. Everything was in order. The seven years of famine hit. And we know there was food in Egypt, but there wasn't food everywhere else, &gt;&gt; right? It was it was a dark in the land. It was really really thin. And we know that the children of Israel were starting to starve. But they weren't just children. They were adults. And they were with their dad. And and they're like, "We're going to die. This isn't good. We need to do something about this." And someone says, "Hey, I think I heard that down in Egypt they've got food still. There's grain there. Maybe we could go and get some." Dad says, "Okay, go." They go there. We know the story so well. They come in. Joseph now, the one that they persecuted, &gt;&gt; the one that they mistreated, &gt;&gt; the one that they hated, &gt;&gt; all of those terrible things, that person now is seated on the throne, &gt;&gt; and they get to come in and start having conversations with him. And to think about how he could have executed judgment from the very first moment that he saw them. And to some extent he did. We know that he grabbed them, nabbed them, and said, "You're spies." I'm just going to gloss over. I'm not going to dig in too far because I want to talk about other stuff, but he did. He said, "You're spies. You're liars." And they were. They weren't necessarily spies, but they were liars. And he said, "You're going into prison, and you know what? I'm going to deal with you the way that I want to deal with you." They didn't know that he could actually understand their language. He was listening to him talk. But he was smart. &gt;&gt; He wasn't he wasn't a fool like they made him out to be. But in his situation where I want to get to, even though he was in that position where anything that he said would go. And we know the story shows that he fooled with them a little bit. He sent them on their way and and he sent them back home and said, "Don't worry about it." and put their gold back in their bags with some grain and and uh the proender and sent them back home with the grain. And we know that when they got back home, they they saw the the gold in their bags and their dad said, "What's this? What are you doing? How did you get this grain?" And they said, "We don't even know." And we know they went back for more. They They ran out of that grain. They went back for more. Joseph knew they'd come back. He only gave him enough for so long. He was pretty pretty wise in his ways. And when they came back, he said, "Listen, you can actually get some more grain, but I want my younger brother here." He didn't tell them that he knew he had a younger brother. He said, "Have you got another brother?" And and we know that they went home and told their dad that I was on the first visit and their dad said, "Why would you say that? I actually have lost one son from my wife that I loved. Now you're going to give away my other son. Are you crazy? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the turmoil in their house? &gt;&gt; But they said, "Hey, if we want to live, we have to do this. We've got to take Benjamin." So they take Benjamin. And I think it's just beautiful. The way the Lord does things is so magnificent. Hey, &gt;&gt; in the end, we know the story. They all go there and he reveals himself. He treats them well. He doesn't actually mistreat his brethren when he had humanly speaking every reason to &gt;&gt; and maybe in some levels spiritually speaking every reason to. &gt;&gt; But we know that this guy was a type of Christ &gt;&gt; because what did he do? He prepared a banquet feast for his brethren. &gt;&gt; And then he kicked everyone out and he revealed himself to his brethren. And we know the cry went forth that was loud. He wept aloud as he revealed himself to his brethren. I think it's just magnificent this story to think about. These people were blinded for the Gentiles sake. &gt;&gt; Just by grace, &gt;&gt; just by the grace of election as we read this morning. Yes. &gt;&gt; The only reason we hear the message of the hour, that we have the ability to hear the message of the hour, isn't because grandpa or grandma or mom or dad just gave us the tapes and said, "Here, listen. It's because we were elected in God before the foundation of the world to have an ear to hear what the spirit says to the church in the age in which we live." &gt;&gt; And it doesn't puff us up and make us something. It makes us recognize how insignificant we truly are because it's only by the grace of God. [crying] &gt;&gt; Let's turn over to second Corinthians. Why? Why are they blind? What's our first question here? Why are the eyes of Israel closed? Why are the Jews still following the Old Testament? Sorry, we want more than just 2 Corinthians. We want 2 Corinthians 3. 2 Corinthians three. My let's start reading with verse 11. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remainth is glorious. &gt;&gt; I know we could say amen to that. That is &gt;&gt; wonderful. Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech, and not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished. But their minds were blinded. For until this day remainth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament, which veil is done away in Christ. &gt;&gt; This scripture, I think it's so beautiful because we had a prophet say this. This day, this scripture is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Ever since this started, this day, this scripture has been fulfilled. But we can see this. They say they see Jesus as a prophet. And that's it. A prophet. We see Jesus as the prophet. &gt;&gt; Jesus as Messiah. Jesus as God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 14, but their minds were blinded. For until this day remainth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament, which veil is done away in Christ. But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. So we can try to convert Jews all we want. when they are elected Jews, the veil is upon their heart. &gt;&gt; And there's nothing that we can say to change that. &gt;&gt; But you know, brothers and sisters, one of these days, soon and very, very soon, &gt;&gt; they are going to meet the king &gt;&gt; because just as Joseph revealed himself to his brethren, we're just on the very edge of it, taking place in the land of Israel. Now, the spirit of God is lifting off of the gentile church. We know, brother Brandham says it in questions and answers. That's the reason why we can't pray the way that we would like to. The revival is over. &gt;&gt; The great revival is over. The calling of all of the gentile church. Now, it is the gleaning in the field. &gt;&gt; Now, it is the the ripening of the grain. Brother Brandham said, "I can hear the combine coming. Let's get ready." But here we have the children of Israel. Their minds are thoroughly blinded. And the more you preach to them this word, the more they're blind. &gt;&gt; But at the time appointed of the father, which is very, very soon, &gt;&gt; their eyes are going to be open. &gt;&gt; Just like we've been talking about eyes being closed, eyes being open, being able to perceive, being able to have the perception. It's only by the grace of God that we're able to have the perception. &gt;&gt; But here we have the children of Israel, the Jews, their minds are blinded. Not their eyes, their minds. &gt;&gt; And they believe the book of Moses. They believe, some of them are so very staunch, they might even put some message believers to shame by how incredibly devout they are to what they believe. I find it really fascinating to watch Israel. Brother Bradom said it. If you want to know what time it is, that's God's time piece. &gt;&gt; Look at the children of Israel. And and you know, brothers and sisters, if we look at the children of Israel as a whole, if we just zoom out, maybe go out into outer space a long ways and just look at that little blue planet, you know, um if we just have that kind of a perspective and think about how come right now is there such a resurgence of persecution for the Jews. Brother Brandham talked about Israel being in her homeland, you know, on the wings of eagles, the return of the of the Jews back to their their homeland for the settlement. They recognize that the blessing is in the land. There's been call after call after call for the Jews to go back home. But why is there such a savage persecution to people who are Jews in this world? I think it's amazing because the devil knows his time is exceptionally exceedingly short. &gt;&gt; Exceptionally short. Because when the bride goes home, he's got three and a half years to accomplish everything that he's ever going to do. Then he's going to be plucked up and thrown in the lake of fire. Can you imagine that? He's been around for how many years? How many years before human beings the devil has been around? And he's come to the place now where he when the bride goes home, three and one half years he has left to do any business that he's ever gonna do. &gt;&gt; And then he's going to be punished. And I know some are saying, well, there's the thousand years. He's going to have a thousand years and he will have a thousand years, but he's not going to be able to accomplish anything in those thousand of years because he's going to be bound by chains. And we know the prophet in our day said those chains are not logging chains. Anybody ever seen logging chains? Chains maybe like you would have on a ship for an anchor. Big humongous links. Something really strong and robust, heavy iron chains to bind that guy up and hold him on the side of the pit. No, it's not going to be that at all. It's going to be chains of circumstance because the bride is going to have a brand new body. She's not going to be subject to all of the pressures and and and sinful nature that she had to contend with in the past. He's going to be bound for a thousand years by chains of circumstance. &gt;&gt; He's not going to have any effect on her. Can you imagine what it will be like to live in this world, which we will for a thousand years without any effect of Satan? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Zero. He won't have any pressure on our lives because we will be exactly who we are supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Now, how does that thousand years fit into the three and a half years? I don't know. I don't think that we can actually explain that because we're talking about a supernatural time frame, an eternal time frame, and and a time, a space and time. And I believe they run consecutively myself. how you actually fit the two together as a puzzle, that's up to God. I don't think it's up to us to be able to explain it down to the minute. But, you know, if we were to take a look at it, I think it's an interesting study. If you look at a day in the sight of God is as a thousand years, and a thousand years is as a day. The space in heaven, the the scripture that we love, how there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour. How many people know how long that is? If we're talking about years, human years on Earth here, it's 21 and a half years. Just about 22 years if you break it down and and just go with that formula. It's really interesting to think about. But we're not talking about time and space the way that we think about it. And and it's so important to remember that because our theophony bodies aren't coming back to this time and space, are they? We're never going to actually have incorruption inherit corruption. &gt;&gt; And corruption is never going to inherit incorruption. Those two are not going to mix. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But somehow Satan's going to be in the midst of it. He's going to be bound. I think it's such a beautiful thing. He will have no power over us. And you know, I believe it with all my heart too, brothers and sisters, that even now as we go forwards, we're coming to the place where he has no power over us because we know that brother Bradam said it, God said it through his prophet, that when the bride recognizes what it is, when the church recognizes what it is, and and the bride I I would say when the church recognizes that it's the wife, then the rapture will go. When we recognize that we're the wife, the rapture will go. I'll say it that way and I'm not going to add to it or take away from it. I'm just trying to illustrate when we go from just maybe being in church and having a church experience to actually having that intimacy, the one-on-one where it's no longer me plus God where we are one. I think it changes everything. &gt;&gt; But these guys were blinded for until this day remainth the same veil untaken away. &gt;&gt; Amen. in the reading of the Old Testament, which veil is done away in Christ. But even unto this day, when Moses is read, we know that's the first few books of the Bible, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. &gt;&gt; It's such a beautiful thing. We know there's coming a day where they're going to say to him, "We really appreciate you and and the way you speak and the way you you relate to scriptures and everything about you is just captivating us. What is it about you? And where did you get those scars?" &gt;&gt; And he's going to say to them, "In the house of my friends." And we know that that veil is going to be pulled away and there's going to be a cry because a nation is going to be converted right now in a day. A whole nation. And it's amazing because we look at it. We're not seeing the the rapture of the church of the living God converted in a in a day. &gt;&gt; The gentile church is converted as individuals. &gt;&gt; He deals with the Jews as a nation. Verse 16. Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now, the Lord is that spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. &gt;&gt; And my Bible, the footnote says freedom. freedom makes me think of the the time where brother Brandham talks about the declaration of emancipation in the United States of America and how terrible life was because slavery was an option. &gt;&gt; But we know the government actually changed it. And we know they didn't change it because they wanted to change it. They changed it because God wanted it changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no government that operates unless God says so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that every government is controlled by Satan. &gt;&gt; But Satan is only a tool in the hand of God. &gt;&gt; He's only going to do whatever God wants. &gt;&gt; It's such an amazing thing to think about. But when that day was declared, tomorrow there will be no more slavery in this country. Brother Brandham, he does the the description. He he he theatricizes it. I I don't know how you say that, but he he he he explains it in such a way that there would have been people climbing to the clamoring to the top of hills. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; When that sun rises tomorrow, slavery is abolished in this land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the sunshine of Jubilee. &gt;&gt; Yes. There would have been people scrambling to the tops of the highest point they could find, looking for that first ray of the sunrise to be able to say, "I'm free. &gt;&gt; I'm free. &gt;&gt; My children are going to be free." We are no longer slaves. &gt;&gt; And we know that it's just like Brother Brandham talks about as well, the the story about being a slave. In the land of Israel, every 50 years was the year of Jubilee. They'd blow the trumpet and you could go free. any debts you owed, any any problems you had, any mortgages, anything that you had to deal with. If you were a slave, if you didn't pay your bills and your wife and your children got sold into slavery, everyone could go free at that 50th year. When the trumpets blew at whatever time it was, you could go free. You could lay down your shovel and your hoe. You could stop serving. You could take off your apron. You could walk out of the kitchen a free human. and you could walk right back into your land and everything that you once owned became yours again. &gt;&gt; The year of Jubilee. And brother Batam, he says it, it's out of the Bible. The people that didn't want to actually go free, they said they would take them to the temple and they would bore a hole in their ear &gt;&gt; and they would remain a slave forever after that point. the jubilation, the Jubilee trumpet would never have power over them ever again because they chose slavery over freedom. &gt;&gt; And brother Bradom takes that and he actually spiritualizes it and says the same thing with the word of God in the day in which you live. If you choose to hold on to a tradition, if you choose to hold on to some other teaching and try and make a hybrid religion of this message, There'll come a time where your spiritual ear will get a whole bored in it &gt;&gt; and you will no longer be able to hear about liberty. &gt;&gt; It will simply be religion. &gt;&gt; And I want to encourage each one of us, never let ourselves get to that point. &gt;&gt; We need to make sure that we're able to hear that there is liberty where the spirit of the Lord is. If we want to dance and shout, this is the place to do it. &gt;&gt; If we want to scream and yell, this is the place to do it. If we want to worship God, there's going to be no better venue on this side of eternity, brothers and sisters. And I know some people will say, "Well, you don't know what my church was like where I come from. Who cares?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're here now. &gt;&gt; So, what about now? What about today? Today is the Jubilee trumpet. &gt;&gt; Now, the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. &gt;&gt; And you know, either there is liberty or there isn't liberty. And I want to encourage us to look at it that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because some might say, "Well, I've only got a little bit of liberty. I can only have this much liberty." And some people have other liberty. You know what? There's no culture in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And I think we do a real disservice to what we believe when we say that my culture has preeminence over the spirit of God in me. &gt;&gt; As soon as we do that, I believe we take away the power of the Holy Ghost in our lives. &gt;&gt; And you know what? In fact, I don't think we take away the power. I think we just push it aside. &gt;&gt; And as long as we do that, then there isn't going to be liberty. there's going to be bondage because it either is or it isn't. The spirit of God either is that spirit where the spirit of the Lord is. There is liberty, there is freedom, &gt;&gt; or there isn't. And I know it's not for everyone. &gt;&gt; In every church, there's three types of believers, Brother Brandham said. And that's just the way it is. &gt;&gt; We can't make anyone anything. I would say this, the spirit of the Lord demonstrates The next verse 18 it says, "But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I would say this because my my Bible says it in a glass in a mirror. But we all with open face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord. Wait a second. How does that work? &gt;&gt; You mean to say that we can actually look in a mirror &gt;&gt; and what do we see? &gt;&gt; We see the glory of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But you know that's where there's liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where there's bondage, we don't see the glory of the Lord. We see this veil. &gt;&gt; We're stuck looking at the veil. But what we're trying to say today is the gentile church does not have that blindness. &gt;&gt; We have the glorious liberty of that veil being taken off of us. &gt;&gt; You know where this veil discussion started was with Moses when he went up on the mountain, isn't it? &gt;&gt; He went up on the mountain the first time. Remember he did it twice. &gt;&gt; God called him up and he went up the first time and told everyone just wait here until I come back. just wait. I mean, no, there was no text messages. There was no emails, there was no fax machines, there was no none of that. Take my words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay here and wait until I return. &gt;&gt; But we know that he went up on the mountain and and he said that he he truly feared and and he was afraid of it, but he went cuz God called him. But while he was up there, what happened? God tried talking to him and then he said, "You know what? Get back down there to those people. Those people are just out of it. The rebellious people and they're misbehaving." And we went we Moses, he went back down off the mountain and what did he find? Lentious party. &gt;&gt; They're going crazy. And and what did they say? Everyone quick. Moses must be lost. He's gone because he didn't come in the time that we thought he should come. &gt;&gt; So, we better take matters into our own hands then &gt;&gt; because God, you know, he's just maybe not doing it the way that we think he should. It's not as fast as we think it should be. So, we better do something about it. What they say, everyone off with your golden earrings that we got from the the Egyptians. Let's make a pile of gold. And what we'll do is, hey, let's make some golden calves. That was a comfortable place to worship, wasn't it? Back in the land of Egypt, we love to worship those calves. We had such wonderful times, tremendous services. &gt;&gt; So, let's make some golden calves. Won't it be fun? Isn't that what they did? &gt;&gt; And you know what shocks me with that story is that it wasn't just the children of Israel on mass and maybe some random leaders. Aaron, &gt;&gt; Aaron was right in there. &gt;&gt; Yes. saying, "Wow, I think that sounds good." You know, brothers and sisters, if we think that we can exist in this world according to the word of God for the day in which we live without the voice of a vindicated prophet, we are so sadly mistaken. &gt;&gt; We will be exactly like the children of Israel, thinking that we're worshiping God. And we're not going to be worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; But we don't have that veil. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; I just love how the Lord does things. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But we all with open face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord. Because that's what we see when we recognize there's liberty in this word, in the word for our day, the message of the hour, the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. coming back to the center of the road. That's what the prophet was sent for. We know that. But when we do that, when we follow the instructions given to us in the day in which we live, we all with open face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are changed into the same image from glory to glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even as by the spirit of the Lord &gt;&gt; because the Lord is that spirit. And where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty. Brothers and sisters, we don't have to look at this old flesh. Don't look at the old man. Don't look at the old woman. Don't look at the old brother. Don't look at the old sister. &gt;&gt; Don't look at the old man. The the old man has to die. &gt;&gt; The word says to know no man after the flesh, doesn't it? Amen. &gt;&gt; When we can look when we can look into the glass and see the glory of the Lord, I think that's just so tremendous. And we know we can say that that glass is actually the word of God. &gt;&gt; We ought to see ourselves reflecting back out of there. Better yet, see him reflecting back out of there. &gt;&gt; But to be able to recognize that's his program. That's what he wants. He wants us to be able to look open face &gt;&gt; as in a glass. The glory of the Lord. Why? &gt;&gt; Remember, our character isn't going to be changed because of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Our character is getting changed right now. &gt;&gt; Right here and right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Death isn't going to change who we are. Death is only going to change our dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where we're living. That's all that's going to happen. And we know that rich young ruler found that out. Maybe he thought one day, well, I'll take my chances with all of my investments. Like we talked about in the young peoples. I'm just going to take my chance with all of my investments. Everything that I've got, I did it godly. Everything is going to be fine. I'm going to take my chances. We know that he lifted up his eyes in hell. And we talked about it on Friday. We just sort of built on what brother Emanuel was talking about. I think it's such a powerful powerful illustration. Even in that position, he said, "Just go do." He was trying to bark orders and and he said to Abraham, you know, if I can't go back and help them, if you're not going to go back and help them, can you just send someone send send someone to go and tell my brothers? &gt;&gt; And he said, you know what? If they won't hear a prophet, they're not going to listen to a dead man. &gt;&gt; That's a stubborn human nature, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Humans are stubborn inherently. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know the word says that they're stiff necked and uncircumcised &gt;&gt; of heart and mind. &gt;&gt; Some people might say, "Well, I could fit that description." You know what? It's not about the natural body. &gt;&gt; It's about the heart and the mind. &gt;&gt; Is our heart right? Are we willing to say, "Circumcise my heart, Lord. &gt;&gt; Take out all of me and fill me with you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of an exposition of the seven church ages, brother Brandham, he says this here. For it is written, and I don't know if I sent this. If I didn't, forgive me. For it is written, cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree. It's out of the revelation of Jesus Christ. Cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree. that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith. &gt;&gt; The blessing of Abraham came through the cross to the Gentiles. The Jews rejected the cross. Therefore, Jesus got the gentile bride. The Jews full-on rejected the cross. Now, we're going to talk a little bit about that as we go forwards. Why were they blinded? Why were they blinded? We know we have to always go back to the original prophecy and we read that this morning out of Genesis chapter 48, I believe it was. There was a prophecy that went forward and that prophecy is still in force today until this gentile bride is taken out of the way. That prophecy is still in force until he goes back and reveals himself to the Jews, the 144 Jews. That prophecy is still, we can't stop prophecy. It's going to happen. But why are the eyes of Israel closed? The easy answer is they chose a murderer instead of a messiah. Why did they do that? Here's the tricky part, brothers and sisters. Because he didn't come the way that he thought that they should. They thought he should. &gt;&gt; He came the way the word said he would. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; The whole world has the pictures painted that there's going to be this great cataclysmic thing when the Lord comes the second time to take his bride home. &gt;&gt; He's no different. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's no different. He's going to come exactly according to the word. And I'll say this, he did. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He did come exactly according to the word. Some people can see it and some people can't. Many people can't. That's not up to us. &gt;&gt; Alls we can do is just press on and say, "Hey, something happened in 1963." &gt;&gt; And it was a lot more than just the the cloud that we see in the picture that maybe we have pins about. It was way more than even just the opening of the seals according to the word, the revealing of the word. &gt;&gt; It was way more than that because it took way more than just those actions, those things that we can perceive naturally It took something way more &gt;&gt; for all of that to happen &gt;&gt; because a man couldn't open the seals. &gt;&gt; We know the story. We can go back there and talk about Revelations chapter 3 and two and three and the instruction to the churches and how they're told, you know, he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church. And I know every single church age was given a promise. They were given a a a correction. What I see wrong with you. and they were given the promise the the the the thing that they the promise for their age. But then when you get to Revelation chapter 4, John being a type of the bride, he saw a door open in heaven. &gt;&gt; We know that he was already in the spirit in the Lord's day when all this happened. But what happened? He heard a voice say, "Come higher, John." &gt;&gt; And we know that's what happened. He went higher. Immediately I was in the spirit and and and I saw one, not two or three seated on the throne. I saw one. We know the story, right? &gt;&gt; We got a glimpse into that in the age in which we live. We got a glimpse into that through this prophetic utterance in the day in which we live. This seventh angel messenger wasn't John, wasn't Jesus, wasn't God. It was a prophet of God that introduced us to the revealing of God. Because we know that while he stood there and went through the first and second pulls of his ministry, he was able to declare this is the appearing. &gt;&gt; This is the appearing. The appearing of what? I think it's an interesting discussion. What's it the appearing of? I'll say the the word coming of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we know that when Abraham and Sarah were on the plains of Mamry, they were there doing their thing, believing. And we know we talked about them on Wednesday and uh how there was a promise and they were holding fast to that promise. At least Abraham was. Sarah was kind of unsure about it, but there was three that came to their tent that day. And we know that Abraham recognized one, &gt;&gt; right? And who was that one? &gt;&gt; It was Elohim. &gt;&gt; That's who he recognized. &gt;&gt; And that promise came to him that day. &gt;&gt; God himself brought that promise. He didn't send a messenger. He sent the messengers down to Sodom, didn't he? &gt;&gt; And we know that one who was the prophet in our day. He said, "There's messengers down to Sodom in our day. Two angelic messengers. powerful ministries. And what did those angels do in Sodom? They actually preached the word &gt;&gt; and it preached them blind. &gt;&gt; Same thing in our day. &gt;&gt; Oral Roberts, Billy Graham, &gt;&gt; both of them having tremendous ministries. And I had the the the luxury, the blessing of actually going to the the Billy Graham Museum Library it's called in in Charlotte, North Carolina. It's a tremendous monument to this I'll say angel minister down to Sodom. If you see the way that thing is set up and what the people have done through it, it's magnificent. And if you think about what they did with William Mary and Brham and so on and so forth, I I [clears throat] think it's magnificent &gt;&gt; because they never exalted the man. &gt;&gt; They exalted the word. &gt;&gt; They did exactly what God wanted &gt;&gt; to make sure that it was put in a position where nobody in this age will have an excuse. &gt;&gt; Everybody has access to the message if they want it, if they hear about it. &gt;&gt; Nobody. It's not exclusive to anybody. But yeah, why are the eyes of the children of Israel closed? Is because they chose a murderer instead. A murderer instead of a savior. My I believe it's out of Mark chapter 15. Let's turn over there. Mark chapter 15. We'll just read it today. I think it's really important to see the scriptural identification when there's a question like this. Why something is the way it is? Remember um our question is why are they blinded? Why are the eyes of Israel closed? Verse 15, actually chapter 15, sorry, chapter 15, verse one. And straightway in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes. And the whole council and bound Jesus and carried him away and delivered him to Pilate. Pilate asked him, "Art thou the king of the Jews?" And he answering said unto him, "Thou sayest it." You got it. &gt;&gt; And the chief priests accused him of many things, but he answered nothing. And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing. Behold, how many things they witness against thee. Now I think when we read this we have to remember that Pilate was really really uneasy in this moment &gt;&gt; because his wife the closest one to him came and told him don't do anything with this guy &gt;&gt; he's an innocent man leave him alone &gt;&gt; Pilate is not going to have excuse on that day &gt;&gt; verse five &gt;&gt; but Jesus an yet answered nothing so that Pilate marveled Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner whomsoever they desired. It's interesting to see how this whole story plays out because they desired someone. They they chose someone. Verse seven. And there was one named Barabus, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. And the multitude crying aloud, began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. But Pilate answered them, saying, "Will ye that I release unto you the king of the Jews?" For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; But the chief priests moved the people that if he should rather release Barabus unto them. And Pilate answered and said unto them again, "What will ye then that I shall do unto him who ye call the king of the Jews?" Now, he was really working them hard when he was saying this because they didn't call him the king of the Jews. &gt;&gt; But he called him the king of the Jews to them because he knew they didn't like it. &gt;&gt; But he recognized who he was. And they cried out again, "Crucify him!" Then Pilate said unto them, "What what evil hath he done?" And they cried out, "The more exceedingly, crucify him." And so Pilate willing to con contend with the people released Barabus unto them and delivered Jesus when he had scourged him to be crucified. And the soldiers led him away into the hall called Ptorium. And they called together the whole band. And they clothed with him purple and plated a crown of thorns and put it about his head. And we know the rest of the story. For time's sake, I'm not going to read it, but we know they took him and crucified him after they completely mistreated him. &gt;&gt; Right? And the children of Israel, the Jews, in that moment while they were crying out, they said it in one of the other gospels, "Let his blood be upon us and our children." &gt;&gt; Could you imagine that as a parent? &gt;&gt; I can't imagine that as a parent to have anybody here that would say, "Let anybody's blood be upon me and my children. &gt;&gt; My children don't have anything to do with it. Help us. But yet that's the way they were. &gt;&gt; That's how blinded they were. &gt;&gt; These people weren't becoming blind. They already were blind. &gt;&gt; And remember that same spirit that found its way at the base of the cross and said, "You just come down off there and then we'll believe you that you're that prophet. &gt;&gt; Do us a sign. Show us a work." Right? Those spirits are still alive. Brother Brandham, he talked about it. That man saying, wasn't it best might be blind. &gt;&gt; Do work for me. &gt;&gt; And he said, "How can I do that when you already are?" &gt;&gt; We're not talking about natural eyesight here. &gt;&gt; But that's the way the devil works. He likes to get us all caught up in the natural things, right? You know, there's a another scripture I'd like to read, and I can see that we're running out of time here, but that's okay. We'll just continue on with this. Let's turn over to Matthew 27. Why are they blinded? Why can't they see? You'll notice today that I'm not taking a lot of quotes. Brother Bradom has a lot to say about it, but I'm taking the Bible. I just want to bring it from the Bible first. Let's talk about what the word says about this. Matthew chapter 27. We can read it from there too. When the morning was come, all the chief priests and the elders and the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. When they had bound him, they led him away and delivered him under Pontius Pilate the governor. Then Judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented. Can you imagine that? The son of predition repented. He repented himself and brought again the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders saying, "I have sinned and that I have betrayed the innocent blood." And they said, "What is that to us? See thou to that. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself. The chief priest took the silver pieces and said, "It's not lawful for to put them in the treasury because it is the price of blood." And they took counsel and with them and bought with them the potter's field to bury strangers in. I can see we're going to wind up ending right here at this point. Verse 8 says, "Wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day." Verse 9 says, "Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, and they took the 30 pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value, and gave them for the potter's field as the Lord appointed me." And you know that potter's field for those people who have gone to the land of Israel they know that that's actually a place even today that potter's field is a place that you can visit. And every single place I believe I understand I've never been but one day Lord willing would love to go. I understand that every single place where there is reference in the Bible they have erected a a church and in this case it's a monastery and it's a keelma monastery in Jerusalem is the field of blood where he cast the silver where where they bought the actual land. This is actually where it took place and and I I just looked into this a little bit. I thought it was so interesting. I I just find this fascinating to think that someone can actually be blinded while the other one can actually see it. &gt;&gt; How we can actually see spiritual things and and some others they can't. They just can't see anything spiritual. It's all natural. &gt;&gt; And how it can become so confusing between one and the other as a believer in our lives. And that's why brothers and sisters, we're not waging, we're not in a war that's being waged against this flesh and blood. But that's how the devil does it. He likes to get us mixed up thinking, "Well, it's natural. Well, it's spiritual." Remember, the word says that we're not wrestling against flesh and blood. It's principalities and powers and rulers over darkness and spiritual wickedness and high places. &gt;&gt; I better call the musicians or I'm going to keep going. I'm about halfway through the notes that I have today. That's why I I just want to maybe be mindful. But in Jeremiah chapter 32, if you if you think about the story of Jeremiah and how in those days he was a prophet, when did he become a prophet? From his mother's womb. He didn't just become anointed one day to become a prophet. Prophets come from the mother's womb. &gt;&gt; And this man Jeremiah, he was told, "You're not going to have a family. You're not going to have a wife. You're not going to do anything that you think you're going to do in your life. You're going to follow me. And you're going to speak the words that I put in your mouth." And that's exactly what's going to happen with you, Jeremiah. Can you imagine that? That life would be just so difficult to get past. But I think if you are in that position, it's probably going to be easy, easier. Anyways, I would never say that the life of Jeremiah was easy. He was he he he was in a really rough spot. But in the midst of all of that he was doing, the the prophetic utterance that God brought through this man Jeremiah to the people of Israel, if you don't repent, God is not going to come and destroy you. The armies of the king of the north are coming down as a sething pot. And they will absolutely destroy you. They won't have pity on mama, on grandma, on grandpa, on babies, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters. Nobody will be spared if you don't listen to this prophetic utterance. And what did they do? They said, "No, we like our religion better. We like our our behavior. We like that we just have a little bit of liberty and not much liberty. We just like it the way it is. We don't want to change things. They didn't want to listen to what Jeremiah had to say because they thought that it was just Jeremiah. They didn't realize that it was actually God through him. &gt;&gt; But even in the midst of all of that, while he was being mistreated, he was being led by God to bring the prophecy. And we know the king of of the north, Nebuchadnezzar, had already come down and had the city under siege. Those prophetic words were coming to pass and they still had so much pride in their lives. They couldn't let go. And he said to them, "If you would just just go and surrender yourself now, you would live. You'll be a slave for the rest of your life, but you'll at least live." Couldn't do it. No way. They had way too much pride. And I think about it because it wasn't necessarily the people of the city either. It was the leadership that did that. The leadership forced the people into those positions. &gt;&gt; The city being under siege where they would eat one another's children because there was no more food. What a terrible place to be if they would just have listened to the vindicated prophet in their day, the voice of the prophet, the prophetic utterance. But they couldn't do it. They were happy with the way things were. They chose that just like the children of Israel chose a murderer. &gt;&gt; Remember, we choose. And we know the word of God says to choose ye this day whom ye will serve. &gt;&gt; Every single day is a choice for us. &gt;&gt; We can choose to follow the word. &gt;&gt; We can choose to just repent from our ways and correct oursel and go. We're we're able to do it on our GPS when we just get a little bit off track. We can just hit recalibrate &gt;&gt; reccalibrate a and it will say calculating and it might take a minute or so and then we'll actually have our route planned out again. That's all we need to do in the day in which we live with this word is come to church, close our eyes, open our hearts and our our our voice and just say Lord let me recalibrate unto you. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Jeremiah 32:14, maybe stand with me as we close. It says in even in the midst of all of his trial, while they're under siege, we have this taking place, brothers and sisters. This is a very significant transaction that I'm going to read here. Jeremiah 32, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is opened, and put them in an put them in an earthn vessel, that they may continue many days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. To think about the scriptural connotation of [music] these words. For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land. In the midst of all of this, Jeremiah has a transaction conducted &gt;&gt; where money is exchanged for a piece of land, a very specific piece of land. Zechariah 11 verse 12. And I said unto them, if you think good, give me my price, and if not, for bear. So they weighed for my price. What? 30 pieces of silver. Zachchariah. 30 pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me, cast it into the potter. a goodly price that I was priced at of them. And I took the 30 pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord. Why are the Jews blinded? They're blinded for our sake. &gt;&gt; They're blinded because of prophecy. Because of prophecy for our sake. so that we would have the spirit of the Lord turn from the Jews through the prophet age messenger, the Ephesian church age messenger, Paul, so that he could set the example for all future church ages in the Gentile church. Remember when we talk about the church ages, they're not to the Jews. &gt;&gt; They're all to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Every single church age. But there will be a turning any day now back to the Jews. And it just behooves us to recognize that we have been given a liberty that's beyond even what we understand because it's prophecy. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for your word. We thank you, Lord, that we could gather together in your name, Lord, that we could hear a question that was asked in the heart of one of your children, Lord, to to wonder why the Jews are blinded. Father, we know that we could say it's because they chose a murderer over the Messiah, over you, Lord. But they did that because there was a prophecy that was still in force. And Father, we know that that prophecy even today is still in force. And that prophecy was there so that we could be the one, the recipient, the younger one. Oh, Father, when the hands were crossed back in Egypt, it was for me. &gt;&gt; Father, I thank you for your word. Thank you for the prophecy, Lord. Thank you for the revelation in the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; Thank you that the eyes of the Jews were blinded for our sake, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, they're not our enemies. They're our brothers. &gt;&gt; And Father, we just want to pray for those families who were hurting today, that were attacked in Australia. What a terrible thing, Father. For all those people in the land of Israel that wonder, is there a Messiah? Oh, Father, help us, Lord, not to misplace our trust in this message of the hour. Help us not to be careless and reckless, Father, with this great treasure that we've been given, oh Lord, to recognize that people's lives have seemingly been destroyed so that we can have this word. How great is salvation you've given us Lord. Father we love you today and we thank you for your grace. We thank you for your election, your predestination, your fornowledge. We thank you Lord Jesus that you have given us free will that we can surrender that to you every day of our lives that you could live through us Lord. Help us to recognize the the treasure the pearl of great price that you've given us Lord. And father, as we go forwards, we pray that you would keep your hand upon us. As we go our separate ways, be with those who couldn't come today, wherever they are. We pray that you would just bless them abundantly as well, Father. And Lord, we just ask that if our eyes are blinded to this word today, that you would open them in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Father, that there wouldn't be one person here that would miss that great day when you decide to take your bride home. &gt;&gt; That every single one of us would be there. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we thank you. We just commit all that was spoken today into your hands for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
