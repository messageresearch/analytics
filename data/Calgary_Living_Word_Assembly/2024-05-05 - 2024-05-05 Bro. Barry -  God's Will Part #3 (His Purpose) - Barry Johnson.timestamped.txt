[47:41] amen I really do struggle with standing
[47:44] up here
[47:45] but sometimes things just grab a hold of
[47:47] me and I can't get free of it keeps me
[47:49] up at night I wake up in the
[47:51] morning for two weeks this thought's
[47:55] been on my heart in 10:30 last last
[47:57] night it manifests itself in the form of
[47:59] this poem but I want to read this simple
[48:02] little quote First that this little
[48:03] thought that started this whole process
[48:07] it said of the anointed ones at the end
[48:09] time brother paragraph
[48:11] 236 for the BR says why did Satan do
[48:14] that is because he didn't know the word
[48:17] for that he knew the word was for that
[48:20] hour but he doed this humble little man
[48:25] being that word
[48:27] we stand the same today Satan's always
[48:30] been astounded how God does things so
[48:34] this poem is called Kinesis or kosis and
[48:38] we know that's what brother bradam said
[48:39] when God pours himself into his
[48:43] church in the spiritual ballet of light
[48:47] and dark Where Angels Sing and demons
[48:52] Embark God in his grace veils himself in
[48:56] human race the mystery hidden the
[48:59] mystical spark the conflict between
[49:02] brightness and shadows
[49:04] unseen lies the truth simple and Serene
[49:09] God veiled in human guise a Wonder to
[49:13] the
[49:14] wise the mystery where Holiness meets
[49:18] this Earthly scene behind the curtain of
[49:21] Flesh and Bone the almighty King chooses
[49:25] to be known amen Satan in his pride is
[49:29] baffled denied as God's presence in man
[49:34] is shown a stumbling block for our
[49:37] adversaries might Fallen man walks with
[49:40] God gleaming
[49:42] bright Satan asserts doubts rain but
[49:46] God's love does sustain Amen in the
[49:49] hearts of Believers pure and
[49:52] right the serpent hoping doubt will
[49:55] arise by his Whisper of deceitful lies
[50:00] God's plan is very clear to those who
[50:03] draw near manifesting timely truth no
[50:07] longer
[50:08] disguised intense battle ensues day and
[50:12] night between darkness and the Eternal
[50:15] Light yet in our Soul's choice we find
[50:19] hope we find voice to manifest God's
[50:23] word burning bright let us declare this
[50:27] paradoxical mystery God's presence in
[50:31] Humanity's history for in these veils
[50:33] called flesh he
[50:36] dwells by our
[50:38] hearts our life story tells the
[50:41] testimony that brings him glory Lord
[50:44] bless you

[1:05:40] you have your Bibles I would like to
[1:05:42] just continue on in our
[1:05:47] study concerning God's
[1:05:50] will if we could turn to Second Timothy
[1:05:54] and then over to Romans chapter
[1:06:10] 8 I know there's a lot of scripture that
[1:06:13] we could certainly use pertaining to
[1:06:15] this but it's just the way I felt led
[1:06:18] second
[1:06:20] Timothy chapter
[1:06:23] 3 verse 11 and
[1:06:27] 12 speaking about God's will amen
[1:06:31] especially in our lives but taking a
[1:06:35] text from the Bible in Joseph's
[1:06:38] life persecutions verse 11 of chapter 3
[1:06:42] persecutions
[1:06:43] afflictions which came unto me at
[1:06:47] Antioch at laconium at leria what
[1:06:51] persecutions I
[1:06:53] endured but out of them all the Lord
[1:06:56] delivered me
[1:06:58] am yay and all that will live Godly in
[1:07:02] Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:07:06] persecution and over in Romans chapter
[1:07:16] 8 verse 28
[1:07:26] and we know that all things work
[1:07:27] together for
[1:07:31] good to them that love God to them are
[1:07:34] the called who are the called according
[1:07:37] to his purpose for whom he did for know
[1:07:41] he also did
[1:07:42] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:07:45] image of his son amen that he might be
[1:07:48] the first born among many
[1:07:51] Brethren now many people could say
[1:07:53] that's talking about Jesus and sure
[1:07:55] enough indeed it is but keep reading
[1:08:00] moreover whom he did he pre predestinate
[1:08:04] them he also called and whom he called
[1:08:08] them he also Justified amen and whom he
[1:08:12] justified them he also
[1:08:15] glorified what shall we say what shall
[1:08:19] we then say to these things if God be
[1:08:22] for us who can be against us
[1:08:26] amen let's just bow in prayer one more
[1:08:28] time Heavenly Father we thank you for
[1:08:31] your word we know that heavens and earth
[1:08:33] will pass away but your word will remain
[1:08:36] help us Lord Jesus to keep your word
[1:08:39] pure and true before our eyes Lord help
[1:08:43] us to keep our eyes focused solely on
[1:08:45] you Lord Jesus not to be looking to the
[1:08:47] right hand nor to the left we know that
[1:08:50] this is the day in which the devil wants
[1:08:52] to distract us father and Lord we just
[1:08:55] rebuke every devil that would try and
[1:08:57] come against your bride with
[1:09:00] distractions we just ask now that you
[1:09:02] would be with us as we go forwards now
[1:09:05] in your word in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:09:07] pray amen God bless you this morning you
[1:09:10] may be
[1:09:17] seated I trust your happy today amen
[1:09:21] certainly thankful to be in the house of
[1:09:24] the Lord once again
[1:09:26] just a couple of announcements we have
[1:09:28] the May 26th communion service at 5:30
[1:09:31] p.m. we have the Men's breakfast coming
[1:09:33] up May the 18th at 10:00 that's at our
[1:09:37] house there was a a few folks that had
[1:09:40] uh responded to the original um text
[1:09:43] that we sent out on WhatsApp but then I
[1:09:46] had a request from a brother who for
[1:09:48] some reason didn't get the original text
[1:09:52] to send it again so I did as a reminder
[1:09:54] and if you could just let us know if you
[1:09:56] plan to attend we just would like to
[1:09:58] make sure we have enough food and we're
[1:09:59] trying to determine whether we should
[1:10:01] host it in our house or down in the uh
[1:10:04] in the Hall of the barn so if you could
[1:10:07] just let us know that would be certainly
[1:10:09] uh appreciated we have brother Dela
[1:10:12] deladon he's coming June the 2nd he will
[1:10:15] take the Sunday morning service and we
[1:10:16] have brother Jack Duff coming as well
[1:10:18] and uh just I I guess it's as usual the
[1:10:23] schedule that we had for him has now
[1:10:24] shifted
[1:10:26] and uh he won't be here I think it was
[1:10:27] the 17th that we had said originally he
[1:10:29] will be here on Wednesday July the 12th
[1:10:32] and that's so that he can actually make
[1:10:34] it to Saskatoon Tabernacle for brother
[1:10:36] Dwayne fair so we want to try and uh
[1:10:39] just be accommodating to everyone and
[1:10:41] amen we'll see what the Lord will do
[1:10:45] so yeah that's all of that now we'll uh
[1:10:50] get into the word I just think it's so
[1:10:52] beautiful here amen yes this uh
[1:10:54] scripture that we read and that we know
[1:10:57] that we have so dear to us I think in uh
[1:11:00] you know the discussion that we talk
[1:11:02] about this this word of God and and how
[1:11:05] we know so many of the scriptures are
[1:11:07] near and dear to our hearts it's just
[1:11:09] important for us to remember that we
[1:11:11] need to remember the whole scripture and
[1:11:13] not just get focused on preaching or
[1:11:15] talking about just one part of a
[1:11:17] scripture and I think it's neat how
[1:11:19] brother brandham in the church age book
[1:11:22] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:11:23] he talks about um a verse maybe out of
[1:11:27] the Book of Revelation part A and Part B
[1:11:30] so the first half or the second half of
[1:11:32] a verse and uh we can actually begin to
[1:11:36] quote a verse in Scripture that is
[1:11:39] actually only half of a verse and forget
[1:11:42] the second half which is very applicable
[1:11:44] to the first half it's it's kind of uh
[1:11:47] synonymous one and the other and a good
[1:11:50] example of that is to just to uh resist
[1:11:53] the devil and he'll free he'll flee
[1:11:55] right many times we say that scripture
[1:11:57] I'll never forget brother Aaron mcir
[1:11:59] preaching on that one time and uh that
[1:12:01] brother is a very strong preacher and
[1:12:03] I'll tell you he he said you know we
[1:12:05] need to remember that there is a first
[1:12:07] part to that scripture we can just
[1:12:08] resist the devil all day long and he's
[1:12:10] not going to flee that's not going to
[1:12:12] happen but when we take the scripture
[1:12:14] and apply the scripture the way the
[1:12:15] scripture says to apply the scripture
[1:12:17] submit yourself
[1:12:19] therefore one to
[1:12:21] another then the devil will flee then
[1:12:24] resist the devil devil then he has to
[1:12:26] flee we we find ourselves trying to
[1:12:28] resist the devil and then we try and
[1:12:30] flee if we don't actually do that
[1:12:32] correctly and that's not the scripture
[1:12:33] we want to make sure that we just quote
[1:12:35] the scripture properly when we speak the
[1:12:38] words when we remember the scripture and
[1:12:39] we know that Romans chapter 8 vers verse
[1:12:42] 28 it says and we know that all things
[1:12:44] work together for good we can say that
[1:12:46] scripture all the time all things work
[1:12:48] together for the good and they do but
[1:12:51] only for a certain type of people for a
[1:12:53] specific class of people
[1:12:56] and and if you want to to just consider
[1:12:58] that for a second take a look at around
[1:13:00] the world maybe even close to home
[1:13:02] there's a lot of people that are not
[1:13:03] very fortunate people all things don't
[1:13:06] necessarily work together for the
[1:13:10] good but to them that love
[1:13:14] God and if you have the ability to love
[1:13:17] God that's because God gave you that
[1:13:19] ability it's not something that your
[1:13:21] parents gave you it's not something that
[1:13:23] your pastor gave you you it's not
[1:13:26] something that you just found somewhere
[1:13:28] along the way an ability to love God
[1:13:30] it's because he fornew you and he chose
[1:13:33] you before the foundation of the world
[1:13:34] to be able to love him in an age that's
[1:13:37] so dark that people can't even love
[1:13:41] themselves even though they do but in a
[1:13:44] vain way but it says in and we know that
[1:13:46] all things work together for the good to
[1:13:47] them that love God and to them who are
[1:13:50] the called according to his purpose amen
[1:13:55] and I think that's so good we could even
[1:13:56] take that as a maybe a subheading from
[1:13:59] his will his purpose to think about
[1:14:02] being in his
[1:14:04] purpose if you're called brothers and
[1:14:06] sisters you are called unto his purpose
[1:14:10] and you know we we read it in the
[1:14:11] exposition of the seven Church ages that
[1:14:13] persecutions afflictions which came unto
[1:14:15] me at Antioch laconium leria what
[1:14:18] persecutions I endured but out of them
[1:14:21] all the Lord delivered me we know this
[1:14:22] is Paul talking here to Timothy
[1:14:24] explaining to him this is what happened
[1:14:26] to him but we know that all scripture
[1:14:27] has a compound meaning and Revelation it
[1:14:30] is going to take rapturing Faith for us
[1:14:33] to be able to make it through this age
[1:14:35] in which we live in because we are all
[1:14:36] going to suffer persecutions if we stand
[1:14:40] for this word many times we could just
[1:14:43] say I love Jesus and I'm willing to
[1:14:44] stand for the Bible but when you have a
[1:14:47] multitude of people saying that we
[1:14:49] believe in trinitarian Doctrine and
[1:14:51] anything else is a heresy oh my guess
[1:14:55] what's going to happen the people that
[1:14:56] claim to love God are going to begin to
[1:14:58] persecute you because you don't believe
[1:15:00] it the way they believe it it's a
[1:15:02] terrible thing but it's
[1:15:04] true but you know what out of all of
[1:15:08] them the Lord delivered me and we know
[1:15:11] verse 12 says yay and all that will live
[1:15:13] Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:15:15] persecution and that could be taken on
[1:15:17] maybe a lighter level and and looked at
[1:15:19] from a denominational level I stand for
[1:15:21] Jesus now I'm going to suffer
[1:15:23] persecution true we will suffer
[1:15:25] persecution if we stand for the name of
[1:15:27] Jesus Christ but where the true
[1:15:29] persecution really comes is from within
[1:15:31] brothers and sisters when we really take
[1:15:32] a stand for the word of God and say I am
[1:15:35] not willing to compromise on any amount
[1:15:37] of this word of God it's going to be my
[1:15:39] absolute it's the only thing that won't
[1:15:41] pass away heavens and earth will pass
[1:15:42] away but the word of God is the only
[1:15:45] thing that will remain the only way that
[1:15:46] we're ever going to go into a Rapture is
[1:15:49] to take all of the word of God not take
[1:15:51] part of it not take some of it and say
[1:15:53] you know I I I just going to take some
[1:15:55] of it and just let it apply to me the
[1:15:57] way that I feel like it works the best
[1:15:59] that's not the way it works and you know
[1:16:01] when we say that we can we can many
[1:16:03] times look at the word of God and say
[1:16:05] the whole Bible I'll eat the whole Bible
[1:16:07] but the message of the hour that's a
[1:16:08] little bit much that's going a little
[1:16:10] bit far to say that God sent a prophet
[1:16:12] and he tied up all the Loose Ends and
[1:16:14] all of that that's the truth brothers
[1:16:17] and sisters that is the life and that is
[1:16:19] the way because what is the message of
[1:16:21] the hour it truly is Christ appearing
[1:16:24] back on Earth again it's the word coming
[1:16:27] of Christ and outside of that Doctrine
[1:16:30] outside of being able to receive that
[1:16:31] there will be no Rapture I heard a
[1:16:34] brother preaching and I thought it was
[1:16:35] so
[1:16:37] fascinating if you're interested you can
[1:16:39] ask me and I could tell you later I'm
[1:16:41] not going to try and promote anyone from
[1:16:43] the pulpit but the reason I listen to it
[1:16:45] is because somebody actually mentioned
[1:16:47] it to me and and their friend attends
[1:16:48] the church and the brother preaches
[1:16:50] pretty hard in general which is good
[1:16:54] because he's preaching truth and you
[1:16:56] know what the word of God isn't supposed
[1:16:58] to make us feel good and and and give us
[1:17:00] a a fuzzy warm feeling inside which is
[1:17:03] what some people are looking for the
[1:17:05] message of the hour is to get people
[1:17:06] ready for a Rapture and the only way
[1:17:09] that's going to happen is for us to
[1:17:10] divorce the old man that that that first
[1:17:13] twin that first us has to completely die
[1:17:17] brother bradam says every single Speck
[1:17:19] of that old man has got to die and when
[1:17:22] he dies just leave him don't look back
[1:17:24] at him don't dig him up just let him die
[1:17:28] don't try and even take his pulse to see
[1:17:30] if he's dead just walk away leave that
[1:17:33] old man amen hallelujah but this brother
[1:17:36] he actually took and and said you know
[1:17:38] what's going to happen one of these days
[1:17:39] there's going to be a Rapture of the
[1:17:41] church there's going to be a going away
[1:17:44] of the bride and Satan is actually going
[1:17:47] to be Before the Throne of God and Satan
[1:17:49] is going to set his eyes upon the bride
[1:17:51] and he's going to say oh my look at at
[1:17:55] this I know what's happening and what's
[1:17:57] going to happen this is what he said
[1:17:59] what's going to happen is there's going
[1:18:00] to be three and a half years left for
[1:18:03] Satan that's it three and a half years
[1:18:05] and Satan's going to know that the
[1:18:06] moment that he sees the bride in glory
[1:18:08] he's going to know his time is over and
[1:18:11] when he comes down to Earth because when
[1:18:12] the bride goes up what happens Satan
[1:18:15] comes down he's no longer allowed to
[1:18:17] accuse thee of Brethren anymore when
[1:18:19] Satan comes down for three and a half
[1:18:21] years the moment he comes down to the
[1:18:23] Earth he is going to be at work and he's
[1:18:26] going to be at work with a Vengeance and
[1:18:28] it's not going to be just with one
[1:18:30] country just with one group of people
[1:18:32] it's going to be the entire globe and we
[1:18:34] know we've seen it we've been able to
[1:18:36] witness it this is why it gets me
[1:18:38] excited to talk about we've witnessed it
[1:18:40] with Co how the whole entire world now
[1:18:43] is on board with whatever it is whatever
[1:18:46] the doctrine is whatever the the
[1:18:48] conspiracy is whatever we want to call
[1:18:50] it we know the whole world is dialed in
[1:18:52] and on the same radio frequency whoever
[1:18:54] in control can simply push the button
[1:18:56] and every single country now will fall
[1:18:58] in line with whatever it is they want to
[1:19:01] do and when he comes down from Glory
[1:19:03] he's going to get down to business and
[1:19:05] it's not going to be a pretty time the
[1:19:07] the Bible says that it's going to be
[1:19:08] worse than anything mankind has ever
[1:19:10] seen that's ever been on the face of the
[1:19:13] Earth three and a half years he's going
[1:19:14] to come down he's going to get real busy
[1:19:16] I believe this person when they
[1:19:18] mentioned it to me they were kind of
[1:19:19] upset because of the way this brother
[1:19:22] described it but you know when you stand
[1:19:24] back and you look at at it it's true
[1:19:26] think about what's going to happen the
[1:19:28] devil has had how many years thousands
[1:19:30] of years thousands of years to just go
[1:19:34] and play in the church and get that
[1:19:36] brother upset against that brother and
[1:19:38] play the the political roles and and
[1:19:40] intermingle the churches and get
[1:19:42] governments and be in the world and just
[1:19:44] going up and down to and fro in the
[1:19:46] world and doing his thing going Before
[1:19:47] the Throne of God being able to do all
[1:19:49] of that but when now the last three and
[1:19:51] a half years of his existence happened
[1:19:55] he's going to be mad and we know the
[1:19:57] Bible says he's going to come with a
[1:19:58] great Vengeance in the Book of
[1:20:00] Revelation he's not going to be kind you
[1:20:03] know what time it is brothers and
[1:20:04] sisters it's time to get in the boat
[1:20:06] it's time to get in the ark it's time to
[1:20:08] stop playing church and to get into
[1:20:10] Jesus Christ amen the other thing this
[1:20:13] brother said is there's people who are
[1:20:14] in the message he said denominations but
[1:20:17] then he actually got right into the
[1:20:18] message I know some people are looking
[1:20:20] at me funny but I think it's important
[1:20:21] to say these words we need to know this
[1:20:23] isn't about just playing Church Brothers
[1:20:25] and Sisters there's people who are in
[1:20:27] the message of the hour that actually
[1:20:30] don't want anything to do with the Holy
[1:20:33] Ghost they'll only come so far and stop
[1:20:37] the Holy Ghost is the only thing that's
[1:20:39] going to save you from those three and a
[1:20:40] half years of
[1:20:42] tribulation bring it on but you know
[1:20:45] we're going to sing a song later on I
[1:20:47] think it's so beautiful when the
[1:20:48] children of Israel went went to the to
[1:20:50] the to the Jordan River they got to the
[1:20:52] place where they were actually going to
[1:20:54] send spies out into the land what did
[1:20:56] they do they brought back fruit from
[1:20:58] that Land There was promised to them and
[1:21:00] the fruit they brought to them they said
[1:21:02] taste it and see if this fruit isn't
[1:21:05] good look it this is evidence there is a
[1:21:08] Promised Land There is a land that flow
[1:21:10] us with milk and honey and it's just
[1:21:12] over
[1:21:13] there amen but how many
[1:21:16] people the majority of them they said no
[1:21:19] no no the natural circumstances no my
[1:21:22] job no no no no my career no no my image
[1:21:28] no no no no no no no no my family no no
[1:21:32] no no no that that Pastor he shouldn't
[1:21:34] be there no that Deacon no the song
[1:21:37] leader on and on and on the music
[1:21:40] whatever it is any excuse is good enough
[1:21:42] if you really don't want to do
[1:21:44] something that's what I was taught by my
[1:21:47] pastor and I believe he was on the word
[1:21:49] and that's what I'm going to do is
[1:21:50] preach the word amen get into Christ
[1:21:53] brothers and sisters
[1:21:55] it's not time to play
[1:21:57] church if the thought of three and 1
[1:22:00] half years of tribulation scares you
[1:22:03] then get into
[1:22:05] Christ it scares you for a reason right
[1:22:10] I've taught our boys when you get the
[1:22:12] boys together girls probably aren't this
[1:22:15] way I don't know because I don't have a
[1:22:17] girl but I can only imagine they're not
[1:22:19] this way boys like to be adventurous and
[1:22:21] they love to be daring I remember when I
[1:22:23] was a kid we'd climb the the the roof at
[1:22:25] my friend's house and we would jump off
[1:22:26] the roof onto the grass just jump off
[1:22:30] and if you Liv great you're you're
[1:22:32] adventurous if you didn't get a broken
[1:22:34] leg
[1:22:35] great what a silly thing to
[1:22:38] do but the adventure is there in boys
[1:22:41] it's just there I think with some girls
[1:22:43] it is too but you know what we taught
[1:22:45] our boys was when you get that little
[1:22:47] funny feeling inside of you that says
[1:22:49] don't do it it's for a reason it's a
[1:22:53] self-preservation mechanism that God has
[1:22:55] put inside of this flesh to save us
[1:22:58] brothers and sisters if you're afraid of
[1:23:00] tribulation it's the same thing
[1:23:02] spiritually speaking to you saying get
[1:23:04] into Christ and you know there's a lot
[1:23:07] of people out there in the world they
[1:23:08] don't even have that they have zero fear
[1:23:12] there's no fear of a tribulation they
[1:23:14] would laugh in our face if we told them
[1:23:16] there is a tribulation there is a
[1:23:18] burning hell there is a lake of fire
[1:23:21] there is no eternal life outside of
[1:23:25] Jesus Christ people would laugh if we
[1:23:28] have the ability to hear the voice of
[1:23:30] God he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:23:32] what the spirit saith unto the church if
[1:23:33] we have the ability to hear it brothers
[1:23:34] and sisters jump in that boat get into
[1:23:37] Christ yes I think it was so good
[1:23:40] because the way the brother he brought
[1:23:41] it he said you know if the Rapture of
[1:23:44] the church were to go tomorrow morning
[1:23:47] say Monday morning maybe 9:00 by the
[1:23:50] time people get home from work by the
[1:23:53] time we get home from work at
[1:23:55] 5:00 you can guarantee it that the devil
[1:23:57] is going to have his grip all around the
[1:23:59] world in8 hours time seven hours time
[1:24:03] he's going to come down and he's going
[1:24:05] to get after business he is not going to
[1:24:08] be kind now what I want to do brothers
[1:24:10] and sisters is try and encourage us not
[1:24:12] to be afraid of the tribulation no no
[1:24:15] there is therefore no condemnation to
[1:24:19] those who are in Christ Jesus right and
[1:24:21] what does love do
[1:24:25] it casts out fear so what do we have to
[1:24:28] be afraid of there should be zero fear
[1:24:30] of a tribulation amen zero because we
[1:24:34] know we're in Christ Jesus am so I want
[1:24:37] to encourage us to get into Christ and
[1:24:40] you know we sing that song but is it
[1:24:43] true I keep falling in love with him
[1:24:47] over and over and over and over again do
[1:24:52] we or is it something we say is it
[1:24:55] tradition if it's tradition brothers and
[1:24:58] sisters I just want to encourage us to
[1:25:00] push aside the tradition shake off all
[1:25:03] of the all of the maybe the Moss
[1:25:05] whatever we want to call it shake off
[1:25:07] all of the Dust anything in our
[1:25:09] experience that would hold us back from
[1:25:11] being able to experience the fullness of
[1:25:13] the word because you know we don't have
[1:25:15] to be afraid we don't have to worry we
[1:25:18] don't have to be upset God is in control
[1:25:22] of every single situation of every sing
[1:25:25] that's happening brothers and sisters or
[1:25:28] he's
[1:25:29] not and we have to choose that either
[1:25:32] he's in control or he's
[1:25:34] not so if we say that he is then we can
[1:25:37] have complete faith but if we say well
[1:25:40] no he's in control of everything but
[1:25:41] brother Barry he's just out of control
[1:25:43] so God's not
[1:25:45] what he's in control of every single
[1:25:47] situation and many times brothers and
[1:25:49] sisters what he wants to do is allow
[1:25:51] certain things to happen just to see how
[1:25:54] we're going to
[1:25:56] react because it shows who's on the
[1:25:58] inside amen
[1:26:00] hallelujah anyways I just thought it was
[1:26:03] real interesting Don't Be Afraid
[1:26:06] brothers and sisters there is a
[1:26:07] tribulation there is a hell there is a
[1:26:09] heaven there is an eternal life right I
[1:26:11] want to encourage us to fall in love
[1:26:13] with Jesus Christ I want to encourage us
[1:26:15] to taste of this fruit and see if it is
[1:26:19] not something that will change our life
[1:26:21] forever because if you ever truly get
[1:26:24] into Jesus Christ according to True
[1:26:27] water baptism according to the true word
[1:26:30] of God according to the message of the
[1:26:32] hour you will never turn back on it you
[1:26:34] will never be able to walk away from it
[1:26:37] you just won't be able to but you know
[1:26:40] we're talking about God's Will from the
[1:26:42] perspective of Joseph and uh I just
[1:26:44] think it's such a such an amazing study
[1:26:47] and I know that I'm not doing it justice
[1:26:49] by the way I've gone about it so you'll
[1:26:51] have to forgive me but uh I just think
[1:26:55] there's so much in here we had talked
[1:26:57] about the children of uh of
[1:27:03] Jacob and if you don't mind brother this
[1:27:07] time I actually got the graphic and uh I
[1:27:11] didn't actually send it last time last
[1:27:13] time I thought I sent it and I actually
[1:27:16] had sent it to myself it was quite early
[1:27:18] in the morning and I didn't have much
[1:27:21] sleep and you know my my wife knows that
[1:27:23] I'm pretty good at doing that sort of
[1:27:25] thing when it I'm not an
[1:27:27] emailer I'm more of a a person that will
[1:27:30] talk but yeah I tried to send an email
[1:27:33] and it just didn't work so this time I'm
[1:27:35] sure that I did it and uh I think we
[1:27:38] have it here but I I just wanted to
[1:27:41] point something out as we start here
[1:27:44] about the children of Jacob and and she
[1:27:46] can bring it up if you have it there so
[1:27:50] are you just getting it going thank you
[1:27:52] there's something about these children
[1:27:53] that I didn't realize before I got into
[1:27:56] this study here and so can everybody see
[1:28:00] that okay you can see Abraham and Sarah
[1:28:04] Isaac and Rebecca and then
[1:28:06] Jacob
[1:28:08] Jacob we know that he had a life uh
[1:28:12] we're going to get into it a little bit
[1:28:13] later but what I wanted to say was that
[1:28:15] Jacob had two
[1:28:17] wives Leah was the first one and Rachel
[1:28:21] was the second one and I apologize I was
[1:28:23] called calling Rachel Rebecca last week
[1:28:26] and I didn't mean to but it's the
[1:28:29] flesh but we have those two wives but
[1:28:31] then there is the handmaids the servants
[1:28:34] zilpa and baa and and I didn't recognize
[1:28:38] originally that they actually had
[1:28:41] children that were counted as children
[1:28:44] who were part of the 12 Patriarchs of
[1:28:48] Israel kind of interesting the other
[1:28:50] thing that I wanted to point out as well
[1:28:51] if you look here on this side through r
[1:28:54] this is where we're talking about Joseph
[1:28:56] look at how shaky I am wow Joseph is
[1:29:00] actually this the one we're talking
[1:29:02] about that's I think so important for
[1:29:04] our study but uh you know everywhere
[1:29:07] that Joseph went he was in the will of
[1:29:09] the Lord and and we know that's the case
[1:29:11] that's what we're getting at and uh
[1:29:13] Benjamin is a type of the Jews that are
[1:29:15] still in Israel the 144,000 brother Bram
[1:29:18] talks about the little Benjamins that
[1:29:20] are still there those two are
[1:29:22] represented but you know isn't it
[1:29:24] interesting that over on this side
[1:29:26] through Leah is the one Joseph did not
[1:29:31] love her Jacob did not love her I
[1:29:34] apologize like he loved Rachel he
[1:29:37] actually was tricked he was beguiled is
[1:29:39] what the word says into taking Leah for
[1:29:42] his wife but through that
[1:29:44] beguilement is the tribe of
[1:29:50] Judah I don't think I had ever seen that
[1:29:52] before I mean I mean I just sort of took
[1:29:54] it for granted but do do you know what I
[1:29:56] mean am I it's just strange that that's
[1:30:00] the case that through Leah the tribe of
[1:30:02] Judah the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:30:05] comes through that lineage not even
[1:30:07] through the lineage of Joseph it's
[1:30:09] amazing to see but Joseph was a type of
[1:30:12] Christ and we're going to get into him
[1:30:14] as we go forwards thank you for bringing
[1:30:16] that up Brothers if anyone is interested
[1:30:18] I could send that or you could just look
[1:30:20] it up online it's real easy to find uh
[1:30:23] it's neat to look at you know talking
[1:30:25] about the story of Jacob I I just felt
[1:30:28] impressed to go back a little ways today
[1:30:30] and I know that I kind of went a little
[1:30:32] ahead last time I felt like I needed to
[1:30:34] but I just wanted to turn over to
[1:30:36] Genesis 26 and just talk a little bit
[1:30:39] about Jacob amen and
[1:30:43] how how his life was because some of the
[1:30:47] behavior that we saw with lean isn't
[1:30:51] necessarily a whole lot different than
[1:30:52] what he was used to in his life was it
[1:30:55] yeah if we turn over to uh Genesis
[1:30:59] chapter sorry 25 Genesis
[1:31:05] 25 just a quick little study here about
[1:31:12] Jacob and how some of this came
[1:31:16] about in verse
[1:31:18] 25 of Genesis
[1:31:22] 25 talking about the two babies when
[1:31:24] they came out the first came out red all
[1:31:27] over like a hairy garment and they
[1:31:30] called his name
[1:31:32] Esau and after that came his brother out
[1:31:36] and his hand took hold on Esau's heel
[1:31:40] and his name was called Jacob and Isaac
[1:31:42] was three score years old when she bare
[1:31:46] them and the boys grew and Esau was a
[1:31:49] cunning Hunter a man of the field and
[1:31:51] Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents
[1:31:55] and Isaac loved
[1:31:58] Esau because he did eat of his
[1:32:02] venison but Rebecca loved
[1:32:04] Jacob this is where it gets interesting
[1:32:08] I I find it interesting that the word of
[1:32:09] God would say there was a reason why
[1:32:13] Isaac loved
[1:32:15] Esau but there's no reason for Rebecca
[1:32:17] to love Jacob Hallelujah she just loved
[1:32:20] him she just expressed a love and you
[1:32:23] know brothers and sisters I want to just
[1:32:25] weave this in and out as we go today
[1:32:27] that's that's what I want to encourage
[1:32:29] us with the word with Jesus Christ for
[1:32:32] us today let there not be strings
[1:32:33] attached to your love for him when you
[1:32:36] can come to the place where you can just
[1:32:38] love him out of
[1:32:40] pure completely undefiled love from your
[1:32:43] heart I believe that's where we will see
[1:32:45] things happen in our
[1:32:47] lives Rebecca she just loved Jacob verse
[1:32:51] 29 and Jacob sought pottage and Es es
[1:32:54] came from the field and he was faint and
[1:32:57] Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee
[1:32:59] with that same red podage for I am faint
[1:33:04] therefore was his name called
[1:33:08] Edom and Jacob said sell me this day thy
[1:33:11] Birthright and Esau said behold I am at
[1:33:14] the point to die and what profit shall
[1:33:18] this Birthright do to
[1:33:20] me when Jacob said swear to me this day
[1:33:24] and he swear unto him and he sold his
[1:33:27] Birthright unto
[1:33:29] Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and
[1:33:32] pottage of
[1:33:33] lentils and he did eat and drink and
[1:33:35] Rose up and went his way thus Esau
[1:33:40] despised his
[1:33:42] Birthright how did he despise his
[1:33:45] Birthright by his
[1:33:47] actions his actions spoke much louder
[1:33:50] than his
[1:33:51] words the birthright didn't mean much to
[1:33:54] him but he was willing to forego that
[1:33:56] Birthright just for a little bit of
[1:33:58] natural circumstance
[1:34:01] change don't be willing to forego our
[1:34:03] Birthright brothers and sisters for a
[1:34:05] little bit of natural circumstance
[1:34:08] change if we don't have a job but we
[1:34:11] have a good church wherever it is I want
[1:34:14] to say this it's important amen God will
[1:34:17] bless you if you're willing to seek him
[1:34:20] yes amen he will honor you with your
[1:34:23] faith Faith towards
[1:34:25] him well we know the prophet said God
[1:34:27] said through the prophet to this age
[1:34:30] choosing of a bride the church is the
[1:34:32] first and
[1:34:33] foremost if you are a
[1:34:36] Believer where you Fellowship counts it
[1:34:39] is very important not only for you but
[1:34:42] for your entire family and not only for
[1:34:44] you and your entire family but for that
[1:34:48] assembly because if we're not supposed
[1:34:50] to be there in that church what's going
[1:34:52] to happen is we're going to be a Jonah
[1:34:54] to our family to ourselves and even that
[1:34:57] congregation I don't think anyone wants
[1:34:59] to be a
[1:35:00] Jonah God will allow the circumstances
[1:35:02] to get real rough and bumpy he knows how
[1:35:04] to bring things to pass in our
[1:35:07] lives what I want to get to here talking
[1:35:09] about this in
[1:35:11] Genesis how we had an
[1:35:15] opportunity for this boy Jacob to
[1:35:20] actually have a blessing from his dad
[1:35:25] and we know the story I'm not going to
[1:35:26] go too far into it that way but how
[1:35:30] Jacob he was told by his mother he was
[1:35:32] coerced he was encouraged by his mother
[1:35:35] you know what your your brother has been
[1:35:37] requested by his dad your dad to go and
[1:35:40] get some venison go out in the field and
[1:35:42] and get get the Venison and uh just
[1:35:45] bring it back and feed him and we know
[1:35:48] that while this
[1:35:50] happened the
[1:35:52] mother she told told Jacob let's let's
[1:35:56] quickly do up some some food and we'll
[1:35:59] make it look like this is Esau coming
[1:36:02] back and and will trick Dad into giving
[1:36:04] you the blessing why would Mom do
[1:36:07] that that was the mother's love hey it's
[1:36:11] pretty amazing to think that uh that's
[1:36:14] kind of the way it happened but it is it
[1:36:17] is the way it happened and uh we know
[1:36:20] that because of that Esau came back in
[1:36:24] and he said Dad bless me this is well
[1:36:26] after Jacob came in and tricked Dad into
[1:36:28] getting the blessing and Jacob he knew
[1:36:31] that he had to flee mom told him you
[1:36:33] know what you better leave you better
[1:36:34] just go and see my my brother go and
[1:36:36] stay with my brother and and and see
[1:36:38] them and just wait until the anger in
[1:36:40] your brother dwindles but right now he
[1:36:44] probably wants to kill you he probably
[1:36:45] wants to get you so you better just go
[1:36:48] and and we know verse 45 of Genesis
[1:36:50] chapter 27 says until thy brother's
[1:36:52] anger turn away from thee and he forget
[1:36:57] that which thou Hast done to him then I
[1:37:00] will send and fetch thee from then why
[1:37:03] should I be deprived also of you both in
[1:37:07] one day and we know that that's what
[1:37:10] happened he went and and he he went and
[1:37:15] and did his thing and while he was
[1:37:18] living there with lean we know that this
[1:37:21] is where he came in and and and made the
[1:37:24] deal with lean he he met Rachel not
[1:37:28] Rebecca Rachel he met her at the well
[1:37:31] and uh watered the the animals and
[1:37:34] that's where the connection started and
[1:37:36] we we talked about this last time I just
[1:37:38] thought it was important to go back and
[1:37:40] just maybe pick up excuse me where Jacob
[1:37:44] actually got into going to seea because
[1:37:48] there's something real special that I
[1:37:50] wanted to talk to talk to you us about
[1:37:53] today and that is about how Jacob once
[1:37:58] he actually went forwards we know that
[1:38:01] there's a a lot going on here Genesis
[1:38:05] from where we talked about Leah Genesis
[1:38:08] chapter 29 Leah and Rachel and Zila and
[1:38:13] uh Bea we know that all the children
[1:38:15] were born and and there came a time
[1:38:18] where God came to Jacob and said you
[1:38:20] know what up it's time for you to go
[1:38:22] back to your Kindred it's time to you
[1:38:24] for you to leave this place and go and
[1:38:27] and he told his father-in-law enough is
[1:38:29] enough I've got to go we've we've done
[1:38:31] this 14 plus years of of bargaining for
[1:38:34] your daughters and and everything that
[1:38:37] we have together is is what we have and
[1:38:39] and we need to separate and go and uh so
[1:38:42] he did that and we know that when he
[1:38:44] left he didn't leave on good terms he
[1:38:47] left in a way that was a little bit
[1:38:49] unsettled I'm I wanted to say Shifty but
[1:38:51] I'll say unsettled and we we know it was
[1:38:54] so unsettled that lean and his sons came
[1:38:57] after Jacob and met him and said what's
[1:39:00] going on how come did you do this to me
[1:39:04] and it's interesting because one of the
[1:39:06] daughters actually stole the idols took
[1:39:08] the idols from Daddy's house and had
[1:39:11] them with her and I believe it was
[1:39:13] Rachel if I'm not mistaken that had the
[1:39:17] idols and pretended that it was that
[1:39:19] time of her life and sat in the tent and
[1:39:22] we know out of respect for the female
[1:39:25] that way her dad never came and
[1:39:28] overthrew the tent and just left her
[1:39:30] alone but she stole the idol she wasn't
[1:39:32] willing to part with the old idolatry
[1:39:36] and we're going to get to something here
[1:39:37] as we go but uh I think it's just
[1:39:41] beautiful how we look at Genesis chap 32
[1:39:45] and we're getting into Joseph this is
[1:39:47] heading towards Joseph I hope Lord
[1:39:49] willing Genesis chapter 32
[1:39:53] Jacob went on his way verse one and the
[1:39:56] angels of God met him and when Jacob saw
[1:39:59] them he said this is God's host and he
[1:40:02] called the name of that place mahim
[1:40:06] mahim and we know that Jacob just I'm
[1:40:10] not going to read it all as he was going
[1:40:12] he he was heading towards the land of
[1:40:14] Esau his brother who actually wanted his
[1:40:17] life for not just duping him out of the
[1:40:20] birthright for the pottage but actually
[1:40:23] going and getting the blessing from Dad
[1:40:25] afterwards for that and uh it was it was
[1:40:29] uh it was a pretty uh treacherous deal
[1:40:32] that he did in his family within the
[1:40:34] family to to do something like that not
[1:40:37] only to trick his brother his brother
[1:40:38] didn't realize the power of His words
[1:40:40] but then to actually spit it on the
[1:40:42] parents and get the parents to do it and
[1:40:44] you would think that the parents could
[1:40:45] just go back on their word and and say
[1:40:48] you know it was just trickery so it's
[1:40:50] not going to happen but for some reason
[1:40:53] Isaac wouldn't change it he said what's
[1:40:55] done is done I can't change it God it's
[1:40:58] it's already too late but in chapter 32
[1:41:02] verse 9 and Jacob said oh god of my
[1:41:07] father this is where he gets a little
[1:41:09] bit desperate and he begins to cry out
[1:41:12] to God himself and and I just think that
[1:41:14] many times in our lives God likes us to
[1:41:17] get to the place where we've become a
[1:41:19] little bit desperate where we're not
[1:41:21] interested in looking at the the little
[1:41:22] tin frivolous problems in this life but
[1:41:25] we're actually really focusing on him
[1:41:28] God loves it when we get there because
[1:41:29] that's what he specializes in coming on
[1:41:31] the scene when we truly genuinely pray
[1:41:33] to him and and this is Jacob's prayer
[1:41:36] and Jacob said oh god of My Father
[1:41:38] Abraham verse 9 of 32 and God of my
[1:41:42] father Isaac the Lord which saidst unto
[1:41:45] me return unto thy country and to thy
[1:41:48] Kindred and I will deal well with thee
[1:41:52] so he's taking God back to that memory
[1:41:55] showing God I remember that you called
[1:41:57] me once upon a time in my life you
[1:42:00] called me and and this is the latest
[1:42:02] time you called me and I just want to
[1:42:03] remind you of that God you are the only
[1:42:06] one true God and I want to remind you of
[1:42:09] your words you called me verse 10 says I
[1:42:11] am not worthy of the least of all the
[1:42:15] mercies and of all the truth which thou
[1:42:18] Hast showed unto thy servant for with my
[1:42:22] staff I passed over this Jordan as I was
[1:42:25] reading and studying this I just thought
[1:42:27] how many of us are willing to pray a
[1:42:28] prayer like that knowing the message of
[1:42:30] the hour we're not worthy of the least
[1:42:33] of the grace and the mercies that we get
[1:42:36] our benefits out of the message of the
[1:42:39] hour right verse 11 deliver me I pray
[1:42:42] thee from the hand of my brother from
[1:42:45] the hand of Esau for I fear Him lest he
[1:42:49] will come and smite me and the mother
[1:42:53] with the
[1:42:54] children and thou sest I will surely do
[1:42:59] thee good and make thy seed as the sand
[1:43:03] of the sea which cannot be numbered for
[1:43:06] multitude and we know this verse here
[1:43:09] speaks directly back to where he was in
[1:43:13] bethl the place that he called bethl
[1:43:15] that's where we had Jacob's Ladder and
[1:43:18] the Angels were ascending and descending
[1:43:20] and he saw the angels and we know
[1:43:23] brother Bram preached this and it's just
[1:43:25] so beautiful because we've heard other
[1:43:26] brothers I think brother Andrew Glover
[1:43:28] said it that that anchor that ladder
[1:43:30] Jacob's Ladder is anchored in the heart
[1:43:33] the throne in the earth and it's also
[1:43:36] anchored to the throne the The Throne of
[1:43:38] God in heaven that anchor is sure and
[1:43:41] it's unmovable and those angels are
[1:43:43] ascending and descending to each and
[1:43:45] every person who is willing to believe
[1:43:48] it but we know that he called this place
[1:43:50] bethl he called this place bethl the
[1:43:52] house of God and thou sest I will surely
[1:43:56] do thee good and make thy seed as the
[1:43:59] sand of the sea which cannot be numbered
[1:44:01] for multitude and he lodged there that
[1:44:04] same night and he took of that which
[1:44:06] came to his hand as a present for Esau
[1:44:10] his brother and we know that he goes on
[1:44:12] to create many different flocks and
[1:44:15] herds that he sends forward ahead to see
[1:44:19] his brother and and we know that he
[1:44:20] spaces them apart he doesn't set them
[1:44:23] all together as one big group and we
[1:44:25] know that he also separated the tribe in
[1:44:29] half one group and the other group so
[1:44:32] that if one group was to perish at the
[1:44:34] hand of his brother who really wanted to
[1:44:35] kill him and make him suffer then the
[1:44:37] other group would be saved that's what
[1:44:38] he said but what I want to get to is
[1:44:40] Genesis 32 real familiar scripture verse
[1:44:43] 24 and as Jacob was left alone and there
[1:44:47] wrestled with a man with him until the
[1:44:50] breaking of the day and when he
[1:44:54] prevailed not against him he touched the
[1:44:56] hollow of his thigh and the hollow of
[1:44:58] Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he
[1:45:01] wrestled with him and he said let me go
[1:45:04] for the day
[1:45:05] breakthe will not let thee go except
[1:45:08] thou bless me and he said unto him what
[1:45:11] is thy name and he said Jacob and he
[1:45:14] said thy name shall be called No More
[1:45:16] Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast
[1:45:20] thou power with God and with men and
[1:45:24] Hast
[1:45:26] prevailed and Jacob asked him and said
[1:45:29] tell me I pray thee thy name and he said
[1:45:32] wherefore is it that thou Dost ask after
[1:45:35] my name and he blessed him there and
[1:45:39] brothers and sisters I want to talk
[1:45:41] about this part right here because it's
[1:45:44] I believe real important I believe the
[1:45:46] Lord showed me this and it's real
[1:45:48] important we have got to see certain
[1:45:51] things in the scriptures to
[1:45:53] understand that God will not just let us
[1:45:55] float through life and and deal with
[1:45:58] things and leave them sort of undone God
[1:46:02] will actually come around and make sure
[1:46:04] the things are sure in our lives and if
[1:46:07] we ever have things in our lives that
[1:46:09] maybe aren't sure that aren't done right
[1:46:11] maybe from the past maybe from many
[1:46:13] years ago that have have been done and
[1:46:15] we've just sort of swept it under the
[1:46:16] rug or maybe life has just pushed us
[1:46:18] down the road and we haven't been able
[1:46:20] to go back and fix it Whatever It Is God
[1:46:22] will make make sure that it's fixed he
[1:46:24] will not allow us to go forwards with
[1:46:26] any sin in our
[1:46:29] lives and this story about Jacob here I
[1:46:32] know he had a name change and and I know
[1:46:35] that he had his walk changed he never
[1:46:37] walked the same after he met with this
[1:46:39] man but what I think is really really
[1:46:42] interesting about this is that God
[1:46:44] wanted to bless him more than he wanted
[1:46:47] to be blessed just like every single one
[1:46:49] of us we know that's what brother bradam
[1:46:51] taught God wants to bless us a thousand
[1:46:54] times more than we're willing to receive
[1:46:56] it and why is that because of the things
[1:46:59] of this world the pressures of this life
[1:47:01] the troubles the tribulations all the
[1:47:02] things that we get distracted with they
[1:47:05] take up our time and energy and and we
[1:47:07] miss the blessing of God and I want to
[1:47:09] say it this morning I don't know why
[1:47:10] we're even preaching like this I believe
[1:47:12] it's the blessing of God for
[1:47:15] somebody and if you're looking for a
[1:47:17] blessing of God it doesn't matter who's
[1:47:19] preaching or what they're preaching so
[1:47:20] long as it's true word there's a
[1:47:23] blessing in store but here we have Jacob
[1:47:25] now he was left alone he wasn't with
[1:47:27] people he wasn't caught up with all of
[1:47:29] the distractions he was alone and there
[1:47:32] he wrestled with a man until the
[1:47:34] breaking of the day and we know that he
[1:47:36] touched his thigh we've read this and he
[1:47:38] wrestled with him but he said I will not
[1:47:41] I won't let go he said let me go for the
[1:47:43] day breth and he said I will not let
[1:47:45] thee go except for what except for thou
[1:47:48] bless me because he recognized who he
[1:47:51] was wrestling with but he wanted to hear
[1:47:53] him speak his name and he knows that for
[1:47:57] sure if he blesses him then he has truly
[1:48:00] received that blessing and so once he
[1:48:03] received that blessing even though he
[1:48:04] now had a change of name and he had a
[1:48:06] change of walk he's able to go forwards
[1:48:09] walking differently than he ever has
[1:48:11] before with the assurity that God has
[1:48:15] blessed him it wasn't just a blessing
[1:48:17] from man that he received out of Deceit
[1:48:20] think about how many nights he must have
[1:48:22] sat up wondering did I really get
[1:48:24] blessed did I really have the blessing
[1:48:26] my brother wants to kill me how could I
[1:48:29] have the blessing of God in my life I
[1:48:31] tricked him to get the the the blessing
[1:48:34] the birthright mom and I tricked him to
[1:48:36] to give me the blessing to get Dad to
[1:48:39] pray for me and do I really have that
[1:48:41] blessing in my life how many people
[1:48:43] wrestle with the idea in your mind
[1:48:45] whether you've got the blessing of God
[1:48:47] in your life or not whether you've got
[1:48:48] the holy ghost in your life or not right
[1:48:53] I saw one hand back there you know what
[1:48:56] brothers and sisters it's a normal thing
[1:48:57] the devil wants us to believe that we
[1:48:59] don't have the blessing of God if you
[1:49:00] have the ability to receive the word the
[1:49:02] message of the hour you've got the
[1:49:04] blessing you've got the birthright and
[1:49:06] when that happens you don't walk the
[1:49:09] same if you're just walking the same way
[1:49:13] something's
[1:49:14] wrong now I want to say this I think
[1:49:17] it's important we were having the
[1:49:19] conversation I had an opportunity this
[1:49:20] weekend or the end of this week our boys
[1:49:23] went to Camp Isaac and Benjamin so I
[1:49:26] just had the opportunity to spend some
[1:49:27] time with Christopher and we were having
[1:49:29] some really good
[1:49:31] conversations about the word of God how
[1:49:34] some people can have an experience where
[1:49:36] they come out of the myy clay out of the
[1:49:38] muck of this world and God transforms
[1:49:41] their life so dramatically they can say
[1:49:44] they've had a change God's given them
[1:49:46] the birthright they've got the blessing
[1:49:48] in their life then there's others that
[1:49:50] grow up in the message and they've never
[1:49:52] experience that and thanks be to God
[1:49:55] they will never have to because all it
[1:49:58] does is brings scars it brings pain it
[1:50:01] brings suffering there's things that
[1:50:03] happen that you can't undo you just have
[1:50:06] to now live
[1:50:08] with and where this conversation really
[1:50:10] started it was interesting because it
[1:50:12] was all about I I like to bake bread I
[1:50:15] I'm just going to be honest and tell you
[1:50:18] a little bit about me if you don't know
[1:50:19] it but I like to make sourdough bread
[1:50:21] and so opened up a loaf because we have
[1:50:24] a few different bags knocking around of
[1:50:26] this bread and I opened up one I was
[1:50:28] going to make some toast for Christopher
[1:50:30] and I I I opened up one and uh oh my
[1:50:33] this one was a little more than just
[1:50:35] bread it was already dressed up but it
[1:50:37] was like blue and green and white spots
[1:50:39] all over it and I was like man this this
[1:50:43] ain't something we're going to eat we're
[1:50:44] not going to eat this no way and and so
[1:50:47] I showed him and let him smell it and
[1:50:49] let him see the mold and I said to him
[1:50:51] you know Christopher this makes me think
[1:50:52] think about a story in the Bible and so
[1:50:54] I began to express the story in the
[1:50:56] Bible about the hivites and how the
[1:50:59] children of Israel were over in the
[1:51:00] promised land I remember graphically my
[1:51:03] pastor preaching this this this story
[1:51:05] and and how they were in the promised
[1:51:07] land and the instructions were to not
[1:51:10] take anybody to not let anybody not to
[1:51:14] spare anybody's life to March forward
[1:51:17] and Conquer
[1:51:18] everyone and not have compassion on
[1:51:20] anybody in the land but what happened
[1:51:22] was there was two Travelers two guys
[1:51:25] they came to the children of Israel they
[1:51:27] came to Joshua my goodness they they had
[1:51:31] tattered clothes and and they had clumpy
[1:51:34] shoes and worn out everything wine skins
[1:51:37] that were all worn out and and and they
[1:51:39] had moldy dried bread and they said to
[1:51:42] Joshua when we came you know what this
[1:51:45] bread was fresh this was fresh bread
[1:51:47] when we left it was just fresh out of
[1:51:49] the oven fresh hot bread and if you know
[1:51:52] fresh hot bread it doesn't turn moldy
[1:51:54] except for about 3 or 4 days down the
[1:51:56] road maybe even
[1:51:59] five depends on how old it is but when
[1:52:01] it comes out of the oven you've got some
[1:52:02] shelf life you've got some room to
[1:52:04] maneuver and it just made me think about
[1:52:06] it seeing this moldy bread and it was
[1:52:07] dry and so I started to have this
[1:52:09] conversation with Christopher and how
[1:52:11] we're not supposed to take any and and
[1:52:13] make any concessions for any sin in the
[1:52:15] land when we're in the promised land
[1:52:17] brothers and sisters there's no no no
[1:52:19] concessions that we make we don't make a
[1:52:21] deal with the Devil you don't have to
[1:52:23] say I've got this issue and I'll just
[1:52:25] accept it and carry it on and say well
[1:52:27] it was my my father or my grandfather it
[1:52:29] was just a genetics in our family and we
[1:52:31] just need to accept it and move on
[1:52:33] that's a lie of the
[1:52:34] devil because if we are truly baptized
[1:52:37] with the Holy Spirit there is no
[1:52:39] generational curse no generational sin
[1:52:42] that can Prevail over Jesus
[1:52:45] Christ because that's what the Holy
[1:52:47] Ghost is so really if we say we've got
[1:52:50] this thing and we're just willing to
[1:52:52] accept it what we're doing is we're
[1:52:54] making a concession and we know once
[1:52:55] they did that once the children of
[1:52:57] Israel did that the part that I remember
[1:52:59] my pastor saying was that even after
[1:53:02] they actually did make the league with
[1:53:05] them they could have said you know what
[1:53:07] we made a mistake and we're not going to
[1:53:10] accept
[1:53:11] this but they didn't they said we oh our
[1:53:14] word is our bond and now we're going to
[1:53:16] keep it now we're just going to go
[1:53:18] forwards and you're going to be our
[1:53:19] servants now and so now the children of
[1:53:22] Israel had made a concession with the
[1:53:24] people in the land they actually
[1:53:25] contravene the will of God they didn't
[1:53:27] follow the word for their
[1:53:29] day but it was interesting just to think
[1:53:32] about that story how it just came up and
[1:53:35] and how important it is going back now
[1:53:37] and what I was talking about some people
[1:53:39] can have the the great transformation
[1:53:41] but other people they don't do that
[1:53:43] because they're raised in the message
[1:53:45] they're raised in the purity of the word
[1:53:47] but I want to say this brothers and
[1:53:49] sisters if something has kept us from
[1:53:51] going out into that world what is it
[1:53:53] that kept you from going out into that
[1:53:55] world I'll tell you what it is if you
[1:53:56] don't understand it on your own whether
[1:53:58] you're a young adult or or maybe a a
[1:54:01] child it's the prayers of your parents
[1:54:04] according to the word of God for their
[1:54:05] day God honors the prayers of those
[1:54:07] people who truly seek
[1:54:10] Him and especially when you have the
[1:54:12] Holy Ghost in your life and you start
[1:54:14] praying for your children brothers and
[1:54:16] sisters there ain't no devil that can
[1:54:17] come against you ain't no devil that can
[1:54:20] come against and Prevail your family
[1:54:23] there's weapons that will be formed but
[1:54:25] no weapon can
[1:54:30] prosper so when you're a child and
[1:54:32] you're
[1:54:33] raised in the word of God in the message
[1:54:36] of the hour you don't have the desire to
[1:54:37] go out and do those things you don't
[1:54:39] have to let the devil Badger you and say
[1:54:41] oh you don't have the Holy Ghost in your
[1:54:43] life it's not a struggle you need to
[1:54:46] fight because really what's happening is
[1:54:48] you're fighting a defeated
[1:54:51] enemy but he wants us to believe oh no
[1:54:53] you didn't have that experience in your
[1:54:55] life so you don't have the Holy Ghost so
[1:54:56] you might as well just give up and and
[1:54:58] go and eat and drink and be merry for
[1:55:00] tomorrow you'll
[1:55:01] die that's not the case if you're a true
[1:55:04] son and daughter of God you're going to
[1:55:05] stay on this side of Eternity until the
[1:55:08] time appointed of the father and you're
[1:55:10] going to come the way that he wants you
[1:55:12] to come and that's just going to
[1:55:15] happen but I I just think it's so
[1:55:17] important for us to remind our children
[1:55:20] that just because you haven't had that
[1:55:22] lightning bolt experience maybe even as
[1:55:24] an adult you haven't had that experience
[1:55:27] that some other people have had if you
[1:55:29] have something inside of you that wants
[1:55:31] to go to church that wants to serve God
[1:55:33] that doesn't want to take you out to the
[1:55:35] bars and out to the parties and out to
[1:55:37] all the worldly entertainments that's
[1:55:39] Jesus Christ amen and you need to
[1:55:42] acknowledge it and recognize it and when
[1:55:44] you can do that I believe it gives you a
[1:55:46] certain strength in your life I was
[1:55:49] trying to encourage Christopher with
[1:55:51] that you know if you don't have the
[1:55:53] desire to go and do the bad things and
[1:55:55] to act bad then that's one sign but
[1:55:57] another sign that's real important for
[1:55:59] us maybe this is just really Elementary
[1:56:01] and I pray that you'd forgive me but
[1:56:03] maybe just for the children's sake if
[1:56:05] you maybe just don't desire to go and do
[1:56:07] that stuff a and that's one aspect of it
[1:56:10] to know that you actually are in the
[1:56:12] will of God but another aspect of it
[1:56:14] this is totally just off the notes I I I
[1:56:16] don't know I just love the way the Lord
[1:56:19] does it you know if you just don't have
[1:56:22] the desire to go out in sin that's one
[1:56:24] thing but when you do go in sin that's
[1:56:28] where the devil's waiting that's where
[1:56:30] the treacherous moment is because he'll
[1:56:32] say oh look what you did you did that so
[1:56:35] clearly you don't have it but that's not
[1:56:37] true what I was telling Christopher is
[1:56:40] when you do sin because you will sin
[1:56:42] when you do sin you have something
[1:56:44] inside of you that wants to repent
[1:56:46] quickly that's God and when you do that
[1:56:50] you're the same as David you're a man
[1:56:53] after God's Own Heart because that was
[1:56:55] the identification for David is that he
[1:56:57] quickly
[1:56:58] repented we're all trapped in this
[1:57:00] hybrid condition we've said it we've got
[1:57:02] the can nature that DNA is coursing
[1:57:06] through our veins we can't escape this
[1:57:08] Beast nature outside of the baptism of
[1:57:10] the Holy Ghost we're all brute beasts
[1:57:13] that's really the way it is but talking
[1:57:15] about Joseph Jacob getting
[1:57:19] into Joseph the story I just thought it
[1:57:22] was really good to go back and take a
[1:57:24] look at Jacob and see how his daddy was
[1:57:26] his daddy wasn't pure as the driven snow
[1:57:29] according to the flesh but we know
[1:57:31] brother bradam he preached the message
[1:57:32] works is Faith expressed and you can
[1:57:36] look at a person according to their
[1:57:38] works and and see whether they have
[1:57:41] faith or not because if they have faith
[1:57:44] they're going to live according to the
[1:57:46] word they're not going to deviate
[1:57:48] they're not going to say I'm just going
[1:57:50] to make concessions and say that I'll
[1:57:51] take the message mage of the hour and
[1:57:53] I'll just live it according to my own
[1:57:55] understanding my own teaching maybe my
[1:57:57] traditions or understandings they're
[1:58:00] going to say you know what I'm going to
[1:58:01] push all of that aside and I'm going to
[1:58:02] say be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:58:06] I can't have room in my life for anybody
[1:58:08] else's theories or ideas I need to have
[1:58:11] that Revelation and when I have that
[1:58:13] Revelation then we get into talking
[1:58:15] about what Jacob has gone through here
[1:58:18] where he has a changed walk where he
[1:58:20] knows that he know knows that he knows
[1:58:23] he can go forwards now and meet his
[1:58:25] brother and God is with him
[1:58:28] again I just think brothers and sisters
[1:58:31] it's so important for us to recognize
[1:58:34] that we need to be willing to do that
[1:58:36] you
[1:58:38] know many times we can have traditions
[1:58:41] we can have ideas and
[1:58:44] understandings and if we are not willing
[1:58:48] to actually push them all aside and just
[1:58:50] say what is it mean to me what does this
[1:58:54] word mean to me what does the message of
[1:58:55] the hour mean to me in my life do I have
[1:58:59] a real revelation of the message of the
[1:59:01] hour if we're willing to go that far
[1:59:04] with it then I guarantee you we
[1:59:06] will I promise you you will have a full
[1:59:10] revelation of it God will not leave us
[1:59:13] nor forsake us that's what he said in
[1:59:15] his word in Genesis chapter 35 talking
[1:59:18] about Jacob going up to Beth
[1:59:23] we know that he had sent forth
[1:59:27] uh oh my this is even going beyond that
[1:59:30] sorry I I just had studied this story
[1:59:33] and and it's just going Beyond I'll just
[1:59:36] quickly brush on this chapter 33 of
[1:59:38] Genesis and and going into chapter
[1:59:46] 34 we know that he had a daughter named
[1:59:49] Dena and uh out side of of of the the
[1:59:57] city there was a boy named she sheim the
[2:00:01] son of hmor the
[2:00:02] hivite and uh he saw her and he took her
[2:00:07] and he laid with her and defiled her and
[2:00:09] his soul clave unto Dena the daughter of
[2:00:11] Jacob I I personally believe that he
[2:00:14] fell in love with her and that's what
[2:00:15] the word of God says and he loved the
[2:00:17] damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel
[2:00:19] and we know that they went forward and
[2:00:22] uh the brothers weren't very happy about
[2:00:24] what happened to their sister outside of
[2:00:26] this outside of this city and they were
[2:00:28] camped outside of this city and uh this
[2:00:31] boy they they fellowshipped with the
[2:00:33] people in the city and and that was the
[2:00:35] invitation and it wasn't the right
[2:00:37] invitation they shouldn't have done that
[2:00:38] but here they go and they do that and
[2:00:40] now this this happened and two of the
[2:00:43] brothers Simeon and Levi were not happy
[2:00:46] with it this was dena's Brethren this
[2:00:49] was two sons of Leah and we know that
[2:00:51] Leah was actually the mother of Dena
[2:00:53] also but Simeon and Levi they decided
[2:00:57] we're going to play h a trick on these
[2:00:59] guys and we're going to tell them the
[2:01:00] only way that you can have her is if
[2:01:03] you're willing to follow the laws of our
[2:01:05] land and that is that every male has to
[2:01:07] be circumcised and if you're willing to
[2:01:10] do that then you can have the damsel you
[2:01:11] can have our sister and they were fully
[2:01:13] never fully intending to give their
[2:01:16] sister away they said that for a purpose
[2:01:18] because if every male did that it's an
[2:01:20] operation and it made made them sick and
[2:01:22] they had to heal they had to have some
[2:01:24] time and as they went through that
[2:01:26] process what happened was these two men
[2:01:29] Simeon and levite dea's brothers they
[2:01:31] they took each man his sword and came
[2:01:33] upon the city boldly and slew all the
[2:01:36] males can you imagine
[2:01:38] that as a dad with my family I go and I
[2:01:43] I park our camper outside of a city and
[2:01:46] and if I had a daughter I find that one
[2:01:47] of the guys in the city mistreats her
[2:01:49] and now the brothers go and slay
[2:01:52] everybody in the city oh my to think
[2:01:55] about how much repercussions would come
[2:01:57] from a situation like that that's what
[2:01:59] they were up against and now Jacob was
[2:02:01] like my goodness this this whole thing
[2:02:04] of me misbehaving it's never going to
[2:02:05] leave my house but we know it was the
[2:02:08] will of God because all of the
[2:02:10] inhabitants of the land were like wow
[2:02:12] these are not guys we want to mess with
[2:02:15] but it was treacherous for them in the
[2:02:17] moment it wasn't what he wanted to do
[2:02:20] but Jacob again stressed you can only
[2:02:22] imagine he had some prayer meetings in
[2:02:24] chapter 35 it says and God said unto
[2:02:27] Jacob arise and go up to bethl and dwell
[2:02:31] there and make an altar unto God that
[2:02:34] appeared unto thee when thou fled from
[2:02:37] the face of thy
[2:02:39] brother now just talking about Jacob a
[2:02:43] bit before we get into Joseph and I can
[2:02:46] see our it's amazing how this goes um
[2:02:50] just looking at this how Jacob there was
[2:02:53] an instruction from God to go back in
[2:02:57] time in his life to go back to where he
[2:03:01] had put down a stake with God where God
[2:03:04] had dwelt with him and it wasn't just
[2:03:07] Jacob saying I think that I'm going to
[2:03:08] go back to where that time was with God
[2:03:10] this was God calling him and telling him
[2:03:13] go back to that place and you know
[2:03:15] brothers and sisters it just hit me this
[2:03:16] morning as I was studying we have got
[2:03:18] the opportunity to have the conversation
[2:03:20] with god and when are in prayer and
[2:03:22] you're meditating on the word of God
[2:03:24] you're meditating with God you're
[2:03:26] speaking to him and you're just quiet in
[2:03:28] yourself you're not distracted with all
[2:03:30] the things in this world God will speak
[2:03:32] to you and he will tell you to go back
[2:03:35] to that place in your life because
[2:03:38] that's where we had communion and that's
[2:03:41] what God told him go back there to where
[2:03:43] you had communion with me where you fled
[2:03:45] us from your brother in verse two then
[2:03:47] Jacob said unto his household and I just
[2:03:49] think this is real important brothers
[2:03:51] and sisters if we want to have that kind
[2:03:52] of communion we've got to be willing to
[2:03:54] say this to our household fathers
[2:03:56] husbands single Brothers whoever it is
[2:03:58] we've got to be willing to say this to
[2:04:00] our household I think pastors need to be
[2:04:02] willing to say this to their household
[2:04:04] and to all that were with him put away
[2:04:06] the strange gods that are among you and
[2:04:09] be clean and change your garments and
[2:04:12] let's get back to god let's get back to
[2:04:15] that place where we had that strong
[2:04:17] communion and then we know God will deal
[2:04:20] with us he'll show us what we need need
[2:04:21] to know for in our journey in our lives
[2:04:25] I just think this is such an amazing
[2:04:27] discussion now we can just go forwards
[2:04:29] and talk about how Joseph was actually
[2:04:33] in in the land of
[2:04:37] Egypt we know the the the brothers we
[2:04:40] talked about it in the past how the
[2:04:42] brothers did not like him they actually
[2:04:44] didn't like him at all the 12 Brothers
[2:04:47] the 11 Brothers sorry because what did
[2:04:50] he do maybe the 10 Brothers Benjamin
[2:04:52] loved them but the 10 Brothers they
[2:04:55] hated him because God was with him and
[2:04:58] God was not with them God was only
[2:05:01] tolerating them but there was only a
[2:05:04] couple of them that God was really
[2:05:05] interested in and and we know that all
[2:05:09] of the children were born they were born
[2:05:12] from from the Two Sisters Leah and
[2:05:17] Rachel and uh
[2:05:20] builda and I'm forgetting the other one
[2:05:22] the two uh handmaids we know that they
[2:05:25] are the ones the Four Sisters the four
[2:05:28] women were the ones that actually were
[2:05:31] uh the mothers of all the children it
[2:05:34] wasn't just one mother and because of
[2:05:36] that it caused fighting infighting it
[2:05:39] caused feelings of envy and and of
[2:05:43] hatred and uh malice there's different
[2:05:46] things but
[2:05:48] uh you know I I'll just read out of this
[2:05:51] the True Church of Christ in
[2:05:54] 1965 uh sorry it's the choosing of the
[2:05:57] bride and just to talk about the True
[2:05:59] Church of Christ amen how we can bring
[2:06:02] this up to our day I know we're talking
[2:06:03] about the stories and kind of bouncing
[2:06:05] around a bit but I want to get into the
[2:06:08] discussion about Joseph here in uh 1965
[2:06:11] the choosing of a bride brother bradam
[2:06:13] says notice just a minute a nun in the
[2:06:15] Catholic church that woman to become a
[2:06:17] nun takes that last Veil she is
[2:06:20] absolutely sold out to that church she
[2:06:24] is soul body and
[2:06:26] spirit property of that church she has
[2:06:29] no mind of her own she can't have when
[2:06:32] she takes that last Veil no mind of her
[2:06:35] own no will of her own see out here that
[2:06:39] Satan makes them his true bogus like the
[2:06:44] true makes them his bogus like the true
[2:06:46] sorry the True Church of Christ the
[2:06:49] bride is so sold out to him and his
[2:06:52] promised word till the very mind that's
[2:06:55] in Christ is in you what a difference
[2:07:00] brothers and sisters I know that we have
[2:07:01] seen it in the past and I think it's so
[2:07:04] important to talk about maybe people
[2:07:05] won't like it but I think it's important
[2:07:08] that there are people in the message of
[2:07:10] the hour that believes that they need to
[2:07:12] be sold out soul body and spirit become
[2:07:16] property of that church so sold out that
[2:07:19] whatever is suggested the church will
[2:07:21] begin to do it brothers and sisters
[2:07:24] that's not right get into
[2:07:26] Christ we know the word said I'm going
[2:07:28] to get into it today somewhere along the
[2:07:30] way Lord willing let this mind that was
[2:07:33] in Christ Jesus be where in
[2:07:37] you it can't be the pastor's Direction
[2:07:40] the pastor can only point to the word of
[2:07:43] God and if the pastor is not pointing to
[2:07:45] the word of God I'm sorry but I think
[2:07:47] you got the wrong
[2:07:49] pastor but there's people in the message
[2:07:51] of the that have actually gone this way
[2:07:53] where they're so sold out to the church
[2:07:54] and what happens is sadly the children
[2:07:57] grow up see the parents be mistreated
[2:07:59] and then the children are actually not
[2:08:01] able to have a full relationship with
[2:08:03] the church but what we're talking about
[2:08:05] is the true church of Christ the bride
[2:08:08] the mystical body of Jesus Christ that's
[2:08:10] where we want to be sold out that's
[2:08:13] where we want to know the word of God
[2:08:14] ourselves so that nobody can ever
[2:08:16] mistreat the church the True Church of
[2:08:19] Christ the bride is so sold out to him
[2:08:21] his promised word till the very mind
[2:08:24] that's in Christ is in you what a
[2:08:26] difference and we find today the modern
[2:08:28] Church a modern World Church the modern
[2:08:31] world church and also that the spiritual
[2:08:34] church are both pregnated to give birth
[2:08:38] to
[2:08:39] sons and you know one of them one of
[2:08:42] them you could say their name is
[2:08:44] Esau and one of them you could say their
[2:08:46] name is
[2:08:48] Jacob it's very difficult to say but
[2:08:51] it's true true one of them a
[2:08:53] denominational birth is going to be give
[2:08:56] one of of day to these days at the World
[2:09:01] Council of churches which will produce
[2:09:04] to the world the Antichrist through a
[2:09:08] denomination that's exactly the
[2:09:12] truth this is where I think it gets so
[2:09:14] important for us to recognize this is a
[2:09:16] Vindicated Prophet just like Nehemiah
[2:09:19] just like Jeremiah just like Ezekiel
[2:09:22] just like Daniel just like all of the
[2:09:24] prophets here we have a prophet saying
[2:09:27] these
[2:09:28] words he says I may not live to see it I
[2:09:31] believe I will but you young people
[2:09:35] remember that you heard a minister say
[2:09:38] that that'll finally wind up and that's
[2:09:40] the mark of the
[2:09:43] beast when she forms that World Council
[2:09:46] of churches and she'll give birth to her
[2:09:50] son the Antichrist so how is that going
[2:09:51] to happen just by simply compromising on
[2:09:54] our
[2:09:55] Birthright compromising on the word of
[2:09:57] God now we'll just bring it down a
[2:09:59] little further and say compromising on
[2:10:00] the message of the
[2:10:02] hour because if we compromise on the
[2:10:04] message of the hour brothers and sisters
[2:10:05] we're compromising on the word of God if
[2:10:07] we're compromising on the word of God
[2:10:09] we're compromising on our Birthright
[2:10:11] it's terrible but it's true we need to
[2:10:13] make sure that we are absolutely in line
[2:10:16] with the message of the hour for our
[2:10:18] day the other is pregnated by the word
[2:10:21] of of God and will bring forth the body
[2:10:23] the finished body of Jesus Christ which
[2:10:26] is the bride the body of Christ isn't
[2:10:29] finished yet how many knows
[2:10:32] that that's where I can't understand how
[2:10:35] some Ministry would say that it's us for
[2:10:37] no more that he's left the throne
[2:10:40] because the seals are open and he's no
[2:10:42] longer sitting as an intercessory for
[2:10:45] the Bride of Jesus Christ that's not
[2:10:47] true at
[2:10:49] all a man and woman is one
[2:10:52] and Christ is one body the word the
[2:10:54] bride will have to be the rest of that
[2:10:56] body and the two together makes the one
[2:11:00] body again like Adam was at the
[2:11:03] beginning man his wife are one now she
[2:11:07] the true bride so sold out to him that
[2:11:11] she used no mind of her own his mind of
[2:11:16] course is his will and his will is his
[2:11:20] word
[2:11:22] and I'm going to say his word is the
[2:11:27] message it can be difficult I
[2:11:30] know it's not easy to say it but you
[2:11:33] know when we truly get the baptism of
[2:11:35] the Holy Ghost the message becomes a new
[2:11:38] message it's no longer dos and don'ts
[2:11:42] it's no longer a religious Association
[2:11:44] it's no longer a tradition that our
[2:11:46] parents taught us it's actually the life
[2:11:48] of Jesus Christ it takes the word word
[2:11:51] of God and makes it a brand new book to
[2:11:53] us and it gives us the ability to say oh
[2:11:57] my be it unto me according to Thy word
[2:11:59] because I want to be in thy will we
[2:12:02] don't have to be afraid of tribulation
[2:12:03] we don't have to be afraid of permissive
[2:12:05] will all we have to do is March forward
[2:12:08] and trust the Lord and I'm not saying to
[2:12:10] go and walk over Flags when God tells
[2:12:12] you when you're in prayer to not do
[2:12:15] something and we go and do it brothers
[2:12:16] and sisters God speaks to us amen if we
[2:12:20] do that he'll let us know and we'll know
[2:12:22] real quick his permissive will but then
[2:12:24] I want to say this to you I want to say
[2:12:26] it to me I want to say it to us just go
[2:12:28] back to where we were with him go back
[2:12:31] to where we did have communion with him
[2:12:33] just go back to where you get off is
[2:12:34] what brother bradam said where you found
[2:12:36] that you got off track you know God will
[2:12:38] sell he'll tell you we won't be groping
[2:12:41] in darkness wondering where we where we
[2:12:44] got off we'll know exactly the red flag
[2:12:46] that we stepped over I said Lord help me
[2:12:49] I know that I've stepped over Flags in
[2:12:51] my time I trust that I've been able to
[2:12:53] deal with them according to his word in
[2:12:56] my life the believer's position in
[2:12:59] Christ 1955 the main thing is if we can
[2:13:04] find where God's word belongs in our
[2:13:07] life there's one thing to talk about
[2:13:09] where God's word was in the prophet and
[2:13:11] maybe in our parents maybe in a pastor
[2:13:14] but where is it in our
[2:13:16] life God sets times and time limits and
[2:13:20] then it works all to that time amen many
[2:13:24] of them before the coming of the Lord
[2:13:27] Jesus they was many false things raised
[2:13:30] up and said this is the Messiah and this
[2:13:33] is many false things taken place
[2:13:35] according to the scriptures just before
[2:13:38] the coming of the Lord Jesus and people
[2:13:42] will try to do it within themselves they
[2:13:46] will try to make God's word fit in their
[2:13:50] program
[2:13:51] brothers and sisters don't try and get
[2:13:54] God's word to fit in our program I just
[2:13:57] really want to go there and I really
[2:13:59] want to do this thing and if I I just go
[2:14:02] and and do this thing I know that God
[2:14:04] will bless me for it somewhere along the
[2:14:06] way no make sure that we know God wants
[2:14:08] us to do that
[2:14:11] amen he says but you got it vice versa
[2:14:15] you've got to fit God's program amen and
[2:14:19] that's where I say brothers and sisters
[2:14:21] this was the Revelation for me if we can
[2:14:23] fit God's program then we say Amen to
[2:14:25] the word of God and alls we want to do
[2:14:27] is follow the message of the hour the
[2:14:29] only thing we want to do is follow the
[2:14:30] word of God we don't want to try and
[2:14:32] make excuses and try and fit it to our
[2:14:35] lives and say that I'm just going to
[2:14:37] adapt it and live it this way because of
[2:14:39] that thing that happened somewhere along
[2:14:41] the way no we want to serve him with all
[2:14:44] of our
[2:14:45] hearts you've got to fit God's program
[2:14:49] that we find that's true now now the
[2:14:51] Moses when he was here knowing that God
[2:14:54] had made a promise that he was going to
[2:14:56] deliver the children of Israel why Moses
[2:14:58] knowing that he was called for that
[2:15:00] purpose now when you have a call from
[2:15:02] God that doesn't altogether mean that
[2:15:04] you just jump right out and you're doing
[2:15:06] the will of God you've got to find the
[2:15:09] will of God and the time of God to do
[2:15:12] it so it's very important for us to
[2:15:15] remember to be in the will of God is one
[2:15:18] thing but What's the timing of God
[2:15:22] there's many different ways for him to
[2:15:23] show us one of the biggest ways for him
[2:15:25] to show us if we're waiting on the Lord
[2:15:27] for a certain thing to happen in our
[2:15:28] lives he'll close the door or he'll open
[2:15:32] the
[2:15:32] door and sometimes you have to step
[2:15:35] through that door by faith but if he
[2:15:37] doesn't want you to step through that
[2:15:38] door he'll tell
[2:15:40] you sometimes we need to step through a
[2:15:42] door and it might not actually look like
[2:15:45] it's a blessing it might look like it's
[2:15:46] a curse but I want to say it this way
[2:15:49] take a look at Joseph's life
[2:15:51] he stepped through a door God gave him a
[2:15:53] dream and he told everyone that you're
[2:15:55] going to Bow Down and Worship me and
[2:15:56] they all said you that's not going to
[2:16:00] happen boy you're just a kid we're not
[2:16:03] going to worship you you little dreamer
[2:16:06] forget about it and even his dad rebuked
[2:16:09] him but what happened was he was
[2:16:12] stepping through a door God told him
[2:16:14] something in his life and he did it but
[2:16:16] what happened when he stepped through
[2:16:18] that door he caused hatred he caused a
[2:16:20] problem he he found himself in a pit
[2:16:22] being sold as a
[2:16:24] slave for following the will of God in
[2:16:26] his
[2:16:28] life but he never once gave up on
[2:16:31] God he kept God right there in his heart
[2:16:36] you could only imagine if someone could
[2:16:38] write the Psalms hey what he must have
[2:16:40] cried out from inside that pit the
[2:16:43] thoughts that were inside of his
[2:16:45] heart but even though he was in the will
[2:16:48] of God it wasn't a pretty situation
[2:16:50] sometimes we can find ourselves in a
[2:16:52] very unpleasant situation and still be
[2:16:55] very much in the will of God and I want
[2:16:57] to say this because he wants to actually
[2:17:00] get something out of us amen David had
[2:17:04] adultery in him David was a man after
[2:17:07] God's Own Heart but he had murder in
[2:17:11] him and God allowed both of those things
[2:17:13] to happen to get them out of him and we
[2:17:17] know what was his thing he repented
[2:17:19] quickly
[2:17:21] we have things in our lives God will let
[2:17:22] us go through trials being even in the
[2:17:25] will of his his will to allow that trial
[2:17:28] to come to pass to get that certain
[2:17:30] portion of the old man out of
[2:17:33] us and I say Lord help me because I'm
[2:17:36] not looking forward to trials I'm not
[2:17:38] saying bring on the trial to anyone
[2:17:40] because that is not a pretty thing it's
[2:17:42] not pleasant brothers and sisters trials
[2:17:45] we know are not pleasant but God allows
[2:17:49] them you know talking about this mind
[2:17:51] Philippians chapter 2 maybe turn with me
[2:17:54] as we have a few minutes
[2:17:56] left Philippians chapter
[2:17:59] 2 to start with verse
[2:18:03] five I just love the study of Joseph and
[2:18:05] I apologize if it seemed really broken
[2:18:08] today just wanted to talk maybe a little
[2:18:10] bit about Jo Joseph's lineage and how
[2:18:13] his daddy had some traits in him that
[2:18:16] maybe just weren't really that that that
[2:18:19] above board and we know know that these
[2:18:22] things can linger in our lives and cause
[2:18:25] certain
[2:18:28] circumstances and even though we have
[2:18:29] the circumstance it doesn't mean we're
[2:18:30] out of God's will because if we've got
[2:18:33] his will in our heart if we've got his
[2:18:34] word inside of us then we are very much
[2:18:37] in his
[2:18:38] will here we have Philippians chapter 2
[2:18:41] verse 5 it says let this mind be in you
[2:18:45] which was also in Christ
[2:18:47] Jesus this is where we could just simp
[2:18:51] say this we're talking seventh seal word
[2:18:53] here now amen the complete opening of
[2:18:55] all the seals brothers and sisters who
[2:18:57] being in the form of God thought it not
[2:19:00] robbery to be equal with God but made
[2:19:02] himself of no reputation and took upon
[2:19:05] him the form of a servant and was made
[2:19:08] in the likeness of men this is God this
[2:19:11] is the one who is the the creator of
[2:19:14] Satan the creator of all the Angels the
[2:19:17] creator of the universe the Creator the
[2:19:20] king of Kings the Lord of lords but what
[2:19:23] did he do he set aside his robe and his
[2:19:26] crown and he he jumped into a body of
[2:19:29] Flesh a baby into a womb and actually
[2:19:32] manifest into the Earth and we know that
[2:19:35] Satan he heard that that was going to
[2:19:38] happen but he just couldn't believe that
[2:19:39] was him and it's many times exactly the
[2:19:42] same way with the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:19:45] Satan looks at every one of us he knows
[2:19:46] our past history he knows our parents he
[2:19:48] knows our genetic defaults what we're
[2:19:50] pred exposed to all these different
[2:19:52] things and he says you no way no way you
[2:19:55] could be the Bride of Jesus
[2:19:57] Christ but we just keep getting back up
[2:20:00] again and he doesn't know what to do
[2:20:02] with that that's why Satan will come to
[2:20:04] the place where he just won't know what
[2:20:05] to do with you and it truly is difficult
[2:20:09] for him when we actually are in the will
[2:20:12] of God but verse 9 says wherefore also
[2:20:16] wherefore God also having highly exalted
[2:20:19] him and had given him a name which is
[2:20:21] above every name that at the name of
[2:20:24] Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[2:20:26] heaven and things in Earth and things
[2:20:27] under the Earth that every tongue should
[2:20:29] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[2:20:32] glory of God the Father wherefore my
[2:20:34] beloved as ye have always obeyed not as
[2:20:39] in my presence only but now much more in
[2:20:42] my absence how many more people how many
[2:20:44] people are obeying this word of God even
[2:20:47] in Paul's absence my
[2:20:51] work out your own salvation with fear
[2:20:54] and trembling I want to say this the
[2:20:57] time is short brothers and sisters work
[2:20:59] out your own salvation with fear and
[2:21:02] trembling for it is God which worketh in
[2:21:05] you both to Will and to do of his good
[2:21:10] pleasure if we're willing to submit
[2:21:12] ourselves to him he's the one that's
[2:21:14] going to do it
[2:21:16] all what is the very next
[2:21:18] verse do all things without murmurings
[2:21:21] amen and
[2:21:23] disputings amen do all things without
[2:21:26] murmurings and
[2:21:27] disputings if we're in the will of God
[2:21:30] if we're in the word of God if we've got
[2:21:32] this message of the hour in our lives
[2:21:34] then we're going to take verse 14 and
[2:21:36] we're going to live our lives according
[2:21:37] to that and we're not going to make
[2:21:38] excuses for it and say because of this
[2:21:40] because of that because of the other
[2:21:42] thing we're just going to say oh my Lord
[2:21:44] forgive me I'm sorry I just want to be
[2:21:46] right with you I want to be in line with
[2:21:48] this word of God do all things without
[2:21:50] murmuring ings and
[2:21:52] disputings why so that you may be
[2:21:55] blameless oh my and harmless does that
[2:21:57] mean that we could be
[2:22:00] harmful I want to say yeah we could be
[2:22:03] harmful if we are murmuring and if we
[2:22:06] are
[2:22:07] disputing we could very much be full of
[2:22:10] blame and harmful but if we're doing it
[2:22:13] without murmurings and
[2:22:16] disputings taking it patiently like
[2:22:19] Joseph Maybe maybe he actually screamed
[2:22:21] and yelled and got upset maybe he
[2:22:23] disagreed bitterly with his brother but
[2:22:25] he still shook his hand and said I love
[2:22:27] you brother you're my precious brother
[2:22:29] and we're going to share Heaven we're
[2:22:30] going to be in eternity together we're
[2:22:32] going to eat supper at that marriage
[2:22:33] supper of the Lamb together we're going
[2:22:36] to be together even though we bitterly
[2:22:38] disagree we don't actually bitterly spit
[2:22:42] upon each other and say we bitterly
[2:22:43] disagree and we still believe the
[2:22:44] message of the hour and we never call
[2:22:46] each other and there's no Fellowship no
[2:22:48] maybe we just don't agree or see I eye
[2:22:50] on that one thing but we know more about
[2:22:53] it because we're actually pillars in The
[2:22:55] Community of
[2:22:58] Christ so that we can be harmless and
[2:23:00] blameless what the sons of God without
[2:23:04] rebuke in the midst of a crooked and
[2:23:06] perverse Nation among whom you shine as
[2:23:10] lights in the world you know brothers
[2:23:12] and sisters we got to close my do we
[2:23:16] have to
[2:23:19] close good
[2:23:21] maybe just a couple more
[2:23:23] minutes and I'll call the
[2:23:25] musicians we hear some ministers say
[2:23:28] when you
[2:23:28] say we're going to be closing soon that
[2:23:31] means 20 more
[2:23:32] minutes so I don't know I don't want to
[2:23:34] put a time limit on I don't want to be
[2:23:36] disrespectful of our time either as
[2:23:37] brothers and sisters I I just want to
[2:23:39] say this part and and we'll leave off
[2:23:41] here and we'll get back into it next
[2:23:44] week Lord willing I just think this is
[2:23:47] amazing uh you know what I want to say
[2:23:49] I'll just call the musicians as I say
[2:23:51] these words and we'll pick up from here
[2:23:53] next time you
[2:23:55] know even though we look towards heaven
[2:23:58] we look towards eternity we look towards
[2:24:01] the prize we press towards the mark for
[2:24:04] the prize of the High Calling of God in
[2:24:06] Christ Jesus we look towards that
[2:24:08] Eternal day our position in the throne
[2:24:12] the the Overcomers of Leo to seean
[2:24:14] church age but you know brothers and
[2:24:16] sisters I'm I'm I'm convinced myself
[2:24:19] that it's not the destination because
[2:24:22] our destination is sure it's all about
[2:24:25] the
[2:24:25] journey it's all about the journey it's
[2:24:28] all about dealing with the gas station
[2:24:30] attendant it's all about dealing with
[2:24:32] the person that cuts you off it's all
[2:24:34] about dealing with a harsh boss it's all
[2:24:36] about dealing with the misunderstandings
[2:24:38] between husbands and wives it's all
[2:24:40] about dealing with the misunderstandings
[2:24:42] between brothers and sisters in the
[2:24:43] church it's all about the journey and
[2:24:47] how we conduct ourselves because that
[2:24:49] shows who we really are and you know if
[2:24:52] we want to see the example the example
[2:24:54] that we ought to be looking for if we
[2:24:57] have that mind that we spoke about if
[2:24:59] that mind is in us then we're going to
[2:25:00] live our lives like Jesus Christ the
[2:25:02] only person that's really going to get
[2:25:04] us upset are the most religious ones
[2:25:07] that's the only thing that's going to
[2:25:08] get us just a little bit worked up but
[2:25:10] everything else we've got it all under
[2:25:11] control man we could be sleeping in the
[2:25:13] back of the boat and there'll be just
[2:25:14] about
[2:25:15] sinking some people will say well
[2:25:17] brother Barry he was in the back of the
[2:25:19] boat and he had a great great healing
[2:25:20] campaign and we know the prophet of God
[2:25:23] said that 20 minutes of anointed
[2:25:24] preaching is the same as eight hours of
[2:25:26] manual labor which I truly believe if
[2:25:29] you ever experience it Mondays are kind
[2:25:31] of rough days sometimes but you know
[2:25:34] Jesus was God and truly he was tired but
[2:25:38] I don't think he was fussed and I think
[2:25:40] that was a situation that he was fully
[2:25:41] aware of in the back of the boat and the
[2:25:44] word of God says that he was asleep but
[2:25:46] he had no fear if we have his mind
[2:25:49] inside of us Brothers and sisters I
[2:25:50] think that's the biggest curse of the
[2:25:52] devil in this day is that we have fear
[2:25:55] Don't Be Afraid perfect love casts out
[2:25:58] all fear we know that's in Corinthians
[2:26:00] brothers and sisters Don't Be Afraid
[2:26:02] cast out fear with the love of Jesus
[2:26:05] Christ with that love that is inside of
[2:26:07] us when we have his mind I feel like I
[2:26:10] could just preach another hour really
[2:26:12] easily and I don't want to keep us today
[2:26:14] I know we have commitments and jobs and
[2:26:17] I just certainly appreciate each and
[2:26:18] every one be stand with me as we close
[2:26:22] you know brothers and sisters it's all
[2:26:23] about how we conduct ourselves every
[2:26:25] step of the way it's about the journey
[2:26:27] and it's about attracting people to
[2:26:29] Christ showing people that we serve a
[2:26:31] living God not that we we are just full
[2:26:34] of form and and dead works and we just
[2:26:36] come to church and we just go home and
[2:26:38] we don't have a God in our life that's
[2:26:40] alive and well it's actually a living
[2:26:43] God that we serve and what happens is it
[2:26:46] attracts people to Christ you you've
[2:26:48] heard the saying you get more be
[2:26:50] with honey if you try and actually show
[2:26:54] bitterness to people around bit people
[2:26:56] see bitterness and and and and and and
[2:26:58] and and and what happens is you detract
[2:27:01] people people don't want to be around
[2:27:02] you but boy when you're sweet people
[2:27:05] love to come around you and that's what
[2:27:07] that saying is about you get more bees
[2:27:09] with honey when you're sweet and you're
[2:27:11] lovely you attract people and people
[2:27:14] want to know why you're sweet why you
[2:27:16] conduct yourself with joy even in the
[2:27:19] midst of a trial who does that but
[2:27:22] someone who has that mind which was also
[2:27:24] in Christ Jesus God bless you today
[2:27:26] let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[2:27:30] we certainly love you and we thank you
[2:27:32] for your word because we know it's your
[2:27:34] will and Lord as we go forwards I pray
