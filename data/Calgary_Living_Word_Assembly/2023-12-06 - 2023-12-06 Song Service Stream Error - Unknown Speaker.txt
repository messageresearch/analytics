testimony is a Thanksgiving I had this friend of mine and a colleague so she told me I had that she will be going for a surgery on November 1 year that I will be with her so I cancelled my shift so I was with her at sou campus the sge was successful so when we came back to her house in the night at midnight Friday uh Thursday Friday night there was a complication was so serious meanwhile I prayed to God I said God I don't know why this a friend or a colleague asked me to come and stay with her but you know but we sh with God may you take control and help her to come out from this surgery it's not a small surgery so I called the ambulance that night from her house that was around 2: a.m. so they came we took her back to a hospital so I was there till Friday morning I came back she wasn't she didn't even know where she was but when she woke up she told me what to bring for her for her I went back to her house and before then she gave me two present she said she never know that this is my Christmas present so that morning that Friday morning my P I put it in that bag she gave me with a present so with all the things I was carrying back to the hospital when I was entering the elevator maybe it was it dropped I didn't see it and the throughout the Friday I didn't have any cost to look for my P or buy anything I now remember that I have I have promised God that this Sunday I'm going to give a test uh a Thanksgiving I didn't prepare anything so I was looking for my post I went back to the hospital I asked she said I should tell the Securities but then she has recovered a little bit I asked all the Securities they said they didn't see any p i was devastated I don't have my card I don't have anything what will I do and I had to buy little things for my Thanksgiving so I called my bank they said I should go to police station that was uh it was late that Friday that was around 5: before 5:30 I went to police station theyve all closed so I couldn't meet anybody so on Saturday morning I went already I called my bank they said I should report to the police station because if I don't report there was no there's no evidence that shows that I lost my uh items so I went to the police station they gave me a written paper so I went to the bank I told them so I was able to take some cash for what I wanted to do that Saturday so we went back I went back to the hospital I checked on her I came back I I still remember oh I have to get some items and I'm not going to postpone the this uh Thanksgiving I have scheduled I didn't prepare very well so by the grace of God it went well I just want to thank the church for accepting my little token secondly on Monday morning I was just Disturbed I said anyway God the only thing I prayed I said God if this P we lost and my friend is alive let let it be so I took it like that and on THS Monday morning I went to her apartment I met a cleaner I said please on Friday morning I lost a bag that had my post do you see it he said wait wait wait wait she he took me to the technician that uh is in charge of the apartment he said this is the person that has that post he told I told and he said he bought it just like that everything was intact nothing missed so I didn't know what to say it was just like a miracle to me so I said God is it you I couldn't just believe it even I have a little cash inside it everything was
