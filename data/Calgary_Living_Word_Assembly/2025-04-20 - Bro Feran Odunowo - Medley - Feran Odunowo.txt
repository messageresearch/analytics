========================================

Let's be related to be in the house of the Lord. Just going to sing a medley this morning. There are songs that you [Music] know. Jesus paid it all. To him I [Music] owe. Sin had left a crimson stain, but he washed me white as snow. [Music] Oh, precious is the flow that makes me white as snow. No other, no other found I know. Oh, nothing but the blood of [Music] Jesus. For it reaches to the highest [Music] mountain and it flows to the lowest valley. Oh, it's the blood gives me strength from day to day. It will never never lose its power. And it reaches to the highest mountain. And that blood it flows to the lowest valley. [Music] Oh, the blood that gives me strength from today. It will never It will never lose. It will never never lose. It will never never lose its power. And in Christ alone my hope is found. He is my light, my [Laughter] strength, my son. This corner stone, this solid ground firm through the fences drought and storm. What heights of love, what deaths of peace when fears are tears, when strivings cease. is my comforter. Who is it to you? Is my all in all here in the love of Christ I [Music] stand in Christ alone. He took on [Music] confession fullness of God in hell. Last [Music] B. This gift of love and rightuousness scorned by the ones he came to save. Seal on that cross as Jesus died. The wrath of God was satisfied for every sin on him was laid. Now here in the death of Christ I believe. [Music] Where in the ground his body lay light of the world by darkness messain oh then busting forth in glorious day up from the grave he rose again and has he stands in victory since cause has lost its grip on me. Hallelujah. For I am his and is mine. Not with the precious blood of Christ. No guilt in life, no fear in death. This is the power of Christ in me. From life's first crime to final breath, Jesus commands my death in me. So no power of hell. No scheme of man can ever block me from a stand till he returns to take me home. Here in the power of Christ I'll stand. And as he stands in victory, sins cast as lost its grip on me. For I am his and is [Music] mine. Hearing the death of Christ I'll leave. Oh, thank you Jesus. Amen. [Applause] God bless you all.
