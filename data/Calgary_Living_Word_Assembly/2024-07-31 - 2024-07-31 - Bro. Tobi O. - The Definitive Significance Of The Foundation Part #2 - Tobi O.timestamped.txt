[1:01:15] Matthew chapter 7 I have two portions of
[1:01:18] scripture to read this
[1:01:19] morning Matthew 7:2
[1:01:23] 24-29 and then we'll go all the way back
[1:01:26] to the Book of
[1:01:29] Genesis Matthew 7 from verse
[1:01:33] 24 the Lord Jesus was speaking
[1:01:37] here therefore whosoever heareth the
[1:01:40] sayings of mine and dth them will I
[1:01:42] liken him I will liken him unto a wise
[1:01:46] men which built his house upon a rock
[1:01:50] and the rain descended and the floods
[1:01:52] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[1:01:55] the that house and it fell not for it
[1:01:59] was founded upon a
[1:02:01] rock and everyone that heareth the
[1:02:03] sayings of mine and dth them not shall
[1:02:05] be likened unto a foolish man which
[1:02:07] built his house upon the sand and the
[1:02:10] rain descended and the floods came and
[1:02:13] the winds
[1:02:14] blew and beat upon the house and it fell
[1:02:19] and great was the fall of it and it came
[1:02:22] to pass when Jesus had ended the sayings
[1:02:25] the people were were astonished at his
[1:02:28] Doctrine for he taught them as one
[1:02:31] having Authority and not as the scribes
[1:02:34] amen amen let's fle all the way back to
[1:02:37] the Book of Genesis chapter
[1:02:42] 24 I'll just take two verses from there
[1:02:45] and this is the story
[1:02:48] of the models servants alaza being sent
[1:02:53] by Abraham to go fetch a wife
[1:02:57] rising and I just want
[1:03:00] to read his prayer
[1:03:03] here and he said oh Lord God of my
[1:03:06] master Abraham I pray thee send me good
[1:03:09] speed this day and sure kindness unto my
[1:03:13] master Abraham behold I stand Here by
[1:03:16] The Well of water and the daughters of
[1:03:18] the men of the City come out to draw
[1:03:21] water and let it come to pass that the
[1:03:23] damel to whom I shall say
[1:03:26] let down thy pacher I pray thee that I
[1:03:29] may drink and she shall say drink and I
[1:03:32] will give thy camels drink also let the
[1:03:36] same be she that thou has appointed for
[1:03:38] thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I
[1:03:41] know that thou has shown kindness unto
[1:03:45] my master am let's just have a word of
[1:03:47] prayer there father we are grateful for
[1:03:51] the opportunity and the desire to come
[1:03:53] to your
[1:03:54] house we want to hear from you amen we
[1:03:58] know you are here already you know the
[1:04:01] thoughts of our hearts you know the
[1:04:02] intents of our hearts you know the needs
[1:04:05] in our lives you know the needs down the
[1:04:07] road that we do not know we want you
[1:04:10] Lord Jesus to address each and every one
[1:04:12] of those needs we want you to be the one
[1:04:15] speaking this morning we want your your
[1:04:17] presence to be felt we want you to take
[1:04:20] control at the end of the service we
[1:04:22] want to look back and be careful to
[1:04:25] bring you the thanks and Praises because
[1:04:28] we would have been able to testify at
[1:04:30] that time Lord that Lord we've been in
[1:04:32] your presence amen we give you thanks
[1:04:34] and praise for in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:04:37] pray amen you may please have your
[1:04:42] seat as we know our pastor is traveling
[1:04:46] with
[1:04:47] both many of the class and
[1:04:50] family um let's just remember them in
[1:04:52] prayer that the Lord will be with them
[1:04:54] are you happy to be in church this
[1:04:56] morning I like the fact that our pastor
[1:04:59] always ask that and you happy to be in
[1:05:02] church and I know the last time we were
[1:05:04] speaking I talked about
[1:05:06] husbands asking their wives if they are
[1:05:09] happy so it's good to hear the pastor
[1:05:11] also ask the church all the time if they
[1:05:14] are
[1:05:15] happy so I want to continue the thought
[1:05:18] this morning that uh we took I can't
[1:05:22] believe it's almost a month ago it was
[1:05:24] on the 7th of July we talked about the
[1:05:27] definitive
[1:05:29] significance of the
[1:05:32] foundation and the subject was the
[1:05:34] foundation of
[1:05:36] marriage and just before I do a quick
[1:05:39] recap just realizing that some people
[1:05:41] here uh today were not here um last
[1:05:44] month when we did the part one of this
[1:05:48] um you know there's this scripture where
[1:05:51] brother Paul wrote to Timothy and it was
[1:05:54] saying that all scripture is given by
[1:05:57] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[1:06:01] Doctrine for reprove reprove means blame
[1:06:05] or
[1:06:06] disapproval for
[1:06:08] correction for
[1:06:10] instruction in
[1:06:12] righteousness and anytime we come to
[1:06:14] church that that is that is how the word
[1:06:17] is presented in one of those ways the
[1:06:19] word is presented to us and just point
[1:06:21] out that this morning God is bringing us
[1:06:25] certain
[1:06:26] instructions especially young people but
[1:06:29] I apply to some of us that are married
[1:06:31] as well but it's instructing
[1:06:35] Us in righteousness that's right amen
[1:06:39] righteousness means right standing with
[1:06:42] God that's right so when we are talking
[1:06:44] about these things God is coming to say
[1:06:47] if you want to be right with me that's
[1:06:50] right you have to follow this
[1:06:53] instructions amen and in other aspects
[1:06:56] of our lives there are instructions and
[1:06:58] everything like we said the last time if
[1:07:00] you buy a product if you buy an
[1:07:02] appliance there are instructions on how
[1:07:04] to set it up there are instructions on
[1:07:06] how to use it if you don't follow the
[1:07:09] instructions you're going to blow it up
[1:07:11] that's right so let us keep that in mind
[1:07:15] this morning we read the scripture you
[1:07:18] know where Jesus Christ was talking
[1:07:21] about describing someone that listens to
[1:07:25] his word and do it it versus someone
[1:07:28] that listens and does not do
[1:07:31] it and Jesus was saying when you listen
[1:07:34] to the word and do it you are like a man
[1:07:37] that built his house upon the rock I was
[1:07:39] trying to put that illustration there
[1:07:41] that would be a nice place to
[1:07:44] leave but you know that when a house is
[1:07:47] built upon the
[1:07:48] rock and The Rock itself standing you
[1:07:52] know we have rocks you know we have
[1:07:54] mountains here in in in Canada in Cal
[1:07:57] around Calgary that have been there for
[1:07:59] years and years and
[1:08:01] years compared to the sand you have by
[1:08:05] the
[1:08:06] shore that washes away very quickly so
[1:08:11] Jesus says if you listen to what I say
[1:08:14] and you go ahead to do it your house
[1:08:17] will not crash your house will
[1:08:21] stand so we talked about that we also
[1:08:24] kind of talked about a man in the
[1:08:27] scriptures named
[1:08:30] lot because we're trying to say why do
[1:08:32] we need to talk about those things why
[1:08:34] do we not need to talk about the
[1:08:35] foundation of marriage why do we need to
[1:08:37] talk about the things that our young
[1:08:39] ones need to know some of them might
[1:08:41] know they're too young to know those
[1:08:42] things but if they can keep it in their
[1:08:44] back pockets till the time uh comes when
[1:08:47] they need it but there's no age that is
[1:08:49] too young as long as they can comprehend
[1:08:52] to know certain instructions about the
[1:08:53] word of God and we said that lot lot
[1:08:58] remember lot was the nephew of Abraham
[1:09:01] he got to a time where the earthmen of
[1:09:04] lot and the earthmen of Abraham were
[1:09:05] having
[1:09:06] conflict and then Abraham in his
[1:09:10] wisdom went to lot and said you know
[1:09:13] what let's not have conflict we're
[1:09:15] brothers will you just go one way and
[1:09:19] I'll decide to go the other way so there
[1:09:21] was a separation we know it was in God's
[1:09:23] plan but the point I'm trying to make is
[1:09:25] when lot left the Bible said that he
[1:09:28] pitched his tent towards
[1:09:32] Sodom but when the destruction of Sodom
[1:09:34] and gomorra will happen lot was in
[1:09:39] Sodom now we
[1:09:41] realize that the Bible also told us that
[1:09:45] lot was a righteous man and the SCS and
[1:09:49] the things that were happening in Sodom
[1:09:52] they were vexing his righteous Soul
[1:09:54] that's right
[1:09:56] that's right so he was a righteous man
[1:09:58] but he had exposed his
[1:10:00] family to a place where they had been
[1:10:03] corrupted by the world that's right amen
[1:10:06] why did his wife turn to a pillar of
[1:10:09] salt Sodom was in our heart she was
[1:10:12] leading leaving Sodom but Sodom was not
[1:10:15] leaving her because Sodom was in her
[1:10:18] heart she couldn't stand the sight of
[1:10:21] the destruction she couldn't stand the
[1:10:23] thought of the fact that all the things
[1:10:25] that she has enjoyed in Sodom was been
[1:10:28] destroyed and she failed to follow the
[1:10:31] instruction of the angels that said keep
[1:10:34] going and don't look
[1:10:37] back so I might be a righteous father
[1:10:41] but if I'm not conscious of the world
[1:10:43] I'm living
[1:10:44] in
[1:10:46] amen my children could be influenced by
[1:10:50] the things of the
[1:10:52] world the daughters of lot committed
[1:10:55] what is called
[1:10:57] incest by having children from their
[1:10:59] father that's right ever wondered where
[1:11:01] they learned that from was from
[1:11:08] Sodom we also talked about the fact that
[1:11:11] there were four just for us to remember
[1:11:15] I'm looking at this side I could have
[1:11:16] asked the brothers but I Won't temporize
[1:11:18] Anyone this
[1:11:19] morning but we talked about four pillars
[1:11:23] four things to consider four I think I
[1:11:25] called
[1:11:26] them might have called them
[1:11:30] um criteria I can't remember but four
[1:11:34] main maturity levels was what I said
[1:11:37] that is required before we think about
[1:11:40] marriage and we talked about physical
[1:11:43] maturity emotional
[1:11:47] maturity which other one fincial
[1:11:49] material maturity and then we talk about
[1:11:52] spiritual
[1:11:53] maturity and I don't want to go into the
[1:11:55] details but what we try to show is that
[1:11:58] when God who is the author of marriage
[1:12:02] instituted marriage in the Garden of
[1:12:05] Eden those were the things that God
[1:12:07] ensured was in place ever before he took
[1:12:11] the woman out of the man so Adam um Adam
[1:12:16] was created a mature man he had physical
[1:12:21] maturity Adam was a son of God he had
[1:12:26] spiritual maturity but of of course he
[1:12:29] also had emotional maturity because he
[1:12:31] knew how to deal with his wife when he
[1:12:32] saw the first time he gave her a good
[1:12:35] name he said this is the bone of my bone
[1:12:37] and the Flesh of My Flesh and she she
[1:12:40] shall be identified who she
[1:12:43] was so we talked about all of that we
[1:12:45] give examples from Brother braham's
[1:12:48] stories you know that he told his
[1:12:51] experiences we gave you know scriptural
[1:12:54] reference as well why those things were
[1:12:57] important so after the service that day
[1:13:00] remember we had a lot of visitors um we
[1:13:03] also had um my wife's
[1:13:05] cousins and and their aunts that been
[1:13:07] here they're not in the message but
[1:13:10] right after you know he met me and one
[1:13:13] of one of uh my wife's cousins met me
[1:13:15] and said oh uncle that was that that was
[1:13:17] a wonderful service and I learned a lot
[1:13:20] and they said but I have a question how
[1:13:22] do you know the right person
[1:13:26] so I said well that's that is the part
[1:13:29] two of this message I know he's not here
[1:13:33] um but we want to talk this
[1:13:35] morning about making the
[1:13:39] choice brother Braham told us in
[1:13:41] choosing of a bride he said there is an
[1:13:45] unwritten law Among Us of
[1:13:49] choosing but Braham gave examples of the
[1:13:51] choices we'll make and one of the things
[1:13:54] brother Braham said said he talked about
[1:13:56] choosing the church he talks about you
[1:13:58] know the choices we make in life but
[1:14:00] when it came to certain choices brother
[1:14:02] the Braham said that it could determine
[1:14:04] your Eternal
[1:14:08] destination now brother Braham said I
[1:14:10] think it's the first quote here so
[1:14:11] Brothers if you can bring it up he said
[1:14:14] now it's a serious thing when we go to
[1:14:17] choosing a wife a man for the vows here
[1:14:22] is until death do we
[1:14:25] part let's also bring a reminder that
[1:14:28] brother brah says The Vow marries you we
[1:14:30] talked about that right that's how we
[1:14:33] should keep it and you take that vow
[1:14:36] before God that only death will separate
[1:14:39] you and I think we should a man in his
[1:14:43] right man in his right mind that's
[1:14:46] planning a future that he should choose
[1:14:48] that wife very careful be careful what
[1:14:52] you're doing and a woman choosing a
[1:14:54] husband or accepting the choice of a
[1:14:57] husband should be real careful what
[1:15:00] she's doing and especially in these days
[1:15:05] so if brother Braham was saying in 1965
[1:15:08] that it was important in those days I
[1:15:11] wonder how important it is
[1:15:14] today a man should think and pray before
[1:15:20] he chooses a wife I had a preacher say
[1:15:24] people do it in the
[1:15:26] reverse right they
[1:15:29] choose then they pray and say God
[1:15:32] why and then they
[1:15:34] think but that's not how brother Braham
[1:15:37] said we should do it and I think today
[1:15:39] so many diverse cases now that we we
[1:15:43] lead the world in America in divorced
[1:15:46] cases we Le the rest of the world
[1:15:48] there's more divorces here than anywhere
[1:15:52] else this nation and supposed to be and
[1:15:55] thought of a Christian Nation what a
[1:15:57] reproach I divorce
[1:15:59] courts I think the reason of it is
[1:16:02] because that men has got away from God
[1:16:05] and women has got away from
[1:16:09] God and we find that if a man
[1:16:12] prayed and a woman prayed over the
[1:16:15] matter not just to look at a pretty set
[1:16:19] of eyes or big strong shoulders or such
[1:16:23] as that or some other wall Bly
[1:16:26] affection but would look first to God
[1:16:29] and say God is this your
[1:16:34] plan amen so this morning we are going
[1:16:36] to know what the plan of God is Amen
[1:16:40] brother Ram said don't look at a pretty
[1:16:41] set of
[1:16:43] eyes now men are moved by what they
[1:16:47] see women are moved by what they
[1:16:51] hear right we'll get a little bit into
[1:16:53] it
[1:16:55] but it is natural for a man to be moved
[1:16:59] by what he sees as you get to a certain
[1:17:03] age there will be a definition of beauty
[1:17:07] when it comes to a woman and let me also
[1:17:10] say that that is also defined by the
[1:17:13] trains that is in the world at that time
[1:17:16] that's right amen let me explain it a
[1:17:20] little bit more there was a time when it
[1:17:21] was trendy that the most beautiful woman
[1:17:25] the most you
[1:17:27] know I don't want to use the wrong word
[1:17:30] but most healthy looking women let me
[1:17:33] put it that
[1:17:35] way and then it got to another point
[1:17:38] where the skinny women were the most
[1:17:40] appealing because of how holywood
[1:17:43] presented
[1:17:45] it I'm making that point to let us know
[1:17:48] brothers that what you define as Beauty
[1:17:52] in the outward it's most a worldly
[1:17:56] definition of what beautiful is that's
[1:17:58] right amen but as brother Braham will
[1:18:00] tell us and as the wisest king that's
[1:18:04] right the wisest man that ever lived
[1:18:06] Solomon told us in Proverbs said beauty
[1:18:09] is
[1:18:12] deceitful it's
[1:18:14] vain right but a woman that fearth the
[1:18:17] Lord she shall be praised
[1:18:23] amen the quote brother Braham says but
[1:18:27] you know you have to
[1:18:30] plan look Pray when you're choosing for
[1:18:35] we see this by the Word of Promise she
[1:18:37] the bride that a man will choose is
[1:18:40] going to reflect his
[1:18:43] character it reflects what's in him
[1:18:46] that's true many times we complain about
[1:18:48] our wives in certain ways oh that's
[1:18:51] exactly who you
[1:18:53] are for the said you marry what you
[1:18:58] are but many times we don't see
[1:19:00] ourselves because we don't take time to
[1:19:02] look
[1:19:07] inwards let's now you know answer the
[1:19:09] question what is the plan of
[1:19:12] God now the first thing that the Braham
[1:19:15] says here inerting of God is that the
[1:19:18] quot we on yeah the next one and then he
[1:19:21] was talking about Ahab and then in his
[1:19:24] wedding is instead of marrying among his
[1:19:25] own people he went over and married a
[1:19:27] sinner and idolator worship of Idols he
[1:19:30] married Jezebel and she was not a
[1:19:32] Believer but BR now says that no
[1:19:34] believer should ever marry an unbeliever
[1:19:37] under no
[1:19:38] circumstances should always marry
[1:19:41] Believers I know that is a very common
[1:19:44] quote but I want to twist it a little
[1:19:46] bit this morning because when we say
[1:19:49] that Believers should not marry
[1:19:50] unbelievers we think about people
[1:19:53] outside of the church
[1:19:55] church but brother BR also made us to
[1:19:57] know that there are three kinds of
[1:19:59] Believers Amen in the church
[1:20:02] amen the major problem we are having
[1:20:05] today in the message is not mostly
[1:20:08] message people going out like when I
[1:20:10] talk about problems I'm talking about
[1:20:11] marital problems is not just people
[1:20:14] going out to marry from outside of the
[1:20:16] message it's people that have grown up
[1:20:18] in the message getting married to
[1:20:21] themselves having not been converted
[1:20:25] that's right Amen to be
[1:20:28] Believers and then they put someone in
[1:20:32] trouble I've heard of
[1:20:34] cases where someone I was hearing the
[1:20:37] story that the brother was telling of
[1:20:40] someone that a brother that came to his
[1:20:44] church because he was interested in the
[1:20:45] sister the sister had had a terrible you
[1:20:49] know um experience in life where she had
[1:20:52] left the church she had gone to mess
[1:20:54] herself up and she had come back to
[1:20:56] repent and the church had forgiven her
[1:20:59] but she was you know someone that had
[1:21:01] gone through that experience would be
[1:21:02] very tender at it and this brother had
[1:21:04] come you know to the states and started
[1:21:06] to you know have interest in this sister
[1:21:10] and was going to
[1:21:12] visit
[1:21:14] and the pastor got to know that this
[1:21:17] brother was coming because of the sister
[1:21:19] so he called that brother's Pastor the
[1:21:21] church the brother was going to and had
[1:21:24] a ation and the brother said oh the best
[1:21:26] I know the Pastor said the best I know
[1:21:28] this is a good brother you know and
[1:21:30] stuff like that and he said okay that's
[1:21:34] good you know let him come and this
[1:21:36] brother came you know driving the best
[1:21:40] vehicle dressed right dressed nice and
[1:21:42] this Pastor said those things don't move
[1:21:44] me right you might be dressed but I want
[1:21:47] to see your character that's right amen
[1:21:49] long story short they found out that
[1:21:51] this brother was married to someone else
[1:21:54] outside of the country but only came to
[1:21:59] America or was only interested in this
[1:22:01] sister because he wanted to find a way
[1:22:04] to remain in America regularize his
[1:22:07] people become a citizen so he was
[1:22:08] looking for a citizen to get married to
[1:22:10] but had been married to someone else
[1:22:13] before in the
[1:22:17] message so when brother Braham said
[1:22:19] under no
[1:22:20] circumstance should a Believer marry an
[1:22:23] unbeliever that's right let us switch
[1:22:25] that inwards that's right amen because a
[1:22:29] lot of young people have the idea that
[1:22:31] oh once they in the message they are
[1:22:34] believers no no brother Braham said you
[1:22:38] are not you cannot join that body that's
[1:22:42] right you've got to be born into that
[1:22:46] body as you're going to see part of what
[1:22:48] to watch out for you've got to watch out
[1:22:51] for that person's character when it
[1:22:54] comes to his Christian character not
[1:22:56] just being a member of the church amen
[1:22:59] that's right now what was the reason and
[1:23:02] we know there are so many places in the
[1:23:04] scripture where you know of
[1:23:07] course God frowned at any
[1:23:12] intermingling that's right when it came
[1:23:14] to
[1:23:15] marriage and the first time you will see
[1:23:18] that was in the life of the sons of
[1:23:23] Jacob you know the sons of
[1:23:25] Jacob when Jacob and his family had
[1:23:28] moved to the land of
[1:23:30] Canaan they had a sister called Dina
[1:23:33] that's right now the Bible told us that
[1:23:37] Dina left the company of her family
[1:23:40] that's right went out to mingle with the
[1:23:44] daughters of the city that's right and
[1:23:47] then the son of the king saw her and
[1:23:52] defiled her that's right
[1:23:57] and then when the brothers found
[1:24:00] out and went to them where will you do
[1:24:03] this the Bible said that they had rought
[1:24:06] fully in
[1:24:08] Israel because they had done that which
[1:24:11] should not be done now this young man
[1:24:14] came and she came came and said my
[1:24:16] intention is to marry your
[1:24:20] sister but the brothers knew that this
[1:24:22] is an Abomination that's right we cannot
[1:24:25] be married to the
[1:24:28] uncircumcised and because of that what
[1:24:31] did these brothers do they plotted and
[1:24:34] ensure that they destroyed all the men
[1:24:36] in that City that's
[1:24:38] right amen now in the time of the
[1:24:43] Journey of the children of
[1:24:45] Israel as God started to Brothers if you
[1:24:49] can pull up numbers
[1:24:52] 27 it's a Sunday school class this
[1:24:54] morning amen hallelujah so if you're not
[1:24:56] jumping and saying amen it's okay as
[1:24:59] long as you're soaking it in
[1:25:03] amen you know brother Marvin is smiling
[1:25:06] because he's also a teacher and he knows
[1:25:09] that when we
[1:25:11] teach we want the class to be
[1:25:15] attentive when an evangelist comes
[1:25:18] around and brings down the fire we want
[1:25:21] to be on our feet
[1:25:25] so there was let's just look at this
[1:25:27] story here the Bible said then came the
[1:25:30] daughters of zel ofad just remember here
[1:25:35] that God was already telling Moses what
[1:25:39] the inheritance of the tribes will be
[1:25:41] when they get to the promised land right
[1:25:44] so they were they were getting their
[1:25:47] allocation we can call it their location
[1:25:49] of their inheritance the land where
[1:25:51] they're going to dwell in the promised
[1:25:53] land God has shown Moses the map and he
[1:25:55] was saying this tribe will be here that
[1:25:57] tribe will be here now then came the
[1:25:59] daughters of zelop the son of ephra the
[1:26:03] son of Gilead the son of Makai the son
[1:26:05] of manasse of the families of manasse
[1:26:08] the son of Joseph and these are the
[1:26:10] names of his daughters Mala Noah and
[1:26:13] hogler and milka and teaser teer and
[1:26:19] they stood before Moses and before
[1:26:20] leazar the priest and before the princes
[1:26:22] of all the congregation by the door of
[1:26:24] the Tabernacle of the congregation
[1:26:26] saying our father died in the wilderness
[1:26:29] and was not in the company of them that
[1:26:32] gather themselves together against the
[1:26:34] Lord in the company of Kora but died in
[1:26:37] his own sin and had no
[1:26:39] Sons why should the name of her father
[1:26:42] be dwn away from among this family
[1:26:45] because he had no son
[1:26:47] remember inheritance at that time used
[1:26:50] to go to the sons not the daughters
[1:26:52] that's right so this man did not have
[1:26:54] have any sons you only had daughters so
[1:26:56] the daughters came to say you're giv
[1:26:58] inheritance you're giv inheritance out a
[1:27:01] father is going to get his own
[1:27:02] inheritance you know he should have
[1:27:04] gotten his own inheritance if he was
[1:27:05] alive but now he's dead and we being
[1:27:08] girls we are not going to get any
[1:27:11] inheritance they came to the prophet to
[1:27:14] ask the
[1:27:15] question verse 5 and Moses brought their
[1:27:17] Coss before the Lord so the prophet
[1:27:21] always goes back to God to clarify
[1:27:23] because that's where he's getting
[1:27:24] instructions
[1:27:26] from and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:27:29] saying the daughters of zelophehad speak
[1:27:32] right Thou shalt surely give them a
[1:27:35] possession of inheritance among their
[1:27:37] father's Brethren and thou shalt cause
[1:27:39] the inheritance of their father to pass
[1:27:41] onto
[1:27:42] them so why was God doing this each of
[1:27:46] the tribes had their own inheritance and
[1:27:49] this is a study on his own but we're not
[1:27:50] going to get into it but you can tie all
[1:27:53] of this to
[1:27:55] the law of the kingsman
[1:27:58] Redeemer right God in his wisdom and I
[1:28:02] was saying this to the family we've been
[1:28:04] talking about the shadows and the
[1:28:07] reality all of the things we see in the
[1:28:09] Old Testament were not just
[1:28:12] stories they were Shadows of things to
[1:28:14] come that's right now the shadow gives
[1:28:17] you an idea of the
[1:28:19] reality the shadow doesn't get into the
[1:28:22] details if you see my sh Shadow you can
[1:28:25] tell that okay this is probably a man
[1:28:28] but you might not be able to tell if I
[1:28:29] was wearing a suit or the color of suit
[1:28:31] I was wearing you might be able to tell
[1:28:33] I was wearing a suit but you might not
[1:28:34] be able to tell the color you might
[1:28:35] might be able to see that I have a frame
[1:28:38] you know on that I'm wearing on my face
[1:28:40] so it could be glasses you might not be
[1:28:42] able to tell if it's sunglasses or
[1:28:44] reading glasses but when you see me you
[1:28:48] have a better idea of the Shadow that's
[1:28:51] right you see the reasing in the Shadow
[1:28:54] you're able to say oh that is why I saw
[1:28:56] oh this is what this meant okay yeah
[1:28:59] it's frames but actually oh it's not
[1:29:01] just frames it's actually a reading
[1:29:03] glasses so now that we are in the new we
[1:29:06] the reality when we go back to the Old
[1:29:08] Testament we can see more meaning in the
[1:29:11] Old Testament because the shadow has now
[1:29:13] become reality amen so this ladies came
[1:29:17] to
[1:29:18] Moses their father was dead inheritance
[1:29:21] was been handed over and they like the
[1:29:23] name of our father would you know not
[1:29:26] survive remember when we're growing up
[1:29:28] if you were the first to buy a land on
[1:29:30] the street you named the street after
[1:29:32] yourself you know you need to get
[1:29:34] permission but back in Nigeria you have
[1:29:36] people whose the street that they leave
[1:29:39] is their last name Bears the name of
[1:29:42] their last name um Bears yeah their last
[1:29:44] name as as the name of the street so the
[1:29:46] daughters were worried that if we don't
[1:29:49] get inheritance then the name of our
[1:29:50] father will be dead and they came to
[1:29:53] Moses and God said they are speaking the
[1:29:55] right thing give them that
[1:29:58] inheritance now let's flip over to
[1:30:01] numbers 36 what are we talking about why
[1:30:04] did he say we have to marry in the
[1:30:08] fold amen why should marriage not be
[1:30:13] intermingled why did God you know get
[1:30:17] really obset with Ahab for marrying
[1:30:22] Jezebel chapter 36 of numbers and the
[1:30:25] chief fathers of the families of the
[1:30:27] children of Gilead the son of ma the son
[1:30:30] of manace of the families of the sons of
[1:30:32] Joseph came near and spake before Moses
[1:30:35] and before the princes and chief fathers
[1:30:37] of the children of Israel and they said
[1:30:39] the Lord commanded my Lord to give the
[1:30:41] land for an inheritance by Lord to the
[1:30:43] children of Israel and my Lord was
[1:30:46] commanded by the Lord to give the
[1:30:47] inheritance of zelop Fahad our brother
[1:30:50] unto his daughters and if they be
[1:30:53] married to any of the sons of the other
[1:30:55] tribes of the children of
[1:30:57] Israel then shall their inheritance be
[1:31:00] taken from the inheritance of our
[1:31:03] fathers and shall be put to the
[1:31:05] inheritance of the tribe where unto they
[1:31:07] are received so shall it be taken from
[1:31:10] the lot of our inheritance so what's
[1:31:13] going on here God has said give the
[1:31:15] daughters now at that time when a woman
[1:31:20] marries into another
[1:31:22] family is still the same now she becomes
[1:31:26] a member of that family that's right so
[1:31:28] whatever possession she has is
[1:31:31] transferred to that
[1:31:33] family now if these women are just
[1:31:36] allowed to marry from any any tribe then
[1:31:40] the map that God gave Moses will be
[1:31:42] disrupted that's right amen because you
[1:31:45] are now going to have let's say the
[1:31:47] tribe of Dan is where they married from
[1:31:50] then the tribe of Dan is going to own
[1:31:52] part of the inheritance
[1:31:54] of the tribe of manasse that's right and
[1:31:56] that's not God's
[1:31:58] intention so this people brought a very
[1:32:01] important message to Moses it was a good
[1:32:07] concern verse four says and when the
[1:32:10] Jubilee of the children of Israel shall
[1:32:11] be then shall The Inheritance be put
[1:32:13] unto the inheritance of the tribe where
[1:32:15] unto they are received so shall The
[1:32:17] Inheritance be taken away from the
[1:32:19] inheritance of the tribe of our fathers
[1:32:21] and Moses commanded the children of
[1:32:23] Israel according to the word of the Lord
[1:32:24] saying the tribe of the sons of Joseph
[1:32:27] ha said well this is the thing which the
[1:32:31] Lord do command concerning the daughters
[1:32:32] of zad saying let them marry to whom
[1:32:37] they think best only to the family of
[1:32:40] the tribe of their father shall they
[1:32:43] marry
[1:32:46] amen we have an inheritance amen our
[1:32:51] inheritance is the holy spirit am
[1:32:54] that is why he says don't marry someone
[1:32:57] that is of another inheritance that's
[1:33:00] right because you're going to
[1:33:01] intermingle it so make sure you marry so
[1:33:05] that is the plan of God brother Braham
[1:33:06] said we must first do what we must
[1:33:11] plan the best way to plan is to plan the
[1:33:15] way God PL the way God has plan it is
[1:33:18] that a Believer should marry a Believer
[1:33:23] amen a Believer should not marry an
[1:33:27] unbeliever now let's look
[1:33:31] into the part that's got to do with
[1:33:35] looking brother Ram said you can
[1:33:38] look but what do you look
[1:33:41] for he said don't look for pretty set of
[1:33:43] eyes don't look for broad
[1:33:46] shoulders but what should you look for
[1:33:48] because we have to look for something
[1:33:51] right
[1:33:54] Brothers right single Brothers right the
[1:33:58] married ones are saying well I'm done
[1:34:01] [Laughter]
[1:34:03] looking Believers th
[1:34:06] this brother Braham was given an um was
[1:34:11] just kind of dramatizing what was
[1:34:13] happening to Mary the mother of Jesus
[1:34:16] all right here she was going down
[1:34:18] probably to get some water let's
[1:34:19] dramatize it just a minute so the little
[1:34:22] fellows can pick it up maybe she she's
[1:34:23] going down to get some water in an
[1:34:26] oriental type they packed it on their
[1:34:28] head big old pcture with wings out on
[1:34:32] the side here handles and I can see
[1:34:35] little Mary about 17 years old engaged
[1:34:38] to a man about
[1:34:39] 45 some year uh some children brother
[1:34:43] Bram told us that Joseph had been
[1:34:45] married before right and he lost his
[1:34:48] wife and then he got spoused to Mary we
[1:34:52] talked about that the last time
[1:34:55] here she come up along but she was
[1:34:58] righteous in her heart because Joseph
[1:34:59] was a just man before God but AB Braham
[1:35:02] said feel a lot better if women young
[1:35:06] ladies today picked something like that
[1:35:09] today instead of some little boy with a
[1:35:12] pack of cigarettes in his
[1:35:14] pocket so that not long ago there was a
[1:35:18] little girl back there at the Tabernacle
[1:35:20] my church brother is talking about the
[1:35:22] church God
[1:35:25] right that's right she's a sweet little
[1:35:28] old girl a little Christian girl she was
[1:35:32] running around with some old little boy
[1:35:34] who packed a flask in his pocket and
[1:35:37] smoked
[1:35:39] cigarettes I couldn't see nothing in the
[1:35:42] boy
[1:35:43] myself but Abraham did not just give up
[1:35:46] on the boy because of who he was he said
[1:35:49] tried for two or three years to get him
[1:35:51] to be a Christian but he wouldn't do it
[1:35:55] and I asked I said sis what do you see
[1:35:58] in that
[1:36:00] boy now let's let's let's answer let's
[1:36:04] see what she was
[1:36:05] looking what she was looking for or
[1:36:09] looking at but the r said you know what
[1:36:11] kind of answer she give me like some of
[1:36:14] this Bobby sock kids today she said
[1:36:18] brother Braham she said it's just got
[1:36:21] such a cute little feet and he smells so
[1:36:26] good so someone was making a decision on
[1:36:30] cute
[1:36:31] feet and perfume that's
[1:36:36] right brother Ram said I thought what a
[1:36:39] way to pick a
[1:36:41] husband the ram said I'd rather marry a
[1:36:45] man that was a Christian that i' fit
[1:36:48] like a box car and smelled like a pole
[1:36:52] cat if he was a Christian
[1:36:56] amen um no one wants to marry that type
[1:36:58] of
[1:37:01] person but brother R was making a point
[1:37:05] here you know we don't know what would
[1:37:09] happen down the road in
[1:37:14] life in
[1:37:17] 1998 we had a car accident we were
[1:37:22] coming from a wedding our family
[1:37:26] and when that accident happened you know
[1:37:29] it was it was a truck that kind of left
[1:37:33] their Lane went and hit a Volkswagen the
[1:37:36] Volkswagen was spinning hit our
[1:37:38] vehicle um we didn't really get hurt I
[1:37:41] just had a bit of cut so we were safe
[1:37:44] but the Volkswagen was right on the road
[1:37:46] and there was this couple that was
[1:37:48] coming with someone else in the
[1:37:51] vehicle um they were not using seat belt
[1:37:54] like the the woman sitting in front was
[1:37:56] not using seat Bel and she had told
[1:37:58] herand I think you need to slow down
[1:38:00] because I think there's a car
[1:38:02] crash um but he just said oh I'm just
[1:38:05] going to you know just bypass it a
[1:38:06] little bit long story short they it was
[1:38:11] too late and then he hit on the brakes
[1:38:13] and the vehicle some assaulted and this
[1:38:16] woman was thrown out of the
[1:38:18] vehicle so I remember my dad crossing
[1:38:20] the road to go help because my dad being
[1:38:24] um a
[1:38:24] medical person wanted to be there to you
[1:38:28] know maybe give first aid whatever
[1:38:30] before the ambulance or any help will
[1:38:33] come and as he crossed the road
[1:38:35] something just told him this is someone
[1:38:36] you know and mentioned the name of the
[1:38:39] woman to him but he didn't even think
[1:38:41] about it he just like the first response
[1:38:44] was Let's help this
[1:38:46] people it turned out that that was my
[1:38:48] mom's
[1:38:50] schoolmate and from that accident she
[1:38:52] had a spal cord
[1:38:54] injury and has been on wheelchair since
[1:38:59] 1988 now her
[1:39:01] husband if he had married her because of
[1:39:04] because when your wheelchair you had
[1:39:06] weights she became
[1:39:08] massive if he had married her because of
[1:39:10] her looks that would have been the end
[1:39:13] of the
[1:39:15] marriage but this man became the
[1:39:18] sweetest husband that she could ever
[1:39:21] have prayed for
[1:39:24] because there was something more that he
[1:39:26] looked
[1:39:28] for so that's the point brother Braham
[1:39:30] is saying making here said that's right
[1:39:33] if he's a Christian that's right by the
[1:39:35] blood of Christ we saved he will make a
[1:39:38] living for you and be a gentle man if he
[1:39:43] saved not by the outward appearance but
[1:39:46] by the heart God judges and his head is
[1:39:50] true read another quote before you get
[1:39:52] we get into the details of this brother
[1:39:56] the hand of the Lord came upon him was
[1:39:58] the title of the message 1954 he said as
[1:40:00] site goes back in the days of Israel
[1:40:02] when they were in the homelands of
[1:40:04] Palestine it was immediately after a
[1:40:07] great tragedy had happened Judah and
[1:40:09] Israel had broken up and had become two
[1:40:11] Nations as it was as it was and Ahab the
[1:40:14] king who got out of God's Will by
[1:40:18] marrying a woman that was not of the
[1:40:22] faith but AB Braham said do you know
[1:40:24] that's still a good thing young man to
[1:40:27] think about young woman marry someone
[1:40:30] who is a
[1:40:32] Christian don't marry
[1:40:34] unbelievers yoke yourself not up among
[1:40:37] unbelievers Paul said for us not to do
[1:40:40] that the scriptures all through forbid
[1:40:43] us to yoke yourself with unbelievers but
[1:40:45] if you are already yoked up with an
[1:40:48] unbeliever and he's and he is willing to
[1:40:51] live with you or she in peace
[1:40:53] don't leave them just remain and live a
[1:40:57] Christian life that you might win your
[1:40:59] companion to Christ and that's exactly
[1:41:02] what you know Paul said in the
[1:41:04] scriptures of the r said I preach what
[1:41:06] Paul preached but it's important to get
[1:41:09] it right the way we can get it right is
[1:41:12] when we follow the word of
[1:41:13] God so what do you look for sisters when
[1:41:16] you're looking for a
[1:41:18] man by the
[1:41:21] scripture the first thing you need to
[1:41:23] realize
[1:41:25] is and the question you should ask
[1:41:27] yourself can this man be my spiritual
[1:41:31] leader amen can this man lead me
[1:41:37] spiritually that's the first thing amen
[1:41:40] Genesis
[1:41:42] 1819 God was speaking about his friend
[1:41:47] Abraham and this is a time when
[1:41:50] God was contemplating
[1:41:53] ating revealing a secret to Abraham of
[1:41:57] what was going to happen the destruction
[1:41:59] of Sodom and Gomorrah but here is what
[1:42:01] God Said for I know him amen that he
[1:42:05] will command his children and his
[1:42:08] household after him and they shall keep
[1:42:11] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[1:42:13] judgment that the Lord may bring upon
[1:42:15] Abraham that which he had spoken of him
[1:42:18] amen this is a man that will command his
[1:42:22] children the way of the Lord amen this
[1:42:25] is a man that can lead the family
[1:42:28] spiritually right and that is exactly
[1:42:32] you know what God was acknowledging here
[1:42:35] that Abraham is a man after my heart
[1:42:38] Abraham is the man that is
[1:42:41] household knows the Lord because of his
[1:42:45] relationship with the Lord amen amen and
[1:42:50] that comes down through generations
[1:42:52] that's right and when is the other way
[1:42:54] around it also comes down through
[1:42:57] generations that's
[1:43:01] right let's look at what Paul instructed
[1:43:04] the people in Corinthians 1 Corinthians
[1:43:07] chapter
[1:43:10] 14 you love the Lord this morning amen
[1:43:13] you enjoying the Sunday School amen can
[1:43:16] I go
[1:43:19] faster I'll try not to go beyond the
[1:43:22] time
[1:43:24] I hope it stays at part two
[1:43:28] but if it goes beyond I hope we can tie
[1:43:32] it all together amen 1 Corinthians
[1:43:35] 14 34 and
[1:43:42] 35 now this is we like to quote
[1:43:45] 34 but I want to bring 35 here as
[1:43:49] something that tells you sisters the
[1:43:52] type of man you should look
[1:43:55] for said let your women keep silence in
[1:43:58] the churches for it is not permitted
[1:44:00] unto them to speak but they are
[1:44:02] commanded to be under obedience as also
[1:44:06] seeth the Lord and if they will learn
[1:44:10] anything let them ask their husbands at
[1:44:13] home for it is a shame for women to
[1:44:16] speak in the church my emphasis is on if
[1:44:20] they will learn anything let them as
[1:44:23] their husbands at
[1:44:26] home and this is the way I understand it
[1:44:29] the husband is called to know as much as
[1:44:33] the preacher in the church
[1:44:37] amen
[1:44:40] H I don't know if that's went down
[1:44:46] well but let's let's let's look at this
[1:44:49] again they come to church they hear the
[1:44:52] preach preacher
[1:44:54] preach they go back home they have a
[1:44:58] question based on what the preacher has
[1:45:00] preached that's right and Paul says
[1:45:04] don't write a question first step ask
[1:45:07] your husband at
[1:45:11] home if the husband does not study the
[1:45:14] word the husband cannot answer that
[1:45:20] question I'm not saying all the brothers
[1:45:22] should have all the answers the
[1:45:23] questions but as much as they can when
[1:45:27] your wife has a question the first
[1:45:29] person she should go to is you as the
[1:45:34] husband and sisters when you're making
[1:45:36] the
[1:45:37] decision that's the type of
[1:45:40] person that you want to be your head
[1:45:44] amen and brothers those are the type of
[1:45:47] people they are going to be looking
[1:45:50] for so to marry daughter of God you've
[1:45:54] got to be that type of
[1:45:58] man how do you
[1:46:00] tell you know we talked about the three
[1:46:02] stages with brah said we said the dating
[1:46:04] is not part of what brah told us we
[1:46:06] explained what dating is we explained
[1:46:08] how it is of the world we explain the
[1:46:10] fact that dating is not intended to end
[1:46:12] in
[1:46:14] marriage it's just to enjoy the
[1:46:16] Privileges of marriage with no
[1:46:18] intentions for marriage but we talked
[1:46:21] about courtship and courtship is the
[1:46:24] time when a young man and a young lady
[1:46:29] are trying to know themselves that's
[1:46:32] right that's the time to actually ask
[1:46:34] yourself is he interested in having
[1:46:36] conversations about the
[1:46:38] word or does he like to talk sports all
[1:46:41] the
[1:46:42] time or talk video games all the
[1:46:48] time because if he going to be your
[1:46:50] spiritual leader when you get married to
[1:46:53] him he should love to talk about the
[1:46:56] word I'll even say throw some questions
[1:46:59] to him right when you're having that
[1:47:02] first conversation oh brother you heard
[1:47:04] what Pastor said today in church what do
[1:47:06] you think about this that's good yeah
[1:47:09] and see what he
[1:47:10] says he
[1:47:13] say I'm not sure but you can ask the
[1:47:16] pastor next Sunday then that's a red
[1:47:20] flag no because the problem is
[1:47:23] people believe that the person you're
[1:47:25] getting married to after married they
[1:47:27] will
[1:47:30] change they don't
[1:47:32] change they don't change there's no
[1:47:34] miracle that happens when you come to
[1:47:37] the Altar and you blessed there's no
[1:47:39] miracle that happens that person is
[1:47:42] going to remain the same person that
[1:47:44] you've you got engaged
[1:47:49] to does he consider the word when making
[1:47:52] decision
[1:47:55] you know there's something that we
[1:47:56] talked
[1:47:57] about um we just having the conversation
[1:48:01] uh with brother
[1:48:02] Elias you know it's amazing that you
[1:48:06] know for those of us that
[1:48:07] relocated when you're relocating when
[1:48:10] people of the world relocate they don't
[1:48:11] think about church they just relocate
[1:48:14] right they just go to a new place
[1:48:15] because maybe they get a better job
[1:48:17] whatever it is there but a Christian
[1:48:20] wants to ask the question is there a
[1:48:22] church there that's right that's an
[1:48:25] example of considering the word when
[1:48:28] making
[1:48:30] decisions the other thing to look out
[1:48:32] for is does this person have a sense of
[1:48:40] responsibility Paul was giv instruction
[1:48:43] to Pastor
[1:48:46] Timothy in 1 Timothy Chapter
[1:48:50] 5 I hope I can find it sometimes it's
[1:48:53] hard to know the sequence of this this
[1:48:56] little
[1:49:00] books yeah
[1:49:02] before so Paul wrote to you know pastors
[1:49:08] Timothy Timothy
[1:49:11] Titus but in 1 Timothy
[1:49:16] 58 it says but if any provide not for
[1:49:19] his own and especially for those of his
[1:49:21] own house
[1:49:23] yet the night the faith and is worse
[1:49:25] than an Infidel that's
[1:49:30] right it's a sense of
[1:49:33] responsibility those that come from
[1:49:35] Africa would probably relate to this but
[1:49:38] there are
[1:49:39] men that will not work that will prefer
[1:49:42] their wife to go work and bring the
[1:49:46] money and they will have the audacity to
[1:49:49] let me put it the way we say it to eat
[1:49:51] the money
[1:49:53] they don't re they don't like actually
[1:49:55] eat the money but what I'm saying is
[1:49:57] they will spend the
[1:49:59] money and sometimes even refuse to give
[1:50:02] the woman part of
[1:50:05] it that is an irresponsible
[1:50:10] man when God made Adam in like we said
[1:50:14] the last time in the garden God gave
[1:50:17] adam
[1:50:18] responsibility right God told him take
[1:50:21] care of this Garden
[1:50:23] God brought all the animals and said
[1:50:25] name them God gave him responsibility
[1:50:27] way before his wife came
[1:50:30] yes so he had a sense of responsibility
[1:50:34] amen he knew it's you know it's it's
[1:50:38] back to school time I know brothers are
[1:50:41] looking at their paycheck and like hey
[1:50:43] God
[1:50:44] help because it's your responsibility
[1:50:47] yes you look at your credit card say
[1:50:51] hey I'm going be Beyond where I usually
[1:50:53] want this to be but it's your
[1:50:57] responsibility the woman is there to
[1:51:01] help the Bible said he gave her an help
[1:51:05] meet for
[1:51:07] her right she's not the primarily person
[1:51:10] who is
[1:51:12] responsible so if you are moving around
[1:51:14] the brother and you are not sensing that
[1:51:18] level of responsibility you ask yourself
[1:51:20] what work does he do you can't really
[1:51:22] tell
[1:51:23] um what are his career plans you know
[1:51:25] you ask questions about 5 years down the
[1:51:28] line what's the plan well we're trusting
[1:51:30] God it's good to trust the Lord right
[1:51:34] but you have to have concrete
[1:51:37] plans you have to say this is what I
[1:51:39] want to do and I'll let me just be
[1:51:41] honest because we've got sisters here
[1:51:44] who who are based here and and uh are
[1:51:47] from Africa and I'm looking at my
[1:51:49] daughter as well I know she's she's
[1:51:51] still too young but
[1:51:54] but it could be someone back back from
[1:51:56] back home that is interested in
[1:51:58] you but you have to discern all they
[1:52:02] might want is Canadian
[1:52:05] citizenship and they will pretend as
[1:52:08] much as they
[1:52:10] can is it possible to get the right
[1:52:13] person that leaves abroad it is
[1:52:16] possible but how do you check whether
[1:52:19] that person is the right person for you
[1:52:21] you bring that person to the the the uh
[1:52:25] what do we call it the the standard of
[1:52:28] the word right you bring that person to
[1:52:31] the word and say what how does this
[1:52:34] person compare with the standard of the
[1:52:37] word so you have to be sure it's someone
[1:52:39] that's
[1:52:40] responsible someone
[1:52:43] who knows that when I have a home it is
[1:52:47] my responsibility to
[1:52:51] provide as ask yourself the question the
[1:52:53] church they are going what are they
[1:52:54] responsible
[1:52:56] for what are they doing in the house of
[1:52:58] the
[1:52:59] Lord is it someone that just shows up on
[1:53:01] Sunday before service is over they're
[1:53:05] gone that's not the person that you want
[1:53:07] to be your spiritual
[1:53:09] leader the last thing I'll say that the
[1:53:12] sisters should look out for is does this
[1:53:15] person have the potential to love and
[1:53:19] honor you
[1:53:22] love and
[1:53:24] honor honor starts from
[1:53:29] respect if he talks rash to you if he
[1:53:33] calls you names don't say you are in
[1:53:38] love it will change i' I'm I'm not
[1:53:41] saying this just out of you know trying
[1:53:43] to make things up I have seen sisters
[1:53:47] that have seen certain red flags during
[1:53:50] the time of courtship and they keep is
[1:53:52] saying it's going to change it's going
[1:53:53] to change but by the time they get into
[1:53:56] marriage it gets worse because in
[1:53:59] marriage the the deal is done the the
[1:54:01] vows have been taken the ceremony is
[1:54:03] over now everybody tries to be
[1:54:07] themselves you already have enough to
[1:54:10] deal with the fact that you are not
[1:54:12] raised in the same home you've come from
[1:54:14] different background there are
[1:54:16] personality clashes that is still enough
[1:54:18] even for those that married right that
[1:54:21] went by the foundation now imagine
[1:54:23] marrying
[1:54:24] someone that has plenty baggages that
[1:54:27] they coming with lack of
[1:54:31] character lack of understanding of their
[1:54:37] responsibility Ephesians we have 15
[1:54:40] minutes more I'll get to the sisters
[1:54:42] very
[1:54:43] quickly 15 minutes
[1:54:45] more
[1:54:47] wow are we enjoying the
[1:54:50] Lord maybe the brothers can help me so
[1:54:52] that I don't flip Ephesians 5:
[1:54:56] 25-29 um I'll just read it from the
[1:54:58] screen
[1:54:59] here now this is Paul's
[1:55:02] instruction remember brother Braham
[1:55:04] always said that the
[1:55:05] reason why he talked about marriage this
[1:55:09] way is that our Earthly marriage has to
[1:55:13] exemplify Christ and the church right
[1:55:16] now and that that's exactly what Paul
[1:55:18] said husbands love your wives even as
[1:55:20] Christ also loved the church
[1:55:22] and gave himself for it that he might
[1:55:25] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:55:29] of the Water by the word that he might
[1:55:32] present it to himself a glorious church
[1:55:34] not having spot a wrinkle or any such
[1:55:37] thing but that he should be holy and
[1:55:39] without
[1:55:40] blemish so ought men to love their wives
[1:55:44] as their own
[1:55:49] bodies this is this is way more more
[1:55:53] than not just being
[1:55:56] selfish right when we talk about being
[1:55:59] selfish they say okay you prefer
[1:56:01] yourself to that
[1:56:02] person but what he's saying here is the
[1:56:05] husband should love the wife well enough
[1:56:09] as he loves his own
[1:56:10] body if you get a hurt on your body you
[1:56:13] want to pay attention to it if you sleep
[1:56:16] and you know you sleep the wrong way you
[1:56:18] sleep on your neck you have a neck pain
[1:56:20] the next morning you want to do
[1:56:21] something about it
[1:56:23] so when your wife is in pain and you are
[1:56:26] not bothered about it then you don't
[1:56:29] love her as your
[1:56:32] body so those are part of the things to
[1:56:34] look out for love honor respect say for
[1:56:38] no man ever hateth his own flesh but
[1:56:42] nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the
[1:56:46] Lord the
[1:56:48] church so he's giving us an example here
[1:56:51] of Christ taking care of the church and
[1:56:54] saying that that's how the husbands
[1:56:56] should be now I said the last
[1:57:00] time it's the families that are the
[1:57:04] smallest units of the society that's
[1:57:07] right the families are also the smallest
[1:57:10] unit of the churches that's right the
[1:57:13] church body you know I'm grateful I'm
[1:57:16] not a pastor but pastors go through a
[1:57:19] lot that we don't know when there are
[1:57:22] problems in
[1:57:23] marriages pastors are the ones that will
[1:57:26] be trying to solve the
[1:57:29] problem they are the ones that I've have
[1:57:32] heard pastors talk about bringing
[1:57:35] couples into the the pastor's
[1:57:37] office and the fact
[1:57:40] that if they can just not be
[1:57:44] selfish the problem will be
[1:57:47] solved but everyone is thinking about
[1:57:50] themselves
[1:57:53] and as long as everyone thinks about
[1:57:55] themselves thinks about how will benefit
[1:57:58] them and not the other person they won't
[1:58:00] be a solution to the
[1:58:02] problem so that man you must make sure
[1:58:05] he's a man that truly loves and horners
[1:58:09] you how do you know because at this time
[1:58:12] he's just telling you he loves you
[1:58:15] and when that time of courtship is
[1:58:18] happening and you go to their house if
[1:58:22] if he has sisters watch how he treats
[1:58:25] his
[1:58:26] sisters if their mom is there watch how
[1:58:30] he treats the
[1:58:32] mom that's the same way he's going to
[1:58:34] treat
[1:58:36] you that's just the way it
[1:58:40] works the time of courtship is the time
[1:58:43] to know this person before you make a
[1:58:48] decision the time of decision brother
[1:58:51] said once you make that now before God
[1:58:53] you are married but when hardship is
[1:58:56] happening you can say oh too many red
[1:58:58] flags I'm not doing this and go back to
[1:59:01] God and say Lord I know I prayed about
[1:59:03] this I felt it was your will but with
[1:59:05] this red flags I don't think I can go
[1:59:08] I'm going to put a pause to
[1:59:10] this is it possible that that person is
[1:59:13] still meant for you
[1:59:15] yes I know a story of someone who was
[1:59:19] praying to the Lord looking for a wife
[1:59:22] and then the Lord kind of mentioned to
[1:59:23] him this is the person and he knew that
[1:59:27] that sister had not testifying testified
[1:59:29] of receiving the baptism of the Holy
[1:59:32] Ghost and he said Lord until I hear her
[1:59:36] testify that she has received the
[1:59:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost I will not go
[1:59:40] and ask her that I want to marry her and
[1:59:44] he waited a little while and as God does
[1:59:47] his own things because he sees the
[1:59:48] sincerity of our
[1:59:50] hearts that's is who had been praying
[1:59:52] for the Holy Ghost God answered her
[1:59:55] prayer and she came and testified that
[1:59:57] she has received the Holy Ghost and it
[1:59:59] was only after that that he went and
[2:00:01] said sister I am interested in
[2:00:06] you so those things are important now
[2:00:09] let's get to the sisters very quickly
[2:00:11] there's a lot to cover but I'll just
[2:00:13] make it very
[2:00:15] quick is he okay I go over five minutes
[2:00:18] okay thank
[2:00:20] you now brother told us that God gave
[2:00:23] the woman three sacred
[2:00:30] trusts it's a trust of
[2:00:33] virtue a trust of
[2:00:36] Womanhood and a trust of
[2:00:41] motherhood when he talked about
[2:00:44] virtue he was talking
[2:00:47] about what God has placed in her not to
[2:00:51] defile I know way mixed audience so I
[2:00:53] won't get into details because of the
[2:00:54] little
[2:00:57] ones but brother Braham said that God
[2:01:00] has committed that secr virtue to
[2:01:03] her and he said nothing else holds it
[2:01:07] but a
[2:01:10] woman now brother Braham told us that
[2:01:12] the union between a man and a woman is
[2:01:16] not the same as when animals come
[2:01:18] together to unite to bring their
[2:01:20] offsprings
[2:01:23] because they don't unite and become one
[2:01:25] because they were not one in the first
[2:01:30] place Eve was taken out of Adam it
[2:01:33] wasn't the same for the animals the
[2:01:35] animals God said that he made them male
[2:01:38] and female when he created them like
[2:01:41] when he spoke them into existence but
[2:01:43] when he made the man but said he first
[2:01:46] made a spirit man the masculine and The
[2:01:48] Feminine was in that Spirit man and then
[2:01:50] he formed the body for that spirit man
[2:01:53] it was only after that that he brought
[2:01:54] the woman out of the
[2:01:56] man and put a seal
[2:02:01] there so that it's only after the woman
[2:02:05] Maks the right man that that seal is
[2:02:07] meant to be
[2:02:10] broken that is the
[2:02:13] first sacred trust that was given to the
[2:02:17] woman brother Braham said if she does
[2:02:21] something wrong she must confess that to
[2:02:23] her husband before he takes her and make
[2:02:26] it right brother acknowledged that not
[2:02:29] everyone might have had the opportunity
[2:02:31] but when you come to the knowledge of
[2:02:32] the truth if you've done something wrong
[2:02:36] it is a
[2:02:39] requirement before married to let your
[2:02:41] husband know this is the type of Life I
[2:02:43] Lived before this is what has happened
[2:02:46] because brother Braham said again that
[2:02:48] he has the right to put her away
[2:02:53] if she doesn't confess
[2:02:56] it it is the quotes I have the quotes
[2:02:59] but we'll just flash it because we don't
[2:03:01] have enough time but if you want the
[2:03:03] quotes I can give them to
[2:03:05] you he said this in the message
[2:03:08] invisible Union right so it was not
[2:03:12] early days this was just about a month
[2:03:15] before the Lord took brother brah
[2:03:17] away so this this was this was way after
[2:03:20] the sales were revealed
[2:03:23] right so she has a secret Trust of
[2:03:25] virtue that's been given to her by the
[2:03:28] Lord God gave her that virtue so I'm in
[2:03:30] paragraph 87 thank you brother just as
[2:03:33] was as it was in the Garden of Eden she
[2:03:35] can say yes or no brother was saying the
[2:03:39] the Garden of Eden was talking about Eve
[2:03:41] and brother Braham said before Adam
[2:03:43] could get to his wife Satan got her and
[2:03:46] he said before Christ to get to the
[2:03:48] church Satan got her but he's having a
[2:03:51] bride in this last age that Satan cannot
[2:03:54] get to and that's why he called that a
[2:03:56] virgin bride remember that is what God's
[2:04:00] intention is we talked about this
[2:04:04] physical marriage being a type of Christ
[2:04:07] and the church and that's how God
[2:04:08] intends
[2:04:09] it then says she has a sacred Trust of
[2:04:12] Womanhood committed to her that she must
[2:04:16] not break the Womanhood I'm speaking of
[2:04:19] here is her conduct her character
[2:04:22] around
[2:04:25] men the woman is not made to be the very
[2:04:30] bold Burly type of
[2:04:34] person but AB Braham said that woman is
[2:04:36] made to be more timid the woman is made
[2:04:39] to be more he use some words he said but
[2:04:43] today we have women that are behaving
[2:04:45] like
[2:04:46] men the woman's body was designed in
[2:04:50] such a way that it requires her to be
[2:04:54] conscious of her
[2:04:56] body a woman is more conscious of how
[2:04:58] she sits than a man
[2:05:00] is it's a sacred trust that the Lord
[2:05:04] committed to her We R talk about all the
[2:05:07] movies T kissing and hugging and talking
[2:05:09] about the fact that the sex glands are
[2:05:12] in the
[2:05:13] lips said a man can kiss a woman if he
[2:05:17] kisses a woman on the lips he has
[2:05:19] potentially committed adultery with her
[2:05:22] and said he can kiss her on the hand it
[2:05:23] soon mix through their sex glance but
[2:05:24] the glance is in the lips and he talked
[2:05:28] about all the nonsense that's happening
[2:05:29] in holywood so God has given the
[2:05:34] woman the sacred Trust of Womanhood a
[2:05:38] conduct around me I don't have time but
[2:05:40] if you have some time you can go read um
[2:05:45] I think it's the
[2:05:46] message Revelation chapter 4 part one
[2:05:49] brother Braham said in a few places
[2:05:50] about
[2:05:52] the son of a ranch
[2:05:55] owner who had visited the ranch and the
[2:05:59] superintendent on the ranch had
[2:06:00] daughters but also had um a niece whose
[2:06:04] parents were late she was an orphan and
[2:06:07] talked about how this boy came you know
[2:06:10] to look for a wife and this boy in
[2:06:13] looking for a wife was looking for
[2:06:16] character that poor cousin was the one
[2:06:19] who you know was
[2:06:22] doing all the
[2:06:23] dishes was you know kept as the slave
[2:06:27] girl but she was the one that he saw
[2:06:30] that had the character that he was
[2:06:31] looking for and that had to do with the
[2:06:34] conduct around me just read it there's a
[2:06:36] lot to learn from it now the final one
[2:06:39] brother the Braham said is she's also
[2:06:40] given the sacred Trust of
[2:06:43] motherhood and the way I like to put it
[2:06:46] is the desire and the ability to
[2:06:49] nurture being a mother is not just
[2:06:52] giving birth to kids Rah said that but
[2:06:55] the desire and ability so Brothers when
[2:06:57] you're looking for a
[2:06:59] woman can this woman nurture your dreams
[2:07:02] into
[2:07:06] reality we have an example of the
[2:07:08] shunamite
[2:07:11] woman it was not the idea of her husband
[2:07:14] to provide shelter for the prophet of
[2:07:17] God it was that
[2:07:19] woman that saw that the prophet used to
[2:07:22] pass by their way and said you know what
[2:07:26] let's call him and give him some
[2:07:28] food and when she noticed that he was
[2:07:30] frequently coming said this man will
[2:07:33] need some shelter what am I trying to
[2:07:36] say some blessings that will come to
[2:07:38] your family will come because of the
[2:07:41] type of wife you
[2:07:47] married they had a child because of that
[2:07:51] the child died they had their child
[2:07:55] brought back to life because of
[2:08:00] that a woman that can
[2:08:04] nurture a woman brother Braham also said
[2:08:07] motherhood and honoring her
[2:08:11] husband a woman that knows that this is
[2:08:14] my head I must defer to him not a
[2:08:19] competitor but someone who defers to the
[2:08:22] head cuz that's how God intended it to
[2:08:25] be it's
[2:08:28] 12:00 this is a never ending
[2:08:31] subject but we'll leave it at that today
[2:08:34] I'll call the musicians let's be on our
[2:08:41] feet the love of the Lord this

[2:12:44] moment and think about these
[2:12:48] things if you're married and
[2:12:52] there's a be of falling
[2:12:53] short in those requirements of
[2:12:58] God as asked for according to his
[2:13:04] word
[2:13:05] remember if it's your heart desire to be
[2:13:08] the right kind of man the right kind of

[2:13:44] thoughts of good and not of
[2:13:47] evil I know it's scary sometimes to
[2:13:51] even think about this and just worried
[2:13:54] about getting it
[2:13:59] wrong but God instituted
[2:14:02] marriage and if we come by his word we
[2:14:06] are bound to get it
