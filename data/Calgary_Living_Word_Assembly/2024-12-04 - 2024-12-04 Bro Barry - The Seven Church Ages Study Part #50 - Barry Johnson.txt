Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen thank you musicians once again bringing of your gifts if we can I'd like to continue on in our study of the exposition of the seven Church ages starting a new church age tonight it's the second last one which is really kind of surprising it's the Philadelphian Church age it's in Revelations 3:7 and uh this would be our this service will be our 50th episode of the exposition of the seven Church ages a jubilee service tonight Lord willing and we know alls we need to do is read this word and we're done amen and all the rest is gravy verse 7 of Revelations chapter 3 and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and Hast kept my word and Hast not denied my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee because thou Hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly hold fast that which thou Hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon on him my new name amen he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen amen let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful that we can read this word by Revelation Lord Jesus we have a little bit of understanding but we know that it takes Revelation by the spirit to make this word live and father tonight we just one more time invite you Lord Jesus to just pour out your Revelation into our lives and we'll be careful to give you all the praise father we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated certainly uh enjoy this study it's it's been real special to me and I trust it's been to everyone amen I know we have lots to go through still and Lord willing it'll just continue to be a blessing to us sorry I just uh you might wonder what I'm doing here I'm not organizing notes I just cover up the screen here because uh of the scrolling it uh kind of distracts me just a few announcements we have a prayer meeting coming up tomorrow night we have brother gift marufu here uh on Sunday we're certainly excited to see him and his family one more time um we have the Youth Event on the 15th of December and we have the communion service on uh testimony communion service on the 31st and uh I think it'll be a wonderful time for those who can attend just getting right into this um this study something really special about this church age the Philadelphian Church age um where we're at I think it's just an an amazing thing there's so much in this church the exposition of the the exposition of the seven Church ages there's so much in there but in the Philadelphia and church age there's something really special about it and uh that is when you read the scripture I believe this is one of if not the only church age where there isn't a rebuke to the church where there's an ad admonishment where the Lord tells them I know exactly what you're going through and you've got a little bit of strength but those people who claim to be Jews who claim to be Christians will come and actually bow down at your feet and they will acknowledge that you love me it's a tremendous thing to think verse 8 he says I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and I just can't help but think that's just exactly like John who was a type of the Bride he saw a door open in heaven didn't he and he was told to come up a little higher there's a greater Revelation for you and we know that that's actually the commission of the Bride as well but I just can't help but think there is an Open Door and no man can shut that door amen doesn't matter what kind of teaching can come along it doesn't matter what kind of tradition we might have doesn't matter what kind of mistakes we can encounter and faults and failures it doesn't matter nothing can shut that door because no no man open that door it's just such a beautiful thought boy to think that thou Hast kept my word and not denied my name that's why there's no rebuke just a beautiful thing tonight getting into chapter eight of the exposition of the seven Church age ages the Philadelphian Church age we'll just read the scripture again because it's in the book I just want to make sure that we absorb every single word in here and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and Hast kept my word and Hast not denied my name I think it's just so beautiful I just have to throw this in there you know how we would be able to say how what would be the identification of those people the identification of those people would be that they have not denied his name and that they have obeyed his word and I think it's just so beautiful brother Paul mentioned it earlier we're here tonight out of obedience to the word of God we want to be fed but the word of God says to forsake not the assembling of yourselves even more so as you see the day approaching and uh just interpreting it and saying well I can just stream or I can just stay home of course we have lives sometimes we have uh sickness and we just can't come to church but what we're talking about is to choose to not come just because is not obedience true and obedience is better than sacrifice I could get started here but I won't behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee because thou Hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth I just can't help but think when was there ever a time of so much temptation is now M that's right behold I come quickly hold fast which thou Hast sorry behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is the New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the only way that we're able to hear is by Revelation and that's the ear we're talking about give us an ear of Revelation Philadelphia was 75 miles Southeast of Sardis excuse me it was the second largest city in Lydia it was built upon several Hills in a famous wine growing District its coins bore the head of bakus and the figure of bante Priestess of bakas the population of the city included Jews Christians of Jewish or origin and converts from heathenism the city suffered frequent earthquakes yet its duration was the longest of the Seven Cities of Revelation in fact the city still exists under the Turkish name of Al aliser or city of God the mintage of the coin suggest the deity of the city to be bakus now bakus is the same as n or Nimrod he is the lamented one though most of us think of him in terms of rry and drunkenness what illumination this brings to our minds here is a coin with the God on one side and the Priestess or propheus on the other Now flip a coin does it matter which way it comes down no sir it still is the same coin that is the romish religion of Jesus and Mary but we are not thinking of Rome only no there is not only the great Harlot certainly not for she by her fornications has become a mother sorry she has become a mother her daughters now are coins of the same mintage there on one side of the coin they have drawn up a worship of Jesus and on the other side they have their priestesses or prophetess also and she writes her Creeds and dogmas and tenants and sells them to the people for salvation insisting that she and she alone has the True Light now we know for sure but I'm just going to put it in my terms uh he's talking about the churches there's Rome but then there's the other churches all of the other churches all of the other churches will wander after the Beast whose names aren't written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world but this is what he's talking about the daughters are all of the churches the female is the church how remarkable is the fact that this age is characterized by the coin for the mother and daughters are all buying their way to heaven money and not blood is the purchase price money and not spirit is the power that moves them ahead the God of this world Mammon hath blinded their eyes remember the scripture says the love of money is the root of all evil but their dealings in death will end soon for this is the age that the spirit cries behold I come quickly even so come quickly Lord Jesus the age the Philadelphian Church age lasted from 1750 50 to about 1906 this age due to the meaning of the name of the city has been called the age of Brotherly Love as Philadelphia means love of Brethren the messenger the messenger to this age was without doubt John Wesley John Wesley was born at edworth June 17th 1703 and was one of 19 children born to Samuel and Susanna Wesley his father was a chaplain in the Church of England but it is more than likely that the religious turn of John's mind was based more upon his mother's exemplary life than upon his father's theology John was a brilliant scholar it was while he was at Oxford that he he and Charles became part of a group who were spiritually EX exercise to worship on the basis of experientially living the truth rather than making Doctrine their standard there's something interesting about that they drew up a spiritual guide of work such as giving to the poor visiting the sick and the imprisoned for this they were called methodists and others other deris of titles now John was sufficiently imbued by the his vision of the need of religion for the peoples of the world that he went to America Georgia as a missionary amongst the Indians on his way there he found that many of the ship's passengers were moravians he was deeply impressed by the meekness peace and courage in all circumstances his labors in Georgia in spite of self-denials and hard work was a failure he returned to England crying I went to America to convert the Indians but oh who shall convert me my must have been a tough time for him back in London he again met the moravians it was Peter bowler who showed him the way of Salvation he was truly Born Again much to the dismay and evident anger of his brother Charles who could not understand how such a spiritual man as John should say that he was not not formally right with God talk about being humble humbling ourselves right it was however not long after that Charles too was saved by grace and that's where I said you know it's interesting how they they were talking about the basis of experientially living the truth rather than making a a book and and Doctrine their standard all we need to do is get saved that's really what we need to do is have a a new birth just get born again and and then we don't need to have a book of dos and don'ts we just live the word amen right my Wesley now began to preach the gospel in those pulpits in London to which he formerly had access but soon they turned him out he didn't fit their mold it was at this time that his old friend George wh Whitefield stood him in a good stead for he invited John to come and meet help him preach in the fields where thousands were listening to the word I think this part's kind of funny Wesley at first was incredulous that he should preach in an in the open instead of a building outside of the normal outside of the routine outside of the tradition right but when he saw the throngs and saw the working of the Gospel in the power of the spirit he turned wholeheartedly to such preaching I say Lord let us see that let us see the the gospel in the power of the spirit in our services the work soon took on such proportions that he began sending out numerous laymen to preach the word this seemed like a parallel to Pentecost where the spirit raised up men with power to preach and teach the word almost overnight there was violent opposition to his work but God was with him the workings of the spirit were mightily manifested and often such a spirit of conviction took a hold of the people as to take away their strength and they would fall to the ground crying in great distress over their sins something about it when someone one truly gets convicted about their lives and they recognize they need a new birth that takes Revelation Wesley was a remarkably strong man he says of himself that he could not remember to have felt lowness of spirits for even a quarter hour since he was born wow he slept no more than six hours a day arose in time to start preaching at 5 practically every day of his ministry preached up to four times on a single day so that in a year he would average over 800 sermons he traveled multiple thousands of miles as did his circuit Riders who carried the gospel near and far in fact Wesley traveled 4,500 miles per year by horse that's a lot he was a believer in the power of God and he prayed for the sick with great faith and wonderful results many of his meetings saw the manifestation of spiritual gifts Wesley was not in favor of organization his associates did have a United Society who were a company of men having the form and seeking the power of godliness United in order to pray together to receive the the word of exhortation and to watch over one another in love that they may help each other to work out their salvation I love this the only condition of these of those entering was that they should be of those who had a desire to flee from the Wrath to come and to be saved from their sins yes it's a pretty straightforward requirement yes as time went on they worked worked out a strict set of rules to be used in self-discipline for the good of their souls Wesley recognized that after his death the movement could be organized and the spirit of God leave them to dead form yes we know that's what happened once he remarked that he did not fear that the name of Methodist would leave the Earth but that the spirit might take his flight and we know that's exactly what happened with every single Church age they departed from the word and what happened the spirit took his flight and he we know that he just went on to the next Church age carrying on though he says during his lifetime he could have acquired vast wealth but he did not his favorite saying on the subject of money was get all you can save all you can and give all you can how strange it would be for Wesley to come back and see the denomination that bears the name of Methodist today they are rich vastly rich but the life and power of John Wesley is missing it should also be mentioned that Wesley never did desire to build a work upon a denominational or sectarian basis though he was an Armenian in his beliefs he did not want to separate himself from Brethren on the grounds of Doctrine he was a good candidate for James he based his eternal life on faith and works or the living of life rather than simply accepting a Creed or doctrinal statement John Wesley died at the age of 88 having served God as few men would dare to even think they might I just was thinking about this um I believe you can actually go and see John Wesley's house in England is that right you can actually see the pulpit that he preached from as well when we were there we didn't actually go there it's too bad I know some here have the salutation and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth Romans 3:7 oh how beautiful are those words How Majestic is even the sound of them how thrilling to think that all those attributes can be applied to one person who would dare say such things about himself but Jesus Christ the lord of Glory I believe the key to interpreting exactly what each of these wonderfully descriptive phrases means is found in verse 9 in Revelations 3:9 behold I will make them of the synagogue of of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved Thee I say this verse is key because it deals with the Jews who have always called themselves the children of God to the exclusion of everyone else they crucified and killed the Lord Jesus Christ their terrible deed brought their own blood upon their own heads for centuries all because they refused Jesus as their Messiah which indeed he was to them he was not the coming one or the son of David to them he was Beelzebub or some unrighteous one fit only for Destruction my and if you know the stories many of us do know the stories about what happened to the Jews even just in our time world wars is pretty terrible and that was for our sake yes amen all of this blindness was for our sake they had the word made flesh standing in front of them and for some reason for our reason they couldn't actually recognize him what a tremendous blessing he was indeed IM Manuel God manifest In the Flesh he is indeed Messiah surely he was exactly as he now sets himself forth to be there he is the same Jesus Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever that Holy One in the midst of the lampstands is the very same Jesus who walked the shores of Galilee who healed the sick who raised the dead and who in spite of irrefutable proof was crucified and killed but he rose again and is seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high the Jews did not call him holy then they do not call him holy now but he is the Holy One amen psalm 16:10 for thou Wilt not leave my soul in heav H neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption they sought their righteousness after the law and failed miserably for by the law can no flesh be justified by the law can no man be made holy Holiness is of the Lord that's why the Methodist Doctrine doesn't work you can have a book of the methods on how to be holy it doesn't take action it takes the Lord Jesus Christ 1 Corinthians 1:30 but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption 2 Corinthians 5:12 that we might be made the righteousness of God in him it was Christ or perish and they perished for they refused him and Men of that age even as even today were making the same mistake as the Jews took refuge in the synagogue form of worship so in the Philadelphian age they were taking refuge in the church it is not joining a church that counts the life is not in the church the life is in Christ amen 1 John 51 and2 this is the record that God hath given us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the Son of God hath not life I think that some summarizes it all right there just saying that we have the father or we have the son or we have the Holy Ghost or we have all three of those do we truly have the son we have to have the Lord Jesus Christ right that's the son and that's what he's referring to there man is made Holy by the spirit Jesus Christ it is the spirit of Holiness that raised Jesus from the dead did you ever think of that it was the spirit of Holiness that raised Jesus from the dead it wasn't just the quickening power of God it was the spirit of holiness that raised Jesus from the dead wow and that indwells us and makes us holy with his Holiness there he stands the Holy One and we will stand with him clothed in his righteousness holy with his Holiness now this age is the sixth age in the eyes of God time is drawing to a close he will soon be coming back soon the cry will go forth as he comes Revelations 22:11 and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still oh I am so glad that my Holiness is not of myself can you say Amen to that amen I am glad that I am in Christ with all his wonderful attributes of righteousness in imputed yay imparted unto me blessed be God forever these things sayth he that is true now his this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true in just a sense that it is the opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with it partial realization for example we recall that Jesus said in John 6:32 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven that's John 632 John 15:1 I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman Hebrews 9:24 for Christ is not entered into the holy Place made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for US 1 John 2:8 because the darkness is passed and the True Light now shineth since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before antitype contrast with type and substance with Shadow take the example now of Mana from Heaven God sent down Angel bread from heaven for Israel but that bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day but those who ate it were hungry again the next day if it was left around it became contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from Heaven whereof Mana was just a type and if any man eats of that bread that came from Heaven he will never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no need any longer for a shadow no need for a partial salvation isn't that wonderful no need for a partial salvation we're not saved today and lost tomorrow we're not going to trip and fall and lose that seal of God in our lives Hallelujah if you're sealed today you're sealed to the day of your Redemption if you're sealed tomorrow you're sealed to the day of your Redemption if you're sealed 40 years ago you're sealed to the day of your Redemption I love that thought amen my no need any longer for a shadow no need for a partial salvation here is the whole of it just like Jesus isn't a part of God he is God Amen no one could deny that Israel had light they were the only people who had light as a nation it was as when Egypt was so dark that one could feel it but in the homes of the Israelites there was light amen but now True Light is come the light of the world is Jesus Moses and the prophets brought the light by means of the scripture relative to the Messiah thus Israel had light but now the Fulfillment of the light has come and what was but glowing word has now broken forth in the brightness of God manifested amongst his people as the pillar of fire gave light at night and that was wonderful now light and life were manifested in the fullness of the godhead bodily Israel used to take the red heer and sacrifice her upon the Altar for the remission of sins for a ye a year the sins of the guilty one was covered but that covering could not take away the desire for sin it's so beautiful brothers and sisters because if you you you've experienced it you know that that was in the past that was the partial now the full is you can actually have one sacrifice the realization that one sacrifice was made already you don't even have to do it you just have to accept that it was done and it's done for good and it takes away the desire to sin in our lives we don't have to have the desire he he says it it was not a perfect offering it was a shadow until the real came along so each year the man would sacrifice and each year come back he still had the same desire to sin the life of the animal atoned for his sin I'm going to throw this in there for those people that don't actually give themselves over completely to the full baptism of the Holy Ghost they still have the desire to sin there is a difference if you don't go all the way if you go all the way through justification all the way through sanctification and just stop right there at the river and don't cross over you're going to be just like they were in Israel amen come to church and have a tremendous service make your sacrifice your worship and then go home and you'll have the same problems over and over again but if you ever one time just give over like we read on Sunday just just try it one time and see what happens brother Bram said love that quote he says but being animal blood that was shed and animal life that was given it could not come back upon the man if it had come back it still would not have availed but when Christ the perfect substitute was given and it was he was and his blood was shed and it was and the life that was in Christ came back upon the repentant Sinner and that life being the perfect life of Christ sinless and righteous then the guilty one could go free for he had no desire to sin the life of Jesus had come back upon him that is what is meant in Romans 8:2 the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death now what is sin brothers and sisters carousing smoking drinking gambling all the different attributes of sin we need to remember and and just I I believe speak it sin in its raw form is unbelief unbelief in the word of God that it doesn't have the life that we're talking about to deliver us to save us from sin but when we can actually take that per perfect realization of Truth in our day and apply it to our lives say hey I believe that I don't understand it I can't explain it but I believe it something takes place in our lives and I can't help but think that's exactly what happened to Mary I can't understand it I I I can't explain it I just know that I saw an angel and that angel said that a virgin shall conceive and that you are highly favored amongst women I want to say tonight brothers and sisters if you have the ability to hear this word you are highly favored among the female women the church amen that perfect realization sets you free amen but the Jews back there in the time of Jesus did not want to accept that sacrifice and even today some people they just don't want to accept that sacrifice they'll go most of the way I want to tell you tonight go all the way brothers and sisters don't be like those Jews back there and go part way the blood of bulls and goats made nothing perfect it was once God's ordained method but now Christ having appeared in the flesh and by the shedding of his own blood has put away sin and by that offering of himself has made us perfect the Jews would not take that but what about that Philadelphian age and yes the other ages too did they really accept this reality in Christ no sir even though Luther brought the truth of justification the romish church and its eastern counterpart the Orthodox Church still clung to works now where works are fine but they don't save you right they don't make you perfect amen it is Christ or perish and it is not even Christ and works it's not even Christ and works brothers and sisters it's Christ Alone amen it's Christ alone and I want to say this when we do have Christ alone all the signs all the Wonders all the works everything else manifests and sometimes it's not perfect sometimes it looks really scattered but it doesn't matter so long as it's obedience to the word this age began the years of armenis that does not believe in Christ as the reality it does not sing of nothing but the blood for it sings of nothing but the blood and my own conduct now I believe in Good Conduct if you are saved you will do righteously we have already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus it is Jesus alone amen I just wish people who were critics of this message of the hour of William Mary and Bram would just hear these words would just read these words right how could you say that it's a cult and then he's drawing men after himself right he's pointing them to Christ saying very clearly that it's only his blood his sacrifice alone salvation is of the Lord from start to finish it's all God let his life be in me that it be his blood that cleanses me let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my heart and my mouth let it be his stripes that heal me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteousness which I have done no sir Christ is my life amen thank you Lord I believe we could close up and go home right after that man that's just awesome I feel I could just go on and on about these truths but I will give you one more thought it's about that wonderful hymn that AB Simpson wrote once it was the blessing now it is the Lord once it was the feeling now it is his word once his gift I wanted now The Giver own once I sought for healing now himself alone amen all and all forever Jesus will I sing Everything in Jesus and Jesus everything does anybody here know that himym can we sing that him sometime I don't think tonight I I I wouldn't I don't know it myself I just was thinking that's just wonderful because that's it right there isn't it amen there isn't anything in this life satisfying as it may be as good and as fine as it may be but you will find the sum total of all perfection in Christ everything Fades into insignificance beside him amen that's what the new birth is you become a new creature in Christ Jesus you can't feed at the old slop troughs that you used to go to and and you still try to this flesh doesn't die easy keeps taking you back but gradually slowly day by day service by service tape by tape on and on you go all of those nasty things in our lives start to fade away if we put him first truly first amen he that hath the Key of David this beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding phrase he that is true Christ the perfect realization contrasted with partial realization here it is Moses was a prophet of God but Jesus like unto Moses was the prophet of God excuse me David a man after God's Own Heart was king of Israel but Jesus is the greater David king of kings and Lord of lords God very God now David was born of the tribe of Judah out of whom no priest came yet he ate of the Sho bread reserved for priests he was the great warrior overcoming the enemy establishing the people as king he sat on the throne he was prophet he was a wonderful type of Christ my Isaiah 22:22 and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder and he shall open and None Shall shut and he shall shut and None Shall open the spirit uses this Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church what the Key of David signified at that time is mere Shadow which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst of the lampstands it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection and not his Earthly pilgrimage but what does the key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of of other men or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has that right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it's on his shoulder but what does his shoulder have to do with it and the government shall be upon his shoulders Isaiah 9 and6 but what does this mean the answer is the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the East when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility I just can't help but think the last wedding that we witnessed just ask brother Tois so is that right that's what we do we assume that when the bride takes her veil off and places it upon the groom's shoulder that signifies ownership God being Sovereign now I I don't mean that in a bad way the husbands don't own their wives I'm not saying that you know what you mean brother yeah good just want to make sure we're clear there anyway God being Sovereign he forew by Divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her he did not she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation thank you Lord amen he is her head for Christ is the head of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord amen he speaks and she obeys for that is her Delight amen but have men heeded this truth have they esteemed his person who alone has the full Sovereign authority over his church church I say no for in every age the church has been governed by a hierarchy a priesthood an Apostolic succession closing the door of mercy and Grace To whom it will and instead of assuming the love and responsibility of the church it has with mercenary lust prayed upon her and destroyed her the clergy lived in luxury while the poor Church fed on the husks of abuse and not one age did any different each bound itself to organization and put the government upon men and committed the church to that government dare let the people rise up and they were brutally suppressed or cast out every denomination ation has the same Spirit every denomination swears that it has the key to the government of the church every denomination claims that it opens the door but that is not true it is Jesus and Jesus alone amen isn't that good isn't that clear isn't that clean doesn't it make it just so easy to understand my Jesus and Jesus alone he sets the members in the body he endows them with their Ministries he puts the gifts at her disposal he cares for her and guides her she is his sole property and he has no other one but her amen amen what a far cry from reality is this church age in which we live amen and one day soon these men that even now prepare to speak for the church will be rising up in The ecumenical move to place a living Antichrist at the head of their organization which deposes the Lord and we will find him Christ outside the church Revelations 3:20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and I will s with him and he with me I think it is Hoffman that did that picture of Christ on the outside holding a lanon knocking at the door um but we know that it's been said that someone mentioned uh there's something wrong with a picture yeah and that is that there's no door handle on the outside of the door and remember the story brother brandham said this he told the the explanation of this he said the door handle isn't supposed to be on the outside of the door it's supposed to be Christ on the outside knocking on the outside of the door the door handles on the inside of the house and that house is the heart of the Believers it's just such a beautiful picture I remember when I was a kid my grandparents in in Red Deer they actually had that picture and I uh I remember just looking at it as a little kid a tiny little kid one of my earliest memories seeing that picture and just looking at it something was I don't know attracting me to it I guess I can see now why but kind of interesting but let me say this our Lord is not defeated men claim to open the door to God and shut the door but they are liars John 637 to39 n all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me will I know will I in no wise cast out for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day amen and when that last elected member to the body of Christ comes in then will our Lord appear and I just can't help but think that's that's a sentence in my book it's actually a paragraph but that that one sentence is where we live isn't it it's what we're looking towards it's what we're hoping for it's what we're agonizing to see happen and we don't know that person could be in already and they just need to come to the full real ization there could be many people that need to come to the full realization we don't know we don't want to put anybody in or out we just want to continue to encourage one another to Jesus Christ the Key of David was not David the king of Israel all Israel and is not Jesus the son of David according to the fact that he will sit upon the throne of David in the Millennium and Reign and rule over his Heritage surely so the key of David signifies that it is Jesus who will bring in the Millennium he who has the keys to death and hell will raise up his own that they may share in his reign of righteousness upon the Earth how wonderful that our Lord has all the answers truly in him are all the promises of God fulfilled amen truly by being in in him we are hires to what he has purchased for us yes there he stands the Lord Of Glory once as the father he was surrounded by the Angels the archangels the cherubims the seraphim and the whole host of Heaven crying holy holy holy is the Lord God of hosts such was his Holiness that no man could approach unto him but now we see him in the church Glory sharing his own Holiness with us until in him we have become the very righteousness of God yes there he stands Jesus perfect everything lily of the valley the bright and Morning Star the fairest of 10,000 Alpha and Omega root and offspring of David Father Son and Holy Ghost the all in all amen Isa Isaiah 9 and6 For unto us a child is born and unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace in him is perfect fulfillment amen though once we esteemed him not now we love him with joy unspeakable and full of Glory anybody say Amen to that amen oh my Amen in him is perfect fulfillment this world is looking for so much fulfillment whether it's travel whether it's entertainment all manner of things though once we esteemed him not we didn't know about Jesus even if we did I remember telling to someone there was a time in my life where I thought Christians were just weak because they they couldn't stand on their own they had to have a crutch they had to have something to to be a member of because they just couldn't get over it whatever it was in their life without realizing that there's such a fulfillment in knowing Jesus Christ but I personally think because I just never really met him personally myself it wasn't the time appointed of the father but boy when that time comes this becomes so real to the individual Hallelujah it it's perfect fulfillment in him though once we esteemed him not now we love him with joy unspeakable and full of Glory that's why you can't stay away from church when there's time to go to church it's an opportunity to go and worship it's like brother mvin was talking about when it's time to tithe when we get our paycheck we can't wait to actually tithe on that check not because anything that's going to happen because there's such a blessing that's attached to it and it comes in so many different forms though once we esteemed him not now we love him with joy unspeakable and full of Glory I just can't stop reading that in the midst of the church he stands and we will sing his praise for he the mighty conqueror is head over the church which is his bride he bought that bride he owns her she is his and his alone and he cares for her he is our King and we are his kingdom his eternal possession thank you Lord my if we're his bride and we recognize that he alone cares for her what do we have to fear brothers and sisters whether we live whether we die we're Christ amen now you will recall that at the beginning of verse 7 I said that verse 9 would help us to understand it I hope you saw what I meant Jesus set himself forth as the he that is Holy true or the only reality the one with the Key of David the the one who opened and shut and that is exactly true those phrases describe him perfectly but the Jews in his day refused him and all he was they rejected their Savior and all he meant to them and the nominal Christian has now done the same they have done what the Jews did exactly and we know that brother branam the prophet the Vindicated prophet he preached a message I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ the indictment and the reason he did that was God himself had to say it to the people and that's what he's referring to here they rejected the word when the word came because the word didn't come the way they thought that it should come and that's exactly the way it was for the Jews they thought that it should come in a great procession all of the banisters of Heaven should open up and the king of kings and Lord of Lord the Messiah should come down the banister step right into Israel and deliver them and he did but they rejected him because he didn't come the way they thought he should same thing today brothers and sisters they did what the Jews did exactly the Jews crucified him and then turned on the True Believer the nominal Christian has crucified him aresh and turned on the true church to destroy it but God is true and he who is above all will yet return and when he does he will show who the only potentate is and as he proves himself to the world and all the world bows at his feet at that time all the world will bow at the feet of the Saints proving that they were right in their St with him blessed be God forever amen the age of the open door Revelations 3:8 I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has has kept my word and H has not denied my name amen the first phrase of this verse I Know Thy work is analyzed in the rest of the verse for their Works had to do with the open door little strength the word and the name Amen in order to understand the wealth of meaning involved in behold I set before you an open door and no man can shut it we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another age there is an overlapping a melting or Fading Into rather than an Abrupt end and a clearcut start this age particularly flows into the next age and not only does this age overflow into the last age but the last age is in many respects simply a carrying on of the sixth age the seventh age a very short age gathers up into itself for one quick work all of the evil of every age and yet all the reality of Pentecost once the Philadelphian age has about run its chorus the leoan age quickly comes in bringing both the tears and the wheat to harvest Matthew 13:30 first bind the tears to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn remember please that the sardan age started the Reformation that must still go on until the grain that was planted at Pentecost goes through the full cycle of planting watering nourishing Etc until it comes right back to the original seed while this is going on the tears that were sewn will have to go through their cycle and be harvested also that is exactly what we see happening if you can just think of the seasons you can get a very good picture of this the plant that you see growing in full strength in summer suddenly appears to be going to seed you can't tell exactly when summer became Autumn it just faded into it that's I just can't help but think of this year how summer went into Autumn and it just went on and on and on and then suddenly boom winter there was really not much blending you can't tell exactly when summer became Autumn it just faded into it that is how the ages are and especially these last two it is to this age that Jesus says I come quickly verse 11 that makes the last age a very short one Le oysa is the age of the quick work it's cut short now we will specify we will specifically dwell on the open door that no man can shut first of all I want to dwell on the door as signifying the tremendous missionary effort of that age Paul called a new missionary Endeavor for the Lord an Open Door in 2 Corinthians 2:12 furthermore when I came to troas to preach Christ's gospel and a door was opened unto me of the Lord so we can see by the comparison of scriptures that this door this Open Door signified the greatest spreading of the Gospel that the world has ever seen I want you to see something here I'll call the musicians as we close I want you to see something here God works in threes doesn't he it was in the third or per ban age that the church was married to the state the Deeds of the nians had become the doctrine of the nicians that age was the open door for the false Vine once it was backed up by the power of the state it became actually a world system even though it bore the name Christian thus it spread like wildfire but now Three Ages later after a long and hard struggle of Faith here comes the open door to the truth amen the word of the Lord now has its day of course the fifth age had set the stage for this Mighty move as that age gave us exploration colonization the printing of books Etc it would have been wonderful if this Open Door had followed the Divine pattern of Pentecost which was set forth in Hebrews 2 therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip maybe stand with me as we close tonight for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed to unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his will I'll just stop there tonight we'll pick up from there next week Lord willing did you enjoy that tonight I just can't seem to get enough of this it's just so good so rich Let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful Lord Jesus that you have given us truth in the day in which we live oh Father knowing that it's it's
