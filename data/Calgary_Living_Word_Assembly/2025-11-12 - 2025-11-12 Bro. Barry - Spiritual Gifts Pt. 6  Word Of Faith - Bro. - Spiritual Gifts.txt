We love you, Lord, and we love to praise you. And we love to worship you, Father, with our in this manner, Father.

Amen. This song has such an atmosphere with it. I was woken up about 5:'lock this morning and [music] this song was on my mind and I said, "Lord, would you remember? Would you help me remember it by the morning? And I don't think I went back to sleep. But you were the word at the beginning. There is none that [music] rivals him, is there? Let's sing it this evening just in worship to him. You were the word at the beginning, one with God the Lord most high.

Nothing can stand against. What a powerful [music] name [singing] it is. That name of [music] Jesus. Amen. Hearing the prophet this week again, you've heard the story many times. He said, "If that name could bring a dead baby to life in Elizabeth's womb with the first mention of Jesus name, what ought it to do to a redeemed son and daughter of God." That's the truth. I believe we love him that way this this evening. So wonderful to give him praise. So wonderful to give him honor. He's so worthy. He There is no rival. There [snorts] is no equal to our God. Blessed be his name. Well, yes, [singing] his love. Oh, it [music and singing] takes good care of me. Is that your testimony tonight? Oh, it [music] is love.

Let's sing it again as we stand our pastor. [music] for I [singing] was born to be [music] [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. [music] Heat.

[singing] [music] Yeah. [singing] Heat. [music] [music] [music] Oh [singing] [music] yes mighty. [music] [singing] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; before [singing] [music] acappella. Now raise your voices to [music] him. You are the one [singing] that we praise. [music] You are the one we adore. [singing] Lord, you give the healing and grace [singing] I always hunger for. [singing] Oh, hearts always hunger for everyone now. [singing and music] Oh, you are the one that we pray. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [music] [singing] Oh, [music] our hearts always. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless you tonight. Welcome to the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Certainly an honor and a privilege to gather [music] together in his name. &gt;&gt; Just like to remember sister Janet Bochi man who isn't feeling well. She was struggling today. I guess and uh have a request for prayer for her. If you have a need tonight, maybe just make it known unto him as we go to him. Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, tonight we thank you that we can come unto you, Lord, with all of our needs. Father, we just want to ask Lord Jesus that you would be with Sister Janet tonight. Father, our sister, Lord, who is so faithful in [music] your house. We pray that you would just send your angel by her way, Father, that you would touch her in the name of Jesus Christ, that you would lift her up, Father. Lord Jesus, we know that we're not even worthy for you to come under our our roof, Lord. But, Father, just speak the word. Just one word from you, Father. And we know that you've come in the age in which we live in, Father. And you've [music] even changed it from the way that centurion spoke the word to you, Father. &gt;&gt; You said, "Why cry? Speak." &gt;&gt; So tonight, we just thank you for healing Sister Janet, in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just commit each and every need, Lord Jesus, that's behind every [music] uplift hand to you, Father. &gt;&gt; That you would sovereignly meet the needs tonight, Lord. [music] And we know, Father, there's many needs that aren't even manifested, [music] Lord, behind an uplift hand. We know that you know them. And we pray that according to your will, Father, that you would manifest those needs, Lord, that you would bring them to pass, Lord, that you would provide a way not to go around them or under them, Father, but to go through them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be that fourth man in the fire, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; for us in our lives. Lord, we'll be careful to give you the praise. Father, we thank you for touching the carpenter's friend. Lord, that one who had a daughter whose heart or her lungs, Father, were riddled [music] with cancer and there wasn't much hope from the doctor's perspective. But now she's back home &gt;&gt; and the doctor's report is that it's a miracle. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for touching her in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; You deserve all the glory. Father, tonight we just love you and we thank you. We just commit this service and each [music] life into your hands now, Father, for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, musicians. Welcome to our visitors. Certainly good to have you with us once again. &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, I'd like to read from 1 Corinthians chapter 12. talking about spiritual gifts once again tonight. We'll take another step forward. Probably uh wind up hovering here for a little while. I can't see how we could just go past this one, but [snorts] we'll start with 1 Corinthians 12:1. &gt;&gt; Amen. Love how the spirit speaks to the age to the [clears throat] first church age messenger setting the pattern for the church in every other age. And that concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. This is not something that we're supposed to be wondering at, that we're supposed to be confused about. According to the scripture, the spirit saying, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. You know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed &gt;&gt; and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit. &gt;&gt; And there are differences of administrations. &gt;&gt; Amen. but the same Lord. &gt;&gt; And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which workketh all in all. &gt;&gt; But the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all. So it's not just for an exclusive bunch. It's not just for the ministry. It's not just for anyone specifically other than everyone. anyone who would be a son or a daughter of God. Verse eight, for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit. to another the working of miracles. To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another diverse kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these workketh that one and the selfsame spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. &gt;&gt; Amen. For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, &gt;&gt; so also is Christ. &gt;&gt; For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one spirit. For the body is not one member but many. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word and we thank you for your spirit, Lord Jesus, that you have given to profit every man with all. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we pray that we could approach your word tonight by your spirit, Lord. that it wouldn't be through carnality, that it wouldn't be Lord Jesus the uncction of man, but it would truly be by your leadership, &gt;&gt; by your Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; by the person of Jesus Christ. Tonight, we invite you, Lord, to have the preeminence now. Have the preeminence, Lord, in our hearts, in our minds, and in our mouths. We just commit the rest of this service into your hands for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be seated. Just uh another scripture I would like to read if we could just turn over to Hebrews chapter 11 talking about faith tonight out of verse 9 to another faith by the same spirit. Hebrews chapter 11. While you turn there, I just want to go over some announcements. We've got brother Cadre Diggs coming Saturday the 22nd and Sunday the 23rd. He'll be here at 6:00 p.m. on Saturday night. Remember the graduation celebration. If you would like to celebrate, I ask that you would reach out to me directly. If you have graduated and not been appreciated by the body, we certainly want to provide that opportunity. Over in December, I will be traveling to Grand Prairie the first weekend. I have been invited to come by brother Darren Ber and I believe they could use a little encouragement. So I'm gonna I'm going to go up there and just see them. And my understanding is that a lot of the ministers, if not all of the ministers have moved to Edmonton. So I think that brother Darren's feeling a little bit isolated and uh we'll go and give him some love. So he's invited me to come and take three services Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. And uh so that'll be really good if you don't mind just praying for us that we could bring some real encouragement by the word. That's that's my desire. And uh brother Don Snow has uh agreed to take the service on Sunday the 7th of December. So certainly pray for him as well. We have the youth service on Friday the 12th. That'll be at 7:30 here in the sanctuary. We have the youth event after service on the 21st. And uh on the 31st we will have a worship communion service. And uh it's a Wednesday evening. So I'm I'm happy that Christmas and New Year's are falling the way they are this year. It's certainly nice to to not have strange days during the week where it just interrupts everything. Even though the Christmas season does that anyways, uh it's just nice to have regular service days. Are you happy tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Certainly nice to be in the presence of the Lord and uh we're certainly thankful that we have this word over in the book of Hebrews. This is the chapter of faith. And uh I think this is why I'm saying we could spend a lot of time on this one gift in the body. But I just wanted to sort of point this part out as we get going with this discussion of the gift of faith because it truly is a gift. Um in Hebrews 11:1 it says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." And we know brother Brham, he preaches on this and he says that faith is a substance. It is something. It is not intangible. It is just as real as you and I are real. And we know that in the very first message that brother Brandham has as a recording in faith is the substance. I mean, we could take that message and study that one out, but I'm not going to tonight. But I am going to point out the fact there was that girl that had that really, really serious, I think it was appendicitis, and she could not travel even travel to the hospital because if she did, it would rupture. And so, she needed a touch from the Lord. That was the only thing that would heal her body that would fix her in that moment. Even a doctor at that time couldn't fix her. But brother Brandham said to her, "Do you have faith?" and and she said, "Of course I have faith. I'm a Christian. Don't you know that that I've got faith?" And and he said, "Yeah, you don't have faith." And she got really challenged and upset by it. And uh if you go back and and you listen to that message, you can't really hear it clearly, but you can read along with it. Brother Brandham talks about how he said to her, "Okay, if you can see while you're laying there in that bed, if you can see that chain that's hanging from the light, I would like you to take that faith that you have and move that chain &gt;&gt; with your faith. Move that chain." And she said, "I can't do it." And he said, "Well, how can you have faith then if you can't move that chain?" And she said, "Well, no one can." And he said, "Yes, I can. I can do it with my faith." And she said, "No, you can't. It's spiritualism if you can." And he said, "Just watch." And he said, "He made it move one way and then he made it move back the other way with the faith that he had." And she called it spiritualism. And he said, "No, that's the spirit of the Lord." But we know that she was able to actually listen to the prophet through all of that. And there was a healing that came to her body. But faith is something that's more real than what we can even imagine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, it all has to do with believing or not believing. And fear is probably the biggest hindrance to faith, isn't it? &gt;&gt; And why is it? Because we don't want to actually have faith for something and speak for something and then not see it come to pass the way that we speak it. &gt;&gt; But what we need to do, I believe, is work on speaking things that the word of God says that we should speak &gt;&gt; and and trusting the Lord, saying, "Be it unto me according to your will, which is your word." not actually trying to wave a wand and make God dance for us. Make him do things that is outside of his word. I if we want him to do something, we need him to do it according to the way he wants to do it. But that's that's a different story, a different discussion. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the things that we hope for. That's faith. And the evidence of things not seen. How could we have have have faith that we actually have salvation for our bodies? That we're actually going to be saved should we have to actually go by the way of the grave. That is substance. Nobody can talk you out of it. I'm sure there's nobody here tonight in this audience that could be talked out of your salvation. That somebody could come around and say you you know what? When you die, you're just going to just cease to exist. You're just going to vanish and that's it. There's nothing more. Nobody in this room, even the smallest child, is going to say, "Get lost because I believe." Why is that? Because there's a substance. &gt;&gt; That faith is something more than just an idea or an ideology. It's something. And I think it's a gift. &gt;&gt; That's where I'm going with it tonight. But Hebrews 11 chapter 11 verse one. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful when we look back at all of the elders &gt;&gt; and how they lived their lives serving the Lord, serving the Lord according to his word, believing the Lord according to this message. The faith that they had, that substance of faith that they had obtained them a good report. People can say, "Look at those brothers. They've served the Lord for 40, 50, 60, 70 years and nothing has changed them. They still love the Lord just as much as they did. Maybe more today than ever. &gt;&gt; There's a substance to their faith. &gt;&gt; They've obtained a good report. Verse three says, "Through faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God." Genesis 1:1, &gt;&gt; in the beginning, God said. And we know that that's all of creation. God said, God said, God said, &gt;&gt; through faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. By faith, Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous. God testifying of his gifts. Can you imagine that? &gt;&gt; God testifying of your gifts. &gt;&gt; What was the gifts that he had? It wasn't necessarily the lamb that he chopped the neck of that brother Brandham talked about and upset the formal program of his brother who brought all of the beautiful flowers and fruits of the field. It wasn't necessarily that. It was the revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so tonight, if we've got a revelation about faith, I just can't help but think that God testifies of our gifts, too, doesn't he? Amen. &gt;&gt; By faith, Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, which he obtained witness that he was righteous. God testifying of his gifts, and by it he being dead, yet speaketh. By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him. For before his translation, he had this testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; So beautiful that he pleased God. &gt;&gt; You know, David, a man after God's own heart. He pleased God also. &gt;&gt; Why was that? Why was he a man after God's own heart? I just feel so impressed to go down this road. It's so important to remember this, brothers and sisters, because this flesh is never going to be perfect. &gt;&gt; The perfection that we read about in the Bible is not about this flesh. It's about maturity of the spirit. Being complete is actually the definition. Completeness. That is maturity. Adoption. We can say it many different ways, but you know, the testimony that pleases God is the one that's willing to be quick to repent. &gt;&gt; Understanding that we need grace. &gt;&gt; We could look at the bums on the street maybe and say, "Oh my, they need grace." We could look at the people that maybe just have superior blind spots and we could say, "Oh my, they need grace." &gt;&gt; But what we need to do is not be like that publican in the temple. &gt;&gt; We need to actually beat our chest and hang our heads and say, "Lord, forgive me." &gt;&gt; And that will be pleasing to God. &gt;&gt; Verse six says, "But without faith, it is impossible to please him." Without faith, it's impossible to please him. So if we can have head knowledge and and understanding and wisdom and knowledge, we can have those gifts without revelation of faith in our lives, we're not pleasing God because it's not about knowledge. It's not about learning and it's not about understanding. It's about faith. &gt;&gt; It's all about faith. Being able to say, "Be it unto me according to thy word. I believe it." That's all. &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. I maybe even can't even understand it. We don't have to. The only thing we got to do is believe it. That's why the prophet's theme song was only believe &gt;&gt; around the world seven times. Only believe. ALL THINGS are possible. &gt;&gt; It's so beautiful. But without faith, it is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I just think it's so important for us, brothers and sisters, to remember that he is &gt;&gt; not was not will be. He is. &gt;&gt; He's very, very aware of every single situation in this building tonight. He's very aware of every situation that's not in this building tonight. Like, like I I I've said it before, I don't even know if I could express it the way that I just sometimes see it and and feel it. like to think that you know the the the days of Micaiah, the prophet Micaiah when Ahab and and and Jehoshaphat were going to go and take Syria, take back the land from Syria, the Syrians, that whole story. And and we know that the prophet Micaiah said, you know, I I seen I I could see the vision in heaven. There was a throne set in heaven and and and the Lord sitting on the throne said, "Who can get my word, my will to come to pass in the life of Ahab?" And we know there was a prophecy that had gone forth about Ahab when he finally stepped over the line listening to his wife, not actually taking correction from the word, which was the prophet. But we know that there was actually a council in heaven about that one situation. Brother Brandham says it very clearly that there is a council in heaven for you. So to think about over 8 billion people happening in this world thinking and dreaming and talking and acting and living their lives. Every single one of those situations is in a council before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing is happening outside of God saying yes, no, yes, no. We know brother Bradom said that he knows every single flea that's on the earth, every single time it will bat its eye and how much tallow comes off it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know the word says that every single hair on our head is numbered. &gt;&gt; How do we explain that? How do we understand that? We don't. We just have faith. &gt;&gt; The word says it. Therefore, I believe it. And that settles it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But he is. Present tense. I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is. And that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. But this faith, where does it come from? Where does faith come from? If we need faith if it is a gift, where does it come from? I I just thought it was really good to uh to talk about it, you know, and and how does faith grow? How does our faith grow? Where does it come from? It comes from this right here. This what we're doing right now, the five-fold ministry, the anointing of the Holy Ghost through a ministry. Not me, not my ministry, his ministry. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost ministry. by the believers pulling on the word of God, coming expecting, coming and worshiping, coming believing by faith that he is and that he's a rewarder of those who diligently fight their way across the city on a Wednesday night &gt;&gt; to be in service for the king &gt;&gt; so that they can get something from him &gt;&gt; because of faith. &gt;&gt; But how does faith grow? By &gt;&gt; Romans 10 verse 17. So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing &gt;&gt; by the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's how faith comes. &gt;&gt; So if we need more faith, brothers and sisters, I want to say tonight, you're on the right track. &gt;&gt; We're on the right track because we're coming to hear the word and the word of God. Not just the word of Brother Barry, not just hearing, but hearing by the word of God. So it's not even just hearing. It's beautiful how this scripture is written because it's hearing by the word of God. I saw a little a little video and I think there's some really neat videos. It makes me think of brother Mvin every single time. It's the story of Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones and how God says to him, "Son of man, can these bones live?" [laughter] And then he says to him, "Speak to these bones and tell them." But how could they ever hear? There's there's no ears. It's the spirit of the Lord. It's hearing by the word. And what word is it? It's the word of the vindicated prophet. It's not the prophet's word. It's God's word through that prophet to the age &gt;&gt; which will give us faith &gt;&gt; that will change our bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That will turn us from dry bones &gt;&gt; with ears that don't even have the ability to really hear &gt;&gt; to be able to hear this word and say amen. That's just so beautiful. You know, in in Matthew chapter 13, maybe let's turn over there tonight. Matthew chapter 13. We've got a fair bit of time so far. Matthew chapter 13. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 13. We know the disciples were listening to Jesus talk in parables and and talk in parables and talk in parables and they finally had to say something to him in in verse 9 here. Jesus, you know, he talks about the seeds falling in in the ground. And I'm not going to really read too much of that, but in verse 9, he says, "Who hath ears to hear? Let him hear." And we know that's the admonition to every single church age, isn't it? He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith to the church. But verse 9 says, "He who hath ears to hear, let him hear." And we know this is Jesus talking. But then his disciples came and said unto him, verse 10, "Why speak thou unto them in parables?" Why do you speak in parables? He answered and said unto them. Isn't it beautiful what he said unto them? because it's given unto you &gt;&gt; to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven &gt;&gt; but to them it is not given. &gt;&gt; For whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath. I can just imagine as he's telling these disciples these words, he's just confounding them even further. He's not giving them a straight answer. He says in verse 13, "Therefore speak I to them in parables, because they seeing see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. Yet they can see just fine with their eyes and they can hear just fine with their ears, but they're not hearing with their heart and they're not seeing with their heart. And that's what the problem is. They have no faith to mix with the word that's coming from the Lord. Verse 14 says, "And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, by hearing ye shall hear and not understand, and seeing ye shall see and not perceive. For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; My there's a whole group of people in this world, brothers and sisters, that fit that category. &gt;&gt; And they claim Jesus Christ. They do. &gt;&gt; But there's a special group of people. And I believe he's talking to them. In verse 16, he says, "But blessed are your eyes, &gt;&gt; for they see, and your ears, for they hear. For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them, and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them. You know, as we read this, I just can't help but think even right now in the moment, Brother Brham would desire to be standing here on earth looking upon the word as we are tonight. Did you ever think about that? &gt;&gt; He wouldn't bring another word, but he would desire to be this far down the road because HE KNOWS HOW CLOSE &gt;&gt; HOW CLOSE THE COMING OF the Lord is. &gt;&gt; I picked up a little nuggie in one of the messages I'm going to bring tonight. It's just a little nugget. It's really interesting to to read it and and and I heard brother Brandham say it. I had to stop and rewind it and play it and stop and rewind it and play it. And I'm going to I'm going to get into it. But to think about the the position we are in time right at the very end. We know all of the prophets, all of the sages, all the people that believe Jesus would desire to see the word in the fullness that we have it here tonight. It's amazing to think about. But in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, "By hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and seeing you shall see and not perceive." Tonight, brothers and sisters, if we have faith, you can have anything you want. [laughter] &gt;&gt; If you have faith, you can have anything you want. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you haven't got faith, you can't receive nothing. &gt;&gt; Not brother Barry's words. That's the words of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; through a vindicated prophet to this age. &gt;&gt; If you have faith, you can have anything you want. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you haven't got faith, you can't receive nothing. Now, some people are going to have faith to have money and investments and portfolios, &gt;&gt; and that's going to do nothing for us when the fire falls. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If anything, it will potentially put us in the fire, and we'll have to do some refining. But some people want to have fame. Some people want to be influencers. Some people want their image everywhere. Some people just want to have ears to hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a heart to receive. &gt;&gt; If you have faith, you can have anything you want. &gt;&gt; And so here, when we have words like this, we're not talking about saying, "I just really want this and I just really want that." And he said that if I really wanted, I could have anything that I want if I could just maybe get enough faith. So, I'm just going to go to church and I'm going to I'm going to go and and hear hearing the word of God. I'm going to go to sleep playing the word and I'm going to I'm going to live my life playing the word. It's just going to be continually hearing the word of God so that I can have that kind of faith to get whatever I want. That's not what we're talking about at all. That's not at all what he's talking about. He's talking about if you have something that's a need in your life because he says, I I'll also supply all of your needs according to my riches in Christ Jesus. Right? &gt;&gt; Not the stuff that we think we want in this world. And this world is set up to make us think that we really need some stuff. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of stuff that we need. There's a lot of really cool gear that we need. There's a lot of maybe musical instruments that we need. Maybe there's clothing or cars or whatever. What do we really need? &gt;&gt; We really need the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the word of God will actually supply all of our needs. But if we have faith, we can have anything that we want. If you haven't got faith, you can't receive nothing. Because without faith, it's impossible to please God. If we're not going to please God, we're not going to see the results that we want. Because if we don't have faith, we're not going to have salvation. How can we have salvation without having faith? It's one of the biggest things. And then we can get into healing for our bodies. I think before we want healing in our bodies, we want healing in our souls. And isn't it interesting that that's what brother Brandham would say before he would talk to anybody, if you want healing in a prayer line, not just you want healing, okay, let's just make sure that you get good and healed. He would say no. Can you accept Jesus as your savior? &gt;&gt; Can you take him as your Lord first? &gt;&gt; First things first. But if we've got faith, you can have anything you want. And the things that you'll want will be according to the spirit of God. It won't be according to the lust of the flesh. We're not going to be like the scripture in James where we ask a miss because we ask according to the lust of our flesh or the lust of our eyes or the pride of our life. We're not going to do that. We're going to ask according to the spirit of God. You know, 1965 talking about faith. Really good. Really, really good. Works is faith expressed. This is a curveball. Sorry, buddy. One of those last minute inspirations. Notice Jesus has said only believe for all things are possible to them that believe. Faith and works are husband and wife. &gt;&gt; They work together. &gt;&gt; Faith and works are husband and wife. They work together. The husband works with the wife, the wife with the husband. &gt;&gt; They identify one another. &gt;&gt; They're not identifying themselves. We know that that love vaunteth not itself. It's not puffed up. It's not me and her. No, it's us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We know that our marriage here on earth is a type of our spiritual relationship with God. &gt;&gt; That's a quote. Brother Brandham says that. That's not just brother Barry. Brother Brandham says that. But here in this quote, he says, notice Jesus has said, "Only believe, for all things are possible to them that believe. Faith and works are husband and wife. They work together. The husband works with the wife, the wife with the husband. They identify one another. Like a man says he's married and yet he can't produce and show that he has a wife, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You doubt his claims. Mhm. Ma'am said, "I'm married." Where's your wife? Oh. Oh, I I don't know about that. See, see, he says be kind of hard thing for me to believe him. I I say, "Where's your wife?" "Well, I don't know. I I ain't going to believe it. So you see, if you have what you say you have, I have faith. How you going to show you got faith? How you going to show me you got faith? &gt;&gt; By your works. See, &gt;&gt; I'm married. How do I know you're married? This is my wife. See, there you are. I am married. This is my husband. I am healed. &gt;&gt; How do you know? My works show my faith. See now what what you're speaking of. Your faith is what God sees in you. &gt;&gt; Your works is what the other people see in you. &gt;&gt; God sees your faith. Yes. &gt;&gt; I think it's sometimes I think as a Christian we get that backwards. I know I have. I've thought that I need to try and show people my faith. I need to tell them about my faith. I need to express to them my faith. When probably really what I need to do is just show them my faith by the life that I live. I don't need to talk. I don't need to tell them I'm a Christian. I don't need to tell them I'm praying for this. I don't need to tell tell. Alls I need to do is live, live, live. &gt;&gt; According to the spirit that's living out through me, &gt;&gt; my works shows my faith. See &gt;&gt; now what you're speaking of. Your faith is what God sees in you. Your works is what other people see in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's for difference between James and Paul here explaining about Abraham. They never contradicted one another. They was both the same married. So is faith that doesn't produce works. Anyone has a right to doubt your testimony. &gt;&gt; So, we need to be careful if we're going to go and say, "I'm a Christian. I'm a Christian. I'm a Christian. I'm a message believer. This is me. This is me." The first time we stumble, they're going to be like, "Uh-huh. Look at you. You're just like everyone else." But when we actually just live our lives, I'm not saying don't witness. What I am saying is be careful how we witness. Sometimes I think when we try and express our faith to people sometimes what we do is we show them a fig leaf &gt;&gt; because it's our religion. It's the thing that covers us and it does. Someday I'm going to get into preaching it because God did make a covering. Brothers and sisters, when I say that all the time about a fig leaf, the fig leaf is the wrong covering, but God gave them the right covering. And that was under the blood of a shed animal &gt;&gt; under the covenant of bulls and goats &gt;&gt; right up until the cross right up until Calvary. That was the real deal. That's what God gave them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But another quote, the first one that I gave in the email tonight. Now, this is another one. This is out of Why Cry Speak? If you want to maybe hear where inspiration's coming from, it's just wonderful. out of why cry speak brother Brad I'm talking about Moses and how he was born he he he was born as a proper child he was born with a gift of faith great faith Moses had he says we see it after a while coming out in him brother Brandham says we see it coming out in him and how do we see it coming out in him many different ways there's a few different ways and we're going to probably get into it a little bit further but I just want to say this tonight brothers and sisters Remember, when we get over there, we're going to say, "How did you do it, Moses? &gt;&gt; How did you do it, Noah? How did you go up there on the hill and and beat on the wood and pitch it within and without and get all the animals and and and and David and Daniel and all of those heroes of the Bible?" And they're going to say, "Sh, how did you make it? How did you get through Le Oysia into the bride age? How did you get to the place where you could overcome all of the lid of hell being taken off and all of the temptation that could ever be poured out on this earth? You overcame it. &gt;&gt; HOW DID YOU get here? Tell us your testimony. &gt;&gt; Moses was born with a gift of faith. But I just can't help but think, brothers and sisters, we have been born with just as great a gift of faith &gt;&gt; to be able to believe the word in the day in which we live. This world is not set up for believers. &gt;&gt; This world is is a garden. It's a it's an Eden for unbelief. And that's where we are. That's what we're born into. But somehow someway, we have the ability to have ears to hear what the spirit says to the church. He goes on to say, "Moses being born with this great gift of faith, but then he was anointed and commissioned at the burning bush." Brothers and sisters, we have to have our own burning bush experience. &gt;&gt; It sounds so wonderful when we look at this because there is a time in his life where we know the whole Bible was written. He was commissioned. He was given such a great gift. He was a proper child when all the children Brother Brandham talks about in this message are being stabbed and thrown to the alligators out in the in the river. Can you imagine that? How his parents put him in the in the basket because he was a proper child. They knew that he was a fulfillment of scripture because he had a visitation by an angel. His dad, Moses' dad, remember? &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham gives that that description how they pushed him out into the into the river and the alligators were coming up. They thought, "Here comes another one." And we know, Brother Brandham said, "The angel of the Lord came and put his foot on top of that basket and said, "Not this one. You can have all the rest, but not this one. Uh-uh. Beat it." But Moses being born with this great gift, brothers and sisters, let's not put it off on Moses. What I want to do tonight is bring it right down home and remind us about the great gift that we have. And that is the gift of faith by the spirit that we're reading about. That is a gift. It's something that we have that is greater than anything we could ever receive in this life. The second best thing that we could ever get. Brother Brandham said, I would say the Lord said through brother Brandham, besides our salvation, besides the ability to have faith, to believe in our salvation is a wife. the greatest thing that we could ever get as a spouse. Tremendous to think about. But Moses being born with this great gift, I want to say tonight, uh, we're not going to add to or take away from, but let's just put our name in there. Put your name in there. Being born with this great gift of faith. Then he or she was anointed and commissioned at the appointed time of the father &gt;&gt; where there was a a burning bush experience where somehow someway the word of God just meant something more than it ever had before in their life and somehow someway they just had an experience. They had a new birth experience like we're talking about on Sunday. Brother Brandham, he says it very clearly what a new birth experience is like and we're going to get into it. But there are very clear identifiers about having a new birth. It is not just a feeling. It's not just an emotion. It's not an association. It's not anything like that. It is all about dying out to ourselves. The burning bush experience is what will set the faith of the father on fire in the life of a believer. It's not going to positionally drop a seed into the heart. Sometimes we hear it talked about that way. There's going to be a seed thrown and a seed thrown and a seed thrown and a seed thrown. The the planting is over. &gt;&gt; What we're looking at today is actually the harvest time. All of the seeds have been planted before the foundation of the world. They were planted. They were sown. And now the word of God through a vindicated prophet gets spoken. And somewhere along the way that time appointed of the father creates a burning bush experience in the life of a believer. So when we can put our name there and say so and so being born with this great gift of faith then he was anointed and commissioned at the word of a vindicated prophet &gt;&gt; because today that's our burning bush. That's why we look at the pillar of fire and say something different is about that picture where brother Brandham has that picture from the Sam Houston Coliseum. We all know that picture. &gt;&gt; That's way more than just God identifying himself with a man. That's showing that that pillar of fire, the same pillar of fire that came and stood right between the Egyptians and the children of Israel that night when Pharaoh's army wanted to destroy them. That same pillar of fire is identified in North America. &gt;&gt; And you know, if we had the ability to see it, maybe through some kind of specialized filter, and I pray, Lord, God, give us that specialized filter that we might be able to see that very same pillar of fire here in this building tonight &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT AIN'T NOTHING different than THE LORD JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And he's here tonight. We declared this meeting to be in his name. So there ain't one need in our midst that can stand in the way of his word. &gt;&gt; If we've got faith tonight, brothers and sisters, if we've got needs in our lives, then he's here to meet those needs. &gt;&gt; This isn't about just coming TO HEAR A GOOD WORD TO MAKE US FEEL GOOD AND SEND US on our way home. THIS IS TO CHANGE OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But put your name in there. being born with this great gift of faith. Then you was ANOINTED AND COMMISSIONED AT the burning bush to deliver God's people to lead your family. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To live your life before the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then tell someone about it &gt;&gt; because they say, "WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU? WHY ARE YOU SO STRANGE? I JUST FEEL SO good when I get around you. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES I'M SO ANGRY AND SO FRUSTRATED, BUT WHEN I GET around you, it just disappears. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Or why is it that people, they don't know that you're a Christian? They don't EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME, BUT THEY'LL start apologizing FOR SWEARING IN FRONT OF YOU. WHY? BECAUSE THAT PILLAR OF fire is with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Now, sees what great qualities this man had. I think it's so beautiful. As we go through the study of gifts, brothers and sisters, I want to remind us that that brother Brandham said it. Remember, he said it that every single praying church should have every single one of those gifts &gt;&gt; in their midst. &gt;&gt; So, I want to encourage us tonight to recognize that this is not something foreign. I'm not trying to present some new doctrine. I'm simply saying, "Hey, man, the word's saying it. &gt;&gt; Where do we stand tonight?" [laughter] I think it's so beautiful to think about this, though. Let's not put this off 2,000 years ago, 3,000 years ago into Moses day. Let's bring it right up to today. &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday, today, and forever after all. &gt;&gt; But this is in the message. Why cry? Speak. I just feel inspired. Brother Bradom, he talks about it in this message and [snorts] maybe we'll wind up reading a quote a little bit about it, but I don't know if I really captured any of those because I want to leave room for anointing. I don't want to just read a quote, read a quote, read a quote. We need anointed preaching. It has to be by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about in this message, &gt;&gt; Amen. how Moses had been shown himself by God so many infallible proofs of God's witness with him all the way along. The people saw it, too. But Moses himself had to realize there comes a point in time, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; where God's not going to push me through a pipe. He's not just going to keep doing things for me, parting the waters for me, making things happen for me. What he wants is for me to do it. &gt;&gt; Moses had to come to that realization for himself. In this message, brother Brandham says it, you know, talking about faith. Faith is the substance out of the amplified Bible in Hebrews 11:1. Now faith is the assurance, the confirmation, the title deed &gt;&gt; of the things we hope for being the proof of the things we do not see and the conviction of their reality. Faith perceived as real fact what is not revealed to the senses. So beautiful because that is a description of a new birth, isn't it? Faith that I am born again. Faith that I believe the word of God. Faith that I'm going to be in the resurrection. Faith that I'm going to be in the rapture. &gt;&gt; However God chooses for it to be is how it's going to be. But I just know I'm going to be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if I said to you tonight, can you explain to me how that's going to be? How you going to be there, Brother Tobiso? How's that going to work? can't explain it, &gt;&gt; but it's by faith that we believe it. &gt;&gt; We just do. &gt;&gt; And that's a gift. &gt;&gt; That's a gift from God. &gt;&gt; And it's so beautiful because the more we hear this word, the more it cements it in our heart. &gt;&gt; The more we believe it, the more strength we gain from it, the more faith we get as we go. &gt;&gt; Amen. But remember Hebrews 11:6, without faith it is impossible to please him. &gt;&gt; So I want to say it tonight, and I didn't even mean it for this, but I'm going to say it. When we come to a service, when we come expecting, when we come to worship, what are we doing? &gt;&gt; Who are we worshiping? &gt;&gt; What's our direction? Right? &gt;&gt; Are we worshiping by faith? &gt;&gt; Because if we're not worshiping by faith, we're missing the mark. &gt;&gt; We've got to have faith that we're worshiping the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. &gt;&gt; And I want to remind us the worst thing that could ever happen is for us to get hung up on something going on. &gt;&gt; That's the devil. &gt;&gt; Oh my. the brother singing beside me, he just can't hold a note in a bucket. Or maybe the the I'll just say it this way. Maybe the sister over there, she's got terrible breath. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THOSE THINGS, I JUST CAN'T WORSHIP. That's when you want to worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's the devil trying to stop you. &gt;&gt; It's not those people. &gt;&gt; We've been given this place to worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; If the piano plays a little fast, oh my, if the bass guitar gets a little bit loud, &gt;&gt; if if the sound guys miss a word, if you know, all of these things, brothers and sisters, are going to trip us up if we let them. &gt;&gt; But when we close our eyes and we raise our hands and we say, "I don't care who's watching. I'm not interested in any of that. I'm interested in the King OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS and the blessing THAT HE HAS IN STORE FOR me in this service right now tonight. &gt;&gt; When we're willing to do that, guess what? &gt;&gt; We're talking next level faith. &gt;&gt; We're not just going to church and going through formalities. We're going to actually change our bodies. Because remember, brothers and sisters, don't think that we're going to see a body change that's going to change the character. It's not going to work that way. WE'RE GOING TO SEE A CHARACTER change that's GOING TO CHANGE THE BODY. &gt;&gt; IF THE CHARACTER DOESN'T CHANGE, THERE AIN'T GOING TO BE a body change. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That old man's got to die. Every single speck of them &gt;&gt; and woman, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Without faith, it's impossible to please him. &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God must believe that he is Hebrews 13:8. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Just like he was for brother Brandham, he is for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, in this message, why cry speak? Brother Brandham tells the story about the woman who actually came with the baby who was sick. And the baby was crying and fussing. And the woman didn't have a seat, but she had a prayer card. And she's holding the baby, trying to keep the baby calm, and she can't keep the baby from crying and trying to calm this baby. And no doubt people are getting all upset because this baby this baby and they're trying to hear the word of God and they want to be prayed for too. But she's got a prayer card and there's a woman sitting there and she says, "You know, the Lord told me to pray for that baby." And she says, "It's crazy because God's prophet's on the stage. How could I be the one to pray for that baby? I'd be getting in the way of God's program. She's got a prayer card after all. Oh my." But it just keeps coming to her. Pray for that baby. Pray for that baby. pray for that baby. And we know that that woman finally couldn't resist it anymore. She couldn't hold back anymore. So what did she do? She got up and she said, "Sister, would you like to sit down? I can see that you're tired." And the woman said, "No, I don't want to take your seat." "No, no, no, no." And she said, "Please come and take my seat. Take your rest." So she did. And she said, "By the way, do you mind if I just pray for your baby?" And what happened? I'll tell you what happened. There was a burning bush experience right there BECAUSE THERE WAS FAITH THAT THAT LEADERSHIP IN MY heart was leading me to do something. It wasn't contrary to the word of God. IT WAS EXACTLY WITH the word of God. &gt;&gt; And what'd she do? She prayed for the baby. And that woman got called. The woman who prayed for the baby, she ran away. She went up into the second balcony at the very back of the auditorium. And what happened when that woman got called up? She said she prayed for that baby to get called up so that God's prophet could actually heal that baby, right? So that she could get prayed for properly by the one who had the ability. You know, that would be all I I'd be the same way. Like I [laughter] don't know if I have the faith. God's prophets right there. &gt;&gt; But what happened was the prophet discerned the whole situation. And and better yet, IT WAS GOD IN THE PROPHET that discerned that situation. And he said, "That woman that WENT UP INTO THE SECOND BALCONY, SHE ALREADY PRAYED FOR your baby and YOUR BABY'S HEALED BECAUSE of it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why cry? Speak, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Speak by that faith that's in your life. &gt;&gt; It's not about the other people. It's all about you. &gt;&gt; It's so interesting, isn't it? In a world of entitlement, in a world of narcissism, honestly, brothers and sisters, that is where we're at. This is all about me. &gt;&gt; But it's not about me. It's about the Lord Jesus Christ in me. &gt;&gt; And because of that, I'm entitled to every single PROMISE THAT'S IN THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; EVERY CHAPTER, every verse, every line belongs to me. &gt;&gt; In the age of entitlement, not entitlement worldly stuff. It's interesting to see it though because the natural types the spiritual, doesn't it? Think about the sons and daughters of God. how much entitlement we really have. &gt;&gt; It's unreal. &gt;&gt; In Habac 2:4, it says, "Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him, but the just, the just shall live by his faith." &gt;&gt; Brother Brham, he says this. We still got 15 minutes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We might get through these quotes here tonight. God has got a purpose of you being here. &gt;&gt; He says, "See, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; if you can only be get to that place, how much trouble you save God &gt;&gt; and yourself." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine he's saying this? How much trouble you can save God. We could save God trouble. [laughter] My Lord help me. [sighs] We could save God trouble and ourselves too. Why cry? Speak. [snorts] He says in another one, Moses borned and then he was afterwards he was brought to the place where he was anointed. And you know brothers and sisters, it's the same thing for us. When we get born again, there comes a place where we get born again. We get the spirit of God. We have got to be positionally placed in our inheritance and that is to be solidified in the Holy Ghost and having the Holy Ghost solidified in our lives. And what is that, brothers and sisters? It's not just being anointed by the Holy Spirit. It's actually the literal life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that is what the message of the hour goes to. &gt;&gt; And some people shy right away from that. Even message ministry for some reason. I don't know why, but they do. They shy away from the person of Jesus Christ because we know the baptism of the Holy Ghost gives way to the person of Jesus Christ. That's an exact quote. &gt;&gt; That's an exact quote. But he says here, Moses born and then he was afterwards he was brought to the place where he was anointed. And notice the seed laying there with an intellectual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver this people. And yet it never come to life until that light from the burning bush flashed across it. &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; That same light has got to flash across that seed in our lives. And when that happens, it changes us. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not just intellectual. That word of God has made the longest journey that it will ever go right from here to here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The longest journey in a human's life. It's gone. And he says, "And notice that seed laying there with an intellectual conception and with all the faith that he was born to deliver this people. And yet it never come to life until that light from the burning bush flashed across it. until he seen not something he read about. I just as I read these, as I was studying this, I was thinking, man, not just something that we've read about, not just something that we've heard, not just something even that we say, but something that literally happens inside our life. It causes us to have a new birth. There's a new birth that comes to life inside of us, just like Mary. And that life is only one life. It's not a hybrid life. But many times we can present it to look like that because we mix it with something else. We have something other than just the pure word of God, the pure message for our day. But until that light from the burning bush flashed across it, until that light from that pillar of fire flashes across it, brothers and sisters, we're just going to have intellectualism. &gt;&gt; We're going to have knowledge. And you know what? We might even have wisdom. But it doesn't matter if we have both of those, does it? Now that we've gone on to faith in the gifts to recognize without faith, it's impossible to please God. We can have all the knowledge. We can have all the wisdom, all the wisdom, and how to actually apply the knowledge, [laughter] but we're not going to please God with it. &gt;&gt; We're going to know all the quotes. We're going to have GONE TO ALL THE PLACES. WE MIGHT EVEN HAVE A BELT BUCKLE, but we're NOT GOING TO PLEASE GOD UNLESS WE'VE GOT FAITH. RIGHT. That's right. It had to flash across it until he seen not something he read about, but something he seen with his eyes. &gt;&gt; Something that spoke to him. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And he spoke back to it. [gasps] &gt;&gt; That's why we come to church, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Not just to have something speak to us, but to speak back to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the more we speak back to it, the more it speaks to us. It's the way it works. I love the way Brother Andrew Glover said it. You know, it's like the old time saws, right? The pushpull saw. You have an end and I have an end and you pull and then I pull and I push and you push. And as we do this, we actually do it together. It's the way it works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it. Oh, how that did bring things to life. And it's the same today. It ain't no different tonight at Calgary Living Word. Something speaks to us and we speak back. Something spoke to Mary and she spoke back. &gt;&gt; She said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." &gt;&gt; The messenger the the the angel messenger brought a message from the presence of God and said, "You're you're highly favored among the women." Remember, the feminine is the church. The female is the bride. The bride can only take the word as he gives it. But when she does, the intimacy happens and there is conception. &gt;&gt; Romans 1 verse 17 says, "For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, the just shall live by faith." &gt;&gt; Yes. The just shall live by faith. Brother Brandham, he goes on in this message. Why cry speak? He says, "I think any man with a or woman, boy or girl, and I think in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth, never can have a full foundation stand until they have met that light that brings that word to a reality. No man, no woman Brothers and sisters, the new birth is not optional. &gt;&gt; That's brother Barry's heart. &gt;&gt; The new birth is not optional. And the new birth is messy. Brother Bradom talks about it. How the birth is messy. It doesn't matter whether you're in the finest of hospital or whether you're in a pig pen. It's a mess. &gt;&gt; A birth is a mess. And to think that we can have some way around it. Maybe there's going to be another way. I don't have to have any tears. I don't have to have any emotion. I don't have to have any feeling. I can just say, "Bless God. Amen. I believe." Sure you can. But have you been born again? &gt;&gt; Have we received his spirit since we believe? &gt;&gt; That's the new birth, brothers and sisters. It's not just saying that I believe God sent a prophet. That I just believe that Jesus was was crucified, that he he was he was he was killed, he was buried, he rose again, and and bless God, I'm saved. That's not the new birth. Once upon a time, it was. And we know that brother Brandham says it that God wked at that for years and years. But now we've been given that word that prophets and sages have desired to look upon and we just have it in abundance. &gt;&gt; There's no shortcuts. It's the same today. We've got to be born again. Oh, I can't get away from that thought. It's so beautiful. He goes on to say, "I think no church in its practice, no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be, and I'll say it this way, how close to the message it might be. If it's lukewarm, formal, and powerless, it's problematic. &gt;&gt; It can have all the quotes. It can have all the music. But if it's one word off, it's Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; EVEN IF IT'S CALLED THE MESSAGE, That's what brother Brandham said. They'll never ever denominate this message. They'll never ever denominate this. They can't because it's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But I think no church in its practice, no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be, that church cannot thrive until the supernatural is made known among THAT PEOPLE &gt;&gt; AND THEY SEE IT. the prophet's words, not mine. &gt;&gt; So, brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; I want to say it tonight. &gt;&gt; Have you seen it? &gt;&gt; Have you seen it? &gt;&gt; Because if you haven't seen it, I'm not scolding you. I'M ENCOURAGING YOU. TAKE A LOOK. &gt;&gt; LOOK AWAY TO JESUS. HE'S STILL HERE. THERE'S STILL TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But if we're intellectual, you know, we meet people. I meet people, lots of people. They've got theology degrees and and they've got doctorates in in different disciplines and they're very intellectual, &gt;&gt; but you never see them just get really into the spirit of THINGS LIKE THE PROPHET SAID. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; My I'm not trying to scold but what I am saying is brothers and sisters DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT ANYONE ELSE IS THINKING. Only worry about what he's thinking AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU'VE GOT THAT NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Cuz the death angel is passing through the land. &gt;&gt; He's already in the land passing through the land. You know, we we were talking about this and I can't get away from this thought either. You know that uh the mark of the beast is coming. Sure enough, it's coming. The mark of the beast. And I know it's scary for some people, maybe especially for children. But I want us to rest assured, you don't have to worry about the mark of the beast. If you get the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; IF YOU GET THAT PILLAR OF FIRE EXPERIENCE, that has nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IF YOU REJECT THAT, YOU ALREADY HAVE the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; How do you have it? I'll tell you how. You were born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come into the world speaking lies. came into this world contrary to the way that God said it should happen according to the spoken word being the original seed. We all came into the world. None of us desired to come to this world. Did anybody here today say, "I want to go to earth. I want to be born in this family in this place." And I know that there's some weird doctrine out there that says, "Did you know that you choose your own parents?" [laughter] I love my parents very much. So, I pick the best. But you know, NONE OF US CHOSE TO COME HERE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; We're all born in sin, shed of iniquity, come in this world speaking lies. That's that's the way it is. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But because of that, all of us have just a little bit of Cain's DNA &gt;&gt; in this flesh. &gt;&gt; And that's why that is exactly the reason, brothers and sisters, why this flesh will not inherit incorruption. That is the reason that this God we're talking about, this pillar of fire, the Lord Jesus Christ, he has a brand new body waiting for us. &gt;&gt; I think, Brother Barry, can you imagine what it would be like to not have a a a messed up knee? What it would be like to not have a a a fat belly? What it' be like to not have a big nose? Maybe be gassy? All of these human traits that we have as human beings. What will it be like to not be that way? TO HAVE A PERFECT BODY, A MATURE BODY, A BODY THE way that he CREATED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. THAT'S what we're going to have. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; Worry about the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Worry about that pillar of fire experience. Have that burning bush moment. And if you ever want it and you just don't know that you got it, brothers and sisters, come and ask. &gt;&gt; Come and ask the Lord Jesus Christ. pour out your spirit upon me like I've never had it and see if he WON'T DO IT. SOME MIGHT SAY, "OH, brother Barry, now you're trying to GET PENTECOSTAL." WHAT I AM saying is, brothers and sisters, it's too late to play church. &gt;&gt; This is all about getting the Holy Ghost in our LIVES AND GIVING HIM the preeminence to do what he wills according to his word. &gt;&gt; And if you think maybe I am trying to put this on, I'll just read this quote again here as we close. I'll bring the musicians up. Call the musicians. Thank you very much. But brother Bradam, he says, "I think no church in its practice, no matter how intellectual, how fundamental it might be, that church cannot thrive until the supernatural is made known among that people and they see it. Something that they can talk to that will talk back to them that vindicates this written word." [laughter] &gt;&gt; I love it. I love it. Maybe stand with me as we close tonight. Sorry if I seem like I'm a little bit excited, but this gets me excited. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This does it for me. This is what does it for me. &gt;&gt; I I get excited about a lot of things in life, but nothing like this. &gt;&gt; This This is This is for us, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of world that are trying to actually make this stuff happen. But for some reason, God chose us to have ears to hear the word that he gave to his vindicated prophet so that we could be partakers of this word that all of the ages, the the sages and and elders desired to see. We just can see it. It's amazing. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, and to think about you said it, Lord, through your prophet that every single church ought to see these gifts. And Lord, every single church ought to see the supernatural in their midst and be able to see it. Not just say that it's here, but to see it. &gt;&gt; Father, we're not seeking signs. We just want to get in line with your word. Father, your prophet said this word &gt;&gt; and that's our desire is to see your word &gt;&gt; in our lives in our midst. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to yield to you. Father, &gt;&gt; in all of our actions, in all of our thoughts, in all of our behaviors, Lord, &gt;&gt; help us to have faith, Lord, that you will and do according to your good purpose in our lives. Oh father, we don't have to worry about services and how they happen because if we truly have faith and if we truly surrender ourselves unto you, then you will do what you want. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you will receive all of the glory and all of the honor and all of the praise, &gt;&gt; oh father. And if there's something wrong, you will tell us. YOU'LL SHOW US. We don't have to be afraid. Father, I just rebuke that spirit of fear in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh, Father, and I loose your spirit, Lord, of faith in our midst, Lord, that we would be able to have the wisdom and the knowledge, Father, to know, oh, Father, what to do with your word because of the faith inside of us, which is literally your life. Father, tonight, I pray that you would bless each one. Oh, Father, as we've gathered together in your name and we have to go our separate ways, I pray that you would just keep your hand upon us tenderly, Lord, as we go our separate ways. Father, we pray for those who are traveling, Lord. I think of brother Logan and Sister Neve. Oh father the oh o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d doo's lord, brother Toby and sister faith, Lord Jesus, brother John, father, each one who is traveling, Lord, and away we pray that you would just keep your hand upon them and give them traveling mercies. Lord, bring them back home safely at the appointed time. We ask and Father, if it be your will for us to gather again on Sunday, Lord, we'll come. And [music] Father, we'll we'll come willing, Father, to meet with that pillar of fire, to meet with that burning bush, Lord. Oh, Father, to have that supernatural light flash across that seed gene of God in our lives, Father. That it would come to life, Lord. And that it would have, oh Father, the manifestation that you desire, Lord Jesus. I pray that you would just be glorified now as we sing a few songs before we go our separate ways. We love you and we thank you. We just ask [music] all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music] Amen. Can we sing 284? He is our peace. He is our peace.
