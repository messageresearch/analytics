[0:07] two Fridays ago I was
[0:10] just a reflection on the week thinking
[0:13] about all the victory God has given us
[0:15] and for me particularly at work at fish
[0:17] some interesting situations uh people
[0:20] trying to
[0:22] um
[0:23] or set some influences with the ought to
[0:24] not do that and uh but the Christian you
[0:28] know we take God to work every day
[0:30] and then um but God gave me a big
[0:32] victory in that space that I could not
[0:34] even imagine and then I started
[0:36] reflecting and thought about all the
[0:38] ways that God shows up for us fighting
[0:40] all of our battles and these words are
[0:43] such a testimony to that fact
