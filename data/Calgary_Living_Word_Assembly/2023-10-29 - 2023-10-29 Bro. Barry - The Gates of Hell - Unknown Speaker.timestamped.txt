[1:01:05] verses here we'll start with verse
[1:01:10] 13 when Jesus came into the coast of
[1:01:12] cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples
[1:01:15] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[1:01:18] man am amen and they said some say that
[1:01:22] thou art John the Baptist Sam elas and
[1:01:25] others jeremias or one of the prophets
[1:01:29] and he saith unto them but whom say ye
[1:01:32] that I
[1:01:33] am and Simon Peter answered and said
[1:01:37] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:01:38] Living God and Jesus answered and said
[1:01:41] unto him blessed art thou Simon bar
[1:01:44] Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not
[1:01:47] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[1:01:50] which is in
[1:01:51] heaven and I say also unto thee that
[1:01:54] thou art Peter and Upon This Rock will I

[1:02:20] remain and father we pray that it would
[1:02:22] just be more than words that we speak we
[1:02:24] pray that it would even be more than
[1:02:26] words that we hear pray that it would be
[1:02:29] our very life that it wouldn't be our
[1:02:31] life Lord but your life living out

[1:03:10] anything yet but I will now I just want
[1:03:15] to
[1:03:17] clarify bear with me for a second
[1:03:20] here yes okay so we have very verified
[1:03:25] that uh

[1:03:30] 18th 2024 we have Andrew Glover booked
[1:03:35] he will be here so the 16th the 17th and
[1:03:39] the 18th last time we had two services
[1:03:41] this time we'll have three so if you
[1:03:44] want maybe just Mark that in your
[1:03:45] calendars we'll have it on the church
[1:03:47] calendar but I wanted to make sure that
[1:03:49] we confirmed that's confirmed we will
[1:03:52] have uh our second annual meetings with
[1:03:54] brother Andrew Glover are you happy this
[1:03:57] morning amen we will have a gym night on
[1:04:00] Tuesday night it's for those people who
[1:04:02] want something to do with their children
[1:04:04] on the night when uh everyone runs
[1:04:06] around and celebrates the devil we're
[1:04:09] going to get together as Believers and
[1:04:11] just have a little bit of fun so that
[1:04:13] will be Tuesday night if you have any
[1:04:15] questions about where and when just let
[1:04:17] us know and we'll certainly make sure
[1:04:19] you have that information we have a
[1:04:20] communion service booked for November
[1:04:22] the 12th so you can cancel that in as
[1:04:25] well if you would like talking about our
[1:04:29] scripture this morning I just felt so
[1:04:32] inspired after our Wednesday service I I
[1:04:35] just I'm so excited to continue on I
[1:04:37] wanted to get into the church AG book
[1:04:38] this morning but I feel like I just want
[1:04:41] to keep that to Wednesdays but it's
[1:04:43] going to spill over there's no way
[1:04:44] around it it's the word of God and I
[1:04:46] hope it's okay today I want to talk
[1:04:48] about the gates of hell we touched on it
[1:04:50] a little bit on on Wednesday and it's so
[1:04:52] important for us to recognize
[1:04:54] that this world basically the way it's
[1:04:56] set up civilization is of the devil is
[1:04:59] what the prophet for our day said and I
[1:05:01] would say that even more so than just
[1:05:03] the prophet for our day said that that's
[1:05:05] what God Said through the prophet is
[1:05:07] that Civilization is of the devil and we
[1:05:10] know we don't have to look very far in
[1:05:11] Genesis the Book of Genesis that it
[1:05:13] wasn't it wasn't uh Seth and his company
[1:05:17] his people his family that went ahead
[1:05:19] and created civilization they were sheep
[1:05:21] herders they were farmers they actually
[1:05:23] lived their lives differently but it was
[1:05:25] Cain's race that went out and started to
[1:05:28] build cities so when we look around at
[1:05:30] this world we can say this world is the
[1:05:33] kingdom of Satan and we know that the
[1:05:36] prophet for our day declared this is the
[1:05:38] only age where Satan is declared the God
[1:05:41] of this evil age and because of that I
[1:05:44] just want to say it this way we can look
[1:05:46] at everything that's in this world
[1:05:48] outside of the message of the hour
[1:05:49] outside of the word of God I'll say it
[1:05:52] this way the wise virgins and the Oswin
[1:05:54] virgins the 144,000 over in Israel even
[1:05:58] right now today outside of those this
[1:06:00] whole world is a Gate of Hell this whole
[1:06:04] world is set up to draw people to hell
[1:06:08] that's the reason why the world is in
[1:06:09] the condition that it's in there's
[1:06:11] nothing else that's going to take people
[1:06:13] to Heaven except for this message of the
[1:06:15] hour a and those people that maybe have
[1:06:18] the ability to give their life because
[1:06:20] they refus this message of the hour seal
[1:06:23] their own testimony with their own blood
[1:06:26] because that's what's going to take
[1:06:27] place the next steps are the Rapture of
[1:06:29] the Church of the Living God the the the
[1:06:32] the foolish virgin the unwise Virgin is
[1:06:35] going to be left here and they're going
[1:06:36] to have to give their lives for their
[1:06:38] testimony right because they refused the
[1:06:40] word for their
[1:06:42] day and then the 144,000 those little
[1:06:46] Benjamins were where Joseph cried out
[1:06:49] remember he cried out for only one thing
[1:06:52] it was to find out about about Benjamin
[1:06:54] and when he heard that Benjamin still
[1:06:56] was alive he cried out so loud that the
[1:07:00] house of of Egypt heard him the house of
[1:07:03] pharaoh heard him crying wondering why
[1:07:05] what's wrong with this guy it was the
[1:07:07] passion his love for those 144,000 and
[1:07:11] it's going to be the same thing I know
[1:07:12] I'm mixing the two together but it's
[1:07:13] just where I'm at this morning I just I
[1:07:15] think it's so in incredible to look at
[1:07:17] the where we're at in the sands of time
[1:07:19] brothers and
[1:07:20] sisters my there's not much time left
[1:07:24] yes so I just want to say today I want
[1:07:27] to talk about the gates of
[1:07:30] hell but we can say it this way many
[1:07:33] people talk about the message of the
[1:07:34] hour and and many people talk about God
[1:07:37] sent a prophet and many people talk
[1:07:39] maybe even today about Joseph Bram and
[1:07:41] maybe Billy Paul Bram and all that there
[1:07:43] is to have to do with the Brams that's
[1:07:46] that's that's good and I believe that's
[1:07:48] that's potentially similar to our
[1:07:50] scripture today where we could say you
[1:07:52] know God sent a prophet and and we could
[1:07:54] say God's Prophet had a family and and
[1:07:56] they had a great ministry and they did
[1:07:58] so much for the body of Christ but who
[1:08:01] do you say this message of the hour is
[1:08:04] that's what I want to say today who do
[1:08:05] you say this message of the hour
[1:08:08] declares because if it declares a
[1:08:10] prophet then we've missed the
[1:08:13] point the prophet came to declare he's
[1:08:18] here not that he's
[1:08:20] coming that he's
[1:08:22] here and he's not going to be coming
[1:08:25] right until Revelations
[1:08:28] 19 and that's when every eye will see
[1:08:31] him and even those who pierced
[1:08:34] him of the House of Israel that's not
[1:08:38] the Rapture Revelations 19 if that's
[1:08:40] what we're looking towards then we've
[1:08:41] missed what's going on right now just
[1:08:43] like in Jesus day how many people
[1:08:45] recognize that he was Messiah how many
[1:08:49] people recognize that he was truly God
[1:08:51] in flesh that's right very very few
[1:08:54] people and even his disciples didn't
[1:08:57] recognize it only one out of 12 was able
[1:09:00] to say thou art the Christ the son of
[1:09:02] the Living God Amen but what is it that
[1:09:05] Jesus said to
[1:09:06] him he said oh first we're going to
[1:09:09] change your name you're no longer going
[1:09:11] to be called Simon
[1:09:13] barjona you're going to be called Peter
[1:09:16] right because Upon This Rock we're going
[1:09:19] to build the foundation of the church
[1:09:21] and the Gates of Hell aren't going to be
[1:09:23] able to prevail against it we'll get
[1:09:24] into this on on Wednesday I'm sure it
[1:09:26] it'll be just a blending like I've said
[1:09:28] but you know how brother bam talks about
[1:09:29] in the church age book The Church wants
[1:09:32] to put it on on on Peter being the rock
[1:09:35] the foundation of the church and they're
[1:09:37] missing what's happened in the scripture
[1:09:39] they're not reading between the lines
[1:09:40] and the only way we're going to read
[1:09:41] between the lines is to have spiritual
[1:09:43] Revelation the only way we're going to
[1:09:44] have spiritual Revelation is to get the
[1:09:45] Holy Ghost in our lives without the Holy
[1:09:47] Ghost this is just going to be another
[1:09:49] book it's just going to be H H maybe
[1:09:51] stories and and maybe some some enlight
[1:09:53] lightening words and we'll say my
[1:09:55] goodness it's a tremendous thing but
[1:09:57] it's a hard saying who can actually live
[1:09:59] that but boy once we get the Holy Ghost
[1:10:02] In Our Lives then we're going to say my
[1:10:03] it becomes a living word and I can see
[1:10:05] that word is coming to life in my life
[1:10:07] and you know what maybe I don't see
[1:10:08] exactly what I want to see in my life
[1:10:10] but I know I don't see all the things
[1:10:12] that I used to see in my life so we have
[1:10:14] an opportunity to say praise God I know
[1:10:16] I'm on a journey amen and remember
[1:10:19] brothers and sisters we're in a one room
[1:10:20] Schoolhouse here everyone is at a
[1:10:22] different level spiritually speaking
[1:10:25] some people are spiritual Giants right
[1:10:28] and some people are babes in Christ and
[1:10:31] you know what we're not going to judge
[1:10:35] anyone the spiritual Giants I want to
[1:10:38] say this this is just maybe my view
[1:10:41] forgive me if it seems to be a little
[1:10:42] too far but I believe the spiritual
[1:10:44] Giants should be the ones that are
[1:10:46] picking up the ones that are stumbling
[1:10:48] and falling down and saying hey let me
[1:10:50] give you a hand let me give you a help
[1:10:51] up let me help you along the way way
[1:10:53] because I can see that you're struggling
[1:10:55] not judging them and saying oh my they
[1:10:57] should be doing this differently look at
[1:10:59] those people why do they behave that way
[1:11:02] that's not the spirit of
[1:11:04] Christ it's only by grace that we're
[1:11:06] saved through faith and if we have that
[1:11:10] Faith to be safe then we have the faith
[1:11:11] to be healed
[1:11:13] amen but what's what's the most
[1:11:15] important healing that we could ever
[1:11:16] have brothers and sisters it's not this
[1:11:18] flesh this flesh has to perish this
[1:11:21] flesh has to go this flesh is our enemy
[1:11:23] this flesh is not ever going to do us
[1:11:25] any
[1:11:26] good the greatest healing that we could
[1:11:28] ever have is the healing of our
[1:11:31] soul this word for this day applied in
[1:11:34] our lives
[1:11:36] amen but I just think it's
[1:11:38] beautiful Jesus speaking here God
[1:11:40] speaking in flesh we know that Jesus was
[1:11:44] all of the godhead made bodily amen the
[1:11:48] entirety of God in flesh Amen in front
[1:11:51] of man speaking to man man so that men
[1:11:55] could
[1:11:56] comprehend just a little fraction but he
[1:11:59] said blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah
[1:12:02] for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[1:12:05] unto thee but my Father which is in
[1:12:07] heaven and I say also unto thee that
[1:12:11] thou art Peter so remember he's given
[1:12:13] him a name change and Upon This Rock I
[1:12:18] will build my
[1:12:19] church and so that's where the church is
[1:12:22] that's the Baseline that's the that's
[1:12:23] the foundation of it a and we're not
[1:12:25] going to say it like the Catholic Church
[1:12:27] would say that that that that the church
[1:12:30] would God would build his church on a a
[1:12:32] foundation of a man who would be so
[1:12:34] unstable that he would Curse God and lie
[1:12:37] while he did it the church isn't built
[1:12:40] on a man on this flesh that has to
[1:12:43] perish on a hybrid condition the church
[1:12:46] isn't built on that it's the rock of
[1:12:48] Revelation amen it's the rock of
[1:12:51] Revelation that the church is built upon
[1:12:54] and what is that rock of Revelation it's
[1:12:56] Christ God himself making himself known
[1:12:59] personally to the
[1:13:02] individual but I want to say it this way
[1:13:04] I want to bring it home a little further
[1:13:05] than that brothers and sisters we're too
[1:13:07] far along the road to say that you know
[1:13:08] I was saved back in 1953 and and that's
[1:13:12] good I'm saved I I I know that I've met
[1:13:14] God back there I had an experience and
[1:13:16] it was great and and now I just come to
[1:13:18] church and I just Skip Along the water
[1:13:22] I'm being told Maybe by the church or
[1:13:24] I'm being towed Maybe by someone else's
[1:13:26] experience and maybe it's a husband and
[1:13:28] wife maybe the wife is Towing the
[1:13:29] husband and maybe the husband is just
[1:13:30] Towing the wife maybe the church is just
[1:13:32] toing both brothers and sisters it's not
[1:13:34] about that at all it's about having that
[1:13:36] constant refreshing of the Holy Ghost in
[1:13:38] our lives where he's talking to us every
[1:13:41] day of Our Lives where we're having our
[1:13:43] own spiritual Revelation every single
[1:13:45] day where that rock of Revelation is
[1:13:48] fresh every single day in our lives and
[1:13:51] I think it's beautiful because why did
[1:13:52] he use that expression that if we don't
[1:13:54] cry out then the rocks will immediately
[1:13:57] cry out maybe it's those rocks of
[1:13:59] Revelation in the hearts of the
[1:14:00] Believers that just can't contain it I
[1:14:02] recognize what he's done for me it's
[1:14:05] only by his grace that I'm
[1:14:08] saved but it's that rock of
[1:14:11] Revelation that did it for Peter and
[1:14:15] where did that rock of Revelation come
[1:14:16] from that came from God Amen came from
[1:14:19] God directly to him and Jesus being God
[1:14:22] in flesh saying hey hey you know what
[1:14:24] that that actually didn't come from man
[1:14:26] no teacher taught you that no school
[1:14:28] taught you that your parents no
[1:14:29] tradition nothing outside of a
[1:14:32] supernatural revelation God spoke to
[1:14:34] your heart directly Peter a and and
[1:14:37] changed your name in doing it amen such
[1:14:40] a beautiful thought you know brother
[1:14:42] bradam I I a lot of the message today I
[1:14:45] guess that I got inspired by was
[1:14:48] possessing the Gate of the enemy after
[1:14:51] trial in 1964 4 it's 0322 possessing the
[1:14:57] Gate of the enemy after trial and you
[1:15:01] know thinking about the gates of hell
[1:15:02] and how the Gates of Hell want to try
[1:15:05] and Prevail against us they definitely
[1:15:08] do or Jesus wouldn't have said those
[1:15:10] words that wouldn't have been recorded
[1:15:12] in the Bible that the Gates of Hell will
[1:15:14] not Prevail against it and you know it's
[1:15:16] not going to not Prevail against a
[1:15:18] church it's not going to not Prevail
[1:15:20] against a family teaching or or an
[1:15:22] ideology or even a pet Doctrine it's not
[1:15:25] going to do any of that it's not going
[1:15:26] to Prevail against that personal
[1:15:28] relationship with Jesus Christ and
[1:15:31] that's why we have to have the Holy
[1:15:32] Ghost in our lives a continual renewing
[1:15:34] and we can say just like David said this
[1:15:37] is the refreshing every single day when
[1:15:39] we go on our knees this is the
[1:15:41] refreshing every single time we come to
[1:15:43] church and we worship we have the
[1:15:44] opportunity to worship we're going to
[1:15:46] say this is the refreshing this is
[1:15:48] something that I need in my life it just
[1:15:50] washes me it's the preaching of the word
[1:15:52] but brother and sisters it's also being
[1:15:54] able to worship God
[1:15:56] freely there's millions of people around
[1:15:58] the world that would love to be able to
[1:16:00] raise their hands and cl raise their
[1:16:02] hands and and and Shout with their voice
[1:16:04] and clap their hands and sing rejoicing
[1:16:06] Praises unto the Lord Jesus Christ as a
[1:16:08] Christian yes and we have the ability to
[1:16:11] do
[1:16:12] it amen it's amazing to
[1:16:15] think you know I just I just uh I look
[1:16:18] this up Strong's gate uh g443 n and and
[1:16:23] maybe it's a little bit much for me to
[1:16:25] do this but I I just sometimes I like to
[1:16:27] look into it and and it says the a gate
[1:16:30] that is the leaf or wing of a folding
[1:16:33] entrance pretty simple isn't it and we
[1:16:36] know that that's how Gates operate they
[1:16:38] open they close a and and how can a gate
[1:16:41] Prevail the only way that a gate can
[1:16:43] Prevail is that it will either stop us
[1:16:45] from going in or that it will open to us
[1:16:48] and allow us to go in that's the only
[1:16:51] thing a gate can do it's is not going to
[1:16:53] be able to do anything else but it's
[1:16:55] it's the leaf or wing of a folding
[1:16:58] entrance and I couldn't help but think
[1:17:00] just maybe my way of thinking but the
[1:17:02] leaf or a wing of a folding entrance to
[1:17:05] think about those fallen angels that
[1:17:07] potentially had wings they want to open
[1:17:11] their their entrance and try and draw
[1:17:13] many people in with them to know that
[1:17:16] that they're going to actually have a
[1:17:17] little bit of success but to the
[1:17:19] Believers there's no success to the
[1:17:21] unbelievers there's a tremendous success
[1:17:24] so to make Believers it's kind of uh
[1:17:27] it's kind of Hit or Miss but we don't
[1:17:28] want to put anybody in or or put anybody
[1:17:31] out we just want to say that it's only
[1:17:33] by grace that we're saved through faith
[1:17:36] it's just a wonderful thing thinking
[1:17:38] about this this uh gate how a gate can
[1:17:41] be an entrance it just brought me to the
[1:17:43] scripture in in second Peter 1 if you
[1:17:45] want to turn there with me this morning
[1:17:47] just as we set a little background as we
[1:17:50] get
[1:17:51] going and second
[1:17:55] Peter second Peter chapter
[1:17:58] 1 verse
[1:18:03] 10 I think this speaks directly to us in
[1:18:06] our day it's not a time to play church
[1:18:09] and and and just be one way in church
[1:18:12] and another way at home and this is the
[1:18:14] time to make sure that we know where we
[1:18:16] stand amen hallelujah in second Peter
[1:18:19] 1:10 it says wherefore the rather
[1:18:22] brethren give
[1:18:24] diligence to make your calling and
[1:18:26] election sure for if you do these things
[1:18:29] you shall never
[1:18:31] fall so I want to say this if you you
[1:18:34] know for the sake of time I'm just going
[1:18:36] to read that part of it I'm not going to
[1:18:37] go back but I would recommend go back
[1:18:39] and read a little further and see
[1:18:42] there's a list of things that if you do
[1:18:44] it says you won't
[1:18:46] fall and here we have this you shall
[1:18:48] never fall we we can understand this to
[1:18:51] make our own calling and election sure
[1:18:54] to make sure that we we understand where
[1:18:56] we stand and you know to look at the
[1:18:58] natural brother bradam says the natural
[1:19:00] always types the spiritual if we do that
[1:19:03] if we look at Israel the children of
[1:19:05] Israel right now how many of those
[1:19:07] people are making their own calling and
[1:19:09] election sure and maybe the same thing
[1:19:12] in Palestine we're we're not going to
[1:19:14] say one thing about one or the other one
[1:19:16] way or the other but what I'm saying is
[1:19:18] the people in this war maybe Russia and
[1:19:20] Ukraine all these people that are
[1:19:21] involved in the war they're going to be
[1:19:23] getting up in the morning and they're
[1:19:24] going to be knowing where they stand
[1:19:25] they're going to make their calling and
[1:19:26] election sure because in any moment they
[1:19:28] could have a bomb or a gun hit them and
[1:19:31] and take them out they could die they're
[1:19:33] going to be making sure they know where
[1:19:35] they stand and if you ever see any
[1:19:37] videos of the Israelis right now they're
[1:19:40] they're dancing and singing they're
[1:19:41] praising the Lord before they go into
[1:19:44] battle there's like a hundred men in a
[1:19:46] circle and they're jumping around
[1:19:48] sometimes it's two or three circles and
[1:19:50] they're worshiping Jehovah they're
[1:19:51] worshiping calling upon Messiah it makes
[1:19:54] me wonder where are we as the Church of
[1:19:56] the Living God today as the Believers
[1:19:59] the elected the called out few yes
[1:20:02] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[1:20:04] diligence to make your calling and
[1:20:06] election sure for if you do these things
[1:20:08] you shall never fall for so an entrance
[1:20:11] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[1:20:14] into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[1:20:16] and Savior Jesus Christ amen we have the
[1:20:21] Gates of Hell swinging and Laing in the
[1:20:23] breeze all over the place in this world
[1:20:25] that we're living in but we don't have
[1:20:26] to live in fear we've been given an
[1:20:28] instruction we know that there is a
[1:20:30] tremendous opportunity for us and that's
[1:20:33] why we gather this way so that we could
[1:20:35] be Washed by the Water of the word it's
[1:20:36] because we believe we want to show whose
[1:20:38] side we're on amen amen hallelujah out
[1:20:42] of possessing the Gate of the enemy
[1:20:44] after
[1:20:45] trial this is this is going to take a
[1:20:48] bit of a turn now as we go I I know that
[1:20:51] I talked about the revelation
[1:20:53] of of Jesus Christ to Simon bar Jonah
[1:20:58] who was changed to Peter in the same
[1:21:01] moment through the Revelation his name
[1:21:04] changed out of this message brother
[1:21:07] bradam he talks about
[1:21:10] Abraham in paragraph
[1:21:12] 58 he says the promise of
[1:21:15] Abraham was that his
[1:21:17] seed now his Royal seed also as I told
[1:21:21] you a while ago
[1:21:23] and this seal that he gave give Abraham
[1:21:27] was a seal of promise and the Royal seed
[1:21:31] according to Ephesians 4:30 is sealed by
[1:21:35] the Holy Ghost amen after they have
[1:21:38] stood the
[1:21:39] test try to think of
[1:21:42] it we know that there was a time where
[1:21:45] where where Abram not Abraham Abram met
[1:21:49] God and and he made himself real so real
[1:21:53] to him that he left his family he left
[1:21:55] his job he left his friends he left
[1:21:57] everyone that was there and he went out
[1:21:59] on his own he struck out on his own and
[1:22:02] we know that he he his nephew said I
[1:22:04] want to go with you Uncle if if if
[1:22:05] you're going to go I don't want to stay
[1:22:06] here take me with you and we know that
[1:22:08] he went I'll just continue reading here
[1:22:11] I get sidetracked brother bam goes on to
[1:22:13] say many think they got the Holy Ghost
[1:22:16] many claim to have the Holy Ghost many
[1:22:20] can show many evidences and signs of it
[1:22:23] but still if it can't stay with this
[1:22:27] word it's not the Holy Ghost seeall and
[1:22:30] I think that's so beautiful because it
[1:22:33] gives me and I'm sure it gives you it
[1:22:35] gives all of us an assurance that there
[1:22:37] is a baseline because it can be so
[1:22:40] difficult to understand sometimes you
[1:22:42] see people living lives that are like a
[1:22:44] double agent they live a life one way
[1:22:48] and then they live a life another way
[1:22:51] and you wonder what's going on
[1:22:53] they call themselves
[1:22:55] Believers you know at the beginning of
[1:22:56] this message brother bradam tells a
[1:22:58] story and it might be really good to
[1:22:59] just listen to it I'll try and and hit
[1:23:01] the high points in it he talks about a
[1:23:03] man who was a great evangelist in the
[1:23:04] United States he had a dream how he died
[1:23:07] and he went to heaven and while he's in
[1:23:09] heaven what does he do he he goes to the
[1:23:12] the people that are there the greeters
[1:23:13] at the door and he says can I come in
[1:23:15] and they say well what's your name and I
[1:23:17] can't remember his name I apologize I
[1:23:19] wanted to get that and and read it but
[1:23:21] he says what's your name he tells them
[1:23:23] his
[1:23:24] name and they say well we're looking in
[1:23:26] the book here and we just can't find
[1:23:27] your name it's just not here we're
[1:23:29] really sorry he says but I was a great
[1:23:31] evangelist in the United States how
[1:23:33] could I not be on the book they said
[1:23:35] well we don't know what to tell you
[1:23:36] you're not you're not here so you can
[1:23:38] appeal your case if you want to you can
[1:23:41] appeal it and and so he says okay and he
[1:23:44] went on and he said he came to a light a
[1:23:47] really really bright light and he got
[1:23:49] into the center of that light and and he
[1:23:51] heard a voice say who approaches my
[1:23:54] Throne of
[1:23:56] judgment and and he said I'm the great
[1:23:58] evangelist from the United States and
[1:24:00] and and I preached your gospel I led
[1:24:02] many souls to you and he said okay are
[1:24:06] you prepared to receive my judgment and
[1:24:08] he said yes and he said okay I'll
[1:24:11] execute my my sentence my judgment and
[1:24:15] he asked him his name and he says did
[1:24:17] you ever tell a
[1:24:18] lie he says oh I I did tell lie and he
[1:24:23] said you know before I got there I felt
[1:24:26] like I was a good person I felt like I
[1:24:29] had everything right in my life but once
[1:24:31] I got in that presence of that light I
[1:24:33] realized there was nothing good in me I
[1:24:36] had nothing to bring he said did you
[1:24:38] ever tell a lie I said yes I did did you
[1:24:43] ever steal anything he said well I I
[1:24:47] made a few business deals a few
[1:24:48] transactions that were a little bit in
[1:24:50] my benefit but and he Saidi knew right
[1:24:54] then that I had nothing good and he said
[1:24:56] ' are you ready for my judgment are you
[1:24:58] ready for it the sentencing and he said
[1:25:00] I was ready to hear him say depart from
[1:25:03] me ye
[1:25:05] Wicked and enter into the the Judgment
[1:25:08] for the devil and his angels but he said
[1:25:11] just when I was expecting to hear those
[1:25:13] words I Heard a Voice like I'd never
[1:25:15] heard in my life am yes and he turned
[1:25:18] around and he saw a face like he's never
[1:25:20] seen in his life
[1:25:23] and he said father although he is a
[1:25:26] sinner although he did Sin he stood for
[1:25:30] me down there and so I want to stand for
[1:25:34] him
[1:25:36] here brothers and sisters that's what
[1:25:38] it's going to come down to is to make
[1:25:41] sure that we stand for him here that
[1:25:43] we've got that token that we heard about
[1:25:45] this morning in our lives because when
[1:25:48] we get in that presence one day brothers
[1:25:50] and sisters our righteousness is going
[1:25:51] to be filth the rags oh my the only
[1:25:54] thing that's going to do it is him his
[1:25:57] token brother Bram says many think they
[1:25:59] got the Holy Ghost many claim to have
[1:26:01] the Holy Ghost many can show many
[1:26:03] evidences and signs of it but still if
[1:26:06] it can't stay with this word it's not
[1:26:08] the Holy Ghost see we talked about the
[1:26:12] new spirit how we can have a new spirit
[1:26:14] and the reason we get a new spirit is
[1:26:15] because our old Spirit our old Nature
[1:26:17] has to go because we can't get along
[1:26:20] with the Holy Ghost we can't even get
[1:26:21] along with ourselves
[1:26:23] eles so we get a new spiritu but brother
[1:26:26] Bram says that's not the Holy Spirit and
[1:26:28] sometimes people confuse that too you
[1:26:31] know brothers and sisters how you going
[1:26:32] to know the only way you're going to
[1:26:34] know is to give it the word test is what
[1:26:36] the prophet said can we say Amen to the
[1:26:39] word saying Amen to the word isn't just
[1:26:41] hollering in church even though you
[1:26:43] should do it when you believe it but
[1:26:47] saying Amen to the word is living
[1:26:49] it showing that that is the nutrient
[1:26:52] that you've been feeding upon that is
[1:26:54] what you have been eating during the
[1:26:56] week because when the Trials come they
[1:26:59] will come it's going to show who's on
[1:27:01] the inside it's going to show what
[1:27:04] you've been feeding on when the Trials
[1:27:06] come because the enemy is going about as
[1:27:09] a roaring lion seeking whom he may
[1:27:12] devour and this is not a time to play
[1:27:14] Church Brothers and Sisters this is a
[1:27:17] treacherous time Satan knows we're right
[1:27:19] near the Finish Line he's going to try
[1:27:21] and knock out as many people as he can
[1:27:24] but remember this rock of Revelation the
[1:27:26] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it
[1:27:29] and what is the rock of Revelation today
[1:27:32] we'll jump right to the finish of the
[1:27:34] sermon right now what is it it's Christ
[1:27:36] in you the hope of
[1:27:38] glory it's Christ himself living out
[1:27:41] through your life no longer me that
[1:27:43] lives yet but Christ who lives in me
[1:27:47] amen paragraph 60 he says you believe
[1:27:50] every word then you are sealed after the
[1:27:52] test amen but just be
[1:27:55] clear there's going to be a
[1:28:00] test oh I hate tests I always did not
[1:28:04] like tests who likes tests who likes to
[1:28:06] write an exam in school nobody does but
[1:28:09] what happened if if an instructor or a
[1:28:12] teacher or or a professor in University
[1:28:15] said you know what you've got just about
[1:28:17] all the time you want and you've got an
[1:28:19] open book
[1:28:21] exam imagine if you had that in school
[1:28:23] how many degrees would we have
[1:28:25] Plastering our walls I'd probably have
[1:28:26] like degree wallpaper in my house if it
[1:28:30] was an open book exam you couldn't fail
[1:28:33] all you'd have to do is show up that's
[1:28:36] right
[1:28:38] imagine the exam that we're going to get
[1:28:40] the exam that we're getting right the
[1:28:43] word test but Brothers and Sisters
[1:28:46] You've Got A limited amount of time and
[1:28:48] nobody knows how much time you've got
[1:28:50] except for God the Father amen but I'll
[1:28:52] tell you what you've got an open book
[1:28:53] exam you can take that book and answer
[1:28:56] every single question he's not going to
[1:28:58] give you many questions at all the Lord
[1:29:00] isn't going to give you many questions
[1:29:01] at all he'll say Do you believe that's
[1:29:04] the question that he'll give you because
[1:29:05] if you do then you'll
[1:29:07] act but the devil's going to come around
[1:29:09] and try and Grill you like a steak he's
[1:29:12] going to try and sift you like wheat
[1:29:14] he's going to come around with all kinds
[1:29:15] of questions oh where was the prophet
[1:29:17] hunting on that day was that really a a
[1:29:20] cloud of angels oh what was that Pillar
[1:29:22] of Fire was there something on the lens
[1:29:24] of the camera all these different things
[1:29:26] what about this Minister what about that
[1:29:28] Minister what about the other great
[1:29:29] Minister and how he fell all these
[1:29:31] different things that can go on he's not
[1:29:34] concerned with any of that that's the
[1:29:37] devil but God's going to say to you
[1:29:40] believe am and if you believe then
[1:29:42] you're going to act upon his word
[1:29:46] amen you believe every word he says then
[1:29:49] you are sealed after the test
[1:29:52] and that's Ephesians 4:30 right grieve
[1:29:54] ye not the holy spirit of God whereby ye
[1:29:57] are sealed until when until the day of
[1:30:00] your Redemption not till the next
[1:30:01] Revival not till the next service not
[1:30:03] till you fall again you're sealed that's
[1:30:06] it
[1:30:09] amen I always get in the way of the
[1:30:11] quote I'm sorry when we believe every
[1:30:13] promise in the word then we are sealed
[1:30:15] by the spirit to confirm the promise
[1:30:18] that's what it's what Abraham the way he
[1:30:21] did it then and then
[1:30:24] only we have we the right to possess the
[1:30:27] Gate of our enemy you cannot do it
[1:30:32] first you not can't sorry you cannot do
[1:30:34] it until first you become that seed I'm
[1:30:38] just going to read this paragraph all
[1:30:39] over again I apologize I just start
[1:30:41] talking I need to just focus he says you
[1:30:45] believe every word then you are sealed
[1:30:47] after the test when we believe every
[1:30:50] promise in the word then we are SE
[1:30:51] sealed by the spirit amen to confirm the
[1:30:55] promise that's what it's what Abraham
[1:30:58] the way he did
[1:31:00] it then and only have we the right to
[1:31:04] possess the Gate of our enemy you cannot
[1:31:07] do it until first you become that seed
[1:31:14] amen this might sound contrary to what
[1:31:18] we preach and what we believe yeah but I
[1:31:21] think brother br is really bringing
[1:31:22] something out here and if you look at
[1:31:24] the message and maybe the positioning of
[1:31:26] this message is in 1964 it's right near
[1:31:28] the end of his ministry he's already
[1:31:30] preached the seals now he's he's kind of
[1:31:33] just coming down from the the peak of
[1:31:35] his ministry if you will after the seals
[1:31:38] but I personally would say he's going up
[1:31:40] to the peak of his ministry which is in
[1:31:41] 1965 I just love 1965 I hope you do as
[1:31:45] well because it's a culmination of all
[1:31:47] of the message in every single message
[1:31:49] that he preaches in 1965 it's so
[1:31:51] beautiful
[1:31:52] but you know what we're talking about
[1:31:54] here is prevailing against the Gates of
[1:31:56] Hell the gates of hell are not going to
[1:31:58] Prevail against the believer the True
[1:32:00] Believer of the word those ones who are
[1:32:02] sealed by his word they have the Seal of
[1:32:05] Promise in their life which is the
[1:32:07] earnest or the down payment of what we
[1:32:10] have in store for
[1:32:11] us but there's different types of seed
[1:32:15] isn't there there's a natural seed and
[1:32:18] there's a royal seed we read a little
[1:32:19] bit about the Royal seed and we're going
[1:32:21] to read a little more about it but you
[1:32:23] know I just think it's interesting when
[1:32:25] we look at this the natural seed and and
[1:32:28] we could get into that but we're
[1:32:29] probably not going to go too far with
[1:32:30] that we know what the natural seed is
[1:32:32] there's the the natural human beings and
[1:32:34] the natural solutions that we can come
[1:32:35] up with but then there's the Royal seed
[1:32:37] and and the man-made solutions would be
[1:32:39] like the natural seed and we know that's
[1:32:41] what happened in Abraham's life there
[1:32:43] was the natural solution his wife came
[1:32:45] to him and said you know honey the the
[1:32:46] promise of God you've we've had it for
[1:32:48] so long and it's just not happening in
[1:32:51] in the time frame that we think that it
[1:32:53] should happen so how about we just make
[1:32:54] it happen in in our way and there's the
[1:32:56] natural solution right but then there's
[1:32:58] the spiritual solution they were not
[1:33:01] promised to have a son by the Bond woman
[1:33:04] right they were promised to have the
[1:33:06] natural Son by Sarah amen that's what
[1:33:09] the promise was but there's the natural
[1:33:10] seed there's the Royal seed there's the
[1:33:12] man-made Solutions and there's the
[1:33:14] god-made solutions Flesh and Blood
[1:33:16] spiritual one child of the Bond woman
[1:33:19] one child of the promise God God called
[1:33:22] Abram from his Kindred in home and what
[1:33:25] did he do once he did he didn't just
[1:33:27] call him out and just leave him out
[1:33:29] there to pasture just like the children
[1:33:30] of Israel when they came out of bondage
[1:33:32] what did he do he created a relationship
[1:33:34] with him we know that he became a friend
[1:33:37] of God is what the word says He took him
[1:33:40] out and he developed a personal
[1:33:42] relationship with him and there's so
[1:33:43] many scriptures but I didn't get into
[1:33:45] them this morning for time sake but then
[1:33:48] he came down and met him personally and
[1:33:51] and verified the promise
[1:33:55] personally and we know that God's nature
[1:33:57] never changes amen and I'm going to get
[1:33:59] right back into that again brothers and
[1:34:01] sisters never his nature never changes
[1:34:03] that's right that's right we can have
[1:34:04] the opportunity today to have the very
[1:34:07] same experience that Abram had and you
[1:34:09] know there's only one Abram and I know
[1:34:12] people will say well God's not going to
[1:34:13] come down and show himself in his face
[1:34:15] to me but I will say that God will come
[1:34:17] down and show another person's face to
[1:34:20] you and how you treat that person is how
[1:34:23] you're potentially treating God that's
[1:34:25] right so we need to be very careful how
[1:34:27] we're acting how we're treating people
[1:34:29] how we speak about them he says then you
[1:34:32] know uh sorry I'm not reading a quote
[1:34:34] this is just my notes sorry God's God's
[1:34:36] nature never changes brothers and
[1:34:37] sisters he is the same yesterday today
[1:34:39] and forever and when the first word came
[1:34:43] to Glory that his son fell when Adam
[1:34:46] fell what
[1:34:48] happened he could have sent an angel he
[1:34:51] could have sent an Entourage he could
[1:34:53] have sent a messenger maybe a prophet
[1:34:56] but what he did was he came down himself
[1:34:59] Hallelujah and he said my son is Fallen
[1:35:01] I've got to go down and I've got to meet
[1:35:02] him myself I need to speak to him lip to
[1:35:05] ear and you know brothers and sisters
[1:35:07] there's no difference really from him
[1:35:10] there to us here we have the ability to
[1:35:13] hear from God if we truly want to and
[1:35:15] you know how we'll know if we're hearing
[1:35:17] from God because everyone's going to say
[1:35:20] potentially
[1:35:21] I've heard from God if you've heard from
[1:35:24] God it will be exactly according to the
[1:35:26] word of
[1:35:27] God and if it's not exactly according to
[1:35:30] the word of God then leave it alone
[1:35:32] brothers and sisters it's not from God
[1:35:35] but it will always be according to the
[1:35:37] word of God you'll be able to take it
[1:35:39] back to the word of God and sometimes
[1:35:40] you'll be able to take it back I'll say
[1:35:42] most times not all the time but most
[1:35:44] times you'll be able to take it back to
[1:35:45] the message of the hour because the
[1:35:47] message of the hour points to the word
[1:35:48] of God Amen the life things that we
[1:35:50] encounter the the the maybe you can have
[1:35:53] a dream maybe you would have a thought
[1:35:55] while while someone's ministering
[1:35:58] something to you in church your mind
[1:36:00] might be going somewhere else we're
[1:36:01] talking about this on Wednesday and and
[1:36:03] God can be speaking to you directly it's
[1:36:06] not a bad thing to be thinking and
[1:36:08] having a conversation in your heart with
[1:36:10] God while the preaching of the word is
[1:36:11] going on that's a communication that's
[1:36:14] Revelation but if you want to see
[1:36:16] whether it's God or not take it back to
[1:36:18] the word see if it lines up with the
[1:36:19] word if it doesn't line up with the word
[1:36:21] there's something
[1:36:22] wrong and I just think that's beautiful
[1:36:24] we talked about it already that's our
[1:36:25] Baseline that's our our our absolute
[1:36:28] that's our Anchor Point we have that as
[1:36:30] a a reference and we have a question we
[1:36:33] can always go back to that and we know
[1:36:35] that that lawyers and and judges they
[1:36:37] have the same thing they've got the rule
[1:36:39] of the law and when there's a judge a
[1:36:41] court case going on there's always
[1:36:43] something to fall back upon and that is
[1:36:45] the law but there's always an
[1:36:46] interpretation of the law and that's
[1:36:48] what gives lawyers a job they have an
[1:36:50] ability to to interpret that law and
[1:36:52] actually bring a case before a judge but
[1:36:55] we have a law that's been given to us
[1:36:58] and that law has been abolished and
[1:37:00] we've been given Grace and once we
[1:37:03] actually experience that Grace then the
[1:37:05] law has no power over
[1:37:07] us but sometimes you see folks they're
[1:37:10] just stuck in the law they're stuck in
[1:37:12] sanctification justification they've
[1:37:14] been Justified all right and Sanctified
[1:37:16] oh yeah they're Sanctified all day long
[1:37:19] but so they look at other people and and
[1:37:21] maybe some other people just aren't
[1:37:23] really Sanctified all the way just maybe
[1:37:25] not quite as far as they are and there's
[1:37:27] a problem with that because you got to
[1:37:28] go on from that stage you can't stay
[1:37:30] stuck in sanctification trying to
[1:37:32] interpret the law what we have got to do
[1:37:35] is go on to letting the judge who is the
[1:37:37] attorney let him interpret the law
[1:37:39] through us because then it will just be
[1:37:42] Grace it will be grace to
[1:37:45] everyone but when Adam fell God came
[1:37:48] down himself when the Hebrew children
[1:37:50] stood for him he came and stood for them
[1:37:54] we know that Gabriel said hey you know
[1:37:55] what I'll draw this sword we've been
[1:37:57] watching them for hours when the Hebrew
[1:37:59] kids were thrown into the fire God said
[1:38:01] no put it away Gabriel we know that worm
[1:38:03] one said hey just like the end of
[1:38:04] Destruction I'll go down and I'll flood
[1:38:06] those guys out we'll put that furnace at
[1:38:08] seven times hot hotter out we'll put it
[1:38:10] out in a second don't worry about that
[1:38:12] he said no don't worry about that either
[1:38:13] I'm going to go down this is a job for
[1:38:15] me and what did he do he called a
[1:38:16] Thunderhead he shot a bolt of lightning
[1:38:18] and he came down and he was that Fourth
[1:38:20] Man in the fire right on time God
[1:38:22] himself came down and I can say it
[1:38:25] brothers and sisters he wants to do the
[1:38:27] same thing for us today he wants to come
[1:38:29] down and be a part of our Lives be a
[1:38:31] part of our trials he's allowing the
[1:38:34] trials so that we will call upon that
[1:38:36] Fourth Man to be in our fire not just be
[1:38:39] alone and destitute trying to Wade
[1:38:42] through it on our
[1:38:44] ourselves he wants to be the one that's
[1:38:46] a part of
[1:38:47] it we know that after Abraham had been
[1:38:50] called out
[1:38:52] out called out of his Kindred and and
[1:38:55] his families and had a bit of a
[1:38:57] relationship with God
[1:39:00] himself while he was out there came
[1:39:03] Strife the natural tendencies
[1:39:06] between nephew and an uncle between
[1:39:11] families maybe
[1:39:13] wives people in the church they started
[1:39:17] to come together and say oh there's not
[1:39:19] enough of this and there's not enough of
[1:39:20] that and oh my goodness we've got all
[1:39:22] these other problems and you know there
[1:39:24] became Strife in the church and what
[1:39:27] happened there was a split wasn't there
[1:39:30] but Abram he he talked to God about it
[1:39:32] and and he knew exactly where he stood
[1:39:34] and he told his nephew just go wherever
[1:39:37] you want to go see the land that's out
[1:39:39] there just go and take whichever land
[1:39:41] you want you go whever way you want to
[1:39:44] go and we'll go the opposite and our our
[1:39:46] our herds won't have any problem there's
[1:39:47] no need for Strife we don't have to have
[1:39:50] problems you just go your way and we'll
[1:39:52] go
[1:39:53] ours and we'll still be
[1:39:56] brothers we won't be enemies we'll still
[1:39:59] be brothers and so what happened they
[1:40:02] did and and and we know that there was
[1:40:04] the the the kings came down and to the
[1:40:07] the king's Dale from the king's Dale and
[1:40:09] they took out lot and and they robbed
[1:40:11] the city and they probably killed people
[1:40:13] and and sieged the cities and and we
[1:40:15] know that Abraham he got word that his
[1:40:18] brother had gone his brother had been
[1:40:21] taken and his people so what did he do
[1:40:24] he put together all the people and
[1:40:25] imagine he's an old man now he's not a
[1:40:28] young guy but he put together all the
[1:40:30] people and they ran after his nephew
[1:40:32] even that one that was causing strife
[1:40:34] the one that wanted the split they ran
[1:40:36] after him they went after him and we
[1:40:38] know brother badam talks about how they
[1:40:40] went right to the ends of the Earth for
[1:40:41] him they went all the way but they went
[1:40:44] and got him but afterwards is what I
[1:40:46] want to talk about afterwards brothers
[1:40:48] and sisters what happened we know that
[1:40:51] all the spoils came to him and he gave a
[1:40:53] tenth of the spoil to someone and that
[1:40:56] someone was MDC that met him to say you
[1:40:58] know what you did a great job you didn't
[1:41:01] bother saying that's okay that's our
[1:41:03] brother we'll just let him go he got
[1:41:04] what he deserved that's what he deserved
[1:41:06] CU he's the one who's who's a a a uh
[1:41:10] deserter of the camp he's the one
[1:41:13] causing strife he wanted the split so he
[1:41:15] deserves it no no he didn't the spirit
[1:41:19] of Jesus Christ in him said no we we got
[1:41:21] to go get him he's our
[1:41:23] brother brother bradam says that he was
[1:41:25] maybe a penny in God's economy and maybe
[1:41:28] Abraham or Abraham was a silver dollar
[1:41:30] but they're still both a part of his
[1:41:32] economy I I say Lord let me be a penny
[1:41:35] let let me be a hey Penny in your
[1:41:37] economy maybe a dime or a nickel doesn't
[1:41:39] matter whether I'm a quarter or or a
[1:41:41] dollar bill or a $100 bill whatever I am
[1:41:44] just let me be in your economy Lord
[1:41:46] that's all so long as I'm there I'm
[1:41:48] going to the
[1:41:49] bank
[1:41:52] we know that MDC met him and
[1:41:54] said blessed be the most high God and he
[1:41:58] served him communion after the battle it
[1:42:02] didn't happen
[1:42:03] before it happened after and again a
[1:42:08] refreshing can you imagine Abraham must
[1:42:12] have known who it was he must have known
[1:42:15] exactly who he was the priest of the
[1:42:16] most high
[1:42:19] god without beginning of days without
[1:42:22] descent this man serving him
[1:42:25] communion I want to say it brothers and
[1:42:27] sisters this man wants to serve you
[1:42:30] communion he wants to serve us communion
[1:42:32] probably a whole lot more than many
[1:42:34] times we want it because he serves it
[1:42:37] twice a week Sundays and Wednesdays and
[1:42:40] Sundays and Wednesdays and it's not
[1:42:42] brother Barry that does it it's him it's
[1:42:45] his program
[1:42:47] amen it's not it's not the preacher that
[1:42:50] operates the gift remember doesn't
[1:42:52] matter what church you're at wherever
[1:42:53] you're at doesn't matter it's not the
[1:42:56] preacher that operates the gift the
[1:42:58] preacher
[1:42:59] surrenders but it's the people that
[1:43:01] operate the gift and when the people
[1:43:02] really want to hear from God and they
[1:43:04] come with a need in their heart they'll
[1:43:06] take and use that minister to hear God
[1:43:08] speak directly to their
[1:43:10] needs but we know that Abram he got to
[1:43:13] meet MDC and this relationship is what
[1:43:15] I'm talking about it started to grow and
[1:43:18] grow and grow and that was in genes 14
[1:43:21] and we know in Genesis 17 God came and
[1:43:24] met them on the plains of mamory and we
[1:43:26] know there he changed their
[1:43:29] names and and it's interesting we know
[1:43:31] the whole entire uh message it talks
[1:43:33] about it brother bam talks about it over
[1:43:34] and over again how how how Abraham he
[1:43:37] saw one he said Lord Elohim but we know
[1:43:42] that lot when he saw them he said Lords
[1:43:45] my lords because we know the two angels
[1:43:47] went down we know all of that I don't
[1:43:49] want to get into the trinitarian thing
[1:43:50] with this but we know that God came down
[1:43:53] and he changed Abram and Sarah's names
[1:43:56] in that moment in that meeting and this
[1:43:59] is kind of where I want to see the
[1:44:01] scriptures come together now because we
[1:44:03] talked about how
[1:44:05] Jesus God in flesh said to Simon bar
[1:44:10] Jonah Flesh and Blood hath not revealed
[1:44:12] this unto you but my Father which is in
[1:44:14] heaven hath revealed this unto
[1:44:16] you and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:44:19] Prevail we we know that he changed his
[1:44:22] name to Peter Thou Art Peter and Upon
[1:44:24] This Rock that your name has changed
[1:44:28] this Revelation now has changed your
[1:44:30] name the same thing is happening to
[1:44:34] Abram to
[1:44:36] Abraham he's having his name changed as
[1:44:39] well he's becoming a new creature in
[1:44:41] Christ Jesus because who was it that met
[1:44:44] him there we know it was Elohim we'
[1:44:47] probably heard people say it before was
[1:44:48] that Jesus Christ his theophany body did
[1:44:51] God take his theophan body and jump into
[1:44:53] it and come down and meet him somehow he
[1:44:55] knew exactly who he was even though he'd
[1:44:58] never met him before I've heard other
[1:45:00] people say that it was his voice when he
[1:45:02] spoke he recognized that voice and I
[1:45:05] think today brothers and sisters it's so
[1:45:07] important for us to recognize that voice
[1:45:09] recognize that voice when we hear a
[1:45:11] brother or a sister say something to us
[1:45:13] recognize that voice understand who it
[1:45:15] is that's speaking to us God doesn't
[1:45:18] have a voice of his own that he uses to
[1:45:19] speak to people well he can he can do
[1:45:21] anything he's God but 90% of the time
[1:45:24] 99% of the time I'll say he used a
[1:45:26] brother or a sister to speak to a
[1:45:28] brother or
[1:45:30] sister just like he uses the ministry
[1:45:33] Genesis 17 we know that God came down
[1:45:36] and revealed himself to Abram and Sarah
[1:45:39] and changed their names gave him a name
[1:45:40] change and told them I'm going to visit
[1:45:41] you according to the time of Life The
[1:45:44] Promise is as I spoke it it's not as you
[1:45:48] have tried to make it it's not through
[1:45:50] ishmail it's not through the Bond woman
[1:45:52] it's actually going to happen you're
[1:45:55] going to have a
[1:45:56] son Genesis 20 we know that Abram
[1:46:01] Abraham now with a new name he met God
[1:46:05] he's a real believer Justified
[1:46:07] Sanctified just about filled with the
[1:46:09] Holy Ghost he's in the place where he's
[1:46:11] just really on fire for the Lord and
[1:46:14] what happens natural circumstance get in
[1:46:17] his way and Cloud his judgment and he
[1:46:19] runs down to Egypt and what does he do
[1:46:21] he finds the king likes his wife why
[1:46:25] does the king like his wife though the
[1:46:27] king is attracted to his wife because
[1:46:29] she's been changed he not only changed
[1:46:32] their names there but he changed their
[1:46:35] bodies they got a body change out of the
[1:46:37] deal by their ability to just say Amen
[1:46:40] to the word they received a name change
[1:46:43] and a new body and now this King while
[1:46:47] they're backsliding down in Egypt is
[1:46:49] attracted to them attracted to her
[1:46:53] anyways probably not so much him but
[1:46:55] abik is attracted to her we know brother
[1:46:58] Bram said that he was
[1:47:00] backslider but isn't it interesting I'm
[1:47:02] just going to jump right into it in
[1:47:04] Hebrews it says that he staggered not at
[1:47:07] the promise of God through unbelief amen
[1:47:10] but he was strong yes he was strong
[1:47:14] brothers and sisters he wasn't giving in
[1:47:17] although if we look at his natural flesh
[1:47:21] if we look at his actions we could say
[1:47:24] wow he had an experience with God he had
[1:47:27] his name changed he he was a real winner
[1:47:30] he was a real believer he had all this
[1:47:32] this this sign and wonder that went
[1:47:34] along with his life this testimony that
[1:47:36] nobody else
[1:47:38] had but yet he goes down and backslides
[1:47:41] he
[1:47:42] backslid but that ain't what the word of
[1:47:44] God says is it he staggered not at the
[1:47:48] promise of God through unbelief even
[1:47:50] after trying to come up with a natural
[1:47:51] solution to a spiritual problem right
[1:47:55] how many times do we get in the
[1:47:57] way of letting the spiritual result the
[1:48:01] spiritual solution come to pass by
[1:48:04] creating a natural problem and God will
[1:48:06] allow those natural problems to just run
[1:48:09] in in in in unison with the spiritual
[1:48:13] result the spiritual solution he'll
[1:48:15] allow the natural problems to happen and
[1:48:17] we'll need to learn from those things
[1:48:20] but I just think it's beautiful even in
[1:48:22] the midst of going down into is Egypt
[1:48:25] and backsliding AMC falling in love with
[1:48:27] this man's wife he's saying that oh
[1:48:29] she's my sister say she's my sister
[1:48:31] because they'll kill me they'll kill me
[1:48:33] he wasn't worried about her they'll kill
[1:48:36] me for her what brother bam says he was
[1:48:40] trying to save his own
[1:48:43] hide but he staggered not at the promise
[1:48:46] of God through unbelief brothers and
[1:48:48] sisters he was a believer and why was he
[1:48:51] a Believer because God chose him to be a
[1:48:55] believer you know in Genesis
[1:48:59] 21 Isaac is
[1:49:01] born 25 years after the promise is given
[1:49:05] a long time for a human that's a long
[1:49:09] time to dwell upon the promise to think
[1:49:11] that that promise is coming but we know
[1:49:13] that promise came and we know that he he
[1:49:15] got to the place where he was a fine
[1:49:17] young man and I can't help but think may
[1:49:19] maybe perhaps she was the same age as my
[1:49:21] son Isaac and and and and Abraham now
[1:49:25] was told hey you know what it's the same
[1:49:27] voice and he was like oh yes God
[1:49:30] Almighty Elohim how are you I'm so glad
[1:49:32] to talk to you that you want to come and
[1:49:33] talk to me again and he said I I I I'm
[1:49:36] so glad that I can come and talk to you
[1:49:37] Abraham now I want you to hear my voice
[1:49:40] and follow me sure Lord anything you
[1:49:42] want anything that I can do for you in
[1:49:44] your kingdom because I believe I'm a
[1:49:46] believer I'm on fire for you yep you are
[1:49:49] take your son Isaac up to the mountain
[1:49:51] where I tell you to and kill him now
[1:49:53] show me that you love me prove to
[1:49:56] me brothers and sisters we're not going
[1:49:59] to get the victory without a
[1:50:02] trial the trial is going to show who we
[1:50:05] are he's going to allow the trial to
[1:50:08] squeeze out whoever is on the inside of
[1:50:11] us I don't want to say whatever is on
[1:50:14] the inside of us because we've either
[1:50:15] got Christ or the devil living inside of
[1:50:18] us one of the two
[1:50:20] and you know what without the Holy Ghost
[1:50:22] In Our Lives we've already got the mark
[1:50:24] of the beast what's the mark of the
[1:50:25] beast the genetic code of the hybrid
[1:50:28] condition born in sin shaped and
[1:50:30] iniquity come the world speaking lies
[1:50:32] we're supposed to be born by the spoken
[1:50:33] word but we're not we bypassed our
[1:50:35] theophanies to come down here to be born
[1:50:37] in sin so that we can manifest through
[1:50:39] iniquity and and and be in the world
[1:50:41] speaking Lies We just lie automatically
[1:50:43] some people might say brother Barry I've
[1:50:44] never lied ever in my life okay maybe
[1:50:47] you haven't it doesn't matter maybe
[1:50:49] you've never stolen maybe you've never
[1:50:51] sworn maybe you've never had a drink or
[1:50:52] a smoke or done anything done anything
[1:50:55] wrong but the way you were born was
[1:50:58] wrong that genetic code that's in you
[1:51:01] because of that automatically puts you
[1:51:03] in that category to have the mark of the
[1:51:05] beast that's why we have to have the
[1:51:07] Holy Ghost in our lives that Pillar of
[1:51:10] Fire in our age is what gives us that
[1:51:12] Holy
[1:51:16] Ghost Genesis 21 Isaac is born 25 years
[1:51:21] after the promise God tells him
[1:51:24] okay I love you you love me now go take
[1:51:27] him up there and kill him for me show me
[1:51:30] that you love
[1:51:31] me we know brother Bram my belief he
[1:51:34] says it he probably didn't even tell his
[1:51:36] wife I know I wouldn't be able to tell
[1:51:38] my wife if God gave me that Revelation
[1:51:40] but I would say that if God gave me that
[1:51:42] Revelation that I should just probably
[1:51:43] go and take myself up to the mountain if
[1:51:45] you know what I
[1:51:46] mean cuz I wouldn't be able to bring
[1:51:48] myself to that but it's not not my
[1:51:50] promise we've already seen it it's for
[1:51:51] the word of God for our edification and
[1:51:53] we know that the examples have already
[1:51:55] been given but by him following the word
[1:51:58] by Abraham following the word of God
[1:52:01] believing the promise to the ends of the
[1:52:03] Earth what happened God blessed
[1:52:06] him God blessed him and how did he bless
[1:52:08] him through that
[1:52:09] trial he blessed him through that trial
[1:52:12] by saying to him Abram Abraham Abraham
[1:52:16] while he was back with a knife to come
[1:52:18] down and chop his son's throat because
[1:52:19] we know he got all that way I could say
[1:52:21] a whole bunch in the middle there but he
[1:52:23] he was going to do it and we know God
[1:52:25] knew he was going to do it and he said
[1:52:26] Abraham Abraham stop what you're doing
[1:52:29] right there don't do it
[1:52:31] anymore now I know that you love me
[1:52:35] am but remember he was God and God knows
[1:52:39] everything from the end to the beginning
[1:52:42] and everything in between so God knew
[1:52:43] that he loved him but Abraham needed to
[1:52:45] know how much he truly loved God he was
[1:52:48] willing to sacrifice all that he knew
[1:52:50] all that he believed everything that had
[1:52:52] to do with that promise he was willing
[1:52:54] to give it back to God to prove to him
[1:52:57] that he loved him amen hallelujah and I
[1:52:59] wonder if we're able to do that
[1:53:01] ourselves brothers and sisters can we
[1:53:03] take all of our Traditions all of the
[1:53:06] family traditions all of the religiosity
[1:53:09] that we've got all of the things that
[1:53:12] would have to do with the message maybe
[1:53:14] memorabilia maybe past experiences maybe
[1:53:17] past hurts Maybe letdowns all of that
[1:53:20] stuff are we willing to let it all go
[1:53:22] and say be it unto me according to Thy
[1:53:24] word for
[1:53:27] today cuz I believe this brothers and
[1:53:29] sisters I would say this under
[1:53:31] inspiration that that's what he's
[1:53:33] calling for today he's not calling for a
[1:53:36] bride that's going to say I've got all
[1:53:38] this baggage that I'm dragging around
[1:53:39] behind me will you one day just Release
[1:53:41] Me From It by changing my body he wants
[1:53:45] us to let go of it now amen and once he
[1:53:48] sees that we're let go of it then we're
[1:53:50] going to be able to Worship in Liberty
[1:53:52] we're going to be able to shout for Joy
[1:53:54] just like we did when we were back there
[1:53:56] on the other side of
[1:53:58] Eternity amen yes we're not waiting for
[1:54:01] a day amen imagine how the children of
[1:54:04] Israel rejoiced when they were actually
[1:54:06] delivered out of their
[1:54:08] bondage I know we still have our bondage
[1:54:12] so it's tough to worship sometimes
[1:54:14] especially on a
[1:54:15] Wednesday you know what there's a
[1:54:17] blessing in store for it there's a
[1:54:19] blessing in in store for worship
[1:54:20] brothers and sisters if you want to hear
[1:54:23] from God call upon him and see if he
[1:54:25] won't answer you amen but Genesis 21
[1:54:29] Isaac is
[1:54:31] born we know that he's given
[1:54:34] the the answer to the promise Abraham
[1:54:37] and Sarah are and Abraham takes him up
[1:54:40] and has that tremendous Revelation now I
[1:54:44] know that I love God way more than I
[1:54:47] ever thought that I ever could because I
[1:54:48] was willing to take and sacrifice the
[1:54:50] gift that he gave me the promise that he
[1:54:53] had promised us the spiritual solution
[1:54:57] it's amazing how God will use different
[1:54:59] things in our lives and take us to
[1:55:00] different levels through those different
[1:55:02] experiences those different trials those
[1:55:04] those dark valleys sometimes can be
[1:55:07] tremendous blessings in
[1:55:09] time you know I just couldn't help but
[1:55:12] think about this Abram Abraham I keep
[1:55:14] calling him Abram forgive me
[1:55:16] Abraham he got this promise 25 years
[1:55:20] After the Promise he received it God
[1:55:25] came down and made the relationship with
[1:55:26] him and told him that this is going to
[1:55:28] happen you're going to have a promised
[1:55:30] son there is going to be a royal seed
[1:55:32] and it's going to come through your son
[1:55:35] and and it's going to happen and you
[1:55:37] just need to be patient and just see if
[1:55:39] if it doesn't happen the way that I say
[1:55:41] it
[1:55:42] will and here just thinking about us
[1:55:45] today you know brothers and sisters we
[1:55:47] we've got some folks that are in the
[1:55:49] message message of the hour for over 25
[1:55:53] years there's some folks that have been
[1:55:55] around the message for a long long time
[1:55:59] and I want to say it I want to ask the
[1:56:01] question have have the promise that's
[1:56:05] been made known to you H has it been
[1:56:07] revealed is it a fresh Revelation today
[1:56:11] is it just as exciting as it was over 25
[1:56:14] years
[1:56:15] ago and some people haven't been in the
[1:56:17] message that long some people have only
[1:56:19] been around for a little while but to
[1:56:21] think about how Abraham was not
[1:56:24] discouraged how he staggered not at the
[1:56:27] promise of God through unbelief but was
[1:56:30] strong giving God the glory he was
[1:56:33] willing to continue marching forwards he
[1:56:36] wasn't going backwards with it at
[1:56:39] all it just made me think about where
[1:56:41] where are we at
[1:56:43] today you know in Romans chapter 4 maybe
[1:56:46] turn there with me this morning Romans
[1:56:48] chap 4:13
[1:56:53] there's a there's a promised seed and
[1:56:56] I'm getting somewhere with it today I'll
[1:56:57] just say it maybe that we're the
[1:56:59] promised seed the Believers of this this
[1:57:01] message of the hour they're the promised
[1:57:03] seed they're the Royal Seed of
[1:57:06] Abraham it's not just 144,000 it's not
[1:57:09] just the children of
[1:57:11] Israel Romans 4 verse
[1:57:17] 13 talking about the promise for the
[1:57:19] promise that he should be the heir of
[1:57:22] the world was not to Abraham or to his
[1:57:28] seed through the
[1:57:30] law but through the righteousness of
[1:57:33] Faith
[1:57:34] amen for if they which are of the law be
[1:57:38] HS faith is made
[1:57:41] void and the promise made of not effect
[1:57:47] why is that brothers and sisters because
[1:57:48] they could do something something on
[1:57:49] their own to make it come to pass I I
[1:57:51] can do this and I'm going to get that I
[1:57:53] can act this way and I'll I'll see that
[1:57:55] result because I do I'll get because
[1:57:59] because because no there's no way that
[1:58:01] that's going to happen verse 15 says
[1:58:03] because the law worketh wrath yeah for
[1:58:06] where no law is there is no
[1:58:09] transgression
[1:58:11] right therefore it is a faith that it
[1:58:14] might be by grace to the end the promise
[1:58:19] might be sure to all the seed not to
[1:58:23] that only which is of the law but to
[1:58:25] that also which is of the faith of
[1:58:29] Abraham isn't that wonderful how it goes
[1:58:31] from being the Seed of Abraham to the
[1:58:34] faith of Abraham Abraham the one who was
[1:58:38] strong and giving God the glory who
[1:58:40] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:58:42] through unbelief but was willing to
[1:58:44] continue marching
[1:58:47] forwards who is the father of us all
[1:58:49] verse 17 as it is written I have made
[1:58:51] thee a father of many nations before him
[1:58:54] whom he believed even God who quickeneth
[1:58:57] the dead and calleth those things which
[1:59:00] be not as though they were who against
[1:59:03] hope believed in hope that he might
[1:59:05] become the father of many nations
[1:59:07] according to that which was spoken so
[1:59:09] shall thy seed be and being not weak in
[1:59:12] faith he considered not his own body now
[1:59:16] dead when he was about a hundred years
[1:59:18] old
[1:59:20] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:59:22] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:59:24] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:59:26] giving glory to
[1:59:28] God and I just love this next verse
[1:59:31] brothers and
[1:59:32] sisters and being fully persuaded that
[1:59:35] what he had promised he was able also to
[1:59:39] perform so if you've been called The
[1:59:42] Royal Seed of Abraham this morning
[1:59:43] brothers and sisters it's not up to you
[1:59:45] to bring it to pass it's up to him amen
[1:59:49] and he wants to bring it to
[1:59:52] pass he's wanting to bring it to pass in
[1:59:54] every one of our lives but don't stagger
[1:59:57] at this
[2:00:00] flesh this flesh is being affected by
[2:00:03] the gates of hell yes it is we can't get
[2:00:05] out of our house in the morning and
[2:00:07] drive down the road and not see a
[2:00:09] picture that we say Lord have
[2:00:12] mercy or see someone on the road or see
[2:00:16] a news article or hear some music music
[2:00:19] or hear some swearing or whatever it is
[2:00:22] wherever we go we can't escape
[2:00:25] it but we've already escaped through
[2:00:28] Christ
[2:00:31] Jesus this world is not our home
[2:00:33] brothers and sisters we're just a
[2:00:34] passing
[2:00:36] through our Treasures are laid up
[2:00:40] somewhere beyond the blue oh my verse 21
[2:00:44] and being fully persuaded are you fully
[2:00:46] persuaded today are we fully persuaded
[2:00:49] if we're fully persuaded then just keep
[2:00:51] marching brothers and sisters don't give
[2:00:53] in don't get weak don't
[2:00:55] stagger and being fully persuaded that
[2:00:58] what he had promised he was able also to
[2:01:00] perform he will do it all amen and
[2:01:04] therefore it was imputed to him for
[2:01:07] righteousness Oh
[2:01:09] my he wants to impute it unto us for
[2:01:12] righteousness his righteousness brothers
[2:01:14] and sisters just don't stagger don't
[2:01:16] look at your flesh don't look at your
[2:01:17] brother or your sister don't look at me
[2:01:19] don't look at anyone except for him look
[2:01:21] to Jesus Christ look away to Jesus verse
[2:01:25] 23 says now it was not written for his
[2:01:28] sake alone but it was imputed to him but
[2:01:31] for us also Glory To whom it shall be
[2:01:34] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[2:01:36] up Jesus our lord from the dead who was
[2:01:40] delivered for our offenses and was
[2:01:42] raised again for who our justification
[2:01:46] amen my goodness amen thank you I just
[2:01:49] can't help but get excited I I just
[2:01:52] think it's
[2:01:53] beautiful you know where we left off
[2:01:57] I'll just go back because I want to tie
[2:01:59] this together here bear with me for a
[2:02:02] second out of possessing the Gate of the
[2:02:06] enemy after
[2:02:08] trial the last sentence brother Bram
[2:02:10] says in this quote he says you cannot do
[2:02:12] it until you first become the seed and
[2:02:15] I'm sure that potentially planted a seed
[2:02:19] and I was hoping that it would now let's
[2:02:21] water it let's water it with the word
[2:02:23] and and see what grows out of that seed
[2:02:26] let's see what comes out of
[2:02:31] it out of 19650
[2:02:35] 0119 the God who is rich in
[2:02:38] Mercy let's see what he says about that
[2:02:42] seed and I would say if you're curious
[2:02:46] afterwards just look up always were
[2:02:50] just look up always were two
[2:02:52] words and you'll see where this quote
[2:02:54] comes from but you'll see not a bunch
[2:02:57] you'll see a few that talk very
[2:02:59] specifically about this and honestly
[2:03:01] when I started to think about this when
[2:03:02] I feel inspired about it I thought
[2:03:03] there'd be a lot more in the message but
[2:03:05] there isn't it's kind of close towards
[2:03:07] the end of the message look up always
[2:03:08] were brother bradam says in paragraph 42
[2:03:11] out of God The God Who was rich in Mercy
[2:03:13] 1965 he says now if you've got eternal
[2:03:16] life
[2:03:17] tonight if we have eternal life than we
[2:03:20] always were because there is only one
[2:03:23] form of eternal life we always were and
[2:03:26] the reason we were is because we are a
[2:03:29] part of God and God is the only thing
[2:03:32] that's
[2:03:34] Eternal and like as mzc received tithes
[2:03:38] from Abraham and it was lauded to his
[2:03:41] great grandson Levi whom was yet in the
[2:03:44] loins of Abraham paid tithes for he was
[2:03:47] yet in the loins of Abraham when when he
[2:03:49] met MDC I want to speak on that over the
[2:03:52] other place one morning who is this MDC
[2:03:54] now notice that way back God knew this
[2:03:57] boy coming down he knowed all
[2:04:01] things this is what I want to get to
[2:04:03] here this is what that seed turns into
[2:04:06] we water it with the word now we are a
[2:04:08] part of God you always was you don't
[2:04:12] remember it because you were only an
[2:04:15] attribute of God but I want to say this
[2:04:18] this morning brothers and sisters if you
[2:04:20] can say Amen to this word then you are
[2:04:22] manifesting attributes of God you are
[2:04:26] the manifestation of the word of God for
[2:04:28] your day Hallelujah he says you are only
[2:04:31] in his thinking your very name if it
[2:04:33] ever was on the book of life it was put
[2:04:36] there before the foundation of the world
[2:04:38] he knew what you were right you're not
[2:04:42] going to be you are already seated in
[2:04:45] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen
[2:04:49] amen thank you Lord says I'm only saying
[2:04:51] this not to mix up Doctrine but to
[2:04:53] straighten it out that we might get away
[2:04:56] from this fear and scare oh my I'm I'm
[2:05:00] I'm saved today but I'm lost tomorrow
[2:05:02] and I'm lost today but maybe I'll be
[2:05:04] saved tomorrow brothers and sisters if
[2:05:07] you've received the promise of the Holy
[2:05:08] Ghost in your life you are sealed till
[2:05:10] the day of your
[2:05:12] Redemption the gates of hell are
[2:05:14] flapping and banging trying to tell you
[2:05:16] you've lost it you never had it you're
[2:05:18] going to get it someday but I want to
[2:05:20] say you've got it just follow the word
[2:05:24] just get the word of Christ in your life
[2:05:27] repent get baptized in the name of the
[2:05:29] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[2:05:31] your sins and you shall receive the seal
[2:05:34] the holy ghost in your
[2:05:37] life it not only gives you eternal life
[2:05:40] it not only seals you to the day of your
[2:05:42] Redemption it gives you the ability to
[2:05:43] have prophetic insight into the word of
[2:05:46] God you can read between between the
[2:05:49] lines the Bible becomes a new book when
[2:05:52] it says in Genesis that you know God
[2:05:55] told Adam you can eat from any tree in
[2:05:57] the garden except for that one tree
[2:06:00] don't touch that one tree don't eat of
[2:06:02] that fruit Adam doesn't even tell Eve he
[2:06:05] tells Adam that's right but then we see
[2:06:08] that Eve later on when she's expressed
[2:06:10] when she's taken from Adam's side how
[2:06:12] she goes and she eats of that fruit and
[2:06:15] the whole entire world would say well it
[2:06:17] was an apple it was an apricot it wasn't
[2:06:19] a cherry it was this it was that but we
[2:06:21] had a prophet in our day say that it was
[2:06:23] a sexual act it was more than that the
[2:06:26] ability to read between the lines
[2:06:28] brothers and sisters when we can do that
[2:06:30] we can recognize the words original sin
[2:06:33] what it conjures in the human mind
[2:06:36] especially to the whole entire world it
[2:06:37] gives you the ability to read between
[2:06:39] the
[2:06:40] lines the whole Bible becomes a new book
[2:06:43] to
[2:06:43] us any human being that's willing to
[2:06:46] take God at his word it will become a
[2:06:48] new book yes
[2:06:50] amen I'm only saying this not to mix up
[2:06:53] Doctrine but to straighten it out that
[2:06:55] we might get away from this fear and
[2:06:57] scare you don't know who you are
[2:07:01] brothers and sisters you're Sons and
[2:07:03] Daughters of the most high God already
[2:07:05] seated in Heavenly places and you know
[2:07:08] if someone can actually shake you shake
[2:07:10] your experience from this this message
[2:07:13] of the hour if it can cause you to
[2:07:15] behave in a certain way then I want to
[2:07:17] say maybe just tune in to the message of
[2:07:19] the hour a little more maybe just go on
[2:07:22] your knees a little more and tune in
[2:07:23] with the Lord Jesus Christ because there
[2:07:25] should be nothing in this world that can
[2:07:27] shake our experience with this message
[2:07:29] of the hour because this message of the
[2:07:30] hour isn't about just books and tapes
[2:07:33] it's about Christ Jesus in you Christ in
[2:07:36] you the hope of
[2:07:39] glory right I'm only saying this not to
[2:07:41] mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out
[2:07:43] that we might get away from this fear
[2:07:45] and scare Don't Be Afraid brothers and
[2:07:46] sisters you don't know who you are you
[2:07:48] you are not going to be but now you are
[2:07:51] the sons of God see you always were the
[2:07:54] sons of God see how can we remain quiet
[2:07:57] brothers and sisters like our song the
[2:07:59] special that we heard when we've been
[2:08:00] saved when we've been redeemed when
[2:08:02] we've been shown that we've been given
[2:08:03] the keys to the kingdom already that the
[2:08:05] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[2:08:08] how can we remain
[2:08:10] quiet I don't know I can just say this
[2:08:14] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[2:08:16] them and Lord willing I'm going to shout
[2:08:18] that I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[2:08:20] of them there's people everywhere who
[2:08:22] heart hearts are all a flame yes but
[2:08:26] then there's other people that just
[2:08:28] maybe haven't got there yet and you know
[2:08:30] what it's a one room Schoolhouse we get
[2:08:32] that not going to judge anyone I just
[2:08:34] want to encourage everyone to get to
[2:08:35] Christ because if you can get to Christ
[2:08:37] then you know what all of the other
[2:08:39] problems are just going to start to fade
[2:08:40] away they won't go away but they'll fade
[2:08:44] away I think it's such a beautiful thing
[2:08:46] that's one of the reasons that I really
[2:08:48] enjoy enjoyed going to church when I
[2:08:50] first got saved it just did something to
[2:08:52] me I could walk through those doors half
[2:08:55] an hour before service I wish I could do
[2:08:57] that
[2:08:58] now but I'd walk through those doors
[2:09:01] half an hour before service and I would
[2:09:02] come in and I would sit
[2:09:04] down and I would I would listen to the
[2:09:07] music and I would begin to get into the
[2:09:10] spirit I would feel the atmosphere I'd
[2:09:13] feel the the problems and the issues of
[2:09:15] My Life Begin to fade out they'd begin
[2:09:18] should lessen and lessen and slowly
[2:09:21] disappear and then I would start to
[2:09:23] really feel the presence of the Lord in
[2:09:27] the moment well before any singing or
[2:09:29] musician started just that atmosphere of
[2:09:31] getting together knowing what I was
[2:09:33] going to do in a few moments I had the
[2:09:35] opportunity to worship the most high God
[2:09:38] oh my in that pre-service moment and I
[2:09:40] can say this by experience I hope
[2:09:41] everyone else can as well I'm not trying
[2:09:43] to say anything about myself but I can
[2:09:45] say I've heard from the Lord himself to
[2:09:47] my heart heart many many times in that
[2:09:50] pre-service music just by coming and
[2:09:52] getting in this atmosphere and sitting
[2:09:54] there and just humbling myself in the
[2:09:56] sight of the Lord so that he would lift
[2:09:58] me up not that he would lift me up to
[2:10:00] minister that he would lift me up in my
[2:10:02] spirit in the position that I was
[2:10:06] in that's why we get together so that he
[2:10:10] can lift us up we humble ourselves in
[2:10:13] the sight of the Lord so that he can
[2:10:14] lift us up we want to be seated in
[2:10:16] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus yes we
[2:10:21] have the ability to see this world Fade
[2:10:23] Away amen oh
[2:10:29] my out of adoption
[2:10:32] 1960 adoption number four amen paragraph
[2:10:37] 55 brother Bram says now remember we
[2:10:39] went through it this
[2:10:40] morning you wasn't saved by the
[2:10:44] blood you're kept saved by the blood
[2:10:47] amen
[2:10:48] but you were saved by grace through
[2:10:51] faith believing
[2:10:53] it God knocked at your heart because he
[2:10:56] predestinated
[2:10:58] youall it wasn't an accident brothers
[2:11:01] and
[2:11:02] sisters it wasn't an accident that we
[2:11:04] have the ability to hear this word in
[2:11:06] our lives that we were born into the
[2:11:07] families that we were born into that we
[2:11:09] have the problems that we have that the
[2:11:11] circumstances or the circumstances the
[2:11:13] situations are situations it's not an
[2:11:15] accident there's no accidents amen
[2:11:18] you looked up and believed it accepted
[2:11:21] it now the blood makes an atonement for
[2:11:23] your sins remember I said God does not
[2:11:27] condemn a sinner for sinning he's a
[2:11:29] sinner to begin with he condemns a
[2:11:32] Christian for
[2:11:33] sinning and then because he has
[2:11:35] condemned him Christ took our
[2:11:38] condemnation so there's no condemnation
[2:11:41] to them which are in Christ Jesus that
[2:11:43] walk not after the flesh but after the
[2:11:47] spirit and I just want to say Abraham he
[2:11:50] staggered not at the promise of God
[2:11:52] through
[2:11:53] unbelief oh my but he was strong in
[2:11:57] faith giving glory to
[2:12:00] God and if he is the father spiritually
[2:12:05] if we are the spiritual Seed of Abraham
[2:12:08] and I could bring a quote that brother
[2:12:09] bam would say that we
[2:12:11] are then stagger not brothers and
[2:12:13] sisters don't stagger just keep going
[2:12:17] just get up just get up and keep going
[2:12:21] and I know everyone here but I know
[2:12:23] there's some that aren't here just get
[2:12:25] up and keep going there's no
[2:12:28] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[2:12:32] Jesus excuse me that walk not after the
[2:12:35] flesh but after the spirit and if you do
[2:12:38] anything wrong it isn't
[2:12:41] willfully but be clear you're going to
[2:12:44] do something
[2:12:46] wrong even the most polished believer in
[2:12:50] this flesh is going to do something
[2:12:52] wrong
[2:12:53] amen and I'm sorry brothers and sisters
[2:12:56] and I know I know brother Peter I'm
[2:13:00] saying it I'm sorry I'm going to do
[2:13:02] something
[2:13:04] wrong I am
[2:13:06] fallible don't think I'm not fallible
[2:13:09] I'm just a guy I'm just a man born in
[2:13:11] sin shaped in iniquity come to the world
[2:13:13] speaking lies but apparently God's
[2:13:15] called me to stand here I'm going to
[2:13:18] disappoint people but don't look at me
[2:13:21] look to Christ if you're looking at me
[2:13:24] then you've got the wrong version of the
[2:13:28] message just listen to what I
[2:13:31] say I know that I have to live my life
[2:13:34] according to the word and I fully intend
[2:13:35] to but I know I'm going to be make
[2:13:37] mistakes and I'm going to say will you
[2:13:40] forgive me and I trust in Christ you'll
[2:13:43] be able to am just like if you do
[2:13:46] something wrong and you say it to me
[2:13:48] and I'm going to say I forgive you
[2:13:51] because I know he forgave
[2:13:54] me and I didn't deserve it right but he
[2:13:57] still forgave
[2:13:59] meu he took and bore my sin and my shame
[2:14:02] amen and was stripped naked and tacked
[2:14:04] to a cross for my
[2:14:07] sin my how could I ever hold anything
[2:14:10] against a brother or
[2:14:13] sister but there's no condemnation to
[2:14:16] them which are in Christ Jesus that walk
[2:14:18] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[2:14:20] but you know when you see people walking
[2:14:22] after the flesh oh my there's all kinds
[2:14:24] of condemnation isn't there and you know
[2:14:26] what happens is it doesn't manifest
[2:14:28] where they say oh I've got this and I've
[2:14:29] got that and oh there's this other thing
[2:14:31] and I just oh I've got all this
[2:14:33] condemnation no they start pointing at
[2:14:34] other people well why is that like that
[2:14:36] oh my what's with this over here why do
[2:14:40] they have that you know what when we're
[2:14:42] walking in the flesh brothers and
[2:14:43] sisters there's condemnation but when
[2:14:45] we're not walking in the flesh and and
[2:14:47] Abraham he wasn't Walking In the Flesh
[2:14:49] Abraham called the things that were as
[2:14:51] though they weren't and the things that
[2:14:53] weren't as though they were imagine if
[2:14:55] we did that in our own lives imagine if
[2:14:57] we did that in our brothers and our
[2:14:58] sisters lives even though we can see a
[2:15:01] manifestation that we can see is
[2:15:08] real bear with me I'm sorry for
[2:15:12] coughing if you do anything wrong it
[2:15:14] isn't
[2:15:15] willfully you don't sin willfully a man
[2:15:18] that sins willfully goes out and
[2:15:20] willfully sins never come into that body
[2:15:23] yet never really did never really had
[2:15:27] that
[2:15:28] experience did you ever think of that
[2:15:31] people don't get saved today and lost
[2:15:33] Tomorrow People don't get filled with
[2:15:35] the Holy Ghost and then turn their back
[2:15:36] on it because the word of God says it's
[2:15:38] impossible for those who were once
[2:15:40] enlightened and have tasted of the
[2:15:42] Heavenly gift and we know it says to
[2:15:43] renew themselves once again but why
[2:15:46] would they ever do that if they were
[2:15:47] filled with the Holy ho ghost they don't
[2:15:48] need to renew themselves they don't need
[2:15:49] to get the Holy Ghost again they can
[2:15:51] never ever
[2:15:53] fall amen and I want to say that to us
[2:15:56] today brothers and sisters if you get
[2:15:58] the Holy Ghost in your life you'll never
[2:16:00] fall right if you do do these things you
[2:16:03] shall never fall we read that scripture
[2:16:05] and I said go back and read it and I
[2:16:07] highly recommend
[2:16:08] it excuse me but a man that's once in
[2:16:12] there he's dead and his life is hid in
[2:16:16] God through Christ sealed by the Holy
[2:16:20] Ghost I just love this part I'll call
[2:16:22] the musicians it's after 12 I know it's
[2:16:26] getting a little bit longer I just get
[2:16:29] excited about this it just does
[2:16:32] something there's a rock of Revelation
[2:16:34] brothers and sisters that we all have
[2:16:36] been given yes and it's this message of
[2:16:39] the hour and it's not the message itself
[2:16:41] that is the rock of Revelation that's
[2:16:43] what this message brings the message is
[2:16:46] actually an opportunity it's it's an
[2:16:48] invitation to come to the wedding supper
[2:16:50] of the Lord it it's an opportunity to
[2:16:53] recognize it's Christ himself knocking
[2:16:56] on the heart of a
[2:16:57] Believer brother brandham says but a man
[2:17:00] that's once in there remember seated in
[2:17:03] Heavenly places a man that's once in
[2:17:05] there he's dead amen and his life is hid
[2:17:08] in God through Christ sealed by the Holy
[2:17:12] Ghost oh
[2:17:16] my have it there beautiful and the devil
[2:17:20] can't even find
[2:17:22] him I don't think the devil wants me
[2:17:24] saying this because he's choking me up
[2:17:27] here I'm going to read it again but a
[2:17:30] man that's once in there he's dead and
[2:17:33] his life is hidden God through
[2:17:36] Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost and the
[2:17:39] devil can't even find him he's so far
[2:17:41] back in there he'll have to come out of
[2:17:44] there before the devil can ever get him
[2:17:47] for you are dead oh brother God bless
[2:17:51] you and that is the life of a Believer
[2:17:53] that's where we are today brothers and
[2:17:56] sisters when we're seated in Heavenly
[2:17:57] places the devil can't even find you
[2:18:03] Hallelujah and you know we're going to
[2:18:05] say well maybe brother Barry how does
[2:18:07] that work because I still have problems
[2:18:09] and I know that I'm sealed I know that
[2:18:11] I've got the holy ghost in my
[2:18:13] life what's your approach to those
[2:18:15] problems brothers and
[2:18:16] sisters because that shows who we
[2:18:23] are excuse me ah I'm getting it wrong
[2:18:27] but that's that's where we're at today
[2:18:30] yes that's why I said earlier I'll say
[2:18:34] it again as we close maybe stand with me
[2:18:36] you
[2:18:37] know when the heat is on when the
[2:18:40] pressure comes that's what
[2:18:43] shows not what's on the inside but who's
[2:18:46] on the inside
[2:18:48] amen that's what shows who we really
[2:18:53] are brother bradam said it very clearly
[2:18:55] that that's that's what takes place but
[2:18:58] I just love this quote I'm going to read
[2:18:59] it again here but if a man a man that's
[2:19:03] once in there he's dead and his life is
[2:19:05] hid in God through Christ sealed by the
[2:19:07] Holy Ghost and the devil can't even find
[2:19:09] him he's so far back in there so I want
[2:19:13] to say can't even find
[2:19:16] you
[2:19:18] really doesn't like me saying
[2:19:20] that the devil can't even find him he's
[2:19:23] so far back in there am the devil can't
[2:19:26] even find
[2:19:28] you when you're so far back in there
[2:19:31] amen sealed by the Holy Ghost the devil
[2:19:34] can't even find you that's
[2:19:36] right you'll have to come out of there
[2:19:38] before the devil can even get
[2:19:41] you for you are
[2:19:44] dead and I love this next part he says
[2:19:46] tell a dead man he's a hypocrite and see
[2:19:48] what
[2:19:49] happens right kick him on one side and
[2:19:53] say you old hypocrite you he'll not say
[2:19:55] a
[2:20:00] word praise the
[2:20:02] Lord he says he'll just lay there kick a
[2:20:06] corpse see what happens he'll just lay
[2:20:09] there and a man that's dead in Christ
[2:20:12] you can call him a hypocrite call him
[2:20:15] anything you want to he'll never raise
[2:20:17] up about
[2:20:18] it if anything he'll slip off somewhere
[2:20:21] and pray for you that's
[2:20:24] right but oh some of them's very much
[2:20:28] alive let someone call us something let
[2:20:31] the pressure come see who's on the
[2:20:35] inside that's what I think about we're
[2:20:37] supposed to bury the dead people them
[2:20:39] that's dead in Christ we bury them in
[2:20:45] water I'm beginning to wonder if maybe
[2:20:47] maybe the Lord's just saying stop
[2:20:51] talking sometimes we bury too many
[2:20:53] people that's
[2:20:54] alive too much malice and strife and
[2:20:57] there's too much in the church but we
[2:21:00] can't separate that but God
[2:21:02] does he knows his people he knows his
[2:21:05] sheep he knows every voice he knows his
[2:21:08] children he knows who he can call out he
[2:21:10] knows who he's
[2:21:14] predestinated and I want to say this
[2:21:17] they don't always know it but eventually
[2:21:19] they will just by getting Washed by the
[2:21:22] Water of the word spiritual Amnesia will
[2:21:25] begin to wash away it will begin to wear
[2:21:26] off they'll begin to say wow could that
[2:21:29] possibly be me could I fit that could I
[2:21:32] be seated in heav any places in Christ
[2:21:34] Jesus but do you know what I've done do
[2:21:35] you know where I've gone do you know
[2:21:37] what I've experienced you know what I'm
[2:21:39] here to tell you as a living witness his
[2:21:41] grace goes a long ways brothers and
[2:21:43] sisters a long
[2:21:46] ways amen but it's for whosoever will
[2:21:50] whosoever will be able to hear his voice
[2:21:53] Hallelujah my goodness he's given these
[2:21:58] things what he's making himself known
[2:22:02] through he God can put confidence in his
[2:22:05] children yes on what to do knowing that
[2:22:09] they will do
[2:22:10] exactly this morning I want to say it
[2:22:12] brothers and sisters if we get this
[2:22:14] revelation of the message of the hour
[2:22:16] that this is not just for Simon bar
[2:22:19] Jonah and not just for Peter this is for
[2:22:22] the Church of the Living God to get this
[2:22:23] revelation of Christ in you the hope of
[2:22:25] glory when we get that Revelation when
[2:22:27] we get sealed by the Holy Ghost then we
[2:22:29] are already seated in Heavenly places in
[2:22:31] Christ Jesus and then we recognize that
[2:22:33] we always were we just came into this
[2:22:36] world and we were bypassed our
[2:22:38] theophanies we just had this this
[2:22:39] experience that we had to go through but
[2:22:42] boy oh boy when it becomes real to us
[2:22:44] the gates of hell it can't prevail
[2:22:47] against it am God bless you this morning

[2:22:50] pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're
[2:22:53] so thankful that we
