[30:40] to Bear witness of the light
[30:42] that all men through him might believe
[30:47] he was not that light
[30:49] but was sent
[30:52] to Bear witness of that light
[30:55] that was the True Light which lighteth
[30:58] every man
[30:59] that cometh into the world
[31:03] he was in the world
[31:04] and the world was made by him
[31:08] and the world knew him not
[31:11] he came unto his own and his own
[31:13] received him not
[31:16] but as many as received him
[31:19] to them
[31:21] gave he power to become the sons of God
[31:25] even to them that believe on his name
[31:31] which were born
[31:33] not of blood nor of the will of Flesh
[31:36] nor of the will of man
[31:39] but of God
[31:41] let's just bow in prayer
[31:45] Heavenly Father once again we're just so
[31:48] thankful for this word that you've given
[31:49] us
[31:50] Lord we're so thankful for the word that
[31:52] you've given us that Lord isn't just a
[31:55] word it's not just in print in books
[31:59] in text but it's a Living Word
[32:02] father it's a light and and it's a life
[32:05] it's a living breathing life and father
[32:10] we just thank you that this word just
[32:12] comes to life every single time it's on
[32:15] the lips of a son and daughter of God
[32:18] any one of those people that we just
[32:20] read about that chooses to believe upon
[32:23] you
[32:24] to them
[32:26] give you power to become the sons of God
[32:29] father this morning my prayer is that
[32:32] each and every one of us Lord could just
[32:34] come to that full realization about
[32:38] being a son or a daughter of God
[32:41] because Lord we believe on you if
[32:44] there's anybody listening today Lord
[32:46] Jesus that doesn't have that Revelation
[32:48] that just doesn't really believe upon
[32:51] you I pray we pray to this morning Lord
[32:54] that you would just open the eyes of
[32:56] their understanding that father you
[32:58] would just take away all of the unbelief
[33:01] and just allow them to believe
[33:03] in the name of Jesus Christ we just ask
[33:06] that you had blessed the reading of your
[33:07] word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[33:09] amen
[33:11] thank you you may be seated this morning
[33:17] it's just a wonderful thing to serve the
[33:19] Living God and
[33:21] it's difficult to
[33:24] know that we serve the Living God and to
[33:27] see what the devil does continuously as
[33:30] we were on our way here we were talking
[33:31] about
[33:33] how the devil has just ravaged the world
[33:36] how this truly is Satan's Eden
[33:39] and outside of this word there really is
[33:42] no hope
[33:44] to look at all of the things that are
[33:46] going on around we've got more
[33:48] technology and more ability and more
[33:53] means more more and more
[33:57] but less and less word less and less
[34:00] encouragement to the things of God
[34:03] but for those people who who actually
[34:05] have been called
[34:08] from before the foundation of the world
[34:10] to them gave he power to become the sons
[34:12] of God
[34:14] even to them that just believe on his
[34:16] name
[34:17] isn't it wonderful to think about how
[34:21] as he Bears witness as John Bear's
[34:23] witness he says name not names
[34:26] it's not father Son and Holy Ghost it's
[34:28] not titles
[34:30] it's it's name
[34:32] but anyways
[34:35] we can just get going on a tangent and I
[34:37] apologize this morning I just want to
[34:39] take a little time and talk about this
[34:41] light and and I would like to talk about
[34:44] being sent
[34:46] verse 8 he was not that light John was
[34:49] not that light John the Baptist was not
[34:52] that light
[34:54] but he was sent to Bear witness of that
[34:56] light
[34:57] and we know that there's a very specific
[34:59] anointing with John the Baptist ministry
[35:02] and so I'm sure that we can all just
[35:05] take that and do a complete comparison a
[35:07] parallel with William Branham today and
[35:10] I just want to throw this out there if
[35:13] anybody's listening that maybe doesn't
[35:14] have the understanding of a prophet and
[35:16] maybe if we hear that word Prophet it
[35:18] makes us get a little bit nervous and
[35:21] and a little bit unsure because of all
[35:23] of the different uh fanaticism around
[35:26] the world that we've been able to
[35:28] witness
[35:29] why is it that that there is that fear
[35:32] it's because there's been doctrines of
[35:35] devils there's been people who have gone
[35:37] fanatical but the reason for it is is
[35:40] because they are not the true but the
[35:43] only way that they could do that and
[35:45] impersonate is that there would be a
[35:46] true and there would be a purpose for a
[35:49] prophet
[35:50] so imagine if we could just step back
[35:52] for a second many people can watch
[35:54] Hollywood movies and completely suspend
[35:57] their their cognitive thinking and allow
[36:00] themselves to enter into a fantasy world
[36:02] and just become one with it and allow
[36:05] the movie to just take them wherever the
[36:07] movie directors would allow it to go and
[36:09] we know we could go down a long road
[36:11] with that and I don't want to most if
[36:13] not all of it from Hollywood is from the
[36:15] pit of Hell and we don't want to try and
[36:17] and propagate that but I just want to
[36:19] say it this way if we can be as an
[36:22] unbeliever looking at the message of the
[36:24] hour and to hear a minister or anybody
[36:26] say prophet of our day
[36:29] and have us get weird about it just
[36:31] maybe try and suspend your your your
[36:33] cognitive thinking as you would normally
[36:35] with a Hollywood movie and just see if
[36:38] God sent a prophet to this world in this
[36:41] day would you want to hear what that
[36:43] Prophet had to say because what is a
[36:46] prophet a prophet is a messenger someone
[36:48] that has a message
[36:50] and you know if we break it down the
[36:53] word profit can mean preacher
[36:56] so it could just be a preacher but if
[36:58] there was a prophet which there was I'm
[37:01] not asking whether there was I know
[37:02] there was it's been made very Crystal
[37:04] Clear real to me that there was a
[37:07] prophet sent to this age God sent a
[37:09] prophet
[37:11] but it means more to us than that some
[37:14] people will just say that's enough God
[37:15] sent a prophet it's good I believe that
[37:18] that settles it but that's not why God
[37:20] said a prophet if that's all it is then
[37:23] we need a little a little checking up to
[37:25] do with our our our experience
[37:28] but if God sent a prophet to the world
[37:30] in any age we could step back and look
[37:32] at Noah's age if we are in that in that
[37:34] state of of of of mystery and and maybe
[37:38] the the the storytelling part if we just
[37:41] looked at Noah's day
[37:42] if God sent a prophet Noah and sent a
[37:46] message to Noah to build an ark wouldn't
[37:48] we want to know that message and Noah's
[37:51] day
[37:52] fast forward to our day if God sent a
[37:55] prophet to our day would we not want to
[37:57] hear what that Prophet had to say
[37:59] goodness sakes I I just can't get over
[38:03] that it's so important for us to just at
[38:05] least take a look at it and see if God
[38:08] sent a prophet what would that Prophet
[38:10] say to this age
[38:12] what would he do
[38:15] I could tell you what he would do and I
[38:17] know I'm preaching to the choir so bear
[38:18] with me
[38:20] but he would simply point to this
[38:23] that's all he would do his point to this
[38:26] he wouldn't come out with a new book
[38:28] he wouldn't come out with a new
[38:29] interpretation of an old book he
[38:31] wouldn't add to it and he wouldn't take
[38:34] away from it and he would say that if if
[38:37] you have any question about what I have
[38:39] to say in this day don't take my word
[38:42] for it
[38:43] take his word for it
[38:48] but just to just to go back and take a
[38:51] quick look here
[38:52] just to set a little bit of a background
[38:54] in the beginning was the word and the
[38:56] Word was with God and the Word was God
[39:00] the same was in the beginning with God
[39:04] he just takes the time to really just
[39:07] lay the foundation to go right back to
[39:08] Genesis right here and and we've gone
[39:11] over that a little bit
[39:13] and and we know what happened in the
[39:16] Book of Genesis in in the beginning it
[39:18] was God speaking into creation and God
[39:21] had a plan from before the foundation of
[39:24] the world and many times we we look at
[39:27] these things in our lives today and and
[39:28] we wonder why why do we have to
[39:31] experience such pain
[39:33] sometimes we look at other people's
[39:35] lives sometimes we experience it in our
[39:37] own lives tremendous pain pain that it
[39:40] feels like we'll never be able to get
[39:41] over or get through
[39:43] but remember his word said that he will
[39:45] always provide us a way of Escape
[39:48] he won't take the pain away from us but
[39:50] he'll take us through it
[39:51] he'll bring us through it out to the
[39:53] other side
[39:57] the reason that we experience all of
[39:59] this the reason that we're going through
[40:00] all of this is that God in the beginning
[40:02] he created a bride in the garden
[40:07] and and he wanted to express himself
[40:10] remember brother Branham said it very
[40:12] clearly that he wanted to express
[40:13] himself to his children he wanted
[40:16] Fellowship he wanted a family Christ is
[40:18] the mystery of God revealed go go back
[40:20] and listen to it it explains it real
[40:22] good he had a threefold purpose but he
[40:24] wanted to express himself he wanted a
[40:26] family he wanted to have fellowship and
[40:29] so what did he do he created man in his
[40:31] own image and male and female created he
[40:35] them
[40:36] and and both of them were in one being
[40:39] in a spirit being and then he created
[40:43] man formed Man Out of the Dust of the
[40:45] Earth
[40:46] but they were both still male and female
[40:48] I don't want to get too far into that
[40:50] but what what I'm getting at is there
[40:52] was a time where God's plan started to
[40:54] unfold and where it started to unfold
[40:57] was I guess in in the creation of
[40:59] everything but for our day to look at
[41:01] the transgression and all the problems
[41:03] that we have there was a transgression
[41:05] of God's law and that's where it started
[41:07] to happen that's where the law of the
[41:09] contrast started to become visible
[41:12] in Genesis Chapter 3 The transgression
[41:15] and the curse we know that the serpent
[41:17] beguiled Eve
[41:19] and the serpent beguiled Eve with one
[41:22] word
[41:23] not a theological study
[41:25] or or a theological handbook
[41:28] but one word thou shalt not
[41:31] surely die
[41:34] one word
[41:35] and she was beguiled but it was an atom
[41:37] that was beguiled in first Timothy
[41:40] chapter 2 verse 14 and Adam was not
[41:42] deceived but the woman being deceived
[41:45] was in the transgression
[41:48] now we're not saying that to actually
[41:50] say well throw off on women
[41:54] some might say they're the weaker vessel
[41:57] that's what the word says
[41:59] but we're not getting into that today
[42:01] I'll just leave that as a hanger
[42:04] and uh all the married folk out there
[42:06] can
[42:07] have a discussion on the way home
[42:11] but we know that Adam wasn't in the
[42:13] transgression
[42:15] even though he was
[42:17] because Adam chose his wife
[42:21] Adam chose to follow his wife
[42:24] and because of that
[42:26] the entire curse started to unfold
[42:30] and
[42:32] the plan of God
[42:33] because God didn't just come down into
[42:35] the garden remember he didn't come down
[42:37] into the Garden of Eden after the sin
[42:39] happened after the transgression
[42:41] happened after the the the the the not
[42:45] eating of the fruit happened
[42:48] God came down into the garden when they
[42:50] were hiding themselves because suddenly
[42:51] they knew they were naked what
[42:53] difference would it make just out of
[42:55] curiosity what difference would it make
[42:57] if you had an apple if you were naked
[42:59] and you didn't know that you were naked
[43:01] what what difference would it make it
[43:02] wouldn't make any difference whatsoever
[43:04] they never ate an apple it wasn't fruit
[43:07] they ate in the garden
[43:08] but God came down into the garden the
[43:10] cool of evening to fellowship with them
[43:12] which he he wanted to do every single
[43:15] day and he didn't run around in the
[43:16] garden ringing his hand saying Adam Adam
[43:19] where are you I can't see you you're not
[43:22] visible to me anymore
[43:24] then Adam come out and and being covered
[43:26] in in fig leaves and aprons that they
[43:29] sowed together
[43:31] it wasn't like that
[43:33] he came down and said Adam what's up
[43:35] what on Earth have you done
[43:39] Adam where are you because I know you're
[43:41] in the transgression and you're no
[43:43] longer where you stood before me
[43:45] in perfect health now you've fallen in
[43:48] sin you've chosen
[43:50] to take that step
[43:52] but he knew that he would
[43:57] we know that in Genesis chapter 4.
[44:00] says that she conceived
[44:02] and I just want to talk about this light
[44:04] and this is really the comparison that
[44:07] I'm getting at but I I just wanted to
[44:08] set that background that she was in the
[44:10] garden they transgressed they actually
[44:12] came out of the garden she actually
[44:15] conceived again and she bear another son
[44:18] remember that scripture Genesis chapter
[44:21] 4 and then she says I have gotten a man
[44:24] from the Lord
[44:26] but that was Kane she said it about
[44:30] how could that be Cain was of his father
[44:32] the evil one
[44:34] I don't want to get into that discussion
[44:36] too far this morning but I just want to
[44:38] bring that out to highlight it there's
[44:40] there's a purpose for that the reason
[44:42] why it was written that way and brother
[44:45] Brandon brings it out very clearly that
[44:46] there's only one way that a human being
[44:50] is born is because life is given to that
[44:53] person
[44:54] and there's only one form of life
[45:00] she said that I've gotten a man from the
[45:02] Lord first John or John sorry not first
[45:05] John John 1
[45:07] verse 9.
[45:10] that was the True Light which lighteth
[45:13] every man that cometh into the world
[45:16] speaking about life
[45:19] the only way there is life is because of
[45:22] God because remember at the beginning in
[45:24] the beginning was the word the word was
[45:25] with God and the Word was God and the
[45:28] same was in the beginning with God all
[45:30] things were made by him and without him
[45:33] was not anything made that was made
[45:37] there's no human being made on this
[45:39] Earth that's not made by God
[45:42] not at all
[45:43] that's why it's so amazing when you look
[45:46] at what brother Branham says about
[45:48] babies all babies go to heaven
[45:51] and if you look at it
[45:53] maybe sometime I don't know one of the
[45:55] brothers if you feel inspired to uh or
[45:58] maybe Lord willing I'll do it
[46:00] if you look at the whole abortion debate
[46:04] it's a sensitive touchy issue boy and
[46:08] the only reason it is is because it's
[46:10] Satan's Eden
[46:12] but if you look at it it's for a purpose
[46:16] and uh
[46:18] yeah I'll just stop there I won't get
[46:20] into it too far
[46:22] but there's only one form of life that's
[46:24] given on this Earth and it comes from
[46:25] God
[46:29] you know that she was given a man
[46:32] and though it was from two different
[46:34] fathers two two boys
[46:37] two different Spirits one was of his
[46:40] father
[46:41] Adam and the other was of his father the
[46:44] devil
[46:46] the Natural Life
[46:48] that we see there it types the spiritual
[46:51] we know that
[46:53] and you know the point that I'm making
[46:55] with this part here in particular is
[46:57] that there's no eternal hell
[46:59] there's no eternal
[47:02] whatsoever
[47:03] outside of Zoe God's own life
[47:07] the only thing that's eternal
[47:10] is life
[47:11] there's no Eternal death
[47:14] there is an eternal separation from God
[47:18] but it's just that's what it is it's a
[47:21] separation
[47:23] this morning I want to get into just
[47:26] setting the background of of of the
[47:28] Gospel of John
[47:30] and and talking about this we're
[47:32] probably going to be here for a little
[47:33] while not today but in the future just
[47:35] just the life the light that was given
[47:39] sent into the world and that there was a
[47:42] man that was sent to Bear witness of it
[47:44] and and here we go talking about now
[47:47] many different different stories of of
[47:50] lives that were sent lives that were
[47:54] sent to Bear witness of that light of
[47:57] that life the only form of eternal life
[48:01] turn with me over to Acts chapter 8.
[48:13] Acts chapter 8.
[48:16] just going to focus on on this probably
[48:18] for the majority this morning
[48:30] um you know what maybe we'll just read
[48:31] it just for
[48:37] bear with me for a second
[48:42] yeah we might as well just start with
[48:44] verse one Acts chapter eight and Saul
[48:46] was consenting unto his death
[48:49] who are talking about Stephen
[48:51] and at that time there was a great
[48:53] persecution against the church which was
[48:54] at Jerusalem and they were all scattered
[48:57] abroad throughout the regions of Judea
[48:59] and Samaria
[49:00] except the apostles
[49:03] and devout man carried Stephen to his
[49:05] burial and made great lemon lamentation
[49:07] over him as for Saul he made Havoc of
[49:10] the church entering into every house and
[49:13] hailing men and women committed them to
[49:15] prison
[49:16] therefore they that were scattered
[49:18] abroad went everywhere preaching the
[49:20] word
[49:21] this is what I want to get to then
[49:23] Philip went down to the city of Samaria
[49:26] and preached Christ unto them
[49:29] and the people with one Accord gave heed
[49:31] unto those things which Philip spake
[49:32] hearing and seeing the Miracles which he
[49:34] did for unclean spirits crying with a
[49:37] loud voice came out of many that were
[49:39] possessed with them
[49:41] and many taken with palsies that were
[49:44] lame were healed
[49:46] and there was great joy in that City
[49:49] but there was a certain man called Simon
[49:52] which Before Time in the same same city
[49:55] use sorcery and bewitched the people of
[49:58] Samaria
[49:59] giving out that himself was some great
[50:01] one
[50:02] to whom they all gave heed from the
[50:05] least to the greatest saying this man is
[50:08] the great power of God
[50:12] looking at that is just amazing to think
[50:14] that people would regard a person to be
[50:17] the great power of God
[50:20] it's no different today
[50:22] there's people out there that look at
[50:24] men and exalt them to that level
[50:27] and it's up to those people whether
[50:29] they're willing to actually consent to
[50:32] that behavior or whether they will be
[50:34] like the prophet for our day that said
[50:36] if that's what you're going to do you're
[50:37] going to make me an antichrist and I'll
[50:39] take myself off the field until you stop
[50:41] it
[50:43] but this guy here
[50:46] they viewed him as the great power of
[50:48] God verse 11.
[50:50] and to him they had regard because of
[50:52] that long time he had Bewitched them
[50:54] with sorceries
[50:57] but when they believed Philip
[51:01] when they believed Philip preaching the
[51:03] things concerning the kingdom of God and
[51:05] the name of Jesus Christ
[51:07] they were baptized both men and women
[51:11] then Simon himself believed also
[51:15] and when he was baptized he continued
[51:17] with Philip and wondered beholding the
[51:19] Miracles and signs
[51:21] which were done
[51:24] just gonna pause there
[51:26] at verse 13. it's interesting to look at
[51:29] this now this man who had Bewitched the
[51:32] people
[51:33] saw the power of God
[51:35] for real
[51:37] and decided I want to get baptized I
[51:40] want to become a part of this I'm used
[51:42] to having this kind of power but now I
[51:45] can see there is another Power
[51:48] and I I I should be a part of that I
[51:50] want to be a part of that I want to
[51:52] partake of that power
[51:54] and so he went through the motions he
[51:56] went through the steps he went to the
[51:57] meetings and and he got baptized
[52:01] but we know we'll read on a little bit
[52:03] here it doesn't mean anything because
[52:06] we've been baptized
[52:08] and the reason for it is is the purpose
[52:11] in his heart the reason he wanted to get
[52:13] baptized was not right
[52:17] we can just go on and read here verse
[52:20] verse 14 now
[52:22] when the apostles which read Jerusalem
[52:24] heard
[52:25] that Samaria had received the word of
[52:27] God they sent unto them Peter and John
[52:30] so now it's getting serious
[52:33] they're seeing the move of God they're
[52:34] having great Miracles and and great
[52:37] meetings a great campaign going on the
[52:40] the kingdom of God is really starting to
[52:42] push forward so they're they're sending
[52:44] in the big guns
[52:47] verse 15 who went who sorry who when
[52:51] they were come down prayed for them that
[52:54] they might receive the Holy Ghost
[52:56] for as yet
[52:57] he was Fallen upon none of them
[53:00] only they were baptized in the name of
[53:04] the Lord Jesus
[53:06] sometimes we can get baptized in the
[53:09] name of the Lord Jesus and not see any
[53:11] results
[53:13] well we've heard it said many times we
[53:15] can go down wet sinner and come up go
[53:18] down dry sorry and come up wet be the
[53:20] same person and not have a change and
[53:23] what's the reason for it we'll get to it
[53:24] here but it's what's in our heart it's
[53:27] what's in the person's heart
[53:29] we can Bluff ourselves and we can Bluff
[53:31] other people but we can't Bluff God or
[53:33] Satan
[53:34] they're both waiting to see whose side
[53:36] we're going to choose and and it can't
[53:38] be a wishy-washy choice
[53:40] it's got to be all in
[53:42] but when it is all in
[53:45] I can I can testify to this when it is
[53:48] all in
[53:49] when the desire changes that's when you
[53:51] get the Holy Ghost
[53:52] it's not because you go down in water
[53:55] you can get the Holy Ghost before you
[53:57] actually get baptized with water
[54:01] but you will get baptized in water if
[54:04] you get the Holy Ghost
[54:06] you won't say no it's good I don't need
[54:08] to do it because it's a scriptural uh
[54:12] ordinance
[54:15] verse 15 who when they were come down
[54:17] prayed for them that they might receive
[54:18] the Holy Ghost
[54:20] for as yet he was Fallen upon none of
[54:22] them
[54:24] only they were baptized in the name of
[54:26] the Lord Jesus
[54:28] they had great meetings they're having a
[54:30] great time
[54:31] they still hadn't seen the Holy Ghost
[54:33] yet
[54:34] verse 17 then they laid their hands on
[54:36] them and they received the Holy Ghost
[54:39] and when Simon saw through the laying on
[54:42] of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was
[54:45] given
[54:46] he offered them money
[54:48] saying give me also this power
[54:51] that on whomsoever I lay hands he may
[54:55] receive the Holy Ghost
[54:58] so isn't it interesting because what
[55:00] he's asking for is exactly what they did
[55:03] he's not asking for something outside of
[55:05] what they did it's exactly what they did
[55:09] but his motive is wrong
[55:13] you know brother Branham tells that
[55:14] story about that woman that says I'm
[55:15] ready to go down there and get dunked I
[55:17] want to dunk me today
[55:19] and he said you're not you're not ready
[55:21] you're you're nowhere near the condition
[55:23] that you need to be to approach that
[55:26] ordinance of the scripture we have got
[55:28] to have the right Spirit we've got to
[55:30] have the right heart if we're going to
[55:31] get baptized if we want to see the right
[55:33] results otherwise why would we get
[55:34] baptized if we don't want the Holy Ghost
[55:36] if we don't want to see that results in
[55:38] our life
[55:39] it just doesn't make any sense we
[55:41] wouldn't want to do it
[55:43] he said give me that Holy Ghost that
[55:45] that that that on whomsoever I lay hands
[55:48] he may receive the Holy Ghost verse 20
[55:51] but Peter said unto him thy money perish
[55:53] with thee because thou Hast that
[55:56] thou Hast thought that the gift of God
[55:59] may be purchased with money
[56:01] thou Hast neither part nor lot on this
[56:04] matter for thy heart is not right in the
[56:06] sight of God repent therefore of this
[56:09] thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps
[56:12] the thought of thine heart may be
[56:15] forgiven thee
[56:17] for I perceive that thou art in in the
[56:20] gall of bitterness and in the bond of
[56:22] iniquity
[56:24] he just totally discerns him there
[56:27] and says you know you've got some work
[56:28] to do
[56:29] you're still just a little bit too
[56:31] carnal for this
[56:34] then answered Simon and said pray ye to
[56:37] the Lord for me that none of these
[56:38] things which ye have spoken come upon me
[56:42] and they
[56:43] when they had testified and preached the
[56:45] word of the Lord return to Jerusalem and
[56:48] preach the gospel in many villages of
[56:50] the Samaritans
[56:53] it's just amazing to see this this this
[56:56] chapter in in Acts and and we're all
[56:59] familiar with it I'm sure but the second
[57:02] part is really what I want to get to but
[57:04] it's important to underscore the first
[57:05] part we have to have our right motive
[57:08] and right objective if we're going to
[57:10] come before God to receive anything of
[57:13] him
[57:14] we can't expect to see anything of God
[57:16] if we come to him with any other thought
[57:18] in our heart any little bit of
[57:20] reservation
[57:22] but you know what gives us the ability
[57:24] today to have access to that throne
[57:28] I can't believe that I I sound this way
[57:31] now I wondered if I ever would and I'm
[57:33] I'm so here I can tell you what the only
[57:36] way that we'll ever have access to his
[57:39] throne today
[57:40] truly is through the message of the hour
[57:44] without the message of the hour we are
[57:47] false Pretenders
[57:49] if we don't receive the message that
[57:52] God's Prophet sent to the Earth in our
[57:54] generation then we have missed the mark
[57:58] we'll be just like all of the other
[58:00] people in this world in Noah's day who
[58:03] didn't get into the boat
[58:05] what happened to all of them somebody
[58:07] probably had some some some custom
[58:09] Yachts made they probably had some of
[58:12] the greatest technology some of the
[58:14] fastest strongest engines built in those
[58:16] boats
[58:17] but did they save them
[58:19] there was only one boat
[58:21] that was to save them and that was in
[58:23] God's provided plan and the same thing
[58:26] for today it's got to be according to
[58:28] God's provided plan according to the
[58:30] message of the hour that was sent
[58:32] through a Vindicated prophet
[58:35] and you know if you take a look at
[58:37] William Miriam Branham it sounds like
[58:38] I'm fighting this and and I don't know I
[58:41] just feel led to go this way just bear
[58:42] with me but if there's people that don't
[58:44] believe William Mary and Bradham could
[58:46] be a prophet of God if you can't believe
[58:48] his his words then look at his Works
[58:50] look at what happened in his ministry
[58:52] there's no man that ever lived that had
[58:54] a Ministry like his
[58:57] that went around the world seven times
[59:01] God vindicating his word and his man
[59:05] how does God vindicate his word
[59:08] he brings it to pass
[59:10] and we know there was a scripture that
[59:12] said
[59:13] that there has to be a prophet in this
[59:15] age
[59:16] there had to be a scripture fulfilled
[59:19] only half of it was read out of Isaiah
[59:22] when Jesus sat down in the temple
[59:28] but there had to be another part
[59:30] before the great and terrible day of the
[59:32] Lord
[59:35] when Philip was sent to
[59:37] Samaria
[59:39] remember they had all heard about the
[59:41] Messiah
[59:44] all of them did
[59:46] and I'm saying this specifically about
[59:47] Samaria because of the woman at the well
[59:51] he went up there for one purpose and
[59:54] that was to set one woman's heart on
[59:56] fire to set her soul on fire so that she
[1:00:00] would go and just tell everyone just
[1:00:02] noise it abroad in the city come and see
[1:00:04] a man who's told me the things that I
[1:00:06] have done he went by the way of Samaria
[1:00:08] so that he could do that they all heard
[1:00:11] about the Messiah
[1:00:13] so when they started to come around
[1:00:15] again and started to see this Behavior
[1:00:18] the sorcerer had always been a part of
[1:00:20] it
[1:00:22] they're all used to that but when they
[1:00:24] started to see the power of God Christ
[1:00:26] Jesus being preached in power and
[1:00:28] demonstration God vindicating his word
[1:00:30] through his men
[1:00:32] it caused them to pay attention to take
[1:00:35] notice
[1:00:36] but it was right then that Saul of
[1:00:38] Tarsus was persecuting the church
[1:00:41] but Philip he was sent down there
[1:00:44] he had a campaign to take on
[1:00:48] and you know I just love it because it
[1:00:50] was while he preached Christ unto them
[1:00:52] that the unclean spirits rose up the
[1:00:55] unclean spirits they cried with a loud
[1:00:57] voice they couldn't handle hearing the
[1:00:59] word of God being preached they couldn't
[1:01:01] handle seeing that light
[1:01:05] that light before them
[1:01:07] that we read in John
[1:01:10] and many devils
[1:01:12] devil possessed people were delivered
[1:01:14] just at the preaching of the word
[1:01:17] but many of them they had hands laid on
[1:01:19] them and the devil scrammed out of them
[1:01:20] but many were healed
[1:01:23] but it was here that he met Simon the
[1:01:25] Sorcerer in our our reading this morning
[1:01:27] we read that
[1:01:29] he met the sorcerer who had great power
[1:01:31] and great Authority by all the people
[1:01:33] they said that this man was the power of
[1:01:36] God
[1:01:38] didn't say that he had the power of God
[1:01:40] that he was the power of God what a
[1:01:42] position to have in the eyes of the
[1:01:44] people
[1:01:48] but he Bewitched the people
[1:01:52] you know God had to straighten this out
[1:01:55] just like he always straightens out the
[1:01:56] air
[1:01:57] he'll never let us go down the road in
[1:01:59] error if we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:02:01] God
[1:02:02] he'll never let his children just go
[1:02:04] down by the wayside and never hear the
[1:02:06] truth preached in love
[1:02:09] he'll make sure that everyone gets the
[1:02:10] opportunity to hear the word for their
[1:02:12] day
[1:02:14] and how does he do it
[1:02:16] he uses men
[1:02:18] he uses a man
[1:02:20] just like he uses a prophet and who is a
[1:02:22] prophet he's a man
[1:02:25] if you ever want to check a prophet
[1:02:26] someone who claims to be a prophet
[1:02:28] someone who would say that man's a
[1:02:29] prophet see what he talks about
[1:02:31] does he have some sort of weird little
[1:02:33] ISM that he mixes in with the word then
[1:02:36] you know just leave it alone you don't
[1:02:37] have to be afraid of it
[1:02:39] but what if he doesn't mix anything with
[1:02:41] the word what if he just presents the
[1:02:43] pure word
[1:02:44] then we're forced to make a decision to
[1:02:47] say wow did God actually send a prophet
[1:02:50] because the only thing he's saying is
[1:02:52] what his word says
[1:02:53] and that's the only thing a prophet will
[1:02:56] say he won't add to it and he won't take
[1:02:58] away from it
[1:02:59] but he'll send his men and his men will
[1:03:01] go and preach the truth
[1:03:02] and that's what happens in a message
[1:03:04] Church
[1:03:05] message Ministry they preach the truth
[1:03:07] they preach the message of the hour they
[1:03:09] preach the present truth the word for
[1:03:12] our day the only Escape that we have
[1:03:15] he always straightens out his error with
[1:03:17] men
[1:03:18] so Philip he begins to preach down there
[1:03:21] and as he's preaching Simon he starts to
[1:03:24] see that hold on a second the people are
[1:03:26] starting to maybe not be as interested
[1:03:28] in my Ministry and and they're looking
[1:03:30] at this other ministry that's coming
[1:03:31] along and and how can that be but it was
[1:03:35] and God Did It for a purpose so that the
[1:03:38] world could see the truth
[1:03:40] everyone was used to following a
[1:03:42] Vindicated man someone who bewitches
[1:03:45] people and and causes things to happen
[1:03:47] and we know that there's probably many
[1:03:49] signs and wonders in his ministry in the
[1:03:51] sorcerer's Ministry we don't ever want
[1:03:53] to doubt that for a second we know that
[1:03:55] in Egypt pharaohs magicians had the
[1:03:58] power to do stuff
[1:04:01] and even when Moses came and did his
[1:04:02] thing then our Prophet said you know as
[1:04:04] cheap magicians trick to destroy your
[1:04:06] stick down and turn it into a snake our
[1:04:07] guys can do that and he calls Janice and
[1:04:10] jambres and they throw down their sticks
[1:04:12] and they did the same thing that's the
[1:04:13] word
[1:04:14] that's not even what brother Bradham
[1:04:16] said
[1:04:17] but brother Branham did say it was a
[1:04:19] cheap magician's trick what I'm saying
[1:04:21] is there's things
[1:04:22] that men can do through the wrong Avenue
[1:04:24] and it's not men doing it it's Satan
[1:04:28] operating through the men
[1:04:30] brother Bradham did say that Satan can
[1:04:32] impersonate any gift of God and that's
[1:04:34] why we don't want to look at initial
[1:04:36] evidence of the Holy Ghost is speaking
[1:04:37] in tongues we don't want to look at any
[1:04:39] gift in fact
[1:04:41] even the raising of the Dead even even
[1:04:44] anything any gift that we can think of
[1:04:48] put those aside let's talk about the
[1:04:50] word let's see if that word Falls in
[1:04:53] line with what the prophet said let's
[1:04:54] see with what the prophet says Falls in
[1:04:56] line with that word because seek ye
[1:04:58] first the kingdom of God if we can see
[1:05:00] the word ahead of us first and make the
[1:05:03] word our priority our Paramount action
[1:05:06] everything else will follow
[1:05:09] all of the gifts will follow us we're
[1:05:11] not seeking signs and wonders
[1:05:14] isn't it amazing to think though
[1:05:16] that this whole world looks after signs
[1:05:19] and wonders to see great miracles happen
[1:05:21] it's tremendous to see great miracles
[1:05:23] happen I know I've witnessed one or two
[1:05:26] it's tremendous to see great miracles
[1:05:28] happen
[1:05:29] but it's more humbling when you step
[1:05:30] back and think I have the ability to how
[1:05:32] do I have the ability to believe how do
[1:05:35] I have the ability to believe why was
[1:05:37] that the theme song for the prophet in
[1:05:38] this age only belief not not only do not
[1:05:41] not only raised from the dead or only
[1:05:43] speak in tongues or only have any of
[1:05:45] these gifts in our lives no it was only
[1:05:47] believe because that's the most
[1:05:49] fascinating thing that's the most
[1:05:51] difficult thing there is to do today is
[1:05:53] to hold our head above the fanaticism
[1:05:55] that's risen up around the message of
[1:05:57] the hour
[1:05:58] because if Satan wants to do one thing
[1:06:00] he wants to try and pervert as much of
[1:06:03] the message of the hour as he can but
[1:06:04] you know what Satan you'll never ever
[1:06:06] pervert the message of the hour you
[1:06:08] might pervert people that try and
[1:06:09] pretend to be a part of the message of
[1:06:11] the hour but the only reason that can
[1:06:13] happen is because they just don't have
[1:06:14] the message of the hour in them they're
[1:06:16] just trying to be a part of the message
[1:06:18] of the hour just like Simon wanted to be
[1:06:20] a part of the message of the hour but
[1:06:22] God sent Philip his way A man filled
[1:06:24] with the Holy Ghost and reinforcements
[1:06:27] to come and participate in the services
[1:06:31] and to straighten them out in his
[1:06:32] Doctrine to say no you're just not ready
[1:06:34] for this this is not for you but you
[1:06:36] know what we can do we can actually pray
[1:06:38] for you and trust that the Lord will
[1:06:40] actually open your eyes and that you'll
[1:06:42] repent from the sin that is actually
[1:06:44] manifesting in your life that you might
[1:06:46] be able to receive the gift of the Holy
[1:06:48] Ghost and not be eternally separated
[1:06:50] from God
[1:06:52] but they were able to have a real good
[1:06:54] service and and to straighten them out
[1:06:56] according to the word for their day
[1:07:01] you know Simon learned that there was a
[1:07:03] more excellent way
[1:07:04] and he believed
[1:07:07] and was baptized
[1:07:08] but that doesn't mean
[1:07:10] anything
[1:07:12] we need to make sure our motive and
[1:07:13] objective is correct
[1:07:17] but I think it's interesting
[1:07:19] and and I'm not sure but in in in in the
[1:07:22] message if brother Branham talks further
[1:07:23] about him
[1:07:25] but in the end of this he says
[1:07:27] verse 24 then answered Simon and said
[1:07:30] pray ye to the Lord for me
[1:07:33] pray for me
[1:07:34] because I don't want to be in this
[1:07:36] condition I don't want to remain here
[1:07:38] did the Lord save him I don't know
[1:07:41] maybe brother Bradham
[1:07:42] elaborates on this further and I'd like
[1:07:45] to maybe have discussion about it or
[1:07:46] whatever but I'm not sure if if we hear
[1:07:49] more about Simon the Sorcerer And if if
[1:07:51] he did actually have that prayer
[1:07:53] answered
[1:07:54] you know it's important to remember that
[1:07:57] God always sends a message
[1:08:00] he always sends a message in every
[1:08:02] single age he has set Messengers
[1:08:05] seven Church ages seven candlesticks
[1:08:07] seven spirits of God
[1:08:09] all of that I don't want to get too deep
[1:08:12] today I'm just going to maybe stay a
[1:08:14] little bit on the surface and forgive me
[1:08:15] for it but I just feel led to go this
[1:08:18] way
[1:08:19] but except they be sent
[1:08:21] when someone comes on their own accord
[1:08:23] look out
[1:08:25] usually they've got an agenda
[1:08:27] usually there's something going on in
[1:08:29] their life but when God sends someone
[1:08:33] that's where we need to perk up that's
[1:08:34] where we need to pay attention that's
[1:08:36] where we need to tune in and say hold on
[1:08:38] a second I need to listen to this
[1:08:39] because does it line up with the word
[1:08:41] and you know if we never read the word
[1:08:43] how will we ever know whether it's true
[1:08:48] listen to the message of the hour how
[1:08:50] will we ever know what we hear is true
[1:08:52] or false when we hear a minister get up
[1:08:55] on on on on on mainstream television
[1:08:58] what is it God TV or or Daystar
[1:09:01] programming or whatever it is they have
[1:09:04] when a man gets up there and starts to
[1:09:06] quote the message of the hour
[1:09:09] where did that inspiration come from
[1:09:13] and I believe it with all my heart I'm
[1:09:15] sure we all do as well
[1:09:16] that if God sent a prophet then it would
[1:09:19] behoove us to say that's what the
[1:09:21] prophet said
[1:09:22] that's the message from God through the
[1:09:24] prophet of this day
[1:09:27] but many times men will like to just
[1:09:29] pick and choose and take some of this
[1:09:31] really interesting stuff and make it the
[1:09:33] latest and the greatest for them to pull
[1:09:35] out of their pocket and and and plagued
[1:09:38] your eyes I'll say if it's possible to
[1:09:40] plagiarize the word of God they do it
[1:09:42] and the reason they do it is so that
[1:09:44] they can actually
[1:09:46] get money
[1:09:48] you know brother Bradham said that men
[1:09:50] will be affected by one of three things
[1:09:53] right
[1:09:54] women popularity
[1:09:57] or money
[1:10:00] and I know it for sure that any ministry
[1:10:03] that's on TV
[1:10:05] money is a very big part of it
[1:10:08] a very very big part of it
[1:10:11] another part of it is popularity
[1:10:14] and the one that usually brings them to
[1:10:16] their knees
[1:10:18] is women
[1:10:20] it's kind of interesting how they all go
[1:10:21] together and how the prophet was saying
[1:10:23] that for like another age decades before
[1:10:27] but I remember in my age seeing at least
[1:10:29] a few
[1:10:31] great Ministries on television who are
[1:10:34] afflicted by all of those
[1:10:36] that's just a total sideline that's
[1:10:39] weird
[1:10:40] I just trust the Lord is working here
[1:10:42] you know except they be sent
[1:10:45] it's not really worth much you don't
[1:10:47] want to hear my opinion you don't want
[1:10:49] to hear some man's opinion out there you
[1:10:51] don't want to hear someone plagiarize
[1:10:52] the prophet of God and just make it
[1:10:54] their own thing
[1:10:55] you want to know that that's fresh word
[1:10:57] from God through a prophet
[1:11:00] in Romans 10 for whosoever shall call
[1:11:03] upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
[1:11:06] that scripture alone is just tremendous
[1:11:09] if there's anybody that just needs a
[1:11:11] little bit of Hope today if you just
[1:11:12] call upon the name of the Lord you'll be
[1:11:14] saved that's all we need to do that's
[1:11:16] our Avenue to get into the boat
[1:11:20] how then shall they call on him who they
[1:11:23] have not believed
[1:11:25] how shall they believe in him of whom
[1:11:27] they have not heard
[1:11:29] how shall they hear
[1:11:31] without a preacher
[1:11:34] how shall they hear
[1:11:35] without a prophet
[1:11:38] how would we hear
[1:11:41] if we look at all of the ages and how
[1:11:43] many Loose Ends how twisted it up all of
[1:11:46] the world has become
[1:11:48] throughout all the ages all the ministry
[1:11:50] all the men rising up and trying to make
[1:11:52] something of themselves Satan just
[1:11:54] weaving in and out having a field day
[1:11:57] with the religion of this world
[1:11:59] unless God sent a prophet to to to
[1:12:02] actually show us the true form of water
[1:12:05] baptism the true Avenue to get the Holy
[1:12:08] Ghost in our lives where would we be
[1:12:12] how would we understand the message of
[1:12:15] the hour if we didn't have the Holy
[1:12:16] Ghost in our lives
[1:12:17] we wouldn't
[1:12:19] we would just come to the place where we
[1:12:21] would be an associate member of the
[1:12:24] message of the hour
[1:12:26] and that Association
[1:12:28] card
[1:12:29] will burn up on that day when all the
[1:12:32] elements Melt With A ferv and Heat
[1:12:35] and that's not enough to save us the
[1:12:37] only thing that will save us is the
[1:12:38] token that blood sacrifice
[1:12:41] on the lentils
[1:12:42] on the doorposts of our home which is
[1:12:45] our heart
[1:12:47] and how shall they believe in him whom
[1:12:50] they have not heard how shall they hear
[1:12:51] without a preacher and how shall they
[1:12:53] preach except they be sent
[1:12:56] as it is written how beautiful are the
[1:12:58] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[1:13:00] peace and bring Glad Tidings of good
[1:13:02] things
[1:13:04] not judgment
[1:13:06] not a Ministry of fear unless you
[1:13:08] actually hear what brother Barry has to
[1:13:10] say you're going to burn in hell
[1:13:13] how many Ministries are out there like
[1:13:15] that unless you believe it the way that
[1:13:17] I present it to you
[1:13:19] you're not going to make it
[1:13:21] and even around the message of the hour
[1:13:23] unless you believe that Revelations 10 7
[1:13:26] has actually happened my way
[1:13:30] you're not going to make it
[1:13:32] is terrible
[1:13:34] but remember it would be so close that
[1:13:36] it would deceive the very elected not
[1:13:38] just the elected the very elected if it
[1:13:41] were possible but when we have the Holy
[1:13:43] Ghost because we've been given the true
[1:13:45] formula of water baptism to receive the
[1:13:47] true baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:50] we won't be deceived brothers and
[1:13:52] sisters we cannot be deceived because if
[1:13:54] we're deceived and that means God's
[1:13:55] deceived and if God's deceived he's not
[1:13:57] God and we're all lost
[1:14:00] it's amazing to look at it
[1:14:04] not one of us will be lost with the Holy
[1:14:06] Ghost
[1:14:08] now brother Bradham says that I know
[1:14:09] that every we can have the Holy Ghost
[1:14:11] every hour of our lives and still go to
[1:14:13] hell
[1:14:14] and we can
[1:14:16] but remember
[1:14:18] I should have brought that chart
[1:14:20] I'm going to bring that one of these
[1:14:22] days and we'll just have it
[1:14:24] um
[1:14:25] if you can just draw the circle we're
[1:14:26] all familiar with it body
[1:14:28] spirit and then Soul right in the middle
[1:14:30] the world says Body Soul Spirit brother
[1:14:33] Branham says Body Soul spirit
[1:14:36] but if you take a look at it it's
[1:14:38] actually Body Spirit and soul
[1:14:42] the soul is on the inside of the inside
[1:14:44] right
[1:14:46] you can have the Holy Ghost anointing on
[1:14:48] your body
[1:14:49] the outside Circle
[1:14:51] you can have the Holy Ghost anointing on
[1:14:53] the inside Circle
[1:14:55] of your spirit
[1:14:57] you can have great signs and wonders in
[1:14:59] your life
[1:15:01] every hour of your life
[1:15:04] but if you don't have the Holy Ghost on
[1:15:07] the inside Circle the inside of the
[1:15:09] inside that tiny little place that
[1:15:10] brother Branham talked about in the
[1:15:11] heart of a human being the Throne of God
[1:15:14] The Mercy Seat
[1:15:16] the temple of God not made by hands if
[1:15:19] we don't have the Holy Ghost right there
[1:15:21] in that place where it's supposed to be
[1:15:24] then we can go to hell
[1:15:26] that's why brothers and sisters it's so
[1:15:28] important for us to make sure that we
[1:15:29] understand that we need to be baptized
[1:15:31] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:15:32] the remission of our sins out of true
[1:15:35] repentance repent first
[1:15:38] and then be baptized
[1:15:40] so that we can receive the gift of the
[1:15:41] Holy Ghost we don't want to receive the
[1:15:43] gift of the Holy Ghost sometimes I think
[1:15:44] it can be that we want to receive the
[1:15:45] gift of the Holy Ghost so we could act
[1:15:47] like Simon the Sorcerer And I've got
[1:15:48] power I've got a great ministry look at
[1:15:51] all the things that happens around me
[1:15:52] all the prayers get answered when I pray
[1:15:54] no way if that's what we're looking for
[1:15:57] we're mistaken
[1:15:58] we want the Holy Ghost so we go to
[1:16:00] heaven we want the Holy Ghost so we take
[1:16:02] our Heavenly flight we go on the rapture
[1:16:04] we want the Holy Ghost so that when we
[1:16:05] go into the graveyard that that will get
[1:16:07] us out
[1:16:08] otherwise we're going to remain there
[1:16:11] we want that Blessed Assurance we're not
[1:16:14] interested in having Earthly Goods this
[1:16:15] isn't about having a great business I'm
[1:16:18] not interested in seeing great
[1:16:20] manifestations it's not about that all
[1:16:22] of that stuff follows it does follow
[1:16:25] but if we put him first if we do have
[1:16:27] the right motive and objective then we
[1:16:29] won't come before the throne scared
[1:16:32] will have the ability to come boldly
[1:16:34] Before the Throne because we know we
[1:16:36] have a pure heart
[1:16:37] and you know what saves us is the fact
[1:16:39] that we believe
[1:16:41] the fact that we're willing to just
[1:16:43] believe that's what saves us it's not
[1:16:45] nothing we can do no way
[1:16:48] let's go on and read a little more in uh
[1:16:51] in Acts chapter 8.
[1:16:53] start with verse 25. so we've had the
[1:16:57] the great campaign in Samaria where they
[1:16:59] all knew about Messiah and and Philip
[1:17:02] was there and and then the great other
[1:17:04] ministers came Peter and John came to
[1:17:07] them and and they had this tremendous uh
[1:17:10] healing campaign down there and and
[1:17:12] filling of the Holy Ghost just a a real
[1:17:14] mighty move of the Lord
[1:17:17] but then it changes a little bit right
[1:17:19] in the midst of all of this I just love
[1:17:21] this part in verse 25 and they
[1:17:24] when they had testified and preached the
[1:17:27] word of the Lord returned to Jerusalem
[1:17:28] and preach the gospel in many villages
[1:17:31] of the Samaritans
[1:17:34] and the angel of the Lord spake unto
[1:17:36] Philip saying arise and go toward the
[1:17:38] South unto the way that goeth down from
[1:17:41] Jerusalem unto Gaza which is Desert
[1:17:45] and he arose and went and behold a man
[1:17:47] of Ethiopia eunuch of great Authority
[1:17:50] Under Candace queen of Ethiopians who
[1:17:52] had the charge of all her treasure and
[1:17:55] had come to Jerusalem for to worship
[1:17:58] was returning and sitting in his Chariot
[1:18:00] reading azaias the prophet
[1:18:03] then the spirit said unto Philip go near
[1:18:06] and join thyself to this chariot
[1:18:09] and Philip ran hither to him
[1:18:11] and heard him read the prophet isaiahs
[1:18:15] and said unto said understand us thou
[1:18:19] what thou readest and he said how can I
[1:18:22] accept some man should guide me
[1:18:25] and he desired Philip that he would come
[1:18:27] up and sit with him
[1:18:30] and the place of the scripture which he
[1:18:31] read was this he was led as a sheep to
[1:18:34] the slaughter and like a lamb dumb
[1:18:36] before his sheer so he opened not his
[1:18:39] mouth
[1:18:40] in his humiliation his judgment was
[1:18:43] taken away
[1:18:45] and Whom Shall declare his generation
[1:18:49] for his life is taken from the Earth
[1:18:52] and the eunuch answered Philip and said
[1:18:55] I pray thee I just love this I pray thee
[1:18:58] of whom speaketh the Prophet this
[1:19:03] of himself or some other man
[1:19:06] then Philip opened his mouth and began
[1:19:08] at the same scripture and preached unto
[1:19:10] him Jesus
[1:19:12] and as they went on their way they came
[1:19:15] unto a certain water
[1:19:16] and the eunuch said see here is water
[1:19:19] what doth hinder me to be baptized so I
[1:19:22] just want to stop there if you could
[1:19:23] imagine going back to the prophet Isaias
[1:19:27] how much scripture did Philip
[1:19:30] expound to him on all the way up to
[1:19:33] water baptism
[1:19:35] because the eunuch never had any idea
[1:19:37] about water baptism here
[1:19:39] but he's he must have preached up a
[1:19:41] storm he must have covered a lot of
[1:19:43] ground in a fairly short period of time
[1:19:47] but he had the desire to get baptized
[1:19:49] this man is is sort of the different
[1:19:52] example that I wanted to get to this man
[1:19:54] had the desire for the right reasons
[1:19:56] according to the scripture he saw there
[1:19:58] was a promise for him and he knew that
[1:20:00] he could receive it it became real to
[1:20:02] him it was a revelation
[1:20:05] we'll just carry on here
[1:20:09] and they went on their way verse 36 and
[1:20:12] came unto a certain water and the eunuch
[1:20:14] said see here is water
[1:20:16] what does hinder mean to be baptized
[1:20:17] note that it was the eunuch that said
[1:20:19] that
[1:20:20] it wasn't Philip
[1:20:22] the eunuch he desired to be baptized and
[1:20:25] Philip said if thou believest with all
[1:20:28] thine heart thou mayest and he answered
[1:20:31] and said I believe that Jesus Christ is
[1:20:34] the son of God
[1:20:36] and he that commanded the Chariot and he
[1:20:39] commanded the Chariot to stand still and
[1:20:42] they went down both into the water
[1:20:45] both Philip and the eunuch and he
[1:20:48] baptized him
[1:20:51] and when they when they were come up out
[1:20:54] of the water the spirit of the lord
[1:20:56] caught away Philip that the eunuch saw
[1:20:59] him no more
[1:21:00] and he went on his way rejoicing
[1:21:03] but Philip was found at
[1:21:05] azotus and passing through he preached
[1:21:09] in all the cities till he came to
[1:21:11] caesarea I feel like there's a whole
[1:21:13] entire sermon right here just in these
[1:21:16] last two verses
[1:21:18] to think about it though
[1:21:20] the eunuch
[1:21:22] he had the desire to be baptized for the
[1:21:25] right reason
[1:21:26] he wasn't looking for gain
[1:21:28] he wasn't looking for a Ministry
[1:21:31] he had a revelation in his heart that
[1:21:33] there was a scripture in this this
[1:21:35] scripture it meant something something
[1:21:37] was speaking to him out of this
[1:21:39] scripture and and what was it and how
[1:21:42] would he know unless God sent him a
[1:21:44] preacher
[1:21:47] but here we have God the angel of the
[1:21:50] Lord comes down and says you know what
[1:21:52] in the midst of all of your all of your
[1:21:54] Humanity having this great healing
[1:21:55] campaign and the spirit of God moving
[1:21:57] and and and the tremendous sermons that
[1:21:59] are being preached I want you to leave
[1:22:02] I want you to just leave I want you to
[1:22:05] follow my instructions and I want you to
[1:22:07] go all the way out into the desert for
[1:22:08] one person can you imagine that today
[1:22:10] brother Bradham brings it out real good
[1:22:11] in the message and he talks about in a
[1:22:13] few different places about what it meant
[1:22:15] to actually just leave the great
[1:22:17] campaign they've paid for all the
[1:22:19] building they've paid for all of the
[1:22:21] stuff to go and and be there for for
[1:22:23] Philip to be there maybe as the headline
[1:22:25] preacher they've they've invested a lot
[1:22:27] of time and money and here now this man
[1:22:29] of God says I I've got to go
[1:22:32] I'm being told to leave you have to just
[1:22:34] carry on without me
[1:22:36] but you know if if the other people
[1:22:37] there had the Holy Ghost which they did
[1:22:40] they don't need Philip
[1:22:42] I said Peter sorry
[1:22:44] they didn't need Philip to stay there
[1:22:46] Philip could simply go and and he did he
[1:22:49] was sent by the Lord and he followed the
[1:22:51] instruction of the Lord for one man
[1:22:54] just one man he wasn't even a Jew
[1:22:58] he was a gentile
[1:23:00] but he went for just one man
[1:23:03] imagine that
[1:23:05] and when they were come up out of the
[1:23:07] water he baptized them right and when he
[1:23:09] came up out of the water what happened
[1:23:11] but the Branham talks about it and uh it
[1:23:13] is the rising of the Sun that quickening
[1:23:15] power struck him in such a way that it
[1:23:18] whisked him 150 miles away brother
[1:23:20] Branham says
[1:23:21] just took them completely teleported him
[1:23:24] translated him to a different place
[1:23:25] geographically in time from one place to
[1:23:29] the other place and what did he do he
[1:23:30] had so much of that quickening power he
[1:23:32] just kept right on preaching his way
[1:23:34] through he didn't stop
[1:23:36] what did the eunuch do
[1:23:38] it doesn't say that the eunuch got the
[1:23:40] Holy Ghost does it
[1:23:42] just says that that quickening power
[1:23:44] took Philip out of the way
[1:23:46] took him to another place but brothers
[1:23:48] and sisters you can imagine someone with
[1:23:50] the right motive and objective
[1:23:52] having the right motive and objective
[1:23:54] what happened because he had the right
[1:23:55] motive and objective
[1:23:57] God heard His Thoughts
[1:24:00] God heard one of his Gentiles Sons
[1:24:02] saying I long to see this this this
[1:24:05] passage I long to understand what this
[1:24:07] means because there's something real
[1:24:09] significant here and because he had that
[1:24:11] desire in his heart which God put there
[1:24:13] from before the foundation of the world
[1:24:14] because he had this desire in his heart
[1:24:16] God sent him the preacher
[1:24:19] God delivered to him the need that he
[1:24:22] had in his heart and brothers and
[1:24:24] sisters it's no accident when we have
[1:24:26] the ability to see God speak to us we
[1:24:29] have the ability to get baptized in the
[1:24:31] name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's no
[1:24:32] accident it is the power of almighty God
[1:24:35] speaking to us saying you know what it's
[1:24:37] time for you to come up hither we talked
[1:24:38] about that that doorway open in heaven
[1:24:40] in Revelations chapter 4 John had been
[1:24:43] given all of the instruction about the
[1:24:45] laodicean church age and all the
[1:24:47] different Church Ages Every Church age
[1:24:49] there was he was given all that
[1:24:51] information and and told to just take
[1:24:53] note and write it because it's got to be
[1:24:55] delivered into the future
[1:24:57] but then after all these things he
[1:24:59] looked and behold the door opened in
[1:25:01] heaven and that same voice spoke to him
[1:25:03] saying come up a little higher every
[1:25:05] single one of us when we get the desire
[1:25:07] when we get that Revelation in our
[1:25:08] hearts that we need to be baptized in
[1:25:10] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's
[1:25:13] an invitation to come up a little higher
[1:25:15] and it's not us going into heaven in a
[1:25:17] Rapture although that's the end result
[1:25:19] of it one way or the other
[1:25:22] it's an opportunity to realize the word
[1:25:24] of God for ourselves
[1:25:26] just like God sent to that eunuch
[1:25:29] a minister
[1:25:31] because he had that desire in his heart
[1:25:33] he wanted to learn more
[1:25:35] he knew there was more there but how
[1:25:38] could he understand it
[1:25:40] but here he is just doing his thing
[1:25:42] going his way not knowing even where to
[1:25:44] go or who to talk to but just being
[1:25:46] himself
[1:25:48] and suddenly a man just runs up to him
[1:25:51] could you imagine that being that way in
[1:25:52] your car in traffic and suddenly some
[1:25:55] man just runs up to you
[1:25:57] and says what you doing what's your
[1:25:58] reading
[1:26:00] I can hear that you're saying something
[1:26:02] that's familiar to me and I've got
[1:26:04] something that I want to tell you
[1:26:06] would you open your door and say jump in
[1:26:09] just jump in the car I got some stuff
[1:26:11] we can go for a ride and you can explain
[1:26:13] it to me and as we go we'll Fellowship
[1:26:15] around the word
[1:26:17] it's pretty amazing to see because
[1:26:18] that's what happened in his day and it
[1:26:20] could easily have been a bad guy
[1:26:23] could easily have been a robber
[1:26:26] but something spoke to him and said
[1:26:28] that's your answer
[1:26:30] just choosy this day whom you'll serve
[1:26:33] and see if the Lord won't actually
[1:26:35] reveal it to you
[1:26:37] Philip he was sent to Samaria
[1:26:41] it's just amazing to think that that
[1:26:43] angel sent him
[1:26:45] and brothers and sisters just to fast
[1:26:47] forward it today to our lives
[1:26:50] there was an angel that was sent to us
[1:26:54] to Bear witness of that light
[1:26:56] to Bear witness of that life that was
[1:26:59] from the beginning
[1:27:01] in God
[1:27:03] that was God
[1:27:04] there was something sent to us out of
[1:27:06] the Easter seal in 1965. Brother Brad
[1:27:09] I'm talking about this story notice
[1:27:11] quickly now look at Philip down there
[1:27:13] and a great Revival having a Revival
[1:27:16] where it had been darest for any man why
[1:27:19] if he'd had got a big cooperation
[1:27:22] amongst the churches and everything down
[1:27:24] there was having a great Revival and the
[1:27:26] quickening power of God spoke to him and
[1:27:28] said Stephen this is Brother Brandon's
[1:27:30] words I'm just reading it verbatim he
[1:27:32] may messed up the word too he said
[1:27:34] Stephen maybe it said this you're having
[1:27:37] a great Revival but I've got one man I
[1:27:40] want you to talk to and Stephen's
[1:27:42] obedient no matter what it is how much
[1:27:45] criticism oh Stephen you can't leave
[1:27:48] people would say the prophet never made
[1:27:51] a mistake
[1:27:52] right
[1:27:54] Stephen was dead
[1:27:56] Stephen was stoned the beginning of this
[1:27:59] chapter they explained they had a great
[1:28:00] lamentation and they buried him
[1:28:03] some people would say that the prophet
[1:28:04] never made a mistake he was a man
[1:28:07] but when he said thus saith the Lord
[1:28:09] look out
[1:28:11] and Stephen's obedient no matter what it
[1:28:13] is how much criticism oh Stephen you
[1:28:15] can't leave but I can God said so and he
[1:28:19] went out into the desert and out there
[1:28:22] he found this eunuch and what happened
[1:28:25] he said has uh if if thou believest with
[1:28:29] all thine heart that Jesus is the son of
[1:28:31] God I'll baptize you
[1:28:32] and when he baptized him look he was
[1:28:35] quickened by this quickening power to
[1:28:37] leave a Revival of thousands of people
[1:28:39] to go out into the desert to one man
[1:28:42] oh that'd be against all reasons see why
[1:28:45] there's ten thousand waiting here
[1:28:47] but there's one waiting out there see
[1:28:51] and the quickening power sent him to
[1:28:53] God's provided place
[1:28:55] Hallelujah
[1:28:57] just brings to mind the story of the
[1:28:59] pool of Bethesda
[1:29:02] where they had the the churning of the
[1:29:04] waters
[1:29:05] and the man that sat there for how long
[1:29:08] was it 38 years
[1:29:10] he sat there and every time the water
[1:29:13] stirred the angel of the lord it's a
[1:29:15] thing the angel of the Lord would stir
[1:29:17] the waters once a year and every time
[1:29:19] the water stirred if you could get into
[1:29:21] the waters first you'd be healed because
[1:29:23] you got in there just in time
[1:29:26] and this man sitting there
[1:29:28] one day Jesus
[1:29:31] God
[1:29:32] Elohim
[1:29:34] that light that life
[1:29:37] eternal life took a stroll through all
[1:29:40] the people in the pool of Bethesda but
[1:29:43] he only stopped at one person
[1:29:45] brothers and sisters that has become so
[1:29:48] clear and so real to me think about it
[1:29:50] if you can look at this world and see
[1:29:52] the millions and billions of people
[1:29:54] seven point what is it eight billion
[1:29:56] people today on Earth
[1:29:59] God if you have the ability to hear his
[1:30:02] voice God who is rich in Mercy
[1:30:05] coming around walking through all the
[1:30:07] billions of people and all of them don't
[1:30:09] matter even though they do but what he's
[1:30:11] looking for is the precious fruit of the
[1:30:13] earth that one or two predestinated
[1:30:16] seeds from before the foundation of the
[1:30:18] world those are the ones that he's after
[1:30:20] those are the ones he's wanting to speak
[1:30:22] to those are the ones who are example of
[1:30:25] the eunuch where he will send a minister
[1:30:27] to bring the true word to bring the true
[1:30:29] life this morning if you're hearing this
[1:30:31] message being spoken I would strongly
[1:30:34] consider it if you haven't heard it
[1:30:36] before God maybe is calling you from
[1:30:39] before the foundation of the world to
[1:30:41] take a look at what his Prophet had to
[1:30:43] say to this age
[1:30:45] I don't want to preaching to the choir
[1:30:47] but I believe there's people tuned in
[1:30:49] that maybe just don't have the same
[1:30:51] level of revelation they might not just
[1:30:53] have the understanding
[1:30:58] we need to make sure
[1:31:00] that we're willing to just
[1:31:02] step back
[1:31:03] and just forget about all of our
[1:31:05] reasoning and all of our tradition and
[1:31:06] all of our teaching and everything that
[1:31:08] we think that we know and just say wait
[1:31:09] a second if God
[1:31:11] truly
[1:31:12] I think I could say this to anybody in
[1:31:15] the whole entire world for the most part
[1:31:16] there's some people that just don't
[1:31:17] believe in God and that's that you would
[1:31:19] never say it to them but for the most
[1:31:21] part most people in this world believe
[1:31:24] that there is some form of a God and if
[1:31:26] there is some form of a God and he had
[1:31:28] some form of a message that he wanted to
[1:31:30] get through to human beings wouldn't you
[1:31:32] want to hear it there's people that have
[1:31:33] more of a desire to hear from a stupid
[1:31:36] alien some sort of different kind of
[1:31:39] Life out there than they are willing to
[1:31:41] hear from the God who created this
[1:31:43] entire universe
[1:31:44] then they're saying only believe just
[1:31:47] believe that there's aliens that there's
[1:31:48] another life for what purpose
[1:31:52] but we've been given the keys to the
[1:31:53] kingdom we've been given eternal life
[1:31:57] because he chose us in him before the
[1:31:59] foundation of the world
[1:32:02] in John chapter 20 verse 21 then said
[1:32:04] Jesus to them peace be unto you
[1:32:07] as my father hath sent me
[1:32:10] even so send I you
[1:32:14] and it's no different for us brothers
[1:32:15] and sisters because we know that it was
[1:32:18] there
[1:32:19] that he said to them receive Thee the
[1:32:21] Holy Ghost
[1:32:23] and they had to go to Jerusalem they had
[1:32:25] to go through the motions
[1:32:27] they had to get baptized in the name of
[1:32:29] the Lord Jesus Christ brother Bradham
[1:32:31] even says that his mother
[1:32:33] Mary
[1:32:34] she was one of the 120 in the upper room
[1:32:36] they all had to come exactly the same
[1:32:38] way there's no exemptions every one of
[1:32:41] us has to die out to ourselves
[1:32:44] and and and come according to the word
[1:32:46] for our day but when we do that we're
[1:32:48] given the ability to receive the Holy
[1:32:50] Ghost and many times I think it can be
[1:32:52] so easy to just just make it a common
[1:32:54] thing and and to say the Holy Ghost it's
[1:32:57] like a buzzword brothers and sisters the
[1:32:59] prophet for our day said very very few
[1:33:01] will go on to the true baptism of the
[1:33:04] Holy Ghost in our day very few people
[1:33:07] if you look at one in a million what
[1:33:10] brother Branham preached one in a
[1:33:11] million two million people come out of
[1:33:14] Egypt how many people went into the
[1:33:16] promised land which is a type of the
[1:33:18] Holy Ghost
[1:33:21] so if there's seven
[1:33:23] billion people
[1:33:25] I don't know what that percentage is
[1:33:28] I don't even want to try and pretend it
[1:33:29] because I'm probably not that smart on
[1:33:31] the Fly
[1:33:32] but brothers and sisters it's not very
[1:33:34] many people
[1:33:35] because if you look at it how many
[1:33:37] people out of those seven point whatever
[1:33:39] billion people believe the message of
[1:33:41] the hour
[1:33:43] how many people in that group of people
[1:33:48] would be one out of a million
[1:33:51] because that's what it is it's the
[1:33:54] smallest
[1:33:55] minute amount of people brother Bradham
[1:33:58] says it he says people will say oh but
[1:34:00] isn't there isn't there millions of
[1:34:02] people over there and he says yeah out
[1:34:04] of every single age
[1:34:06] not just from one age
[1:34:08] there's people in this world that are
[1:34:09] looking for the great cataclysm to
[1:34:12] happen where this this this this this
[1:34:13] great climax happens and Planes Trains
[1:34:16] and Automobiles crash and volcanoes
[1:34:18] erupt and and and whatever else happens
[1:34:20] and and everybody looks around and says
[1:34:22] oh it's the Rapture of the church that's
[1:34:24] not what William Branham preached that's
[1:34:26] not what the prophet for our day said he
[1:34:27] said it's going to be the secret sudden
[1:34:29] going away of the Bride it's going to be
[1:34:32] as a thief in the night according to the
[1:34:34] scripture
[1:34:36] he said there will be 500 people that'll
[1:34:38] go missing
[1:34:39] and the twinkling of an eye
[1:34:42] and the world won't even know
[1:34:45] won't even miss a Beat
[1:34:48] we need to make sure that we have the
[1:34:49] Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:34:51] for the right reasons
[1:34:53] and that reason is so that we can go
[1:34:54] back to God because we come from God not
[1:34:59] because we're looking for a campaign not
[1:35:00] because we're looking for an increase in
[1:35:02] our pay not because we're looking for a
[1:35:04] better house not because we're looking
[1:35:06] for Better Health not because all of the
[1:35:08] all the things in this world we just
[1:35:10] want to partake of it no none of it the
[1:35:13] only reason is so that we can have
[1:35:15] eternal life truly
[1:35:17] have eternal life
[1:35:20] getting into this cricketing power
[1:35:21] notice how once the Holy Ghost came
[1:35:24] on that eunuch
[1:35:27] that Philip was translated
[1:35:29] when he was baptized
[1:35:32] Philip already had that power
[1:35:35] but once he had completed his Commission
[1:35:38] he was translated
[1:35:40] remember the prophet said that once the
[1:35:42] bride gets that Revelation once the
[1:35:44] church recognizes what it is
[1:35:47] then the Rapture will go
[1:35:49] once we're willing to be sent and not
[1:35:52] not have reservation not be held back
[1:35:54] when we're willing to actually just
[1:35:56] preach the gospel in love we're willing
[1:35:58] to just reach out to those people around
[1:36:00] us and say have you have you got any
[1:36:02] hope for your Eternal hereafter
[1:36:04] do you do you understand what's going to
[1:36:06] happen and if people say something to
[1:36:08] you then hey you know what the only
[1:36:10] thing you can do is present the truth
[1:36:11] the only thing we can do is present the
[1:36:13] life that light that Supernatural light
[1:36:16] where there's just a tiny teeny little
[1:36:18] sliver of it in this age and you and I
[1:36:21] brothers and sisters are that light we
[1:36:23] are the living witness representation of
[1:36:26] that light of that life
[1:36:29] but that quickening power it just
[1:36:31] translated his body just changed his
[1:36:33] body in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:36:34] eye and it's awesome because what did
[1:36:36] the eunuch do the eunuch didn't get
[1:36:38] excited and wonder where he was he just
[1:36:40] went on Happily is what the word says
[1:36:42] and that's what we need to do brothers
[1:36:44] and sisters just go on Happily
[1:36:48] you know one day
[1:36:50] Peter he was sent to Cornelius
[1:36:54] in Acts chapter 10.
[1:36:56] verse 44 and Peter
[1:36:59] yet spake these words
[1:37:02] and the Holy Ghost fell on all of them
[1:37:04] which heard it
[1:37:06] that's what I'm talking about brothers
[1:37:08] and sisters
[1:37:09] the preaching of the word
[1:37:12] the speaking of the word
[1:37:14] while ye yet speak these words the Holy
[1:37:18] Ghost just falls upon people
[1:37:21] and they of the circumcision the Jews
[1:37:24] which believed they were astonished
[1:37:27] as many as came with Peter because that
[1:37:30] on the Gentiles also was poured out the
[1:37:33] gift of the Holy Ghost can you believe
[1:37:35] it
[1:37:37] we better believe it
[1:37:40] that's the only thing we can do is just
[1:37:42] believe it
[1:37:43] only believe
[1:37:45] all things are possible
[1:37:48] verse 46 for they heard them speak with
[1:37:50] tongues and magnify God then answered
[1:37:52] Peter can a man forbid water that these
[1:37:55] should not be baptized which have
[1:37:57] received the Holy Ghost as well as we
[1:38:00] and remember they hadn't been baptized
[1:38:02] yet
[1:38:03] but the word just said at the speaking
[1:38:06] of his words
[1:38:08] they received the Holy Ghost
[1:38:11] and he commanded them to be baptized in
[1:38:13] the name of the Lord
[1:38:15] then prayed they him
[1:38:17] to just tarry a few certain days
[1:38:21] God is sovereign and he will operate
[1:38:23] exactly how he'll operate but we will
[1:38:26] when we receive the word we will operate
[1:38:29] exactly the way God says in his word
[1:38:32] and his word says to be baptized in the
[1:38:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:38:37] remission of sins and if you do you
[1:38:40] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:42] when you don't know it could be before
[1:38:45] it could be during it could be after
[1:38:49] but if we come according to the right
[1:38:51] formula it's going to happen
[1:38:53] all we have to do is believe all we have
[1:38:55] to do is do our part all we have to do
[1:38:57] is realize there is a message sent for
[1:38:59] us in our day and if we're willing to
[1:39:01] just follow that message and just see
[1:39:03] what happens God will bless us
[1:39:07] you know in what is the attraction on
[1:39:09] the mount now I'm going to change gears
[1:39:10] with it again we'll get into some some
[1:39:13] some Revelation here what is the strange
[1:39:16] thing that happened in 1963 we've talked
[1:39:18] about it so many times but it's just
[1:39:20] becoming more and more and more profound
[1:39:23] to me and I'm probably just going to
[1:39:25] harp on it more and more and more
[1:39:27] what is this strange thing brother
[1:39:29] Bradham says that happened on the mount
[1:39:32] in 1963 this is out of what is the
[1:39:35] attraction on the mount strongly
[1:39:37] recommend listening to it really he just
[1:39:40] takes the time to say there's so many
[1:39:42] strange things that happened in in the
[1:39:45] scriptures
[1:39:46] what is the attraction what is the
[1:39:48] attraction what is the attraction so
[1:39:50] many times so many different ways but
[1:39:52] just to narrow it right down for time's
[1:39:54] sake what's the attraction with William
[1:39:56] Miriam Branham what happened in 1963 he
[1:39:59] says what is the attraction on the mount
[1:40:01] what's this strange thing upon sunset
[1:40:04] Mountain in the Coronado Forest
[1:40:07] what is that attraction on the mountain
[1:40:12] he says in the other day standing there
[1:40:15] turn the picture to the right
[1:40:18] we posted that picture a little while
[1:40:20] ago
[1:40:21] turn it right and it shows his face
[1:40:23] that's the one that was printed in the
[1:40:25] in the brown tone I'm not sure what you
[1:40:27] call that in terms of pictures but uh
[1:40:30] the picture of of the cloud in the sky
[1:40:32] and many people will see it as a cloud
[1:40:34] in the sky but remember God said to the
[1:40:37] prophet turn it right
[1:40:39] and when he did that he was able to see
[1:40:42] the the the features of a face in the
[1:40:45] cloud and and the white wig showing
[1:40:47] exactly that it was deity it wasn't
[1:40:50] Jesus
[1:40:52] though it was Jesus it was God almighty
[1:40:56] he says that the other day standing
[1:40:57] there turn the picture to the right and
[1:40:59] there's Jesus as he was in the seven
[1:41:01] Church ages
[1:41:02] the White Wagon in in Revelations
[1:41:05] chapter one if you if you read that the
[1:41:07] one that was there was that was covered
[1:41:09] in the in the golden girdle
[1:41:11] and uh he was in the in the Gown walking
[1:41:14] in the midst of the churches and the
[1:41:16] candlesticks
[1:41:18] the White Wagon showing Supreme deity
[1:41:20] he's Alpha and Omega he's the first and
[1:41:22] the last he is the Supreme judge of all
[1:41:25] eternity standing there
[1:41:28] confirms the message of the hour of this
[1:41:31] hour he says
[1:41:32] and there shall be light about the
[1:41:34] evening time
[1:41:36] what is it all about what is it
[1:41:40] what is the attraction on the mount what
[1:41:42] happened in 1963 over sunset Mountain
[1:41:46] what really happened there brothers and
[1:41:48] sisters I honestly think this we might
[1:41:51] have a little bit of a different
[1:41:52] perception about who we are and where we
[1:41:55] are in terms of the sands of time in
[1:41:58] terms of the scripture in terms of the
[1:41:59] message of the hour if we could really
[1:42:01] grasp
[1:42:03] the second coming of the Lord
[1:42:06] because I think many people are still
[1:42:08] looking for the 60-foot Jesus
[1:42:11] many people are still looking for the
[1:42:13] banisters of Heaven to unwind and to see
[1:42:15] Jesus come down the great staircase with
[1:42:18] all the Angels maybe like Jacob's Ladder
[1:42:21] many people are looking for something
[1:42:23] different than what's actually happened
[1:42:25] take a look at the message of the hour
[1:42:27] through its entirety and see what
[1:42:29] brother Branham says about it if you're
[1:42:31] looking for a pumpkin
[1:42:34] you need to know what a pumpkin looks
[1:42:36] like
[1:42:37] oh you'll miss it when you see it
[1:42:39] and he's not talking about looking at
[1:42:41] vegetables and fruits
[1:42:43] he's talking about missing the coming of
[1:42:46] the Lord missing the presence of the
[1:42:48] Lord Jesus Christ and many people will
[1:42:51] take it and say oh the message of the
[1:42:52] hour now what you're doing is you're
[1:42:54] trying to make William Branham God no no
[1:42:57] no he was a man sent from god let's go
[1:42:59] back to John and just read this now and
[1:43:01] talk about William Miriam Branham just
[1:43:03] for a second
[1:43:05] now I feel like we're going to start
[1:43:06] preaching
[1:43:10] we'll just read this quickly John
[1:43:12] chapter one in the beginning was the
[1:43:14] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:43:16] Word was God and the same was in the
[1:43:19] beginning with God and all things were
[1:43:20] made by him and without him was not
[1:43:22] anything made that was made
[1:43:24] in him was life and the life was the
[1:43:27] light of men and the light shineth in
[1:43:29] darkness and darkness comprehended it
[1:43:32] not
[1:43:34] there was a man sent from God whose name
[1:43:36] was John so let's just say there was a
[1:43:39] man sent from God whose name was Bill
[1:43:43] the same came for a witness to Bear
[1:43:45] witness of the light
[1:43:48] that all men through him might believe
[1:43:50] remember only believe
[1:43:54] he was not that light but many people
[1:43:57] try and make him that light
[1:43:59] many people will say because you talk
[1:44:01] about him so much you make him that
[1:44:03] light no he spoke about a light and
[1:44:05] pointed to a light he was not that light
[1:44:08] but was sent to Bear witness of that
[1:44:10] light
[1:44:12] that was the True Light which lighteth
[1:44:14] every man that cometh into the world to
[1:44:17] try and bring truth about life
[1:44:20] eternal life and an eternal separation
[1:44:22] from God there's no Eternal death
[1:44:23] there's only one form of life and that's
[1:44:26] Zoe God's own life and that's what he's
[1:44:28] talking about here in this in this
[1:44:30] scripture
[1:44:34] brother Branham says that he's a supreme
[1:44:35] judge of all eternity standing there
[1:44:38] confirmed the message of this hour
[1:44:42] and there shall be light about the
[1:44:44] evening time what is it all about what
[1:44:46] is it I'm going to go on and read some
[1:44:48] more out of what is the attraction
[1:44:50] hopefully we'll have enough time to fit
[1:44:52] it in here
[1:44:53] he says I went up into the canyon
[1:44:55] climbed Plum up where the Eagles was
[1:44:57] flying around
[1:44:58] I was watching some deer standing there
[1:45:02] we've read this so many times brothers
[1:45:04] and sisters but I just trust that one of
[1:45:06] these times it will just break to us in
[1:45:08] such a way that it will never be the
[1:45:10] same to us ever again I I just can't
[1:45:13] express it enough I knelt down to pray
[1:45:16] and raise my hands and a sword struck my
[1:45:19] hand
[1:45:20] I looked around and thought what's that
[1:45:23] I'm not beside myself
[1:45:26] here's that sword in my hand bright
[1:45:29] shiny glistening in the sun I said now
[1:45:31] there's not people in miles of me way up
[1:45:34] here in this Canyon
[1:45:35] where could that come from isn't it
[1:45:38] amazing that brother Branham would be
[1:45:40] sent by God to actually not just bring a
[1:45:43] message to the world but to actually
[1:45:44] just go up to where there's no people
[1:45:47] well there's nobody around where he
[1:45:49] would have to work real hard he says
[1:45:50] that he had to get so hot climbing up
[1:45:53] there he had to take his shirt off
[1:45:55] in another message but in this one he
[1:45:57] says I said no there's not people in
[1:46:00] miles of me way up here in this Canyon
[1:46:01] where could that come from
[1:46:03] I Heard a Voice said that's the king's
[1:46:06] sword
[1:46:07] I said a Knights a king Knights a man
[1:46:10] with a sword he The Voice came back said
[1:46:14] not the king's sword
[1:46:17] not a king sword story
[1:46:19] but the king's sword
[1:46:23] I've said it many times that way
[1:46:25] not just a king sword but the king's
[1:46:28] sword
[1:46:29] but listen to what he says after this in
[1:46:31] this message
[1:46:33] not a king's sword but the king's sword
[1:46:36] the word of the Lord
[1:46:40] why would he put a sword in his hand why
[1:46:43] would he say this to him
[1:46:46] here's the king's sword and and it's in
[1:46:49] your hand
[1:46:50] why would he call him up there to have
[1:46:51] this Vision why would he be talking
[1:46:53] about this what is the attraction on the
[1:46:55] mount
[1:46:57] he said fear not it's only the third
[1:47:00] pull
[1:47:01] it's the Vindication of your ministry
[1:47:05] putting the word in your hand
[1:47:07] and really what this is that he's
[1:47:09] talking about is that all that Adam lost
[1:47:11] has been restored I put it back in the
[1:47:13] hand of man again
[1:47:16] gave it back to him
[1:47:18] remember pick up your pen and write
[1:47:21] I can't get away from it I'll probably
[1:47:23] just keep harping on it until it just
[1:47:25] becomes real to us trusting praying that
[1:47:28] the Lord will reveal it to us in such a
[1:47:29] way that it changes Our Lives
[1:47:32] she has thus saith the Lord
[1:47:35] because she has the mind of Christ to
[1:47:37] know what to do with it
[1:47:39] all that Adam lost has been restored
[1:47:42] that sword was put back into the hand of
[1:47:45] the man the word
[1:47:47] and where does the word come to brothers
[1:47:49] and sisters
[1:47:51] to the prophet
[1:47:54] it comes to the prophet why does it come
[1:47:55] to the prophet
[1:47:57] he said it can be given to the people
[1:48:00] so it wasn't just so that he could take
[1:48:02] it it wasn't just so that we could say
[1:48:04] you know what the word was given to the
[1:48:05] prophet and that was fine for him and
[1:48:07] his day but what about our day brothers
[1:48:09] and sisters if we receive the message of
[1:48:10] the hour then we receive the same sword
[1:48:12] we receive the same word we receive the
[1:48:15] same thus saith the Lord
[1:48:16] and you know what we have to believe
[1:48:18] that we can't go into it with fear we
[1:48:21] can't have fear perfect love the Lord
[1:48:24] Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:48:27] casteth out all fear how many times do
[1:48:31] you hear the apostles when we read about
[1:48:33] them like Philip and Stephen who is just
[1:48:36] about to be stoned coming up against the
[1:48:37] entire world is caving in on Stephen but
[1:48:40] what does he do he boldly preaches from
[1:48:43] Genesis to Revelation he preaches the
[1:48:45] gospel according to what the Lord had
[1:48:47] shown him every single Apostle had
[1:48:49] boldness is my point brothers and
[1:48:51] sisters William Miriam Branham he had
[1:48:53] boldness even though he was he was he
[1:48:57] was he was not treated well by this
[1:48:59] world he had boldness and the same thing
[1:49:00] with sons and daughters of God you know
[1:49:02] as many as believed on him to them gave
[1:49:05] he power to become the sons of God if we
[1:49:07] can believe that we're a son or a
[1:49:09] daughter of God what do we have to fear
[1:49:11] remember the story of the slave brother
[1:49:14] Branham tells that story of the slave in
[1:49:15] amongst all the slaves this one he
[1:49:17] wasn't beaten down and and dragon and
[1:49:20] mopen he had his chest out and his
[1:49:22] shoulders back and his chin High because
[1:49:24] he had Pride about who he was it didn't
[1:49:26] matter where he was geographically he
[1:49:28] knew who he was do we know who we are
[1:49:31] brothers and sisters I'm trying to
[1:49:32] encourage us today to just catch that
[1:49:34] Revelation that if we are truly Sons and
[1:49:37] Daughters of God if we've truly been
[1:49:38] baptized by the Holy Ghost truly in our
[1:49:40] lives we've got nothing to fear there's
[1:49:42] nothing to fear Satan will come around
[1:49:44] and try and knock on our door and we can
[1:49:46] tell him to take a hike we can tell him
[1:49:48] we rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[1:49:50] Christ we're not going to try and bring
[1:49:51] a strong railing accusation against him
[1:49:54] Before the Throne of mercy and grace
[1:49:55] we'll just tell him to go back to where
[1:49:57] he belongs and remind him of the
[1:49:59] scriptures that apply to him directly
[1:50:01] the promise that's in store for him very
[1:50:03] soon as soon as we get that Revelation
[1:50:05] about who we are in our day
[1:50:08] he says a king Knights a man with a
[1:50:11] sword he The Voice come back said not a
[1:50:15] king's sword but the king's sword the
[1:50:17] word of the Lord said fear not it's only
[1:50:20] the third Paul it's the Vindication of
[1:50:22] your ministry at the beginning of this
[1:50:24] message brother Branham talks about
[1:50:26] prophecy and how prophecy what happens
[1:50:29] with prophecy when prophecy comes forth
[1:50:32] it's it's speaking about something
[1:50:33] that's supposed to happen and then God
[1:50:35] comes around and he vindicates it and
[1:50:37] and brother Bradham in his ministry what
[1:50:40] happened was he was making history
[1:50:41] through the prophecy as he was
[1:50:44] prophesying he was creating history and
[1:50:46] it wasn't him creating history it was
[1:50:48] God vindicating that Ministry creating
[1:50:50] the history fulfilling the prophecy that
[1:50:53] was coming forth that there should be
[1:50:54] John the Baptist on Earth again that the
[1:50:57] Elijah Ministry should go forward right
[1:50:59] to the very end and the second last stop
[1:51:01] is in William Miriam Branham to the
[1:51:03] laodicean church age
[1:51:05] but how does he confirm his word
[1:51:07] brothers and sisters he vindicates that
[1:51:09] he brings it to pass that's what brother
[1:51:11] Branham taught us he makes his word come
[1:51:13] to pass
[1:51:15] further and what is the attraction on
[1:51:17] the mount what happened what's happened
[1:51:19] up on Mount Sunset he says it again it's
[1:51:22] not the same quote he says it over and
[1:51:24] over and over at the end of it what's
[1:51:25] happened what's the attraction on the
[1:51:27] mount try and get what's going on here
[1:51:29] because if you can understand what's
[1:51:31] actually happened here we might actually
[1:51:33] look at our entire lives just a little
[1:51:35] bit differently brothers and sisters
[1:51:37] what's happened upon Mount Sunset God
[1:51:39] confirming his word that's what all the
[1:51:41] noise is about
[1:51:44] notice it's God fulfilling his promise
[1:51:47] promised word again
[1:51:49] so I just want to pause for a second and
[1:51:51] talk about this I talked to a brother a
[1:51:53] while ago he said that it was God just
[1:51:54] vindicating himself with his man that's
[1:51:56] what happened that's what that cloud was
[1:51:58] and I said to him no it wasn't just a
[1:52:00] cloud no
[1:52:01] the Houston Coliseum was God vindicating
[1:52:03] himself with his man the cloud was a
[1:52:05] little bit different the cloud was way
[1:52:08] more significant so we can take this one
[1:52:10] quote quote here out of context if you
[1:52:12] go on and read the rest of it which I'm
[1:52:13] going to do now I believe it should just
[1:52:15] cause a shout in the hearts of Believers
[1:52:18] he says what what's happened on Mount
[1:52:19] Sam said God confirming his word that's
[1:52:22] what all the noise is about notice
[1:52:24] it's God fulfilling his promised word
[1:52:26] again of Revelations 10 1 to 7.
[1:52:32] God fulfilling his promised word again
[1:52:34] of Revelations 10 1-7 I'm probably going
[1:52:37] to have to just pick up on this quote
[1:52:39] right here and really dig into this in
[1:52:41] the future because it's so profound it's
[1:52:43] so significant that's that Mighty Angel
[1:52:45] descending with a shout coming down to
[1:52:47] earth with an open book in his hand and
[1:52:49] putting one foot on the land and one
[1:52:51] foot on the sea and declaring that there
[1:52:53] shall be time no more in the days of the
[1:52:55] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:52:57] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:52:59] be finished brothers and sisters that's
[1:53:01] already happened that's history what
[1:53:04] happened up on the mount sunset
[1:53:07] Revelations 10 1-7 in the days of the
[1:53:09] sounding of the seventh Angel's message
[1:53:11] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:53:12] the hidden Mystery of Revelations 10 1-7
[1:53:16] many people out there will say well we
[1:53:18] don't know that we don't understand that
[1:53:20] there's there's got to be a greater
[1:53:21] revealing of it and it will happen
[1:53:23] somewhere out there and that's a trick
[1:53:24] of the devil to say that you know what
[1:53:26] we're looking forward to something
[1:53:27] happening and looking back to what God's
[1:53:29] already done but ignoring what's already
[1:53:30] happening in our day brothers and
[1:53:32] sisters what's happening in our day how
[1:53:34] is this word becoming real to us in our
[1:53:36] lives that's what needs to be looked at
[1:53:38] that's what I think needs to happen when
[1:53:40] we hear this type of quoting when we
[1:53:42] hear this type of preaching this type of
[1:53:44] scripture does something rise up inside
[1:53:46] us and say Amen or are we still confused
[1:53:49] about it because brother Bradham at the
[1:53:50] end of this message he says people are
[1:53:52] still confused about this they still
[1:53:54] don't understand it back in 1963 or 65
[1:53:57] sorry
[1:53:59] in the days of the sounding of the
[1:54:01] seventh Angel's message the mystery of
[1:54:02] God should be finished the hidden
[1:54:03] Mystery of Revelations 10 1-7 the last
[1:54:06] message to the last Church age fulfills
[1:54:08] exactly in this age Luke 17 30. the day
[1:54:14] when the son of man shall be revealed
[1:54:17] many people are looking for a different
[1:54:19] day for the son of man to be revealed
[1:54:21] and you know what if they miss this day
[1:54:23] they will see the son of man revealed in
[1:54:25] Revelations 19 where he comes on a horse
[1:54:29] but all the people from this age who
[1:54:31] actually caught that revelation will be
[1:54:32] with him
[1:54:34] they're not looking to go then
[1:54:37] we're looking to go now
[1:54:39] Luke 17 30 the day when the son of man
[1:54:41] shall be revealed and there shall arise
[1:54:43] false prophets and false Christ and show
[1:54:45] signs and wonders in so much it had
[1:54:47] deceived the elected if possible
[1:54:51] excuse me
[1:54:52] and the people
[1:54:54] still in doubt
[1:54:56] and as usual
[1:54:58] the church
[1:54:59] is just as puzzled
[1:55:02] brothers and sisters don't let this
[1:55:04] puzzle you
[1:55:06] don't let this confuse you
[1:55:08] only believe
[1:55:10] if we can believe that God sent a
[1:55:12] prophet and that we can have the first
[1:55:14] and second pull activation of his
[1:55:16] ministry we can see great signs and
[1:55:17] wonders in our lives we can see healings
[1:55:19] we can see Mighty moves of the Holy
[1:55:22] Spirit In Our Lives that's all fine and
[1:55:23] good but you know what we've been
[1:55:24] talking about when I was a child I spake
[1:55:26] as a child I acted as a child I thought
[1:55:28] as a child but when that which is
[1:55:30] perfect is come you know what I put away
[1:55:33] childish things and I began to speak as
[1:55:35] a man I began to be fully mature as a
[1:55:38] Christian and understand the message of
[1:55:40] the hour it's not about signs and
[1:55:41] wonders it's not about healing that's
[1:55:43] all fine and good that follows but what
[1:55:45] we're after is the true meat of the word
[1:55:47] and that is a body change that's the
[1:55:49] understanding of the true baptism of the
[1:55:52] Holy Ghost if we wind up in the
[1:55:53] graveyard it'll get us out of there if
[1:55:55] we go the way of the sky it's God's
[1:55:57] choice one way or the other but it
[1:55:59] doesn't matter because if I've got the
[1:56:00] token if I've got the Holy Ghost then it
[1:56:02] doesn't matter to live is Christ to die
[1:56:04] is gain Hallelujah
[1:56:07] in Luke 10 Luke chapter 10 verse 21 in
[1:56:10] that hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit
[1:56:12] and said I thank thee O Father Lord of
[1:56:16] Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these
[1:56:18] things from the wise and The Prudent and
[1:56:20] has revealed them unto babes even so
[1:56:23] father
[1:56:24] for so it seemed good in thy sight
[1:56:27] I'm going to call the musicians and
[1:56:30] we're going to end right at noon and I
[1:56:32] just want to leave it there we're going
[1:56:33] to drill down on this I just feel so
[1:56:34] impressed to go this far think about it
[1:56:36] brothers and sisters don't let this be
[1:56:38] confusion if we are confused about the
[1:56:41] message of the hour that's Satan coming
[1:56:42] around and trying to mess our mind maybe
[1:56:44] some traditional teaching maybe some
[1:56:46] doctrinal thing maybe something that
[1:56:48] just hasn't been explained maybe
[1:56:49] something that just hasn't been revealed
[1:56:50] but let's just keep fellowshipping
[1:56:52] around this word Revelations 10 1-7 Luke
[1:56:55] 17 30 in the days when the son of man is
[1:56:59] revealed
[1:57:00] he's already been revealed
[1:57:03] he's already come from heaven
[1:57:06] he's already on Earth
[1:57:08] and we know there's been many doctrines
[1:57:10] of devils that have just gotten right
[1:57:11] into the middle of that and caused so
[1:57:13] many people to just go weird and crazy
[1:57:15] and make it something that it's not
[1:57:17] which causes the the the The Offspring
[1:57:20] of all of that becomes the yield is the
[1:57:23] word I'm thinking of the yield from all
[1:57:25] of that becomes scarecrows all over the
[1:57:26] place we can't do that because because
[1:57:28] we've seen this and and if we go this
[1:57:30] way oh we saw that and and all these
[1:57:33] things and it just becomes the devil
[1:57:34] causing fear in our lives but we have to
[1:57:36] come to the place brothers and sisters
[1:57:37] or we can snip all of those those ties
[1:57:40] that bind us and just allow us to soar
[1:57:42] into the heavenlies and just say you
[1:57:43] know what maybe I don't understand it
[1:57:45] maybe I just can't really get all of
[1:57:47] this stuff all this mysterious stuff
[1:57:49] because it's different than what I've
[1:57:50] ever heard
[1:57:52] but if we can only believe
[1:57:54] all things are possible brothers and
[1:57:56] sisters
[1:57:57] I trust that something was said today
[1:57:59] that might be encouraging to us
[1:58:02] just make sure that we understand where
[1:58:04] we stand I guess is the key
[1:58:07] we need to understand how late it really
[1:58:09] is brother Bradham said it so many times
[1:58:10] it's later than you think
[1:58:13] he was around for two years after sunset
[1:58:15] Mountain
[1:58:17] it's later than you think
[1:58:19] stand with me this morning
[1:58:22] gracious Heavenly Father Lord I pray
[1:58:25] that as late as it is that we would
[1:58:28] still have the ability to just come unto
[1:58:30] thee
[1:58:31] Lord that you would just continue wooing
[1:58:34] us that you would continue drawing us
[1:58:35] father that not one of us would be lost
[1:58:38] Lord we know that every single person on
[1:58:41] this Earth is a life that you have
[1:58:43] created
[1:58:46] excuse me
[1:58:47] every single one of us Lord Jesus relies
[1:58:50] on the same Grace every single one of us
[1:58:53] relies on the laws that you have laid
[1:58:56] down in this universe
[1:58:59] father I pray that you would just reveal
[1:59:01] yourself to those
[1:59:03] those babes Lord
[1:59:05] that you have chosen from in you before
[1:59:07] the foundation of the world I pray Lord
[1:59:10] Jesus that the words that were spoken
[1:59:11] today would just find the mark in the
[1:59:13] hearts of your children and father if
[1:59:15] there was anything spoken that was out
[1:59:17] of turn Lord forgive me for it because I
[1:59:19] never would want to mix your word I
[1:59:21] never would want to cause confusion I
[1:59:23] would only want to point people to you
[1:59:25] Lord I only want to uplift you Lord
[1:59:28] Jesus we're not here to promote the
[1:59:30] message of the hour even though we are
[1:59:32] and we know the message of the hour is
[1:59:34] you but we're not pointing to a man
[1:59:36] named William Miriam Bradham we're
[1:59:38] pointing to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:59:40] there's only one name under heaven
[1:59:43] whereby we can be saved and that's your
[1:59:46] name the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:59:49] we're so thankful for the Revelation
[1:59:50] that you've given us through the message
[1:59:52] of the hour we're so thankful that you

[2:00:02] have thank you for answering our prayers

[2:00:07] Lord Jesus even times where we don't
[2:00:09] even lift up a prayer with our voice
[2:00:11] just like that eunuch in his Chariot
[2:00:13] thinking on these things just meditating
[2:00:15] on these things speaking your word and
[2:00:18] pondering and you sent it to him you
[2:00:21] sent the answer directly to him oh
[2:00:23] father I pray that you would just
[2:00:24] Quicken this word to us today that you
[2:00:26] would just send to us Lord Jesus that
[2:00:29] fresh Revelation one more time you
[2:00:31] yourself personally revealed to us

[2:01:08] devil of cancer would be knocking on his
[2:01:10] door Lord Jesus greater is he that is in
[2:01:14] him than he that would come around
[2:01:16] through a doctor's testimony and try and
[2:01:18] declare a problem like that father we

[2:01:22] their dream Lord bless all that they do
