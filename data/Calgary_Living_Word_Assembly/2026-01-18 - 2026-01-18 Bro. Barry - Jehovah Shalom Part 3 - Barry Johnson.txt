TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thing when we can get together and dwell in unity. &gt;&gt; And I want to make it expressly clear as I announced this this morning. You know, I'm not interested in having an adversarial relationship. Sometimes when these things happen, people can get emotional and they can say things and we're always going to hear stuff in the background. But you know what? I just appreciate what Brother Brandham said. You know, when you would hear something and you'd think that's, you know, really distasteful and maybe a little bit sour. You know what? Maybe my brother didn't mean it that way. He he just didn't mean it that way or she just didn't mean it that way. You know, it it's it's up to us what we do when we hear stuff and you know how we actually process stuff. It's very important because we have a direct we have a direct instruction from the Lord. Let's not say that we have a direct instruction from the prophet even though we do from the Lord. But the word of God says to take every thought into captivity. &gt;&gt; Before we speak, let's run those words through the filter of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and see what he has to say about it. &gt;&gt; So, I just want to announce that this is happening and uh that I really appreciate that brother Toby came came to me and said this is what I'm I'm planning the leadership of the Lord in my life for me and my family. I very much appreciate that. So, for now, all I know is that they will hold their first service on March the 1st. I have no idea about details where or when or who. Um, that's completely uh up in the air for now. But you know what? We certainly want to encourage them. And if there's something that we can do for them, we can pray for them. We can certainly send encouragement and love. And you know, the great great consolation that I get from it is that brother Toby and Sister Faith, they're not leaving the city of Calgary. Their children aren't leaving the city of Calgary. We can actually still fellowship together. And you know, if we can't fellowship together, there's something wrong. There's there's a wrong spirit in there somewhere. If we can't fellowship together, and I one thing that I really do appreciate, Brother Toby said is, "Can the youth still fellowship?" And I said, "Of course they can. We We have an open door. Those two doors are open right now. And the other two doors downstairs, they're open right now. We have an open door here. &gt;&gt; We're not We're not interested in trying to segregate. And and and you know that word to the church back there, it says it very clearly from the prophet. Now, we can get into the prophet. If you haven't read that word to the church, you might want to read it sometime. But it says in there, "Don't get clanish." where it's just our group inside the group. &gt;&gt; That's not going to work. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Don't get clanished." So, we don't want to do that. We want to encourage our brother and our sister. And I want to say this. I can promise you one thing that brother Toby and sister Faith would not be doing this unless the Lord wanted them to. &gt;&gt; Because if the Lord didn't want this, it wouldn't be happening. Yes. &gt;&gt; And for anybody to think that maybe that's not true. Either he's God or he's not. &gt;&gt; Let's not say that maybe things could be happening and God's not in control. God is fully in control. &gt;&gt; So, we want to actually just see the Lord bless it. And, you know, we're we're I I was telling brother Toby this. I hope it's okay if I could just express my heart this morning a little bit. You know, I worked with brother Paul and uh I worked with him for many years and we worked with someone uh this this gentleman he he had a PhD in I think civil uh societies or something. I I can't remember what his degree was but one of the things that he did it was maybe it was just his dissertation. He said he told us when a city reaches a million people within 10 years they can actually reach 2 million people. It can take decades for a city to reach 1 million people. And that's the way it was for the city of Calgary. But then we saw it actually coming close to a million people and thinking, "Wow, that wasn't that long ago, brothers and sisters. I would say 15 maybe maybe 20 years." We had that conversation with Mike Michael and and he said, you know, it doesn't take that long. And here we are. Here we are. We're pushing 1.5 1.6 million people in the city of Calgary. It's probably not going to take long till we're two million people in the city of Calgary. &gt;&gt; I think it just is amazing to see how the Lord works. Don't you? &gt;&gt; It's just wonderful. So, we want to certainly appreciate Brother Toby and Sister Faith for their stand on the word and uh we certainly can pray for them and we can encourage them and just see what the Lord will do through them for the city of Calgary. And uh as I said, you know, they're not moving. So there should still be just just as much fellowship as we've had. Maybe not so much meeting on a Sunday or a Wednesday or whatever the Lord should lead them to do for service times, but we uh want to encourage the fellowship. We do not want to discourage that. And anybody that would ever say, "Brother Barry has discouraged fellowship," that person is under the influence of a lying spirit because brother Barry has never one time and never will discourage fellowship. That is a devil. So there you have it. There's going to be another lighthouse in the city of Calgary. And we certainly want to pray with them and trust that the Lord will bless them and lead them and guide them to reach those last predestinated seeds in this uh in this city. So God bless you this morning. I want to I want to pick up our our study last week from uh from Judges chapter 6 and talking about Gideon and how the Lord actually came around and and used this man and and such a mighty way. And you know, I just was thinking about it, this this story and you know, how Israel was crying out because of the persecution. It's such a terrible thing. Many times we can find ourselves in our lives crying out because of persecution in our lives. And you know, there's a reason why the children of Israel had persecution. It wasn't because the enemy was bad, even though it was. It wasn't because the enemy was there, even though it was. And it was actually I should correct myself because the enemy was there but you know they were given a specific instruction. &gt;&gt; They were given very direct instructions and it was to not tolerate the inhabitants of the land but to drive them out &gt;&gt; to get them out of the land. And you know in verse one of chapter 6 it says it right in there. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord. So what' the Lord do? Exactly what he said he would do. He did exactly what he said he would do. He is bound by his word. &gt;&gt; In the book of Deuteronomy, the the two laws, he said, "If you will, I will." And he said, "If you don't, then I will." It's it's it's pretty simple. It's it's cut and dried. The children of Israel, they did evil in the sight of the Lord. And you know how quickly it can happen. I I don't have the quotes in front of me this morning. I'm just going to I'm just going to preach a little from my heart here. I think it's it's amazing to look at this scripture and and see how how people can become bound up and and see c certain circumstances and situations and how they affect them in their lives and then you know sometimes wonder why is it the way it is. Sometimes we actually get off track. Sometimes we actually forget the commandments of the Lord. Sometimes we forget what the Lord has actually done for us in delivering us from the enemies in our lives, in our lands. But the children of Israel, they did this. But isn't it interesting that still even in the midst of this, they began to cry out. It was when they cried out that the Lord actually sent them a deliverer. And isn't it beautiful because he didn't send them an angel of the Lord with wings and a sword, a flaming sword to come and drive out the enemy. What did he do? He sent them a prophet. He sent them a prophet with the word of the Lord. And as I was reading this scripture this morning at the pulpit here this morning, this is just fresh. I think it's so interesting how it would be if we could actually fellowship with some of the people from old. And one day we will. But to think about the the spiritual aspect, the people who are for ordained before the foundation of the world and and they don't even realize it until it becomes a revelation to them. We don't know that we're sons and daughters of God until one day somebody actually tells us that we are. And then we have to look into the word of God and say, "Is that me?" Like looking into the mirror. Brother Brandham tells that story of the little kid looking into the mirror and he sees the little kid wave and and the little kid waves back and he raises his hand, his hand raises. Everything that happens, he begins to see a mimic of what he's doing and he can recognize that is myself. That's no other kid. I thought that was some other kid. And as believers of this word, sometimes we can look at it and think that's someone else. Someone else is going to have that faith. But that's not the case at all. When we can look into the word of God, that word strikes that seed gene of God. It actually does something for us. &gt;&gt; It actually starts to create a life inside of us. That seed gene takes off. It comes to life. But I got thinking about this. What would it be like for those people of old that actually understood thus saith the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. I know myself as a I I'll say a maybe a normal or or maybe more accurately an abnormal human being living in this world in in in you know the the 21st century just trying to make my way not really knowing if there is a God or or or if we should even believe that there's a God just just making my way before he came and introduced himself to me. But when I heard thus sayaith the Lord the first time, I thought that's kind of odd. That's that's kind of different. But you know, that's kind of the way it is for us in our lives in the day in which we live until it becomes a revelation. But going back to what I was thinking about those people who actually knew what thus sayaith the Lord meant, can you imagine their their their ability to receive that word in a moment to say there's something about that? That's thus sayaith the Lord. It's time to perk up our ears and listen because we have not heard thus sayaeth the Lord for a few years. And the judges, they hadn't. It had only been a few years, not very long. But here we are in the day in which we live. There's something inside of us that reacts when we hear, "Thus sayaeth the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. It's amazing to think out about how the Lord came and sent them a prophet and said, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth from the house of bondage." In our lives, we can look at that and say, "Praise the Lord. I've been able to hear thus sayaith the Lord in the day in which I live and to recognize that I've been brought out from the house of bondage." But many times we can find ourselves in a position where we say, "Praise the Lord. I'm not under bondage. I believe the message of the hour. But you know what? That's not what we've been called to just to believe the message of the hour. What we've been called to is a greater life. &gt;&gt; A greater life. The literal life of Jesus Christ to live out through us through that thus sayaith the Lord &gt;&gt; to call us to the message, but to get the message and take the message and eat it up &gt;&gt; and it will become sweet as honey in our mouth. BUT WHEN IT TELLS US YOU CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE, you shouldn't go there anymore, don't say that anymore, don't act that way anymore, it becomes bitter in our bellies. &gt;&gt; But aren't you thankful for thus sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; I just love it. I think it's so beautiful. You know, the children of Israel, they wondered why they were in bondage when they were down in in Egypt. And and it was a prophecy. It was a thus sayaith the Lord. We know that happened. God delivered them from it. Brought them out, gave them into their promised land. And and there they were in the promised land crying out. Why were they crying out? Why was Gideon threshing by his wine press privately? And we know, we know it says it in the word. He was doing it so that they wouldn't actually, the Midionites wouldn't actually see it. He was being covert about it in his promised land. He was being covert about it. The place where there was not supposed to be any man stand before them all the days of their life. We have to be careful. We don't want them to see, right? &gt;&gt; No. It's because they did evil in the sight of the Lord and it put them in bondage. And you know, evil, I'll say this, I think it's so amazing when you look at it. I heard it the first time from brother Eugene Braun this way. Evil isn't maybe as we suppose. It's not the rock and roll and it's not the maybe movies and Hollywood and all the stuff that's in this world that really is evil. One word off is evil. &gt;&gt; One word off is evil. One substitution is evil. One tradition that's greater than the word of God for the day in which we live is evil. And to think that God's going TO BLESS US. WHERE'S ALL THE MIRACLES? I THOUGHT THAT GOD SENT US A PROPHET IN THE DAY IN WHICH WE LIVE. I THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD SEE MIGHTY SIGNS AND WONDERS. What are we doing about it? Are we actually living according to the word &gt;&gt; for our day? Because if we are, then all the signs and wonders are going to follow. &gt;&gt; And they do. But sometimes I I feel like we can find ourselves in bondage and say, "You know what? If God really is with us, then where's all the miracles?" &gt;&gt; Don't look at the miracles. I want to encourage us today. Look at the word. &gt;&gt; Let's get our focus right. It has to be on the word. &gt;&gt; When we have our focus right, all of the miracles, they follow. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the children of Israel got back with God, he did something for them. And you know, he did something mighty in in the life of Gideon. And and we'll probably get into it, Lord willing, uh a little bit later, but you know, he the angel of the Lord came to him after the prophet did first, right? It wasn't before, it was after, but he said to them, "The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor." This is verse verse 12 and 13 of of chapter 6 of Judges. And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, then where is all this befallen us? What's befallen them?" They chose it. God told them, "If you don't do what I tell you to do, then this is what's going to happen." This is what was happening. But yet, they're scratching their head wondering, "Why is this happening?" &gt;&gt; Let's not be scratching our head wondering why these things in our life happens. Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt? But now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midionites. I think it's so beautiful. Now that he's actually talking to him, the Lord sees that he's got his attention. And the Lord looked upon him. I say, Lord, look upon me. Oh my. and said, "Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midionites. Have not I sent thee?" &gt;&gt; He didn't have to be threshing by his wine press privately. He could be serving the Lord with all of his might and saying, "This is the land that the Lord gave Moses to take us to. And this is the land when Moses was taken off the scene that Joshua was given to take us to and to positionally place us in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why weren't they talking about that? Because sin crept in and then it became traditional for them and they liked it that way. So they just kept doing it that way. But I think it's beautiful. You know, we'll we'll we'll just carry on in our story here. Verse 14 says, "And the Lord looked upon him and said, Go in this thy might, and and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites. Have not I sent thee?" And he said unto him, "Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is in is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house." Isn't it wonderful that he would recognize this? &gt;&gt; I think it's wonderful that we can recognize it as well. God does not choose the proud. He chooses the abase. &gt;&gt; He doesn't take the ones that are big and tall and head and shoulders above all the rest. That's what man does. &gt;&gt; We know the children of Israel did that. &gt;&gt; And look what it got him. got him a king that didn't believe. But isn't it interesting to think that after that what happened? The prophet came on the scene. The prophet came with thus sayaeth the Lord. Let me let me see your children. We know Jesse had a bunch of boys. Let me see all your boys. And he went through the house and he showed them all the boys. And there were fine specimens all the way along, weren't they? But then he said to him, "But isn't there one more? Isn't there one more? The spirit of the Lord isn't given me he thus sayaith the Lord here for some reason. I don't know what's going on." And he said, "Yeah, there's another one. He's out tending the father's sheep." And he said, "Get him. Get him." And we know that he was the ruddy fella. He was the one that didn't match what man's ideas were. &gt;&gt; But that's God's choice. His thoughts are not our thoughts, brothers and sisters. Neither his are his ways our ways. &gt;&gt; The only thing that we've got to do is follow the word. &gt;&gt; But I think it's beautiful because immediately he started doing what you know what most of the servants do that follow the Lord, that have been called of the Lord. You know, I I'm the least in my father's house. And you know what? I grew up in a poor family. How could we ever do this? I don't have an education. I don't have a big huge bank account. But I'm not going to get a tremendous inheritance of money from my forefathers. That's not going to happen. How could I be that one? I think it's important to recognize that uh that's God's choice. That's how he does it. My goodness. Verse 16 says, "And the Lord said unto him, surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midionites as one man." That's a tremendous thing because when you hear the story as we go about how many Midionites there were there. I don't know if we'll get that far today. There was a lot. &gt;&gt; There was a lot of Midianites in the land. I mean, the the word says that they couldn't even count their camels. &gt;&gt; There were so many camels there. There was, excuse me, so many people. But they're going to they're going to get smoked as one man. Verse 17. And he said unto him, "If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign. Show me a sign that thou talkest with me. Depart not hence I pray thee until I come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee." And you know the angel said to him, "I will tarry until thou come again." We talked about this last week. You know, a few hours later, he turns up again with the sacrifice, with a gift for him. And Gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephath of flour and flesh. He put it in a basket, and he put forth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it. Very, very similar to what what what Abram did too, right? When Abram was getting his his change, his name change, we know that three men approached and he said, "My Lord," by revelation, we know that that's what happened. But very very similar, he he brought out his his his present. He brought him a present and gave it to him and presented it to him. And the angel of God, verse 20, said unto him, "Take the flesh and unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth." And he did so. And the angel of the Lord put forth the end of his staff, and was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight. Isn't that wonderful to think about that story? We talked about that. I think we ended with that last week. How he was able to say to him, you know, I if if if I found grace in your sight, then show me a sign that that thou talkest with me. And what did he do? He he was able to go and create this this offering unto the Lord. And I I just want to encourage us today, brothers and sisters. We all have an opportunity to bring that offering unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; It starts with bringing our soul, our whole mind, body, and soul, and giving it to the Lord. Putting it upon that rock of revelation that thus saith the Lord for the day in which we live and saying, "Be it unto me according to thy word." I might not understand it. I might not be able to explain it, but something inside of me says, "I believe it. And when we can do that, brothers and sisters, don't think that we don't have a gift, that we don't have a present that we can bring the Lord. But once that happens, I think it's so beautiful. And I believe it with all my heart that the musicians are a fine example of those people that have this revelation, they have a present that they can bring and offer unto the Lord week after week, service after service. by bringing a gift and offering it unto the Lord. The music, the the the the worship that the Lord has put in their heart, right in their soul, it's another avenue to worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But let's not stop with the musicians because it's not just for musicians. It's all about the worship in the heart of the believer. &gt;&gt; That is the most beautiful thing I can think of, brothers and sisters. Once we've had that revelation that we can pour ourselves out, like those quotes we read last week, pour our souls out before the Lord as an offering and see if he won't consume it. &gt;&gt; And what does he do? He burns out the old man. &gt;&gt; That's what takes place. THE OLD MAN DIES. We no longer have the desire to go to where we went. We don't have the desire to listen to what we do. We don't have the desire to say the things that we said or think the way we thought. But what happens is the devil comes around and says, "Remember how much fun that was? You like that song? Come on, just press play once." And when you do, what happens? Before long, you're like, "Wow, yeah." And then you shake out of it and you say, "No, no, no, no. That old man's dead." &gt;&gt; And you have to bury him again. That's why Paul said, "I die daily." &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's with music. Sometimes it's with shorts. And I'm not talking about pants. I'm talking about videos. Sometimes it's with video games. &gt;&gt; There's many different things in our lives that are of the old man. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you if it's of the old man or not. You want to know how. &gt;&gt; Does it take your time? Does it consume your mind? &gt;&gt; Does it take you away from thinking about the things of the Lord? If it does that, it's of the old man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pour it out on the rock and say, "Lord, I don't like this anymore. I WISH THAT YOU WOULD take it from me. CONSUME IT. BURN IT OUT of me. &gt;&gt; And with all sincerity, if it is all sincerity, he will. &gt;&gt; He will. But if we think that we can entertain on one hand parts and provisions of the old man and parts and provisions of the thus sayaith the Lord revelation in the day in which we live, we are mistaken because God won't accept it. It'll be a vain sacrifice that we bring and we pour out and think, "Wow, he's going to be happy with it." He won't be happy with it. And then we'll wonder why he's not happy with it. And you know what will happen in our heart? We will hear him say, "Just do like your brother and I'll accept it and whoever's inside of us will come forth." Will we say, "Oh Lord, be it unto me. I do want to be like my brother. I do want to bring a worship that you'll receive." Or will we be like, "Oh no, I'm gonna murder that guy. I don't like that guy." &gt;&gt; Remember the story of Cain and Abel? You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Cain was of his father, the what? The devil. We know what happened there. &gt;&gt; But Gideon, talking about our story here, he had a present that he was able to offer the Lord. And it's such a wonderful thing to think that this guy had a present that he gave the Lord. Abram had a present that he offered the Lord. And we too have a present that we can offer the Lord. &gt;&gt; And many times it's in different ways. Sometimes it's with worship. Sometimes it's it's with our attendance in the church. Sometimes it's it's being able to just pray for people. Sometimes we can actually offer a gift, something that maybe somebody wouldn't do for themselves ordinarily. We can just offer it to them because we know it would make them happy. There's many different presents that we can do. But you know the word of God says, "As you've done to the least of these, my little children, you've done unto who?" You've done unto me. &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing when we look at it that way. But he he brought this present and and gave it to the to the Lord, to this angel. And we know that it was the Lord in angel form, in angelic form. Some people want to get to the scientific formula calculation of was it really the Lord? Because it says it was an angel. Brother Brham, he says that it was the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was the theophony form of the Lord in an angel. Just like he says in who was this Melzdc? Who was Melzdc? Some people would say, well, he he he he was a different guy. He was one other personality that's just maybe now what happens is we wind up with four persons in the in the maybe not Holy Trinity anymore if that's the case because there's a fourth man, right? And that's not the way it is. Who was that guy? He was without mother. He was without father. He was without descent. Beginning of days or ending OF LIFE. THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON THAT fits that description. &gt;&gt; And don't think for a second that God Almighty couldn't just &gt;&gt; a body and then just step into it. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful to think that's the case? We know that the word of God says that many times people entertain angels unawares &gt;&gt; that angel could be the Lord himself &gt;&gt; in a human body &gt;&gt; not as Jesus because Jesus is seated at the right hand of the father. Now many people might be thinking brother Barry you're getting crazy talking this way and you know we're talking about God. We're talking about God Almighty. Don't think for a second that he can't do whatever he wants to do. We know that in Balam's day he could actually speak through a donkey. And he did, didn't he? God can do anything he wants to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anytime he wants to do it, he'll never be outside of his word. But I think it's beautiful because we we could actually entertain an angel in our life and not even know that that's an angel. Not even know it. That's the word of God. But he had his present and he came and he offered it and and you know he did it with all sincerity, didn't it? You know how he did it with all sincerity? The angel accepted it. The angel actually consumed his present. And how do we know that the Lord has accepted our sacrifice? When he does consume it. When he does take it. when he actually accepts it. And uh it's just such a beautiful thing that we're able to bring our presence unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 22. And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord, Gideon said, "Alas, oh Lord God, for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face." And the Lord said unto him, "Peace be unto thee. Fear not, thou shalt not die." And I think that's actually a message that applies today to every single believer that's ever alive right now in the end time and maybe through all all times any believer of this word. This applies just just peace be unto thee and and fear not. Thou shalt not die. Many people will say, "Well, Brother Barry, many people I know who are believers, they've actually are are in a coffin in a graveyard somewhere out there and they died." No, they never. They just changed their dwelling pace. &gt;&gt; Because death is not a part of life. &gt;&gt; Death is never going to be a part of the literal life of Jesus Christ. If we have his life inside of us, we can never die. The Lord said unto him, "Peace be unto thee, fear not. Thou shalt not die." &gt;&gt; I personally believe this with all my heart. When we get that revelation in our lives that we shall not die, it doesn't matter what devil comes around our life. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what any doctor tells us because we have something to stand on. &gt;&gt; We know that we shall not die. You cannot die. If the devil, the bully, knows that he can scare you, he's going to bully you and he's going to scare you. But if the devil knows that he's not going to actually bully you and scare you, you're going to say boo back to the devil when he comes around. He's not going to want to come and try and do something to you. &gt;&gt; But I love this. I just want to take it and make it my own. I hope that we can do that today together. And and the Lord said unto him, "Peace be unto thee," fear not. Thou shalt not die. &gt;&gt; And I wonder, it makes me wonder, read in the scripture, how many people were afraid? How many people actually did die? And and we'll get into maybe a little further here. You know, they they actually went and found themselves living in in caves. They were living in caves. The children of the promise, the ones that were delivered out of bondage, were living in their promised land, hiding out in strongholds and in caves because of the INHABITANTS OF THE LAND. Why is that? They were instructed to destroy the inhabitants of the land. And I just want to encourage us this morning, if we have the the idea that we need to spiritually run and hide into a cave, we need to find a a safe spot that we can get to because of the persecution of the devil. Now, I'm preaching to myself. If we have to feel like we have got to do something to run and hide, you know what? The name of the Lord is a strong tower &gt;&gt; and the righteous can run into it &gt;&gt; and be saved. The devil can't touch us. Not unless God sees it fit for him to do so. And if he does, it's only going to be for God's glory in our lives. But the Lord said unto him, "Peace be unto thee, fear not. Thou shalt not die." Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord, and called it Jehovah Shalom. And you know, if I had to title this the last message and this message, I'm terrible for that. I guess I'm not that that scholarly, I would call them Jehovah Shalom. As we talk about Gideon, Jehovah Shalom. That is our God. Jehovah Shalom. The mighty name Jehovah and all of the other attributes that he has. Shalom. And you know, Brother Brandham preached that. We preached it at the beginning of the year. Peace. God's peace be upon thee. Fear not, you shall not die. And what did Gideon say? Hey, I'm going to build an altar unto the Lord, and I'm going to call this place Jehovah Shalom. I think if I had the opportunity, I would say, brothers and sisters, we can call our spot, our altar, Jehovah Shalom. And it says unto this day, it's an Oprah of the Abysserites. I looked it up, and Jehovah Shalom is not actually identifiable as an actual place today. It's not actually known exactly where this was. There is a state park in Israel that is called Gideon's Spring, I believe it is. There's a cave there, but it's not proven that this is actually the place. And you know, I heard a historian say that this is actually assumed that this is the place based on the fact that it was it was written in the books book of Judges at the time. So they had a an idea of where it was, but where it was exactly, it doesn't really matter, does it? &gt;&gt; The fact of the matter is that it happened. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It happened. He was able to build an altar, and he was able to say that this was unto the Lord and call it Jehovah Shalom. Unto this day, it is yet an Oprah of the Abby. Where I want to get to today with our service is the next verse 25. And it came to pass the same night that the Lord said unto him, "Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath." What does his dad have an altar of Baal for? &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Aren't they believers delivered out of the bondage of Israel? &gt;&gt; What's he GOT AN ALTAR TO BAAL? Throw down the altar of Baal thy father hath and cut down the grove that is by it. What's going on here? &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; This is an example for us in the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; The word of God says that we need to make our own calling and election sure. Yes. &gt;&gt; If this guy, if this fella would have rode the coattales of his daddy's religion, &gt;&gt; what would have happened? &gt;&gt; He would have been consumed and he would have died. &gt;&gt; He would have been afraid first. But something happened in his life. God came to him personally. And isn't that the truth about the message of the hour? That's what the new birth is. God coming to the individual personally and showing them, take everything you think you know and set it aside and run it through the filter of my word and take it for yourself. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Why is that? You say, "Brother Barry, because God has no grandchildren." &gt;&gt; Because I'm a believer doesn't mean that my children get a free pass to heaven. They have to have their own relationship with the Lord God. Jehovah Shalom. &gt;&gt; It's got to be their own deal, not mine. I can make the introduction, but they've got to become friends. And I'll tell you, that's my heart's desire. I'm not interested in trying to paint a flowery picture of religion. I want my children to have a real relationship with the King of Kings and Lord of Lords for themselves. Cuz if I talk him into it, someone can talk them out of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And what's worse is if I show them that I've got a little secret altar to bail. &gt;&gt; I believe the message of the hour, but I also believe this. &gt;&gt; And I got a grove, man, that's right beside it. It's a beautiful place. My goodness. It's so peaceful and tranquil. Oh my. And you know what? Everybody's doing it. SO IT'S OKAY, IS IT? It's exactly what put the children of Israel in that position that they had this plus that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There ain't none of it. We're supposed to drive out all of the inhabitants of the land. So, how do we do that? Take the old man and make sure that old man is dead. How much of that old man? Every single speck of that old man's got to die. Because remember, brothers and sisters, and this this makes me shudder because I know I know this guy all too well, and I'm sure that we could all say that. We all know ourselves way better than anybody else. But, you know, there isn't going to be any sin that actually inherits. What's going to happen is we're just going to change our dwelling place. Our character is not going to magically be transformed because we actually go in the rapture. Our character is not going to magically be transformed because we actually go by the way of the grave. Who we are right now is who we're going to take with us. That is who we are going to be. &gt;&gt; So what has to happen before we see a body change either by death of this flesh or a rapture where the molecular composition changes into our theophony bodies. Before that happens, there's got to be a character change. &gt;&gt; The rapture is not going to change our character. It's only going to change our dwelling place. It's an amazing thing to think about. But this guy here is instructed by the Lord. Isn't it beautiful? Take and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it. the first order of business that God tells him, "You're a mighty man of valor, Gideon. I love you and you're going to take out all of the enemy just as one. It's not going to be a big huge fight. You don't have to worry. I'm going to do it for you. But there's first there's some some business that we've got to tend to &gt;&gt; and you need to get rid of that father's tradition. That is not going to help you. It's going to hinder you." Isn't it wonderful about the mighty grace of our Lord God? how we can actually have a relationship with the Lord ourselves and we don't have to rely on our parents. And you know, many times I'll tell you, our parents probably look at us, my children probably look at me and say, "I know daddy behaves this way. He's got this problem and he's got that problem and I know if I if I push this button, I'll get that result. I know I know him. They know me. But they don't have to rely on my religion because my religion will put them into a tribulation. &gt;&gt; I don't want religion &gt;&gt; and I don't want to give them religion. &gt;&gt; I want to give them an introduction to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. &gt;&gt; To the Lord of Hosts, &gt;&gt; to the literal life of Jesus Christ to recognize that it's not just a a a a Easter bunny. It's not just chocolates at Easter. It's not Santa Claus and presents at at Christmas. It's not just a resurrection. A death, burial, and resurrection 2,000 years ago. There was a death, burial, and resurrection July 27th, 2005. In an upper room experience in Calgary, living word assembly for this guy. There was a death, burial, and a resurrection. The death and the burial was the old man dying out. And the resurrection was Jesus Christ, the king of kings and lord OF LORDS IN MY LIFE. I HOPE BROTHERS AND SISTERS that we can ALL SAY WE KNOW WHEN THAT HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; Then there came a time where I recognize water baptism isn't just something flowery an option. I knew I was baptized in titles. But that wasn't enough. Paul said if you've been baptized in titles, you haven't even been baptized at all. And you need to be baptized again. When that revelation hit me, Brother Logan and I got to go down to the Bow River in Calgary and actually get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins because we recognized it was according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; But the death, burial, and resurrection isn't something 2,000 years ago. And that's not what I'm interested in presenting to anybody. I want to show them a living God in this life right here. As I walk and I talk, there is something different about me. It's got to be that way, brothers and sisters. He has to be the I am of today. &gt;&gt; The Lord God walking in our lives, living out through us. Our body change is not going to change our character. Verse 26 gives them the instructions in 25. and throw down the altar of Baal thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it, and build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock in the ordered place." It's so beautiful because the Lord already knew he knew how to build an altar, didn't he? Clear off all of the old, get rid of all of the old religion, get rid of all of the old tradition, get rid of all of that, and build an altar unto the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. and take the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down. Isn't that beautiful? I think that's so beautiful. Take that grove, those trees, that beautiful tranquil place, that that that place where all of the wonderful things happen and and cut it down and burn it up. make that the altar and burn it with the wood that you cut down from there. Verse 27 says, "Then Gideon took 10 men of his servants and did as the Lord had said unto him, and so it was because he feared his father's household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day, so he did it by night." In doing that, he knew that he was going to suffer persecution because they already gave the Midianites a a place to stay, a place to lodge and proinder for their animals. They were already in the land, which is so strange. But they went and did according to the word of the Lord. 28 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bulock was offered upon the altar that was built. And they said one to another, "Who hath done this thing?" And when they inquired and asked, they said, "Gideon, the son of Joash, hath done this thing." Now it's getting sticky. Now the persecution's going to come. But remember, he knew in his heart, the angel of the Lord told him, "Don't be afraid because you shall not die." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know how to build an altar. Just go forward, you mighty man of valor. &gt;&gt; You're going to save Israel. &gt;&gt; You are going to save Israel. What a tremendous thing that is. Then the men of the city said unto Joash, "Bring out thy son that he may die." &gt;&gt; Interesting. Okay. &gt;&gt; They were willing to kill him for their father's traditions. &gt;&gt; It's the same way today. The religious spirit is so savage. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It will kill for that tradition. &gt;&gt; Right. Then the men of the city said unto Joash, "Bring out thy son, that he may die, because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, because he had cut down the grove that was by it." Now Joash caught in the middle as a father, you can imagine, &gt;&gt; he's afraid. He's afraid. He never got the revelation. He never got the visit by the angel. He never heard the word of the prophet or he would have changed his ways. Joash said unto the all that stood against him, "Will ye plead for Baal?" Suddenly, it's coming back to him. Wait a second. This isn't what I was taught. This isn't what what Joshua taught us and our our parents coming out of bondage as he positionally placed us in the land uh uh the promised land. This isn't what he taught us. Joash said unto all that stood against him, "Will ye plead for Baal? Will ye save him? You're going to worry about an idol? &gt;&gt; You're going to worry about the Midianites God. Now there's a separation happening. &gt;&gt; The grace of the kind-loving father. Hey, &gt;&gt; to even look after the family as a whole. He that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet mourning. If he be a god, let him plead for himself because one hath cast down his altar. One boy could come in and take down his altar and and shred his grove and offer a sacrifice with the wood from that grove and he's a god. Are you serious? If he was a god, then he wouldn't allow that to happen. Remember, they took the ark of the covenant, the enemies of the land, and they put it in the temple of Dagon. Not in this story, but in a further story, they put the temp the ark in the temple of Dagon. And what happened that that that idol Dagon, they would come back in the morning and they would find that idol on its face before the ark of the covenant. &gt;&gt; And they would stand it up and say, "There's something fishy going on. There's something weird about this." And they would come back the next day. It would be on its face before the ark of the covenant. &gt;&gt; And we know it even happened again. And the next time they came back, the hands were gone, the feet were gone, and it was just the stump of this idol before the ark of the covenant. Nothing can stand before this word, &gt;&gt; especially in the day in which we live, brothers and sisters. But it's so beautiful to look at this how Gideon, the mighty man of valor, who's the least of all of his household, the the maybe the least educated, maybe not even the smartest out of all of them. But that's the one that God chose to be that one to come and not just tear down the idols of all of the men, to tear down the idols of his family, his dad's altar unto Baal. &gt;&gt; To destroy that tradition &gt;&gt; and it's immediately they're talking, oh no, someone's got to die for this. But his dad had to come to the rescue. His dad was starting to get revelation out of this, wasn't he? His dad said, come and let Hey, you know what? If one person can cast down this altar, then can't your god actually be a god and deal with him? Verse 32 says, "Therefore on that day he called him Jerubable, saying, let Baal plead against him because he hath thrown down this altar." He got a name change for it, didn't he? &gt;&gt; He became a new creature in Christ Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was a deliverer of the children of Israel. Then all the Medidianites and the Amalachites and the children of the east were gathered together and went over and pitched in the valley of Jezel. You can imagine now there was a stir in the land. And a lot of the people, a lot of the the religious people, a lot of the message people in that day probably said, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. that guy, he actually he messed with our God. Now we're in for it. But something actually probably settled in his heart to say, "Hey, this is exactly what the angel of the Lord said. I don't know how it's going to happen. I can't explain it, but I know he said I'm not going to die. So don't worry." He told me, "Fear not. We're not going to die." What a tremendous thing it would be to be caught in the middle of that. But the spirit of the Lord, verse 34, came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, and Abzar was gathered after him. And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, who was gathered after him. And he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Nefali, and they came up to meet them. And Gideon said unto God, "If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said, behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the floor in the floor. And if the dew be on the fleece only, and if it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said." Isn't it interesting to see how this story is going &gt;&gt; here? This guy had been called by the prophet. He heard, "Thus sayaith the Lord." Then an angel of the Lord came and visited him personally. Made himself known personally. He had a little bit of a new birth experience. Fear not. Thou shalt not die. You're a mighty man of valor. God's going to use you for a great purpose. And and here now after all of that following the instruction of the Lord, tearing down the idol of of the tearing down the altar of the idol rather and and seeing that he hasn't been killed even though they said bring him out. We're going to kill him. This guy deserves to die. But somehow he didn't die. How'd that happen? That was the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wasn't it? &gt;&gt; Now it comes time for the battle. and he can see it forming and he doesn't know exactly how it's going to take place but he knows God's called him and here he is in this position and he puts out a fleece before the Lord and many times we know that we have all done this and if we haven't sometimes I think it would do us well if we did do it sometimes we need a sign from the Lord we know that he's called us unto adoption with full authority and power that's the word for our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But sometimes we just need a little assurance. Sometimes we just need a touch from the father. I've heard it said sometimes we just need our dad to just reach over and put his hand on us and let us know that he loves us. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not a a bad thing, brothers and sisters, to just put a fleece out before the Lord and say, "If this is what's actually going to take place, then just let it be like this according to your word and see if God won't do it." Amen. &gt;&gt; Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor. And if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand as thou hast said. Take him at his word. Take him at his word and see if he won't actually reveal himself to us just the way that we need him to reveal himself. the way that he does to other people isn't necessarily the way that he will for us. And to try and categorically say it has to be a certain way is wrong. I'm so thankful that the prophet for a day said there's only one infallible evidence that you have the Holy Ghost in your life. You will not deny the word of God. &gt;&gt; If you deny one word of God, you don't have the Holy Ghost. Unfortunately, that's the truth. We've got to say it that way, brothers and sisters. To defy the word of God means you don't have the right spirit. &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Holy Ghost will never deny himself, which is the word. But sometimes I think it's good to put a fleece. Sometimes we're not talking about necessarily getting a fleece. Does everybody here know what a fleece is? A skin from from a a a lamb. &gt;&gt; You can buy them in the store. You can get lamb skkins and you can take it out. Maybe a sheep skin. You can take it out and you can put it on the ground. And I'm not talking about that. Even though that's exactly what we're talking about in this story. What I'm saying is actually ask the Lord something specific and very private to you in your life and put it before the Lord and see if he won't do it. &gt;&gt; Ask him very specifically, not in a vague manner, but in a very specific manner. If this, then that. and see if he won't. &gt;&gt; We're not asking the Lord to clown and I'm not encouraging us to do that because he will not perform for nobody. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about third pole stuff here. We're talking about communicating with the Lord so so that we understand in a way that we will understand it. And it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks or says because it's not about them. It's only about us and the Lord. It was only about Gideon and the Lord. He knew that he already heard from the Lord. And that's why he wanted a confirmation about what he had heard from the Lord. Because the devil comes around and says, "Yep, you heard about the Lord. You heard from the Lord. But you know what? He He's probably busy with new converts. He's probably busy maybe with other things going on. You don't want to actually bring too many prayer requests. You don't want to actually make a problem. You don't want to stand out." That's what the devil's going to say. But he wants us to. He wants us to cry out. Brother Brandham said that as he he created children in this world, babies, he never gave them a better way to cry out when they need something. And he talks about it in terms of the ecclesiastical way. Maybe what they should do is give that baby just a little bell and get the baby to ring a bell when he's hungry. The baby's not going to ring a bell. THE BABY'S GOING TO CRY OUT THE WAY THAT HE WAS CREATED TO. &gt;&gt; And it's the same for us, brothers and sisters. Don't be afraid to cry out. But look at this story. I just think it's such a wonderful thing. He says, "Behold, I will put out a fleece of wool on the floor. And very specifically, if the dew be on the fleece only, and it shall be dry upon all the earth beside it, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel in mine hand, as thou hast said." thinking about this story just from my own human perspective. I know that I've actually had conversations like this with the Lord and I know that, you know, the next day comes around and suddenly there's, you know, maybe there's a text message and maybe there's something that has to be done and then there's something else that pops up and and another thing and another thing and another thing and you're before you know it, you haven't even really gotten going in your day. you haven't even left your house yet and your mind is racing 100 miles an hour because you got all these different things that you know you have to tend to and you got to deal with and and maybe what will happen is you'll actually stumble out the door and as you're stumbling out the door you'll stumble over something and you'll be like what's that and you'll carry on and and and go your way but what happens is I've experienced this get in the vehicle and start to drive away and think wait a second that thing that I stumbled over I wasn't even expecting it I wasn't even thinking about it but didn't I ask the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about something literally. I'm talking about something in my mind that I would stumble over as I walk out the door. Didn't I ask the Lord about that? Did you not ask about that thing specifically? And the reminder comes in. Wait a second. You actually laid that out as a fleece to say, if it's going to happen, let it happen this way. And he comes and answers it. And our lives can come sometimes get so busy and get in our way and keep us distracted from recognizing God answering exactly specifically the question that we gave him. &gt;&gt; Verse 38. And it was so. For he rose up early on the mororrow and thrust the fleece together, squished it together, and ringed, &gt;&gt; and the dew out of the fleece a bowl full of water. The ground was dry, but that fleece was full. How do you explain that? But it wasn't enough for Gideon, was it? And you know the word says that we should ask abundantly. Why? So that our joy will be full. &gt;&gt; Gideon said unto God, "Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak. But this once, let me prove, let me prove, I pray thee. But this once with the fleece, let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew. The opposite to what he had asked originally. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, the point that I want to get to with this is quite simple. God knows exactly our station. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly where we are at. He knows exactly what our personalities are like. He knows exactly all about it. The end from the beginning in our lives. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we can get in a position where we think that he, you know what, I've done this, so he's not even going to listen to me. He is listening. Even when you've done things wrong, Gideon found himself in a position where all the people around him were doing wrong. And I'll tell you what, you would say maybe he was right because he was a mighty man of valor. He was doing wrong. This is just brother Barry speaking here. Maybe we can have a conversation about it somewhere. I know Hebrews 11 speaks of this guy and I'm not going to dispute that for a second. He had a faith because he was able to receive the word for his day. But was he not doing wrong when he was actually hiding the fact that he was threshing in the promised land. There's not one man that was able to stand before them all the days of their life if they were following the word of Joshua. But the family tradition put him in a position where he had to behave that way. I say, Lord, help me not have any family traditions that would put my children in such a place where they feel like they have to actually hide from the enemies. The enemies that my that their daddy let in the door. Can you imagine doing that for your families? What a tragic place that would be. Goodness. Verse 40 says, "And God did so that night, for it was dry upon the fleece only, &gt;&gt; and there was dew on all the ground." Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Don't think for a second, brothers and sisters, that he's not listening. Just because we get off track, just because we have errors in our lives, just because all of the different circumstances, it doesn't mean that he's still not God. He is God and he wants to deliver us. &gt;&gt; He hasn't left us or forsaken us. We always do. And what what did the prophet say? He said just go back to where you got off. &gt;&gt; Just go back to where you got off. But what is the biggest hindrance to that is pride. &gt;&gt; No, I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK all the way there because then I'll have to go and talk to those people or maybe I'll have to go and do that thing or pay that thing or whatever that thing. I'll tell you what, brothers and sisters, some of the greatest rewards that you could ever experience in your life is to go back and actually humble yourself in the sight of the Lord before your brother or your sister and make that thing right and actually see if he won't come on the scene and bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm talking from experience now. &gt;&gt; Speaking from experience, sometimes you got to go and make things right. Sometimes I know it. I've experienced it in my life. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to deny. Sometimes you can do things in your life you can't undo. &gt;&gt; But you can go and try and make it right. &gt;&gt; You can go and try and make it right. And you know what it might do is it might just show that other person or people that there's something different about you. What is it that happened in your life? And you can tell them, you know what, the old man's dead. &gt;&gt; The old man's dead. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care about the past. Just like Paul said, I'm forgetting about all the things that were in the past because they are in the past. And what I'm doing is I'm pressing towards the mark for the prize not of the church. I'm pressing towards the mark OF THE PRIZE NOT of the family. I'm pressing towards the MARK OF THE PRIZE OF THE HIGH CALLING OF GOD IN Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; The word for my day. &gt;&gt; Not going to let anything stand in my way. &gt;&gt; Amen. OH, BUT DON'T YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS? I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. &gt;&gt; Don't you KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER? I don't care about that. The only thing I care about is crossing that finish line with the token in my hand. &gt;&gt; Don't think for a second that it's actually out of order to ask the Lord to show you something. &gt;&gt; If you want him to show you something, he'll do it. &gt;&gt; Guarantee you he'll do it. and he'll do it in a way that's specific to you, which is so beautiful. That's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; It's not just a cookie cutter religious thing where it's got to be according to the way the church says. No, it ain't. It's according to the way he says. &gt;&gt; So beautiful. &gt;&gt; You know, why were they why were they in this position, brothers and sisters? Why were they in this position? because they actually forsook the word of God. And and what word of God? The word of God through the prophet. Because God never came down and spoke to the children of Israel himself. He gave them Moses. And God never came down and spoke to the children of children of Israel himself. He he when Moses passed away, he gave them Joshua. &gt;&gt; And Joshua is the one that they ought to have been listening to. But you know when they were being positioned in the land in in in Judges chapter 1, you know, it came to the place in the book of Judges where every man they they just did everything that was fine in their own sight, right? Everything that they felt was okay in their own sight, they just did. Why was that? Because they came to a place of callousness. You know, brother Brandham in the church age book, he talks about what causes people, what causes the devil to get a foothold in people's life. He says sickness, disease, indifference, and sin, unbelief, indifference, just being like, "Yeah, it's the message. I know it. I've been in it my whole entire life. There's nothing that you could ever teach me or tell me." As soon as that comes out, you know what? You're right. You're 100% right. But you can have sin, which is unbelief. You can have indifference, or you can have an illness. And all of those things will cause people to become callous towards the word of God, &gt;&gt; the living word of God. And that's all we're talking about. We're not talking about the historical records. Even though we are talking about the story of Gideon, I I'm trying to encourage us to recognize, let's resurrect Jesus Christ from 2,000 years ago and see him alive and well in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we're not seeing that in our lives, then I want to encourage us to seek that. Put a fleece before the Lord and say, "If you are God, then be God to me. Show me that fleece will only be wet and all of the ground will be dry." And then, you know what? JUST ONE MORE TIME, don't be angry. DON'T GET HOT WITH ME, BUT SHOW ME THAT THE GROUND CAN be wet and that fleece can be dry. Be God to me in the way that I need to see it. And I promise you, brothers and sisters, he will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But you know what? First, we got to be willing to tear down those altars. We got to be willing to tear down all that we think we know. We got to be willing to GET OURSELVES COMPLETELY HUMBLE IN THE sight of the Lord so that he can lift us up. &gt;&gt; Or else, forget it. &gt;&gt; The only thing we're doing is playing religion. &gt;&gt; The children of Israel, what did they do? They didn't kick out the inhabitants of the land. That's what happened, &gt;&gt; right? God through the prophet Joshua told him, "You can have the promised land as long as you actually follow my word and serve the Lord. You will have peace. You will have tranquility. You will have this land that is large, that flows with milk and honey, with pomegranates, with grapes, with figs. You'll have cities THAT YOU NEVER BUILT, HOUSES THAT YOU CAN INHABIT, GARDENS THAT YOU NEVER PLANTED. ALL OF THIS WILL BE yours if you follow the word of the vindicated prophet Joshua. But what happened was they got into the land and they just they just didn't do it. They started to ask questions like in the book of Judges 1 verse one. After the death of Joshua, it came to pass the children of Israel asked the Lord saying, "Who shall go for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them?" And the Lord said, "Judah." And we know that he went out and he actually did fight with them, but he never destroyed them. Judah went with Simeon, his brother. This is verse 17. And they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zapath and utterly destroyed it. They destroyed that place. And the name of the city was called Horma. And Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Ascalon on the coast thereof, and Echron, and the coast thereof. And the Lord was with Judah, and drove out the inhabitants of the mountain. Oh, &gt;&gt; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron. But if you go back in Joshua, I feel like I want to start preaching now. If you go back in the book of Joshua, &gt;&gt; he said to them, "How long are you going to be SLACK IN YOUR PROMISE?" &gt;&gt; HERE WE ARE. We're in the promised land, but you're not doing anything about going and getting into your own inheritance. &gt;&gt; What you're doing is living in other people's inheritances. And they said, "Oh, don't you know that they have chariots of iron down in the valleys?" And Joshua SAID, "WHAT'S THAT TO US? &gt;&gt; God is more THAN ABLE. HE PUT US here in this land. &gt;&gt; How long are you GOING TO BE SLACK IN THE PROMISE OF GOD? GO TAKE the land. It's yours. &gt;&gt; And the children of Benjamin. Verse 21. &gt;&gt; The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day. Verse 27, neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bashin and her towns. My verse 30, neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nabal, and the Canaanites dwell among them, and became tributaries. Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Ako, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor Halib. Verse 33, neither did Nefali drive out the inhabitants of Bethimesh. What's going on here? The prophet went off the scene and suddenly all these people now just got slack concerning the promise of God. I want to encourage us today, brothers and sisters. Let's not get slack &gt;&gt; concerning the promise of God. &gt;&gt; Let's let's actually work towards the encouragement to put him to the test. &gt;&gt; Not to make him clown. We're not interested in signs and wonders, but what we are interested is having him as the head of our home. Having him as the head of our church, having him as the one who is leading and guiding us &gt;&gt; in every single aspect of our lives. We don't want to be like these children of Israel. They just didn't drive out all the enemy. Why didn't they do it? &gt;&gt; They just got slack. &gt;&gt; My We got most of them out of the way. It's probably going to be okay. But we know that Joshua was told, "Don't spare one of them. &gt;&gt; Don't spare one of them. A man, a woman, grandma, grandpa, children." Terrible to think about. That's the Old Testament law. Now, some people today, just for the record, because we're being recorded and streamed, some people today would say maybe they're talking about uh creating some kind of a war. A Christian is never going to go and actually harm another person. &gt;&gt; That's not going to happen. &gt;&gt; The Christian's going to get hurt by another person. That's what's going to happen. We're not talking about slaying people. We're talking about slaying devils. &gt;&gt; The devils like to get a foothold, a stronghold in the lives of people. We love people. We hate devils. &gt;&gt; That's the correction. That's the exact interpretation of what I'm saying. We're talking about a spiritual warfare, brothers and sisters. We're not dealing with human beings. We're not wrestling against flesh and blood. If we take a look at the laws of the lands now, it's it's it really is crazy when you look at it humanly speaking. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop there because I don't want to get political, even though I really do. I really really do. But I just I I'll say this. I think it's absolut Isn't it it's it's absolutely insane. It's it's mentally deranged for a man to think that he can go and actually change his gender and have all of those genetics and still compete with women in women's sport. &gt;&gt; It's because he can't make it in men's sports. &gt;&gt; It's ridiculous. It's insane. And that's not even the tip of the iceberg for what's going on. I don't want to get political and talk that way. But brothers AND SISTERS, MY POINT IS LOOK AT THE DAY IN which we're living in. We're living right between the days of Noah when men were evil in their hearts continually and the day in which it WAS IN SODOM. WE'RE CAUGHT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of that. &gt;&gt; But there is a delivering power from all that. &gt;&gt; And we don't HAVE TO BE SUBJECT to it. We love the sinner, but we hate the sin. I didn't even get into where I wanted to today, but I'm I'm just going to read this little bit here. I'll call the musicians as we as we bring it to a close. I didn't even get to read a quote today. I've got some that I really want to bring, but you know, verse chapter chapter 2 of Judges, we just read about how they just didn't they just weren't interested for whatever the reason to go and actually really do what they were commissioned to do. They weren't going to die. There was no man that could stand against them all the days of their life so long as they followed the Lord. But Judges chapter 2, an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal unto Bochim and said, I made you to go out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I swear unto your fathers, and I said, I will never break my covenant with you. the Lord speaking to them. And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land. Ye shall throw down their altars. &gt;&gt; Remember, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, I want to tell you today, if you've got an altar, if we've got an altar to anything, anything &gt;&gt; but the word of God, tear it down. &gt;&gt; Tear it down. He says, "But ye have not obeyed my voice. Why have ye done this? Why is it? Why would we keep an altar in our lives? Why would we keep something that's going to take us from the promise of God in our lives?" I want to encourage us today, brothers and sisters. If you want to see if God is real to you, just put a fleece out before him. But before you do it, don't think he's going to come and answer. You got to be willing to shred all that you think you know. &gt;&gt; Take all of those trees that you cut down from that grove. Don't save one of them so you can save a little sapling just in case God doesn't answer you. Or a seed so that you can go and actually save it, dry it out, and go and plant another grove in case God doesn't come and answer you. No, take it all and burn it. &gt;&gt; BURN IT ON THE sacrifice of the old man's life. &gt;&gt; Let that old guy die on that altar &gt;&gt; and see if God won't be God. &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me today as we close. I'll read this quote here as we close. If God be with us, then where is all the miracles? in 1961. He says, "If God remains God, lay your sinful soul on his altar and he'll touch it with the power of his word and his power and the world will be gone from you and then you'll be a new creature if he remains God." How many witnesses are there here today that he remains God? &gt;&gt; He was God of the Old Testament. He was God of the New Testament. He's the same God today, yesterday, today, and forever. And you know then down in your heart that a supernatural work has been done by a supernatural being. You cannot behave the way that you do now on your own. There's no way that you could ever do it. When you once drank and smoked AND LIED AND YOU WOMEN loved the world so much, you kept wearing your makeup a or short hair and doing other things you did. And you find out that something happens that all the devils in hell couldn't make you do it again. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Something happened. A God of miracles performed. What did he do? He changed your vile heart, &gt;&gt; changed your desires, changed your nature. That's what we're talking about today, brothers and sisters. Even though we're talking about the inhabitants of the land, our promised land today is the Holy Ghost. Don't let a devil try and talk you out of that Holy Ghost blessing in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll change your vile heart. He'll change your desires. He'll change your nature. And it has to be him that does it. Because many times people will say, "Well, I tried, but I just couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it." You never can. You never will. &gt;&gt; We never will. It's got to be him. &gt;&gt; And us dying to ourselves every day so that he can live. &gt;&gt; A supernatural word by a supernatural God made a creature of time, a human being, turn into a creature of eternity. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Took the world out of you and put Christ in you, &gt;&gt; the hope of glory and you're filled with his spirit and ready to meet him. &gt;&gt; How many here today are ready to meet him? &gt;&gt; It's never been closer, brothers and sisters. Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the many stories in the Bible, Lord. Thank you, Father, that this this Gideon, Father, he he was a victim of the circumstances, of his family traditions, oh Lord, but you still came to him. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we thank you that Lord, we can look at our lives and say that you did the same for us. You gave us the ability to hear your voice, Lord. It's not something that anybody could do except for you. And we thank you for that, Lord. Thank you that you came and took us and took out the stony heart, Lord, and gave us a heart of flesh with your spirit in it, Lord Jesus. Father, that we would have the desire to serve you. That we would have the desire to worship you. Father, we love you and we thank you today. I pray that, Lord Jesus, we all would be able to see you as the living God in our lives. Father, that our children wouldn't see a religion, but that they would see a living God. Oh heavenly father, that everyone in the assemblies around us, Father, would see a living God. That it wouldn't be some form of worship. Oh Lord Jesus, that it would truly be the great I am for today. &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you would be with those who are away today. Father, I think of the work in Lethbridge and the brothers with their shoulder to the wheel. Father, continue blessing them abundantly. Father, above all they could ask or think. Be with the saints in Lethbridge, Lord. Father, let them continually be encouraged by new growth in the assembly. Father, Lord, we're not interested in numbers, but Lord Jesus, that last predestinated seed, that is the goal. We pray that you would just continue to encourage the work in Lethbridge, Lord. Father, we pray for Brother Toby and Sister Faith, Lord, that you would just continue leading and guiding them, Lord, in their journey, Father. Lord, we just pray that Lord, you would help us, Lord, to encourage them, to be an encouragement to them, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just ask also that you would be with each and everyone, Father, who couldn't be here for whatever reason, maybe working or traveling. Keep your hand upon them, Lord Jesus. Maybe some sick in their body. Raise them up in the name of Jesus. Thank you for touching Sister Rebecca. Lord, Father, we know that you are a living God, and we're so happy that we can serve you as a living God to us now. Father, as we go our separate ways, we pray that you would just be glorified in a few songs that we sing. And Lord, that if it be your will for us to gather again on Wednesday, we'll be careful to give you all the praise. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just love you and we thank you. We ask all of these things. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The name of the Lord is a strong tower. The name of the Lord is a strong tower. The righteous run into it and they are saved.

Leading straight to the land of love, giving cheer everywhere to the sand and fill my way every day with love. Oh, fill my way every day with love. As I walk with the heavenly king, let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way in every day with love. Keep me close to the side of my savior guide. Let me never in darkness.

That's you and me, brothers and sisters. Tremendous. God's attributes were manifested to his bride this last age. Have you caught it? By the last prophet's message.
