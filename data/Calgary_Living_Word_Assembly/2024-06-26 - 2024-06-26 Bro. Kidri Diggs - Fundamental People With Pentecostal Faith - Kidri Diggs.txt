Lord that that blood atones for us in this service Lord you see the hands that are lifted to you most of all you know the hearts Lord and what's behind the lifting of the hands Lorden Lord we love you and we thank you in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray the church say amen amen amen amen praise the Lord amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to um Matthew chapter 15 if you could tweak me a little bit in the monitors give me a a little bit more volume by the grace of God Amen guess you can adjust as I get going Matthew chapter 15 start at verse one Matthew 15 And1 if you have it say amen amen the Bible says then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do the disciples transgress the the traditions of the elders for they washed not their hands when they eat bread but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the Commandments of God by your traditions for God commanded saying honor thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die to death but ye say whosoever shall say of his father father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honor not his father or mother shall be free thus have ye made the Commandment of God of none effect by your Traditions ye Hypocrites well did isas prophesy of you saying this people dwell draweth not unto me with their mouth and honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men oh my may the Lord a bless reading of his word you can have your seats amen praise God I just want to uh quote this verse of of scripture while you're sitting Hebrews chap 4: 2 the Bible says For unto us the gospel preach as well as unto them but the word preach did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it amen you know by the by the grace of God tonight uh I want to use for a subject fundamental people with Pentecostal Faith amen fundamental people with Pentecostal Faith you know and what uh and we may have heard that term used before cuz the the prophet of God he talked about it but you know I was listening to a message and it just kind of jumped out at me you know to really look at that fundamentalism and Pentecostalism and you know uh the way it's to stbe there's nothing wrong with being fundamental and there's nothing wrong with being Pentecostal by experience but then the prophet goes on to say he says in my travels I find two kind of two classes of people amen not just two kind of people two classes of people so when you think about class that means something's being taught amen talk to me Church something is being taught when you go to class when you go to math class math is being taught taught when you go to English class English is being taught so whatever that class is being whatever's being taught of that class that's what will be developed of those students amen and you know the prophet of God say I see two classes within the within the church amen how many know that the church is supposed to be [Applause] one amen and he says I see a a fundamental Church Hallelujah and I see a Pentecostal people amen and you know if we just take the term fundamental Hallelujah if we look at the Sadducees and Pharisees they were fundamental people hallelujah they were uh per se Believers in the word because they tried to live what was revealed to them amen and there's nothing wrong with living was revealed to you but our problem is is when we put a period behind it right when we are to put a Karma behind it because if you put a period behind it you never leave room for growth Hallelujah but you'll be fundamental you you you you you you'll hear the word and and you will legally try to do what's right you know you will dot your eyes and cross your tees legally like the Sadducees and Pharisees did H they wasn't just uhuh running the streets and running women and adulterers and all that stuff no church they had on cloth call for loteries with the word written all over their clothes amen and the prophet of God said that these Sadducees and Pharisees you couldn't put a finger on their life Hallelujah as far as outwardly outwardly showing sin they were fundamental Believers Hallelujah they took what Moses said and they applied it to their lives Hallelujah they took what the prophets of old said and they applied it to their life they were fundamental Believers but when Jesus came when Jesus came they were so locked up in their fundamentalism they couldn't receive the word by faith that's right amen oh my oh my because he didn't come Hallelujah the way they thought he ought to come why because they had the law they had all the dos and don'ts and the things you should do and shouldn't do amen you know in our churches we have a lot of fundamental Believers Hallelujah people can tell you what the prophet said it when he said it how he said it they can quote what church he was in what mountain he was on all of that stuff but if that's not mixed with faith it's no good you're just fundamental Hallelujah and if all you have is fundamental I'll say to you what Christ said to them when they came to Christ with their fundamental beliefs Christ said to them you are of your father the devil oh my I know I know that one was kind of sticky right there huh right so you mean to tell me you can live the law of the word live a good life have the dos and dos and all that things all that mapped out and still be amen lost amen faith is very important in our walk Hallelujah because we can't do it on our own we have to trust in God hallelujah now if we look at the Sadducees and Pharisees I mean the bible say that they honored god with their mouth and with their lips Hallelujah he said but in their hearts in they heart who they really was Hallelujah they were condemning the very word that was revealed oh my why because they couldn't Hallelujah receive it by faith and church uh if I could break it all the way back to the beginning of fundamentalism you know the prophet of God he said that Cain was a fundamental believer and so was Abel K and Abel both were fundamental Brothers they grew up in the same household per se had the same parents remember I said per se because we know the truth hallelujah Adam and Eve were there to teach these boys what they knew of God but then it came a time where they had to be more than just fundamental they had to go worship and demonstrate to God what they really believe amen and the prophet of God say what's wrong with the fundamental people is positionally they know who they are but they have no faith to demonstrate and you think about how many people we know that are in the message of the hour and they still putting it all on God sent the prophet amen when there is more there is more for us than just fundamentally reading the rest of the hour and say God did this through a prophet God did that through a prophet what is he doing through you Hall so it's all right to be fundamental people but he said Hallelujah the difference is the fundamental people know who they are Hallelujah positionally they know their position we'll come and we'll say I'm in the message of the hour you'll be identified with Ser seed you'll be identified with with with the opening of the seals you'll be identified with the Mighty God unveil Hallelujah but when it's time Hallelujah to operate in the Unseen you go back to your law because there's nothing in your life Hallelujah that will allow you like God told Abraham walk before me and be thy perfect amen and you notice in Abraham's walk he had to walk Hallelujah in a way that he couldn't control Hallelujah his journey was all a Journey of Faith Hallelujah and when you go look through the Bible most of the people God used Hallelujah they were fundamental but they also had to operate in the Unseen Hallelujah but if we just look at Hallelujah the prophet of God said he said they are fundamentally Hallelujah knowing their position yeah tonight all of us are sa we're daughters and sons of God but that won't get you in the heaven amen cuz the Baptist say the same thing fundamentally and fundamentally they're not wrong that's right because God is the author of life he created the Baptist they just dominated behind it I mean yeah they just they just turned into a denomination behind it Hallelujah you can say the same thing about Hall the Methodist Hallelujah all those who follow the Methodist Doctrine they may still have that fundamentally but God kept moving Hallelujah so you ask yourself tonight where are you are you just fundamental you got enough Grace to come to church and be identified with truth being preached amen got to be more than that church it got to be more than you just sitting in a church of Truth being preached cuz think about this and everybody that followed Jesus was following truth and it was only a few that could really believe it think about the church fundamentally Hallelujah he had people walking with him witnessing the healing of the sick the raising of the Dead the working of Miracles and all these things now I'm going Jump Ahead Hallelujah they saw all these things but when it came time for the life exactly they walked away but they were fundamental amen hallelujah Nicodemus was fundamental amen he came to Jesus a good Master we know that you're a teacher sent from God he came by night there was something inside of him agreeing with the life he saw on display the same with the Rich Young Ruler there was something inside agreed with the life we saw he said good Master what can I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus said keep the Commandments and he said I've been fundamental all my life am I in the book when I say the book I mean the Bible because fundamental people what they'll do is they separate the message in the Bible say brother bandam said this but I just don't quite see it in the Bible and the Bible says thisen I just don't quite see it in the message no there are not two classes of Revelation there's only one class of Revelation Hallelujah but if you're fundamental we was talking about this the other day at lunch Hallelujah if you're fundamental you might be a person say yeah I believe the prophet after 63 right and I'll say to you you don't believe because Jeremiah was a prophet in his mother's wool and God didn't change that I got a quote for you where the prophet of God said none of the Visions have ever I've seen have ever failed he said even the ones I've seen in my mother's womb W oh my oh my God look it up Hallelujah but Church being fundamental we got to be more than just fundamental people with a fundamental gospel that'll separate us outwardly because the Muslims got us beat sisters God bless you we love and appreciate what you do for God but I'm trying to be careful how I say this but if you stand next to a devout Muslim you will look Unholy you ever been in the air you you ever been in the airport and you standing beside that Muslim brother you look at his wife all you see is her eyes you a she going to make sure you don't get no temptation from her Hallelujah and if that's all we got fundamentalism they got us beat Hallelujah if all you can do is just say God sent the prophet you're no better than the Jehovah Witness they got us beat cuz they making their business every weekend to catch somebody at home when we don't want to open the door Hallelujah we don't want to open the door but they're faithful to what they believe they're very Hallelujah fundamental they believe that they are Jehovah's Witness Hallelujah but you know what I believe it too that I'm Jehovah's Witness but I'm going to live it by faith not just by giving out [Applause] tracks because if they don't give out them tracks they're no longer identify with what they believe amen when was the last time you gave out a track so that mean your Revelation has to be something greater catch this it has to be something greater than what you can do Hallelujah but I want to read it to you just to ease your heart a little bit ease your mind so you can make sure that this is not just Brother D coming up with this stuff yeah I study the message I believe in the message but I've get I've gotten to a place that the revelation of the hour Hallelujah has to be Vindicated in my life I think you need a little help with that I'm going help you out the revelation of the hour has to be Vindicated in our lives amen and if that's the challenge to you I'm going to make it real easy to say amen God Is A Healer God Is A Savior Jesus Christ is the word made manifest Hallelujah so we amen because we believe and we accept these things by faith no I wasn't there when he died on the cross but yet I was there by faith Hallelujah fundamentally I can't prove it fundamentally I can't be identify with the death burial and Resurrection but by faith I [Music] can hallelujah hallelujah you know what as much word that we have heard this should be easy to say every time the preacher comes out we should be amen but what we do fundamentally we fall back on our own natures and our own characters and well brother that's just not me remember it's by faith Hallelujah but if you love control you will never say Amen you're just fundamental and then you'll lean on what you can control Hallelujah which will later on turn into legalism am oh my they shout too much in that church legalism hallelujah oh my they dress a certain legalism oh my they play certain kind of music legalism which is just a form of Hallelujah fundamentalism with no faith because the person that moves into Hallelujah fundamentalism with Pentecostal Faith you say God bless that brother that shout God bless that sister that might cry Hallelujah but I'm focusing on on what God want me to do Hallelujah you don't put out your dos and don'ts and your measuring stick why because you're living by faith amen is kind of weak there's enough voices in here to make this place tremble hallelujah amen do we believe in that kind of God Church give you a testimony I was in um I was in a uh Phoenix about two weeks ago and a brother walked up to me after I finished preaching and he said Hey Brother uh uh you remember the last time you was here it's probably a year ago he said you remember the last time you was here I like yeah he said the last time you was here you were praying for me and my wife to have a child now I didn't know all the Dynamics of it I didn't know you know what the doctors had said and all these things but Hallelujah I believe that we we can lay hands on the sick and they can be healed Hallelujah fundamentally I believe that but going through it is something else hallelujah hallelujah so he says hey look at this picture I got the picture in my phone he showed me a picture of me praying for his wife Hallelujah I didn't even know he was taking a picture HJ to be honest I don't even remember praying for her Hallelujah I'm just being honest hallelujah oh my when that Pentecost of Faith meets fundamentalism the supernatural takes place because fundamental fundamentally Hallelujah brother Caron they had a word that says hallelujah you can lay hands on the secret they'll recover but they had to make a step to come and say okay now pray for me like the Bible says hallelujah and as you step do Hallelujah the word mixed with faith you'll get the results of what you believe church he said we've been praying for a child for eight years he said in one prayer God answered he's the baby right here [Applause] hallelujah I feel like doing our whist Leisa Hallelujah in the same serice another brother came up to me Hallelujah and he says Hey Brother digs have you met my wife and I was like I guess praise God sister how you doing and she could barely speak good English you know uh it was Spanish by descent and uh he said uh my wife and and before I tell his testimony you ever get discouraged hold up hold up hold up I'm going ask that one more time Hallelujah does anybody here ever get [Music] discouraged there's a reason for that because God wants to show how great he is hallelujah hallelujah the discouragement is not for us to Fall by the wayside but the discouragement is there for us to cry out unto God hallelujah so that God can vindicate Who We Are and I was a little discouraged a couple years back you know a little discouraged you know just looking on my life and finances and all these things and and preaching a long time and blah blah blah blah we all have our own personal pity parties Hallelujah and you know uh I was thinking about my testimony and I was like what good is it now that's how I felt and a sister in my church you know how you can watch a sermon on on YouTube and you can make a comment about it you know what I was thinking about my testimony just kind of useless now I've been all these years it's like you know and she sent me uh in my moment of uh distress in my moment of feeling sorry for myself she sent me a clip of me preaching and the comments and the comment and when I was preaching I made reference of how God healed me from cancer and she circled a comment from a sister who said I thank God for this message because I was just diagnosed with cancer Hallelujah and you know in the moment when you think your life is worthless or you think your life is not going the way you ought to it's really going according to God's plan church we got to step out of fundamentalism and tell the devil you are not in control God is in control Church it doesn't matter what you go through you lose your house your cars you get sick in your body relationships mess up you still have to testify that God is in control because if you don't you're saying the devil is hallelujah and I refuse to get the devil control of my life so don't I can come into church walking like this and I still say blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah oh glory to God so anyway same church come outside brother say Brother D you ever met my wife I said I don't think so and she was like God bless you he said honey tell her your testimony and she says he says brother she F your testimony and then they start to scramble in their minds on how they found it and neither one of them could remember how they came in contact with it so she was like I don't know how I got it but I got it she said but listening to it was what I needed because I was just diagnosed with a with with something on my brain Hallelujah so she listened to the testimony and she went to bed Hallelujah believing that if God did it for me he could do it for her hallelujah hallelujah see that steps out of fundamentalism Hallelujah and say God see Hallelujah stepping out of fundamentalism to say God I'm a son just like I'm a daughter just like he's a son now I need you to work see this P ACR the faith now I need you to do what you did for him for me Hallelujah see that's the person who got the checkbook and the money in the [Applause] bank cuz remember he said Hallelujah fundamentalism Hallelujah and Pentecostal people he says like one having a checkbook and no money and the other one is like having the money in no checkbook but then he said if I can ever get those two people together that's who it should [Music] [Applause] be they they they pulling real good over here that's why I can't get from the side y'all y'all got to straighten it out over here now balance this thing out Hallelujah church so she goes to bed believing what she heard she didn't read a scripture she didn't have a a a message book all she had was a testimony oh my oh my go ahead sometimes all we need is a testimony Church don't you know that's how David defeated God Goliath because of his testimony it wasn't his weapons it wasn't his strength Hallelujah it was his Pentecostal [Applause] Faith cuz fundamentally Goliath should have won but David said I'm a warrior just like you are and the day she Pentecostal Faith steps into the vision of your life and David say I'mma cut your head off and didn't even have a soul [Music] I hope you speaking those things like Abraham did that are not as though they are Hallelujah that's what fundamental people do with Pentecostal Faith they speak things into existence Hallelujah David said I'mma cut your head off didn't even have a sword but did he cut his head off what he spoke became a reality how by faith oh my I feel the supernatural presence of God hallelujah she goes to bed believing what she heard and she's wakened up with singing she looked at her phone her phone was off she's looking in the room at everything else where music could come from everything else was aome then God begin to reveal her where she was she was in the presence of angels singing right in her room because she believed Hallelujah why would Angels worship if God is not there that's their job they're obligated if angels are singing that mean God is there God is there Hallelujah prise Lord so she was awakened Hallelujah and God revealed her you're in the Pres angels are singing and worshiping and she just sat there and worshiped with them Hallelujah then she went back to the doctor and it was gone Hallelujah now I want to show you how powerful that is she didn't like the other sister she didn't even get a chance to get in a prayer line that's right amen you can believe right there in your seat and Pentecostal faith will bring what you need to your bosom Hallelujah church we are in the hour of the blending Hallelujah we should be Hallelujah recipients of the blending what blending fundamentalism and [Music] Faith don't get nervous I'm about to close hallelujah oh brother Barry Hallelujah I love a people that can create an atmosphere Hallelujah I challenge you Hallelujah to let God have your spirit in the service amen and he'll take you out of your seat and you'll realize you in Heavenly places right now Hallelujah you in Heavenly places right now God is here somebody I'm I'm challenging you to believe but if you're just fundamental you're stuck right on this just being a Wednesday night amen but if you are a part of the blending amen hallelujah there's a scripture that gives you a right to have what you ask for there's a scripture that says hallelujah wherever two or three of us gather Hallelujah wherever two or three of us gather Hallelujah Christ said I'm also in the midst Hallelujah I'm also in the midst that's a promise I challenge you to believe take your burdens to the Lord God's not done hallelujah he just want you to continue to be salty Hallelujah and he'll give you your heart's desire oh Hallelujah this ain't a time to worry this is a time to blendall we talk sicknesses too long we T doubt too long why because we're living in fundamentalism listen Hallelujah church I'm going just read a couple things so you can so you can grasp it the prophet of God said he said the trouble of it is that I found and I said the other night Hallelujah two different classes of people hallelujah one of them is fundamentalist positionally they know what they are the next is Pentecostals the fundamentalist and the Pentecostals the Pentecostals have the faith Hallelujah but they don't know who they areen oh if you that person spiritually I wish I could slap you across the head because you got faith to believe in God but then when another trial comes you start to wonder who am I why do I keep going through this I'll tell you let's settle it the reason why you keep going through it is because God is perect perfecting you it's not that you're not a son or a daughter he's just perfecting you Hallelujah so Hallelujah bring your fundamentalism along and show positionally you know who you are cuz remember Hallelujah the prophet of God said Jesus defeated the devil simply by knowing who he was he knew that there were scriptures that didn't apply to him and then there were scriptures that were or should I say things they wanted to do in the scriptures that didn't apply to Him Sister sh they say you know what they were offended at his Doctrine Hallelujah cuz he was fundamental but his life went another level Hallelujah to they couldn't see on paper they couldn't prove it by paper H you see what they ask say why they why why they don't wash their hands when they eat like they say in Trinidad stupidness stupidness they worried about them washing their [Music] hands and Jesus is basically why they got to wash their hands when Holiness is with them when righteousness is with them they don't have to wash their hands hallah because I'm with them Hallelujah the one that can make them whole and clean is with them they're eating with me they don't have to worry about these things on the outside hallelujah hallelujah oh my church when you when you look at it and you think about it Hallelujah the the the fundamentalism and you look in the Bible fundamentalism is very dangerous true right everybody all right the greatest fundamental example one of the greatest fundamental examples we have is Cain and Abel cuz the time comes where these boys got to go worship to God think about it they grew up in a house where Mom and Dad didn't wrestle with the voice of God they knew what God looked like H they can understand his presence and his touch H cuz remember when sin came in they said that he came down in the cool of day his presence and they start to run Hallelujah you couldn't fool Adam and Eve Hallelujah and those were the teachings that they these boys were raised up on Hallelujah fundamental teachings but then came a place when it said okay we've done all we could do Hallelujah sometimes you do all you can do amen The Next Step belongs to God hallelujah cuz remember Hallelujah God LED Joshua to the Jordan when the banks were at his highest why cuz he wanted to show Joshua you have the faith to speak to the banks Hallelujah you have the faith to step into the water and the water will move Hallelujah just like Moses Church did it's still the same fa Hallelujah but we so busy Hallelujah talking to the devil talking to the devil the devil is the devil that the devil is no right amen speak to the situation amen whatever's in front of you or behind you that's bothering you speak to it amen yes Hallelujah cuz fundamentally he couldn't could go forward they couldn't go sideways and Pharaoh was behind them and then they start crying they start weeping oh we going to die we supposed to die because Pharaoh is behind us and we didn't left we supposed to die fundamentally we're not strong enough Moses crying they crying God say shut up right stop all that cry and look what fundamentalism will do it'll make you lose focus in what God has already done because positionally you be like yeah I'm a child but then because you haven't tapped into the the realm of the faith yeah you didn't realize that if God did it before he can do it again Hallelujah so look there at the red SE and they crying think about it Church what they should have did was said how do we even get here to the Red Sea amen we got here because of the grace of God we got here because of the power of God God created frogs Li Hallelujah turn uh water into blood all these things Hallelujah they should have they should have got to that sea and everybody should have start praying say Lord we don't know how we here we don't know what's going to happen but we believe that's what we ought to be saying right now in the midst of our trial God I don't know why it's like this I don't know why I'm here but father I believe that you are more than able to bring me through this [Music] Tri hallelujah oh my I don't know what it is but it feels supernaturally blessed in here tonight could be because I'm here in the summertime fire is everywhere we got to do this again Hallelujah but I Church Moses he's there fundamentally he got all the stuff and God didn't move and move and move and and he should have been able to go back and reflecting what God Said fundamentally Hallelujah God told Moses stop crying in the very beginning this is the second time God telling him to stop crying in the very beginning is like Lord I can't talk I can't speak God say shut up who made your mouth right and now God's going to oh my we get stuck in Pentecost we get stuck in we get stuck in fism fun fundamentalism and God tries to raise us up to where we're supposed to be Moses is stuck on his outward approach and he can't talk and he can't do and and I don't know what to say God say shut up Moses listen to me let Aaron be your prophet and you be God maybe God is trying to elevate somebody's Fai Hallelujah stop referring to the Prophet The Prophet the prophet and you say hallelujah there would be no Prophet if there was no me [Applause] I sent to you Elijah the prophet it's because of you the revelation of the hour even [Applause] came yeah we want to be fundamental but when God is trying to take us into Who We Are amen that's the first time he told Moses be quiet stop all that crying and he's going to elevate him he say hey let Aaron be the prophet and you be God what did the message of the Hour come to do it came to [Music] restore it made our Bible a new book hallelujah it's showed us who we are and it also gave us a vision of what things will be the prophet of God say this Revelation made my Bible a new book Hallelujah where he could be in the woods and he could speak to a storm Hallelujah he could speak to a bear he could create SS Hallelujah but that wasn't just him doing it Hallelujah had wght was doing it the Woods Brothers was doing it all the people that were in contact with that Prophet Hallelujah were on the same level if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you receive a prophet's re [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Lord and Beyond the curent of time we heard all the Believers say we resting on [Applause] [Music] that I don't know about you but I was in that Vision I was one of them said amen I was in that Vision hallelujah praise God fundamental people with Pentecostal Faith but if all oh I'm running out of time but if all you got a fundamentalism oh my let me walk over here we got to Rattle we got to Rattle some feathers H amen listen if all you got is fundamentalism you can be raised in truth you can be told all the stories of God cuz no doubt Adam and Eve did that they told their boys the stories of God can you imagine Hallelujah sitting in the house of Adam and Eve and they would Hallelujah have have study or devotion with their boys and they say hallelujah that they will sit down waiting on God and God would come down faithfully and he just commune with them and talk with them Hallelujah Church they were not like us they were not confused with the voice of God Amen oh somebody could be sitting here right now in the seat of the fundamental saying oh my brother digs is really preaching it's not brother Dan I can't do nothing for you but it's spiritually Hallelujah and divinely by faith you're making a connection you're connecting with Jehovah Hallelujah think about it Church Hallelujah it was to sin came in that they started running from God but I got one even better for you hallelujah hallelujah even with their lives jacked up Sister Judah their lives all messed up Hallelujah they didn't let sin come in their lives everything Hallelujah everything was messed up Hallelujah she didn't have relations with the serpent Adam didn't receive of the same Revelation everything is all messed up they ran from God hallelujah but because of who they were Amen in God's eyes Hallelujah sin still couldn't stop them from hearing the voice of God even with the greatest sin ever created Hallelujah they still heard God calling their name so I don't care where your child may be or what they may be into if you did your job fundamentally to rais them up in the way that they should go Hallelujah now it's time to step into the Unseen now it's time to step into the Unseen and say God I did my part now I'm waiting on [Applause] [Music] you you promised me raise them up in the way that they should go and when they get all want to part I guarantee you right now if you raise them up in truth whatever they trying to do they being convicted amen I'm a witness hallelujah thank you Lord but look we spent so much time trying to point the devil out and God rebuked Moses that one time now he let him get in the same situation and he's still fundamental Hallelujah then it came out powerfully and he's in an atmosphere of unbelief be careful who you fellowship [Applause] with look here I want to challenge you for people that don't go here and when you meet up to fellowship with them they run down your church or the somebody in your church or your pastor you tell them shut up I don't want to hear it Hallelujah because I agree with what's going on my life is blessed and if your life ain't blessed why are you still here you're just fundamental right I don't want nobody to see me I ain't going to church on Wednesday nights so I'mma just come and be a hindrance if you're not looking for all that God has in the church you're going to you're wasting your [Music] time God brought Moses back around because God wanted to clinch it Hallelujah Moses crying about this and that and God elevates his faith and he says hey you be God to the people day and Moses goes down to Egypt Hallelujah with signs and wonders following Hallelujah Miracles working Hallelujah then they get to the Red Sea Hallelujah everybody crying and muming complaining God had to tell Moses again why you crying to me speak to the people and move [Music] forward did you catch that amen he didn't speak to the Sea amen he didn't say see you in my way no he spoke to the problem he said the Egyptians who you seen you shall see them no more forever then the sea started moving when he heard God speak the sea heard the Creator Hallelujah and it had to respond that's what Pentecostal Fai will do amen it a vind at your life I got to close oh my ain't he good y'all was a little slow on that one a't God good all the time you know what I kind of feel sorry for some of you because you think you're going to be all relaxed and chilling in heaven you think Heaven is going to be a place of calmness we going to be going crazy up [Applause] there and if you ain't I will be you mean to tell me all my problems are gone Hallelujah no more sickness no more struggling Hallelujah no diabetes no health problems Hallelujah and you think I ain't going to be worshiping Hallelujah ain't going to be no more bills ain't going to be no more taxes we ain't going to need no Tim hardens to stimulate us hallelujah it's going to be a continual [Applause] [Music] worship you might as well get rid of your fundamentalism right now amen your formalities and legalism amen well brother DS I'm a Canadian I guarantee you Hallelujah for those of you who love hockey it might have been the Edmonton or but you would have swallow that Pride if they would have beat the American team You' been right there wow we be we finally got one 32 years in the making yeah I know the history cuz you know what I've been doing everybody I know miles that's been a allers fan listen I say look you man Canada is the little brother and they say ah brother DS but most of the pl are Canadians I say that's cuz they really want to be Americans you ain't going to win that battle hallelujah oh my but I do that just to steal a fire amen hallelujah church one thing I want to hit before I get out of here everybody all right listen if you're just fundamental I want to show some things you're capable of just being fundamental and it'll come out when you least expect it Hallelujah God saidh the prophet God said if all God requir is fundamentalism Abel was no better than Cain if that's all was required in the worship Hallelujah Church they come to worship we know the story Abel is received Cain is rejected now God comes and he starts to say to Cain who was fundamental the prophet of God said he was a Believer he wasn't an unbeliever he was a Believer I'mma shock you for a second don't you know that Satan the Devil the dragon Lucifer is a Believer his whole life is surrounded around being who God is he's not trying to be the opposite of God he's trying to be the very thing God is he's a Believer but God won't share his glory with somebody who's trying to take his seat that's what made it iniquity because Satan wanted to replace God see God will let us be equal with him but we're not trying to replace him H his glory is hidden and revealed in us that's why we can be one with him it's just like he said when you see the wife you see the husband why because it's one Glory Hallelujah that's why Jesus would say hallelujah when you see me you see the father Hallelujah because it's not two entities it's oneall yes church but K he comes and he worship he's rejected and he's fundamental he's a Believer Hallelujah now God comes and he says to a he says to Cain where's thy brother now I'm going to show you what fundamentalism people can do they can look God's spirit right in the face and lie wow am I in the book can't gets Arrogant with God Hallelujah the ministry will preach something right down the lines of your life and you'll get upset and get Arrogant with the preacher if you're just fundamental you know one one one of one of our greatest problems is one of our greatest problems in the in the in the message in our ranks is that you have access to the same thing I'm studying right so it ain't no Miss history I can read something and you can read the same thing and God can reveal it to you just like he can reveal it to me and if you don't know where you are in the economy of God you'll try to take my place when what I'm doing is by gift not by knowledge and that's what happened to people in the church because you have the same material you have no respect for the gift I'm going show you what that's like Hallelujah God giving us Revelation and then us telling us we don't need God because it's revealed to us my the hypocrisy but look Church came he Oh my he says to God am I My Brother's Keeper he saids I don't know what happened to him and God says his blood is crying out is speaking is hollering from the ground God is saying I know what you did and K sits there and deny it all gets mad at God but this is the key fundamentalism Hallelujah will know the way and still won't go cuz he says to King if you do like your brother you'll be accepted can't walked out of his presence that's what fundamental people will do Hallelujah they'll know the way but because they don't have Pentecost of Faith to follow they will not follow same thing Judas did Hallelujah he would not go to the upper room that's right right he lied he got arrogant and he rejected the way that's what fundamental people do in the church they're sitting the church for years they don't know the doctrine of the church they don't know the quotes the message of the hour but have no hunger for the mind of God the will of God the life of God they're just satisfied sitting in the Shell but you know what an Arona not don't go through all that training to remain on Earth amen Glory Hallelujah he don't go through all that training and study the stars and the moons and the planets and all that stuff not to take a trip amen into a land or a place naturally he doesn't belong Hallelujah and God has not giving us this Revelation this word for us to remain Earth Bound in our faith so a fundamental person can know truth believe in truth truth hallelujah even say I know who I am and still won't go all the way but let's look at Abel what separated the two same house same teachings but able was willing to surrender himself to what was next am yes amen Hall look you can't control what's next Just Surrender to Hallelujah God's Will and look Church in him surrendering Hallelujah he surrendered in his worship and God took him to a place that hadn't even been revealed on Earth yet got he grabs a lamb or whatever it was and he starts to up in blood is flying everywhere in his worship what was it God was taking him to the Cross before he even died on the cross oh my that's what P cost Faith would do amen just like job in the midst of his trial fundamentally he done nothing wrong but his faith said Hallelujah I know my redeemer liveing and I will see him again [Applause] amen the Lord God give it and the Lord God taketh away that's the attitude we ought to have and everybody else around him who's fundamental is criticizing him you know the problem is we got too many eleases in the church that one of Joseph one of Joe's friends elast Joe how long are you going to hold on to your integrity for as long is in tank I don't care what you think you know all I know is God is in control and blessed be the name of the Lord listen there's so much in here so much in this I'm trying to get out but you guys are pulling h I wanted to read Matthew 8 because it shows the transition from somebody who is fundamental to having Pentecostal faith and the story is the Centurion hallelujah oh my what's the story of the Centurion he heard about Jesus and all the things that Jesus done and then he sit down and said master I want you to uh uh first he said come to my house I got somebody sick but then it click Hallelujah he said you know what I am a man of like passions as you are oh my what does Pentecost of Faith do Hallelujah it let you see Christ in [Music] [Applause] you what did his interior see he said when I say go they go when I say come they come when I say do they do now God just speak the word just speak the word and it'll suffice just speak the word and the Bible says hallelujah Jesus Hallelujah was excited about that Faith Hallelujah Jesus turned him around and he began to point them out to the whole church and he said y'all see this I've haven't seen this kind of Faith No Way in Israel God is looking for not just Believers but Believers of vision that all things are possible Gentile Faith that's what the Centurion was amen Gentile faith we keep going back cuz I want to show you you need more than just saying I'm a message believer because that's who Peter was right Peter was a good message believer he was Healing The Sick raising the Dead doing all these things walking with the Lord and then God one place he told me he said I want you to feed my sheep he said oh yes bless the Lord I will I'll preach until the day I can till the day I die yes Lord Jesus said you going to deny me three times no I ain't not me God I believe this message not me I don't care what come fundamental Hallelujah he was fundamental until a trial came that he couldn't bear what's going to get you out of those trials you can't bear what got Peter on the other side it was the Holy Ghost so what is Pentecostal Faith the Holy Ghost Pentecostal faith is the Holy Ghost because when the Holy Ghost comes all fear is gone cuz they went from being afraid on the upper room coming down after the Holy Ghost fell saying this is that what you looking at right here this is that I'm the revelation of the Cross I'm the revelation of the of the Resurrection how the revelation of repentance is revealed in me Peter say this is that I am the restoration when the Holy Ghost came it was more than just do and [Music] don't and that's why the Sadducees and Pharisees couldn't receive Christ Hallelujah cuz he made their laws look stupid they wanted to pinpoint him on this and that and it's why he down there with the Senators and Republicans easy to make people look bad and if all you got is just the separation of the eye Hallelujah you just fundamental here come Jesus Jesus comes Hallelujah breaking all they laws Hallelujah eating corn on the Sabbath day doing all kind of stuff Hallelujah and they crying you eating on the Sabbath day this that Jesus say I am the Sabbath Hallelujah well he was showing him that the things you believe in the law is just there to get you to the Holy Ghost to get you to the to the life Hallelujah Church in my closing I want to hit this one it's kind of going to repeat but I want you to catch some of these adjectives real quick he said one of the greatest curses of the Full Gospel Church is not knowing positionally hallelujah what they are in Christ Jesus I've always said I've met two classes of people one of them is the Full Gospel the other is the fundamental fundamental knows Hallelujah where he standing position only he's never been born again church and we didn't seen this this Ain a mystery we didn't seen people preachers been in the message 20 30 years and then they get a special Revelation and they G same thing the 120 did amen they walk with him until he began to speak in ways they couldn't legally prove oh what about the bridge and what about this couldn't be legally proved amen amen but we believe it by faith and I'll take it a step further I don't care if there was or wasn't a bridge because the whole job of Malachi the mo whole job of elaser was to get me to Jesus give me to Isaac that's the whole job that's right right after Rebecca met Isaac she didn't care what was going on in her father's house she didn't even care about eleasa anymore Hallelujah but you can't get rid of eler because eler is the only one who knows the way back to Abraham's house that's we got we don't need no Prophet God reveal Us in the Bible blah blah blah exactly without a prophet Hallelujah we wouldn't know the Mind Of God because the word of the Lord comes to who to the prophet now again you might want me to separate that but I ain't because the word of the Lord comes to the prophet right the word of the Lord comes to the prophet but who does the Prophet come to comes to us so we're still meeting the same God hallelujah it's just a different Veil we're still hearing the same word it's just a different Veil Hallelujah the word of the Lord comes to the prophet and the prophet comes to the people so it's still all God come on musicians I'm closing come on come on musicians musicians I'm closing listen I'm going to hit this real quick and I'm going to get out of the way he said the difference is with the fundamental people is they never get the Holy Ghost right they sit in church they know the quotes they they reading the books all that stuff but it's just law it's just dos and don'ts you know how you have those people brother murvin that sit in church and they can critique the ministry there say well well the prophet said this over here and they'll send you quotes and all kind of stuff and won't even come to church Faithfully true I want to tell you what a prophet said and you ain't got enough strength enough Faith to come sit in the sanctuary God know I I gotta work I got a job you ain't got enough Faith to ask God to bless you with a job where you can be in service you know people that don't pray like that is people that don't want to be here don't get mad at me blame it on him you always tell me and say brother be yourself and I take that literally Hallelujah we have too many fundamental people sitting in church with truth and say they believe but they're not willing to give themselves over to the vision because remember we go back to Rebecca hallelujah what made her the chosen one she was able to fulfill the vision of ela without even talking to her never met him before a day in her life but she could fulfill the vision praise God so that means Hallelujah I ain't got to go to Jeffersonville I ain't got to go to Sunset Mountain I ain't got to go to subo Canyon all I got to do is yield myself and tap into the [Applause] vision tap into the vision of the Lord am I closing Oh my he said I find two classes of people two churches two churches and I'll say this openly to brother Barry h Hallelujah right here right now if you don't have Pentecostal Faith you're another church in this church true and scripturally I hate to say it but I got to say it and scripturally there was always a church in a church true cuz you had Moses and you had the moabites right they had all the same altars and Bullocks and seven Chambers all these things hallelujah what they didn't have Vindication from God so like I said you have all the same quotes we got all these things but God never has Vindicated your life what is that Vindication the Holy Spirit until the fire comes on your altar your worship hasn't been accepted yet amen that's right Hallelujah and we're in such a a crazy time where people get upset because you preach on getting filled with the holy spirit amen he he talk about the Holy Ghost too much all he do every time he preach he preaching about the Holy Ghost I wish he tell me something else without the Holy Ghost you won't understand without the Holy Ghost it's just L to you but the Holy Ghost brings in the nature of God to be able to receive what you heard in the right channel so you should never get tired of hearing about the Holy Ghost because what is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is your reers and I say unto you if you already got it you can have another one ah that one was a challenge huh well let me ask you something how many times can a woman have a baby yeah she can have birth after birth until her body can't handle it anymore Hallelujah so what I'm saying to you church we can have experience after experience after experience rebirth after rebirth until God has fulfilled us up to what we are to be which is perfection so if you got for the whole you if you got the holy ghost look for a [Applause] refilling but the thing is we got too many people married to God on spiritual birth control Lord Lord don't touch me like that now I ain't ready don't do that I ain't I I don't want no more kids don't do that rebirth birth after birth experience after experience it don't stop with just that one time Hallelujah remember remember the prophet when he preach and I'm trying to close remember the prophet when he preached why Christ speak he said I'm a preach just because it'll nail us down he said it Nails me down Hallelujah he said I need a Revival hallelujah amen go back and read [Music] it you find yourself unhappy you find yourself in church and there's no push of joy in your life Hallelujah you need a greater experience you need to get along with God and let God rebirth you Hallelujah not saying that what you've had in the past wasn't real but now it's time for God to give you some more hallelujah amen okay we've been in church two hours can't believe it 2 hours [Music] amen I got one person all the rest of y'all I'm a I'm a close but look by the grace of God I'm going stop with this by the grace of God I know I say that by three or four times but listen I'm going finish with this by the grace of God I want you to catch this remember in your life there should be be a blending Hallelujah David had Mighty Warriors with him but it wasn't the Mighty Warriors that help him get away from Saul it was Jonathan it was his the Bible said they were close-knit so what Jonathan saw he saw himself in David if David would have got hurt he would have felt the same pain and catch this Jonathan loved David more than he loved his own father that's right and you ought to love God more than you love your whole life yeah he had Mighty me and all these things but when Saul said you know what he put out a decree he said hey we going to kill David Jonathan went back R to David my daddy setting some stuff up man he going try to kill you so I just want to let you know be prepared look [Music] out if you just fundamental you don't mind seeing people in church [Music] die don't pray about them don't ask where they at none of that stuff you just fundamental amen didn't hear the Holy Ghost oh yeah we know that listen one of them is a fundamental and the other one is Pentecostal the fundamental position you know what they are in Christ but they haven't got no faith the Pentecost received the Holy Ghost listen to this now and got plenty of faith but don't know who they [Music] are you ask the question how can you have the Holy Ghost and don't know who you [Music] are see when you get the Holy Ghost there's a yielding you must possess hallelujah it's not all about power power power no it's about a yielding [Music] he said the the P receive the Holy Ghost they got plenty of Faith but they don't know who they are if I could ever get them together like a man got money in the bank but he don't know how to write a check the other one can write the check and ain't got no money in the bank so if I could ever get them together fundamental faith and Pentecostal people or Pentecostal faith and fundamental people if we could ever get a blend he brother Barry in the ministry in the Church could ever get that bled of fundamental people with Pentecostal Faith he says the Millennium would set [Music] in glory the church would rise to his feet God would get Glory [Music] am if you in your position right could ever let the Holy Ghost lead you and then it happens to everybody else God will get glory in his place God will get Glory out of our lives he said it would usher in the millennium what are you saying brother digs in this church there be no more sickness amen ain't going to be no sickness in the Millennium in this church the power of creation would be here you can speak those things that are not as though they are Hallelujah in the Millennium Hallelujah you have power over creation because in Millennium we'll be able to walk up to a lion and say sit down [Music] trust me we de go in the Calgary Zoo and go talk to that lion and see what it [Music] do the millennial he said those two ever come to a blend Hallelujah it'll Usher in the Millennium if you would ever yield your your position to the power of the Holy Ghost what position I am a son I am a daughter now God take control of my life if you would ever yield to that it'll put you in places this flesh can't follow how many believe it amen you deserve the glory and the honor Lord I live [Music] as I bless Holy Name you deserve the glory and the H the Lord I Live come on let's open our voices let's sing it you are great are great Mir go so great great there no one else like you there is no one else like you cuz you are great so great here go so great no one El like you let's say it again there is no one else like you cuz you are great you do mirales so great like you there is no one left like you keep playing that let's bow our heads bow our heads close our eyes if there's a greater step for you maybe you haven't reached that blend yet but tonight's tonight you want to give God your all just bow your head and make your confession unto God we know the hindrances in our life we know the things that upset us hallelujah we know if we're stuck in the law but we need that Grace to just believe in the things we can't see without natural eyes God bless each and every hand that is raised each and every heart that is raised to god let's pray bow our heads Close Our Eyes Lord Jesus father we love you tonight and Lord we thank you for the word Lord God not just the letter of it but the spirit the spirit that's behind the word the word that brings forth creation the word that reminds us who we are and what we should be and Lord we receive it right now in the name of Jesus Christ we don't want to just be fundamental only but we want to have Pentecost of Faith the actions of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to believe in the things we can't control to believe that there is a God whose Eye Is on the Sparrow Lord you're in control of the bodies that are in this room tonight you're in control of every sickness every form Lord God of faith that we could give to you you could multiply it and turn it into something great so Lord we yield ourselves to you and Lord we pray you bless the people of God tonight in such a marvelous way Lord if there's anyone here tonight who hasn't been filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you're hungering and Desiring the Holy Ghost I want you to reach out in the spirit right now unto God if you need a a refreshing if you need a a a extra portion I want you to reach out to God right now and say Lord have your way in me Lord create in me a clean heart Hallelujah Lord take away all my doubts bring me out of the seat of the scornful who can just see all the wrong in people let me live a life of Grace a Life of Mercy a life led by the unction of the holy spirit with the nature of god pushing me to believe in the Unseen Lord you said in the word as Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them that could receive it so Lord we take you at that promise we take you at that word that has no expiration date and Lord the word's been preached and if the Holy Ghost has been desired in a service and if someone is hungering for it in the name of Jesus Christ receive it right now receive of him right now in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus receive it right now Lord we thank you for all that you do and all that you've done in Jesus Christ name we pray somebody say amen amen you are great Miracle so [Music] great hold on how many believe God is here so why are we not giving God our all if you know God is here if we truly believe we're in the presence of God am when it comes to worshiping you don't do what you ordinary would do you are great if you could see [Music] him if you could see the angels in this room who don't know what Redemption is who don't know what it means to worship a God that's been good Hallelujah a God that can heal Hallelujah a God that can take pain away Hallelujah Church in this moment we are to show the Angels what real Redemption is all about we are to show the angels that we worship because we believe in a god of reality come on let's open our voices and sing it one more time you are great you are great you do so great let's worship him let's worship him there's no one else like [Music] you there no one else like [Music] my I just certainly appreciate the words we heard tonight I I just think it's so beautiful because for some people we heard brother Cadre Diggs preach and for other people we heard from God and it's really that simple you know the the 10 virgins there was only one difference between them five of them had enough oil to get them through five of them needed more oil they had oil they just didn't have enough oil if we want to talk about the the new birth and the renewing and and and getting more there's more available with the Deep calls there's a deep to respond it certainly is a wonderful thing tonight there is so many things I I just want to say this brothers and sisters it's no AC ENT that we had been preaching for a long time on our positions and and you know we can talk about having the position seated in Heavenly places but if we can't be a husband to our wife are we seated there if we can't be a wife to our husband according to the word of God we've got our positions here on Earth but once we get into those positions it's so beautiful we can have all the fundamentalism there is but wait for that Pentecostal Faith to come on the scene and then brothers and sisters this is where I believe we're going to as a congregation as a body of Believers here in Calgary as the Bride of Jesus Christ receives this Revelation why cry speak the word you already know God's will it's his word he's not waiting for you to call upon him to come and do it he wants you to do it he wants me to do it she has thus saith the Lord and the mind of Christ to know what to do with that word word but then he goes further in that quote and he says but some people they don't have it and when they don't have it then they just set still and that's the way it should be but I want to encourage us I believe we heard from Heaven tonight we heard from almighty God don't cry brothers and sisters speak the word step into that vision and allow that Pentecostal Faith to come forward in your life my goodness I believe I could preach right now his spirit is here if you have a need tonight he's not in anxious hurry to leave the building if you have a need he's more than able to deliver it to you if you want the Holy Ghost be like that brother and say hey I'm not leaving this building until I receive that promise because it's for me doesn't matter about anybody else brother kadre you got me fired up brother thank you Lord for the word that you gave to us tonight can we just sing a song or two can we just worship him a little bit can we sing God is good God is good brother Joel was playing that a little bit earlier if you're walking through a valley and there's Shadows all around brothers and sisters don't don't [Music] worry he is God oh if you're walking through the valley and there are shadows all around oh do not fear he will guide you and he will keep you safe and sound he has promised to never leave you nor forsake and his word is true God is good all the time not just Sunday he puts a song of Praise In This Heart of life God is good all the time to the darkest night his light will shine God is good God is good all the time we were Sinners So Unworthy still for us he chose to die he has filled us with his holy Spirit we can stand and testify that is love is Everlasting and his Mercy they will never God is good all the time the of in this God is good all the time the dark is light his light will shine God is good God is good all the time amen let's sing The Winds of Faith as we dismiss tonight before we do let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we thank you for speaking to us Lord thank you for letting us know Lord Jesus that we could become so fundamental that we just completely ground your power Lord that we completely put ourselves in the seat of the scornful that we we make ourselves just like the the the Sadducees and the Pharisees Lord but we know that you came Lord Jesus you didn't send an angel you came yourself Lord Jesus to shatter the traditions of men and father we know that many people couldn't receive the words that were spoken they were busy trying to conform but father you gave more than just a law you gave yourself you gave your spirit Lord you broke your blood cell at Calvary so that you could come back upon your people and Lord Jesus thousands of years later you came again oh Lord and you gave your word you put it back in the hand of a prophet to deliver to your people and you reminded us of that tonight Lord Jesus we thank you for that and that was shatter the traditions of men once again that they would be able to go on from the tradition and ritual and get right into you father Lord Jesus tonight I pray that would be each and every one of ours experience here Lord that we would not remain fundamental but Lord Jesus that we would see your Pentecostal Spirit living out through US Lord that we would no longer cry but there would be something even in the weakest one of us Lord to just speak your word and and say that's your word daddy oh Father please come on the scene and deliver it father we just ask that you would keep your hand upon each one tonight Lord maybe those who are away traveling father those maybe who are here and will be traveling father we pray that you would keep your hand upon them Lord that you would restore brother kad's strength father that you would just continue to pour yourself out to him Lord and through him to your people as he travels and ministers your gospel father and Lord Jesus tonight my my final word Lord to the body and to everyone Lord is that we would go from saying Lord Jesus that our testimony is that we believe the message of the hour Lord to be able to say that we believe we are Sons and Daughters of the most high God let that be our testimony to the world when we meet them Father we love you and we thank you we just commit each life into your hands now as we go our separate ways in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen [Music] amen there are two gos you may take there's one by sight one by Fai
