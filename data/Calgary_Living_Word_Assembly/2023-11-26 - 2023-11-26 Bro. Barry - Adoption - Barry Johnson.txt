to hear from God and this morning brothers and sisters if we've come for any other reason I just hope that we would be able to change our perspective and just see that the Lord wants to speak to us we just have some requests this morning that we wanted to bring before the church and we know that many times we don't understand the way things are and and the way God allows things to happen but we know that it's for his glory because all things work together for the good to those who are called according to his purpose they don't all just work together for the good this world is not set up that way but those who are called that's a different story sister Mar olarte has a a request that she would like to bring in the form of a praise report this morning and I just so appre appreciate that so many times we come to the Lord and we have needs and we know that we've been taught the only way we're going to get what we want us to cry out for it but I believe that he likes to hear a little

just ask all these things now now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen hallelujah thank you musicians don't mind to turn with me kind of a strange Direction this morning but I just felt led to go this way so we know enough to follow the leadership of the Lord if you turn with me to Malachi chapter 3 Malachi chapter 3 verse 16 we know the Book of Malachi is the call it the bridge between the Old Testament and the New Testament and we know that Malachi was a prophet and Malachi brother Malachi had thus sayeth the Lord isn't that wonderful verse 16 of Malachi chter 3 then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it amen and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name it just gets me emotional reading this because I know I know it's about us yes and they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him Hallelujah then shall you return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not let's just bow one more time hely father we're so thankful that we can speak about you Lord and even if someday father we're we're we happen to be here and they take away our ability to speak about you your word says that that book of remembrance is written about those that think about you amen father we just pray that we could speak and think about you this morning Father that we could lift you up in our midst Lord and father that you would just take us and Lord speak to us this morning Father that you would take the words oh Father and minister to our souls as we said before let us move beyond the flesh let us move beyond our own personal spirits and Lord let us just open our souls unto you today Father that you could minister to us Lord help me to get out of the way father Lord let the speaker and the hearer become one we just Commit This service now into your hands Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just uh couple of announcements here we have a gym night coming up this Friday the details are on the church calendar have brother Papa Asam coming he'll be here on Wednesday the 29th we have brother ciz taking Sunday the 3 and we have brother mvin taking Wednesday the 6th we have quite a lineup of uh ministry here and it's just the way the way it's worked out and we just trust the Lord minister to us as we have uh as we've said already I apologize for brother ashong and his schedule but it's just beyond our control we couldn't help it um originally he was supposed to come on the 6th but uh it's just the way it works out for everyone so we trust the Lord will bless it and uh I don't know how we're GNA have brother ciz actually Carry On from where he left off because I I don't know how we can get any further in the message than where he was with it but we're certainly excited to see it and I know brother mvin he's got something on his heart that the Lord has given him so we're excited to hear that as well are you happy this morning certainly like to welcome our visitors this morning we have uh one noted brother op Sal's mother is visiting us here from Nigeria amen welcome sister and I could have it wrong forgive me if I do uh I believe sister Mario LTE has invited a friend today and is it brother veto that's the right name God bless you brother TR you [Applause] right I'm sorry I can't I just can't get in his presence and not get emotional it's just the way it is I remember hearing uh brother um I don't know if I mentioned it before greetings from Brother Paul halet and the assembly in Idaho as well as uh oh my now I'm drawing a blank I don't know why I am the minister from his assembly yes brother Dean Hart I spoke to him at length a little while ago and uh we have lined up our Easter meetings for this year I believe that he's going to come and Minister them but I remember him being here and uh he's the one brother that just said it like it is I can't I can't get up here and not get snotty it's just the way it works just the way God made me and uh you get in his presence and it's just about impossible to not get emotional Brother David Dean har is a fantastic brother he's been here many times uh more times than I recall actually he informed me but he uh he said he felt good about it and we just pray about it so uh pray about the meetings for Easter and just trust the Lord that Brother David will come this uh scripture this morning I just felt compelled to read out of Malachi chapter 3 I I just think it's wonderful than they that feared the Lord spake often one to another I believe that's what the Fellowship of the Believers is that's that's who we are that's that's what we do we can get together and talk about sports and we can talk about Phantom football and we can talk about all of the hockey and we can talk about all the things in the world the politics and and and everything that's going on in the world but you know when we start to talk about the things of the Lord that's when our fellowship really begins when we start to speak about the Lord and isn't it wonderful to know that the Lord hearkened they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened it doesn't say that it's a specific time and a specific day some other age some other place it just just as they that spake about the Lord often he wrote a book about them and and kept a remembrance of them and and you know those that that feared the Lord their names A Remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name I just it just about put me over thinking about this that even if we just think about the Lord we're getting put in a book of remembrance we have the desire to think about the Lord there's if you have that desire brothers and sisters there's something special about let's not discount that if you've got the desire to come to church if you've got the desire to press play and listen to the message if you've got the desire to go on your knees or to pick up your Bible there's something inside of you that you never put there there's something inside of you that your parents never put there there's something inside of you that God put there from before the foundation of the world that you would be predestinated in his for knowledge to have the desire to listen to the word of God to have the desire to feed upon the word to talk about the word you know last time I ministered we talked about Galatians chapter 3 and about how there's a seed and it's not seeds it's not multiple seeds and the world wants to water it down and make it as though there's multiple seeds there's many different ways it's like a a GPS you could go anywhere in the world and you could just type in heaven and you want to find the way to get get there and you can take many different Avenues and and many different highways and many different byways and you can still get to heaven if you just follow the the way that's provided for you but you know that's not the way God intended for us I apologize this is driving me a little bit Bonkers this morning but we know it's the devil you know there's not many ways to get to heaven there's only one way that we're going to make it to Heaven there's only one way one truth and one life and that's to follow the word of God for our day that's to follow the word of God for your day for any day for any age they had an opportunity to actually come and follow the word but the only way you can do that is if you're a seed Not seeds in Galatians chapter 3 we read this verse 16 now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ now many times we can put that off I believe and say well that was Christ there were speaking about that seed that righteous seed that would come that would be conceived in a virgin and and and we know that brother bradam talked about it how it was neither a man and neither a woman it was God it wasn't the the the the germ and the Egg coming together of of human beings it was all God we know that's what brother Bram said but then we could maybe look at it and say well it's to Christ at the end of that verse it says and to thy seed which is is Christ but I want to say if you have Christ in you who are you whose seed are you you're not your own seed we're not just Mom and Dad's seed that came together and and and suddenly now we have the ability to believe this word we were in Christ before the foundation of the world it's a genetic code that can never be broken brothers and sisters and today where I want to go I just felt led to go here is adoption talking about adoption and understanding what it means and trying to encourage just to recognize there's a few key points in there that really I think could help us along our way amen hallelujah they they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it I just want to mention that word feared here it's not feared with afraid I I was I was afraid that God was going to come and find me one day so I ran and hid I I was afraid so I I I ran and and and did everything I could in my life to go as far as I could to the ends of the Earth to get away from God I I was afraid so I tried to do something to get away from him no not at all this wasn't the fear that Adam had in the Garden of Eden when God came around and said Adam Where Art Thou God knew exactly where Adam was but Adam he knew where he was but he had a desire to hide himself from the face of God when he came around this isn't the fear that we're talking about this is reverence this is the people that are willing to say Amen to the word the people that are willing to subject themselves to the word for their day and say maybe I don't understand it maybe personally I don't know according to the traditions and and maybe my my family I just can't really get past it but you know what I'm willing to do is just trust the Lord that he'll reveal it to me in my time in his time you know there's only only one form of life in this world in this universe there's only one form of life I've often thought before I got saved that there was many forms of life and sure we can look at the the the world and and and the scientific theories that there would be of all of the different forms of life from you know the the lowest of of life form a mitochondria or something that would be microscopic all the way up to a human being we could say there's all these different life forms and sure enough there is living on the planet Earth but you know in this universe there's only one form of life and that's God's own life that's Zoey that's eternal life there's only one form of life and all life comes from God man would like to think that he creates life but all life comes from God there's only one seed brothers and sisters that can live eternally and that seed is God we could say God's seed but if it's God's seed then it's a piece of God it's a part of God it's not some other seed it's not some other thing that's just changed into a a a a a new seed and and that's kind of I guess the direction that I feel led to go today brothers and sisters even though we become a new creature in Christ Jesus in our bodies we actually don't become a a new Christ we are the same Christ that was yesterday today and forever now it's almost getting heretical sound like a heretic talking like this but brothers and sisters if you got the Holy Ghost in you who are you we'll keep saying that you're not going to be you plus God it's not going to be God plus you when the true baptism of the Holy Spirit hits a person when the whole Holy Spirit takes over a person you become a new creature in Christ Jesus you actually become Christ manifest to the world Amen and it becomes it becomes a little bit out there I know it can be very difficult to actually really grasp but aren't you glad the chapter 4 of Malachi said behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord when is The Great and Dreadful day of the Lord whenever that is God promised through Malachi his Prophet that he's going to send a prophet true yes amen he promised that he would send a prophet with thus sayith the Lord and and I just think it's beautiful because he says it in in in in personal tense if that's the right way to say that I don't even know but he says behold I yes won't send them behold I will send you Elijah the prophet and some people can say Amen to that and other people maybe scratch their head and think wow how who's you and who's I I I don't know all these these pronouns but I believe it just becomes personal when we can get the baptism of the Holy Spirit it becomes a new book to us amen and that's really what it's all about we say it every single time you know the only way we're going to get the holy spirit is to repent get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins and then we shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that is the promise and and that's what's going to get us into the Rapture that's what's going to get us out of the graveyard should we go by the way of the Grave we know brother Ram tells this story about the life insurance salesman saying would you like to get some life insurance do you have any life insurance brother brandom says yeah I I've got I've got Assurance I have assurance and it takes a little bit for them to get past that but he says you know life insurance will actually get me in the grave it will put me in the graveyard but life assurance will get me out and that's what we're talking about today brothers and sisters is not just getting a financial payout even though that's good for our families here on Earth should the Lord decide to take us home but we want that Blessed assurance that Jesus is mine and once we get that it's a foretaste of Glory Divine talking about adoption sometimes I believe it can sound like it's it's going to happen someday doesn't it adoption it's a process it's a an event and we know brother Bram talks about how a son or a daughter uh takes the biblical type of the son who comes to a full maturity he's been under the T tutorship of a a teacher and and gets very well instructed and comes to the place where the tutor can can go back to the father with the report and say you know answer all the questions the father might have and and and we know that the tutor can say yep to every single question that gets asked he can say yes indeed he's followed all of the instructions and now it's time to take him and actually adopt him it's not like we're just taking someone who is an orphan in the world who whose parents we don't even really know where they came from or what their background is and just making them our child no this is a child that was that child before the foundation of the world this is a child that's been very carefully looked after and watched over over the years and it's been under careful leadership and training and now now that child is coming to full maturity and what happens when you became adopted in the Biblical times in that culture it meant that your word was the same as the father's word the father no longer had to speak basically he just handed over the business to the child and and the child the son was now in complete control and you know that's interesting that that Elijah that we spoke about behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he would preach a series called adoption brothers and sisters this adoption series isn't just about something that's going to happen somewhere out there I I was thinking about it and you know sometimes it can sound like it's going to happen someday but for those people that don't know what about today what about right now brothers and sisters what about full adoption for the Sons and Daughters of God because if we come to that place Satan ain't going to have anywhere to go he's not going to have one foothold in our lives and I personally think that's that's a great place to be isn't it isn't that going to be somewhere want to be fully adopted Sons and Daughters of God not having to worry about Satan not having to worry about all of his Antics and his tactics and and the problems that come around you know there's so many diseases in this world that that that he uses to come against us to come against us as human beings but we've been given power we've been given authority over every single one of those diseases and he wants us to believe that was only for Elijah the prophet that came and went now he's gone so nobody has the power to stand up to Satan I want to say to you brothers and sisters you have all the power of Heaven standing behind you in your prayers you don't have to have a great evangelist you don't have to go and make a pilgrimage somewhere to find a Ministry to pray for you you can pray and you know brothers and sisters I want to encourage each one of us to come to the place to recognize that it should be us able to pray that way because if we can't pray that way then we're not fully adopted Sons and Daughters of God but if we can come to the place where we say Daddy I know I can't do anything on my own it's completely up to you and I just want to take your word and remind you of your word you said that by those 39 Stripes I am healed that's what you said am so I want to remind you of that Amen brother random talks about adoption in the messages adoption I'm going to jump around through the messages of adoption this morning and I hope it's okay but brother random says it in the book of uh in in in the messages adoption sorry um that Ephesians the book of Ephesians perfectly parallels the Book of Joshua and we we talked about this at length a while ago and maybe a few years ago now but I I just felt led to go this way so here we are today talking about the book of Ephesians perfectly paralleling the Book of Joshua and you know when when you hear something like that it just for me it really draws my attention it makes me think well what on Earth does the book of Ephesians say and you know what does the Book of Joshua say so like I said years ago we we we studied this maybe not that long ago a couple years but uh the Book of Joshua maybe turn over there with me the the first chapter of Joshua I think it it's just important to maybe just have a basis sort of for where we we go about this knowing that the book of remembrance is actually being written right now amen the book of remembrance is being written right now not about just what we say but about what we think remember the prophet of God said that our thoughts our thoughts are louder in heaven than our words here on Earth Joshua chapter 1 we know this is the the prophet that was in the land Moses Joshua 1 verse one now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore rise up go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coasts I just think this is beautiful verse five says there shall not be any man not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee amen be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withersoever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then shalt thou have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withersoever thou goest and we know right after that the very next verse Joshua commands the people he says Hey I've heard from God this is what God's told me now get ready and isn't it interesting because God never came down and spoke this to the whole Congregation of Israel no he came and spoke this to one man and it was up to the people to decide whether they should believe that man or not but there were some people in the land that had the ability to do that and you know it's no different today brothers and sisters this is the same God that came down and spoke to the children of Israel through a prophet came down and spoke to the children his children in this age through a prophet yes but you know what it takes is to be strong and very courageous that's right amen we cannot just be weak we can't be fearful we can't be afraid we can't say well you know what we prayed for brother so and so or sister so and so and nothing changed in their life we've got to be willing to take the steps forward and say you know what the word of God is yay and amen this is our absolute and it's up to him yes to bring it to pass it's not up to us to bring it to pass we can't pray God to change his mind if we do that we're doing it wrong we need to trust God with all of our hearts and lean not to our own understanding if we start leaning to our own understanding we're going to make a mess we're going to get in the way we're going to start to actually use our carnal thoughts our carnal thinking and that's where Satan's going to get in and that's why I say brothers and sisters when we get together when we go on our knees even when we listen to the message of the hour we got to go beyond this flesh we got to go beyond even our spirit we've got to go into that Soul realm and ask God God to speak to us and he will so you know talking about how Ephesians parallels the Book of Joshua in in the message's adoption brother bradam talks about this very clearly and and quite extensively how the Book of Joshua was how the children of Israel were instructed by God to walk across the Jordan River to move into that promised land that was promised all of their forefathers for for what was it 450 50 years maybe or longer the promise was there the land was there but it wasn't the right time but when that time came God sent them a prophet to say rise up everyone take note now it's time to move over into that promised land and we know that that that's exactly what happened and there were some people that were able to go and some people only wanted to go halfway and we know that they were judged for their willingness to go halfway and and we're not going to get into that today I don't want to go too far with that but we know that the Lord said to them you can come and you can have it the way you want it if that's what you want but you've got to make sure that you fight for your brothers and your sisters so that they can get into their position and I just think it's so beautiful because some people will only ever be able to come so far and that's just the way it is but other people are going to go all the way into that land and you know what alls we need to do is make sure that we block for our brother and our sister brother brandom says it when God gives the ball to someone why would you want to tackle that person block for that guy let him run let him get a touchdown and your team wins but he talks about the children of Israel in verse N Out of Joshua chapter 2 I it's such a good description brothers and sisters if we could just be able to zoom out of this natural realm and zoom into the supernatural realm into the spiritual realm and see really how Satan views us really how the inhabitants of this Promised Land the the the ones maybe not the inhabitants of the promised land of the Holy Ghost but the ones who want to block us from getting there how they see us this is the story of Rahab in you know verse 9 of Joshua chapter 2 and she said unto the men the spies were there with her and she said to them the men I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that your terror is Fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint Because of You Yes I want to say it this morning loud and clear brothers and sisters the Devils faint because of you don't think that the Devils can mount up and actually Be tendous Giants in your way and and stomp on you like an ant that's not the way it is at all they're very afraid but they're boasting they're Liars they're trying to present themselves as Giants boasting in the land but there's got to be someone like David to say where are we going to actually make a change in our lives why are we tolerating this giant in the valley of our promis land he has no right to be in that land who's going to rise up and go down and take him out in the name of the Lord for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you oh yes sometimes I think when we look at this scripture brothers and sisters we need a book of Remembrance in our lives how many times has the Lord dried up the Red Sea for you how many times has he actually stopped the Waters of the Jordan River for you how many times has he shaken the foundations of the walls of Jericho for you oh my sometimes we need to go back and we need to look at those maybe we need to post them on our fridge or on our mirror in the morning and when the Devil comes around to make his F we need to say no don't you remember where you were defeated in the name of the Lord that was for me amen sometimes we need to remember brothers and sisters make a book of remembrance yes when you came out of Egypt and what ye did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side Jordan sihon and OG whom ye utterly destroyed did they utterly destroy them they went over and they marched but God did all the work God destroyed all of the enemy in the land all they had to do was put themselves in position and be fully willing to do what the Lord said and he did it for him verse 11 and as soon as we had heard these things our heart did melt and neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you right so just think about this brothers and sisters neither did there remain any more courage in any devil Because of You Hallelujah because for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and in Earth beneath and isn't it true that the scripture says that the devil believes the scripture and trembles so when you get the word of God in your heart and the word of God comes out of your heart and goes on your lips it's not just you speaking brothers and sisters because it's not your word it's his word and his word is quick and powerful and you know that word quick sometimes we can say quick oh it's quick but that's not what it's saying it's life it brings life and Satan brings death so when you bring life to Satan he's got to flee it's like turning on the light Darkness flees from Light Brothers and Sisters light doesn't flee from Darkness shine a light on the devil and see what happens speak the word of God that's the age we live under brothers and sisters we're not looking for tremendous healing lines we're not looking for discernments we're looking at speaking the word and taking our inheritance being adopted Sons and Daughters of God knowing exactly where we stand knowing exactly all about it knowing exactly who we are you know Paul teaches Paul teaches in adoption that this isn't for everyone I I never really heard it this way I've just been studying this the whole series just going over it and over it and over he says this isn't for everyone it's not for everyone and and and I think it's astounding when we look at it that way but it's not for everyone the idea adoption not everyone can be adopted Sons and Daughters of God unfortunately but for those people that are if you have the ability to be an adopted son or daughter of God brothers and sisters you know it I know you know it and you know how you I know that you know it is because you keep getting up we keep getting up the devil will come around and try and knock us down and make us feel like we're beat and and we'll never be able to survive but you know there's something on the inside of the inside that says I can't quit there's no quit in me because the word of God says that everywhere the soul of my foot will tread in the promised land belongs to me so every single promise that's in the word of God pertains to you brothers and sisters pertains to me we don't have to be afraid brother bamy says this in in in the message and I didn't give it to you brother so I don't know if you'll be able to bring it up quickly but um he says now the first thing Paul starts out here I think it's an adoption too sorry Isaac really putting them on the spot now the first thing Paul starts out here to tell the people is to get all the remember this is to the church not to The Outsider it's a mystery in riddles to him never able to understand goes over the top of his head he does no more does no no more about it than nothing but to the church I want to say to the bride to the church the bride it's Honey in the Rock it's joy unspeakable it's the Blessed Assurance amen so that was out of adoption number two we've got um a few more that I did give to the the brothers I don't know if you find the email there the other thing that Paul sets out to to just establish in in in the adoption series is this notion that we can be saved today and lost tomorrow and that's a real good one that's a real good one brothers and sisters just because we struggle it doesn't mean you're lost right you're struggling because Satan wants to actually make you feel like you're lost but if you weren't struggling it would mean that there's nothing in you to actually save amen but boy oh boy when you're struggling it means that Satan knows there's something about you he knows there's something that God has in store for you and he's going to try and get us to believe that somehow we can't be saved oh because of what we've done we need to get that notion out of our heads and recognize there's nothing we could ever do to be saved except for believe it and the only way we can believe it is because he gave us his Spirit to do so so all we have to do is say Amen to the word I don't understand it I I can't make it happen but I believe it the idea the notion brother Bram says it just like this I'm not bringing up the quote he says it just like this that that notion that you can be saved today and lost tomorrow is utter nonsense right that's a denominational teaching that's the devil I want to say it this way now someone might get really upset with me but I want to say that's a trinitarian Doctrine to think that there's something that you're going to be able to do to Merit your salvation amen if you're truly the Son and Daughter of God that he's come to adopt you can never be lost the you only thing that's going to happen happen is you're going to recognize your daddy you're going to recognize God Almighty as your savior and something is going to change in your heart you can't be lost tomorrow and saved today you can't be lost today and saved tomorrow even though you could if you are but if that happens to you then you'll be saved forever amen we didn't just get saved one day we just recognized that we were always saved because we're a part of God and we can't be lost because he can't lose one part of himself remember there's only one form of life there's only one form of eternal life and that's where we get into a real interesting Doctrine that's that's part of the of the trinitarian group I would say that there is an eternal hell there's no eternal hell the word of God says that they they fry forever and ever they'll burn forever and ever with unquenchable heat but brother bradam the prophet that elah that we talked about in in Malachi chter 3 he said you know what it's a space of time forever and ever and you can't die forever because that would mean there's no eternal life if there's Eternal death we know that Eternal death is is a lie there's only one form of life and that's God's life that's eternal life and you can't have eternal life and actually go into the Lake of Fire forever and ever doesn't happen Satan wants us to think well you will oh yeah you will no you won't isn't it wonderful to think that we have a God that that is so kind and so longsuffering so wonderful that would come around and tell us that I love you that that I actually want to give you a love letter and and let you know that you're not going to be slapped around I'm not an abusive husband I'm not going to talk down to you I'm not going to belittle you with my speech I'm not going to let my anger get a hold of me and actually smack you around with my words I'm not going to grab you physically and slap you around with with my strength I'm going to tell you that I love you and that under no circumstances will I ever do anything to hurt you and that I'll do absolutely everything that I can to show you that I love you and to tell you over and over and over and over that I love you I love you I love you I just want you to love me amen you can't be saved today and lost tomorrow brothers and sisters that's a lie of the devil so if you have that feeling it's the same thing as being afraid yeah if you're afraid it's a devil right I want to say that fear this morning is a disease right just like anger is a disease but isn't this the same Lord that we're talking about that said I have healed all of your diseases not just some of them not just most of them not just maybe some of the really big ones and some of the really small ones but there's just always going to be these other ones in the middle no he said all of them brothers and sisters Hallelujah he's come to heal all of our diseases if we've got anger in our lives if we've got fear in our lives those are devils trying to tap dance on your inheritance push him back tell them that the word of God says that everywhere the soul of my foot treads in this word belongs to me this is my inheritance because Elijah did come and and he did have thus sayith the Lord to tell me that I can't be saved today and lost tomorrow that if I'm saved today I'm saved till eternity I'm saved until the day of my Redemption because we're not just saved we're sealed he says he goes on to say that when he says it's utter nonsense to think that you're going to actually be saved today and lost tomorrow you're sealed you're not just saved you're actually sealed and nobody can take off that seal we know that if if Justin Trudeau puts a seal on something and sends it out nobody's going to mess or tamper with that seal and if they do they're going to have severe consequences same thing with President Biden or Vladimir Putin or any of these really important people around the world nobody can mess with their seal think about the king of kings and Lord of lords seal nobody can tamper with that seal brothers and sisters no devil no person no denomination no nothing can tamper with that seal you know when we become adopted Sons and Daughters of God when when we actually get Beyond fear when we go into the place where maybe we just don't understand it that's exactly where he wants us to be and you know that's where we become kind and that's where we become soft that's where we become Christian which is Christlike amen not judg J mental and hard and and always contrary and always looking for some sort of critical angle and something about something no we become soft and loving because we recognize the only reason we're here is because he called us hallelujah we're as frail as frail can be we're we're we're naked we know the word of God says that all things are naked before him we can't hide nothing in our hearts that's why we need to know exactly where we stand amen something happens to us when we become adopted Sons and Daughters of God out of adoption three brother Bram he says this adoption placing positionally my this is where we got into talking about our positions as husbands and wives and children brothers and sisters adoption placing positionally got that there where they at show me where they're at God calling his children aside by what by manifestation amen they don't have to say one word about it you see Something's Happened positionally placing his son and I want to say this brothers and sisters it's not about being positionally placed in a church even though it is 100% it's not we're not talking about that today we're talking about getting into Christ we're talking about being positionally placed in Christ if we do that first if you seek first the kingdom of God then everything else will work its way out everything else will settle down and we won't have to worry positionally placing his son getting him into order just exactly with the same things he's just as in much Authority his word words just as good as an archangel can you believe that Hallelujah his word that son that's positionally placed that's adopted his son is just as good as an archangel better he says the son was adopted put on a high place set out there changed his robes changed his colors the father had a ceremony said this is my sonen from hence forth he's Governor he's the ruler he's over all my Heritage all that I got belongs to him that's right did you ever wonder this brothers and sisters I'm getting ahead of myself going to preach this sometime and maybe we will we probably will did you ever wonder why Joseph was given that robe of Many Colors did you ever wonder that I know we know the story very well but I want to say this I I believe the Lord show showing me that Joseph was adopted by his dad Joseph was given the adoption ceremony now now some might say well brother Barry think about how he was he was just a young boy and he had to go and get thrown into the pit and then he had to get sold into slavery and go into poner house and be accused and go to jail and all the stuff that happened in Joseph's life what does brother bradam say an adoption God's going to allow the devil to come around and kick you he's going to allow him to throw you out of the church he's going to allow your wife to come against you he's going to allow all these different things to happen to you just so you can show who you are if you truly are an adopted son or daughter of God and I'm getting way ahead of myself here but that's talking about the tutor he gives the little the little the little example of what the tutor and the father talk about and how the father says you know have you been dealing with my son is he in a good spot and the tutor says yeah you know I I I've done everything to him I I've let Satan come around and kick him hard and kick him out and kick him up and kick him down and all these different things and I'm just paraphrasing here but I've let him do all these different things and he just won't quit he just keeps saying praise the Lord he just keeps going to church he just keeps reading his Bible he just keeps praising the Lord he just can't stop saying Amen to the word there's something about that son or that daughter and the father said yeah that's my boy that that's a chip right off the old BL and then he goes to say imagine if that father had to hear the words oh my I've given him trials and he just gets mad and he just runs away and he just won't listen and I just can't deal with the boy brothers and sisters Sons and Daughters of God will never resist the spirit of God there will come a day and you know what I want to say it this way don't look at the time present because if we do that if we look at Joseph's life present and say well Joseph because he was adopted he should have had the cloak and got the signant and he should have gone from getting the cloak of Many Colors to going to Pharaoh right no that's not the way it works is it we've got some ground to prove who we are we've got some trials and some tribulations to go through but that's the only way that we've been created is to prove who we are through trials and tribulations don't doubt that he wasn't adopted he was prophetic and his daddy saw it and we'll get into it in the message later on I'm sure not today but someday I think it's just beautiful how even though he was adopted this adoption that we're talking about he went through great trial oh my goodness could you imagine what it would be like to be going out to see your brothers your daddy told you go see your brothers and bring me a report take them some food make some provision show them that I love them and bring me the good report you can go back and see how all his brothers came on the scene a and it wasn't a a Bed of Roses brothers and sisters the 12 tribes of Israel didn't come easy right but this one son goes out to give a report and what does his brothers do they say oh here comes that dreamer again let's get him once and for all let's put him away from us because all he does is upsets our program all he does is harp on the trinitarian doctrine but let's do something about him once and for all and we know that there was one brother that stood up for him we know Reuben is the one that stepped into the breach to say hey let's not kill him let's just throw him in the pit and we know that that wasn't Reuben he was acting on behalf of God you know the story we know the story I'm going off on a tangent here but it's just wonderful if you're going through a fiery trial brothers and sisters count it better than gold in your life oh my I say Lord help me because I know where this goes when we talk like this something's going to happen but you know what it's only going to happen to bring the glory of God out in my life all we're going to be able to do is look back and say look at that time he delivered me from that look at how he brought us through that you know many times the trials that we go through are great heartaches but you know I want to say this and it's sometimes easier said than done when the going gets tough what happens do the tough just run away no they dig in and they get going the tough don't give up now maybe that's just a worldly carnal example and maybe forgive me if you feel that's the way it is but I just truly believe that's the way it is because when we've got the spirit of God we're not afraid we're not worried we're not concerned that it's out of control because we know who's in control and when we get concerned and upset and worried and a fearful nature takes over us in a situation we're showing God that we don't believe he's in control brothers and sisters show them he's in control tell them he's in control let him know that you know he's in control he wants to know that he wants to hear that conf confession on our lips yes my goodness out of adoption number two I think it's so beautiful and the possession that the promise that was given to the church is not a natural land just want to take the time to talk on these things and see what the Lord will do maybe we'll have another service about this I just believe adoption is so so vital brothers and sisters it's excuse me it's really our promise it's really what it's all about this is the message of the hour it's not just being a part of a membership or an association or a group of people if we can say God sent a prophet and quote quotes and have books and it's not about that it's understanding that there's a possession we've been given a promise brother brandham says and the possession that the promise was given to the church is not a natural land but a spirit ual land for we are a royal priesthood a holy nation then in this royal priesthood holy nation peculiar people called out elected chosen set aside then all the world is dead on the outside amen and we are led by the spirit amen Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God not by man but by the spirit amen I just think it's so good the more we fall in love with God the more that we fall in love with Christ the more we fall out of love with the world because the word of God says that if you love the world or the things of the world what it's not even in you my goodness not for an adopted son or daughter of God though I'm not saying that to make us afraid to think that one day it could just slip away no no no no no I'm I'm saying it I'm saying all this to help us identify that the true Sons and Daughters of God have got real real tangible identifiers in their lives so we're not wondering we're not questioning but I just think it's amazing this one floored me when it came to the message of the hour that brother bradam he he made it real clear that it's not works of righteousness it's by his grace alone amen amen it's not by having a great prayer line it's not by having tremendous prayers answered it's not by seeing all Mighty signs and wonders that's not it at all it's our ability to actually say Amen to the word and not just say Amen in church even though you should it's living it it's taking this message of the hour and saying it's my absolute because the message of the hour amplifies the Bible it's like taking a guitar I don't even play it but I know what happen happens if you take a guitar and play it it sounds good I'm sure especially if you could play it but if you plug it into an amplifier and you turn the volume up brothers and sisters it does something doesn't it the Brandon goes on to say all in love the whole thing is bundled up now this has been tried to be taught on many times and no doubt what great theologians has struck it a lot deeper than I could bring but the thing I want to try to get to you is this that a man that is in Christ with the Holy Ghost can bear with a man when he's wrong amen wow you know sometimes you see it that a man is in Christ without the Holy Ghost and he just can't bear with that man he just can't bear with a man even if he's wrong especially if he's wrong but you get a man who's in Christ who has the Holy Ghost he's going to bear with a man even when he's wrong and trust God to turn the tide trust God to change the situation amen that man he's going to be longsuffering he's going to be gentle he's going to be patient he's going to be sweet he's going to be humble he's going to be faithful he's going to be filled with the spirit never NE negative always positive he's a different person there is identifiers in those truly elected Sons and Daughters of God it's not like we can just say hey I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them even though we can when we know who we are but there's a life that lives out through US amen this isn't just something that you think about right we know that this is the word of God we'll get into it I think it's beautiful here but when someone is longsuffering that is an action right when you're longsuffering it's an action when you're gentle it's an action when you're patient it's an action when you're sweet all of these things humble faithful filled with the spirit never negative always positive we're demonstrating actions in our lives we're showing the Life of Christ to the world around us and I just want to say it this way I'll plug it in there don't just save it for the the people outside of your home don't save it for the people outside of your home let that life exude your home that's where it counts the most brothers and sisters out of adoption number three brother bradam says you notice that sins a sinner is not a sin what a sinner is not a sinner he does not commit sins are you serious a sinner is not a sinner he does not commit sins wow but the church commits sins is he getting this right yes when I was listening to this when I was studying this and reading this I had to go back and just pause here and think what's what but the church chur commits sins does wrong gets a wrong thought wrong impression make Scruples brothers and sisters don't get the wrong impression the word of God says that if there's a to go to your brother that's the devil he wants to get in and get us to have thoughts he wants to get us to have the wrong impression of something he wants to get us to have Scruples and and wobble a bit but isn't it interesting to see how God sees us here he's talking about God viewing us the church gets the wrong impression makes Scruples wobbles like a little child walking learning how to walk he just don't know how to walk good yet yeah because he's a little boy but we have a hand that reaches down oh my it's not wonderful to think we're all just Sons and Daughters of God just trying to learn to walk we're in a one room Schoolhouse and some people are already uh past the stratosphere spiritually speaking and some people are still in the womb right it's not up to us to say anything about anyone it is up to us to actually demonstrate the life that we're talking about in the message of the hour and that is to extend that hand of Fellowship to say if someone's in the ditch we're going to pull them out we're not going to judge someone we're not going to form an opinion because we can see they're scrupled up we're going to say to them brother just get up dust yourself off keep going he just don't know how to walk good yet cuz he's a little boy but we have a hand that reaches down if we gets us and steadies us and say make this step a way make this a step away my son doesn't pick us up and spank us because we made a mistake isn't that wonderful yes amen that makes me think how dare we think that we could pick someone up and give them a spanking right our brothers and our sisters because I'm a spiritual giant oh my I can see this I can discern this in your life I need to actually take you aside and tell you all about it how you can be more spiritual and and better with your life are you serious that's not the way God treats us now remember the story about the man who was forgiven the tremendous debt that humongous Deb multi-millions of dollars worth of debt he was forgiven by the king but then that dude once he was all forgiven he got all puffed up with pride and said man I'm good aren't I oh yeah God's forgiven me and my business is good and my family is good and my church is everything is under my control I'm so full of Pride and I'm going to go and collect from that one guy that's been messing me over for years remember that what happened he was taken before the king the story got back to the king to say hey didn't I forgive you didn't I forgive you like multiple times way more than this dude but now because you've been that way I'm sorry but you're going to have your punishment and we know that it's actually it switches from being a natural example to being a spiritual example he'll be cast out where there's wailing and nashing of teeth right that's what will happen to him you know we don't want to ever ever think that we can judge a brother or a sister what we want to do is pray for a brother or a sister and we want to encourage a brother or a sister if we're a spiritual giant especially am I think it's so beautiful though we could just go a long long long long ways we know that the disciples they stopped the children when they came at Jesus I just love this don't you love the word of God how he used the examples the children wanted to be touched by Jesus people wanted Jesus to touch the children and the disciples got in the away the religious ones and said no no no keep them down they're going to get something maybe they'll get jam on his his Ro Rob or something from their peanut butter and jam sandwich you know they just make a mess of him don't let them go and Bug the master and he said no no no no suffer the children to come unto me because unless you come as one of these ones you won't even see the Kingdom of Heaven think about the prayers of the children brothers and sisters isn't it wonderful we can say ignorance is bliss they don't know about all the different things they don't know about all the different hurts they don't know about all the different problems and all the situations that have happened or the things that could potentially happen out there they're just children I say Lord let us just be children let us just be children and and reach for that hand hold to God's unchanging hand if we can do that then we will actually see a difference in our lives he says he doesn't pick us up and spank us because we make a mistake he doesn't beat us to death because we're trying to walk he loves us like we love our children amen he loves us like we love our children a real daddy wouldn't whip his child if he's trying to walk if he falls down on the floor reach right down with big strong hand and pick him up take both hands a hold of him say this is the way to do it son Walk This Way pick them up and dust them off say I love you you're doing such a good job keep going son that's the God we serve this is the prophet for our day telling us this is how God sees us to me it makes me feel good to know that just because I have a struggle just because I have a trial just because I feel like I fell down it doesn't mean that I've lost doesn't mean that I can't come back it means that he loves me and he's allowing the Devil to come around and straighten out these things in my life we have the ability to Rejoice brothers and sisters he goes on to say that's the way God does his church reaches down and gets him in his arm picks him up and say walk like this son here don't don't say it like that talk like this you ever have that happen speaking and suddenly something happens it happens to me all the time when I'm standing up here but we have it happen sometimes in our lives we'll say something and something will say you shouldn't have said that shouldn't have said it that way right and we got to do something about it at that point forgive me Lord forgive me brother forgive me sister maybe we need to actually go around the long way go and have a coffee and it gets a little uncomfortable and we got to go and see a brother and a sister and you know maybe say to them hey I'm so sorry but I've said these things about you behind your back and I I know maybe you know or maybe you don't know but I know that I said them and I know they were wrong and I just pray that you'd forgive me because that's what the word of God says and you know brothers and sisters unless we do that all that we do we talked about this years ago is we just take that sin and we just take it and we put it in our backpack and you know many times we'll say oh I've I've asked God to forgive me for that sin I talk to my brother about my brother and my sister and you know this thing has happened and it's terrible and I I've I've I've slayed them but I've asked God to forgive me so it's all good it's okay God's forgiven me what did God say to the the the brother that came with his sacrifice Jesus he told him hey just leave your leave your offering right here leave your gift right here at the altar and go and make it right with your brother and your sister and then come back and your offering will be accepted and we know that's the same thing that Cain was offered if you would just do like your brother have we got the ability to get Beyond ourselves to get past ourselves enough to go and do that that's not an easy thing to do I say Lord help me Bram says here don't don't say like that talk like this now I don't care what the church says what this says what that says you say it like like this like this this is it if my word preaches it you stay right with it walk with it stay right with it don't care what everybody else says stay right with it walk like this this is the way to make your steps and I just can't help but think that's why we come to church that's why we we spend time in prayer that's why we read the word of God because we want have that instruction from him that's how he speaks to us that's his chosen way we know it's by Revelation and we we've talked about it and we'll continue on with it I'm sure but I think sometimes it can actually almost be a bit overwhelming to think that the I I just think the saturation of Revelation in this day brothers and sisters you know what I'm saying how much revelation we have in our day if you talk to some of the oldtimers and and they talk about the way the message of the hour was back when maybe the seventh seal was preached brother brandom said to them do you understand it and a lot of the people say yeah and we know that Billy Paul he asked him one time after a service do you understand it yeah and what did he say did you understand that Billy Paul yeah and he said brother Billy Paul did you understand that and he said no no Daddy because it wasn't for them but think about it brothers and sisters it's for you yes it's for me it's for us to have the revelation being an adopted son and daughter of God we can have Satan powerless before us if we're willing to come according to the direction we've been given who doesn't want Satan to be powerless before you today I believe every one of us wants to go out and tread on the heads of serpents to know that you have absolute Authority when you speak it's not you speaking it's God speaking through you I just want to say it if you have the Holy Ghost In You brothers and sisters don't put that off to another day got the Holy Ghost in you speak the word and go forwards and don't be afraid because everywhere the soul of your foot Treads is your possession in adoption number three brother Bram he says by Revelation it's by Revelation brothers and sisters it's all by Revelation that's where I was talking about how it can just almost seem like a a saturation of it and and sometimes we say it so many times it can it can almost just be overwhelming to think about Revelation because the prophet said that we can never overemphasize the importance of Revelation because truly that's God speaking to his children directly that's God speaking to his wife directly when when something happens through Revelation to us and we say I got this idea I got this thought I got this thing in my heart and I just don't understand it if you take it back to the word of God and it resonates if this word of God flashes like the Yum Thum in in the in the Old Testament then you can rest assured that's God speaking directly to your heart brothers and sisters and I would say this I would encourage you to keep doing what you're doing because God is speaking to you directly that Revelation is what we're after because that revelation will never be contrary to the word of God and when you hear someone come up with a revelation that's contrary to the word of God you got to say God bless you I I I I believe that maybe God spoke to you somehow but I just don't understand it but that doesn't mean that you're not my brother doesn't mean that you're not my sister I just don't see it in the word of God so I'm going to pray that maybe either you'll change your ways or that I'll be able to see it in the word of God but I'm not going to slander you Paul said over here I can show you in the scripture that he said he had to forget everything that he ever learned and counted as nothing that he might know Christ oh he says neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me but I went to Arabia and turned again to Damascus Paul went out into the Wilderness he had to actually go in the book of Hebrews brother Bram this Hebrew study it's so beautiful he goes in there and he says that Paul had to go and verify the experience by the word he didn't take a man's reasoning for it he had had to go into Arabia by himself and have a conversation with god sometimes I think we just need to get away we just need to steal away and have some time with God so he can speak to us he goes on to say neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me but I went to Arabia and turned again to Damascus and after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with him 15 days it's a beautiful story that part of the story goes on as as we read on we find out that he and the Apostle Peter never seen one another in life did you ever think about that they had never seen each other in this in this world but what happened was they got together and they were preaching the very same gospel how were they doing that Revelation by the spirit and that's the thing with the Believers today brothers and sisters we could go anywhere in the world and connect with Believers Believers of this word for our day and it's just like we are brothers and sisters and we go way back before the foundation of the world we have a connection that goes even stronger even even is different than kin even we we can't even explain it it's a supernatural connection he says as we read on we find out that he and the Apostle Peter never seen one another in life never knowed one another never seen one another but when they come together they were preaching the same gospel God's got a school see and that school brothers and sisters is Revel by the spirit it's got to be the person in Christ with the Holy Ghost not just the person in Christ claiming Christ Jesus it's got to be the person in Christ Jesus with the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Spirit and what happens is you become an adopted son and daughter of God don't think that you're getting a fiery trial because you're not an adopted son and daughter of God think that you are an adopted son and daughter of God if you've got a fiery trial there's a reason why we go and get thrown into the pit there's reason why we get sold into slavery there's a reason why we've got to go to prison and be falsely accused because we are adopted Sons and Daughters of God not because we're going to be because we are already you know we need to close here soon boy don't you just love the word of God Amen Oh my bring it God manifests himself in adoption number three God trying to place his church Church in position to manifest himself I I I just got into that I heard that and again I was like my God trying to place his church into position I always thought it was so that he could have a Rapture I always thought it was so that we we were going to you know be that glorious Church Without a spot a wrinkle and I think all of that is true yeah but to hear the words of the Prophet sometimes and to hear what he's saying God trying to place his church in position to manif EST himself he's not looking to manifest himself somewhere out there I'm just saying it slowly like that just to let it sink just to let it saturate us with that that Revelation his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this say there's my spirit flowing freely there it is that I can work here get another one over here and place him I can place him adoption adopting placing manifesting that's where I want to end up today brothers and sisters is manifesting there's the adoption process there's the positionally placing process but then there's the manifestation of the spirit and you know what that's the true identification if we truly are an adopted son and daughter of God if we truly are a spiritual Giant and we are in that position we've been in the message our whole entire lives and we've never had any sin in our lives and we're strong Christians if we're that way then we're going to have a manifestation of his spirit in our lives and it's not going to be our lips it's going to be the life we live Amen to those people around us and those people around us are going to be the ones that bear witness that yep there's something different about that person there's something that just lines up with the word of God they are gentle they are sweet they are humble they they they know that they're placed and they're manifesting brother bam says to take him out here and put a ceremony on him visit him with an an angel have you been visited by an Angel I should call the musicians tell him something now if he's told the truth now if he's just making up something it won't work nah that won't work we've had a lot of that but I mean manifestations of sons of God when God manifests himself and sends him out then he Goes Forth and what he says is truth what he does is the truth what he does he manifests Christ how you judge him this is the critical Factor this is the critical Factor brothers and sisters how do you judge him by the way he stays with the word amen right with the word see and and what word we could say the word of God which is true but we know that we've had an amplification of the word of God in our day we've had a Prophet come on the scene to take us right back to the truth to give us the ability to see between the lines to recognize that just a a baptism in the name of of of a title and a name of another title and the name of another title that's not going to Merit us gift the true gift of the Holy Ghost we got a prophet in our day that gave us the correct formula of water baptism and that's why this message is so contested right because it comes against that trinitarian Doctrine but I just love it how the prophet said it and I'll say it just what he said show me anywhere in the Bible that they baptize in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost and we'll put a name on on our backs and say that we believe a false prophet show us in the Bible don't show us according to a theological study somewhere what what a certificate from a a a seminary teaching gave us show us in the word of God right amen amen but what does what what he does is truth what he does is he manifests Christ Sons and Daughters of God adopted Sons and Daughters of God they they manifest Christ it's not them one day and Christ another day it's the solid stalwart individual that's the same person how do you judge him though by the way he stays with the word right with the word see we can be up and we can be down maybe stand with me as we close we can bounce all around Satan's going to come around and say don't you remember you got a temper you got a temper buddy you like to get mad you like to punch things you like to kick things you like to throw things you like to act this certain way maybe you like to look at these these things maybe you like to drink these things we need a prayer that will take those drinks out of our lives like we heard about last week but you know Satan's going to come around and try and remind us of who we used to be but I want to say this brothers and sisters you never were that don't let Satan lie to you amen because you never were whatever the LIE is he's trying to give you you are always yes Son of God you are always a daughter of God and you don't have to listen to the devil what identifies you how will he judge you by the way you stay with the word he says right with the word see that's how you know all men is by the way he stays with the word if they speak not according to the word there's no life in them says the Bible see leave them away we have identification brothers and sisters we said it earlier but we're closing now it's not a membership card or an association it's not a not a not a not a membership Galatians 5 says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness and goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit I love this part brothers and sisters because it's easy for us to live in the spirit but if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit if we live in the spirit and we talk about the Spirit a and maybe we quote about the spirit and we present the spirit this is who we are let's live it let's walk in the spirit let's demonstrate to this world around us this is who we are because talk is cheap the world's going to recognize us right away who we are and it's going to be the spirits that are in the other people they're going to say oh my we can't swear around this brother we better apologize without saying a word you don't say a word to them and they just know it how do they know it because the spirit that's inside of you beareth witness his Spirit beareth witness with ours that we are the sons of God if we live in the spirit brothers and sisters let us also walk in that Spirit let's just bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus this morning we thank you for your goodness for your Tender Mercies to us Lord yes Lord to each one of us Lord recognizing that outside of your grace not one of us would be
