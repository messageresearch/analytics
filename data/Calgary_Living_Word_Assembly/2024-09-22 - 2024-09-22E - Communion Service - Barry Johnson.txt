had prepared before the foundation of the world for us in this age as we've already heard tonight Lord to come and be your disciples to come according to your instruction Lord not according to our interpretation but according to your instruction father to partake of you to discern your body and Lord Jesus we thank you for this opportunity thank you for the desire that you've placed in our hearts Lord father we pray for those who couldn't come tonight Lord for whatever the reason wherever they are we pray that you would sovereignly be with them Father that you would bear them up on the wings of an eagle that you would strengthen and encourage each one tonight father Lord Jesus we pray that if there's anyone who has a need a special need tonight father that you would just sovereignly meet that need as well you've created us to be needy so that we would come to you that we would bring all of our burdens father many times we're heavy laden but we know that you said that your yoke is easy yes Lord father and that you would give us rest we pray tonight father that you would just have the preeminence that you desire in every aspect of this service father we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight thank you musicians if you have your Bibles tonight I'd just like to read scripture and just have a a small exhortation I don't want to take a lot of time tonight I know it can be a long service so I'll try not to keep you long if you turn with me to John chapter 6 John chapter 6 is where Jesus began to explain to the people who he really was and we know that they could not receive his explanation because they were looking at it truly through a a natural circumstance John chapter 6 verse 26 Jesus answered them and said verily verily I say unto you you seek me not because ye saw the Miracles but because ye did eat of the Loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto to you not a man not a Ministry but the son of man shall give unto you for him hath the God the Father sealed then they said unto him what shall we do that we might might what shall we do that we might work the works of God Jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath sent they said therefore unto him what sign showest thou then that we may see and believe thee what doest thou work what Dost thou work our fathers did eat Mana in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread excuse me and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life am he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst amen let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word thank you Lord that you came down and you showed us father the true bread of life am and thank you Lord that you gave us the work that we should do father it's not by works of righteousness but by your grace alone father and we accept it the way that you've given it to us father and we just ask now that you would bless the words that are spoken tonight bless each one father for their desire to come onto your table tonight we love you and we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I just think it's such a a wonderful time to get together for the communion service it's something that is very sacred and we know the disciples had the opportunity of being there and the world today makes a mockery of this and we know that it's not even the world so much as the devil that does it and we're just certainly thankful that we have been given ears to hear what the spirit says unto the church talking about our scripture tonight Jesus talking to the religious folks and his disciples just the whole group who was standing around and trying to be partakers of what's going on the the meetings that were at hand and Jesus begins to explain to them that I am the bread of life amen and you think that Moses gave you the bread in the wilderness but I'm here to tell you that it had nothing to do with Moses it had everything to do with My Father which is in heaven and he's the one that actually sent me to declare him to you and as you partake of what I bring to you you will be able to actually have eternal life verse 36 of John chapter 6 but I said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out these people must have been thinking at this time about this time who is this guy he's making himself sound like he's got some kind of authority that he has some sort of special placement in the kingdom of God but we know what they said just a little bit further on isn't this Joseph's son how could he be declaring these words to us that he came down from heaven who is this guy how dare he make himself equal with God it's just beautiful the way he did it though because I I I know we're probably very familiar with it I'm not going to read the quote tonight but I just want to throw this part in there is that when he started to talk this way to the people is when he started to declare that I am my father are one and that's when they picked up stones to kill him amen but this man he actually wasn't declaring anything other than what he was and that's what got them so riled up they could not they could not stand it that he would dare have such a Blasphemous statement that I and my father are one but here we have not Jesus as a different person as a second person or a third person of the Trinity we have God himself amen manifest In the Flesh speaking to the most religious folks of the day as well as his disciples and we know that 70 of these people they just couldn't stand it they just couldn't stand it they had to walk away because of what he says a little further on here I just want to read this just for the setting the background here verse 37 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me will I in no wise cast out for I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which hath sent me that all that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day isn't that beautiful he didn't come down to punish people he came down to raise people up at the last day am that's his words and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day but the Jews then murmured at him because he said I am the bread which came down from heaven and they said is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith I come down from heaven and here we have Jesus God In the Flesh manifesting before them Jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not amongst yourselves can you imagine what that must have been for them they would have been like wow he's hearing us how does he know what what we're saying because murmuring isn't coming right out and saying it it's saying it around behind someone's back right in 44 he says no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day wow who raises anyone up except for God we heard that this morning verse 45 it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath looked learned of the father cometh unto me amen not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father amen verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life amen and now he doesn't back away from these statements he actually leans into them he begins to present them more I am the bread of life let's go back and talk about your fathers in the Wilderness your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead and we know the prophet in our day he wasn't talking about them passing on going to being buried in the cemetery with their fathers with their families he wasn't referring to that at all he was referring to the Eternal separation being eternally separated from God because they didn't have faith in their hearts to mix with the word that was given to them by the prophet to receive that word your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world so he's talking about the word the word yes and he talking about his flesh this flesh we all have this flesh the flesh had to perish his flesh was perfect he was the sinless one he was the only one without sin even when they put him under examination they could find no fault in him so what did they do they brought false accusations against him and that's the only way they were able to actually persecute him to death but what happens is here he is now saying that you know there is the word of God God and that is the meat that is the flesh that you need to eat it's the words that I bring but they had no way to actually separate what he was saying from the natural circumstances aren't you thankful tonight to be able to get the inner teacher to be able to get the Holy Ghost someone that would lead you and guide you into all truth that we would look at this word and be able to just understand that he was talking about the word he wasn't talking about the flesh but he knew exactly what he was doing he had to stir the them up amen he had to get them excited a bit so that they would actually persecute him to death and it was exactly the way that it needed to be he didn't force them to do anything right they acted as free will agents and that's what made him the sacrifice for all of us I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the true tment that blood cell that was broken on Calvary 52 the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth My Flesh drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father hath sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is the bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever amen that would have been a a very stunning statement that he made that service there would have shocked every single person that would have been there and we know I got a couple of quotes here we'll quickly go through but the prophet said you know they they just didn't know what to do with them they didn't know what to do with them I I'll just read these next few verses here bring the quotes and then we'll just carry on with the service here these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernium many therefore of his disciples when they heard this they said this is a hard saying who can hear it who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you what and if ye shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth amen the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen and he told them that some of them couldn't couldn't handle it some of them couldn't believe it we know that Jesus said to them blessed are your eyes for they see the things of God a and many people were not able to understand not even able to understand and truly probably had Hearts where they really wanted to they really wanted to try and understand but there's sometimes things in our lives that we're just not willing to give up on and we know Nicodemus was an example of that he was one that went and sought him privily after dark so nobody would know and he was the one that said to him we know Master we know that the things you're doing is only of God no one else could do these things except for God himself right we got to be willing to set aside our own thinking our own understanding am and just say hey I don't really understand it but I just believe the word and that's all out of the Seal of God in 1954 Josephus a famous Christian historian he said those ible type people who have been eating the body of this Jesus of Nazareth said they hid his body away and they've been eating of it they was eating the communion said that they them Bunch back there them Heretics that's what they were those people that were eating the flesh nobody took the body of Jesus and started eating it starting cutting parts of his body and started eating it we know that's the devil trying to spin this and make it something that it's not he he spoke about the bread of life and and it's about taking the word we know that he said that man shall not live by bread alone but by what by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God these were the historians that should have known these words but uh they were more interested in their tradition they were more interested in the way they've always done things and that it should be done the way that it was and and truly they were rounding a corner and it's beautiful to think you know we had a prophet in our day say you know what he's not building a wall it's not just going straight he's actually making a corner and you got to follow the blueprint we're building a three-dimensional house here we're building the Tabernacle of the most high God we need to be able to not be stuck in Tradition and not stuck in our ways so much that we don't follow the word for our day and let go of all the things we heard our brother pray about it earlier tonight we need to forget about our lives forget about our years forget about our Ambitions and recognize tonight we're here to discern the Lord's body and where is the Lord's body brothers and sisters we can have the bread this is this is this is bread that was made and we have the wine and we know those represent things but that's not his body that that's in remembrance of today he has a body and it is the bride body it's our brothers and our sisters and we we wash one another's feet whose feet are we washing brothers and sisters M the voice of the sign 1964 brother Bram he says now we notice that that in the great hour he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man drink his blood could you imagine what people thought is this man out of his mind remember the Jews they were given the Ten Commandments they were given the laws of Moses they were given very specific instructions and when it came to a dead person they weren't allowed to go near it that's right if they touched a dead body they had to go and actually cleanse it wasn't a simple thing to just go and and and and come across someone who is dead to to deal with someone else's body if they had leprosy they had Specific Instructions for it there was the law Moses gave the law God gave Moses Moses gave the law we know how it went but for these people to now hear this man who is sounding a little bit like a heretic a IC around them to be saying you got to eat my flesh and drink my blood that is that is beyond imaginable but that's what he said and you know he said it for a purpose brother Bram told us he said it because he needed to thin out the people he needed to thin out the herds he needed to get down to the place where he could really deal with the individuals that were called am and that's exactly what he's doing today now we notice that in that in that in that great hour he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man drink his blood could you imagine what people thought is that man out of his mind does he want us all to turn Cannibal and now perhaps he'll go out somewhere and kill himself and we're supposed to eat his flesh and drink his blood see they never understood it and we know there's many many spins that were put on his death some people brother Bram talks about it I think it's in the rapture that he drank man Drake weed they gave it to him and and what he did was it put him to sleep for a few days and then he he came awake again and then ran up into India somewhere and died I I don't think that's actually what happened is it it was St Thomas that brought the gospel one of the 12 that was actually there one of those guys he's the one that brought the gospel to India it wasn't Jesus that went up there to die Jesus actually his flesh he laid it down as the sacrifice in Palestine that's where it happened but could you imagine what people thought is this man out of his mind does he want us to all turn Cannibal and now perhaps he'll go out somewhere and kill himself and we're supposed to eat his flesh and drink his blood that's exactly what this Josephus said they must be eating his flesh we know that they weren't willing to accept the supernatural circumstances around the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ we know the centurions they fell on their face when that angel of the Lord came and broke that seal on that tomb and rolled the stone away and said now he's risen he has risen he is no longer in this grave and what happened was the leaders the religious leaders of the day they weren't ready to let go of this Theory because they didn't want to have anything to do they were caught now between the people and they were caught between Rome they didn't want an uprising so what did they say they got they paid off these these guards to say that he actually just escaped and he ran off somewhere he his disciples took him they they they took him away and nobody knows what happened to him but surely to goodness he couldn't have risen from the dead everybody wants to put their own spin on it the devil especially wants to put his own spin on it but we know as Believers we've been given the ability to partake of this body to eat this flesh and drink this blood and we know the flesh is the word and the blood is the wine the actual life that he gives us by eating the word as we eat the word we become the word and I just want to encourage us tonight to never ever be afraid of the communion table brothers and sisters this is the instruction that the lord gave us amen you know brother bradam he says it in the church age book never let anything come between you and that word and when this is an instruction of the Lord to do this this isn't something that is just a really nice ordinance of the church that's put out there and you know you can do it once in a while if you feel up to it this is an instruction of the Lord and one of the reasons for it is we can't have any guidance in our hearts we can't do this we can't come before this table because to do it it actually means that we're going to eat and drink damnation to ourselves that's why we need to take a moment and T one for another to make sure that if we've got anything in our heart that the Lord will forgive us for it but what do we feel like when we leave this communion service every single I don't think I've ever left a communion service and felt bad anybody here ever felt bad after leaving a communion service it doesn't happen does it it because happy are ye if you do these things and I'll tell you for sure 100% by experience unhappy are you if you don't when you know to do it and you don't do it it doesn't make you happy yes works is Faith expressed our works determine who we are our works show who we are works is Faith expressed 1965 except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood he didn't explain it he didn't go to him and say well now this is the word and this is the wine and this is the blood and D D D D D D D he wanted to actually thin it out I think it's amazing how he says this he didn't explain it he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you shocking to them why I imagine some doctors and nurses said that's fellows a vampire trying to get us to drink his blood see they didn't understand it and he knowed it but them disciples them disciples this is what got me a little bit excited when I heard brother Frank praying them disciples there's the disciples back there but then there's the disciples right here them disciples they might not have been able to explain it but they sat there and believed it anyhow amen for it was revealed to them yes sir they know it the scriptures had declared it amen so I just want to say tonight brothers and sisters God bless you because them disciples they didn't understand it they couldn't explain it but they just believed it and that's the that's the commission for us today is not necessarily to understand it all but just believe it and you know as we believe it as we eat it we become it and that is really what's happening that's what it's all about tonight I just want to change the order of the service now and go into the communion service if you will turn with me in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians 12 maybe stand to your feet as we read this as we change the order of the service if we could sing number 430 marvelous Grace for the communion 1 Corinthians chap 12 actually 11 um we say 12 1 Corinthians 11: 23 it says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do sh the Lord's death till he come amen wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body amen for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world Hallelujah wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come I think it's so beautiful this is what we do here brothers and sisters if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world and that's why we come here so that we can be chasen of the Lord chastening of this flesh is no good nobody likes it but it shows whose side we're on it shows who our father is when we're willing to come in subjection to this word it shows that we love him amen let's just take a moment or two and T one for another gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we thank you for your goodness yes Lord we thank you for your Tender Mercies to each and every one of us Lord we thank you Father that you came you
