[50:27] here or whether they're virtual
[50:29] somewhere else father maybe watching
[50:31] this later on Father we pray that you
[50:33] would just be with them just the same
[50:35] Lord and father tonight as a as an
[50:38] assembly here we just want to stand
[50:40] together United around these two
[50:42] unspoken requests father Lord knowing
[50:45] that you are more than able sometimes
[50:47] things can look impossible but father we
[50:49] know that that's what you specialize in
[50:51] Lord Jesus and we just commit the needs
[50:54] into your hands father For Your Glory
[50:57] tonight we just want to ask Lord that
[50:59] one more time you would let us walk with
[51:01] you father not that you would just walk
[51:03] with us but father that we could walk
[51:05] with you Lord Jesus that you would lead
[51:07] us tonight oh Father in the cool of the
[51:10] evening in this building here that
[51:11] you've given us Lord Jesus one more time
[51:14] father according to your will we just
[51:17] ask all these things now in Jesus
[51:19] Christ's name we pray amen amen thank
[51:23] you very much
[51:25] musicians if you have your Bibles
[51:26] tonight I'd like to carry on with the
[51:28] study and the exposition of the seven
[51:30] Church ages
[51:32] amen Revelations chapter
[51:35] 2 unto the angel of the church in
[51:38] pergamus it's Revelations chap
[51:47] 2:12 Revelations
[51:50] 2:12 it says unto the angel of the
[51:53] church in pergamus write these things
[51:56] say sayith he which hath a sharp sword
[51:59] with two edges I Know Thy works and
[52:02] where thou dwellest even where Satan's
[52:04] seat is and thou holdest fast my name
[52:09] and Hast not denied my faith even in
[52:11] those days where in Antipas was my
[52:14] faithful martyr who was slain among you
[52:17] where Satan
[52:18] dwelleth but I have a few things against
[52:21] thee because thou Hast there them that
[52:24] hold the doctrine of balum
[52:27] who taught baac to cast a stumbling
[52:29] block before the children of Israel to
[52:32] eat things sacrificed unto idols and to
[52:34] commit
[52:36] fornication so hast thou also them that
[52:39] hold the doctrine of the
[52:41] nicians which thing I hate repent or
[52:46] else I will come unto thee quickly and
[52:48] will fight against them with the sword
[52:50] of my mouth he that hath an ear let him
[52:54] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[52:56] churches am to him that overcometh will
[52:59] I give to eat of the Hidden mana and
[53:02] will give him a white stone and in the
[53:04] stone a new name written which no man
[53:08] knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen
[53:12] let's just bow one more time Heavenly
[53:14] Father Lord Jesus tonight we just thank
[53:16] you for this word we know that Lord you
[53:20] said to this age that each and every
[53:22] Church age
[53:24] applies father and there's not one
[53:26] Church Church age that doesn't apply
[53:27] they all culminate in the seventh Church
[53:29] age and Lord we know that father we're
[53:32] coming out of the seventh Church age and
[53:35] Lord some people are even all the way
[53:37] out of it even now tonight Lord and
[53:39] father we just thank you for this and we
[53:41] pray that Lord Jesus these would not be
[53:44] words that are vainly spoken that these
[53:46] would not be words that are vainly heard
[53:49] but father each one of us would take
[53:50] these words and consider them Father
[53:53] because we know that the time is short
[53:56] we just invite you now father to have
[53:58] the preeminence in every aspect of our
[54:00] service tonight for your glory in Jesus
[54:03] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[54:06] tonight you may be seated certainly
[54:08] thankful to be back it's uh certainly
[54:12] wonderful for the Lord's traveling
[54:13] mercies last week at this time we were
[54:16] anticipating flying to Ohio and we did
[54:18] that and the lord gave us a wonderful
[54:21] time and brought us back and we're just
[54:23] certainly thankful for the opportunity
[54:26] to be here again just a few
[54:28] announcements before we get going
[54:30] tonight we just have the potluck this
[54:31] Sunday we know uh my wife sent out the
[54:34] text this afternoon just reminding
[54:36] everyone uh so we can make arrangements
[54:38] for who's going to be there and how much
[54:40] food to have um so that'll be a
[54:43] wonderful time of Fellowship hopefully
[54:45] it won't be too hot for us pray for a
[54:47] little bit of rain maybe Saturday night
[54:49] and even Sunday morning it would sure be
[54:51] nice but we'll just trust the Lord for
[54:53] it um we have a brother coming here on
[54:56] July 31st I had the the opportunity to
[54:59] meet him a year and a half ago and uh
[55:01] he's just a wonderful brother who lives
[55:02] in Quebec and uh he's a minister and he
[55:06] was very well affiliated with the voice
[55:08] of God Recordings and uh I don't know if
[55:11] he's as Affiliated now but I think
[55:14] that's irrelevant because that doesn't
[55:15] make someone a Christian or not what
[55:18] that does is shows that they have a very
[55:20] good understanding of the message of the
[55:21] hour and uh his name is brother Joel
[55:24] Gant and uh he's just a wonderful
[55:26] brother I uh I got to take him up to
[55:29] Edmonton from Calgary here and so we had
[55:31] lots of time to fellowship and anyways
[55:34] he's going to come here he's going to
[55:35] take the service for us on the 31st of
[55:37] July and uh on August the 4th we're
[55:40] going to be away I was going to be away
[55:43] two weekends in a row there but I just
[55:45] don't think that's going to work um so
[55:48] I'm going to forego the special services
[55:51] in Edmonton which is kind of sad but
[55:53] it's the way it works I need to be at my
[55:55] post of Duty um we have a family event
[55:57] that uh we're going to attend in
[55:59] Saskatchewan on August the 4th so
[56:02] brother Jos is agreed to take the
[56:05] service for us on August the 4th in our
[56:07] stead and then uh you
[56:11] know it was uh kind of surprising
[56:14] tonight I was just considering this
[56:15] we're just about exactly one month away
[56:18] from uh brother Andrew Glover being here
[56:21] towards the end of
[56:23] August which means uh summer is I don't
[56:26] know half over just about it's pretty
[56:29] amazing in our time how quickly time
[56:31] goes by but we have brother Andrew
[56:33] Glover here for uh August 16th 17th and
[56:36] 18th we're going to have three services
[56:38] we did two last time and it was just too
[56:40] good to not have three this time so
[56:43] we're going to do that and uh see what
[56:46] happens and I as I understand uh we we
[56:49] we picked this at probably a difficult
[56:51] time I'm going to try and adjust that
[56:53] for next year so that we can have
[56:55] brother Paul and sister Elaine here year
[56:56] they go away for their anniversary and
[56:58] um I just didn't really think about that
[57:00] when we booked brother Andrew last year
[57:02] but we'll try and try and maybe bump it
[57:04] ahead or bring it back a little bit
[57:06] we'll see what brother Andrew's schedule
[57:07] has to say and uh we'll go from there so
[57:11] uh God bless you tonight I just wanted
[57:12] to say a thank you to everyone for all
[57:14] of your prayers for traveling mercies to
[57:16] and from Ohio uh we had no hiccups in
[57:19] terms of flights um the only thing that
[57:22] was a little bit frustrating was we
[57:24] brought carryon luggage we did not want
[57:26] to check our bags because we potentially
[57:28] could lose the bags I've had some not
[57:30] good experiences with that so we did
[57:31] that and when we got to the gate on the
[57:33] second flight they said everyone from
[57:34] this point Beyond in the lineup has to
[57:37] now check their bag at the gate so we
[57:40] were like wow guess it's the Lord's will
[57:43] but you know it's the way it works if
[57:45] that's as bad as it gets it's pretty
[57:47] good we didn't have any issues and uh
[57:49] you know the the prayers for traveling
[57:51] mercies were certainly answered and uh
[57:53] the prayers specifically for the
[57:56] blessings in the service there it was
[57:57] incredible to hear some of the
[57:59] testimonies and uh you know I I I can
[58:02] tell you that I was a bit nervous going
[58:04] to preach for uh I would say a general
[58:07] like Brother Ray um sitting in the front
[58:09] row and brother Wayne Lawson sitting
[58:11] right beside him and his grandson
[58:13] brother Nathan Ericson sitting right
[58:15] beside him and you know I I would say
[58:17] these are all probably real preachers
[58:19] and I I hardly feel like that but you
[58:22] know the Lord was gracious there was one
[58:25] sister that said in the first five words
[58:27] that that brother Barry spoke God
[58:30] answered her need and I don't know what
[58:31] the need was I don't really even know
[58:33] what I said but it was the Lord speaking
[58:36] clearly because uh it just you know
[58:38] there was just testimony after testimony
[58:40] the Lord was really good to us and the
[58:42] fellowship that we had was just
[58:44] tremendous and to top it all off I got
[58:46] to go fishing so that was incredible it
[58:48] was just a wonderful time and well
[58:50] overdue so I I really want to thank
[58:53] everyone for your prayers and your
[58:54] support the brothers that took the
[58:56] services brother Emanuel brother Toby
[58:59] just tremendous Services thank you
[59:00] Brothers isn't it wonderful to have
[59:02] brothers that just love the Lord
[59:09] absolutely to know that we're we're
[59:12] we're pulling for the same goal there's
[59:14] not a a jostling for some other
[59:17] direction and some other thing it we're
[59:20] fighting the same enemy it's just a
[59:22] tremendous thing and you know uh brother
[59:24] Toby he he he mentioned that uh maybe
[59:27] the pastor could get inspired by
[59:29] something that was said and I'll tell
[59:31] you what I'm inspired by what was said
[59:34] and uh you know many people will think
[59:36] that brother what brother Toby talked
[59:38] about was a Sunday school lesson for the
[59:39] children and and when they start getting
[59:41] married and start thinking about
[59:42] marriage and stuff I want to say hey you
[59:44] know what he was talking about was
[59:46] marriage for adults that was Sunday
[59:47] school for the married people that
[59:50] wasn't just for children if it was just
[59:51] for children when you listen to it I
[59:53] recommend you go back and relisten to it
[59:55] and as a married adult and say how does
[59:58] that apply to my life and see if it
[1:00:01] doesn't because that was from God that
[1:00:04] was a tremendous service amen sure
[1:00:07] enjoyed brother emanuel's service too
[1:00:08] but brother Toby you got me fired up you
[1:00:11] know absence really makes the heart grow
[1:00:13] fonder and just in case anybody wonders
[1:00:16] my heart is not to travel I don't have a
[1:00:19] heart to travel I get invitations to
[1:00:22] travel and and and I'll tell you over
[1:00:24] the last couple years my heart has
[1:00:26] really become grounded here and every
[1:00:29] time I'm away I just I just long to be
[1:00:32] home I don't desire to go on the road
[1:00:34] and to go and minister in other churches
[1:00:36] there was a time where that was the case
[1:00:38] but that time is not now my heart is
[1:00:41] right here in Calgary and I just
[1:00:43] consider you to be my family and
[1:00:45] so uh I don't plan to travel in the
[1:00:47] future if you're wondering so my goal is
[1:00:50] to be here with
[1:00:52] y'all certainly would like to to welcome
[1:00:55] sister Charlotte
[1:00:56] here tonight sitting at the back here
[1:00:58] behind Sister Mary I guess sister Mary's
[1:01:00] invited her God bless you Sister welcome
[1:01:03] I trust you feel right at
[1:01:05] home uh tonight we just want to carry on
[1:01:08] with our study and the exposition of the
[1:01:10] seven Church ages
[1:01:12] and like I told you in uh the last
[1:01:15] service it just does something to me I
[1:01:17] consider this to be probably one of the
[1:01:21] uh I I don't even know what you call it
[1:01:23] maybe the keystones to the message of of
[1:01:26] the hour um some people might disagree
[1:01:28] but I I just think that you know we need
[1:01:31] to make sure that when we are preaching
[1:01:33] when we're listening when we're singing
[1:01:35] all of the life that we live it needs to
[1:01:37] be according to the word for our day
[1:01:40] amen we can look forwards and put it out
[1:01:43] there to some other day we know brother
[1:01:44] Bram said that very clearly what what
[1:01:46] man is is is is famous at doing is
[1:01:49] looking forward to what's God's going to
[1:01:51] do and and looking back to what God has
[1:01:53] already done but ignoring what God is
[1:01:55] doing right now and in other places he
[1:01:58] says missing what God is doing right now
[1:02:01] and you know brother Bram he was able to
[1:02:03] discern things and and he was able to
[1:02:04] call out people in the audience way back
[1:02:07] there and say Hey you know brother
[1:02:09] sitting there with the the blue shirt
[1:02:11] with short sleeves right at the very
[1:02:12] back in front of the sound booth I see
[1:02:14] that Pillar of Fire hanging right over
[1:02:16] you and and that thing that you're here
[1:02:17] for isn't for you it's for your wife and
[1:02:20] your wife has this issue and she's
[1:02:22] talked to every doctor in the in the
[1:02:24] country and nobody has been able to help
[1:02:26] I'm here to tell you tonight in the name
[1:02:27] of Jesus thus sayith the Lord she's
[1:02:31] healed how does that
[1:02:33] work how how how can that be what a
[1:02:36] tremendous blessing that is but
[1:02:38] sometimes even though that graphic of a
[1:02:40] description is given right right it goes
[1:02:43] right over someone's head true they
[1:02:46] don't have the ability to see it they
[1:02:49] can't receive it right how much more of
[1:02:53] a blessing is it when we can take this
[1:02:55] word word into our heart and say be it
[1:02:57] unto me according to Thy word oh my oh
[1:03:01] my you know I just was reminiscing a
[1:03:03] little bit going back a little ways and
[1:03:06] I don't really want to go too far back
[1:03:08] but I just think it's so beautiful you
[1:03:10] know brothers and sisters we can get
[1:03:12] caught up in in I'll say it this way we
[1:03:15] can get caught up in in the tradition of
[1:03:17] the message of the hour and think that
[1:03:19] there's something that we've got to be
[1:03:21] able to do to produce Christ we know the
[1:03:25] prophet said that you're all the Christ
[1:03:26] that the world's ever going to
[1:03:28] see but what are we doing are we trying
[1:03:30] to make something up are we trying to
[1:03:33] polish things up are we going to polish
[1:03:34] the hubs and and and put the the the do
[1:03:38] skin conditioner on all the seats and
[1:03:40] put the best synthetic oil in the engine
[1:03:42] and the best rubber on the wheels and
[1:03:45] everything is going to be tuned
[1:03:46] perfectly blueprinted and balanced to
[1:03:48] the to the maximum potential that we
[1:03:51] could ever have but not have a dynamic
[1:03:53] spark in that engine in that car it's
[1:03:55] all good for nothing brothers and
[1:03:57] sisters It all becomes a bunch of works
[1:03:59] and really you can have a whole bunch of
[1:04:01] pushing to make that car do something
[1:04:03] but you know what brother bradam he said
[1:04:05] the evidence of a Spirit-filled
[1:04:06] Christian believer is not to produce the
[1:04:09] truth
[1:04:11] word it's not to produce the word but to
[1:04:14] receive the truth the word to believe
[1:04:18] and Obey it and I think that's just so
[1:04:21] amazing because if we could actually
[1:04:24] totally do that in our lives then what
[1:04:26] happens is this word to the church pick
[1:04:29] up your pen and write sorry not the word
[1:04:30] to the church pick up your pen and write
[1:04:32] the the message that brother bradam was
[1:04:34] given for the church it just becomes I
[1:04:38] believe so much more real to us it's not
[1:04:41] something that we try and do we don't we
[1:04:42] don't put this
[1:04:44] on brother bradam he talks about the uh
[1:04:47] in pick up your pen and write he talks
[1:04:49] about how it is the holy spirit that
[1:04:52] gave him a message it has to do with the
[1:04:54] word and the
[1:04:56] bride and he says here is what I'm
[1:04:59] trying to say to you the law of
[1:05:02] reproduction this is paragraph 60 here
[1:05:04] the law of reproduction is that each
[1:05:06] species brings forth after its own kind
[1:05:08] even according to Genesis 1:1 and God
[1:05:10] said let the Earth bring forth grass and
[1:05:13] Herb yielding seed and the fruit tree
[1:05:16] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[1:05:20] is in itself upon the Earth and it was
[1:05:23] so brother Bram he goes on to say here
[1:05:26] the very same law applies to the church
[1:05:29] today they in the bride will be so I'm
[1:05:32] just skimming over here to catch up to
[1:05:34] where we left off they in the bride will
[1:05:36] be so much like him that they will even
[1:05:41] be in his very image and now some people
[1:05:45] think that means to maybe have shoulder
[1:05:47] length hair and to have a
[1:05:50] beard and to maybe try and walk a
[1:05:53] certain way and talk a certain way some
[1:05:55] people think that maybe what they need
[1:05:57] to do is actually dress like brother
[1:06:00] brandom maybe they need to speak like
[1:06:02] brother Bram maybe they need to do
[1:06:04] things in certain ways like certain
[1:06:06] people to try and actually fulfill this
[1:06:10] that's not the way it is at all the only
[1:06:12] evidence is the ability to live this
[1:06:14] word yes to believe the word is one
[1:06:17] thing right that's the first stage but
[1:06:20] this word to believe this word brothers
[1:06:21] and sisters what it does is it gets us
[1:06:23] somewhere it gets us to the light of
[1:06:25] Jesus Christ because this word that
[1:06:27] we're talking about believing the
[1:06:29] message and the word are one yes that's
[1:06:31] right and what's the word the word is
[1:06:33] Jesus
[1:06:34] Christ the message is Jesus Christ the
[1:06:38] same yesterday today and forever the
[1:06:40] person of Jesus Christ so when we can
[1:06:42] say Amen to this word truly right
[1:06:45] genuinely say Amen to this word take it
[1:06:47] into our heart what happens is that Z
[1:06:49] Gene of God we talked about it comes to
[1:06:51] life and when it comes to life it's no
[1:06:53] longer I life living out what it is is
[1:06:55] the fruit of the spirit living out but
[1:06:56] many times what we do is we go that far
[1:06:59] to say Amen to the word but we don't
[1:07:01] give it long enough to let that life
[1:07:03] actually begin living out through
[1:07:05] us and so when we still start to see
[1:07:07] different fruits hanging on the tree
[1:07:10] malice
[1:07:13] hatred variance we start to see all
[1:07:16] these different things that are listed
[1:07:18] in the Bible before the list of the
[1:07:21] fruit of the spirit which is love joy
[1:07:24] peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:07:27] forgiveness all of the fruit of the
[1:07:30] spirit what happens is we still see some
[1:07:32] bitter fruit hanging on the tree and you
[1:07:34] know what we need to do we need to make
[1:07:36] sure that the life is actually coming in
[1:07:38] from the bottom and flowing up through
[1:07:41] the vine into the branches because he
[1:07:43] said it I am the vine and you are the
[1:07:45] branches and how will will will will we
[1:07:48] be able to tell how will you know that
[1:07:52] people love him he said it you you'll
[1:07:55] you'll be B to love one another but
[1:07:56] you'll know them by their fruit amen
[1:07:59] what fruit is hanging on their tree they
[1:08:02] got a temper like a
[1:08:03] bua I I'm getting totally off track here
[1:08:06] I'm going to get into that potentially
[1:08:07] on Sunday
[1:08:09] but when this word comes into the heart
[1:08:12] of a Believer it changes the believer we
[1:08:15] don't have our life our personality our
[1:08:18] genetics our problems continually
[1:08:21] dragging behind us what we get dragging
[1:08:23] behind us is signs and wonders
[1:08:25] of the Holy Spirit living out through us
[1:08:28] that's right
[1:08:31] amen paragraph 55 in the paman church
[1:08:34] age brother bam says now we ask what is
[1:08:36] the will of God there is only one way to
[1:08:38] know his will and that is by the word of
[1:08:43] God he said there it is if it isn't in
[1:08:45] the word you can't have it so we can't
[1:08:47] ask unless it's in the word and we can't
[1:08:49] petition or ask unless it's in his name
[1:08:51] there it is again Jesus the name is the
[1:08:54] word will
[1:08:56] you can't separate God and the word they
[1:08:58] are one amen Jesus Christ the same
[1:09:01] yesterday today and forever in print
[1:09:03] form but when you take this book and you
[1:09:05] eat this book then you become the
[1:09:06] literal manifestation of the word of God
[1:09:08] for your day
[1:09:10] amen that's why it's important to make
[1:09:12] sure that you eat the right book right
[1:09:14] when you eat the book that's not
[1:09:16] actually according to what Malachi 4
[1:09:19] brought Revelations 10:7 brought the the
[1:09:23] full restoration of the word brought if
[1:09:25] if we eat another book we're going to
[1:09:28] have another word in US it'll be another
[1:09:31] spirit in us and to take one word out or
[1:09:34] to add one word to it we know that
[1:09:36] that's death right that's not going to
[1:09:38] get us where we want to
[1:09:41] go so when a spirit born Spirit-filled
[1:09:44] man in faith takes the word in his heart
[1:09:47] and places it upon his lips why that is
[1:09:50] the same as deity
[1:09:52] speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan
[1:09:54] can't stand before for that man I I this
[1:09:58] is just for me it's just beautiful
[1:10:01] because who wants Satan to stand before
[1:10:03] you who wants to have Satan as a
[1:10:06] stumbling block in front of you we've
[1:10:08] got enough stumbling blocks we don't
[1:10:10] need the devil coming around and trying
[1:10:12] to trip us up and giving us problems we
[1:10:15] want to know exactly where we stand so
[1:10:16] that when we speak the word of God it's
[1:10:19] deity speaking and that's why brothers
[1:10:20] and sisters I keep saying that you got
[1:10:22] to get the Holy Ghost we have to get the
[1:10:24] baptism of the the Holy Ghost there's no
[1:10:26] question there's no option to it it has
[1:10:29] to be all the way that's the only way is
[1:10:33] the full baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:10:35] you know what if we haven't got it if we
[1:10:37] don't know for sure whether we've got it
[1:10:39] the only thing we got to do is say Lord
[1:10:41] please according to your word daddy
[1:10:43] that's your word you said that if we
[1:10:46] repent and that if we get baptized in
[1:10:48] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:10:50] the remission of our sins then we shall
[1:10:53] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:56] so when we can actually say that I've
[1:10:58] met the
[1:11:00] requirements Daddy it's up to you I
[1:11:03] can't do anymore and I'm just going to
[1:11:04] say be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:11:06] and I'm not going to move until you
[1:11:08] bring it to me I want that blessing I
[1:11:10] want that kind of
[1:11:12] blessing but you know when the devil
[1:11:14] gets a hold in our life we have a little
[1:11:16] bit of apprehension about that that's
[1:11:18] when it starts to get a little bit funny
[1:11:20] you know now you're going to maybe be
[1:11:21] turned into one of those Holy Rollers
[1:11:23] you're going to be a different person
[1:11:24] you are going to be a different person
[1:11:25] but I can tell you from experience
[1:11:27] brothers and sisters you will never be
[1:11:28] as fulfilled ever be as fulfilled as you
[1:11:31] can potentially be when you truly get
[1:11:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[1:11:35] everything in your life will begin to
[1:11:36] make sense there will be things that
[1:11:38] you'll think I don't understand that and
[1:11:40] I don't think I'll ever be able to
[1:11:42] understand that but you'll be able to
[1:11:43] say that's okay that's the way the
[1:11:45] Lord's ordained it but there's things in
[1:11:48] our lives that maybe we want to just
[1:11:49] completely have control over and and
[1:11:51] control and and drive and steer and you
[1:11:54] know what God wants to be the driver he
[1:11:57] doesn't want to be the co-pilot there's
[1:11:58] people that say God is my
[1:12:00] co-pilot I I don't know I would say
[1:12:03] nominal believer maybe unwise
[1:12:08] virgin because the wise virgin has oil
[1:12:11] and oil represents Jesus Christ the life
[1:12:13] of Jesus Christ Living out through that
[1:12:17] individual you know brother Brown he
[1:12:19] goes on to say that the spirit gave me a
[1:12:21] message for the church and it has to do
[1:12:23] with the word and the bride I'm just
[1:12:24] going to read read this quickly and then
[1:12:26] pick up kind of where we left
[1:12:29] off
[1:12:32] uh actually I'm just going to skim it
[1:12:34] because I want to continue on I I trust
[1:12:37] that some have read it I know some have
[1:12:39] I got some texts and I thought it was
[1:12:41] really good I'm going to get into it on
[1:12:42] Sunday I'll give you a little precursor
[1:12:43] to it uh what I preached in Ohio I have
[1:12:45] to bring here um I got into spoken word
[1:12:48] is the Original Seed is the other place
[1:12:50] in the message of the hour where brother
[1:12:51] bham talks about this pick up your pen
[1:12:54] and write and and he has a lot to talk
[1:12:56] about in that message it's not just a
[1:12:58] little bit where it's just a few
[1:12:59] paragraphs here maybe two or three pages
[1:13:01] worth it's uh it's hours worth of
[1:13:04] discussion and uh so we're going to get
[1:13:06] into that but you know brother BR he
[1:13:09] brings it in here I just love this part
[1:13:11] paragraph 64 he says from a little group
[1:13:15] of the true oh I'm sorry I got to back
[1:13:17] up paragraph 61 whatever life was in the
[1:13:20] sea came forth into a plant and then
[1:13:23] into Fruit the very same law applies to
[1:13:26] the church
[1:13:27] today whatever seed started the church
[1:13:31] will come forth and be like the Original
[1:13:33] Seed because it is the same seed in
[1:13:37] these last days the true bride Church
[1:13:40] Christ's seed will come to The
[1:13:44] Headstone and she will be the Super
[1:13:47] Church a super race as she nears him
[1:13:52] amen and and this isn't a a a super
[1:13:55] person with a super home and a person
[1:13:57] with a super car and a person with a
[1:14:00] super bank account and a person with a
[1:14:02] super education this is a person with a
[1:14:04] supernatural ability to say Amen to the
[1:14:07] word but also live the word not just say
[1:14:12] I believe it they in the bride will be
[1:14:15] so much like him that they will even be
[1:14:19] in his very image this is in order to be
[1:14:23] United with him
[1:14:26] he's not going to unite with someone who
[1:14:28] just comes to church and says that I
[1:14:30] believe it but then I go home and do
[1:14:32] other
[1:14:33] stuff I go home and treat my family a
[1:14:36] different way it's not going to work
[1:14:40] he's not going to unite with that
[1:14:43] person this is in order to be United
[1:14:46] with him they will be one just like a
[1:14:48] husband is one with his
[1:14:50] wife that's what marriage is all about
[1:14:53] the marriage is actually a description
[1:14:56] of what being saved really saved
[1:14:59] actually is it was instituted in the
[1:15:02] Garden of Eden for a purpose to show the
[1:15:05] relationship between the
[1:15:08] bridegroom and the bride the Heavenly
[1:15:11] bridegroom and the Earthly bride amen I
[1:15:14] think it's so beautiful there is an
[1:15:15] invisible Union taking place right now
[1:15:18] but you know as far as as we go forwards
[1:15:21] brothers and sisters this invisible
[1:15:22] Union is becoming more and more visible
[1:15:25] because what's happening is this world
[1:15:27] has gone completely insane it truly has
[1:15:31] what was wrong before is now become
[1:15:34] right and what was right is now becoming
[1:15:38] wrong right so as we take a stand and
[1:15:41] say this is what we believe according to
[1:15:42] the word of God they've even got
[1:15:44] legislation in place in Canada to say
[1:15:47] that there is no longer going to be any
[1:15:49] religious exemption I might not have
[1:15:51] that worded correctly but if we ever
[1:15:53] have a problem and say hey you know what
[1:15:55] I said something towards the lgbtq
[1:15:57] community and somebody feels hurt their
[1:16:00] feelings are stepped on and I say hey
[1:16:02] it's what the word of God says that's
[1:16:04] what the Bible says there's no longer
[1:16:07] any Rel religious exemption if they pass
[1:16:09] that bill I I mean there's probably
[1:16:11] someone in here that knows more than I
[1:16:13] do about it but that's something that's
[1:16:15] tabled in in Ottawa right now so there's
[1:16:18] going to be no place to hide as a
[1:16:20] Believer we're going to stand out and be
[1:16:22] more and more visible amen but blessed
[1:16:25] be the name of the
[1:16:27] Lord what time is it it's much later
[1:16:29] than we
[1:16:31] think that's right one of these days
[1:16:34] they could come through the doors and
[1:16:36] arrest me for saying stuff about the
[1:16:40] lgbtq community and you know what that's
[1:16:42] a reality but so be it that's okay the
[1:16:47] apostles were thrown in prison for
[1:16:49] standing on the word of God if that's
[1:16:51] what we need to do then then that's what
[1:16:52] we need to do maybe there's someone in
[1:16:54] prison that needs to be witnessed to we
[1:16:56] know that there was a Jailer that got
[1:16:58] saved he and his whole house got saved
[1:17:00] because of it
[1:17:03] amen this is just such a beautiful word
[1:17:05] because it's in season for us they in
[1:17:07] the bride will be so much like him they
[1:17:09] will be in his very image this is in
[1:17:11] order to be United with him they will be
[1:17:14] one they will be the very
[1:17:17] manifestation of the word of the Living
[1:17:20] God yes and you know denominations
[1:17:23] cannot produce this wrong SE they will
[1:17:25] produce their Creeds their dogmas mixed
[1:17:28] with the word this mongrelization brings
[1:17:32] forth a hybrid product and you know this
[1:17:34] has been tried in the message where
[1:17:37] people will come to the church and and
[1:17:39] the deacons will shake you down at the
[1:17:40] door and say well your heels sister are
[1:17:43] just a little bit too high and you know
[1:17:46] what your skirt isn't quite long
[1:17:49] enough and brother you've done this
[1:17:52] maybe maybe maybe you actually wore
[1:17:55] shorts for a time so how could you
[1:17:58] possibly be who you say you are right
[1:18:02] it's been tried legalism takes you down
[1:18:06] legalism is good for a little while it
[1:18:08] feels good it's sweet as honey in your
[1:18:10] mouth when you can say look at me my
[1:18:12] suit's perfectly pressed everything that
[1:18:15] I do in my life it's exactly according
[1:18:17] to the message of the hour but you know
[1:18:18] what the message of the hour came for a
[1:18:20] purpose William Mary and Brandon was
[1:18:22] sent to Earth for a purpose and that was
[1:18:24] to take a bride of his own choosing he
[1:18:28] sent elaser to the Earth to go and call
[1:18:31] his Rebecca that's the reason for
[1:18:34] William Mary and Branham and unless
[1:18:36] we're willing to go and actually meet
[1:18:39] our
[1:18:40] Isaac it's for
[1:18:42] not polishing the hub caps on the car I
[1:18:45] keep referring to that for those people
[1:18:47] who don't know it it is the rising of
[1:18:49] the Sun that message brother bradam
[1:18:50] talks about the Dynamics meaning the
[1:18:53] mechanics many times we can have all the
[1:18:55] mechanics everything perfectly in order
[1:18:58] in our life according to the word of God
[1:19:00] according to the message of the hour but
[1:19:01] we're too afraid too rigid to let the
[1:19:03] Holy Spirit take control and you know
[1:19:06] what the mechanics is designed to take
[1:19:07] us to a certain place and then the Holy
[1:19:09] Ghost has got to take over it has to
[1:19:11] happen that
[1:19:13] way it's like the parents being the Holy
[1:19:15] Ghost for the children they have to be
[1:19:17] the Holy Ghost for their children
[1:19:18] because the children don't have
[1:19:20] accountability in their life but once
[1:19:22] they reach a certain age then the
[1:19:23] parents have to take their hands off and
[1:19:25] allow God to do the
[1:19:27] work that's why the word says to train
[1:19:29] them up in the way they should go and it
[1:19:31] won't depart from
[1:19:33] them brother banam here in this book he
[1:19:35] goes on quoting and I remember last time
[1:19:38] I I said there's a part in here where he
[1:19:40] says here's what I'm trying to say to
[1:19:42] you the law of reproduction is that each
[1:19:45] species brings forth after his own kind
[1:19:47] it goes into italicized writing and and
[1:19:50] that's to emphasize something and what I
[1:19:51] said last week was the emphasis is this
[1:19:54] isn't brother Bram speaking this is the
[1:19:56] spirit of God speaking through William
[1:19:58] Mari and Bram pick up your pen and write
[1:20:00] I've got a message for the church she is
[1:20:02] going to be a super Church she is going
[1:20:04] to be a super race the law of
[1:20:06] reproduction states that every seed is
[1:20:08] going to bring forth after its own kind
[1:20:10] if you have a denominational seed and
[1:20:12] you plant that seed you're going to
[1:20:13] bring forth a
[1:20:14] denominational child but if you have a
[1:20:17] true seed of God what's going to happen
[1:20:20] is they're going to become the very
[1:20:21] image of God they will actually be one
[1:20:25] and this is in order to be United with
[1:20:27] him they will be the very manifestation
[1:20:30] of the word of the Living God brother
[1:20:32] Bram goes on to say the first son Adam
[1:20:34] was the spoken seed word of God he was
[1:20:37] given a bride to reproduce
[1:20:40] himself that is why the bride was given
[1:20:44] to him to reproduce himself to produce
[1:20:47] another Son of God but she fell she
[1:20:50] listened to someone else she took some
[1:20:51] other reasoning she put one word in to
[1:20:54] the word of of God that's all and you
[1:20:56] know God never came and told her we've
[1:20:57] talked about this in the past he never
[1:20:58] came and told her he came and told the
[1:21:00] husband he told Adam Thou shalt not Adam
[1:21:04] took the message to her Adam is the one
[1:21:07] that actually explained it to her and
[1:21:09] she had the opportunity the occasion to
[1:21:12] listen to her husband or not listen to
[1:21:13] her husband and fall and when she fell
[1:21:16] she didn't drag the whole mankind down
[1:21:18] Eve didn't do
[1:21:20] that Eve just simply disobeyed her
[1:21:22] husband and her husband out of love for
[1:21:25] his wife stepped out from Grace her
[1:21:29] husband stepped out to actually take her
[1:21:31] by the hand and save her he knew that if
[1:21:34] he didn't do something to redeem her she
[1:21:36] would be lost but she was a part of him
[1:21:38] isn't it a beautiful thought to think
[1:21:40] that that's the same way with Jesus
[1:21:42] Christ if we are truly his bride we
[1:21:45] stepped out by not listening to him and
[1:21:47] what happened was he stepped out and
[1:21:50] actually redeemed us he paid it all he
[1:21:53] did it all for us what a beautiful
[1:21:56] thought brother bam says here but she
[1:21:58] fell she fell by
[1:22:02] hybridization she caused him to
[1:22:05] Die the second son Jesus also had a
[1:22:08] spoken seed word of God was given a
[1:22:11] bride like as was Adam but before he
[1:22:15] could marry her she also had
[1:22:18] fallen she like Adam's wife was put to
[1:22:21] the test whether she would believe the
[1:22:23] word of God and live live or doubt the
[1:22:25] word and
[1:22:26] die she
[1:22:29] doubted she doubted and she left the
[1:22:32] word isn't that amazing she just left
[1:22:34] the word that's all if we leave the word
[1:22:37] today brothers and sisters it's the same
[1:22:39] thing for us same thing for us if we
[1:22:42] doubt the word if we leave the word we
[1:22:45] die she doubted she left the word she
[1:22:49] died but here's where I think it just is
[1:22:51] so good he brings it back to us he br
[1:22:54] brings it to today he brings it to where
[1:22:57] we live this is the word for us in our
[1:22:59] day brothers and sisters from a little
[1:23:01] group of the true seed of the word God
[1:23:05] will present Christ with a beloved bride
[1:23:08] God will do
[1:23:10] this we won't do it God will do it God
[1:23:15] will present Christ with a beloved bride
[1:23:18] amen she is a virgin of his word yes sir
[1:23:22] yes a virgin of his word I I just can't
[1:23:25] emphasize this enough it's not about our
[1:23:27] works she's not a virgin of her Works
[1:23:29] she's not perfect in her Works in her
[1:23:31] ways it's not that at all it's that he
[1:23:34] did it all and we're willing to say amen
[1:23:37] he did do it all and when we do that it
[1:23:40] causes us to live
[1:23:42] differently she is a virgin of his word
[1:23:45] she is a virgin because she knows no
[1:23:48] manmade Creeds are dogmas no well that's
[1:23:52] how we used to do it and that's not how
[1:23:53] we used to do it and we should do it and
[1:23:56] we could do it and you know what
[1:23:57] brothers and sisters it's not about that
[1:24:00] it's not about that at all it's about
[1:24:01] what's inside our hearts When We Gather
[1:24:04] to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ what's
[1:24:06] inside of our hearts I'll tell you what
[1:24:08] if it is truly the spirit of God it's
[1:24:10] going to be exactly according to his
[1:24:12] word amen and it's just such a beautiful
[1:24:15] thing to know that we have an absolute I
[1:24:18] can tell you what brother Barry's
[1:24:19] opinion is on something and you can tell
[1:24:21] me what your opinion is on something and
[1:24:23] someone else cany in and say what their
[1:24:25] opinion is on something and and all of
[1:24:27] us will probably have slightly differing
[1:24:29] opinions except for when it comes to the
[1:24:31] word of God when we can say this is our
[1:24:33] absolute every one of us if we are true
[1:24:35] Sons and Daughters of God will line up
[1:24:38] exactly with the word of God we won't
[1:24:41] try and make excuses and say well this
[1:24:43] or the no we'll always
[1:24:46] say forgive me you know when I was
[1:24:50] preaching in Ohio it was one of the
[1:24:51] things that came out and I I just thank
[1:24:53] the Lord for his leaders ship I would
[1:24:55] never try and and and confront an issue
[1:24:57] or make an issue or do anything like
[1:24:59] that but one of the things that happened
[1:25:01] was we got talking like this and and a
[1:25:03] little bit about it was you know the
[1:25:05] evidence of of someone who actually
[1:25:07] hasn't gone all the way is is what's
[1:25:10] going to happen is when the correction
[1:25:12] comes by the word of God they're going
[1:25:14] to say well no I don't see it that way
[1:25:16] or there's going to be resistance
[1:25:17] they're going to stop they're going to
[1:25:18] hold fast they're going to say no I
[1:25:20] don't know I don't know and maybe even
[1:25:22] want to go like that right but a true
[1:25:24] son or daughter of God is going to say
[1:25:27] wow when somebody takes the time to come
[1:25:29] and talk to me and say brother you said
[1:25:31] this or brother you said that did you
[1:25:34] really mean it that way because you're
[1:25:36] influencing a lot of
[1:25:38] people and the word of God says this
[1:25:41] yes the brother or the sister is going
[1:25:46] to stop and they're going to say wow
[1:25:48] really right amen wow I I I can see the
[1:25:52] word of God and I can see that you're
[1:25:53] bringing it to me and and maybe I can't
[1:25:55] see it myself but I'm just going to
[1:25:57] consider the words and and maybe think
[1:25:59] about it for a little bit and what's
[1:26:00] going to happen is the spirit of God is
[1:26:02] going to move in that individual and
[1:26:03] they're going to say oh my I'm not right
[1:26:05] with the word of
[1:26:07] God forgive me brother forgive me for
[1:26:11] being wrong maybe I said something wrong
[1:26:13] maybe I did something wrong will you
[1:26:15] please forgive me we're not going to try
[1:26:18] and fight and and and have a battle over
[1:26:20] it we got into that a little bit I
[1:26:22] thought it was just amazing and uh
[1:26:25] kind of part of testimonies that that
[1:26:26] came out but you know all of us are
[1:26:29] subject to the word of God and every
[1:26:31] single one of God's children has to
[1:26:33] undergo
[1:26:35] chastening correcting it's not beating
[1:26:37] and it's not harming and it's not making
[1:26:40] big problems it's just correcting back
[1:26:42] to the word of God it's recalibrating
[1:26:44] getting back on track remember there's a
[1:26:46] highway with many many lanes and then
[1:26:48] there's a way and that way that's in the
[1:26:51] midst of that highway is a way of
[1:26:53] holiness and it's always going to be
[1:26:55] straight with the word it's not going to
[1:26:58] deviate to the right or the left but
[1:27:00] sometimes we just need to
[1:27:03] recalibrate from a little group of the
[1:27:05] true seed word of God God will present
[1:27:07] Christ with a beloved bride she is a
[1:27:09] virgin of his word she is a virgin
[1:27:11] because she knows no madade Creeds or
[1:27:12] dogmas she's not interested in saying my
[1:27:14] tradition my whatever my thoughts
[1:27:17] whatever she's going to say wow his word
[1:27:19] says that
[1:27:21] amen by and through the members of the
[1:27:24] rde will be fulfilled all that was
[1:27:27] promised of God to be made manifest in
[1:27:29] the
[1:27:32] Virgin now I think that just Bears a lot
[1:27:35] if you go back and you look at what
[1:27:36] happened in the Christmas story what we
[1:27:38] would call the Christmas story when the
[1:27:39] angel Gabriel came to Mary and started
[1:27:42] to explain to her and talk to her and
[1:27:43] tell her I'm not going to say it tonight
[1:27:45] you've heard me say it many many times
[1:27:49] all all of what God promised is to be
[1:27:52] made manifest in the Virgin The Word of
[1:27:56] Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that
[1:27:59] Word of Promise was he himself to be
[1:28:03] made
[1:28:04] manifest it's no different for us
[1:28:06] tonight brothers and sisters God was
[1:28:08] made manifest he himself acted at that
[1:28:11] time and fulfilled his own Word of
[1:28:15] Promise in the Virgin so I just want to
[1:28:18] go back a little bit remember he came
[1:28:22] and manifested he came and fulfilled the
[1:28:25] word that was prophesied in that virgin
[1:28:28] amen how many virgins were there that
[1:28:30] said oh my my works are perfect I know I
[1:28:34] got a feeling I got a feeling I'm that
[1:28:37] virgin that Isaiah prophesied about I'm
[1:28:39] that virgin how many of them were there
[1:28:41] brother bradam talks about in the
[1:28:42] message there is probably quite a few
[1:28:45] that thought all of their Works
[1:28:46] everything was in line maybe the number
[1:28:48] of years had gone by this is just lining
[1:28:50] up it's getting close a virgin's going
[1:28:53] to concede
[1:28:55] but then when it happened they couldn't
[1:28:57] receive it and that was because he
[1:29:00] fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the
[1:29:03] Virgin I just love it because they and
[1:29:05] the bride will be so much like him that
[1:29:07] they will even be in his very image it's
[1:29:10] in order to be United with him they will
[1:29:12] be one brothers and sisters it ain't
[1:29:13] going to be us doing it my point is he
[1:29:16] is going to come and fulfill all of his
[1:29:18] word oh my as long as we're willing to
[1:29:21] line up with it that's the evidence for
[1:29:24] us to line up with his word it was an
[1:29:26] angel that had brought her to the
[1:29:29] message it an angel that brought her the
[1:29:32] message he said but the Angel's message
[1:29:35] was the word of God Isaiah 9
[1:29:37] and6 he fulfilled at that time all that
[1:29:41] was written of him because she accepted
[1:29:44] his word to her so brothers and sisters
[1:29:47] I just want to point to Malachi 45 and 6
[1:29:50] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:29:54] ET and he's going to turn the hearts of
[1:29:57] the children back to the faith of the
[1:29:59] Pentecostal fathers right not not saying
[1:30:03] we've got signs and wonders and speaking
[1:30:04] in tongues and all these different
[1:30:06] things going on in our lives no no no no
[1:30:08] no the Pentecostal experience the Born
[1:30:11] Again experience where you truly become
[1:30:13] a new creature in Christ Jesus the
[1:30:15] members of the Virgin bride will love
[1:30:16] him and they will have his potentials
[1:30:20] for he is their head and all power
[1:30:22] belongs to him amen they are subject to
[1:30:26] him as the members of our bodies are
[1:30:28] subject to our heads I'm just going to
[1:30:30] throw something out there that I know
[1:30:31] I'm going to bring on Sunday you know
[1:30:32] what brother brandham says is when the
[1:30:35] bride does something different from the
[1:30:38] groom she is not the
[1:30:41] bride the bride always lines up with the
[1:30:43] groom the bride does exactly what the
[1:30:46] groom wants it's not of the spoken word
[1:30:48] is the Original Seed I'll bring the
[1:30:49] quote on Sunday I'm not going to do it
[1:30:51] now but it just is so beautiful we can't
[1:30:53] live Our Lives different than the
[1:30:55] message of the hour and say I'm a
[1:30:57] message
[1:30:58] believer it doesn't work it's a false
[1:31:02] representation we've got to live our
[1:31:03] lives according to the message of the
[1:31:05] hour to prove that we actually truly are
[1:31:09] message
[1:31:10] Believers notice the harmony of the
[1:31:12] father and the son Jesus never did
[1:31:14] anything unless it was first showed him
[1:31:16] by the Father John 5:19 this harmony is
[1:31:19] now to exist between the groom and his
[1:31:23] bride
[1:31:24] amen
[1:31:27] Harmony Harmony between the groom and
[1:31:29] the bride he shows her his Word of Life
[1:31:33] she receives it never doubts it
[1:31:37] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:31:39] death amen for if the seed be planted
[1:31:43] the water will raise it up again this is
[1:31:44] where we left off last time I'm sorry
[1:31:47] this is I I said it last time so I guess
[1:31:49] I'm safe um I just needed to go back and
[1:31:51] get into this and we're probably going
[1:31:53] to dwell here for a little bit I hope
[1:31:54] it's okay there's so much in here this
[1:31:56] is really vital I think for us this is
[1:31:59] the word for us in our day brothers and
[1:32:01] sisters this is not looking at the past
[1:32:03] and it's not looking at the future it's
[1:32:04] for right now here is the secret of this
[1:32:07] the word is in the bride as it was in
[1:32:10] Mary how is the word in each one of us
[1:32:13] if we're the Bride of Jesus Christ I
[1:32:15] don't feel it do you feel it I don't see
[1:32:19] it do you see it we can't actually just
[1:32:22] say here's the word I've got the word we
[1:32:24] can hold our Bibles up and say there's
[1:32:26] the word but it's got to go more than
[1:32:28] this and I think we talked about it a
[1:32:30] little bit last time there has to be an
[1:32:32] intimate relationship because you know
[1:32:34] there's many people that will say oh
[1:32:36] Lord in that day haven't we cast out
[1:32:37] devils in thy name and done many many
[1:32:39] mighty Works had tremendous services oh
[1:32:42] my we were a powerful church we were a
[1:32:44] super Church a super race right and we
[1:32:46] know that he said I never even knew
[1:32:50] you I'm sorry I can't help you you were
[1:32:53] not willing to go all the way into the
[1:32:55] promised land you came right up to to
[1:32:58] Kadesh barnea right up to the place
[1:33:00] where you could actually taste the fruit
[1:33:02] you could feel the fruit you could smell
[1:33:04] the fruit you could see the evidence of
[1:33:07] the promised land but you just wouldn't
[1:33:09] go all the way we don't want to be those
[1:33:11] people brothers and sisters we need to
[1:33:12] get all the way into Christ
[1:33:15] Jesus he shows her his Word of Life she
[1:33:18] receives it she never doubts it
[1:33:19] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:33:21] death when when when the devil can see
[1:33:23] that you're not afraid of death he's not
[1:33:25] going to be able to stand before you
[1:33:27] he's not going to be worried one bit
[1:33:29] about you that's right for the seed be
[1:33:32] planted the water will raise it up again
[1:33:33] here is the secret of this the word is
[1:33:35] in the bride as it was in Mary the bride
[1:33:37] has the mind of Christ for she knows
[1:33:40] what he wants done with the word how
[1:33:41] many people here tonight know what he
[1:33:43] wants done with the word she performs
[1:33:46] the command of the word in his name for
[1:33:50] she has thus sayeth the Lord period
[1:33:55] ah such a little tiny thing but I think
[1:33:57] it's so important to recognize that
[1:33:59] period right there brothers and sisters
[1:34:01] amen she performs the command of the
[1:34:04] word in his name for she has thus saith
[1:34:07] the Lord she's not looking for thus
[1:34:09] sayith the Lord she has it she's already
[1:34:12] got the
[1:34:13] endorsement she's not going to a
[1:34:16] convention to try and gather people
[1:34:17] together to to get a vote so that she
[1:34:20] can be that one she is that one and she
[1:34:23] needs to do is speak the word and go
[1:34:28] forwards but sometimes we get a
[1:34:30] corrupted word in our lives and when
[1:34:34] that happens we speak the word I got
[1:34:35] into this a little bit last time we we
[1:34:37] can speak the word and expect it to
[1:34:39] happen and all Heaven's there to back up
[1:34:41] the word once we speak it that way right
[1:34:42] as the bride we've got the checkbook and
[1:34:44] we've got the whole bank account in
[1:34:46] heaven to supply that need when we write
[1:34:48] that check but sometimes it doesn't get
[1:34:50] answered the way that we want it to yes
[1:34:52] sir does that change the way we feel
[1:34:54] about
[1:34:55] him no not for a Believer no the real
[1:34:59] believer knows that he's chosen this way
[1:35:01] for a purpose there's a reason why we're
[1:35:05] actually getting the answer we're
[1:35:06] getting we can't understand it but we
[1:35:08] just say Amen we believe that it's for
[1:35:10] the best because he chose
[1:35:14] it then the word is quickened by the
[1:35:17] spirit and it comes to pass amen she
[1:35:20] performs the command of the word in his
[1:35:21] name for she has thus sayith the Lord
[1:35:23] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:35:25] and it comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:35:27] planted and watered it comes to full
[1:35:30] Harvest serving its
[1:35:32] purpose those in the bride do only his
[1:35:35] will and no one can make them do
[1:35:38] otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord
[1:35:40] or they keep still remember they have
[1:35:42] thus sayith the
[1:35:43] Lord but they don't clown for nobody
[1:35:46] right we're not looking to see a sign
[1:35:48] we're not looking to see a Wonder we
[1:35:49] don't need to do that we have thus
[1:35:51] sayith the Lord we know exactly who we
[1:35:53] are amen you look at people who are
[1:35:55] loaded they got lots of money they're
[1:35:56] not out there pulling out their pockets
[1:35:59] and thumbing through the stacks of cash
[1:36:01] that are in their pockets and showing
[1:36:03] the gold cards and the black cards and
[1:36:05] all the clear cards all the cards
[1:36:07] they're not showing their diamond rings
[1:36:10] and all the different things they've got
[1:36:12] the money they got nothing to prove to
[1:36:13] nobody they know exactly who they are
[1:36:15] they know where they stand the same
[1:36:17] thing with the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:36:18] she's got nothing to prove to
[1:36:20] nobody Satan's going to come around and
[1:36:22] say well can't can't you say that word
[1:36:24] you know what if you just put yourself
[1:36:26] up on the Pinnacle of the temple here
[1:36:28] you could fall down and if you do that
[1:36:29] then the angels are supposed to take you
[1:36:30] up why don't you just throw yourself
[1:36:32] down and and just see if God's God and I
[1:36:34] mean if you believe the message
[1:36:35] obviously he's going to do that right we
[1:36:37] know that brother Bram he had a wife and
[1:36:40] a baby now going down into the grave to
[1:36:42] be buried those seeds were being planted
[1:36:45] and Satan right at that lowest moment
[1:36:47] came around and said oh you could pray
[1:36:49] for other people and raise them up from
[1:36:50] the ground yes but he won't save you he
[1:36:54] he won't give you what you desire you've
[1:36:56] served him your whole life you made
[1:36:57] yourself a clown in front of your family
[1:37:00] in front of your friends everybody
[1:37:02] that's ever known you you've you've
[1:37:04] totally made a fool of yourself for this
[1:37:07] God and here you are in this position
[1:37:10] and he's not even going to help
[1:37:14] you my isn't that just the
[1:37:17] devil that's just the devil that's why
[1:37:20] it's so beautiful he gave us the
[1:37:21] instruction it's only the only evidence
[1:37:24] is the ability to receive this word
[1:37:26] brothers and sisters it's not whether we
[1:37:28] can feel it it's not whether we can see
[1:37:29] it it's not whether we can produce it in
[1:37:31] fact we're not supposed to produce it
[1:37:32] we're just supposed to say Amen to it
[1:37:34] that's it that is all there is those in
[1:37:38] the bride do only his will no one can
[1:37:40] make them do otherwise they have thus
[1:37:41] sayith the Lord or they keep
[1:37:43] still they know that it has to be God in
[1:37:46] them doing the works fulfilling his own
[1:37:49] word he did not complete all his Works
[1:37:52] while in his Earthly Ministry so now he
[1:37:55] works in and through the
[1:37:58] bride and she knows that you know that
[1:38:01] tonight if you don't know that I want to
[1:38:03] tell you tonight he works in and through
[1:38:07] his bride that's why he has a bride on
[1:38:11] Earth CU he wants to work in and through
[1:38:15] her and she knows that for it was not
[1:38:17] yet time for him to do certain things
[1:38:19] that he must now do but he will now
[1:38:23] fulfill through the bride that work
[1:38:27] which he left for this specific time now
[1:38:31] brothers and sisters I just think it's
[1:38:32] so beautiful here because he doesn't say
[1:38:34] here through the prophet God speaking
[1:38:38] the Holy Ghost inspiring the pen to
[1:38:40] write he doesn't say he will now fulfill
[1:38:44] through the prophet that work which he
[1:38:46] left for this specific time he will now
[1:38:49] fulfill through the bride that work
[1:38:53] which he left for the specific
[1:38:55] time and so I want to say brothers and
[1:38:58] sisters don't be looking in the future
[1:38:59] sometime out there for the specific time
[1:39:02] and don't look back and think well there
[1:39:04] was such a good specific time we had
[1:39:06] this thing happening back there and it
[1:39:08] was such a good specific time you know
[1:39:10] there's times in our life we're good
[1:39:12] like that but what about right now what
[1:39:14] about here right now in this building
[1:39:15] brothers and sisters there's enough
[1:39:17] Dynamic power to stop every single devil
[1:39:20] in hell in this building right here now
[1:39:22] tonight
[1:39:24] amen it's not something that we need to
[1:39:26] look for in the future maybe someday
[1:39:29] when we when we see Jesus when we all
[1:39:31] get to heaven what a day of rejoicing
[1:39:33] that will be what about right now we've
[1:39:35] got the Holy Ghost we've got every
[1:39:38] single reason to
[1:39:40] Rejoice oh my we've only got 11 minutes
[1:39:43] left and and now I want to get started
[1:39:46] with what I wanted to preach tonight my
[1:39:48] goodness paragraph 70 I'll just I'll
[1:39:51] just start this and we'll pick up later
[1:39:53] it's f
[1:39:54] now let us stand like Joshua and
[1:39:56] Caleb remember the study in Joshua and
[1:39:59] Caleb this this just it gets me ignited
[1:40:03] here our promised land is coming in
[1:40:05] sight even as theirs did now our
[1:40:09] Promised Land brothers and sisters isn't
[1:40:11] somewhere it's not somewhere it's not a
[1:40:13] geographical location our promised land
[1:40:16] is Christ Jesus our promised land is the
[1:40:19] Holy Ghost our promised land is the
[1:40:22] Fruit of the Spirit in our lives our
[1:40:24] Promised Land Is The Headstone coming
[1:40:27] down and fitting on the body our our
[1:40:30] Promised Land Is Knowing exactly what
[1:40:33] our husband wants done and then
[1:40:34] fulfilling his word in this
[1:40:38] earth our promised land is coming into
[1:40:41] sight even as theirs did now Joshua
[1:40:43] means Jehovah Savior and he represents
[1:40:46] the end time leader that will come to
[1:40:48] the church even as Paul came as the
[1:40:51] original leader
[1:40:53] Caleb represents those that stayed true
[1:40:57] with Joshua how many calebs do we have
[1:40:59] here tonight I think this is just such
[1:41:01] an amazing thing remember this is the
[1:41:04] Holy Ghost speaking to the church amen
[1:41:08] remember God had started Israel as a
[1:41:11] virgin with his word but they wanted
[1:41:14] something
[1:41:16] different my he was their leader he was
[1:41:19] their Captain he was the one who was
[1:41:22] actually taking them and leading them
[1:41:24] and guiding them but what did they want
[1:41:25] they wanted a king why did they want a
[1:41:28] king because they started to look around
[1:41:30] remember the word of God said don't look
[1:41:32] to the right hand or to the left hand
[1:41:34] just stick with
[1:41:36] me remember God had started Israel as a
[1:41:39] virgin with his word but they wanted
[1:41:41] something
[1:41:42] different so did the last day
[1:41:45] Church notice how God did not move
[1:41:48] Israel or let her go into the promised
[1:41:51] land until it was his own appointed
[1:41:57] time now the people might have put
[1:41:59] pressure on Joshua the leader and said
[1:42:02] the land is ours let's go take it
[1:42:07] Joshua you are all
[1:42:09] through you must have lost your
[1:42:13] commission you don't have the power you
[1:42:15] used to
[1:42:16] have you used to hear from God and know
[1:42:18] the will of God and act
[1:42:21] quickly something is wrong with you now
[1:42:25] brothers and sisters I want to tell you
[1:42:27] this is I love it when it happens you
[1:42:29] ever hear Brother bam say this is fresh
[1:42:32] remember this is the Holy Ghost talking
[1:42:34] here and the Holy Ghost said Joshua is
[1:42:37] Jehovah savior Jehova savior is the Holy
[1:42:40] Ghost what happens is the Devil comes
[1:42:43] around and tries to tell us well maybe
[1:42:44] the Holy Ghost isn't as powerful Joshua
[1:42:47] maybe you've lost your commission Holy
[1:42:48] Ghost maybe you're just not as powerful
[1:42:50] Holy Ghost maybe you just don't want to
[1:42:52] deal with us maybe you just don't want
[1:42:53] to help us when we start to do that what
[1:42:55] we do is we start to say that there's
[1:42:58] three distinct persons in the Trinity of
[1:43:02] God this is Jesus Christ we go back and
[1:43:04] we say Jesus Christ we know that he's
[1:43:06] talking about Jehovah savior the
[1:43:08] promised land is the Holy Ghost but what
[1:43:09] is the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters
[1:43:11] it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:43:12] today and forever it's the entirety of
[1:43:14] the message of the hour the person of
[1:43:16] Jesus Christ Living out through us how
[1:43:18] could God himself ever lose any of his
[1:43:22] anointing how could he ever lose any of
[1:43:24] his appointing how could he ever lose
[1:43:26] any part of
[1:43:27] himself but here we have this he's
[1:43:30] talking about the last day Church the
[1:43:32] land is ours let's go and take it
[1:43:35] Joshua I'm going to say Jesus God
[1:43:38] because that's what he's saying here the
[1:43:40] people are saying when they're talking
[1:43:41] about Joshua maybe you've lost your
[1:43:43] commission Joshua you're all through
[1:43:45] Holy Ghost you're all through can you
[1:43:47] imagine that that's right you must have
[1:43:50] lost your commission you don't have the
[1:43:52] power that you used to have what you
[1:43:56] used to hear from God and know the will
[1:43:58] the what you used to know the will of
[1:44:00] God we know the will of God is his word
[1:44:02] this is where the patch over comes
[1:44:04] brothers and sisters between the prophet
[1:44:06] and the bride we're able to say Amen to
[1:44:09] the prophet Amen to the office Amen to
[1:44:12] the position and the word that he
[1:44:13] brought but now what is that to you what
[1:44:16] is that word mean to you because that
[1:44:18] word means that you become the one you
[1:44:22] become the important one amen right he
[1:44:25] said there won't be two of us standing
[1:44:27] here right at the same time on Earth
[1:44:30] true and he wasn't talking about the
[1:44:31] bride he was talking about Christ
[1:44:33] himself coming to take his bride but I
[1:44:36] think this is just amazing I'm probably
[1:44:38] going to get into this a little more
[1:44:39] Joshua you're all through we know
[1:44:41] there's people trying to manifest the
[1:44:43] gifts we know there's people trying to
[1:44:44] push back to Pentecost we know that
[1:44:47] that's happening people want to see the
[1:44:49] move of God and and when you have maybe
[1:44:51] a pastor that's not willing to move from
[1:44:53] the word of God people might start to
[1:44:55] say well maybe you're through maybe
[1:44:57] you've lost your commission maybe it's
[1:44:58] just not as good as it used to be don't
[1:45:00] do that don't do that trust in the Lord
[1:45:03] amen don't let the devil say this to you
[1:45:05] this is just the same
[1:45:07] Spirit the land is ours let's go take it
[1:45:10] Joshua you're all through you must have
[1:45:12] lost your commission you don't have the
[1:45:14] power you used to
[1:45:15] have my you used to hear from God and
[1:45:19] know the will of God we still know the
[1:45:21] will of God how many people still hear
[1:45:23] from God don't don't let the devil ever
[1:45:25] come around and say that maybe you lost
[1:45:27] your commission we need to be those
[1:45:29] calebs ah my it's N9 o' and I've got to
[1:45:33] quit and I really do just want to start
[1:45:34] here I'm not joking about that all of my
[1:45:37] notes
[1:45:38] are blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:45:41] we'll pick up from here but Joshua he
[1:45:43] was a god-sent prophet and he knew the
[1:45:46] promises of God so he waited for them he
[1:45:48] waited for a clear-cut decision from God
[1:45:51] and when the time came to move God
[1:45:55] placed the full leadership in Joshua's
[1:45:57] hands because he had stayed with the
[1:46:01] word God could trust Joshua but not the
[1:46:06] others now this is where it ties
[1:46:08] together and I can tell you when I was
[1:46:10] talking about that I wasn't thinking
[1:46:12] this in my chair at home today thinking
[1:46:13] this is fresh this was God tonight
[1:46:15] speaking to us so will it repeat in the
[1:46:19] end day the same problem the same
[1:46:22] pressures
[1:46:24] we don't want to try and put God on and
[1:46:27] say you need to do this and it should be
[1:46:29] that and and unless we're doing it some
[1:46:31] other way we're not doing it trust in
[1:46:33] the Lord and put his word
[1:46:35] first and remember just like the
[1:46:37] children of Israel I'm going to get into
[1:46:39] it we will remember the children of
[1:46:41] Israel were instructed you know what up
[1:46:43] get ready because in three days from now
[1:46:45] we're going across that River into the
[1:46:46] promised land and you keep your eyes on
[1:46:49] that Ark and you know husbands Warriors
[1:46:51] you just leave your wives alone don't
[1:46:53] worry about all the Earthly things just
[1:46:56] focus on that word because that Ark is
[1:46:58] going to March and when that Ark marches
[1:47:00] you keep yourself exactly the right
[1:47:02] distance behind it not too far behind so
[1:47:04] you can't see it and not too close so
[1:47:06] that it doesn't have room to move you
[1:47:08] just keep yourself exactly in your
[1:47:10] position same thing for us today
[1:47:12] brothers and sisters I'll call them
[1:47:13] musicians I feel like I could really
[1:47:15] start preaching now and I don't want to
[1:47:17] I'll do that on on on Sunday Lord
[1:47:19] willing maybe stand with me as we close
[1:47:22] you know what Joshua will never ever
[1:47:24] lose his
[1:47:25] commission it's impossible Jehovah
[1:47:28] savior God himself can never lose his
[1:47:31] commission but it's when we start to
[1:47:33] chop them up and say well maybe it's
[1:47:35] just a little portion I think we heard
[1:47:36] it on Sunday and I think it was so
[1:47:38] beautiful that you know God talked about
[1:47:41] the ocean and he talked about the
[1:47:43] Potentials in the ocean and the elements
[1:47:45] in the ocean he talked about that
[1:47:47] through the prophet and the prophet said
[1:47:49] that if you had a spoonful of the ocean
[1:47:51] you had that entire ocean in that spoon
[1:47:55] you had elements from every single part
[1:47:57] of that ocean not the whole ocean but
[1:48:00] you had all of the elements of that
[1:48:03] ocean they will be in his very image in
[1:48:06] order to be United with him God bless
[1:48:08] you tonight let's just bow gracious
[1:48:10] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[1:48:12] your goodness and your Tender Mercies to
[1:48:14] us Lord thank you for leading us and
[1:48:16] guiding us father for being our Jehovah
[1:48:19] savior Lord for showing us the way that
[1:48:22] we should go and Lord father tonight I
[1:48:25] just pray that we would recognize the
[1:48:27] position of Caleb the position that
[1:48:29] Caleb had beside Joshua supporting him
[1:48:33] encouraging Him Father there has to be
[1:48:36] those father that are willing to just
[1:48:38] simply take you at your word there has
[1:48:40] to be a bride father Lord we're so

[1:48:45] Lord not because we just decide to
[1:48:48] because father you called us to be there

[1:48:54] just go with us as we go our separate
[1:48:56] ways father that we would consider the
[1:48:58] words that were spoken Lord Jesus and
[1:49:01] father that we would just see how they
[1:49:03] apply in our own lives and father that
[1:49:05] we could look into the mirror of your
[1:49:06] word each one of us yes Lord and father
[1:49:09] Lord that we would stop seeing ourselves
[1:49:12] and that we would start seeing you
[1:49:13] reflecting back to us Lord father I pray
[1:49:16] that that would be the testimony of the
[1:49:18] world around us father Lord Jesus maybe
[1:49:20] like never before that people would
[1:49:22] begin to say to us there's something
[1:49:24] about you you have a certain light about
[1:49:26] you there's an atmosphere that you
[1:49:28] create I I I don't know what happened to
[1:49:30] you because the old you doesn't seem to
[1:49:32] be there anymore there seems to be a new

[1:49:36] that be the testimonies that roll in
[1:49:38] father that we can say that we see you
[1:49:41] father living out through US less of us

[1:49:51] maybe traveling or or maybe not well in

[1:49:59] family here to us Lord and we look
