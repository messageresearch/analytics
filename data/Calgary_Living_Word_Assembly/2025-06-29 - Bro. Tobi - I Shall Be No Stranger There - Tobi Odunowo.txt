TRANSCRIPT
========================================
talks about when the plegator opened and it just occurred to me that if Jesus is not a stranger to you here, then you wouldn't be a stranger there. But if he's a stranger, then there's no opportunity. I pray you be blessed. It's my confession. I believe it's yours as well. [Music] When the pearl gates are opened to a sinus save by grace when through everlasting mercy See, I behold my Savior's face when I enter in the mansions of the city, pride and fair. I shall have a royal welcome, for I'll be no stranger there. I shall be no stranger. Jesus will my place to prepare. He will greet me. He will greet me. I shall be no stranger there. True times ever changing seasons. I am pressing toward the gold. Seize my heart. Sweet native country. See the homeland of my soul. Many loved ones clothed with beauty in those wonderous glorious year. When I rise, redeemed forgiven. I shall be no stranger there. I shall be no stranger there. Jesus will my place prepared. He will meet me. He will grace me. I shall be no stranger. Here my dear redeemer leaving blessed lamb upon the throne by the creing lights upon them. He will surely claim his own. So whenever you're sad and lonely, look beyond this friendly care. We reach out of God. Remember you will be no stranger there. I shall be no stranger there. Jesus has my place. He will meet me. He will greet me. I shall be no stranger. He will meet me. He will greet me. I shall meet no stranger. [Music] [Applause]
