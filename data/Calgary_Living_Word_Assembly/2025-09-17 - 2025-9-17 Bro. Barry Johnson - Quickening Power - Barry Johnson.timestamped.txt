[19:17] Oh, do you know what it is not to have
[19:22] one guilty feeling? Not to wonder where
[19:26] you're going when you die.
[19:31] Oh, not condemned of the past, not
[19:35] afraid of what tomorrow holds in store.
[19:40] And you know the reason why.
[19:44] Oh, that's just how it is when you go
[19:50] down in the water. Cuz by faith you
[19:54] believe in what you heard.
[19:58] It's no impossible
[20:01] dream you can't start over clean.
[20:07] Oh, when you're washed by the water of
[20:11] the word.
[20:14] Are you wash
[20:17] by the water?
[20:22] By the water of the world.
[20:27] Oh, are you
[20:31] by the water?
[20:34] Oh, are you washed by the water?
[20:41] Oh, it's like being born again with a
[20:46] whole new life to live, never having to
[20:50] look back to what you've been. Aren't
[20:54] you glad his report is true? According
[20:57] to his word, you enjoyed your existence.
[21:02] And where he's concerned, there never
[21:05] was no sin.
[21:09] For when God looks your way, he no
[21:13] longer sees a sinner, but a saint who's
[21:17] been washed white as snow.
[21:22] It's not by anything we've done, but by
[21:26] the blood of God's own son.
[21:30] Oh, are you washed by the water of the
[21:35] word? Oh, your confession now. Yes, I'm
[21:38] wash
[21:41] by the water.
[21:44] Oh yes, I'm wash by the water of the
[21:48] word.
[21:50] Oh yes, I'm wash
[21:54] by the water.
[21:57] Oh yes, I'm washed by the water of the
[22:02] word.
[22:05] If we really know that, how can we not
[22:07] start by saying how great
[22:12] is our God?

[22:19] is our God and all will see how great,

[24:07] from his side
[24:10] to rain upon his throne.

[32:25] Oh, close
[32:30] to you.

[32:37] around me fade away.

[32:47] Oh
[32:49] Jesus
[32:51] Christ.
[32:56] Oh go

[33:06] desire
[33:08] to worship,
[33:14] oh Jesus,

[33:18] me close.
[33:20] [Music]
[33:22] Oh, close
[33:24] Lord
[33:26] to you.
[33:29] Oh, let the world
[33:34] [Music]
[33:38] [Applause]
[33:39] [Music]
[33:44] [Applause]
[33:46] Jesus Christ
[33:48] [Applause]
[33:51] [Music]
[34:02] [Applause]
[34:04] to worship
[34:06] and
[34:07] go.
[34:09] [Music]
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire tonight?
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, we are. Not just tonight, but every
[34:17] day.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; If you have a need tonight, we just want
[34:21] to go before the throne of grace. We
[34:25] have a couple of requests we wanted to
[34:27] bring.
[34:29] We have a request for Ruth and Peter in
[34:33] the Netherlands, the friends of the
[34:35] Livies,
[34:37] to be able to get accommodation
[34:39] and financing to be able to afford it.
[34:42] They actually have an opportunity to
[34:45] view a place on Wednesday and uh as I
[34:49] understand it will take a miracle for
[34:50] that to happen. This is a brother that
[34:53] had a stroke and uh I think he struggles
[34:56] to be able to provide.
[34:59] So it's going to take a miracle for that
[35:02] to happen and we're certainly thankful
[35:04] for that
[35:06] opportunity for the Lord.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We also have a request for Sister
[35:10] Stella who is at home sick and uh it
[35:15] takes a lot to keep Sister Stella from
[35:17] the house of the Lord.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; So we just want to ask the Lord to touch
[35:21] her body and raise her up as well. If
[35:24] you have a need tonight, maybe just make
[35:25] it known unto him.
[35:28] Gracious heavenly father, we're so
[35:29] thankful that Lord we know you as a
[35:32] living God. Lord Jesus, tonight we just
[35:35] are so thankful also that we can gather
[35:37] together in your name. Lord, we don't
[35:40] take it for granted as we see this world
[35:42] getting dark, darker, Lord, by the day.
[35:46] Father, we know that something else is
[35:48] taking place. And that's your quickening
[35:51] power in your bride. And Father, we
[35:54] thank you for that. Amen.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we recognize it. And Father,
[35:59] we just want to give you all the praise
[36:00] and glory for it, Lord. And tonight,
[36:03] Lord Jesus, we just want to remember
[36:05] each and every need that was made known
[36:07] unto you, Lord Jesus. Whether it was
[36:09] just in a heart, whether it was in a
[36:11] mind, whether it was behind an uplift
[36:14] hand to you, Father, whether in person
[36:16] here tonight or streaming somewhere
[36:18] else, we know that you're not bound by
[36:20] time or space, that you are ever
[36:24] present. Father, we just want to commit
[36:26] those needs into your hands, Father,
[36:29] that you would sovereignly meet them
[36:30] according to your will, which is your
[36:32] word. Father, tonight we want to
[36:35] remember the friends of the Livies in
[36:38] the Netherlands, Lord Jesus, Sister
[36:40] Ruth, and Brother Peter. We know they
[36:43] need a touch from you, Father. And we
[36:45] know that it's a miraculous touch,
[36:47] Father. You need to part the waters for
[36:49] them, Lord, is what we're asking for.
[36:51] And we know that you're more than able
[36:53] to do that.
[36:55] So we just thank you in advance, Father,
[36:56] for doing that. And we'll be careful to
[36:59] give you a praise report, Lord Jesus.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[37:03] &gt;&gt; we just ask that you would watch over
[37:04] them, lead them and guide them, Father,
[37:06] in their their search for a place to
[37:08] live, Lord. And Father, we just want to
[37:11] remember Sister Stella who is at home
[37:13] ill in her body. We know that you said,
[37:16] "By my stripes, you are healed."
[37:19] &gt;&gt; And Father, we just claim that scripture
[37:21] for our sister. Yes,
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Lord. We stand united together for her,
[37:26] Lord. And we just thank you for touching
[37:28] her even now, Lord, that she would feel
[37:31] reprieved in her body.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just look forward to the
[37:35] time when we can celebrate with her once
[37:37] again about the grace that you have
[37:39] given us.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, as we turn to your word, we
[37:44] just commit the rest of this service
[37:45] into your hands for your glory. Just ask
[37:48] all these things in Jesus Christ's name
[37:50] we pray.
[37:51] Amen.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[37:56] Certainly wonderful to be in the house
[37:57] of the Lord again. I see we have a
[38:00] couple of visitors here. One of them I
[38:02] know is brother Joe from Melbourne,
[38:05] Australia. And uh right here, God bless
[38:09] you, brother.
[38:13] Apparently, he leaves tomorrow. Brother,
[38:15] I don't know your name, but certainly
[38:17] look forward to meeting you after
[38:19] service, Lord willing.
[38:21] If you have your Bibles, I have a couple
[38:22] of scriptures I would like to read. Like
[38:25] to go back to 2 Kings chapter 13. It's
[38:29] uh maybe getting old for some, but not
[38:31] me.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; And I trust it's not for you.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; I just have another angle that I believe
[38:36] the Lord wanted me to go down. And so
[38:39] we're going to we're going to go there
[38:40] tonight out of 2 Kings chapter 13 and
[38:42] then over to First Corinthians chapter
[38:45] 15.
[38:47] Second Corinth 2 Kings chapter 13 and 1
[38:51] Corinthians
[38:53] chapter 15.
[39:01] And it came to pass as they were burying
[39:03] a man that behold they spied a band of
[39:07] men
[39:09] and they cast the man into the suppler
[39:12] of Elisha.
[39:14] And when the man was let down and
[39:16] touched the bones of Elisha, he revived
[39:20] and stood up on his feet.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; For some, that's a historical account, a
[39:30] historical event. For others, I believe
[39:33] it is our present truth.
[39:38] over in 1 Corinthians
[39:41] chapter 15.
[39:45] 1 Corinthians
[39:48] 15 verse 41.
[39:57] There is one glory of the sun
[40:01] and another glory of the moon and
[40:04] another glory of the stars.
[40:07] For one star differth from another star
[40:10] in glory,
[40:13] so also is the resurrection of the dead.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; It is sown in corruption.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[40:20] &gt;&gt; it is raised in incorruption.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; It is sown in dishonor.
[40:27] It is raised in glory.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; It is sown in weakness,
[40:33] it is raised in power.
[40:36] It is sown
[40:39] a natural body.
[40:41] It is raised a spiritual body.
[40:46] There is a natural body and there is a
[40:50] spiritual body.
[40:54] As so it is written,
[40:57] the first man Adam was made a living
[41:01] soul.
[41:03] The last Adam was made a quickening
[41:07] spirit.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; How be it, that was not the first which
[41:13] is spiritual, but that which is natural,
[41:17] and afterward that which is spiritual.
[41:21] The first man is of the earth, earthy.
[41:25] The second man is the Lord from heaven.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:32] As is the earthy,
[41:34] so are they also that are earthy.
[41:40] Remember, to be carnally minded is
[41:43] emnity with God.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; And as is the heavenly,
[41:50] such are they also that are heavenly. I
[41:55] just love this. I've got Romans 8, five,
[41:57] and six in my Bible written here. Verse
[42:00] 49 says, "And as we have borne the image
[42:04] of the earthly, all of us, we shall also
[42:08] bear the image of the heavenly."
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Now, this is God's word. This isn't
[42:16] something that we're making up. This
[42:17] isn't even something that a man brought
[42:20] claiming to be God's prophet or other
[42:22] people claiming that he is God's
[42:24] prophet. This is the word of God.
[42:25] Someone has to fulfill this scripture
[42:27] here. Amen.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Just going to read this again. Verse 49.
[42:31] And as we have borne the image of the
[42:33] earthly, we shall also bear the image of
[42:37] the heavenly.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and
[42:41] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
[42:44] Neither do corruption inherit
[42:47] incorruption.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, we thank you
[42:54] for your word. Thank you Lord Jesus that
[42:56] this flesh cannot inherit incorruption.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Oh father the creature groans from
[43:04] within Lord Jesus.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; And father we just ask we invite Lord we
[43:08] plead with you that your spirit would
[43:10] utter groanings from within our spirit
[43:13] Lord that Father it wouldn't be this
[43:15] flesh dictating our lives but that it
[43:17] would be your spirit reigning mortally
[43:20] in these bodies. Father, we just ask
[43:23] Lord Jesus that you would quicken this
[43:25] word to us tonight. Father, that you
[43:27] would quicken our mortal bodies to your
[43:29] word. Father, that Lord Jesus, we would
[43:31] hear one more time about ourselves, the
[43:35] selves, Lord, that you created before
[43:37] the foundation of the world.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Father, we just love you and we thank
[43:41] you. We just commit this word into your
[43:44] hands now. In Jesus Christ's name we
[43:46] pray. Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be
[43:49] seated.
[43:53] I just think this scripture here is so
[43:55] beautiful. Tonight I want to talk about
[43:57] quickening power and it's quickening
[44:01] power by a quickening spirit. And uh we
[44:04] know that Elisha, he had a quickening
[44:08] power but that power was not his power
[44:11] and that power was not his spirit. It
[44:13] was a quickening spirit that was in and
[44:16] on Elisha. and verse 45 out of 1
[44:20] Corinthians chapter 15. And so so it is
[44:23] written, the first man Adam was made a
[44:26] living soul. The last Adam was made a
[44:31] quickening spirit. And we know that last
[44:34] Adam was Jesus Christ and he is the
[44:37] word. And if you have the word in you,
[44:40] then you are a quickening spirit. I
[44:44] think it's just such a beautiful thought
[44:46] and uh I I looked to see I feel like I
[44:49] had talked on quickening power, the
[44:52] quickening spirit and uh the last time I
[44:54] did was 5 years ago. So I felt like it's
[44:56] probably okay for the leadership of the
[44:59] Lord to be taking me here again 5 years
[45:01] down the road. And uh I just trust that
[45:03] it's okay tonight. I looked to see if
[45:05] the scriptures were the same and and
[45:07] there was a little bit, but it was more
[45:08] about Romans chapter 8. And uh I think
[45:11] we could probably get into that a little
[45:13] bit, but I don't really have plans to
[45:14] tonight. This could be uh something that
[45:17] goes on for a little while. We'll just
[45:19] see what the Lord has in store. I just
[45:22] would like to uh say uh God bless you,
[45:26] brother John Smith. That is Sister
[45:29] Rebecca Snow's dad. He goes back home to
[45:33] Ontario on Friday. And it's been
[45:35] wonderful to have you with us. We wish
[45:37] God's blessings for you, brother. Please
[45:40] greet your wife and uh your pastor for
[45:42] us. And uh I'll have to say till we meet
[45:45] again.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Now, did anybody enjoy the the weekend
[45:56] meetings?
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Boy, there was some uh there's some
[46:02] stuff to chew on in there. That's what I
[46:04] said to brother Andrew as we uh parted
[46:06] ways. You know, there's there's a lot
[46:08] for us to chew on probably till we meet
[46:10] him again next year in uh what happened
[46:13] over the weekend, but it was just a an
[46:16] incredible time of fellowship around the
[46:18] word of God. And I so appreciate to uh
[46:21] just sit and be fed as well.
[46:25] And uh you know, there's so many things
[46:28] that were said and it it could appear
[46:30] like brother Barry and brother Andrew
[46:32] had conversations. We talked about
[46:34] things going on in our lives and other
[46:36] people and we never did and uh never
[46:39] will. That's just not the way it works.
[46:41] But you know, it's the spirit of the
[46:43] Lord and uh it's just amazing when that
[46:46] happens because we have to realize we
[46:49] have to come to the place where we
[46:50] realize that when we get together like
[46:52] this, it is not about psychology. It's
[46:55] not about getting together and talking
[46:58] about one another and seeing how we can,
[47:00] you know,
[47:02] cobble together some quotes and uh maybe
[47:04] some scripture and try and address a
[47:06] need or something that we've talked
[47:08] about in the body. It it truly is a man
[47:11] coming from another place and preaching
[47:13] what the Lord placed on his heart. Every
[47:15] single time I shake his hand behind the
[47:17] pulpit, which I do with anyone that
[47:19] preaches here, if I introduce them, I
[47:22] shake their hand and I say, "Take your
[47:24] liberty. Let the Holy Spirit minister to
[47:26] us.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; It's not something that is pre-planned
[47:30] or coordinated. So, just a wonderful
[47:32] time of fellowship this weekend. You
[47:34] know, just love the thought. The first
[47:36] service on Friday night, we have a
[47:38] vindicated forecast and and we do have a
[47:41] vindicated forecast. There is an
[47:43] oncoming storm and this world is uh
[47:46] going through birth pains right now.
[47:48] It's amazing when we look around and see
[47:50] all the the things going on. But it just
[47:53] was so apparent to me today as I was
[47:55] really meditating on these thoughts, you
[47:57] know, how dark it's getting. And what
[48:00] that dark is going to do is eliminate
[48:03] the light that's inside the bride of
[48:06] Jesus Christ. This quickening power is
[48:08] getting stronger and stronger. The devil
[48:10] isn't getting greater and stronger in
[48:12] this world. Maybe he is. He's having
[48:14] success through all of his subjects in
[48:16] this world. But don't think for a second
[48:18] the bride is getting weaker
[48:21] &gt;&gt; because when the enemy comes in like a
[48:23] flood, what happens?
[48:24] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God raises a standard
[48:26] against that flood of the enemy. And
[48:29] that spirit that that that standard, I
[48:32] mean, that gets raised is truly the
[48:34] bride of Jesus Christ with the
[48:35] quickening power in her.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; And uh the devil, he wants to stop her.
[48:40] He wants to distract her. He wants to
[48:42] keep her down as long as he can because
[48:45] as soon as she goes up, he is thoroughly
[48:48] cast down. He has three and a half years
[48:50] to accomplish anything that he can ever
[48:52] do. And then he's going to be uh, you
[48:56] know, he's going to his demise.
[48:58] Revelations 20:10, uh, one of the
[49:00] favorite scriptures of mine, you know,
[49:02] where the beast and the false prophet
[49:04] are, that's where he's going to be cast
[49:06] into that lake of fire where there's
[49:08] torment. And the Bible says forever and
[49:10] ever. And I think it's just kind of nice
[49:12] to just pause and talk about this for a
[49:14] little while cuz the devil hates it. He
[49:16] knows it. He believes the word of God
[49:17] more than most theologians is what
[49:19] brother Brandham said. But you know,
[49:21] he's going to be in there for a space of
[49:23] time. It's not going to be eternal.
[49:25] There is no eternal hellfire because
[49:28] that would be life. And there's only one
[49:30] form of eternal life and that is Zoey,
[49:33] God's own life. And he's not going to
[49:36] torment for eternity. But the devil, he
[49:40] is going about as a roaring lion, see
[49:42] seeking whom he may devour. And uh you
[49:45] know, we've got a vindicated forecast
[49:47] and that is for there to be uh
[49:50] greater works done through this bride
[49:53] than what was done in the days of Jesus
[49:55] even. And it's not greater works in
[49:57] terms of someone being raised from the
[49:59] dead or so on and so forth. It's more.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; We have a prophet that said that it was
[50:03] actually more works. There's going to be
[50:06] more people raised from the dead.
[50:07] There's going to be more food supplied
[50:10] in situations where there isn't. There's
[50:12] going to be more situations worked out,
[50:15] complex problems that just can't be
[50:17] solved by by the comingings and goings
[50:19] of man
[50:21] &gt;&gt; that the Lord will do.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Marriages restored,
[50:25] &gt;&gt; children renewed,
[50:27] &gt;&gt; people coming back to the Lord. What is
[50:29] the greatest miracle of all, by the way?
[50:31] Let's just remind ourselves that the
[50:34] greatest miracle of all is that a human
[50:35] being could go from being a sinner born
[50:38] in sin shaped in iniquity coming into
[50:40] the world speaking lies to recognizing
[50:43] that they always were a son or a
[50:45] daughter of God.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; My we have a vindicated forecast and
[50:50] that prophetic utterance
[50:53] is God speaking to his people. That is
[50:55] the weather forecast. the Holy Ghost
[50:57] speaking through his five-fold ministry,
[50:59] bringing his bride to perfection, the
[51:01] saints to perfection. It's the only
[51:03] provided way that God has done it. You
[51:05] know, we also heard on Saturday night
[51:07] the authority of the confession of the
[51:11] open book generation. It's a mouthful,
[51:14] but if you stand back and look at it and
[51:16] and think about it, the power of that
[51:19] statement, the authority of the
[51:21] confession of the open book generation.
[51:25] There is a generation of people on earth
[51:27] that believe there is an open book.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; But interestingly, there's some that
[51:32] believe, well, it's only partially
[51:33] opened.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; It's only partially open. And to some,
[51:36] they actually have a a firm, solid
[51:39] belief that that's all it is until God
[51:41] sends a prophet back to completely open
[51:43] it again. That's true that people
[51:46] believe that. It's not true that that's
[51:48] the case. But some people actually
[51:50] believe that it's partially open. Some
[51:52] don't believe that it's open at all.
[51:54] They believe that it's closed
[51:55] altogether. And the only people that
[51:57] could ever potentially do it is some
[51:59] theologian somewhere be able to reveal
[52:02] what's in the book. and and some read it
[52:04] and and they never are able to come to
[52:07] the knowledge of the truth. They're ever
[52:09] learning, always
[52:11] learning, but never able to come to the
[52:14] knowledge of the truth. Why is that?
[52:15] Because they don't have revelation by
[52:17] the spirit of God. We know in the church
[52:20] age book, Brother Brandham said it very
[52:21] thoroughly, get in the spirit first.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Don't go through the acts.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Get in the spirit first.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; And I say get the Holy Spirit. bring the
[52:30] Holy Spirit to the service and then get
[52:32] in the spirit, start to worship and see
[52:34] if God won't come around and actually
[52:36] begin to reveal change it from being
[52:38] head knowledge to actually a hard
[52:40] experience and that becomes a new book
[52:43] to us. But you know this book is an open
[52:46] book and uh it's just a wonderful thing.
[52:51] I I think that uh the last one was a
[52:53] doozy on Sunday and and that one really
[52:55] spoke to me and like I said I just claim
[52:57] it for myself because you know uh being
[53:01] a pastor is not an easy thing and I know
[53:04] that we all have jobs and we all have
[53:05] things in our lives. Some people would
[53:07] say that you know being a pastor you
[53:09] signed up for it so suck it up. And
[53:12] that's kind of like the same sort of
[53:14] statement that uh you know, brother
[53:16] Andrew said the I don't know what it was
[53:18] a fellowship one night someone it was a
[53:20] Sunday night I guess they were
[53:21] fellowshipping around and he said well I
[53:23] guess I I got to go I got to got to go
[53:26] to work in the morning. Some of us have
[53:28] real jobs and you know I I said wow
[53:31] maybe he was joking a little bit. He
[53:32] said he wasn't joking at all. And I know
[53:34] some people will do that and and maybe
[53:36] as a just a backhanded comment, as a fun
[53:40] thing, you know, I guess for some people
[53:43] backhanded comments are okay in general,
[53:45] but for others they're not at all. And
[53:48] uh you know, like uh
[53:54] I I certainly never chose to be a pastor
[53:56] in my life. I believe I was called to be
[53:59] one and I just wanted to follow the
[54:00] leadership of the Lord. That's right.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; And uh you know when the backhanded
[54:05] comments start to fly and and certain
[54:07] things happen, it can be very easy to
[54:10] actually internalize things and and
[54:13] internalize situations. And without the
[54:16] spirit of God coming around and actually
[54:18] scrubbing away those calluses, if if
[54:21] I'll say it my way, if I'm not careful,
[54:24] I can become callous. And I thought it
[54:26] was amazing the way he said it. He used
[54:28] the example of playing the guitar
[54:31] &gt;&gt; by doing what we do
[54:34] genuinely and earnestly. We can become
[54:37] callous.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; If we're not careful.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Lord, help me."
[54:43] &gt;&gt; I certainly don't want to lose the love
[54:46] &gt;&gt; for and to the people.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; And that was the title of the service on
[54:51] Sunday. lose not the love for and to the
[54:56] people. And you know, just being
[54:58] brothers and sisters in the church, we
[55:00] can have situations crop up and have
[55:02] them crop up and have them crop up and
[55:04] if we're not careful, we can become
[55:06] callous also. But I love how he said it
[55:09] too. You know, if we just go from church
[55:10] to church to church, the only thing we
[55:12] do is build up a callous and we realize
[55:14] that you know what, the problem isn't
[55:16] every individual church. Although when
[55:18] you're under the influence of that
[55:19] spirit, you do believe that every single
[55:21] church is flawed. And I heard uh I think
[55:23] it was Billy Graham say it. You know, if
[55:25] you ever go to a perfect church and you
[55:28] find a perfect church, you just made it
[55:30] imperfect.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; I thought that was such a notable
[55:34] statement.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; So beautiful. Because it's true.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; There is no perfect church.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; There's no perfect family. There's no
[55:41] perfect pastor. There's no perfect song
[55:43] leader. There's no perfect deacons.
[55:45] There's no perfect trustees. There are
[55:47] some perfect sound people.
[55:52] Nobody's perfect.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; And that's the way God chose to do it.
[55:56] That's why he wanted it that way. So
[55:58] that we wouldn't look to man.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; And when we try to make people perfect
[56:02] and then we say we get disappointed by
[56:04] it, why are we? The only reason is
[56:06] because we're not looking at Jesus.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; He wants us to look to him. And that's
[56:10] why he allows us to see the humanity.
[56:13] But we've got to not look at the flesh,
[56:15] not stumble at the veil. If we do that,
[56:17] then we're actually not doing our our
[56:19] our our brothers and our sisters a
[56:22] service. We're doing them a disservice
[56:23] because the word of God says to know no
[56:25] man after the flesh.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; But the calluses, they happen sometimes.
[56:32] I just thought it was so good by doing
[56:33] what we normally do. By doing the right
[56:35] things, we can get calluses. And it just
[56:38] really inspired me because you know if
[56:41] we just try and do things a little bit
[56:42] differently than maybe where the callus
[56:44] was actually building and building and
[56:46] building it can actually have a chance
[56:49] to rest and we can actually do things
[56:50] just a little bit differently. And then
[56:52] maybe we actually begin to build a
[56:54] little bit of a callus over here on this
[56:56] other hand or this other finger or this
[56:57] other way that we do things. And you
[56:59] know maybe it just balances out a little
[57:00] bit gives the other skin a little time
[57:02] to rejuvenate on our hearts. So, you
[57:06] know, doing things a little bit
[57:07] differently, I think, is very
[57:08] legitimately important because we can
[57:11] become callous just doing the same thing
[57:13] over and over again. And, you know,
[57:14] Brother Brandham says it and it's a it's
[57:16] a true statement. You know, doing the
[57:18] same thing over and over again hoping
[57:19] for a different result is what?
[57:22] &gt;&gt; It's the definition of insanity. So,
[57:25] let's not do that. Let's not become
[57:27] callous people.
[57:29] I'm talking to me. Just preaching to me.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:32] Yeah, I just was thinking, you know, I'm
[57:34] kind of preaching in the mirror. I just
[57:36] want to say this. I'm certainly
[57:37] thankful. Are you thankful there's no CO
[57:39] now?
[57:41] &gt;&gt; And some people will say there's CO.
[57:42] It's around. We get sick from it. And
[57:44] Yep. I don't dispute that for a second.
[57:46] But what I am saying is that we're not
[57:48] mandated by CO as human beings. I was
[57:51] remembering preaching in the mirror when
[57:52] we had the
[57:54] &gt;&gt; It's like the glass here, the surround.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; So bizarre to look at myself the whole
[57:59] service.
[58:01] But you know, we had have to have
[58:03] feelings and uh
[58:06] we don't want to go through life without
[58:07] feelings and uh we just need to check
[58:11] ourselves. I think it's important. I
[58:12] believe this weekend was a really good
[58:14] milestone for us maybe as a body. It was
[58:17] for me as a pastor just just to check
[58:20] and and see do I have a pulse? Have I
[58:23] become callous? Is there is there life
[58:26] inside of here? and and see if I I have
[58:30] care. I'm saying it my about me. I don't
[58:32] want to put on anyone else. Do I still
[58:34] have care for people? And and I say yes,
[58:36] I do. I I surely do. I'm not saying that
[58:38] I don't. But what I am saying is that if
[58:40] the Lord is going to rebuke me, I'm
[58:42] going to take it.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say thank you, Lord,
[58:45] because I'm his son.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to say, "Oh, it's got to
[58:48] be someone else. No way. That was for
[58:51] me. That service was entirely for me.
[58:53] Selfishly, I'm just going to claim it
[58:55] for myself.
[58:56] I can't just run to another church
[58:58] because I would just take my problems
[59:00] there.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; That's terrible. I wouldn't want to do
[59:04] that to anybody.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; But uh anyways, we just need to have
[59:07] feelings and maybe just check and see if
[59:09] we do have care and concern for others.
[59:11] The the weekend really spoke to me as
[59:13] you can tell. I I just couldn't wait to
[59:15] get behind the pulpit. I feel like
[59:17] there's so much that I could talk about,
[59:18] but I'm not going to. I just want to
[59:21] talk about our scripture tonight and the
[59:23] quickening power. And you know how the
[59:25] uh the life that was inside Elisha had
[59:28] gone. His spirit had gone, but the
[59:31] quickening power had not left those
[59:34] bones. The quickening power of the Lord
[59:36] Jesus Christ was still there.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; In him.
[59:41] You know in uh Colossians 2 verse 10 it
[59:46] says, "And ye are complete in him which
[59:49] is the head of all principality and
[59:51] power. in whom also ye are circumcised
[59:55] with a circumcision made without hands.
[1:00:00] The token,
[1:00:02] that's the token. The circumcision
[1:00:04] that's made without hands. We know that
[1:00:06] Israel had a sign in their flesh and
[1:00:08] that was the natural circumcision. We're
[1:00:10] not talking about that here. We're in
[1:00:12] the New Testament here talking about
[1:00:14] grace, about the circumcision that is
[1:00:16] made without hands, which is the token
[1:00:19] in putting off the body of the sins of
[1:00:22] the flesh by the circumcision of Christ,
[1:00:26] the old man dying off, buried with him
[1:00:30] in baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:33] Christ for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:36] in our lives. So that it's literally
[1:00:38] that quickening power, the life of Jesus
[1:00:41] Christ inside of us, buried with him in
[1:00:44] baptism, wherein also ye are risen with
[1:00:47] him through the faith of the operation
[1:00:51] of God. I I I I this gets me excited to
[1:00:54] think about it because many times we
[1:00:56] talk about the operation of of of the
[1:00:59] power in a certain circumstance or a
[1:01:01] situation. maybe the operation of the
[1:01:03] power in in some sort of a a government
[1:01:06] power or or maybe a municipal power, but
[1:01:09] we're not talking about humanity's power
[1:01:12] here. We're talking about the operation
[1:01:14] of God in our lives. It's the operation
[1:01:17] of God. I'm going to get into it a
[1:01:19] little bit later, but you know, I don't
[1:01:21] know, did I preach on proving his word?
[1:01:24] I don't know if I did or not, but you
[1:01:26] know, many times we want to prove his
[1:01:28] word, but it's not up to us to prove his
[1:01:30] word. It's up to him to prove his word.
[1:01:33] Alls we have to do is surrender
[1:01:34] ourselves, submit ourselves, subject
[1:01:37] ourselves one to another in the fear of
[1:01:40] God, and allow him to prove his word in
[1:01:42] our lives. But buried with him in
[1:01:44] baptism, wherein also ye are risen with
[1:01:47] him through faith of the operation of
[1:01:50] God, who hath raised him from the dead.
[1:01:54] So, just like that guy was tossed in on
[1:01:56] the bones of Elisha, that exact same
[1:01:58] quickening power has raised us from the
[1:02:02] dead.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; How has that happened? We have been
[1:02:04] given the earnest,
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; We've been given the down payment.
[1:02:07] Brother Brandham talked about it in his
[1:02:09] day. If you had 25 cents given to you,
[1:02:12] someone flipped you a quarter and you
[1:02:13] were hungry, you could say, "I caught it
[1:02:16] and now I potentially have that loaf of
[1:02:19] bread that I'm dying for because I'm so
[1:02:22] hungry."
[1:02:23] You're going to go and buy that loaf of
[1:02:25] bread maybe when you get off of work.
[1:02:27] You've got it.
[1:02:29] Same thing with our resurrection,
[1:02:30] brothers and sisters. That token in our
[1:02:32] life, that circumcision, not in the
[1:02:34] flesh, but of the old man gives us that
[1:02:38] token in our lives, it gives us
[1:02:40] resurrection.
[1:02:43] Verse 13 says, "And you being dead in
[1:02:45] your sins and the uncircumcision of your
[1:02:49] flesh,
[1:02:51] isn't this awesome? hath he quickened
[1:02:53] together with him.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Having forgiven you all trespasses.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; So I can't read this and think, you
[1:03:02] know, there's any human being that would
[1:03:04] ever dare call themselves a Christian
[1:03:06] and hold on to any grudge with anyone.
[1:03:09] We know the word says that as we judge,
[1:03:12] that's how we're going to be judged. But
[1:03:13] I look at this and think about it. I
[1:03:15] just can't get past it to think that I I
[1:03:18] it was while I was living in my flesh.
[1:03:21] It was while I was dead in sins and and
[1:03:24] and trespasses, it says, "And the
[1:03:26] uncircumcision of your flesh." We know.
[1:03:28] We're going to go over to Ephesians
[1:03:29] chapter 2, and we'll read that in a bit.
[1:03:32] But this just gets me excited because it
[1:03:34] was when we were there, that he
[1:03:36] quickened us together with him. Having
[1:03:39] forgiven you all trespasses, not most of
[1:03:42] them or some of them, the ones that are
[1:03:45] the easiest to forgive, but all
[1:03:47] trespasses, blotting out the handwriting
[1:03:50] of ordinances that was against us, which
[1:03:53] was contrary to us, and took it out of
[1:03:56] the way, nailing it to his cross.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; I just think, brothers and sisters, I
[1:04:03] wanted to try and remind us of this
[1:04:05] quickening power tonight. The devil
[1:04:07] wants us to think that this is for
[1:04:09] somewhere somewhere out in the future.
[1:04:11] Maybe it was for something in the past,
[1:04:13] but to maybe not see it manifesting in
[1:04:16] our lives. It's not working in our
[1:04:17] lives. I I hope it's working in our
[1:04:19] lives. But if you don't see it working
[1:04:20] in your lives, trust that it's working
[1:04:22] in your lives because something keeps
[1:04:24] holding you and causing you to come to
[1:04:26] the house of the Lord to worship in
[1:04:28] spirit and in truth. Even though we're
[1:04:31] in the darkest of days right now, we're
[1:04:33] in between the thoughts of men being
[1:04:36] continually evil in their hearts.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; They don't even believe that there's a
[1:04:41] God. And if there is a God, it's
[1:04:43] whatever god they decide to make it.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; And those folks think that it's okay to
[1:04:48] murder helpless babies
[1:04:51] as a form of birth control.
[1:04:54] I'm going to get started on that one of
[1:04:56] these days, and I'm not going to let up
[1:04:57] with it at all. And I I I'll say it this
[1:05:00] way. I really appreciate the way Charlie
[1:05:02] Kirk preached that,
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Abortion is evil.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Abortion is wrong. Abortion is sinful.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Even if it's in the form of uh
[1:05:20] I'm not going to go too far with that,
[1:05:21] but I am going to say this, brothers and
[1:05:22] sisters.
[1:05:24] I think it's amazing how we live in an
[1:05:26] age where the thoughts in men are evil
[1:05:28] continually. And what is it? What's in
[1:05:31] it for me every step of the way? No
[1:05:34] matter what happens, if I get out of bed
[1:05:36] and put my feet on the floor, what is my
[1:05:38] reward? What's in it for me? If I drive
[1:05:42] across the city to go and do something,
[1:05:44] what's in it for me? If I pick up my
[1:05:46] phone and answer it because someone's
[1:05:47] calling me, what's in it for me? What's
[1:05:50] in it for me? It's the Leodysian church
[1:05:52] age. is the age in which we live in. But
[1:05:55] you know what brother Brandham said?
[1:05:57] Yeah. I'll say it this way. What the
[1:05:58] Holy Ghost said to you, brother
[1:06:00] Brandham, is eternal life is not what's
[1:06:02] in it for me. It's what's in it for
[1:06:04] everyone else because my life is for
[1:06:06] other people. Eternal life is living for
[1:06:09] others.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; But I just love this. He took a and made
[1:06:15] all of the ordinances that were against
[1:06:16] us, which were contrary to us, which
[1:06:19] were going to take us down, which would
[1:06:21] put us in the place, that lake of fire
[1:06:23] where Lucifer, Satan, that old serpent,
[1:06:25] the devil, is going to go out of
[1:06:27] Revelations 20:10. And his day has never
[1:06:30] been closer than it is today. It is the
[1:06:32] time is ticking. It's going fast. But
[1:06:35] all those ordinances that were against
[1:06:37] us are going to go upon him back into
[1:06:40] that lake of fire. It's beautiful. Verse
[1:06:43] 15 says, "And having spoiled
[1:06:45] principalities and powers, all of the
[1:06:48] powers of the enemy, all of the rulers
[1:06:50] of darkness, all of it has been spoiled
[1:06:53] completely." Having spoiled
[1:06:55] principalities and powers, he made a
[1:06:57] show of them openly.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Triumphing over
[1:07:03] them in it.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; And I just think it's beautiful because
[1:07:08] how does he do it? He does it by living
[1:07:11] through us every single day. When we
[1:07:14] live this word, when we live the spirit
[1:07:17] of Christ, when we die to ourselves
[1:07:19] daily and allow him to live through us,
[1:07:22] he triumphs openly over the devil.
[1:07:25] Because who believes this word?
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Who could possibly believe this word?
[1:07:30] Only only the believers. Let's turn over
[1:07:33] to Ephesians. Ephesians chapter 2.
[1:07:41] I think it's so wonderful, so amazing
[1:07:44] talking about this quickening power
[1:07:46] being alive tonight in in the lives of
[1:07:48] every one of us as believers.
[1:07:52] This quickening power is enough to make
[1:07:54] us want to shout. I think Ephesians
[1:07:57] chapter 2, "And you hath he quickened
[1:08:01] who were dead in trespasses and sins."
[1:08:04] Every single one of us were dead in
[1:08:07] trespasses and sins. Whether we came
[1:08:10] into this world through a message family
[1:08:12] and never had any exposure to the scars
[1:08:14] and troubles of this world or not, we
[1:08:17] had to come to a place of recognition
[1:08:19] that I was born in sin. I I was shaped
[1:08:22] in iniquity and and I came into this
[1:08:24] world speaking lies according to the
[1:08:25] word of God. and and I need a savior
[1:08:29] because without it I am actually the
[1:08:31] same as every other human being in this
[1:08:33] world and that's how they're judged
[1:08:35] whether you know it's amazing how
[1:08:37] brother Brandham would say this how the
[1:08:39] Holy Spirit would quicken brother
[1:08:40] Brandham God isn't going to judge us one
[1:08:43] day for what we've done
[1:08:47] he's going to judge those people for
[1:08:49] what they haven't done
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; he's going to judge them for not
[1:08:53] accepting the way that he provided for
[1:08:55] them That's right.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; And in the day in which people lived in
[1:08:58] Noah's day, that was simply get in the
[1:09:00] boat.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Just get in the ark. All you got to do
[1:09:04] is get in that boat. But we know that
[1:09:06] they were smarter, they were richer,
[1:09:08] they were they were more educated,
[1:09:10] whatever it was. And they said, "No way.
[1:09:12] We're just not going to do that. We'll
[1:09:13] just build our own. We'll do our own
[1:09:15] thing." We've heard it many times.
[1:09:20] But in the day in which we live, the
[1:09:21] only way, the only truth, the only life
[1:09:25] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; That's all. That is our boat. That's our
[1:09:30] ark for today. And and if we're willing
[1:09:33] to go that way, then we will actually be
[1:09:36] able to see that we ourselves have been
[1:09:40] quickened, who are dead in trespasses
[1:09:42] and sins. Without that, we're going to
[1:09:45] think that we're okay. Everything in our
[1:09:47] life is fine. We're born in the message.
[1:09:50] We're raised in the message. We never
[1:09:51] went into the world sinning. We never
[1:09:53] did anything like that. But you know
[1:09:54] what? There's still one thing that's an
[1:09:56] evil devil that loves to hide. I'll say
[1:09:58] it plainly in message homes, in message
[1:10:01] churches.
[1:10:03] Forgive me for even saying it this way,
[1:10:04] but I have to. As a pastor, that thing
[1:10:07] is called pride.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Pride. It is a devil. It's the worst sin
[1:10:13] of all because it hides in plain sight.
[1:10:16] People that have it, they don't believe
[1:10:18] they do. They think everything is fine.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; But everyone has to be quickened with
[1:10:26] quickening power. Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; And I just want to say tonight, brothers
[1:10:30] and sisters, hopefully if I sound maybe
[1:10:32] a little bit excited or a little bit
[1:10:34] rough, what I'm doing is I'm taking us
[1:10:36] and I'm trying to grab us and throw us
[1:10:39] on Elisha's bones, to throw us on this
[1:10:42] word of God, to throw us on this message
[1:10:45] to get that quickening power in our
[1:10:46] lives. Maybe there's someone here that
[1:10:48] doesn't have it. Maybe if we all got it,
[1:10:50] we'll all just be able to to sing and
[1:10:52] shout and and maybe have a little
[1:10:54] Pentecostal revival here. But for those
[1:10:56] people that maybe haven't experienced
[1:10:58] it, it is a real thing. This quickening
[1:11:00] power is fantastic. And you know the way
[1:11:03] it comes is simply by saying amen to the
[1:11:06] word. We heard it on the weekend just by
[1:11:08] being like Mary was. I don't have to
[1:11:10] explain it or understand it. I just need
[1:11:12] to say amen. Be it unto me according to
[1:11:14] the angel messenger's word.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And when that happens, there's a life
[1:11:19] that happens. Conception happens. And
[1:11:21] that life is only one life. It's not a
[1:11:23] denomination. It's not a version of the
[1:11:25] message of the hour. It's not even the
[1:11:28] message of the hour, even though it is,
[1:11:30] but it's Christ Jesus.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; That's what the message of the hour is.
[1:11:33] The Lord Jesus Christ. This quickening
[1:11:35] power that we're talking about. You hath
[1:11:38] he quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:11:41] and sins. Where in time past, ye walked
[1:11:44] according to the course of this world.
[1:11:46] Whether we were born in a perfect home
[1:11:49] and never had any problems, we still had
[1:11:51] to come to the place of accountability
[1:11:53] where we decide whether we want that
[1:11:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost or not.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; And if we choose not to, then what
[1:12:00] happens is we choose
[1:12:03] the mark of the beast
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; because that's already in us. Remember
[1:12:07] Job said, "My skin worms,
[1:12:11] they're already in us. This flesh is
[1:12:13] already corrupt." wherein in times past
[1:12:16] you walked according to the course of
[1:12:17] this world, according to the prince of
[1:12:19] the power of the air, the spirit that
[1:12:22] now workketh in the children of
[1:12:24] disobedience, among whom also we all had
[1:12:28] our conversation in times past in the
[1:12:31] lust of our flesh, fulfilling the
[1:12:33] desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[1:12:37] and were by nature the children of
[1:12:40] wrath, even as others. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; This is even the believers.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; We all have to have the baptism of the
[1:12:48] Holy Ghost. That's the differentiating
[1:12:50] factor.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; That is the difference. It's not because
[1:12:53] we're a part of a church. It's not
[1:12:55] because we're good people. If we grow up
[1:12:58] in a message home, the children get the
[1:13:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost through their
[1:13:03] parents for a space of time according to
[1:13:06] the message of the hour. That space of
[1:13:08] time is until the age of accountability.
[1:13:11] But as soon as that time comes where the
[1:13:13] child says, "I could do it or I don't
[1:13:16] want to do it." That's the
[1:13:17] accountability.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; That's where we need to say there is a
[1:13:22] dividing line. But I think it's
[1:13:24] beautiful because we can all say amen to
[1:13:26] these scriptures here. I believe. Verse
[1:13:29] four says, "But God, who is rich in
[1:13:31] mercy, for his great love, wherewith he
[1:13:34] loved us, even when we were dead in
[1:13:37] sins, hath quickened us together with
[1:13:40] Christ by grace are ye saved."
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Not because we've done anything, not
[1:13:45] because we've gone anywhere, because he
[1:13:47] called us before the foundation of the
[1:13:48] world. Verse six says, "And hath raised
[1:13:51] us up together and made us sit together
[1:13:54] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." How
[1:13:57] many people people feel like you're
[1:13:59] sitting in heaven right now?
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; I don't feel like I'm sitting in heaven,
[1:14:04] but his word says that I am. So I say,
[1:14:06] "Amen."
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; That's where I'm at. Satan doesn't want
[1:14:10] us believing that because he wants to be
[1:14:12] there and he will never be there because
[1:14:15] that spot specifically reserved for the
[1:14:17] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; I think that's so beautiful. Verse
[1:14:24] seven, that in the ages to come he might
[1:14:26] show the exceeding riches of his grace
[1:14:30] in his kindness toward us through Christ
[1:14:34] Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through
[1:14:38] faith because we have the faith in our
[1:14:40] hearts to mix with this word that's
[1:14:43] preached to us through our parents,
[1:14:46] through our church. Because we have that
[1:14:48] faith, we're able to say amen to the
[1:14:50] word and come to the recognition as
[1:14:52] children that we need to be baptized
[1:14:54] with the Holy Ghost. And when we are
[1:14:55] baptized with the Holy Ghost, we become
[1:14:57] quickened to this word for our day.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful.
[1:15:03] By grace are you saved through faith.
[1:15:06] And that not of yourselves,
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Not of yourselves. Not of ourselves.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; It's the gift of God.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; It's not of works.
[1:15:17] lest any man should boast.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Great.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; For we are his workmanship, created in
[1:15:23] Christ Jesus unto good works,
[1:15:26] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:15:30] should walk in them. Isn't that
[1:15:31] beautiful?
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; He knew that we would. He just waits for
[1:15:36] the time.
[1:15:38] It's so amazing. It's beyond our
[1:15:40] reasoning. We can't even really
[1:15:41] comprehend it. So many people would say,
[1:15:42] "Well, you know, we could just eat and
[1:15:44] drink. might as well be Mary like
[1:15:47] everyone else. Doesn't matter. He's just
[1:15:49] going to save me anyways, right? No,
[1:15:52] we're free moral agents. And he knows
[1:15:55] who will and who won't. And if we truly
[1:15:58] are that predestined one, if we truly
[1:16:01] are going to be quickened by his spirit,
[1:16:04] we will be quickened by his spirit. We
[1:16:06] will not put it off.
[1:16:09] For we are as workmanship created in
[1:16:11] Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
[1:16:13] hath before ordained that we should walk
[1:16:15] in them.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Wherefore remember that ye being in
[1:16:19] times past, Gentiles, every one of us
[1:16:22] here in the flesh, who are called the
[1:16:25] uncircumcision, by that which is called
[1:16:27] the circumcision of the flesh, made by
[1:16:29] hands,
[1:16:31] that at that time
[1:16:33] ye were without Christ
[1:16:36] before the Holy Ghost in our lives.
[1:16:39] Even though we know the word of God,
[1:16:40] without the Holy Ghost in our lives,
[1:16:42] we're aliens from the commonwealth of
[1:16:44] Israel and strangers from the covenants
[1:16:47] of the promise, having no hope and
[1:16:50] without God in the world.
[1:16:53] I think it's beautiful.
[1:16:56] I might have sounded hard on families,
[1:16:59] but you know, parents that do have the
[1:17:01] Holy Ghost, you are the Holy Ghost for
[1:17:02] your children. So the children are not
[1:17:04] lost
[1:17:06] even though we read it that way. If the
[1:17:08] children choose to reject getting the
[1:17:10] Holy Ghost, then that fits them.
[1:17:13] But now in Christ Jesus, ye who
[1:17:16] sometimes were far off are made nigh
[1:17:20] with the blood of Christ.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Now I have to say this. I do believe it
[1:17:26] with all my heart that even though a
[1:17:28] child maybe a child would actually grow
[1:17:31] up in a message home and have the desire
[1:17:33] to serve God with all their heart and
[1:17:35] actually take the steps towards God and
[1:17:38] truly get baptized in the name of the
[1:17:40] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:17:41] their sins so that they could receive
[1:17:42] the baptism of the true baptism of the
[1:17:44] Holy Ghost and and then maybe go a
[1:17:46] little bit weward because something
[1:17:47] happened. Maybe there's offenses that
[1:17:49] came. Maybe something happens in their
[1:17:50] life and they just don't see it yet.
[1:17:52] There's a time appointed of the father.
[1:17:54] We heard about it on the weekend.
[1:17:57] At that point, you can run, but you
[1:17:59] cannot hide from God.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; He will always find his children.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful.
[1:18:09] That's the God we serve.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; We're not lost. That's
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; right. Verse 14 says, "For he is our
[1:18:17] peace, who hath made both one, and hath
[1:18:20] broken down the middle wall of partition
[1:18:22] between us, having abolished in his
[1:18:25] flesh the emnity even the law of
[1:18:28] commandments contained in the ordinances
[1:18:31] for to make in himself of twain one new
[1:18:36] man." So making peace. Remember the very
[1:18:39] first order of business when Christ was
[1:18:42] on the cross and he bowed his head and
[1:18:45] said it's finished and gave up the
[1:18:46] ghost. He didn't just go up into heaven.
[1:18:49] He didn't go visit a friend. He went
[1:18:50] right into the temple and tore that veil
[1:18:53] and said there is now therefore no
[1:18:57] condemnation
[1:18:58] to those who walk
[1:19:00] after the spirit who are in Christ
[1:19:02] Jesus. I think it's just a beautiful
[1:19:05] thing. I hope it's okay if I just read
[1:19:07] this tonight just for this portion.
[1:19:10] Verse 16 says, "And that he might
[1:19:13] reconcile both unto God in one body by
[1:19:16] the cross, having slain the emnity
[1:19:19] thereby." He did it and came and
[1:19:22] preached peace to you which were a far
[1:19:25] off and to them that were nigh. Some
[1:19:28] were far and some were nigh. But
[1:19:30] everyone needed to have peace preached
[1:19:34] to them.
[1:19:35] It's so beautiful. For through him we
[1:19:39] both have access by one spirit unto the
[1:19:42] Father. Now therefore, ye are no more
[1:19:45] strangers and foreigners, but fellow
[1:19:47] citizens with the saints, and of the
[1:19:49] household of God, and are built upon the
[1:19:52] foundation of the apostles and the
[1:19:54] prophets, Jesus Christ himself, being
[1:19:57] the chief cornerstone, in whom all the
[1:20:00] building fitly framed together, groweth
[1:20:02] unto an holy temple in the Lord, in whom
[1:20:06] ye also are builded together for an
[1:20:09] habitation of God through the spirit.
[1:20:13] That is why we are here. So that we can
[1:20:16] be a habitation of God by his spirit.
[1:20:19] Isn't that beautiful?
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; You know, I was looking up this word
[1:20:23] quickening and quickening power. It has
[1:20:25] quickening power specifically has 103
[1:20:28] hits in the message search and uh it
[1:20:32] just I think it's neat to see some of
[1:20:34] these things. It's just maybe silly uh
[1:20:38] quirky, but it's neat. Quickening power
[1:20:41] 103 hits in a message search one time in
[1:20:44] 1963 and all the rest of them are in
[1:20:47] 1965.
[1:20:49] Brother Brandham never talked about
[1:20:50] quickening power before the seals were
[1:20:52] open.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Interesting.
[1:20:55] I believe it was kind of save for a time
[1:20:57] and a season. You know, I I just want to
[1:20:59] talk about the titles for a little bit
[1:21:00] here. I got a couple quotes that I'm
[1:21:02] going to bring. I don't know if it
[1:21:03] actually went through to the brothers.
[1:21:04] Did you get it? No. I always do that.
[1:21:06] It's in uh The Rising of the Sun. you'll
[1:21:09] be able to get them quite easily. But
[1:21:11] 1963, Brother Bradom, he preaches three
[1:21:14] kinds of believers. It's mentioned in
[1:21:16] there, quickening power. 1965 is all the
[1:21:19] rest of them. And and you know what's
[1:21:21] interesting? There's one, two, three,
[1:21:23] four, five, six messages that it's
[1:21:28] mentioned. Quickening power after 1963.
[1:21:31] Three kinds of believers at 1963. It is
[1:21:34] the rising of the sun, 1965. Does God
[1:21:37] ever change his mind about his word?
[1:21:41] Isn't that beautiful? If you think about
[1:21:42] it, quickening power, that quickening
[1:21:44] power that's given to us in and us who
[1:21:47] were once dead in sins and trespasses,
[1:21:50] hath he quickened. H we've raised up to
[1:21:52] sit with him in heavenly places by his
[1:21:54] quickening power. Does God ever change
[1:21:56] his mind about his word? He says it in
[1:21:58] here. Nope, he doesn't. And you know, he
[1:22:00] talks about it in that message about
[1:22:02] Balam and Bailac and how the prophet he
[1:22:04] he he wanted to be rich. He wanted to be
[1:22:06] famous and and the king wanted to find a
[1:22:09] way to curse Israel. And we know the
[1:22:11] story very well. And he asked God and
[1:22:13] God said no. First time he said no. And
[1:22:17] then he went and asked God again because
[1:22:18] he was wooed by the king. You know,
[1:22:20] we'll make you rich and famous. You
[1:22:22] know, we know the story.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Went and asked God and God said, "Hey,
[1:22:26] you know what? Go."
[1:22:28] Sounds like he changed his mind. But the
[1:22:31] prophet in the day in which we live, he
[1:22:32] said, "God doesn't change his mind. He
[1:22:33] sticks with his word." What he does is
[1:22:35] he allows his permissive will and then
[1:22:37] he turns it into his perfect will. But
[1:22:39] does God ever change his mind about his
[1:22:41] word? Not about you. Not about I. Praise
[1:22:43] the Lord. The next one is God's provided
[1:22:46] place of worship is Jesus Christ. This
[1:22:48] message of the hour, God's provided
[1:22:50] place of worship. It's not a
[1:22:51] denomination. It's not a destination. It
[1:22:54] is Jesus Christ himself.
[1:22:57] And you know, I I think the next one is
[1:22:58] so beautiful. It's proving his word. He
[1:23:00] talks about quickening power in that
[1:23:02] one. And brother Brandham, I I just love
[1:23:04] the way he brings it. It's such a simple
[1:23:05] way. He says how you can actually solve
[1:23:08] a problem in math. If you actually work
[1:23:11] it out on paper and you solve the
[1:23:13] problem, you can actually prove the
[1:23:15] problem by the answer that you come up
[1:23:18] with. You can actually reverse engineer
[1:23:20] it back to the actual question, the
[1:23:23] problem. And I think it's just a
[1:23:24] wonderful thing sometimes in life uh
[1:23:27] even as a believer it's important to be
[1:23:29] able to actually let him prove his word
[1:23:32] in our life but then actually prove that
[1:23:34] it was him proving his word
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; by the way the answer comes. The last
[1:23:39] one that he talks about is thinking
[1:23:41] man's filter. And uh it's just beautiful
[1:23:44] just little quirky thing to talk about
[1:23:46] the uh trivia I guess if you will about
[1:23:49] how the the the Lord dealt with his
[1:23:53] prophet in in the ministry of his
[1:23:55] prophet and and how it was near the end
[1:23:57] of his ministry that he began talking
[1:23:59] about quickening power. And I just hope
[1:24:02] that's not the same for me. But you know
[1:24:04] what? The Lord's will will be done. And
[1:24:07] uh whatever he wants to have happen is
[1:24:09] just beautiful. It's going to happen
[1:24:10] exactly the way he wants it to happen.
[1:24:13] In paragraph 269 out of it is the rising
[1:24:16] of the sun in 1965.
[1:24:20] He says, "Now then that fellow picked up
[1:24:24] that robe." And he's talking about
[1:24:26] Elisha.
[1:24:28] Now then that fellow picked up that
[1:24:32] robe. A type of the church again. See,
[1:24:36] picked up that robe. And you know,
[1:24:38] there's a lot of folks that got into the
[1:24:40] anointings of Elijah and Elisha and John
[1:24:44] the Baptist and they started to talk
[1:24:45] about mantels and getting into that
[1:24:48] business and you know there's there's
[1:24:50] prayer cloths and that's it. That's the
[1:24:52] way Paul did it in the New Testament and
[1:24:54] you can pray over handkerchiefs and you
[1:24:56] know what there's prayer cloths and they
[1:24:58] actually there's something about it. I'm
[1:25:01] not going to say there's power in the
[1:25:02] cloth. What I am going to say is there's
[1:25:04] power in the faith of the individual
[1:25:06] that gets that prayer cloth or or
[1:25:08] handkerchief. There is and and the
[1:25:11] prayer over those can actually increase
[1:25:14] when the person gets it and believes the
[1:25:16] same way that Paul taught it and uh
[1:25:19] praying over handkerchiefs. But anyways,
[1:25:20] I'm saying all this to say that there's
[1:25:22] people that want to get into the mantle
[1:25:24] and so on and so forth. But I think it's
[1:25:25] beautiful when we just look at this. I
[1:25:27] think the mantle is a type of the
[1:25:29] message. The message is a type of the
[1:25:31] mantle. And you know, Elisha, he he he
[1:25:33] understood that his his prophet, his
[1:25:35] master was going to go home. And and he
[1:25:38] watched it happen. And he was given a
[1:25:40] promise. He could have whatever he
[1:25:41] asked, and he said, "I want a double
[1:25:42] portion of that." I can't help but think
[1:25:44] that's the life of a believer. We would
[1:25:46] want a double portion of that as well.
[1:25:48] And and we know that's the promise for
[1:25:49] us. John 14:12.
[1:25:51] But in this quote here, he says, "Now
[1:25:53] then that fellow picked up that robe, a
[1:25:55] type of the church." Again, see, picked
[1:25:57] up that robe. Now he'd done twice the
[1:25:59] miracles which is a type of Christ and
[1:26:02] the church. See Elijah done four. He
[1:26:06] done eight. See now he was he was double
[1:26:10] the power cuz he asked for it. Now he
[1:26:14] didn't have twice as much strength
[1:26:16] spiritually speaking. He just did twice
[1:26:19] as many.
[1:26:21] I think it's really important to see
[1:26:23] that he is the same yesterday, today,
[1:26:24] and forever. John John 14:12 that it's
[1:26:27] exactly the type right here between
[1:26:29] Elijah and Elisha. Elijah done four, he
[1:26:32] done eight. He says, "Greater things
[1:26:35] than this shall I do shall you do." See,
[1:26:40] but he was so full of the quickening
[1:26:42] power and everything till he done all
[1:26:45] these double what Elisha done more than
[1:26:49] he did. And notice that he lived a life
[1:26:52] on up till 80 or 90 years old. He got
[1:26:55] old and he died. He died and they took
[1:26:58] him out and buried him.
[1:27:01] You know, well, that quickening power
[1:27:04] didn't leave him
[1:27:07] many, many years after that when the
[1:27:10] flesh had all rotted off his bones. He
[1:27:15] was laying in a tomb
[1:27:17] and they were packing a dead man one day
[1:27:19] and they saw the enemy and they just
[1:27:21] throwed this man in on the top of
[1:27:23] Elisha's bones. I love the way he
[1:27:25] dramatizes it, don't you? Amen.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; But you know, I don't believe there was
[1:27:30] any power on his bones. I believe there
[1:27:33] was an anointing maybe around his bones.
[1:27:36] Maybe some people would say in his
[1:27:37] bones. The prophet said their power was
[1:27:39] there. I'm not here to split hairs over
[1:27:41] that. What I do want to say is this
[1:27:44] spiritually, scripturally is typing the
[1:27:48] reminder that there's still power in the
[1:27:51] word of a prophet.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even though that prophet has
[1:27:55] passed on, he's gone on to his reward.
[1:27:58] There is still just as much power in
[1:28:00] that word, that prophetic utterance that
[1:28:02] came forward because it wasn't the
[1:28:04] prophets. That anointing was a prophetic
[1:28:06] utterance from God through his
[1:28:08] vindicated prophet to the age in which
[1:28:10] he lived. And this is an exact example,
[1:28:13] a type of what that is. And they were
[1:28:16] packing a dead man one day and they saw
[1:28:18] that enemy and they just throwed this
[1:28:19] man on the top of Elisha's bones. There
[1:28:22] was so much quickening power on those
[1:28:25] bones till the man jumped up to life
[1:28:27] again. Oh, it'll quicken your mortal
[1:28:30] body, though dead and rotten in the
[1:28:33] grave. And yet that quickening power
[1:28:36] rested over that dirt. I say, Lord, rest
[1:28:41] over this dirt tonight.
[1:28:44] Just just rest over me.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; My
[1:28:48] though dead and rotten in the grave. And
[1:28:51] yet that quickening power rested over
[1:28:53] that dirt. Hallelujah. He that raised up
[1:28:55] Christ from the dead also quickened your
[1:28:58] mortal body. The Elijah back there,
[1:29:01] Elisha. And Elijah, remember that dead
[1:29:04] man, that prophet full of the quickening
[1:29:06] power laying in the grave and rotted
[1:29:08] away. There was so much quickening power
[1:29:11] till they throwed a dead man on him and
[1:29:13] he come to life. He could still lay
[1:29:15] hands on the sick, couldn't he?
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. There you are.
[1:29:20] And remember,
[1:29:23] we are flesh of his flesh.
[1:29:26] Are we flesh of his flesh?
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, we are flesh of his flesh
[1:29:34] and bones of his bones.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; I got reading this today and just about
[1:29:39] had a little jubilee myself. You know, I
[1:29:42] was thinking about it and what what kind
[1:29:44] of swept over me and it might sound
[1:29:46] really corny, but I'm going to say it
[1:29:47] anyways. I think what we're doing here
[1:29:49] when we gather together this way is just
[1:29:51] making a reminder that you know what
[1:29:53] there is a wedding.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; There's a wedding that's taking place
[1:29:56] and that's taking place. Some people are
[1:29:59] already married and they're already
[1:30:02] well past hopefully not the honeymoon,
[1:30:04] but they're well on their way to to go
[1:30:07] into the marriage supper. And there's
[1:30:09] other people that are still entering the
[1:30:11] church to go down the aisle. And
[1:30:14] tonight, this is a type of the
[1:30:16] invitation for those people to come up
[1:30:18] to the altar and get married to the Lord
[1:30:20] Jesus Christ for themselves because this
[1:30:23] is the visible union of the bride of
[1:30:26] Jesus Christ and the Lord.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; And I say it that way even though the
[1:30:31] prophet said it's the invisible union.
[1:30:33] The invisible union is taking the book
[1:30:35] and eating it up. The visible union is
[1:30:37] that it changes us. We become a new
[1:30:39] creature in Christ Jesus because it's
[1:30:41] Christ Jesus living out for through us.
[1:30:44] We're no longer saying what's in it for
[1:30:45] me in our lives.
[1:30:48] We are flesh of his flesh, Jesus Christ.
[1:30:50] We are flesh of his flesh and bones of
[1:30:52] his bones. There's no way out of it.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; So if there was quickening power in a
[1:30:58] dead man with all his flesh rotted off,
[1:31:00] what about us today when we got flesh
[1:31:02] and bones life living out through us?
[1:31:05] Whose life is it? He says, "We're going
[1:31:07] to rise and that's all." You're going to
[1:31:09] rise. That's all. I love how he says it
[1:31:12] twice. Easter means more than just a
[1:31:15] tradition. Now, some would say this is
[1:31:16] just an Easter Easter message. And sure
[1:31:19] enough, he he did preach it at Easter.
[1:31:21] He also preached the Easter seal. But,
[1:31:23] you know, every single day of our lives
[1:31:25] is an Easter, isn't it?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in celebrating the
[1:31:29] resurrection of Jesus Christ in the life
[1:31:31] of his believers, we don't just wait for
[1:31:33] one day out of the year to celebrate his
[1:31:35] birth and and one day out of the year to
[1:31:38] celebrate his death and resurrection.
[1:31:40] No, it's every single day. Every single
[1:31:42] day of our lives. He goes on to say,
[1:31:45] "And this body may rot in the sea. It
[1:31:47] may rot in the ground. There may be not
[1:31:49] a spoonful of ashes, but she's coming
[1:31:51] forth."
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:53] I just love it because even if we can't
[1:31:55] see it, even if we don't understand it,
[1:31:57] even if we don't feel like it,
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; there's a prophetic utterance that says
[1:32:02] it's going to happen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; God through his prophet to this age said
[1:32:06] it's going to happen.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; She's coming forth.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; For the spirit that raised up my Lord
[1:32:13] from the dead has quickened this mortal
[1:32:17] body. It's the greatest experience. It's
[1:32:19] the greatest miracle when we can become
[1:32:21] a new creature in Christ Jesus. It
[1:32:24] really is. Seeing someone raised from
[1:32:26] the dead is one thing, but boy oh boy,
[1:32:28] when when you become a new creature in
[1:32:30] Christ Jesus, it changes everything.
[1:32:33] But she's coming forth. He says, "For
[1:32:35] the spirit that raised up my Lord from
[1:32:36] the dead has quickened this mortal body.
[1:32:38] It's quickened your mortal body." It
[1:32:43] does something to us.
[1:32:45] And that's where I I think it's so
[1:32:47] beautiful. While I was getting into this
[1:32:48] before I went down to Ohio, and that is
[1:32:51] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers.
[1:32:52] You know, he says in the church age book
[1:32:54] that, you know, the the the mysteries
[1:32:56] contained in those seals, it will
[1:32:59] literally turn
[1:33:01] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:33:04] faith of the Pentecostal fathers.
[1:33:06] Literally. We'll probably get into a
[1:33:08] little bit on Sunday, but what does that
[1:33:10] mean? I I think it's beautiful. If we
[1:33:12] just go and read the book of Acts, I I
[1:33:14] believe that's exactly what it is. And I
[1:33:16] believe brother Brandham even says that,
[1:33:18] you know, they'll write another book of
[1:33:20] Acts behind it when that branch puts
[1:33:22] when that tree puts forth another
[1:33:23] branch. But she's coming forth. He says,
[1:33:26] "For the spirit that raised up my Lord
[1:33:28] from the dead is quickened this mortal
[1:33:29] body." It's quickening your mortal body.
[1:33:31] And we are his beneficiaries of his
[1:33:34] resurrection. We have the earnest of his
[1:33:37] his resurrection in our lives. We have
[1:33:40] that quarter. We have that token. We can
[1:33:43] go and buy that loaf of bread. Amen.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; His policy of eternal life that I talk
[1:33:48] so much about, you know, no wonder he
[1:33:51] said, "Fear not."
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; For as Paul said, "Death, where is your
[1:33:55] sting grave? Where is your victory? I'm
[1:33:57] full of quickening power." You know,
[1:33:59] when the doctor says you're going to
[1:34:00] die, you can say, "No, I'm not. Maybe I
[1:34:04] got to lay this flesh down, but who
[1:34:05] cares?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; To live is Christ, and to die is gain."
[1:34:09] Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; But when the devil comes around and
[1:34:13] says, "You're going to die."
[1:34:16] Paul said, "Death, where is your sting?"
[1:34:18] Do we believe like Paul tonight?
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Are we able to say that in the face of
[1:34:23] the devil when he comes around and says
[1:34:24] that through a doctor?
[1:34:26] Death, where is your sting? Grave, where
[1:34:28] is your victory? I'm full of quickening
[1:34:31] power.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; I'm full of quickening power. If God
[1:34:36] wants me to live, I can't die.
[1:34:39] Right.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to happen cuz I'm full of
[1:34:44] quickening power. And you know, brothers
[1:34:45] and sisters, that quickening power is
[1:34:47] the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; That's why Brother Barry harps on it.
[1:34:51] That's what we're talking about. That's
[1:34:53] what this whole message is about.
[1:34:54] Getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:56] That's what Noah's message was about.
[1:34:58] Get in the boat. Tonight, we're saying
[1:35:00] get in the boat. Get the baptism of the
[1:35:02] Holy Ghost. And And if you got it,
[1:35:04] that's great. But if you don't, get it.
[1:35:06] Get it with all you're getting. Just
[1:35:08] like we had Solomon here in Proverbs
[1:35:11] say, "You need to get understanding, my
[1:35:14] son. Incline thyself to my words. Listen
[1:35:17] to what I'm telling you. Follow
[1:35:19] instruction and get wisdom. Get it with
[1:35:22] all thy getting." That wisdom is not
[1:35:24] just knowledge.
[1:35:27] You know, we we were my
[1:35:31] Paul said, "Death, where is your sting?
[1:35:32] Grave, where is your victory? I'm full
[1:35:34] of quickening power. Thanks be to God
[1:35:36] who gives us victory through our Lord
[1:35:38] Jesus Christ. Yes, sir. Quickening
[1:35:41] power. Oh my.
[1:35:44] Just made me think, you know,
[1:35:47] Daniel 11
[1:35:49] at the end time, right near the end,
[1:35:52] Daniel had an opportunity to see. John
[1:35:55] was able to see. We heard about it on
[1:35:57] the weekend. Daniel was told, "You know
[1:35:59] what, Daniel? It's not for you. It's not
[1:36:02] for you in your day. Just don't worry.
[1:36:04] You're going to live to be a full age.
[1:36:06] Everything is going to be fine for you.
[1:36:07] Just just just look away. Go your way.
[1:36:10] It's for someone else in another time
[1:36:12] somewhere down the road. John was told,
[1:36:14] "Seal up those things because they're
[1:36:16] not for you."
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; But you know, Daniel in the book of
[1:36:20] Daniel, he says something really
[1:36:21] interesting. He gave us a little
[1:36:23] snippet. I think it's beautiful. He
[1:36:25] allowed one thing to come through that
[1:36:27] that would happen that we would be able
[1:36:28] to understand. And it's Daniel 11:32.
[1:36:32] And it says, "A, and such as do wickedly
[1:36:35] against the covenant shall he corrupt by
[1:36:39] flatteries." And we know that's going on
[1:36:41] with the Catholic Church. That's what
[1:36:43] he's talking about in here, the beast
[1:36:44] system. He's going to corrupt by
[1:36:46] flatteries. And it's just like that in
[1:36:48] the world. But the people that do know
[1:36:51] their God shall be strong
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; and do exploits.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; They're not going to be weak. They're
[1:36:58] they're not going to be downtrodden.
[1:37:00] They're not going to be underhandedly
[1:37:03] treated in the life in which they're
[1:37:05] living. And you know, we have this
[1:37:06] opportunity and I personally believe it
[1:37:09] that is exactly the way the prophet said
[1:37:11] it. There is going to be a sudden secret
[1:37:14] going away of the bride. It's not going
[1:37:17] to be uh bolt-action semiotic automatic
[1:37:20] rifles. There's no such thing as that,
[1:37:22] by the way. But it's not going to be
[1:37:23] weaponry chasing people and hunting them
[1:37:25] down like dogs to push them into the
[1:37:28] rapture of the church.
[1:37:30] Brother Brandham has asked the question,
[1:37:32] what are they going to preach after the
[1:37:33] rapture? And what does he say? Do you
[1:37:36] remember?
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; They're going to preach the same thing.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; That's why they're not on the rapture.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; They're going to think that they're
[1:37:44] saved. Going on baptizing, singing,
[1:37:48] thinking they're getting saved, and the
[1:37:50] church of the living God has already
[1:37:52] gone home. She's already gone to the
[1:37:54] wedding supper, to the marriage supper.
[1:37:55] And we know that the word says they're
[1:37:58] going to cry and lament and say, 'Lord,
[1:38:00] open to us. Come on. We need your
[1:38:01] spirit. We need more of you. And he's
[1:38:03] going to say, "You had your chance, man.
[1:38:06] There was no nothing hindering you. You
[1:38:08] had the full open word. You had all of
[1:38:10] the message apps on your phone. You had
[1:38:12] it on your computers. You had churches
[1:38:14] wide open. You could worship in spirit
[1:38:16] and in truth without hindrance.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; But you chose not to."
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; What a place to be.
[1:38:25] But there's some some people that do
[1:38:28] know their God. I think it's beautiful.
[1:38:30] And that's who we're talking to tonight.
[1:38:32] And and she's strong and and she does
[1:38:34] exploits.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; She does exploits. We're not looking for
[1:38:38] mighty signs and wonders. We live them.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; We are them.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; If you are a believer of this word, you
[1:38:44] know what I'm talking about. There's
[1:38:45] things in your life that you can't
[1:38:47] explain. They just happen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Because that's the God we serve. I'll
[1:38:51] call them musicians.
[1:38:54] Paragraph 294, Brother Brandham, he says
[1:38:56] that same quickening power of God, that
[1:39:00] same quickening power of God presented
[1:39:03] in both of these prophets, look at their
[1:39:06] names are almost the same. Elisha,
[1:39:10] Elijah.
[1:39:11] I love how he does this. See, the bride
[1:39:14] and the groom,
[1:39:17] one of them is Mr. Jesus, the other one
[1:39:20] is Mrs. Jesus.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. You see almost the same just
[1:39:26] between the he and she. See Elijah and
[1:39:30] look how it's represented here. Now
[1:39:33] Elisha was taken up in the rapture
[1:39:36] represents the church. All right. Elijah
[1:39:39] and Elisha rested until the
[1:39:43] resurrection. See it's just like a bird
[1:39:46] needs two wings to balance herself. See,
[1:39:50] the church was represented right there
[1:39:53] in those two prophets. For we which are
[1:39:55] alive and remain to the coming of the
[1:39:57] Lord shall not hinder them which are
[1:39:59] asleep.
[1:40:01] For the trumpet of God shall sound. I
[1:40:03] love how brother Brandham says this now.
[1:40:05] I'm I'm I'm not going to be able to
[1:40:07] finish, but I'm just going to do this.
[1:40:09] I'm going to say it this way. Isn't it
[1:40:10] interesting that brother Brandham in the
[1:40:12] message the rapture he says he goes into
[1:40:14] it he talks about in Thessalonians the
[1:40:16] shout the voice and the trump of God but
[1:40:21] in here when he's talking about this
[1:40:23] quickening power this level of
[1:40:24] quickening power he's only talking about
[1:40:26] the trumpet of God because the shout and
[1:40:27] the voice have already taken place and
[1:40:29] that's why there is a quickening power
[1:40:31] brothers and sisters you know he says it
[1:40:33] we read about it or heard about it on
[1:40:35] the weekend sometimes you got to read
[1:40:36] between the lines but why isn't he
[1:40:37] saying here at this level of his message
[1:40:40] that first there's a shout, then there's
[1:40:41] a voice. It's just the trump of God.
[1:40:44] That's all that's going to take place.
[1:40:45] For we which are alive and remain to the
[1:40:47] coming of the Lord shall not hinder them
[1:40:48] which are asleep. For the trumpet of God
[1:40:50] shall sound. Both wings shall come
[1:40:53] together and will fly away. Hallelujah.
[1:40:56] Fly away. Cuz what? In the living or
[1:40:58] dead, that quickening power still lives.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; That's out of It is the rising of the
[1:41:07] sun. I I've got so much more here. I'm I
[1:41:11] would just keep going. I don't want to
[1:41:12] keep us late tonight. I know we're back
[1:41:14] in the rhythm of school and the
[1:41:17] pressures of life. And brothers and
[1:41:19] sisters, I just want to encourage us to
[1:41:21] remember who we are.
[1:41:23] As dark as this world gets, don't let it
[1:41:25] get you down.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Let's not become callous.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Let's not lose feeling of love one for
[1:41:32] another and and the consideration and
[1:41:34] concern for one another.
[1:41:36] The devil wants us to do that. He wants
[1:41:38] us to get just distracted and hung up on
[1:41:41] a situation or a problem and a
[1:41:43] circumstance and just get us going over
[1:41:45] and over and over on that. And as long
[1:41:47] as we'll do that, we're just distracted
[1:41:49] from recognizing that quickening power
[1:41:51] is inside of us. When that happens, just
[1:41:54] remember it's a devil.
[1:41:56] He's the one that comes in and tries to
[1:41:58] break unity. And if we have a
[1:42:00] distraction like that, just remember
[1:42:02] it's a devil. And all we have to do is
[1:42:05] rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:07] We don't have to yell and scream. We
[1:42:08] don't have to kick our feet and stomp.
[1:42:11] We just have to soundly rebuke him in
[1:42:13] the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; And remember that you have this
[1:42:17] quickening power in your life. We're not
[1:42:19] looking for the shout. We're not even
[1:42:22] looking for the voice.
[1:42:24] We're just looking for the trump of God
[1:42:26] in the day in which we live. If you
[1:42:29] listen to the message, the rapture,
[1:42:30] you'll hear Brother Bradom explain that
[1:42:31] very clearly.
[1:42:34] Maybe stand with me as we close tonight.
[1:42:39] That same quickening power of God
[1:42:42] is in you and I. Let's just bow.
[1:42:46] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank
[1:42:48] you for this quickening power.
[1:42:51] Lord, we know that it's truly your
[1:42:53] spirit. It's the baptism of your Holy
[1:42:55] Spirit that's only given by full
[1:42:59] obedience to your complete word.
[1:43:02] That's what entitles us to the token.
[1:43:05] And Father, we just thank you for that,
[1:43:07] Lord. Thank you for the revelation that
[1:43:08] you give us, Lord. the quickening power
[1:43:11] of your word to our souls, Father, that
[1:43:14] that gives us the understanding, Lord,
[1:43:17] the the the the finite understanding
[1:43:20] that we are the ones that you have
[1:43:23] called,
[1:43:25] not by anything that we've done, Lord.
[1:43:28] Oh, Father, lest we boast, just knowing
[1:43:31] that you have done it all for us, Lord.
[1:43:34] You paid the price. And father, you took
[1:43:37] all of our sin, all of our
[1:43:39] transgression, and nailed it to your
[1:43:41] cross.
[1:43:43] Oh, Father, how could we ever thank you
[1:43:45] enough?
[1:43:47] Lord Jesus, we just ask that you would
[1:43:49] go with us now as we go our separate
[1:43:50] ways.
[1:43:52] Father, I pray that we would just
[1:43:54] consider this quickening power in our
[1:43:56] lives and Lord, how we're able to
[1:43:59] display it in this world, Father. Lord,
[1:44:02] that we would recognize that when people
[1:44:05] see us, they're not actually seeing us.
[1:44:08] They're seeing you. When people
[1:44:10] persecute us, they're not actually
[1:44:12] persecuting us. They're persecuting you,
[1:44:16] oh, Father. And when people speak ill of
[1:44:18] us, they're not actually speaking ill of
[1:44:21] us.
[1:44:22] They're speaking ill of you, Father. I
[1:44:25] pray that each and every one of us would
[1:44:27] truly have the baptism of your Holy
[1:44:29] Spirit. And father, if there's anybody
[1:44:31] here tonight that doesn't, Father, know
[1:44:33] you and the power of your resurrection
[1:44:35] and this quickening power. Oh, Father, I
[1:44:37] pray that tonight would be the night,
[1:44:39] Father, that they would begin to
[1:44:41] consider that the gift is for them as
[1:44:43] well. And Father, any one of us that
[1:44:46] maybe has just become distracted in our
[1:44:49] lives, Lord, and maybe has just let
[1:44:51] things slip a little bit, Father, help
[1:44:53] us to just raise our cup unto you,
[1:44:55] Father, and invite you, Lord, to just
[1:44:57] top us up even right now before we leave
[1:44:59] this building that we would have enough
[1:45:01] of that quickening power in our lives,
[1:45:03] Father. You told us through your prophet
[1:45:05] to this generation that we need more
[1:45:07] quickening power, more faith in this age
[1:45:10] than any other age because it takes
[1:45:12] rapturing faith, Lord. Oh, Father, the
[1:45:15] only way that's going to happen is by
[1:45:16] your spirit. We pray that you would just
[1:45:18] be with us, Lord. Keep your hand upon
[1:45:20] each one of us now as we go our separate
[1:45:22] ways. Thank you for touching Sister
[1:45:24] Stella. Lord, thank you for meeting the
[1:45:26] needs of our friends in the Netherlands.
[1:45:28] Oh, Father, thank you for meeting each
[1:45:30] and every need behind the uplift hands
[1:45:33] tonight. We just commit them all into
[1:45:35] your hands now for your glory. In Jesus
[1:45:38] Christ's name we pray.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:45:44] [Music]
[1:45:46] Oh, turn
[1:45:49] your eyes
[1:45:52] upon Jesus.
[1:45:55] [Music]
[1:45:58] Look full
[1:46:00] in his wonderful
[1:46:04] face.
[1:46:09] And the things
[1:46:12] of the earth
[1:46:14] will grow strangely
[1:46:17] [Music]
[1:46:18] dim
[1:46:20] in the light
[1:46:23] of his glory
[1:46:26] and grace. Turn your eyes upon him
[1:46:29] tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:46:32] Turn
[1:46:34] your eyes
[1:46:37] upon Jesus.
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:44] Look full
[1:46:46] in his wonderful
[1:46:50] face
[1:46:57] of the earth
[1:47:00] will grow strangeely
[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:04] dim
[1:47:06] in the light
[1:47:09] of his glory
[1:47:12] and praise.
[1:47:16] Can we sing that song? I feel the pull
[1:47:18] tonight.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; I feel the pull.
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:27] At night
[1:47:29] I lay
[1:47:32] and I begin to cry.
[1:47:41] And my mind just fails to know exactly
[1:47:48] why.
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:52] I can't explain
[1:47:55] with talk or pen. The spirit is groaning
[1:48:02] deep within.
[1:48:05] It must be God here in my soul. Cuz I
[1:48:12] feel the P.
[1:48:17] I feel the P.
[1:48:23] I hear the call.
[1:48:28] [Applause]
[1:48:30] And God's spirit's
[1:48:34] moving
[1:48:35] me to give my own.
[1:48:43] He speaks to me. Hallelujah.
