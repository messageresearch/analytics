[0:00] Watch an eagle fly today. Soaring on
[0:03] wings of golden gray, he glided upon the
[0:07] wind so high, carefree,
[0:11] unbound, with regal pride. He seemed the
[0:15] freest heart in flight, yet he even he
[0:18] knows not my height.
[0:21] Though his wings may kiss the blue and
[0:24] ride the heaven's deepest
[0:26] blue, he knows not what my soul feels
[0:30] when Jesus comes and breaks my
[0:33] seals. For I, a child redeemed by grace,
[0:37] am soaring beyond time's dwelling place.
[0:43] The eagle flies though his
[0:46] wings The eagle flies yet bound he's
[0:49] still he's bound to nature's pool to
[0:52] earth's own ground but I have been
[0:54] loosed from sin's dark chain from self
[0:57] from flesh from inward shame no longer
[1:01] clothed in rags of pride but robed in
[1:04] Christ beyond sanctified
[1:07] no voice of guilt no whisper sly I no
[1:11] fear beneath the serpent's lie can hold
[1:14] me from my place above. I've tasted
[1:18] perfect holy love. The law fulfilled.
[1:22] The curse undone. The war is over.
[1:25] Victory won. Free from the grave. Free
[1:29] from fear and night. All things now
[1:31] brought into the light. My thoughts
[1:34] confined. My steps made sure. My soul
[1:38] proved clean. My heart made pure. No
[1:42] veil remains. No shadow hides. The
[1:45] living word within me
[1:48] rides. Oh eagle, noble in your flight.
[1:52] You rise on wings of sheer delight. Yet
[1:55] you know not the liberty bestowed by
[1:58] Christ who dwells in me. I've been
[2:01] raised from dust and sod to reign as
[2:04] son, a child of God.
[2:07] True freedom breeds where spirit dwells.
[2:11] Where living water breaks the wells. Not
[2:13] just the fly but to become one with the
[2:17] father. Spirit son. This is liberty. The
[2:21] world cannot see. The holy blood that
[2:24] purchased me. So let me fly but not
[2:28] alone. I mount the wings that lead me
[2:31] home. Beyond the eagle's elevated
[2:33] heights to where my savior and king
[2:36] awaits. This is my freedom, pure and
[2:39] true. Not just to fly, but to be made
[2:42] new. Lord bless you.
[2:45] [Applause]
