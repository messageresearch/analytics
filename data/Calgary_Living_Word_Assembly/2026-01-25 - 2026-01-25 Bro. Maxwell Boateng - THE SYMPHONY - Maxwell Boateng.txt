Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, what an honor and a privilege it is to worship you, Lord, in spirit and in truth. Father, to recognize that many people will claim that that's what they can do. But, Father, only by the revelation of who we are, is that even possible, Father, this morning, we just want to commit each and every one of our lives into your hands for your care, Lord. Father, we just ask Lord Jesus that we could strip ourselves of our humanity. Lord, of our own ideas and our own traditions and our own teachings, Lord, everything that we think we might know, Lord, help us to push it aside and give preeminence to you, Lord Jesus, to your spirit as you want to move in our midst, Lord.

Father, help us, Lord, to take the words that are spoken today, Father, for real. That they are the difference between life and death. Father, we pray that you would just be glorified, Lord, in the songs that we sing today, Lord Jesus. Father, we pray for those that can't be here today, wherever they are, Lord Jesus. Father, maybe they're sick at home, Lord, and unable to come. Father, maybe they're hurt and indifferent, Lord, and just deciding not to come wherever they are, Lord. We pray that you would just pour out a blessing upon them, Father. Lord, that they can't even contain. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray for those who are on the mission field for you this morning, Lord.

And we know that that's what you desire, Lord. That's what you've been longing for, Lord. Individuals that will just completely sell out to themselves, Lord, and just take you at your word and walk forward in it, Lord. Bless our brother Max as he comes.

Take your seats and we'll sing the first verse. We're going to call the choir up as we're singing it. There quite a quite a time frame for them to set up. If you'd come as we sing the song. Well, I was sitting alone and wondering about what I'm supposed to do. Can't deny the time I made mistakes and hide from him. and you but I know that deep within my soul I feel sorry for I just cry and say forgive me Lord forgive me again you justify justified you have not done it in the first place you Justify. Oh, justify. Justify. You have not done it in the first place to justify. He looked at your perfect picture without blame, spark, or wrinkle. He didn't look at you where you are now.

Your love came first before I knew the cross you carried. free. And now I'm free at last. I'll freely give as I've been given. for everything you've done and everything to God. I will praise you. to glorify your name forever and your name. Lord, I will sing your praise. Should words fall short, may they fall in this worship until all that I am breaks in reverence at your feet. for everything you've done. Every praise you glorify your name forever and your name.

Oh, and I will praise you in the promise and the pain. For as long as life remains, still I will sing your praise. Still I will sing your praise. God bless you. Um, the song I want to sing this morning is titled God Will Work It Out. Um, and it's been on my mind, I would say, for the whole of the year so far. Um, and as as I think about the song, the scripture that I meditate on is be still and know that I am God. And sometimes I'm restless and I'm obsessive about the outcomes of things. But um I could just be still before I knew my name. Before I drew a break, he was making ways for me. Now in every day and each and every step, he's still making ways for me. When my heart is full of doubt. Feels like faith is running out. I've come too far to turn around. I know God will work it out. &gt;&gt; God will work it out. One thing I know, one thing I found is my God will work it out. Yes. &gt;&gt; Pushing past defeat, fighting to believe. He's making ways for me. &gt;&gt; He will let me down. Never ever leave. He's still making ways for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When my heart is full of doubt, feels like fate is running out. I've come too far to turn around. I know God will work it out. God will work it out. One thing I know, one thing I found is my God will work it out. I know he will. God will work it out. My God will work it out. One thing I know, one thing I found is my God will work it out. Be still my soul. Be still and know leaning in. Take hold in God alone. Be still my soul. Be still and know lean in. Take hold in God alone. Be still my soul. Be still and knowing. Take hold in God alone because God will work it out. God always works it out. &gt;&gt; One thing I know, one thing I found is my God will work it out. I say that God will work it out. God will work it out. One thing I know, one thing I found is my God will work it out. I sing it again. God will work it out. God will work it out. One thing I know, one thing I found is my God will work it out. One thing I know, one thing I found is my God will always work it out. Amen. God bless you. Stand with me if you would. Couple of wonderful specials, reminding us to praise him. I was thinking of as our sister was call singing David's comment. His scripture was, "I've yet I'm I've young, I've been old. I've yet to see the righteous forsaken or godly baking bread. He always works it out. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not a young guy. I'm not an old guy, but I'm old enough &gt;&gt; to know &gt;&gt; that God always works it out. &gt;&gt; Always does. Always does. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's wonderful. What a confession this is. Oh yes. I'm a child of the king. Not just a king. Sing it with me this morning. Sing this chorus and one more chorus and I'll call our pastor. Oh yes. Oh yes. I'm a child of the king. His royal blood. It now flows through my veins. And God who was rich and poor sing. Praise God. Praise God. I'm a child. Oh yes. Oh yes. I'm a child of the king. He will ro my and sing. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. I'm a child of the king. That's a little clap offering of praise again. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. I was wretched. Now I'm a child of the Lord. How great you are this morning. Brother Barry, would you come? Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in this place. This place invited this morning. Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in this place. Mercy and grace are well. Do you mean that today? Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit, thou art in this place. Heat. Heat. Heat. Amen. Amen. song is so wonderful because when we sing that song, some people might say he's welcome in this building, but the believer sings he's welcome in this place. &gt;&gt; In the place that he created to dwell, &gt;&gt; we just have a couple of requests that we would like to bring before the Lord for prayer. We want to pray for brother Richard Nixon in South Africa. his sister Felicity Hines father and he has to undergo surgery for internal bleeding. So we want to remember brother Richard Nixon. We also have a request for a brother named Hugh Quan I believe. He's a friend of the Ajimies and uh he has real severe cancer and uh is in a bad condition and we just want to remember him. Hugh Quan and also we want to pray for brother William Pavick this morning. He has a need in his life. But we'll pray for him in a moment. If you have a need this morning, maybe just make it known unto the Lord by way of an uplift hand. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, this morning we are so thankful that we've come to your house, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, maybe What's more, we're so thankful that you called us &gt;&gt; to your house, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, that you've given us an ear to hear what your spirit says to the church in the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; Father, this morning, we just want to give you all the praise and all the glory. If there's any good thing, Lord Jesus, in our lives, it comes from you. And we thank you for that. We acknowledge that, Lord. We acknowledge you, Father. And Lord Jesus, we just want to remember these requests, Lord Jesus, that we mentioned. Father, this this brother named Hugh Quan, the friend of the Ajimies, Lord Jesus, we pray that in this condition, Lord, that you would touch him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, if it's your will for him to raise up off of the bed, Father, we just thank you for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, if it's your will to take him home, Father, we thank you for that as well. But Lord, before that can happen, we ask that perhaps he could come to know you in the power of your resurrection, Lord Jesus. The way that the Ajimies have, Lord, that they could literally witness your life to this brother, Father. And Lord, we'll be careful to give you the praise. Lord, we want to stand united with our our our friends and our brother and sisters, Lord Jesus, in South Africa, Lord, for brother Richard Nixon, Lord, that needs a touch from you. We pray that you would minister, Father, your surgical hands to this brother, Father. That you would, Lord Jesus, just touch him, Lord, in the name of Jesus. That you would make him whole again. Father, this morning we want to remember each and every need that was made known unto you by way of an uplift hand. We know that you're more than able, Lord Jesus. We know that you're here. We've already declared this meeting to be in your name. We thank you for coming, Lord Jesus. Father, we didn't invite you just to have a show today, Lord. We've invited you so that we could acknowledge you, Lord. So that we could greet you with a kiss, Lord Jesus. Father, so that we could anoint you with oil, Lord Jesus, so that we could welcome you in our midst to wash your feet, Lord Jesus, and fully appreciate you today, Lord. We pray that you would feel that welcome in our midst, Father. &gt;&gt; We pray that you would be glorified now, Father, in all that's said and done. Bless our brother Max, Lord, as he brings the word. Father, we just want to ask, Lord, also that you would touch Sister Mary Carpenter. She's requested prayer. Her husband has, Lord, we know that you're more than able to, Lord Jesus, minister your grace to those folks down in the pass. Lord, we pray that you would be with those in Lethbridge once again. And Father, we just want to ask that you would, Lord, be with us now. In all things, we give you thanks. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't mind just standing for a moment, brother William has asked I think a notable thing and uh many times it can be overlooked in the church but he asked something that I believe as believers we believe this with all our heart &gt;&gt; and and if we don't we ought to &gt;&gt; because it's exactly according to the word of God &gt;&gt; and it's exactly according to what the prophet for our day said. &gt;&gt; Yes. James 5:13 says, "Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any merry? Let him sing songs. Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So that's what we want to do. I would just like to invite brother Max to come at this time and I'd like to invite the elders of the church to come at this time and we're going to anoint brother William with oil and we are going to pray for our brother. &gt;&gt; We know that the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up &gt;&gt; and if he has committed sins they shall be forgiven him. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? This prayer is not exclusive. It's not specifically ordained just for brother William. It's for every single one of the children of the Lord. And I think it's just notable because the prophet said it very clearly that if we believe this scripture to be true, we would do exactly what brother Williams doing right now, calling for the elders of the church, get anointed with oil and prayed for, and that would be that. Amen. &gt;&gt; So this morning I just want to take the word of the living God &gt;&gt; to task &gt;&gt; and ask him for our brother. Will you pray with me this morning? &gt;&gt; We'll just invite the brothers to come. needs to operate before that takes place. Lord Jesus Christ Father Lord Jesus, what an honor and a privilege it is to stand for your word in the day in which we father Lord to see the desire in the heart of a brother that would just recognize the promise that lays there. And Father, let it not lay there dormant, but to claim it as his own. And Father, this morning we stand here united just Lord, not as the elders alone, but as a body of believers here, taking you at your word, Father. And Lord Jesus, we can't bring this to pass. But Father, we know that when we come according to your word, that Lord Jesus, all things are possible. So this morning, Father, according to the profession of our brother's faith, Lord Jesus, according to your word, Father, we pray over our brother, knowing that he has been anointed with oil. And Lord Jesus, that's that according to your word, we commit him into your hands, Father. that Lord Jesus even before the surgeon would go to work on him that Lord perhaps Father you would come by his way even right now this morning Lord Jesus and you would fix the problem and Lord Jesus we know the doctor he can declare that something has already taken place and Father we call upon you to see that today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we commit brother William into your hands father we thank you for his testimony Lord sometimes we have to go Lord Jesus the long way around we've got to go through the backside of the desert. But Lord Jesus, if we could just get your spirit within us, Father, we know that all things are possible. So, Father, today we just commit Brother William and all of this need into your hands, Father, according to your word. Oh, Father, we thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing that chorus one more time as we call upon brother Max to come and just be a conduit to minister this word to us fresh once again. Just like to welcome all of the visitors here today as well. My goodness, I feel like I could preach today, but I certainly thank the Lord for his goodness and his mercy. Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in this place. Holy Spirit, thou art welcome. this place. One more time just Heat. Heat. Heat. Let's just sing it to him one more time. Oh, Holy Spirit, you're welcome.

Amen. this morning. I &gt;&gt; Tyler 110 S has been fighting &gt;&gt; and he's been fighting the whole week, but this was just it's been a battle just be able to come and and and speak and especially for the service this morning. It's been a battle. Yesterday I felt like this wasn't the direction I had to go and and begin to pray and seek the face of the Lord and and just begin to look at different parts and begin to go in different direction. But the Lord brought me back again to the the same thing again. And and I I don't know what the Lord has is doing, but I've had a hard time putting the service together. And uh even back in the office just still struggling with it. But you know, when God is fixing to move, Satan tried to disturb us. &gt;&gt; He was, man. And so I believe that God is fixing to do something this morning. And so let's be under expectation. and don't look at me. It's not about me this morning. It's about him. Let's open our hearts to him this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we said yesterday, we do bring greetings from Edmonton from my pastor, brother Ed.

Let's take a Bible. Say, Amen. Let's go to the book of Isaiah. Amen. The book of Isaiah this morning. Let's go to Isaiah chapter 60. A very famil we we desiring that the Lord will speak to us. Amen. Isaiah chapter 60 and we just read the first two verses. Amen. Isaiah 60 first two verses. Zise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add his blessing to the reason of the word. Amen. We we may have a seat. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Arise and shine. Amen. For your light has come and the glory of the Lord. Amen. Is upon thee. Amen. Amen. That is a promise to the believer. Amen. That's something that we believe. Amen. This morning, I just want to speak to you for a moment on on the people of the symphony. Amen. &gt;&gt; The people of the symphony. Amen. And and again, it's been a struggle, but we we trust in the Lord this morning. Amen. The people of the symphony. The scripture said that we shall arise and shine. Amen. For the for the glory of the Lord is risen upon us. Amen. And they will live in a season of darkness. Amen. And it is a grow darkness. Amen. But in the midst of this grow darkness, there is a light. Amen. that that is is is to be shown in this season in this hour of darkness. Amen. We know amen as as brother Brandon will will will draw a church to ages. Amen. We know that this age is the darkest of it all. Amen. As the is the darkest of it all as the light begins, you know begin to dim them as the ages go by. We come to a place where it's very very dark. And but we know that in the darkness there is something that is powerful than the darkness. Amen. And that is the light. Amen. No matter how dark a room is, amen. When light shines, amen, the darkness has to scatter. Amen. Light has got a greater power, amen, than the darkness. Amen. But but this morning, Amen. as we we begin to build on this thought. Amen. I I want to bring it through. Amen. The the thought of a symphony. Amen. If that would be all right. Amen. And we just want to take a little journey this morning. Amen. As we as we look at these scriptures and we look at this this portion of the word. Amen. You see right from the beginning, Amen. or before even time began. Amen. I believe that God had a great symphony in his mind. Amen. I believe that we are a part of a very great symphony. Amen. A symphony that began in the mind of God. Amen. Of course, God being the composer, amen, of this great symphony. Amen. Are you with me? He is the composer of this great symphony. But we know that a symphony cannot be a symphony without subjects that are playing in the symphony. Amen. For a symphony to be a symphony, there has to be people, amen, that that are playing in the symphony. And so as God, amen, this great composer, amen, begin to pan in his mind, amen, what he wanted the symphony to be, he needed subjects, amen, that that will play in this great symphony. Amen. A and the subjects that Amen. he was going to use in the symphony. Amen. We're going to be different type of people. Amen. A in the symphony we're going to find angels in there. Amen. In the symphony we're going to find men in there. Amen. And and you know when we talk about angels, Amen. Angels of God, different ranks of angels. Amen. You know how the prophet tell there was an angel called warmwood and there's Gabriel and and there were angels that come to minister strength to people. So there are different ranks and each one was playing their role. Amen. And and among the men, Amen. God will have different men. Amen. You'll have prophets. Amen. And and you have kings and you have judges and and you have preachers. You have moms. You'll have dads and and you have young people and and you have children. You'll have all these people. And they're all a part of this great symphony. Amen. That is about to unfold in the mind of God. And so and so God begins, Amen. to to unfold the symphony. But I want you to notice that the symphony that man there was going to be times where a man the symphony was going to be a little more quiet. Amen. And it almost feels like nothing has happened. But there was going to be times where the symphony would just build up and and it just rise and and come to a momentum. Amen. And this was all going to be what God was going to play out. Amen. And all together, amen, with the hoys and the lows. Amen. and the quiet moments all together was to build and bring forth a beautiful music. Amen. It was to bring forth a a beautiful symphony, a beautiful masterpiece. Amen. That has a great harmony. Amen. A a masterpiece. Amen. That that had a perfect rhythm, that had a perfect melody. Amen. And so God begin to materialize, amen, the symphony that he had in his mind. Amen. Are you with me this morning? He begin to materialize the symphony that he had in his morning. And the prophet will tell us, amen, that the first thing that he must have created, amen, were angels. Amen. Because he was God. And and for him to be God, he needed to be an object of worship. That's the meaning of God. He's an object of worship. So the first thing he created were angels. Amen. And these angels begin to play their part and and begin to worship him and and to give him praise and and that made him God. Amen. And among these angels that he created. Amen. There was there was one of the angels that he made his right hand man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And his name was Lucifer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lucifer was over the in charge of the music &gt;&gt; in the heavenly realms. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was his right hand man. And and nowadays, you know, and I I'm just dramatizing here and you just bear with me. Amen. But but no days, Amen. Lucifer was very close to God and and Lucifer days he begin to catch the inspiration of where the symphony was going. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? I just wanted to stay with me. He begin to cast the inspiration of of where the symphony was going and and as Lucifer begin to look at this what God had in his mind and begin to cast the inspiration Isaiah chapter 14 will begin to tell us amen of of how Lucifer's heart something begin to rise what Lucifer begin to say well this is a beautiful music and almost Lucifer begin to have a little bit of pride and Lucifer begin to to have a little bit of envy and Lucifer begin to feel like, oh, I wish I was the composer. We feel like, I wish I I was the one that was doing this. Amen. Let me say this, church. Pride is an evil tin. Are you with me this morning? Pride is a very evil. Brother Brandon will speak a message just entitled pride. Amen. Pride will will invoid Jesus and let him sit with no defeat. Pride will invoid Jesus. Amen. And and give him no attention. Amen. Pride will get Jesus to a place where he's just an object that is looked upon, that is mocked. Amen. That is what pride will do. Pride will get us to a place, amen, that that we have a hard time saying sorry to one another. Are you with me this evening? This this morning, amen. Pride will get us to a place where where we can't even be grateful, amen, for what someone does for us. We can't be thankful. Pride is an evil thing. Pride will keep you away, amen, from walking with God. Pride, amen, will break relationships. Pride will get into your marriage and destroy it because you just can't humble yourself. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Because you just can't humble yourself to say I was wrong. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? You just can't say I am wrong. Pride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon Mo say give me a church that is humble. &gt;&gt; That is sweet, that is not arrogant. And he said, "I'll show you a church that has favor and power with God." &gt;&gt; God is looking for humility. He's not looking for pride. &gt;&gt; Pride will tear down a church. &gt;&gt; Pride will devoid a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we can't humble ourselves. Amen. To submit ourselves to the womb that God has placed and to be the head of the church, to lead the church as a pastor. Are you with me this morning? Pride. &gt;&gt; Be careful of pride. Be careful of whatever you do when you not been driven by pride. &gt;&gt; That you've not been driven by envy. Because that was what was happening in heaven with Lucifer. And I want you to realize that this is happening in the presence of God. This is happening in the most holy place that has ever been on the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? In the most holy place with the most holy person, with the most holy angels, a place where sin has never been before. Right there, pride is rising up in the heart of someone. Right there, envy is rising up in the heart of someone. For what purpose? To try to disrupt the plan and the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Pride and envy. get to the place where you begin to compare yourself with one another. &gt;&gt; I wish I was like this. &gt;&gt; I wish I could do this. I wish I was in that position. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what Lucifer was was was craving for. &gt;&gt; I wish I was in that position. &gt;&gt; I was that I wish that was me. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; I wish that was me. I I wish that I was the one that was in charge of it all. And but I'm going say this this morning. You are exactly where God wants you to be &gt;&gt; in a symphony. &gt;&gt; Don't chase after Renitan. &gt;&gt; He is the composer &gt;&gt; and you are exactly where he wants you to be. &gt;&gt; Remember that the music can be low sometimes. That's right. &gt;&gt; The music can be hoy sometimes, &gt;&gt; but it's also part of the symphony. &gt;&gt; You are exactly where God wants you to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the composer and he's not making any mistake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, let's go back and let's go back to the story. So, Lucifer, Amen. and he he he's looking and and all these things are rising up in his heart and he's desiring to to to to to to take this role of a composer. But you see, Lucifer is not even looking to be equal with God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Lucifer was looking to be greater than God. &gt;&gt; That's what praying will do. &gt;&gt; Will try to get you to be greater or bigger than someone else. Lucif Lucifer was looking to be greater to get more glory to be more worshiped and and all these sort of things. That's what was Lucifer was was looking at and was desiring. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know sometimes these things happen that you know when we find ourselves you know as humans when we find ourselves we come to a place amen where we begin to realize that maybe God has blessed someone a little more than maybe he's blessed us. Listen we all not going to be rich people. Okay? &gt;&gt; You know there's going to be some riches all part of the symphony. &gt;&gt; Okay. But you see sometimes it feels that God has blessed someone a little more or given them a little more and and you know all these tents and and you know sometimes it comes to place where if we not we find that if if we compare ourselves to it but then we come to a place where we try to stop that person or or we try to get in the way of that person &gt;&gt; or try to do something to belittle that person &gt;&gt; because God has given them a little more. &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, it's all back to pride and envy. We try to do these tents, but you see that's exactly what Lucifer was doing. &gt;&gt; You see, because when he realized because Lucifer came to bless, he realized I can't compose. &gt;&gt; He I don't have the power to create. &gt;&gt; After all his envy, he realized I am limited because I was created. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now Lucifer because of the pride in his heart he decides that okay if I can't compose if I can't create then I'm going to get in the way of what God is doing. &gt;&gt; Then I'm going to try to tear down what God is doing. &gt;&gt; And you know what happens? Lucifer goes out and he begin to witness to some angels. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. He begin to witness to some angels and begin to tell these angels, "Hey, listen. I've got a great plan, guys. &gt;&gt; I'm going to make you guys big." &gt;&gt; You see, all you guys have been doing is worshiping this God. And but I'm telling you something. I'm going to make you big. &gt;&gt; That this God is going to worship you guys. You know, sometimes, you know, sad to say, but these angels were a little maybe a little dumb, &gt;&gt; cuz I don't know, but you are in heaven. &gt;&gt; You are in the best position you could ever be in. &gt;&gt; And the very &gt;&gt; angel that was created just like you were created &gt;&gt; comes to tell you that I'm going to make you greater than the one that created you. And you believe in him. And that's what sometimes the enemy do does among us. &gt;&gt; And so these angels, they cried around Lucifer and and they decide that they're going to war against Michael and his angels. And Revelation 12 will tell us about this war in heaven. As Lucifer was seeking to gain authority and position in heaven, Revelation 12:78 will tell us that and there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels. &gt;&gt; The first war that ever began was in heaven. &gt;&gt; The first argument there ever began was in heaven. &gt;&gt; The first sin that ever began was in heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; The blessed pride ever began was in heaven. &gt;&gt; The blessed envy began was in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you think that Satan is not going to try to do the same thing in the midst of you right in this church? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He'll try to do the same thing. But the scripture says, "And prevailed not &gt;&gt; and prevailed not." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Neither was the place found anymore in heaven. &gt;&gt; Now, you might be sitting here this morning and and you feel like, "Oh, that was a great battle that happened. It happened in heaven." But I just want to remind you, amen, that when that battle was taking place, you were there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you were a part of the symphony. Amen. When when Lucifer was going around and he was convincing the angels and try to turn him aside, you were hidden in the might of God. Lucifer could not get to you because you were hidden in the mind of God. You fought him and you defeated him over in heaven. And let me say this, if Lucifer had no place in heaven, then Lucifer has no place in you here on earth. Amen. Listen, church. Satan is not a composer of your life. Satan is not a composer of this church. Satan is not a composer of your family. Satan cannot stop what God has written concerning you. He's been trying to rob your name of that lamb's book of life. He's tried everything he can to rub that name off, but that name is still there because God rubbed that name with his own blood. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you defeated him then you can defeat him now. &gt;&gt; If you had the victory then you can have the victory now. He can't stop your music because it is not your music. It is a music that God started before the foundation of the world. And what God started, he will finish it &gt;&gt; because he's the author and finisher of our fed. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, Lucifer loses his water in heaven &gt;&gt; and he's cast out of heaven and he's cast down onto earth. But you see, spirits don't die. &gt;&gt; Natures don't change. &gt;&gt; But Brown will tell us, "Whatever you are here, whatever you are name here, you're going to be the same thing over there." &gt;&gt; Going over there is not going to change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; What you taking out of here is your character. &gt;&gt; And whatever your character is, name is what is going to be over there. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's cast out of heaven onto earth and and he's on earth and and he's he's looking and watching as the symphony continues to unfold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this perfect garden where there's two people, Adam and Eve, and this music, God's symphony is continuing to unfold them. But his purpose has not changed. He still wants to get in the mess of the symphony and destroy it. &gt;&gt; And so Satan began to to go to Eve, &gt;&gt; not one time, but maybe two times and three times and begins to talk to Eve. What was Satan doing? Satan was begin to play an uncertain sound. &gt;&gt; A sound that was uncertain. &gt;&gt; A sound that wasn't matching with the word. They begin to just speak to to Eve and begin to ento Eve and and Eve is just listening and listening and eventually Eve gives in and and gives herself up to it. Then once Eve gives himself up to it, Satan feels like, "Yes, I couldn't make it in heaven, but I'm making it right now. I am getting them right now. I'm stopping the symphony." And we know that, you know, Eve goes back to Adam and tells him about this fruit. And we know what the fruit is. There's no need to go in into West as believers. We understand that. Amen. And and he and he goes to Adam and and tells Adam. Now, Adam has a choice to make. Adam can choose to stay with the symphony or go with the uncertain sound. &gt;&gt; But we know that Adam is a type of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. that because of love &gt;&gt; for his bride, &gt;&gt; he chose to go down the path &gt;&gt; that looked like it was &gt;&gt; the wrong path, but he was doing it because of love. &gt;&gt; And so Satan, amen, feels like I have almost he felt like I've got this. &gt;&gt; The symphony is over. Because he knew that the wedges of sin is dead. &gt;&gt; And I knew that if I get them to die that is, &gt;&gt; it's over. What is he going to do? But little did Satan know &gt;&gt; that that was &gt;&gt; just a junction &gt;&gt; in the music. &gt;&gt; You know, every symphony has got junctions in them. &gt;&gt; That was just a junction in the sheet music of the composer. It was a junction that the that the composer was going to change the beat of the music &gt;&gt; because now the composer was just not going to be a god that was above us but the composer was going to move into another role where he's going to begin to show his attribute as a savior as a healer as a deliverer. You see Satan thought he had him but all he he didn't know that he was actually playing a part in the symphony. Oh well glory. He actually didn't know that he was just making a way for the beat to change. He was just making a way for God to step on the scene and begin to move in a way. Amen. That that that Satan did not could not even imagine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; And we know as God will will step down in flesh and begin to to to manifest these tents and show his attribute as a healer, as a deliverer. Amen. And we know at Calvary he begins to correct the errors that has been on the music scene and and he begins to do all these tents. Amen. And as he's doing these tents, Amen. Satan is watching &gt;&gt; and he's amazed. &gt;&gt; But at the same time, he's not planning on giving up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Okay, if this is what it is, then I'm going to keep fighting. And I'm going to keep fighting with every subject that will give their heart to the Lord. Let me say this. When you surrender your heart to the Lord, you become a target to the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. You become a person that Satan is targeting to try to disrupt the symphony that God is playing in your life. Well, I'm going say this. Don't be discouraged. Amen. Don't be discouraged because he cannot stop the music. He cannot stop the symphony that God is playing and unfolding in your life. Many things may come your way but remember they are just junctions that are coming to change the pattern of the music of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. The trials that you face. Amen. That the moments that you feel like you're losing it. Amen. It is just a junction in your life where God is changing the beat of your music. Where God is bringing to you a place of a greater reality. is bringing you to a place where your character is going to be molded, where it's going to be more real to you. It is just a junction in the seat music. So don't be discouraged. Amen. Paul would tell us, amen, that we are troubled on every side, but we are not distressed. Amen. That we are perplexed, but we are not in despair. That we are persecuted, but we are not forsaken. Amen. That we are cast down, but we are not destroyed. Hallelujah. No matter what comes our way. Amen. The sheet music has to go on. No matter what comes our way, we know it is just a junction where God is going to show his glory. It might be a junction of sickness. It's because he wants to show his glory as a healer. &gt;&gt; It might be a bondage of affliction because he wants to show his glory as a deliverer. &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged. David will tell us that, you know, weeping may last for anointing, but joy comes in the morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Joy comes in the morning. &gt;&gt; And it's just a junction in your life. &gt;&gt; There was a man one time in the Bible who laid at the pole &gt;&gt; of Bethesda. &gt;&gt; Listen, he was at a junction in his life for 28 years. He was low, you know, his pull. &gt;&gt; No day he thought, Amen, that that his music, his symphony was over. &gt;&gt; He could sit there and he could see the angel of the Lord move and deliver and set free. And he was just sitting there and he's watching this and he wants to be delivered. He wants to be set free. &gt;&gt; But it feels like his music just can't move on. It feels like it's a moment where the symphony has jump just gone quiet and nothing is happening. Amen. And he's just sitting there and and he's just wondering what am I going to do? But you see, it was a moment. It was a junction in his life where God was going to reveal himself to him in a way like he never thought before. Listen, God was not just going to send an angel his way, but he himself was stepping down in flesh to come to his address. Are you with my amen? You may be in a junction, amen, that you've been there sitting there for years, more than 28 years or 20 years. I don't know how many years. But let me say this, God is not fixing just to send you an angel. &gt;&gt; But he's coming down himself. The almighty God, listen, one time there were Hebrew boys that was sitting in the fiery furnace. Amen. And listen, there were angels that offered to come down. Warmwood said, "Let me go." Gabriel said, "Let me go." But God said, "I won't let you go because this is my business. This is my child. This is my daughter. I am going myself." &gt;&gt; It was just a junction. Amen. That God was going to reveal himself to you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just a junction. And the angel came and touched them. And the angel asked him, "What?" Not the angel, sorry. Jesus came and and asked him, "What? Will thou be made whole? &gt;&gt; Will they be made whole?" But you see, this man had been in this junction for so long. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He's been in this junction for so long that he begin to find excuses. &gt;&gt; Jesus was there asking him, &gt;&gt; "Will you be made whole? this very moment you want to be made whole but you begin to make excuses but you see I've been here for many years and and I've seen the angel come and I've seen him heal that person deliver that person and I want to be delivered but I've been sitting here nobody's helping me and Jesus is saying but will you be made whole &gt;&gt; listen we can be sitting in our condition complaining and complaining listen I've been here for years and I've been going through this for years and you don't know how painful it is and you don't know how hurtful it And you don't know how I've been discouraged. And Jesus is right in the service saying, "Will you be made whole? I'm coming to your junction. I am here right now. Will you be made whole?" Well, you can sit down and complain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, will you be made whole? &gt;&gt; You can just arise and let your light shine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Though it's like a gross darkness upon you, &gt;&gt; but you can arise and let your light shine. &gt;&gt; You know in the symphony, amen, everybody playing their part and and sometime they're all playing together, but there is a moment, amen, sometime that there's one person that just stands out. Are you with me? And they begin to play a solo or begin to play a certain part where the other people are just quiet. You know, sometimes God is just wanting to call you to a place where he just want to invite you to play a solo. Amen. I just want to invite you to play a solo. He's moving. Amen. Among the congregation, but maybe he's just coming to your address just like he came to that woman who was sitting in the pool and sir, I just want you to play a solo. This is your moment. Amen. This is your moment. Pick up your instrument and begin to play your part. Arise and begin to shine. Amen. You've been in the darkness for so long, but this is your moment. Amen. Don't let it pass you, boy. It is part of the symphony. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is part of the symphony. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you might get low and &gt;&gt; might get slow but he's still there. &gt;&gt; He is the light. &gt;&gt; What is that light? It is the vindicated word for our day. &gt;&gt; That is what that light is. &gt;&gt; That is the light that has risen in this day. Amen. Brother Brham said he said, "I am the light of the world." Amen. That's right. The same yesterday, today, and forever. And he's still the light of the world. He said, "And what is he?" In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God. Why was he the light of the world? Is that if he had come and said, "I am the Messiah." And he didn't did and he didn't do like the Bible said the Messiah will do, then he wasn't the light of the world. See, it's a vindicated word that makes it the Lloyd of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "And in this hour that we are living in name, it's a vindicated word of this hour." He said, "Pentecostals, you say speaking in tongues and so forth." He said, "That was the day of Pentecost." He said, "That was the delight of the hour." Then see this is another day. Here is the light of the hour today. Here is the light of the hour today. What is it? Is the vindicated word of God for us in this day. That is the Lloyd for today for our day. This is the Lloyd that he's calling you to stand up and shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is your moment. Amen. In the symphony that he's saying it is your time for you to arise and begin to shine the light of your day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He continues to say the seven church age all smith with Christ on the outside is said the moon and identify in it all the darkness coming upon the earth. It said the light is present in now begin to show what is going to take place. He said the tin will be destroyed. Talking about the darkness. The 10 will be destroyed and the loit will come in and destroy it. And it said and the saint shall inherit the earth. The meek shall inherit the earth. Amen. He said the earth the moon the moon darkness will be took away. He said the darkness of the night will pass away. He said the darkness with your dead creeds. Amen. And away with the world of God perverted things that they that they are saying. It said and the light will break forth upon the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is that day &gt;&gt; for the Lord to break forth. This is that day in the symphony for this boy to rise up to what she's called to be. What is she called to be? The Lord of the hour. Amen. She's called to be the continuation of the symphony that began in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. She's called to finish the part of the symphony that that has been given to her. Amen. Let me say this, church. As we as we were speaking about, Amen. Lucifer trying to stop this stop the symphony from going forward. Let me say this. There's been different exoduses. Amen. That Satan has been trying to stop God's people from moving forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's been trying to stop the Lloyd of that day. Amen. You remember one time was Pharaoh that rose up against the forest exodus. &gt;&gt; He was trying, Amen. to get get in the midst of that symphony to stop the children of Israel from getting to the promised land. But let me say this, Pharaoh was not successful because there was a light that went before them. Amen. There was a pillar of fire that went before them. Amen. Listen, when they came to the crossroad of the Red Sea and they didn't know where to go, it was a junction in the walk. Amen. At that junction, they wondered where are we going? Here is the Red Sea before us. Here is Pharaoh and his army behind us. Where are we going to do? But you know what happened? The light of that day, that pillar of fire that followed them, made a way in the midst of the Red Sea. Are you with me this evening? What was happening? The light of their day was shining in their dare, making a way for them to move forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was their season. It was their time to play their part in the symphony that God had called them to play in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Red Sea open and they were led by a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were led by a prophet in the first Exodus with a vindicated word with a pillar of fire. Amen. And they succeeded in their portion of playing their part of the symphony. &gt;&gt; Years go by, thousands of years go by or hundreds of years go by and here comes another Exodus, the second exodus. Amen. And here they are in the upper room, a fearful people. They're at a great junction. Amen. Christ has come. The Holy Ghost has been promised to them. And here they are in this upper room, a fearful people. It's a moment where God is bringing a church out of a people. Bringing a church out of a nation. Amen. And what happens again? The same pillar of fire appears in that operon. Amen. In a form of a tongue of fire. What was it? It was the Lloyd for their death that it was the moment for them to shine their light in their moment to play their part in their symphony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the scribes and the Pharisees and all the people there could not stop them &gt;&gt; because it was their moment. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Pharaoh couldn't stop the first Exodus. The Pharisees couldn't Pharaoh couldn't stop the first Exodus. The Pharisees couldn't stop the second exodus. We are in the third exodus. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the third exodus, we have also received the prophet for is there. We have received the pillar of fire for is there. There is a light that is shining in this day to move this bride forward to her inheritance. Are you with me this evening? Listen, brother Brandon will say that 200,000 ten demons has been released in this age, but they don't have enough power to stop this exodus. If they couldn't stop the first exodus, if they couldn't stop the second exodus, they can't stop the third exodus. You are in the third exodus. This is your season. Listen, the pillar of fire. The pillar of fire is just not in a picture. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire is not in the is not in Washington in the white house. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you think the pillar of fire is just a picture, you are missing it. Because the pillar of fire is more than a picture, I'm telling you that fire has moved from the picture into a people to be the light of day. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. It's not a picture. It's a reality. It's a person. It's the same Lord Jesus. Oh hallelujah. The same one that met Paul is the same one that is here today in you and in me. The angel hasn't left. He is still here. The music did not stop when the prophet went off the scene. It was just a change. Oh, hallelujah. It was just a change. The music was just changing. Amen. The pace was just changing. &gt;&gt; Amen. G &gt;&gt; to continue on the symphony. &gt;&gt; And you and me. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To continue on the symphony. &gt;&gt; And you and me. &gt;&gt; You see John, John the Revelator, he was on his island of Patmas. Now we know that John is a type of the bride. You with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a type of the bride and and he's on this island of Patmos. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and these the these Pharisees or these Jewish people, they thought that, you know, we we will try to tried everything to to stop John. You remember they they boiled John in in a in a boiling oil to to try to stop him. &gt;&gt; And they said that he got a he got witchcraft or he got a devil because even that couldn't stop him. And so they just threw him on this island of Patmos to to just put him away and just let him die on this island of Patmos. You know, sometimes you might feel like you in a position or in a place where it just feels like it's just dry and just nothing is happening. Amen. And it feels like a man nothing is happening and things didn't seem not to be moving forward. But but you see while John is on this island on the Patmos, remember he's a type of the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. He he he breaks into a vision. Are you with me? He breaks into a vision. And as he breaks into a vision, amen, he he begin to see, amen, all these characteristics of God. And God begins to speak to him. Amen. Listen, it was a junction in John's life, amen, where it felt like everything was over, but it was just a change of the beat. It was just a change of the beat. Are you with me this morning? The the beat was just changed. And I want you to notice that John is standing on this island. And in Revelation chapter 4, you know, he hears a voice that tells him, "Come on." &gt;&gt; Come up higher, John. &gt;&gt; There are things I want to show you. And and you could imagine John rises up in this vision and and John here he is and he's looking and and it says that there's a throne and there's one person sitting on it and and begin to describe the the scenery of of Jasper and and the continents of the one sitting on it, the rainbow around him and all these things. But then but then there's another part that John begin to see. He begin to see 24 thrones. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now remember John is in a vision. Amen. And John is in theory on earth. Amen. And he's at a junction in his life, but he sees a vision of 24 thrones. And another day John maybe looks and say, "Yes, I can remember. It does look like maybe probably the the patriarchs, you know, that the the children of Israel and each one of them Reuben, I can see them all sitting over there." And and maybe he looks on the other side and but that is Peter sitting there. &gt;&gt; Looks but that is Bert Leo sitting there. and looks but that is Andrew sitting there and looks and said but that is jam sitting there and and that is small jams and that is big jams and and then he looks but he said but wait a minute but that is me sitting there &gt;&gt; that is me sitting there &gt;&gt; at the junction where it felt like everything was over he breaks into a vision and he begin to look and though he's on earth oh hallelujah Though John is on earth, though his bride is on earth, but he begin to look in a vision and begin to see himself sitting on a throne with a crown upon his head. Oh, let me say this church. We may be on here on earth and we going through junctions in our life, but there is a vision that we can begin to look into. Brother Brennham said, if you want to see a vision, just open your Bible. There is a vision that you can begin to look into. And when you see this vision, all that you're going to see is yourself in the vision. Let me say this, church. It is not that you are going to make it. You've already made it. You've already made it. Your name is already there. Brother Brandon will say that the table is already set. The church are already there. Your name is already there. It's the angels already. They've shined their trumpets. They've got everything ready. Amen. Why? Because the symphony is about to change beat. The symphony is about to move into another realm, into another dimension. Amen. And you can look in the vision and you can see yourself in the vision, &gt;&gt; being seated already in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. The scripture tells us, "Ye are the light of the world, a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it need a man light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, &gt;&gt; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house? Is that let your light so shine before men that ye may see that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven. We are not here to show to to hide away our light. We are here to shine our light. This is our season. He's saying this is your part of the symphony. This is your time to play your part of the symphony. What are you called to play? Play the word. What are you called to play? Believe what the word says. Obey you and manifest it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the word, Amen, have the preeminence in you. That's what brother Brandham said. The season we are in is the season where the word is to have preeminence in the bride to shine your light. Listen, we are not Saul that is hiding away. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; We're not Saul that is hiding away when Goliath showed up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; When when the music got a little a little shaky &gt;&gt; and Paul run away, it's all run away. He went to Hoy. He was the one that was fit to do the work. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen, there are many great men in this world, but God has chosen you, this little bride, just little David. Listen, you have been anointed to face the Goliath that you will face. It is your season. It is your hour. The anointing is already upon you. You can't do anything about it. Listen, David did not choose to be a king. Oh, come on, church. You did not choose to be called bride. You did not choose to be called a message believer. But someone chose you. Oh wow. Glory. I said someone chose you. Amen. And when he chose you, he sent you a prophet. Glory. He sent a prophet to your address to bring a word that will anoint you to defeat any Goliath that will come your way. &gt;&gt; Listen church. Satan is not fighting you. He is fighting against prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is pointing against prophecy. You were prophesied to be here. &gt;&gt; You were prophesied to defeat the enemy. &gt;&gt; And Satan is not fighting you, but he's fighting prophecy. He's fighting the anointing that is upon you. &gt;&gt; It is your season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To arise and shine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, &gt;&gt; Goliath, let him make his post, but don't be afraid. &gt;&gt; Choose calmly with sincerity, with humility. Begin to pick up your stones. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You don't have to show off. You don't have to do any big things. Just begin to pick up your stone. Let him go ahead and do his post. Whether he be sickness, whether he be depression, whether he be anxiety, let him go ahead and do his pose. You just pick up your stones because the anointing is upon you. &gt;&gt; It is time for you to rise and shine. &gt;&gt; That is your moment in the symphony. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember that the scripture said that there is no weapon &gt;&gt; that is formed against you &gt;&gt; that shall prosper. Now when it says no weapon, it means no weapon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, even if it is an atomic bomb, brother Brandham said before one bomb drop, we are going to be head off. &gt;&gt; No weapon formed against you shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Because prophecy said you are fixing for a rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are in a moment where the symphony is changing again. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; We are in the cycle of the rapture. The symphony is changing again. The beat is changing again. What is happening? Christ, the bridegroom is coming to take away his bride. As a matter of fact, the bridegroom is already here. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. He's already anointed. Amen. The marriage take place here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said the marriage of the lamb has come &gt;&gt; and his wife has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; The message has come to bring us into a relationship into a union into a marriage with Christ. We are just heading a to the wedding and supper &gt;&gt; but the anointing time is here. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it's already slipped on your finger. your merited wedding and band of grace. It's already on your finger. You are already married. You can't get married to anyone else on the face of the earth. There's no demon that can get married to you. You are already married. Not just married or pregnant and not just pregnantated. You are bearing for the fruit of the one that pregnant you. What is it? It is the word being made manifest in your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No weapon &gt;&gt; formed against you &gt;&gt; shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; And any tongue that will rise up against you in judgment you will condemn it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you know why? Because you'll be sitting on the throne judging the people with the can. You are not going to be judged. You will be judging. There will be no tongue that will be able to rise up against you. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The beat is changing. &gt;&gt; The beat is changing. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Rise and join for your light has come. This is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; This is your promise. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "God has moved down through the time of history with his promised word in each age &gt;&gt; and has never failed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To break the rhythm &gt;&gt; by the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When it come to the elected and vindicated people, is that the rhythm of his word and the death of nowhere. The rhythm of his word and the deaths of nowhere and the deaths of Moses and the days of Elijah and the death of John and the death of David and the death of Jesus on down. He keeps the rhythm of the word &gt;&gt; right on down. Never has broke it. He said he has come right down through history and the elected seed that seen it and believe it fall right into that rhythm with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said the other said, well, but the church says that has got nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; You are not born to do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not born to be questioning what the that and no, you are not born to do that. You just fall in line with the rhythm of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; You punctuate every word with an amen. &gt;&gt; That is what the bride is called to do. Punctuate every word with an amen. &gt;&gt; He said you are born into the word. &gt;&gt; For you are born into Christ. &gt;&gt; Christ is the word. Yes, sir. Each one in its age. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I I'll just tell you, brother Brennan, I can't look ahead." He said, "Then look up." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell look up. God promised. &gt;&gt; If you look up, see him, shalom, peace, God peace rest upon you. &gt;&gt; You can't look ahead, look up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can't look ahead, look up. You know, one time there was a prophet. Amen. The prophet Elijah. Amen. And and you know, he's gone ahead and he's been on Mount Carmel and he's he's had a showdown. He's destroyed all these these gods of Baal and and done all these things and we know there's been a drought in the land and you know there come a time where he tells Ahab listen there's going to rain is going to come. Amen. He tells him rain is coming and and he goes and and he says that he he put his face in between his legs and he begins to pray because rain is is to come. Amen. And as he's beginning to pray and he's praying there is a servant that he sends out. Oh hallelujah. Oh glory. There's a servant that he sends out. Amen. To look not look ahead but look up. &gt;&gt; Amen. He sends him to look up. Because if he looks ahead all that he's going to see is a dry land. If he looks ahead all he's going to see is a barren land. But he said look up from where the promise is coming to make that dry land and a fruitful land again. Are you with me? And so the servant goes out the first time. And if you allow me to maybe just just type this just a little bit. Amen. I hope you're okay with me dramatizing a little bit. But you see, the servant goes out the first time. And you know, if we can bring it into a type, it's like when Paul went out the first time. &gt;&gt; Just stay with me. Listen. He went out the first time and he looked up and he saw nothing. &gt;&gt; But listen, the promise was sure. That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; The promise was sure. It was going to come. Something was moving. The rhythm, the symphony was still moving on. Paul didn't do anything wrong. He just went to look and it looked like there was nothing yet. And then Ianous came around and he went to look and it felt like there was nothing still. And then Martin came around and he also went to look and it looks like the skies were still the same persecution of the church and and all these things happening. Are you with me? And then Columbus went to look &gt;&gt; and he went to look and also still persecution and and different things happening and the luther also went out and he also begin to look. They begin to look and it was good but still it felt like nothing was happening. &gt;&gt; And then Wesley also came and he also went to look and Wesley looked and now is the sixth time. Now you know the story I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Now is the sixth time that the servant has gone out and he has looked &gt;&gt; and there's no cloud. But the promise is there is coming a rain. &gt;&gt; The symphony is there is coming a build up. &gt;&gt; According to the music she seat &gt;&gt; there is coming a build up in the symphony. But you're all looking for this build up. Now now remember Paul if you read his letters Paul will say that the coming of the Lord is at hand. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? What was it? He was looking. &gt;&gt; He was looking. He knew that the promise was near. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But but in a season the coming of the Lord didn't fully happen then. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No doubt Iranius did the same. No doubt Martin did the same. No doubt Columbus did the same. Now I'm talking about the messengers of the church ages. &gt;&gt; No doubt Lut did the same. And Wesler did the same. But oh church, &gt;&gt; at the seventh time, &gt;&gt; when the servant went out at the seventh time, &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everybody had that went out looking for the promise of his coming. But when the servant went out at the seventh time, he saw a cloud. &gt;&gt; Oh well, glory. He saw a cloud that was 20 miles high and 27 miles across. Oh, hallelujah. And when he saw that cloud, a voice spoke to him and said, "Go back east. Go back east because there is coming an abundance of rain." The promise that you've been looking at is here. And he said, "Go back east because the rain is coming." And when he went back east, what did he do? He begin to break the seals upon your life and begin to show you that you were always there. That you were always in his mind. That you came from God and you are going back to God. That you cannot fail. Oh, hallelujah. That you are justified like you never did it in the first place. What was he doing? He was telling you that he is here. &gt;&gt; It is the season of the abundance of rain. The music is changing. The symphony is changing. The beat is changing. And he's calling you to say, "Arise and shine for your light has come." Your light has come. &gt;&gt; It is your season, church. It is your hour, church. It is time to arise. No matter what your symphony has been, it is your hour name. It is your season now. There is gross darkness. But in the middle of the darkness, there is a light that is showing them because Satan cannot stop the music. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He can't stop your symphony. &gt;&gt; God started it and God will finish it. &gt;&gt; There are not enough demons in hell that can stop you this morning. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Mal about a cousin girl that was working on a ranch and she was playing her music. He was playing a part of a symphony and I am closing. She was playing a part of the symphony and and you know she's been there and you know they not been treating her very well. How many in the room knows that story? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They have not been treating her very well and &gt;&gt; you know they they get her to just wash the dishes and and do the dirty work. You see, she was their cousin because her dad has passed away and so her parents were gone and so she's gone to live with with her uncle and her uncle had children. Amen. And now these children of her uncle were not treating her good. &gt;&gt; They were giving her all the hard work and and doing all these things and well you see no matter what was happening she kept on doing her part. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; She kept on doing her part. Though it was hard, but she kept on doing her part. Are you with me? Listen. Though it might be hard, but you just keep on doing your part. Brother Brandham said, "If you want to draw closer to God, do what? Pray and read your Bible every day. Just keep doing your part. Do it as hard trials. Just keep doing your part." She just kept doing her part and just walking away. But in the meantime, the owner of this ranch in Chicago, his son was looking for a wife. Amen. And he had a baby. these girls are leaving on that taking care of the ranch over there. And so and so he flies down over there and go there to to to kind of see if there's anyone there that that will kind of fit for him. Amen. And and and he and and he goes there and and all these cousin girls hear that he's coming and oh, they begin to dress up. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They begin to dress up. &gt;&gt; Oh, they got the high heels going and boy, they got the makeup going. Oh, come on, church. You know, in name of days, we don't preach obey those terms anymore. Well, let me say this. You be careful of that spirit. Listen, I'm trying to close. Don't blame me. These are all extras that are coming. Okay? So, so, so don't blame me anymore because I'm done. But listen, we don't preach obey those things anymore. Be careful of that spirit. Be careful of that makeup spirit. Amen. Because when when he came, he wasn't interested in the makeup people. He wasn't interested in the high heels people. You know, nowadays, it's going to rain on a message. And I'm just going to say it. You know, they've got this new polish thing going on on your nails. Oh, come on now. &gt;&gt; They've got this new polish thing going on on your nails. You know, Satan, he's very he's very smart. Oh, come on now. He knows that you're not going to put on the red one or you're not going to put on the black one or you're not going to put on the pink one. So, you know what he did? He gave you a colorless one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; The colorless one is made by the same chemicals but just without the color. &gt;&gt; It is the same spirit behind it. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. And he tells you, go ahead and, you know, just pretty away your nails. Oh, glory be to God. Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and pretty on your nails and and pretty on your face. Put on some mascara on. Oh, come on now. Go ahead and put on them skirt that has got a split and thin over there. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and dress on that way. It is a spirit. &gt;&gt; It is an evil spirit &gt;&gt; that will try to come upon you to get you to a place where people begin to lust after you. &gt;&gt; You know nowadays these preaching are not famous in the pulpits anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know the prophet preached against these things. &gt;&gt; And we don't have to lie those things in our midst. &gt;&gt; We don't have to lay those things as young people. &gt;&gt; We don't have to lay those things in our homes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it is a spirit. That's right. &gt;&gt; It gets you to put on all these things on and and put on all these lip gloss and oh boy, know some people you see and message believing people, you know, the lips are shining more than the sun is shining. &gt;&gt; Come on. E. &gt;&gt; Amen. church. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying don't put on those tins because it's dry over here and you need them and fine we get but don't make it a a big 10. &gt;&gt; Don't make a name the t that stands out the first one that everybody sees when they see you. &gt;&gt; What is your motive behind it? &gt;&gt; What is your motive behind it? Listen, I use this one here. You can buy them from the dollar store. &gt;&gt; It's okay to use them, but don't make it a big 10. &gt;&gt; But you see these girls, they just got into dressing up and getting ready to meet him. And he comes and they throw up this party and they dancing away and doing whatever they're doing. But he just gets sick of it &gt;&gt; and he walks away as you begin to walk away. Begin to hear someone just humming. &gt;&gt; Someone just huming away. &gt;&gt; The great physician &gt;&gt; now is near &gt;&gt; the sympathizing Jesus. &gt;&gt; He begin to wonder who is this? Where is this song coming from? And he begin to walk and &gt;&gt; find this girl. &gt;&gt; She's just washing away at this. And it's a hard job. &gt;&gt; She hasn't got any shoes on her feet. She looks poor. She looks wretched. But there's a joy in the heart. &gt;&gt; There's a joy in the heart. &gt;&gt; Oh, listen church. We may be going through trials. We may be going through hard times. But listen to let there be a joy in your heart that you keep on singing that you keep on praising him that you keep on worshiping him in the midst of your trial and you see that he begin to draw near to you and he begin to bring you peace and begin to bring you comfort to guide you through your trials and she kept on singing and he came and begin to ask her who are you and what's your name and she begin to tell her and he said listen will you marry me? &gt;&gt; Will you marry me? And the girl is who me? &gt;&gt; I have nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I am not. &gt;&gt; I am a dishwasher over here. But you see, he was looking for character. &gt;&gt; He was looking for character. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was looking for someone that was not going to be complaining, &gt;&gt; but someone that in the midst of the trial &gt;&gt; was still amen going to be praising him. &gt;&gt; And he found that character &gt;&gt; and he said, "Well, &gt;&gt; if you want to marry me, &gt;&gt; sure. When he came your way and invited you, &gt;&gt; you didn't feel worthy." &gt;&gt; Up until today, sometimes, Lord, I'm so unworthy. &gt;&gt; I'm so unworthy. Why did you even choose me? &gt;&gt; Why did you even choose me? &gt;&gt; But because he loved you. &gt;&gt; Because you've always been a part of them. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Sure." And he gave her a promise. I'm going to go, but I'm going to come back for you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I'm going to go, but I'm going to come back for you. &gt;&gt; And he has given you a promise. I am going, but I'm coming back for you. &gt;&gt; I am coming back for you. &gt;&gt; But in the meantime, you are still going to be a dishwasher. &gt;&gt; In the meantime, you're still going to go through struggles. In the meantime, you're still going to go through trials. &gt;&gt; In the meantime, you're going to go through hard times in your life. Why? Because the symphony has to keep going. The symphony still has to has it lows. It still has her has his voice and the symphony has still gone. Keep going. But I am coming. &gt;&gt; And she kept on doing what she was doing. &gt;&gt; Trials, temptations, but she kept on singing. She kept on singing. &gt;&gt; But oh church, one day, oh, one day she woke up out of her bed for the last time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, one day she came to church, sat behind the piano &gt;&gt; and played for the last time. &gt;&gt; One day she walked into those doors for the last time. &gt;&gt; One day she washed those dishes &gt;&gt; for the last time. The beat &gt;&gt; was about to change. &gt;&gt; One day she sat on a pew &gt;&gt; for the last time. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; One day she went through a trial for the last time. &gt;&gt; One day she weeped for the last time. &gt;&gt; One day she was discouraged for the last time. &gt;&gt; Amen. because you begin to hear the sign of the chariots &gt;&gt; coming to take it home. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One of these days, church, &gt;&gt; somewhere, brother Brandham said between 6:00 and 9. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somewhere between 6:00 and 9, &gt;&gt; it's going to be for the last time. &gt;&gt; The music is changing. &gt;&gt; The symphony is changing. &gt;&gt; You may be just washing the dishes. You may be just going through some trial. Don't stop. Just keep going. Just keep doing what you were doing. At the opening of the seven seals, brother Brennham said, "Don't get excited. Just keep doing what you're doing. Just keep walking with the Lord. Just keep serving the Lord and he will take care of the rest." Church, let me encourage you this evening. One of these days is going to be the last time when the chariot when you will hear the trumpet saying and the final the final &gt;&gt; the final day &gt;&gt; will be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And these bodies will be changed &gt;&gt; and we will be in another part of the symphony. &gt;&gt; Oh, there will be no more pain. There will be no more sorrow. Oh church, there is coming a day the musicians come. There is coming a day where there is be no more pain, no more grave siding, no more funeral. Oh God, there is there is going to be no more sorrow anymore there. &gt;&gt; But there's going to be joy forever. &gt;&gt; Arise and shine for your light has come. &gt;&gt; This is your hour. This is your season. Let's stand on our feet this evening. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Let's sing that song. There is coming a day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is coming a day. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a day that will be. Oh, help us sing. Anyone here can help us sing while you sing together with us. Oh man, I know how they shall come. Oh, clouds in the sky. for all of that golden sh. Oh, what a day. Oh, when my Jesus I shall see. The one will save me when he's going to take your boy to hand. Oh, and he lead the promised land. Glorious day will be. Oh, no more burdens today. No more sickness, no more pain, no more pattern over there. Oh, and forever we will be with him. When the one will die for me, will die for me. Oh, heat, heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Take me by the hand. I lead me to the pro. Oh, what a day. Glorious day will be. Oh, what a day that will be. Oh, what a day that will be. Oh my Jesus reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are walking in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandon one time will tell us a story about a violin. You know, it was a violin that was at an auctioneer and you know, the violin was was being auctioned and people making offers on it. $1, $2, $3 seem to have no value in us. You see, the violin was dirty and dusty and and it just just lying there. But you see one day the master walked in. &gt;&gt; You see the one that that could play it, &gt;&gt; the one that knew about music, &gt;&gt; the one that knew about symphonies, &gt;&gt; he walked in and he picked up that violin and it began to dust us, began to clean us. Then he began to play some music. &gt;&gt; As he began to play some music, the offer came back again. And from $1, it began to go to a,000, 2,000, 3,000. Encourage you to say it this morning to say the master is here. &gt;&gt; He's the composer of your life. &gt;&gt; He knows how to play it. Maybe you may feel like you've gotten dusty or may maybe feel like you've lost value of of who you really are. But let me say the master is here. &gt;&gt; He can pick up that violin. &gt;&gt; He can begin to dust it off. And &gt;&gt; play the symphony. Play the music that he wants to play through your life. &gt;&gt; You are of a great value. &gt;&gt; You are of a great value. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't let the enemy tell you anything else. &gt;&gt; You are of a great value. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Arise and shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is you season church. This gross darkness and we see it all around us. But there's still light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you are the light &gt;&gt; by the vindicated words of this day and of this hour. You may help me to believe that this morning. I'm going to say, "Lord, here I am. Take my violin. Begin to play. Begin to play the music that you won't play it out of my life and let it glorify you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want no glory in this. We don't want to be like Lucifer. We want to glorify you again. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Can we sing that song and turn her back to brother brother Barry here? It's just slipping me here. Maybe let's just sing that one. I am looking for a rapture and that blessed home on high &gt;&gt; when the redeemed &gt;&gt; shall be gathered in. &gt;&gt; How many believe that we're going to be gathered there? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Listen, church. We preach about it. We talk about it. &gt;&gt; But it's a reality. &gt;&gt; And that's where the music is going. &gt;&gt; That's where the symphony is going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where the beat is changing. That's where we head into &gt;&gt; in the blessed home and I and the redeemed will be gathered. Your loved ones are waiting for you. The angels are cheering you up. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Keep going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep pressing on. Keep pressing on. Just give me another minute. Let me share this. Oh my. You know, it's it's incredible. But you know, in a symphony, I'm I'm done. Sorry for keeping you standing. Bring it on. &gt;&gt; But you know, the Lord just just brought this to my attention. Just write your name. &gt;&gt; But you know, in a symphony, you know, do you have all these big players and you know, these guys, you know, they they they grace and they playing the violins and everything. But you know, there's this guy that sits down in a corner sometimes. You know, he's called the triangle player. You know, this triangle player is a guy that boy, he just sits there and he's just waiting and they just play and play and play. And you know, usually, you know, the the composer of the director most of the time is the guy that is now very talented and they just give him the triangle just to let him feel good, you know. But you know sometimes we may feel like the triangle player you know that we've just been sitting there and and you know tends to happen in here and tends to happen in there and tends to happen in this person's life and what about my life you know sometimes the bride of this age can feel like the triangle player but you know one thing the symphony according to the sheet music cannot be ended until that triangle player hit that thing. Are you with me this morning? Listen, you may feel like you are a triangle player. This bride may feel like, you know, we've been sitting here and we've been waiting and waiting and waiting. But let me say this. The scripture says, oh, glory be to God. My I got to stop cuz if not, we'll start preaching again. But listen, the scripture says that they shall not be made perfect without us. Listen, until this trigonal player bride hits that thing, the music is not over. Oh well, glory. Until they hit that thing, the music is not yet over. Listen, everyone is playing their pride. But this is your season to arise and shine. The director is saying your hour has come to hit your thing &gt;&gt; because it is the end of the day, the end of the edge. This bright edge is coming to an end. Brother Barry, please come. I am thinking of the rapture and the blessed homo. God bless you. It was wonderful today. Let's sing. our gathering. Oh, how we'll raise the heavenly in that sea in the sky. That's right now. Heat. Heat. There will be a great process. Oh my goal. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Glory. &gt;&gt; I think it's so wonderful how we just don't have to wait. When the redeemed get together, they know how to worship. &gt;&gt; Truly marvelous today to hear once again the word directly from the throne &gt;&gt; to our hearts. &gt;&gt; Certainly thank the Lord for the ministry in brother Max's life and &gt;&gt; how he can just yield himself &gt;&gt; to be a conduit to speak to the bride. My goodness. &gt;&gt; Can we sing hallelujah? What a thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus full salvation. But &gt;&gt; victory. I feel like singing for a little bit. If you feel like you need to go, I certainly don't want to keep you. God richly bless you. If you feel like rejoicing for a little bit, remember the victories in the Old Testament, they were won in the rejoicing. &gt;&gt; If you heard from your theophony today, then just water that word with a little bit of rejoicing and see what happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. What a thought. Jesus for salvation. Victory. Victory. Let the power of sail. Heaven's grace never fail. Amen. Oh, victory. Victory. Yes. Victory. Heat. Heat. I am trusting you. I am standing on you. Victory. Victory. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Amen. Hallelujah. All this rejoicing just makes me want to travel on. How about you? You feel like traveling on? &gt;&gt; My goodness, I feel like traveling on. &gt;&gt; Amen. My heavenly home is bright and fair. I feel like traveling on your death there. I feel like traveling. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. A Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. The Lord's been so good. The Lord has been so good. I feel like Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I feel like I could say a lot, but I don't want to keep us here today. Brother Emanuel, could I invite you to come and close in prayer? Just sing one more song after this. Just so you don't have to be nervous. You're not going to keep us long. Come on, brother. God bless you, brother. May the Lord bless you, saints. &gt;&gt; Are you glad to be in his presence? &gt;&gt; I'm just wondering if we ask Sister Michelle to play the kahoon, how it's going to go. &gt;&gt; Yeah, because she wants to play. No, it doesn't work that way. In this house there is a composer. &gt;&gt; We have his script. &gt;&gt; And that's what we executed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's bow down our hearts. &gt;&gt; Lord, we love you. Lord, we appreciate you. Lord, we adore you. &gt;&gt; Lord, we believe you. We just say, "Help thou our unbelief. &gt;&gt; You are the faithful one and it's all you're doing." We say again, Lord, help us to yield. Oh Lord, help us to let go of ourselves, of our ambitions, of our thoughts, of our desires, and let you have the supreme minutes, Father, because it's all about you. You gave the promise. You gave us the faith to believe. And that is how far we have come. Eeneza, glory to your name. Praise be to your name, Father, for your faithfulness, oh Lord. We love you, oh Lord. But blessed be that plan you had before the foundation of the earth. Father, it is going as planned. Oh Lord, we just come to say glory to your name. We come to say praise be to your name. Oh Lord, there is none like you, oh Lord. We thank you so much, oh Lord, that you've given us this special privilege, Father, to come here and call you our father. to come here believing on you, to come here knowing that you've taken care of everything, Father, and that what is going on now was ordained before the foundation of the earth, and that your purpose will be fulfilled. Lord, we adore you. Lord, we appreciate you. Lord, we magnify your name. We exalt your name. And father, we invite your presence not just in this house, but in these hearts, oh Lord, that are here to surrender, oh Lord, for your purpose to be fulfilled. Lord, we appreciate you so much. Thank you Lord. We have nothing but gratitude &gt;&gt; for such an extraordinary call father and we yield Lord. &gt;&gt; Help us. We know there are many distractions but still you are faithful and we are counting on you. We are believing on you. We are relying on you. We are calling on you. Father have your way. All we do is yield and let you lead the way. &gt;&gt; Yes. Father, we pray that you'll bless my brother. &gt;&gt; That Father, you've encouraged brother Maxwell. &gt;&gt; Father, no one, you can never use a person like that without the devil fighting back. &gt;&gt; And so I'm saying, Lord, visit my brother when he's alone. &gt;&gt; Strengthen him, encourage him, continue to eliminate his parath Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; and do you as you please with this life, &gt;&gt; we are all yours, Lord. We love and appreciate you, Father. And even as we go home, Father, let your presence go with us. &gt;&gt; The first thing the devil would want to do is point to our weaknesses and short ones and say, "You are not part of this." Father, we've claimed it today &gt;&gt; and it's ours forever. &gt;&gt; You did not start a good work to end today. &gt;&gt; It's going all the way into eternity. &gt;&gt; And we appreciate you for that, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless every soul that will even hear this later, Father. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. We love and appreciate you. We adore and believe you. Thank you again for this time together in your presence. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember the youth service we have coming up here this afternoon. Just want to sing one more song. Like I said, the original life. Many times we'll end on a softer, quieter song, but I just feel like rejoicing. And you know, maybe it's part of the Pentecostal experience. Only a select few people understand this song. &gt;&gt; And it's not exclusive by man's doing. It's only by God's doing. &gt;&gt; It's a tremendous thing. You know, if you heard what was preached today, you'll understand. Shalom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's peace be upon you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's sing the song here. God's attributes were manifested to his bride in this last age. We have caught the revelation by the last prophet's message. And we know who we are and what we're raised up for. Praise the Lord. The original life. The original life. The original sea, the original word. That's what I believe. The son of man is revealed. Amen. We are the word made today. This is what the scripture say. And our names are seen within. Yes, we are anointed. Oh, and we are inspired by our God. The original That's what I believe. My man is alive. The original of understanding has opened up at last and sweet victory is ours. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. is the seven seal. Amen. Hallelujah. We are called to adoption full of glory and power saints will wake and join us in this hour. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Heat. Heat. God bless you today. Heat. Heat. See? Good morning. Church. I am very good. Heat. Heat. Oh god.
