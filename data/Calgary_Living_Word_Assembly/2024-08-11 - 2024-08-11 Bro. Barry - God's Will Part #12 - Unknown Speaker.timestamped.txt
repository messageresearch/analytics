[43:05] know under the authority of the Holy
[43:08] Spirit there's no devil that can
[43:11] stand and we just want to pray that
[43:14] Peter Bosch in New Zealand would be able
[43:16] to have an experience with the Holy
[43:19] Ghost and that brother Steven DS would
[43:22] be able to have the testimony that he's
[43:24] gone before the throne for his
[43:26] brother-in-law amen we also want to
[43:28] continue to remember brother mvin
[43:30] Panetta's sister who has a need to be
[43:33] touched by the Lord if you have a need

[43:36] unto him by way of an uplift hand as we

[43:55] morning that would get in the way father
[43:57] that would clog the channels Lord Jesus

[44:05] father we just ask that you would
[44:06] forgive us for it Lord we pray that

[53:05] um never seem to stop getting nervous
[53:08] when we come before the church like this
[53:10] but just a couple of announcements we

[53:40] for everyone to get together and go and
[53:43] Hike once again out in the mountains and
[53:45] uh I understand it was a great success I
[53:48] didn't go but uh one of these times Lord
[53:51] willing I'll go I'm uh still kind of
[53:55] nursing a a
[53:57] a bum KNE but it's just the way it is
[53:59] right now and uh it's okay I'm glad that
[54:02] everyone else can get together and have
[54:03] the fellowship it's wonderful to see the
[54:05] youth get together and be in unity and
[54:08] it doesn't matter what church we're from
[54:10] it doesn't matter what province we're
[54:11] from we all serve the same
[54:14] God this morning I want to talk to us uh
[54:18] I just had this on my heart to get into
[54:20] talking about the spirit of
[54:22] Revival and uh you know we could say
[54:26] that there's times where Revival is
[54:29] important in our lives and there are
[54:31] definitely times where it's important to
[54:32] have Revival there's been specific
[54:35] revivals throughout the ages but I think
[54:38] that we are living in the greatest of
[54:39] revivals if there had to be one I would
[54:42] say it's this revival that we're living
[54:44] in right now and it's the bride's
[54:45] Revival and brother Branham doesn't
[54:47] necessarily word it that way as the
[54:49] bride's Revival but he does word it as
[54:51] the bride age and as we go further into
[54:54] the bride age out of the Leo see an age
[54:57] there is something that has to happen
[54:59] and that is a Revival the spirit of God
[55:02] stir up in the children of God and
[55:04] something happens we cannot come into a
[55:07] service and have the songs played and
[55:11] know what God has done for us and not
[55:13] have a personal Revival that is
[55:16] impossible for a person who knows what
[55:18] it means to be redeemed we know that all
[55:21] Heaven one day will be silent to listen
[55:23] to you worship to listen to me worship
[55:27] and it's got nothing to do with whether
[55:29] I Know chords or keys or notes or
[55:31] anything the word of God says to make a
[55:34] Joyful Noise and he's not going to say
[55:37] to us on that day my is it too cool in
[55:40] here for you or is it too hot in here
[55:43] for you to worship or is the drum beat a
[55:46] little bit too loud for you to worship
[55:48] or is the song leader just singing not
[55:50] the right song so you can't worship all
[55:52] of that's going to be irrelevant he said
[55:55] that if you won't worship me the rocks
[55:57] will immediately cry out unto me amen
[56:00] today we're talking about the spirit of
[56:02] Revival and really I'm just going to
[56:04] jump just the way that I do right to the
[56:06] punchline the spirit of Revival it needs
[56:08] to start right here don't look for
[56:11] anyone else to bring the Revival to your
[56:13] doorstep God's not going to do that he's
[56:16] going to anoint individuals with his
[56:18] spirit and they are going to set the
[56:20] world on fire but it's not even going to
[56:22] be a big Revival we know that's not
[56:24] going to happen we know that when the
[56:25] foolish virgin the unwise Virgin Goes
[56:27] looking for oil it's too late and we
[56:30] know she's already doing that if you
[56:31] look around and you can see what's
[56:33] happening it's already late there's
[56:35] already a shout behold the bridegroom
[56:37] cometh and we know that when that
[56:39] happens rise trim your
[56:42] lamps cuz the bridegroom's coming and we
[56:46] know he's already here we had a
[56:47] Vindicated Prophet stand on Earth and
[56:50] declare he is
[56:54] here some people are looking for for him
[56:56] coming but I'll tell you if you want to
[56:59] look for something look for his going am
[57:02] because that's what's going to happen
[57:03] that's the very next thing to happen in
[57:06] the in the order of
[57:07] events but let us just be glad brothers
[57:10] and sisters and rejoice amen and give
[57:13] honor unto him amen push aside all of
[57:17] the thoughts all of the carnality all of
[57:19] the isms all of the problems and
[57:23] issues he's not looking at them
[57:26] he's looking to see whether we're going
[57:28] to worship Him Hallelujah he gave us
[57:31] problems for a purpose so that we could
[57:33] overcome
[57:35] them and I want to say today if you've
[57:37] got something in your life and you just
[57:40] can't seem to
[57:42] overcome I want to say this you will
[57:47] overcome you have to overcome am because
[57:50] he won't be
[57:52] defeated and if you have his spirit
[57:55] inside of you Brothers sisters it
[57:57] doesn't matter what happens in this
[57:58] flesh remember brother bradam talks
[58:00] about someone who could potentially lose
[58:02] their mind lose their mind and go into
[58:06] an institution and not even be able to
[58:07] care for themselves but if they've got
[58:09] the Holy Ghost it don't
[58:11] matter it don't matter what happens to
[58:14] us in our Flesh on now the prophet for
[58:17] our day he was killed in a car AC no he
[58:19] wasn't he was injured in a car accident
[58:21] wasn't he right and he went into the
[58:24] hospital and we know many people people
[58:26] waited with baited breath thinking many
[58:27] different things were going to happen
[58:28] and I don't think I'd be any different
[58:30] had I been there at the time right but
[58:33] God took him
[58:35] home don't think that it's got to be a
[58:37] specific way a certain time a specific
[58:40] thing don't do that just allow God to
[58:43] move on the scene and see if he won't
[58:45] but just be busy being glad amen and
[58:48] rejoicing and giving honor unto
[58:51] him because the marriage of the Lamb is
[58:54] come it's not coming
[58:56] we talked about it in the past you know
[58:58] Jesus he he he came around and and he
[59:01] talked to his disciples and he called
[59:02] them he called them friends he said I no
[59:05] longer call you servants you're no
[59:06] longer servants I'm going to call you
[59:08] friends from now on because friends they
[59:10] tell friends Secrets they explain things
[59:14] to each other they help them with
[59:16] different things and that's what he said
[59:17] to his disciples you're no longer my
[59:19] servants following me you're now my
[59:21] friends and we know that it it it
[59:23] transpired from there it went further to
[59:26] to mount TR Transfiguration and he
[59:28] showed them some some significant
[59:30] Secrets there we know that a couple of
[59:32] them got to go with him and see Moses
[59:34] and Elijah and a a a time of of of
[59:38] adoption where Jesus was now adopted it
[59:41] wasn't just in the Jordan River he came
[59:43] and had his reignment changed he he
[59:46] changed he was transfigured before their
[59:48] eyes but we know when immediately they
[59:51] wanted to go into the carnal Realms
[59:52] didn't they Peter he he got into his his
[59:55] carnality and he said oh let's let's
[59:57] let's make a tabernacle one for you and
[59:59] and one for John or one for Elias and
[1:00:02] and and one for Moses let's just do this
[1:00:04] trinitarian thing let's just do this
[1:00:06] right and what did the voice out of the
[1:00:08] cloud say the Dark Cloud the bright
[1:00:10] Cloud overshadowed them and said this is
[1:00:13] my beloved Son hear ye him don't don't
[1:00:16] bother trying to do all of the carnal
[1:00:18] things that you think just just be glad
[1:00:20] and rejoice because this is an example
[1:00:23] of the marriage of the Lamb coming
[1:00:26] and the last part of it his
[1:00:29] wife isn't it interesting that brother
[1:00:31] bradam when he was here in the message
[1:00:34] of the hour he said I no longer call you
[1:00:38] church I call you
[1:00:41] bride I call you
[1:00:43] bride we know that when we have a bride
[1:00:46] our bride is before the
[1:00:49] wedding and and what happens is you get
[1:00:52] married the marriage happens and you no
[1:00:55] longer have have a bride sometimes you
[1:00:56] refer to her as a bride and there's
[1:00:58] nothing wrong with that because she's
[1:00:59] always going to be your bride but it
[1:01:01] actually moves from that and and there's
[1:01:03] a legal definition that happens she's no
[1:01:05] longer your bride she becomes your wife
[1:01:08] and the only way that can happen is by
[1:01:10] an intimate
[1:01:12] relationship and I got a little bit of
[1:01:14] inspiration for today out of the the
[1:01:16] marriage of the Lamb if you want to go
[1:01:17] and listen to that message I've got a
[1:01:19] little bit of a quote here that I'll
[1:01:20] bring from it but the marriage of the
[1:01:22] Lamb what a powerful message brothers
[1:01:24] and sisters we have the ability to be
[1:01:27] glad and rejoice and give honor unto him
[1:01:29] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:01:32] and not his bride hath made herself
[1:01:34] ready his bride can't make herself ready
[1:01:36] his wife
[1:01:37] can his wife can because she's at an
[1:01:40] intimate relationship she knows exactly
[1:01:43] what he likes she knows exactly the way
[1:01:45] he likes it I say Lord help me prepare
[1:01:48] it the way that you like it I want to be
[1:01:50] in that position I don't want to be
[1:01:52] pretending I don't want to just assume
[1:01:55] to venture with without Authority I want
[1:01:56] to know that I've got it right but I
[1:01:59] just feel so inspired today just to
[1:02:01] preach to us to preach to me brothers
[1:02:03] and sisters about the spirit of Revival
[1:02:06] let there be a Revival that happens in
[1:02:08] my life and perhaps maybe somehow I
[1:02:12] could be an inspiration to one person to
[1:02:15] actually allow the spirit of God to
[1:02:17] revive in their life amen out of 1954
[1:02:21] Jubilee Year brother bham says that no
[1:02:23] matter how much we try how great we try
[1:02:25] to or organize our people together and
[1:02:27] ban them it takes God to bring a
[1:02:31] Revival it takes God to bring a Revival
[1:02:35] that's why brothers and sisters I keep
[1:02:36] harping on it get the Holy Ghost and
[1:02:38] when you got the Holy Ghost get more
[1:02:40] Holy Ghost amen we got to make sure we
[1:02:43] have enough oil the only difference
[1:02:44] between the two virgins right the the
[1:02:47] five wise and the five unwise they all
[1:02:50] had lamps they all slumbered and slept
[1:02:51] they were all virgins they all even had
[1:02:54] oil
[1:02:56] five of them had enough oil five of them
[1:03:00] didn't how can we have enough oil if we
[1:03:03] don't follow the word for our
[1:03:06] day we need to come to church we need to
[1:03:09] get oil amen we need to sing that song
[1:03:12] In Worship here's my cup Lord I I lift
[1:03:16] it up I lift it up to you Lord because I
[1:03:19] can't get this oil anywhere
[1:03:22] else talking about Revival John Wesley
[1:03:26] you know one of the great ones one of
[1:03:27] the church age
[1:03:29] Messengers hey he said this about
[1:03:32] Revival I continue to dream and pray
[1:03:35] about a Revival of Holiness in our day
[1:03:40] that moves forth in a mission and
[1:03:43] creates authentic
[1:03:45] community in which each person can be
[1:03:49] Unleashed through the empowerment of the
[1:03:52] spirit to fulfill God's creation
[1:03:56] intentions boy that's a mouthful but I
[1:03:59] think if you if you listen to it and and
[1:04:02] maybe if you look it up or just go back
[1:04:04] and and and listen to it it's pretty
[1:04:06] powerful it's almost like the very last
[1:04:08] paragraph or a couple paragraphs of the
[1:04:11] exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:04:13] where brother bradam says I did not come
[1:04:15] to create an organization I I never once
[1:04:18] wanted to organize people what I desire
[1:04:21] is for man to have a true relationship
[1:04:24] with the one living God
[1:04:26] for man and God to have that link again
[1:04:29] that relationship and we know we've
[1:04:31] preached on it before we've all heard it
[1:04:33] I'm sure that the way to the tree of
[1:04:35] life is open now once upon a time when
[1:04:38] Adam and Eve sinned in the garden there
[1:04:41] was a flaming sword cherubims were set
[1:04:43] they were no longer allowed to have
[1:04:45] access to that tree of life when when
[1:04:47] when the son of man Ministry began to
[1:04:50] happen on earth when William Mary and
[1:04:52] Bram was here and that sword was placed
[1:04:54] back in his hand all that Adam lost he
[1:04:56] said had been restored what was lost by
[1:04:58] Adam access to that tree of life now to
[1:05:02] refuse access to that tree of life means
[1:05:04] death Once Upon a Time it meant certain
[1:05:06] death to go into it now to actually
[1:05:09] avoid it is certain death right we're
[1:05:12] not talking about physical death I'm
[1:05:13] sure that for Adam and Eve it was
[1:05:15] physical death I I don't know if anybody
[1:05:18] knows whether it was physical death or
[1:05:19] not I don't know it could be a a point
[1:05:22] of discussion but I don't think it
[1:05:23] matters today we're talking about
[1:05:25] spiritual death because we could leave
[1:05:27] this service today and say that was a
[1:05:29] wonderful service brother Barry maybe he
[1:05:31] preached good maybe he preached bad
[1:05:33] whatever happened we went and we had a
[1:05:35] little bit of worship and we heard a
[1:05:36] little bit of word and we can go on our
[1:05:37] way now and we're not going to
[1:05:39] necessarily get hit by a car because
[1:05:42] maybe we just didn't give our whole
[1:05:44] heart to God in that service maybe we
[1:05:46] had some reservations we're still going
[1:05:48] to go on and we'll still live our
[1:05:50] lives we're talking about spiritual
[1:05:53] death brothers and sisters physically
[1:05:55] we're going to survive physically we'll
[1:05:57] be okay this is about spiritual death to
[1:05:59] know that we know that we know in case
[1:06:01] we do get hit by a car glory be to
[1:06:05] God if I have to go to heaven today I've
[1:06:09] won we don't have to fear death right
[1:06:13] but that's where the devil resides in
[1:06:14] that great fear oh what if you're going
[1:06:16] to fail oh what if you die one of those
[1:06:18] two things is going to happen to you oh
[1:06:19] my what's going to happen to you I know
[1:06:23] what's going to happen I'm going to go
[1:06:24] on to Glory
[1:06:26] I'll go on and I'll see all those people
[1:06:28] who fought this fight all the way to the
[1:06:32] very end and you know not because they
[1:06:34] could it's because the spirit of God in
[1:06:36] them could and that's the only thing
[1:06:38] we've got to do is surrender to that
[1:06:40] Spirit when we do that you can't help
[1:06:42] but Rejoice There Ain't No Reservations
[1:06:45] with it I just I just love this out of
[1:06:47] the third seal in 1963 brother Bram he
[1:06:51] preached a series of of sermons The
[1:06:53] Seven Seals and some people actually
[1:06:55] might contest this and and whatever
[1:06:58] we're preaching to Believers here today
[1:07:00] out of the Seven Seals in the third seal
[1:07:02] brother bradam in paragraph 182 he says
[1:07:04] now that's what the reason today that
[1:07:07] the revivals that we're supposed to have
[1:07:09] we have de denominational revivals we
[1:07:13] haven't had a real stirring no no no sir
[1:07:18] don't think we got revivals we haven't
[1:07:21] oh they've got millions and millions and
[1:07:24] millions of church members but not a
[1:07:27] Revival
[1:07:29] nowhere that's amazing isn't it because
[1:07:32] during that time there was some pretty
[1:07:33] significant revivals wasn't there a
[1:07:35] Revival of ausa Street wasn't that a
[1:07:37] great Revival was wasn't there great
[1:07:39] revivals going on there's been revivals
[1:07:42] but here we have the Vindicated Prophet
[1:07:44] saying no it ain't nothing yet the bride
[1:07:48] hasn't had a Revival yet see there's
[1:07:51] been no Revival there no manifestation
[1:07:54] of God to stir the bride yet see we're
[1:07:57] looking for it now and we know it'll
[1:08:00] take those seven unknown Thunders back
[1:08:02] there to wake her up again see yeah
[1:08:06] he'll send it he promised it now watch
[1:08:09] now brothers and sisters I'm not
[1:08:11] preaching a Thunder's Doctrine I'm not
[1:08:13] saying that we've got to have anything
[1:08:14] unknown because I'm saying that
[1:08:16] everything in the message is
[1:08:18] known the entire message has been
[1:08:21] revealed to us if we're willing to take
[1:08:23] a look at it entirely it's completely
[1:08:26] open all seven seals are all the way
[1:08:29] open you can't have the first seal open
[1:08:31] unless you open the seventh seal because
[1:08:33] the seventh seal was on the outside of
[1:08:34] the scroll and when you open a scroll
[1:08:37] you actually have to open the first seal
[1:08:39] it's not on the inside it's on the
[1:08:41] outside that seventh seal seals all of
[1:08:43] them anyways I I just think it's a
[1:08:46] beautiful thing here how how we go I'm
[1:08:48] I'm just going to preach the way we do
[1:08:49] here we uh we deal with a lot of quotes
[1:08:52] and I think it's so important for us to
[1:08:54] say what the prophet ET said we we've
[1:08:56] got a bit of time left here and I I
[1:08:58] trust it's okay out of the exposition of
[1:09:00] the seven Church ages at the patmas
[1:09:02] vision brother bamy says let me just use
[1:09:04] another illustration suppose you need
[1:09:06] healing what does the word say well we
[1:09:09] have all read it countless times but did
[1:09:10] not get in the spirit when reading it
[1:09:13] right it's important to get in the
[1:09:15] spirit and I want to say the spirit of
[1:09:17] Revival this morning when we get the
[1:09:20] spirit when we get into the spirit
[1:09:21] brothers and sisters there's something
[1:09:23] that stir our hearts it stir our soul
[1:09:26] we know what the Lord has done for us
[1:09:28] suppose you need healing what does the
[1:09:30] word say well we've all read it
[1:09:31] countless times but did not get in the
[1:09:33] spirit when reading it did we did we ask
[1:09:36] God for his Spirit to teach us the real
[1:09:39] truth of it if we did we would call the
[1:09:42] Elders confess our sins be anointed and
[1:09:44] prayed for and that would be that isn't
[1:09:48] that beautiful it would that would be
[1:09:50] that it would just be it I'm sure that
[1:09:52] we've all encountered it in the past
[1:09:55] it might not come immediately but in his
[1:09:58] spirit it's all over there's no other
[1:10:02] court of appeal God will fulfill his
[1:10:05] word he says oh we need to get in the
[1:10:09] spirit and then things will be done
[1:10:13] don't go through the acts first get in
[1:10:16] the spirit and then go through the acts
[1:10:19] and watch what God will do amen many
[1:10:22] times we will try to emphasize ize the
[1:10:26] mechanics we have to do the mechanics
[1:10:28] we've got to get the mechanics right if
[1:10:30] you don't get the mechanics right you
[1:10:32] can actually really upset things and I'm
[1:10:35] sort of embarking a little bit more into
[1:10:36] mechanics my own self these days and and
[1:10:39] as I look at things I think it's
[1:10:40] interesting I once upon a time was a
[1:10:43] mechanics Helper and really really got
[1:10:45] into engines and and all the timing of
[1:10:49] engines and all the moving parts inside
[1:10:50] of a internal combustion engine and you
[1:10:53] know if you get one thing off inside an
[1:10:56] internal combustion engine everything
[1:10:57] happens so quickly and so simultaneously
[1:11:00] one little thing off can cause
[1:11:02] everything to blow up we have to have
[1:11:04] mechanics but brothers and sisters it
[1:11:06] ain't going to do us any good if we
[1:11:07] don't have
[1:11:09] Dynamics and when the Dynamics come when
[1:11:11] we've got all the mechanics in place why
[1:11:13] would be we be afraid to actually turn
[1:11:16] the key and give it
[1:11:17] spark why would we be afraid of that we
[1:11:21] need to give it gas we need to give it
[1:11:23] spark but then brothers and sisters once
[1:11:25] it starts step on the gas
[1:11:28] pedal he wants us to don't go through
[1:11:30] the acts first get in the spirit and
[1:11:33] watch what will happen watch what God
[1:11:36] will do he has that in capital letters
[1:11:38] there watch what God will do
[1:11:42] am and you know talking about Services
[1:11:45] specifically when we get into
[1:11:47] church many times we have folks that are
[1:11:51] afraid to get into the
[1:11:53] spirit what what would the neighbor say
[1:11:56] what what would my family
[1:11:58] say maybe what would the deacons say
[1:12:01] right maybe what would the mus musicians
[1:12:04] say right what what would other people
[1:12:08] say maybe we're on YouTube what would
[1:12:12] people watching say brothers and sisters
[1:12:15] we got to come to the place
[1:12:16] where who
[1:12:18] cares because the only thing that
[1:12:20] matters is what he
[1:12:22] says that's all that matters amen
[1:12:25] because if we're afraid to declare him
[1:12:27] here remember the word says that he'll
[1:12:29] be afraid to declare us there right
[1:12:32] right I think it's interesting sometimes
[1:12:34] we look at little children and just see
[1:12:36] them worship freely worship they have no
[1:12:39] inhibitions they haven't maybe had
[1:12:42] situations in their lives that have
[1:12:45] changed the way they see things and uh
[1:12:48] you know the word says also that unless
[1:12:50] we're willing to come as one of them we
[1:12:52] won't even see the kingdom of God
[1:12:55] brother Brandon goes on to say have you
[1:12:57] ever noticed how the world gets into the
[1:12:59] spirit of
[1:13:01] things that are in the
[1:13:03] world they go to their ball
[1:13:06] games I'm going to say their hockey
[1:13:10] games they go to their sporting events
[1:13:13] and their
[1:13:14] dances they enter into the spirit of it
[1:13:18] right they don't sit there like wallf
[1:13:20] flowers all dried up
[1:13:23] sticks brothers and sisters don't think
[1:13:25] that it's culturally our thing to just
[1:13:29] be quiet and just be in church and just
[1:13:31] be quiet and just be calm right I'm not
[1:13:35] trying to give us a pep rally but what
[1:13:37] I'm trying to say is if there's any
[1:13:39] place in this world that we can get
[1:13:41] excited brothers and sisters this is
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:47] it I'll say this way I know people
[1:13:50] they'll just be like yeah you know amen
[1:13:54] yep maybe they'll let out an
[1:13:57] amen once in a while but if they go to a
[1:14:00] hockey game or see something on a screen
[1:14:03] somewhere and their favorite team makes
[1:14:05] a goal they're not afraid to say
[1:14:09] yeah where do we stand when we recognize
[1:14:12] what it means to be
[1:14:15] redeemed sir to know that we're not
[1:14:18] going to spend eternity in a place that
[1:14:20] was created maybe not eternity forgive
[1:14:23] me right
[1:14:25] forever and ever in a place that was
[1:14:28] created for the devil and his angels
[1:14:30] that's right we don't have to do that
[1:14:34] you don't even have to be afraid of that
[1:14:36] that's right prise the Lord we don't
[1:14:38] have to have any fear for
[1:14:40] that brother Bram he says these people
[1:14:42] in the world these people in the world
[1:14:45] they go to their ball games their
[1:14:47] sporting events and their dances and
[1:14:48] they enter right in the spirit of it and
[1:14:51] I'm going to say this and forgive me for
[1:14:53] saying it I I I was in the world world I
[1:14:56] want to tell you the spirit of Revival
[1:14:58] in another human being witnessed to me
[1:15:00] in my
[1:15:02] spirit it was not a human attraction
[1:15:05] from a man to a woman but that Spirit of
[1:15:08] Revival witnessed to me in my spirit and
[1:15:10] at that time I wasn't afraid to go to
[1:15:13] the clubs and I'll tell you something
[1:15:15] when people go to the clubs if you've
[1:15:17] ever been there they don't set still
[1:15:20] everyone is moving and into the spirit
[1:15:23] of it now I'm not saying we need to act
[1:15:26] like this is a club don't get me
[1:15:29] wrong but to actually be redeemed to
[1:15:32] know what God has done for us and and
[1:15:35] and to not be able to give him praise Or
[1:15:37] Glory or anything and just be Stone Cold
[1:15:41] and and be like a dried up stick like
[1:15:43] brother bram's talking about I believe
[1:15:44] there's something
[1:15:46] wrong he said the people in the world
[1:15:49] they enter into the spirit of it you
[1:15:50] might say brother Barry that's going a
[1:15:52] little bit too far talking that way just
[1:15:53] read what the prophet said
[1:15:55] better yet read what God Said through
[1:15:57] the prophet they enter into the spirit
[1:16:00] of it they don't sit there like wall
[1:16:03] flowers all dried up sticks they enter
[1:16:05] right into the feeli of things and
[1:16:07] become a part of things oh but how they
[1:16:11] hate Christians for getting in the
[1:16:12] spirit of God's word right right the
[1:16:16] spirit of Revival brothers and sisters
[1:16:19] let it start right
[1:16:21] here oh how they hate Christians for
[1:16:23] getting into the spirit of God's word
[1:16:25] they call us Fanatics and holy rollers
[1:16:28] there's nothing they won't do to show
[1:16:30] their hatred and disapproval but you can
[1:16:33] ignore
[1:16:34] that you can expect it right right
[1:16:37] knowing where it's coming from just go
[1:16:39] on and get in the spirit of worship and
[1:16:42] I want to say today just go on and get
[1:16:44] in the spirit of
[1:16:46] Revival the spirit of worship will take
[1:16:48] you right into the spirit of Revival and
[1:16:50] what will happen is it will become
[1:16:51] Perpetual in your
[1:16:53] life the Lord
[1:16:56] this is where I want to get to here
[1:16:57] brother brandham he says it God said
[1:16:59] through brother brandham the SP our
[1:17:00] spirit is clean brothers and sisters
[1:17:02] when we're talking about getting excited
[1:17:04] when we're talking about clapping our
[1:17:06] hands when we're talking about jumping
[1:17:08] up and down when we're talking about
[1:17:10] maybe running around the building
[1:17:11] because we just don't know what to do
[1:17:13] there's just so much inspiration so much
[1:17:15] stimulation of the Revelation that God
[1:17:17] has given us by placing an open word
[1:17:19] back in our hands remember this quote
[1:17:23] right here brother bradam says our
[1:17:25] spirit is clean it's not the filthy
[1:17:27] spirit in the club we don't have to be
[1:17:30] ashamed about standing up and saying
[1:17:32] glory to God I'm saved our spirit is
[1:17:37] clean it's fresh it's
[1:17:39] real it's not fake it's not
[1:17:41] impersonation it's not something that
[1:17:43] we're just trying to put on when you see
[1:17:46] someone get excited get excited for them
[1:17:49] if you can't get excited
[1:17:51] yourself remember it's real it's sober
[1:17:55] and serious but nonetheless full of the
[1:17:58] joy of the
[1:17:59] [Applause]
[1:18:01] Lord so here we go now we're getting
[1:18:03] into the sentence I want to say brother
[1:18:05] brandham or or the spirit of God or
[1:18:08] brother Barry who who maybe brother Vil
[1:18:11] maybe someone would want to jump up and
[1:18:12] say well he was the grammarian of the
[1:18:14] book so maybe it was brother Vil that
[1:18:16] said this the Christian ought to be just
[1:18:19] as exuberant and full of his pleasure in
[1:18:22] the Lord yes amen amen amen preach it as
[1:18:27] the world is when it Savers and delights
[1:18:31] in its Pleasures
[1:18:35] amen no I'm not
[1:18:38] saying don't wear a shirt
[1:18:41] men and paint yourself Calgary Living
[1:18:43] Word colors and come to
[1:18:46] service I'll never forget brother Ken
[1:18:49] talking about that how people in
[1:18:50] Saskatchewan for the Saskatchewan Rough
[1:18:52] Riders they'll paint themselves all
[1:18:53] green and they'll go to the game and
[1:18:56] they'll just be all green they won't
[1:18:57] even have a shirt on and they'll just be
[1:19:00] doing their thing with their beer in
[1:19:01] each hand same thing for the Stampeders
[1:19:04] only they're
[1:19:05] red but where are we when we recognize
[1:19:08] what God's done for
[1:19:10] us remember he said it's real it's sober
[1:19:14] and it's serious but nonetheless just as
[1:19:18] exuberant the Christian ought to be just
[1:19:20] as exuberant and full of his pleasure in
[1:19:23] the Lord as the word world is when it
[1:19:25] savors and delights in its Pleasures
[1:19:28] amen both Christians and the world are
[1:19:31] human both have emotions the difference
[1:19:34] is the Christians hearts and emotions
[1:19:37] are purely on The Lord Of Glory and his
[1:19:40] love while the world satisfies the
[1:19:44] flesh so if you have any quarrels any
[1:19:48] concerns about getting excited about the
[1:19:50] word of God brothers and sisters about
[1:19:52] seeing that fire of Revival igniting
[1:19:54] your life just read this
[1:19:56] quote that's good we ought to be just as
[1:19:59] exuberant so what holds us back that's
[1:20:02] the question I want to pose to us I want
[1:20:04] to keep asking it what what's holding us
[1:20:06] back that's good from burning the roof
[1:20:09] off this
[1:20:10] building knowing what he's done for
[1:20:14] us if we're redeemed and we know what it
[1:20:16] means to be redeemed that means to be
[1:20:18] bought back not not not just purchased
[1:20:21] one day you always were his amen we
[1:20:24] always were his from before the
[1:20:26] foundation of the world and now we find
[1:20:28] ourselves purchased back out of the pawn
[1:20:31] shop out of Satan's pawn shop he chose
[1:20:34] us we never chose
[1:20:38] him that takes it to a whole another
[1:20:40] level when we start looking at it that
[1:20:42] way yes sir he chose us to have ears to
[1:20:45] hear what the spirit would say to the
[1:20:47] church in our day right that's
[1:20:51] right remember we ought to be more just
[1:20:53] as exuberant
[1:20:57] remember
[1:20:58] modesty I'll say that when you come to
[1:21:00] service just remember that don't don't
[1:21:02] be getting crazy
[1:21:05] now out of the Prophet Elisha 1954
[1:21:09] brother bradam says now
[1:21:13] Elijah he was all that Prophet I may not
[1:21:16] have given you this one I apologize
[1:21:18] brother you know prophets get angry
[1:21:21] sometime right or he did
[1:21:25] so he got all out of
[1:21:27] humor and he being out of humor this may
[1:21:32] hurt just a little bit someone but I I
[1:21:35] say it reverently now
[1:21:37] notice he said if I didn't respect
[1:21:40] josephat I was going to get into this
[1:21:42] story today just for the record but I I
[1:21:44] didn't for time's sake because I want to
[1:21:46] focus on the spirit of
[1:21:48] Revival but here we have the prophet of
[1:21:50] God he gets talking to someone who's a a
[1:21:54] make believer I believe it's Ahab in
[1:21:57] this scenario I could be wrong it might
[1:22:00] not be Ahab but but he he he gets called
[1:22:03] to the scenario he gets called to the
[1:22:04] situation the prophet of God and and he
[1:22:07] says you know if it wasn't for this one
[1:22:09] righteous man I would not even look at
[1:22:12] you because you're a backslider and you
[1:22:14] know it you know exactly what you've
[1:22:16] done wrong you know exactly where you
[1:22:18] stand but if it wasn't for this man of
[1:22:20] God I'd have nothing to do with
[1:22:23] you now medely
[1:22:27] said notice he said if I didn't respect
[1:22:29] josephat I wouldn't even look at you
[1:22:31] nevertheless bring me a
[1:22:33] Minstrel interesting a stringed
[1:22:37] instrument bring bring the prophet a
[1:22:39] Minstrel and what was he
[1:22:41] doing he was actually warding off the
[1:22:44] evil spirits and he was calling on the
[1:22:47] holy spirit before the Holy Spirit was
[1:22:49] given right we know
[1:22:52] that bring me a Minstrel
[1:22:55] that's some music brother bradam says
[1:22:58] now some people criticize music in the
[1:23:02] church what's happening when you're
[1:23:04] criticizing music in the church brothers
[1:23:06] and sisters I want to get into this
[1:23:08] we're going to get into worship I told
[1:23:10] you we would for a long time and now
[1:23:12] we're beginning with the spirit of
[1:23:14] Revival when we're criticizing music in
[1:23:17] the church what we're doing is we're
[1:23:19] being tricked by the devil to not
[1:23:22] worship the devil is causing you to not
[1:23:26] worship right God's given us a building
[1:23:29] he's given us musicians tremendous gifts
[1:23:32] in the body absolutely tremendous gifts
[1:23:34] in the body he's given us all the
[1:23:36] instruments he's given us all the space
[1:23:38] we need he's given us the comforting the
[1:23:40] heating the air conditioning everything
[1:23:42] we need sound sound stuff we've got
[1:23:45] microphone everything we need to
[1:23:48] worship amen so what do we have what's
[1:23:51] hindering us from worshiping what's
[1:23:52] what's what's stopping us from from
[1:23:54] giving our very best all the way to God
[1:23:57] that he's looking for in our lives when
[1:23:59] the song leader comes up here and and
[1:24:02] sometimes once in a while it's just
[1:24:04] spontaneous worship it just happens but
[1:24:07] other times it's like we're waiting
[1:24:08] through a swamp oh my how do we get the
[1:24:12] people to sing oh let's raise our hands
[1:24:15] let's clap our hands brothers and
[1:24:17] sisters it shouldn't be like that the
[1:24:18] people in the audience in the
[1:24:20] congregation ought to be encouraging the
[1:24:22] song leader
[1:24:25] in fact I think the congregation has the
[1:24:27] ability to take the song leader off of
[1:24:29] his songs that he has already prepared
[1:24:31] beforeand and given to the song booth
[1:24:34] and just lead in spontaneous worship
[1:24:36] songs that weren't even on his
[1:24:40] notes
[1:24:42] remember what operates the
[1:24:45] gift it's the
[1:24:48] people if you want to see different
[1:24:50] worship
[1:24:52] Services bring it
[1:24:55] don't look for them to give it to you
[1:24:58] you're the one that brings it to
[1:25:01] them if you want to see better piano
[1:25:04] playing not that it's bad
[1:25:08] honey go on your knees and pray amen and
[1:25:12] say Lord change her
[1:25:15] heart change the way she
[1:25:18] plays if you have a a brother singing
[1:25:20] someone on the organ maybe the guitar
[1:25:23] maybe the boom box whatever it is if you
[1:25:25] want to see a change make that change
[1:25:28] make it on your knees see if God isn't
[1:25:31] God because he will come on the scene
[1:25:33] and change
[1:25:35] it but first you got to get right right
[1:25:40] but if you're busy criticizing then
[1:25:41] you're just falling for the devil you're
[1:25:44] just taking his bait and what's
[1:25:45] happening is you're missing out and
[1:25:47] you're wrecking it for everyone else
[1:25:49] come on now because we're not wrestling
[1:25:51] against flesh and blood when we come
[1:25:52] into this building brothers and sisters
[1:25:53] it's Prin principalities and powers and
[1:25:55] I guarantee you we have more in here
[1:25:58] than we can see there's more for us than
[1:26:00] there are against us but Satan comes to
[1:26:03] church and he wants to distract us he
[1:26:06] just wants to stop us from worshiping he
[1:26:08] wants us to think about that brother and
[1:26:10] what he did or what he didn't and that
[1:26:12] sister and what she did or what she
[1:26:14] didn't and that other thing and and the
[1:26:16] other way and all these different things
[1:26:17] and maybe it's not the way that I used
[1:26:19] to when I was a kid or the way my pastor
[1:26:21] did when I was young preaching now God
[1:26:24] doesn't care about all that what about
[1:26:27] right
[1:26:29] now just like we want his grace right
[1:26:31] now we want to forget we want to take
[1:26:33] all of our sin and put it in the sea of
[1:26:35] his forgetfulness why don't we just
[1:26:36] start doing that with our
[1:26:38] Traditions why don't we start taking all
[1:26:40] of our our teachings and just put them
[1:26:42] in the sea of his forgetfulness and say
[1:26:44] Lord if there's something more for me
[1:26:46] show me
[1:26:48] am be it unto
[1:26:50] me according to Thy Word
[1:26:54] but some people criticize music in the
[1:26:57] church but if music brought the spirit
[1:27:00] on the prophet then it'll do the same
[1:27:04] thing today
[1:27:05] see bring me a
[1:27:11] Minstrel my and they went and got a
[1:27:14] Minstrel and they began to play some
[1:27:17] real good hymn oh my I love this and
[1:27:21] what does he go on to say and the
[1:27:23] prophet said in there I imagine and
[1:27:25] after a minstral played a long time and
[1:27:28] the prophet got out of his bad mood and
[1:27:31] began to think on God after a while the
[1:27:33] spirit of the Lord come on
[1:27:36] him and when the spirit of the Lord come
[1:27:38] on him he began to see visions and
[1:27:42] brother that's what's the matter with
[1:27:43] the church today the reason we don't see
[1:27:47] visions and have just a little
[1:27:50] narrow-minded thought is because we
[1:27:52] don't pray long enough or do something
[1:27:55] long enough until the spirit of God
[1:27:58] comes into our midst now I'm just going
[1:28:01] to throw this in there because I'm a
[1:28:03] pastor and this is my position here I
[1:28:05] want to say this we have the prophet
[1:28:07] saying that I want to say we've got this
[1:28:10] many people they come to church on
[1:28:12] Sunday there's less people that come to
[1:28:14] church on Wednesdays and how many people
[1:28:17] come to church for a prayer meeting
[1:28:20] right right right do we want to see more
[1:28:23] of God yeah do we want to see the power
[1:28:26] of God move in our midst right brothers
[1:28:28] and sisters where are we
[1:28:32] at we've got the whole open word we've
[1:28:34] got the full access to the tree of
[1:28:37] life right don't rely on the tree of
[1:28:40] knowledge of Good and
[1:28:42] Evil now some will say brother Barry you
[1:28:45] don't know my life you don't know my
[1:28:46] commitments and no I don't but I'll tell
[1:28:48] you what if you're willing to make a
[1:28:51] sacrifice right right you know I had a
[1:28:55] pastor and I'm so thankful for brother
[1:28:57] Ken because he taught me the truth he
[1:29:00] raised me up in the message of the hour
[1:29:03] the right way God bless you brother
[1:29:05] Ken but you know what he said he said
[1:29:08] any excuse is good enough when you
[1:29:10] really don't want to do something right
[1:29:12] and I know by experience brothers and
[1:29:14] sisters by owning my own business and
[1:29:16] and by being busy and all the different
[1:29:18] things in life when you want to do
[1:29:20] something you're going to do it am
[1:29:22] that's what happens you'll go into your
[1:29:24] schedule and you'll say I'm going to
[1:29:25] adjust this to here because I've got
[1:29:27] that right there and and you know what
[1:29:30] that right there is probably more
[1:29:31] important than the other thing over
[1:29:33] there amen you can do that in your life
[1:29:36] and if you think you can't just try it
[1:29:38] once try it once take a little step
[1:29:41] forwards into the kingdom of God say
[1:29:44] Lord I don't know how I'm ever going to
[1:29:45] do that I don't know how I can not take
[1:29:47] this one extra shift because it's going
[1:29:49] to help provide but I guarantee you if
[1:29:51] you do something like that for the Lord
[1:29:54] say Lord I just Commit This unto you I'm
[1:29:56] going to go to a prayer meeting I've
[1:29:57] never done it before in my life but I'm
[1:29:59] just going to put aside all of my
[1:30:01] carnality and I'm going to go and take
[1:30:03] that
[1:30:04] step guarantee you God won't leave you
[1:30:06] destitute that's right he's the god that
[1:30:09] will reward you a h
[1:30:11] hundredfold not just twofold or or
[1:30:15] tenfold look a 100 or thousandfold I'm
[1:30:17] not preaching a Prosperity Gospel what I
[1:30:19] am preaching is the the real present
[1:30:21] tense I am he's a God that Rewards that
[1:30:24] way am just try
[1:30:27] him but the reason we don't see
[1:30:30] visions and have just a little
[1:30:33] narrow-minded thought the music is too
[1:30:36] fast the music is too slow the brother
[1:30:39] reads too many
[1:30:41] quotes is because we don't pray long
[1:30:43] enough or do something long enough until
[1:30:46] the spirit of God comes into our midst
[1:30:49] if we used to sing the oldfashioned
[1:30:51] songs till tears run down our cheeks and
[1:30:53] I know some will say well that's the
[1:30:55] reason brother
[1:30:56] Barry we used to sing the old-fashioned
[1:30:59] hymns and unless we sing an
[1:31:00] old-fashioned hymn the spirit of God's
[1:31:02] not going to
[1:31:03] come is that right no it's not right no
[1:31:08] way because it's not about the song
[1:31:11] that's right right it's about the heart
[1:31:13] of the individual singing the song Amen
[1:31:16] if we've got the wrong heart we can sing
[1:31:18] an oldfashioned hymn brothers and
[1:31:20] sisters if we've got bitterness in our
[1:31:22] heart it don't matter whether we're sing
[1:31:24] in an oldfashioned hymn in our
[1:31:26] hearts and unfortunately when people
[1:31:29] want to try and put God in that type of
[1:31:31] a box and say that unless you sing songs
[1:31:33] this way unless you sing these songs I
[1:31:36] want to say this you probably got a
[1:31:38] little bit of bitterness somewhere
[1:31:40] inside there maybe you need to take a
[1:31:42] look and try and get it out of
[1:31:45] there because God will not be put in a
[1:31:48] box we serve a mighty God this is the
[1:31:51] god that hung the universe
[1:31:53] [Applause]
[1:31:57] but we used to sing the oldfashioned
[1:32:00] songs till tears run down their cheeks
[1:32:04] and sinners got
[1:32:06] saved even before the preacher got to
[1:32:08] the
[1:32:09] platform so what's happened what's
[1:32:14] changed maybe some would say well it was
[1:32:17] that time it was that revival time it
[1:32:19] was the age of the
[1:32:20] Revival was it maybe
[1:32:24] but I want to say we're not living in
[1:32:25] another Revival we're living in the
[1:32:27] bride's Revival brothers and sisters
[1:32:29] this is the age that all of the prophets
[1:32:32] they diligently searched for this Daniel
[1:32:36] he said let me look at it Lord I know
[1:32:39] it's
[1:32:40] there and we know the Lord said to him
[1:32:43] it's not for you son just just live your
[1:32:45] life in peace and know that you live to
[1:32:47] a ripe old
[1:32:48] age that Temple that you desired to see
[1:32:51] It'll be restored don't worry and
[1:32:53] everything's going to be fine but it's
[1:32:55] not for you it's for another group of
[1:32:57] people who's that other group of people
[1:33:00] hallelujah this other group of people is
[1:33:02] right here
[1:33:03] today were those
[1:33:07] people he used to sing the oldfashioned
[1:33:09] songs till tears run down their cheeks
[1:33:12] and sinners got saved even before the
[1:33:14] preacher got to the platform I can't
[1:33:16] help but think that is a powerful
[1:33:18] service before the preacher got to the
[1:33:21] platform
[1:33:26] Lord let this not be us but today we
[1:33:30] just have the old ritual oh I'm I'm
[1:33:33] going to come to service just after most
[1:33:36] of the songs are sung just so I don't
[1:33:38] have to listen to that beat just so I
[1:33:41] don't have to listen to that song leader
[1:33:43] I'm I'm just going to come and maybe
[1:33:44] glean a couple things out of the service
[1:33:46] and then I'm going to run out the door
[1:33:47] quick before I don't have to shake
[1:33:48] anybody's head nobody gets to talk to me
[1:33:51] not going to do that what are we doing
[1:33:54] why would we even bother coming to
[1:33:55] church but you know brothers and sisters
[1:33:58] what example does that set for our
[1:34:00] [Music]
[1:34:02] children but people used to get saved
[1:34:04] before the preacher even got to the
[1:34:06] platform can you imagine what kind of an
[1:34:09] atmosphere that
[1:34:10] was why am I saying it that way because
[1:34:13] I want to see it that
[1:34:15] way let's set that atmosphere brothers
[1:34:17] and sisters where people can come in off
[1:34:19] the street and get saved even before the
[1:34:22] preaching of the word just for being in
[1:34:24] the
[1:34:26] atmosphere and and I apologize if if if
[1:34:30] somebody feels like we're already there
[1:34:31] and it's already happening God bless you
[1:34:33] for putting your shoulder to the wheel
[1:34:35] and coming and and
[1:34:37] worshiping but if it pinches a little
[1:34:40] bit it pinches me a little bit it makes
[1:34:42] me think what am I doing what am I not
[1:34:44] doing I I want to see the power of God
[1:34:46] move in the service here I want to see
[1:34:48] our children get
[1:34:50] saved I want to see the husbands have
[1:34:53] such a REV in their lives that they set
[1:34:55] the example for their entire families
[1:34:58] amen where the husbands hunger and
[1:35:01] thirst for righteousness and their wives
[1:35:04] they look at their husbands and they say
[1:35:06] who are you and what have you done with
[1:35:08] my husband because I don't recognize you
[1:35:12] something's different about
[1:35:14] you that's what I want to see the
[1:35:17] husbands getting all the way into Christ
[1:35:20] and then the wives following their
[1:35:22] husbands and saying you're my Lord I
[1:35:25] want to serve you because I know that
[1:35:27] the prophet said as I serve you I serve
[1:35:30] God and it's not about slavery it's
[1:35:33] about realizing their husband is leading
[1:35:35] the family to
[1:35:37] Zion and the children have the desire to
[1:35:40] serve God with all their hearts because
[1:35:42] they know Mom and Dad serve a living God
[1:35:45] it's not just a dead tradition we go to
[1:35:48] church on Sunday we say we claim to
[1:35:50] believe the message of the hour but we
[1:35:52] don't live it yes sir you know brother
[1:35:55] bradam talks about it when a page is
[1:35:57] sealed my when a page is sealed it's
[1:35:59] sealed on both sides if you've ever seen
[1:36:02] one of those stamps we' got one in the
[1:36:04] back office for Calgary living W when we
[1:36:07] got Incorporated you can take a check
[1:36:09] and stick it in there it's for
[1:36:10] certifying checks and you stamp it and
[1:36:13] when you stamp it it stamps the stamp
[1:36:15] into the page and what happens is on
[1:36:18] both sides of the page you can see the
[1:36:20] exact stamp and it's the same with the
[1:36:23] human life brother bradam says it when a
[1:36:25] person is sealed it's sealed on both
[1:36:27] sides you're not one person at church
[1:36:29] and another person at home and if you
[1:36:31] are just say Lord help me I don't want
[1:36:34] to be that
[1:36:36] way I sure hope you don't want to be
[1:36:39] that way EXA I don't want to be that way
[1:36:43] we used to sing the oldfashioned songs
[1:36:45] till tears run down their cheeks and
[1:36:47] sinners got saved even before the
[1:36:49] preacher got to the platform but today
[1:36:52] we just have
[1:36:54] the old ritual cut and dried
[1:36:57] program we got to go through this and
[1:36:59] that and the other I'm afraid we're
[1:37:02] grieving the spirit of God away from us
[1:37:04] that's right don't you think
[1:37:06] so brothers and sisters we don't want to
[1:37:09] do
[1:37:09] that we want to say if the spirit of the
[1:37:12] Lord is moving in a song service let's
[1:37:15] sing another song Amen of course we want
[1:37:18] to be fed but it's Sunday right let's
[1:37:22] set aside Sunday for the the
[1:37:24] Lord some of us can't but if we could
[1:37:27] say just sing another song and and let
[1:37:31] that minst will be played and push back
[1:37:33] the powers of darkness and open up a a a
[1:37:36] a place for the Lord to come in and and
[1:37:39] and just give us that blessing that he
[1:37:41] wants to give us a thousand times more
[1:37:43] than we're willing to receive it if we
[1:37:45] could just do that get outside of our
[1:37:47] our tradition and just allow the Lord to
[1:37:50] move amen marriages would be healed
[1:37:54] amen relationships would be
[1:37:57] better children might want to serve the
[1:38:00] Living
[1:38:04] God but I'm afraid we're grieving the
[1:38:07] spirit of God away from
[1:38:09] us we just have an old ritual cut and
[1:38:12] dried
[1:38:15] program
[1:38:17] my I don't want to have an old ritual no
[1:38:21] I don't want a cut and dried program
[1:38:24] us we have to do it this way and we have
[1:38:26] to do it that way no way no way we've
[1:38:30] got to be willing to allow the spirit of
[1:38:33] God to move where the spirit of the Lord
[1:38:34] is there's
[1:38:35] liberty amen and you know when we have
[1:38:38] Liberty that means we have freedom
[1:38:40] that's right if if the spirit of the
[1:38:43] Lord wants to worship a little longer if
[1:38:45] the spirit of the Lord wants to preach a
[1:38:47] little longer if the spirit of the Lord
[1:38:48] wants to preach a little
[1:38:50] shorter and just allow the singing to be
[1:38:53] a little
[1:38:53] longer if if the spirit of the Lord
[1:38:56] wants the singing to be a little
[1:38:58] louder if the spirit of the Lord wants
[1:39:00] to just
[1:39:02] move if we're in a cut and dried ritual
[1:39:05] brothers and sisters we're going to
[1:39:06] stifle
[1:39:07] them the spirit of the Lord is timid
[1:39:09] he's not going to bulldo his way in
[1:39:12] we've got to welcome him I don't know
[1:39:14] how many people were present just before
[1:39:16] Co took place we had a Wednesday night
[1:39:18] service those people that don't come on
[1:39:20] Wednesdays you missed out man we had a
[1:39:22] Wednesday night service where it was
[1:39:24] about 15 minutes of spontaneous worship
[1:39:27] when it came time for the minister to
[1:39:29] come to the pulpit I bet that if someone
[1:39:31] would have been here that wasn't serving
[1:39:33] God they would have wanted to serve God
[1:39:34] by that atmosphere that was here I could
[1:39:37] not even speak when I got up to the
[1:39:39] pulpit you know I don't want to look
[1:39:41] back and say well what song was that we
[1:39:43] need to go back and find the song and
[1:39:45] find the chords and find everything the
[1:39:47] way that it was no that's what we're
[1:39:49] talking about that kind of ritualistic
[1:39:51] perspective no we need to get ready the
[1:39:54] night before we need to get ready the
[1:39:55] week before we need to be thinking about
[1:39:57] how we're going to be a blessing in that
[1:40:00] service not what that service is going
[1:40:01] to be a blessing to me what are we
[1:40:04] bringing to the party brothers and
[1:40:06] sisters
[1:40:08] amen we talk about the spirit of Revival
[1:40:10] and I don't mean to sound like I'm angry
[1:40:12] I'm just trying to say my I want more of
[1:40:15] the Lord I know there's more to be had
[1:40:17] and you know I know I know I'll say it
[1:40:20] from the pulpit and on recording that I
[1:40:22] probably haven't done all that I could
[1:40:24] or should and I say Lord forgive me
[1:40:27] because I want to see the spirit of
[1:40:28] Revival happen in this
[1:40:32] church Revival comes from the word
[1:40:35] revive obviously but the definition of
[1:40:38] revive is to restore to Consciousness or
[1:40:42] life that's right to restore to
[1:40:46] Consciousness or life to restore from a
[1:40:51] depressed
[1:40:53] inactive or unused State bring
[1:40:58] back you know we were having a
[1:41:02] conversation and it was about hurts and
[1:41:06] how we can have hurts and we can have
[1:41:08] scars in our lives and and what happens
[1:41:11] is it can cause us to become inactive
[1:41:15] right right we come to church and we go
[1:41:18] home and we come to church and we go
[1:41:21] home and what happens is is we become
[1:41:25] spiritually depressed amen we get a low
[1:41:28] pressure system coming into our life
[1:41:31] storm clouds are there and we just can't
[1:41:34] seem to shake it we can't get out of the
[1:41:36] fog but I'm here to tell you and you
[1:41:38] know full well but I just want to
[1:41:40] encourage us the devil wants us to be
[1:41:42] depressed the devil wants us to be
[1:41:45] inactive right when you don't feel like
[1:41:48] worshiping that's the time to
[1:41:50] worship amen if you ever wonder should I
[1:41:53] raise my hands as high as I can maybe
[1:41:57] I've got a back problem I want to tell
[1:41:59] you that if you're willing to stretch it
[1:42:01] out and give God praise he will take and
[1:42:04] use that as an opportunity to show his
[1:42:07] healing power in your
[1:42:10] life amen but on the other hand if you
[1:42:13] want to take it and say I got a back
[1:42:15] problem and I can only raise my hands
[1:42:16] this High I can't go any higher than
[1:42:17] that you know what if you were born that
[1:42:20] way that's okay give God all you've got
[1:42:24] but then if you're going to go to a ball
[1:42:26] game and be like yeah and go a little
[1:42:29] higher for a ball game guess
[1:42:32] what he's not going to heal you so you
[1:42:35] can go to a ball game and worship
[1:42:36] because that's what you're doing when
[1:42:38] you go to a ball game you might say oh
[1:42:40] I'm just cheering my team but I'll tell
[1:42:42] you what you're spiritually
[1:42:44] worshiping whether you know it or not
[1:42:47] you know I'll never forget it I heard
[1:42:49] brother Aaron mcir talk one time about a
[1:42:52] brother who just could never seemed to
[1:42:53] get over the lust in his life never he
[1:42:57] struggled with this lust in his life and
[1:43:00] you know what came out in conversation
[1:43:01] what that brother was doing was he was
[1:43:03] listening to talk radio Sports Talk
[1:43:06] Radio Spirits travel in words brothers
[1:43:09] and sisters the devil is cunning he's
[1:43:11] not going to come as a as a roaring lion
[1:43:13] and a and a raging monster to our door
[1:43:16] he's going to be subtle he's going to
[1:43:18] look like a sports team he's going to
[1:43:21] look like a music team he's is going to
[1:43:23] look like all this different Social
[1:43:25] Media stuff it's going to just be soft
[1:43:28] and gentle and it's going to be subtle
[1:43:31] and it's going to be step by step by
[1:43:33] step and what's going to happen is we're
[1:43:35] going to become depressed and we're
[1:43:36] going to become
[1:43:38] unused we're vessels of worship we're
[1:43:41] created to worship
[1:43:43] God we prayed this morning that we would
[1:43:45] be just like back in the day of of job
[1:43:49] you know there was a time where the
[1:43:51] morning Stars sang together and that's
[1:43:53] all the Angels brother BR talks about he
[1:43:55] explains that all the angels in heaven
[1:43:57] the Heavenly hosts that were created to
[1:43:58] worship the morning Stars they sang
[1:44:00] together but you know what the sons of
[1:44:02] God they shouted for
[1:44:03] Joy the sons of God are you a Son of God
[1:44:07] today a son and daughter of God if
[1:44:10] you're a son and daughter of God then
[1:44:11] you've got every single reason to shout
[1:44:14] for Joy because you know what's happened
[1:44:15] you know what he's done for you in your
[1:44:17] life the word revive to restore to
[1:44:21] Consciousness to remember wow I I was
[1:44:24] alive Once Upon a Time My Eyes Are Open
[1:44:27] I've got breath in my lungs I'm I'm I'm
[1:44:29] back to Consciousness and life again and
[1:44:31] to restore from a depressed inactive or
[1:44:34] unused state to bring back I want to say
[1:44:37] brothers and sisters if we've got breath
[1:44:39] in our lungs if we've got consciousness
[1:44:41] of mind he is more than willing to
[1:44:44] restore to us our first estate if we
[1:44:48] have
[1:44:49] fallen he will restore us from a
[1:44:52] depressed State he'll take depression
[1:44:54] and kick it out you don't have to try
[1:44:57] and kick depression out of your life
[1:44:58] brothers and sisters all you got to do
[1:45:00] is get right with God and watch him come
[1:45:03] on the scene and depression will be gone
[1:45:06] amen you don't have to try and quit
[1:45:08] drinking alcohol the only thing you've
[1:45:11] got to do is get really honest with God
[1:45:14] and give him your entire being that's
[1:45:16] right and he will kick alcohol out the
[1:45:20] door you don't have to try and quit
[1:45:23] smoking that's right you don't have to
[1:45:25] try and quit
[1:45:27] weed you don't have to try and quit any
[1:45:29] addiction just get honest with
[1:45:34] God yes Lord and he'll restore you amen
[1:45:37] from a depressed inactive unused State
[1:45:41] Lord he'll bring you back that's the
[1:45:43] final part of number two in this
[1:45:46] definition of
[1:45:48] revive number
[1:45:50] three is to renew in the mind or
[1:45:54] memory to renew us back to our first
[1:45:58] love to take us back you know what
[1:46:00] that's what brother Bram said that's
[1:46:01] what God Said through brother brandham
[1:46:03] if you just want to get right with God
[1:46:05] and you don't know how sometimes we can
[1:46:06] go so far down a road and we just don't
[1:46:09] even know how to go and get back the
[1:46:10] only thing you got to do is go back to
[1:46:12] where you got
[1:46:13] off and if you don't know if you don't
[1:46:17] know just like we said before I I I
[1:46:20] think it's so good if we believe God to
[1:46:23] be God just ask
[1:46:26] him just ask
[1:46:28] him Lord where did I get off Lord where
[1:46:31] did I actually make the wrong turn where
[1:46:33] where did I I miss it what's what did I
[1:46:36] miss in my life what am I
[1:46:38] missing genuinely honestly with him and
[1:46:41] see if he won't actually reveal it I
[1:46:43] promise you I guarantee you he will
[1:46:46] reveal it if you're honest amen but you
[1:46:49] got to know what his voice sounds like
[1:46:51] am first you got to be able to quiet
[1:46:53] yourself enough to hear his voice
[1:46:56] amen but if you're willing to do it he's
[1:46:59] willing to do it he'll reveal it to you
[1:47:02] he'll show us and he will renew Us in
[1:47:04] the mind or in our memory he'll take us
[1:47:07] and and put us right back to our first
[1:47:08] estate remember what it was like when
[1:47:10] you first got
[1:47:12] saved come on now I say Lord help me I
[1:47:14] remember what it was like when I first
[1:47:16] got saved I wanted to go out and scream
[1:47:17] and shout all over the place and just
[1:47:20] tell anyone that would listen to me and
[1:47:22] they all thought I was a
[1:47:23] fanatic and I truly am I guess
[1:47:26] considering the way the world is
[1:47:28] today but how many wouldn't want to
[1:47:30] Revival like that in your life
[1:47:35] today it's totally available we can have
[1:47:38] that kind of a
[1:47:39] Revival making the valley full of
[1:47:41] ditches 1956 brother bradam
[1:47:44] said said if I didn't respect the
[1:47:47] presence of that righteous man the story
[1:47:49] that we talked about already josephat
[1:47:51] Ahab I wouldn't even look at you so he
[1:47:54] got himself all stirred up so you know
[1:47:58] when you get all stirred up and riled up
[1:48:00] like that it's not a good time to do any
[1:48:05] service for the
[1:48:06] Lord got to do something about
[1:48:09] it said you know what he said
[1:48:11] nevertheless go get me a Minstrel start
[1:48:14] praying
[1:48:15] playing I just want to pause there and
[1:48:17] say this brothers and sisters if we're
[1:48:19] being attacked by the enemy one of the
[1:48:21] best weapons of our Warfare
[1:48:23] is prayer it's the strongest weapon that
[1:48:25] we've got it's the strongest weapon in
[1:48:27] the universe but I want to encourage you
[1:48:30] if you can't pray in the
[1:48:32] moment just put a song on Amen put on a
[1:48:36] good worship song Amen put on a song
[1:48:39] that you know something that's soft
[1:48:42] something that's pleasing unto the Lord
[1:48:44] put on a song and just see if you won't
[1:48:47] actually change the
[1:48:49] atmosphere but I guarantee you if you do
[1:48:52] that if you if you take just a couple
[1:48:54] words breathed in prayer the word says
[1:48:57] that we should be praying continuously
[1:48:59] to pray without ceasing what does that
[1:49:01] mean it means to be having a constant
[1:49:03] relationship with the Lord we're not
[1:49:05] going to go to church and see him we
[1:49:07] bring him amen we don't come to church
[1:49:09] to meet with God even though we do what
[1:49:11] we do is we bring our licks of fire
[1:49:13] together to create the pillar of fire
[1:49:16] amen but he's with us everywhere we go
[1:49:19] if we have him in our lives if we're
[1:49:21] willing to surrender to him just breathe
[1:49:23] a couple words of prayer say Lord help
[1:49:26] me I've got this temptation and whenever
[1:49:29] that temptation is Brothers and Sisters
[1:49:31] You've been given Authority all of the
[1:49:33] authority of Heaven is behind your word
[1:49:35] if you're fully surrendered unto the
[1:49:36] Lord amen if You' got something that the
[1:49:39] devil's tempting you with then rebuke
[1:49:41] that spear in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:49:43] by The Authority that's been vested in
[1:49:46] you then put on a
[1:49:48] song and 5 minutes later you'll be
[1:49:51] scratching your head saying now what was
[1:49:53] that was I at mad was was was there a
[1:49:55] problem was there something going on
[1:49:57] Amen if you're honest if you're genuine
[1:50:00] that'll
[1:50:02] happen brother Ram says nevertheless go
[1:50:04] get me a minstral start praying playing
[1:50:06] now you believe that people you now you
[1:50:10] people that don't believe in music in
[1:50:12] the church what about that yeah said go
[1:50:16] get me a minstral I'm all riled up today
[1:50:18] my righteous indignation boiled over he
[1:50:22] must have been
[1:50:23] mad that guy come up here that
[1:50:25] borderline preacher stand out there and
[1:50:28] beating them children wrong down there
[1:50:30] and doing that oh how I could take a
[1:50:32] hold of him said I've got to see a
[1:50:35] vision now bring me a
[1:50:38] Minstrel and they went and they got all
[1:50:40] the
[1:50:41] music and they started to playing the
[1:50:44] music some real good hymn and the first
[1:50:47] thing you know when they songs returned
[1:50:51] to Zion when the music and the children
[1:50:55] began to sing from their
[1:50:58] heart yes amen it's not their
[1:51:00] tradition it's not their form it's not
[1:51:04] their Perfect Pitch right it's singing
[1:51:07] from their
[1:51:08] heart when that happened something
[1:51:11] happened when they got to singing from
[1:51:14] their heart something takes place the
[1:51:17] spirit of the Lord come on the prophet
[1:51:20] now that's good and nice to talk about
[1:51:22] the prophet isn't isn't it let's bring
[1:51:24] it home and if a real old-fashioned
[1:51:27] Godly singing and repenting would bring
[1:51:29] the spirit of God on the prophet then
[1:51:31] it'll do the same thing today am and
[1:51:35] notice he wanted to see the way out and
[1:51:38] the only way out they could do would be
[1:51:42] to have a
[1:51:44] Revival brothers and sisters I know that
[1:51:48] I spoke maybe a little bit selfishly
[1:51:50] saying I want a Revival but I can tell
[1:51:53] you by what we're reading by the words
[1:51:55] of the Prophet according to the word of
[1:51:57] God if we have problems and issues in
[1:52:00] our church we can push them back by
[1:52:03] having a
[1:52:04] Revival this isn't about putting
[1:52:06] anything on this is about giving the
[1:52:08] spirit of the Lord room to
[1:52:11] move not limiting him and saying I can't
[1:52:14] stand the way this happens and because
[1:52:16] they they play music that way I can't
[1:52:19] worship oh my that's not going to be a
[1:52:21] good enough excuse
[1:52:23] God's not going to accept
[1:52:28] that if a real oldfashioned Godly
[1:52:30] singing and repenting would bring the
[1:52:32] spirit of God on the prophet then it'll
[1:52:33] do the same today and notice he wanted
[1:52:35] to see the way out and the only way out
[1:52:39] they could do was to have a Revival so
[1:52:42] he had some repented Sinners that come
[1:52:45] in and the music played and the prophet
[1:52:47] saw a vision and the only way you're
[1:52:49] ever going to see your way out
[1:52:53] is an old-fashioned spiritual
[1:52:55] Revival if you've got a problem brothers
[1:52:57] and sisters if you've got an issue if
[1:53:00] you've got a situation I just want to
[1:53:02] say today by the power vested in me for
[1:53:05] this office there is a way out am there
[1:53:09] is a way out just have a Revival with
[1:53:12] the Lord in your own
[1:53:14] life the only way you're ever going to
[1:53:17] see your way out is an old-fashioned
[1:53:19] spiritual Revival where the Hallelujah
[1:53:22] of God God is ringing from the bottom of
[1:53:24] your heart an oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[1:53:28] sent Revival hits the place then you
[1:53:30] begin to see things then God will begin
[1:53:33] to reveal things then you'll wonder why
[1:53:35] these real Christians are hanging on why
[1:53:38] they're praying for you what a Revival
[1:53:41] and he got in the spirit now the reason
[1:53:43] that these people have dances if they
[1:53:45] didn't have a dance so they could get in
[1:53:48] the spirit of dancing you can't have a
[1:53:50] ball game unless you you're in the
[1:53:53] spirit of the ball game you've got to
[1:53:55] get in the spirit of it and we can never
[1:53:58] have a Revival in Shri board or in
[1:54:01] Calgary or anywhere else until the
[1:54:04] church gets in the spirit of
[1:54:08] Revival God can come and perform
[1:54:11] Miracles he can show wonders he can
[1:54:13] stretch forth his hand to heal the sick
[1:54:16] and The Afflicted the preacher can
[1:54:18] preach and the gospel as hard as he can
[1:54:20] but there'll never be a Revival until
[1:54:22] the Church gets in the spirit of
[1:54:27] Revival I know we've had some fantastic
[1:54:30] services and I know the Lord has spoke
[1:54:32] to us it many times but I believe
[1:54:34] there's more amen brothers and sisters
[1:54:37] there's
[1:54:38] more I've gone through and made a list
[1:54:41] myself of
[1:54:43] Believers in the Calgary area and I know
[1:54:46] there's probably maybe different places
[1:54:48] where people Fellowship but I know that
[1:54:51] there's people that are believers of
[1:54:53] this message that aren't in
[1:54:55] fellowship and you know what the spirit
[1:54:58] of Revival has the ability to draw
[1:55:01] people we're not looking for numbers
[1:55:04] that's right we're looking for a place
[1:55:05] where people can come and actually have
[1:55:08] that true relationship with Christ that
[1:55:10] true relationship that the spirit spoke
[1:55:13] through the prophet expressly at the
[1:55:15] very end of the church age book of the
[1:55:17] exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:55:19] where his desire was one thing that man
[1:55:21] could have that spiritual relationship
[1:55:24] with
[1:55:25] God that's what this is for that's what
[1:55:28] this church is about that's what the
[1:55:30] message of the hour is about amen he
[1:55:33] came to take a bride of his own choosing
[1:55:36] right and she knows what he likes the
[1:55:39] wife knows what her husband likes that's
[1:55:41] right she knows exactly what he likes
[1:55:44] that's right out of getting in the
[1:55:45] spirit 1961 that's the way you get a
[1:55:49] Revival it's when you really get in the
[1:55:52] spirit of
[1:55:54] Revival I just love the way the prophet
[1:55:56] says this here not whooping it up or
[1:55:59] something but by praying it
[1:56:02] down until there's a Revival strikes
[1:56:04] your heart until all the logs of
[1:56:09] ecclesiasticism and all the logs of
[1:56:12] fanaticism and all the logs of systems
[1:56:15] and I want to say logs of
[1:56:17] traditions all the logs of unbelief
[1:56:21] flows out and then the Waters of God
[1:56:23] comes falling down upon you there you
[1:56:26] are brothers and sisters it's for every
[1:56:28] single one of us we know that it's for
[1:56:30] whosoever
[1:56:32] will we don't have to live our lives in
[1:56:35] a state of being depressed in in a state
[1:56:38] of of of being unused in a state of just
[1:56:41] being dormant in in a state of saying
[1:56:44] that I I got this wound from maybe the
[1:56:47] way my parents treated me or maybe the
[1:56:49] way my parents didn't treat me maybe the
[1:56:51] way the pastor treated me I had all of
[1:56:54] my faith in this one pastor this one
[1:56:57] time I I was taught that everything that
[1:56:59] was good was in that man the reason that
[1:57:02] man was allowed to fall was so that you
[1:57:05] would stop looking at the
[1:57:08] man but not that you would stop looking
[1:57:10] at the man and stop looking at any man
[1:57:13] and just stay home and start playing
[1:57:15] tapes it's so that you would get your
[1:57:18] eyes off of man and get your eyes on
[1:57:20] Christ
[1:57:26] that's why he allows Ministry to
[1:57:29] fall don't look at man look at
[1:57:33] Christ get the Holy Ghost yes that's
[1:57:37] where it is and you'll get a holy man's
[1:57:38] taste amen but you know when we have a
[1:57:41] thinking man's filter that's got some
[1:57:43] sort of denominational or traditional
[1:57:46] screening in it what's going to happen
[1:57:49] is things of the world are going to get
[1:57:50] through we're not going to have the true
[1:57:52] damic power of Christ it's going to be
[1:57:53] dirty power right that's right remember
[1:57:56] the devil can impersonate any gift of
[1:57:58] God except for one thing the ability to
[1:58:02] receive this
[1:58:03] word that's it I just couldn't help but
[1:58:07] think about some scriptures that kind of
[1:58:09] talk about Revival we got a couple
[1:58:11] minutes left here are we okay in 2
[1:58:14] chonicles 7 verse4 says if my people
[1:58:18] which are called by my name shall humble
[1:58:20] themselves
[1:58:22] you know the word says to humble
[1:58:24] yourself in the sight of the Lord he'll
[1:58:25] lift you up I know we talk about this
[1:58:27] many times at home but for the people
[1:58:28] maybe who are visiting or maybe somebody
[1:58:30] else or maybe just a little bit of
[1:58:31] encouragement you know when we humble
[1:58:33] ourselves it's not coming to the altar
[1:58:35] at the front of the church and humbling
[1:58:37] ourselves and going down on our knees
[1:58:39] and and humbling ourselves to the
[1:58:40] preacher or or to the guest Ministry or
[1:58:43] to the deacons it's not about that at
[1:58:45] all humble yourself one another humble
[1:58:48] yourself to your brother or to your
[1:58:50] sister humble yourself to your wives say
[1:58:54] I'm I'm a servant to my wife I'm a
[1:58:56] servant to my family all the resources
[1:59:00] that I've got belong to my wife all the
[1:59:04] resources that I've got belong to my
[1:59:07] family step away from the control for a
[1:59:10] little while and see if God won't come
[1:59:13] on the scene because he sees you
[1:59:14] humbling yourself saying that I'm a good
[1:59:17] church member ain't humbling yourself
[1:59:19] sorry tenure in the church church I
[1:59:22] spent the whole entirety of my life in a
[1:59:25] message church so I'm a good person that
[1:59:29] don't do it what's on the inside what's
[1:59:32] in the heart amen are we willing to
[1:59:34] Humble ourselves in the sight of the
[1:59:39] Lord if we are he'll Lift us up that's
[1:59:43] his word but if my people which are
[1:59:45] called by my name shall humble
[1:59:47] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[1:59:51] turn turn from their Wicked Ways there's
[1:59:54] a few steps in there then I will hear
[1:59:57] from
[1:59:58] heaven and will forgive their sin and
[2:00:02] will heal their land amen you know
[2:00:04] brother bradam and one of the one of the
[2:00:06] things I was studying it can be so
[2:00:09] extensive you just wind up looking at so
[2:00:10] many quotes you can be confused and many
[2:00:12] times I probably look that way and I God
[2:00:16] bless you I I can't help it but you know
[2:00:19] brother Bram talks about the desert the
[2:00:22] desert things are dry and where things
[2:00:25] are dry they shrivel up and when they
[2:00:27] shrivel up they become
[2:00:30] prickly prickly prickly and you know
[2:00:33] what can happen is we can have things
[2:00:35] shrivel up spiritually in our lives and
[2:00:37] we can become prickly and you know what
[2:00:40] alls we need to do is follow the steps
[2:00:42] in 2 Chronicles 7:14 if you're his
[2:00:46] people and you're called by his name
[2:00:47] just humble yourself and pray and seek
[2:00:50] his face and turn from your wicked way
[2:00:52] sometimes Wicked brothers and sisters
[2:00:54] doesn't mean going out and and sitting
[2:00:56] at a bong and going to a bar sometimes
[2:00:59] Wicked isn't playing nasty rock and roll
[2:01:02] music sometimes Wicked is actually
[2:01:05] putting on a suit and tie and coming to
[2:01:07] church and claiming to believe the
[2:01:08] message of the hour but not believing
[2:01:10] all of it amen I'm just going to leave
[2:01:13] one or two words out I'm I'm just going
[2:01:14] to do it my way just like Frank Sinatra
[2:01:17] look at him now don't try and do the
[2:01:19] message your way do it the way that God
[2:01:20] showed us do it the way the Vindicated
[2:01:23] Prophet
[2:01:24] brought then you'll hear from heaven and
[2:01:27] forgive your sin and heal your land just
[2:01:29] I couldn't help but think about a desert
[2:01:31] a dry place all those plants are there
[2:01:33] and they're all struggling and hanging
[2:01:34] on for dear life but when the waters
[2:01:37] come what happens those plants have the
[2:01:40] opportunity to start to absorb that
[2:01:42] moisture brother badam says in one of
[2:01:44] the messages that those stickers tend to
[2:01:46] disappear the plants soften up
[2:01:49] everything that was once dry and prickly
[2:01:51] becomes soft and gentle and kind amen he
[2:01:56] will heal your land brothers and sisters
[2:01:58] we don't have to be afraid out of
[2:02:00] getting in the spirit 1961 brother bam
[2:02:02] says now now I can't tell you about your
[2:02:05] salvation you have to work that out
[2:02:07] yourself but Christ still lives and
[2:02:09] Reigns he's here tonight do you believe
[2:02:11] that what what do you have do get in the
[2:02:15] spirit and when you get in the spirit
[2:02:17] then you see the vision but as long as
[2:02:19] you say well bless God I'm a Methodist
[2:02:24] I'm going to say this bless God I'm a
[2:02:29] Baptist I don't have to put up with such
[2:02:32] I'm a Baptist I'm assemblies I'm Oneness
[2:02:35] I'm
[2:02:37] message all right go ahead you'll never
[2:02:40] see the vision but you throw that thing
[2:02:43] aside and get into the vision see Jesus
[2:02:47] coming and the church perishing there
[2:02:50] and get into the vision dig right down
[2:02:51] down brother I'm telling you something
[2:02:53] will happen to you then you will get in
[2:02:56] the spirit of
[2:02:57] Revival do you believe
[2:03:00] it I got one more quote I'll call the
[2:03:02] musicians as we close
[2:03:05] today maybe stand with me as we close
[2:03:08] 1963 how can I
[2:03:13] overcome he says now let's turn to
[2:03:15] Revelations the third
[2:03:17] chapter at the excuse me at the church
[2:03:19] ages repeating Church
[2:03:22] age but
[2:03:24] now we are well there yeah I could take
[2:03:28] this one text and with the Holy Spirit
[2:03:30] preach on it a hundred years and never
[2:03:33] get what's in it out can you imagine
[2:03:36] that
[2:03:38] yeah because in this one text like all
[2:03:41] the other texts in the Bible it's all
[2:03:43] tied together and I want to take my
[2:03:45] subject this morning of this how can I
[2:03:48] overcome how many people here ask that
[2:03:51] question question about things in their
[2:03:52] lives how can I overcome I'll tell you I
[2:03:54] do things in my life that I think Lord
[2:03:57] how can I
[2:04:02] overcome he says now I chose this
[2:04:04] because I think that it's a time we
[2:04:07] should never let the spirit of Revival
[2:04:10] die we've got to keep in Revival
[2:04:13] constantly revived every
[2:04:17] day Paul said he died he had to Die
[2:04:20] daily that Christ could live and as long
[2:04:24] as we're keeping this guy alive as long
[2:04:26] as we're saying no I only go that far
[2:04:29] I'm not going to go all that way no I
[2:04:32] I've been in the message all these years
[2:04:33] I don't I don't know I don't know if I
[2:04:35] can buy it I don't know if I can really
[2:04:37] accept it all as long as we're doing
[2:04:38] that God's going to say yeah okay that's
[2:04:40] fine but as soon as we're willing to say
[2:04:42] I surrender all unto
[2:04:46] you as long as we're willing to kill out
[2:04:49] that old man why not so that we can be a
[2:04:51] good person and and and wear our clothes
[2:04:54] just right and say Amen just right so
[2:04:57] that we can let his Spirit live amen
[2:05:00] he's not going to
[2:05:02] cohabitate he's not our
[2:05:04] co-pilot the denominational world has
[2:05:07] those bumper stickers God is my co-pilot
[2:05:10] no he is our
[2:05:12] pilot now Revelation the third chapter
[2:05:15] and beginning with the 21st verse we
[2:05:17] read this to him that overcometh will I
[2:05:19] grant to sit with me in my throne
[2:05:23] even as I overcome and I'm sat down with
[2:05:24] my father in his throne think about how
[2:05:26] he overcame brothers and sisters
[2:05:29] husbands when we want to be dictators
[2:05:33] think about how he overcame what did he
[2:05:35] do for his bride he laid down his life
[2:05:37] amen would we lay down our lives for our
[2:05:42] wives that might be asking a lot would
[2:05:44] we take everything that we've got and
[2:05:47] give it to
[2:05:48] her would we take everything that we've
[2:05:51] got and throw away for her he
[2:05:55] did he
[2:05:57] did he that hath an he let him hear what
[2:05:59] the spirit saith unto the churches did
[2:06:01] you notice the arrangements of that see
[2:06:04] sat with me in my Throne not on my
[2:06:06] throne in my Throne we're seated in
[2:06:10] Heavenly places where in Christ
[2:06:14] Jesus we get to sit with him in his
[2:06:16] throne that means full Dominion brothers
[2:06:19] and sisters in my Throne that's his
[2:06:21] domain see and there as Christ is the
[2:06:24] ruler Throne ruler at this time of the
[2:06:27] complete domain of God so will the
[2:06:30] church be with him the bride will be
[2:06:34] with him in his throne in the entire
[2:06:36] domain see not on my throne but in my
[2:06:39] Throne see where his domain
[2:06:42] reaches a throne is over a domain and a
[2:06:45] domain reaches just as far as its
[2:06:46] boundaries does and this is from
[2:06:49] eternity to Eternity just think it it's
[2:06:52] not from this country to that country
[2:06:53] from from this coordinate to that
[2:06:55] coordinate this is eternity to Eternity
[2:06:58] that's the domain we're talking about
[2:07:00] brothers and sisters there's not one
[2:07:01] devil that can stand against you if
[2:07:03] you're fully surrendered to god let's
