[38:42] coming
[38:46] [Music]
[38:51] bless you tonight welcome to the house
[38:53] of the Lord
[38:55] just have a few prayer requests as many
[38:57] know
[39:00] has graduated this week on Monday the
[39:04] Lord saw fit to take her home
[39:06] [Music]
[39:08] we're certainly thankful for that
[39:10] and you know every time I I think about
[39:14] a graduation
[39:16] about someone passing away it's sad on
[39:19] this side
[39:21] but when you see me cry I Don't Cry
[39:23] tears of Sorrow
[39:25] because I know that we'll meet again
[39:30] I Cry tears because I know there's a
[39:32] land
[39:33] [Music]
[39:37] and I long to be there yes
[39:40] it's like everyone we have loved ones
[39:43] there
[39:44] no that's a promise we have a few more
[39:48] days to labor here
[39:50] and every day that we have here every
[39:53] time we see someone
[39:54] graduate we see some pass on
[39:59] and just creates a desire in the heart
[40:01] of every believer I believe
[40:04] to keep pressing on
[40:08] you just want to remember Sister Tina's
[40:10] family
[40:11] [Music]
[40:12] they would come to know the Lord Jesus
[40:14] Christ
[40:15] and the power of his resurrection the
[40:18] way our dear sister did
[40:21] and we know that would be her desire as
[40:23] well
[40:23] she wouldn't want to see us Sorrowing
[40:27] she wouldn't want to see us wallowing
[40:29] she would want to see us rejoicing she
[40:32] would want to see us pressing on she
[40:34] would want to hear our worship she would
[40:36] want to know that we all have the Holy
[40:38] Ghost and that we know that when our
[40:40] time comes for the Lord to call us home
[40:42] that we would be ready that's what she
[40:45] would want to know and maybe I'm crazy
[40:47] for talking this way but I believe she
[40:49] was a Believer and I believe that
[40:51] Believers have the same desire and that
[40:53] is to have the Seal of the Holy Ghost in
[40:55] their lives because that's all we have
[40:57] brothers and sisters there's nothing
[40:58] else in this world that will endure
[41:00] there's nothing else that we can take
[41:03] with us except for his character we
[41:05] don't want to take our character our
[41:07] character will not take us where we want
[41:09] to go
[41:09] [Music]
[41:11] my let's remember sister Tina and her
[41:14] family sister Tina's family we don't
[41:17] need to remember her in prayer we need
[41:19] to Rejoice for her because she's not
[41:22] mourning right now

[42:47] lives father every day saying Amen to

[42:53] thank you for your goodness to us Lord
[42:55] each one of us has a testimony how
[42:57] you've moved in our lives Lord Jesus and
[42:59] that's why we are here tonight that's
[43:01] why we're standing together father
[43:03] because you called us here Lord and

[43:43] from the heart of a True Believer and
[43:45] Lord we pray that those testimonies

[44:15] sister did Father
[44:16] Lord
[44:17] we love you and we thank you we just ask
[44:20] all those things in the name of Jesus

[44:27] brother Paul and sister Elaine father
[44:29] they've asked her if if she would mind
[44:31] if they brought her name before the
[44:33] church and Lord before the church could

[44:49] Christ and father once again Lord maybe
[44:52] not that she would be changed in her
[44:54] body but Lord we're not looking for
[44:56] signs and wonders what we're looking for
[44:58] is the ability to believe your word Lord
[45:00] Jesus and father perhaps she could
[45:02] through this testimony come to know you

[45:06] life Lord Jesus that's the the goal in
[45:09] this age Lord Jesus is to see Soul saved

[46:39] things now in Jesus Christ's name we
[46:41] pray amen amen
[46:45] Hallelujah
[46:47] God bless you everyone thank you
[46:49] musicians
[46:58] if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like
[47:00] to turn to Ephesians chapter 5.
[47:06] seem like I'm going backwards a little
[47:08] bit but
[47:11] I don't think there's one part of
[47:12] scripture that is old
[47:17] you know that all scripture is given
[47:20] for inspiration
[47:24] let's start with verse 21.
[47:28] I believe it's the
[47:30] fundamental part of this discussion that
[47:33] we'll get into tonight verse 21 it says
[47:36] submitting yourselves out of Ephesians
[47:38] chapter five sorry Ephesians chapter 5
[47:40] verse 21 submitting yourselves one to
[47:44] another in the fear of God if we can't
[47:46] do that then the rest of it is
[47:48] irrelevant
[47:50] verse 22 says why submit yourselves unto
[47:53] your own husbands as unto the Lord
[47:56] where the husband is the head of the
[47:58] wife even as Christ is the head of the
[48:00] church
[48:01] and he is the savior of the body
[48:04] therefore as the church is subject unto
[48:07] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[48:10] husbands in every thing
[48:13] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[48:16] also love the church and gave himself
[48:19] for it
[48:21] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[48:24] with the washing
[48:26] of Water by the word
[48:28] that he might represent might present it
[48:31] to himself a glorious church not having
[48:34] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[48:37] that it should be holy and without
[48:40] blemish
[48:42] so what men to love their wives as their
[48:44] own bodies
[48:45] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[48:49] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[48:51] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[48:55] the Lord the church
[48:58] for we are members of his body of his
[49:01] flesh
[49:02] and of his bones
[49:04] for this cause shall a man leave his
[49:06] father and mother and shall be joined
[49:08] unto his wife and they too shall be one
[49:11] flesh
[49:13] this is a great mystery but I speak
[49:15] concerning Christ and the church
[49:18] nevertheless let every one of you in
[49:21] particular so love his wife even as
[49:24] himself
[49:25] and the wife
[49:27] see that she reverence her husband
[49:30] chapter six children obey your parents
[49:33] in the Lord for this is right honor thy
[49:36] father and mother which is the first
[49:38] commandment with promise
[49:40] that it may be well with thee and thou
[49:43] mayest live long on the Earth
[49:46] this bow in prayer one more time
[49:50] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[49:52] word amen thank you Lord Jesus that we
[49:56] can read the word that we can turn back
[49:57] the pages and read the black and white
[49:59] and red print on the page father but
[50:02] Lord more than that we thank you that we
[50:04] can take and allow your Holy Spirit
[50:07] father to Quicken this word to our very
[50:09] Souls Lord Jesus because many people
[50:12] read this word and they read it and they
[50:14] close it and they say that was a good
[50:16] word but father by your Holy Spirit we
[50:18] know that you Quicken this word to us
[50:20] and father it's more than life to us
[50:22] Lord it changes us every single time we
[50:25] read it father every single time we
[50:27] speak it Lord every single time we think
[50:30] it Lord Jesus it does something to us
[50:32] and father we just ask that we could
[50:35] commit this word spoken tonight into
[50:37] your hands father that you would receive
[50:39] all the praise and all the glory as we
[50:42] go forwards we just Commit This service
[50:44] now into your hands Lord Jesus
[50:47] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[50:49] bless you tonight you may be seated
[50:54] just like to welcome all of our visitors
[50:55] with us trust you feel right at home
[50:59] certainly wonderful to have visitors
[51:00] people that want to fellowship with the
[51:03] Believers
[51:04] different cities and towns
[51:08] pleasure to have you with us
[51:10] be happy tonight
[51:13] certainly thankful for the testimony of
[51:15] sister Tina and
[51:17] we were able to go and see her on Monday
[51:20] I think just about an hour or so before
[51:22] she went home and
[51:25] it was wonderful to see her she
[51:27] recognized me and
[51:28] we were able to have a word of prayer
[51:30] and
[51:31] it's just amazing to see when somebody
[51:33] actually gets called home
[51:35] I wasn't there with her when she did go
[51:37] but I do believe Sister Janet was there
[51:41] Mr Janet was able to see a daughter of
[51:44] God slip from one dimension into another
[51:46] to take the last breath here on this
[51:49] side but see that she would just be
[51:52] taking that very first gulp of the
[51:54] cleanest purest air that there ever has
[51:56] been created to slip over into that
[51:59] other dimension what a tremendous time
[52:02] certainly thankful for our dear sisters
[52:04] testimony I believe there will be a
[52:07] funeral and we'll have announcement when
[52:09] we get details I I don't know any more
[52:12] than that at this moment so as soon as I
[52:14] find out we'll definitely pass it along
[52:16] to everyone
[52:18] uh this weekend we'll be traveling to
[52:20] Edmonton brother Gilbert has agreed to
[52:22] take the service on the Sunday it's
[52:25] brother Gilbert here tonight
[52:26] he's not here tonight yeah he uh
[52:29] definitely is inspired for Sunday though
[52:31] so just pray for him and pray for the
[52:33] services in Edmonton and I'm sure it'll
[52:35] be a wonderful time we'll be back again
[52:37] for Wednesday next week
[52:39] tonight
[52:40] um I believe this will become a bit of a
[52:42] tradition but I just think it's real
[52:44] important for us as Believers many times
[52:46] we can get so caught up in our lives and
[52:49] and the things that we have going on our
[52:51] dreams and our families and our careers
[52:54] and our education and all these things
[52:56] and we all have these things to do we
[52:58] have to do these things we've got to
[53:00] hold our potatoes we have to make sure
[53:02] that we're making Provisions but we need
[53:04] to remember why we're doing it and the
[53:07] reason why we're doing it is because
[53:08] we're Sons and Daughters of God and we
[53:10] will he will bless us but the way he
[53:12] blesses us is for us to seek Him First
[53:15] to remember that there's something
[53:17] greater than all of this stuff that we
[53:20] see here on Earth so tonight I just want
[53:22] to take a moment and I want to read from
[53:24] paragraph 38 of beyond the curtain of
[53:28] time
[53:29] is because we know that there's a place
[53:32] this is not a fictitious thing it's not
[53:35] just a pipe dream you know people might
[53:37] say well that's just your opinion and
[53:39] you know it is but we heard something
[53:42] interesting about when our sister Tina
[53:45] passed away and I think it's important
[53:47] to actually have these discussions the
[53:49] nurses there said that this was such a
[53:53] peaceful passing it was the most
[53:54] peaceful passing they have ever
[53:56] witnessed and these are people that see
[53:59] this all the time and why is that is
[54:01] because she knew where she was going she
[54:05] knew her position she had no fear she
[54:08] knew that it was going to get a whole
[54:10] lot better and you know brothers and
[54:11] sisters just my opinion my view but I
[54:13] believe that's why she didn't want the
[54:15] surgery
[54:15] do you want to fight this battle anymore
[54:17] she didn't want to walk around with a
[54:19] backpack for the rest of her life
[54:21] she said either God's Gonna heal me or
[54:23] he's going to take me home
[54:24] and there's nothing wrong with that but
[54:26] there's also nothing wrong with someone
[54:28] taking the doctor's prescription either
[54:29] and and what they have for them to do
[54:31] and I wouldn't say one way or the other
[54:33] it's got to be our own revelation
[54:35] but as a Believer what a testimony their
[54:38] final testimony from the nurse other
[54:41] people get really upset and they get
[54:43] really scared when they're going to pass
[54:45] away and their bodies start to freak out
[54:47] and they don't even know why and the
[54:50] nurses even said that I've heard it
[54:52] before from nurses as well
[54:54] people they get really anxious and upset
[54:57] even when they're not even conscious and
[55:00] why is that it's because they don't know
[55:01] where they're going to go
[55:02] they're afraid
[55:04] and you know we have every reason to be
[55:06] afraid as human beings if we don't have
[55:08] the token of the holy spirit in our
[55:09] lives
[55:11] but anyways tonight I just want to read
[55:12] this here quick before we get into the
[55:14] service it says then a voice spoke to me
[55:18] is that what I want to be no it's not
[55:21] um
[55:23] I'll just read it here
[55:25] the other morning I was lying on my bed
[55:27] I had just woke from sleep and I placed
[55:30] my hands behind my head and relaxed with
[55:32] my head on the pillow then I began to
[55:34] wonder what it would be like on the
[55:35] other side you ever wonder that
[55:37] what will it be like on the other side
[55:39] and I wonder right now tonight what teen
[55:41] sister Tina's thinking what what's she
[55:43] saying what she's doing how many hands
[55:46] has she shaked how many people has she
[55:47] hugged I realized that I have lived more
[55:50] than half my life if I live to be as old
[55:52] as my people and I wanted to do more for
[55:55] the Lord before I left this life
[55:58] I Heard a Voice saying you're just
[56:00] starting
[56:00] press the battle keep pressing as I lay
[56:03] there pondering the words I thought that
[56:05] I just imagined that I had heard a voice
[56:07] again the voice said press the battle
[56:09] keep going keep going still unbelieving
[56:13] I thought that possibly I had spoken the
[56:15] words myself I placed my lips between my
[56:17] teeth and held my hand over my mouth and
[56:19] listen The Voice spoke again just keep
[56:22] pressing if you only knew what was the
[56:25] at the end of the road
[56:27] I seem to hear the music and words of an
[56:29] old familiar song I'm homesick in blue I
[56:32] want to see Jesus
[56:33] I would like to hear those Harbor bells
[56:35] chime it would brighten my path and
[56:37] banish all fears Lord let me look past
[56:41] the curtain of time
[56:43] then the voice asked would you like to
[56:45] see beyond the curtain
[56:47] I answered it would help me so much
[56:50] what happened I cannot say whether I was
[56:52] in the body or else whether I was
[56:54] whether it was a translation I do not
[56:57] know and remember we identified this in
[57:00] scripture this is something that's not
[57:02] outside of the word just for those who
[57:04] maybe are wondering Paul had this happen
[57:06] he had it happen to him it was a
[57:09] translation I do not know but it was
[57:11] unlike any Vision I'd ever had I could
[57:13] see the place to which I was taken and I
[57:15] could see myself lying back there upon
[57:17] my bed
[57:18] I said this is a strange thing
[57:22] there were great numbers of people and
[57:23] they came running to greet me crying oh
[57:26] our precious brother first came young
[57:28] women apparently in the early 20s and as
[57:31] they would embrace me they said our
[57:33] precious brother young men in the
[57:35] Brilliance of Young Manhood with eyes
[57:37] glistening like stars on a darkened
[57:39] night with teeth white as pearls
[57:41] embraced me saying our precious brother
[57:43] then I noticed that I too had become
[57:45] young again I looked at myself and and
[57:49] turned and looked back at my old body
[57:51] lying on the bed with my hands behind my
[57:53] head I said I don't understand this
[57:56] as I begin to try to comprehend the
[57:58] place where I was I began to realize
[58:00] that there was no yesterday and no
[58:02] tomorrow there no one seemed to get
[58:04] tired as a multitude of the most
[58:07] beautiful young woman I had ever seen
[58:09] through their arms around me I
[58:10] discovered there was only a great love
[58:13] that overwhelmed me and no physical
[58:15] attraction as in human behavior I
[58:18] noticed these young women all wore their
[58:20] hair down to their waistline and their
[58:22] skirts went down to their feet
[58:25] after this my first wife
[58:28] after this hope my first wife hugged me
[58:30] and said my precious brother then
[58:32] another young woman hugged me
[58:34] hugged me and hope turned and hugged The
[58:36] Other Woman I said I don't understand
[58:38] this this is something entirely
[58:40] different from our human love I don't
[58:42] want to go back to that old body on that
[58:44] bed
[58:45] now I'll pick up from where I had in my
[58:47] notes
[58:49] same word though then a voice spoke to
[58:51] me
[58:52] this is what you preached that the Holy
[58:55] Ghost is
[58:56] this is perfect love
[58:58] nothing can enter here amen without it
[59:02] and I want to say tonight brothers and
[59:04] sisters if we got perfect love
[59:07] have we got that in our lives
[59:09] next I was taken up and seated on a high
[59:11] place all around me were great numbers
[59:14] of men and women in the bloom of Youth
[59:16] they were crying with joy oh our
[59:18] precious brother we are so happy to see
[59:20] you here I thought I'm not dreaming for
[59:23] I can see these people and I can see my
[59:25] body laying back there on the bed then
[59:28] the voice spoke to me you know what's
[59:29] written in the Bible that the prophets
[59:31] were gathered with their people I said
[59:33] yes I remember that in the scriptures
[59:35] but there are not this many branhams The
[59:38] Voice replied these are not branhams
[59:40] these are your converts the ones you
[59:43] have led to the Lord amen I'll just
[59:46] throw this in there I believe sister
[59:47] Tina's in that group I believe that we
[59:50] all were there in that group this was an
[59:53] eternal Place brothers and sisters this
[59:55] isn't something that's just going to
[59:56] happen collectively throughout time and
[59:58] maybe sometime if we're lucky we'll find
[1:00:00] ourselves there we were there
[1:00:03] amen
[1:00:05] said no wonder they are crying out my
[1:00:07] precious brother then the multitude
[1:00:09] cried together if you hadn't gone forth
[1:00:11] with the gospel we wouldn't be here
[1:00:13] I
[1:00:15] I asked oh where's Jesus I want to see
[1:00:17] him the people replied he's just a
[1:00:19] little higher someday he will come for
[1:00:21] you you were sent as a leader and when
[1:00:23] God comes he will judge you according to
[1:00:25] your teaching I asked does Paul and
[1:00:27] Peter have to stand this judgment also
[1:00:29] answer was yes I said I have preached
[1:00:32] what they preached I did not divert from
[1:00:34] it one side to the other
[1:00:37] were they baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:00:39] I did too where they taught the baptism
[1:00:41] in the Holy Spirit I did too whatever
[1:00:44] they taught I taught also
[1:00:46] we know that the people cried and we
[1:00:49] know that we're going back
[1:00:51] to Earth with you sometime Jesus will
[1:00:53] come and judge you according to the word
[1:00:55] you preached us
[1:00:57] then you will present us to him and all
[1:00:59] together we'll go back to the Earth and
[1:01:01] live forever I asked you I have to go
[1:01:03] back to Earth now
[1:01:05] they answered yes but keep pressing on
[1:01:11] as I began to move from that beautiful
[1:01:13] joyful place as far as my eyes could see
[1:01:17] people were coming towards me to embrace
[1:01:20] me crying my precious brother
[1:01:22] suddenly I was back on my bed again I
[1:01:25] said oh God help me never let me
[1:01:27] compromise with the word let me stay
[1:01:29] straight on the word
[1:01:31] I don't care what anyone else does
[1:01:34] and I believe brothers and sisters if I
[1:01:36] could say something tonight I want to
[1:01:37] underline that I want to bold that I
[1:01:40] want to italicize that I want to shout
[1:01:42] that doesn't matter what anybody else
[1:01:44] does stay straight on the word
[1:01:49] I don't care what anyone else does Lord
[1:01:51] let me press on to that beautiful joyful
[1:01:54] place
[1:01:56] I want to say this too because if we do
[1:01:58] deviate from the word we're not pressing
[1:02:01] on towards that place brothers and
[1:02:03] sisters a little tiny bit off right here
[1:02:05] could actually be a long ways off over
[1:02:08] there
[1:02:10] I'm more convinced than ever in my life
[1:02:12] that it will take perfect love to enter
[1:02:14] that place amen
[1:02:16] amen perfect love to enter that place
[1:02:18] there was no jealousy no tiredness no
[1:02:21] sickness no old age no death only
[1:02:24] Supreme Beauty and joy
[1:02:26] whatever you do lay aside everything
[1:02:28] else until you get perfect love get to
[1:02:31] where you can love everybody
[1:02:33] even your enemy
[1:02:35] no matter if the plane is rocking the
[1:02:37] lightning is flashing or The Guns of the
[1:02:39] enemy are on you these things do not
[1:02:41] matter get perfect love if you're not
[1:02:43] saved except Jesus Christ as your savior
[1:02:45] now yes if you have not been baptized in
[1:02:48] water be baptized now
[1:02:51] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:02:54] for the remission of your sins
[1:02:56] be baptized now if you have not received
[1:02:58] the baptism in the Holy Spirit receive
[1:03:01] it now
[1:03:03] press on to that perfect love
[1:03:06] which will take you to that beautiful
[1:03:08] and joyful place beyond the curtain of
[1:03:11] time
[1:03:14] let's keep pressing on brothers and
[1:03:15] sisters
[1:03:16] we have the ability to do that and I
[1:03:18] believe that's why we're here tonight
[1:03:19] because we want to keep pressing on
[1:03:21] we might not see it all we might not
[1:03:23] understand it all but there's something
[1:03:25] inside of us that just desires to keep
[1:03:27] pressing on because we believe this this
[1:03:30] is more than just words and print this
[1:03:32] is more than just something that we
[1:03:34] listen to this is this is the word of
[1:03:36] life for our age
[1:03:39] I was thinking about this you know just
[1:03:41] contemplating it and how we have faith
[1:03:44] and perfect love is is perfect Faith
[1:03:47] isn't it and we can't have perfect love
[1:03:51] until we get perfect faith we have got
[1:03:54] to have perfect faith in the word
[1:03:55] perfect faith in the word for our day is
[1:03:58] going to bring us perfect love because
[1:04:00] perfect love brothers and sisters isn't
[1:04:03] something we can just run down to the
[1:04:04] store and buy we can run down and get a
[1:04:06] bag of whatever it is that we want to
[1:04:08] buy but we can't go to a store anywhere
[1:04:10] and say I want to get a couple pounds of
[1:04:12] perfect love or a couple tons of perfect
[1:04:14] love it's impossible we can't go and by
[1:04:17] faith that way how do we get this then
[1:04:19] how do we get to the place where we've
[1:04:20] got perfect love again I got the
[1:04:22] question but I believe there's a
[1:04:23] scriptural answer for it and you know
[1:04:25] what we need to get Faith and Faith
[1:04:27] cometh by hearing and hearing of the
[1:04:30] word of the Lord and you know how do we
[1:04:32] do that we go to church we listen to the
[1:04:34] message of the hour we pray we
[1:04:37] Fellowship one to another but you know
[1:04:40] if we're not willing to do any of that
[1:04:42] if we're not willing to go to church if
[1:04:44] we're not willing to actually humble
[1:04:45] ourselves to the word of God we're not
[1:04:46] going to be able to hear it and you know
[1:04:48] just like we've heard many times over
[1:04:50] there's a time where people had the
[1:04:53] opportunity to hear the the sound of
[1:04:55] Jubilee the trumpet of Jubilee and what
[1:04:58] is that trumpet of Jubilee it means
[1:04:59] complete Liberty it doesn't matter what
[1:05:01] kind of a slave or whatever bondage
[1:05:03] you've been under anything you could
[1:05:05] have done you could have been a murderer
[1:05:07] you could have been any kind of slave or
[1:05:09] or bonds person but when that trumpet of
[1:05:11] Jubilee sounded you got to go free you
[1:05:14] got to go back to all that was yours
[1:05:16] Once Upon a Time
[1:05:18] and isn't that wonderful doesn't matter
[1:05:21] what you had gone through where you
[1:05:23] found yourself what what Pig Pen you
[1:05:25] found yourself in
[1:05:27] you could go free and we we know brother
[1:05:29] Adam says it they would throw down their
[1:05:31] rakes and their shovels and say I'm out
[1:05:33] of here I don't have to be under a slave
[1:05:35] Taskmaster anymore I get to go free I
[1:05:37] got to go home I get to go see my family
[1:05:40] brothers and sisters as Sons and
[1:05:42] Daughters of God we can hear the sound
[1:05:44] of of that Jubilee trumpet through the
[1:05:47] voice of a Vindicated Prophet what that
[1:05:49] is is our Jubilee spiritually speaking
[1:05:51] it gives us the ability to get the
[1:05:53] baptism of the Holy Spirit the true
[1:05:55] baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot
[1:05:57] of anointing of the holy spirit in this
[1:05:59] world there's a lot of people that are
[1:06:00] claiming Jesus Christ lots of people
[1:06:02] claiming the blood
[1:06:04] who am I but is he Lord
[1:06:12] you know verse 21 I think says it all
[1:06:14] we've got to be willing to submit
[1:06:15] ourselves one to another in the fear of
[1:06:17] God
[1:06:18] and when we can't do that there's
[1:06:19] something wrong
[1:06:21] but when we can do it I think that is
[1:06:23] the beginning that's the gateway to
[1:06:25] seeing all of this Ephesians come to
[1:06:27] pass uh is it seeing it open up the
[1:06:29] power of the scripture we've heard
[1:06:31] testimonies little tiny things but you
[1:06:33] know these little tiny things are really
[1:06:35] big things
[1:06:36] we can hear people say that you know I
[1:06:38] had this desire to do something on my
[1:06:40] own as a wife and and I knew my husband
[1:06:43] didn't want me to do it that way but
[1:06:44] what I did was I said it's not the way
[1:06:46] that I want to do it but I'm just going
[1:06:48] to say honey what do you want to do
[1:06:50] just give it to the husband
[1:06:52] and that'd be the husband's deal
[1:06:54] and husband makes a decision and the
[1:06:56] husband says wow
[1:06:58] for you to do that I I don't want to do
[1:07:01] what I want to do I want to do what you
[1:07:02] want to do because you're willing to
[1:07:04] submit to me
[1:07:06] it changes everything brothers and
[1:07:08] sisters
[1:07:09] but that's why I say verse 21 applies 21
[1:07:12] supersedes all of it
[1:07:14] if we can't submit ourselves one to
[1:07:16] another then there's no point in a
[1:07:18] husband saying you got to submit to me
[1:07:20] and and to the wife and the wife serving
[1:07:23] her husband it's not going to happen
[1:07:26] there comes a point in time where we
[1:07:28] have to be able to have faith in this
[1:07:30] scripture what I'm saying is when we
[1:07:32] have a faith even a teeny little bit of
[1:07:34] faith in this scripture and we're
[1:07:35] willing to let go of our past Notions
[1:07:38] and our past teachings our past
[1:07:40] traditions and say I'm just going to
[1:07:41] allow the Lord if this is real lord then
[1:07:43] just make this real to me in my life
[1:07:45] don't don't care what anybody else says
[1:07:47] like brother Branham said I'm not gonna
[1:07:49] let anybody allow me to get off the word
[1:07:51] I'm going to stay straight on that word
[1:07:52] that's what I want to do and when God
[1:07:54] hears us say that in our lives I don't
[1:07:56] understand it how can I actually submit
[1:07:58] myself to my husband I've been taught to
[1:08:00] be a strong woman and stand on my own
[1:08:04] how could I do that I guarantee you God
[1:08:06] will pour out a blessing upon you sister
[1:08:08] God will show you that this is exactly
[1:08:11] right and when he does what happens is
[1:08:14] it causes a little bit of Faith to grow
[1:08:16] it causes a little bit of confidence in
[1:08:18] this word and the more that you get
[1:08:20] confidence the more that you'll apply
[1:08:22] the word and the more you apply the more
[1:08:24] you get that's the way God works but if
[1:08:27] we try and do it our own way mix our own
[1:08:29] thoughts our own thinking with it you
[1:08:31] know what I don't have to believe it I
[1:08:32] don't believe that God said a prophet
[1:08:34] when we start going down that road it
[1:08:35] changes it
[1:08:37] because he was straight on the word
[1:08:40] but when we can say I don't understand
[1:08:41] it I don't get it I don't completely
[1:08:43] comprehend all this business of the
[1:08:46] message of the hour but you know what if
[1:08:48] you just try a little bit if you taste a
[1:08:50] little bit if you just give a little bit
[1:08:52] just say God show me a little bit just
[1:08:54] open my eyes a little bit he'll show you
[1:08:56] it's not just for wives it's not just
[1:08:58] for husbands it's not just for children
[1:09:00] you know we come to a place where we
[1:09:02] have to lay down our own faith First
[1:09:03] Peter 1 8 says whom having not seen ye
[1:09:06] love we love him but we don't see him in
[1:09:09] whom now ye see him not yet we believe
[1:09:11] we believe him now oh it says you
[1:09:14] rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
[1:09:17] Glory when we get together in a service
[1:09:19] it's not just something that we do to
[1:09:21] see each other
[1:09:22] we want to see each other we don't want
[1:09:24] to come to church and not see anyone
[1:09:25] kovid was terrible we'd come to the
[1:09:27] building and there'd be five people
[1:09:30] but when we can get together like this
[1:09:32] we can sing with joy unspeakable and
[1:09:34] full of Glory because we recognize what
[1:09:36] he's done for us and what he's done for
[1:09:39] us has showed us the end of our faith
[1:09:40] it's not our faith we can't have perfect
[1:09:43] love with our faith it's got to be his
[1:09:45] faith and when it's his faith then it
[1:09:47] becomes perfect
[1:09:49] receiving the end of your faith even the
[1:09:51] salvation of your souls and this this
[1:09:54] brothers and sisters this just gets me
[1:09:55] of which salvation the prophets have
[1:09:58] inquired and searched diligently who
[1:10:01] prophesied of the grace that should come
[1:10:04] unto you
[1:10:05] how is that Grace going to come unto you
[1:10:07] how is that Grace going to come unto me
[1:10:09] it's going to come through the voice of
[1:10:12] a Vindicated prophet God speaking to man
[1:10:15] saying just stay straight on the word
[1:10:17] and then you can press on to that Mark
[1:10:20] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:10:22] in Christ Jesus
[1:10:24] you know I just started thinking about
[1:10:26] it in our positions brothers and sisters
[1:10:28] how how the husband he's got away every
[1:10:31] single time and the wife she's got away
[1:10:34] every single time it's the way it is
[1:10:36] it's different halves of the person
[1:10:39] right different parts of the person we
[1:10:41] know the Adam when he was created in the
[1:10:42] image of God God said in the mayor in in
[1:10:46] the image of God created he they male
[1:10:49] and female he created them as one they
[1:10:52] were one Spirit together and then he
[1:10:54] formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth
[1:10:56] and man still had woman in him and God
[1:10:58] performed the first operation and pulled
[1:11:00] that rib out and created woman from him
[1:11:03] God didn't actually just speak her into
[1:11:06] existence she was a part of him
[1:11:09] she came from Adam
[1:11:12] and when we have a husband and wife we
[1:11:14] have two halves of the whole
[1:11:16] but there's actually three that need to
[1:11:18] be a part of it those two come together
[1:11:20] and they have their their ways and what
[1:11:23] I want to get to tonight brothers and
[1:11:24] sisters is understanding when we have a
[1:11:26] husband and he's got certain ways as a
[1:11:29] wife we want to honor those ways
[1:11:31] even when oh my this is where it gets
[1:11:34] tough even when they're a little bit
[1:11:35] shaky and maybe a little bit off the
[1:11:37] word what does brother Bradham say in
[1:11:39] the message of the hour he says when
[1:11:40] your husband starts to get a little bit
[1:11:41] rough the woman asks them the question
[1:11:43] he says just bake him a pie oh my when
[1:11:46] the husband starts to get a little bit
[1:11:47] Gruff and he's not really nice and
[1:11:49] there's problems in the home what what
[1:11:51] is a what should a wife do just bake him
[1:11:53] a pie show them love Express that
[1:11:55] perfect love show that you're a daughter
[1:11:58] of God but the same thing goes the other
[1:12:00] way it's not just for the wife to
[1:12:03] completely submit to the to the husband
[1:12:04] the husband needs to submit to the wife
[1:12:08] because it says submitting yourselves
[1:12:10] one to another in the fear of God
[1:12:12] because it's all about God here it's not
[1:12:14] about my wife oh my she's she's she's a
[1:12:17] byproduct of me and I can just treat her
[1:12:19] like a doormat she's supposed to do the
[1:12:21] laundry and the dishes and have my food
[1:12:23] ready for me Brothers if that's what
[1:12:25] we're doing we got it all wrong
[1:12:27] she's your queen
[1:12:30] if anything we should be helping her I
[1:12:32] say Lord help me
[1:12:34] but we all have our ways where I'm going
[1:12:36] with this there's a purpose for it
[1:12:37] children our parents like things a
[1:12:39] certain way our parents come to the
[1:12:41] place where we expect the children to
[1:12:43] hang up their coats
[1:12:44] to put their shoes away
[1:12:46] to bring their backpacks in after school
[1:12:48] and empty their lunch containers to do
[1:12:50] things to contribute maybe put their
[1:12:53] laundry away put it put it downstairs
[1:12:54] where that needs to be washed bring it
[1:12:56] back upstairs when it's all clean
[1:12:57] whatever parents have their ways we all
[1:13:00] want to understand what one another
[1:13:02] likes don't we because when we
[1:13:04] understand that it creates Harmony in
[1:13:05] the home and if we don't have that
[1:13:07] mindset I want to encourage us find out
[1:13:09] what your parents like children husbands
[1:13:12] find out what your wives like you
[1:13:14] shouldn't be married if you don't know
[1:13:15] what your wife likes same thing to the
[1:13:17] wife and a husband but sometimes you
[1:13:19] know we get busy in life things happen
[1:13:21] we get burdened down with the cares of
[1:13:24] life and maybe we can just get a little
[1:13:25] bit cloudy we can get a little bit
[1:13:27] forgetful and and maybe just stuck in
[1:13:29] our own ways and worried about our own
[1:13:31] problems and forget about what what it
[1:13:33] is our wife likes what our husband likes
[1:13:36] maybe what our parents like
[1:13:38] tonight I want to take it and go further
[1:13:40] I don't want to stay there I want to say
[1:13:41] what does the Holy Spirit like brothers
[1:13:43] and sisters what does our husband like
[1:13:45] because we're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:13:47] if we can recognize what he likes oh my
[1:13:50] then we'll have that testimony too if
[1:13:52] we're like sister Tina and we say hey
[1:13:54] I'm not going to take what the doctor
[1:13:56] says I'm going to take what the great
[1:13:57] physician says and he's going to do it
[1:13:59] his way
[1:14:01] whether he takes me by the grave or he
[1:14:03] takes me by the sky it's going to be his
[1:14:05] way
[1:14:07] out of 1955. the power of the devil
[1:14:11] brother Branham says there's something
[1:14:13] trying to work in every individual heart
[1:14:15] here tonight
[1:14:17] saying that's the truth
[1:14:19] but does it mean me
[1:14:22] he says yes it means whosoever will let
[1:14:25] him come it means you
[1:14:29] the Holy Ghost is here to save every
[1:14:31] sinner
[1:14:33] to call back every backslider
[1:14:36] to heal every sick person
[1:14:40] that's the attributes of death of the
[1:14:42] death of Jesus Christ and he's here to
[1:14:45] make manifest
[1:14:46] I just want to say this just for the
[1:14:49] record some people would say he's here
[1:14:51] to heal the sick is he
[1:14:52] but sister Tina was sick and she passed
[1:14:55] away didn't she
[1:14:56] so where's our faith so where's her
[1:14:58] faith so where's the problem there's got
[1:15:00] to be an issue or or a situation
[1:15:02] remember nothing happens by accident God
[1:15:05] doesn't call someone home by accident
[1:15:06] there's no oh I didn't realize that that
[1:15:09] brother or that sister was gonna die
[1:15:11] today oh we need to do something in
[1:15:13] heaven here and make things right
[1:15:15] nothing happens unless God first says
[1:15:18] that's going to happen
[1:15:20] and if it's not that way he's not God
[1:15:23] nobody passes away from this Dimension
[1:15:26] and goes to that Dimension unless God
[1:15:28] first says it's time
[1:15:36] he's here tonight to make manifest
[1:15:39] night after night you see him hour after
[1:15:41] hour you see him working and right now
[1:15:44] while I'm trying to keep away from that
[1:15:46] anointing of the Blessed Holy Spirit
[1:15:48] which the angel of God who's the
[1:15:50] infallible person in our midst tonight
[1:15:52] I'm having a time can you imagine this
[1:15:54] he's saying this I'm having a time
[1:15:57] because Visions are jumping all over the
[1:15:59] building at this time and trying to keep
[1:16:01] it down so I can have this prayer line
[1:16:04] I'm not a liar and neither am I a
[1:16:06] hypocrite I'm telling you the truth
[1:16:08] that's right because why the Holy Spirit
[1:16:10] likes for you to have faith
[1:16:16] the Holy Spirit likes for you to have
[1:16:19] faith
[1:16:21] so I want to say this if that's what the
[1:16:23] Holy Spirit likes the Holy Spirit
[1:16:24] doesn't like it when we start to speak
[1:16:26] negative
[1:16:27] the Holy Spirit doesn't like it when we
[1:16:29] hang out with negative
[1:16:31] the Holy Spirit doesn't like negative
[1:16:33] brothers and sisters the Holy Spirit
[1:16:35] likes faith
[1:16:37] the Holy Spirit likes for you to have
[1:16:40] faith
[1:16:41] and the Holy Spirit lives on the word
[1:16:44] that's the reason it gets so big in you
[1:16:47] it stretches out when you receive the
[1:16:49] word of God man it is written man shall
[1:16:53] not live by bread alone but every word
[1:16:55] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:16:57] and when you put the Holy Ghost in you
[1:16:59] go to drinking in the word you begin to
[1:17:02] rise up in faith Hallelujah
[1:17:06] I just think it's so beautiful when we
[1:17:09] talk about this Ephesians chapter 5
[1:17:11] verses 25 to 29 the husband's desire is
[1:17:16] to know
[1:17:18] know what his wife likes
[1:17:21] the husband's desire is to know his
[1:17:23] position and and the wife's desire
[1:17:26] Ephesians 5 22-24 is to know what what
[1:17:31] her husband likes is to know how to
[1:17:34] please her husband it's not just for the
[1:17:37] wife to be pleasing her husband and
[1:17:39] making everything ready for her husband
[1:17:41] the husband is the king sure he is
[1:17:44] but he's also the servant
[1:17:46] because if he's truly the king like the
[1:17:50] King of Kings then he's willing to lay
[1:17:52] down his life just like Christ was
[1:17:53] willing to lay down his life for the
[1:17:55] church
[1:17:56] so I would say in my view that there
[1:17:58] ain't nothing above the husband in the
[1:18:00] home doing nothing
[1:18:04] now could get awfully quiet there clean
[1:18:06] a toilet yeah
[1:18:08] do some laundry sure
[1:18:10] wash some dishes why not
[1:18:14] would it please your wife
[1:18:16] who doesn't want their wife pleased who
[1:18:18] doesn't want to see a happy wife
[1:18:20] she's not the servant
[1:18:23] if we're doing that Brothers we've got
[1:18:24] to stop doing that
[1:18:27] it's true
[1:18:28] just like the wife has to say you know
[1:18:30] what I need to surrender to my husband's
[1:18:32] will even if I don't agree with it I
[1:18:34] need to because I know that's where the
[1:18:36] blessing of God is I know that's what
[1:18:38] his word says when we're doing that
[1:18:40] brothers and sisters we're just saying
[1:18:41] okay God I'm going to take you with your
[1:18:43] word I'm going to apply it the way you
[1:18:44] say to do it and it's up to you to bring
[1:18:46] the results it's not up to me to bring
[1:18:48] the results we talked about it on Sunday
[1:18:49] it's up to God to prove his word not us
[1:18:52] and when we try to do it we make a mess
[1:18:54] of it
[1:18:56] but the wives truly desire children
[1:18:59] desire to know what pleases their
[1:19:02] parents
[1:19:03] because we know that that's what the
[1:19:05] scripture says in Ephesians chapter 6
[1:19:08] in Ephesians chapter 6 children obey
[1:19:10] your parents in the Lord for this is
[1:19:11] right
[1:19:13] honor thy father and the mother which is
[1:19:16] the first commandment with promise that
[1:19:18] it may be well with thee that thou
[1:19:20] mayest live long on the earth that
[1:19:22] everything will be fine just honor your
[1:19:24] father and your mother
[1:19:26] maybe I don't understand it maybe I
[1:19:27] don't like it
[1:19:29] maybe it bugs me
[1:19:31] but you know what if it does God knows
[1:19:33] it
[1:19:34] and as children just ask God to come on
[1:19:37] the scene just as much as you could ask
[1:19:39] God as a husband or you could ask God as
[1:19:41] a wife as a child you could change
[1:19:42] parents Hearts if something isn't right
[1:19:45] in your home
[1:19:46] and I want to say probably even more so
[1:19:49] when he hears the sincere prayer from
[1:19:52] the heart of a child how much more will
[1:19:55] he move I I just think he'll want to
[1:19:57] move a lot we know the disciples said no
[1:19:59] keep them away they're kids they they
[1:20:01] might get my clothes dirty they might
[1:20:03] get your clothes dirty Master they're
[1:20:04] dirty maybe they have snotty noses maybe
[1:20:06] I shouldn't say that from the pulpit but
[1:20:08] their children keep them away they might
[1:20:10] get you sick and what did he say no
[1:20:12] suffer the little children to come unto
[1:20:14] me because unless you're willing to come
[1:20:16] as one of these you won't even see the
[1:20:18] kingdom of heaven
[1:20:23] I just think how much could a child move
[1:20:25] the heart of the Lord how much could he
[1:20:28] move in a home of a family
[1:20:31] my
[1:20:33] I just want to read a few quotes tonight
[1:20:34] about how the Holy Spirit likes it
[1:20:38] the Holy Spirit likes things our husband
[1:20:41] he likes things brothers and sisters
[1:20:44] this great warrior David 1955 if you
[1:20:48] wanna
[1:20:49] bring it up it's zero one one eight
[1:20:53] this great warrior David
[1:20:56] I love how the prophet brother Branham
[1:20:58] he expresses things here it's important
[1:21:00] for us to to recognize it
[1:21:03] I I heard it said when we were in
[1:21:05] Saskatoon that you know if we don't
[1:21:07] preach faith
[1:21:09] it's just going to lay dormant in the
[1:21:11] church it's there
[1:21:13] the faith is there in the hearts of
[1:21:15] people but people need encouragement
[1:21:18] people need to see the power of God move
[1:21:20] in their lives and that's why I said
[1:21:22] tonight if you want to see this
[1:21:24] Ephesians come to life if you want to
[1:21:26] see God move try applying these
[1:21:28] scriptures and say Lord I don't
[1:21:29] understand it my husband will never ever
[1:21:31] ever change he has never changed he's
[1:21:33] always been the same way I just don't
[1:21:35] get it but I'm just going to give it to
[1:21:37] you and see if you'll move on the scene
[1:21:38] Lord watch him move on the scene when
[1:21:40] you do it with a sincere heart
[1:21:44] paragraph 49
[1:21:46] of this great warrior David
[1:21:50] how about the thousands across the
[1:21:52] country today
[1:21:55] some of you sitting here I get your
[1:21:58] letters
[1:21:59] where you were blind and bedridden
[1:22:02] when I was here the last time you walked
[1:22:05] in
[1:22:06] with the sword of faith
[1:22:08] and chopped off the head of that Goliath
[1:22:11] you're holding up tonight for a
[1:22:14] testimony
[1:22:16] made me think how many of us can hold up
[1:22:18] that head of the Giant Goliath in our
[1:22:22] lives that we chopped off by faith in
[1:22:25] our lives
[1:22:26] every single one of us have testimonies
[1:22:29] and I think it's important for us to do
[1:22:30] that and maybe this will be the change
[1:22:33] of my narrative when we have these
[1:22:35] testimony Services it's not just a
[1:22:37] testimony when we see the Lord really do
[1:22:40] something for us in our lives it's
[1:22:42] because we've seen a devil destroyed
[1:22:45] and you know brothers and sisters I
[1:22:46] think it's really important to
[1:22:48] understand well we're talking about
[1:22:49] testimony Services we're talking about
[1:22:51] God moving in our lives we're talking
[1:22:54] about the real deal testimony of the
[1:22:57] Holy Spirit helping us in our lives we
[1:23:00] can say that he helped us get a a great
[1:23:02] discount deal on something that we were
[1:23:04] shopping for and that's fine and good
[1:23:06] but what about our Eternal salvation how
[1:23:09] is God making this word real to us in
[1:23:11] our lives that's the testimonies that
[1:23:13] he's looking to hear
[1:23:17] unbelievers can go out and get good
[1:23:19] deals
[1:23:20] you see he ain't interested in hearing
[1:23:22] that and that's not going to increase
[1:23:23] the faith in the hearts of the children
[1:23:26] but when we hear about how we had this
[1:23:28] tremendous problem that we just didn't
[1:23:30] know how to solve in our life we had a
[1:23:32] doctor's diagnosis that said there was
[1:23:35] going to be a certain way and we said I
[1:23:37] don't know I don't understand it I can't
[1:23:39] believe it I don't want to accept it but
[1:23:41] it scares me Lord I don't know what to
[1:23:43] do I'm your child and you know what I
[1:23:45] honored my father and I honored my
[1:23:47] mother I take you at your word and now I
[1:23:49] give it back to you you said that I
[1:23:50] would live long days on this Earth if
[1:23:52] I'm willing to honor you
[1:23:54] if we can take it to the Lord and say it
[1:23:57] that way you know what we're going to
[1:23:58] have a testimony there will be a Goliath
[1:24:00] in our lives whose head we will chop off
[1:24:03] and then when he comes around again with
[1:24:05] something else we're going to hold up
[1:24:06] that head and say no see that it's gory
[1:24:08] it's gross but hey it's not attached to
[1:24:11] his body anymore
[1:24:13] it was God it wasn't me
[1:24:18] it says when I was here the last time
[1:24:20] you walked in with the sword of faith
[1:24:21] and chopped off the head of that Goliath
[1:24:24] you're holding up for a testimony
[1:24:26] tonight what did the rest of the army
[1:24:28] see that's why we have the testimony
[1:24:30] Services that's why God wants to show
[1:24:32] his power in the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:35] Christ
[1:24:36] what does the rest of the army see it's
[1:24:39] beautiful when they seen it could be
[1:24:41] done they said we can do it too for we
[1:24:45] are Israelites also
[1:24:47] and your every one God's children and
[1:24:50] got a right to the blessing
[1:24:53] what does the prophet say here what does
[1:24:55] God say through the prophet pull the
[1:24:58] sword now let's go forth and slay these
[1:25:01] goliaths out of here
[1:25:03] who wants a Goliath in your life anyway
[1:25:06] who wants to drag around a devil who
[1:25:08] wants to make a provision for a devil
[1:25:09] and say oh I just can't get over it I've
[1:25:12] had it for years I'll never be able to
[1:25:13] escape it you know it'll never leave I
[1:25:16] just it's always going to be the same
[1:25:18] brothers and sisters if that's what you
[1:25:19] say then that's what it'll be but if
[1:25:21] you're willing to take God at his word
[1:25:24] and say I'm going to pull that sword I
[1:25:26] know the prophet of God said it I don't
[1:25:28] understand it I just believe it that's
[1:25:30] the only thing we're supposed to do is
[1:25:31] just believe not understand it and
[1:25:33] explain it away
[1:25:35] if you can do that then you don't have
[1:25:37] real faith
[1:25:39] you don't have faith in the word you got
[1:25:40] an understanding you got a comprehension
[1:25:42] you got the ability to to believe in
[1:25:45] something other than the word of God
[1:25:49] he says they
[1:25:50] Strode their dead bodies
[1:25:53] pull the sword now he says let's go
[1:25:55] forth and slay these goliaths out of
[1:25:57] here they Strode their dead bodies
[1:26:00] plumbed to The Valleys up over the
[1:26:02] hillsides to the gates
[1:26:04] and we know that he's talking about the
[1:26:06] story of David and Goliath and remember
[1:26:08] that's what happened
[1:26:10] they were there boasting
[1:26:12] and nobody in the camp was willing to go
[1:26:14] forwards everyone was afraid of it when
[1:26:17] we get a Goliath he's going to come
[1:26:18] brothers and sisters count on it Goliath
[1:26:21] is going to come into our camp he's
[1:26:24] going to be standing and he's going to
[1:26:25] be boasting and he's going to be saying
[1:26:27] you can't do nothing look at you he's
[1:26:30] going to go on and on and on and on and
[1:26:32] eventually someone I would say probably
[1:26:35] a little shrimp maybe a little child is
[1:26:37] going to stand up in the midst of the
[1:26:39] congregation and say but do you know
[1:26:41] that's not according to the word of God
[1:26:43] why are we letting this giant boast he's
[1:26:46] not even in his land he's in our land we
[1:26:49] have got full Authority and power over
[1:26:51] that devil what's wrong with everyone
[1:26:53] here that's how God works he raises up a
[1:26:55] shrimp
[1:26:57] someone little a nobody
[1:26:59] and that person is going to go forwards
[1:27:01] and say hey you know what you come to me
[1:27:04] with swords and staves but I come to you
[1:27:06] in the name of the Living God and today
[1:27:08] I'm going to cut your head off
[1:27:13] and the whole Army's gonna see it and
[1:27:16] what's going to happen it's going to
[1:27:17] increase Faith we're going to get Faith
[1:27:19] like we've never had before we're going
[1:27:22] to have faith that nobody's ever going
[1:27:24] to shake and you know brothers and
[1:27:25] sisters I can't help but believe it
[1:27:27] that's why I'm preaching it the way I am
[1:27:28] tonight this is where my heart is I
[1:27:30] believe God wants to do this in our
[1:27:32] congregation in our midst we don't have
[1:27:34] to tolerate Giants in our lives
[1:27:38] you don't have to
[1:27:41] doesn't matter how big it is how small
[1:27:43] it is how insignificant maybe how
[1:27:46] embarrassing or secret it is it's a
[1:27:48] devil it's a giant the word says confess
[1:27:52] your faults one to another and pray for
[1:27:54] one another and you shall be healed
[1:27:58] you want to take that devil's head off
[1:27:59] take the word of God stay straight on
[1:28:02] that word of God and you'll take his
[1:28:04] head off and the next time he comes
[1:28:06] around you can show him no look at your
[1:28:08] buddy here you want the same thing
[1:28:10] he's going to scram he's going to be
[1:28:12] afraid because the word of the God says
[1:28:14] submit yourself therefore unto God
[1:28:16] then resist the devil and he will flee
[1:28:19] from you
[1:28:21] you don't run from him
[1:28:25] I just want to read this again I think
[1:28:27] it's so beautiful they strolled their
[1:28:28] dead bodies plumbed to The Valleys up
[1:28:30] over the hillsides to the gates sure you
[1:28:33] can do it it's yours
[1:28:36] it's for you
[1:28:38] it's all it's for every believer
[1:28:41] and you know we're not slaying physical
[1:28:43] people here we're not talking about that
[1:28:46] we're talking about devils
[1:28:49] satanic devils
[1:28:52] they've got their guns trained on the
[1:28:53] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:28:55] that is the battle line that's the front
[1:28:58] line today brothers and sisters we're
[1:29:00] not wrestling against flesh and blood
[1:29:01] you're not wrestling against your
[1:29:02] brother and your sister you're not
[1:29:03] wrestling against that other minister
[1:29:05] you're not wrestling against all the
[1:29:06] deacons or the trustees or all this
[1:29:08] business this world has to present to us
[1:29:10] according to our natural senses we're
[1:29:12] wrestling against against principalities
[1:29:14] and Powers
[1:29:16] rulers of Darkness spiritual wickedness
[1:29:18] in high places this is a spiritual
[1:29:21] battle that we're dealing with but we
[1:29:23] have the ability to destroy their dead
[1:29:25] bodies Plum to The Valleys up over the
[1:29:27] hillsides and the gates sure you can do
[1:29:29] it too it's yours it's for it's for
[1:29:31] every believer remember we talked about
[1:29:33] it on Sunday I don't know how many
[1:29:34] people went and looked at it but what
[1:29:36] was the story about that that shrimp
[1:29:38] with that Nazarite vow with those little
[1:29:40] Seven Locks of curls hanging down his
[1:29:42] head that brother Branham called
[1:29:44] him what did he do he picked up the
[1:29:46] Jawbone of a mule just do it he was out
[1:29:48] just being himself he was just out doing
[1:29:50] what he does he wasn't wearing clergy
[1:29:53] clothes and and going to church and had
[1:29:55] his all men's all right and and was
[1:29:56] serving God perfectly according to the
[1:29:58] message of the hour he was just a normal
[1:30:00] believer doing his thing with the
[1:30:02] Nazarite vow wasn't he once upon a time
[1:30:04] I'd go so far as to say that he got the
[1:30:06] baptism of the Holy Spirit even though
[1:30:07] the Holy Spirit wasn't given then it's
[1:30:09] the same spirit
[1:30:10] in the Old Testament it's the same
[1:30:12] Spirit of the New Testament but somehow
[1:30:14] he got the Holy Spirit baptism and what
[1:30:16] did he do he picked up that Jawbone of a
[1:30:19] mule that should have just disintegrated
[1:30:20] to powder in the first hit and every
[1:30:22] time he did that I think it's so
[1:30:24] beautiful what did he do he increased
[1:30:26] his testimony and what he did was he
[1:30:28] just just just Sanctified that bow he
[1:30:30] just increased that Nazarite bow every
[1:30:33] single time he did it and how many times
[1:30:35] did he do it for a thousand Philistines
[1:30:36] for a thousand trained Army how many
[1:30:39] times did he swing that thing
[1:30:42] I think it's beautiful he was just out
[1:30:44] being himself
[1:30:45] he wasn't trying to be anybody he just
[1:30:47] found himself in the open and then
[1:30:49] suddenly there's a thousand pills
[1:30:51] Philippines and they're looking to do
[1:30:52] them in they wanted to get him
[1:30:54] the power of God came on them brothers
[1:30:56] and sisters
[1:30:58] count on it you're going to be out in
[1:31:00] the open
[1:31:01] and there's going to be a thousand
[1:31:02] Philistines
[1:31:04] and what are you gonna do
[1:31:06] what are we going to do
[1:31:07] you know we can get on the phone and
[1:31:09] call everyone and say we need prayer
[1:31:12] we can send out an SOS text message
[1:31:15] or we can say God I I I I I'm nobody
[1:31:19] but I know that I've got your token I
[1:31:22] know that you've dealt with me
[1:31:23] individually and Lord I know that you
[1:31:26] have called me to where I'm at today and
[1:31:29] because of that you will make a way
[1:31:30] through this problem and you know what I
[1:31:32] know that you will stroll the bodies all
[1:31:35] over the place number 50 says don't
[1:31:37] leave this building tonight without
[1:31:39] having the Holy Spirit cut away that old
[1:31:41] blind shackle that stands there throw
[1:31:43] the thing away
[1:31:45] say I believe God and walk out of here
[1:31:47] like a man or a woman a child of God
[1:31:50] with the Victory and The Morning Star
[1:31:52] leading you marching on
[1:31:55] to Glory
[1:31:58] the devil raised up and say well I
[1:31:59] thought you I thought I had you
[1:32:03] say to him I told you you didn't
[1:32:06] walk right on that's it
[1:32:09] don't stand to have a conversation with
[1:32:10] them
[1:32:11] don't open up a dialogue and start a
[1:32:13] text thread don't do it don't listen to
[1:32:16] his rattle just walk on
[1:32:19] that's it come back at the next meeting
[1:32:21] shake that old head of that old devil
[1:32:25] that had you bound say looky here you
[1:32:27] remember me I was that person I was up
[1:32:30] there I was the person sitting here and
[1:32:33] the doctor said I couldn't live but for
[1:32:35] a few days longer here I am yet tonight
[1:32:38] Hallelujah and you know brothers and
[1:32:40] sisters the reason why I got so much
[1:32:42] inspiration is I know sister Tina did
[1:32:44] that exact thing
[1:32:46] multiple times she was in the hospital
[1:32:48] the doctors were saying oh no no it's
[1:32:50] not good it's not good and she said you
[1:32:52] know what I know I'm not gonna stay here
[1:32:56] I'm going out of this hospital because
[1:32:58] God's My Healer
[1:33:01] he said then somebody said you know if
[1:33:03] she can do it I can too
[1:33:06] take him at his word brothers and
[1:33:07] sisters when we see someone do it when
[1:33:10] God blesses someone according to his
[1:33:11] word if you come the same way that's
[1:33:13] what the prophet said when you come the
[1:33:15] same way God will honor your faith too
[1:33:17] because you're not you're not bringing
[1:33:19] your own faith
[1:33:20] if you see him move in a situation it's
[1:33:23] not his faith I mean it's not your faith
[1:33:25] it's not my faith it's his faith doing
[1:33:27] it
[1:33:30] that's why I think it's so beautiful
[1:33:31] with such a revelation for me early in
[1:33:34] the spring it's not us doing it we can
[1:33:37] jump up and down and scream and shout
[1:33:38] brother Bradham says it pour a gallon of
[1:33:40] oil right
[1:33:42] nothing's going to move a devil except
[1:33:44] for the word of God
[1:33:45] oh my but when it's the word of God the
[1:33:48] true word of God on the heart of a
[1:33:49] Believer a devil is going to run for his
[1:33:51] life
[1:33:53] then somebody said you know if she can
[1:33:55] do it I can too so I'll trust him amen
[1:33:58] you don't know what's the matter tonight
[1:34:00] oh how the Holy Spirit likes to get
[1:34:04] people into a bunch likes to get into a
[1:34:07] bunch of people like this now if you
[1:34:09] could only realize where you're at only
[1:34:11] realize not say in this building you're
[1:34:14] in Christ
[1:34:16] positionally in our positions brothers
[1:34:18] and sisters is where the power lies
[1:34:21] positionally everything's yours all
[1:34:24] yours it belongs to you do you now
[1:34:26] believe
[1:34:28] people might say well I'm just here at
[1:34:30] Calgary Living Word and it's just just
[1:34:32] this church in Calgary if you've come to
[1:34:34] that then you've missed the point
[1:34:37] because we're not coming unto the the
[1:34:39] Church of of of of a a many-membered
[1:34:43] body that's according to
[1:34:45] denominationalism we're coming to the
[1:34:47] Church of the Living Christ Jesus we're
[1:34:49] coming into the unfailing body word of
[1:34:52] Christ
[1:34:56] only realize not say in this building
[1:34:58] you're in Christ
[1:35:00] positionally everything's yours all
[1:35:02] yours
[1:35:03] it belongs to you
[1:35:05] I want to say this if we can apply
[1:35:07] Ephesians chapter 5 and and six and
[1:35:09] there's other scriptures that go along
[1:35:10] with it we're going to see God move in
[1:35:13] our homes we're going to see God moving
[1:35:15] our lives and you know I can say this
[1:35:17] brothers and sisters I I this all
[1:35:19] started I don't know how long ago we
[1:35:21] started preaching this but it started
[1:35:23] with me saying you know I I think it'd
[1:35:25] be really good to get a good teacher to
[1:35:27] come in and start preaching this to our
[1:35:28] church and and really get this going and
[1:35:30] you know I believe the Lord said to me
[1:35:32] you know what it doesn't start there it
[1:35:34] starts with you if you're the pastor
[1:35:35] it's your responsibility you need to
[1:35:37] know this stuff and so I started to dig
[1:35:39] into it and I thought wow this is
[1:35:42] amazing but you know it's not for me
[1:35:44] although it is for my family it's for
[1:35:47] everyone
[1:35:48] will see success in their lives if we
[1:35:51] can apply this word
[1:35:54] I just think it's beautiful tonight to
[1:35:56] know what the Holy Spirit likes what our
[1:35:57] husband likes
[1:35:59] if we can understand what he likes
[1:36:00] brothers and sisters give him what he's
[1:36:02] likes give them do what he likes just do
[1:36:05] what he likes you'll please him and when
[1:36:07] he's pleased I guarantee you he's going
[1:36:09] to please you he's going to give us our
[1:36:11] desires they might not come exactly the
[1:36:14] way that we think they should come or
[1:36:16] the way that we want them to come but
[1:36:18] when they do come we'll look back and
[1:36:20] we'll say Lord thank you because this is
[1:36:22] the way it had to be in order for this
[1:36:23] to happen the way that it has I might
[1:36:26] not have seen it this way we can't
[1:36:28] explain God away
[1:36:32] 1955-0724 enticing spirits
[1:36:35] paragraph 178.
[1:36:39] I love the way the prophet expresses it
[1:36:41] he says my
[1:36:43] I feel like the Rapture is just above
[1:36:45] the church oh it makes me feel so good
[1:36:49] all sins under the blood see the Holy
[1:36:52] Spirit likes the word
[1:36:54] the word is what the Holy Spirit feeds
[1:36:57] on
[1:36:59] you see oh my
[1:37:02] and that's why I just think it's so sad
[1:37:04] so sad
[1:37:06] we can have now we're at the place where
[1:37:09] we have people I'm not done with that
[1:37:11] one by the way but we have people who
[1:37:14] will Heap to themselves having
[1:37:16] teachers heaps of themselves teachers
[1:37:18] having itchy ears
[1:37:20] we can we've never had a time like we
[1:37:22] can do it right now there's people that
[1:37:24] actually will sit in a church and and
[1:37:27] they'll have the the ability to feed
[1:37:31] upon the word in the church and and then
[1:37:34] go home and actually have their favorite
[1:37:36] Pastor feed them the word as well then
[1:37:38] there's others that will actually not
[1:37:40] even go to church and they'll just have
[1:37:42] the the favorite Pastor or minister in
[1:37:44] in in whatever congregation they have
[1:37:46] online and they'll be able to stream
[1:37:48] them brothers and sisters that's not
[1:37:50] applying the word of God in your life
[1:37:52] you're actually not pleasing the Holy
[1:37:54] Spirit by doing that and that's just
[1:37:55] brother Barry speaking I know some
[1:37:57] people will say oh that's just brother
[1:37:58] Barry speaking that but you know what
[1:38:00] you you can take it or leave it it's
[1:38:01] fine but if you want to see the word of
[1:38:03] God operate in your life try Ephesians
[1:38:06] chapter 4 where it talks about there
[1:38:08] being prophets and teachers and
[1:38:11] evangelists and pastors and see if the
[1:38:13] five-fold ministry doesn't actually play
[1:38:15] a part in in the word of God in our
[1:38:17] lives and when we do that brothers and
[1:38:19] sisters again then we'll see the Holy
[1:38:21] Spirit pleased in our lives and again he
[1:38:23] will come around and pour out a blessing
[1:38:25] that you might not even be able to
[1:38:26] contain because if you do that then you
[1:38:29] hold God responsible to what to his word
[1:38:31] not to your opinion not to your
[1:38:34] Traditions or teachings not not applying
[1:38:37] the other part of the scripture saying
[1:38:38] that they're ever learning never able to
[1:38:40] come to the knowledge of the truth some
[1:38:42] folks are like that we don't want to be
[1:38:44] that way we want to say Lord I take you
[1:38:46] at your word and I might not understand
[1:38:48] it like I said I might not understand it
[1:38:50] but I'm just going to give it to you I'm
[1:38:51] going to say I'm going to go forwards
[1:38:53] and do it and ask you to show me that
[1:38:55] that's the way you want it done and I
[1:38:57] promise you'll do it he will
[1:38:59] he says my I feel like the Rapture is
[1:39:02] just above the church oh it makes me
[1:39:03] feel so good all sins are under the
[1:39:05] blood see the Holy Spirit likes the word
[1:39:07] the word is what the Holy Spirit feeds
[1:39:09] on you see oh my it comes down and gets
[1:39:12] among the people cleanses their sins
[1:39:14] takes away their sickness takes their
[1:39:15] Blues Away now I'm drunk just drunk as I
[1:39:19] can be drunk on the spirit love drawing
[1:39:22] out of my heart no matter what anybody
[1:39:24] has had ever done it's forgiven your
[1:39:28] bitterest enemy it's all over
[1:39:33] 1957-0310 e hear ye him
[1:39:38] paragraph
[1:39:40] 28.
[1:39:42] I just love seeing the prophet of God
[1:39:44] say it and that's why I bring the quotes
[1:39:46] I want to stay straight on the word I
[1:39:48] don't ever want to deviate from it even
[1:39:50] though I have a feeling and maybe a
[1:39:51] desire I I feel inspired about a certain
[1:39:53] thing I want to make sure that that's
[1:39:55] what he says about it and if he doesn't
[1:39:56] say it then I don't want to say it
[1:39:58] because even though I feel that way it
[1:40:00] doesn't do me any good and it doesn't do
[1:40:01] anybody any good we've got to make sure
[1:40:03] it's what the prophet said it's what the
[1:40:05] word of God said
[1:40:07] paragraph 28 of this scripture or this
[1:40:10] message sorry hear ye him
[1:40:12] 1957. oh I wished I had the voice and
[1:40:15] could stand here in the time we could
[1:40:18] lay on that for hours of the
[1:40:20] Disobedience of the church to God
[1:40:23] and the Holy Spirit is bringing that
[1:40:25] word back and forth
[1:40:28] now
[1:40:30] but what if that child has done good
[1:40:33] but the bottom is talking about the
[1:40:35] story of the tutor here just for time's
[1:40:37] sake I'm gonna I'm just gonna say it
[1:40:39] he's talking about the tutor now the
[1:40:40] tutor gives the story back to the father
[1:40:43] about the one child and and the story
[1:40:45] back to the father about the other child
[1:40:47] now but what if that child has done good
[1:40:49] oh how the Holy Spirit likes to bring
[1:40:52] their character how the teacher would
[1:40:55] like to come to the father and say are
[1:40:59] you the father of the child
[1:41:01] can you imagine this the Holy Spirit
[1:41:04] going back and saying are you the father
[1:41:06] of that child Brother Don snow are you
[1:41:09] his father
[1:41:10] I am
[1:41:12] not I will be not I was I am
[1:41:17] all right I want to tell you that little
[1:41:20] fellow is one of the smartest little
[1:41:22] chaps I've ever seen oh even though he's
[1:41:24] youthful he's just oh he's a chip off
[1:41:27] the old block that's all he loves you
[1:41:30] he's just exactly like you he's about
[1:41:33] your business he stands just exactly
[1:41:36] firm on what you say
[1:41:38] why he's just like you
[1:41:41] how that teacher likes to say that
[1:41:44] and how are we ever going to express
[1:41:46] that character back how are we ever
[1:41:49] going to show that to the tutor for him
[1:41:50] to go and have that conversation with
[1:41:52] the Father the only way is by his word
[1:41:55] the only way is by speaking his word the
[1:41:58] only way is by eating his word the only
[1:42:00] way is by living his word and really the
[1:42:03] only way any of that's going to happen
[1:42:04] is just to give way just to yield to
[1:42:06] submit ourselves in the fear of God and
[1:42:08] allow him to come into our lives the
[1:42:10] true baptism of the Holy Spirit and let
[1:42:12] him live out this word because then
[1:42:15] he'll take the report back that we want
[1:42:17] to give
[1:42:18] he says what do you think the father
[1:42:19] thinks when that happens what do you
[1:42:22] think the father thinks swells out his
[1:42:24] chest That's my boy oh God how I hope I
[1:42:28] hope I can be obedient enough till the
[1:42:31] father will be pleased with what I did
[1:42:35] I hope that you're obedient enough to be
[1:42:38] that it'll please God and you know
[1:42:40] brothers and sisters without faith it's
[1:42:42] impossible to please God let's turn over
[1:42:45] to Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:42:48] now we can get into our topic
[1:42:50] [Laughter]
[1:42:52] I love how the Lord does this I love it
[1:42:54] I love it
[1:42:56] once upon a time I thought my I don't
[1:42:58] know how I'm ever going to have enough
[1:42:59] enough words to say to get up there and
[1:43:01] preach but now I don't have enough time
[1:43:04] there's just not enough time
[1:43:07] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 says now
[1:43:09] Faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:43:12] for brother Branham says this faith that
[1:43:14] he's talking about here is an actual
[1:43:16] thing it's an actual substance just like
[1:43:19] in the universe there's different
[1:43:20] substances faith is also a substance you
[1:43:23] know that there's a light spectrum and
[1:43:25] there's radio waves and there's light
[1:43:26] that we can see and there's UV radiation
[1:43:29] UV light there's faith in the universe
[1:43:31] brothers and sisters you just can't see
[1:43:33] it with your eyes you can't feel it with
[1:43:36] your feelings it's not for our senses
[1:43:39] brother Bradham calls it The Sixth Sense
[1:43:41] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:43:43] for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:43:47] for by it the elders obtained a good
[1:43:51] report
[1:43:52] through faith we understand that the
[1:43:54] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[1:43:58] that things which are seen were not made
[1:44:01] of things which do appear
[1:44:04] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:44:07] excellent sacrifice
[1:44:09] than Cain
[1:44:11] we know that he had a revelation didn't
[1:44:13] he
[1:44:14] why did he offer something different why
[1:44:15] did they both offer something different
[1:44:18] we know that Cain brought the fruit of
[1:44:19] the of the land and it was probably just
[1:44:21] a beautiful worship service it was
[1:44:23] flowery and it was fruity it probably
[1:44:26] had the best of everything
[1:44:27] and and Abel he just had a sharp rock
[1:44:30] and a and a lamb and he went and chopped
[1:44:33] the neck of that lamb until it bled to
[1:44:35] death and we know that Cain probably
[1:44:37] thought he was a lunatic and everyone
[1:44:40] else thought he was a lunatic why would
[1:44:41] he be doing that it was because he had
[1:44:43] faith and faith comes from God as a
[1:44:46] revelation in the heart of a believer
[1:44:48] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:44:52] excellent sacrifice than Cain
[1:44:55] by which he obtained witness that he was
[1:44:57] righteous God testifying of his gifts if
[1:45:02] you would just do like your brother then
[1:45:04] your sacrifice would be accepted right
[1:45:06] God testifying of his gifts and by it he
[1:45:10] being dead yet speaketh
[1:45:13] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:45:16] should not see death
[1:45:18] and was not found because God had
[1:45:20] translated him for before his
[1:45:22] translation he had this testimony
[1:45:26] that he pleased God
[1:45:29] brothers and sisters tonight I want to
[1:45:31] say it I'll call the musicians because
[1:45:33] we're at the end but what is it that
[1:45:36] pleases God
[1:45:37] what is it that the Holy Spirit likes
[1:45:40] what does our husband like in our lives
[1:45:42] he likes faith
[1:45:45] faith in his word not not mixed and
[1:45:48] mingled with with denominational
[1:45:50] teaching with former thoughts and ideas
[1:45:53] with maybe family tradition he's not
[1:45:56] interested in culture he's not even
[1:45:58] interested in our perfect form and
[1:46:00] mechanics in here he's interested in
[1:46:02] submitted Hearts the ones that are
[1:46:04] willing to say just be it unto me
[1:46:06] according to Thy word that's what he's
[1:46:08] looking for brothers and sisters verse
[1:46:10] six is where I want to get to but
[1:46:12] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:46:15] him
[1:46:17] we can bring all of our flowers
[1:46:20] and all of our fruits
[1:46:22] we can bring all of our best efforts we
[1:46:24] can tithe we can tithe 90 and keep ten
[1:46:28] right
[1:46:30] but we don't got faith
[1:46:32] it does nothing
[1:46:33] and we know that that we can talk about
[1:46:35] it from from from the aspect of Paul
[1:46:38] talking uh I can't remember where it's
[1:46:40] at exactly but but we we got to have
[1:46:43] faith and and perfect love brother
[1:46:46] random talked about it perfect love is
[1:46:47] really what it takes the statue of the
[1:46:50] perfect man and unless we have those
[1:46:52] things is
[1:46:54] and the only way we're going to get it
[1:46:55] is the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy
[1:46:57] Spirit
[1:46:58] repent for your sins
[1:47:00] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:47:02] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:47:04] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:47:06] the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the
[1:47:08] Holy Ghost the opening of this word for
[1:47:11] you in your lives and you know what if
[1:47:13] if maybe that sounds like something
[1:47:14] that's just I can't even understand that
[1:47:16] why would I do that I've already been
[1:47:18] baptized in titles well titles aren't
[1:47:20] names
[1:47:22] who's the father who is the son
[1:47:25] who's the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ the
[1:47:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ is what's
[1:47:31] going to unlock this scripture for us
[1:47:33] brother if we don't come according to
[1:47:34] the formula we can't expect to get the
[1:47:36] results
[1:47:38] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:47:40] him
[1:47:41] for he that cometh to God must believe
[1:47:44] that he is
[1:47:46] [Music]
[1:47:48] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:47:51] diligently seek him
[1:47:53] I just want to say this tonight brothers
[1:47:54] and sisters
[1:47:56] diligently seek Him diligently seek how
[1:47:59] to please him and I promise you you
[1:48:02] won't be disappointed I promise you that
[1:48:04] he will show you the way
[1:48:07] you stand with me tonight as we close

[1:48:21] ourselves one to another

[1:48:26] Lord Jesus I believe that's the key to
[1:48:28] it all if we could just do that if we
[1:48:30] could humble ourselves father
[1:48:33] not not have a
[1:48:35] starchy attitude towards a brother or a
[1:48:37] sister but then come and humble
