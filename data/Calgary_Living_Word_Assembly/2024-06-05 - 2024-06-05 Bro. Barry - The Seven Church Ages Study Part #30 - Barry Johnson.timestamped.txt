[38:07] scriptures start with Revelations
[38:09] chapter 2 and then I'd like to turn over
[38:11] to St John chapter 15 very familiar
[38:17] scriptures we are in the pergami and
[38:20] church age out of the exposition of the
[38:22] seven Church ages we'll pick up where we
[38:24] left off last
[38:26] week in Revelations chap
[38:32] 2 we'll start with verse
[38:41] 12 and to the angel of the church in
[38:44] pergamus right these things saith he
[38:47] which hath a sharp sword with two
[38:49] edges I Know Thy works and where thou
[38:52] dwellest even where Satan's seat
[38:55] is and thou holdest fast my name and H
[39:00] has not denied my faith even in those
[39:04] days where in antipast was my faithful
[39:06] martyr who was slain among you where
[39:09] Satan dwelleth but I have a few things
[39:12] against thee because thou Hast there
[39:15] them that hold the doctrine of balam who
[39:19] taught baac to cast a stumbling block
[39:22] before the children of Israel to eat
[39:25] things sacrificed unto idols
[39:28] and to commit
[39:30] fornication so hast thou also them that
[39:33] hold the doctrine of the nickoles which
[39:36] thing I hate repent or else I will come
[39:40] unto thee quickly and will fight against
[39:42] them with the sword of my mouth he that
[39:46] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[39:49] saith unto the churches to him that
[39:52] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[39:54] Hidden mana and will give him a white
[39:57] Stone and in the stone a new name
[40:00] written which no man knoweth save he
[40:04] that receiveth
[40:07] it let's turn over to St
[40:11] John chapter
[40:16] 15 verse one
[40:29] St John 15
[40:35] verse1 I am the True Vine and my father
[40:39] is the
[40:40] husbandman every branch in me that
[40:43] beareth not fruit he taketh away and
[40:46] every branch that beareth fruit he
[40:48] purgeth it that it may bring forth more
[40:53] fruit now ye are clean

[41:00] Lord through the word which I have
[41:03] spoken unto you abide in me and I in

[41:25] he that abideth in me and I in him the
[41:29] same bringeth forth much fruit for
[41:31] without me ye can do nothing if a man
[41:34] abide not in me he is cast forth as a
[41:37] branch and is
[41:38] withered how many people have we seen
[41:41] along the way my and Men gather them and
[41:44] cast them into the fire and they are
[41:46] burned if ye abide in me and my words
[41:50] abide in you ye shall ask what ye will
[41:54] yes and it shall be done unto you and

[44:30] 26th and that is a Wednesday and then we
[44:32] have the youth uh gathering on June the
[44:36] 30th and it will be at our house we will
[44:38] be uh taking that that uh Gathering the
[44:43] Youth Event at our place after service
[44:45] on Sunday June the 30th so God bless you
[44:48] tonight as we get into the word um I
[44:52] just this is probably uh one of my
[44:55] favorite parts of the exposition of the
[44:57] seven Church ages as I was going into it
[45:00] I didn't want to get into it last week
[45:02] because I kind of knew that it was going
[45:04] this way and I don't know we'll go fast
[45:07] or we'll go slow tonight we'll just see
[45:09] what the spirit wants to do and see how
[45:12] the Lord
[45:13] Works um certainly excited about the
[45:16] word I wanted to talk about this from a
[45:19] perspective tonight
[45:23] um you know manifestations versus the
[45:27] the word is kind of really what came to
[45:28] my mind what came to Heart many times we
[45:31] can look to see if we have the spirit of
[45:33] Christ in our life based on the
[45:35] manifestation of the Lord in our life
[45:38] and how we we see signs and wonders and
[45:41] you know uh it can be a real challenge
[45:43] to our faith especially the Believers of
[45:46] the message because William Mary and
[45:49] Bram had tremendous signs and wonders
[45:52] following his ministry but the only
[45:54] reason he had that was because of the
[45:56] office that he held
[45:57] and because of that office that he held
[45:59] he actually did something different than
[46:01] everyone else in the whole entire world
[46:03] and that is he actually put the word
[46:05] first true the word first and everything
[46:09] else secondary and even if it took the
[46:11] hide off of people even if it destroyed
[46:13] denominational beliefs even if it
[46:16] shattered what people people's
[46:18] Traditions were and their families it
[46:19] didn't matter and and not that he didn't
[46:21] care he did care he had concern about
[46:23] that but he put the word first am and
[46:27] that's the only way to have success with
[46:30] Christ he just said those words that was
[46:33] God speaking through Jesus Christ just
[46:35] like it was God speaking through William
[46:36] Mary and brandom in John chapter 15 he
[46:39] is the true vine but you know if you
[46:41] abide in me in my words I love that my
[46:44] words the plural part not just a
[46:47] singular word the book The Sword if my
[46:50] words abide in you you shall ask what
[46:53] you will and it shall be done unto you
[46:55] now I'm just going to come back back to
[46:57] that in a little bit but I just think
[46:58] it's it's a wonderful thing because many
[47:00] times people will say that well we
[47:02] believe the message of the hour so we
[47:03] should have tremendous manifestations in
[47:05] our lives well that's not actually the
[47:07] true indication on whether you really
[47:09] believe the message of the hour or not
[47:12] and that's what brother Bram said it's a
[47:14] very important thing and and it just I
[47:16] believe it ties right back into what
[47:18] we've been talking about on Sundays
[47:20] perfect will versus permissive will and
[47:24] you know it's really easy to understand
[47:26] the two I I just felt so inspired when I
[47:29] started thinking about in this vein
[47:30] because really there's there's a
[47:32] separation between the two one word off
[47:35] is permissive
[47:36] will one word off is permissive will
[47:41] perfect will is all of the word even if
[47:44] I don't understand it even if I don't
[47:46] like it even if it doesn't feel good and
[47:50] you know it it goes even further and I
[47:51] think we were trying to get into that on
[47:53] Sunday I believe the Lord was leading me
[47:55] that way and and I'm just going to keep
[47:56] going in that way because I can see
[47:58] that's the direction the Lord wants to
[47:59] go and and when you feel that leadership
[48:02] you got to go with it and it's simple
[48:03] brothers and sisters the message of the
[48:05] hour is no room for negotiating it it's
[48:09] not interpretive it's simple it's cut
[48:12] and dry it's the word of God and but we
[48:14] want to try and manipulate what the
[48:16] prophet said to suit our
[48:19] lifestyle we're actually in permissive
[48:21] will amen but you know what the prophet
[48:24] said God will even bless you right there
[48:27] he'll still bless you and you'll feel
[48:29] blessed and you'll think I'm in God's
[48:32] perfect will but if it's not his perfect
[48:34] word you're in permissive will amen even
[48:37] though you're still blessed what a
[48:39] mighty God we serve amen but he'll take
[48:42] that permissive will and turn it into
[48:43] his perfect will but he'll allow us to
[48:46] get to a place where we will start
[48:48] looking up and and sometimes that's a
[48:51] real sticky place to get amen but I just
[48:54] want to go back a little bit I'm going
[48:55] to try and and read uh we'll see I just
[48:59] thought it was good to go back a little
[49:00] ways um it's paragraph 31 in in the
[49:04] church age book here that I'm reading on
[49:05] in the paman church age brother Bram he
[49:08] says I want you to note very carefully
[49:10] that Jesus did not say that the evidence
[49:14] of being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[49:18] was speaking in tongues and I love the
[49:20] way he says this he's not saying I want
[49:23] to tell you that the evidence is
[49:27] he says
[49:29] Jesus Jesus did not say that the
[49:32] evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[49:34] Ghost was speaking in tongues
[49:36] interpreting prophesying or shouting and
[49:40] dancing he said the evidence would be
[49:42] that she would be in the
[49:44] truth and what's going to be the truth
[49:47] what was in the what was the truth in
[49:48] the days of Noah what was the truth in
[49:50] the days of Jeremiah what was the truth
[49:52] in the days of Ezekiel what was the
[49:54] truth in the days of Amos
[49:57] what was the truth in the days of the
[49:59] Prophet it was the word of God through
[50:01] that
[50:02] prophet he said the evidence would be
[50:05] that you would be in the truth and I
[50:06] want to say this not just say an amen go
[50:09] for it Noah build an ark yeah I believe
[50:12] that you're a prophet of God build that
[50:14] Ark and just sit outside when it was
[50:16] time to go in yeah yeah no way those
[50:21] people who believed it they got in that
[50:22] Ark but there wasn't many people that
[50:25] did that could and believe it but he
[50:28] said the evidence would be that you
[50:29] would be in the truth that you would be
[50:31] in the word of God for your age how
[50:35] could you be in the word of God for your
[50:38] age outside of the Prophet for the
[50:41] age
[50:43] impossible evidence has to do with
[50:47] receiving that word amen now don't get
[50:49] me wrong I believe there's millions and
[50:51] billions of people that are going to
[50:52] claim Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[50:55] today and forever they'll say Jesus
[50:57] Christ his blood it's Jesus Christ that
[51:00] died and rose again and and purchased my
[51:02] salvation and they're 100% right about
[51:05] that but they'll say oh William Mariam
[51:06] brandom no he went off on his Doctrine
[51:09] he he got off track somewhere along the
[51:11] way he's not with the mean stream
[51:13] Doctrine and you know what that's up to
[51:16] them not everyone has the ability to
[51:18] believe it but there is a real distinct
[51:21] separation between perfect will and
[51:23] permissive will all the way in the word
[51:25] and one word off off
[51:28] my 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think
[51:32] himself to be a prophet or spiritual let
[51:35] him acknowledge that the things that I
[51:38] write unto you are the Commandments of
[51:40] the
[51:41] Lord oh my so good so all we have to do
[51:44] is listen to what Paul said and isn't it
[51:46] wonderful to think that this Prophet
[51:48] that we follow he said I only preach
[51:50] what Paul preached that's it it's not a
[51:53] new doctrine it's what's already been
[51:54] said
[51:58] now see that the proof of the IND
[52:00] dwelling
[52:01] Spirit was to
[52:04] acknowledge and
[52:06] follow understand acknowledge say Amen
[52:10] but then follow it but then act upon it
[52:14] but then move what God's Prophet gave
[52:18] for his age as he set the church in
[52:20] order Paul had to say to those who
[52:22] claimed another Revelation verse 36 1
[52:25] Corinthians 14:36 what came the word of
[52:29] God out from you or came it unto you
[52:33] only we know the word of God comes to
[52:35] who comes to the prophet that's the word
[52:38] of God why would he change his program
[52:41] so that Satan could get in Satan would
[52:43] get in God would never change this
[52:45] program but Satan would get in and say
[52:47] well God just kind of changed this
[52:48] program you know there's just a
[52:50] different age now and we've got
[52:51] different things there's different
[52:53] cultures there's different thinking
[52:54] we've got a higher intellect now
[52:57] it's the information superhighway our
[52:58] children have never been so educated we
[53:00] could go on and on and on about all the
[53:02] different things right the condition of
[53:04] of the living in which we we live but we
[53:06] know that he's the same yesterday today
[53:08] and forever and as long as we're willing
[53:09] to align ourselves back with that it
[53:12] doesn't matter how much contamination is
[53:15] in this world and the food that we eat
[53:17] we can bless our food and eat garbage
[53:19] and still get the nutrients out of that
[53:21] food if we need to that's the God we
[53:24] serve we would never go and eat garbage
[53:26] though brothers and sisters and say now
[53:28] I'm going to test God because we know
[53:30] the word of God says that you shouldn't
[53:32] tempt the
[53:34] Lord right it's like drinking poison
[53:37] drinking poison to say whoa I'm going to
[53:40] prove something here but then you get
[53:42] caught in a certain sixe situation I
[53:44] remember brother Ken telling the story
[53:46] about the man I think he was in Russia
[53:49] and he was told you're going to drink
[53:50] this poison he was held captive and told
[53:54] you're going to drink this poison if
[53:55] this is the god you believe then you're
[53:56] going to prove this God and and the guy
[53:59] was like no I don't really want to do
[54:00] that and I might be getting the story a
[54:02] little bit wrong but I know this much
[54:03] there was poison there was a man that
[54:05] was being forced to drink it and he had
[54:07] a dog in the room and the dog was given
[54:09] the same poison and the dog fell down
[54:11] dead and the guy said you know what if
[54:13] you're going to make me do it I'll do it
[54:15] but I'm going to be just like those
[54:16] three Hebrew kids and I'm going to know
[54:17] the God that I serve he will either
[54:20] decide to raise me up and not let it
[54:22] affect me or he'll take me home it's his
[54:24] choice but I know that he lives and I
[54:26] will not renounce him as my God and he
[54:29] took the poison he drank it and he lived
[54:32] that's the God we serve amen but the
[54:34] evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian
[54:36] believer is not to produce the
[54:39] word but to receive the truth
[54:43] word and to believe and Obey it yes amen
[54:46] so brothers and sisters manifestations
[54:48] versus the word don't worry about
[54:51] manifestations all that will come all
[54:53] that has to come because that's the word
[54:55] of God have you noticed in Revelations
[54:57] 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say
[55:00] come and let him that heareth say come
[55:02] see the bride speaks the same word as
[55:06] does the spirit she is a word bride
[55:09] proving she has the
[55:11] spirit I don't know if brother Bram says
[55:14] it in here but she is a virgin to the
[55:17] word in every Church age we hear these
[55:20] words he that hath an ear let him hear
[55:21] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[55:23] the spirit gives the word if if you have
[55:26] the spirit you will hear the word for
[55:29] your age as those true Christians took
[55:33] the word for their age now again people
[55:35] will say well that's pretty easy to say
[55:38] they'll they'll they'll say that because
[55:40] they're they're going to say that
[55:41] William Mary and Brown's a prophet
[55:42] whatever he said means that he actually
[55:45] was the word he wasn't the word he was
[55:48] the mouthpiece for the word and if you
[55:51] listen to what the words were that came
[55:52] out of his mouth they pointed back to
[55:55] the word they didn't actually put a new
[55:57] word in there there was no
[55:59] interpretation to the word it was an
[56:01] explanation on the word it was right
[56:04] back to the word he says did you get
[56:06] that last thought I repeat every Church
[56:09] age ends with the same admonition he
[56:11] that hath an ear let him an individual
[56:14] hear the spirit saith to the churches
[56:16] the spirit gives the word he has the
[56:18] truth for each age each age has had its
[56:22] own elect and that elect group all
[56:26] always heard the word and received it
[56:29] proving they had the seed in them not
[56:32] everyone can hear this word not everyone
[56:34] can say God set a prophet and that he
[56:37] actually happened in our generation but
[56:40] I just keep saying to people who claim
[56:42] to believe that Jesus Christ is the same
[56:44] yesterday today and forever if God were
[56:47] to send a prophet to planet Earth would
[56:49] you not want to hear the words he
[56:52] said right if you believe in Jesus
[56:55] Christ my
[56:57] goodness but Satan the most religious
[57:00] one of all he don't want nobody hearing
[57:02] that God sent a prophet cuz if you hear
[57:04] this word that the prophet brought if
[57:06] you have an ear to hear then you're
[57:08] going to get Liberty from Satan you'll
[57:10] get power over Satan you will be an
[57:12] overcomer to this age Satan will become
[57:15] powerless before you and he don't want
[57:17] no part of that he wants to keep
[57:19] everyone right where they're at John
[57:22] 8:47 and he that is of god heareth god
[57:26] God's
[57:27] words remember not word but words yes if
[57:32] ye abide in me and my words abide in you
[57:37] ask what you will brothers and sisters
[57:39] ye therefore hear them not because ye
[57:41] are not of God they refus the word
[57:47] Jesus they refus the word Jesus and his
[57:52] words for their days but the true seed
[57:56] received the word because they were of
[57:59] God Isaiah 54:13 and all thy children
[58:03] shall be taught of God Holy Spirit
[58:08] my Jesus said the same thing in John
[58:11] 6:45 being one with the word proves
[58:14] whether you are of God and spirit filled
[58:18] no other
[58:20] criterian doesn't matter how much
[58:23] theology we've got it doesn't matter how
[58:26] far back our lineage goes in the message
[58:29] it doesn't matter how long we've
[58:31] attended a church it doesn't matter how
[58:34] much we do for the church it doesn't
[58:36] matter how much we tithe to the church
[58:39] it doesn't matter any of that there's no
[58:41] other Criterion there's only one and
[58:45] that's being one with the word but the
[58:47] beautiful part is when you're one with
[58:49] the word you will tithe you will have
[58:51] church attendance you will put your
[58:53] shoulder to the wheel you will not try
[58:56] and make excuses for what the spirit
[58:58] said to the church through the prophet
[59:00] for our
[59:01] age you just won't and you know I'll say
[59:04] it this way it's pretty blunt and and
[59:06] strong but if you actually act
[59:08] differently than what the prophet
[59:10] brought then I say you don't believe the
[59:13] prophet
[59:15] right it's one or the other brothers and
[59:17] sisters many people want to say it's
[59:19] many different colors it's Shades of
[59:21] Gray it's no shade of gray it's black or
[59:24] it's white it's right or it's wrong it's
[59:27] God's word or it's not word it is amen
[59:31] Jesus said the same thing in John 645
[59:34] being one with the word proves whether
[59:37] you are of God and spirit filled no
[59:40] other Criterion I love how brother bam
[59:42] says it not here but somewhere that you
[59:44] can be Spirit-filled but maybe not the
[59:46] Holy
[59:48] Spirit my right yes but what are tongues
[59:52] and interpretation and other gifts they
[59:54] are manifestation
[59:57] that is what the word teaches read it is
[59:59] read it in 1 Corinthians 12:7 but the
[1:00:03] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[1:00:05] every man to profit with
[1:00:09] all then Paul names those
[1:00:12] manifestations now comes this very good
[1:00:15] question this is where we left off last
[1:00:16] week this is where it's going to get
[1:00:17] real good we're going to we're going to
[1:00:19] this is going to get good buckle up
[1:00:21] brothers and sisters now comes this very
[1:00:24] good question I know that you are
[1:00:26] anxious to ask why isn't the
[1:00:28] manifestation an Evidence of being
[1:00:30] baptized with the Holy Ghost because you
[1:00:32] surely could not manifest the Holy Ghost
[1:00:35] unless you were truly Spirit-filled
[1:00:39] he says now I wish I could say that is
[1:00:42] right because I don't like to hurt
[1:00:43] people or walk on their Doctrine but I
[1:00:46] wouldn't be a true servant of God if I
[1:00:48] didn't tell you the whole counsel of God
[1:00:52] that is right is it not amen
[1:00:56] just let us take a little look at balum
[1:01:00] he was religious he worshiped God he
[1:01:04] understood the proper method of
[1:01:07] sacrificing and approaching unto God but
[1:01:11] he was not a true seed Prophet for he
[1:01:15] took the wages of
[1:01:17] unrighteousness and worst of all he led
[1:01:20] the people of God into sins of
[1:01:22] fornication and idolatry
[1:01:27] yet who would
[1:01:28] dare
[1:01:30] deny that the spirit of God manifested
[1:01:33] through him in one of the most beautiful
[1:01:36] portions of absolutely accurate prophecy
[1:01:40] the world has ever
[1:01:42] seen
[1:01:44] why but he never had the Holy
[1:01:47] Ghost now some people would say well
[1:01:49] brother Barry the Holy Ghost wasn't yet
[1:01:51] given what was what was the Holy Ghost
[1:01:53] then what is the Holy Ghost now it's God
[1:01:57] Amen it's the spirit of the Living God
[1:02:00] Amen that's right it's Jesus Christ the
[1:02:03] same yesterday today and forever it's
[1:02:04] not a different person that's where the
[1:02:06] denominational world gets in that's
[1:02:08] where Satan gets in that's where the
[1:02:09] devil is in the details where you try
[1:02:11] and detail it out and say well it's
[1:02:13] three distinct persons in the
[1:02:16] Trinity it's a lie of the devil amen you
[1:02:19] can't Chop God into three pieces and
[1:02:22] give him to a a seed Gene of God doesn't
[1:02:25] work that way
[1:02:27] but he never had the Holy
[1:02:29] Ghost now then what do you think of
[1:02:32] Caiaphas the high
[1:02:34] priest the Bible says that he prophesied
[1:02:37] the kind of death the Lord should die
[1:02:41] and we all know that's true we'd say
[1:02:43] Amen to that we know it's truth we all
[1:02:45] know there's no record of him being a
[1:02:47] Spirit-filled and spirit-led man like
[1:02:50] dear old Simeon see this is what I think
[1:02:53] is beautiful because he goes back and he
[1:02:54] says there's people that have
[1:02:56] manifestations that didn't have the Holy
[1:02:58] Spirit but then there's other people
[1:03:00] that had the
[1:03:02] spirit yes before the Holy Spirit was
[1:03:04] given
[1:03:06] though we all know there's no record of
[1:03:08] him being spirit filled and spirit-led
[1:03:10] man like dear old Simeon or that sweet
[1:03:12] saint called Anna yet he had a genuine
[1:03:16] manifestation of the Holy
[1:03:21] Ghost this is where it gets really
[1:03:23] really tough it can
[1:03:26] it can get really confusing and it does
[1:03:30] but it doesn't need to go and listen to
[1:03:33] anointed ones at the end time and see
[1:03:35] what brother bradam says about it but
[1:03:37] we'll get into it Lord willing so good
[1:03:40] here we can't deny that he says so where
[1:03:43] is manifestation as an Evidence it isn't
[1:03:46] there manifestation is not an Evidence
[1:03:49] brothers and sisters don't look for
[1:03:50] manifestation in your life and brother
[1:03:53] Bram he said it earlier on in the church
[1:03:55] age book a
[1:03:56] with manifestation as the plum line get
[1:03:58] back to the
[1:04:00] word if you are truly filled with the
[1:04:03] spirit of God you will have the evidence
[1:04:07] of the manifestation in your
[1:04:10] life no you'll have the evidence of the
[1:04:15] word in your
[1:04:17] life that's the evidence Brothers and
[1:04:20] Sisters Let's show you how deeply I feel
[1:04:24] and understand this truth by a
[1:04:26] revelation God gave me now before I tell
[1:04:29] it I want to say this many of you people
[1:04:31] believe me to be a prophet I don't say
[1:04:33] that I am you said it but we both know
[1:04:37] that visions that the visions that God
[1:04:40] gives me never fail not once if anyone
[1:04:44] can prove a vision ever failed I want to
[1:04:47] know about it now you now that you
[1:04:50] follow me this far here is my story and
[1:04:54] we're all very familiar with this
[1:04:56] story many years ago when I first came
[1:04:59] across the Pentecostal people I was in
[1:05:02] one of their camp meetings where there
[1:05:03] was much manifestations of tongues
[1:05:05] interpretation of tongues and prophecy
[1:05:08] two preachers in particular were engaged
[1:05:10] in this kind of speaking more than any
[1:05:12] of the other Brethren has anybody ever
[1:05:15] been to a service like that this is just
[1:05:17] brother Barry asking that has anybody
[1:05:19] ever seen that where people are
[1:05:21] prophesying they're speaking in tongues
[1:05:23] and other people are interpreting this
[1:05:24] is a very real and it happens I I was a
[1:05:27] kid in in the Pentecostal Assembly and I
[1:05:29] remember seeing it happen but I would
[1:05:32] see it in in such a way someone would
[1:05:34] would would would speak in tongues and a
[1:05:36] woman in a in a tight leather miniskirt
[1:05:39] wearing high heels and earrings with cut
[1:05:42] hair would give an
[1:05:43] interpretation and my could she ever
[1:05:47] yell anyways brother bam says two
[1:05:50] preachers in particular were engaged in
[1:05:51] this kind of speaking more than any
[1:05:53] other other Brethren I thoroughly
[1:05:55] enjoyed this services and was truly
[1:05:56] interested in the Visions sorry in the
[1:05:59] various manifestations for they had a
[1:06:02] ring of reality to them it was my
[1:06:04] Earnest desire to learn all that I could
[1:06:06] about these gifts so I decided to talk
[1:06:09] to the two men about them through the
[1:06:11] gift of God resident in me I sought to
[1:06:14] know the spirit in the first man whether
[1:06:18] he was truly of God or not isn't that
[1:06:20] interesting that he would really wonder
[1:06:22] whether he was of God or not after a
[1:06:24] brief conversation with that sweet
[1:06:26] humble brother I knew that he was a
[1:06:28] genuine solid Christian he was real the
[1:06:33] next young man was not at all like the
[1:06:35] first one he was boastful and proud and
[1:06:39] you know that's usually one of the first
[1:06:42] indicators I would say as well you see
[1:06:44] it in people and as I spoke to him a
[1:06:47] vision moved across my eyes and I saw
[1:06:50] that he was married to a blonde lady but
[1:06:52] was living with a brunette and had two
[1:06:54] children by her if ever there was a
[1:06:58] hypocrite he was
[1:07:01] one now let me tell you I was shocked
[1:07:04] how could I not be here were two men one
[1:07:08] of which was a real brother and the
[1:07:11] other was a sinful
[1:07:14] impersonator yet both were manifesting
[1:07:18] gifts of the Spirit
[1:07:21] right I was
[1:07:23] troubled by this confusion I left the
[1:07:25] meeting to seek God for the answer I
[1:07:28] went alone to a secret place and there
[1:07:30] with my Bible I prayed and waited on God
[1:07:32] for the answer I say help us Lord to
[1:07:36] pray and just wait on you for the answer
[1:07:40] not knowing just what portion of the
[1:07:42] scripture to read I casually opened the
[1:07:44] Bible to some place in Matthew I read
[1:07:46] for a while then laid the Bible down in
[1:07:49] a moment a wind blew into the room and
[1:07:51] turned the pages of the Bible to Hebrews
[1:07:54] chapter 6 I read it through and was
[1:07:57] particularly impressed by those strange
[1:08:01] verses Hebrews 6:4 to9 we went over this
[1:08:04] recently for it is impossible for those
[1:08:06] who were once enlightened and have
[1:08:08] tasted of the Heavenly gift and were
[1:08:10] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[1:08:13] have tasted the good word of God and the
[1:08:16] powers of the world to come if they
[1:08:19] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[1:08:22] repentance seeing they crucify to
[1:08:24] themselves the son of God aresh and put
[1:08:26] him to an open shame for the Earth which
[1:08:29] drinketh in the rain that cometh of upon
[1:08:33] it and bringeth forth herbs meat for
[1:08:35] them by whom it is dressed receiveth
[1:08:38] blessing from God but that which beareth
[1:08:41] thorns and Briars is rejected and is
[1:08:45] nigh unto cursing whose end is to be
[1:08:48] burned but beloved we are persuaded
[1:08:51] better things of you and things that
[1:08:54] accompany salvation
[1:08:56] though we thus speak now remember when
[1:08:59] we talked about this when we studied
[1:09:00] this a little while ago we came to the
[1:09:03] conclusion that brother Bram simply said
[1:09:05] that there's people that come all the
[1:09:07] way up to the promised land they'll even
[1:09:09] taste of the Heavenly gifts they'll
[1:09:12] Taste of the figs just like the children
[1:09:13] of Israel when the spies went across
[1:09:16] they brought the figs the pomegranates
[1:09:18] the honey the milk grapes clusters that
[1:09:21] took two men to carry they had all of
[1:09:23] the fruits and they tasted of them
[1:09:26] but they simply refused to say that we
[1:09:28] can take it because God said so because
[1:09:31] God's word said so God's word through
[1:09:34] the Vindicated Prophet said
[1:09:37] so they refused to go on and actually
[1:09:41] partake of that Heavenly gift so what
[1:09:44] brother bradam brought out was what this
[1:09:45] verse is saying is there's people that
[1:09:47] will go all the way up to the true
[1:09:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost but they'll
[1:09:50] never ever get the true baptism of the
[1:09:52] Holy Ghost they'll live under an
[1:09:54] anointing of the Holy Ghost but they'll
[1:09:56] never go all the way into the promised
[1:09:59] land I'll just go on to read instead of
[1:10:01] preaching sorry H I closed the Bible
[1:10:05] laid it down and meditated a while and
[1:10:06] prayed some more still had no answer I
[1:10:10] again opened the Bible
[1:10:12] aimlessly but did not read suddenly the
[1:10:15] wind blew in the room again and once
[1:10:16] more the pages turned to Hebrews 6 and
[1:10:19] remained there as the wind
[1:10:21] ceased I read those words over again and
[1:10:24] when I did
[1:10:26] did then came the spirit of God into the
[1:10:28] room and I beheld a vision I saw in the
[1:10:32] vision a man dressed in the purest white
[1:10:35] who went forth into a freshly plowed
[1:10:37] field and sewed grain it was a bright
[1:10:40] day and the sewing was done in the
[1:10:42] morning but late at night after the
[1:10:45] sewer in White had gone a man in Black
[1:10:48] came and stealthily sowed some more seed
[1:10:52] amongst that which the man in White had
[1:10:56] sown yeah these days went by the Sun and
[1:10:59] Rain blessed the ground and one day
[1:11:02] there appeared the grain how fine it was
[1:11:07] remember you can never have an
[1:11:09] impersonation until you have the
[1:11:11] original there's never a counterfeit
[1:11:13] before the
[1:11:15] truth but a day later appeared the tears
[1:11:19] the wheat and the tears grew together
[1:11:22] they partook of the same nourishment out
[1:11:24] of the same soil they drank in the same
[1:11:28] sun and Rain then one day the skies
[1:11:31] turned to
[1:11:33] brass and the plants all began to droop
[1:11:35] and
[1:11:36] die I heard the wheat lift up their
[1:11:39] heads and cry to God for rain the tears
[1:11:42] also lifted up their voices and pleaded
[1:11:44] for rain then the skies darkened and the
[1:11:47] rain came and again the wheat now full
[1:11:50] of strength lifted up their voices and
[1:11:53] cried in adoration praise the Lord
[1:11:56] Lord now we have brother bradam the
[1:11:58] prophet saying and to my wonderment I
[1:12:01] heard the revived tears also look up and
[1:12:04] say
[1:12:07] hallelujah then I knew the truth of the
[1:12:09] camp meeting and the vision the parable
[1:12:11] of the sewer and the seed the sixth
[1:12:13] chapter of Hebrews and the evident
[1:12:15] manifestation of spiritual gifts in a
[1:12:17] mixed audience it all became wonderfully
[1:12:20] clear the swer in white was the Lord the
[1:12:23] sewer in Black was the devil
[1:12:25] the word was the field the seeds were
[1:12:27] the people elect and
[1:12:31] reprobates both partook of the same
[1:12:34] nourishment sun and water water and Sun
[1:12:37] both prayed both received help from God
[1:12:41] for he maketh his son and Reign to fall
[1:12:45] on both good and evil just made me think
[1:12:47] when I was going through this Cain and
[1:12:49] Abel exact same thing they're both
[1:12:52] raised in a church both of the parents
[1:12:55] were Believers backslid Believers but
[1:12:58] both of them took them to church but one
[1:13:00] of them was not a reprobate one of them
[1:13:03] was elected and the other one was
[1:13:07] reprobate brother Bram he goes on to say
[1:13:09] and though they both had the same
[1:13:11] wonderful blessing and both had the same
[1:13:14] wonderful
[1:13:16] manifestations there was still that one
[1:13:19] great
[1:13:21] difference they were of different seed
[1:13:27] here also was the answer to Matthew 7:
[1:13:32] 21-23 not everyone that saith unto me
[1:13:35] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[1:13:37] of heaven but he that doeth the will of
[1:13:40] My Father which is in heaven many will
[1:13:43] say to me in that day Lord Lord have we
[1:13:47] not prophesied in thy name and in thy
[1:13:50] name have cast out devils and in thy
[1:13:54] name
[1:13:55] have done many wonderful
[1:13:58] works I'm emphasizing the name because
[1:14:02] we know that he esteems his word above
[1:14:05] his name we know that that's the
[1:14:08] word and Jesus will say unto them and
[1:14:12] then I will profess unto them I never
[1:14:14] knew you depart from me ye that work
[1:14:18] iniquity and I just have that I never
[1:14:20] knew you highlighted and I just wanted
[1:14:22] to mention that brothers and sisters
[1:14:24] it's not as though he actually had an
[1:14:27] introduction this is Brother Benjamin
[1:14:30] Johnson and and and I'm God the father
[1:14:33] and and we've had an introduction it's
[1:14:36] not that at all it's about an intimate
[1:14:39] relationship right it's about intimacy
[1:14:41] it's about the twain becoming
[1:14:44] one I never even knew you coming all the
[1:14:48] way up to meeting of the bridegroom and
[1:14:51] saying no no no no no I don't want to go
[1:14:53] that far I like where I'm at I want to
[1:14:55] stay where I'm at I don't want to lose
[1:14:57] control I don't want to be a Holy Roller
[1:14:58] I don't want people to look at me on and
[1:15:00] on and on all the excuses come out I
[1:15:03] never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:15:06] work
[1:15:08] iniquity ye that do the things you know
[1:15:11] you shouldn't do and don't do the things
[1:15:13] that you should I say Lord help me
[1:15:17] amen Jesus does not deny that they did
[1:15:20] the mighty works that only the Holy
[1:15:22] Ghost can accomplish by the way of men
[1:15:25] right but he did deny ever knowing them
[1:15:30] my he says it these weren't
[1:15:34] backsliders these were Wicked
[1:15:38] unregenerate
[1:15:41] reprobates these were the seed of Satan
[1:15:44] right you see where I get Cain and Abel
[1:15:48] in this in this discussion in this
[1:15:50] equation Cain was of his father the
[1:15:53] devil he was of the wicked one Abel was
[1:15:57] a Son of
[1:15:59] God brother Bram goes on to say and
[1:16:01] there it is you can't claim that
[1:16:04] manifestation is the evidence of being
[1:16:06] Spirit born spirit filled right no sir I
[1:16:11] will admit that true
[1:16:13] manifestation is the evidence of the
[1:16:16] Holy Spirit doing Mighty acts but it is
[1:16:19] not the evidence of the individual being
[1:16:22] Spirit-filled
[1:16:23] right I believe this is real important
[1:16:27] and I'm just going to maybe slow down
[1:16:28] here and just hover a little bit
[1:16:30] brothers and sisters because there's a
[1:16:32] real push on right now in and around the
[1:16:34] message of the hour to get back to
[1:16:36] Pentecost we've got to see the signs and
[1:16:38] wonders no we don't we've got to see the
[1:16:41] word Amen brother bradam says it I think
[1:16:44] it's coming right up here he says I
[1:16:45] wonder if we are sufficiently impressed
[1:16:49] with the
[1:16:52] word are we amen
[1:16:56] Amen in this scripture here jesuses does
[1:16:59] not deny that they did the mighty works
[1:17:01] yeah you cast out Devils yep you surely
[1:17:04] did and and and done many wonderful
[1:17:08] Works my but it's not the evidence of
[1:17:11] the individual being Spirit-filled even
[1:17:14] though that individual has an abundance
[1:17:17] of those
[1:17:18] manifestations the evidence of receiving
[1:17:21] the Holy Ghost today is just the same as
[1:17:24] it was
[1:17:25] back in the day of Our Lord it is
[1:17:28] receiving the word of Truth for the day
[1:17:30] in which you
[1:17:32] live how are we going to receive the
[1:17:34] word of Truth in the day in which we
[1:17:38] live God has to send a
[1:17:42] prophet Jesus never did stress the
[1:17:44] importance of the works as he did the
[1:17:47] word he knew that if the people got the
[1:17:51] word The Works would follow that's the
[1:17:54] Bible amen
[1:17:55] I remember when I first started coming
[1:17:57] to church I I I I thought why why does
[1:18:00] brother Ken always preach such a
[1:18:03] mysterious message it's always so strong
[1:18:06] it's strong meat I I need something a
[1:18:09] little easier on on my soul something
[1:18:12] that I could comprehend maybe and
[1:18:14] understand but it wasn't until a little
[1:18:16] while down the road feeding on solid
[1:18:20] food that I began to understand that
[1:18:22] that true seed can only feed seed on
[1:18:25] True Word it has to be strong meat
[1:18:29] that's going to allow the seed to
[1:18:34] grow we could just feed
[1:18:37] pum and
[1:18:40] formula but there comes a point in time
[1:18:42] where we've got to be weaned brothers
[1:18:43] and sisters and we've got to be able to
[1:18:45] actually go into strong meat we've got
[1:18:47] to be willing to actually go into strong
[1:18:49] meat and I'm not talking about strong
[1:18:51] meat saying that I understand that
[1:18:52] there's Seven Seals and all Seven Seals
[1:18:54] are opened and all the Mysteries and all
[1:18:56] of the all of the message Doctrine I'm
[1:18:59] not saying that that is the evidence
[1:19:01] either because that's
[1:19:03] not understanding is not receiving
[1:19:07] is receiving the word of God is now I'm
[1:19:10] not saying that the message of the hour
[1:19:12] isn't but what I am saying is it's not a
[1:19:15] study it's not Theology and it can very
[1:19:18] easily turn into that and become head
[1:19:20] knowledge and we can know every quote we
[1:19:22] can know all the history we can know all
[1:19:24] about it
[1:19:25] it but do we have the word in our heart
[1:19:28] H have we hid Thy word have I hid in my
[1:19:32] heart that I might not sin against thee
[1:19:34] it's not because I'm going to trip and
[1:19:35] fall it's that I'm actually going to
[1:19:38] believe I'm not going to have an ounce
[1:19:41] of unbelief in
[1:19:44] me because what is
[1:19:47] sin it's
[1:19:49] unbelief it's not falling down tomorrow
[1:19:51] when we go about our job and we do that
[1:19:53] thing that thing happens and and we feel
[1:19:55] like we've fallen down and we've sinned
[1:19:57] again and we've done this thing whatever
[1:19:59] that is brothers and sisters we're going
[1:20:01] to contend with this flesh until we have
[1:20:04] a body change we're going to have
[1:20:06] thoughts of temptation but those
[1:20:07] thoughts aren't ours we were talking
[1:20:09] about that yesterday those thoughts are
[1:20:11] not ours they're the devil's thoughts
[1:20:12] and we need to recognize that when those
[1:20:14] thoughts come our way and give them back
[1:20:15] to the devil say these thoughts are
[1:20:17] yours and you're going to burn because
[1:20:19] of them but they're not my thoughts and
[1:20:20] they're not God's thoughts so we just
[1:20:23] just rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[1:20:24] Christ begone for me and that's where
[1:20:27] Satan is going to have no power when we
[1:20:29] begin to recognize him anything contrary
[1:20:33] to the word is the
[1:20:37] devil even though that individual has an
[1:20:39] abundance of those manifestations the
[1:20:41] evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:20:42] today is the same as it was way back in
[1:20:44] the day of Our Lord it is receiving the
[1:20:46] word of Truth for the day in which you
[1:20:47] live Jesus never did stress the
[1:20:49] importance of the works as he did the
[1:20:52] word he knew that if the people got the
[1:20:54] the word The Works would follow that's
[1:20:56] the Bible now Jesus knew that there was
[1:20:59] going to be a terrible drift away from
[1:21:01] the word in the pergami and age which
[1:21:04] was at yet as yet 200 years off from the
[1:21:09] patmas vision not very far 200 years
[1:21:12] really when you look back it is a ways
[1:21:15] but he knew that drift would cause them
[1:21:19] to go into the Dark Ages he knew that
[1:21:22] the way man originally got away from God
[1:21:25] was by first leaving the
[1:21:27] word brothers and sisters this is where
[1:21:30] it gets really Pinchy really Pinchy
[1:21:34] because what is the message of the hour
[1:21:37] it really is the word of God to this age
[1:21:40] if you leave the word you have left God
[1:21:43] that's right you take one word out
[1:21:46] you've left God that's right you say
[1:21:48] that I can take most of the message of
[1:21:50] the hour but I just can't take that part
[1:21:53] you've left God
[1:21:55] amen thus he is presenting himself to
[1:21:58] the church at pergamus and indeed to all
[1:22:02] churches of all ages I am the word oh
[1:22:06] it's so beautiful isn't it if you want
[1:22:08] deity in your midst then what then
[1:22:11] welcome and receive the
[1:22:14] word and this is where it gets so
[1:22:16] critical brothers and sisters many times
[1:22:19] we can have someone on our feet and oh
[1:22:22] my I'm not going back to church now or
[1:22:24] I'm not here and preach what I want to
[1:22:26] hear preached or or or or or or or or or
[1:22:29] the prophet said God said through the
[1:22:31] prophet to this church age don't ever
[1:22:34] let anyone or anything get between you
[1:22:38] and the
[1:22:42] word understand it's God's
[1:22:45] work he's either in complete control or
[1:22:48] he's not true and you know what I want
[1:22:51] to say this brothers and sisters loud
[1:22:52] and clear I I think that we've seen if
[1:22:54] you want more from the pulpit just do
[1:22:57] what you did last Sunday amen just pray
[1:23:00] for brother Barry just do that and see
[1:23:02] if God won't actually give you a
[1:23:04] blessing see if he won't actually get me
[1:23:06] to actually step out of the way and he
[1:23:08] will just preach whatever it is you have
[1:23:10] need of because he will he will use a
[1:23:12] donkey to speak his word if he has
[1:23:16] to don't think that you oh my this or
[1:23:19] that or the other thing just just keep
[1:23:22] the word in your heart amen don't ever
[1:23:24] let anyone or anything get between you
[1:23:27] and that word the devil just wants to
[1:23:29] get us so upset and say well I just
[1:23:32] can't I can't worship today because I
[1:23:33] don't like the speed of that song and
[1:23:35] they've got that stupid drum here and
[1:23:37] it's just contrary to the way I believe
[1:23:40] it as soon as we start doing that you're
[1:23:42] letting something get between you and
[1:23:44] the word because he said hey if you
[1:23:47] won't worship me then immediately the C
[1:23:49] rocks will cry
[1:23:51] out you know what don't let any anything
[1:23:55] or anyone get between you and that
[1:23:59] word this which I am giving you the word
[1:24:03] is a revelation of myself I am the word
[1:24:06] remember that now some might say well
[1:24:09] that was brother bradam blasphemia
[1:24:11] saying I am the word who is speaking
[1:24:14] here who is speaking
[1:24:16] here and this is the very next one I
[1:24:18] wonder if we are sufficiently impressed
[1:24:20] with the word in our midst you know what
[1:24:21] when we let little things get in our way
[1:24:22] when we let little things get in US all
[1:24:24] upset and in a fit and and and this and
[1:24:26] that and the other thing brothers and
[1:24:27] sisters I think that the word isn't
[1:24:29] fully impressed on us we're not
[1:24:31] sufficiently impressed with that word
[1:24:33] because if we were we would just look
[1:24:35] past all of that and we would just be
[1:24:37] like that kid riding the Schwin bicycle
[1:24:39] I'm looking at the end I'm not looking
[1:24:40] at all this distraction right here you
[1:24:42] know I've heard people say did you see
[1:24:44] the children in the front row and how
[1:24:45] they were acting out and I say no I
[1:24:48] don't because I'm not looking right here
[1:24:51] I'm looking out here amen it doesn't
[1:24:53] affect me
[1:24:56] but I wonder if we're sufficiently
[1:24:57] impressed with the word in our
[1:25:00] midst I love that some might say well
[1:25:04] where's our midst I want to say wherever
[1:25:07] two or three are gathered in his name
[1:25:10] that's our midst brothers and sisters
[1:25:13] and and I've said it before and I just
[1:25:15] as as we get closer and closer I just
[1:25:17] can't help but think it's just more and
[1:25:19] more and more uh real to me that if you
[1:25:22] want to see the Rapture just look around
[1:25:25] this is it brothers and sisters there
[1:25:27] isn't going to be a great fantastic
[1:25:29] there's not going to be a bunch of
[1:25:30] different people it's going to be us and
[1:25:33] we're going to just continue to March
[1:25:35] forward in this word and say blessed be
[1:25:38] the name of the Lord I'm just going to
[1:25:40] keep that word in front of me and I'm
[1:25:41] going to make it to that end and one day
[1:25:43] brothers and sisters we're going to
[1:25:45] gather together and we're going to spend
[1:25:47] some time praising the Lord that we've
[1:25:49] made it and he's going to give us that
[1:25:50] space of time where we can go and greet
[1:25:53] every single human being that we've ever
[1:25:55] met or heard about and get it out of our
[1:25:57] system and then we'll go on to the
[1:26:00] marriage supper of the lb but first
[1:26:01] we're going to meet everyone in the
[1:26:03] clouds my goodness it's coming just I I
[1:26:06] pray that we would be sufficiently
[1:26:08] impressed with the word in our midst
[1:26:10] right here in in this church in Calgary
[1:26:12] Living Word he says let me give you a
[1:26:14] thought here how do we pray pray in
[1:26:16] jesus' name name don't we every prayer
[1:26:19] is in his name or there isn't any answer
[1:26:23] yet in first John 5 we are told this is
[1:26:25] the confidence that we have in him that
[1:26:27] if we ask anything according to his will
[1:26:31] he heareth us and if we know that he
[1:26:34] heareth us whatsoever we ask we know
[1:26:38] that we have the petitions that we have
[1:26:41] desired of
[1:26:45] him here we go you buckled in now we ask
[1:26:51] what is the will of God there is only
[1:26:53] one way to know his will and that is by
[1:26:56] the word of God Lamentations 3:37 who is
[1:27:01] he that saith and it cometh to pass when
[1:27:05] the Lord commandeth it not there it is
[1:27:09] if it isn't in the word you can't have
[1:27:13] it and brothers and sisters I think it
[1:27:15] goes even further than that if it's not
[1:27:17] in the word what do we do we want
[1:27:20] it we don't want it but this world is
[1:27:23] set up for us to want it that's why
[1:27:26] we've got to know the word because the
[1:27:27] word is his perfect
[1:27:30] will there it is if it is it in the word
[1:27:32] you can't have it so we can't ask unless
[1:27:35] it's in the word and we can't petition
[1:27:38] or ask unless it's in his name but
[1:27:40] brothers and sisters oh my when you ask
[1:27:43] according to the word in his name ask
[1:27:48] what you
[1:27:50] will there it is again Jesus the name is
[1:27:54] is the word will you can't separate God
[1:27:57] and the word they are
[1:28:00] one now then this word he has left
[1:28:04] behind on the printed page is a part of
[1:28:07] him when you accept it by faith into a
[1:28:10] Spirit-filled
[1:28:12] life he said that his word was life John
[1:28:17] 663b but that is exactly what he is I am
[1:28:20] the way the truth and the life John 14:6
[1:28:24] If any man have not the spirit of Christ
[1:28:26] he is none of his Romans
[1:28:29] 89b there it is he is spirit and he is
[1:28:33] life that is exactly what the word is
[1:28:37] that is exactly what Jesus is he is the
[1:28:43] word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled
[1:28:46] man in faith takes that word into his
[1:28:51] heart and places it upon his
[1:28:56] lips why that is the same as deity
[1:28:59] [Music]
[1:29:02] speaking
[1:29:04] amen that's why Satan hates
[1:29:07] this that's why Satan doesn't want
[1:29:09] people to actually go and get baptized
[1:29:11] re-baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:29:13] Jesus Christ for the remission of their
[1:29:15] sins they want to say well I just want
[1:29:16] to follow Jesus and be baptized in the
[1:29:18] name of the father and the name of the
[1:29:20] son and the name of the Holy Ghost well
[1:29:21] if you believe in Jesus Jesus is is the
[1:29:24] word and if none of his disciples
[1:29:26] baptized in the name of the father and
[1:29:28] of the son of the Holy Ghost and they
[1:29:30] only baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:29:32] Jesus Christ why would you not want to
[1:29:34] follow what the disciples
[1:29:36] did but when you do I just love this
[1:29:40] when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in
[1:29:44] faith by believing this word yes takes
[1:29:47] that word into his heart and places it
[1:29:50] upon his lips why that is the same as
[1:29:52] deity speaking
[1:29:55] I think we've talked about it in the
[1:29:56] past you know what we need to do
[1:29:57] brothers and sisters and and I say Lord
[1:30:00] help me when I talk like this I've
[1:30:02] experienced it full well we don't need
[1:30:04] to pray that God would actually change
[1:30:07] the circumstances to change his word to
[1:30:10] change his will to suit me we need to
[1:30:12] pray that our minds would change to
[1:30:15] match his word to match his will to be
[1:30:18] able to endure the circumstances he's
[1:30:20] allowed us to get into the circumstances
[1:30:22] that we're in for a purpose so that
[1:30:25] we'll come to the recognition that he is
[1:30:27] God and he's our healer and he's our
[1:30:29] provider and he's our shelter on and on
[1:30:32] we go every Mountain has to
[1:30:35] go Satan cannot stand before that man do
[1:30:39] you want to be that man tonight I want
[1:30:41] to say brothers and sisters you
[1:30:43] are now the sisters aren't but do you
[1:30:47] want to be that person tonight right put
[1:30:50] his word above everything in your life
[1:30:53] and when you do that when you're born of
[1:30:55] his Spirit brothers and sisters you're
[1:30:56] going to speak words you don't even know
[1:30:58] that you're
[1:30:59] speaking and Satan will not be able to
[1:31:01] stand it so what will he do he'll flee
[1:31:03] he won't even know what to do with you
[1:31:04] he won't want nothing to do with
[1:31:07] you if the church way back there in that
[1:31:10] third age had only held on to the
[1:31:12] revelation of the Living Word in their
[1:31:14] midst the power of God would not have
[1:31:16] faded as it did in those dark ages and
[1:31:19] right today when the church returns to
[1:31:22] the word in
[1:31:24] faith we can say without doubt that the
[1:31:28] glory of God and the wonderful acts of
[1:31:31] God will be in her midst
[1:31:35] [Music]
[1:31:36] again and you
[1:31:38] know I just oh my I set myself up to
[1:31:43] preach tonight and I don't I don't want
[1:31:44] to do that I just got so excited getting
[1:31:46] into
[1:31:48] this
[1:31:51] hallelujah oh my I just think it's
[1:31:54] beautiful because the word always points
[1:31:55] to the word doesn't it
[1:31:59] right just I was thinking about this I'm
[1:32:02] not going to preach it I just want to
[1:32:03] say it just like we're reading tonight
[1:32:05] you know in John 15:7 if ye abide in me
[1:32:08] and my words abide in
[1:32:10] you you shall ask what you will and it
[1:32:12] shall be done unto you how how I want to
[1:32:16] say this how will his words abide in you
[1:32:21] because we know that his Bible the word
[1:32:23] word of God is sharper than any
[1:32:26] two-edged sword it's one thing but what
[1:32:29] I want to point out tonight I believe
[1:32:30] this is what the Lord was showing me and
[1:32:32] I really want to preach on this I just I
[1:32:34] I it gets me excited to think about
[1:32:36] because he says and my words if you
[1:32:38] abide in me and my
[1:32:40] words abide in you how will you have his
[1:32:43] words brothers and sisters how could you
[1:32:45] possibly have his words maybe you've
[1:32:47] read the Bible but you know I just want
[1:32:49] to encourage you to
[1:32:51] remember Philippians chapter 2
[1:32:54] let this mind be in you it's not even
[1:32:58] you it's not even me it's not us
[1:33:00] brothers and sisters it's the spirit of
[1:33:02] Christ let this mind be in you which was
[1:33:05] also in Christ Jesus how could we do
[1:33:09] that many people now will say well now
[1:33:11] there you go and make yourself God no I
[1:33:12] don't make myself God God makes me
[1:33:16] God people say oh no that's heresy how
[1:33:20] could you ever say that whose spirit is
[1:33:22] it that we want to have living in us
[1:33:26] hallelujah but this world is taught that
[1:33:28] you can just be fluid you can have this
[1:33:30] and that and the other and we could go
[1:33:32] down a long road with that but I don't
[1:33:33] want to do that I want to esteem the
[1:33:34] word greater than any discussion tonight
[1:33:37] and you know brothers and sisters let
[1:33:38] that mind be in you and then when you
[1:33:40] start to ask you don't have to worry
[1:33:42] about what you're going to ask you're
[1:33:43] not going to ask and Miss because you're
[1:33:45] not going to be asking upon the lust of
[1:33:47] your flesh the lust of your eyes or the
[1:33:49] pride of life you're not going to be
[1:33:50] asking on any of that you're going to be
[1:33:52] asking according to the word of God then
[1:33:53] you're obligating God to honor your
[1:33:56] prayer because he says here in the
[1:33:58] scripture herein is my father glorified
[1:34:01] that ye bear much fruit right so shall
[1:34:04] ye be my
[1:34:07] disciples he wants us to bear fruit
[1:34:09] brothers and sisters oh man there's only
[1:34:12] that much time left and we're just
[1:34:14] getting started
[1:34:17] here pick up your pen and WR I mean who
[1:34:21] knows this everyone here knows this
[1:34:24] right yeah one night as I was seeking
[1:34:26] the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick
[1:34:28] up my pen and write as I grasped the pen
[1:34:30] to write his Spirit gave me a message
[1:34:34] for the
[1:34:35] church I want to bring it to you it has
[1:34:39] to do with the word and the bride amen I
[1:34:44] got into this brothers and sisters and
[1:34:45] this really was the inspiration for me
[1:34:48] it it really clicked for me and this is
[1:34:49] what gave me the ability to preach it h
[1:34:51] about how Mary in the story of Gabriel
[1:34:55] coming to her and brother bradam talks
[1:34:56] about it in here but this was the
[1:34:57] inspiration for it brother bradam wasn't
[1:34:59] telling a Christmas story and I want to
[1:35:02] say this God was not telling a Christmas
[1:35:05] story when Gabriel went to Mary and and
[1:35:09] the whole world hasn't spun into a
[1:35:11] Christmas story but what he was doing
[1:35:13] was showing that there is going to be a
[1:35:15] virgin bride there is going to be one
[1:35:19] that will take the word of a message an
[1:35:22] angel messenger into her heart and say I
[1:35:26] don't understand it I can't explain it
[1:35:28] but I say Amen to that word and when she
[1:35:31] says Amen to that word and takes the
[1:35:34] whole word into her heart then there's a
[1:35:36] life that comes over her the power of
[1:35:39] the highest overshadows her and that
[1:35:41] seed comes to life but what does it
[1:35:44] bring to life it doesn't bring brother
[1:35:47] Barry and Jesus does it it doesn't bring
[1:35:51] a mixed life it's not hybridized it's
[1:35:53] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:35:56] and forever it's that mind that was in
[1:35:58] Christ now in you brothers and sisters
[1:36:01] then we can just ask what we will
[1:36:03] because we won't ask a this it'll always
[1:36:04] be according to scripture by here is
[1:36:08] what I'm trying to say to you the law of
[1:36:10] reproduction is that each species brings
[1:36:13] forth after its own kind even according
[1:36:16] to Genesis 1111 and God said let the
[1:36:19] Earth bring forth grass and the herb
[1:36:21] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[1:36:24] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[1:36:28] is in itself upon the Earth and it was
[1:36:31] so isn't it interesting just to pause
[1:36:33] there the the the the the seeds the
[1:36:37] fruit they didn't have to try and
[1:36:39] produce anything it was already there it
[1:36:41] was in itself and every single one would
[1:36:44] bring forth after itself there was no
[1:36:47] trying to make it
[1:36:49] different whatever life was in the seed
[1:36:52] came forth into a plant and then into
[1:36:56] Fruit the very same law applies to the
[1:36:59] church today if ye abide in me remember
[1:37:02] he said it in John 15 I am the True Vine
[1:37:05] and my father's a husband you know I got
[1:37:07] to say I really kind of wish that I was
[1:37:09] preaching on Sunday because I'm getting
[1:37:11] like a a dump truck full of good
[1:37:17] my that very same life applies to that
[1:37:21] very same law applies to the church
[1:37:23] today
[1:37:24] whatever seed started the church will
[1:37:26] come forth and be like the Original Seed
[1:37:29] because it is the same seed in these
[1:37:32] last days the true bride Church Christ
[1:37:36] seed will come to The
[1:37:38] Headstone and she will be the Super
[1:37:41] church amen a super race as she nears
[1:37:45] him
[1:37:47] amen they and the bride yes will be so
[1:37:50] much like
[1:37:52] him that they will even be in his very
[1:37:56] image and you know brothers and sisters
[1:37:58] I just I think we could probably close
[1:38:01] there I probably should because I'll
[1:38:04] want to go like in second or third
[1:38:06] overtime here if we keep
[1:38:11] going but there's nothing wrong with
[1:38:13] jumping up and screaming yeah he got a
[1:38:16] goal amen
[1:38:18] amen but you know I I will call the
[1:38:21] musicians because we are at the end here
[1:38:23] but in these last days the true bride
[1:38:26] Church Christ seed will come to The
[1:38:30] Headstone there's so much right here
[1:38:32] just in this one paragraph to unpack
[1:38:34] brothers and sisters and she will be the
[1:38:37] Super Church a super race as she nears
[1:38:39] him he even goes into this later on
[1:38:42] we'll talk about it you could read it I
[1:38:44] would highly recommend reading it and
[1:38:45] just meditating on it a little bit you
[1:38:47] know they he talks about Joshua and how
[1:38:50] when they went over into the Promised
[1:38:51] landine it's at the end of this this
[1:38:53] this uh this uh encouragement that God
[1:38:56] gave to brother Bram but you
[1:38:59] know they said to Joshua brother Bram
[1:39:02] says maybe God has just stopped dealing
[1:39:05] with you maybe you've just lost your
[1:39:07] Edge maybe maybe maybe maybe no no no
[1:39:11] Joshua knew exactly where he stood he
[1:39:13] knew exactly who he was he was of
[1:39:15] another Spirit just like his buddy Caleb
[1:39:18] but it was the 10 others that were busy
[1:39:19] trying to make some other manifestations
[1:39:22] happen you know it's not about putting
[1:39:25] on
[1:39:26] anything and it's not about trying to
[1:39:29] act a certain way trying to look a
[1:39:31] certain way you know what a dove is just
[1:39:34] a dove a dove is just white because a
[1:39:38] dove is made to be white the the
[1:39:40] feathers on it they have an oil in them
[1:39:43] a and dirt just can't stick to them
[1:39:46] sheep Just Produce wool they can't just
[1:39:49] decide they want to produce wool and
[1:39:51] they can't just decide they don't want
[1:39:52] to produce wo they just do they just are
[1:39:56] exactly the way they are and you know
[1:39:59] what the true church Christ true seed as
[1:40:02] she nears The Headstone she will be
[1:40:05] exactly the way God created her to be
[1:40:09] she's not going to try and have have to
[1:40:10] act one way or try and act the other way
[1:40:13] or try and sound or or whatever it is
[1:40:16] anyway she will just be exactly who she
[1:40:19] is they in the bride will be so much
[1:40:22] like him that they will be in his very
[1:40:26] image and you know don't don't mistake
[1:40:28] that brothers and sisters I feel like I
[1:40:30] could just start now don't mistake that
[1:40:32] very image for an image like we talked
[1:40:35] about that was erected on the plains of
[1:40:37] Dora for for for everyone to get in in
[1:40:41] in in line and worship don't think about
[1:40:43] an image that we can raise of our own
[1:40:46] minds the only image brothers and
[1:40:48] sisters is the word of God that's the
[1:40:51] image that he's talking about out here
[1:40:53] being able to say that I believe all of
