[1:01:06] God bless you musicians you have your
[1:01:09] Bibles tonight I'd like to read from
[1:01:11] Isaiah chapter 60.
[1:01:14] I've just been getting a
[1:01:16] real thrill a real inspiration out of
[1:01:18] the prophet Isaiah it's wonderful I
[1:01:21] forgot to mention this a little while
[1:01:22] ago if anybody has lost a ring
[1:01:25] two rings to be particular we found this
[1:01:27] little bag someone found it on the
[1:01:29] playground outside a while back or the
[1:01:32] parking lot somewhere outside and uh
[1:01:35] they could be really special to someone
[1:01:36] there's two rings inside of here just uh
[1:01:39] let us know if you want to see them
[1:01:42] Isaiah chapter 59 I'd like to read from
[1:01:45] tonight
[1:01:47] Isaiah chapter 59. verse 17.
[1:01:58] just love how the spirit of the Lord
[1:02:00] moves
[1:02:02] and ties it all together
[1:02:05] beautiful
[1:02:06] Isaiah chapter 59 verse 17.
[1:02:11] for he put on righteousness as a
[1:02:14] breastplate
[1:02:15] and an helmet of salvation upon his head
[1:02:19] and he put on the garments of Vengeance
[1:02:21] for clothing
[1:02:22] and was clad with Zeal as a cloak
[1:02:26] according to their deeds accordingly he
[1:02:29] will repay Fury to his adversaries
[1:02:32] recompense to his enemies
[1:02:34] to the islands he will repay recompense
[1:02:39] so shall they fear the name of the Lord
[1:02:41] from the West and his glory from the
[1:02:45] rising of the Sun
[1:02:47] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:02:49] flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[1:02:51] up a standard against him
[1:02:53] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[1:02:56] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:02:58] for your word
[1:03:00] as we've already said we know that
[1:03:01] heavens and earth will pass away Lord
[1:03:03] Jesus but your word will remain we thank
[1:03:05] you Father that we can esteem your word
[1:03:07] to be the greatest father there's
[1:03:10] nothing greater than your word we know
[1:03:12] that's what you brought that was the
[1:03:14] message that you brought father Lord we
[1:03:16] can see many great manifestations of
[1:03:19] Supernatural instances in our lives Lord
[1:03:22] but they do not compare to your word and
[1:03:25] father we just put your word first
[1:03:27] tonight Lord Jesus we esteem it the
[1:03:29] greatest and we just ask father that you
[1:03:31] would break it fresh to us tonight Lord
[1:03:33] oh Father we love you and we thank you
[1:03:36] for your word and we pray that you would
[1:03:38] just be glorified in all that's said and
[1:03:40] done just ask all these things now in
[1:03:42] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[1:03:44] bless you tonight you may be seated
[1:03:46] try not to keep us too long
[1:03:49] for those who have to travel and I know
[1:03:51] we're few in number and of course the
[1:03:54] weather isn't great
[1:03:56] but it's just wonderful to get together
[1:03:58] and just want to say God bless you to
[1:04:00] those who are tuning in I know there's
[1:04:02] probably a good number who are who
[1:04:04] aren't here tonight we just pray that
[1:04:06] the Lord will be with you
[1:04:08] a couple of announcements that I wanted
[1:04:10] to make just a reminder that we have the
[1:04:12] 31st communion and I didn't say this
[1:04:15] before but I want to say it now I just
[1:04:16] sort of assumed it and I mustn't do that
[1:04:18] I know we'll have communion but we'll
[1:04:20] also have some worship too
[1:04:22] I I want to not hold us here until
[1:04:26] midnight so we can count down the
[1:04:27] seconds because I know some people just
[1:04:29] want to go Fellowship on on New Year's
[1:04:31] Eve and that's fine I just don't want to
[1:04:33] add any pressure but I also don't want
[1:04:35] to put the pressure on us to say we have
[1:04:37] to be out of here at a certain time
[1:04:39] either
[1:04:40] Spirit of Lord is moving and and we want
[1:04:42] to worship I want to create that
[1:04:43] atmosphere a place where we can just be
[1:04:45] free so if you have a special or
[1:04:48] something you'd like to do on the 31st
[1:04:50] we certainly would like to participate
[1:04:52] in that we'll have a communion of foot
[1:04:53] washing and then we'll all go home we
[1:04:56] are going to leave on the first the next
[1:04:58] day so there won't be a service on
[1:05:00] Sunday just because I anticipated we
[1:05:02] could be here late and it would just be
[1:05:04] easier I want to recommend that we just
[1:05:07] have Fellowship
[1:05:08] um have some dinners have some more food
[1:05:11] and friends and family just enjoy a day
[1:05:14] off
[1:05:15] Lord willing
[1:05:17] so in January while we're away we have
[1:05:19] brother Gilbert who's going to take
[1:05:21] Wednesday the 4th
[1:05:22] and uh brother Toby has agreed to take
[1:05:26] Sunday the 8th
[1:05:28] services and then brother Emmanuel
[1:05:31] is going to take the 11th which is a
[1:05:34] Wednesday and then the 15th which is the
[1:05:36] Sunday and Lord willing will be here
[1:05:38] that Sunday we're supposed to get back
[1:05:40] on the 14th we just don't know for sure
[1:05:42] what's going to happen and I don't know
[1:05:43] how the jet lag is going to be how it
[1:05:47] all worked out we might not even be back
[1:05:48] then but we should be so I just wanted
[1:05:51] to just make a provision so we know
[1:05:54] what's happening so we'll have the
[1:05:55] calendar out for January here in the
[1:05:57] next couple of days I'll talk to brother
[1:05:59] Faron and we'll get that going so we
[1:06:01] leave on Monday the 1st and we return on
[1:06:04] the 14th and we'll just see what the
[1:06:06] Lord has in store we're very excited I
[1:06:09] spoke to brother Mervin the other night
[1:06:10] and uh he was really excited he's
[1:06:13] feeling much better they just had a cold
[1:06:15] and brother brother uh miles made it
[1:06:19] safely and sister Lynn made it safely
[1:06:21] brother miles had a tremendous uh hiccup
[1:06:23] with his airline he uh basically he's
[1:06:26] it's terrible what's happening with
[1:06:28] Airlines now he said that he missed his
[1:06:30] connection he got to the gate and they
[1:06:32] had already closed the gate because of
[1:06:34] his flight from Calgary and once he got
[1:06:38] there he said that plane sat on the
[1:06:40] runway
[1:06:41] for nine hours
[1:06:43] sitting on the runway and he said that
[1:06:45] Miles had no food or entertainment
[1:06:47] inside the terminal but everyone on the
[1:06:48] plane at least had something to do it's
[1:06:52] just unreal I pray that does not happen
[1:06:54] we do not want to do that but then he
[1:06:58] was able to get on the plane and
[1:06:59] actually go and have his flight so
[1:07:01] it's not easy to fly and certainly not
[1:07:04] one of my favorite things but
[1:07:06] if you don't mind just pray for us we'll
[1:07:09] see what the Lord will do
[1:07:11] you happy tonight
[1:07:13] we uh last week we spoke
[1:07:16] about follow me
[1:07:18] as I follow Christ and that was Paul's
[1:07:21] instruction to the church
[1:07:23] and I just think it's so wonderful to
[1:07:25] look at this and and know that it's
[1:07:27] God's pattern and you know we all have a
[1:07:31] decision to make there's a time in our
[1:07:33] lives where we get faced with the word
[1:07:35] ourselves and we get that instruction we
[1:07:38] get that instruction very clearly from
[1:07:40] the word follow me as I follow Christ
[1:07:42] and we know that brother Branham he
[1:07:44] preached what Paul preached this is
[1:07:45] exactly what Paul preached I guess the
[1:07:47] inspiration for me is is coming from the
[1:07:50] thought of Ephesians paralleling Joshua
[1:07:53] that's the grand picture sort of and I
[1:07:55] just can't seem to get away from that
[1:07:56] understanding that there's a reason why
[1:07:59] the seventh angel messenger preached
[1:08:00] that and and that it was changed the
[1:08:03] title to adoption the adoption series
[1:08:05] and that's really what we all are is
[1:08:07] adopted Sons and Daughters of God but
[1:08:09] not the way that we would think about it
[1:08:11] in the world here where there's just a
[1:08:13] random child out there and someone
[1:08:15] decides one day that they want to have a
[1:08:17] child that's not it at all the way that
[1:08:19] brother Branham brought it with adoption
[1:08:21] was that we always were Sons but there
[1:08:22] came a time of appointment a time of
[1:08:25] authority a time where the Baton was
[1:08:27] handed and when your words become the
[1:08:30] same as the father's words it's no
[1:08:32] longer just a child speaking and nobody
[1:08:34] takes it seriously it's when the father
[1:08:36] brings out the child and says hey look
[1:08:38] he's already sealed and he's
[1:08:41] understanding that now it's not
[1:08:42] something that I have to continually try
[1:08:44] to teach him and that's what Paul said
[1:08:46] to the Corinthians you know when you
[1:08:47] should be eating strong meat you have
[1:08:50] need for milk when you need to be
[1:08:52] teaching you still need to be taught but
[1:08:55] we're not in that age today we're not in
[1:08:57] the Corinthian age we're in the Ephesian
[1:08:59] Church age I believe it with all my
[1:09:01] heart we're in the bride age and you
[1:09:03] know the bride hath made herself ready
[1:09:06] and she changes into the wife and
[1:09:09] there's a transformation and when we go
[1:09:11] in the Rapture we're not going to the
[1:09:13] wedding many times we hear people talk
[1:09:14] about that the wedding in the sky but
[1:09:16] the wedding is already happening the
[1:09:17] wedding is on we're going to the
[1:09:19] Celebration In The Sky that's what's
[1:09:21] going to happen
[1:09:22] but God has a pattern and every age has
[1:09:25] a messenger we talked about that and
[1:09:27] Paul he said follow Christ follow me as
[1:09:30] I follow Christ and and how did he
[1:09:32] follow Christ I just think it's good to
[1:09:34] sort of maybe just uh unearth this again
[1:09:36] and and scratch it a little bit and and
[1:09:39] just make it stir up our our Pure Minds
[1:09:41] by way of remembrance the way he
[1:09:43] followed Christ was to die out to
[1:09:45] himself and we talked about that on
[1:09:47] Sunday it wasn't Sunday a wonderful
[1:09:49] service my goodness a baby dedication at
[1:09:52] the beginning and then a baptism at the
[1:09:54] end Merry Christmas hey to the true
[1:09:56] meaning of it like just almost the
[1:09:58] maximum potential of the church capacity
[1:10:00] of what we do here and uh just to think
[1:10:03] about it though brother Branham talks
[1:10:04] about that and sirs we would see Jesus
[1:10:06] the Greeks came and said to him sir we
[1:10:09] would see Jesus we want to they said
[1:10:11] that to the disciples we want to see
[1:10:12] this man we want to see his great
[1:10:13] wonders his Works where is the Healer
[1:10:16] and and you know brother Bradham said it
[1:10:19] very clearly that you're not going to
[1:10:20] see Jesus until you're willing to die be
[1:10:23] able to see him you've got to die you've
[1:10:25] got to go to Calvary to see Jesus that's
[1:10:27] the only way we're going to be able to
[1:10:28] see him but that's what brother Paul he
[1:10:31] taught you know he dies daily he doesn't
[1:10:33] die just once a week or or twice a week
[1:10:35] or maybe once or twice a year or or
[1:10:38] whenever there's just a good song
[1:10:39] service or whenever there's just a
[1:10:41] communion service it's daily every
[1:10:43] single day he dies and how does he die
[1:10:46] he crucifies his flesh the desires of
[1:10:49] the flesh my goodness that's the worst
[1:10:51] one that's the toughest one but to take
[1:10:53] it and just say it's resilient I know
[1:10:55] it's a very difficult thing but it's got
[1:10:57] to die and the only way it's going to
[1:10:59] die is when we willfully choose to kill
[1:11:01] it when we're willing to go on our knees
[1:11:04] and ask the Lord Jesus to crucify this
[1:11:06] flesh but boy once we do that what we're
[1:11:09] doing is we're setting the stage for the
[1:11:12] days the weeks the months and the years
[1:11:14] down the road because we know that the
[1:11:17] Lord said in his word that he'll visit
[1:11:18] the iniquity upon the second and the
[1:11:20] third generation right or to those who
[1:11:23] hate him we know that but what's
[1:11:25] happening is our prayers today aren't
[1:11:27] really affecting they are sometimes
[1:11:30] affecting us immediately but we're not
[1:11:32] the prophet we don't have the ability to
[1:11:34] have the spontaneous instantaneous
[1:11:36] healings like the prophet did although
[1:11:39] we have all of that potential I'm not
[1:11:41] saying we don't have that potential I'm
[1:11:43] just saying that typically when we pray
[1:11:44] for a moment it doesn't supernaturally
[1:11:47] lightning strike Striker we see a
[1:11:48] situation change it takes some time
[1:11:50] before it will change even in the moment
[1:11:52] in great Temptations If we whisper a
[1:11:55] prayer it will change the situation but
[1:11:57] it's going to take a couple of minutes
[1:11:58] God will come on the scene but he's a
[1:12:01] gentleman he doesn't stomp his way into
[1:12:02] the room that that Spirit of Christ is a
[1:12:06] dove and he's timid and when we invite
[1:12:08] him he comes but it can take a little
[1:12:10] bit of time we know that Daniel had a
[1:12:12] situation where it was 21 days of time
[1:12:14] in his temptation before the angel of
[1:12:17] the Lord came to his need
[1:12:19] but it takes a little bit of time and if
[1:12:21] we're willing to put the time in today
[1:12:23] we can see a result tomorrow we talked
[1:12:25] about that on Sunday we've talked about
[1:12:27] its services in the past many times the
[1:12:29] things that we've been faced with as
[1:12:31] Temptation it will just disappear it
[1:12:33] will just vaporize one day we'll look
[1:12:35] back and say didn't that tempt me wasn't
[1:12:37] that a problem in my life once upon a
[1:12:39] time it will happen brothers and sisters
[1:12:41] we could have a great trial today a
[1:12:43] great problem in our lives seemingly a
[1:12:45] great problem in our lives stop looking
[1:12:47] at the problem and stop talking about
[1:12:48] the problem start looking at the promise
[1:12:50] and start talking about the promise and
[1:12:51] watch the angel of the Lord come on the
[1:12:53] scene in his time he'll come in his time
[1:12:56] but how do we follow Christ we follow
[1:12:59] the messenger for our age and what I did
[1:13:01] was I typed it as brother Branham like
[1:13:04] Paul because he preached what Paul
[1:13:06] preached and we said this that many
[1:13:07] people will say well that's a heretic
[1:13:10] right there saying that we uh we follow
[1:13:12] we're making brother Branham brother
[1:13:14] Paul
[1:13:15] and you know what we are but it's not
[1:13:17] the man it's the word and that's why
[1:13:20] we're talking about the word being the
[1:13:21] Paramount Feature of Our Lives that's
[1:13:24] that's our the essence of our existence
[1:13:26] here isn't it the word it's not about
[1:13:28] necessarily even the prophet we can take
[1:13:31] the prophet and make him an idol we can
[1:13:34] turn it into idolatry if we're not
[1:13:36] careful
[1:13:37] we're not interested in that we want to
[1:13:39] put the word out there
[1:13:40] looking at this scripture tonight
[1:13:42] thinking about you know the the book of
[1:13:45] Ephesians and and how beautiful it is
[1:13:47] maybe we can turn over there to the book
[1:13:49] of Ephesians well you're turning to
[1:13:51] Ephesians chapter 6. I'll just read this
[1:13:54] scripture here again
[1:13:56] in Isaiah chapter 59
[1:13:59] we want to turn to Ephesians chapter 6.
[1:14:02] for he put on righteousness as a
[1:14:04] breastplate and an helmet of salvation
[1:14:06] upon his head and he put on the garments
[1:14:09] of Vengeance for clothing and was clad
[1:14:11] with Zeal as a cloak
[1:14:13] isn't it wonderful to look at what Paul
[1:14:15] was saying here put on the whole armor
[1:14:17] of God it's not something new he didn't
[1:14:18] say something new he was talking about
[1:14:21] scripture that was already prophesied
[1:14:24] but you know we talk about this many
[1:14:25] times in Ephesians chapter six we want
[1:14:27] to put on the whole armor of God we're
[1:14:29] going to go to war we're going to go to
[1:14:30] battle we're going to be a spiritual
[1:14:32] Warrior
[1:14:33] but the only way we're going to be able
[1:14:35] to do that is to follow this word
[1:14:36] entirely and to to to recognize that
[1:14:39] we've got to be willing to submit
[1:14:40] ourselves one to another in the fear of
[1:14:42] God not say that I'm the man I'm the
[1:14:44] king I'm the king of the castle you've
[1:14:46] got to serve me everyone else is the
[1:14:47] minions
[1:14:48] that's not the way it works the husbands
[1:14:50] the heads of the homes are supposed to
[1:14:52] love the wives the wives are supposed to
[1:14:54] reverence their husbands when their
[1:14:55] husbands say something their husbands
[1:14:57] say it in such a way that's nice and
[1:14:58] kind and loving and and encouraging to
[1:15:02] the family and to the wife and the wife
[1:15:04] responds to that and says wow my
[1:15:06] husband's wonderful I want to serve him
[1:15:08] I want to reverence him according to the
[1:15:09] word because of the way he treats me
[1:15:11] right
[1:15:13] it's awfully quiet
[1:15:16] but it's true
[1:15:18] but you know if you go back even further
[1:15:19] than that how talking about the family
[1:15:21] roles the children obeying your parents
[1:15:24] the first the first commandment with
[1:15:27] promise go go back beyond all of that it
[1:15:30] gets really kind of sticky because
[1:15:33] there's so many different Traditions
[1:15:34] that have crept in unawares into the
[1:15:37] framework of the Christian church
[1:15:39] because Ephesians chapter 4 says he gave
[1:15:42] some Apostles some prophets some
[1:15:45] evangelists some pastors some teachers
[1:15:47] there's some out there in the message of
[1:15:50] the hour claiming that Ephesians chapter
[1:15:52] 4 Ain't Enough
[1:15:56] now that's a heretic
[1:15:59] but you know we want to put on the whole
[1:16:01] armor of God but we want to Discount
[1:16:02] that and say no there's no evangelist or
[1:16:04] no there's no more pastors we just want
[1:16:06] to press play
[1:16:09] we want to put on the whole armor of God
[1:16:10] but we want to Discount some of that
[1:16:12] other stuff in there it ain't gonna work
[1:16:14] you can put on the whole armor of God
[1:16:17] but there is going to be a big hole in
[1:16:19] that armor we're gonna like we said it
[1:16:21] before we're gonna put on that busting
[1:16:23] great breastplate of righteousness and
[1:16:26] look at me how righteous I am I've got
[1:16:28] the breastplate of righteousness we're
[1:16:29] not going to have the sword of the
[1:16:30] spirit
[1:16:31] but you know what the word of God says
[1:16:33] is to take the whole armor of God put on
[1:16:35] the whole armor of God it's not
[1:16:37] something new it's something that was
[1:16:38] already prophesied it's such a beautiful
[1:16:40] thought and the why do we do it because
[1:16:42] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:16:44] when our wife says something to poke us
[1:16:46] it's not flesh and blood that's coming
[1:16:48] against us when our husbands maybe say
[1:16:51] something because of a temper or
[1:16:53] whatever it is it's not the husband is
[1:16:55] not flesh and blood it's Satan getting
[1:16:57] in our our lives in the moment and if
[1:17:00] you wonder is that possible take a look
[1:17:02] at when Jesus said it's coming time for
[1:17:04] me to his disciples to go up and be
[1:17:06] crucified to die for the men and women
[1:17:09] of this world and what did his disciple
[1:17:12] is call it his chief disciple say to him
[1:17:15] oh no nobody's going to kill you ah
[1:17:17] fight to the death for you and what did
[1:17:19] Jesus say to him he didn't say Peter
[1:17:21] come on you got to just step back and
[1:17:24] think about this we're not wrestling
[1:17:25] against flesh and blood Peter what did
[1:17:26] he say he said get behind me Satan
[1:17:30] because you're an offense to me
[1:17:32] imagine how Peter felt in that moment
[1:17:35] now husbands don't go and say that to
[1:17:37] your wives I'm telling you
[1:17:40] it might be cold dinners for a while but
[1:17:42] wives don't do the same to your husbands
[1:17:44] and children don't ever do it
[1:17:47] but we need to recognize as Sons and
[1:17:50] Daughters of God adopted Sons and
[1:17:51] Daughters of God that we're we're we're
[1:17:53] more than conquerors through this word
[1:17:55] of God and that we know we can recognize
[1:17:57] when Satan is there remember we said
[1:17:59] it's a proverb I can't remember exactly
[1:18:01] what it is but soft words turn away
[1:18:03] Wrath
[1:18:04] when someone wants to speak sharp to you
[1:18:07] just push it aside and say I love you
[1:18:10] honey
[1:18:11] maybe I'll just go and do this for you
[1:18:13] and maybe you don't even have to say a
[1:18:15] word maybe you can just go and act I'm
[1:18:16] more of an actor it's a terrible thing
[1:18:18] it's a trait for me that I I just I'm
[1:18:20] not skillful with words to go to my wife
[1:18:22] and write a big poetic letter and and
[1:18:25] make her feel good she loves that I know
[1:18:27] it but my thing is I'll go and do
[1:18:29] something I'll go and do the laundry
[1:18:30] I'll go and do the dishes I'll go and
[1:18:33] try and do something to show my love
[1:18:35] we're all created differently but we
[1:18:38] have the ability to recognize the battle
[1:18:40] that we're in it's not against one
[1:18:41] another
[1:18:42] when we do that we're giving Satan a day
[1:18:45] off who wants to give him a day off we
[1:18:48] want to see him punished if there's
[1:18:50] anyone that wants to see anyone punished
[1:18:52] it's got to be the Sons and Daughters of
[1:18:54] God wanting to see Satan get his
[1:18:57] but we're not wrestling against flesh
[1:18:58] and blood brothers and sisters it's
[1:19:00] principalities and powers and remember
[1:19:02] we heard about that the principality is
[1:19:04] the the guy that's got that great
[1:19:06] portfolio of administrative assistants
[1:19:09] just waiting to do his bidding he says
[1:19:11] one word go and see brother Henry and
[1:19:13] the dick family and just get in their
[1:19:15] midst and and mess with them that's what
[1:19:17] the principalities are an army of devils
[1:19:20] working against the Sons and Daughters
[1:19:22] of God principalities and Powers that's
[1:19:25] who we're wrestling against so when we
[1:19:27] can surrender ourselves to Christ
[1:19:29] because remember Paul the messenger for
[1:19:31] the age the first Ephesian age he said
[1:19:34] my his strength is made perfect in my
[1:19:37] weakness not in my strength not not in
[1:19:39] me showing off my breastplate of
[1:19:41] righteousness and showing what I can do
[1:19:42] I know the word I know the quotes I know
[1:19:45] this I know that we know nothing
[1:19:47] Paul Paul said he had to go to Arabia
[1:19:50] and counted all that he thought he knew
[1:19:51] is done
[1:19:53] and crucify his flesh to accept Christ
[1:19:58] you know this scripture just really
[1:20:00] I really want to get into this now we'll
[1:20:02] get into it here uh Isaiah 59 verse 19.
[1:20:06] so shall they fear the name of the Lord
[1:20:08] from the West and his glory from the
[1:20:10] rising of the Sun
[1:20:12] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:20:14] flood
[1:20:15] the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[1:20:17] standard against him how many times has
[1:20:19] the enemy come in like a flood brothers
[1:20:21] and sisters into our churches into our
[1:20:24] homes into our relationships into our
[1:20:27] minds Oh my he always comes in like a
[1:20:30] flood that's that's so beautiful that
[1:20:33] the scripture would identify the tactics
[1:20:35] of the devil because he does come in
[1:20:38] like a flood I've had times in my life
[1:20:40] where he's come into my life in such a
[1:20:42] way I don't know if anybody else has
[1:20:44] ever experienced it where I start to get
[1:20:45] waves of of fear and anxiety waves of
[1:20:49] fear and anxiety and I don't even know
[1:20:50] if I can breathe I don't even know what
[1:20:52] I should do whether I should stand up or
[1:20:54] sit down or lay down I can't even drive
[1:20:57] I just need to sit down and breathe but
[1:20:59] then cry out to the Lord and say Lord
[1:21:01] help me I just don't know what to do in
[1:21:03] this moment but then when we do cry out
[1:21:05] to him doesn't he come around and he
[1:21:08] gives us some fresh oxygen in our lungs
[1:21:10] he gives us the ability to breathe he
[1:21:12] takes those Devils off of us and just
[1:21:14] gives us the freedom that we want out of
[1:21:17] 1965 the power of transformation brother
[1:21:19] Branham he says now remember don't
[1:21:21] forget this brother Leo and Gene
[1:21:24] especially
[1:21:25] now you think Satan is going to let this
[1:21:27] go on like this without a hindrance oh
[1:21:29] no
[1:21:30] he sure won't he's going to fly in one
[1:21:34] of these days just like a whirlwind
[1:21:37] but when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:21:39] the spirit of God raises a standard
[1:21:42] against it
[1:21:43] we have to remember that when we get
[1:21:45] those overwhelming moments it feels like
[1:21:47] we're overwhelmed the situation in the
[1:21:50] church the situation in our home the
[1:21:52] situation in our relationships maybe in
[1:21:54] our business whatever it is that's the
[1:21:56] devil coming in like a flood but if
[1:21:58] we're patient if we're willing to just
[1:22:01] take God at his word he will raise a
[1:22:03] standard against that situation brother
[1:22:05] Branham goes on to say just keep lifting
[1:22:08] yourself up in prayer before God
[1:22:11] cling to one another hold to God
[1:22:15] the devil wants us to retract
[1:22:18] he wants us to stay home and say oh no
[1:22:20] that stepped on my toes nope I can't do
[1:22:23] that when we do that we're playing into
[1:22:25] the devil's tactics we're not
[1:22:27] recognizing that he's coming in like a
[1:22:28] flood he's shaking us up and trying to
[1:22:31] get us to see the hinder Parts remember
[1:22:32] the hinder Parts Balaam and balak that
[1:22:35] was the way that he tried to curse
[1:22:37] Israel get the prophet to go and look at
[1:22:39] all the hinder parts that's the same
[1:22:41] Spirit today that gets people to talk to
[1:22:43] people to go and talk about the hinder
[1:22:45] Parts the more we do that brothers and
[1:22:47] sisters the more we give devil a day off
[1:22:49] we just work for him brother Branham
[1:22:51] says just keep lifting yourself up in
[1:22:53] prayer before God cling to one another
[1:22:55] hold to God for if you love one another
[1:22:57] it shows you love God this will all men
[1:23:00] know that you love my disciples when you
[1:23:02] love have love one for the other
[1:23:05] not when you're not when you're a good
[1:23:07] good Christian a good message believer
[1:23:09] and you go to church all the time but
[1:23:10] you just can't stand that brother and
[1:23:12] you'll never go and talk to him and
[1:23:13] something about them or whatever it is
[1:23:15] that's not going to do it for you
[1:23:18] got to remember that we're not wrestling
[1:23:19] against flesh and blood Bush aside the
[1:23:21] Flesh and Blood Brothers and Sisters
[1:23:22] push aside the hinder Parts recognize
[1:23:24] that every one of us have hinder Parts
[1:23:26] even even new King Charles
[1:23:28] he's got hinder parts
[1:23:31] they're quite hidden though he's got
[1:23:32] people to actually help scrub his hinder
[1:23:34] parts from the view of society but you
[1:23:37] know us as normal peasants we don't have
[1:23:39] anybody to scrub that not not from
[1:23:41] society's eyes but what we do have is
[1:23:43] the Lord Jesus Christ to actually take
[1:23:45] away those hinder parts to take away our
[1:23:48] own thoughts you know what the biggest
[1:23:49] problem is when we get into those
[1:23:51] situations and we start to look at other
[1:23:53] people you know what it's not the other
[1:23:55] people it's ourselves
[1:23:56] is the devil working on us and that's
[1:23:58] why we have to be like David and have a
[1:24:00] contrite heart and a humble spirit and
[1:24:02] say Lord create in me a new heart don't
[1:24:05] create a new heart in them create one in
[1:24:07] me and renew a right spirit in me
[1:24:09] because if you do that you'll change the
[1:24:12] situation entirely that brother that
[1:24:14] would spit in your face and and your
[1:24:16] friend would say I'll take his head off
[1:24:18] of that dog what what you'll say is no
[1:24:20] no no no no no that was just a test from
[1:24:22] God don't worry about it he's a Believer
[1:24:24] he didn't mean to do that even though he
[1:24:26] spit right in my face and stomped on my
[1:24:28] feet and maybe stuck it between my my
[1:24:30] ribs from my backside he didn't mean to
[1:24:33] do that it was just an evil spirit that
[1:24:35] was afflicting him that's what we'll say
[1:24:37] because we have a new heart there's a
[1:24:39] new spirit inside of us and what's that
[1:24:41] new heart or spirit is simple it's the
[1:24:42] Holy Ghost when we're sealed in like we
[1:24:45] sang brothers and sisters it doesn't
[1:24:46] matter what comes our way we won't be
[1:24:49] overwhelmed nothing can overwhelm us
[1:24:52] I got some real good inspiration from
[1:24:54] the whole armor of God to take on the
[1:24:56] whole armor of God from 1962.
[1:24:59] brother Adam says lowest of all the
[1:25:01] nations talking about North America
[1:25:03] lowest of all the nations more divorces
[1:25:05] in America than there is in the rest of
[1:25:07] the world put together almost corrupt
[1:25:10] dirty filthy the last civilization
[1:25:14] and we're on the west coast where the
[1:25:16] East and the West will meet
[1:25:18] that's right right in our own churches
[1:25:21] right among our own people I trust that
[1:25:25] isn't here I trust that isn't there I
[1:25:27] trust that's not in the Church of the
[1:25:29] Living God but we know Satan comes to
[1:25:31] church Satan's not afraid to come to
[1:25:34] church and get in people's minds and you
[1:25:36] know honestly I've heard people even say
[1:25:38] it the word divorce I've heard it but
[1:25:42] you know what that's of the devil
[1:25:44] it's the devil getting in our minds
[1:25:46] trying to get us to speak his language
[1:25:48] and you know the power of the spoken
[1:25:50] word we were talking about that brothers
[1:25:51] and sisters we said it a long time ago
[1:25:53] if we believe in the power of the spoken
[1:25:55] word we're living in the third poll
[1:25:56] realm when we talk about things people
[1:25:58] in the world recognize this
[1:26:01] that you can set an intention and you
[1:26:03] can actually create a vision board and
[1:26:05] you can start to speak to all of the
[1:26:07] vision and all of the different
[1:26:09] components that go in that vision board
[1:26:10] and you can carefully select the
[1:26:12] pictures of the things you want to
[1:26:14] visualize and as you go through that and
[1:26:16] you study it and you worship that that
[1:26:19] will come to manifest in your life and
[1:26:21] if you're not careful those words and
[1:26:23] thoughts that Satan plants in your head
[1:26:25] will become your vision board and you'll
[1:26:28] start to study them and you'll start to
[1:26:30] look at them and before long you'll see
[1:26:32] them start to manifest
[1:26:34] but how much more
[1:26:35] the Sons and Daughters of God the
[1:26:37] positive
[1:26:38] no Satan that's my wife
[1:26:40] and God gave her to me before the
[1:26:42] foundation of the world God took her
[1:26:44] from my side just like he took me from
[1:26:46] his side that that business of thinking
[1:26:48] that I've got the right to do anything
[1:26:50] about putting away no way because if
[1:26:52] I've got the right to put someone away
[1:26:54] my wife away then God's got the right to
[1:26:56] put me away and really if we believe
[1:26:58] that God gave us our wives then it works
[1:27:00] that way and I think that's Dangerous
[1:27:03] Ground I would never want to step out on
[1:27:04] that Limb and think oh my I've got the
[1:27:06] right to put my wife away because then I
[1:27:08] would say you know what what we're doing
[1:27:09] is we're living under the law
[1:27:14] hi
[1:27:16] we got the power of the spoken word in
[1:27:17] our lives personally I believe we can go
[1:27:20] one step forward
[1:27:21] by the power of the spoken word in our
[1:27:23] lives
[1:27:23] if we talk about the positive we'll go
[1:27:25] one step forward One Foot In Front of
[1:27:27] the other
[1:27:28] but if we start going negative and we
[1:27:30] start talking about that that that
[1:27:32] improper Parts the the hinder parts of
[1:27:35] people and start talking for Satan being
[1:27:37] Satan's voice box what happens is one
[1:27:39] word won't take us one step forward
[1:27:41] it'll take us ten steps backwards and
[1:27:44] every second word might be 20 steps
[1:27:47] further and we go so far back before
[1:27:50] long we don't even know how we got there
[1:27:51] and before long we're different people
[1:27:54] but it's because we're of a different
[1:27:55] spirit it's not it's not human beings
[1:27:58] it's just a spiritual battle but the
[1:28:00] random goes on I'll just read this here
[1:28:03] I just get inspired I get excited sorry
[1:28:05] but Satan makes it appealing Satan makes
[1:28:09] the ideas appealing he makes us think
[1:28:11] maybe maybe it's appealing I've suffered
[1:28:13] from it
[1:28:14] I went through it in my own marriage I
[1:28:16] have to say it there is a time in my
[1:28:18] life where I wasn't right with God and
[1:28:20] what did I do I want to put it on my
[1:28:22] wife and say that it's her fault she's
[1:28:23] not submitting she's out of her position
[1:28:26] but who was out of their position
[1:28:28] brothers and sisters was brother Barry
[1:28:31] on his knees in prayer nope was he in
[1:28:33] the word nope did he come to church yep
[1:28:36] dressed up nice came to church
[1:28:37] everything was great right no it wasn't
[1:28:40] I was actually battling a spirit and I
[1:28:43] didn't realize it I was trying to battle
[1:28:45] my own self really but here we have
[1:28:48] brother Brad I'm saying Satan makes it
[1:28:50] appealing he makes us think that it's
[1:28:52] the right thing certainly it's appealing
[1:28:55] sin is appealing but the enemy keeps
[1:28:58] finding a better bait
[1:29:00] he he will strip her off a little more
[1:29:03] do this do that and don't worry he'll
[1:29:06] never make her completely naked
[1:29:09] she would be horrible then see he knows
[1:29:12] just what to do
[1:29:14] but Satan keeps bringing sin in and that
[1:29:17] was the original sin
[1:29:18] that's where he's going out with the
[1:29:20] same thing as the kingdom come in the
[1:29:22] Warfare he says now watch but God
[1:29:25] doesn't have to do anything more to his
[1:29:28] make it any more appealing
[1:29:31] and it's true he doesn't have to change
[1:29:33] his word anymore
[1:29:34] doesn't have to have a greater Ministry
[1:29:37] he doesn't have to do anything more
[1:29:38] because his word is what will do it
[1:29:41] now watch but God doesn't have to do
[1:29:43] anything more to his make it any more
[1:29:46] appealing the only thing he has to do is
[1:29:48] just raise up a standard of his own word
[1:29:51] against the enemy
[1:29:54] when the Bible said when the enemy comes
[1:29:57] in like a flood the spirit of God raises
[1:29:59] the standard against it what does he do
[1:30:02] he makes the word
[1:30:03] that he has already said more positive
[1:30:08] he goes woo take in his same word and
[1:30:12] just making it more positive
[1:30:16] but brothers and sisters not going to do
[1:30:17] what I always do I'm just going to get
[1:30:18] to the punch line where does he make
[1:30:19] that word where does that word come from
[1:30:21] it's it's in print form here there it is
[1:30:24] all the potential lies in this word but
[1:30:26] if someone doesn't speak this word
[1:30:28] it's just potential sitting there black
[1:30:30] and white right on pages but boy oh boy
[1:30:33] when we speak his word when we're sealed
[1:30:35] in like we sang about when we're truly
[1:30:37] adopted Sons and Daughters of God and we
[1:30:39] begin to speak his word
[1:30:42] the enemy can come in like a flood can
[1:30:44] he
[1:30:45] when he comes in like a flood
[1:30:48] we'll just raise right above it doesn't
[1:30:50] matter how much flood comes in we'll
[1:30:51] just continually go over it think about
[1:30:53] Noah's Ark the ark that Noah made didn't
[1:30:56] matter how how many Fountains of the
[1:30:58] deep were Unleashed and how much rain
[1:31:00] came from the heavens and how much water
[1:31:02] gushed upon the Earth that Ark was
[1:31:05] always on top of it and that's the
[1:31:07] standard of God and you know the
[1:31:08] standard of God is his word but that
[1:31:10] word inside of us is what gives us the
[1:31:13] ability to rise and Float above all of
[1:31:15] the trash in this world and that's where
[1:31:18] I say when we have the Temptations If we
[1:31:20] can just put on the whole armor of God
[1:31:21] if we can just take his word if we can
[1:31:23] just get sealed in if we could just not
[1:31:25] have a door in a door not just have a
[1:31:27] secret place that we're not willing to
[1:31:29] let go of in our lives as long as we got
[1:31:31] a secret place that we're holding on to
[1:31:33] in our lives Satan has every single
[1:31:34] right to attack us but boy when we get
[1:31:37] rid of all the reservations when we
[1:31:38] clear out all the trash and we say Lord
[1:31:40] just be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:31:41] if I've got to get rid of this if I've
[1:31:43] got to go do that whatever it is I've
[1:31:44] Got to Do Lord I'll do it I'm willing
[1:31:46] now you got my full attention when we do
[1:31:48] that then we eliminate Satan's power
[1:31:51] from our life we eliminate Satan's power
[1:31:53] from our families and what we do is we
[1:31:56] actually create a situation where we're
[1:31:58] now pitched in so pitched in it doesn't
[1:32:01] matter how much water how much flood
[1:32:03] comes our way
[1:32:04] we will always rise above it
[1:32:08] goes on to say
[1:32:10] to take the whole armor of God 1962.
[1:32:13] what was it Luther and the Reformation
[1:32:14] justification then when the enemy begin
[1:32:16] to come in like a flood he raised up a
[1:32:19] standard sanctification a little more
[1:32:21] powerful in the spirit then when the
[1:32:23] enemy began to cover that over and they
[1:32:25] begin to organize and join this and that
[1:32:28] and the other then the spirit of God
[1:32:30] moved into the Pentecostals
[1:32:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:35] they organized and went off
[1:32:37] now what's he doing
[1:32:39] there's no other age to come to
[1:32:41] but he's taking that Pentecostal church
[1:32:44] and taking the elect out of that and
[1:32:47] honing it so that when this headstone
[1:32:49] comes upon it it will have to be like
[1:32:52] the rest of it
[1:32:55] why it's so them rocks laying up there
[1:32:58] with hundreds of tons laying up there is
[1:33:01] so close together without mortar that
[1:33:04] you can't run a razor blade between them
[1:33:07] and when The Headstone comes
[1:33:09] Christ come to his Temple
[1:33:11] it will have to fit perfect like the
[1:33:14] rest of it
[1:33:16] and the ministry of the Pentecostal
[1:33:18] Church will have to get so perfect to
[1:33:21] it'll fit right in with the same
[1:33:23] Ministry that he had here which will
[1:33:27] take the whole thing into the rapture
[1:33:29] being the church that's right
[1:33:32] remember I talked about it before the
[1:33:34] stature of the perfect man
[1:33:35] and I still haven't done it I need to
[1:33:37] talk to someone technical
[1:33:39] maybe I can do that before I go to the
[1:33:41] Philippines I'll bring that there I
[1:33:42] don't know maybe it's crazy but I just
[1:33:45] personally believe based on this here
[1:33:47] the way we look at that the stature of
[1:33:49] the perfect man we see all of the layers
[1:33:52] all the way up right up to where we get
[1:33:55] to the Holy Ghost and then we have
[1:33:57] Christ himself we see two triangles
[1:33:59] that's the way this is always
[1:34:00] represented as two triangles what he's
[1:34:03] saying here is not two triangles
[1:34:05] what he's saying here is one triangle
[1:34:08] one individual triangle it will fit
[1:34:10] together as one I believe personally
[1:34:13] just my own view that we need to stop
[1:34:16] looking at it as two separate triangles
[1:34:18] we're not going up a bunch of stairs
[1:34:20] like we're going to get to a certain
[1:34:22] destination what we're going to do is
[1:34:24] get the baptism the true baptism of the
[1:34:26] Holy Ghost and become one mind and one
[1:34:28] Accord and we will have every single
[1:34:30] virtue that there is in the Statue of
[1:34:33] the perfect man because it's the fruit
[1:34:35] of the spirit not fruits it's not a
[1:34:38] plural thing we don't just go and get
[1:34:40] one portion of it remember in Ephesians
[1:34:42] we read this here put on the whole armor
[1:34:45] of God did we read that we didn't we
[1:34:48] didn't we just turned there I'm sorry
[1:34:50] got excited Ephesians chapter 6 verse 13
[1:34:53] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:34:56] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[1:34:58] in the evil day having done all to stand
[1:35:02] and the word with stand there it remains
[1:35:04] it means you remain undamaged or
[1:35:07] unaffected by and resist
[1:35:09] offer strong resistance or opposition to
[1:35:14] the attacks of the enemy recognizing
[1:35:16] it's not flesh and blood that we're
[1:35:17] fighting against we're not fighting
[1:35:19] against our brother and our sister we're
[1:35:20] not fighting against the deacons we're
[1:35:22] not fighting against our parents what
[1:35:24] we're doing is we're wrestling against
[1:35:25] flesh and blood
[1:35:27] and and that's not what we need to do
[1:35:30] we're wrestling against principalities
[1:35:32] and Powers against Spirits rulers of the
[1:35:35] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:35:37] wickedness in high places
[1:35:39] I know some people have turned there
[1:35:40] I'll just read that again verse 13 of
[1:35:42] Ephesians chapter 6 take unto you
[1:35:45] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:35:47] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[1:35:49] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:35:53] stand
[1:35:54] therefore having your loins gird about
[1:35:57] with truth having on the breastplate of
[1:36:00] righteousness and your feet shot with
[1:36:01] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:36:04] above all taking the shield of faith
[1:36:06] wherewith you'll be able to quench all
[1:36:08] the fiery darts of the wicked and take
[1:36:10] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[1:36:12] the spirit which is the word of God
[1:36:14] praying always with all prayer and
[1:36:18] supplication in the spirit and watching
[1:36:21] thereto with all perseverance and
[1:36:23] supplication for All Saints
[1:36:27] I personally believe this with all my
[1:36:29] heart we we can only put on the whole
[1:36:31] armor of God all of it brothers and
[1:36:33] sisters it's not stages it's not steps
[1:36:35] it's not pieces and parts when we are
[1:36:38] truly sealed in when we're truly
[1:36:40] baptized into Christ when we have Christ
[1:36:43] inside of us we we pitch out all of the
[1:36:47] worldly things and we pitch in all of
[1:36:49] the armor of God the whole armor of God
[1:36:52] is what we put on when we are truly
[1:36:54] baptized into Christ truly adopted Sons
[1:36:58] and Daughters of God
[1:37:00] you know out of to take on the whole
[1:37:02] armor of God brother Branham says now
[1:37:04] when the enemy comes in like a flood he
[1:37:07] raises a standard against it and you
[1:37:09] know we can look at this world I just
[1:37:11] want to say it this way we look at this
[1:37:13] world
[1:37:14] the enemy has come in like a flood they
[1:37:16] have dialed in now that really what's
[1:37:18] going to get the people is screens
[1:37:21] that's what's going to get the people
[1:37:22] the screens Holograms it attracts the
[1:37:25] eyes it's just we're just created like
[1:37:27] nature we have that that that animal
[1:37:29] element in us from the hybridization
[1:37:31] that happened in the garden right where
[1:37:33] where we're paralyzed when it comes to
[1:37:36] screens and all of the marketing agents
[1:37:37] they've realized it it's not just
[1:37:39] Billboards now but it's ginormous
[1:37:41] televisions showing images we go into
[1:37:44] stores and that's what we get that's why
[1:37:46] they're smartphones in everyone's pocket
[1:37:47] because it's to capture the attention of
[1:37:50] the people and and we had talked about
[1:37:52] this before and this is just for free
[1:37:54] for our friends but we were telling our
[1:37:56] children the original television is that
[1:37:58] fire that we've been sitting around
[1:37:59] talking about we Put Another Log on the
[1:38:01] flyer we change the channel and there's
[1:38:03] something about it it's mesmerizing it
[1:38:05] pulls our eyes in but Satan now has
[1:38:07] created a painted fire to try and warp
[1:38:10] our minds and we can watch something and
[1:38:12] it can be completely Innocent but
[1:38:14] there's always something subliminal
[1:38:15] somewhere along the way that's going to
[1:38:17] penetrate and get us we were talking
[1:38:19] about it on the way to church tonight
[1:38:21] and we heard that video games are no
[1:38:23] longer a part of of our friends lives
[1:38:25] and I think that's such a beautiful
[1:38:27] thing and really honestly I don't think
[1:38:29] there's good in video games video games
[1:38:31] are are an addiction video games will
[1:38:33] take us the wrong way and especially for
[1:38:36] our children for our children to see
[1:38:38] that that's a dangerous thing I believe
[1:38:40] and and maybe we could have a discussion
[1:38:43] about it afterwards but you know what as
[1:38:45] as as heads of the home as as husbands
[1:38:47] as fathers it's our responsibility We're
[1:38:50] The Gatekeepers you know brother Branham
[1:38:52] talks about that song how did the goats
[1:38:54] get in how do we have problems in our
[1:38:56] family where do they come from we got to
[1:38:58] go to the top we talked about that book
[1:39:00] you know when fish fly if a fish always
[1:39:03] stinks at the head first
[1:39:05] it's the head of the home they're the
[1:39:06] ones that are going to answer for it God
[1:39:08] never came down to the Garden of Eden
[1:39:09] and said eve where are you where where
[1:39:12] are you at Eve aren't you where are you
[1:39:14] at Eve he didn't do that he came to the
[1:39:16] Garden of Eden he said Adam what's going
[1:39:18] on he didn't tell Eve God didn't tell
[1:39:21] Eve don't eat of that fruit of that tree
[1:39:23] he told Adam don't eat of the fruit of
[1:39:26] that tree and it's up to the husband to
[1:39:28] actually explain this stuff to the wives
[1:39:30] to be The Gatekeepers of the home when
[1:39:32] the enemy comes in like a flood brother
[1:39:34] Brad I'm speaking here he raises a
[1:39:36] standard against it in our day with all
[1:39:38] of this flood of evil in this world we
[1:39:41] are the standard against it and the only
[1:39:44] way we can be the standard against it is
[1:39:45] to have his word on our lips his word in
[1:39:49] our hearts to be sealed in with the
[1:39:51] pitch of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives now
[1:39:54] when the enemy comes in like a flood he
[1:39:55] raises a standard against it now watch
[1:39:57] in Eden he gave them his word for their
[1:40:00] armor
[1:40:01] put on the whole armor of God In the
[1:40:04] Garden of Eden really wasn't it perfect
[1:40:06] there
[1:40:07] didn't they have everything they needed
[1:40:10] but he said he gave them the armor of
[1:40:13] his word
[1:40:15] he gave them his word for their armor
[1:40:17] just the word spoke
[1:40:20] then the enemy came in like a flood
[1:40:25] isn't that interesting I don't know if I
[1:40:26] ever looked at it this way that it was
[1:40:28] like that right the enemy came in like a
[1:40:30] flood all of the curse came in just
[1:40:32] flooded in just because of one word and
[1:40:34] I know that we we know this this is
[1:40:36] Elementary as Believers but I personally
[1:40:38] have never looked at it this way the
[1:40:39] enemy came into Eden as a flood from one
[1:40:42] word
[1:40:44] one word
[1:40:47] and he took the word and made it flesh
[1:40:49] to dwell Among Us
[1:40:51] a little stronger
[1:40:53] from there speaking here he is walking
[1:40:56] on Earth Glory
[1:40:58] going to call me Holy Roller anyhow so
[1:41:01] you might as well get used to it now he
[1:41:03] says oh first it was a spoken word out
[1:41:06] yonder
[1:41:07] now here it is you could touch it
[1:41:12] remember when he created everything he's
[1:41:14] talking about creation and then Jesus
[1:41:17] well first it was a spoken word out
[1:41:19] yonder now here it is you could touch it
[1:41:22] and it was made flesh then when the
[1:41:24] enemies still come in like a flood
[1:41:26] he poured the word into the person
[1:41:30] being the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:33] there's your one two three again
[1:41:35] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:41:37] the Holy Ghost like father son Holy
[1:41:41] Ghost and so forth into protection
[1:41:45] in Perfection sorry now notice the
[1:41:47] spoken word God above us God With Us God
[1:41:50] in us the word above us the word with us
[1:41:54] the word in us hallelujah
[1:41:57] ye are God's Army marching on God's
[1:42:01] spoken word above us in a pillar of fire
[1:42:04] God's manifestation of his word in flesh
[1:42:09] now God's spirit spoken word in US amen
[1:42:16] remember we've seen this before many
[1:42:19] many times
[1:42:20] all that
[1:42:22] God was he poured into Christ
[1:42:25] the mystery of God revealed all that
[1:42:27] Christ was
[1:42:29] he poured into his church
[1:42:32] all that Christ was that's a heavy
[1:42:34] statement how do we actually understand
[1:42:36] that even it's hard to comprehend that
[1:42:38] because I sure don't feel like Christ do
[1:42:40] you
[1:42:41] but it doesn't matter how we feel isn't
[1:42:43] that amazing the prophet of God saying
[1:42:45] our feelings have nothing to do with it
[1:42:46] the Holy Ghost is without sensation it
[1:42:49] is without sensation but it causes a
[1:42:52] reaction in the life of a Believer it
[1:42:54] causes an emotion it causes something to
[1:42:57] happen in our lives we're no longer the
[1:42:59] same people that we used to be but we
[1:43:02] want to remember this brothers and
[1:43:03] sisters we put on the whole armor of God
[1:43:05] it gives us the ability to withstand to
[1:43:08] remain undamaged or unaffected
[1:43:11] and we're able to resist it
[1:43:13] and also when we when we have those
[1:43:16] moments of Temptation those those trials
[1:43:18] in our lives we put on the whole armor
[1:43:20] of God we put on Christ Jesus we put on
[1:43:22] the Seal of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:43:24] we recognize that we are adopted Sons
[1:43:26] and Daughters of God you've put on the
[1:43:28] whole armor of God when you recognize
[1:43:30] you've got the fruit of the spirit
[1:43:31] you've got all the fruits of the spirit
[1:43:32] you have all of Christ because he poured
[1:43:36] all of Christ into the church it's not a
[1:43:39] portion we're not talking about a
[1:43:41] halfway religion a so far religion we're
[1:43:44] talking about the manifestation of the
[1:43:45] word is what brother Branham said here
[1:43:47] and we're able to remain undamaged or
[1:43:50] unaffected by it we can resist Satan we
[1:43:53] can actually quench all of the fiery
[1:43:55] darts of the wicked one that's what the
[1:43:57] word says when we put on the whole armor
[1:43:59] of God not just most of the darts or
[1:44:01] some of the darts but all of the fiery
[1:44:03] darts
[1:44:04] that's tremendous and the second the
[1:44:07] second definition for withstand is to
[1:44:10] offer strong resistance or opposition to
[1:44:13] not just remain undamaged we've been
[1:44:15] playing chess a little bit and uh it's
[1:44:17] just a wonderful thing because you look
[1:44:19] at it and you can you can be on the
[1:44:21] defense and on the defense and on the
[1:44:22] defense but there comes a time where you
[1:44:24] can say I'm tired of running around and
[1:44:26] being defensive I can actually be
[1:44:27] offensive and say no I have power too I
[1:44:31] can actually start to move my men in and
[1:44:33] push the enemy out of the way
[1:44:35] we don't have to be slapped around by
[1:44:36] the devil if he's coming around Brothers
[1:44:38] and Sisters Let's just examine let's
[1:44:40] just take inventory let's go through our
[1:44:42] lives let's go through our homes let's
[1:44:44] confess our faults one to another and
[1:44:46] pray for one another because then we
[1:44:47] know how to pray and you know what we'll
[1:44:49] be healed that's what the word says we
[1:44:52] can look at
[1:44:53] 2012 and and see so many times the Lord
[1:44:56] Has Come on the scene in our lives in
[1:44:58] our homes and our families and and
[1:45:00] personally in our businesses in school
[1:45:02] and everything that we do he's always
[1:45:04] with us and he's helped us so many times
[1:45:06] but he's got more for us brothers and
[1:45:08] sisters there's more for us we know that
[1:45:11] the word says when that squeeze comes
[1:45:13] watch it it'll be a short powerful work
[1:45:15] a short powerful demonstration we're not
[1:45:18] looking for signs and wonders we're
[1:45:19] looking for the word we're going to put
[1:45:21] the word of God first in our homes and
[1:45:23] everything else will follow when the
[1:45:25] Devil comes knocking and tries to tell
[1:45:26] us oh your children have this terrible
[1:45:29] illness and you just have to accept it
[1:45:31] you can say I can hear the rattles in
[1:45:33] that box and you can take it back I'm
[1:45:35] not going to accept that because I know
[1:45:37] that I've gone through my house I know
[1:45:39] that I'm in a righteous position and if
[1:45:41] you see fit for us to walk through this
[1:45:43] trial then be it unto me according to
[1:45:45] Thy word because you can touch this
[1:45:47] flesh but you will never touch my soul
[1:45:51] we've got to be able to have that
[1:45:52] Assurance in our lives
[1:45:54] the only way we're going to do it is to
[1:45:56] crucify the flesh
[1:45:57] to die out to ourselves to follow Christ
[1:46:00] as Paul followed Christ follow Christ as
[1:46:03] brother Branham followed Christ be
[1:46:06] willing to just lay ourselves down and
[1:46:08] say it doesn't matter what happens in
[1:46:09] this life
[1:46:10] because he can't touch my soul
[1:46:14] what's the biggest thing that we contend
[1:46:15] with is fear of death as humans that's
[1:46:18] the biggest thing you know when people
[1:46:20] are actually about to expire when an
[1:46:22] animal is about to expire you can see
[1:46:25] their bodies gasping trying for that
[1:46:27] last breath but it's just the flesh it's
[1:46:30] just this body you know who we are here
[1:46:32] is who we will be there that's why we
[1:46:34] need to work it out now we don't want to
[1:46:36] try and go to the other side and work it
[1:46:38] out that'll never happen death only
[1:46:40] changes our Dwelling Place it doesn't
[1:46:42] change our character at all that's why
[1:46:44] we need to make sure we've got his
[1:46:45] character in our lives and I tell you
[1:46:47] that shaking that trembles me that that
[1:46:50] makes me shudder to think Lord have
[1:46:53] mercy because I got work to do there's
[1:46:55] things in my life that I don't want to
[1:46:57] have over there and I hope that somehow
[1:46:59] they'll be gone by the time I get there
[1:47:01] but but I just trust that the Lord won't
[1:47:03] allow it to to travel with me over there
[1:47:07] he's working on every one of us isn't
[1:47:09] that wonderful that little song they
[1:47:10] sing in Sunday school he's still working
[1:47:12] on me
[1:47:13] he is every one of us he's still working
[1:47:16] on every one of us and we need to have
[1:47:17] that Grace one for another and be able
[1:47:20] to submit ourselves therefore one to
[1:47:21] another we talked about that extensively
[1:47:24] if we want to talk about our husbands
[1:47:25] being in his position a wife being in
[1:47:27] her position and children being in their
[1:47:28] position the very first part of that
[1:47:30] that Paul talks about in Ephesians first
[1:47:32] before any of the roles is submit
[1:47:35] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[1:47:38] God
[1:47:39] that's the most important thing then he
[1:47:41] talks about wives then he talks about
[1:47:42] husbands then he talks about the
[1:47:44] children but don't do any of it until
[1:47:46] you're willing to submit yourselves unto
[1:47:47] God first we talked about this as well I
[1:47:50] just think it's so powerful you know we
[1:47:52] want communion the last two messages
[1:47:53] that brother Branham preached was
[1:47:55] leadership and then communion it's no
[1:47:57] accident that that's what happened
[1:47:59] before he went off the air there's a
[1:48:01] reason for that if we want communion
[1:48:03] with God true communion with the Lord
[1:48:05] Jesus Christ we've got to be willing to
[1:48:07] be led but there's some people they're
[1:48:09] just not willing to accept Ephesians
[1:48:11] chapter 4 and we know that it's a strong
[1:48:13] spirit it's a spirit of delusion and the
[1:48:15] Lord said that I'll send a spirit of
[1:48:17] delusion in the last days there's people
[1:48:19] that won't want to follow the word of
[1:48:21] God
[1:48:22] but that's where we have to say you know
[1:48:24] like uh the disciples said is is he the
[1:48:28] one that's going to be here he's gonna
[1:48:29] see you're coming and Jesus said what is
[1:48:32] that to you
[1:48:33] follow thou me
[1:48:34] it doesn't matter what anyone else is up
[1:48:36] to we want to encourage our brothers and
[1:48:38] sisters but this is an individual walk
[1:48:39] we've got to make sure that we're
[1:48:41] working out our own salvation with fear
[1:48:43] and trembling is what the word says and
[1:48:45] I say my goodness I fear and I tremble
[1:48:48] when I think about this character if
[1:48:49] I've got to drag this character over
[1:48:51] there Lord have mercy there's work to do
[1:48:53] here on this side I really want to get
[1:48:55] that worked out and I'm not joking I'm
[1:48:57] just a human being I'm just a man
[1:48:59] goodness but everyone is when they're in
[1:49:02] their office aren't they the wives are
[1:49:04] just human wives the husbands are just
[1:49:07] human husbands the children are just
[1:49:09] children and you know brother Branham
[1:49:11] said it in our study I think it's so
[1:49:12] beautiful sometimes we can look at
[1:49:14] children and say oh those are Renegades
[1:49:16] brother Branham said don't you do that
[1:49:19] our children are the best children on
[1:49:21] the planet
[1:49:22] because they get the word of God they
[1:49:24] get the true word of God and for anyone
[1:49:27] to ever be in and around this message of
[1:49:29] the hour and to say that they're not my
[1:49:31] children because they're tarnishing my
[1:49:33] image they're they're they're coming out
[1:49:35] of against my family idols
[1:49:37] it's terrible to think that people would
[1:49:40] do that they would rather actually
[1:49:41] sacrifice their children for their image
[1:49:44] than actually throw themselves down in
[1:49:48] the way throw themselves in the breach
[1:49:49] just like the prophet did for the people
[1:49:51] remember we talked about it Moses did it
[1:49:53] in his day Jesus the Lord said to him
[1:49:56] out of the pillar of fire step aside I'm
[1:49:58] gonna just destroy these people I'm sick
[1:49:59] and tired of their murmur and every time
[1:50:00] we do something good for them they get
[1:50:02] delivered and then they get lacks they
[1:50:03] get fat and lazy and they just start to
[1:50:05] murmur about all of the troubles that
[1:50:07] they're going through and they forget
[1:50:08] that they were once slaves but they're
[1:50:10] now free remember brother Bradham in the
[1:50:12] Tabernacle he had the spirit of the Lord
[1:50:15] write it out on the on the wall in the
[1:50:17] last Church age there would be no light
[1:50:19] but the prophet once again goes into the
[1:50:21] breach for the people to say no Lord
[1:50:24] there's going to be one sliver of like
[1:50:25] there's going to be one tiny group of
[1:50:27] people
[1:50:28] scarcely a dozen people out of this age
[1:50:31] that will actually go in the rapture
[1:50:34] wow that's frightening
[1:50:37] you know I'm just going to close with
[1:50:38] this one scripture I'll call the
[1:50:40] musicians
[1:50:42] or I'll keep going
[1:50:44] Luke chapter 6.
[1:50:46] if you want to turn there
[1:50:48] Luke chapter 6 verse 4 verse 46 of Luke
[1:50:53] chapter 6.
[1:50:55] Jesus talking to his disciples
[1:51:07] he says to him and why call ye me
[1:51:13] Lord Lord
[1:51:15] and do not the things which I say
[1:51:20] verse 47 Luke chapter 6 whosoever cometh
[1:51:23] to me
[1:51:25] and heareth my sayings and doeth them
[1:51:28] I will show you
[1:51:30] to whom he is like
[1:51:33] he's like a man
[1:51:35] which built a house and digged deep
[1:51:39] and laid the foundation on a rock
[1:51:43] and when the flood arose the stream beat
[1:51:46] vehemently upon that house
[1:51:48] and could not shake it
[1:51:50] for it was founded upon a rock
[1:51:54] when the flood came
[1:51:57] verse 49 but he that heareth and doeth
[1:52:01] not
[1:52:03] is like a man that without a foundation
[1:52:05] built a house upon the Earth
[1:52:07] against which the stream did beat
[1:52:09] vehemently
[1:52:12] and immediately it fell
[1:52:14] and the ruin of that house was great
[1:52:19] to me this just spoke to me when the
[1:52:21] enemy comes in like a flood
[1:52:23] the spirit of God raises up a standard
[1:52:25] against him
[1:52:27] but only if we build it on a rock and
[1:52:31] that rock has got to be the rock of
[1:52:32] revelation of the message of this hour
[1:52:35] the word of God for our day what was
[1:52:37] given to us through Malachi 4.
[1:52:40] Revelations 10 7 sunset Mountain the
[1:52:43] pillar of fire the seals the Thunders
[1:52:47] all of it packaged together was to
[1:52:50] recognize that we have full Authority
[1:52:52] and power we don't have to be subject to
[1:52:54] Satan no time no how we have full
[1:52:58] Authority and power fully adopted Sons
[1:53:00] and Daughters of God in the day in which
[1:53:01] we live and when the enemy comes in like
[1:53:03] a flood brothers and sisters God has
[1:53:05] already raised you up as a standard
[1:53:08] against it stand with me tonight if you
[1:53:10] will
[1:53:12] build our houses
[1:53:13] on the rock of Revelation on a solid
[1:53:16] foundation and when that flood comes in
[1:53:19] it's gonna beat vehemently against that
[1:53:22] house against our families against our
[1:53:25] churches
[1:53:26] even against
[1:53:28] the Revelation that we've got of the
[1:53:30] word for our day
[1:53:33] but it won't touch us if we get it built
[1:53:35] right
[1:53:37] let's just go to him in prayer tonight
[1:53:38] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:53:40] for your word
