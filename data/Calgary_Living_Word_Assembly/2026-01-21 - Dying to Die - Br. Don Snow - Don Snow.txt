Description:
Yahweh put a seed deep in my heart,
Didn’t look like much at the start.
No bright lights, no open door,
Just quiet life growing more.

I’m learning how to die well, Lord,
Lay my life down to Your will, Lord.
Like a chopped timber I fall,
So The Word may live—that’s all.

That seed grew up by grace alone,
Found its way through flesh and bone.
It bore much fruit along the way,
Fed the hungry, helped them stay.

I’m learning how to die well, Lord,
Lay my life down in Your will, Lord.
Not my name, not any fame,
Only Jesus—the very same.

Now the season’s changed, I see,
Your life asks more of me.
To let go, to not hold tight,
To choose the dark before the light.

I’m learning how to die well, Lord,
Knowing you are with me, Lord.
A seed don’t die to end the story,
It dies bringing You glory.

So every day I lay it down,
In little deaths that make no sound.
When I forgive, when I stay low,
When love’s the only thing I know.

I’m learning how to die well, Lord,
Spend my life like You did, Lord.
If they see anything in me,
Let them see You clearly.

When the night feels long and near,
Still I rest without fear.
What You bury, You will raise,
Life comes out of dying ways.

I’m learning how to die well, Lord,
Fall like wheat into Your field, Lord.
When my time is finally gone,
May you live in others on.

Simply a seed in Your hand,
Just the life You planned.
I will fall, I will trust,
Dying well… because I must.

Lord, &gt;&gt; for your mercy never fails me. All my days I'm in hell in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my hands. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. Oh yes. All my life you have been faithful. Yes, you have, Lord. Oh, all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I have made, oh I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. Oh, you have led me through the fire. In darkest night, you were close like no other. So true, Lord. I've known you as my father, known you as my friend, and I have been in the goodness of God. Oh yes. All my life you have been faithful. Oh my you have me so so good with every breath that I am able. Oh I will sing of the goodness of God. Oh yes your goodness is running after. It's running after me. Your goodness is running after running after me with my life laying down. I surrender now. I give you everything. Your goodness is running after. It's running after me.
