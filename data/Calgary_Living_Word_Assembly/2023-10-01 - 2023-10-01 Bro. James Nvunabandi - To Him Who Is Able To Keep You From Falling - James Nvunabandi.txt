they were finishing their second service and it was in the evening uh if it were if it was not that the rupture will be General that means we would go ahead of you we would go ahead of you but we give thanks uh nobody will leave another right so uh it is quite a while when I was here but you have been on my mind Hallelujah I had the pastor announc Stella I don't know which Stella is he the Stella I knew 15 or 20 years ago yeah you look the one yeah I'm glad to see you Anthony I'm glad to see you I remember the first time I came to kigar that was 2006 or something like that he's the one who came to pick me at the bus stop because I I I came with a bus from Edmonton and I I remember the hospitality he gave me you know uh you can for forget everything but you never forget somebody who solved the problem for you because a problem solved creates Bond so uh I thank God who who have given me an opportunity again to to be around before you as we worship Him and glorify his name uh thank you Pastor who have opened the door you know the pastor is the door to the ship if he opens then we come if it does not open who can enter so uh the pastor to give me a CH to trust me that I speak to his people that is also a great privilege Pastor thank you I know my accent either it is yours which is a problem to me but this time Let It Be Mine which will be a problem to you so uh I won't uh preach I will just go through uh just go through and we go along as we share the word of God I believe what we are going to share at least it will help somebody I don't know if if it does not help anyone among you at least it will help me yeah I want to keep uh to to pick uh from the book of Jude you know Jud is one chapter uh then it will be uh verse 24 these are notes that have been keeping for many years but when I was coming and it was like Lord what will I share with your people I packed also these notes they are familiar schooles if you have ever heard them remember this don't ever get used to the word of God each day is fresh in itself so Jude chapter it is one chapter verse 24 uh when you go to read the the whole chapter is talking about those who back those who fail those who enter to disrupt to create chaos and everything he's speaking about defending the faith that was once delivered to the Saints you know when you hear about to come on defend you know there is there is there is a war and we are Christians we were recruited to fight you know God is not calling is not recruiting babies he's recruiting soldiers uh we are not expected always to to to cry to to to always I I was telling somebody that you know when you meet a situation uh you are meant to overcome that situation that's is not a time to wh oh God oh God come and help me God come and help me you know when you cry a lot then God says okay on my back then you thank God oh God has rescued me no you you have simply failed God has seen that you have simply failed he carries you on the back but remember that situation is still there that's right you meet it again because you are trained to overcome that's why it says there is a message why cry speak you have to Transit from a crying period to a speaking period so now Jude continues uh we can probably start on verse 20 but you dear friends by building yourselves up in your Most Holy Faith and praying in the Holy Spirit keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life be merciful to those H out save others by snatching them from the fire to others show Mercy mixed with fear hating even the clothings stand by the corrupted flesh to him who is a able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy to the only God our savior be glory Majesty power and authority through Jesus Christ Our Lord before all ages now and forever more amen you can sit down yeah I want to take a heading just a thought uh uh to to to give ourselves the direction it is from these few words to him who is able to keep you from falling before God you can back slide a million times but there is one thing sure you will never fall because there is him who will keep you from falling and at the end of the day he will present you before his glorious presence without fault and with grow Joy that's the God we serve as I said it also strengthens me it reminds me of many things since I believed the message now it is 40 years 43 years to be exact behind the ppit in the message of the 60 years I have been on this Earth a big part of it have been in the message and especially behind the parit so as has progress you are on a highway you are figure yourself on a highway you see on the highway there are vehicles that are meant to be cruising CRC Crossing one another but as you move you come across a wreck and another it took a situation for that thing to happen for a wck to happen but as you Cruise along and you come across one know that that r or so would enjoy to be on the highway moving but something happened now as you move along you will know that there are WS also you know facts are facts they are stubborn they are real but as you move in this Journey of Faith you will know that somebody kept me from being a wck yes you have spoken many things we have heard many things we have seen many things we have witnessed many things but one thing is sure we are still standing in the church or in the area somebody you give respect somebody you give owner somebody who looked like a role model finally he back slides finally he's fallen from Grace then is my who is me if so and so can do like this what is me the answer is he who can keep you from falling it is just a message of encouraging you as we encourage ourselves that is what is meant today in the message things that are to be I want to quote something if you would ex if you would uh uh allow me to quote it uh things that are to be it was preached on 50th uh December 65 paragraph 39 you know you grow from your birth when you was born and presented into this world God knew that you were going to be here in this earth and as you growed from birth to maturity things that seemed so strange to you in in your young Womanhood young Boyhood as children now seems very real you couldn't understand it when you was a child but now as you become a child as you become an adult you begin to understand and find out that everything was just set just right SC which has become real to you eventually you recognize that salvation belongs to God he's he's only the one who holds the franchise of eternal life you know we human beings make God more strict hard to enter by our set of rules by the way we set the bar but eventually we realize that is not the way we take it but it is the way God has it in Mother's Day there is where brother Bram says that when we reach there we will find people we never expected to be there because simply they are there and you not question how they are there because you eventually discover that you yourself you are there by Grace it is only somebody who kept you from falling if you would ask St when he saw Paul that younger man who stood there and gave right those who stoned him to Steven Paul was a mler really he deserved not to be a St messenger in heaven but now they meet Steven is a Believer and Paul is a St messenger then you begin to real realize what it means by faith Able by faith Enoch by faith Abraham you see those people in the Hall of Fame while it is true we cannot be able we cannot be Enoch we cannot be Abraham but the good thing is we serve the same God Amen The God Who made able succeed is the god who is telling you today that you are able also and it is not by your power it is not by your might but he who can keep you from falling a and is able to present you to himself you will remember this also will come to reality that really God does not call the perfect but he perfects the Cod amen you will know that God does not call the holy but he sanctifies the cold yeah as you mature you look along the highway you see many things others you cannot explain you see you cannot you cannot understand God but you consol yourself that somebody is keeping me alive then you will understand what it means that he who started a good thing in me will will finish it because you didn't start it yourself it is not the pastor who started it it is not your mother who started it amen but eventually you discover that you are in the journey when you go to see your address how did you get saved you just shake your head it simply has to be God and because you didn't call yourself and you didn't pay to be called then you know what means that he who started that good work will finish it because God did not call you to destroy you God does not work that way God called you for a purpose and he is patiently waiting for you to recognize your assignment because you are not God's plan B you are not God's plan C you are always God's plan a you were created and called in the church to solve a specific problem and that specific problem is what we call you assignment and it is only in your assignment that all your blessings that all you need are waiting for you they are waiting for your arrival and when you arrive there all you are needs will be activated yes you understand what it means that it is not he who Wills but is God who shows favor you will know what a favor means because you are favored of God God as we talk about favor let me read something for you concerning favor fav you know I was listening to the message uh brother Bram titled that message Shalom which means peace and who is pronouncing Shalom it is God God pronouncing Shalom to a certain type of people he does not pronounce it to everybody no according to brother Bram it says to the elected lady yeah to to you and me come on brothers and sisters true God is an object of of worship is that right but that he is an object of worship he does not accept the worship of everybody know that he does not is not that a cheap to accept the worship of everybody if you want a scripal answer for that it is this young man who came running to Jesus master I will follow you where you go I will go do you know what Jesus answered he said foes and birds don't have ha to Nest you know the story foxes don't have this and that in other words he was rejected and the Bible says Jesus turned to another one and said you come follow me now this one says okay master I have heard but I have my father to BU Jesus says come on follow me Let the dead bu their own dead what do we learn from that one is offering himself for service and is rejected another one is not even interested but he's being compelled amen that is what a fa does favor is an act of kindness performed or granted out of Goodwill favor is an approving friendly of supportive attitude favor is a preferential treatment shown to somebody it is simply a token of of royality something given as a token of love alleen or Good Will favor is a gift it is an advantage to the benefit of someone or something favor is Grace favor is simply you didn't make Merit it but simply given it favor is the shortcut to an uncommon success favor gives you in a day what another one takes the whole lifetime and many times does not even get but for you in a spirit second you get it that's what a favor is favor eliminates all years of pain and struggle it is simply there you finally realize that there is somebody who is making you compatible to Heaven you don't know what heaven looks like but there is a power inside you that is molding you that is working from the inside making you compatible to heaven and who is that he who is able to keep you from falling and to present you Fortress before his presence the presence of his Glory with exceeding Joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and Majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen now we overcome by our Angelic resistance I want you to to mark that if you are Angel because we are given Revelation that as long as you are a son of God you are given a guiding angel in questions and answers 30th August 64 questions and answers for this was a question question that was asked explain about each person's Angel who abides with them from birth this is what brother Bram answers now this is pretty deep now there is an angel but this Angel of the Lord that are encamped about those that fear that fear Him you see now it isn't promised that a Sinners has Angels it is only the redeemed has Angels did you know that the angels of the Lord encamp about those that fear [Applause] Him I love that don't you now we overcome by the Angelic resistance because if you are a child of God you were represented in heaven your angel was there and was tempted but never fail is that right the angel was there was tempted but is not included in the a thir that went with the devil now he is here with you as you move whether conscious or unconscious when Temptations come he's there to guide you to guide you not to fall you can recall you see these are things we don't even speak out if it is a man this is something you have never told your wife if it is a woman this is something you have never told your husband and you will not tell him but you reach the certain situation where when you look back you are going to do something terrible but you cannot know even why and how you escaped it it is simple your angel was there am your angel was there because God knows you you see this is the other side of God even Lucifer didn't know you know you as a human being you have side a and side B you see we always look at side B of another individual but not God God always sees his side a there is something new that always excites God he will never see your negativity but is only we human beings who always see the negative part because to God even the prodal son was still a son it is the brother who was complaining you see father I have been with you and you have never even killed a c for me the son when he was coming back he knew he didn't have anything in the palace he only came to ask to be a servant but once a son always a son when he came expecting nothing the father had kept a ring for him the father had kept another L for him the father had kept good shoes for him because the prodal he was still a son that Brothers of Joseph tormented him and solded him to Egypt didn't stop them from being his brothers tormentas yes potential Killers yes but they still remained his brothers now if you remember how narrowly you escaped from committing sin you stop to wonder because it is simple he who can keep you from falling was simply there am Psalms 91 will be quickened in your life because it is where he says he will send his angels to guide you they are there to guide you now that's what I'm saying that if that angel that represents you resisted the devil then it will warn you look at John in the Book of Revelation with all those Mighty revs when he looks at that woman on the horse the Bible says he marved the real translation says he really enjoyed but look where the angel says come on John be careful be careful that a woman you have enjoyed let me tell you the secret about her come on Brethren you may wonder why why do we why do we need to learn about the Serpent's Seed it is simple when God reveals you The Master about the serpent seed he's simply telling you you are not the serpent seed when God reveals to you masteron he's simply telling you you are not under that system and he who can keep you from falling that's why he reveals to you the mysteries of the Kingdom because you are the only one that has the potentials of understanding them because he says the reason why I speak in pares it is I don't want them to understand because if they can understand they will believe and I will save them but I don't want to save them but to you I have given you the ability to understand the messies of the [Applause] Kingdom because I'm building you to be compatible with the kingdom why are you told that don't lie don't lie don't lie it is because there is no lying there yeah don't steal don't steal don't steal if you would go there with that that stealing demon the streets of Heaven are gold you cause trouble there I want to quote you another quote it is from questions and answers again simply means you your life proves what you are questions and answers preached on third January 54 paragraph 78 says as I said in the beginning what you are somewh El is what you reflect here what you are what you oral body is up yonder what your Cal body is somewhere else is what you are reflecting back here in the spirit world what you are is what you are here if you are still vgar minded and so forth in the spirit land you are VG minded here if you still got Mar Envy Strife you are in the spirit land with that it reflects back here but if your whole innermost being has has become cleansed and purged it shows that you've got a body out yonder waiting that has been cleansed and pged and it is reacting Back In the Flesh don't you see there it is if this Earth Tabernacle is dissolved we we have got one already waiting that is also powerful now as you continue as you mature because as long as you are a seity maturity is not an option it is a must and at maturity there is no counterfeiting you are simply what you are you cannot duplicate maturity in the parable of the seed and the S when the servants came to the master and said Master do you know what we are going to do let us go and PR out those evil ons the master says be careful because in doing that you can also PR out the innocent and the good ones but let them mature because at maturity you are shown exactly what you are the only problem the seed does not want to recognize because if the Bible says let the evil be evil I mean when you see somebody being evil in the evening time don't get scared he is meant to be that just thank God that he has kept you and you are not that evil when you see somebody acting and seemingly yeah this is the maturity time don't get surprised it is meant to be so you cannot fast it out you cannot pray it out you only thank God that he made you what you are you know in Uganda we we we mut in buses here probably you are in ples and I don't know but now when you get a ticket what I want to know to find out is can this ticket allow you to enter the bus and when the bus pulls over on the bus stop you make sure you jump in the bus when you jump in the bus mind you are standing where you are standing immediately you enter in thank God that you are already in don't look around to other Travelers amen you didn't create the bus you didn't put there the way your assignment is enter and go to your position that's all let the bus continue its Journey it will invite in other passengers it will drop others he who can keep you from falling will take you to your [Applause] destination then you continue to understand what Jesus meant in John 17:2 that while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that you gave me I have kept and none of them is lost but only the sign of petion that the scrup might be fulfilled if the spirit in in Paul says in later days terrible times will come you will not discern those terrible times on trees it will be on human beings then you understand John 6:39 what means and and this is the Father's will which has sent me that all which he has given me I should lose nothing but should rise it up again at the last day that's why he had to go for Peter really Peter betrayed Jesus betrayed him at at the moment Jesus needed somebody to confort him as I I told you earlier you can forget everything but you never forget somebody who solved your problem Jesus needed somebody to stand by him I was speaking some where about mob Justice you know you have your own problems here in Canada when I talk about mob Justice there is no mob Justice here but when you go to Uganda oh we see a lot of them uh I may not explain why there is Mob justice but finally people say we will take this into our own hands we are not waiting for the government now there is one rule in mob Justice because they are ready to kill you and they are determined to do it if one among those people who are ready to kill you stands and says but let us first wait let us first understand you are saved completely you saved because they are already divided remember when the San were talking about Jesus they all had one thing in common until one man stood and said by the way does our Ro allow us to condemn somebody without first hearing him do you know what the Bible says they turned to him and said ah come on tell us are you also from from his PR and the Bible says they passed so Jesus needed Peter and Peter betrayed him three times if it was you and me friendship completely cut off friendship completely but no he who can keep you from falling Peter had already resigned boys let us go back to our usual jobs we had a vision and the vision be is no longer there let us go back at fishing remember signs that you are going to back right when you start dreaming what I used to do before you got saved know that that is one of the frags do you hear that when you start dreaming you see pictures of what I used to do before you came to Jesus Christ those are wors of the red frags so Peter is already on the sea as he was there I don't know what he was thinking about then somebody's the shore on the coast boys is there anything you know the story finally he recognizes his master he had come for Peter Peter do you love me three times Peter do you love me he is calling Peter back because the assignment the assignment of Peter despite his whatever he did had the Keys of the Kingdom talk about a friend you see Jesus is a true friend Jesus is a true friend you see there are three things in life that we need in this Christian walk and one is God you see one is is the holy ghost that Jesus he does not need any information about you he knows you before he created you he KN he knew you so nobody can talk against you before him then another thing what are you then another thing your assignment so Jesus goes and brings back a Peter who was already going away then one day the disciples are in the boat with Jesus I hope up to now my accent is not a problem atast then Jesus tells the disciples come on move the boat to this direction move it he said Master do you know where we are going yeah move but there is a mad man there and always ston people come on move because this mad man also is the seed of God live around the madness live around the situation you are in the God we serve is bigger than the situation you are in the God we serve is bigger than the Glorious that is standing in your way the God we serve is bigger than the Red Sea that is cutting across where you are passing come on continue move the boat by the time they are reaching the shore the m is there but when Jesus comes closer that what was inside the mad man recognized that this guest now that is coming a is a different guest you know the story The Mad Man was delivered he who can keep you from falling am amen make sure that you have the Holy Ghost Inside you because sickness can come situations can come but remember this somebody is in control amen now Jesus loved the hars no wonder the bread of Jesus Christ is typed with lahab the harod lahab the harod types the Bride of Jesus Christ but I'm going to talk about these three other women of ill famed life and how Jesus went for them one day Pastor Jesus is conducting a service of healing as the church was in progress here comes the Pharisees the message Believers of the day they pull a poor old woman poor woman they don't even recognize the church order because the Bible says they brought the poor woman to the ppit and here they say uhuh we have got him you know how we message Believers make it complicated for women we are busy telling women don't do this don't do this don't do this don't do this the list is very wrong until if we are not careful we are Muslims already right the only thing that's remaining is putting a curtain in between but we never tell women what they can do what they can do what they can do because there is a lot they can do also so they bring the poor woman defenseless they never brought a man right so to beginning with there was no justice but that is the way of the Pharisees so now the woman is there whatever Jesus was writing down was making an impact on the Pharisees you know these are the group of people that never repent they never repent don't expect the Pharisee to repent because he is meant not to repent so now they go one by one and the woman is left there alone woman nobody has condemned you yes my Lord then Jesus says neither will I condemn you but he adds something go and do it no more you go to the original it says go and I give you ability not to do it anymore when God delivers you he delivers you completely total Deliverance that's what means total Deliverance yes only it depends on how you receive what you have is not what God intends for you it is only what you are able to receive what you are able to receive is what only works for you if you could could only realize that more is for you what God gave Israel they haven't even conquered even a million because their boundaries is in ifhr River they are still so the woman is saved he who can keep you from falling they they brought the woman to be stoned he left Jesus's feet delivered they were three of of them I'm going very slow now two are remaining then one day a Pharisee again invites Jesus Jesus I'm inviting you to my house when Jesus is invited he always keeps his appointment amen yes whether you want to abuse him whether you want to make fun of him he keeps his appointment see Jesus in Simon's house read between the lines he knew that there is another harot that is coming and needed Deliverance you may be here and you need Deliverance also he who can keep you from falling there is Deliverance for you you just reach out then that woman I don't know probably he she's attracted by the aroma of the food expensive food whatever but he comes by there he is she is on Jesus's feet look at Simon uhuh didn't I tell you to the fellow pastors if that man was a prophet he would know who that woman you know we know that we are taught that you don't receive an offering of har don't we but here Jesus is accepting everything the har is bringing think about that then Jesus says Simon I have a word for you you called me and I am here you made fun of me and there is no problem but look at this woman you cannot even accept her TI you cannot even accept her her her offering because that's how we are taught but since she reached here see what she has been doing woman your sins which are many are now forgiven he who can keep you from falling will forgive you whatever Hep of sins that is on you because that harot woman had representation in [Music] heaven probably she entered that business because of severe situations but when God looks at her it wasn't so from the [Music] beginning you see you are a triun a tri a three a triun figure there is a way you know yourself really when you sin you don't sin in a vision when you sin you don't sin in a dream when you sin you sin and you know you have done it then there is a way people know you whether you want it or not you you don't invite them to know you that way they simply know you that way and then there is the way God knows you Paul one day say I blasphemed ananas go gets a vision you go into a street called this one there is a man called Saul what a type of vision is this Lord we know we have heard about that man that he's a killer and the mission why he has come into this town is to grab us and take us into prison and kill us he's a killer God says okay you know he's a killer but for me he is my vessel so the way God knows you is the most important not what you know about yourself not what others know about you I was saying elsewhere that look here never try to please everybody because you never please everybody you are not created to please everybody there are people you will never please no matter how much you try you are simply wasting your time not that they are bad people they are not it is simple they were not put into your life chain you are not assigned to them so while you are wasting time trying your L best to pleas X why is waiting for your arrival and when you arrive into wise life everything of his is activated so now another woman is delivered because that or so is represented in heaven then one remaining the sun FS he has to pass through a city called cyle because the Revelation is the son cannot do anything unless the father shows him he is surrounded by message Believers again do you know why I said that when he knows Jesus Pastor Jesus that is now approaching to a woman says come on guys go back into the city to buy the provisions remember when they came back you know what the Bible says they marveled because he was speaking to a woman but they never questioned him but the pastor is speaking to a woman you see women are are made in such a way that when a Revival is going to Break Forth they are the first to respond they are created in such a way that they respond to B and that's one of the qualities you see as the church here you have everything you need to start a Revival I know I know I know I know that the prophet said that the Revival is over in America and Canada I know that but don't create it into a mediocre something that God is not moving in America and Canada God is here you are a moving Revival God is here you are a moving seed inside you is everything that is needed to activate the move of the Holy Ghost Inside you oh the Revival is over you see we cannot we we cannot do this who told you you give it a chance and see give give it a chance and see if God cannot move [Applause] here give a chance a seed which is inside you and see if it cannot germinate you see you see we cannot testify you see you need wisdom who told you that testifying is about going on the street with loud speakers no there are many ways wisdom is the ability to know the difference you see Paul says to the Greeks I acted as Greek that means in every situation you have your way out you can testify die you can do everything there is a Revival here there is all the potentials of a Revival here am I hope I haven't hurt your feelings but I'm activating the seed inside you remember I told you the three things God then what type of seed are you but you have to put into use that seed ability that a seed capability because only when you activate the seed in you will you know your assignment so now they go to buy the the stuffs woman give me a drink you know the story go and call your husband you know the story finally the woman who would come at noon because she didn't want to involve herself with the community she's running to the community says come and see a man isn't he the Messiah he's the only one Jesus would say I am he he couldn't say it direct to to the governor no he couldn't say it to the Pharisees direct no but this is the human being whomes saying I am the Messiah you know when God loves you he reveals himself to [Applause] you look at Jesus hanging on the cross it is the sixth hour all the pain and anguish all the TOs and everything and now passes another pass have you ever recognized that Jesus was only waiting for one Thief there to recognize who he is condemned by the society he had already condemned himself because finally he says come on my fellow Thieves for us we are here hanging here because of what we did we deserve the punishment but the 3 hours I have been hanging here I recognize this man because I'm hearing from the crowd I'm hearing everywhere this man is different then he turns to him he says I'm hearing you talking about the kingdom when you reach there remember me then Jesus says it is finished he who will never lose any of his had to wait for this s to recognize who he is remember me says no no no no not only remembering you we are going together he gave up his ghost it is finished we can say many things I didn't ask you Pastor how how long I will be on the pit so I have to be very quick that's why I'm turning many pages now we come quickly to my life story this happened in brother brenham's life my life story listen you are message Believers you have listened to this many many times I started up the L again and I turned to look at this again and when it did a human voice just as audible as mine is said don't you never drink smoke or def fire your body in any way there will be a work for you to do when you get older every message believer knows where I'm reading why it liked to scare me to death you could imagine how a little pharoh felt I dropped those buckets and home I went just as hard as I could go screaming at the top of my voice now God was giving him a commission never drink Never Smoke we in the fivefold ministry we ever drunk we ever smoke we ever did many things but God who is rich in Mery is still using us but now look at brother Bram he heard that voice very clear Never Smoke never drink never do that because there is a commission do you know what he tried everything he tried to smoke he tried to drink everything we go parra6 you know you young men this is for you younger men may God help you to overcome peer pressure yes you really feel you want to fit in the society you never digitalize God no you cannot place the Eternal God into the digital system never try that because somebody is doing that does not necessarily mean that it is good peer pressure you want to fit in the society but which society so brother Bram there is a girl to her she's a super girl you know the Western cultures because in Uganda you cannot do that it is a different setting all together but they on the dating then the girl says come on have a cigarette we are all smoking the the man says I don't smoke come on what are you you don't look American you don't smoke you don't drink what do you do young man you feel you have to to be in the society no be a Christian amen the right Society is be a Christian you see it is hard for you young men because you are like a second generation or third generation look here God does not have grandchildren seek your personal experience with God only you thank God that He gave you opportunity to grow in the right home so here the whatever you call them her girlfriend is offering a cigarette I couldn't stand that I said give it to me and my hand was out I said I'll show her whether I am a s or not got that cigarette out and started to strike the match then Bram says I'm not responsible for what you think I'm just responsible for telling you the truth sorry this is a Ugandan who is who doesn't know that I'm and the fault is mine I didn't switch on the F off the Fone just forgive me and when I started to strike that cigarette just as much determined to smoke it as I am to pick up this Bible I heard something going I tried it again I couldn't get it to my mouth and I got to crying I throw the thing down then they got to laughing at me and I walked home went up through the fields sat down there crying and it was a terrible life he who will keep you from falling was there could not allow your Prophet to smoke because the instruction was was never smoke never drink but he was going to smoke then it is not yet over like I'm telling you I told you earlier that God is training soldiers he's not training wimping crying babies you face a situation then you start crying when you cry and cry and cry then God comes and says Okay jump on my back I've have come for your too come on boy you have failed the test that situation is still there is waiting for you to overcome amen one day he's having a walk probably an evening walk with his dad and dadd is talking to another man you know I have a bunch of boys and and one sis this is paragra n my dadd calling me I said hand me that bot and I pull that stoer out of the top of it determined to drink it and when I started to turn it up I handed the bot back and took off down through the fields as hard as I can crying something wouldn't let me do it you see I could I could not say I was any good I was determined to do it but it is God's grace Amazing Grace that kept me from doing those things I wanted to do them myself but he just wouldn't let me do it that is what a favor is you see when the dev goes to ause you at least once upon a time he's telling the truth this time the devil is telling the truth because you are back home fighting and he goes to report brother son so is fighting and indeed you are fighting he's expecting a straight away judgment but here you are savior you are preder you are everything you are lawyer Jesus stands up yes he is fighting but you caused it remember when Joshua the high priest was accused look at him he's wearing rugs and his high priest then the voice says no no no no no no this is a fire brand somebody snatched out of fire then he says bring cross and cross him he who can keep you from falling listen Christ is the mystery of godhead revealed of God revealed 28th July 63 the anointed man now anointed people you see already you have those three anointings the David anointings you are a priest you are a king you are a prophet in order to qualify to be a bright to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see Anointed with the word what a turned down he comes back and you accept paragraph 381 see how that hybrid condition again just exactly what he done paragraph 382 he told if don't you do this don't you do that and you can do this and that and Satan said oh you know but she turned around and listened to him then 384 but the a in the last day is not going to do it why because she's predestinated not to do it do you love that you already have that insurance you already have that assurance that you were predestinated not to do it you will you will be tempted as a for but you were predestinated not to do it you will be tempted like anything shaken trumped on everything but you were predestinated not to do it amen you see the Bible says that all the prophets who got what will happen in the end said my will anybody survive but is simple Sovereign Grace in Sovereign time he who can keep you because in every age they are Overcomers don't you think that Abraham was giving away Sarah you see your own security is in the Homeland as long as you are in the Homeland you are not going to be scared of the beauty of your wife because nobody is looking at her but outside you are home run come on come on come on Abraham was ready to give away Sarah to save his neor Sarah was already in the palace and the King was prepared to enter the room but Sarah had a specific assignment he who can keep you from falling hard to preserve Sarah King you are more than a dead man you are taking somebody else's wife God you know the Integrity of my heart it is that man who told me that it is a sister and Sarah also accepted that she is a sister they are liars I am not okay now what you're going to do you have to go to My Lying prophet and he will pray over you if not I will curse you huah see a rightous man going to a lying Prophet because the lying Prophet is the the only one that has blessings he who keeps you from falling gifts and callings are without repentance usually it is a stumbling block in the church that you find that a sister that is that God is using is again a gosper she gops the ter bear until we are told we know how we are told let me tell you God is above Church order did you hear that God is above Church order Church order is simply to those who are not led by the spirit of God so we have to have some organizational structure we we organize them somehow but when the Holy Spirit takes over you cannot organize the holy spirit so that assist in the corner God is using her but again he has side B so you have to use wisdom to know when God is doing his works and when the th is probably that ter bear needs your prayers also to overcome those demons but as sah was going but God had to protect the object he was going to use back at brother Bram in my life story as I'm winding up my life story are you picking something you see we are saved I remember that day when I was standing at a certain spot and I was holding a bottle of beer this is my testimony it was a Sunday morning that was 19 19880 then I Heard a Voice okay continue drinking as others are going to worship me since that time things changed you can go back and press your address how did you enter Did you enter by the door he who can keep you from falling he who started a good work in you amen remember the formula of Salvation is you accept Jesus when you accept Jesus you confess remember when you were drinking the day you said I accept Jesus don't think that that desire of drinking goes automatically no do you know why I said that I have G to see when a new believer comes in those old Fighters are always pointing at him or her they expect her to change instantly when them that have been decades in the message know that they are not completely changed you expect that to be an angel and you are criticizing oh he looks is not a seat come on she came in last year you were there 40 years right and you know there is something chonic inside you so he can keep you from falling he met me with a bottle of beer but today when I I even sense beer I I get headache so it is simple you confess you confess you confess finally after some time God will make your body obey your confession so it is a process look at your life is there something you have failed to overcome he who can keep you from falling will deal with it at certain point Hallelujah you keep walking knowing in mind that he never saved you to lose you some of the things he lets them there to keep you on check always remind you that you are a human being you'll never be an angel so God is not surprised because he knows he's in control oh come on this demon of lying you know you know that after 40 years in the message every time you catch yourself lying even after the baptism of the Holy Spirit you are lying you you expected that after the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are free from lying no you are still lying Abraham lied after the change of the body because when you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is not this body that received the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen because this body will never be baptized with the Holy Ghost your mind will ever always be the Battle Ground and the devil will always have access to your mind that a dog will always fight those two dogs will always fight so we go my life story I am winding up par ofra 262 this is after the death of the wife and the child of brother Bram Shon H daddy wants to see you so bad how I would like to hold you in my arms again darling little thing then I pulled off my gravs and there was 2300 VTS running right by the side of me remember the man is going to commit suicide you know brother Bram was filled with the Holy Ghost right but the Holy Ghost did not stop him from contemplating suicide that's the human side of it I said God I hate to do this I'm a coward but sh dad is going to see you and mommy just in a few minutes started pulling off my grav to put my hand on that 2300 when I came to it is to his senses I think I was sitting on the ground with my hands up like this to my face crying it was God's grace oh I wouldn't be having healing service here I am sure of the of that it was him God pro protecting his gift not me he who can keep you from falling the devil will work on you as far as God will allow him and he won't go any further he was not yet finished you know we human beings the thing goes that we walk with hob Nails nailed shoes Where Angels Fear even I started around the house he picked the mail in the house I took the mail and looked in the mail and the first thing there was har Christmas savings 80 cents Miss Shon Lo Bram oh there it was again I had been game warden I reached in there and got my gun pistol he said Lord I can't go this anymore I'm dying so tormented I pulled the hammer back on the gun put it on my head KNE there that in that dark room then I said Our Father who is in heaven he was praying HED be thy name thy kingdom come thine will be done and as I tried I squeezed that triggers I had as I could it wouldn't go off and I thought oh God you are just tearing me to Pieces what have I done you won't even let me die he want you die there is a prophecy over you as long as you are a child of God there is a prophecy over you something was spoken over you before the foundation of the world over Jeremiah it was I ordain you as a prophet to the Nations you have to realize the realization there is a prophecy over you there is a blessing pronounced over you there is an assignment you have to do and who can keep you from falling unless you come to your assignment you are not yet finished now I cannot know what is loading in your mind probably it is a frustration because many gods have come in we let down the bars and the gods came in you see we are seeing many things happening in the message it used to be I mean I don't know about here but in Uganda in ' 80s and ' 90s it used to be when they would tell you that somebody received the message you wouldn't rest until you go and see him and when you would meet him it would be love love love but things changed today when you hear about message believer it is is there thunder group is Holy Ghost is there crowd something when you are seeking shelter and you look around then you know that is not your group you make sure you curate your words and you go it wasn't so from the beginning yes but remember this he who can keep us from falling will present to himself a bride without Sport and without wrinkle do you love him may God bless you as the pastor comes and this to be my last sermon in Canada because on Tuesday I'll will be heading to Uganda the part of Africa uh may I take greetings from you may I tell them that you love them amen may God bless you maybe stand with me this morning as we close I ask brother James yesterday are you homesick and he said immediately yes I am just can't uh can't can't go away from your home your family and not miss them and we know that's the desire in the heart of every True Believer there's a longing for a place that we've never been to but we know what's home maybe just bow with me as we go to him in prayer this morning gracious Heavenly Father Lord we know this morning that we've gathered together in your name We've Come To Worship You father we've come to hear from you Lord and father now it's up to us to determine those words that we heard today were they words of a man or were they your words and if they're your words then father we have the opportunity to leave this building changed people and we know that if we reject the word then we still will change because we don't ever remain the same and we know there's only one thing that does

Father as we leave this building that we wouldn't just dismiss it and say that you know that was a great service and just go on our way but Lord that we would take it and and and maybe even go back and watch it again and and realize that you were telling us something father that you have done it all from the very beginning Lord you chose us in you before the foundation of the world Lord to be expressed here today in this age oh Father not so we would be crushed so that we would be redeemed father Lord that we could overcome by the blood of the Lamb by your very blood that you bowed your head and died oh father while you waited for that last sinner to admit that he was a sinner father then you said it's time oh lord it's finished and we know that that was so that we could have a testimony that would go along with that blood because we've taken that blood and we've applied it to our lives and to our families Lord father we love you and we thank you today for your goodness to us we know that you've done it all and father we just give you the praise and the glory Lord we ask that you would just keep your hand upon brother James that you would give him traveling mercies on the way home that you would restore his strength even before he goes Lord father that you would just bless the remaining time of Fellowship he has in Canada and we pray that you would just Lord be with his family be with his church the congregation there father Lord until the time you reunite them we just ask Lord Jesus now that you would just accept a few words of worship on our hearts Lord as we express back to you what you've given to us already this morning we love you and we thank you we pray that you would keep your hand upon each one of us now as we go our separate ways Lord in Jesus
