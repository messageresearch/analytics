[0:44] could as we've heard sing that song over
[0:47] and over again father
[0:49] and Lord Jesus we know that there's
[0:52] coming a Time father where we heard your
[0:54] prophets say that there's coming a time
[0:56] where all of the angels are going to Bow
[0:58] their heads and take a step back to
[1:01] listen to the redeemed worship you
[1:03] father and Lord God there's a group of
[1:05] people that don't want to wait till that
[1:07] day father we have a desire that you've
[1:10] placed within us father that every time
[1:12] we hear that word it shines that light
[1:14] on that seed that you have placed inside
[1:17] of each one of your children father and
[1:19] it just grows and it grows father it's
[1:22] maturing it's changing me father from
[1:25] from the Earthly father to the heavenly

[2:31] this trial father we know that it's
[2:34] because you've allowed it lord it's not
[2:36] an accident it's not because this
[2:38] thing's out of control it's because
[2:39] you're allowing this to come to pass for
[2:41] a purpose Lord and sometimes we don't
[2:43] understand it but father what we do know
[2:45] is that we have learned to trust in you

[28:23] tonight to God the Bible said that in

[29:40] yeah God bless you welcome brother God
[29:43] bless you
[29:44] and so
[29:46] um this evening I
[29:48] just want to speak on something
[29:51] um
[29:53] somehow but
[29:56] why we keep going on you understand why
[29:59] and so this guy I want to shoot on the
[30:02] Block organism
[30:05] um myself
[30:10] go I go
[30:12] we're going to click on it this evening
[30:16] okay so
[30:17] um I work in young people uh the young
[30:20] people here
[30:22] when I want you guys to do sort of what
[30:26] we are doing tonight
[30:28] and then every time you can make sure
[30:31] you're reading the scriptures because
[30:34] the message is based on the Bible
[30:43] you're gonna help
[30:45] Embraces and descriptions and when
[30:48] people come together
[30:49] show me from the Bible we can't do
[30:52] anything because I'm like oh I love your
[30:54] way through from the Bible but
[30:56] everything is
[31:01] and one time
[31:04] foreign
[31:07] [Music]
[31:22] this is where all our life
[31:27] is uncaught upon the word of God not
[31:30] just the world but the real word of God
[31:33] because the record close
[31:36] right but when you still talk
[31:39] in this life what is written
[31:42] right and Jesus can save the world that
[31:44] I speak unto you to be experience and
[31:48] their life
[31:50] to
[31:53] um
[32:05] again John chapter one verse 4. 00
[32:12] John chapter 1 verse 4.
[32:16] so the young guys
[32:21] so yeah yeah
[32:29] I'm reading things
[32:32] for the life
[32:36] in the blood
[32:38] and I have given it to you upon the
[32:42] altar to make an atonement for your soul
[32:47] into God that make it an atonement for
[32:51] the soul
[32:56] okay
[32:58] John 1 4.
[33:02] yeah yeah
[33:05] okay because in him was life
[33:11] and the life was the life of man
[33:16] may God
[33:25] so I I want to put on the blog
[33:31] and
[33:33] sometimes uh it's kind of
[33:36] you know the basis of our region
[33:42] not good for us
[33:45] foreign
[34:15] if
[34:18] these people who don't know God
[34:23] will figure out one place invoke a demon
[34:27] and then make a continuous brothers and
[34:31] animals
[34:33] and you could walk
[34:36] and then sometimes when we want to like
[34:40] do the different kind they offer the
[34:43] blood of a human being
[34:48] to sacrifice
[34:50] even in the Bible there was a king who
[34:54] have to sacrifice his son and Israel
[34:57] have to go on how to experience
[35:01] I think because he sacrificed his
[35:05] thoughts nothing to God
[35:09] and then then there has to be something
[35:11] about blood
[35:14] that milk even
[35:16] occultic people
[35:19] to want to have something to do with
[35:21] blood
[35:23] again we also understand that when you
[35:26] come to making confidence
[35:36] and so
[35:38] whenever like
[35:41] um
[35:50] I mean so most people like in my
[35:53] community are like different people not
[35:55] like Christians
[35:58] and so
[36:01] they often refer to my family as God's
[36:06] family
[36:08] who's God fights for them
[36:12] my family
[36:13] now
[36:15] do you think being that
[36:18] a several times that
[36:20] and where I come from informed common to
[36:25] see someone who is prosperous and
[36:27] certainly know so what we mean like
[36:29] wrong it means you are a member of one
[36:32] of our caucus of scientists so when you
[36:35] belong
[36:36] and you you you you
[36:38] um extremely well do right because you
[36:41] belong
[36:43] but if you don't
[36:45] so
[36:47] your life will be extremely miserable
[36:50] and so when you come to my experience
[36:52] you will see so many
[36:55] uh market like insane
[36:58] I'm gonna tell you they have used that
[37:01] one they have to use that word they have
[37:04] to use that one so what it means is that
[37:07] somebody
[37:10] use that person to make to make wealth
[37:13] so who's alive
[37:16] but look alive
[37:22] Jesus these are people
[37:24] who don't know God
[37:27] and this is the best that you can offer
[37:31] that's all
[37:33] and so the girls who can also include
[37:36] Humanities for wealth and
[37:39] this is where this thing also came into
[37:42] Christianity
[37:46] in God is money
[37:50] all you can see is the death of Jesus
[37:52] Christ is how when you listen to God's
[37:55] life you will give you money in Google
[37:57] wealth to tell you that all that wasn't
[38:00] your mind when they come into
[38:03] Christianity not into Christ into
[38:05] Christianity was to make money
[38:08] and so
[38:09] the wrong conversion like this in the
[38:12] heart
[38:14] and you know
[38:16] so if you come to God I'm looking for
[38:18] money he will give you money
[38:24] now
[38:26] the beginning
[38:28] and so
[38:30] we're looking at grandma sister cartoon
[38:34] foreign
[39:08] between God and mind and the garden
[39:11] figure at every school of the evening
[39:14] that God came down and walk in the
[39:19] garden just to have experience
[39:22] then then something other services
[39:26] that God does not miss you
[39:31] there's something like a fellowship
[39:39] God had so much respect for Fellowship
[39:44] and so God comes down in the evening and
[39:48] then he comes to see who man who is man
[39:52] you see
[39:53] what we have in our dictionary is not
[39:56] the technical definition of man
[39:59] who is man bring on the Bible nothing
[40:03] that is created in the image of God
[40:07] that is mine
[40:09] and so
[40:10] again
[40:17] because the position of man is not built
[40:22] of making your organs no it is
[40:28] that makes you a man
[40:30] and so
[40:32] welcome God to see that man that he make
[40:37] that he makes in his own image
[40:45] not any kind of man but the man that is
[40:49] in the image of God
[40:51] and so God comes down
[40:54] and
[40:57] of England
[40:59] is just a replica of Russian God
[41:04] look like himself
[41:07] Hallelujah when God came down while he
[41:11] was looking was God looking at himself
[41:15] and so every action of man was according
[41:19] to God's perfect will because the
[41:23] original man was at every minute left
[41:26] title holy spirit amen at every Pleasant
[41:30] time who every decision of others was
[41:34] perfect
[41:36] perfect according to God
[41:39] so if I mean in other words this way it
[41:43] was a perfect meal of God and so that
[41:45] was the design
[41:47] for you to know
[41:49] the condition that we are supposed to be
[41:52] in
[41:53] but God wants to God is giving us all
[41:56] his aim is to bring us to that perfect
[41:59] condition that was lying to come to
[42:02] Christ
[42:06] in the beginning it was muscle
[42:10] that because
[42:12] that was
[42:15] oh
[42:19] when God was making man God has
[42:22] something in his mind when he was making
[42:25] man
[42:27] and
[42:28] what you are supposed to be today is
[42:32] that thing that God had in his life
[42:35] exactly
[42:38] no
[42:40] together
[42:50] I'm not trying to do to God I'm sure
[42:54] 2004
[42:56] now
[42:58] I I don't know
[43:02] and good morning good morning
[43:08] [Music]
[43:11] thank you
[43:13] mine
[43:17] oh
[43:20] when Mom came
[43:25] and told me
[43:27] God clean your man
[43:30] the field
[43:32] you know the guy who called him
[43:35] and so that is
[43:38] and so when you go when you are brother
[43:42] and your sister are you God
[43:45] oh my
[43:46] you know that's a lot of students
[43:54] manipulating you
[43:56] and that's why you gossip and that's
[43:59] wrong
[44:01] because
[44:02] the devil went behind to to tell God all
[44:06] his God the meaning of acquisition is to
[44:10] help someone black
[44:13] I thought that was what so he going to
[44:17] God to tell them that man that he said
[44:21] in making your emails have failed I
[44:23] remember God I don't know but but when
[44:26] man feels the devil's life I got them
[44:29] hey I mean because there is nothing
[44:32] again
[44:33] now this is well somehow
[44:41] you see I I was not angry him the
[44:44] highest
[44:45] I said I'm trying to explain
[44:48] I will see that when God came down the
[44:52] his gift was to smoke again
[45:02] let me read the foot
[45:04] now notice it now
[45:07] then when they realize that girl had
[45:10] seen
[45:11] and going away from God
[45:14] God had to kill some animals
[45:19] to have a food because Christ was the
[45:22] last name before the work of God
[45:25] and when he killed them and on food and
[45:29] so God was King to argument is to cover
[45:32] themselves in the skin and speak in the
[45:36] presence of God to receive the judgment
[45:38] and the internal destination
[45:41] foreign
[45:47] and God cannot look upon you without a
[45:51] problem I
[45:53] a problem in that day was blocked
[45:58] but it wasn't the king
[46:00] it was not that was said to his King
[46:05] and that is the same thing today
[46:16] this is the role of the high priest
[46:20] in the happiness that makes me
[46:23] confidential that comes down president
[46:32] to make reconciliation to kind of
[46:36] reconcile man God to God
[46:39] that was the lord of the prince
[46:47] was God himself
[46:51] amen God himself now
[46:57] when God was doing this I believe
[47:01] personally that is
[47:04] not possible
[47:06] because what God told the world today
[47:15] but how come even God you couldn't out
[47:20] of
[47:21] um out of Uganda yeah you cousin out of
[47:24] England
[47:25] God used to created a connection
[47:30] if it wasn't the man connected to you no
[47:34] because God himself still connecting
[47:37] himself back to life because of
[47:39] Fellowship
[47:48] and now this is
[47:51] getting confused
[47:54] because
[47:56] in in workbook thing all these things
[47:59] were not there
[48:01] but
[48:04] God will make us to understand that
[48:06] something happened even before the world
[48:10] ever began
[48:14] creation of man
[48:16] something happened took in place no God
[48:20] knowing that man before God has already
[48:23] made a perfect sacrifice before the
[48:27] world ends up with God
[48:31] amen and that blood can never lose his
[48:35] power
[48:38] so that is
[48:40] now we see
[48:42] that this religion can talk thank you
[48:46] it's not
[48:48] religion
[48:51] it's not something that we have to throw
[48:54] it
[48:55] because it's something that even for the
[48:58] beginning had to bring us down to
[49:01] nothing sacrifice
[49:03] right from the beginning
[49:09] now
[49:10] when God has them instead of control
[49:15] go work with him
[49:17] and talk to him in the garden
[49:24] he became a Wanderer
[49:28] the moment might not Fellowship he
[49:31] became a Wanderer
[49:34] walking around not enough to go talk
[49:37] about and that's the way a man becomes
[49:41] today
[49:42] now listen look when a man comes out and
[49:46] says to God he comes from wonderland
[49:49] bring them girls joining one cloth and
[49:52] leaving that one and drawing another
[49:55] they don't have to find him here he goes
[49:59] over to Mercedes to make all these
[50:01] productive and to constant confusing
[50:04] Holiness from plantingness logging us
[50:07] out because his love Fellowship
[50:11] sometimes
[50:14] when you see people moving up and down
[50:17] it could cause
[50:19] right in your heart will want to
[50:22] reconnect back to God
[50:26] because God has awareness that desire in
[50:29] the heart of his mind
[50:31] right because man wants Fellowship
[50:37] now
[50:39] but we've tried to substitute education
[50:42] for Fellowship
[50:44] together
[50:48] think that education will bring
[50:50] Fellowship
[50:52] education now I said this education has
[50:56] been the greatest healers the discussion
[50:59] of Jesus Christ has ever had
[51:03] okay that's how things go into Institute
[51:07] now um
[51:10] I think
[51:13] yeah open to Matthew
[51:16] chapter 11
[51:23] Matthew 11 25-27
[51:30] so uh I want
[51:37] you
[51:55] foreign
[52:07] Jesus answered and said I thank thee O
[52:11] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[52:14] because thou Hast hid these things from
[52:18] the wise and prudence and has revealed
[52:21] them to the babes even so farther for it
[52:26] seemed good in thy sight
[52:28] all things are delivered unto me of my
[52:32] father and no man knoweth the Sun but
[52:35] the father neither knoweth any man the
[52:38] father save the son
[52:40] and he to whomsoever The Sun Will Reveal
[52:44] him amen
[52:45] no
[52:47] left let me find Jesus Christ
[52:56] from the wise and the students
[53:09] and so and that is why because the the
[53:13] most educated person
[53:15] that's like look at Moses that Moses
[53:20] but when God came down God has to take
[53:22] away all good education from him
[53:27] don't have to take everything out and
[53:30] then have to put God know how to cook in
[53:33] him I mean not nothing in the world that
[53:37] Moses can walk with God now why do you
[53:40] think Canada is so far away from God
[53:42] because they want to laugh from their
[53:45] life every word of God they want to want
[53:49] to work now they want to they want to
[53:52] think out
[53:53] the local s
[53:56] and that's right work we want to explain
[53:58] everything and God will say that by sick
[54:02] we know that the things I can see we are
[54:06] made by the things that are not free how
[54:09] do we know by faith that work is safe
[54:13] is not just not believing something that
[54:16] means that something maybe to know that
[54:20] this is true
[54:24] that's no
[54:26] something something in you make you know
[54:29] that this is true
[54:31] and it could fix that in your heart
[54:35] can make me know that I'm going to Rap
[54:38] God
[54:39] yeah
[54:44] Abraham's heart that maybe not I'm going
[54:48] to have a son
[55:06] [Applause]
[55:14] everything
[55:24] amen
[55:26] and so
[55:28] why would you come to and the same thing
[55:32] to hear sometimes we ministers we want
[55:35] to educate the people
[55:37] we want to educate executive to take
[55:40] until
[55:42] we now educate them out of the world
[55:48] never came to educate anyone
[55:51] you people can't have 5 000 people I
[55:55] expect in Parables does he make sense
[55:58] the science thousand will not understand
[56:00] why people in Bangles why but yet we
[56:04] have five thousand members he never
[56:06] speak he never tried to educate them to
[56:09] explain the kingdom he speaks in
[56:11] parables and then
[56:14] because the work was not given to all
[56:17] the people that it was beginning to the
[56:20] claimed that I said marker explained
[56:22] these things to us
[56:26] because it is a horrible that reveals
[56:29] the world
[56:30] he had to open the water there and start
[56:34] revealing it to them one by one and that
[56:38] is the perfect balance right when I was
[56:41] here when I was like let's say 10 years
[56:43] it doesn't make any sense
[56:49] that one
[56:51] because it's so Dawn
[56:53] I'm going to share but now
[56:58] I can stay in one verse two hours
[57:03] I kind of start wondering if if it makes
[57:07] so much sense now
[57:09] why because there is something is trying
[57:14] to revealed the world to me catch me on
[57:17] it
[57:21] because the other person will understand
[57:25] and so it is not that he felt the user
[57:28] that it has nothing given to him yet
[57:33] all I'm better oh and I have resolution
[57:36] look that person there are things that
[57:38] he knows that I'm going to know
[57:41] and that is why when we come together we
[57:44] encourage
[57:47] amen
[57:48] no
[57:52] no
[57:53] no
[58:01] he's healing today
[58:07] I can see him detecting out of the
[58:11] presence of God
[58:12] and I started walking away local
[58:15] conditions
[58:17] now I think because
[58:20] I'm melting I can't remember
[58:23] man has never been in that condition
[58:26] ever where he was never got in favor of
[58:30] God
[58:32] so the way Adam help after the fall he
[58:36] has never ever imagined ever felt like
[58:40] that either
[58:48] bro don't speak
[58:51] when when God Called to happen
[58:55] don't say something he says
[59:00] the sick of the woman and the fruit of
[59:04] the second okay and
[59:10] improve
[59:15] to hear right
[59:18] okay Adam understand
[59:27] he wasn't working out hopelessly no
[59:31] he he walked up in Hope
[59:34] knowing that something was going to
[59:37] happen and that was why Adam
[59:41] could ever
[59:43] something happened something will happen
[59:47] and so Adam kept thinking his children
[59:51] as the government make us to understand
[59:53] that that language remained a perfect
[59:56] union
[59:58] that the Bible called that Union the
[1:00:02] forms of God
[1:00:05] why because they knew that women knew
[1:00:09] that something was to happen in the
[1:00:12] future that was to bring us back to
[1:00:15] fellowship because that is what man is
[1:00:18] the time he has the greatest thing that
[1:00:21] imagine everything else is fellowship
[1:00:24] with God
[1:00:26] no
[1:00:28] no he said
[1:00:30] God
[1:00:43] because the god record and come soon
[1:00:46] that the second of an innocent
[1:00:50] substitute
[1:00:52] so
[1:00:53] in the life of the devil that God was
[1:00:57] supposed to die
[1:00:59] go
[1:01:01] before the world ever to die God already
[1:01:04] has taken place a king smile
[1:01:09] and so
[1:01:11] the devil
[1:01:13] this is the importance of resolution
[1:01:16] that's why the prophet is saying that
[1:01:18] the um
[1:01:21] the importance of resolution in the life
[1:01:25] of a believer that can never be over
[1:01:28] emphasized no
[1:01:33] the difference
[1:01:36] you think is the reason I'm driving
[1:01:39] himself it's nothing from the Bible
[1:01:42] foreign
[1:02:08] written
[1:02:12] but
[1:02:14] a Christian who who went to School of
[1:02:17] Technology and has teenagers
[1:02:35] then you would have had no questions
[1:02:38] here on Earth today
[1:02:40] but we see that technology has swallowed
[1:02:43] up in the devil's King
[1:02:45] okay
[1:02:47] is not even of God I need the
[1:02:50] educational Clarity
[1:02:52] and so
[1:02:54] but when you put the crystals to Christ
[1:03:00] the differences
[1:03:08] look what the devil was saying was the
[1:03:11] scriptures that it was the letter and
[1:03:14] what he was saying is
[1:03:16] you will die because the letter kills
[1:03:21] but when Christ called and spoke to him
[1:03:25] what Christ was saying was life
[1:03:29] and because there is no life in the
[1:03:33] devil he cannot contain it
[1:03:38] now
[1:03:41] now if only nothing to talk
[1:03:44] if all God requires of The Sinner
[1:03:48] belonging to the truth God will be on
[1:03:52] golf
[1:03:53] 25.
[1:03:56] so both of them had himself
[1:04:00] they have
[1:04:02] they had um
[1:04:06] and so they had one of the best right
[1:04:10] guy pastors of that game
[1:04:13] they had a man who who met God they had
[1:04:16] to thank my Creator songs and everything
[1:04:19] so they had to cancel clock
[1:04:23] okay then not only that but can't come
[1:04:27] and offered in sacrifice so it is not
[1:04:30] just about going to church
[1:04:33] and next time you want to talk it is not
[1:04:36] about going to talk an awful sacrifice
[1:04:39] it is still beyond that
[1:04:43] if sacrifice once all that brought in
[1:04:46] prayers he'll be unjust condemning not
[1:04:50] only that but pain was not an incident
[1:04:54] that is pain was not and what we will
[1:04:58] call on the user that's all that was
[1:05:01] saying pain was what we say in the
[1:05:04] lesson because you it was the same
[1:05:06] castle it wasn't decent pastors okay
[1:05:10] okay
[1:05:27] it is not only the river that passed for
[1:05:31] God
[1:05:34] can you test for God does not mean you
[1:05:37] are believer that is not only the
[1:05:40] universe
[1:05:41] he now said that the business between
[1:05:44] the river and you all the user is what
[1:05:48] they use to train the test
[1:05:51] now another
[1:05:55] testing for God then he ends up as an
[1:05:59] alcoholic
[1:06:02] in an alcohol station
[1:06:04] I wasn't drinking alcohol he feels oh
[1:06:07] I'm fine now
[1:06:09] but a Christian is she themselves maybe
[1:06:12] he goes to God
[1:06:16] no no there's something more than this
[1:06:19] and then he keeps looking for God until
[1:06:24] 2017 because
[1:06:29] they have gone through evil
[1:06:32] water
[1:06:50] now
[1:06:52] what
[1:06:53] the other
[1:06:56] school have a system where he can hold
[1:07:00] on someone together again will stay
[1:07:03] there for a while
[1:07:07] he said that when you think of this
[1:07:10] water
[1:07:11] is that you will never test again he's
[1:07:15] not he's not made a statement in
[1:07:17] somewhere such an out of you
[1:07:22] of Living Water and what is that now the
[1:07:27] believer is not the source of the water
[1:07:29] but the river becomes a Tanya like you
[1:07:34] have a lot of food of that person
[1:07:37] and that is what God wants us off of us
[1:07:42] today
[1:07:43] amen that people will come to you and
[1:07:47] bring Living Water
[1:07:51] people come to you
[1:07:54] they are supposed to bring that nothing
[1:07:57] like this
[1:07:58] from you from you
[1:08:02] yeah
[1:08:04] good
[1:08:05] life
[1:08:07] they let
[1:08:09] um
[1:08:10] uh their own system
[1:08:12] I mean it's broken
[1:08:15] but there's nothing but in the other guy
[1:08:18] is broken because he still holds worker
[1:08:21] so the clock is happening because we
[1:08:24] have water
[1:08:25] but I don't know uh most of I know I
[1:08:28] know a system so assistant I don't know
[1:08:30] the young guys
[1:08:33] water
[1:08:40] it's fresh
[1:08:41] for that one girl
[1:08:44] after one day
[1:08:46] it's not nice anymore God will contains
[1:08:50] water
[1:08:52] and so you keep coming back to drinking
[1:08:55] the same you know when I was growing up
[1:08:58] that is going to everything for that 10
[1:09:02] years
[1:09:03] from broadheads and baptism
[1:09:07] and I was like is this all the message
[1:09:10] has to offer is it just go get them
[1:09:13] baptism so at the time I left
[1:09:24] so sound
[1:09:26] when wonderful summer because I said
[1:09:29] this is not what I'm looking for
[1:09:31] okay I have to come back and I wanted
[1:09:35] someone to do for myself
[1:09:38] amen amen amen amen you know it was
[1:09:41] making sense it was like this is what I
[1:09:44] am missing all these years now why am I
[1:09:48] saying this thing the father is first
[1:09:50] conduct
[1:09:53] collect more worker and God remain only
[1:09:57] there
[1:09:58] for years
[1:10:00] and this is one reason why you see
[1:10:03] people living the so-called Mission
[1:10:06] Church to the universe
[1:10:12] is a real message thought goes outside
[1:10:16] he cannot be comfortable
[1:10:19] anywhere
[1:10:25] but when you can move on when you see a
[1:10:28] thought you have people use that church
[1:10:33] and they are comfortable something is
[1:10:36] working
[1:10:39] because if you seek these people right
[1:10:42] if you feed them like the undiluted word
[1:10:46] of God when you go outside and eat
[1:10:49] nonsense it will go back except the
[1:10:52] person is not a secret of God
[1:10:57] no oh God
[1:11:00] okay
[1:11:03] dog himself
[1:11:05] as the prince to mother
[1:11:07] okay there's some High kids to Abraham
[1:11:22] king of peace
[1:11:30] it means that that man feels like that
[1:11:33] if that's in God
[1:11:35] amen and then
[1:11:38] Christ
[1:11:42] who is make of the same altar of mercies
[1:11:46] a high priest who's Christy continues
[1:11:50] forever
[1:12:09] now
[1:12:11] we see the electronic systems
[1:12:15] saying of something uh the alcohol
[1:12:20] homes
[1:12:23] I will figure out the uh
[1:12:25] the hiking
[1:12:30] to go down again
[1:12:37] for the congregation
[1:12:39] himself
[1:12:41] has to be sure that before he can make
[1:12:45] that kind of offer
[1:12:47] then
[1:12:55] you have God yeah because if if you are
[1:13:01] not right to God you will die at the
[1:13:03] stop
[1:13:04] foreign
[1:13:30] once a year
[1:13:33] I don't
[1:13:35] know
[1:13:37] the kind of error
[1:13:40] God cooking these things together
[1:13:44] because it was going to be shadow
[1:13:47] of the perfect thing to come
[1:13:50] you know there was something perfect
[1:13:52] that was to come
[1:13:54] right because the devil even made us to
[1:13:57] understand that even the uh the blood of
[1:14:01] bulls and broke
[1:14:06] for him
[1:14:15] to God give God
[1:14:18] as a sudden
[1:14:20] because they knew someone nothing but
[1:14:23] other news the first other music
[1:14:25] something was to come into future now
[1:14:28] but now we see Christ as a heightened
[1:14:32] yeah before I continue we remember
[1:14:36] down in the Passover because
[1:14:42] uh speaking about communion and what's
[1:14:47] the last message
[1:14:49] uh
[1:14:51] yeah you have to be like for you to have
[1:14:55] a community with God so
[1:14:58] we will have to talk about
[1:15:00] and things
[1:15:09] that is
[1:15:11] making people from organs that's how God
[1:15:15] was and so
[1:15:22] right and then we finger some people
[1:15:26] have got to happen it was going to be
[1:15:30] the last minute
[1:15:31] and then God Called Moses and God
[1:15:36] uh
[1:15:38] around or you're good you lost me on the
[1:15:41] first year
[1:15:44] and have a character that must be a
[1:15:47] character and then
[1:15:50] you apply it on your top post
[1:15:54] you don't do it inside like some
[1:15:57] Deliverance who said they have the Holy
[1:15:58] Ghost and you can't see the
[1:16:00] manifestation of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:07] we will know
[1:16:09] if it's not in your house that you have
[1:16:12] the Holy Ghost your Holy Ghost makes me
[1:16:14] a deliver anywhere you go
[1:16:17] so
[1:16:18] you said applied on importance and on
[1:16:22] the nuclear
[1:16:23] and so that when I have over
[1:16:27] now remember that after the application
[1:16:31] to call them that day when you go behind
[1:16:35] you have a communion
[1:16:38] so don't a blood apply and behind the
[1:16:42] block you are some of them
[1:16:46] those Fellowship behind the door because
[1:16:50] ignored have gonna cry
[1:16:53] and so when the death angel passed
[1:16:57] he wasn't saying is to be like today
[1:17:01] or Google
[1:17:03] make any mistakes today that was a good
[1:17:06] question the questions is not at night
[1:17:12] and so
[1:17:16] it doesn't matter
[1:17:20] nothing matter
[1:17:21] and so the anger when he was passing or
[1:17:26] he was looking for is the block of time
[1:17:30] finish
[1:17:32] and that is the same thing today
[1:17:36] because if the block has not long enough
[1:17:39] time
[1:17:41] you're on your own
[1:17:44] no okay so a lot of time
[1:17:52] so
[1:17:54] I have like five minutes left
[1:18:02] to come to to all
[1:18:06] so I'm trying to learn Gaga I cannot
[1:18:09] come to us today you know we don't have
[1:18:13] a historical goal
[1:18:15] and so if all those things I'm talking
[1:18:17] about if it does not act like a girl
[1:18:19] there's no need to talking about them
[1:18:22] now
[1:18:33] we look at group
[1:18:37] then down from the East
[1:18:41] um I mean
[1:18:43] and one of us
[1:18:46] God Supply and linked to come through
[1:18:49] and convert me like next month and one
[1:18:52] months
[1:18:56] everything in one month we are going
[1:18:59] through so the group of good is very
[1:19:03] interesting book very interesting group
[1:19:06] now thank you
[1:19:12] and Yahoo
[1:19:14] was the youngest of all the the strength
[1:19:18] of truth that came to visit
[1:19:22] and his testimony was very different
[1:19:27] in fact it was a testimony that brought
[1:19:29] down God's presence well and you came to
[1:19:33] go
[1:19:34] he was not trying to indict group
[1:19:43] you must have done something wrong look
[1:19:46] when a man who came and you came more
[1:19:50] like in the office of the science folk
[1:19:52] Minister he came to Encore he came to
[1:19:56] edify and that is what we need today
[1:20:04] whatever he's gone
[1:20:06] Fellowship
[1:20:11] and so the Bible says anything he was
[1:20:15] fired until the August letter statement
[1:20:18] okay and you came to drugs I said God
[1:20:21] make me yeah
[1:20:23] [Music]
[1:20:25] Mountain
[1:20:26] but God be God was thinking
[1:20:30] the things will die and they come back
[1:20:33] but when man died he does not come back
[1:20:36] go on that something is missing
[1:20:39] somewhere but anyone who came and
[1:20:42] threatened it out and then who came and
[1:20:45] took good
[1:20:46] that is one that is to come
[1:20:50] and when that world comes he will
[1:20:53] reconcile man back and when when a woman
[1:20:57] who made that statement
[1:21:00] this one and then broke shelter all I
[1:21:05] know now I know that God can walk with
[1:21:09] myself
[1:21:10] I look at in this body because I will
[1:21:14] see him
[1:21:16] what happened a brother
[1:21:18] encouraging another brother amen what
[1:21:22] happened we broke life to him
[1:21:29] he said
[1:21:31] um
[1:21:34] of Indonesia
[1:21:36] foreign
[1:21:59] now
[1:22:02] I'm trying to
[1:22:08] so the river
[1:22:23] and
[1:22:25] most times we want to dwell in retention
[1:22:29] and attention side when we met others oh
[1:22:32] God I want I want to speak I want you
[1:22:35] know that we want to exercise power
[1:22:39] God
[1:22:40] doesn't decrease
[1:22:48] and that you know
[1:22:51] you said what do you mean
[1:22:54] I'm I'll do something
[1:22:56] John 20 verse 21. he said I didn't say
[1:23:00] to them again so please be unto you yes
[1:23:03] listen as my father has thanked me
[1:23:07] he said even so since I knew
[1:23:11] so similar
[1:23:14] bless ourselves I came here I came to
[1:23:17] dying for the sins of God why I came to
[1:23:20] give life to other people because that's
[1:23:23] him will that's how I am sending you
[1:23:27] you
[1:23:28] and I said
[1:23:30] I
[1:23:32] when he has said this he greeted on them
[1:23:34] I said unto them with few years
[1:23:39] again
[1:23:48] why because the producer is consumption
[1:23:53] as a priest
[1:23:59] foreign
[1:24:04] in the name of Jesus
[1:24:09] because we are living in a Dying World
[1:24:13] I don't think that life work now living
[1:24:16] in a dead world not this world is dead
[1:24:23] I we are supposed to do
[1:24:26] the most uncomfortable group here
[1:24:31] but if we are comfortable
[1:24:34] is wrong with us
[1:24:37] if we are comfortable here something is
[1:24:42] wrong with us
[1:24:43] well
[1:24:45] you as a believer
[1:24:47] because I want to make this quick man
[1:24:50] one thing that inspires information was
[1:24:53] Sister gaming
[1:24:55] so it was like three weeks ago when the
[1:24:59] sun was um that kind
[1:25:02] uh
[1:25:05] I kind of wanted to understand more
[1:25:08] about
[1:25:10] foreign
[1:25:22] [Music]
[1:25:47] come to clubs
[1:25:50] to come from her
[1:25:52] clock and so many thoughts and she's
[1:25:55] young Trump
[1:25:57] he's an old woman
[1:26:03] we stay at home
[1:26:05] where do you want to receive your
[1:26:07] healing is he at home
[1:26:10] foreign
[1:26:23] yeah who have put home
[1:26:26] because he said if I can't cook
[1:26:30] if I can talk
[1:26:32] I'm going to stop him
[1:26:35] I I'm going to cut the whole group
[1:26:43] there is someone who has lost hope in
[1:26:46] life
[1:26:47] and so
[1:26:49] all have faith if I can just the
[1:26:53] the smallest part of him
[1:26:56] and then when Christ was walking
[1:26:59] when Christ was walking down
[1:27:02] there are more people that love him
[1:27:04] there are people helping him hugging him
[1:27:07] and so many things and yet Christ did
[1:27:10] not feel them
[1:27:13] and then this woman she did not even
[1:27:16] talk Christ
[1:27:17] he got a hand and his first person
[1:27:21] someone trust me
[1:27:24] yeah
[1:27:31] someone talked me
[1:27:34] and you personally who taught him you
[1:27:39] because a different thought
[1:27:43] why am I saying that she did not stay
[1:27:46] home
[1:27:47] she came to her single suit because
[1:27:50] everybody have the smallest Fellowship I
[1:27:54] know it could be okay for me
[1:27:57] and so
[1:27:58] they must have called that hey
[1:28:03] you'll smell
[1:28:05] you smell I thought when you're walking
[1:28:07] down the road people can you hear your
[1:28:10] smelly
[1:28:11] go my game came to her
[1:28:16] there are so many things that we have to
[1:28:18] overcome
[1:28:19] God will walk down there and let me tell
[1:28:22] you something
[1:28:24] when you're losing blood
[1:28:27] you got work
[1:28:29] then then week
[1:28:32] in fact you can die from God
[1:28:35] but this woman he was not looking at
[1:28:39] those costs
[1:28:41] to stop looking at rubbing eyes I see
[1:28:45] and start looking at the Unseen
[1:28:49] right and what he was looking at was
[1:28:52] only if I can talk I don't care God if I
[1:28:56] can just talk to him of His Garment and
[1:28:58] let them let me make this statement
[1:29:01] God knew
[1:29:02] I know why Christ happened
[1:29:08] and that is why we don't have to take
[1:29:11] this thing for granted
[1:29:14] foreign
[1:29:40] we want to have real contact with God
[1:29:45] no
[1:29:47] the believer as a priest
[1:29:52] no
[1:29:53] I'm
[1:29:55] and opens our God
[1:29:58] now listen
[1:30:00] who has concerned us to himself like
[1:30:04] Jesus Christ
[1:30:05] and had given us what
[1:30:08] do what the meaningful of what we're
[1:30:12] continues
[1:30:15] to who
[1:30:17] you
[1:30:19] because that's what I'm this is not
[1:30:22] pastor this is not perfect it's not
[1:30:25] science fault he's not the deliver the
[1:30:28] ministry of the Constitution
[1:30:31] now
[1:30:35] is trying to explain that stress us to
[1:30:38] read that God Lost In Christ
[1:30:42] we're concerning the world unto yourself
[1:30:46] not including trespasses unto them
[1:30:51] so today
[1:30:52] if
[1:30:54] God has given us the ministry of the
[1:30:56] continuation
[1:30:58] we are not supposed to improve
[1:31:00] trespasses on the people
[1:31:03] we are supposed to relief
[1:31:07] foreign
[1:31:12] [Music]
[1:31:26] [Music]
[1:31:33] Ministry
[1:31:41] that's how he has given you the same
[1:31:45] Ministry how
[1:31:47] because Christ needs individuals
[1:31:52] he said that you are the Temple of the
[1:31:55] Living God so why are you come to so you
[1:31:59] look like instruments that God will
[1:32:01] continue doing the same work he was
[1:32:04] doing
[1:32:06] no
[1:32:08] look at last time
[1:32:10] now then we are what I'm GLaDOS of
[1:32:15] Christ
[1:32:19] um
[1:32:33] Anushka
[1:32:36] when Jacob
[1:32:40] when he went to Egypt and Phil told him
[1:32:43] I said how old are you
[1:32:45] he said the things of my pilgrimage
[1:32:50] the days of my pilgrimage
[1:32:53] knowing food that he was not of this act
[1:32:57] and you see that those men they moved
[1:33:01] their lives longer than something to
[1:33:03] come
[1:33:05] no matter the work we have they live
[1:33:08] their life knowing hundred percent there
[1:33:11] was something could come
[1:33:15] and so
[1:33:17] when you see someone you said the Bible
[1:33:20] says why your heart is
[1:33:23] that's your prayerful
[1:33:25] I thought when you see someone's heart
[1:33:29] you will not wear his praise of her you
[1:33:32] know why he's thinking the way he's
[1:33:34] thinking
[1:33:36] but when you see someone who is Heavenly
[1:33:39] minded the part of speaking in
[1:33:41] regardless
[1:33:43] he said
[1:33:46] after I give him a new things
[1:33:50] in half of life
[1:33:53] now remember
[1:33:55] that when the Holy Ghost comes I never
[1:33:58] statement before
[1:34:00] and uh
[1:34:02] we've got something it's like the life
[1:34:05] foreign
[1:34:35] is that life
[1:34:37] and that life is the life of man in him
[1:34:43] in
[1:34:44] Africa 20
[1:34:48] African
[1:34:50] is it expensive
[1:34:58] ask him that um
[1:35:01] last 28th so
[1:35:04] Paul speaking to the elders okay
[1:35:06] grateful
[1:35:08] unclean yourself
[1:35:10] and all good luck
[1:35:13] all over the week the Holy Ghost had
[1:35:15] made me over here
[1:35:16] he said
[1:35:18] to seek the cross of God look he had
[1:35:22] contained with his blood
[1:35:27] and so
[1:35:30] why we deal with each other
[1:35:34] we know that this I mean for people who
[1:35:38] are killing curious
[1:35:41] because
[1:35:44] the Holy Ghost has not and that's a
[1:35:47] question for continuous because the Holy
[1:35:50] Ghost is brought themselves and God will
[1:35:52] know in Jesus Christ right amen and so
[1:35:55] he possessed
[1:35:58] oh my
[1:36:01] God
[1:36:02] inclusion well now
[1:36:06] time is off so now remember
[1:36:09] that we went through it this morning he
[1:36:12] said you wasn't sure
[1:36:16] go
[1:36:18] you are kept dying
[1:36:22] okay
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:28] believe in it
[1:36:31] nothing but not at no heart
[1:36:35] because he could just connected you
[1:36:39] you look up and you did what you believe
[1:36:45] and accepted it
[1:36:47] now did not miss an atonement for
[1:36:51] yourself so remember I said God does not
[1:36:55] condemn a singer for swimming
[1:36:57] then he's a singer to begin with he
[1:37:01] condemns a Christian for Sinners so now
[1:37:05] look closely
[1:37:06] and then because he has condemned him
[1:37:11] Christ took our condemnation
[1:37:17] so
[1:37:18] the Christian who sings was condemned
[1:37:22] but the condemnation fell on Christ
[1:37:26] and so it doesn't remember
[1:37:30] now listen
[1:37:32] so Romans chapter 8
[1:37:34] so therefore there is now no
[1:37:38] condemnation
[1:37:41] for those who are employed
[1:37:45] yet they woke up after the flesh because
[1:37:49] after the experience
[1:37:51] if you do anything wrong it is not
[1:37:55] willful
[1:37:58] it is not willful
[1:38:02] and then you cannot sin because the fear
[1:38:05] of God whoever to you so you cannot even
[1:38:10] even if you want to you cannot
[1:38:14] you cannot
[1:38:18] understands that
[1:38:21] what we have been living in is not in
[1:38:25] school
[1:38:26] it is not something that we were told
[1:38:29] the reality of Christ
[1:38:33] reality of Christ
[1:38:37] and therefore tell him that is not
[1:38:40] Overland
[1:38:41] I'm driving one of the testimony
[1:38:44] I do not know the life unto death
[1:38:49] as I say again that this is the greatest
[1:38:51] shock
[1:38:53] of the devil ever
[1:38:55] because
[1:39:00] Godless War
[1:39:05] fare

[1:42:13] cannot tell you why
[1:42:15] but my kids are gone
[1:42:18] I know
[1:42:19] it's not like this
[1:42:22] [Music]

[1:42:31] it's not me
[1:42:33] it's not him
[1:42:36] not of him that is wrong yet
[1:42:45] [Music]
[1:42:52] I'm not talking to I'm good brother
[1:42:54] right now
[1:43:01] when God looks at you
[1:43:05] noises that he became sin
[1:43:10] that that one that enormous applied for
[1:43:14] will be part of the righteousness of God
[1:43:19] and it doesn't come and tell you I ain't
[1:43:22] brother
[1:43:25] you are God
[1:43:28] it doesn't even lie
[1:43:31] to the father of all liars

[1:43:40] are you helping her hit him hard you
[1:43:43] will not see an outcome of spooking him
