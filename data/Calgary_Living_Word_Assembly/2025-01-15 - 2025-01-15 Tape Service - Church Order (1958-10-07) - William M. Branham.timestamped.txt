[28:29] song off the off the screen for a minute
[28:32] I've got a little bit of a exercise for
[28:33] the young people so who's 13 and younger
[28:36] tonight 13 and
[28:39] younger did I is that is that 13 so how
[28:42] many one two three is that it four
[28:46] five thereabouts six okay can you help
[28:50] me out with a a question tonight it's
[28:54] going to be the next song so I already
[28:56] gave away the secret well what song did
[28:59] an angel play and what
[29:02] instrument in our prophet's Ministry did
[29:06] anybody know the
[29:08] answer what time did an angel of the
[29:11] Lord play a song and what instrument
[29:15] anybody know a parent going to give a
[29:19] queue somebody said
[29:21] it piano y awesome and then what song a
[29:26] great phys correct correct the great
[29:30] physician I was here and I was thinking
[29:32] about the angels I I I don't know did
[29:33] they have instruments when before God
[29:35] was even God he created angels as as as
[29:39] objects to worship him I don't know did
[29:41] they play instruments perhaps but we
[29:44] know I was thinking man what a what a
[29:47] we've had so many elements of
[29:49] vindication like something simple like
[29:50] this an Amish girl brother brand said
[29:52] that didn't even wasn't even a
[29:54] Pentecostal her little brother what
[29:56] happened to her brother anybody you know
[29:59] that he had a club foot or a twisted
[30:02] foot and on the stage his ankle got got
[30:05] healed just like that she jumped out of
[30:08] the piano stool and starts praising the
[30:10] Lord and speaking in tongues and then
[30:12] piano kept playing the great physician
[30:14] that's the song we're going to sing
[30:16] tonight sing it with me we have been as
[30:19] Brother Don prayed we've been so blessed
[30:22] with
[30:23] Revelation realization of who we are and
[30:26] and and what God came to do in this age
[30:28] and we're going to hear that voice
[30:29] tonight was thinking today that voice is
[30:32] not brother brandom's voice it's his
[30:34] vocal chords but who's speaking it's the
[30:37] same Angel of the Covenant that's that
[30:39] led the the children of Israel same on
[30:41] sorry it's just inspires me I just love
[30:44] what we believe I'm so thankful for it

[44:06] savior we are grateful this evening for
[44:09] your
[44:09] leadership we thank you for your
[44:12] faithfulness Lord what would be of us
[44:15] without you and yet father you saw it
[44:18] fit to look us up and bring us together
[44:21] this way to fulfill a purpose your
[44:24] purpose which cannot fail in this SE in
[44:27] this time in this corner of the earth we
[44:29] glorify your name we exalt your name
[44:32] father but even as we come as your
[44:34] children as we gathered before you
[44:37] seeking our spiritual food oh God see
[44:40] seeking nourishment seeking strength of
[44:42] you because Lord you are the only source
[44:45] of our strength you are the only source
[44:47] of Life there is none else beside thee
[44:49] there is nowhere else father and because
[44:52] of that father you've not you've you've
[44:55] opened yourself completely through Us in
[44:57] this age and we understand that when we
[45:00] gather together this way in fulfillment
[45:02] of your word father we know that we are
[45:04] not going to listen to the voice of a
[45:06] man we know we are going to listen to
[45:08] your voice yes you've used his vocal
[45:11] court but we believe with all our heart
[45:13] that this is you speaking to us father
[45:16] help us oh Lord to receive it even as
[45:18] you bring it father the same inspiration
[45:21] with which it was spoken oh Lord may we
[45:23] have and receive that same inspiration
[45:25] oh Lord that this word will be the life
[45:29] of this Church Father we love and
[45:31] appreciate you oh God bless us as we go
[45:34] forward father for the remainder of this
[45:36] service have your way in Jesus Christ's
[45:39] name do we pray
[45:43] amen all right so as
[45:47] um the pastor stated already we're going
[45:50] to listen to a tape it's a very short
[45:53] one
[45:54] um about 34 minutes
[45:58] David Church order uh PR in
[46:01] 1958 in
[46:04] Jeffersonville and um for me I just want
[46:08] to say you may have your seats please I
[46:11] just want to say
[46:13] I'm very very excited because I see this
[46:17] as a pread into um sort of the direction
[46:21] in which we are going and like brother
[46:25] BR the words of brother Braham says it
[46:27] makes a strong
[46:29] church and so much as we're not going to
[46:31] do the question and
[46:34] answers but per se today yet this this
[46:38] short tape it's it's a a very important
[46:42] prel that we have to um sort of embrace
[46:46] accept receive with Open Hearts and pray
[46:48] that every direction every correction
[46:51] anything that comes will be useful to us
[46:55] now if May maybe you're new here or
[46:57] anything like that or you're young just
[46:59] understand this that there are so many
[47:01] things that we do different here that
[47:04] it's not done out there that even if you
[47:07] go to other congregations they don't do
[47:10] it that way now we don't just gather to
[47:13] say let's do things different it's not
[47:16] as if some headquarters dictated that
[47:18] this is how things should go no actually
[47:22] we in a congregation that anybody at all
[47:25] who wants to know why we do what we do
[47:28] it can be known because it's just one
[47:31] source that is the Bible amen and and
[47:35] yes it's true many congregations and
[47:38] many um denominations can also lay hold
[47:41] to the same claim and that's because the
[47:44] Bible is a very unique book the author
[47:47] made sure that the only way you can
[47:50] understand him it's by him revealing it
[47:53] to
[47:54] you and so when we we as humans because
[47:58] we are smart and we can read and we take
[48:00] it we end up in a tangent and then
[48:03] another one takes it and end in a
[48:05] different tangent and on and on and on
[48:07] that's why we have so many denominations
[48:10] but God in his wisdom spoke for every
[48:13] age and when he did he also spoke a
[48:16] people to
[48:18] believe so it works both ways and so we
[48:22] believe that God has spoken again in
[48:24] this end time and we are the people he
[48:27] has spoken to that is why we do things
[48:29] the way we do and so as this tape Goes
[48:35] Forth my prayer is that we understand
[48:38] that this is not just a man speaking and
[48:41] that this is God himself speaking to us
[48:43] like brother Braham he say said he said
[48:47] the way we do this is to comp out the
[48:49] cockle birds and get things out of the
[48:51] way that we might all speak the same
[48:55] thing
[48:56] and so that is the idea praise the name
[48:59] of the Lord now there is something else
[49:02] that he says and I just mentioned it
[49:05] because I thought it was very impactful
[49:07] it says that if you see me do anything
[49:10] wrong you are Duty bound to come to me
[49:14] privately now watch this carefully Duty
[49:16] bound so it's not if we like it's not if
[49:20] we feel late if there's something going
[49:23] on you you think it's not consistent
[49:25] with what we believe because I believe
[49:27] this was not speaking just for baham but
[49:29] for everybody who leads who has a
[49:32] leadership role in this congregation we
[49:34] are Dy so it's a moral
[49:36] obligation you're Duty bound to come to
[49:38] me and so this is the idea what I'm
[49:41] saying is if we don't listen to that
[49:44] tape if we don't read that Bible how do
[49:47] we know what somebody is doing whether
[49:49] it's right or wrong this is something
[49:52] that we have to do
[49:56] I I don't want to be speaking too much I
[49:59] I there is something I I I heard this
[50:02] week it says that uh when you eat when
[50:06] you eat it says if you eat if you if you
[50:09] want potassium you eat
[50:11] banana and I say if you want potasium
[50:13] even plantain is better but if you eat
[50:17] that you don't have to know that
[50:20] plantain contains this or that as long
[50:22] as you have eaten that plantain or
[50:25] banana you are getting some potassium in
[50:27] your body as long as you are eating some
[50:30] citrus fruit you are getting some
[50:32] vitamin C in you and as long as you're
[50:35] reading this Bible with open heart and
[50:37] believing you are receiving
[50:40] life and so that is key and the voice we
[50:43] are going to listen today is how God
[50:47] interprets his word to us so in all
[50:50] humility let's give it all our attention
[50:53] and God will bless us
[50:54] all may the Lord bless you
[51:23] Mee of Five Nights at the Tabernacle
[51:27] where by God's grace and by his help I
[51:32] have tried hard by the
[51:34] scriptures to set in order the Church of
[51:38] the Lord Jesus
[51:40] Christ as we believe at the brandham
[51:46] Tabernacle the first thing I wish to say
[51:51] is that the pastor is always in full
[51:55] charge
[51:57] of the Tabernacle in my
[52:00] absence and I only look to the pastor
[52:04] when I return so he is in full charge to
[52:08] change or to do whatsoever he thinks
[52:11] it's best under the leadership of the
[52:13] Holy Spirit while I am
[52:18] aw we
[52:20] believe in an Apostolic Church teaching
[52:24] Apostolic blessings
[52:26] for our peoples of this day we believe
[52:31] in the Full
[52:32] Gospel and believe that all of the signs
[52:36] and the Wonders that was spoken of by
[52:40] our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany
[52:43] his church until he returns we believe
[52:46] in those
[52:47] things and believe that they are to be
[52:50] set an
[52:51] order that the church has its
[52:55] order and each church has its doctrines
[52:59] and Order and
[53:02] discipline our church has no members as
[53:07] joiners we believe that the whole
[53:09] Universal Church of the Living God is
[53:12] our brothers and
[53:14] sisters and all people are always
[53:17] welcome regardless of what denomination
[53:20] they belong to at the ram Tabernacle at
[53:23] e and Penn Street in Jeffersonville
[53:26] Indiana
[53:28] we believe in justification by
[53:31] faith
[53:33] Romans
[53:35] 51 we believe that after a person being
[53:39] justified by faith he has peace with the
[53:42] Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that
[53:46] this same person could have
[53:49] habits such as drinking smoking doing
[53:53] things that he should not do filthy
[53:56] habits of the flesh then we believe that
[53:59] the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies
[54:02] this person for the service of the Lord
[54:06] and that's we believe in sanctification
[54:08] according to Hebrews
[54:11] 13 12 and
[54:13] 13 for
[54:15] Jesus also that he might sanctify the
[54:18] people with his own blood suffered
[54:20] without the
[54:21] gates and we believe that sanctification
[54:24] is taught in the new Testament and meant
[54:28] for the Believers through the New
[54:31] Testament age which we're now
[54:34] living and we also believe that after
[54:38] the person has been Sanctified the
[54:42] unclean habits is gone from the person
[54:45] he's the believer on the Lord Jesus
[54:46] Christ and his habits are gone we
[54:49] believe that then he is a candidate for
[54:52] the baptism of the holy spirit amen
[54:54] which comes as a filling
[54:57] of the
[54:59] believer and then when the believer it's
[55:01] just as many times as I have taught it
[55:04] like picking up a glass out in the
[55:07] chicken yard justification is picking it
[55:10] up ready for to use it with a purpose in
[55:13] heart that's what God does to The Sinner
[55:15] he's still filthy then he's cleansed by
[55:18] the blood of Jesus Christ and the word
[55:21] sanctify is a compound word which means
[55:25] cleaned and set aside for
[55:28] service in the Old Testament the altar
[55:31] Sanctified The Vessel and it was set
[55:34] aside for service we believe that the
[55:37] holy spirit is putting the same vessel
[55:39] in service that the holy spirit is uh
[55:44] not another step of Grace but more of
[55:47] the same Grace that fills the believer
[55:51] to the extent where that signs and
[55:54] wonders such as the apostolic gifts
[55:57] spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12 manifest
[56:01] themselves through this believer when
[56:04] the Holy Spirit comes in to take up the
[56:06] gift I believe at the scripture teaches
[56:11] that gifts and callings are without
[56:13] repentance that when we're born in this
[56:15] world we are sent here by one purpose
[56:18] that is of god and that before we're
[56:23] even become adults while we're yet
[56:25] children that gifts that we have of God
[56:27] is
[56:28] inocent and only the filling of the Holy
[56:32] Spirit puts these gifts into operation
[56:35] but we have them in the beginning such
[56:37] as teachers and apostles and and
[56:40] Prophets and Gifts of tongues and the
[56:43] nine spiritual gifts according to 1
[56:45] Corinthians
[56:47] 12 now we believe that these gifts are
[56:50] in operation today and they should be in
[56:52] ever local church although in such we
[56:55] have found throughout the world that
[56:59] there's much fanaticism hooked along
[57:02] with people who profess to be uh
[57:05] Apostolic Believers just as they are and
[57:08] other orders and so forth we have
[57:11] Fanatics that's been all along we've had
[57:14] those Through the Ages they had it in
[57:16] the apostolic day and as Paul said there
[57:20] that how that some had come and persuade
[57:22] them away after other doctrines and so
[57:25] forth
[57:26] but in his own teaching he said if an
[57:28] angel from heaven would teach anything
[57:30] else than what he had taught let him be
[57:33] a curse so we as the brandom Tabernacle
[57:37] at eth and Pinn Street year try to
[57:39] follow the teachings of the New
[57:41] Testament for we believe that Jesus
[57:44] Christ being the Son of God and Paul the
[57:47] Apostle was a called and chosen vessel
[57:50] by election of God to be sent to the
[57:54] Gentile Church to set it in
[57:57] order now we believe in water baptism in
[58:01] the brandham Tabernacle by
[58:03] Mercy In The Name Of The Lord Jesus
[58:06] Christ which is the apostolic uh
[58:09] teaching of the
[58:10] Bible and may all members of the or
[58:14] comers to the brand Tabernacle who
[58:16] desire such May at any time requesting
[58:20] to be immersed in the name of the Lord
[58:23] Jesus May consult the pastor and the
[58:26] they have repented and believed on the
[58:27] Lord Jesus Christ the pastor will as
[58:31] soon as possible even then if he can
[58:34] baptize them immediately this does bring
[58:36] them into the Fellowship of the
[58:39] Believers we believe that by water
[58:41] baptism we are brought into a fellowship
[58:44] but by the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[58:46] we're brought into the members being
[58:49] members of the body of Jesus Christ
[58:52] which is all over the
[58:54] world now
[58:56] another thing that we believe that the
[58:59] manifestation of the spirit is giving to
[59:01] every man to profit with all now we
[59:05] believe that when these gifts and so
[59:08] forth are operating in the church which
[59:10] we covet and desire that the people who
[59:14] are gifted by the Spirit come and
[59:17] worship with us now in most places we
[59:20] find that when these gifts in the people
[59:23] the people does not understand how how
[59:26] and when to use these gifts and in doing
[59:30] so they only bring a reproach which we
[59:33] believe would be just what Satan could
[59:35] do to make The Outsiders the unbelievers
[59:39] and so forth afraid of this wonderful
[59:42] blessing that God has given to the
[59:44] church in these
[59:46] days Paul said when there come a
[59:49] stranger Among Us and we've all speak
[59:53] with tongues won't the man go away and
[59:55] say say we were mad but if one would
[59:58] prophesy and make KN the secret of the
[1:00:01] heart then they would fall down and say
[1:00:03] truly God is with you now we believe
[1:00:06] that the spiritual gifts among the
[1:00:10] Believers is the order of the
[1:00:13] day we cannot believe that a man can
[1:00:16] preach under
[1:00:18] inspiration and then or be an inspired
[1:00:22] teacher and then Deni the gift of
[1:00:25] healing or the gift of Prophecy or
[1:00:27] speaking with tongues or interpretation
[1:00:29] of tongues or any of these other gifts
[1:00:32] so therefore here is
[1:00:36] my belief in God's word the way the Bram
[1:00:41] Tabernacle at ath and Penn Street here
[1:00:43] in Jeffersonville should be
[1:00:47] operated I think the first thing and
[1:00:50] believe that these things which I say is
[1:00:53] essential and must be carried out in
[1:00:57] this manner in the brandom Tabernacle
[1:00:59] for it to prosper in the
[1:01:01] Lord and if at any time these this would
[1:01:05] be
[1:01:05] question the person who is in question
[1:01:08] about it may consult me if they cannot
[1:01:12] get to the pastor or they could consult
[1:01:14] the pastor if I'm home off of some of
[1:01:18] the trips I'll be glad to to help either
[1:01:23] the Ley or the pastor at any time and
[1:01:25] the these things are scripturally and I
[1:01:28] believe it's the order of the church I
[1:01:30] think first that every member or every
[1:01:35] worshipper of the brandom Tabernacle
[1:01:38] should be so much in Divine love with
[1:01:41] each other until it would their hearts
[1:01:46] would long for each other when they have
[1:01:48] to go away to leave each other at the
[1:01:50] service at night I am a True Believer in
[1:01:54] Divine love
[1:01:57] the Apostle Paul said that was the
[1:01:59] evidence of the Holy Spirit by this man
[1:02:01] all man will know your my disciples said
[1:02:05] Jesus when you have love one for the
[1:02:09] other and we believe that it's a love of
[1:02:12] God that sent Jesus Christ to the Earth
[1:02:15] to die for us all God so loved the world
[1:02:18] he gave his only begotten son that
[1:02:20] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:02:23] perish but would have
[1:02:26] everlasting
[1:02:28] life and the everlasting life here is
[1:02:32] God's own life because we become Sons
[1:02:34] and Daughters of God by the baptism of
[1:02:38] the Holy Spirit which is the Seed of
[1:02:41] Abraham and gives us the faith that
[1:02:43] Abraham had when he believed God before
[1:02:47] he was even
[1:02:48] circumcised
[1:02:50] now the next thing we believe that these
[1:02:54] worshippers
[1:02:56] should meet together these gifted people
[1:02:59] such as tongues and people who gets
[1:03:01] Revelations and
[1:03:03] interpretations and so forth these
[1:03:05] members or these Believers rather should
[1:03:09] come together at least 45 minutes or an
[1:03:14] hour before the services ever began the
[1:03:18] church should be open early and the
[1:03:20] Believers come together on these nights
[1:03:24] and at least 45 minutes to an hour
[1:03:27] before the services began I believe the
[1:03:30] brandom Tabernacle at all times should
[1:03:33] have a spirit filled
[1:03:36] pianist who would come early filled with
[1:03:39] the Holy Spirit and would play
[1:03:44] softly very
[1:03:47] softly Spiritual music such as down at
[1:03:50] the cross where the Savior died down
[1:03:53] there for cleansing from sin died there
[1:03:57] to my heart was the blood applied glory
[1:04:00] to his name something on that order near
[1:04:03] my God to thee Rock of Ages cleff for me
[1:04:06] or near The Cross or something on that
[1:04:09] order softly
[1:04:12] slowly as he is meditating constantly on
[1:04:16] the Holy Spirit he or she whichever it
[1:04:18] may
[1:04:20] be then I believe that the worshippers
[1:04:23] coming in should be met
[1:04:26] and their hang their coats and hats show
[1:04:30] to their seats with
[1:04:33] hospitality that only ushers are deacons
[1:04:36] filled with the Holy Spirit can do and
[1:04:39] in love to see the Church of the Living
[1:04:42] God go
[1:04:43] on these worshippers should not talk one
[1:04:46] with another and be talking across and
[1:04:50] making noise in the church they should
[1:04:53] come together first slip up and silent
[1:04:56] prayer perhaps at the altar for a few
[1:04:59] moments no loud praying you interrupt
[1:05:02] someone else silent prayer you're in
[1:05:07] worship let that soak in
[1:05:11] worshiping in your
[1:05:14] spirit then return to your seat or you
[1:05:19] do not have to go to the altar just go
[1:05:21] in and get your seat sit down listen to
[1:05:25] to the Music close your eyes bow your
[1:05:29] head and be in silent worshiping God all
[1:05:35] along then if the spirit should reveal
[1:05:39] something to
[1:05:42] another or or someone be filled with the
[1:05:46] spirit to a place where they would speak
[1:05:48] with tongues then this person should
[1:05:51] rise and give the
[1:05:53] message and everyone must hold their
[1:05:56] peace until the interpretation comes
[1:06:00] when the interpretation comes it must
[1:06:03] not be just quoting of scripture or
[1:06:07] something that has no meaning it must be
[1:06:10] a message directed to the church or we
[1:06:14] think that it would be in the
[1:06:16] flesh we see so much of that now I
[1:06:20] believe the the spirit was to speak only
[1:06:22] for the edifying of the church
[1:06:26] and now it would be a message something
[1:06:29] on this order Perhaps Perhaps the people
[1:06:31] are gathering by this time some sick
[1:06:34] people has come in perhaps there's a man
[1:06:36] laying paralyzed or something you've
[1:06:39] never seen him before but when the
[1:06:41] interpretation would come would be
[1:06:42] something in this order when the
[1:06:44] interpretation of the one who has just
[1:06:46] spoke would say uh well thus saith the
[1:06:50] Lord the man who is in our midst has
[1:06:52] come from a certain certain place and
[1:06:54] describe the place
[1:06:56] and would say that he is paralyzed
[1:06:59] because three or four years ago or
[1:07:01] whatever it may the case may be he did
[1:07:03] something evil like left his wife and
[1:07:06] children and run off from him and he's
[1:07:08] fell from a trussle or something like
[1:07:10] that order and got hurt and paralyzing
[1:07:13] thus sayith the Lord if he will repent
[1:07:15] of that and will promise to go to his
[1:07:18] wife and reconcile himself to her then
[1:07:21] he shall be healed now and returned to
[1:07:24] his family and then before anyone says
[1:07:28] anything there must be at least two or
[1:07:32] more men are peoples in the building who
[1:07:37] are spiritually solid in gospel Doctrine
[1:07:42] who has a good discernment of spirit
[1:07:44] shall rise up and say that it is of the
[1:07:48] Lord and if this thing doesn't take
[1:07:50] place then tongues should not be
[1:07:53] mentioned in the church if the person
[1:07:56] speaks with tongues Paul said there be
[1:07:58] no interpreter and so forth let them
[1:08:01] speak at home or wherever they may be
[1:08:04] for they only blessing themselves and
[1:08:06] it's not for edification of the church
[1:08:09] then this person after speaking in the
[1:08:12] interpretation and then two or three
[1:08:15] judges according to St Paul's doctrine
[1:08:17] of the Bible that it must be judged by
[1:08:20] two or three judges then let the person
[1:08:24] and whom it calls upon to go it maybe it
[1:08:27] might designate a certain person or the
[1:08:29] pastor or someone to go lay hands on
[1:08:31] this person and it it's sick or
[1:08:35] Afflicted and they will be healed then
[1:08:37] let the pastor or the other person
[1:08:40] whoever it may be it was designated by
[1:08:43] the Holy Spirit to go pray the prayer of
[1:08:46] faith let them go and minister to the
[1:08:49] person according to what the spirit is
[1:08:52] said then at that time the person
[1:08:56] and whatever the Holy Spirit has said it
[1:08:58] shall take place immediately then just
[1:09:02] as the Holy Spirit has given then the
[1:09:04] people could rejoice and be thankful and
[1:09:08] praise and worship God because God wants
[1:09:10] to be worship then they must then they
[1:09:13] must bow their heads and be in prayer
[1:09:15] again to see if there be another message
[1:09:17] that the holy spirit will want these
[1:09:19] gifts to manifest before and then if any
[1:09:22] time that a person would speak in
[1:09:24] tongues and interpret and the the judges
[1:09:28] would send the person to take to do
[1:09:30] whatever it was said to be done and it
[1:09:33] doesn't come to pass then the whole
[1:09:35] group of them shall go to the Altar and
[1:09:39] there pray God to take that spirit away
[1:09:41] from them because there's no one would
[1:09:44] want a spirit like that we would know it
[1:09:46] would be false and would be of the enemy
[1:09:49] and not of God because God can only tell
[1:09:54] truth let that be clearly understood by
[1:09:57] the church before you start this this
[1:10:00] new
[1:10:01] order then perhaps maybe it would be
[1:10:05] something like this the message would
[1:10:06] say to a certain brother maybe it say
[1:10:09] would live by a railroad track or
[1:10:10] something to have him to move out
[1:10:13] because there is going to be a wreck on
[1:10:15] the road or something or anything in
[1:10:17] that order and let the judges after they
[1:10:20] give the church permission to
[1:10:22] speak or to exercise this uh message has
[1:10:26] just went forth if their judgment is
[1:10:28] it's of God then watch and see if it
[1:10:30] comes to pass and if it comes to pass
[1:10:33] thank God and be very graceful graceful
[1:10:37] in your heart towards him and give him
[1:10:40] praise and worship and be humble Above
[1:10:43] All
[1:10:46] Things be
[1:10:48] humble don't never get yourself puffed
[1:10:51] up to a place where you know more about
[1:10:54] it than your pastor or the church that
[1:10:56] you're worshiping in if you get to that
[1:10:59] place then ID advise each one of you to
[1:11:02] get another place to worship with
[1:11:04] because I am asking the pastor never to
[1:11:07] permit anything outside of the Bible
[1:11:10] order a way we have seen it here in the
[1:11:13] church and then we want these gifts to
[1:11:16] be operated in place and the worshippers
[1:11:19] if it's carried on correctly according
[1:11:21] to the word you'll see a mighty
[1:11:23] wonderful Church an operation for our
[1:11:26] Lord Jesus Christ now then the next
[1:11:30] thing shall take place will be that if
[1:11:34] these people who have that gets out of
[1:11:38] order uh during these times that a
[1:11:41] deacon or some uh Usher that's filled
[1:11:45] with the Holy Ghost and got lots of
[1:11:46] Grace in their heart shall go to the
[1:11:49] person reverently fatherly like and
[1:11:52] shall correct them in this manner or the
[1:11:55] pastor whoever it may be which would be
[1:11:57] more essential for the deacons to do so
[1:12:01] for the pastor at this time while these
[1:12:03] spiritual services are going on should
[1:12:06] be in the prayer room or somewhere a
[1:12:08] Praying these messages then if there's
[1:12:12] no messages going on no Revelations then
[1:12:15] the people would be privileged if they
[1:12:17] desired to raise and give a testimony a
[1:12:21] testimony only for the glory of God
[1:12:24] they're not bound to do this but
[1:12:26] testimonies should be given before the
[1:12:28] message or any song service starts or
[1:12:31] anything testimonies in these worship
[1:12:33] services do you understand church that
[1:12:36] in doing this you have the whole church
[1:12:40] in the spirit of worship before the word
[1:12:45] comes in to be taught then the Holy
[1:12:47] Spirit gets in the word and manifest God
[1:12:50] through the word to be a confirmation of
[1:12:54] your worship
[1:12:56] now then after this uh time for the
[1:13:00] pastor to come on if messages are going
[1:13:03] on say the pastor should come out
[1:13:06] exactly say
[1:13:07] 7:30 and or quarter of 8 and if these
[1:13:11] messages are still going on before the
[1:13:13] pastor comes to his out of his study or
[1:13:16] wherever he may to take his place at the
[1:13:18] platform some brothers should instruct
[1:13:21] him because the Saints knows that when
[1:13:23] the pastor comes on the platform it's
[1:13:26] his time then for the service and that
[1:13:29] gives plenty ample time for all the
[1:13:32] manifestations of the gifts to bring the
[1:13:35] spirit of God into the the congregation
[1:13:39] and if any unbeliever would happen to be
[1:13:41] there be disorderly a kindhearted person
[1:13:45] would go to them such as an urer or a
[1:13:48] deacon and would tell them if they would
[1:13:51] they would ask to be kept Reverend or be
[1:13:54] reverent while the service are is in
[1:13:57] order because the spirit is in the
[1:13:59] building and the gifts of God are being
[1:14:02] made manifest for the edifying of the
[1:14:06] church and this person must be told in
[1:14:09] love and not harshly unless it would
[1:14:13] come to a place where they were drinking
[1:14:15] or some disobedient or something other
[1:14:18] that would be interfering with the
[1:14:19] worship of Lo of the Lord uh which the
[1:14:22] gifts are then are being manifest then
[1:14:25] the person should will should be led out
[1:14:29] to one side to one of the back rooms or
[1:14:32] somewhere and be talked to and dealt
[1:14:35] with
[1:14:36] kindly
[1:14:39] now while the pastor comes to the
[1:14:43] platform as the pastor comes to the
[1:14:45] platform I would
[1:14:47] suggest as a brandom tabernacle here
[1:14:50] that the pastor lead the congregation
[1:14:54] and at least one or
[1:14:57] two good
[1:15:01] songs for we have found it so that when
[1:15:04] too many are trying to operate the in
[1:15:07] the church it brings on only
[1:15:10] trouble I would suggest as I did while I
[1:15:13] was pastoring at the church I led the
[1:15:17] songs
[1:15:19] myself and I feel that it would be a
[1:15:21] good thing if the pastor did so himself
[1:15:25] and in all prayer meetings where they're
[1:15:27] gathered together groups of prayer
[1:15:30] meetings the pastor must be at each
[1:15:34] one it should never be left to any
[1:15:37] individual to go lead such meetings for
[1:15:40] we have found it so that they get off
[1:15:43] the track on Doctrine and then it call
[1:15:45] bring it right back into the church and
[1:15:47] many time bring heresies and so forth
[1:15:50] which doesn't belong in the Church of
[1:15:52] the Living God and the pastor should be
[1:15:55] at all prayer meetings and so forth
[1:15:58] where congre Gatherings are and the
[1:16:01] pastors should never take sides in the
[1:16:04] meeting the saying that one group is
[1:16:07] this way and one that way the pastors
[1:16:09] should stand between both of them and go
[1:16:12] to them and get them reconciled
[1:16:15] immediately and if he can't get them
[1:16:17] reconciled let him take a deacon with
[1:16:18] him and then if the they want you
[1:16:21] neither Pastor nor Deacon then it should
[1:16:24] be told to the the church and as Jesus
[1:16:26] said let them be unto you as a heathen
[1:16:29] and a Publican and whatever you bind on
[1:16:31] Earth said Jesus I'll bind in heaven and
[1:16:35] what you loose on Earth I will loose in
[1:16:39] heaven
[1:16:41] now when the pastor comes to the
[1:16:44] platform let the pastor then lead at
[1:16:48] least one or two songs and go straight
[1:16:51] to the word not no time for these long
[1:16:55] testimony meetings and everybody get up
[1:16:57] and a word to say that does not prosper
[1:17:01] in the random Tabernacle if any peop who
[1:17:04] are listening to this tape and you it
[1:17:07] has prospered in your church well that's
[1:17:09] perfectly all right and we are very glad
[1:17:12] of that that it does prosper in your
[1:17:15] church but in our CH it does not it only
[1:17:18] causes confusion I've been pastoring
[1:17:21] here for 20 some odd years and I have
[1:17:23] found that it only cost causes confusion
[1:17:26] if you've got a testimony give it before
[1:17:28] the in the congregation of the people
[1:17:30] while the spirits are blessing and so
[1:17:33] forth are the real way to testify is not
[1:17:36] in the church is out in Dark Places let
[1:17:39] your light shine where it's dark go to
[1:17:42] Road houses and different places and
[1:17:44] where sin and things is heaping then let
[1:17:46] your light shine there is the place to
[1:17:48] do it but however if the Lord has
[1:17:50] blessed you and give you some great
[1:17:52] special blessing or something that you
[1:17:54] have to tell the people do it in time of
[1:17:58] the other service the pre-service the
[1:18:00] preliminary or when the spirit is
[1:18:03] blessing and giving testimonies and
[1:18:05] Revelations and tongues and
[1:18:07] interpretations and so forth in the
[1:18:09] worship of the Saints before the word of
[1:18:12] God is being brought forth then the
[1:18:15] pastor after leading this himym shall
[1:18:18] immediately lead the church in
[1:18:20] prayer and a congregational prayer
[1:18:23] himself as he stands at the platform
[1:18:26] asking the rest of them to Bow their
[1:18:27] heads in
[1:18:29] prayer this we have found to be a
[1:18:32] greater blessing and a more ruy and
[1:18:35] operating in the church and then the
[1:18:38] next thing the pastor should do then if
[1:18:41] they had a real spiritual meeting with
[1:18:43] the gifts making manifest many secrets
[1:18:46] of the people's hearts and things which
[1:18:49] should be done by the gifts in the
[1:18:50] meeting then the spirit of God is in the
[1:18:53] meeting and it's very easy then for the
[1:18:56] pastor to find the spirit of God which
[1:18:59] is already in the meeting on the word of
[1:19:01] God as he reads and starts preaching the
[1:19:04] pastor then preach anything that the
[1:19:06] Holy Spirit would put on his heart
[1:19:08] whatever he wishes to do standing there
[1:19:11] but the congregation is the only they
[1:19:14] can rejoice as he is preaching of course
[1:19:16] or say Amen when the word comes forth
[1:19:20] but as far as getting up and giving uh
[1:19:22] uh messages and tongues and an
[1:19:25] interpretation while the Holy Spirit is
[1:19:28] working through the pastor the scripture
[1:19:30] condemns that and said the spirit of the
[1:19:32] prophets is subject to the prophet the
[1:19:35] pastor then must call this individual
[1:19:38] down and ask them to be reverent and to
[1:19:41] keep their place the pastor must be a
[1:19:44] man that has got a very humble way about
[1:19:49] him but not too humble for what he could
[1:19:53] be like the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:55] when he seen wrong going on in the
[1:19:56] church he platted ropes and ran them out
[1:19:59] of the church and now the Church of God
[1:20:03] is the house of judgment and the pastor
[1:20:07] is the highest order in the church the
[1:20:10] Elder is a high thing in the apostolic
[1:20:12] church outside of the Holy Spirit the
[1:20:15] Holy Spirit brings his message straight
[1:20:17] to the Altar and the Elder gives it to
[1:20:19] the people the Saints in their gifts
[1:20:22] shall have their place first the worship
[1:20:24] them come together which brings as I
[1:20:27] said before the spirit of the Lord in
[1:20:30] the building for the pastor and it makes
[1:20:32] him much easier for the Holy Spirit to
[1:20:34] work through him then when a good
[1:20:36] spiritual meeting has just proceeded his
[1:20:39] teaching and then the Holy Spirit gets
[1:20:42] into the word and teaches the word has
[1:20:44] just been manifested by the gifts and
[1:20:47] then the aler call is being made then
[1:20:50] asward and many then will see and know
[1:20:54] Accord according to the working of the
[1:20:55] Holy Spirit and the word of God which a
[1:20:58] pastor places it on that you are the
[1:21:01] Church of the Living God and as Paul
[1:21:03] said of old he'll fall down and say
[1:21:06] truly God is with you
[1:21:09] now in these things let it be done with
[1:21:14] reverence and now to the pastor to our
[1:21:18] brother Neville at this time remember he
[1:21:22] is the full head of the
[1:21:25] church brother
[1:21:28] nebble has a
[1:21:30] right to exercise any Authority that the
[1:21:36] Holy Spirit would anything the Holy
[1:21:39] Spirit would tell him to say in other
[1:21:41] words in the church he has a right to
[1:21:44] anything that God would lead him to do
[1:21:47] he also has a right over his Deacon
[1:21:50] board he can change the Deacon board the
[1:21:53] trustees
[1:21:55] or or pianist or any other office in the
[1:21:59] church that he desires to change feeling
[1:22:02] led by the Holy
[1:22:03] Spirit uh to do so and whatever he does
[1:22:08] I'll recognize it as he I believe to be
[1:22:11] a godly man I'll recognize it to be of
[1:22:15] the Lord and will sanction the
[1:22:19] same therefore it gives him the
[1:22:22] authority then to operate the church the
[1:22:24] the way he feels led to do it
[1:22:28] now are any office in the church that he
[1:22:31] desires to to to uh switch uh positions
[1:22:37] with people well he has the authority to
[1:22:40] do that which I trust that this will
[1:22:44] always be lovely and never have to be
[1:22:48] used now may the Lord bless you all and
[1:22:52] I trust that this will be
[1:22:55] uh carried out to the very best of your
[1:22:59] knowledge and may the Holy Spirit watch
[1:23:03] over each one of you and may every
[1:23:07] officer of the church fill his post of
[1:23:10] Duty knowing this that God is going to
[1:23:13] hold you
[1:23:15] responsible for how you help your office
[1:23:19] in the
[1:23:20] church each one will have to give an
[1:23:23] account and to the leoty and the dear
[1:23:27] gifted Saints that's in our church those
[1:23:31] who who prophesy or speak with tongues
[1:23:34] or interpret or have
[1:23:37] Revelations we are just so happy to have
[1:23:40] you in the church and we will give you
[1:23:44] full
[1:23:45] cooperation in everything that the Holy
[1:23:48] Spirit shall prove that he has said to
[1:23:51] you and we love you and we we believe
[1:23:54] that these gifts are in you and that if
[1:23:58] you have the right opportunity and the
[1:24:01] scripturally presentation of it that you
[1:24:04] will make great workers in our midst and
[1:24:10] may the Lord bless you all is my sincere
[1:24:17] prayer
[1:24:19] Christians since listening to this tape
[1:24:22] I have a one thing that I seen I left
[1:24:26] out and that is this that while people
[1:24:30] are speaking with tongues it must be in
[1:24:33] the courses of two or three according to
[1:24:36] the scriptures that is there's only two
[1:24:40] or three messages to be given in each
[1:24:43] single service after that according to
[1:24:46] the scriptures at these course this must
[1:24:49] be only two or three so may you carry
[1:24:53] these things out
[1:24:55] accordingly a way the Holy Spirit has D
[1:24:58] directed it in his Bible and this is the
[1:25:00] best of my knowledge the way to do it
[1:25:03] Paul said let them be by courses two or
[1:25:06] three when they're speaking the Lord
[1:25:08] bless
[1:25:23] you amen am men did he speak to you
[1:25:26] tonight amen don't you love the
[1:25:29] Simplicity of the
[1:25:32] Gospel I'm sitting there and I'm
[1:25:34] wondering in this short about 30 minutes
[1:25:37] he's touched on so many things in very
[1:25:40] simple ways that I just marvel at the
[1:25:43] way these things
[1:25:45] come anyway so this is Brother Braham
[1:25:48] setting the church in order and we all
[1:25:51] understand that uh I at this point he
[1:25:55] had been preaching and many people had
[1:25:57] come in from different denominations and
[1:26:00] with it comes different ways of doing
[1:26:03] things and in his own word he says he
[1:26:06] let it all go he said even he let even
[1:26:09] brother
[1:26:11] nille he felt that let it go till a time
[1:26:15] when he felt the people are more
[1:26:17] established in the
[1:26:19] faith and then from that point on he
[1:26:22] started putting these things in order
[1:26:26] and so I believe it's very relevant for
[1:26:28] us as well to just start looking at
[1:26:31] these things embracing these things and
[1:26:33] working on how
[1:26:36] um it could help us because the
[1:26:38] important thing is this whenever divine
[1:26:41] order is to establish the presence of
[1:26:44] God descends right if anything at all
[1:26:47] that you do once it is done exactly
[1:26:50] according to what God says he comes down
[1:26:52] to prove it he did it for Solomon he did
[1:26:56] it for Moses when the word itself came
[1:27:00] on earth and the word went to the
[1:27:03] prophet and it was baptized he came to
[1:27:06] confirm it at the day of Pentecost when
[1:27:09] they gathered according to the word of
[1:27:11] Jesus so every time this divine order is
[1:27:15] firmly established God comes in our mid
[1:27:18] to confirm it and so that is what I'm
[1:27:22] looking that way
[1:27:24] we listen to these things and look at
[1:27:27] ways that we could also live by it now
[1:27:30] elsewhere not in this message but R says
[1:27:32] take them and remember them as the
[1:27:34] Commandments of God specifically for you
[1:27:37] so God HS us responsible for the place
[1:27:40] we have been placed and then he says I'm
[1:27:43] looking to you to carry these things out
[1:27:46] the way that I'm saying them because
[1:27:48] somebody has to be had around
[1:27:52] here and so I believe everything and the
[1:27:54] membership of the church the the deacons
[1:27:58] and how we come to church early on time
[1:28:01] and and spend our time not talking to
[1:28:04] anybody spend our time praying and just
[1:28:07] being mindful of keeping quiet and not
[1:28:11] disturbing everybody I think a lot has
[1:28:14] is covered in this little T and all the
[1:28:17] other Church order uh tapes actually
[1:28:20] have some good stuff and for me
[1:28:22] personally um
[1:28:25] um one thing that I found very revealing
[1:28:28] is when he mentions
[1:28:30] judges because Paul covers it very
[1:28:32] little like I think in Corinthians Paul
[1:28:35] talks about it in a very short way and
[1:28:37] so I read it and I know that all around
[1:28:40] the world in Christianity many people
[1:28:41] don't know and then he comes and he
[1:28:44] brings breaks it down and tells us how
[1:28:45] it is if you have the gifted meeting and
[1:28:48] the
[1:28:49] judges anyway I'm very grateful that's
[1:28:52] what I want to say I'll invite the
[1:28:53] musician
[1:28:55] CU there isn't much more to go on
[1:29:04] yes so now we all know our duties and
[1:29:07] our
[1:29:08] expectations and so we pray that the
[1:29:10] Lord will be will bless us and help us
[1:29:15] to sech his church in order so that we
[1:29:18] can experience that presence that we so
[1:29:21] long for
[1:29:25] shall we sing leaning on the Everlasting

[1:33:22] you to reveal yourself to us then we are
[1:33:24] convinced that is for purpose oh Lord

[1:33:28] purpose fully on Earth here and so
[1:33:32] father we are relying on you for
[1:33:33] strength we are relying on you for
[1:33:35] leadership we are relying on you for
[1:33:37] guidance we are relying on you for
[1:33:39] protection and yes the Devil comes in
[1:33:42] with so many distractions but father it
[1:33:44] takes you alone to keep us focused on
[1:33:47] life and that is the choice we have made
[1:33:50] oh Lord so father in our own feeble way
[1:33:52] may you encourage us strengthen us oh
[1:33:54] Lord father as we close this evening we
