[55:55] Hallelujah
[55:57] blessed be the name of the Lord welcome
[55:59] to church once again
[56:01] this time on a Sunday night
[56:04] for no other reason than to worship as
[56:07] brother Phil prayed one more time to
[56:10] Worship the Lord
[56:12] what an honor and a privilege it is to
[56:14] be here greet you in the name of the
[56:16] Lord Jesus Christ
[56:18] the name above every name
[56:21] God's chosen place of worship in our day
[56:24] in our age
[56:26] we're certainly thankful that we have
[56:28] Brethren that want to come together and
[56:31] put their shoulder to the wheel
[56:33] we know that this is a lot of pressure
[56:35] for everyone who's not used to doing it
[56:38] everyone from sound technicians to
[56:41] musicians to deacons and to Ministry
[56:46] but we trust that the Lord will be
[56:48] pleased that his will will be
[56:51] accomplished in our lives here
[56:53] this is uh
[56:56] this is the the age the only age
[57:01] where Satan was declared the God of this
[57:03] evil age and we have been chosen to be
[57:06] manifest in this age and you know uh
[57:10] it's just been spoken recently and it's
[57:13] just resounded with me that you know the
[57:15] more Satan comes against the bride in
[57:19] our day he doesn't wear the bride out
[57:22] what he does is he spins his wheels
[57:24] because what happens is every time he
[57:27] comes against the bride what he does is
[57:30] he pushes her closer to him
[57:33] he causes a greater Worship in her all
[57:37] she does is pushes her right back to the
[57:40] Tree of Life once again what an honor
[57:43] and a privilege it is to be recognized
[57:44] as the Bride of Jesus Christ not because
[57:46] of something we've done just because
[57:48] that seat Gene of God was in her from
[57:51] before the foundation of the world and
[57:53] that time that he came and sat down
[57:55] beside her and said get me a drink there
[57:58] is something inside her that just said
[58:00] my goodness I can't help it I I feel
[58:03] like I could get started but it's not my
[58:05] time tonight it's brother Toby's brother
[58:08] Toby we've come expecting we're excited
[58:10] we distrust that the Lord will bless the
[58:13] service tonight in a real special way
[58:15] that as we go forward that our our
[58:18] brothers and our sisters will have the
[58:20] opportunity to have more time to gather
[58:22] together to Fellowship this way
[58:25] we're certainly excited can we sing I
[58:28] love him as we invite brother Toby to
[58:30] come tonight just to take his Liberty
[58:33] speak to us What the Lord Has put on his
[58:35] heart
[58:37] just a course tonight
[58:38] [Music]
[58:40] I love him
[58:43] out I
[58:49] am because
[58:51] [Music]
[58:53] first lovely

[58:59] [Applause]
[59:17] tonight I've seen that once again
[59:21] I love him
[59:25] [Music]
[59:31] because
[59:33] he first love me
[59:40] and
[59:43] purchased mine solving
[59:51] on call
[59:55] Grace
[59:58] tree the Lord bless you brothers and
[1:00:01] sisters just a few of us here but I know
[1:00:08] um it's just a great opportunity to be
[1:00:11] in church on a Sunday evening I was
[1:00:12] thinking about it
[1:00:14] um you know based on what brother brand
[1:00:16] told us
[1:00:18] the first person to start an evening
[1:00:20] service was God himself
[1:00:22] he said in the cool of the evening it
[1:00:25] will come and have Fellowship
[1:00:27] with Adam and Eve
[1:00:29] and it's such a privilege for us to be
[1:00:32] gathered tonight and forgot to lay it in
[1:00:34] the heart of our pastor
[1:00:36] for us to have Sunday evening services
[1:00:41] I'm particularly thrilled that we have
[1:00:44] this opportunity
[1:00:46] I know there's something special that
[1:00:49] God has for us
[1:00:52] um in every service but of course when
[1:00:54] we have the evening service as well his
[1:00:57] presence will be as much here as he's
[1:01:00] always been
[1:01:02] bow with me this evening to say a few
[1:01:05] words to him dear father
[1:01:08] foreign
[1:01:12] to spend part of our day
[1:01:14] in your presence
[1:01:17] Lord we know your presence is always
[1:01:19] with us
[1:01:21] but it was also the word
[1:01:23] that told us their lord Jesus that we
[1:01:26] should redeem the time
[1:01:28] knowing that the days are evil
[1:01:31] and Lord that's
[1:01:33] interpretation Lord Jesus of the
[1:01:35] original Greek word Lord talks about
[1:01:37] time not as a space Lord Jesus of
[1:01:42] period Lord put more of an opportunity
[1:01:46] that every opportunity that we have
[1:01:49] to spend with you to build our
[1:01:51] relationship with you to be closer to
[1:01:54] you their lord Jesus to hear something
[1:01:57] that is good
[1:01:59] Lord in your sights that we take
[1:02:02] advantage of that opportunity
[1:02:05] that's what we're doing tonight dear
[1:02:07] Lord Jesus is not something we are used
[1:02:09] to to regarded Lord Jesus perhaps in the
[1:02:13] homes Lord around the screen their
[1:02:15] father
[1:02:17] listening to the word of God on a Sunday
[1:02:19] evening
[1:02:20] but Lord we've identified another
[1:02:24] opportunity their lord Jesus to to spend
[1:02:28] time with you because the days are
[1:02:30] getting more and more evil their lord
[1:02:32] Jesus
[1:02:33] and Lord we want to take advantage of
[1:02:35] every opportunity to get closer to you
[1:02:37] to hear more about you to hear less
[1:02:40] about the world and the things of the
[1:02:42] world
[1:02:43] we just pray you be with us tonight dear
[1:02:45] Lord Jesus Take me out of the way there
[1:02:48] Lord Jesus I've got nothing to present
[1:02:51] to your people Lord other than what you
[1:02:53] have Lord if it's from me Lord it will
[1:02:56] be a waste of time oh master I just pray
[1:02:59] there Lord Jesus let me step out of the
[1:03:01] way completely dear Lord Jesus and speak
[1:03:04] to us tonight dear Lord Jesus everyone
[1:03:07] there father Lord who's gathered here in
[1:03:10] the in the sanctuary Lord or even in
[1:03:12] their homes Lord May the presence of the
[1:03:14] Lord be there maybe felt their lord
[1:03:17] Jesus May everything become Lord that
[1:03:19] everyone will listen to the word that
[1:03:22] you have to say to us for this short
[1:03:25] period of time tonight dear Lord be with
[1:03:27] us dear father wherever your Saints are
[1:03:29] gathered Lord Jesus oh I've gathered
[1:03:31] Lord during the day
[1:03:33] May the words though Jesus Christ have
[1:03:35] been spoken May the mind of God has been
[1:03:38] expressed to the bride of Christ today
[1:03:39] their lord Jesus Builder up Lord until
[1:03:43] she be thoroughly furnished unto all
[1:03:45] good works according to the scriptures
[1:03:48] do this for us tonight their lord Jesus
[1:03:50] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:03:54] amen the Lord bless you thank you so
[1:03:56] much musicians the Lord bless you
[1:03:59] greatly
[1:04:00] you will please turn with me tonight
[1:04:02] I've got two portions of scripture to
[1:04:04] read
[1:04:06] first Joshua chapter 5
[1:04:09] will take three verses
[1:04:13] Joshua 5 and verse 13. we go into verse
[1:04:18] 15.
[1:04:24] Joshua 5
[1:04:27] from verse 13.
[1:04:30] and it came to pass when Joshua was by
[1:04:33] Jericho
[1:04:34] that a lifted up his eyes and looked and
[1:04:37] behold Theirs to the man over against
[1:04:40] him with a sword drawn in his hand
[1:04:43] and Joshua went unto him and said unto
[1:04:46] him as thou for us or for our
[1:04:50] anniversaries
[1:04:52] and he said nay but as captain of the
[1:04:55] host of the Lord am I now come
[1:04:58] and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth
[1:05:02] and did worship and said unto him
[1:05:05] worship my Lord unto his servants
[1:05:09] and the captain of the Lord's host said
[1:05:11] unto Joshua lose thy sure from off thy
[1:05:15] foot
[1:05:16] for the place we are on thou standest is
[1:05:19] Holy and Joshua did so
[1:05:22] let's just read Ephesians chapter 6
[1:05:26] if you don't mind just
[1:05:30] four verses from there
[1:05:35] Ephesians 6 and verse 10.
[1:05:39] I'll read on to verse 13.
[1:05:46] says finally my brethren
[1:05:49] be strong in the Lord and in the power
[1:05:53] of His might
[1:05:55] put on the old armor of God
[1:05:58] that ye may be able to stand against the
[1:06:02] walls of the devil
[1:06:05] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:06:08] blood and I want us to note here that
[1:06:09] he's saying that our contexts
[1:06:12] our contests or fight or
[1:06:16] our position is not against flesh and
[1:06:19] blood it's not against humans it's not
[1:06:21] against
[1:06:22] people that have flesh and blood
[1:06:24] but against principalities
[1:06:27] against Powers against the rulers of the
[1:06:30] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:06:33] wickedness in high places
[1:06:36] those are the things that we're going to
[1:06:39] fight that we're meant to fight against
[1:06:41] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:06:43] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[1:06:46] in the evil day
[1:06:48] and having done all to stand
[1:06:52] let's speak to the author of the word
[1:06:54] their lord
[1:06:56] your Prophet said Lord Jesus is such a
[1:06:59] profound statement
[1:07:00] that any man can open the pages of the
[1:07:03] scripture
[1:07:05] and read something Lord out of it
[1:07:08] but Lord Jesus without the context of
[1:07:12] this scripture the reason for which you
[1:07:14] give the scripture
[1:07:15] is just theology
[1:07:18] we don't want theology tonight their
[1:07:20] lord Jesus
[1:07:22] we want Lord Jesus the real thing
[1:07:24] which is revelation
[1:07:26] Lord may you bring the revelation of
[1:07:28] your word to us tonight dear father that
[1:07:31] when we leave this place
[1:07:33] our feet will be light because we know
[1:07:36] that without an encounter like Jacob did
[1:07:39] their father
[1:07:40] when he met with you
[1:07:42] and his walk entirely changed let that
[1:07:46] be Lord Jesus Christ a refreshing of
[1:07:49] that anointing of the Holy Spirit Upon
[1:07:51] Our Lives their lord Jesus
[1:07:53] deep down within our souls their lord
[1:07:55] Jesus
[1:07:56] that will know that you've truly visited
[1:07:59] us tonight
[1:08:00] may you hear a prayer there Lord in
[1:08:02] Jesus name we pray amen may please be
[1:08:06] seated
[1:08:07] tonight I want to speak
[1:08:10] um on the weapons of our Warfare for
[1:08:13] adoption the weapons of our Warfare for
[1:08:17] adoption
[1:08:18] and tonight I want to
[1:08:20] hopefully by the grace of God will be
[1:08:22] done in good time I
[1:08:23] try not to hold people back on the
[1:08:26] evening service should be a short
[1:08:27] service I totally agree with that and
[1:08:30] I'm trusting the Lord to just
[1:08:32] say something to us tonight that will be
[1:08:34] a blessing
[1:08:37] um first part of my thought is from
[1:08:40] adoption you know brother Brian put the
[1:08:42] message adoption
[1:08:44] and the second path part of it program
[1:08:48] actually preached a couple messages that
[1:08:50] had to do with putting all the old Armor
[1:08:52] of God he preached putting on the whole
[1:08:55] armor of God but also preached on the
[1:08:58] greatest battle ever fought
[1:09:00] and we see in Joshua the first place we
[1:09:03] read you know brother Brahm told us in
[1:09:05] adoption that Joshua
[1:09:07] parallels Ephesians
[1:09:09] and the reason Weber LeBron said that is
[1:09:12] that in Joshua we found Joshua the
[1:09:15] seventh of Moses I always get fascinated
[1:09:18] by that you know the Bible explaining
[1:09:21] that Joshua was the seventh of Moses and
[1:09:23] Moses being the servant of God and
[1:09:25] Joshua the seventh of Moses was given a
[1:09:28] task
[1:09:29] that task was to take the people of
[1:09:32] Israel across Jordan but mainly the
[1:09:36] responsibility was for him to
[1:09:37] positionally place them in the Promised
[1:09:40] Land
[1:09:41] and the Brahma also told us that in our
[1:09:45] own age the Holy Spirit
[1:09:47] bringing us over Jordan Crossing Jordan
[1:09:50] from a life of sin to a life of
[1:09:53] righteousness brings us into a place
[1:09:56] where the Holy Spirit takes us and
[1:09:58] positionally placed Us in the body of
[1:10:01] Christ
[1:10:03] and looking at how this is
[1:10:06] also said that when Josh shouted them
[1:10:08] across the river Jordan
[1:10:11] and they go to the promised land they
[1:10:14] didn't just start to find their place
[1:10:16] they had to fight for every inch of
[1:10:19] ground
[1:10:21] and that's the same thing that happens
[1:10:22] when we become Christians when we become
[1:10:26] filled with the Holy Ghost when we
[1:10:28] become enlisted into the army of the
[1:10:30] Lord we are brought into a place where
[1:10:33] we've got to fight for every inch of
[1:10:36] ground
[1:10:37] so tonight I want to
[1:10:40] kind of take us into
[1:10:42] you know this the responsibility we have
[1:10:45] as soldiers of the Cross and when we're
[1:10:47] coming you know in the car we had gone
[1:10:49] out
[1:10:50] um before I came here with family
[1:10:53] um and my son was saying in the car
[1:10:55] Matthias was saying Oh Daddy I hear you
[1:10:57] preaching tonight and I said yes and he
[1:11:00] said Daddy what are you going to talk
[1:11:01] about I said well you just listen when I
[1:11:03] talk and you get to know what I'm going
[1:11:05] to talk about and he said Daddy I hope
[1:11:07] you tell us stories
[1:11:09] so I'm going to try to bring some form
[1:11:12] of story but actually what I want to do
[1:11:13] tonight is paint a picture of a drummer
[1:11:18] um dramatized this
[1:11:21] what I would call a mission briefing
[1:11:24] you know if you look at Joshua he would
[1:11:26] have had we ever read Joshua had already
[1:11:30] been given the commission
[1:11:32] it was given the commission
[1:11:35] to take the children of Israel into the
[1:11:37] promised land and positionally placed
[1:11:39] them
[1:11:40] but where we read showed us that cross
[1:11:44] Jordan that was when he had an encounter
[1:11:46] with a man
[1:11:49] and because Joshua had that Commission
[1:11:52] he had no fear he had no fear he came in
[1:11:55] there and the first thing he said to the
[1:11:57] man is are you for us or against us
[1:12:01] are you part of us or you are enemy
[1:12:03] because he had been given a commission
[1:12:05] that if you are my enemy
[1:12:08] you're gone
[1:12:10] you know he had no doubts there was no
[1:12:12] fear in his heart
[1:12:14] he didn't look at the stature of the man
[1:12:16] he didn't look at the weapons that the
[1:12:18] man had he had a commission that once I
[1:12:23] have anyone that's against me that
[1:12:25] person cannot stand
[1:12:27] and then he discovered that this person
[1:12:29] was actually the captain
[1:12:32] and if we go on to chapter 6 of Joshua
[1:12:37] he started by saying that the Lord told
[1:12:39] Joshua what to do God told Joshua you
[1:12:42] know that was when God actually gave
[1:12:43] instructions on how they were going to
[1:12:46] conquer Jericho
[1:12:48] but first he had to meet
[1:12:51] the captain of the Lost hosts
[1:12:53] and tonight I want us to also realize
[1:12:56] that The Holy Spirits is our
[1:12:59] commander-in-chief is the captain of the
[1:13:02] Lost host but in this Bible he has also
[1:13:06] told us what to do
[1:13:08] like the captain of the Lost horse came
[1:13:10] and told Joshua this is how we are going
[1:13:12] to conquer Jericho Jericho you've got
[1:13:15] enemies in Jericho the way you are going
[1:13:17] to actually get this is not just
[1:13:20] something that you're going to guess
[1:13:23] human intellects will say well we need
[1:13:25] to have a strategy we are going into a
[1:13:28] war this is how we're going to do it
[1:13:30] but the captain of the host of the Lord
[1:13:33] it was the only one that was qualified
[1:13:36] to give instruction
[1:13:39] I'm not never been on the military I've
[1:13:41] never been in any power military
[1:13:44] organizations such to say
[1:13:46] but we'll realize that in those
[1:13:49] organizations they don't just come
[1:13:51] together and go to a war for no you know
[1:13:54] without any instructions
[1:13:56] and I want to bring a bit to you know of
[1:13:58] of what I found online that this people
[1:14:03] this kind of military organizations do
[1:14:07] um when they're going to go into like an
[1:14:09] operation or a mission
[1:14:12] um so this is talking about Mission
[1:14:14] briefing here
[1:14:16] as the key to effective communication
[1:14:18] the few things I found fascinating
[1:14:21] and and we'll bring it and then we bring
[1:14:23] it to the world and let's see what the
[1:14:24] word has told us
[1:14:26] what has the war the word of God told us
[1:14:29] about how we should fight our enemy
[1:14:32] what are the things we need to know
[1:14:34] because when we know these things it
[1:14:37] brings us to an awareness
[1:14:41] now it says here nobody likes being in
[1:14:43] the dark
[1:14:44] the mind can play terrible games when
[1:14:46] you find yourself operating in a
[1:14:49] communication vacuum indeed the most
[1:14:52] carefully plans can be on the Mind by
[1:14:55] poor communication
[1:14:57] the feeling of anxiety brought on by an
[1:14:59] emergency or a rapid changing
[1:15:01] environment is what fighter pilots refer
[1:15:05] to as tumbleweed
[1:15:07] picture or tumble with blowing aimlessly
[1:15:10] at the mercy of the Wind
[1:15:12] when you tumble weed in the jet fighter
[1:15:16] that's exactly how you feel
[1:15:19] when I was reading that I was saying to
[1:15:20] myself that many times
[1:15:22] you get in situations
[1:15:25] and just because
[1:15:26] we are not Discerning of that situation
[1:15:29] based on what God has told us in the
[1:15:32] word we are in kind of a tumbleweed we
[1:15:34] don't know what's going on sometimes we
[1:15:36] put that blame on our brother sometimes
[1:15:39] on our sister sometimes on our spouses
[1:15:42] because the world has told us that we do
[1:15:44] not wrestle against flesh and blood
[1:15:48] many times because of our lack of
[1:15:51] awareness we focus on the flesh and
[1:15:54] blood
[1:15:56] now he said
[1:15:58] adrift with no situational awareness you
[1:16:02] are of no value to the mission or the
[1:16:05] team
[1:16:06] going dark and not knowing exactly what
[1:16:09] is happening can reduce even the
[1:16:12] seasoned combat pilot
[1:16:14] to a powerless
[1:16:16] ineffective second guesser
[1:16:21] and wreak havoc on your mission
[1:16:24] in combat and in business
[1:16:28] just because of lack of awareness
[1:16:31] he said the opposite of being in the
[1:16:33] dark is having high situational
[1:16:36] awareness or essay as we call it in the
[1:16:39] fighter pilot world
[1:16:41] situational awareness is the lifeblood
[1:16:44] of a mission
[1:16:47] being aware of the situation being aware
[1:16:50] of what's going on being aware of how to
[1:16:53] react being aware of the taxes of your
[1:16:57] enemy
[1:17:00] being aware of your own weapons as well
[1:17:03] what have we been given he said does the
[1:17:06] lifeblood of emission and it's a
[1:17:08] byproduct of knowing where you and your
[1:17:11] winged men are where you're going and
[1:17:15] all the variables that can affect the
[1:17:17] mission feral location of enemy to reign
[1:17:21] when you're situational awareness is
[1:17:25] high
[1:17:27] you can adapt to changes quickly
[1:17:30] and maintain Mission effectiveness
[1:17:34] without it you're useless
[1:17:37] now let's go to the word
[1:17:40] and just let's have a picture of the
[1:17:42] Holy Spirit giving us a brief you know
[1:17:44] Mission briefing tonight
[1:17:46] as soldiers of the cross that we are
[1:17:49] and I've got a few points here which I
[1:17:51] took from what the ram said in those
[1:17:53] messages there are five of them the
[1:17:55] first point is we are in a war
[1:18:00] LeBron said that the message testimony
[1:18:02] raisin dead boy 53 1203
[1:18:07] he said you've got to go do it
[1:18:10] you've got to go fight for every inch of
[1:18:14] ground that you have
[1:18:17] every man in here that's born again of
[1:18:20] the spirit of God knows that you've had
[1:18:23] to fight for every inch of ground
[1:18:26] toward the mark
[1:18:29] to conform rigorously to a rule or
[1:18:33] standard that's the definition of to the
[1:18:36] mark
[1:18:37] with Satan
[1:18:39] we've got to tow the mark with Satan we
[1:18:42] know that I used to say that Satan is
[1:18:44] very aggressive
[1:18:47] and pushy and enforcing you know
[1:18:50] compared to the spirit of God that is
[1:18:52] very timid
[1:18:55] God will never Force his will on man but
[1:18:58] Satan forces his will
[1:19:00] we have daily comebacks with Satan like
[1:19:04] Paul said when I will do good evil is
[1:19:07] present
[1:19:10] he said my heart in my heart I desire to
[1:19:13] do what is right but when I want to do
[1:19:15] what is right evil is present he said
[1:19:18] it's clear it is not me that wants to do
[1:19:21] the wrong I'm not the one doing the
[1:19:23] wrong is the evil in me that is doing
[1:19:26] what is wrong
[1:19:28] but the problem said he's in that's
[1:19:30] right friends this is not a picnic
[1:19:35] this is a Battleground
[1:19:37] see we never come here to eat cookies
[1:19:40] and so forth
[1:19:41] we're in a battle
[1:19:43] and the first thing we need to
[1:19:45] understand is we're in a battle we face
[1:19:47] it every day
[1:19:49] many times when our situational
[1:19:50] awareness is low we don't realize that
[1:19:53] we're in the battle and then what
[1:19:55] happens is we are totally clueless
[1:19:58] we cannot interpret the situation
[1:20:01] correctly
[1:20:03] the second thing that you said soldiers
[1:20:05] of the cross
[1:20:07] is that the enemy can meet you anywhere
[1:20:11] the enemy this enemy that we are
[1:20:13] fighting it can meet us anywhere
[1:20:17] and if you actually think about soldiers
[1:20:21] um back in Africa
[1:20:23] when in Nigeria specifically
[1:20:26] um I think the Nigerian Army
[1:20:29] is well recognized for like ground level
[1:20:33] combats
[1:20:35] because you've got a rainforest so now
[1:20:38] in Nigeria there's a lot of
[1:20:40] um there's there's some
[1:20:42] Insurgency that's going on in the
[1:20:44] northern part of Nigeria we've got
[1:20:46] terrorist groups and because these
[1:20:48] people kind of hide under you know in
[1:20:51] the forest and all
[1:20:52] these soldiers need to actually get on
[1:20:54] the ground and attack the enemy
[1:20:58] and you realize that this kind of
[1:21:00] soldiers
[1:21:01] they've got to be aware of what's
[1:21:04] happening in their environment because
[1:21:08] a little lack of awareness could mean
[1:21:11] that they're going to lose their life
[1:21:15] so we must realize that we are in that
[1:21:18] kind of situation
[1:21:20] Satan comes to us and meets us just in
[1:21:24] any place it meets us on our mobile
[1:21:26] phones when we are actually trying to do
[1:21:29] something that is right
[1:21:31] it meets us when we're I think I should
[1:21:34] just let Robert Brown speak here but the
[1:21:36] brand said in putting on the old armor
[1:21:37] of God
[1:21:38] and so Paul here is speaking of a
[1:21:40] soldier dressing going to war and that's
[1:21:44] further down
[1:21:45] you know where we read if you actually
[1:21:48] go to verse 14 of Ephesians 6 it starts
[1:21:52] to talk about you know the putting on
[1:21:54] the old Armor of God what actually are
[1:21:56] those brother Paul was using an example
[1:21:59] of a Roman soldier to talk about the
[1:22:02] armor that we've got to wear as
[1:22:04] Christians and we'll get to that
[1:22:06] so brother Brown said Paul here speaking
[1:22:08] of a soldier dressing going to war a
[1:22:10] soldier getting himself in armor
[1:22:12] preparing for the battle
[1:22:14] and I kind of like the way that he
[1:22:16] places it preparation
[1:22:21] he said you know I believe it was
[1:22:22] Lincoln that said one time in the time
[1:22:24] of peace
[1:22:26] prepare for war
[1:22:28] or it might have been he but it sounds
[1:22:30] like seems to me rather it was he that
[1:22:33] made that statement
[1:22:34] in the time of peace prepare for war and
[1:22:38] that will be a good thing for us
[1:22:41] to think about
[1:22:43] in time when everything is running
[1:22:45] smooth
[1:22:47] you better get ready
[1:22:50] for Satan isn't going to let it run
[1:22:53] smooth very long
[1:22:56] you know I used to say to myself
[1:22:59] when I see my prayer life going down
[1:23:02] that's I shouldn't wait for God to bring
[1:23:04] a trial
[1:23:06] before I start to pray
[1:23:09] sometimes you see a trial comes to the
[1:23:11] family maybe someone is sick and that's
[1:23:13] when we actually get into having our
[1:23:15] prayer meeting our personal prayer
[1:23:17] meetings our personal night visuals
[1:23:19] that's why without the status is saying
[1:23:22] here that we should be ready
[1:23:25] before the battle actually comes you
[1:23:28] better get ready for Satan isn't going
[1:23:30] to let it run smooth very long you are
[1:23:32] in a convention now so that we're in a
[1:23:34] convention when program was preaching
[1:23:35] this message and everything will just
[1:23:37] pull along fine
[1:23:41] but you're going to live here in a few
[1:23:42] days and you are going to meet the enemy
[1:23:47] it might not even wait till you get
[1:23:50] ready to leave
[1:23:53] he might attack any time
[1:23:57] is wicked and ruthless
[1:24:00] it just carries on whenever he can
[1:24:04] whatever he can say or do he does it
[1:24:07] right now
[1:24:08] so it's best to be dressed all the time
[1:24:14] now but Abraham is giving us examples of
[1:24:16] where we can meet this devil
[1:24:18] you might meet him out on the streets
[1:24:22] how many of us have Mexican on the
[1:24:23] streets yeah it's getting to Summer now
[1:24:27] and you're going to see all the women
[1:24:29] dressed naked
[1:24:30] and you can hardly just focus because
[1:24:33] distractions there and there there's no
[1:24:35] way you look at
[1:24:36] they're all naked
[1:24:40] he said you might meet him in the car
[1:24:45] sometimes you're driving you're just
[1:24:46] doing the right thing
[1:24:48] and someone feels you've done something
[1:24:49] wrong and they use curse words on you
[1:24:54] you might meet him in the car remember I
[1:24:56] said we are not wrestling against flesh
[1:24:58] and blood those people are just vessels
[1:25:01] being used by Satan
[1:25:03] but God is there watching what our
[1:25:06] reaction is going to be because that
[1:25:09] itself is the battle
[1:25:11] remember what we are fighting for
[1:25:14] is the character of Christ
[1:25:18] what we are fighting for is to get to
[1:25:21] that place where we can say that we are
[1:25:22] fully conformed to the image of the son
[1:25:25] of God
[1:25:27] that's the promise that we've been given
[1:25:28] and that's what we are fighting for
[1:25:33] and that's what Satan is preventing us
[1:25:35] from getting to
[1:25:37] the brand said he will meet you right in
[1:25:40] the seats there
[1:25:42] and me writes are the pulpit here
[1:25:48] you know the first time I read it I said
[1:25:50] isn't Satan's kids to meet the prophet
[1:25:53] of the pulpit
[1:25:55] but the prophet said yes
[1:25:57] it could be a thought coming
[1:25:58] it could be him wandering away it could
[1:26:00] be him feeling less of himself and Satan
[1:26:03] telling him you know the people are not
[1:26:05] even listening to you
[1:26:10] that is the accuser of the brethren
[1:26:13] Iran said he might meet me and me right
[1:26:15] out of open here anywhere is just Wicked
[1:26:19] and he doesn't care
[1:26:22] so we want to be prepared for it
[1:26:28] amen
[1:26:30] glory to God
[1:26:32] let's hear the third point
[1:26:36] I think this will make us very
[1:26:38] excited
[1:26:39] he said our captain of the host knows
[1:26:42] the enemy so well
[1:26:45] and has given us the best weapon
[1:26:47] to fight the enemy with
[1:26:50] he knows the enemy so well that he has
[1:26:53] given us the best weapon to fight the
[1:26:55] enemy with but the brand says in the
[1:26:57] same message paragraph 23 so we find out
[1:26:59] that this secretes agents of the enemy
[1:27:01] that sits around
[1:27:03] each Nation now will equip its man with
[1:27:07] the latest equipment
[1:27:09] the very latest
[1:27:11] and they study and they do everything
[1:27:13] they are trying to counteract the other
[1:27:16] fellow's weapons
[1:27:18] and to get a little more modern weapons
[1:27:21] something with a little more punch to it
[1:27:24] from the bow and arrow to a musket and
[1:27:27] from a musket to a modern rifle and from
[1:27:30] that to an atomic they just keep
[1:27:31] building
[1:27:33] and it keeps them busy all the time and
[1:27:36] it's the nation's business if they want
[1:27:38] to survive they want to equip their
[1:27:40] soldiers with the best equipment that
[1:27:43] there is
[1:27:45] that's why a small nation that has that
[1:27:48] is even depending on let's say the US
[1:27:51] to supply military equipment to them
[1:27:54] will not just one day get crazy and say
[1:27:56] well I'm going to try and go fight the
[1:27:58] US
[1:28:00] because they know that they don't have
[1:28:01] the weapons
[1:28:02] that's as strong as what the US has got
[1:28:06] well God you know is infinite
[1:28:11] see it doesn't have to think anything
[1:28:14] better
[1:28:16] he just got the best to begin with
[1:28:20] see the nations are thinking about how
[1:28:22] to get better weapons how they move from
[1:28:25] boy and arrow all the way to atomic
[1:28:27] bombs now and even maybe some more
[1:28:30] but God doesn't have to get better
[1:28:33] God kneel it all from the beginning
[1:28:37] is not reducing the knowledge and wisdom
[1:28:39] is not increasing in knowledge and
[1:28:42] wisdom
[1:28:44] so you can't improve on it nothing to be
[1:28:48] done about it it just give us the best
[1:28:52] and I'm so happy that that's so simple
[1:28:55] because the same weapon he gave to Adam
[1:28:57] and Eve on the garden is the same weapon
[1:29:00] he has given to us that weapon is as
[1:29:03] potent as it was in the beginning is
[1:29:06] still as potent today
[1:29:09] so you can't improve on it nothing to be
[1:29:11] done about it it just gives us the best
[1:29:13] that is his word
[1:29:18] the weapon that God has given us is as
[1:29:21] simple as knowing that is just the word
[1:29:23] and if we look into you know
[1:29:25] I believe
[1:29:27] Matthew chapter 4 and I guess Mark
[1:29:29] chapter 4 as well we saw Jesus actually
[1:29:32] get into his own battle
[1:29:34] you know brother I believe brother James
[1:29:37] that said
[1:29:38] you know in the Bible that all that is
[1:29:41] in the world
[1:29:42] the lust of the flesh the Lost of the
[1:29:44] eyes the pride of life and if you go
[1:29:47] back to see the Temptation that Jesus
[1:29:49] went through you will realize that all
[1:29:51] that Satan tempted Jesus with were those
[1:29:54] three things
[1:29:56] the loss of the flesh
[1:29:58] if you are the Son of God take the
[1:30:01] stones and turn it to bread
[1:30:03] why because his body was hungry the
[1:30:05] flesh wanted food and he told him
[1:30:09] listen to your flesh rather than listen
[1:30:11] to the word
[1:30:13] and what Jesus did was he brought the
[1:30:16] word and said well this is my weapon
[1:30:17] this is what I've been given this will
[1:30:20] defeat Satan any day any time under any
[1:30:24] circumstance
[1:30:26] and when Jesus presented the word he
[1:30:29] defeated the enemy
[1:30:31] this next thing he told him I'll take
[1:30:34] you up to the temple you know look at
[1:30:37] everything the three has cast yourself
[1:30:39] down
[1:30:40] pride of life
[1:30:42] so that I can show that he's that
[1:30:44] powerful
[1:30:46] you know lust of the eyes he told him
[1:30:48] look at everything that's in this world
[1:30:50] take a short course I'll give them to
[1:30:53] you now Jesus didn't contest the fact
[1:30:55] that Satan owned
[1:30:57] everything
[1:30:59] in the world sit and claim that this is
[1:31:01] all mine the kingdoms of the world are
[1:31:03] mine Jesus they say no that's not true
[1:31:04] because actually Satan is the God of
[1:31:07] this evil age and Jesus admitted that
[1:31:10] that's true
[1:31:11] so these three things which were the
[1:31:13] three things that he fell for if you go
[1:31:15] to Genesis when he talked about the
[1:31:17] fruits you're going to see
[1:31:19] how the Bible described it it was good
[1:31:21] for food Pleasant to the eyes
[1:31:24] um and it was going to make one wise
[1:31:28] same thing lust of the flesh lost of the
[1:31:31] highest pride of life
[1:31:33] if failed to present the word but Jesus
[1:31:36] showed us the example
[1:31:39] you know we're going to also see what
[1:31:41] Eve said
[1:31:42] um and why she was wrong so God gives
[1:31:44] his people the best the very best and
[1:31:47] that's what he chose for his children
[1:31:49] the very very best
[1:31:53] but the program said I'm so glad of that
[1:31:55] I see God our Father and the kingdom
[1:31:58] that we are delegates of
[1:32:01] is infinite
[1:32:03] so the third thing let's remember
[1:32:05] a captain of the hosts are seeing C the
[1:32:09] commander-in-chief the Holy Ghost he
[1:32:12] knows the enemy so well
[1:32:14] and because it's infinite and knows all
[1:32:18] the things
[1:32:19] that will ever happen to us he knew it
[1:32:22] from the beginning he found the best
[1:32:25] weapon
[1:32:26] which is his word and gave that to us
[1:32:30] now the next point is your enemy will
[1:32:33] attack your weapon
[1:32:36] your enemy will attack your weapon so
[1:32:40] your enemy is aware that you have a very
[1:32:42] strong weapon and what the enemy is
[1:32:45] actually doing brothers and sisters
[1:32:48] Satan is not out to attack you
[1:32:52] Satan is out to attack your faith in the
[1:32:55] world
[1:32:56] because Satan knows that if you can
[1:32:58] doubt that word then he has no more work
[1:33:01] to do
[1:33:03] is just going to go on a vacation
[1:33:06] because everything we start crumbling
[1:33:09] because you have been disarmed he has
[1:33:13] taken your weapon from you
[1:33:15] so we've got to be aware that our enemy
[1:33:18] Satan will attack our weapon which is
[1:33:21] the word of God Abraham said here now we
[1:33:24] find out God gave his children the best
[1:33:27] and therefore you don't have to improve
[1:33:29] it
[1:33:30] it never changes he hasn't changed one
[1:33:32] bit since the first time he gave for his
[1:33:36] children his protection
[1:33:38] there's war in heaven you have to kick
[1:33:40] out Satan then you come down the Earth
[1:33:42] and fortified his children with his word
[1:33:46] I want to ask you something just think
[1:33:49] now if did not while she's standing on
[1:33:53] this great Fortress of his word
[1:33:56] now Satan was on the outside
[1:33:59] trying to use some kind of a technique
[1:34:01] to get her
[1:34:03] out of there for as long as she stayed
[1:34:06] behind the word everything was fine
[1:34:11] was looking for a technique to get Eve
[1:34:15] out of
[1:34:16] standing behind the work
[1:34:20] he knew that all he needed to do is just
[1:34:23] make her doubt the word
[1:34:25] that's where we make our mistake
[1:34:29] we make a mistake when we get from
[1:34:31] behind the world
[1:34:34] so I believe all Bible Believers think
[1:34:38] it that way we get from behind the word
[1:34:40] then we get in trouble
[1:34:42] but as long as we keep the word ahead of
[1:34:44] us
[1:34:46] LeBron said don't get ahead of the word
[1:34:48] let the word get ahead of you
[1:34:52] see you just let it go first and you
[1:34:56] just live right behind it
[1:34:59] let the word go first let the word
[1:35:02] direct her path David said your word is
[1:35:05] a lamp unto my feet and the light onto
[1:35:09] my path
[1:35:10] that word will guide me I will follow
[1:35:14] what the word says if the word tells me
[1:35:16] that whenever the doors are open I
[1:35:18] should be there then I shall be there
[1:35:22] because he knows what is best for me
[1:35:26] so Satan we attack our weapon
[1:35:30] sometimes we try everything he can to
[1:35:33] make us doubt the word Satan will try
[1:35:35] everything he can to make us not to even
[1:35:38] know the words
[1:35:40] because when you don't know the word
[1:35:42] then how can you
[1:35:46] brother Gilbert that told us that weeks
[1:35:49] back Faith comment by hearing the words
[1:35:53] if we fail to hear the word we cannot
[1:35:55] have faith
[1:35:58] so Satan we attack your weapon
[1:36:01] so we must be conscious of that we must
[1:36:04] have so much confidence in the weapon
[1:36:06] that we don't we guard it
[1:36:09] with all of our might and don't let
[1:36:11] Satan come to take us out of behind the
[1:36:14] world
[1:36:16] now the last one says
[1:36:18] to come out of this war as an overcomer
[1:36:22] every armor that has been given to you
[1:36:26] must be worn at all times
[1:36:32] we might not get the time to actually
[1:36:34] dig in into each of this
[1:36:36] armor that brother Paul talked about in
[1:36:38] Ephesians 6 but let's just read what
[1:36:40] program said as Bill Bram explained it
[1:36:42] in the message the greatest battle ever
[1:36:45] thought
[1:36:46] your mom said now listen
[1:36:48] all ye soldiers now how many of us are
[1:36:50] soldiers of the cross
[1:36:52] absolutely we have been enlisted into
[1:36:55] the army of God the Braham said that
[1:36:56] once you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:59] Ghost you have been enlisted into the
[1:37:01] army of God
[1:37:05] yes Satan was after you before you got
[1:37:09] the Holy Ghost
[1:37:11] but that was just Child's Play
[1:37:14] compared to what happens after you get
[1:37:16] the Holy Ghost but when I said that some
[1:37:18] people will tell you when you become a
[1:37:19] Christian it's a flowery Bed of Roses he
[1:37:21] said that's not true
[1:37:23] he said it's either that it's either
[1:37:24] they've not experienced it or they are
[1:37:27] telling you a lie
[1:37:29] he said when you become a Christian then
[1:37:32] Satan turns to you
[1:37:34] all of his weapons
[1:37:37] any way that he can get you it focuses
[1:37:40] his entire attention on you
[1:37:43] because then he knows that you are now
[1:37:45] an enlisted enemy
[1:37:48] now for us as soldiers of the cross
[1:37:51] The Prophet by the holy spirit is
[1:37:53] telling us this evening now listen to
[1:37:56] All You Soldiers now just before we
[1:37:58] start the prayer line
[1:38:00] take unto you the w h o l e the all not
[1:38:07] just part of it
[1:38:09] the whole armor of God that you may be
[1:38:12] able to withstand in the evil day
[1:38:16] but Abraham said the evil day is the day
[1:38:19] we are living in
[1:38:23] so can we say that God intentionally
[1:38:25] gave this
[1:38:28] inspiration to Paul the Apostle
[1:38:31] thousands of years ago to put this down
[1:38:34] write this letter to the Ephesians and
[1:38:37] God ensure that it was recorded so we
[1:38:40] can get this information
[1:38:44] to give us the situation awareness the
[1:38:47] situational awareness that we can't do
[1:38:49] without any of this
[1:38:51] um armor that we've been given
[1:38:54] but Iran said the evil day that's the
[1:38:56] day we are living in and having done all
[1:38:59] to stand
[1:39:02] stand amen get that see honey brother
[1:39:06] Brahman speaks to the Sick Sister when
[1:39:08] you don't know you can do to stand then
[1:39:13] stand don't move
[1:39:17] stand don't the only way that Roman
[1:39:22] soldier can keep standing
[1:39:24] is when he's still in good States
[1:39:28] because when the hour of the enemy hits
[1:39:31] it
[1:39:31] in a bad spot it can continue to stand
[1:39:33] it's going to fall now he's telling us
[1:39:36] how we can stand
[1:39:40] there for having your loins
[1:39:43] but the Bible said listen at this listen
[1:39:45] here what this is your loins that's your
[1:39:48] middle part here says guarded about with
[1:39:53] truth what is the truth the word of God
[1:39:57] that's right Thy word is truth all right
[1:39:59] and having on the breastplate of
[1:40:02] righteousness
[1:40:04] that is do what rights
[1:40:09] God the word of God in you doing what's
[1:40:12] right the bless the breastplate of
[1:40:14] righteousness and looking at the
[1:40:15] breastplate
[1:40:16] for the soldier covers
[1:40:18] the chest area
[1:40:21] and that protects the hearts
[1:40:23] because venara comes through
[1:40:26] you know without the breastplate on it
[1:40:28] goes straight into the heart that is
[1:40:30] instant death
[1:40:32] that is a do what's right God's the word
[1:40:35] of God in you doing what is right the
[1:40:38] breastplate of righteousness
[1:40:40] and your feet shut with the preparation
[1:40:43] of the gospel of peace
[1:40:47] and we probably don't appreciate you
[1:40:50] know the importance of wearing shoes
[1:40:53] but back in the day
[1:40:55] when they didn't have all the things
[1:40:58] that we had I think there was actually a
[1:41:00] story about maybe the Second World War I
[1:41:03] kind of or the first World War
[1:41:05] that's a particular set of
[1:41:07] soldiers
[1:41:09] had more Advantage because they had
[1:41:11] shoes on
[1:41:15] and that's why they were able to you
[1:41:17] know win the war
[1:41:18] your future to the preparation of the
[1:41:21] gospel of peace but the Brahm said go
[1:41:22] anywhere any place any time feet shot
[1:41:25] what the gospel see and look above all
[1:41:29] above all of it take the shield of faith
[1:41:35] and if we look at the shield
[1:41:37] out of all this armor that's brother
[1:41:40] Paul explained here you know apart from
[1:41:42] the only offensive one which is the
[1:41:44] sword of the spirit
[1:41:45] The Shield is the only movable Armory
[1:41:50] is the only one that you can you know
[1:41:53] there's an arrow coming you can turn
[1:41:55] this way to the back and use the shields
[1:41:58] to stop it
[1:42:00] and that's why he said above all take
[1:42:01] the shield of Faith that's the one that
[1:42:03] knocks off the dirts
[1:42:06] see the shield of Faith wherewith ye
[1:42:09] shall be able to quench all the fairy
[1:42:11] darts of the weekend
[1:42:14] and he said and take the helmet of
[1:42:16] salvation
[1:42:18] and I like the way that Abraham
[1:42:20] explained this here he said that's the
[1:42:22] soul the mind in here the head
[1:42:25] covers the head because your element is
[1:42:27] used to cover your head right and the
[1:42:30] sword of the spirits which is the word
[1:42:31] of God
[1:42:33] you know steps back a little bit to
[1:42:36] explain the helmet of salvation
[1:42:39] how are you going to get this element
[1:42:41] what it does it's a protection
[1:42:45] what is the Airmen made of brass brass
[1:42:48] can't even be tempered hard harder than
[1:42:51] iron
[1:42:52] a brass headpiece the Salvation now he
[1:42:56] explains it knowledge of knowing this
[1:43:01] so what's the element of Salvation the
[1:43:03] knowledge of knowing this and my healing
[1:43:07] comes from God
[1:43:09] my salvation comes from God
[1:43:13] my experience matches his word not the
[1:43:17] church's idea the word
[1:43:20] amen there you are covered over with a
[1:43:24] protection the ailment of Salvation
[1:43:28] Deliverance the knowledge of knowing
[1:43:32] that I'm a Child of God no matter what
[1:43:34] Satan is telling me no matter what
[1:43:38] my label is
[1:43:40] remember we talked about that the last
[1:43:41] time Satan can label us several things
[1:43:44] you're a compromiser you are this you
[1:43:47] get angry all the time but what's your
[1:43:49] identity
[1:43:51] your identity is who God says you are
[1:43:54] and having that knowledge of that
[1:43:56] identity identity is that element of
[1:43:59] salvation
[1:44:00] don't lose it
[1:44:02] don't let Satan take it away from you
[1:44:05] but if I'm saying now watch now I got
[1:44:08] hurried
[1:44:10] but I got to get in this Inn
[1:44:13] Satan's Army brings diseases
[1:44:17] That's what Satan is he's a destroyer
[1:44:20] Satan the whole Kingdom of Satan is
[1:44:22] sickness death and sorrow and
[1:44:25] frustrations and worry all on Satan
[1:44:28] God is life
[1:44:31] faith joy peace over here see
[1:44:35] now that's the two great forces that is
[1:44:38] coming together right now
[1:44:40] they are battling they are battling
[1:44:42] rights here in the building right now
[1:44:45] the battle day by day with you every
[1:44:49] Force
[1:44:51] so every day we are faced with
[1:44:52] circumstances I'll ask the musicians to
[1:44:54] come now
[1:44:56] we're faced with circumstances we are
[1:44:58] faced with situations where God
[1:45:02] is trying to build this character in US
[1:45:08] sometimes as a co-worker
[1:45:11] sometimes it's our spouses sometimes
[1:45:13] it's our children
[1:45:16] but let's remember
[1:45:19] it said we do not wrestle against flesh
[1:45:21] and blood
[1:45:23] we must be Discerning of the situation
[1:45:26] we must know that this that is coming
[1:45:29] against me is not my brother it's not my
[1:45:32] sister God is trying to test me
[1:45:35] what will Jesus do in this situation
[1:45:39] because we've got to realize
[1:45:43] like what the prayer was saying this
[1:45:44] morning the closest of the world we see
[1:45:46] of Jesus Is Us
[1:45:49] but Abraham said that in the seven
[1:45:50] Church ages the church had broke but the
[1:45:52] brown said that Jesus did not finish his
[1:45:54] work
[1:45:55] when he was here in flesh
[1:45:58] he let the rest for the church
[1:46:03] and that is as true as what it means
[1:46:07] Jesus did not finish his work Jesus did
[1:46:09] the part that he wanted to do by
[1:46:12] predestination but there's a whole lot
[1:46:14] that has been left
[1:46:16] imagine my neighbor will never ever see
[1:46:20] the physical Jesus
[1:46:22] I've even not had a chance to do it but
[1:46:25] how will Jesus represent himself to that
[1:46:27] neighbor he's got to be in me
[1:46:30] my wife might never see Jesus
[1:46:33] in the real sense of the physical Jesus
[1:46:36] she didn't live in Jesus's day but Jesus
[1:46:39] wants to be in me demonstrating himself
[1:46:42] to her Jesus wants to be in her
[1:46:45] demonstrating himself to me and that is
[1:46:48] what Satan attacks that is the battle
[1:46:51] that is the battle between right and
[1:46:54] wrong the right is US reflecting the
[1:46:57] Light of Christ
[1:47:00] you know I I I I actually
[1:47:04] listened to a message that preached
[1:47:05] years ago
[1:47:06] and and a bit of research I did about
[1:47:09] the Son and the Moon
[1:47:12] and we're talking about it you know just
[1:47:14] recently
[1:47:15] and to find out that
[1:47:17] the moon has its orbits and it goes
[1:47:20] around these orbits
[1:47:22] it has no light of his own
[1:47:25] it reflects the light
[1:47:28] from the Sun
[1:47:30] but then
[1:47:32] the amount of lights that the Moon is
[1:47:35] able to reflect reflects the Earth
[1:47:38] is based on the position of the Moon
[1:47:41] compared to the Earth
[1:47:44] and he says that anytime we have a super
[1:47:47] moon
[1:47:48] that moon is an opposition
[1:47:52] that is closer to the Sun and it's able
[1:47:55] to reflect 20 percent more light
[1:47:59] and when I read that I remember that the
[1:48:01] Brahm said that there is going to be a
[1:48:03] super Church
[1:48:05] a super race as we near the headstone
[1:48:10] what does that mean as we are nearing
[1:48:13] the coming of the Lord
[1:48:14] more of the character of Christ must be
[1:48:17] reflected in my life
[1:48:20] I must reflect more of Christ than the
[1:48:24] first church age than the second Church
[1:48:26] Aid and the third then the fourth and
[1:48:28] fifth the sixth
[1:48:30] because I am the one that is closest to
[1:48:34] the headstone
[1:48:36] so it's a huge calling
[1:48:39] but today in this age and in this time
[1:48:42] in this generation we are the ones that
[1:48:45] have been called and brother Brown said
[1:48:46] the evil days are now
[1:48:49] it's tougher for us than it was for the
[1:48:52] Saints of old there's so many things to
[1:48:54] contend with but one thing I'm most
[1:48:57] grateful for is that the weapon that was
[1:49:00] delivered to them is still as potent
[1:49:02] today as it was then
[1:49:05] if Jesus used it against the devil and
[1:49:08] was able to conquer the devil if I use
[1:49:11] the word of God against the devil today
[1:49:14] I will definitely conquer the devil
[1:49:18] so that's the briefing tonight
[1:49:20] the Holy Spirit
[1:49:22] has given us a briefing
[1:49:24] I trust that we have a better
[1:49:26] situational awareness
[1:49:28] remember he said that that devil that
[1:49:31] enemy he can meet you anywhere
[1:49:34] right here on the seats as you go out
[1:49:37] sometimes someone will do something
[1:49:40] and Satan will start to tell you in your
[1:49:41] heart to you do you know that that
[1:49:42] person doesn't love you
[1:49:46] yeah I once had the experience I went
[1:49:48] somewhere to preach and whilst I was
[1:49:50] waiting I don't know if I said the story
[1:49:51] before
[1:49:52] a brother came to me
[1:49:55] um in the in the pastor's office and
[1:49:57] said he had something to tell me
[1:49:59] that some time ago
[1:50:02] we I think everyone was together he
[1:50:05] wanted to greet me and I didn't
[1:50:09] answer him
[1:50:11] and he felt that I had something against
[1:50:14] him and that was many months I mean
[1:50:17] months before was when it happened
[1:50:20] he felt I had heard something about his
[1:50:23] family
[1:50:23] and when that thought dropped into him
[1:50:25] because I wasn't even a minister dead
[1:50:27] something told him that if this brother
[1:50:29] becomes a minister tomorrow
[1:50:31] what will happen
[1:50:32] and months down the line
[1:50:35] there I was visiting the church to
[1:50:37] preach and he came to tell me I said to
[1:50:39] him brother I don't even know your name
[1:50:42] apart from your first name I know
[1:50:44] nothing about your family but Satan
[1:50:46] dropped that in his heart and gave him a
[1:50:49] complex
[1:50:52] so we have this battle happening in our
[1:50:55] lives every day
[1:50:58] brings argument between a husband and
[1:51:00] wife something later happens a
[1:51:03] misunderstanding and Satan starts to
[1:51:05] take you
[1:51:07] bring kind of thoughts
[1:51:09] I mean I'm speaking to myself and that
[1:51:12] is that is the foundation of depression
[1:51:15] [Music]
[1:51:16] those thoughts that Satan will bring the
[1:51:19] things he tells you that are not real
[1:51:22] tells you about the other person tells
[1:51:24] you about your situation tells you about
[1:51:26] the future you realize that faith and
[1:51:29] fear are both about the future
[1:51:33] one is the truth about the future the
[1:51:36] other is a lie about the future
[1:51:39] you never fear what is past
[1:51:42] you always fear what is going to happen
[1:51:45] and that is Satan telling you trying to
[1:51:48] you know another way I like to explain
[1:51:50] it which I heard someone say is just
[1:51:53] take fear as an acronym
[1:51:55] it means false evidence
[1:51:58] appearing real
[1:52:00] it is false it is not true but Satan is
[1:52:05] pushing that to you to tell you this is
[1:52:07] going to happen but what is faith
[1:52:09] the substance of things hoped for the
[1:52:13] evidence of things not sin
[1:52:15] both of them are evidences one is true
[1:52:18] by the word of God the other one is
[1:52:20] false because Satan is the one bringing
[1:52:22] it
[1:52:24] so we've got to encounter these things
[1:52:26] day by day it is the way the Lord
[1:52:29] designed it to be
[1:52:32] the inspiration that came on the brother
[1:52:33] that wrote only believe one of the
[1:52:36] verses said your Shepherds selected the
[1:52:38] path you must trade
[1:52:41] because he knows that he's leading the
[1:52:42] right way to get us to a place where we
[1:52:46] become conformed
[1:52:48] to the image of his son
[1:52:51] with me tonight
[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:52:56] let's all just take a moment to speak to
[1:52:59] the Lord
[1:53:03] is the captain of The Host
[1:53:06] is our commander-in-chief
[1:53:08] [Music]
[1:53:09] is giving us
[1:53:11] [Music]
[1:53:13] a briefing tonight so to say
[1:53:17] spoken to us as
[1:53:21] soldiers of the cross
[1:53:24] enlisted to the army of the Lord
[1:53:26] [Music]
[1:53:27] let's just respond to him
[1:53:32] and say Lord
[1:53:34] I agree
[1:53:36] I agree that the things you have said
[1:53:38] are true
[1:53:40] but I need Grace
[1:53:42] I need your help
[1:53:45] to do just what you've instructed me to
[1:53:47] do
[1:53:52] your grace
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:11] foreign
[1:54:17] Lord Jesus
[1:54:19] for speaking to us tonight
[1:54:24] Lord appears very simple straightforward
[1:54:30] but Lord Jesus
[1:54:32] We Know by your word that you hide
[1:54:35] yourself in simplicity
[1:54:37] and you reveal yourself in the same
[1:54:42] Lord Jesus
[1:54:43] thank you
[1:54:45] may you take this word from letter
[1:54:50] and may you reveal it by your spirit in
[1:54:53] our hearts
[1:54:55] you said the words that I speak unto you
[1:54:57] their spirit and their life
[1:55:01] Lord just help us when we when we get
[1:55:04] into those situations when our enemy law
[1:55:07] just comes against us
[1:55:10] may this just Lord
[1:55:13] be brought back to our memory
[1:55:16] you said to the disciples their Lord
[1:55:18] Jesus it's
[1:55:19] so remarkable there father help those
[1:55:23] men had trusted so much in you
[1:55:27] that
[1:55:28] literally Lord Jesus
[1:55:31] tied their lives around you
[1:55:34] they got asked questions about tasks
[1:55:37] about about tax Lord Jesus it was you
[1:55:40] that told them what to do
[1:55:42] Lord the Pharisees blame them accuse
[1:55:44] them of things nor they run to you Lord
[1:55:47] you speak in Parables they don't
[1:55:49] understand what you've said to the
[1:55:51] multitude
[1:55:53] and Lord Jesus when they get together
[1:55:56] with you alone
[1:55:58] they ask you questions
[1:56:00] and one day you looked at them and said
[1:56:03] you're going to depart
[1:56:05] and Lord I can only imagine how sad that
[1:56:08] they felt their lord Jesus
[1:56:10] but you gave them Lord a promise
[1:56:14] you said I'll send the comforter
[1:56:18] Lord what you literally told them
[1:56:21] is that I'm your comforter today
[1:56:23] but I'm going to send my spirit
[1:56:26] which will be me in spirit form
[1:56:29] to be your comforter so you won't have
[1:56:32] to miss me
[1:56:34] Lord

[1:56:40] you've given us the Holy Spirit
[1:56:43] is as good as you were here there Lord
[1:56:45] Jesus
[1:56:47] and one of the things he said the holy
[1:56:48] spirit will do is that the things you
[1:56:51] have told us including what you have
[1:56:53] told us tonight the holy spirit will
[1:56:56] bring you to our remembrance
[1:56:59] Lord at that time our own guarded
[1:57:01] moments
[1:57:03] when the flesh is about to take over
[1:57:06] and do what the flesh will do
[1:57:09] May the Holy Spirit bring this words to
[1:57:12] our remembrance dear Lord may we do the
[1:57:15] right thing there Lord Jesus according

[1:57:42] presence there Lord Jesus Moses said if

[2:03:25] certainly thankful thank you brother
[2:03:26] Toby for surrendering yourself
[2:03:29] thank you
[2:03:30] I just have to read a scripture
[2:03:33] I have to
[2:03:36] second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3
[2:03:38] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[2:03:41] not war after the flesh
[2:03:44] for the weapons of our Warfare or not
[2:03:46] carnal but they're Mighty through God to
[2:03:50] the pulling down of strongholds
[2:03:52] casting down imaginations and every High
[2:03:55] thing that exalteth itself against the
[2:03:58] knowledge of God and bringing into
[2:04:01] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[2:04:05] of Christ
[2:04:07] understanding that either fear or faith
[2:04:09] is going to take hold in our lives
[2:04:11] brothers and sisters
[2:04:13] and they're both about the future and
