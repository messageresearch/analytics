Christian I was telling Brother Don on Mainstay like the Prairie parade was so remarkable it said that we are living on the day of the Lord and I was saying that it's the great day of the Lord for the believer but it's a dreadful day of the Lord for the unbelievers so it's a good thing to be a Christian let's bow to pray this morning father you truly mean the world to us Lord the reality Lord Jesus is we are not serving you because we want to escape hell we're saving you because of that love that we have for you Lord a prophet said if you were to cast him in hell he will still love you because he knows Lord Jesus Christ that he will make the right decision and if that's where you want him to be that's the place he wants to be Lord father that's the desire Lord Jesus we believe is in every heart Lord Jesus that we are not being dragged to come to church Lord Jesus we are not being persuaded to come to church but it's a love of fear between us and you their lord Jesus Lord whether we be in church whether in our homes in our places of work wherever we are Lord Jesus we are coming to realize more and more that we are representing you that we are Jesus Lord Jesus to the people that will come across us their father and we're here this morning Lord Jesus to check up with our soul salvation to feed Lord Jesus as Souls Lord with a living bread to the word of God father Lord as your servant will come this morning we pray Lord Jesus you take him out of the way there Lord Jesus father the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the hearts you know our needs dear Lord Jesus may you design those needs this morning may you meet each one at the point of our needs dear Lord Jesus father as we continue to worship you we know a lot of song service Lord Jesus is to make our hearts the right bedding ground to receive the word Lord may you continue to be with us song leader brother Paul their lord Jesus and all the musicians their father as they lead us Lord Jesus Christ father into the Shekinah glory Lord Jesus where all things are possible thou Lord our heart to be prepared to receive the word if there be anyone that's troubled here you take the trouble away if there's any pain Lord Jesus Christ father that is bothering every any one Lord Jesus may you take it away there Lord Jesus we just want to know that we came to church today and we met with Jesus we had a wonderful experience with you there Lord Jesus father the offering we're about to give Lord Jesus we realize their father the Lord is out of the substance you've given unto us that we are bringing and there's a promise Lord Jesus Christ that he will rebuke the Devourer for our sake Lord Jesus father this is not an inferior promise in the Bible Lord Jesus is the same Bible that promised us it's the same word of God that said our sickness is on our diseases Lord Jesus you will heal their father and Lord Jesus we are holding on to this word Lord if there be any Devourer Lord Jesus in our finances there Lord may you rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ father may I substance therefore that would give out of Lord Jesus Christ be an acceptable sacrifice unto you be with us

that's really what it's all about I just we've heard it but I heard it again this week how brother Branham just so beautifully he says everything God was he poured unto Christ everything Christ was he part of his church we've heard about the Oneness of God I listened to the sermon Oneness of God this week just all these thoughts and it's just wonderful to just want to hear and have a hunger and a desire to hear and then to receive it and then to live it out wonderful that the Lord has put that in our hearts each one of you I know that you feed and when we feed we become him amen the Oneness of God well he became me so that I might become him by grace oh he became me so that I might become him by grace he took my place so that I by his love could take him oh he became me so that I should

those who are traveling brother Justice Sister Laura and the boys we also want to remember brother Samuel Taylor in Ghana who lost his wife I believe yesterday in Ghana pray for them and the congregation we know that his ways are not our ways and neither are his thoughts our thoughts but we know that he does everything perfect we just want to go to him in prayer now if you have a need maybe just make it known unto him with an uplift hand we know that his ear is always open to our prayers gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus this morning we just want to come together Lord Jesus as one body father many members of one body Lord we pray that we could just be in one mind and one Accord now father Lord as we remember the needs father that were mentioned we pray that you would be with those who are traveling father Lord we pray that you would be with our brother Taylor and congregation and Ghana father Lord many times we don't understand what we trust and father we just ask that you would be his comfort Lord that you would be with the congregation and the family Lord Jesus at the passing of a wife Lord and a mother and a an auntie and father maybe even a grandmother Lord

Lord Brother Justice Sister Laura the Samuel brother Joshua and anyone else who might be traveling father we pray that you would give them traveling mercies and bring them home at the appointed time father we just ask that you would meet each and every need made known unto you this morning with an uplift hand father Lord we know that you've created us to be needy and Lord It's contrary to this world but we thank you Father for the way that you've created us because you haven't created us to be a a a a a body of of Lord all the filth in this world but Lord You've created us to be a temple for your Holy Spirit to live in Lord Jesus as we've just sung Lord and father we just ask that as we go forwards Lord that you would help us to consecrate ourselves unto you once again father we know it's impossible to walk in this world and not become filthy Lord and father if there's anything in our lives now that would just hinder your spirit father we pray that you would forgive us for it Lord we pray that you would Purge us father from any iniquity in our hearts Lord that there would be no clogged up channels Lord but that the speaker and the here could become one today Father we just as our brother has already prayed we've come to hear from you Lord not from a man so father we pray that you would just help the speaker to get out of the way Lord let me step aside and just allow you father to use me and father the same for the hearer Lord oh Lord we pray the hear and the speaker could become one today father that we would just be blessed by your voice Lord that we would hear from you today Lord that you would speak and will be careful to give you all the praise and all the Glory thank you for meeting each need according to your riches and your glory we just ask all these things now father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you musicians thank you this morning just would like to welcome everyone to the house of the Lord I would like to take a moment to welcome Brother David and sister Christy from Nigeria I haven't seen you yet um I haven't made your acquaintance are they're here all right God bless you brother I looked right at you and I didn't recognize you and you know that's such an interesting Paradox because sometimes that can be the exact same thing with a Christian not recognizing Christ God bless you brother I pray that you feel right at home here I look forward to getting to know you um I just would like to actually mention also that uh we had a maybe while I talk just turn with me in your Bibles before I get to too inspired and keep you standing too long let's just read a scripture did Brother uh sorry John chapter 15. John chapter 15. your brother Mervin and sister Faye make it today yesterday but they didn't come today they're streaming today yes I understand fully I did the same thing last week God bless you brother Mervyn sister Faye and everyone else who might be tuning in virtually we certainly are blessed people to be able to gather together this way boy oh boy oh boy I apologize I feel a little bit nervous this morning St John chapter 15. verses 12 to 16 I'd like to read today this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye ask of the father in my name he may give it to you God bless you this morning let's just bow one more time uh gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness to us we thank you for your loving kindness Lord father we pray that Lord the words that are spoken this morning Father your word your Eternal Word father that it would just find its Mark in the hearts of your children father Lord we pray that you would just be glorified in all that's said and done as we go forwards this morning in this service that when we leave here today father that we could say truly that our hearts burned within us because we know that you spoke with us along the way father we just ask that you would bless the reading of your word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated certainly uh an honor and a privilege to be back here in the house of the Lord with all of you it's a tremendous blessing to be able to travel but it's even more of a blessing to come home God bless you Sister Jermaine it's so good to see you happy New Years I just would like to uh I know I mentioned it on on Wednesday I certainly would like to thank all the brethren just for taking the time to step in and fill in for me while we were away I really appreciate that um certainly means something to know that we're together that we're not divided would just like to take a moment this morning also and have a special appreciation for Sister Janet o'donnello as brother Toby's mother she's with us today God bless you Sister amen I didn't get to shake your hand in the back but I certainly look forward to doing it at the end of service I trust you feel right at home as well sister God bless you um I hope you can stay for quite a while as well you know the services that happened while we were away uh here were just tremendous and the services that we had over in Philippines were tremendous also I had a real battle going on I had to fight through a a head cold and a chest cold it was quite a deal but uh you know the Lord knows everything and it's such a a paradox when you know that you just want to curl up in a ball but there's a whole group of people just waiting to hear from you and uh so we just went forward by faith and and trusted the Lord and I believe it it worked well I think he blessed the services really well even when it felt like I failed terribly uh people were still commenting and were thankful for it so I certainly trust the Lord did something for the people there I know we are changed from what we witnessed the lives of the Believers that we met in Philippines it's such a tremendous thing to go and meet the people of Believers that attend in a congregation and you know Lord willing I would like to do it systematically go through the assembly and just go and meet the people in the other countries I don't know if that would be possible but one day we will all meet on the other side we know that and we will be together and we'll have all the time in the world to just share the stories of where we came from and the trials and tribulations that he delivered us from you know the story that brother Gilbert took in his service on the Wednesday that I and my father are one it's such a tremendous thought and I believe we could just take a an entire year and talk on that topic and you know Lord willing that's really what I want to do is talk about that and and that's really all I want to talk about to be honest with you but there's so much that we need to talk about we can't just stop in one spot but you know it's really the most important thing for us in our day because when the bride recognizes what she is when the church recognizes its position then the Rapture will go and you know we we've talked about our positions as husbands and wives and and children and and how it's been set out in Ephesians and brother Branham talks about how Ephesians perfectly parallels Joshua doesn't sort of parallel it but perfectly parallels Joshua how they were go going through delivered from the house of bondage and how they had to cross over Jordan die out to themselves change all of their ways and just accept the promise that God had for them same thing with the believer today we've got to recognize that we have been for ordained predestinated from before the foundation of the world to be called the Sons and Daughters of God we could get right into that but I don't want to spend too much time on that today I have another thought that the lord gave us but you know when Jesus was here on Earth and he sat down and said I and my father are one that's when they picked up the stones and that's when they wanted to kill him that's when they wanted to do away with this guy they loved his first pull and his second pull of his ministry when he could discern the hearts of people when he could heal people all the good things that were happening it was tremendous wasn't it oh but when he started to say you know what the word and I are one I and the father are one look out brother Branham says that that's when the shuck will start to pull away from the wheat when the bride starts to declare that when the wheat starts to declare that when the elected lady starts to declare that I and my father are one the Shuck's gonna freak out and say whoa you're getting crazy now you're getting a little bit fundamental but you know brothers and sisters that's what the Bride of Jesus Christ is she's a fanatic brother Branham says someone who is totally sold out to the word they're an oddball they're odd to the world around them aren't they that's what we'll be that's interesting because if you look at the world and all of the different people that have claimed Christianity and some of them very fundamental and and really even prophetic there's been some pretty crazy things that have happened under the guise of a prophet and and when you mention the word Prophet to people they get wigged out right away oh no you you know you're getting a little bit too far it's getting a little bit crazy now you're getting fundamental talking about a prophet but you know what there are true prophets and there are false prophets the false prophets are many the true prophets are few very few but the true Prophet will always align with the word of God the identification of a true Prophet will be that they point to Jesus Christ and a false prophet will point to some new doctrine some new theology that they've got to mix with the word of God some sort of hybridization that they want to bring in but you know I think it's just powerful it's just incredible that I and my father are one and I think the more that we actually go forwards and sing that song you know I was born to be a Dwelling Place for what for the father why so that we could die out so that we could decrease so that he could increase he has to live out through us but boy once he starts to do that brothers and sisters look out the the Devourer will be rebuked and you know it won't be just at his word it'll be at your word because you recognize when you speak he speaks I and my father are one just beautiful just love the thought that brother Emmanuel took I'm I just have to go over this because it's so powerful man don't look at the Giants the Giants weren't named in creation the Giants weren't named in God's word God said cross over Jordan die out to yourself go into the promised land take all that's yours the land of milk and honey is there just go do it but he didn't say Beware of the Giants because they weren't a part of his creation they were a perversion of his word but you know in our day brothers and sisters when we get into the book of Ephesians and we cross over we die out to ourselves what happens is we see Giants oh no there's Giants now what those Giants are a bluff the prophet of of our day he said those Giants are scarecrows and the scarecrows are only put up where the good things are they're only put up to scare the birds away but the birds know that they can actually get into something really good when they see a scarecrow so if a giant pops up in our lives brothers and sisters Rejoice Rejoice because you're rejoicing will destroy that giant you're complaining and you're crying won't destroy that giant you're complaining and crying will create a bigger giant in your life and maybe invite another giant to come around but boy when we can just rejoice and thank the Lord for what he's done in our lives that he has given us ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church in the final days my goodness those scarecrows don't become problems anymore remember that brother Branham told that Vision about how the devil would come around and go boo right and every time that would happen he would get smaller and that devil would get bigger and every time he would do that he would get smaller and the devil would get bigger but then something spoke to him and said you know what say boo back and you know this can be taken and made into some weird Doctrine and I'm not interested in doing that what I am interested in doing is trying to encourage us to recognize when we hear that boo it's just a giant it's just a scarecrow say boo back devil we know that David he went and he withstood the Giant and the giant said oh my I'm going to feed you to the birds you little dog you think you're going to get away with this what a joke they would send out a little boy to try and kill me I'm a Warrior from my youth and you're just a youth and what did he say David said yeah you come to me where staves and Spears and you've got a sword but you know what it doesn't matter because I come to you in the name of the Living God I'm gonna cut your head off today and you know what it's not going to be us that does anything brothers and sisters it's us recognizing that we can do nothing but all things are possible to those who serve Christ we know that we can't do anything on our own and I'm not interested in trying to say that we can pump it up and make it some sort of Pentecostal religion that's not what it's about it's about recognizing our position in Christ and Christ's position in us when we come to that realization then the Rapture is going to go I'm not interested in trying to slay Giants down here who cares about the Giants down here we've got a promise up there or the Toby talking about showing our talents we've been given talents and and we can take them and and use them for God's glory or we can actually just go and hide them and you know there's many different talents in many different ways that we can actually show appreciation to the Lord for the talents which he's given us many different ways I don't want to try and pull on us one way or another but you know brothers and sisters if God's given us a talent we can use it spiritually speaking in the house of the Lord we can excuse me use it spiritually speaking for the body of Christ we can also use the god-given talents naturally in our lives sometimes he's given us a creative ability some people can draw pictures like we can imagine them some people have been given a tremendous Talent some people can coordinate things some people can build things we all have been given talents and you know what we have the ability to use them or hide them and I believe this the more that we use them the more that God will bless them because we know that this this this scripture that we read this morning John chapter 15 what does he say the very first verse we talked about this in Philippines I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away but every batch that rareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit so brothers and sisters if we've got something in our lives that we can do for the Lord that God has given us he's placed it in our lives if we have a gift God's given it to us it's not something we just found along the road somewhere along the way and said hey I just got this God gave it to us before the foundation of the world for a purpose the more that we use that gift for God the more that he'll bless it the more that we thank the Lord for the gifts that he's given us in our lives the more he will bless it so I think it's just wonderful we can show our appreciation for those talents by using them for the glory of God blessing the body blessing a brother or sister who however blessing our neighbors we were having a discussion I was on a discussion yesterday it was just so wonderful you know it's easy to say God bless you to a Believer to a brother and a sister in Christ Jesus that believe that God sent a prophet for the message of the hour uh but can we say God bless you the same way that we would say it to someone that believes in the trinity oh my someone that's a trinitarian could we go and shake their hands and say God bless you I sure love and appreciate you because I know you're a good person and I know it's not up to me to say that one person gets in or one person goes out one person is wise virgin and another person is foolish virgin that's not up to me to do it's up to God to do but it goes even further could you imagine being in a position where you have the opportunity to sacrifice your position in Christ for somebody else's life could we do that this is just a thought I'm not trying to bring a Doctrine or anything but you know what this totally dovetails with the scripture because we know that that Jesus said hey you know what there's no greater thing that a man could do than to lay down his life for his friends and that's just before the scripture that we read today could we lay down our life for our friends or we have too much to live for what is the talent that we've been given we have an ability in our lives we should use it for the glory of God you know I heard this said one time and you know just forgive me because it's not message I'm not saying that it is but I heard it said the most valuable real estate in the world is a cemetery and the reason for that is because so many people had been given god-given talents but they never used them for whatever reason and they take those talents right to the Grave think about all the different blessings that people could have given to mankind they could have given to their families they could have given to their brothers their sisters their churches whatever it is but they just didn't do it why don't people do things why don't people act on things the imagination that happens is because of fear it's because they're afraid it's because there's a scarecrow maybe when they were young they stood up and they had an inspiration and they said something and their children other children in the classroom made fun of them and it shocked them into never wanting to put themselves out there ever again to make make known an idea or a suggestion that was given to them maybe a parent humiliated them maybe a pastor humiliated them maybe someone somewhere along the way did something to shock that person but brothers and sisters I want to say this if you've got an inspiration and it's not contrary to God's word it's a gift that God's given you don't be bashful about it see what God will do with it all the talents that God has given us they're for a purpose but you know the Giants we've heard it said the Giants they're going to boast brother Peter would you mind grabbing my bottle of water from the back apologize I'm still kind of getting over uh this thing the Giants are going to boast in our land brothers and sisters we're all going to contend with Giants and they're going to say you are not one with your father that's going to be one of the primary things they're going to say when you start to say you know what I believe I I read this scripture and it gets me so excited I hear the message and I start to get so excited thank you so much brother it does something to me when I hear it I start to get inspired to say yeah man I I actually start to feel like I and my father are one Satan's going to come around and say nope you're getting crazy now nobody's going to want to hear that business don't even talk like that people are going to say you're crazy but you know what that's exactly where we need to come to brothers and sisters the devil is going to say you are not one the devil is going to say no you need to be afraid you need to be afraid when we hear Brother Bradham talk about being able to speak the word why cry speak when we think wow I can get inspired by that and think you know maybe I should speak the word when something happens in my life maybe I can see a problem and I can speak the word why do I need to cry I don't need to phone anybody I should just speak the word but the devil's gonna say no no no you're going to embarrass yourself your family's gonna hear you say it and nothing's going to happen and they're all going to think you're crazy because you're trying to speak the word you're trying to Trump something up maybe you're trying to get a little bit Pentecostal brothers and sisters you know what brother Branham said he said penny cost is an experience it's not a denomination and you know what if we've got an experience that's anything different than Pentecostal brothers and sisters I say check that experience maybe check it at the door because when we get inspired by the word of God something happens inside of us we have a reaction to the word of God there's something that we can't contain but you know brother Branham even said this too he said religion without emotion is what it's dead it's dead so take that religion and just bury it is what he says we don't need to hang on to a religion that's dead why would we want to be emotionless why would we want to say maybe my culture has been this way so I need to have a fear of getting too excited what's it going to be like when we get over there and all of Heaven is going to be quiet for those who are redeemed those redeemed ones are going to shout they're going to jump they might dance before the Lord [Music] you know as this Revelation breaks in our lives brothers and sisters we don't have to wait till then we don't have to wait till then the prophet said focus on the scarecrows because they're a lie they're a lie now that's me paraphrasing what the prophet said but I want to say it that way just just focus on what the scarecrows are trying to do in our lives brothers and sisters they're a lie go into where the scarecrows are go look at those scarecrows brother Branham says it you know when he's preaching you know when I eat cherry pie I want to eat the pie it's my favorite pie but if I get a pit I don't throw the whole pie out and and if I'm eating chicken I I don't throw the chicken out if I get a little gristle or a bone he says go on and just throw out those little things that you don't like but don't throw it all out take the good stuff and eat it enjoy it it's free but he said before you throw it out take it and examine it and just make sure that it's a bone [Laughter] don't just throw it out because it just maybe is a little bit hard because it might be something that we need you know brothers and sisters if we want it there's always something there for us my the brother brought me a drink and I didn't even have any you know thinking about 2023 and uh the importance of living as a human being we need to set ourselves goals we need to set ourselves achievements we need to work in our lives we need to go to school we need to strive you know what it says in the word of God that if we don't work then we shouldn't eat how could we want to eat food if we're not willing to get out of bed and go and work and that's me heavily paraphrasing it but you know we need to go forwards and we need to do things in our lives and you know if if we're not happy with the way things are in our lives then we can make a change to see something different in our lives and if we're willing to make a change in our lives then probably we're going to see a change in our lives if we're not willing to make a change or do anything different then we're only going to get what we've always got we're just going to have the same thing tomorrow and the same thing next day and I'm a witness of that I've lived my life like that at times but if we want to make a change brothers and sisters make a change let's make a change and you know one of the biggest things that I learned in business and and I'm not saying that you should apply it now in in the message of the hour what I'm saying is in our natural lives I I really highly encourage it if you want to make a change don't try and make a big change don't don't do anything too crazy all at once maybe God calls you to do something but you know many times we hear it people brother Branham talks about this just for the record he does in the message people set goals for the new year and then they find out the second or third day and they haven't met one of the goals they haven't done anything that they want to do because people set things that they can attain to but if you go and you start changing a whole bunch of things in your business all at once you can't tell what's actually making the difference there's nothing measurable the metrics are impossible to tell because you've pushed or pulled too many buttons or levers just do one little thing at a time and see if it doesn't help if it helps then then do it a little more and if it doesn't help then stop doing it and try something different but you know we can apply that principle to our spiritual lives brothers and sisters if we want more of God there's more of God to be had maybe we can come to church more maybe we could listen to the message more maybe we could come to prayer meetings more maybe we could just go on our knees and pray more maybe we could just read our Bible more maybe we can look at the Bible app maybe we can look at the message there's so many different things that we can do if we want to see a change spiritually we have the opportunity to do that just make a change you know if we keep doing what we've always done we're only going to get what we've always got but if we just create a new habit we talked about this I don't know if did we talk about this from Pulpit you know what a habit can be formed or broken in 21 days it's proven humanly speaking and I'm sorry some might say this is getting psychological but you know we live in a natural body and there's things that we need to learn about these bodies and if we want to start something new in our lives do it for 21 days and see if it doesn't stick and if we want to stop doing something in our lives stop doing it for 21 days and see if it doesn't get easier to stop but you know there's things in our lives that we can't control and if we can't stop something in our lives just take it to the Lord and see if he won't help you because I honestly believe this because I've experienced it I've tried many times on my own to stop things that I could just never control never deal with it on my own but boy oh boy just get sincere once with the Lord about that one thing that you can't control and see if he won't actually intercede see if he won't come on the scene and change it he will change it entirely so many different things that we could talk about and I really don't want to want to do that anymore but I just think this this this brother Gilbert has talked about this in the past and and I think it's such an important thing if we're going to set goals and and try and do something positive in our lives maybe it could be our family for our family maybe it could be just for ourselves personally maybe it could be for our church who knows God will lead us and guide us if we ask him but brother Branham talks about complexes and and out of questions and answers he says when a person realizes he has an inferior complex or some sort of a complex how may he overcome this and I want to say this I I think that we could take it and say maybe not an inferior complex maybe something that we just can't overcome maybe it's something that we want to do but have never been able to do it brother Branham goes on to say so should it be if he was the only child caused this in his early youth sometimes we get things that happen in our lives when we're an only child we don't learn how to interact with those people around us I just think this is really important brother Branham says take exactly the opposite if you want to change it just take the opposite and I love the way he words this it's it's kind of maybe even a little sharp but he says if you're always wanting your way and that one little brat that always wants to always have everything your way how many people could say that they could actually fit that maybe take the brat part out of there but how many people here have always wanted everything to be your way I could raise my hand and say there's times in my life where I say I want everything to be my way brother Branham he says turn right back around and give everything you got the other way if we've got this thing in our lives that we want to see changed do the opposite just do the opposite don't hang on to our will and say no I need everything to be my way because if you do that is that Christ's life that's not Christ's life Christ laid down his life for everyone else he says if you're selfish and you want to hold everything then start giving away what you got see whatever just go vice versa that's the way to overcome anything he's an antidote that's out of questions and answers in 1964. moving forward brothers and sisters 2023 if we want to see a change do the opposite just change something just do it a little bit don't don't try and do anything too dramatic all at one time because it can get a little crazy but if you just try a little tiny change it can go a long ways maybe just pray through I asked the Lord a while ago what does it mean to pray through what does it mean to pray through and I'm sure everyone here should be able to raise their hands and say Amen brother I know what it means to pray through but if you don't I want to tell you what it means it means to just get into that place where no worldly influence is with you now you come into the presence of God and there's no more worldly thoughts you're not thinking about your phone you're not thinking about your job you're not thinking about your family you're not thinking about your hunger you're not thinking about your church you're not thinking about anything else but what God is actually leading you to pray about because when you come to that place where you're no longer praying and he's praying you've prayed through then you've prayed through until you get to that place brothers and sisters it's still carnality we're just on our knees and we're just having a conversation with ourselves but you know what if you're knocking on the door if you're knocking on the door to Heaven keep knocking on the door to Heaven keep knocking because he'll answer and boy when he answers you'll know that he's answered when he answers he answers in such a way that you know he begins to speak things that you don't even realize you can't even understand it because it's groanings that come from the spirit talking about our scripture today Saint John chapter 15. verse 11 these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full remember the word of God says the joy of the Lord is your strength where does our strength come from it comes from the Lord John chapter 15 the beginning of it I won't get into it today but he he talks about the vine and the branches when we were in Philippines there was so much green foliage everywhere I just it really struck me really spoke to me the vine and the branches and that life that we we talk about brother Brana mentions the citrus tree and how you can graft branches in and years ago I showed the picture of the tree who was a citrus tree I think it was a lemon tree but it had I think I want to say 40 different types of blossoms in it you could look it up on Google but grafted in branches and it was In Bloom in in the springtime and it had so many different colors it looked like fireworks all in one all of those branches from different trees living off of the same Vine living off of the same life and though none of those branches could go forth and bring fruit from the same tree they would only bear the fruit that was in them from before they were grafted in from the tree the original tree they were in but this this scripture here John chapter 15 he's talking about being the True Vine the one uh with the life the real true life in him and verse 11 says these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that ye love one another is I have loved you how will the world know that you love me different scripture I'm not reading this out of here that you have love one for another not that you say God sent a prophet not that I go to a message church not that I've served God for 75 years of my life or I've served God for five years of my life nothing that I could ever do on my own it's just simply one thing that you have love one for another greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends remember brother Branham said very clearly eternal life is living for others that's right it's putting others first and saying no no it's not about me it's about my brother no it's not about me it's about my sister I want to see them succeed verse 14 ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you and this is where I'm going to get to today but how does he command us we know that he spoke to his disciples there but there was a time where he actually chose to speak through a prophet and that never changed did it some people will say Well when Jesus came it did change but many times we'll look past some of the scriptures that actually say no that's not the case verse 15 says henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth the servant just serves but I've called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you that's kind of what I want to get into today brothers and sisters is understanding that he has made known these things unto us but how has he done it it's it's too simple it's through a Vindicated Prophet but many times people don't want to get there they they get uneasy when we're talking about a prophet and I know we're preaching to the choir everybody here believes that God sent a prophet but we don't need to stop there I guess is my point we don't want to stop there that God sent a prophet we want to understand that the god that sent the prophet is now the god that's here with us and not just here with us but living out in us he's here with us speaking to us making known all that the father hath given him because verse 16 says that ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go forth and bring forth fruit I think it's just perfect with what mother Toby said he said that he would rebuke the Devourer for our sakes when we give our tithe and our offering it's not about a return on investment in time in terms of money if that's what we're doing it for we're doing it for the wrong reason it's just exactly the same thing as saying you know what I'm going to serve God because I'm afraid to go to hell it's not the right principle but if we get our heart right and say you know what I serve him because I love him because he first loved me he called me before the foundation of the world and gave me ears to hear what the spirit said if we can get to that place then we're serving God for the right purpose if we can get to the place to recognize that you know what there's a principle in the Bible that says he'll rebuke the Devourer for our sakes it'll be a financial blessing but it'll also be a spiritual blessing and it'll also be a physical blessing he will give us the ability to see our family healed he will give us the ability to see our children saved he'll give us the ability to see the spiritual growth in in our lives ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go forth and bring forth fruit not that you should perish and be afraid and be scared of the Giants no you should be able to stand there and say you know what if there's a giant that comes around you know if I have to I'll cut your head off Giant and I won't do it with a sword or a spear I won't do it with a bow or an arrow I'll do it with the word of God because I recognize that I have not been given the spirit of bondage again to fear but I have been given the spirit of power and a spirit of love and a spirit of a sound mind I don't have to be upset when the Giants start coming around amen verse 14 and 15 he says ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you amen but how does he command us through a prophet he gives us a Vindicated Prophet that's how he commands us are we willing to follow all that the prophet said or is there some part some portion of the Prophet what he said that we're just willing to leave out because if we do that brothers and sisters we're not taking all of his word remember there's billions of people out there that claim Jesus Christ and they claim Jesus blood but when you talk about Jesus words you have indicated Prophet you're getting a little bit crazy you're getting a little bit too far but I want to say this what really happened in the Garden of Eden everybody knows here everybody knows but I know there's some people that will watch this later on some people might be watching it right now that would say you know I can listen to all this profit stuff but I can't get past that but what really happened in the Garden of Eden it wasn't just a piece of fruit that Eve went out and ate we know that she contravened the word of God and all of the Christians all around the world would say that that's what caused the fall of mankind but why why was there two kids from one act we'll just leave it there Saint John 15 14. ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you amen verse 15 henceforth I call you not servants this is where I really want to get to today brothers and sisters we talked a little bit about it on Wednesday but I believe there's so much here all that Christ God was he poured into Christ oh that Christ was he poured into his church but we know that once upon a time the church was the called out people from bondage out of Israel but now we're talking about the church going a little bit further henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father have I made known unto you I just want to say this brothers and sisters it's just such a beautiful thought I'm going to say it a few times have you ever heard this when you press play based on the scripture that we've just listened to I no longer call you servants but I call you friends you ever hear this when you press play good evening friends who's talking there that's exactly in line with the scripture from the word go when that man stepped him to the pulpit some people might say oh no you have to hear this and that and the other it's got to be thus saith the Lord or it's not the man you know we can just take it and make it something that it isn't but I just think it's so fantastic that's exactly the way God is hiding himself in simplicity but revealing himself in the same go and listen this afternoon brothers and sisters a henceforth call you not servants but I call you friends good evening friends the prophet in our day you know Exodus 23 we talked about this maybe let's just turn over there quickly Exodus chapter 23. I'm gonna have to really get going here I apologize Exodus 23 verse 20 to 22 behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared we're talking about an angel in our day brothers and sisters we're looking back here we're talking about an angel in our day taking us to a place that he has prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries how did he speak he spoke to the prophet we know he's the same yesterday today and forever so then Hebrews or sorry then Exodus 20 verse 18 and all the people saw the thunderings and the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountains smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak lest we die don't let God talk to us they called for a prophet so God said hey I'll give you a prophet so if we believe Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever then how is he going to speak to us whose voice is it that we're going to hear say good evening friends it's going to be God himself God chose to speak to the people through a prophet or a messenger or an angel all of them are the same I just love this verse 16 of of John chapter 15. ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and I've ordained you I have taken you from before the foundation of the world so that you could come and stand in Satan's Eden and not be defiled by this world there's only one thing that will move you and that is going to be the word of God that's going to be my word on the lips of a Vindicated Prophet that's going to stir your heart to the place where you might say I just don't understand it all but I believe it yesterday we had a baptism at the church here Sister Mary Jeanette has witnessed to a man his name is Eric McKay and uh he's 58 years old and he believes that he needed to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we had a great discussion and we talked about it I went and I picked him up he's at the Sunrise Center so he has a limited window of opportunity to go and do things and so I picked him up yesterday we came to the church after the musicians practice and uh and we baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but the the discussion that we had was so wonderful because he he truly believes the word of God that he is the same yesterday today and forever and that he doesn't change his ways it was such a wonderful conversation to to hear someone talk about it this is a man that's had a hard hard life he told me that he went into the residential school as a child as as I think six or seven years old into the residential system in Canada he experienced that and then he went into the the 60s thing whatever that was and just not a good story but somehow someway he wants to serve God there's something in him that says hey if God sent a prophet I want to know about it I want to hear about it tell me more ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of my father in my name he may give it to you you know we can look at this this the scripture and think you know many times it sounds good but how do we apply that in our lives how does that work because there's times where I ask and and I don't receive the Lord doesn't give it to me but you know the only way we're going to see a result like that like like we want to see come to pass in our lives is to ask according to his word it's got to be according to his word there's only one thing that he's interested in brothers and sisters he wants to see us Prosper he wants to see us in good health he wants to see us happy there's things that really he does want for us but more than anything there's one Paramount thing and that's our soul he wants our soul and he will not lose one but more than anything we need to be asking for things of Eternal value if we're asking for temporal blessings we might not get it or we might get it but it could be actually not a blessing in the long run it could turn into a curse for us we have to be very careful the way we ask just like we need to be very careful the way we speak if we're dealing with the third poll and we can not cry but speak the word of God be careful what we speak about one another it can be a terrible thing but you know the story just remains for me I can't get away from it you know when we talk about asking for Eternal things asking for things of Eternal value that's what God's going to give us remember the prophet of God told sister Hattie right you want a million bucks how much money was a million dollars back in in this when was that how much money was that then that was a lot of dough wasn't it you want it just say the word God will give it to you but she didn't want it what about your sister we've prayed for her and prayed for her this is the prophet of God saying we've prayed for her and prayed for her and she's still not healed she's still crippled in the wheelchair say the word she'll be healed right now what does she want there was something inside of her that recognized this was the only opportunity this was the time to ask for something of Eternal value and that Eternal value was for The Souls of her sons and what happened they were in the midst of mocking him and her mocking the situation but God took it and used it for his glory I call you friends his powerful brothers and sisters because I I believe it's a change in the dispensation and a change in the age a change in the way things are being perceived and we're not getting away from the message of the hour don't get me wrong I'm not I'm not at all trying to do that what I'm trying to do is just draw our attention to something Jesus said I call you friends in John 15 15. why why did he do that because all things that that he he has heard of his father he made known unto his friends the servants they don't get the information they don't they don't understand the conversation the personal conversation behind closed doors the servants just do what the servants do but the friends are the ones that are invited into the inner chamber they get to sit down and have Fellowship they get to break bread and talk about things and we know that he he said this very clearly um Jesus said to his disciples I have made all things known unto you what the father has given to me I talked about this on Wednesday and I felt like I just needed to go back and and just really dwell on this a little bit and we'll just see what the Lord will do with it but you know in the first seal brother radham says this now watch he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand at church it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider and we know many times over the years over the centuries people have poked and prodded at this to try and figure out what it is and there's many different examples of it and I'm not going to get into it today brother Branham says it's a white horse rider and it's only is to be revealed that the last day when the actual seal is broken he says broken to who not to Christ but to the church it's broken to the church but here we have this one that said good evening friends speaking these words here in the first seal the one that was picked up by the seven angels the one that actually was there or not depending on how you want to argue it in Sunset mountain when that cloud picture was taken that one getting back to the cloud discussion why was that cloud there Cloud was there to show him to go back to Jeffersonville to be in his position so that that Covenant Angel could come and open the seals through him he says it's only to be revealed at that last day when this actual seal is broken broke into who not to Christ but to the church he says notice now oh my that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands it see what I mean you people he says I'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand it isn't that interesting because it just dovetails with John St John 15 15. I no longer call you servants but I call you friends so that you'll understand it I'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand it he's now inviting the church to another level this is taking it to a whole new level brothers and sisters this isn't just being church members and saying that you know this is great we've got a fantastic Fellowship this is going Beyond and recognizing the opening of the seals isn't just the opening of the seals and we can say that we can understand line by line and read you know what it takes prophetic insight to recognize what the seals opening means and I'm not trying to say we've got this great mystery and it makes us some sort of elitism you know what if this seals truly become broken to you if you understand the mystery behind the seals then you become humble it doesn't puff us up Revelation does not puff a Christian person up Revelation humbles us Revelation makes us recognize out of 8 billion people God chose me to be able to understand this so when we see someone puffed up and they say oh yeah I know all about that and I know this and that and you know what's going on of course you don't want to make someone feel bad but we've got to be able to discern the spirits that's what the word of God says discern the spirits but he says I'm going to call you bride see so that you'll understand it now I just think it's important it's vital for us brothers and sisters to recognize who is saying those words was it a prophet was it a man on Earth saying those words or was it that Covenant Angel speaking through that man because if it was that Covenant Angel speaking to that man there was a tremendous change in dispensation happening right there in the first seal before he even starts right at the beginning of the seals he says that I'm not going to call you church I'm not going to call you servants I'm going to call you friends and you know what I'm not going to call your friends I'm going to call you bride I'm going to call you that one that I actually spoke about in Ephesians you know I don't speak concerning a man and a wife I speak about the mystery concerning God and the church Christ and the church how they could just become what to no one how they could become one and so brothers and sisters I just want to really try and drill down on this today and talk a little bit about how brother Branham actually mentioned this so I've got some quotes I've got some quotes I just think it's so significant I want to dwell on it you know to some people this is where it becomes critical the Scarecrow pops up the seals you hear that word scarecrows pop up for some people they're not sure some people they might say well you know what all the seals are open praise God there's no scarecrow there for other people scarecrow pops up and they'll say well you know what brother some of the seals aren't open they're not all open yet it's a scarecrow and you know others will say you know what they're all open except for one it's a scarecrow because if you listen to the message of the hour he he refers to it very clearly them seals are open all them seals are open when all the seals were open he says it many different ways some folks will say it's laodicea but you know what brothers and sisters others will say it's a bright age this is not the layout of cnh for some people it might be we can look at all the church ages but you know we'll get there eventually but this is not the laodicean church age it is the bride age because we know that it was a Vindicated Prophet what made it a Vindicated profit it was the Covenant Angel speaking through the prophet who is the Covenant Angel brothers and sisters but Christ Jesus himself it's not some other Angel we spoke about it on Sunday it's not an archangel from Heaven it's not someone with a really great personality from Heaven it's Jesus Christ himself all things I have heard of my father I have made known unto you so as we go forwards I just think it's beautiful we're going to read some quotes now I got 15 maybe half an hour if we're pushing it as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will have to be a sheath waived again in the last days oh my he says waving of the Sheaf what was the Sheaf the first one to come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a Sheaf we know we read that scripture unless the corn of wheat falls in the ground it abides alone but when it does come forth it brings forth much fruit doesn't it one corn and we know that each head contains multiple corns but if it just stays in a container somewhere it's never going to bring forth fruit that's why it's the life of a Believer we've got to die out to ourselves brother Marvin brought that that visual uh depiction of it how that life cycle happens it's got to be a rotten seed is the end of it brothers and sisters if we've got a seed in us it's got a rot we gotta die out to ourselves in order for him to live but we know out of Leviticus 20 that's what he was referring to here speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when ye come into the land which I give you and shall reap the Harvest thereof then ye shall bring a Sheaf of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest we know that's the Old Testament we know it's applicable today we're supposed to bring of a Sheaf of the first fruits of our Harvest whatever God gives us we're supposed to bring that to him and show him that and thank him for it and wave it before him not just go and do everything else and then say well if I've got something left over then I'll bring it to the Lord then we're bringing a sacrifice that stinks in his nose he's the same yesterday today and forever all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church and he shall wave the Sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it and he shall offer that day when ye wave the Sheaf and he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord we know that there was a he lamb that was waived before the congregation we know that happened and that was for a purpose that was so that we could live speaking of Christ on Calvary another quote brother Bradham says he says hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waived over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that will that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waived over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there all of that is probably a very familiar quote out of it is the rising of the Sun I personally believe it's so important to recognize there was a change in dispensation something has happened in in our day brothers and sisters and I just gonna interweave this in here that you know what brother Branham says it in the church age book that uh she has the mind of Christ to know what to do with the word right yeah that that quote is not just something that we want to brush over and I I say it but I I I want to understand it myself and I know the more that we say it the more it will become clear to us she has thus saith the Lord the Bride of Jesus Christ has thus saith the Lord we know this Vindicated Prophet that we're talking about he was told one time to go and pick up your pen and write this down because I don't want you to forget this I want you to tell the church this no I want you to tell the bride this I want her to understand this that all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he didn't just pour it into the church he poured it into his bride in the last day and you know what brothers and sisters when the scarecrows pop up in our lives we have the ability to recognize that according to what the prophet of God says we are now in the bride age we're not living under laodicea we're not living under all the different dispensations we are truly living in the representation of Jesus Christ himself because if we have accepted his Spirit within us then who are we we can't be ourselves and him can we many times this flesh wants us to be but he's not going to share his glory with nobody not with nobody another quote brother Adam says brother let's get all things ready for one of these days the fire is going to fall I I know this is out of invisible Union have the actual heading at the bottom now I started taking the quotes out of the table so that's why I'm not saying the the origin of the quote to start with he says brother let's get all things ready for one of these days the fire is going to fall we're going up now let's get ready for the fire falling time we're in the last days you'll know that and we're ready for the coming of the Lord the thing to do is separate yourself from all sin separate yourself from anything that pertains to the world don't love the world or the things of the world let no man buy his Creed deceive you you stay right straight in the promise of God the word of God and that word if it's a word for this day God vindicates it so if he doesn't it's not the word for this day so brothers and sisters I want to say how many words have we heard in our day that God has Vindicated I personally want to say there's one and any time we see success in our lives spiritually speaking brothers and sisters the only way we're going to see it is to fall under that one word there's only one word and that word is the Vindicated Prophet for that day and you know what happens when we take that word into our lives and it becomes in our heart it becomes our own personal possession then it goes from being a word that's on print pages to being a Living Word it's not just an association to go to a church that's called Living Word it's actually the word living out he says no let no man deceive You by let no man by his Creed deceive you you stay right straight in the promise of God that word of God and that word if it's a word for this day God vindicates it so if he doesn't it's not the word for this day the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work for this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home of the Bride we got something different I just love that we got something different the Pentecostals represented that again we're in the bride age no more than the word of Noah would work in the days of Moses no more than Moses law would have worked in the time of Paul here he tried to tell them you are dead to that you cannot have that Church you who I'm speaking to tonight who is speaking here God himself Church you who I'm speaking to tonight Across the Nation if you've separated yourself from denomination all the filth and things of this world and all those things that keeps you in man-made Creeds and orders and things like that sorry you separate yourself look up get ready the fire is going to fall one of these days God is going to let him come and a sight to behold would you be ready when he comes would you be ready to go up with him when he comes the secret Rapture of the supernatural bride is not going to be a big cataclysmic event we've said this on Wednesday I just think it's so I don't know vital to say it the secret Rapture of the supernatural bride and what makes her Supernatural brothers and sisters now it's brother Barry and now I'm going to get inspired but what is it that makes her Supernatural it's not because she's got a first pull or a second pole Ministry or even a spoken word ministry I can say this is going to happen and it's going to happen the way that I say it or that I can discern things it's not it it's being able to receive the word for her day and say that word is my word it's not somebody else's word I'm not going to deviate there's no Creed or Dogma no traditional teaching that's going to take me and mix me up I'm only gonna take the word that's the supernatural portion of it because without that Supernatural portion you're going to say you know what some of this stuff is crazy you're talking about a prophet you're talking about seals you're talking about Mysteries you know I I could I can take all of it the blood of Jesus Christ and Jesus and all of that maybe even the baptism of of in Jesus name but when you start going into who she and he are one that's when it starts to get a little bit crazy but you know what that's what we're called to brothers and sisters the supernatural portion is our ability to just say Amen to the word it's not being able to make it something else not having a big prayer line and seeing great wonderful signs and wonders in our church it's just being able to stay with that word I believe was it Martin someone probably knows I know it's getting time to close but was it Martin they said the brother Bradham said the the the most incredible thing was that he was able to stay above all the fanaticism in his ministry when God started to bless his ministry it wasn't all the signs and wonders it said he was able to stay above all the fanaticism it's the same thing for us today brothers and sisters as we receive this word it becomes a supernatural word in our lives that was out of the invisible Union another quote had to come forth in the Pentecostal for the restoration of the gifts almost to deceive the very elected looks like a wheat grain open it up there's no wheat there at all it's only shuck but back in there then they begin to form the Oneness organization the Trinity organization the Tunis organization and Church of God organization and all organized and just death exactly you can't run a church like a business doesn't work that that that voice behind the man the inspiration said you businessmen stay out of the pulpit God what does he say here Trinity organization a Tunis organization and Church of God organization and all organized and just death exactly and now what happens but it's a shelter for the wheat it's been growing through it all the time so brothers and sisters when we look at different Ministries different churches different around the message of the hour don't point fingers don't scoff at people maybe we don't see it the way they see it maybe they don't see it the way that we see it but you know what we all need each other because we're all a part of the plant and you know what the most important thing is I think that God showed me this just towards the end of last year's we talk about that life cycle and how there's the there's the seed and and then there's the stock and then there's the tassel and then there's the shock and then there's the wheat back in there the seed at the very top you know what brothers and sisters it's a great example but if we catch the vision behind that it's the life that's behind the name it's not the plant it's not the portion or the cycle of the plant it's the life that's in the plant and you know what the seed holds all of that but so does all the rest of those portions and we need each part of the body we can't say brother Branham says it I can't say I'm pinky I'm mad at you so I'm just going to cut you off or big tall you stink I want to get rid of you we can't do that we need each part of the body we're all part of it brother Branham says now it's begin to pull away the Wheats begin to be seen this is not a Pentecostal age this is the latter day age this is the bride age this is the evening light this is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow God's pattern this is Luke 17 30 to be fulfilled this is the second dot dot dot what was he saying there this is the second dot dot dot and Jeremiah and all the rest of them that Joel has spoke of these days this is that day I have heard Lord and it was coming but now I see with my eye this is Brother Brad I'm speaking here now I have heard but now I see 1965. we okay this morning got another quote he says see a man can say anything but lest God interprets that word see now we have our own interpretation and we say it means this and this one Methodist says this Baptist says this Pentecostal says this Oneness says this tuna says this and oh my there you are but God don't need no interpreter he's his own interpreter he interprets his own word by vindicating it in the H that it's purpose for the age that it's given for so brothers and sisters if we get a revelation say God sent us a revelation take it back to the message of the hour and if it doesn't show up in the message of the hour take it back to the word of God and you know what if it doesn't show up in either one of those just leave it alone don't go out on the branch and say I'm going to fight to the death because I believe that God gave me a revelation you know what if it doesn't line up with the message of the hour it's not God's revelation I want to say it clearly it's a lying spirit just leave it alone remember that Satan comes to church Satan's religious Cain and Abel they both worshiped in the same church they were both taught the same message they both went to church they both went to Sunday school they both had the same parents they both were able to hear the voice of God both of them brother Branham says it very clearly the cane he was religious he was probably even more religious than Abel because he brought the beautiful spread the beauty of the land all the first fruits of the land what a beautiful display that would have been all the flowers and all the fruits everything laid out in its place a beautiful array of banquet table before the Lord what a tremendous thing but it wasn't what God wanted the Revelation was blood and we know that cable all he did was go and chop the neck of a of a helpless little innocent little lamb and his brother must have said screamed out and said you're crazy what are you doing that for that innocent lamb did nothing but it was a revelation and you know what he was an oddball in his day brother Adam says we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in another age see we're not living in the Methodist age we're living in another age we're living up on here to the bride age out of the calling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture that's the age where we're now living to my honest opinion that's exactly the truth this isn't something that brother Barry's just trying to spin it's just I believe a revelation that God showed me and then I went and looked it up and I'm saying wow this is beautiful modern events are made clear by prophecy that was that quote another quote now and with patience we have to wait for this for the prophecies that's promised every one of them must be fulfilled in its age for it for tells us the author has before done this and we wait to see him do it again what a time it is that we're living in something like a calendar you look at the calendar to find out what day of the year you're living in and you look at God's Bible to see what age we're living in we're not living in the Methodist stage at the Baptist age we're living in the bride Age The Calling bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back in he promised to do it but as it's been in every age people that man put their own interpretation to it by Theology and will not believe God's Divine Vindication of it what is God's Divine Vindication of it brothers and sisters he says that's God's interpretation not what I say what somebody else says but what God has promised and what God does proves that it's God's Own doing his own interpreting of his word modern events are made clear by prophecy the supernatural element brothers and sisters is not our ability to see the great signs and wonders to say that God sent a prophet and we can lay our hands on the sick and they shall recover and all these things that we can see with our senses it's not about that it's about being able to receive the word for our day when we can do that brothers and sisters we have got that super Church ability we've got that super raceness about us it's not about skin color it's about the Holy Spirit color it's about receiving the word for our day and getting that same one mind and one Accord attitude where we can see God move in our lives oh my didn't Jesus say in the last days Matthew 24 24 that there would be so close that it would deceive the very genes predestinated the elected ones if it was possible almost like the real thing see so in the last days now see it's weak time now it's getting Harvest Time this is not Luther's age this is not Pentecost age this is the bride age as Moses called a nation out of a Nation Christ today is calling a church out of a church you see the same thing in type taking them to the Glorious Eternal Promised Land he says now to refuse that person that's doing the calling many people would say well it's Brother Brad I'm doing the calling or or maybe it's brother Berry doing the calling or maybe it's another Minister somewhere doing the calling over the years here we have that that Covenant Angel speaking through the man he says now to refuse that person that's doing the calling Christ no matter if you're Pentecostal Methodist Luther whatever you are you've got to this age nothing against them not at all but this in this age now you've got to accept like they did in that age the person of Christ which is the word that's why brothers and sisters it goes right back to the very beginning we talked about it I no longer call you church I call you bride that you might understand it that you'll understand it that that will understand that when we receive the word we're not just receiving the word we're receiving Christ but when the devil can get in and raise up a scarecrow and say well now you're talking about some crazy things you know what really happened in the Garden of Eden that's a little bit nuts when we can say you know I don't really want a scream and shot I don't really want to worship I don't really believe that I need to go to church on Sundays and Wednesdays every time the doors are open I don't really have to have that desire to be there you know you don't but the bride does she's going to say I want to be there I want to follow the word of God for my day because we know that that's what it is it's not following a man it's not following an association it's not even following the message brothers and sisters we should take that word out for a little while take that word message out and just simply say Christ because he came in his word form he came down and opened the seals and revealed them to us and said just like I told my disciples I no longer call you servants I call you friends I no longer call you church I call your bride so that you'll understand this this is going somewhere and where this is going is back up to heaven you're going to come with me if you can receive this word but if you can't receive this word then you're probably going to be Earthbound we don't want to let anything hold us back we heard brother Branham say it invisible Union to the bread don't let anything hold you back brothers and sisters one day the fire is going to fall don't let any worldly thing hold us down don't let anybody talk you out of it nobody's Creeds or Traditions just get into Christ and see if he won't the person of Christ dissolve all the doubts about the message of the hour you know what in in this in this study that I was looking at here maybe I'll call the musicians we're we're going over time now I just feel like that you know when did Brother Brown mention this the last time he mentioned that it's the bride age where he talked about it being the person of Christ this word he talked about it in the message leadership and we know that leadership is the second last message to communion leadership is the last one that was preached and and communion was just sort of a Vindication that you know what I will discern the Lord's body before I go because we know he was called home after communion but you know brothers and sisters unless we're willing to be led we can't be led we're not going to be able to be led if it sounds crazy for me to say it that way but we've got to be willing to be led by the word to be able to have communion we're not going to be able to have communion if we can't accept Christ the word for our day I think it's just beautiful just beautiful I just want to encourage us when you press play and you hear that voice say good evening friends oh my goodness brothers and sisters go back to the Garden of Gethsemane where he was there with his disciples go back there with him and listen to him say that to his disciples I no longer call you servants but I call you bride so much more than they had even then you know what he said it good evening friends in the message of the hour 180 times good evening friends I just think it's such an encouraging thought but who said it brothers and sisters my you know as we go forwards in 2023 I just want you to know my heart brothers and sisters I don't have a big list of goals that I want to set with the church and say we're going to do this and do that and maybe the other I don't want to do that the only thing I want to do is say that I want to encourage every one of us to recognize our position I want us to recognize what we are because when we recognize that then we'll get out of here and the only way we're going to get out of here is to preach this message of the hour Christ the word of God in our day at the absolute highest level when you're playing hockey you have got to skate to where that Puck's going to be you have got to shoot the puck to where that skater is going to be you don't shoot it to where you're at right now we don't want to talk about where we're at right now the children of Israel didn't want to dwell upon where they were at right then they wanted to talk about that promise that was given to them there was a promise of all that I'm flowing with milk and honey and today we've been given that promise the opportunity to move right into Christ that is our promised land today brothers and sisters so as we go forwards in 2023 just so that you know my heart I want to see he has all come to the full recognition of the word of Jesus Christ and I know that I can't do it for anyone I can only do it for myself and the only way that's going to happen for this guy is a greater consecration I've been talking about it for a while but it's the same for every one of us if you want to be more consecrated brothers and sisters there is a call in your heart then you've got reason to Rejoice because God's still calling we have the ability to hear his voice just consecrate ourselves and he will do all the work the only thing that we need to do is just get ourselves out of the way maybe stand with me this afternoon foreign gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus this morning we just want to thank you Father this afternoon whatever it is today Lord Jesus for your goodness to us Lord I pray that somehow some way the words that were spoken today would just encourage us to recognize that we are not just a church but we're your bride and father we know that there's coming a day where that that that title too will change where we will no longer just be the bride because the wedding has already taken place and father we'll recognize that we're the wife of God heavenly father I pray that Lord you would just encourage us to to press play and Lord let us hear your voice say good evening friends to recognize that Lord we're no longer servants Lord there's no no lordship man over man but it's truly you coming and opening the word to us individually giving us the new birth Lord Jesus father we pray that you would just lead us and guide us as we go forwards in 23 Lord we could never do it on our own Lord nor would we ever want to try Father we need you every step of the way Lord every decision that we make father every time that we have a thought Lord let us take it into captivity according to your word and run it through your filter Lord and then decide whether we should speak or act or walk or do father we just love you and we just ask Lord that you would go with us now as we
