[41:26] partnership in a sound studio and I've
[41:27] invited some of the brothers to come and
[41:29] see it. But he's had quite a
[41:30] deliverance. He worked for me and and uh
[41:32] got delivered of alcohol supernaturally
[41:34] got delivered from from addictions. He
[41:36] he said he met Jesus. He he met him like
[41:38] a completely worldly man. Oh, so to my
[41:42] help he after he left me he met Jesus.
[41:44] So, I don't know what happened along the
[41:46] way, but uh thought that song, he's just
[41:49] a real musician. He really loves he's
[41:51] got a band, so he's an interesting man.
[41:53] But, uh that song, I think, would really
[41:55] speak to him. So, we'll see if we can
[41:56] use that somehow. Wonderful to be a
[41:59] Christian. Wonderful to be the life, be
[42:01] that light to the world.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Many times we maybe don't think we're
[42:05] doing the job we ought to, but the Lord
[42:07] knows. And as Sister Amber's testimony
[42:10] the other night, just just your life,
[42:12] just your life is a light to the world.
[42:15] And we thank the Lord for that. Down
[42:17] from his glory. Let's sing just the
[42:18] chorus of that as our pastor comes.
[42:20] Sorry I did a little tight timing here,
[42:22] but [music] maybe we could sing the last
[42:24] verse first and then the chorus.
[42:28] without [singing] reluctance.
[42:34] Oh, flesh and blood
[42:37] is substance.
[42:41] [music]
[42:42] He took [singing]
[42:44] the form of man [music]
[42:48] and he revealed
[42:51] the hidden [music]
[42:53] lamb. [singing]
[42:56] Oh, glorious [music]
[42:58] mystery
[43:02] and sacrifice.
[43:04] [music and singing]
[43:10] [music]
[43:17] Heat.
[43:20] [music]
[43:23] Heat.
[43:25] [music]
[43:32] [music]
[43:33] Oh,
[43:38] [music]
[43:43] [music]
[43:49] heat,
[43:51] [music and singing]
[43:53] heat.
[43:57] [music]
[43:58] is [singing] my savior
[44:03] [music]
[44:04] and all.
[44:10] [music]
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Do you believe that this
[44:18] morning?
[44:20] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. Welcome to
[44:21] the house of the Lord once again. What
[44:24] an honor and a privilege it is to gather
[44:25] [music] together in his name.
[44:28] We have a few requests we'd like to
[44:29] bring before the throne today.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Certainly thankful that we have a place
[44:36] that we can go to.
[44:38] Um, first off,
[44:43] Sister Anna had a note she wanted to
[44:46] write. Uh, she wrote, "Shalom, saints. I
[44:49] want to take [music] this opportunity to
[44:51] thank the church for welcoming me with
[44:53] open arms and love. The fellowship and
[44:56] warmth were heartwarming. By God's
[44:59] grace, my stay has come to an end. And
[45:02] I'll be leaving, God willing, tomorrow
[45:04] to Ontario. I enjoyed being amongst you.
[45:08] I'm thankful for this wonderful family
[45:10] of God.
[45:12] May the Lord, good Lord, bless you all
[45:15] richly. Sister Anna, I bless you,
[45:18] sister. It's been an honor to have you
[45:20] with us. Amen.
[45:23] We have a request
[45:26] um for sister Shantel who is at home
[45:29] sick today. I believe
[45:31] we have a request for brother Emanuel
[45:34] Lobe for those who were here at the
[45:38] prayer meeting. You know there was a
[45:39] [music] request from our brother for his
[45:43] mom and his dad and the Lord saw fit to
[45:46] take his mom home.
[45:49] We want to pray for comfort for brother
[45:51] Emanuel and the family.
[45:53] It can't be easy being in a different
[45:55] country um having to go through
[45:58] something like this. And we certainly
[46:00] pray the Lord will comfort our brother.
[46:01] And we also want to remember his father
[46:04] who has encountered a stroke as well
[46:07] before this happened. That was the other
[46:09] request that he had on Thursday evening
[46:12] at the prayer meeting. So we want to
[46:13] remember brother Emanuel and his family
[46:18] and everyone affected by it. We also
[46:21] want to pray for the Charac family. I
[46:23] think I said that correctly in South
[46:25] Africa. They lost everything they have
[46:28] in a fire on the farm where they live.
[46:31] That's from Sister Michelle. So we want
[46:33] to remember the Charack family as well.
[46:35] If you have a need this morning, by all
[46:37] [music] means defy gravity and just make
[46:40] it known unto him.
[46:43] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus,
[46:46] we thank you for this another
[46:47] opportunity, Lord, where we can gather
[46:49] together in your name. And Lord Jesus,
[46:52] know that, Father, we're not just
[46:54] gathering together under the banner of
[46:57] love that so many people will do. We
[47:00] gather under the banner of a just God.
[47:03] He's not a dirty old grandpa, but a God
[47:06] of judgment, a God of love, a God of
[47:10] care and concern. And Father, we're so
[47:13] thankful that we can know you in spirit
[47:15] and in truth.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; And Father, we can worship you in spirit
[47:19] and in truth. And that's why we've
[47:20] gathered here today, Father, so that we
[47:22] can push aside one more time all of the
[47:25] humanity that we have in our lives,
[47:28] this condition of living in a pest
[47:30] house, Lord. and Father, looking into
[47:33] your word to see the reflection of you
[47:35] once again.
[47:38] Heavenly Father, we're just so thankful
[47:40] and honored that we can bring our
[47:42] requests unto you, Lord. We know that
[47:45] you are more than able
[47:47] &gt;&gt; to meet the needs in [music] our lives.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; And Father, we just we just offer every
[47:52] single request that was made known unto
[47:53] you today by the way of an uplift hand
[47:55] unto you, Father.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; And we ask that you would meet the need
[47:59] sovereignly, Lord, that you would bless
[48:00] the individuals
[48:02] according to your will. And Father, we
[48:05] want to ask Lord also that you would be
[48:07] with Brother Emanuel, Lord, and Sister
[48:10] Michelle, Father, and Sister Karen,
[48:12] Lord, the Loe family here. We pray that
[48:15] you would just comfort them, Lord. That
[48:17] you would be their portion, Lord, in
[48:19] this time,
[48:21] &gt;&gt; this time of loss, this time of
[48:23] mourning. Father, we know that when you
[48:25] take someone home, there's no way that
[48:27] can ever be filled here on this side of
[48:28] [music] eternity. And father, we just
[48:30] ask that you would comfort them. Lord,
[48:32] you said that you would bind up the
[48:34] brokenhearted. Father,
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we pray that you would just
[48:38] minister to the family, Lord.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Grace and peace. Father, we pray for
[48:44] Brother Emanuel's dad, Lord, who
[48:47] suffered a stroke. Lord, it's not easy
[48:49] on this side, and we know that you know
[48:52] that,
[48:52] &gt;&gt; but we just want to commit our brother
[48:54] into your hands as well, Father, that
[48:56] you would help him in this time of need.
[49:00] Lord, it just has to be so difficult to
[49:03] have a stroke and then lose your wife.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; We pray for brother Emanuel that he
[49:07] would have words of wisdom. Lord Jesus,
[49:10] words of encouragement for his family.
[49:12] We pray that you would just bear him up
[49:14] on the wings of an eagle. Father,
[49:17] Lord Jesus, we pray for sister Chantel
[49:19] who was home today sick. Lord, thank you
[49:21] that you have already healed her
[49:23] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. And Father, we
[49:26] just want to remember the the Charac
[49:29] family in South Africa. Lord, I can't
[49:32] imagine what it would be like to lose
[49:34] everything that you have for earthly
[49:36] possessions in a fire. Lord, can imagine
[49:40] they're probably searching their hearts,
[49:42] Lord, wondering what happened, why it
[49:44] happened, all kinds of questions. But
[49:47] Lord, we pray that you would just
[49:48] [music] bring a peace that passes all
[49:50] understanding to the family, Lord.
[49:53] And we know that Job, he had to go
[49:56] through a trial, Father, you that you
[49:57] saw fit for him.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; And Lord, your word says that when you
[50:01] were done trying Job, when all of that
[50:04] was over, that his friends and family
[50:06] came by and they they gave him an
[50:08] earring of gold and they offered unto
[50:11] him offerings, Lord. And we know that
[50:14] his end was greater than his beginning,
[50:16] Father. Amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just pray that same
[50:19] blessing for this family, Lord, that's
[50:20] going through a trial now. Father, we
[50:22] know that you're more than able.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to commit all these
[50:27] needs into your [music] hands now today.
[50:29] Father, as we turn to your word, we pray
[50:31] that you would be glorified in all
[50:33] that's said and done. Lord, one more
[50:35] time that you would speak to us, Father,
[50:37] lip to ear that, Lord, we would have
[50:39] hearts to receive that word
[50:41] &gt;&gt; when it comes forward, Lord Jesus. said,
[50:44] "Father, we'll be careful to give you
[50:45] the praise. We love you and we thank
[50:47] you. We just ask all these things in
[50:50] Jesus Christ's name we pray."
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. Thank
[50:57] you musicians. [clears throat]
[50:58] If you have your Bibles, I would like to
[51:00] read a scripture today.
[51:02] Take a little bit of a break from
[51:04] questions and answers and read from the
[51:06] book of Judges.
[51:09] The book of Judges, chapter 6.
[51:17] Judges chapter 6.
[51:34] Judges chapter 6 verse 7. And it came to
[51:38] pass when the children of Israel cried
[51:40] unto the Lord because of the Midionites
[51:44] that the Lord sent a prophet unto the
[51:47] children of Israel. Isn't that wonderful
[51:50] how God answers? Amen.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; The Lord sent them a prophet
[51:55] unto the children of Israel, which said
[51:57] unto them, "Thus saith the Lord God of
[52:00] Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and
[52:04] brought you from out of the house of
[52:06] bondage, and I delivered you out of the
[52:10] hand of the Egyptians, and out of the
[52:13] hand of all that oppressed you, and
[52:15] drove them out from before you, and gave
[52:19] you their land.
[52:21] And I said unto you, I am the Lord your
[52:26] God.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Fear not the gods of the Amorites, in
[52:30] whose land ye dwell,
[52:33] but ye have not obeyed my voice.
[52:38] And there came an angel of the Lord, and
[52:42] sat under an oak,
[52:44] which was in Ofra,
[52:47] that pertained unto Joash
[52:50] the Abiserite.
[52:52] And his son Gideon threshed wheat by the
[52:55] wine press to hide it from the
[52:58] Midianites.
[53:00] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[53:02] him, and said unto him,"The
[53:05] Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of
[53:09] valor."
[53:11] And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord,
[53:14] if the Lord be with us, why then is all
[53:18] this befallen us? And where be all his
[53:22] miracles, which our fathers told us of,
[53:25] saying, Did not the Lord bring us up out
[53:29] up from Egypt? But now the Lord hath
[53:32] forsaken us and delivered us into the
[53:35] hands of the Midianites.
[53:39] This is such an interesting scripture
[53:40] because it goes from being the angel of
[53:42] the Lord here, right, who speaks to him.
[53:46] And the Lord looked upon him and said,
[53:49] "Go in this thy might, and thou shalt
[53:52] save Israel from the hand of the
[53:54] Midionites."
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Have not I sent thee?
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[54:04] word. Thank you for the story of Gideon,
[54:06] the life of Gideon.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, that we can read this
[54:10] scripture
[54:12] &gt;&gt; by revelation, Lord. Amen.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Not by revelation of a school, not by
[54:16] revelation of a tradition or of a
[54:18] church,
[54:20] &gt;&gt; but we can read this by revelation by
[54:22] your spirit.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; And father, we pray that you would just
[54:26] help us, Lord, as we peel back the
[54:28] layers of our lives, Lord Jesus, to just
[54:31] minister to our very souls one more
[54:33] time, Lord Jesus, by your grace, this
[54:36] word through revelation to our souls.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; And we'll be careful to give you praise.
[54:41] We just ask all these things in Jesus
[54:44] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be
[54:48] seated.
[54:52] Just a few announcements before we get
[54:54] going. I think it's really wonderful
[54:56] that we have brother Maxwell Bang Jr.
[54:58] coming here. We've talked actually about
[55:01] having him here for at least a couple
[55:03] years and uh the time is nigh. January
[55:07] 24th at 6 PM and the 25th at 10:00 a.m.
[55:12] He will be here and take two services
[55:13] for us. We got the 25th youth meeting.
[55:16] We've got the 30th youth service. We
[55:20] have a 31st ladies brunch happening. And
[55:23] uh yes, the sisters also get to go out
[55:27] and uh enjoy a meal in the hotel like
[55:30] the brothers did. So that should be
[55:31] wonderful.
[55:33] Nice to have a break from all the
[55:36] sisters have to do. Getting into
[55:38] February, it's tough to imagine we're
[55:40] actually talking about that even,
[55:42] &gt;&gt; but here we are almost mid January. Um
[55:46] February 5th, we're going to have a
[55:47] prayer meeting for those who want to
[55:50] come. Um February 6th, we'll have a gym
[55:53] night. February the 14th, we're going to
[55:56] have the men's breakfast.
[55:58] And uh February the 15th, we've got the
[56:01] youth group. And February the 16th, we
[56:04] have booked the uh indoor arena, the
[56:07] Centennial Arena in Okatokes for
[56:10] skating. So we certainly want to invite
[56:13] anyone who is interested in that to come
[56:15] have a wonderful time in the Lord. Are
[56:18] you happy this morning?
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Certainly thankful for this word and uh
[56:22] the scripture in Judges chapter 6. I I
[56:27] just love how the Lord deals with us and
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's always leading us and it's
[56:32] just up to us to be willing to follow
[56:35] his leadership in our lives. And
[56:37] &gt;&gt; you know, I got a bunch of quotes that
[56:39] I'm going to bring today and we'll get
[56:41] into this. I I just think it's so good.
[56:43] But brother says in one of these quotes
[56:45] that, you know, when we have the
[56:47] leadership of the Lord, it's such a
[56:48] wonderful thing to have it. And he says
[56:50] you might have it. And uh I believe he's
[56:53] speaking to everyone. And it's not any
[56:56] individual, but he says, "You know, you
[56:59] might have it." Boy, I don't know what
[57:01] just happened. Something happened to the
[57:03] sound here. I uh Sorry,
[57:08] brother Bradom. He says that uh we might
[57:10] have something, but uh he said we won't
[57:13] know until the fruit of it actually
[57:15] comes to life. So, uh did I do something
[57:18] wrong there? Was that me? No. Okay, that
[57:23] was uh that was interesting. My voice
[57:24] got really loud, really boommy. Um, but
[57:29] I think it's wonderful. Brother Bam
[57:31] says, you can't tell what's in the seed
[57:34] when you plant it in the ground.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; You got to let it grow.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; You got to let the fruit of it bear
[57:39] what's inside of it.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; And you know, every seed will bring
[57:43] after what? Its own kind. And it cannot
[57:47] imitate other seeds. And all we've got
[57:51] to do is continue to water the lives
[57:54] that we have by the word of God. And as
[57:57] long as we do that, God will bring to
[58:00] pass whatever seed is inside of each and
[58:03] every one of us.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; It's such a wonderful promise. I I just
[58:07] love this scripture today. I felt led to
[58:09] get into this this scripture here
[58:10] directly and um we just trust the Lord
[58:13] will bless it today. talking about this
[58:15] story of the uh of the children of
[58:18] Israel in the book of Judges and dealing
[58:21] with all of these uh Midianites coming
[58:23] in and taking all of their food, their
[58:26] provisions. They work so hard to set
[58:29] aside the food for their families and
[58:31] and everyone, all their animals and and
[58:34] what happens is the enemies that are in
[58:36] the land would just march right on in
[58:38] and take everything for themselves. they
[58:41] would spare nothing for the people in
[58:44] the land of Israel. What a terrible
[58:46] thing that is. These were the ones who
[58:48] God did bring up out of bondage in
[58:51] Egypt. They were there according to the
[58:53] promise 400 years that they would live
[58:56] in bondage, but then they were
[58:57] delivered. They were brought up into
[58:59] this land. And and it's wonderful to
[59:01] look at this because the the children of
[59:03] Israel in verse 7 here it says, "And it
[59:06] came to pass when the children of Israel
[59:08] cried unto the Lord because of the
[59:09] Midionites."
[59:11] Why were they crying unto the Lord
[59:13] because of the Midianites? They were in
[59:15] their promised land. They shouldn't have
[59:16] any issues.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; The book of Joshua said that no man
[59:20] should be able to stand before you all
[59:22] the days of your life. And he said that
[59:24] to Joshua, but he also Joshua brought
[59:27] that to the people.
[59:29] So here they are now in their promised
[59:31] positions and they're crying out to the
[59:34] Lord saying, "Why is this befallen us?
[59:37] Why do we have to have this problem?
[59:39] What's the situation here?"
[59:42] But if we go back to the beginning of
[59:44] chapter 6, let's just go to verse one.
[59:47] I love how the Lord does it in his word.
[59:49] He doesn't leave us wondering. He
[59:51] doesn't leave us hanging. He explains it
[59:53] very clearly over and over and over
[59:55] again, especially in the book of Judges.
[59:59] And the children of Israel did evil in
[1:00:01] the sight of the Lord.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Here they are in the promised land and
[1:00:07] and they had an address by the prophet
[1:00:09] in their day Joshua. They probably heard
[1:00:12] Moses saying, "Stay with the Lord.
[1:00:15] Follow his instruction. Don't go to the
[1:00:17] right hand or to the left. Follow the
[1:00:20] Lord." [clears throat]
[1:00:22] But what did they do? They did evil in
[1:00:24] the sight of the Lord. And the Lord
[1:00:26] delivered them into the hand of the
[1:00:28] Midian. Seven years.
[1:00:32] And the hand of the Midian prevailed
[1:00:34] against Israel. And because of the
[1:00:36] Midianites, the children of Israel made
[1:00:39] them dens which are in the mountains and
[1:00:41] caves and strongholds.
[1:00:44] They ran and hid in their promised land.
[1:00:48] Now, I'm going to do what I always do
[1:00:50] and jump to the punch line. And I wonder
[1:00:51] if sometimes as sons and daughters of
[1:00:54] the most high God living in our promised
[1:00:57] land with a baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:01:00] do we sometimes make provision for the
[1:01:02] devil and run and hide into a den and
[1:01:05] cave and say if God be with us, then
[1:01:08] where's all the miracles?
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Let's not make any room for the devil.
[1:01:15] Let's not give him any excuse. He's got
[1:01:16] no excuse. Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; The promise for the devil in the day in
[1:01:20] which we live today is that he will be
[1:01:23] taken alive and thrown into the lake of
[1:01:26] fire where the beast and the false
[1:01:27] prophet are. That's the prophecy
[1:01:29] concerning him.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Now, some might say, well, the the word
[1:01:34] also says, "Woe to you, O earth and sea,
[1:01:36] those people that that are living on the
[1:01:38] earth because the time is short. The
[1:01:40] devil, he's coming with a great wrath.
[1:01:42] If we're in God and God is in us, he
[1:01:44] can't touch us. Not unless he first
[1:01:47] allows for it.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; But the only time he's really going to
[1:01:51] allow for it is if we start doing evil
[1:01:54] in his sight.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; But it came to pass when the children of
[1:01:59] Israel cried unto the Lord because of
[1:02:01] the Midianites
[1:02:03] that the Lord sent a prophet. It's so
[1:02:05] beautiful in our lives. He he is the
[1:02:07] same yesterday, today, and forever,
[1:02:09] brothers and sisters. We say that all
[1:02:10] the time. But if if you see the
[1:02:12] inspiration that I got for this um
[1:02:16] if God before us
[1:02:19] then where is all the miracles 1961
[1:02:21] brother Brandham preached this message.
[1:02:23] Uh if you listen to this message I
[1:02:25] highly recommend please listen to this
[1:02:27] message. Brother Brandham says it way
[1:02:28] better than brother Barry ever could.
[1:02:30] But I just wanted to try and bring us an
[1:02:32] an encouragement today because we've
[1:02:34] been talking about the the working of
[1:02:35] miracles on Wednesday for those people
[1:02:37] that don't come on Wednesdays. That's
[1:02:39] what we've been talking about is the the
[1:02:41] gifts, the fruit of the spirit in the
[1:02:44] church. And brother Brandham talks about
[1:02:45] how every single sovereign assembly,
[1:02:48] every assembly ought to see every one of
[1:02:50] those gifts manifesting in that church.
[1:02:53] The gifts are to profit every man with
[1:02:55] all. That's the word of God. And and the
[1:02:57] gifts that we see in the body are for
[1:03:00] the body.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; I don't have the gift of healing for
[1:03:03] brother Barry. I'm not saying I have
[1:03:04] that gift, by the way. But if I did, I I
[1:03:06] don't have it for me. It's for you.
[1:03:09] It's for the people that would need it.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; If somebody has the gift of wisdom, it
[1:03:13] doesn't give them the opportunity to be
[1:03:15] puffed up.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; It's for the body.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; If somebody has a gift of the spirit,
[1:03:21] it's for everyone else.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; The only interesting thing is the person
[1:03:27] who has that gift and allows the Lord to
[1:03:29] operate it perfectly because we can't
[1:03:31] operate it. But if we allow the Lord to
[1:03:33] operate it perfectly the way that he
[1:03:35] wants to, then it becomes a blessing to
[1:03:37] us as well.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; But if God be with us, then where is all
[1:03:44] the miracles? Brother Brandham preaches
[1:03:45] this message and it's out of verse 13.
[1:03:47] And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord,
[1:03:49] if the Lord be with us, why then is all
[1:03:52] this befallen us? And where be all the
[1:03:54] miracles which our fathers told us of?"
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; And you know, in this message, Brother
[1:03:59] Bradom, he says it in a few different
[1:04:01] places. If God be God, then show the
[1:04:04] miracles. Let us see God be God.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; And I know I've heard it in the past
[1:04:10] where someone would say that, you know,
[1:04:12] God is God. We should never say that.
[1:04:15] But sometimes in our lives, I think it's
[1:04:17] important to say that because we need to
[1:04:19] know that God is the same yesterday,
[1:04:21] today, and forever. Not for everyone
[1:04:22] else. I don't want to look around and
[1:04:25] see that God is active in other people's
[1:04:27] lives and be wondering in my own life. I
[1:04:29] want to say, Lord, be active in my life.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Let me be seeing you alive and well in
[1:04:35] here.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And not let it be just a Calgary living
[1:04:40] word experience.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; A church experience, brothers and
[1:04:43] sisters, will put us in the tribulation.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; If we've just got a church experience,
[1:04:48] we've missed the boat. We've missed the
[1:04:50] point of the message of the hour. The
[1:04:52] message of the hour is to stand up and
[1:04:54] trim your lamp and make sure you've got
[1:04:56] enough oil in that lamp to be able to
[1:04:58] see the bridegroom because he's already
[1:05:00] come.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Some people would say, "Well, we're
[1:05:04] still here, Brother Barry." Yeah, it's a
[1:05:06] word coming of the Lord. What happened
[1:05:08] on Sunset Mountain in 1963?
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; That cloud wasn't just a cloud. A
[1:05:14] mystery cloud 26 miles high,
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; And what? 50 miles across. No, no, no,
[1:05:20] no, no. Brother Bradom says it in it is
[1:05:22] the rising of the sun. Take a look at it
[1:05:24] and look at it the right way. Turn it
[1:05:26] right. When you turn it right, you can
[1:05:28] see eyes and a nose.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; You can see the face of someone.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; But if God be with us, then where's all
[1:05:38] the miracles?
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not preaching to say we've got
[1:05:41] to see signs and wonders. The signs and
[1:05:44] wonders just follow.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; The fruit of the spirit just happens. We
[1:05:50] can't manufacture fruit.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom, he said it. We read that
[1:05:54] quote, I think on Wednesday, maybe.
[1:05:55] Maybe maybe it was last week. I can't
[1:05:56] remember now. But he said, "You don't
[1:05:59] you don't pour the apples into the tree
[1:06:00] so that the apples can come out of the
[1:06:02] tree." No. No. That tree just drinks in
[1:06:04] the water and drinks in the sun, soaks
[1:06:07] in the sunlight, and we know that it
[1:06:09] photosynthesizes and and the life that's
[1:06:11] inside that tree, it actually causes the
[1:06:14] seed to come forward. But where does
[1:06:16] that seed come from? Right?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; It only comes from the fruit.
[1:06:21] [laughter]
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; And you know what? We're talking about
[1:06:23] seed time today. We're not even talking
[1:06:24] about fruits. So where I believe we're
[1:06:27] going with this discussion about the
[1:06:28] fruit of the spirit, brothers and
[1:06:30] sisters, is so far beyond. We're not
[1:06:33] looking to see whether we we can see the
[1:06:35] fruit of the spirit and and my goodness,
[1:06:37] then we've got it. Sure enough, we do
[1:06:39] want to see the fruit of the spirit, but
[1:06:40] we're talking about seed time. This is
[1:06:42] the time where the life has gone from
[1:06:44] the seed all the way through all of the
[1:06:47] stages of the growth right back to the
[1:06:49] seed again.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it that he can
[1:06:53] hear the sound of the combine coming by.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; So, we need to get ready
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; because one of these days we're not
[1:07:00] going to see the Lord coming.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; We're going to see the Lord going.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; And I think that's the greatest
[1:07:06] misconception the church has today is
[1:07:08] that we're going to see the coming of
[1:07:09] the Lord. He's already come
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; according to the word for our day.
[1:07:14] According to the message of the hour,
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; we have an open book. [screaming] Who
[1:07:19] could possibly bring this title deed of
[1:07:22] redemption down to earth
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; but one person?
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; How could we have that here? How could
[1:07:29] we have the fully revealed word? You
[1:07:31] know, some people might say, "Well,
[1:07:33] maybe it's not fully revealed." And
[1:07:35] maybe it's not for some.
[1:07:38] But we have a man that we know to be a
[1:07:40] prophet that said all seven seals were
[1:07:42] opened.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; And where did they come from?
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; This is where I think it becomes really
[1:07:47] treacherous for people when they say,
[1:07:48] "Oh, how could that man who he makes
[1:07:50] himself somebody?" No, he doesn't. The
[1:07:53] word vindicated who he was.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; And we know that Jesus said, "Hey, you
[1:07:57] know what? If you can't believe me and
[1:07:58] the words that I say unto you, then just
[1:08:00] believe the works because nobody could
[1:08:02] do the things that I've done."
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:06] But we know that all seven seals were
[1:08:07] open. And brother Brandham said, "You
[1:08:09] know, there was a time where I thought
[1:08:10] the seals they would have to come from
[1:08:12] without. They would they would come from
[1:08:14] heaven. Maybe they would come from some
[1:08:16] other source. They weren't yet revealed.
[1:08:19] But we know the Lord, the angel of the
[1:08:21] Lord, the Lord himself." He says it in
[1:08:23] this message, too, by the way, that the
[1:08:24] angel of the Lord is the Lord. We read
[1:08:26] that in the scripture. Some might want
[1:08:28] to contest that, but you know, we could
[1:08:30] talk about it for a long time. It's
[1:08:31] irrelevant. God spoke to Gideon in this
[1:08:34] message.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; He did.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; But we know that William Brandom, he
[1:08:38] said that all those seals had to be
[1:08:40] contained in that book,
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Because we can't add to it or take from
[1:08:46] it because if we add to it, then we will
[1:08:48] actually have the plagues in that book
[1:08:50] added to us. And if we take away from
[1:08:52] that book, then we will have the
[1:08:53] blessings in that book taken away from
[1:08:55] us also. We know that's out of the book
[1:08:57] of Revelation. But today I want to talk
[1:08:59] about if God be with us then where's all
[1:09:01] these all the miracles 1961
[1:09:04] 1231E
[1:09:07] brother Bradam he talks about this in
[1:09:08] such a a magnificent way and uh I just I
[1:09:12] just like to follow the leadership of
[1:09:13] the Lord here.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; You know reading our scripture we can go
[1:09:18] back to 13
[1:09:20] of Judges chapter 6. Why did they find
[1:09:22] themselves in this situation? Because
[1:09:24] they stopped following the the
[1:09:25] leadership of the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:28] Brother Bradom says it in this message.
[1:09:30] They uh followed tradition. They
[1:09:32] followed creed. They followed uh
[1:09:35] seminary. They followed all kinds of
[1:09:37] different traditions. And and it's what
[1:09:39] got them here. But in verse 13, Gideon
[1:09:42] here talking to the angel of the Lord,
[1:09:45] the Lord himself. Then Gideon said unto
[1:09:48] him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with
[1:09:51] us, why then is all this befallen us?
[1:09:55] And where be all the miracles which our
[1:09:57] fathers told us, saying, "Did not the
[1:09:59] Lord bring us up out of Egypt? But now
[1:10:02] the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered
[1:10:05] us into the hands of the Midionites."
[1:10:07] Can you imagine saying that to the Lord?
[1:10:09] You have forsaken us.
[1:10:12] My And the Lord looked upon him and
[1:10:14] said, "Go in this thy might, and thou
[1:10:19] shalt save Israel from the hand of the
[1:10:20] Midionites. Have not I sent thee?"
[1:10:24] And he said unto him, "Oh my Lord,
[1:10:27] wherewith shall I save Israel?
[1:10:31] Behold, my family is poor in Manasseh,
[1:10:35] and I am the least in my father's
[1:10:38] house."
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't that just exactly the way God does
[1:10:42] it?
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; The way he chooses people.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; He chooses the abase and he doesn't take
[1:10:48] the proud.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; We know the proud ones, he just pushes
[1:10:51] aside. Right.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; The Lord said unto him, "Surely I will
[1:10:56] be with thee, and thou shalt smite the
[1:10:58] Midionites as one man." And he said unto
[1:11:01] him, "If now I have found grace in thy
[1:11:04] sight, then show me a sign that thou
[1:11:07] talkest with me."
[1:11:10] So beautiful, isn't it?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; You know, brothers and sisters, don't be
[1:11:13] afraid to ask him for a sign.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to ask him, "Show me
[1:11:20] that you're with me. Show me that you're
[1:11:22] God.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; If you're God, then be God to me.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Make yourself so real to me. It doesn't
[1:11:28] matter what anybody else says. Doesn't
[1:11:31] matter what anybody else thinks because
[1:11:33] I know that you live
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; when it gets to that level, brothers and
[1:11:37] sisters. It won't matter. It'll it'll
[1:11:39] change everything about us.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Continue on here. Verse 18. Can you
[1:11:44] imagine here? You have an angel of the
[1:11:46] Lord talking to you, the Lord himself
[1:11:49] speaking to you and a a theophony body
[1:11:51] and a body that he created himself. And
[1:11:54] say to him, depart not hence I pray thee
[1:11:56] until I come unto thee and bring forth
[1:11:59] my present and set it before thee. And
[1:12:02] he said, I will tarry until thou come
[1:12:05] again.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; In this message, brother Brandham says,
[1:12:08] you know, that was probably about 3
[1:12:10] hours.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Let's continue on. A and
[1:12:13] Gideon went in and made ready a kid and
[1:12:16] unleavened cakes of an ephath of flour
[1:12:20] and flesh he put in a basket and he put
[1:12:22] the broth in a pot and brought it out
[1:12:25] unto him under the oak and presented it.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; How long would it take to kill a kid?
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; To get all that food ready, to cook it
[1:12:35] down, to bake the cakes, to get
[1:12:37] everything ready. How long would that
[1:12:39] take? My
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; and and the angel
[1:12:44] of God said unto him, "Take the flesh
[1:12:47] and the unleavened cakes and lay them
[1:12:49] upon this rock and pour out the broth."
[1:12:53] And he did so. And the angel of the Lord
[1:12:56] put forth the end of his staff that was
[1:12:59] in his hand and touched the flesh and
[1:13:02] the unleavened cakes. And there rose up
[1:13:05] a fire out of the rock and consumed the
[1:13:08] flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the
[1:13:11] angel of the Lord departed out of his
[1:13:14] sight.
[1:13:16] What a tremendous picture that is.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; What a tremendous introduction that is.
[1:13:21] And you know that's the beginning of the
[1:13:23] relationship that Gideon had with the
[1:13:25] God of his fathers.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Isn't it? It's where God made himself so
[1:13:31] real to this man. And we know there's
[1:13:33] lots more to this story we're not going
[1:13:34] to get into. We're just only going to
[1:13:36] touch on this this very beginning part
[1:13:38] here. Verse 23. Oh, verse 22. And when
[1:13:41] Gideon perceived that he was an angel of
[1:13:44] the Lord, Gideon said, "Alas, oh Lord
[1:13:46] God, for because I have seen an angel of
[1:13:49] the Lord face to face." And the Lord
[1:13:52] said unto him, "Peace be unto thee, fear
[1:13:56] not. Thou shalt not die." I think this
[1:14:01] part's beautiful. Verse 24. Then Gideon
[1:14:03] built an altar there unto the Lord and
[1:14:06] called it Jehovah Shalom. Unto this day
[1:14:10] it is yet an O of
[1:14:14] the Aizites, Bizerites.
[1:14:18] I just think it's such a wonderful story
[1:14:20] to look at this and think how Gideon,
[1:14:23] this one that was caught in bondage, he
[1:14:25] wasn't the one necessarily that did the
[1:14:27] wrong. He was a righteous man. Brother
[1:14:29] Brandham says in this message and we
[1:14:32] know that his parents taught him right.
[1:14:34] Brother Brandham talks about that as
[1:14:36] well. He must have been taught correctly
[1:14:38] because he went immediately to scripture
[1:14:40] and said, you know, if God be with us,
[1:14:43] even though you say he is, if he is with
[1:14:45] us, then why are we under this bondage?
[1:14:47] Why do we actually not have the freedom
[1:14:50] in this promised land that we're
[1:14:52] supposed to have?
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; But Brandham says he was able to look
[1:14:55] back at scripture. He was able to put it
[1:14:57] on a scriptural basis which is so
[1:15:00] wonderful. Brother Brandham in in early
[1:15:02] in the message he says and how that they
[1:15:04] had done the Israelites the Philistines
[1:15:08] and the Midianites and the Amorites and
[1:15:10] all the different ones
[1:15:13] had come in like locusts and just eat up
[1:15:17] whatever they had and take it out and go
[1:15:21] on. And don't think for a second that
[1:15:24] they just came in and and discreetly
[1:15:26] took the food, whatever food they
[1:15:28] wanted. No doubt about it. They took
[1:15:31] whatever they wanted.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; And go on. He says, "But did you notice
[1:15:37] they could not do that until Israel
[1:15:40] first fell away from God?"
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; First Israel had to fall away from God.
[1:15:45] They were in their promised land. And
[1:15:47] sometimes I think maybe we can be in our
[1:15:49] promised land too, but we just get a
[1:15:52] little distracted. And you know, falling
[1:15:54] away from God isn't necessarily leaving
[1:15:57] the church.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily leaving your post
[1:16:00] of duty.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily leaving your
[1:16:03] marriage,
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily doing gross,
[1:16:07] terrible things. Right?
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's just a little distraction
[1:16:11] in life taking our our vision and our
[1:16:14] mind and our heart away from where we
[1:16:16] are at.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; You know the word says that where much
[1:16:19] is given much will be required
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; in the day in which we live
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; to know this word is an open book that
[1:16:27] we have more than ever any age has ever
[1:16:31] had. How much will be required for us in
[1:16:34] the day in which we live?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; I think it's absolutely tremendous.
[1:16:39] The devil can't set a foot on you to
[1:16:41] hurt you until first you get away from
[1:16:45] God.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; You must first remember that.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Check when anything happens. See if you
[1:16:53] are in the faith or not.
[1:16:56] And you know, I'll say this, brothers
[1:16:58] and sisters. I think it's very
[1:16:59] important. It's vital. We can say that
[1:17:02] we have everything in order according to
[1:17:03] the message of the hour and still be
[1:17:06] wrong.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. in our lives.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; We understand the message of the hour to
[1:17:11] the letter.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Never had error in our lives at all. But
[1:17:15] who is in our heart?
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Because this message of the hour is
[1:17:19] supposed to turn our hearts back to the
[1:17:21] faith of the Pentecostal fathers.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Which is exactly according to the book
[1:17:25] of Acts,
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; which is the Lord Jesus Christ alive and
[1:17:29] well. Hebrews 13:8 in our lives. But
[1:17:32] brother Brandham says it that we can
[1:17:33] have the Holy Ghost every day of our
[1:17:34] lives and still go to hell. Every hour
[1:17:36] of our lives, he says, and still go to
[1:17:38] hell. It's not something that we can
[1:17:40] just get and then we're actually going
[1:17:42] to be uh completely
[1:17:46] able to do whatever we want. We still
[1:17:49] need to follow the leadership of the
[1:17:50] Lord in our lives.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; And it's an everyday kind of thing,
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; an every hour kind of thing, a surrender
[1:17:57] unto the Lord.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:59] But the devil can't set a foot on you to
[1:18:02] hurt you until you first get away from
[1:18:04] God. You must first remember that. Check
[1:18:08] when anything happens. See if you are in
[1:18:11] the faith or not. See that if you're
[1:18:15] right up to place with God. Then
[1:18:18] remember the devil can do no harm, do
[1:18:21] you no harm, you're in Christ.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we can take a look at the life
[1:18:25] of Job and say what what happened in his
[1:18:28] life.
[1:18:30] God and Satan, they had a little wager.
[1:18:33] They had a discussion. God even said to
[1:18:36] Satan, "Have you considered my servant?
[1:18:38] Have you considered Job?"
[1:18:41] And we know that Job, he got it bad. He
[1:18:45] got it real bad.
[1:18:48] But there's something interesting.
[1:18:50] I I believe it with all my heart that in
[1:18:52] Job's life, there was a fruit,
[1:18:57] but there was also a seed.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Something inside of Job,
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; he said, "You know what? Though he slay
[1:19:04] me,
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; yet I will see him face to face."
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Something inside of him knew that God
[1:19:12] lived.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even when all of his friends, the
[1:19:16] believers, came and comforted him and
[1:19:19] reminded him that you're a secret
[1:19:20] sinner, Job,
[1:19:22] that you're you did something wrong,
[1:19:24] Job. The reason all of this is befallen
[1:19:26] you is because of what you did or you
[1:19:28] didn't do.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; And we know it took Eloh to come around
[1:19:32] and say, you know what, all of you just
[1:19:34] listen. Listen up.
[1:19:37] This is not the way that it is. It's not
[1:19:39] as you suppose. And he would know that
[1:19:40] he went and corrected all of them. But
[1:19:42] in the end, God came down and told all
[1:19:44] of his friends, "Hey, you know what? I
[1:19:47] will actually ask you, I'll tell you, go
[1:19:50] and get my servant Job to pray for you."
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Because he's a righteous man.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; And all of them were saved because of
[1:20:00] this righteous man. But all of it
[1:20:03] happened to Job because God allowed it
[1:20:05] to. It wasn't something that he did.
[1:20:07] Right.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; So, I think it's real interesting
[1:20:10] because this quote, it just drives me to
[1:20:12] that. It makes me say, you know, Brother
[1:20:13] Brandham, he says, "When anything
[1:20:14] happens, see if you are in the faith of
[1:20:16] not." And I believe that's the way every
[1:20:18] single believer is. Whenever something
[1:20:20] happens in our life, let's see if we're
[1:20:22] in the faith or not. Let's see who is on
[1:20:24] the inside of us. Are we believing the
[1:20:26] Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:20:28] today, and forever? That he is just as
[1:20:30] able to do the miracles that he's always
[1:20:32] done,
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; or not?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. or are we afraid? Do we have fear?
[1:20:38] Do we wonder? Do we worry?
[1:20:41] Or do we know who is actually in
[1:20:42] complete control all the time? Brother
[1:20:46] Rahim, he goes on to say, and and this
[1:20:48] place here
[1:20:50] a few years before this had been the
[1:20:53] prophetus Deborah and Bareric,
[1:20:57] and how that she had prophesied and told
[1:21:00] them what to do. And it was just exactly
[1:21:02] right, Bareric, the great warrior, and
[1:21:03] how they made a song of the triumph over
[1:21:06] the enemy. But as soon as they got out
[1:21:08] of the twist, right straight back into
[1:21:11] the rut,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; they went again.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Prophet for our day says, "If that isn't
[1:21:19] the picture of the church today,
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; just as soon as it gets out of one
[1:21:24] twist, right into another one, it goes."
[1:21:28] But time had come for action.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Time had come for action.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, I think if there
[1:21:36] was ever a day, ever a time that's come
[1:21:38] for action, wouldn't it be today?
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; To look around and see the handwriting
[1:21:43] that's on the wall, all you have to do
[1:21:45] is look at any any news feed and you can
[1:21:48] see that Russia's on the move. And we
[1:21:51] know Russia wasn't even Russia when the
[1:21:53] prophet in our day prophesied. It was
[1:21:54] the USSR,
[1:21:56] but he prophesied, "Watch Russia, the
[1:21:59] king of the north."
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; And Russia now is moving all over the
[1:22:03] place in the world like never before.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; We don't have to look very far. We can
[1:22:09] see that this is this is a time of
[1:22:12] action.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; This is a time to not play church. This
[1:22:15] is a time to not say that because I
[1:22:18] associate I'm saved. If we do that,
[1:22:21] we're lost.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to tell you clearly, you're
[1:22:24] not going to be saved because you come
[1:22:26] in the doors of Calgary Living Word
[1:22:28] Assembly. You're only going to be saved
[1:22:30] because you believe that Jesus Christ
[1:22:32] died and rose again for your sins.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; But to receive that in the fullness of
[1:22:39] the word for today,
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; that's next level.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Because that's going to put you in the
[1:22:44] rapture.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; But the time had come for action in this
[1:22:49] story here. And we know that even God
[1:22:52] came around and told the children of
[1:22:54] Israel, "The time has come for action,
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; right? We know that Gideon, the action
[1:23:00] that he could do was to try and do this
[1:23:02] privately, try and squirrel away just
[1:23:04] enough food for him and his family and
[1:23:07] him and his dad to scheme together to
[1:23:09] maybe hide it in a a den or a cave and a
[1:23:12] rock and just try and keep it on the
[1:23:14] lowown so that these enemies wouldn't
[1:23:16] come into the land and actually find
[1:23:18] theirs. They'd find everyone else's but
[1:23:20] maybe not their families. But God who is
[1:23:23] rich in mercy came and told them now is
[1:23:26] the time for action.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; You know when he does that many times
[1:23:30] we'll be like Moses, won't we? We'll say
[1:23:33] Lord I I I stutter. I I'm short. I'm not
[1:23:38] very smart. I don't have an education. I
[1:23:42] I don't think that I could do this. How
[1:23:44] could I ever do this? Here you have God
[1:23:47] Almighty saying you're going to do this.
[1:23:48] You're a mighty van man of valor.
[1:23:53] But if that isn't the picture of the
[1:23:55] church today,
[1:23:58] but I want to try and encourage us. You
[1:24:01] are a mighty man of valor.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; I think brother Paul said it earlier and
[1:24:08] I think it's beautiful the quote
[1:24:12] in this message.
[1:24:14] If you want to see a miracle,
[1:24:16] it's time that you be one.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; If we want to see a miracle,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; then we need to be one.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Now, how could we ever do that?
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon will say it in one of
[1:24:28] the quotes that we read later, but I'm
[1:24:29] just going to preach it because I feel
[1:24:31] so good about it. I love it when the
[1:24:33] Lord inspires us this way. But you know,
[1:24:35] brothers and sisters, if you want to be
[1:24:36] a miracle, what's the greatest miracle
[1:24:39] that a sinner could be turned into a
[1:24:41] saint? Amen.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it in this
[1:24:43] message. Take yourself and pour yourself
[1:24:46] out as an offering upon the altar and
[1:24:48] see if he won't come and touch it with
[1:24:51] his stick and consume it. And when he
[1:24:54] does that, the old man becomes consumed.
[1:24:57] And if you want to hear it, go and
[1:24:58] listen to this message. He talks about
[1:24:59] it. Well, I've got a temper like a bus.
[1:25:01] I've got such a bad temper. I just don't
[1:25:03] know what to do about it. Pour yourself
[1:25:05] out on the altar and see if he's not
[1:25:07] God. Say, God, if you're God, be God
[1:25:09] unto me.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Show me that you're God. And I
[1:25:13] guarantee you, brothers and sisters, the
[1:25:14] moment that we get genuine, the moment
[1:25:17] that we get more sincere than we've ever
[1:25:19] been in our lives, that's the moment
[1:25:21] that he will come on the scene and pour
[1:25:23] himself out in our lives like we've
[1:25:25] never even imagined possible.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; He will do it
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; because he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:25:32] and forever.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Let's not make excuses for the devil and
[1:25:36] say, "Well, it's just how I am." As soon
[1:25:38] as we do that, we're actually, I think,
[1:25:41] diminishing our faith in God. We're
[1:25:43] saying that our problems are greater
[1:25:45] than our God is.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Who wants to say that?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Today, brothers and sisters, the time
[1:25:51] for action.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Time to say that God is greater than any
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; any symptom that I can see. Any
[1:25:59] circumstance that I'll encounter, any
[1:26:02] devil, any Midianite, any Amorite, any
[1:26:05] one of these grasshoppers that would
[1:26:07] come around and try and eat my crop.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; God is greater than anyone.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; He says that's the same now. The time
[1:26:17] has come for action. And the time had
[1:26:19] come when playing church had come to a
[1:26:22] halt with God.
[1:26:24] I love how the prophet just he just
[1:26:26] brings it home. Let's just do this,
[1:26:28] right? There's no more playing church.
[1:26:30] We must get down to business.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; And I trust that same God will place
[1:26:37] this upon the heart of the people. He
[1:26:40] says, "Tonight, I say this morning that
[1:26:42] it's time
[1:26:44] for a halt in playing church,
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; playing religious,
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; playing righteous."
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Now it's time for action.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; And you know, it's said many times in
[1:26:56] this world that talk is cheap.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; We can say all we want,
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; but our lives preach who we are.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Our lives show who we are. You know,
[1:27:07] brothers and sisters, I saw a quote a
[1:27:08] little while ago and I thought it was
[1:27:10] real interesting. The word says, Brother
[1:27:12] Brandham says, not the word, the word of
[1:27:14] brother Brandham. We'll say it that way.
[1:27:15] He says, "When you're in bad company,
[1:27:19] when you're in bad company," you know
[1:27:20] who bad company is. You know it. We all
[1:27:22] know it. When you're in bad company,
[1:27:24] you're out of the will of the Lord.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; You're out of the will of the Lord. Who
[1:27:31] here by the show of a hand wants to be
[1:27:33] out of the will of the Lord this
[1:27:35] morning?
[1:27:37] Nobody wants to be out of the will of
[1:27:39] the Lord.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Nobody. We all want to be in the will of
[1:27:42] the Lord. There is a balance between
[1:27:45] hanging out with unbelievers and
[1:27:48] actually showing the light of Christ to
[1:27:50] the people who need to know it. There is
[1:27:53] a balance. And I strongly recommend let
[1:27:55] the Holy Ghost guide you in that
[1:27:57] direction.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Because they'll take you down. The
[1:28:01] devil's job is to take you down. Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; The devil's job is to erode your faith.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; You know, if we ever get caught up in
[1:28:10] looking at those websites now, people
[1:28:12] would say, "Brother Barry, oh, now
[1:28:14] you're getting crazy." I'm not talking
[1:28:16] about pornography. No, we could, but I'm
[1:28:18] not going to today. It's bad. There's
[1:28:22] nothing good about it.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; It's demonic, etc., etc. But I'll tell
[1:28:26] you, when we get into these other
[1:28:27] websites that want to try and erode our
[1:28:29] faith in the message of the hour, I
[1:28:32] would say it's equal to or worse then.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because it's a religious
[1:28:37] spirit operating it.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; And the worst spirit that could ever
[1:28:41] creep into the framework of the
[1:28:42] Christian church and cause it to become
[1:28:44] lukewarm, formal, and powerless
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; is a religious spirit. The one that's
[1:28:49] absolutely religious, man. They've got
[1:28:52] it going on according to the word.
[1:28:55] It's terrible.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; But you know what those websites are
[1:28:58] designed to do?
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; They're designed to take your faith.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; They're designed to get you to ask
[1:29:04] questions
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; and say, "Well, what about that happened
[1:29:08] on on whatever day?" What was Was
[1:29:12] William Brham actually hunting out of
[1:29:14] season?
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Would the prophet of God go and actually
[1:29:17] hunt out of season?
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; There's so many things. 16 men falling
[1:29:23] off the bridge and dying, all of these
[1:29:26] different things. Well, then they would
[1:29:27] say, "Well, where's the documentation?
[1:29:29] There has to be documentation."
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Those websites are designed to steal
[1:29:34] your faith.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; And alls it takes is a question. One
[1:29:38] question.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Leave it alone.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be like God's?
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; My
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; thou shalt not surely die.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Leave it alone.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so subtle. It's all of the word
[1:29:52] of God, isn't it? It's It's so
[1:29:54] beautiful. It's perfectly packaged. It's
[1:29:57] reasonable. This word that we're talking
[1:30:00] about is unreasonable.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; This is supernatural. You can't explain
[1:30:05] it.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; How can you take a supernatural
[1:30:08] experience of that mighty angel
[1:30:11] descending out of heaven with an open
[1:30:12] book in his hand and putting one foot on
[1:30:14] the land and one foot on the sea and
[1:30:16] raising one hand to heaven and declaring
[1:30:17] there'll be time no more. and bring that
[1:30:20] to a natural circumstance and say,
[1:30:22] "Well, he was hunting out of season."
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; How can you take those two and put them
[1:30:27] together? You can't do it.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; This is supernatural we're talking
[1:30:32] about.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; But the devil's going to say, "Well,
[1:30:35] nope. You should be able to rationalize
[1:30:37] the word of God. You should be able to
[1:30:39] understand."
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; You're not called to do that. We're not
[1:30:43] called to do that. We're only called to
[1:30:45] believe it. Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; If we have the ability to believe it,
[1:30:49] it's a gift of God. I I would say that's
[1:30:51] one of the greatest miracles that we
[1:30:53] could ever witness is the ability to
[1:30:55] believe the word for our day.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; But, you know, I love how he says this.
[1:31:00] It's not it's time is up. It's it's time
[1:31:04] to halt of playing church, playing
[1:31:06] religious, playing righteous.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; And now it's time for action.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; You know, brothers and sisters, brother
[1:31:11] Bradom has asked a question and
[1:31:12] questions and answers. What will they
[1:31:14] preach after the rapture?
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; You probably heard me say it many times.
[1:31:18] Once the church goes home, what will
[1:31:19] they preach? What that means is that
[1:31:20] there's going to be people here.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; They're still going to be having church.
[1:31:24] Brother Brandham says it. They're still
[1:31:26] going to be having altar calls and
[1:31:27] getting baptized thinking they're
[1:31:29] getting the Holy Ghost and not realizing
[1:31:30] the rapture is already gone.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be here then.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; No, we don't want to be here then.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be here then.
[1:31:43] But we have the ability now the day in
[1:31:46] which we live to make it right so that
[1:31:49] we guarantee that we won't be there
[1:31:51] then.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And it's a real simple formula.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about it in here.
[1:31:56] Just pour yourself out. Give yourself to
[1:31:58] the altar of God and ask him to consume
[1:32:01] you just like Gideon did that that
[1:32:03] offering unto the Lord. Pour yourself
[1:32:06] out. Put yourself on the on the altar
[1:32:08] and say, "Lord, be it unto me according
[1:32:10] to thy word. Touch me with your staff.
[1:32:12] Consume me with your fire. Burn that old
[1:32:14] man out.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; See if he won't do it.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know how many times in this
[1:32:20] message he says it. He is the same
[1:32:22] yesterday, today, and forever
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; in this message. If God be with us, then
[1:32:27] where is all the miracles?
[1:32:31] You know, Brother Radam, he's he's
[1:32:32] talking about this how, you know,
[1:32:34] whatever
[1:32:36] whatever you'd tell them, preacher, you
[1:32:38] could tell them to go out and and and
[1:32:39] touch a a tree and they'd be healed.
[1:32:42] Brother Brandham, he says, "No, no, no,
[1:32:44] no, no, no, no." I think the preacher
[1:32:47] was trying to say that, you know, it's
[1:32:49] actually God that does the work and
[1:32:51] whatever you tell them, they would do,
[1:32:53] and they'd still receive their healing.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam, he says, "Faith is not that
[1:32:57] loose.
[1:32:59] It ain't that loose.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Remember, we're not talking about
[1:33:02] natural faith. We're not talking about
[1:33:04] human faith. We're talking about God's
[1:33:06] own faith,
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; the faith of God, not the faith in God.
[1:33:10] All of Christianity has faith in God,
[1:33:13] but is not willing to accept the word of
[1:33:16] a vindicated prophet and get back in
[1:33:18] line with the word.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Faith is not that loose. It's got to be
[1:33:23] based upon some noted fact.
[1:33:28] And I I think it's beautiful. We all do.
[1:33:29] I know I'm preaching to the choir here,
[1:33:31] but that's what caused us to be able to
[1:33:32] believe the message of the hour. The
[1:33:34] first and second pulls of this man's
[1:33:36] ministry
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; or God's ministry through this man.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Right? The first and second pulls. The
[1:33:41] bait on the hook is what Bosworth said.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; You don't show the fish the hook. You
[1:33:46] show him the bait.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And when he's hungry, he's going to
[1:33:50] bite.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; And if you like fishing, you understand
[1:33:52] what that means.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Faith is not that loose, though. It's
[1:33:56] got to be based upon some noted fact.
[1:33:59] And God isn't going to allow us to go
[1:34:01] forwards and not see something noted in
[1:34:03] our lives.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; This is what a mighty God we serve.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; If you haven't seen a miracle in your
[1:34:11] life, just ask him to see a miracle in
[1:34:14] your life. But if you have seen a
[1:34:16] miracle in your life, you understand
[1:34:18] exactly what I'm talking about here.
[1:34:20] It's got to be based upon some noted
[1:34:22] fact. You've got to know something about
[1:34:25] what you are having faith in.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Before you can have faith in it. And and
[1:34:31] I think it's so beautiful because for
[1:34:33] the young people, this applies to you in
[1:34:36] a really big way. Mom and dad can
[1:34:38] believe in the message of the hour. They
[1:34:40] can believe that God sent a prophet.
[1:34:41] They can raise us up to believe that.
[1:34:43] But there comes a point in time where it
[1:34:44] has to become my God.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham calls it the point
[1:34:50] of accountability, doesn't it? There has
[1:34:52] to come a time where the children can
[1:34:54] see God in their very own lives. The
[1:34:57] same God their parents serve is now
[1:34:59] their God.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; It's based upon some noted fact.
[1:35:04] Something that's actually happened for
[1:35:06] me in my life.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what anybody else
[1:35:09] says. They may never have witnessed it.
[1:35:11] They may never have seen it. They may
[1:35:13] never ever in their life, but I have.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to talk us out of it
[1:35:18] then. Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; So, first we must know how and what what
[1:35:23] God's desire is, what God's plan is, and
[1:35:26] how to approach God by that plan.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Aren't you so wonderful that every
[1:35:32] single one of those statements has been
[1:35:34] fulfilled through the life of William
[1:35:36] Brham, taking us right back to the
[1:35:38] center stage of the word of God for the
[1:35:40] day in which we live.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; But many people aren't interested in
[1:35:44] that. They'll say, "Oh, it's it's
[1:35:46] hogwash." All of the churches out there,
[1:35:48] they allow women preachers. There's
[1:35:50] nothing wrong with having a female
[1:35:52] preacher.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Paul said not to do it.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; God said through Paul not to do it
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; because the woman is of the man, not the
[1:36:02] man of the woman.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; She's supposed to be in subject to the
[1:36:06] man. She's supposed to be subject to the
[1:36:08] word. She's supposed to be silent
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; in church. There's a lot that we could
[1:36:13] say there. I'm not going to go there.
[1:36:14] But you know, we first must know how and
[1:36:17] what what God's desire is, what God's
[1:36:19] plan is, and how to approach God by that
[1:36:21] plan. All we have to do is take the book
[1:36:23] and eat it up.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; When we do that, we can see what God's
[1:36:28] will is because God's will is his word.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; But unless we eat the book, how are we
[1:36:34] ever going to know what his will is?
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; And many people are beguiled because of
[1:36:39] that. They don't take the time to read
[1:36:42] the word. They don't take the time to
[1:36:44] study the message of the hour. So when
[1:36:46] you get a man that will come and preach
[1:36:48] the gospel and say things that don't
[1:36:50] line up with the word of God, it can
[1:36:52] cause them to be led astray.
[1:36:59] And when we can walk up boldly to the
[1:37:01] throne of grace and plead what the plan
[1:37:04] is promised us,
[1:37:06] I believe it's there that God will come
[1:37:09] on the scene for us in our lives
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; because he's looking for his word to be
[1:37:13] spoke back to him.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; We have a lot of ideas and things, but
[1:37:19] it doesn't matter what our thoughts are
[1:37:21] and what our opinions are. It only
[1:37:22] matters what his word says.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:26] I love how brother Brandham says this.
[1:37:27] You might have something. He says, "You
[1:37:29] you got something,
[1:37:31] but I wouldn't say just what you had
[1:37:35] till I seen what kind of fruit it
[1:37:37] growed."
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; I love how he says this.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Because it takes a little bit of time
[1:37:42] for that to happen, doesn't it?
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Many times people would say, "Well, you
[1:37:47] know, pastor, this happened and that
[1:37:48] happened and you should act on it." But
[1:37:51] I have to say, you know what? I'm I'm
[1:37:53] not going to jump.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; What I'm going to do is wait on the
[1:37:56] Lord.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; I want to see what the Lord has to say
[1:37:59] about it.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; I want to see what fruit it's going to
[1:38:02] bear.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; If it's of the Lord, then he will bless
[1:38:05] it. And that's the way it is. That's why
[1:38:07] he is the way he is.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; That's why we we trust him and we love
[1:38:11] him with our lives because he looks
[1:38:13] after us that way.
[1:38:16] You know, brother Brandham goes on.
[1:38:19] Now, we find that when God's people gets
[1:38:21] in trouble,
[1:38:23] God always sends them a prophet. Isn't
[1:38:26] that magnificent? It's so beautiful.
[1:38:29] Many times people want to have a just a
[1:38:31] deliverance. Boy, I've got money
[1:38:33] problems. So, you know what would solve
[1:38:35] my problem is just to have a big uh uh
[1:38:37] forklift land on my driveway with a skid
[1:38:41] full of money shrink wrapped hund or or
[1:38:44] Benjamin Franklin stacks of Benjamin
[1:38:46] Franklin's just solve all my problems,
[1:38:48] right? To have that money. If I could
[1:38:50] just have money because I've got
[1:38:52] financial problems. Guess what? The the
[1:38:54] money isn't the financial problem. It's
[1:38:56] the behavior with the money
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; that's the problem.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Revelation is what it takes.
[1:39:04] It takes revelation to be able to fix
[1:39:07] things in our lives, to be able to deal
[1:39:08] with things as human beings.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Now, we find that when God's people gets
[1:39:13] in trouble, God always sends them a
[1:39:15] prophet with the true word to bring them
[1:39:18] out.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; To have the word of a vindicated prophet
[1:39:22] in the day in which we live can never
[1:39:24] ever be overestimated. I think it's just
[1:39:26] so beautiful.
[1:39:28] It's never a time that God's people ever
[1:39:31] gets in trouble unless God sends them
[1:39:34] his word. And his word, as we had this
[1:39:38] morning, come in the prophets.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; And how you test it is to find out
[1:39:45] whether it's according to the word.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; If it's according to the word,
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; then God's word becomes alive.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; And isn't that why we're all here today?
[1:39:56] So that we can see God's word become
[1:39:58] alive.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; So that we can actually see that this is
[1:40:03] not just an association. It's not just a
[1:40:05] charitable organization called Calgary
[1:40:08] Living Word.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; It's actually an assembling of literally
[1:40:14] the manifested living word for the day
[1:40:16] in which we live.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; That's why it's called Calvary Living
[1:40:20] Word.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; It's such a wonderful thing.
[1:40:25] But we all must speak the same thing.
[1:40:28] Once we get some saying one way and some
[1:40:31] saying another way, then we get
[1:40:32] confusion. People don't know what to do.
[1:40:34] Right? Brother Bam says we all must
[1:40:35] speak the same thing. Then we must speak
[1:40:38] not contrary but exactly to this word.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; That's how a true prophet is tested
[1:40:46] whether he has got the word.
[1:40:49] The Bible said, "If their testimony is
[1:40:51] not according to the law and the
[1:40:52] prophets, there's no light in them."
[1:40:54] That's right. It's got to be according
[1:40:57] to the word.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; And we know that's why William Brham is
[1:41:04] the prophet for the age is because he
[1:41:07] pointed back to the word.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; He never brought his own word. He
[1:41:11] pointed back to the word. And any one of
[1:41:13] the maybe doctrines that we might talk
[1:41:15] about and say that William Brham brought
[1:41:18] the people that know William Brandham
[1:41:20] would say it's one of the mysteries that
[1:41:22] was actually made known to this age.
[1:41:24] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:41:26] Sir, is this the time of the end? Those
[1:41:28] messages talk about these mysteries.
[1:41:30] We're not going to talk about the
[1:41:31] mysteries today. But what I'm saying is
[1:41:34] this prophet took every one of those
[1:41:36] back to the word of God.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; And said, "Here it is right here. There
[1:41:41] it is right there. Every single one of
[1:41:43] them. He didn't bring anything new.
[1:41:47] If their testimony is not according to
[1:41:49] the law and the prophets, saying what
[1:41:51] the word said, saying what the prophets
[1:41:54] already said, then it's wrong, right?
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; There's no light in them. He says that's
[1:41:59] right. It's got to be according to the
[1:42:02] word. And you know sometimes you hear in
[1:42:04] the day even today in which we live
[1:42:06] there's some folks they get their own
[1:42:08] revelation and you can't talk them out
[1:42:10] of it because you never talked them into
[1:42:12] it. Someone else did but you know what
[1:42:14] it's okay it has to be that way. It's
[1:42:15] the way it is. He goes on to say and God
[1:42:18] always in every case not in most cases
[1:42:24] sends the people a true servant a true
[1:42:26] prophet that will bring the word of God.
[1:42:29] And the word of God is what delivers the
[1:42:30] people always. Now, if we go back into
[1:42:32] our scripture here and look at this
[1:42:36] in verse 7 of Judges chapter 6, and it
[1:42:40] came to pass when the children of Israel
[1:42:42] cried unto the Lord because of the
[1:42:43] Midianites, because of their troubles
[1:42:45] and their and their trials and their
[1:42:47] tribulations, they start to cry out
[1:42:49] again. Many times, that's the life of a
[1:42:51] believer. We get ourselves off track and
[1:42:53] then we start to cry out to God. And I'm
[1:42:55] speaking from experience. I'm not
[1:42:57] speaking about anybody. I'm speaking
[1:42:58] about Brother Barry here. Sometimes I'll
[1:43:01] get off track and I'll start to cry out
[1:43:03] to God and what will he do? He'll take
[1:43:05] me right back to the prophet.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Take me right back to the message of the
[1:43:10] hour. Isn't it wonderful how he does
[1:43:11] that?
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. In verse 8, it says that the Lord
[1:43:15] sent a prophet unto the children of
[1:43:18] Israel, which said unto them, thus saith
[1:43:20] the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up
[1:43:22] from Egypt, and brought you forth out of
[1:43:24] the house of bondage. And I delivered
[1:43:26] you out of the hand of the Egyptians,
[1:43:28] and out of the hand that oppressed you,
[1:43:30] and drove them out from before you, and
[1:43:32] gave you their land. And I said unto
[1:43:34] you, I am the Lord your God. Fear not
[1:43:36] the gods of the Amorites in whose land
[1:43:39] you dwell, but she have not obeyed my
[1:43:43] voice.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Interesting because no doubt there was
[1:43:48] people in the land that said, "Well,
[1:43:50] your voice, who are you? We don't even
[1:43:52] know where you came from. We don't even
[1:43:54] know what your name is. We don't even
[1:43:57] know you. Who are you?"
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham, he talks about
[1:44:01] this. Who was that prophet? There's no
[1:44:03] identification for this prophet. He
[1:44:06] doesn't fit any of the names of the
[1:44:08] major prophets. He was a minor prophet.
[1:44:11] There's still minor prophets.
[1:44:13] That's a real thing. That's part of the
[1:44:15] church. But I think it's interesting
[1:44:17] because this man said, "You have not
[1:44:20] obeyed my voice." Now, many people will
[1:44:23] say, "Yeah, that's exactly right. And it
[1:44:25] never will obey your voice because you
[1:44:27] are a man."
[1:44:29] [laughter]
[1:44:30] But it's not the man's voice that we're
[1:44:33] listening to, is it?
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. If anybody is looking to obey
[1:44:37] William Miam Brham, I want to say think
[1:44:39] again.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Obey the word of the Lord through
[1:44:43] William Marryiam Brham.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; William Mryiam Brham was not the Lord.
[1:44:47] He was even asked that question. Are you
[1:44:49] the one? Are you Jesus Christ? He said,
[1:44:53] "No, I'm not.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; I'm your brother."
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Interesting. Interesting that a prophet
[1:45:00] I I just find this interesting as a
[1:45:02] pastor myself. I just this is for free
[1:45:04] from brother Barry from my heart my
[1:45:06] heart to yours. find it interesting how
[1:45:08] people they want that title pastor
[1:45:09] pastor pastor there's people that want
[1:45:12] the title whatever the title is teacher
[1:45:14] teacher teacher they want the titles
[1:45:17] why do they want them considering the
[1:45:19] prophet the major prophet that was in
[1:45:22] our day he said just call me brother
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; goes on to say and there came out of
[1:45:32] nowhere
[1:45:34] don't even give his name
[1:45:37] I don't guess the prophet was interested
[1:45:39] in his name.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; He was interested in one thing. God had
[1:45:44] anointed him.
[1:45:47] He didn't make any difference whether he
[1:45:50] [laughter]
[1:45:51] whether he was classed one of their
[1:45:53] denominations or something else. Whe
[1:45:56] whether he was a bishop or an
[1:45:58] archbishop, the only thing that he was
[1:46:00] interested in was that message on his
[1:46:04] heart. Aren't you thankful that we had a
[1:46:07] prophet like that in the day in which we
[1:46:09] lived?
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; That was the only thing he was
[1:46:12] interested in
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; was the message that God gave him on his
[1:46:16] heart.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Of course, he cared about other things.
[1:46:19] He cared about other people, but most of
[1:46:21] all, he cared about the word of God and
[1:46:24] making sure that he brought it according
[1:46:26] to what God revealed to him
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; already in the word.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; He didn't bring a new word.
[1:46:32] But Adam Bam says, "The enemy speaks
[1:46:34] today. The enemy tries to say that the
[1:46:36] days of miracles is passed. And you
[1:46:39] know, as I study this, I think it's
[1:46:40] wonderful. I I just want to try and
[1:46:43] bring it to the the right here and now.
[1:46:45] So, we look at this and and recognize
[1:46:47] that he is the same yesterday, today,
[1:46:49] and forever. But the devil will take us,
[1:46:52] one of the biggest tricks I find in my
[1:46:54] life is the devil will take me and say,
[1:46:55] "Well, look what you did yesterday. Look
[1:46:57] at this here. You did this and this and
[1:46:59] this." Don't expect a miracle.
[1:47:01] Don't don't think that God's going to do
[1:47:03] anything for you because of what you've
[1:47:05] done. Don't think that God's going to do
[1:47:06] anything for you because of what you've
[1:47:08] thought. Don't think that God's going to
[1:47:10] do anything for you because of what you
[1:47:11] haven't done or thought.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; That's all irrelevant. It's the devil.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:47:19] forever. Alls we've got to do is line up
[1:47:21] with his word, pour ourselves out
[1:47:24] genuinely on his altar, and allow him to
[1:47:27] do the work. Amen.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; But the enemy speaks today. The enemy
[1:47:31] tries to say that the days of miracles
[1:47:33] is passed. And and this is why I'm
[1:47:35] saying this, brothers and sisters. Some
[1:47:36] people would say, well, you know, in
[1:47:37] denominational ranks, the days of
[1:47:39] miracles has passed. But let's bring it
[1:47:41] down home. Let's say it right here and
[1:47:43] now in this assembly with people here.
[1:47:45] There's probably people here that maybe
[1:47:47] think the same way that I was thinking
[1:47:49] that, you know what I've done? There's
[1:47:50] no way that God's going to do a miracle
[1:47:51] for me. I'll say this. If you can get
[1:47:54] right with God, there's no way that God
[1:47:55] is not going to do a miracle for you
[1:47:57] because that's his will. That's his
[1:47:59] word.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as the baptism of
[1:48:03] the Holy Spirit. And some people want to
[1:48:05] say, "Oh, brother, you just go on about
[1:48:07] the Holy Spirit." There's nothing more
[1:48:09] to talk about than the Holy Spirit. If
[1:48:12] we don't get the Holy Spirit, we're
[1:48:13] going into the tribulation,
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; And maybe some of the elders are good.
[1:48:18] They've got the Holy Ghost or they don't
[1:48:19] got the Holy Ghost. They just don't want
[1:48:20] to hear about it anymore. That's okay.
[1:48:22] There's young people that need to be
[1:48:24] saved by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:26] so they can go in the rapture.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Some people will say this is only a
[1:48:32] motion. It's only a a workup.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; So the enemy has challenged and his
[1:48:38] challenge must be met.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; I love this. Brother Brandham talking
[1:48:42] about it's a time for action.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Let's see some action in our lives,
[1:48:46] brothers and sisters. Let's not do the
[1:48:47] the death marks. Let's not do what we
[1:48:50] did in 2025 where we just keep marching
[1:48:52] around the same way over and over again
[1:48:55] hoping for a different m different
[1:48:57] answer. Let's do something different.
[1:48:59] Sometimes you only need to do one little
[1:49:01] thing in your life, just a little bit
[1:49:03] different.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; And let the Holy Ghost tell you what
[1:49:05] that is. Don't let brother Barry tell
[1:49:06] you what that is. Don't let a deacon
[1:49:08] tell you what that is.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost tell you what that
[1:49:12] is.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Because then it will be right.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; It's only an emotion. It's only a
[1:49:18] workup.
[1:49:20] Oh my. So many times I think that's the
[1:49:22] way it is when it comes to worship.
[1:49:24] Oh, it's just a workup. It's just an
[1:49:26] emotion. You know, Brother Bam says that
[1:49:28] where there's no emotion in your
[1:49:30] religion, that that means it's dead
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; and you should take it out and bury it
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; and you should get another one.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; We've got to have a motion. I I think
[1:49:42] it's so beautiful. I think it was last
[1:49:43] Sunday. Was it last Sunday? When was
[1:49:45] that? I don't know when it was. It was
[1:49:47] very recently. Maybe it was. Oh, it was
[1:49:49] New Year's Eve. Yeah, we had such a
[1:49:51] wonderful time, man. So good here. But
[1:49:54] you know, we ought to be just as
[1:49:56] exuberant in here as they are out there.
[1:49:59] Now, some people might have never gone
[1:50:00] to a hockey game. Maybe you should just
[1:50:03] look it up on YouTube, NHL hockey, and
[1:50:06] see the way the crowd reacts. Don't
[1:50:08] think for a second that the prophet of
[1:50:10] God didn't see that.
[1:50:13] Some people would say, "Well, that's a
[1:50:15] stretch, Brother Barry." Maybe it is. He
[1:50:17] was a prophet. He was storing up food
[1:50:20] for a season. Don't think that he didn't
[1:50:22] see an NFL game. Don't think that maybe
[1:50:24] he didn't see what the what the halftime
[1:50:27] show looked like
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; right
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; at the Super Bowl and how excited people
[1:50:32] got.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; He looked at people in sports arenas and
[1:50:36] said, "We ought to be just as exuberant
[1:50:38] as they are."
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:42] But many times we'll say it's just our
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; culture.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; It's just the way we are. What culture
[1:50:50] do we have?
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; I want to say to us, brothers and
[1:50:53] sisters, we ought to have his culture.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; No boundaries.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; It's got to be his culture.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Some say it's only emotion. It's only a
[1:51:03] workup. So the enemy has challenged and
[1:51:06] his challenge must be met. And remember
[1:51:09] brothers and sisters, he's not going to
[1:51:10] send an army of angels to meet his
[1:51:12] challenge because the spirit of God says
[1:51:13] that when the sorry the word says that
[1:51:16] when the enemy comes in like a flood,
[1:51:18] right?
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God raises up a standard
[1:51:21] against it. And we know that if there
[1:51:22] was ever a time where the enemy has come
[1:51:24] in like a flood in this age where the
[1:51:26] lid of hell was pulled off and what was
[1:51:28] it? A 100,000,000
[1:51:30] demons have been released upon this
[1:51:32] earth. All of hell has been turned loose
[1:51:34] on this earth and all of hell has its
[1:51:38] sights trained on the bride of Jesus
[1:51:40] Christ. It's already dealing with the
[1:51:42] church and maybe messing with them. But
[1:51:44] as long as the church of the living God
[1:51:47] doesn't fully recognize what it is, the
[1:51:50] rapture is not going to go. But when it
[1:51:52] recognizes what it is, then the rapture
[1:51:54] is gone. Then it's going to go.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Such a beautiful thing to realize it.
[1:52:00] The only way we can meet the challenge
[1:52:02] of the day, brothers and sisters, when
[1:52:04] denominations call people away and put
[1:52:06] them in this organization, that
[1:52:08] organization, let the women cut their
[1:52:11] hair and wear makeup and men all kinds
[1:52:14] of lives, live as trustees and deacons
[1:52:16] and pastors in the church because they
[1:52:19] got some PhD or LLD
[1:52:22] is the requirement.
[1:52:24] Jesus never did require a man to have
[1:52:26] that.
[1:52:28] Jesus requirement,
[1:52:30] oh, I love this, was wait in that city.
[1:52:34] Hey,
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; wait in the city of Jerusalem until
[1:52:37] you're endued with power from on high.
[1:52:40] And what was that?
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Go and wait until you've got the baptism
[1:52:44] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Then
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; you could go and preach this gospel.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yes.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Then you're a witness of me.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's pretty powerful,
[1:52:57] brothers and sisters, right there. We
[1:52:59] can hover there for a second. There's
[1:53:01] many witnesses,
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; But here we have him saying, "Until
[1:53:06] you've got the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:07] Ghost, you're not a witness of me."
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to say this is what the
[1:53:13] prophet meant. I'm going to say, "That's
[1:53:14] what he said."
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Once you get the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:17] Ghost, then you're a witness of me.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; That meets the enemy's challenge. We
[1:53:23] know the devil knows. He knows whether
[1:53:26] you've got the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:27] Ghost. He knows whether you poured
[1:53:28] yourself out honestly and earnestly on
[1:53:31] the altar before God and said, "Consume
[1:53:33] me with your fire just like you did with
[1:53:36] Gideon's offering."
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; God knows it and the devil knows it.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; And we know it, too.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; And as soon as we do it, he's not going
[1:53:46] to leave us or forsake us. He's going to
[1:53:48] come on the scene for us. Wait, wait in
[1:53:50] the city of Jerusalem till you're endure
[1:53:52] with power from on high and then you're
[1:53:53] a witness of me. That meets his
[1:53:55] challenge. That meets the challenge of
[1:53:57] the devil where he's going to come
[1:53:58] around and say, "You don't got it.
[1:53:59] Forget about miracles. You're not going
[1:54:01] to see miracles in your life. Why would
[1:54:02] you see miracles in your life? Don't you
[1:54:04] know what you've done? Don't you know
[1:54:06] what you've thought? Don't you know who
[1:54:08] I think you are?"
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; He's going to say, "Don't you know who
[1:54:12] you are?" But if you know who you are,
[1:54:15] then you'll know that you can be singing
[1:54:16] that song. I'm so glad that I can say
[1:54:18] I'm one of them. Amen.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not one of those skunks that the
[1:54:21] devil comes around and tries to lead
[1:54:23] around by by the nose with a ring in
[1:54:26] their nose like a bull who is who is
[1:54:28] just going to be led to the slaughter.
[1:54:30] No, I'm a son and daughter of God.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; I know who I am and what I'm raised up
[1:54:36] for.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; It's to meet his challenge.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; God's going to meet his challenge
[1:54:42] through human beings.
[1:54:45] We've heard it said before in the past
[1:54:47] that God's going to send a spanking to
[1:54:49] the devil
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; and he's going to use his bride to do
[1:54:51] it.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; How's he going to do that? His
[1:54:54] temptation ain't going to work on her.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; It did for a time.
[1:54:59] I know we could all say this. Every one
[1:55:02] of us as believers of this message, you
[1:55:04] know, I know that I'm not who I want to
[1:55:06] be, but I can sure look back and say,
[1:55:07] "Thanks be to God. I'm not who I used to
[1:55:10] be.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; I am not that old man."
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:14] I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; He said that meets his challenge. That
[1:55:20] met the enemy's challenge. That met it
[1:55:22] in that day. It will meet it in this
[1:55:24] day.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; It will meet it in this day. Pour
[1:55:27] yourself out and see if God won't accept
[1:55:30] you as an offering. But the only way
[1:55:32] it's going to be accepted, brothers and
[1:55:34] sisters, is to pour it all out.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; The trouble with us as human beings is
[1:55:38] we get pride in our lives and we say,
[1:55:40] "Well, I'll pour it out, but except for
[1:55:42] this part here. I'm going to save this
[1:55:43] part because that part is too personal
[1:55:45] or that part hurts too much or the
[1:55:47] other. There's always an excuse. I say
[1:55:50] get rid of the excuses. It's time for
[1:55:51] action today. Let's just pour ourselves
[1:55:53] all the way out and see if he won't come
[1:55:55] as a consuming fire and accept us the
[1:55:58] way that he's invited us.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; That met in that day, it will meet it in
[1:56:04] this day. Glory to God. I love that.
[1:56:06] That's a prophetic utterance from God.
[1:56:08] It met it in that day and it will meet
[1:56:10] it in this day. Amen.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; That's why we preach what the prophet
[1:56:14] said,
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; exactly what he said.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "Now I want you to
[1:56:19] notice in 7 to 10 verse 7 to verse 10,
[1:56:23] we see the prophet coming. We see the
[1:56:26] people falling away." And from 7 to 10,
[1:56:29] we see the prophet coming and giving the
[1:56:30] people the remedy.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; God always uses a prophet.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; God only sends his word to the prophet.
[1:56:39] God only comes to the prophet.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:56:45] forever.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Did John [clears throat] the Baptist go
[1:56:47] out looking for Jesus when Jesus the
[1:56:49] word being made flesh and dwelling among
[1:56:52] us?
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Did John the Baptist go through the land
[1:56:55] searching out for the Messiah? No. He
[1:56:58] simply declared who he was.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy to loose the latchets of
[1:57:03] his shoes,
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; but his fan is in his hand. and he'll
[1:57:08] thoroughly purge the floor.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; And we know that word came and met him
[1:57:14] in the river.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; The word always comes to the prophet.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; And we know that John said, "Oh man, I
[1:57:22] recognize who this is. I'm not worthy. I
[1:57:25] I need to be baptized by by you." And he
[1:57:28] said, "You know what? Let's let's not
[1:57:30] hold back, John. Let's let's fulfill all
[1:57:33] scripture.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; The sacrifice needs to be washed. go
[1:57:37] ahead and baptize me. And we know that.
[1:57:39] We know the story.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom, he says, "Now, I want
[1:57:42] you to notice in 7:10, we see the
[1:57:44] prophet coming. We see the people
[1:57:45] falling away. And and we see the prophet
[1:57:48] coming and giving the people the
[1:57:49] remedy." Notice we don't know where he
[1:57:52] came from. He never said there was a
[1:57:54] man, a Pharisee, who had been a priest
[1:57:56] for a while and never give his
[1:57:58] backgrounds.
[1:58:00] Them prophets, they raise up from
[1:58:02] nowhere. [laughter]
[1:58:04] That's so beautiful. I love that they
[1:58:06] do. They're not interested in an
[1:58:09] identity. They're not interested in a
[1:58:10] badge. They don't need a title.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; What we need to do is just know what we
[1:58:15] need for a badge or a title is Mrs.
[1:58:18] Jesus Christ.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; The bride needs to take her husband's
[1:58:23] name. Amen.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; And you know, it's no accident that in
[1:58:26] this world that we live in, many times
[1:58:29] we see the the women being the stronger
[1:58:31] one and saying, "My husband's going to
[1:58:33] take my name."
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Or better yet, we're going to keep
[1:58:36] separate names.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; That's not the way it was supposed to be
[1:58:40] from the beginning.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; It's a perversion of the devil. That's
[1:58:47] what that is.
[1:58:49] And here comes that prophet out for that
[1:58:51] hour and gave them the word of the Lord.
[1:58:53] Remember, he never give them some
[1:58:55] man-made theology. He said, "I am the
[1:58:58] Lord that brought you out of Egypt."
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Remember, they actually had something to
[1:59:04] base it on. He was taking them back to a
[1:59:07] factual event where they could look back
[1:59:10] and say that God was truly God. With a
[1:59:14] mighty hand, he delivered us from the
[1:59:16] bondage that we were under.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; And we know that. But why has he
[1:59:21] forsaken us? The prophet said, "Get back
[1:59:24] in line.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Get back in line with God.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Tear down those altars. Cut down those
[1:59:31] groves. Get rid of all of those idols
[1:59:35] and follow the Lord."
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; But he never gave them some man-made
[1:59:38] theology. He said, "I am the Lord that
[1:59:40] brought you out of Egypt." Showed my
[1:59:42] mighty hand, showed my power. I'd
[1:59:44] imagine Gideon was sitting right there
[1:59:46] listening at him, saying, "Wow, this is
[1:59:49] incredible. I am the God that did these
[1:59:52] things, and I've done all this for you,
[1:59:54] and yet you've not obeyed my
[1:59:57] commandments. In all this, you have not
[2:00:01] done it."
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Wow. So, where were those people? As I
[2:00:05] was studying this, I just help can't
[2:00:07] help but think about it. Where were
[2:00:08] those people at? What were they
[2:00:09] thinking?
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Where was their heart?
[2:00:14] I can see that Gideon's heart was
[2:00:16] stirred.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; His heart was stirred up because the
[2:00:19] very next scripture talks about the
[2:00:21] angel of the Lord coming to him.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Gideon was sitting right there listening
[2:00:26] at him.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Why? Now, I want you to notice another
[2:00:30] thing that might encourage you. And I
[2:00:33] just thought this was so rich and so
[2:00:34] good. That's why I wanted to get in
[2:00:36] here, brothers and sisters. this this
[2:00:38] one thing that might encourage you
[2:00:42] prophet of God for the day in which we
[2:00:43] live. It might encourage you.
[2:00:46] Immediately after that prophet's
[2:00:48] message, the Lord appeared on the scene.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Immediately after that prophet's
[2:00:55] message, the Lord appeared on the scene.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:01:03] forever. Amen.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Let's not be stuck following William
[2:01:06] Mary and Brham.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Let's move on into Christ.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Because William Mary and Brham brought
[2:01:12] us a message to take us and put us right
[2:01:15] into Christ.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; And if we stay stuck with William Brham,
[2:01:19] we're actually going to miss what this
[2:01:21] message is all about.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; We know even today there's still people
[2:01:25] who follow John the Baptist teachings.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; There's still followers of John.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; There's been a couple more prophets,
[2:01:33] hasn't there?
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; The word always comes to the prophet.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; We've been given the ability to
[2:01:38] recognize, brothers and sisters, and I
[2:01:40] hope we recognize it. I hope we
[2:01:42] understand this is a time for action.
[2:01:44] This is a call to action. I want you to
[2:01:46] notice another thing that might
[2:01:47] encourage you. Immediately after that
[2:01:49] prophet's message, he's the same
[2:01:50] yesterday, today, forever. Immediately
[2:01:52] after this prophet's message,
[2:01:55] the Lord appeared on the scene.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we know most people are
[2:02:00] looking for the 60-foot Jesus,
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; the cataclysmic ending of the world, the
[2:02:05] disappearance of all these people.
[2:02:07] That's what they're looking for.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; When we hear the word rapture
[2:02:12] without realizing that that word rapture
[2:02:14] is actually taking us to a higher place,
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; right
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; in our characters
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; first.
[2:02:21] It's an open door in heaven
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; to see that there's one God
[2:02:27] in three offices. [snorts]
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; We know that John the Bapt John the
[2:02:31] Revelator was called a little higher. He
[2:02:33] saw a door open in heaven. And what did
[2:02:35] he see? His very first sight was one
[2:02:39] seated on the throne.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he see three?
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice another thing that
[2:02:45] might encourage you. Immediately after
[2:02:47] that prophet's message, the Lord
[2:02:49] appeared on the scene. Amen. As soon as
[2:02:51] he gave his message, the Lord appeared
[2:02:54] under a tree. The Lord came after the
[2:02:58] message of the prophet sitting under a
[2:03:00] tree. The prophet gave the people. The
[2:03:04] prophet gave the people fell away, got
[2:03:07] off on their isms. God sent his prophet.
[2:03:12] Soon as the prophet got through with his
[2:03:14] message, the Lord followed the prophet's
[2:03:17] message for deliverance. Amen.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; It's it's a time to call for action,
[2:03:22] brothers and sisters.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; The prophet has come and delivered his
[2:03:26] message.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Many times people will say, "Well,
[2:03:29] where's the Lord then?"
[2:03:31] I want to say, "Go look in the mirror."
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; You got the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:03:36] Go look in the mirror.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Where's the Lord today? Hey, if the Lord
[2:03:40] be with us, then where's all the
[2:03:42] miracles? Go look in the mirror.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Are you a new creature in Christ Jesus?
[2:03:46] Go look in the mirror. Where is the
[2:03:49] Lord?
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; My
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, we're living in a grand
[2:03:58] time." Immediately when the prophet went
[2:03:59] off the scene, what happened?
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; The Lord came on the scene.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; We know that John the Baptist said,
[2:04:06] "Hey, oh my, if this is him, who I think
[2:04:10] it is, then I must decrease. Amen.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; I I must go off the scene
[2:04:16] so that he can come on the scene so that
[2:04:18] he can increase.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Same thing that William Mary and
[2:04:21] Brandham said, ain't it? Isn't it what
[2:04:22] he said?
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; There won't be two of us standing here
[2:04:26] at the same time, sir. This is the time
[2:04:28] of the end.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; If if what's happening is what I think
[2:04:31] is happening, then I must decrease
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; so that he must increase.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; But where is he going to increase?
[2:04:38] Brothers and sisters, the whole world is
[2:04:41] looking for a man, Jesus Christ, to be
[2:04:43] walking around on earth, the Messiah.
[2:04:46] And sure enough, one day he will be. But
[2:04:48] until that time, he's chosen a bride
[2:04:51] body.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Hasn't he?
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Let's not take it and make it some sort
[2:04:55] of church thing where we say that it's
[2:04:57] the bride body is just a church group of
[2:04:59] people and and it's an exclusive elite
[2:05:02] group of people in the world today. Even
[2:05:05] though she is,
[2:05:07] but she's literally his hands.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Literally his feet.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Literally his eyes, ears, and nose.
[2:05:14] Literally his heart beating. Literally
[2:05:17] his blood flowing. Oh, I can say I'm so
[2:05:20] glad. I can say I'm one of them. Yes.
[2:05:22] Yes. I'm a child of the king. His royal
[2:05:25] blood flows through whose veins?
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; My veins. Because he's made it so real
[2:05:30] to me. Doesn't matter what anybody else
[2:05:33] says.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're living in a grand time.
[2:05:38] Immediately when the prophet went off
[2:05:39] the scene, what happened? The Lord came
[2:05:41] on the scene.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Doesn't say the Lord went off the scene.
[2:05:45] Doesn't say the Lord took his people and
[2:05:47] went off the scene. No, the Lord came on
[2:05:50] the scene.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; If the Lord be with us, then where's all
[2:05:54] the miracles?
[2:05:56] I can tell you I've seen some pretty
[2:05:58] amazing miracles and I know that you
[2:06:01] have too. You've seen you have witnessed
[2:06:03] some pretty amazing miracles that only
[2:06:05] God could do.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Not man. No coincidence.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Only God could do the miracles that we
[2:06:12] have seen with our eyes and witnessed
[2:06:14] with our lives. He says the Lord came on
[2:06:17] the scene. As soon as John went off the
[2:06:19] scene, the Lord came on the scene. Very
[2:06:21] strange how God works.
[2:06:24] I love the way he says this because it's
[2:06:25] in a mystery form. He doesn't say, "Now
[2:06:27] watch after I go off the scene."
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Does he?
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Never one time does he say, "Look to me.
[2:06:33] I'm God's prophet." He said, "You called
[2:06:35] me God's prophet."
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he'll say, "Now, as God's
[2:06:39] prophet, do you believe?" But he never
[2:06:41] one time boasts that he's God's prophet.
[2:06:45] [cough and clears throat]
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; As soon as John went off the scene, the
[2:06:48] Lord came on the scene. Very strange how
[2:06:50] God works, but he does it. He works in a
[2:06:53] mysterious way.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; And Gideon asked that question. What a
[2:06:58] scriptural man that was. That's the kind
[2:07:00] of man that God comes to. Somebody who
[2:07:02] knows. Gideon said, "If God is with us,
[2:07:04] if you are the messenger, then where is
[2:07:06] the miracles that the prophet told us
[2:07:08] about?" He knowed everywhere God went,
[2:07:10] his miracles followed him. He knowed
[2:07:12] that wherever God would be, miracles
[2:07:15] would be there.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; I love how he says this. And how how can
[2:07:23] you expect God today to work in amongst
[2:07:26] people who doesn't even believe in
[2:07:28] miracles? How could it be? So, brothers
[2:07:30] and sisters, I know we believe that God
[2:07:32] does miracles, but what I think the Lord
[2:07:34] was trying to show me is that maybe we
[2:07:36] believe that God does miracles in other
[2:07:37] people because they're just a little
[2:07:39] better.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; They're just a little more saved. They
[2:07:42] they've they've maybe got a little more
[2:07:44] experience. You know, I had a brother
[2:07:46] one time, an elder brother. I was part
[2:07:47] of a a Zoom call. We would study on
[2:07:49] Fridays the word. heard in a younger
[2:07:51] minister. He said, "You know about
[2:07:53] something about the revelation that you
[2:07:55] would have to an elder minister, someone
[2:07:56] who was a hory head, been in the
[2:07:59] ministry for 40 years." And you know
[2:08:00] what that minister said? He said, "This
[2:08:02] the revelation that I get is exactly the
[2:08:04] same revelation as you get.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; It's just as valuable. Don't think that
[2:08:07] God gives me a greater revelation that
[2:08:09] he gives you." I thought that was the
[2:08:11] most profound thing that I'd heard in a
[2:08:12] long time. If we get revelation, it's a
[2:08:14] gift from God, brothers and sisters.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all that I want to do today is
[2:08:19] try and encourage us to recognize the
[2:08:20] devil's going to say that we have done
[2:08:22] something. We have thought something.
[2:08:24] All of these different things are going
[2:08:26] to get in the way of God being God.
[2:08:27] Nothing is going to get in the way from
[2:08:29] God being God. The only thing that we've
[2:08:31] got to do is submit ourselves therefore
[2:08:33] unto God and resist the devil and he
[2:08:36] will flee from us.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a good way to trust whether
[2:08:42] the messenger is right or not. If he has
[2:08:44] the form of godliness,
[2:08:48] he will deny that power to do those
[2:08:50] miracles.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Someone that will say, "Wow, yeah, look
[2:08:56] at brother so and so. He's got the
[2:08:57] ability to do this." And he'll say,
[2:09:01] "Yeah,
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; what brother Brandham is saying is that
[2:09:05] man will say, "Nope, it ain't me.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; It's 100% God.
[2:09:10] Don't you dare say that it's me because
[2:09:12] as soon as you do that, you make me
[2:09:13] antichrist.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a good way to trust whether
[2:09:17] the messenger is right or not. If he has
[2:09:19] the form of godliness, he will deny that
[2:09:23] power to do those miracles. If he is a
[2:09:26] messenger from God, he will not only
[2:09:28] speak of it, but he'll have it
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; to produce it and to show that God show
[2:09:34] that the God that he talks about is in
[2:09:36] him and with him. Hallelujah.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; My I just love these quotes. I hope it's
[2:09:41] okay. I He goes on to say, he said, "If
[2:09:44] it was God with us, where is all his
[2:09:47] mighty miracles?"
[2:09:49] Listen how scriptural Gideon was. And
[2:09:51] otherwise, he said, "If we understand
[2:09:53] that God is a great God of mighty
[2:09:55] workings, he's a great God of miracles."
[2:09:58] Amen.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; And and if he is for us and if he is
[2:10:02] with us and he is the same yesterday,
[2:10:05] today, and forever, where can I see his
[2:10:07] miracles?
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Where can I see this God in action?
[2:10:11] Where is he at?
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; If he is for us,
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; the mighty man of valor could refer back
[2:10:19] to the old word
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; and and know it's right because he
[2:10:23] knowed this that God is a supernatural
[2:10:26] being. And wherever a supernatural being
[2:10:28] is, he'll do supernatural signs because
[2:10:31] the supernatural is in him. You just
[2:10:34] can't get out of it. And how can you
[2:10:36] stand in the face of a wind without
[2:10:38] having wind blowing?
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; How can you stand how can you get in
[2:10:42] water without being wet?
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Water is wet. That's the chemical of it.
[2:10:48] It's wet. And when you get in water,
[2:10:50] you're going to get wet, right? And when
[2:10:52] you get in the presence of God, the
[2:10:54] supernatural, there is going to be
[2:10:56] supernatural signs and a supernatural
[2:10:59] workings of a supernatural God.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Therefore, he said, where is the
[2:11:06] working? Where is the miracles if God be
[2:11:08] with us? Glory. That's it. See, where
[2:11:10] God is, miracles are
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; where God is, the sign of God is there.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'll call the musicians
[2:11:19] this morning.
[2:11:21] He says how scriptural that is. For
[2:11:24] where the supernatural is, God and his
[2:11:27] sign would be with him.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Where God is, the sign of God is with
[2:11:33] God. We know that if he is in his
[2:11:35] people, they will do his signs
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; just exactly.
[2:11:43] Brothers and sisters, maybe we've all
[2:11:45] seen his signs and we all have his signs
[2:11:47] and all the wonders are happening. Maybe
[2:11:49] for some of us they're not. I feel like
[2:11:52] for some of us maybe they're not.
[2:11:54] Sometimes the devil will come and try
[2:11:55] and confuse us and make us think or even
[2:11:58] believe that we're not worthy. We don't
[2:12:00] deserve.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Tell the devil he's a liar.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Tell the devil he's a liar and kick him
[2:12:07] out.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; And tell him, "Let every word of man be
[2:12:12] a lie,
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; but God's word be true."
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:21] Maybe stand with me as we close this
[2:12:22] morning.
[2:12:24] He said that could be easily said
[2:12:26] tonight amongst our churches. Where is
[2:12:28] that God that once lived? Did he die? Is
[2:12:30] he gone? Is he pursuing? Is he off on a
[2:12:32] trip? No, sir. He's the same yesterday,
[2:12:36] today, and forever.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; And if we say we are of God, then let's
[2:12:39] see where God is.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Let's see the signs of God. If this
[2:12:44] tabernacle stands for God, let's see God
[2:12:46] move among us.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Let's see souls being born in the
[2:12:51] kingdom. Let's see lives being
[2:12:53] straightened up. Let's see the sick and
[2:12:55] the blind and the deaf. Let's see his
[2:12:57] mighty works being performed. God in our
[2:12:59] midst. If God before us, where is his
[2:13:02] miracles at? He asked the question. Now,
[2:13:05] if God is with his people and in his
[2:13:08] people, that person cannot help but do
[2:13:11] the same thing that God did. Amen.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Because it's not that person anymore.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying, brothers and
[2:13:18] sisters. The bride body of Christ,
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; it's not that person anymore.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; And don't think that we just come to
[2:13:25] church and suddenly we're a different
[2:13:26] person and then we go home and we're a
[2:13:28] different person. No. The word of God
[2:13:29] says that a double-minded man is
[2:13:31] unstable in all of his ways.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; The word says, "Let this mind that was
[2:13:38] in who?" Christ be in you.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Become a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[2:13:46] Pour yourself out on the altars,
[2:13:47] brothers and sisters.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; It's not the person anymore. It's God in
[2:13:51] the man.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; If the man sins, then God is not in
[2:13:56] there. If he loves the world, then God
[2:13:58] is not in there. And we know that God
[2:14:00] has no dealings with sin.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll give you a scripture for this
[2:14:03] in a moment. You can hear it when you go
[2:14:05] and listen to this message.
[2:14:08] I got so many more quotes. I'm not going
[2:14:10] to read all of them. I just want to say
[2:14:12] this. I'll I'll leave you with this,
[2:14:13] brothers and sisters. If you want if you
[2:14:16] want to see a miracle,
[2:14:19] take a look in the mirror.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; And recognize that you yourself are a
[2:14:24] miracle.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Once you have that revelation that you
[2:14:28] are a miracle,
[2:14:30] then you'll see miracles.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; When we can recognize it, we're not
[2:14:34] going to see miracles until we become a
[2:14:36] miracle. Amen.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Paul said that this morning.
[2:14:42] We're not going to be we're not going to
[2:14:43] see miracles in our life. If you want to
[2:14:45] see a miracle, be a miracle.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Allow God to live out through you.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you today. Let's just bow in
[2:14:51] prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank
[2:14:53] you for your word. Thank you for sending
[2:14:55] us a a prophet in the day in which we
[2:14:57] live. Lord, knowing where he came from
[2:15:00] and what his background is and all about
[2:15:02] it, Lord, his family and the legacy that
[2:15:04] lives on. Father, we're so thankful for
[2:15:07] all of that. But more than any of that,
[2:15:09] Lord, we're thankful that this word that
[2:15:11] the prophet brought gave us the ability
[2:15:15] to come to you,
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Father, to be able to strip ourselves of
[2:15:20] all of our carnality and all of our
[2:15:23] denominations and traditions and creeds
[2:15:26] and dogmas. And Lord Jesus, just come
[2:15:28] and stand face to face with you.
[2:15:32] Lord Jesus, we know that you said that
[2:15:34] there is a time where we will no longer
[2:15:37] look through a glass darkly,
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; but face to face.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; And Father, if there's ever been a day,
[2:15:44] we can say it's this day.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; And we know it's because of your word.
[2:15:47] We thank you for your word. Thank you
[2:15:49] for sending your word to this age
[2:15:51] through the vindicated prophet, Lord.
[2:15:53] For first sending a prophet and
[2:15:55] vindicating his ministry, Lord, but then
[2:15:57] opening the word. Father, we receive it
[2:16:00] the way that you've given it and we
[2:16:01] accept it the way that we're supposed
[2:16:03] to, Lord. Now, Father, help us to call
[2:16:06] to action. Help us to get things
[2:16:08] straight in our own lives, Lord. That we
[2:16:10] could see you live out through us as we
[2:16:13] ripen in the sun until you take us all
[2:16:16] away. Father, we just ask that you would
[2:16:18] bless each one who's come out today.
[2:16:20] Father, we pray that you would be with
[2:16:22] those who didn't come today, wherever
[2:16:24] they are. Father, some might be
[2:16:26] traveling or sick. We pray that you
[2:16:27] would touch them in the name of Jesus.
[2:16:29] That you would keep your hand upon them.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; And Father, we thank you for the request
[2:16:33] today, Lord. That you've already met
[2:16:35] them. We pray that you would just keep
[2:16:37] your hand upon Sister Anna. She's truly
[2:16:39] been a blessing
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; with her visit in the assembly here.
[2:16:42] Lord,
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; until we meet again, we pray that you
[2:16:45] would receive all the glory.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; Just ask all these things now in Jesus
[2:16:51] Christ's name we pray.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
