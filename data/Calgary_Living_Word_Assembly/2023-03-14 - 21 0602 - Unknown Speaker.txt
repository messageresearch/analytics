just following your order Lord it seems so simple and yet it's hidden from the wise and prudent but revealed to babes such as would learn we're thankful Lord that you've given us a heart of a child you've given us the heart of of the poor blessed are the poor Spirit you said for they so shall see the kingdom of God you've given us a contrite spirit Lord there's nothing in us oh God that wants to come against your word but rather we just want to be in full obedience Lord what a privilege that is Lord to have that seed in us oh God that that just responds to your word Lord there's nothing in this world that attracts us Lord it can tempt us but Lord It's So fleeting Lord we're just so thankful for your order tonight we're thankful Lord that we know before we leave this building tonight we're going to have another word cell added to what's already in our spiritual being before because Lord Faith cometh by hearing and hearing your word Lord we know that we're going to leave here we're going to have spiritual growth father it's impossible for a true seed not to leave a service and not be further along the road Lord closer to you more in love with you Lord following your footsteps the fruit of the spirit going before us Lord father that's that's just part of this process Lord Lord we we don't have to Lord I I don't believe we have to beg and cry out for things like this Lord we just need to confess it speak it and move forward Lord that's your plan for our life and Lord we thank you tonight that we have the desire to come and feed on your word once again Lord you've given a fresh coal off the Altar for our pastor he's given us given a little time of rest Lord would you just anoint him afresh Lord May the man step out of the way Lord May the office step forward and Lord I would say that that would be all of our prayer tonight Lord as we hear Lord may it not be physical ears Lord but may it be ears of Revelation father that that seed in us would just just resonate with the word that goes forth Lord and we would just say yes yes yes amen amen and just as we feed Lord that spiritual man in US is growing that little little button as your Prophet talked about just grows and grows in our inner bosom Lord we thank you for that we love you Lord we love you so much Lord because you first loved us we can confess that we love you all things work together for good to those

not in the location it's not in a building it's in you and I it's in the Lord Jesus Christ let's just bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your grace and your mercy to each one of us Lord every one of us has the testimony of what you have done for us in our lives and Lord what you are currently doing in our lives father we're so thankful that you sent us a prophet that would show us that you are the same yesterday today and forever you are not a god of History you are not a god of the future but that you are the present tense I am and we know that in the life of a True Believer today that there is a revival going on in each one of their lives and father we're so thankful for that Revival we're not looking for a great Revival out across the land father we're just looking for more of you to the individual father we just thank you and we love you and we bless your name tonight we just ask Lord Jesus that you would bless our little service now father that you would just take the preeminence that you desire that you would speak to us once again father lip to ear Lord that I could get out of the way and that you would just take this time lord use it For Your Glory we just ask that you would open the word to us once again in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you musicians thank you so much we have your Bibles tonight just like to read from the book of Colossians chapter one and then Ephesians chapter 5. a little bit of a different way tonight but maybe a similar Direction Colossians chapter 1 verse 21. to 23. Ephesians 5 verses 26 and 27. Colossians 1 21 and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven where of I Paul and made a minister Ephesians chapter 5. just two verses out of a real familiar scripture verse 26 and 27. that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing with the water with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish let's just bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your word Lord we're so thankful that your word it doesn't just speak to us a word but it speaks to us life father it shows us our identity Lord Jesus we see you in every chapter in every verse in every line and Lord we see ourselves in you what an honor and a privilege it is Lord Jesus not by anything that we have done but that you chose us first in you before the foundation of the world Lord Jesus tonight we pray that you would just take this word that you would break it open to us fresh again in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen I bless you tonight you may be seated certainly thankful to be back we definitely put on some kilometers while we were away I certainly am thankful to the brothers for the brothers that put their shoulder to the wheel in my absence that were willing to step in and just allow the Lord to use them trust the Lord blessed you with their their offering their sacred portion it's definitely not easy to just come and minister we certainly don't take it lightly we uh on our on our trip we drove just over 2500 kilometers we went to Smithers BC which is just about to the coast of the northern Highway 16. just about to uh Prince Rupert we went to a place called Smithers and then 90 kilometers further north from there and had a wonderful time of fellowship with the stewards brother John Stewart sister Jocelyn Stewart was there and they said to send their greetings to the faithful Saints in Calgary I don't know uh some of the people many people probably remember Sister Jocelyn living with us here fellowshipping with us while she went to school so we got to know her a bit a few years ago but it was certainly neat to see them and and brother John Jr and his wife sister Katrina we got to see them they live in Prince George so we got to go past their house on the way out on the way back it was just wonderful to stop in and see Believers and talk about the word and we had a real treat while we were there sister Katrina's mother was there from Pennsylvania sister Andrea so it was real real nice to talk to another genuine believer you know from a different place altogether but you can tell the The Same Spirit just it's wonderful to be around believers so we had just a wonderful time we had good weather and traveling mercies it was wonderful the Lord showed us just just a wonderful time together as a family and uh you know there's something special about spending a lot of time together in really close quarters where you don't have any distractions of life where it's just a totally different setting and uh just just absolutely wonderful thankful for the the prayers and support to be able to get away and do that the Lord really blessed us we got to see over 10 bears on the road it was just a wonderful wonderful time we uh look forward to what's coming up in our future here seeing the uh the restrictions are about to change Lord willing and uh I think as early as the 10th of June it looks like that will be where they switch from this phase one again the new phase one uh approach to reopening where we'll be allowed to have one third of the fire code allowed to be in the place of worship so we'll go from 15 percent which is 12 people which yeah it's just funny how it flip-flops like that but that's where we are today we're allowed 12 people again we were allowed 15. but now uh we're gonna go to one third of the fire code is what they said by June 10th which would uh be just wonderful glorious in fact that will put us to a total of 26.6 people that will be allowed to have Fellowship here I don't know who the 0.6 of a person will be but I'm sure we can figure that out um but then you know early July the end of June uh they're saying no restrictions which I find amazing and uh what a time it will be of rejoicing we have a busy month of June and uh I apologize for anyone who has maybe taken back or taken by surprise at the new calendar that came out and uh I just have felt led for a while to try something new and we had talked about it a while ago about potentially doing additional services to allow for a greater rotation of the people and uh more frequent attendance to church and I had said you know um I'm a bit reluctant to actually start doing that if we have trouble filling just uh regular services and sometimes there is a lag I think brother Gilbert addressed it pretty straight when he ministered the last time but I just felt you know what let's go for it we talked about it with the ministry the ministry is interested in supporting it and uh so that takes a little bit of pressure off of me I really appreciate that it gives the ministry an opportunity to use their gift we know that it's important to be able to use your gift if God has given you one so um we're switching over to two Services a Sunday now we'll do a morning service and a Sunday night service and I know for some I just want to make it clear we're not interested in trying to put pressure on people um if if it doesn't work for you to come to church two times in one day then that's okay we don't want to put pressure on you don't don't don't think we're asking for money we're not pulling on money we're just simply saying we're going to open the doors and we're going to have another opportunity to worship God and as true believers I I don't see what else there really is in this world the more we look around the darker it gets we had a I was telling brother Emmanuel in the back we were in Jasper on our way back yesterday we stopped in Jasper to get a coffee we enjoy coffee and so we just wanted to get a little bit of a special coffee we got a nice one there in Jasper and Isaac said to me he said Daddy I saw a sign that I think was a bad sign what do you think is it bad and I said well what was it and he says the sign said I and then the heart symbol being gay and and I thought you know out of my my 11 year old son here we are getting a reflection of this nasty world that we live in and and as you drive through town There's the rainbow crosswalk and you know probably this is the kind of stuff that will get us shut down because we are are now labeled officially hate speech if we speak against being gay but you know what it's contrary to the word and until they rewrite the actual Constitution I believe we have the free right to speech as well according to the word and if they want to shut us down for calling truth truth then I guess that's what they need to do but you know what we're ready for it we had kind of a dry run here with this coved situation huh not saying that we want to make ourselves fanatics and and make a spiritual battle out of something that isn't really at our doorsteps but just to look at the situation now our children have to deal with this our children are being taught this in schools what a world we live in as we go brothers and sisters what else is there but fellowshipping with believers brother Branham said that coming to church is as close as we get to heaven on this side of Eternity that we will get so just for the record if you're if you're if you're busy if if you're swamped if if things just don't go right for you if it's too far out of your tradition or whatever to do a dual service on a Sunday there's no pressure don't feel pressured we just want to have church for those people who want to for the next little while it'll only be 26 people anyways and you know when the restrictions lift then uh we'll be able to just have church and you know we don't want to make it a bunch of of of laborious preaching where everyone is so burdened down and keep everyone here till 10 30 or 11 o'clock at night when we have school the next day we're not looking to do that what we want to do is encourage the people to exhort one another even more so as we see the day approaching give the children the ability to to be in an environment that's going to uplift and encourage them just to be able to worship God freely because we don't know how many more times we're going to have we really don't as the world grows darker it's going to get more and more difficult so forgive me but I just felt led to change that I know it's out of our our normal tradition here uh Sundays are a special time for folks for Fellowship like I said if if you feel led that's what you want to do then there's no judgment just do as you feel led we're anticipating uh more of a rotation for people to be able to come to church and uh you know we had changed this even before they decided to lift the restrictions and it was it was partially a coveted thing but partially a worship thing let's just see what God will do you know if we just keep doing the same thing over and over again and and hoping for a new result or a different result what does brother Branham call that what's the true definition of that it's insanity we need to be able to march forward brothers and sisters not not stay in the same place doing the same thing over and over again not saying that what we're doing is wrong but if we can do more why wouldn't we we just want to see what the Lord will do we we uh we read the scriptures we'll get into the scriptures in a couple of minutes I just have a a quote that I wanted to read out of uh what's out of the greatest news flash in history in 1961. brother Branham says they stayed there 40 years and died there right back over the same old thing all the time that's all right Acts 2 verse 4 is part of it but the thing of it is he said one day to his rise you've been on this mountain for 40 years turn north Cross Jordan Yonder the separation for there's more than this mountain for you there's more than Acts 2 verse 4 for you every promise in the book belongs to the church and God's waiting for his church to rise and receive it he's given it to the church we've talked about the the Mysteries and the cloud and and and and the Bloody lamb and and the one that sat on the throne with the book in his hand and how he went and he took the book and he came down and put one foot on the line and one foot on the sea and and he delivered the book and and took that book and delivered it to the prophet and now the prophet is given it to the church and now what what's the church doing brother Adam says it right here and God's waiting for his church not just to receive it but to rise and receive it I I don't know this just inspires me here we have a prophet of God Vindicated prophet of God saying that God is waiting for his church to rise and receive it and I want to say this I'll just throw this in there even more so as you see the day approaching not just assembling ourselves together but exhorting one another encouraging one another right little Branham goes on to say how can you do it when you're still thirsting and wanting to be like the world how can they do it when they're still eating longing for garlic the flashpots of Egypt no this just spoke to me so vividly because of the study we did a while ago on Joshua and Ephesians paralleling Joshua that whole story of Joshua going forwards to conquer the land and God just cultivating the children of Israel and showing them that there's sin in the camp and you've got to just deal with these things in your life just clean them out just get rid of them and when you do that you can March forward again with the Surety and and know that you don't have to be afraid of the enemies when they come because they will come brothers and sisters Satan ain't gonna let us move forwards in a Peaceable manner Satan's going to come guns blazing for the true bride brother Branham says keep in step with Joshua that's right get the new grapes and the new Pentecostal wine get drunk on it I'm not saying go get wine I'm reading what the prophet said here he's talking about getting the Holy Spirit there's a stimulation that happens from the Revelation that that book is no longer in the hand of one sitting on the throne or in the hand of that Bloody lamb or even in the hand of the Prophet that book is now in our hands right he says get drunk on it brother you you won't yeah you won't even look at the world anymore something will happen to you oh let's go forward following the steps of our great leader and conqueror remember God told Joshua every place The Souls of your footsteps that's possession that's possession brother them footsteps means possession let's just keep walking into the promised land Not Looking Back to see what will happen back there and what somebody else is doing don't look at other churches don't look at other people don't look at one another look to Christ don't even look at me brothers and sisters he says let's just keep walking into the promised land Not Looking Back to see what will happen back there and what somebody else is doing keep your eyes on Jesus the Joshua the leader just keep moving on deeper depths and higher Heights until you're possess everything that God promised to you in his word not someone else not another church not not maybe what our our old teaching was or or maybe what we think maybe could be let's just look to Christ you know out of Hebrews chapter 10 I quoted it already but verse 22 let us draw near with a true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water how do our bodies get washed brothers and sisters by pure water by the washing of the water of the word we read that already right having our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and and you know the famous scripture is coming up here and let us consider not one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works let's encourage one another let's be encouraging to one another let's consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is because it is some people actually believe that it's okay to just forsake the assembling of yourselves it's it's true that spirit's alive and well is it alive in Paul's day it's alive today we don't have to look very far to see it it's alive and well today not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching just thinking about that brothers and sisters how much exhorting could we do to one another to take our services and just just about double them in the course of a month whether we stream or whether we come in person I know myself the more Believers faces that I get to see the happier I am I could see a million other people in this world and it's fine and good but when you get to be around a Believer something happens there's a fellowship that happens and you don't even really have to say very much sometimes it's wonderful so I just trust as we go forwards pray with me brothers and sisters that the Lord will just take the the opportunity to maybe just show us why maybe I'm crazy and and I don't know I just believe there's something in store for us here I got another uh quote here or a few we still got some time 45 minutes maybe um out of images of Christ in 1959 this this one just put me on the floor I just love this one this one's so good I'm going after tomorrow night after this wedding I'm going into the Wilderness and I mean to stay there because I weigh down in in my soul I feel that I need a closer walk with God than than what I'm imagine this is the prophet of God here saying this I need a closer walk with God we know he had that Vision to be more he had that vision of the black mamba snake just to be sincere right I'm thinking about this here about going into the Wilderness and uh it it just it really struck me when we were out there we were out in the middle of nowhere basically a place called fort babine and uh sort of mid Central uh Northern British Columbia not very much around and while we were there sitting around the fire one night we're just sitting there and somebody says look at that up in the sky and and so we look up and we see what you can't see it and just keep watching and sure enough there's another one we see this star just go like this and uh then there's another one right behind it and then there's another one right behind it and there's another one right behind it and and we're like what what on Earth is that I've seen a satellite before that just keeps going and going and you can see it Go by but this was like a star that would just sort of get bright and then disappear and it must have just been the way it was reflecting or whatever but my point with all of this I came back and we concluded around the fire that it must be something to do with man it must be satellites or something I came back and and truly it is it's SpaceX but you know even even out in the wilderness now where the Prophet could go and just get away from man and all of the spirits we can't even go into the Wilderness now and not see man looking into the heavens to look at how perverted this world really is brothers and sisters you know coming in here seems to be almost the only place if we didn't have the sounds of the vehicles going by it's amazing how this world really is looking at the prophet here he says I'm going after tomorrow night after this wedding I'm going into the Wilderness and I mean to stay there because I weigh down in my soul I feel that I need a closer walk with God than what I'm I don't don't to just walk I try to walk right before him but I want a closer walk with him while the Branham Tabernacles having a Revival I want one myself I don't want to just happen in the building I want it to happen in me I want a closer walk I want more of the holy spirit in me to reflect Christ in me I want to be like him I know that every true Christian wants to be like him we don't want to reflect ourselves we don't want to reflect all anything else other than him in this world he says that's my heart's desire to be like Jesus he well I want I want him to be my I want him to be the he is the example of what I want to be and look it'll take the Holy Ghost to do that that's the only thing that can do it it's things like this that I read that I think my thank you Lord I know that I'm on the right track what I'm talking about the Holy Ghost it just is like a Vindication for me and and maybe for some people it's it's just preaching to the choir but I think there's other people that will just get excited about it and say Amen I think brother Paul said it well you know there's Believers lives we hear the word and something just says it right you just say Amen say Amen to the word goes on to say I'm not interested in seminaries and what somebody's got to tell me I don't care about kissing crucifix or pulling through your heart or saying prayers to the Dead I'm interested in one thing that's more of the Holy Spirit to take over William Branham this is the prophet how much more the bride I'm not interested in joining a greater Church than what I belong to I belong to the real Church of the Living God of the firstborn I was born into it and I want more of the holy ghost in my life to reflect Christ who I love I think this is powerful here I'm not interested in joining a greater Church than what I belong to [Laughter] because I I belong to the real Church of the Living God the first it's not some other church somewhere else geographically that will give me a greater Revelation or a greater uh Ministry of the Holy Ghost we have all of that in our fingertips right now I want more of the holy ghost in my life to reflect Christ who I love I just I just have to say it this way slowly just hopefully this resonates he says I don't care what plane or level I have come come onto to get it I don't care if I have to go here or go there be called a fanatic holy ruler or whatever it might be I want more of his life to be reflected excuse me he just lays this out in here and I mean there's no there's no interpreting what he's trying to say here he's saying it so clearly I'm not interested in the plane I have come on I'm not interested in in where I'm at spiritually speaking brothers and sisters I believe that's truly The Cry of a of a of a True Believer I'm not interested in staying where I'm at I want to go higher I want to go farther we just heard the prophet say that footsteps are possession the farther that we're willing to go the more he's willing to give us I remember he said it that we started with that where he said God gave it and he's just waiting for his church to rise up and take it I'm not interested in the plane I've come to on I'm I'm interested in the Holy Ghost so I can be more of a servant like he was he was the Lord's servant wow never come to be served or ministered to never come for he to be ministered to but to minister to he took the place of the servant and if the king of Heaven could do that and we're the members of his body let's all be likewise there's no great ones amongst us no big eyes or little use or all one body the mystical body of Jesus Christ I love how he said that I'm looking for a greater Church we've got the greatest church that we could ever find brothers and sisters and that's Jesus Christ to be born into that mystical body of Jesus Christ it's not something that we can actually go and Achieve or bring ourselves to it's what he's called us to be who he called us to be he took the place of a servant and if the king of Heaven could do that and we are the members of his body let's all be likewise not be different but humble ourselves in his presence brothers and sisters where's his presence when we live our lives worstest presence is it just inside the building here his presence I'll say it because we all know it but I'm going to say it anyways it's in the presence of one another that's his presence that's his his chosen vessel that's how he's chosen to represent himself to this last age there's a whole entire group of people we talked about it so many times this they're looking for the 60-foot Jesus they're looking for some other Revelation they're looking for Revelation 19 to happen and and they're missing what's happening right now and brother Branham says they're actually ignoring what's happening right now because they don't want to hear a prophet because the word only comes to a prophet but for those people who have been chosen elected by God predestinated in him from before the foundation of the world they've been given ears to hear what the spirit saith to the church how does the spirit saith it to the church but through a Vindicated prophet he says here not be different but be humble ourselves in his presence no matter what the world's got to say or the intellectual people I just think about the message Scholars when I when I read that there the intellectual people not thinking about that just receive more of the Holy Ghost and be like Jesus humble meekly lowly take his place and he will take yours at the judgment my goodness I feel like we could just end it right there just with that one quote and and maybe just go away and listen to that message and just think about it the prophet of God he's not interested in staying in the same place not interested in how far he's come he knows that there's a greater miracle there's a greater calling you know there's a couple of examples in the Bible I'll just quickly go over and we know that Enoch was one of them right he had a testimony that that that pleased God he walked with God and he pleased him and he was not type of the Bride Enoch he he wasn't interested in staying where he was he knew that something greater was coming and we know that Elijah he had something greater too he had a revelation he knew that he was going to be taken up and that if Elisha he saw him go well you know what you can have what you asked for and it's interesting because in Elisha's life he didn't ask for anything other than a double portion of that same spirit that he had and you know we'll never ask anything amiss if we truly have the right spirit of God in our lives and I mean there's only one spirit of God don't get me wrong I worded that wrong there is only one spirit of God if we have his spirit in our lives we will never ask amiss ever and you know many times the devil will come around and say look at you and look at what you've done or you haven't done and you're a sinner how could you ever be that one who could just please God like Enoch and be not but remember David was one who was a man after God's Own Heart and it didn't matter what David did what gave him the difference what made the difference in David's life the prophet spelled it out super clearly he said the difference in David's life than anyone else what made his heart a heart after God's Own Heart a man after God's Own Heart was that he was quick to repent brothers and sisters we know the Zeal of this age is to repent in the heart of a True Believer and that's that's what does it for us is to say Lord I want to humble myself at your feet I don't want to say that I've got it made in the shade it's all done for me and and I was saved way back there at some camp meeting somewhere 25 30 50 years ago and it's never going to change for me no way we've got to keep walking we got to keep marching forward footsteps is possession David was a man after God's Own Heart he was quick to repent brothers and sisters it's no different there's not a different spirit in the heart of a True Believer today we make mistakes we trip and we fall and what do we do we humble ourselves one to another and we exhort one another even more so as we see the day approaching we don't just let it lie and say you know I'll just it is what it is that person is just that person and I'll just leave it alone and that'll be that no no we're quick to repent just like David because we have a heart after God's Own Heart if we are his bride if we are his bride then the Twain have become one but you know I just thought I would maybe just talk about the the the people that I just mentioned and and we can look at them and say you know they're great heroes in the Bible but what about you take your name and put it there and think about that how we can have a heart after God's Own Heart we can be a man or a woman after God's Own Heart we can be people who actually please God with our walk it might not be easy it might be really difficult but even in the midst of the difficulties we can turn around and start to praise and see the Lord come on the scene and change things and you know many times in our lives brothers and sisters I just believe that that really the more we experience it the more it will just be so real to us we can see the Lord moving our lives so many times and maybe if we don't do things a whole lot differently if we could just actually adjust our thoughts adjust our actions just a tiny little bit and instead of maybe getting upset or flustered or even afraid in a situation start to laugh and sing praise just show Satan a totally different song in your heart show them something different don't be the same creature that we once were show Satan whose side you're on show him a new creature where in Christ Jesus walking in flesh your name brothers and sisters it's got to come down to you and I it has to it's fine to talk about the heroes in the Bible and and the prophet of our day but what about you we talked about the seven sons of Siva probably a long time ago and we know that those those Devils they said you know Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are you we can say well I'll tell you who who I am I'm a Son of God I'm a son of the most high God I am actually part of the mystical body of Jesus Christ now who are you how dare you think you can come and actually bring whatever it is you're trying to in the presence of the most high God brothers and sisters let's put our name there talking about the Holy Ghost out of Christ is the mystery of God revealed now lack of this now and Paul this great intellectual man he never tried to express his great theological terms upon the people he humbly accepted the word of the Lord and he lived the word so that it expressed it he lives so so Godly until they seen Jesus Christ in him so much till they wanted his handkerchief to take it and lay it upon the sick this is Paul's life brother Branham says there's The Life of Christ but this is Paul we're talking about but if that same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells where in you it shall Quicken your mortal body it brings life how does life come brothers and sisters through the body he goes on to say not what some oh you see Elijah done Elijah done that a long time ago I just with this particular quote I want to say it you know brother brownham he he Elijah brother Bradham he'd done that a long time ago yep it's easy to look back and see that isn't it oh you see Elijah done that a long time ago he laid laid his stick but oh that was the Days of Elijah oh that was the days of brother Bradham they had great prayer lines and and healing campaigns right now the world thought that the intellectual priests and things in the churches of that day thought that but to them believers they know it a little different they seen the revelation of Christ that was in Elijah have you seen the revelation of Christ that was in Elijah brothers and sisters it does something for us gives us the ability to realize that we don't need to see a a healing campaign we don't need to see a Vindicated prophet in our day because we actually saw the Life of Christ Living out through a Vindicated prophet in our day which was actually a wave Sheaf an example of the first fruit that should actually come forward in our lives when we come to full maturity it's not just for a prophet now the world thought that the intellectual priests and things and churches of that day thought that but to them believers they know different they seem the revelation of Christ that was in Elijah same thing was in Paul expressed the same kind of life because he was a prophecy he foretold things that happened exactly the way it was and they knowed that was God's identification of a prophet I just love the way that he talks about this about somebody else but as he does that he's actually talking about himself with this food that's stored up when we read this we can look at this and say this speaks exactly of William Branham even when they seen Peter foretell those things that came to pass they said just let his shadow pass over me amen that's the church that's the ones that believe it yes sir we have the ability to believe it tonight brothers and sisters and there's only one way that we are able to believe it though and that is through the revelation of Jesus Christ today the only way that we get that Revelation is by the holy spirit in our lives we've talked about it at length we can have the Holy Ghost anointing on our flesh and enjoy wonderful services and many blessings we can have the Holy Ghost anointing on our spirits and see even more blessings and be super fine people but I just love how brother Gilbert did that example do you remember how he did those circles Body Spirit and soul and what he did was he showed that snake nature that serpent nature inside the person unless we get the Holy Ghost we've got that serpent nature automatically built in to our our bodies and automatically built in to our spirits you know if we're truly called he can't touch our soul there's no room for a serpent in there no room for a snake nature in there is there that's the one that believes it he says yes sir it was revealed by what did Paul say because I got a ph lld and so forth they believe me no he said I forgot all those things the wisdom of man said had to die and I know him in the power of his resurrection if that ever happens to you brother if that ever happens to you sister you you get to know him in the power of his resurrection nobody will ever be able to talk you out of it nobody will ever be able to bring any bit of false Doctrine there will never be any sort of confusion that will come around that will take you away I often thought when I was younger I heard that scripture that the that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible and maybe even now tonight as I I speak those words for some people maybe children maybe people who haven't been totally established in the faith if it feels frightening that it could be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible it's not possible period if we come according to his requirements repent and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not entitles I don't want to do it in titles it won't work it's the wrong formula but if we come according to the word for our day that was given to us by a Vindicated Prophet if we do that then we're given the ability to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost in our lives and if we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we'll never be deceived never ever ever because you can't be deceived with the Holy Ghost any more than God himself can be deceived because the Holy Ghost is God it is the holy spirit it's his very Spirit dwelling in a human being again walking on Earth in flesh that is the Holy Ghost many times it can sound like it's a nebulous thing like it's something different some some other person or or maybe another nature it's not it's the Lord Jesus Christ dwelling in the heart the throne room of man Paul says that's what I come to you as with the demonstration of God's power what was it it's just amazing here such so many simple things that he says that are just so powerful that's what I come to you as with the demonstration of God's power what was it making Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and you know that's that's what makes the water baptism Doctrine the trinitarian baptism and and and baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so contentious because one is designed by Satan to actually hold you back to keep you away to create a diversion and make you believe that you're saved make you believe that you're safe make you believe that that Holy Ghost anointing on your flesh will actually save you but you know there's only one that will save you and that is to have the Holy Ghost in your soul in our soul it has to be all the way down in our soul and our bodies know it you know brother Branham tells that story of that that woman who is out in the world she was a I think a Pianist in the church and she was good at playing the piano and and she had a a lovely life and and was married and then she moved to a place and started to actually become worldly and got into worldly things and before long she found herself with a just out in the world basically living with another person and and a terrible disease and she was in a bed in a hospital dying and the pastor came to see her and she said to the pastor I'm lost I'm lost as lost can be I think it was to brother Bradham and her pastor sorry her pastor is the one who is actually teaching her that it was okay to live that way so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible but in her body in her soul in her spirit as they began to separate brother Bradham talks about it that Pastor that liar said give her a hypo quick give her another hypo she said you're a liar you lied to me I'm lost as lost can be our bodies know it when we get to that state and you know so do our families when when something goes wrong in our lives as believers they know who to phone because they can see Christ being reflected just like we read in this quote they can see Christ walking on Earth again they can hear Christ talking through us and it's not a a boastful thing it's wonderful to think that someone would want to phone you and say could you please pray for the situation and and what an honor and a privilege it is to be able to go on our knees and say yes we certainly will because we know the Living God we know him he's a friend let's stick closer than a brother what a tremendous thing that is that thought alone is just amazing making Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever how important it is to understand that I don't know how many times the prophet said that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever not taking God and making him a historical account and putting him off out into the future and ignoring what he's doing right now but accepting him as the present tense I am to think that that is the answer that God gave Moses when Moses said who should I tell him who sent me tell him I am I am and you know for myself that uh that just Rings true because I remember having a conversation with myself one time I do it quite often and one day maybe they'll lock me up for it but I just remember having a conversation with myself and I believe it was with God and with Satan and and Satan was saying to me you know who said you are a son of God and and I I just heard that voice it spoke inside my heart and said I am said I am and you know brothers and sisters when we start to get those Revelations those little things in our lives it just does something for us it takes us to another level and it gives us the ability to Just Want To Praise them we can't keep quiet when we hear the word we just say be it unto me according to Thy Word and you know we can say that be it unto me according to Thy Word with one word just amen so be it I hear the word of God coming forward so be it be it unto me so be it brother Adam goes on to say oh notice the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the divine revelation of Christ imagine that brothers and sisters not a holy Roman Catholic priest not a geographical location somewhere in the United States out in Arizona I've often thought it'd sure be neat to go up into that box canyon maybe go up on the sunset Mountain go and try and pick a couple bird off a my trouser leg and and just be close in a situation where the prophet of God was it doesn't matter anymore it's not going to do anything for us there's no geographical location the only thing brothers and sisters he says it here the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the divine revelation of Christ and what is that we've read that scripture quite frequently recently Christ in you the hope of glory the mystery that's been hid from all the ages but is made known now unto you Christ in you the hope of glory the only the only revealer of the divine revelation of Christ he says there's no school can do it no scholar can do it no man how well educated or how Godly or anything else there's no man can do it [Laughter] oh my I just think it's so good because I am truly ignorant and unlearned and I know some people don't like that but it's not up to me it's it's up to the lord it's just the way it is he can I guess take me and use me for his glory goes on to say I could I could sting hard here the people that know this message know where I'm going with this says how many Christians Born Again raise up your hands filled with the Holy Ghost all right here we go then all right notice and he will only do it to the predestinated that's exactly all the father has given me will come and no man can come except the father give him to me first just to think about that he says that anyone who has the Holy Ghost anyone who has the ability to say I've got the Holy Ghost filled with the Holy Ghost I'm a Christian Save Tonight with the Holy Ghost it's only because they first were chosen to be those people not because they came to church one night and said I choose it's because they were chosen to choose it's kind of difficult to understand with our minds but it's truth some people would say that means that you don't have a choice in this world you do have a choice in this world we have the ability to make choices and some of the choices that we make will make our lives very easy and some of the choices will make our lives very difficult but we will always make the right choice he will always see his word come to pass in our lives if we have been chosen in him before the foundation of the world that's that's just no question but I just love you know in Ephesians chapter 5 he says in verse 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word not a minister not a pastor not an evangelist nobody else that he might sanctify it with the cleansing of the washing by the water the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish can you imagine if we were to look at one another like that look at our brothers and look at our sisters and and just say that you are holy you're without spot you're without blemish not get caught up in the veil stumble at the Veil but to look at it and think that that person that we're talking to our brother and our sister are are our mother our father our our aunt or our uncle the people who we love who are believers in our lives the people that we rub shoulders with in church if we could just see them without spot or without wrinkle you know we don't really have the ability to do that but God does God only sees us the way that he made us and he hears our voice he doesn't look at our faults and our failures and try to drag us through the mud that's Satan's job Satan does that he doesn't do that God doesn't do that at all he just wants to bless us he just looks at us the way he made us brother says look at them pre-saying this man's Beelzebub he's a fortune teller he's a devil and the story of the little woman at the well he had one thing that he needed to do by the way of Samaria just one thing that he needed to do and his disciples are probably upset saying why do we got to go all the way over there why why he dragging us around one thing he needed to do was tell one person brother Bradham says you take ones one man is all it takes and here he goes on to say in that little old woman walking around there living with six husbands she was living with five and had the sixth one then Jesus said go get your husband and come here she said I have no husband said yes you've got six you've had five and the one you're living with now is not your husband can you imagine that that woman in that state how how terrible she must have felt in her heart to know that she had just completely lost everything that there was no hope uh about having the dreams that a woman might have a virtuous woman they were all gone and here she finds herself talking to the one that she was taught would come she had something in her to be able to receive that word when it came to her and note that she didn't come to the word the word came to her that that's just incredible it's just incredible she said I have no husband said yes you've got six you had five and the one you're living with now is not your husband she said sir what that that light struck that seed when it struck them priests they said this man's a fortune teller see no life there hybrid they come up as far as organizations but died from there on to thank brothers and sisters we have been called unto this word for our day predestinated to be able to hear it to my way of thinking it just makes worship so easy it just makes the desire to go to church so easy he said my my yoke is easy and my burden is light I remember thinking when I was a junior Christian I'll call it you know Sunday night services were tough they were but it was just the place that I was out in my life I wasn't really ready to take that next step and you know it's the old man dying out is what it is but we all have to grow and go at our own pace nobody wants to put any pressure on anybody and say it should be one way or the other way just just get the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters that's the only thing I want to put pressure on I just want to emphasize that with all my might to all the people who hear me who can hear my voice the children and adults alike just get the Holy Ghost that's the only ticket out of here it's the only thing that will separate us from the rest of this world it's the only thing that will give us the ability to tell the difference between truth and error outside of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives the true baptism of the Holy Ghost we are lost as lost can be the Rapture will go one day and and we'll be wondering wasn't something supposed to happen weren't we supposed to do something or go somewhere or someone's supposed to be here or whatever that's what will happen we need to come to church brothers and sisters and get Washed by the washing by the water of the word so that he can present it to himself not presented to a church we don't want to take anybody and say they've gone through the the many stages the courses of Calgary Living Word assembly and now they get a badge no we want to get people to Christ get people to the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost in our lives and we'll never ever ever be the same you know I'm probably just gonna wrap it up soon here I'll just call the musicians but to think that he wants to call a glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing nothing defiled in her in his wife nothing out of order but that it should be holy and without blemish I just read this this verse here maybe stand with me tonight as we close I just read this verse here and I think about the quote that brother Bradham says where he says when the church recognizes what it is then the Rapture will go you read this verse here that he might present it to himself a glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish perfect without blemish to me that's just tremendous you take that quote and this verse here my goodness when we can look at ourselves and say you know I I I don't feel it how many people feel saved sometimes we feel safe sometimes we're on top of the mountain sometimes we just have God's hand moving our lives in such a mighty way and we can just Rejoice but that doesn't change God's approval in our lives just because we're in a in a valley low or a mountain high it doesn't change God's word one iota not one iota not nor does it change his love for us we don't want to let the circumstances in our lives dictate our our love for the father or or allow us to feel his love for us if we're his child then we we are his child that's it but that should be holy and without blemish let's just bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're so thankful that you have chosen a church that you have picked a bride Lord Jesus that you have predestinated a people to be here on Earth for the final age to be the final voice to the final age Lord what an honor and a privilege it is so many times it can it can be so easy to just take for granted some of these things that we talk about but Lord I pray that you would just stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance Lord that we would just look at what you've done for us and realize that out of 7.8 billion people you chose me Lord it should just do something to us father we're just so thankful for your grace and for your mercy thankful for your traveling mercies thankful Lord that you have children Lord that would just put their shoulder to the wheel while we're away father we just love you and we thank you we pray that you would bless each one tonight in a real special way father that you would meet the needs in the hearts of your children father that if it Be Your Will for us to gather again on Sunday Lord we know it's going to be a busy day but we pray that you would just keep your hand upon us Lord if we are able to come back again we pray that you would just bless the services once again father that we could just chart a new course Lord Jesus and not be comfortable where we are but that we would want to try and take a step to a higher ground and not remain Where We Are father we pray that you would just allow us to rise up and accept what you have done for us we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen [Music] sorry a glorious Church yeah amen glorious Church Without
