[3:15] God bless you this morning
[3:17] what an honor and a privilege it is once
[3:20] again to be here
[3:22] in the presence of the king
[3:25] thank you musicians today
[3:28] a special thank you to Sister Taryn to
[3:31] be here playing the flute again what an
[3:34] amazing sound that is
[3:37] if you have your Bibles this morning I
[3:39] would like to read a couple of
[3:40] scriptures
[3:42] I believe we're
[3:45] going to take maybe a little bit of a
[3:47] different direction
[3:48] I can only do what the Lord leads me to
[3:50] do and I just trust we can go along with
[3:53] it if you can turn with me to Genesis
[3:58] chapter one
[4:02] we'll just read a couple of verses there
[4:10] and then I'd like to turn over to Saint
[4:12] John and we'll read
[4:14] a little bit there as well St John
[4:16] chapter 1.
[4:19] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the
[4:21] beginning
[4:23] God created the Heaven and the Earth
[4:25] and the Earth was without form and void
[4:28] and darkness was upon the face of the
[4:31] deep
[4:32] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[4:34] face of the waters
[4:37] and God said let there be light
[4:39] and there was light
[4:42] let's turn over to Saint John
[4:46] chapter one
[4:58] foreign
[5:01] chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning was
[5:04] the word and the Word was with God and
[5:08] the Word was God
[5:10] the same was in the beginning with God
[5:14] all things were made by him and without
[5:16] him was not anything made
[5:19] that was made
[5:21] in him was life
[5:24] and the life
[5:25] was the light of men
[5:28] and the light shineth in a dark in
[5:31] darkness
[5:32] and the Darkness comprehended it not
[5:36] let's just bow in prayer
[5:38] gracious Lord Jesus
[5:40] we're just so thankful
[5:42] that you gave us your word we're so
[5:45] thankful that you gave us your light
[5:47] we're so thankful that you gave us your
[5:50] life
[5:51] Lord that's the reason that every one of
[5:53] us stands here today that's the reason
[5:55] everyone is tuned in today
[5:58] because of that life because of that
[6:00] light
[6:01] that desire that you placed in US father
[6:04] that illustration that your Prophet Drew
[6:08] showing the last age
[6:10] with just a little teeny sliver of light
[6:15] father we recognize that light
[6:17] we comprehend it today
[6:19] father we pray that you would just turn
[6:21] back the pages of this word to us Lord
[6:24] that you would just break the bread of
[6:25] life to us fresh once again
[6:28] just like Melchizedek did
[6:30] for Abraham
[6:32] we just ask all these things in Jesus
[6:34] Christ's name amen
[6:37] God bless you this morning you may be
[6:38] seated
[6:44] yeah
[6:47] just want to do a couple of comments
[6:49] about the communion service
[6:51] it's kind of weird I know
[6:54] I apologize
[6:57] um
[6:58] firstly welcome to everyone that's here
[7:00] so nice to see some
[7:02] Fresh Faces
[7:04] so many people I haven't seen for so
[7:06] long God bless you
[7:08] and God bless everyone else who is with
[7:10] us virtually
[7:12] I trust the Lord blesses our service
[7:14] today
[7:15] we were going to have a communion
[7:17] service tonight the Brethren that we're
[7:19] in Lethbridge last weekend
[7:21] came in relative contact to a brother
[7:24] who tested positive for covid
[7:27] so I made the decision to cancel the
[7:30] communion and to basically suggest that
[7:33] everybody that was there get tested just
[7:36] to make sure that we're doing everything
[7:37] that we can
[7:39] to not just be careless
[7:42] I personally want to ensure that we are
[7:45] diligent
[7:46] how we conduct ourselves as an assembly
[7:50] and I really want to encourage how we
[7:53] conduct ourselves individually
[7:56] I know that some of us want to cut
[7:58] corners
[8:00] and I know that some of us have
[8:03] and we need to make sure that we are
[8:05] showing the right example to the world
[8:07] around us
[8:09] that we believe and how do we do that
[8:12] not not just by dressing or talking it's
[8:14] by our actions Our Lives speak volumes
[8:17] we preach a sermon every day of our life
[8:20] when we get around people and you know
[8:22] that much more when we've already
[8:24] testified to people that we believe the
[8:27] word
[8:28] those people examine us closely
[8:31] we need to make sure we're sending a
[8:33] congruent message with what the word
[8:34] says I'm not here to preach on that
[8:36] today I think everybody has a conscience
[8:39] and we know what the word says if
[8:41] there's a law in the land
[8:44] we have to obey it
[8:45] that's that's the word
[8:48] we could certainly have a discussion
[8:50] about it but
[8:51] all I can say is that I know one day I
[8:54] will have to give an account
[8:56] for my actions here in the office that I
[8:58] hold
[9:00] but what's more
[9:01] and I don't mean it to derate the office
[9:04] but what's more is the here and now I
[9:07] have to give an account to my children
[9:09] because I'm a father
[9:11] and my children need to see a congruent
[9:13] message with what I say and not just
[9:17] with what I say but what I do and
[9:19] brothers and sisters if you have
[9:20] children people around you that you love
[9:22] you need to send the same message it
[9:24] can't be we're good Christian people we
[9:27] believe the message of the hour but it's
[9:28] okay to just break the law it's not okay
[9:30] just to break the law
[9:33] we have to speak truth
[9:35] in love
[9:38] brother Peter sent a text to say that
[9:40] one thing he forgot to mention is that
[9:43] he tested negative but not just he but
[9:47] his entire family tested negative they
[9:50] were in direct contact with the Brethren
[9:52] Lethbridge and uh you know it's not
[9:55] about a brother it's a demon
[9:58] it's a demon spirit and and we all come
[10:01] in contact with demon Spirits the
[10:03] Demonic forces are great in this world
[10:05] and we brothers and sisters are that
[10:07] little tiny sliver of light that brother
[10:09] Branham drew that we talked about in the
[10:11] prayer we are that light to this Dying
[10:14] World to this Dark Age
[10:16] it's up to us to make sure that we shine
[10:18] properly
[10:20] so brother Peter wanted to make it known
[10:22] that he was uh he was okay so some of
[10:24] the other brothers they're uh
[10:26] quarantining just being careful to make
[10:29] sure that we're crossing the t's and
[10:31] dotting the eyes it's not an impo
[10:33] imposition I haven't insisted that
[10:36] anybody behaves that way I have simply
[10:38] recommended I've suggested that we just
[10:40] try and be as careful as possible you
[10:43] know what everyone isn't at the same
[10:44] level of faith we might have a great
[10:46] warrior of faith that could go and stand
[10:48] in in in in in extreme radiation and and
[10:52] and not be afraid because of the level
[10:54] of Faith they have and there could be
[10:56] other people they just don't have that
[10:57] level of faith and we if we bring
[10:59] something bad around people who don't
[11:01] have the same level of faith we could
[11:03] potentially put them in Peril and we
[11:05] don't want to do that we want to make
[11:07] sure that we're applying Our Lives
[11:09] to the best of our ability at least
[11:11] that's what I would encourage
[11:14] we all will give an account one day for
[11:17] the standards that we live in our lives
[11:18] you know in James chapter 5 it says just
[11:21] part of the verse but let your yea be ye
[11:23] and your nay nay lest ye fall into
[11:26] condemnation
[11:28] if you say something today and do
[11:29] something different tomorrow then you're
[11:31] sending a mixed message which creates
[11:33] condemnation which creates iniquity and
[11:36] we don't want to see that in anyone's
[11:38] life
[11:39] but I think brother Steve prayed it well
[11:41] that everything that happens is ordained
[11:44] of the Lord and we can simply ask him to
[11:46] open the doors we can ask him to open up
[11:50] to take these restrictions away from us
[11:52] so we can get together and fellowship
[11:53] the way that we we're used to the way
[11:56] that we want to see how much sweeter
[11:58] will it be after all of this nonsense
[12:01] to fellowship with the Believers to get
[12:04] together and have a church full of
[12:06] people singing the same songs you know
[12:08] that song I'll get carried away when I
[12:10] get carried away you know we we we we're
[12:13] looking about getting excited once we're
[12:15] getting carried away but you know maybe
[12:17] we could look at it the other way that
[12:18] maybe we'll get carried away because we
[12:20] just get too carried away here on this
[12:22] side we just can't contain that
[12:24] excitement
[12:28] we know that Rapture is imminent let's
[12:31] just pray the Lord will open up the door
[12:32] so we can at least just worship together
[12:36] I just
[12:39] hope you can bear with me I I know I've
[12:42] bounced around a lot
[12:43] um I've really been inspired recently by
[12:46] the invisible Union of the bride and I'm
[12:47] just gonna talk a little bit about this
[12:49] one and I know brother Branham takes his
[12:51] text from there but just to set a little
[12:53] bit of a background for where I felt led
[12:55] to go today you know in that message
[12:57] brother Bradham he uh he gets asked you
[12:59] know if you could have any age that you
[13:01] would want to come back to the world and
[13:03] preach in what what age would it be and
[13:06] and it's just amazing because this is
[13:09] what he said in this message the Golden
[13:11] Age brothers and sisters to think that
[13:14] we have the ability to be that light to
[13:17] the darkness in this world and and that
[13:20] Darkness just doesn't comprehend the
[13:22] light you can tell people that God sent
[13:24] a prophet and they'll look at you like
[13:26] you're crazy like you have two heads
[13:28] but this is the Golden Age brothers and
[13:30] sisters the more I I contemplate this
[13:33] the more I think about it I trust it's
[13:34] the same for you the more real it
[13:37] becomes that when we get over to the
[13:38] other side we're going to say how did
[13:40] you make it Noah how did you make it
[13:41] David how did you make it Jeremiah how
[13:43] did you make it Isaiah how did you go
[13:45] through all these different things and
[13:46] they're going to say you know we did by
[13:47] the grace of God but what about you when
[13:49] there was no Grace on Earth just a
[13:52] little tiny sliver of Grace
[13:55] and God lived out through you
[13:58] you know we're going to step into a new
[14:00] day
[14:02] any day now
[14:04] we're about to step into a new day
[14:05] brother Branham said and we're going
[14:07] into a millennial reign
[14:10] in this message marriage and divorce
[14:12] Paul Illustrated it like it was not
[14:14] marriage and divorce sorry an invisible
[14:16] Union of the Bride Paul Illustrated it
[14:18] like marriage and divorce
[14:20] and it pertains to a greater portion
[14:24] and and what that portion is is that we
[14:25] can't be married to the world and to
[14:28] Christ at the same time we can't have a
[14:30] speck of the old ideas the speck of the
[14:33] old tradition we can't have anything of
[14:36] the old and and and and get into the new
[14:39] and and see Christ come into our lives
[14:41] if we do that then he will call us an
[14:44] adulteress
[14:46] and he won't have an adulteress for a
[14:48] wife
[14:49] this message unfolds a great mystery of
[14:52] the prophecy
[14:54] and you know really what I like the
[14:57] little story he talks about in this
[14:58] message he talks about Moody Dwight
[15:01] Moody after reading Romans chapter 7 he
[15:03] runs into the street and the first
[15:05] person he sees he says do you know Grace
[15:09] and they say grace who
[15:11] and he tells them the grace of God
[15:14] do you know the grace of God this is the
[15:16] grace that he's talking about
[15:19] he goes on to say that this grace is the
[15:21] elect lady that's what he's talking
[15:24] about and you know we talked about Mary
[15:26] uh quite a bit recently and we probably
[15:28] will continue to and and Mary was the
[15:31] elected of God she was this Lady of
[15:35] Grace and God also chose
[15:38] an elected lady for his bride
[15:41] and we all understand that and and I
[15:44] know maybe some of this sounds
[15:45] Elementary and I I pray that it just
[15:47] won't be that we'll see it all sort of
[15:50] come together here somewhere along the
[15:52] way
[15:53] but we know that the woman is always a
[15:56] type of the church
[15:58] and brother Branham in this message he
[16:00] says watch the conditions and the
[16:03] conduct of women
[16:04] and you will see where the church is
[16:07] the conduct of women in the world
[16:11] and the conduct of women in the church
[16:14] now just like brother Bradham says in
[16:16] this message I'm not speaking to the
[16:18] people here I'm speaking although I am
[16:20] speaking to the people here I'm not
[16:21] speaking about the people here that's
[16:23] what I mean to say I'm speaking about
[16:25] the church in general the the
[16:26] denominational world
[16:29] that's out there the woman the spiritual
[16:32] bride
[16:34] or what brother Bradham says the
[16:35] so-called claim to be bride
[16:39] and he talks about this woman going on a
[16:40] rampage
[16:42] and and really
[16:43] we look at people who will live a life
[16:47] of divorce
[16:49] and while their living husband is still
[16:51] alive they'll get remarried again and
[16:53] and it's completely contrary to the word
[16:55] and that's what brother Bradham is
[16:57] talking about but but furthermore women
[16:59] will actually go contrary to the word
[17:01] and wear garments that pertain to a man
[17:03] even though the same word Abomination is
[17:06] the exact same definition as
[17:08] homosexuality in the Bible but they just
[17:11] brush right over that and say it's just
[17:12] a cultural thing it's just okay
[17:15] it's kind of a weird thing that people
[17:17] would say that that that verse has any
[17:20] any weight today but where do you stop
[17:22] if you start to filter the word and and
[17:25] take scriptures out and put scriptures
[17:27] in we know in Revelations it says
[17:28] whoever adds or takes away from this
[17:30] scripture the plagues described in this
[17:32] book will be added to them
[17:34] maybe some of these people should go and
[17:36] read the book of Revelation and and see
[17:39] what's coming upon this world but
[17:41] brother Branham says that the spiritual
[17:43] bride
[17:44] that when the spiritual bride there will
[17:47] be a message in the spiritual bride that
[17:50] will sweep out through the land
[17:53] and and we have the opportunity brothers
[17:55] and sisters to be that spiritual bride
[17:57] but I just felt like you know
[18:01] we should just go back to the very
[18:03] beginning and take a look at what God's
[18:05] version of the Bride is
[18:08] and and just see
[18:10] because if if she takes anything if if a
[18:13] woman takes anything from the past and
[18:16] tries to bring it into her marriage
[18:18] the word says that she will be called an
[18:20] adulteress if we try and do that
[18:22] spiritually the word says that we'll be
[18:24] called an adulteress we don't want to do
[18:26] that we don't want to have a living
[18:27] husband and try and get married again we
[18:29] need to make sure that that old person
[18:31] dies and that's what brother Brown was
[18:32] talking about in The Invisible Union of
[18:33] the Bride the old man the old person we
[18:36] have to die out completely unto
[18:38] ourselves to allow Christ to live in our
[18:40] lives and it's exactly with what Paul
[18:42] said I Die daily we have got to be doing
[18:44] that ourselves
[18:46] if not
[18:48] then we could be marked in adultereness
[18:50] and brother Branham he goes on to say
[18:52] it's not so much about about the the
[18:55] natural type he's not throwing off on
[18:58] women specifically saying that women are
[19:00] terrible and and so on and so forth he
[19:02] says so when the church when she tries
[19:05] to mix Creed or denomination
[19:08] that is adultery it's spiritual adultery
[19:11] we cannot try and mix our old ideas
[19:14] maybe a new idea anything that's not
[19:16] contrary to the message of the hour or
[19:18] the word we can't mix it with the Bible
[19:20] if we try and take a a a a a
[19:23] psychological perspective and say you
[19:26] know what I understand this and I can
[19:28] take it and find a way to mix it with
[19:30] the word and mix it with the message and
[19:31] blend it all in and and and present it
[19:34] it will be good it won't be good
[19:36] we only want the message of the hour
[19:38] which is the word of God
[19:40] it's a bit like I use this analogy a
[19:43] little while ago it's a bit like like
[19:45] salad dressing you can make a really
[19:47] nice vinaigrette salad dressing by
[19:49] taking oil and vinegar and mixing them
[19:52] together
[19:53] and and you can stir it really good and
[19:55] and it will be what's called emulsified
[19:57] and it will it'll be little particles
[19:59] all mixed in and it will stay that way
[20:01] for a little while and it will taste
[20:02] really good
[20:03] but just leave it sit there eventually
[20:06] it will Express what's in it and it will
[20:09] separate because it cannot stay together
[20:11] and that's what will happen with the
[20:13] word
[20:14] and people that don't actually get
[20:16] taught the word properly they have that
[20:18] situation happen in their life they
[20:20] can't help it
[20:22] because it separates you can't mix oil
[20:24] and water you can't mix oil and vinegar
[20:26] and keep it together it'll only stay for
[20:28] a little while
[20:30] so the church if it tries to mix a Creed
[20:33] or a denomination one is completely
[20:36] contrary to the other
[20:40] it's pretty uh it's pretty amazing I
[20:42] think
[20:43] myself
[20:44] just to go back and take a look at at
[20:46] Eden and and and to really just examine
[20:50] it and that's what I've been doing so
[20:52] bear with me if we could just turn back
[20:55] to the Book of Genesis
[20:57] in the beginning
[21:01] you know verses one to five
[21:03] God takes the time to express in the
[21:06] word here in the beginning
[21:09] God created the Heaven and the Earth
[21:12] and the Earth it was without form and it
[21:15] was void
[21:17] and darkness was upon the face of the
[21:19] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[21:21] the face of the waters
[21:23] and God said let there be light
[21:27] and there was light
[21:30] and God saw the light and that it was
[21:32] good and God divided the light
[21:34] from the darkness and God called the
[21:36] light day
[21:37] and the Darkness he called night and the
[21:40] evening and the morning
[21:43] were the first day
[21:46] and we look at that light
[21:50] I have always looked at this and thought
[21:52] you know
[21:53] God turned on the lights he actually
[21:56] created a light that we could see the
[21:59] universe lit up at that point
[22:02] but you know if we go a little further
[22:05] I believe it was
[22:07] let me see here
[22:09] this light that we're talking about I'll
[22:11] just say this it's not
[22:14] it's not a natural light
[22:15] that we perceive when we see the sunrise
[22:18] when we turn on a light switch
[22:20] if we turn over to the Book of John
[22:21] again
[22:23] we can talk about the light
[22:25] I believe
[22:27] that God was referring to
[22:31] John chapter one we'll probably bounce
[22:32] back and forth if you have a marker it
[22:35] might be easier for you
[22:37] John chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning
[22:40] was the word and the Word was with God
[22:42] and the same Word was God the same was
[22:44] in the beginning with God
[22:47] all things were made by him and without
[22:50] him was not anything made that was made
[22:52] in him was life and the life was the
[22:55] light of men
[22:57] the life was the light of men
[23:00] and the light shineth in the Darkness
[23:03] and the Darkness comprehended it not
[23:08] so what we're talking about here isn't
[23:10] necessarily the light that we can
[23:12] perceive with our eyes we're talking
[23:14] about life God spoke
[23:18] and it happened God created life and it
[23:21] happened and I heard somebody say this
[23:23] recently and I I would just like to
[23:25] throw the question out there has anybody
[23:26] else heard this that uh the world was
[23:29] perhaps in a state of a fallen condition
[23:31] after a prior civilization your brother
[23:35] Branham say that somewhere
[23:37] I couldn't find it I heard it and I
[23:39] thought that sounds really intriguing
[23:40] but I just couldn't find it anywhere
[23:43] if anybody knows it I would appreciate
[23:44] it we could we could talk about it but
[23:47] you know in verse 5 day one he called
[23:49] the light day and The Dark Knight and
[23:51] the evening and morning were the first
[23:53] day
[23:55] and uh
[23:57] Saint John verse 1 to 9.
[24:02] we read and the light shineth in the
[24:04] darkness and the Darkness comprehendeth
[24:05] it not verse 6 there was a man sent from
[24:08] God whose name was John
[24:12] and the same the same came for a witness
[24:15] to Bear witness of the light
[24:18] that all man through him
[24:21] might believe
[24:23] I love how he explains this here he was
[24:25] not that light
[24:28] but was sent to Bear witness of that
[24:31] light
[24:33] that was the True Light
[24:35] which lighteth every man that cometh
[24:38] into the world
[24:39] he was in the world and the world was
[24:41] made by him and the world knew him not
[24:45] I'm getting ahead of myself
[24:48] that was the True Light he says which
[24:50] lighteth
[24:52] every man that cometh into the world so
[24:54] he's not speaking of a light like a
[24:56] flashlight a light like the sunshine a
[24:59] light like a torch like they might have
[25:02] had back in John's day he's speaking
[25:04] directly about a life
[25:06] he's speaking about the witness of the
[25:09] Lord Jesus Christ
[25:11] which is I believe what we're talking
[25:13] about over here in the Book of Genesis
[25:16] it's kind of going back and forth but to
[25:18] think the man was sent from God to Bear
[25:21] witness of the light
[25:24] so where are we going with this we know
[25:26] that Isaiah 40 the voice of him that
[25:28] Christ in the wilderness prepare ye the
[25:30] way of the Lord make straight in the
[25:32] desert a highway for our God
[25:35] we know that John the Baptist was the
[25:37] third Elijah anointing
[25:39] in the Bible John the Baptist we know is
[25:43] not Saint John the Revelator the one who
[25:45] rested on Jesus bosom who Jesus loved
[25:49] John the Baptist was the one
[25:52] Prophet that was crying out
[25:55] shining the supernatural light for that
[25:58] day
[25:59] and we know that we've had the fourth
[26:01] Elijah anointing in our day
[26:03] doing the very same thing crying out the
[26:06] very same word crying out shining forth
[26:09] the very same light
[26:13] the same thing we've experienced in our
[26:15] day
[26:16] and you know many people will just
[26:18] dismiss brother Branham and say he's
[26:20] just a wild man he's off on his Doctrine
[26:22] he was really good when he was into the
[26:23] healing campaigns and the signs and
[26:25] wonders were great he was a mighty man
[26:27] of God but boy when he sat down one day
[26:29] and said I am my father are one we have
[26:31] to do away with him
[26:33] as our brother said earlier today I
[26:35] think it was brother Steve praying you
[26:37] know unless you eat eat my body and
[26:40] drink my blood you have no part in me
[26:43] you're a vampire these people are crazy
[26:45] brother Branham was preaching the very
[26:47] same gospel
[26:49] he wasn't preaching anything different
[26:52] but as John the Baptist was sent to
[26:54] forerun the first coming of Christ we
[26:57] know brother bradham's commission and
[26:58] that was before on the second coming of
[27:00] Christ
[27:01] and and were so many years down the road
[27:04] now brothers and sisters here we are
[27:06] believing this message
[27:09] it takes Revelation for us to actually
[27:11] understand what we're talking about
[27:13] today this light and and this life
[27:16] and and we're going to go further I just
[27:18] wanted to dwell on this a little bit
[27:19] that what we're talking about it's not
[27:21] necessarily a light like we would
[27:23] perceive with our natural senses it's
[27:26] it's not that
[27:29] um
[27:31] it's verse 15 in Genesis chapter one no
[27:34] verse 14.
[27:37] after the third day
[27:39] Genesis chapter 14.
[27:42] and God said let there be lights in the
[27:44] firmament of the heaven to divide the
[27:46] day from the night and let them be for
[27:49] signs and for seasons and for days and
[27:52] for years and let them be for lights in
[27:56] the firmament of Heaven
[27:58] to give light upon the Earth
[28:01] and it was so
[28:04] verse 16 and God
[28:06] made two great lights the greater light
[28:09] to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to
[28:11] rule the night
[28:13] and he made the Stars also and God set
[28:15] them in the firmament of Heaven to give
[28:18] light upon the Earth and to rule over
[28:21] the day and over the night and to divide
[28:23] the light from the darkness and God saw
[28:26] that it was good in the evening and the
[28:28] morning were the fourth day
[28:30] so here we see just a little bit further
[28:33] down in scripture after he created all
[28:35] the land and after he created the waters
[28:38] divided the waters with the land created
[28:40] the firmament of the heavens created the
[28:42] firmament of the land he created all the
[28:45] fish in the sea he did all of that
[28:50] actually maybe he didn't create the fish
[28:51] of the sea I apologize but he created
[28:53] the land the Earth the air
[28:56] and then he actually created the light
[28:58] to shine on it
[29:00] but at the beginning here he said that
[29:02] he created the light
[29:04] so I just wanted to clarify that we're
[29:07] talking about a very specific thing and
[29:08] it's a life
[29:10] it's not just a light like we would
[29:11] perceive it it's actually a life
[29:15] but as we go
[29:17] we know that it takes Revelation and we
[29:19] can't just read the Bible and expect to
[29:21] understand it if we just read it
[29:23] comparing chapter and verse brother
[29:25] Branham says the only way that we'll be
[29:27] able to understand the church age book
[29:29] the only way we'll be able to understand
[29:30] the Bible is to read it with spiritual
[29:32] Revelation it takes a revelation we know
[29:35] that when Jesus was here he was with his
[29:37] disciples and he taught them and he said
[29:38] to them you know who are people saying
[29:40] that I am and some said Elias and some
[29:42] said one of the prophets
[29:44] and he said that's nice but who do you
[29:46] say that I am and really it comes down
[29:48] to that brothers and sisters in order
[29:49] for us to understand the word for our
[29:51] day we have got to have that spiritual
[29:53] Revelation in our lives
[29:55] it has to be who do you say that he is
[29:58] today
[29:59] not back there with the disciples we can
[30:01] look back and say that he was Christ the
[30:03] son of the Living God just like Peter
[30:05] said and and say that you know Upon This
[30:08] Rock I'll build my church and the gates
[30:10] of hell can't Prevail against it we have
[30:12] Revelation because we saw what Peter
[30:13] said and sure we do we understand that
[30:16] by the grace of God but what is it now
[30:18] to you what does that mean to us today
[30:21] it has to be the Lord Jesus Christ alive
[30:23] in us today that spiritual Revelation it
[30:27] has to be his life that light that we
[30:29] were reading about earlier it has to be
[30:31] him alive in us today it takes spiritual
[30:34] revelation
[30:35] that personal relationship is what we're
[30:37] getting to
[30:39] has to be revealed personally
[30:44] you know in uh in Genesis
[30:48] Genesis 1 verse 6 to 8.
[30:50] he he goes goes on and and I just got
[30:53] way ahead of myself and he creates the
[30:55] firmament and and the land and the
[30:57] Heaven and the atmosphere and then he
[31:00] goes on to divide the dry land from the
[31:02] sea and then he goes on in in verses 11
[31:06] to 13 which is day three the grass and
[31:09] the herb yielding seed
[31:12] fruit trees whose seed was in itself
[31:15] after its kind
[31:18] he's just going and and creating and and
[31:21] starting at the very Foundation the
[31:23] bottom and working his way up creating
[31:25] all of the living things on earth
[31:29] and as we go I just want to try and and
[31:31] that's why I felt led to go this way so
[31:33] pardon me if if it is a bit weird and
[31:35] maybe even annoying by by how broken up
[31:38] it might sound I just wanted to try and
[31:40] set the example of this if we could have
[31:42] this thought as we talk about it the
[31:45] absolute purity of this creation that
[31:49] God's created
[31:50] no defilement
[31:52] that creation we will see one day
[31:56] just like job said in my flesh I will
[31:59] see him we will see this creation one
[32:01] day maybe not exactly the Garden of Eden
[32:04] maybe not exactly the way it was created
[32:06] here but we will see the purity of it
[32:10] but no defilement
[32:12] so verses 14 to 19 in in Genesis chapter
[32:16] one
[32:19] every living creature in the waters uh
[32:22] 14 to 19 day four
[32:26] yeah we read that sorry
[32:28] told you I got ahead of myself I was
[32:30] right
[32:31] verse 20 to 25 day five every living
[32:33] creature in the waters and every winged
[32:35] foul
[32:38] verses 24 to 25 day six all the living
[32:41] creatures every creeping thing and every
[32:44] cattle after their own kind and God saw
[32:48] that it was good
[32:51] not the end of it verses 26 to 28 where
[32:55] we really want to get to today
[32:57] verse 26 says and God said let us make
[32:59] man
[33:00] in our image after our likeness
[33:05] and let them have dominion over the fish
[33:07] of the sea over the fowl of the air over
[33:11] the cattle over all the Earth over every
[33:14] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[33:17] Earth
[33:19] verse 27 so God created man in his own
[33:22] image
[33:23] in the image excuse me of God created he
[33:26] him male and female created he them
[33:30] and God blessed them and God said unto
[33:33] them be fruitful and multiply and
[33:35] replenish the Earth and subdue it and
[33:38] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[33:40] and over the fowl of the air and over
[33:42] every living thing that moveth upon the
[33:45] Earth
[33:46] so God created man in his own image and
[33:50] and gives man a total dominion over all
[33:53] of the Earth
[33:54] every single aspect of his creation now
[33:57] he's placed into the hands of man in in
[34:00] this absolutely pure environment with no
[34:04] defilement
[34:07] and it was after all this creation
[34:13] sorry it's oh my I just seem to be
[34:16] mixing myself up here
[34:18] verse 7 of uh
[34:21] verse seven
[34:23] of chapter two
[34:25] going forwards
[34:27] and the Lord formed Man Out of the Dust
[34:30] of the ground
[34:31] and breathed into his nostrils
[34:35] the Breath of Life
[34:37] and Man became a living soul
[34:40] and this scripture here
[34:42] is where
[34:44] it basically Begins the creation of
[34:48] human beings on Earth
[34:50] it's gone from being the spirit
[34:54] Man created in God's Own image
[34:57] in in chapter one of Genesis
[35:01] to chapter 2 now God forming Man Out of
[35:05] the Dust of the ground
[35:07] and creating breath into his nostrils
[35:09] the Breath of Life
[35:11] and man now becomes a living soul
[35:17] and it was after this
[35:20] that God planted a garden
[35:24] verse 8. in Chapter 2 and the Lord God
[35:27] planted a garden Eastward in Eden
[35:30] and there he put the man whom he had
[35:33] formed
[35:35] and out of the ground made the Lord God
[35:37] to grow every tree that is Pleasant to
[35:39] the sight and good for food
[35:42] the tree of life also in the midst of
[35:45] the garden and the tree of knowledge of
[35:47] Good and Evil
[35:49] and we could just read that
[35:53] and brush right over it and miss exactly
[35:56] what the message is in that one verse
[36:00] I could never explain this as good as
[36:03] brother Aaron McGeary did one time when
[36:04] he was here
[36:06] but I just thought I would I would stop
[36:08] and and talk about it a little bit
[36:11] in my own way and I trust that it will
[36:14] actually everybody might already know
[36:16] this but in this scripture here God
[36:19] planted a garden every tree Pleasant to
[36:21] the site and good for food
[36:24] there's that semicolon there at the end
[36:26] of the food
[36:28] and then it says the tree of life also
[36:31] in the midst of the garden and the tree
[36:33] of knowledge of Good and Evil
[36:35] that semicolon is a very significant
[36:38] Mark in the middle of that scripture
[36:41] because it's talking about the same
[36:43] thought but it has a totally different
[36:44] meaning
[36:46] it's not herb herb bearing
[36:49] her herb yielding trees it's not trees
[36:52] that are just trees with their own seeds
[36:55] in them they have fruit they bear fruit
[36:56] and and it's food that we eat it's
[36:59] actually speaking about people it's
[37:02] speaking about God and it's speaking
[37:05] about Satan very specifically that
[37:08] semicolon is Big even though it's just a
[37:11] tiny little Mark on the page
[37:13] the Tree of Life
[37:15] and the tree of knowledge of Good and
[37:17] Evil very two very distinct uh
[37:23] distinct trees out of Jehovah Jireh part
[37:25] 2 1962 Christ that tree that was in the
[37:29] Garden of Eden there were two trees in
[37:31] the Garden of Eden these two trees were
[37:33] set there for birth purpose
[37:37] and when Eve
[37:40] she was the tree of death
[37:43] if she was touched and Christ was the
[37:47] Tree of Life
[37:48] now by the woman comes death
[37:52] by the man come life
[37:55] out of the Ephesian Church age brother
[37:57] Branham says it's about the true trees
[37:58] some have an idea that the two trees in
[38:01] the garden were just two two more trees
[38:02] like unto the rest of those that God had
[38:05] placed there but careful students know
[38:07] that this is not so when John the
[38:10] Baptist cried that the ax is laid was
[38:13] laid to the root of all trees he was not
[38:16] talking of Simply natural trees but of
[38:20] spiritual principles
[38:23] what what we're talking about today is
[38:27] is a restoration Back to Eden
[38:29] and if I had to title it I think that's
[38:31] what I would title it a restoration Back
[38:33] to Eden what we want to do is talk about
[38:36] the creation of man and woman and how
[38:40] God created it and expected it to go and
[38:43] knew that it would actually turn into
[38:45] the fall
[38:46] but he created it with a very specific
[38:48] purpose and I believe I'm sure we all do
[38:51] as well if we stand back and look at it
[38:53] that purpose that God had that heart
[38:55] purpose in the very beginning in Genesis
[38:58] was to set the example for the bride in
[39:01] the very last age this is exactly what
[39:04] we should be looking for now we're going
[39:06] to dig into this a little further I I
[39:09] trust it's not been so broke up that uh
[39:12] we're not together I hope we are what we
[39:14] want to talk about is the voice of God
[39:16] and how that voice of God is is really
[39:19] what we want to get to because the voice
[39:21] of God in the garden was the creative
[39:24] powers that God put inside Adam when he
[39:27] created man and woman and formed them in
[39:30] his own image he created them to have a
[39:33] spoken word birth it was supposed to be
[39:36] a spoken word creation and that's
[39:39] exactly what God set forth in the garden
[39:42] fully knowing though
[39:45] that they would fall
[39:47] and when they did something happened
[39:50] something significant happened and we'll
[39:52] just go over it slowly and and trust
[39:54] that maybe we're setting a foundation
[39:55] for something that the Lord wants us to
[39:57] get into here but it's the voice of God
[40:00] in Genesis 2 the voice of God wasn't
[40:03] just the voice of God speaking it was
[40:06] the voice of God inside Adam when Adam
[40:10] spoke
[40:11] it wasn't Adam speaking his thoughts it
[40:13] was Adam the Son of God speaking God's
[40:16] thoughts
[40:18] he had the mind of Christ and and I just
[40:20] I got so inspired when I saw this could
[40:22] we say that the word was in The Bride
[40:25] right there
[40:27] the spoken word is the Original Seed
[40:30] the word was in the bride and and the
[40:32] bride had the mind of Christ to know
[40:34] what to do with that word
[40:41] but it's interesting because we know
[40:43] that
[40:45] God spoke in the very beginning God
[40:47] spoke
[40:51] God said let there be light and there
[40:53] was light
[40:55] and and and we see it go go through
[40:58] Genesis chapter one and God spoke God
[41:02] said
[41:06] and finally said let us make man in our
[41:08] own image
[41:10] after our likeness
[41:13] let them have dominion over the fish in
[41:15] the sea
[41:16] let them have our likeness let them have
[41:19] our spirit let them have our life let
[41:21] them have our light let them have our
[41:24] mind let them have our likeness our
[41:26] character our our our creative ability
[41:30] and he told them replenish the Earth and
[41:32] subdue it
[41:34] have dominion over the fish of the Sea
[41:35] and the fowl of the air and over every
[41:37] living thing that moveth upon the Earth
[41:42] he told them to go forth and multiply
[41:46] and and replenish the Earth just subdue
[41:48] it
[41:49] be fruitful
[41:52] many times people will look at this and
[41:54] say well yeah that was exactly the way
[41:55] God intended for it to be that it was It
[41:57] was supposed to be according to the uh
[42:00] the relation between a man and a woman
[42:02] but here when this scripture was written
[42:05] they were not separate they were one
[42:08] he hadn't even formed Man Out of the
[42:10] Dust of the earth yet in in Genesis
[42:13] chapter 1.
[42:16] we're talking about the voice of God in
[42:19] the garden
[42:21] and up until
[42:25] well Genesis chapter 3.
[42:27] Genesis chapter 2 it was it was the Lord
[42:30] God and Adam
[42:32] speaking and and when Adam spoke we know
[42:35] that God spoke
[42:37] and in verse 18 the Lord God said it's
[42:41] not good that man should be alone I'll
[42:43] make and help meet for him
[42:48] and a couple verses over and he said in
[42:50] verse 21 and the Lord God caused a deep
[42:53] sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and
[42:56] he took one of his ribs and closed up
[42:58] the flesh instead thereof
[43:00] and the rib which the Lord had taken
[43:03] from man
[43:04] he a woman and brought her unto the man
[43:08] and Adam said this is now bone of my
[43:11] bones
[43:12] and Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be
[43:15] called woman because she was taken out
[43:18] of man
[43:21] and verse 24 therefore shall a man leave
[43:24] his father and his mother and shall
[43:25] cleave unto his wife and they shall be
[43:28] one flesh
[43:31] and we know verse 25 says then they were
[43:33] both naked
[43:35] the man and his wife
[43:37] and they weren't ashamed
[43:39] and the reason they weren't ashamed is
[43:41] because they had a holy Veil
[43:43] brother Branham says it very clearly
[43:45] they had the mind of Christ
[43:48] they were not defiled they were still in
[43:50] that absolute perfect environment that
[43:53] one that we long for
[43:55] that one that we we groan to see all
[43:58] creation groaning for the manifestation
[44:00] of the sons of God
[44:03] but they were there and and they just
[44:06] didn't understand the way things were
[44:08] but in in in chapter three there's a
[44:12] major change that happens in the garden
[44:14] it goes from being the voice of God the
[44:17] voice of God in his son which is
[44:20] basically the voice of God to being
[44:22] another voice in the garden
[44:25] that other voice is now one of the
[44:27] beasts of the field
[44:29] has taken on a voice
[44:32] Genesis chapter 3 has two more voices
[44:35] introduced actually because in Genesis
[44:38] chapter 2 it was only God and his son
[44:41] Adam but in Genesis chapter 3 now it's
[44:44] the serpent
[44:46] and the woman
[44:48] now both of those have a voice in the
[44:50] garden
[44:52] how did that happen
[44:55] we know how it happened it was God's
[44:57] plan
[44:58] but we can just go on and read a little
[44:59] bit in in Genesis chapter 3 just to sort
[45:03] of explain this in in Genesis chapter 3
[45:06] verse one now the serpent
[45:08] was more subtle than any beast of the
[45:11] field which the Lord God had made
[45:15] and he said unto the woman yea hath God
[45:18] said ye shall not eat of the every tree
[45:21] of the garden
[45:24] we can just pause there and talk about
[45:25] this verse for a little bit
[45:29] the serpent in the garden I'm just
[45:32] probably going to say it bluntly and
[45:34] plainly for everyone because we all know
[45:36] it the serpent in the garden wasn't a
[45:39] snake
[45:41] there was curses handed out and that was
[45:43] the curse for the serpent
[45:46] but how could the snake be cursed to be
[45:48] a snake
[45:49] to remain itself
[45:52] we know that brother Branham taught very
[45:53] clearly that the serpent was an upright
[45:55] being
[45:57] that it had all the attributes of of the
[46:00] human except for a soul
[46:01] and it was a servant it was a help
[46:04] for the man
[46:07] but now
[46:09] Satan
[46:10] who is actually introduced in the garden
[46:13] goes and speaks to the woman through the
[46:16] serpent
[46:17] now Satan has a voice in the garden
[46:21] in this pure State as soon as the
[46:23] serpent spoke that state was defiled
[46:28] but it didn't have to be but it was
[46:32] why because Eve actually listened to
[46:35] that word she listened to that voice
[46:37] instead of listening to the voice that
[46:40] gave her Redemption which was her
[46:42] husband's voice
[46:45] she listened to the serpent
[46:47] she actually gave ear to it and reasoned
[46:50] with it
[46:51] so the serpent he speaks to Eve
[46:54] and says yay hath God said ye shall not
[46:57] eat of every tree of the garden
[47:00] how did this beast of the field know
[47:02] this
[47:03] how did he even understand any of this
[47:08] verse 2 and the woman said unto the
[47:10] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[47:12] Trees of the garden
[47:14] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[47:16] the midst of the garden God hath said
[47:18] You shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[47:21] touch it lest ye shall die
[47:26] we know that it was God speaking right
[47:28] up until this time and now the voice has
[47:31] changed now there's that that moment in
[47:34] time that we all contend with Satan
[47:37] hasn't changed his tactics brothers and
[47:39] sisters it's exactly the same way he'll
[47:42] come around and he'll try and reason
[47:44] with us about anything in our lives
[47:46] that's going to be anything to do with
[47:48] the word anything just to get us tripped
[47:50] up it doesn't matter what it is he'll
[47:51] come around and he'll try and reason
[47:53] with us and if we just take one second
[47:55] and reason with him and allow his
[47:58] thought to actually take a hold so that
[48:00] we'll have a mental conversation with
[48:02] him we begin that reasoning technique
[48:05] and he has potential now to have a
[48:08] conversation with us who wants to have a
[48:10] conversation with Satan I certainly
[48:13] don't
[48:14] but he hasn't changed his tactic not one
[48:16] bit he'll come around and he'll say yay
[48:19] sure as the message really said that
[48:22] did the prophet really mean it that way
[48:24] does the word really mean it that way is
[48:26] it you know there's got to be another
[48:27] way that we can do things and and and
[48:29] whatever some sort of reasoning
[48:32] something different something contrary
[48:34] to the word but we know we read it
[48:36] earlier brother Bradham says in the
[48:37] invisible Union of the Bride if we mix
[48:39] anything anything do with the word
[48:41] anything with the message of the hour
[48:42] it's it's adultery it's going to cause
[48:45] death it's not going to cause the right
[48:47] thing and we know where we're going with
[48:48] this discussion right now this story
[48:50] because she gives in because she reasons
[48:54] she's deceived Eve is deceived and so
[48:57] she goes and partakes now of of of this
[49:01] situation with the serpent and and I'm
[49:04] not going to get into it too much but
[49:06] I'm just going to say this she has a
[49:08] relation with with the serpent and it
[49:11] causes a terrible situation and the only
[49:13] Escape she has for it is to run to her
[49:16] husband
[49:18] and get Redemption
[49:20] that's the only Escape she has for this
[49:22] moment in her life and she realizes it
[49:26] and we know that that's the only act
[49:29] that's named in the Bible
[49:31] and there's two kids that come from it
[49:34] and there's actually a word I looked it
[49:36] up brother Mervin actually said it I
[49:38] think in Lethbridge
[49:39] it's it's super fukun
[49:43] dation I think
[49:45] I probably worded it wrong but there's
[49:47] actually a term for it
[49:49] where there can be
[49:51] two separate fathers and two separate
[49:53] children
[49:54] with the same woman
[49:56] it's actually a scientific term and it's
[49:59] real
[50:00] but that's what happened here in the
[50:02] garden
[50:04] the woman said unto the serpent we may
[50:06] eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[50:07] garden but the fruit of the tree which
[50:09] is in the midst of the garden God has
[50:11] said he shall not eat it neither shall
[50:13] ye touch it lest ye shall die and the
[50:16] serpent said unto the woman ye shall not
[50:18] surely die for God doth know that in the
[50:21] day you eat thereof then your eyes shall
[50:23] be open and ye shall be as Gods knowing
[50:26] Good and Evil
[50:28] so here the serpent tells her that you
[50:30] will be exactly what you are she is a
[50:32] God
[50:33] right now
[50:36] but because she reasoned with him
[50:39] she was deceived into thinking that she
[50:41] would be something different
[50:44] and so in that moment when the woman saw
[50:46] that the tree was good for food and it
[50:47] was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to
[50:49] be desired one to make one wise she took
[50:53] the fruit thereof and did eat and gave
[50:55] also unto her husband with her and he
[50:57] did eat and we just mentioned how it all
[50:59] sort of happened in in a less
[51:02] descriptive way but really what I want
[51:04] to talk about is not so much the ACT
[51:06] other than the actual taking of those
[51:08] words and taking those words into her
[51:11] innermost being it was the word that she
[51:14] took in and when she took in that word
[51:16] she consumed that word and the Bible
[51:18] isn't Wrong by saying that it was a
[51:20] fruit it was a fruit of Destruction that
[51:22] she took in and ate but it's got the
[51:25] entire world tripped up according to
[51:27] God's plan to say that it's fruit so
[51:29] people will say that it's any kind of
[51:31] fruit except for what it really was
[51:34] but it's it's that word that she took
[51:36] into her life that word that she
[51:38] accepted that word that deceived her
[51:41] that word that that that entered in and
[51:44] caused the fall of mankind
[51:47] it was that word
[51:50] from this new voice in the garden
[51:54] and brothers and sisters Satan wants us
[51:56] to
[51:57] not see when that word comes around into
[52:00] our Gardens
[52:02] we know that we're supposed to create a
[52:04] holy atmosphere in our lives that we are
[52:07] the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[52:10] and and and we have the opportunity to
[52:13] create create we are creators
[52:16] in our own selves if we have the Holy
[52:20] Ghost in our lives
[52:21] we have the creative ability to set the
[52:25] atmosphere
[52:26] to not be deceived
[52:30] but you know Eve she reasoned
[52:34] and and she let that voice come into her
[52:37] heart
[52:39] Paul has said it very clearly that we
[52:41] need to take every thought into
[52:43] captivity where do thoughts come from
[52:45] from voices
[52:47] people will say you're crazy if you hear
[52:49] voices every one of us hear voices and
[52:52] we hear the voice of the tree of
[52:54] knowledge of Good and Evil because of
[52:55] the fall and we hear the voice
[52:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives
[53:00] and every single human being I believe
[53:02] has the opportunity to listen to it
[53:04] everyone gets the opportunity to even
[53:07] Cain who was of his father the devil had
[53:10] the opportunity to hear the voice of God
[53:14] but he wouldn't hear it he couldn't hear
[53:16] it even though he heard it with his ears
[53:19] he would not hear it with his heart
[53:21] and and we know that whole story
[53:24] but whose voice do we listen to that
[53:26] makes the difference in our lives and
[53:27] that's really what I wanted to get to
[53:29] and and so we go on in verse 7 of
[53:32] chapter three and the eyes of them both
[53:34] were opened now that veil was lifted
[53:38] that Holy veil was gone
[53:41] and something really significant
[53:43] happened here that veil was lifted but
[53:45] also the creative voice in The Son of
[53:48] God in Adam was now gone he forfeited
[53:51] his right to that voice that creative
[53:54] power
[53:55] of God in his life and that voice left
[53:57] Adam and now went right back to God
[53:59] again
[54:00] his creative ability his godship was now
[54:04] gone
[54:07] and they heard the voice
[54:09] of the Lord God walking in the garden
[54:12] in the cool of the day
[54:14] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[54:16] walking
[54:18] in the garden in the cool of the day
[54:22] how do you hear a voice walking
[54:25] maybe the Lord was singing
[54:27] but we know that he was crying
[54:30] he wasn't crying he was just calling out
[54:32] as a figurative word crying he was
[54:34] calling out Adam
[54:37] what are you doing where are you
[54:41] where are you at Adam
[54:43] because he knew full well where Adam was
[54:45] he wasn't asking are you behind a tree
[54:48] are you behind a rock are you in a cave
[54:51] are you are you on the other side of the
[54:53] garden he wasn't asking any of that he
[54:55] was saying where'd you go Adam you fell
[54:57] from Grace you actually forfeited that
[55:00] creative power that sonship that
[55:02] adoption that you had that I gave you
[55:04] from the beginning you forfeited it back
[55:07] to me
[55:08] you gave it back why did you do that
[55:12] and so he comes and has a conversation
[55:14] with them and what happens immediately
[55:16] it's a finger-pointing contest oh the
[55:19] woman that you gave me she's the one
[55:20] that did it and and she says oh you know
[55:22] the serpent that one who was in the
[55:23] garden that you put there and if try and
[55:25] put it back on God could you imagine we
[55:27] talked about that a while ago trying to
[55:28] put it back on God and say it's your
[55:30] fault you did this
[55:33] brother Bradham says it somewhere that
[55:36] outside of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[55:37] we are brute beasts just like the beasts
[55:41] of the field just like the serpent he
[55:42] might not say it that way but just like
[55:44] these animals we we are without the Holy
[55:47] Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters
[55:48] we don't have any hope we have that
[55:50] hybrid condition going on in our lives
[55:52] that's why the world hungers and thirsts
[55:54] so much after unrighteousness that's why
[55:56] it's such a dark place because that
[55:58] voice of Satan is so
[56:01] prominent in the world
[56:04] so many people speak the voice of Satan
[56:07] it just becomes one voice it becomes
[56:09] this this great mass of darkness and and
[56:12] here we are speaking the voice of God
[56:16] but you know as that voice grows
[56:17] stronger of Satan so does a voice in The
[56:20] Bride so does that voice in The Bride of
[56:22] Jesus Christ and where we're coming to
[56:24] the punch line that we always do before
[56:26] it's time is you know what the word is
[56:28] in the bride she has the mind of Christ
[56:31] and she knows what to do with it because
[56:33] that's what the prophet was sent to tell
[56:34] her it's not just brother branham's
[56:37] opinion saying that it's not just his
[56:39] opinion saying pick up your pen and
[56:40] write it's not just his opinion saying
[56:42] that she has the mind of Christ and
[56:45] knows what to do with the word she has
[56:47] thus saith the Lord
[56:50] or she keeps still and you know what
[56:52] there's people that want to keep still
[56:53] sadly but there's other people that say
[56:56] I've got the voice of God and the mind
[56:58] of Christ in my heart I know that I have
[57:01] thus saith the Lord I believe the word
[57:03] I've met the requirements of the of the
[57:05] word for our day I believe everything
[57:06] that the prophet said about me and the
[57:09] word so what do I have to fear speak the
[57:12] word God doesn't want us to come to him
[57:14] crying Lord please Lord Give Me Lord I
[57:17] need he wants us to speak the word why
[57:19] cry speak and walk forward and watch him
[57:23] bless your path
[57:25] but if we have anything that we're
[57:26] dragging behind us in terms of a a a a
[57:29] an old tradition or an old
[57:31] denominational thing in our lives we're
[57:33] trying to mix it with the word for our
[57:35] day brother Branham said it's it's
[57:37] adultery spiritual adultery and God
[57:39] won't know us
[57:41] we don't want to do that we want to make
[57:43] sure that we have it all right all clean
[57:45] clean slate go right back to Eden
[57:48] Brothers and Sisters right back to the
[57:50] very beginning and you know we we
[57:52] sometimes have things in our lives where
[57:54] we step over Flags
[57:56] we do and we know we do
[58:00] sometimes we'll just say oh it's just a
[58:02] funny feeling
[58:04] brother Branham says it in that message
[58:06] God will not call a man to judgment
[58:08] without first warning him
[58:09] he says that God deals with every single
[58:12] man before he dies
[58:15] and and men will say you know that that
[58:17] was just a funny feeling
[58:20] God speaks to us
[58:22] we need to make sure that we're
[58:23] listening to the right voice
[58:25] that's that's probably the the main
[58:27] point for today whose voice are we
[58:30] listening to
[58:33] in the garden
[58:35] it was either God or Adam speaking then
[58:38] it became the serpent and Eve speaking
[58:44] and you know
[58:47] Adam
[58:48] he had all the creativity creative
[58:51] ability of God he was an amateur God
[58:56] and that's what the prophet said we are
[58:59] it's pretty tough to visualize that in
[59:02] our own flesh to say that we are but it
[59:04] really comes down to whose voice are we
[59:07] listening to and whose voice are we
[59:09] being whose voice are we allowing to
[59:13] speak from our lips through our our
[59:15] lungs through our voice box what is it
[59:18] that we're actually putting out there
[59:19] because if we are amateur Gods we are
[59:23] creating every time we speak
[59:30] the Lord called unto Adam and said unto
[59:32] him where art thou verse 9 verse 10 and
[59:35] he said I heard thy voice in the garden
[59:37] and I was afraid because I was naked
[59:39] and I hid myself
[59:42] and he said who told thee that thou was
[59:45] naked
[59:47] cast out Eden of the tree whereof I
[59:50] commanded thee that thou shouldest not
[59:52] eat
[59:54] and the man said the woman who thou gave
[59:56] us to be with me
[59:58] she gave me of the tree and I did eat
[1:00:02] and the Lord God said unto the woman
[1:00:04] what is this thou Hast done
[1:00:06] and the woman said the serpent beguiled
[1:00:09] me and I did eat
[1:00:11] and the Lord said unto the serpent
[1:00:12] because thou Hast done this Thou Art
[1:00:14] cursed above all the cattle and above
[1:00:16] every beast of the field upon thy belly
[1:00:18] shalt thou go in dust
[1:00:21] shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
[1:00:26] and if this wasn't exactly what we know
[1:00:28] to be the truth why would this verse be
[1:00:31] there and I will put enmity between thee
[1:00:34] and the woman and between thy seed and
[1:00:36] her seed
[1:00:38] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[1:00:40] shalt bruise thy heel
[1:00:44] unto the woman he said I will greatly
[1:00:46] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[1:00:49] in sorrow
[1:00:51] Thou shalt bring forth children and thy
[1:00:53] desire shall be to thy husband and he
[1:00:55] shall rule over thee
[1:00:57] and that scripture right there is a real
[1:00:59] contentious one today
[1:01:01] boy oh boy just a back part of it the
[1:01:03] the end of it
[1:01:05] that the husband shall rule over thee
[1:01:09] even even now with the word of our day
[1:01:13] there's still such a strong spirit for
[1:01:16] the woman to be strong and the woman to
[1:01:19] have a voice and the woman to be able to
[1:01:23] use serp Authority in this world
[1:01:25] and you know
[1:01:27] it's it's a strong strong spirit and and
[1:01:30] we cannot really Escape it even with
[1:01:33] people that we deal with
[1:01:35] because it's there
[1:01:37] people hate that scripture right there
[1:01:41] not just dislike it but hate it
[1:01:44] because it it it it says that man shall
[1:01:48] rule over the woman
[1:01:49] and at now to Adam he said because thou
[1:01:52] has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife
[1:01:55] and not me
[1:01:57] because you gave in to that voice
[1:02:03] and asked each and of the tree of which
[1:02:05] I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not
[1:02:07] eat of it cursed is the ground for thy
[1:02:10] sake
[1:02:12] in sorrow shout out eat of it all the
[1:02:14] days of thy life
[1:02:16] to think about it though the serpent was
[1:02:19] cursed the woman was cursed but Adam was
[1:02:21] not cursed the ground was cursed for his
[1:02:24] sake
[1:02:27] for years I thought that I was cursed
[1:02:30] but I'm not
[1:02:31] I'm not cursed I'm blessed
[1:02:34] the ground is cursed for my sake
[1:02:37] I don't have to walk around dragging a
[1:02:39] ball and chain every time something bad
[1:02:40] happens to me thinking that God cursed
[1:02:42] me he didn't curse me he released me
[1:02:45] from the curse he released me from the
[1:02:47] bondage of sin
[1:02:49] and the same thing for every one of us
[1:02:51] we don't have to worry that we're cursed
[1:02:54] we're not cursed
[1:02:55] the woman or the man we do bear
[1:02:59] the fruit of the Fall we have to go to
[1:03:01] work and and by the sweat on our face we
[1:03:03] will actually bring home a living as men
[1:03:06] and in sorrow and in conception will
[1:03:09] woman bring forth children
[1:03:12] there's no way around it it's the
[1:03:14] scripture
[1:03:15] but for me this this whole study just
[1:03:17] really brought this to light and and
[1:03:19] I'll say it I'll be the first to say it
[1:03:21] initially when I was coming into the you
[1:03:24] know we're we're gonna try and figure
[1:03:26] out how it is to run the church thing I
[1:03:28] had said that we could have the women
[1:03:30] speak in church and that was wrong it
[1:03:33] was wrong
[1:03:35] but by seeing it this way it actually
[1:03:36] spells it out so clearly and I'm so
[1:03:39] thankful that the Lord will actually
[1:03:40] reveal things to us if we ask him
[1:03:44] I need a scriptural solution can you
[1:03:46] show me in your word how this this
[1:03:47] really works and you know the voice of
[1:03:50] Eve
[1:03:52] wasn't supposed to be the way it was
[1:03:55] she was supposed to submit to her
[1:03:57] husband
[1:03:58] the husband was the one who was in
[1:03:59] control there in the garden husband was
[1:04:01] the one with the voice
[1:04:03] not that they didn't communicate and
[1:04:05] that he didn't love her Adam didn't make
[1:04:07] her adore Matt at the edge of the garden
[1:04:10] so he could wipe his feet on her she
[1:04:12] wasn't his slave
[1:04:14] she she wasn't there to do every single
[1:04:17] thing that he wanted to have done
[1:04:18] although because of the love that he
[1:04:21] displayed to her I bet you it caused
[1:04:23] something in her for her realization
[1:04:25] that she came out of him that she was a
[1:04:27] part of him she just couldn't get enough
[1:04:30] goodness to her husband she just wanted
[1:04:33] to help him to serve him with all of her
[1:04:36] heart because of the way he loved her
[1:04:38] which is exactly according to the word
[1:04:40] she had such a reverence for him because
[1:04:43] of his undefiled pure love for her
[1:04:47] and that's exactly what what the word
[1:04:49] lays out for husbands and wives
[1:04:53] but you know it's a very difficult thing
[1:04:54] because many times we can get things out
[1:04:56] of order in our lives we can get things
[1:04:58] sort of out of kilter and we can have
[1:05:02] husbands and wives be at odds and we can
[1:05:04] have the wife say I I don't have to
[1:05:07] respect that I don't have to do that
[1:05:08] because he he hasn't given me anything
[1:05:10] to respect
[1:05:12] and I'm so thankful for a pastor that
[1:05:14] taught it you know what that's not what
[1:05:15] the word says the word doesn't say
[1:05:17] that's conditional
[1:05:18] she has got to respect reverence her
[1:05:21] husband
[1:05:22] but husbands have got to love their
[1:05:26] wives if they don't love their wives if
[1:05:28] they're not willing to be the one just
[1:05:29] like Adam to redeem his wife
[1:05:33] when she needs it how is she going to
[1:05:35] reverence him
[1:05:37] we have to be husbands in our home I
[1:05:40] believe the Lord is really opening this
[1:05:41] up to me and I'm so thankful
[1:05:44] it speaks of headship speaks of
[1:05:46] understanding the order of things that
[1:05:49] God is in control Christ the head of the
[1:05:51] church the head of the husband
[1:05:55] the husband the head of the home
[1:05:58] the wife the head of the children not
[1:06:00] the other way around the children are
[1:06:02] not the head of the home
[1:06:03] no
[1:06:05] it can easily get spun that way that's
[1:06:07] the way the world is
[1:06:09] the voice of Eve was not really the way
[1:06:12] it was supposed to be in the garden
[1:06:15] and in first Timothy chapter 2
[1:06:18] verse 11 it says let the woman learn in
[1:06:20] Silence with all subjection
[1:06:23] but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to
[1:06:25] your serp authority over the man but to
[1:06:28] be in silence
[1:06:30] and I just love how he goes right back
[1:06:32] to the beginning right back to the
[1:06:33] exactly where we're reading from he says
[1:06:36] in verse 13 of SEC of First Timothy yeah
[1:06:39] first Timothy
[1:06:41] chapter 2 verse 13 for Adam was first
[1:06:45] formed then Eve
[1:06:48] and Adam was not deceived but the woman
[1:06:50] being deceived was in the transgression
[1:06:55] but Adam chose to actually redeem her
[1:06:58] Adam chose willingly to go after his
[1:07:01] bride and we know that that's been said
[1:07:04] so many times that it's exactly the same
[1:07:06] thing for Christ to travel through the
[1:07:08] ages and come for his bride and every
[1:07:11] time we hear the word preach it doesn't
[1:07:13] matter who preaches it if they're
[1:07:14] preaching the word in truth it's Christ
[1:07:16] coming for his bride that word that life
[1:07:20] that light that we talked about that we
[1:07:22] can't see that light that happened
[1:07:23] before the actual moon and the sun
[1:07:26] happened that Supernatural light that's
[1:07:29] off the spectrum that we could visualize
[1:07:31] with our senses that light that life is
[1:07:34] speaking out that's Christ coming
[1:07:35] through the ages for his bride
[1:07:38] verse 15 says notwithstanding she shall
[1:07:41] be saved speaking about the woman now
[1:07:43] the one who is in the transgression she
[1:07:46] shall be saved in childbearing
[1:07:50] by bearing children that shall save her
[1:07:52] if they continue in faith and charity
[1:07:55] and Holiness with sobriety
[1:07:59] but wasn't child bearing the curse for
[1:08:01] the woman
[1:08:03] it's amazing when you look at this
[1:08:07] it really is for me it's just it's just
[1:08:09] yeah it's opened up a lot for me
[1:08:12] but to look at it she is saved through
[1:08:14] childbirth
[1:08:16] by giving Offspring to her husband
[1:08:21] by being
[1:08:22] truly there a part of the relationship
[1:08:26] in Genesis 3 16
[1:08:29] . greatly I will multiply thy sorrow and
[1:08:31] conception
[1:08:33] in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[1:08:35] children it is not easy to have kids
[1:08:39] but you know what it speaks of it speaks
[1:08:41] of the restoration the restoration of
[1:08:43] the Bride tree that one tree in the
[1:08:46] Garden of Eden and brother Bradham said
[1:08:48] it in a quote we read I said that it was
[1:08:50] Christ and that it was Satan brother
[1:08:52] Branham said that it was Christ and Eve
[1:08:55] in that quote
[1:08:57] I'm not going to go back and read it but
[1:08:59] what I am going to say is that it wasn't
[1:09:01] a problem until she actually partook of
[1:09:03] that fruit until she partook of those
[1:09:05] words that were spoken to her she took
[1:09:07] those words in from that voice that
[1:09:10] other voice she listened hearkened onto
[1:09:12] another voice and when she did that she
[1:09:15] became the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:09:18] Evil she became the tree of death is
[1:09:20] what brother Branham said
[1:09:22] but we're talking about the restoration
[1:09:24] of the Bride tree through childbearing
[1:09:27] she shall be saved
[1:09:31] and how does that happen it's it's in
[1:09:33] the invisible Union of the Bride of
[1:09:35] Jesus Christ by taking that word in from
[1:09:38] the right voice not taken the word from
[1:09:40] the denomination not taking the word
[1:09:42] from the pastor not taking the word from
[1:09:45] Mom and Dad not taking the word from
[1:09:47] anyone else but take in that word which
[1:09:49] was spoken by the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:09:52] by taking the word that's spoken when we
[1:09:54] read the word for our day and realize
[1:09:56] that the Bible and and the message of
[1:09:58] the hour they say the same thing then
[1:10:01] the spirit and the bride they are all
[1:10:03] talk in the same language they're saying
[1:10:05] that Heavenly language
[1:10:08] they're saying come Lord Jesus
[1:10:12] in Hebrews let's turn over to the book
[1:10:14] of Hebrews chapter 10.
[1:10:18] Hebrews chapter 10.
[1:10:27] we'll start reading with verse 11.
[1:10:34] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 11 and every
[1:10:37] priest standeth daily ministering and
[1:10:39] offering often times the same sacrifices
[1:10:42] which can never take away sins
[1:10:45] speaking of the Old Testament priests
[1:10:47] here
[1:10:48] but this man
[1:10:50] Jesus after he had offered one sacrifice
[1:10:54] for the sins
[1:10:55] forever
[1:10:57] sat down on the right hand of God
[1:11:00] from henceforth expecting
[1:11:02] till his enemies be made his footstool
[1:11:07] for by one offering he hath perfected
[1:11:10] forever them that are Sanctified is
[1:11:13] anybody here Sanctified today
[1:11:15] whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness
[1:11:18] to us for after that he had said before
[1:11:22] this is the Covenant that I will make
[1:11:25] with them after those days saith the
[1:11:28] Lord I will put my laws into their
[1:11:31] hearts and in their minds will I write
[1:11:33] them and their sins and iniquities will
[1:11:36] I remember no more
[1:11:38] now where remission of these is there
[1:11:41] was no more offering for sin
[1:11:43] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[1:11:46] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[1:11:48] Jesus and by a New and Living Way which
[1:11:51] he hath consecrated for us through the
[1:11:54] veil that is to say his flesh
[1:11:58] and having a high priest over the house
[1:12:00] of God let us draw near with a true
[1:12:02] heart and full Assurance of Faith having
[1:12:04] our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:12:07] conscience and our bodies washed with
[1:12:10] pure water
[1:12:12] understanding that the way back has been
[1:12:16] made through Christ
[1:12:18] has has already paid it all Satan wants
[1:12:22] us to believe that we've got iniquity
[1:12:24] that we've got sin that we've got all
[1:12:27] these things but the prophet for our day
[1:12:29] simply said you never even did it
[1:12:31] you have the ability to listen to the
[1:12:33] word to listen to The Prophet The
[1:12:35] Prophet wasn't just a prophet and and
[1:12:37] and and and taking his opinion and
[1:12:39] offering it out there he said she has
[1:12:42] thus saith the Lord he said you're the
[1:12:44] sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus
[1:12:46] Christ you never did it in the first
[1:12:48] place we bypassed our theophanese to
[1:12:51] come down here and be proven but how
[1:12:53] could we ever succeed if we don't
[1:12:56] understand that he paid it all and
[1:12:58] because he paid it all we have a clean
[1:13:01] conscience that we just read so we can
[1:13:03] draw near with a True Heart in full
[1:13:05] Assurance not wavering in our faith not
[1:13:08] having any fear not thinking that I did
[1:13:11] something yesterday and I might do
[1:13:12] something tomorrow and and and and and
[1:13:14] and and and no he settled it all he paid
[1:13:17] the price brothers and sisters when we
[1:13:19] come to that place where that voice is
[1:13:22] the voice that we listen to that voice
[1:13:24] is the one that we partake of in our
[1:13:26] lives that's the voice that's going to
[1:13:28] give us the liberty to know that there's
[1:13:30] going to be a time where we're going
[1:13:31] we're just going to get so carried away
[1:13:33] we're going to get carried away that the
[1:13:35] Revelation that that these bodies have
[1:13:36] to contain just won't be able to contain
[1:13:38] it anymore
[1:13:41] we've got a full Assurance of faith
[1:13:44] because he paid it all
[1:13:47] and this is where it gets into
[1:13:49] Melchizedek our high priest
[1:13:53] and and I'm sorry for jumping around but
[1:13:55] I just had to take this little detour
[1:13:58] and talk about this how important it is
[1:14:01] to recognize the voice how important it
[1:14:04] is to recognize the jot and the Tittle
[1:14:06] in the scripture and and not read it
[1:14:08] like it's a newspaper and just allow the
[1:14:11] Lord to give us Revelation to speak to
[1:14:13] our hearts so that when we read it we
[1:14:15] hear his voice speak to us it has to be
[1:14:18] his voice speaking to us I can say it I
[1:14:22] can preach it but until it comes becomes
[1:14:24] a personal thing to the individual it's
[1:14:27] just my voice it's just me and don't
[1:14:30] take my voice for it it has to be the
[1:14:32] Holy Ghost Inside the individual
[1:14:34] I was so encouraged to hear the brother
[1:14:37] that I had mentioned brother Fergus
[1:14:39] Howard
[1:14:40] he's on a journey and I was able to meet
[1:14:43] with him it was so wonderful to get
[1:14:45] together he's 25 years old and just has
[1:14:47] a hunger for the Lord and and I said is
[1:14:50] there anything I can do for you and he
[1:14:52] said I just want Fellowship around real
[1:14:54] Believers and I just want to get
[1:14:56] baptized because I want to get rid of
[1:14:58] the old and get on with the new and I
[1:15:00] just said my God bless you brother we're
[1:15:03] here to help
[1:15:04] what a tremendous thing it is when we
[1:15:07] get that Revelation when we start to
[1:15:08] listen to the right voice
[1:15:10] and we don't give that serpent any room
[1:15:12] in our lives
[1:15:13] and and we don't try and get things out
[1:15:15] of kilter in our lives I don't think we
[1:15:18] try to get things out of kilter but
[1:15:19] sometimes we don't try not to get things
[1:15:22] out of kilter in our lives and we know
[1:15:23] the word says that a double-minded man
[1:15:25] is unstable in all of his ways I say
[1:15:28] Lord help me I don't want to be a
[1:15:30] double-minded man I want to just
[1:15:31] continually try and talk about the voice
[1:15:34] of the word for our day I want to try
[1:15:36] and and think about these things I want
[1:15:38] to try and speak about these things I
[1:15:40] don't want to speak about covet in the
[1:15:42] problem I want to talk about the
[1:15:43] solution the the great inoculation of
[1:15:46] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives it doesn't
[1:15:48] matter Mark 16 says that if we drink any
[1:15:51] deadly thing it shall not harm us so
[1:15:54] what do we have to fear brothers and
[1:15:55] sisters
[1:15:57] what do we have to fear but fear itself
[1:15:59] that voice of the serpent coming around
[1:16:01] and saying well you know maybe you could
[1:16:03] get kovid
[1:16:04] I want to be real clear I'm not afraid
[1:16:06] of covid and I don't think that any one
[1:16:07] of us should be afraid of covid because
[1:16:09] really if it is something that's bad and
[1:16:11] if we get it and we die we win if we're
[1:16:15] in Christ I'm not saying that we should
[1:16:17] go and jump off a bridge that's not what
[1:16:19] I'm saying at all I'm saying that we
[1:16:20] should not let fear be the motivator
[1:16:23] let the word be the motivator in our
[1:16:25] lives speak the word and go forwards and
[1:16:29] watch the Devils move they have to in
[1:16:31] Jesus name they don't have an option
[1:16:33] sometimes I feel like Devils maybe
[1:16:36] they've got the option to move maybe
[1:16:38] it's because of that scripture where the
[1:16:40] disciples who were ordained by God to go
[1:16:42] out two by two to cast out devils and
[1:16:44] heal the sick and raise the Dead
[1:16:46] those disciples they came across the one
[1:16:48] with epilepsy and they couldn't cast out
[1:16:50] that devil and they they the dad brought
[1:16:52] it to Jesus and said what's wrong with
[1:16:54] your guys your boys they were anointed
[1:16:56] but they can't touch this one
[1:16:59] and he grown within himself brothers and
[1:17:01] sisters we have been restored all the
[1:17:03] way back all Seven Seals have been
[1:17:05] opened the one who says that a devil has
[1:17:08] the opportunity to have a hold
[1:17:10] I don't know are all the seals open
[1:17:12] maybe maybe not
[1:17:16] but we have the ability
[1:17:18] to have boldness confidence a full
[1:17:21] Assurance we just read in the word to
[1:17:23] know
[1:17:24] that we have faith in our hearts
[1:17:28] the ability to speak the word
[1:17:31] to push back on the devil we've been
[1:17:33] ordained
[1:17:34] to be the Bride of Jesus Christ we have
[1:17:37] authority
[1:17:38] we don't we don't have to be beat up by
[1:17:41] Devils we don't have to be pushed around
[1:17:44] we don't know what God's will is for our
[1:17:45] lives we don't know what his plan is for
[1:17:47] our lives
[1:17:48] and ultimately
[1:17:50] as as the bride would say
[1:17:54] honey
[1:17:56] not my will
[1:17:58] but thy will be done
[1:18:00] because I know that you know best honey
[1:18:03] I I reverence you because you love me so
[1:18:06] much because you have such a love for me
[1:18:08] because you would lay down your life you
[1:18:11] would say I'll walk out of the Garden of
[1:18:13] Eden out of this perfect condition for
[1:18:16] you
[1:18:17] so that you could be saved
[1:18:20] can you imagine that love story brothers
[1:18:22] and sisters are we that way for our
[1:18:24] wives
[1:18:27] you hear stories about men just looking
[1:18:29] for an excuse to put their wives away
[1:18:31] that's not the spirit of Christ
[1:18:35] it's not
[1:18:38] if we could have that kind of love for
[1:18:39] our wives
[1:18:40] my goodness
[1:18:46] you know Melchizedek
[1:18:48] he came out to see Abraham
[1:18:51] serve him communion
[1:18:54] after the battle
[1:18:56] after the slaughter of the Kings
[1:18:59] and I've seen it myself a few times now
[1:19:02] when the spiritual battle hits real hard
[1:19:05] because it does
[1:19:07] it's after the battle
[1:19:09] that Melchizedek comes around
[1:19:11] and he serves the bread and the wine
[1:19:14] he serves the the word the body of
[1:19:16] Christ and and the wine that causes the
[1:19:19] stimulation of the Revelation from the
[1:19:21] word it's after the battle brothers and
[1:19:23] sisters after we go and we have to fight
[1:19:26] hard on our knees and fight through all
[1:19:28] the Devils it's not before
[1:19:32] he lets us go right into the midst of
[1:19:34] the fire and that's where he comes
[1:19:36] through the battle
[1:19:39] but he is our high priest
[1:19:42] and he always comes
[1:19:44] we just need to keep pressing on
[1:19:48] in verse 23 of Hebrews chapter 10 let us
[1:19:50] hold fast the profession of our faith
[1:19:53] without wavering
[1:19:56] because he is faithful that promised
[1:20:00] is he faithful
[1:20:04] hold fast the profession of our faith
[1:20:07] without wavering
[1:20:08] you know Abraham
[1:20:10] he considered not
[1:20:13] the condition that he was in he
[1:20:15] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:20:16] through unbelief even though probably
[1:20:18] all of his servants probably told him he
[1:20:20] was crazy
[1:20:22] and and the people around him said
[1:20:23] really seriously you've got this promise
[1:20:25] coming
[1:20:26] he must have looked like an absolute
[1:20:28] lunatic to the world around him and then
[1:20:30] when he finally got the promise
[1:20:32] he said now God told me to go and kill
[1:20:34] him
[1:20:35] can you imagine that
[1:20:39] but he did it because he understood
[1:20:43] he held fast to the profession of his
[1:20:44] faith without wavering
[1:20:48] he didn't waver in it
[1:20:51] because he is faithful that promised us
[1:20:56] we know the next few scriptures here
[1:20:58] verse 24 and 25 let us consider one
[1:21:01] another to provoke unto love and to Good
[1:21:04] Works
[1:21:06] when we talk to our brothers and our
[1:21:08] sisters
[1:21:10] we're talking to the Bride of Jesus
[1:21:12] Christ
[1:21:15] can you imagine that what would it be
[1:21:17] like
[1:21:18] to maybe time travel and go and talk to
[1:21:20] Esther
[1:21:22] after she was Queen
[1:21:25] can you imagine that anything that she
[1:21:27] wanted to the half of the Kingdom
[1:21:31] the king would have given her
[1:21:33] and here we are
[1:21:35] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:38] how do we see our brothers and our
[1:21:40] sisters how do we speak about our
[1:21:43] brothers and our sisters because our
[1:21:45] brothers and our sisters they might not
[1:21:46] hear our voice they might not hear that
[1:21:49] voice that we're giving power to but God
[1:21:52] does
[1:21:53] and so does the one behind that voice
[1:21:56] we need to be certain that it's only the
[1:21:58] voice of Jesus Christ coming out of our
[1:22:00] lips when we speak about the Bride of
[1:22:03] Jesus Christ
[1:22:04] many times we could speak about somebody
[1:22:07] else in this world
[1:22:09] and not have regard for them
[1:22:12] but the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:15] wow
[1:22:19] so brothers and sisters today
[1:22:21] about quarter to 12 here whose voice are
[1:22:24] you
[1:22:26] whose voice are we given power to in our
[1:22:28] lives
[1:22:29] when we speak
[1:22:31] are we are we are we realizing that that
[1:22:34] the bride tree has been restored all the
[1:22:37] way back and we'll probably get right
[1:22:39] into all of that down the road in the
[1:22:41] future but the profit for our day to
[1:22:43] tell us that she has thus saith the Lord
[1:22:46] that she is perfect she never did it in
[1:22:48] the first place
[1:22:49] think about what Authority that gives us
[1:22:51] think about the power that we have at
[1:22:54] our disposal at our lips but so many
[1:22:57] times we're caught in this Human
[1:22:58] Condition by the by the Traditions that
[1:23:00] we've gone through the hurts that we've
[1:23:02] experienced the way people have have
[1:23:03] treated us but remember it's not people
[1:23:05] that have treated you bad if you've been
[1:23:07] treated bad it's evil spirits in people
[1:23:09] that have treated you bad your brother
[1:23:11] and your sister truly from their heart
[1:23:12] and soul would never try to treat you
[1:23:14] bad they would never try to disregard
[1:23:16] you they would only want to build you up
[1:23:18] and encourage you to exhort you even
[1:23:21] more so as they see the day approaching
[1:23:24] but whose voice are we today
[1:23:26] in second Peter verse second Peter
[1:23:29] chapter one sorry Verse 18 and this
[1:23:31] voice which came from heaven we heard
[1:23:34] and we were with him in the Holy mount
[1:23:37] we have also a more sure word of
[1:23:39] Prophecy where unto ye do well that ye
[1:23:41] take heed
[1:23:43] as unto a light
[1:23:45] that shineth in a dark place
[1:23:48] until the day Dawn and the day star
[1:23:50] arise in your hearts
[1:23:54] brothers and sisters that day star
[1:23:57] arising in our hearts the message of the
[1:24:00] hour the Lord Jesus Christ Living out
[1:24:03] through his bride his actual voice to
[1:24:06] this world the world looks at us and
[1:24:08] they see us they see human beings and
[1:24:11] most times I'll say it this way when
[1:24:14] they look at me they'll see a fail of
[1:24:16] fallible human being they'll see a
[1:24:19] wretched person who looks like they're
[1:24:21] unstable in all of their ways if you
[1:24:23] look at my natural elements the way that
[1:24:25] I am just just my my common nature human
[1:24:28] carnality yes sir that's exactly what I
[1:24:30] would look like but they don't see who
[1:24:33] is actually speaking through me they
[1:24:35] don't see the real me we've heard that
[1:24:37] said many times I don't see the real you
[1:24:39] you don't see the real me because the
[1:24:41] real you and the real me is just a
[1:24:43] little bit faster than us right now just
[1:24:45] in another dimension that theophany body
[1:24:47] it's the spirit that's inside us that we
[1:24:50] can't see we've just been given this
[1:24:51] flesh to live through
[1:24:53] but we have also a more sure word of
[1:24:56] Prophecy where unto ye do well that you
[1:24:59] take heed as unto a light that shineth
[1:25:02] in a dark place brothers and sisters as
[1:25:04] we live out our lives here speaking the
[1:25:07] voice of the Lord Jesus Christ by the
[1:25:10] Holy Spirit In Our Lives it's not
[1:25:12] another person it's the Lord Jesus
[1:25:14] Christ literally in our lives if we have
[1:25:16] his spirit and when we speak he speaks
[1:25:20] we have a more sure word of Prophecy
[1:25:23] unto this world that we shine his life
[1:25:26] as a light into the darkness the people
[1:25:29] around us the the ministry to the bride
[1:25:31] in the last age is to the total lost
[1:25:34] just like Noah's day he was preaching to
[1:25:37] the total lost
[1:25:38] the people around him probably said God
[1:25:40] bless you brother Noah you're such a
[1:25:42] good man such a fine man of God but the
[1:25:45] ark's crazy
[1:25:46] people probably say the same thing about
[1:25:48] the message of the hour and what does
[1:25:50] that matter to us follow thou hymn we
[1:25:52] need to keep pressing on
[1:25:54] there is a place a literal place that
[1:25:56] we're going to and it's never been
[1:25:58] closer brothers and sisters never ever
[1:26:01] been closer
[1:26:02] Revelations 10 verse 9 and I went unto
[1:26:06] the angel and said unto him give me the
[1:26:08] little book and he said unto me take it
[1:26:09] eat it up and it shall make thy belly
[1:26:11] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[1:26:13] sweet as honey and I took the little
[1:26:15] book out of the Angel's hand and I ate
[1:26:17] it up and it was in my mouth sweet as
[1:26:19] honey and as soon as I had eaten it my
[1:26:21] belly was bitter isn't that the message
[1:26:23] of the our brothers and sisters it
[1:26:25] sounds wonderful many times people
[1:26:27] people will say it's great but when they
[1:26:29] get it in there and they say what women
[1:26:31] can't cut their hair what a garment that
[1:26:33] pertains to a man what all these
[1:26:36] different things that we have to contend
[1:26:37] with in the natural Realm
[1:26:40] true son and daughter of God is going to
[1:26:42] say Amen when that unnatural light
[1:26:44] shines upon that seed Gene of God that
[1:26:47] was in there before the foundation of
[1:26:48] the world but you know what in our belly
[1:26:52] it actually is bitter because this flesh
[1:26:55] cannot contain it but remember we just
[1:26:57] read about that more sure word of
[1:26:59] Prophecy and he says here in verse 11
[1:27:01] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:27:03] again before many peoples and Nations
[1:27:06] and tongues and kings and remember
[1:27:08] John the Revelator here was a type of
[1:27:11] the Bride not just a prophet not just
[1:27:15] the prophet he was a type of the Bride
[1:27:18] is what the prophet for our day said and
[1:27:21] so brothers and sisters we have that
[1:27:22] creative ability in us when we have that
[1:27:24] light when we have that life living out
[1:27:27] through us when we speak it is exactly
[1:27:29] what he said here thou must prophesy
[1:27:32] again before many people's Nations
[1:27:34] tongues and Kings all of the people that
[1:27:37] we come in contact with in our lives we
[1:27:39] are prophesying we are showing them that
[1:27:42] there is truly going to be a bride there
[1:27:44] is truly going to be a resurrection and
[1:27:46] a Rapture because we live he lives also
[1:27:49] because he lives we live also it's the
[1:27:53] same thing but because he died we have
[1:27:56] the ability to rise up and understand
[1:27:58] who we are brothers and sisters
[1:28:01] it's a more sure word of Prophecy but to
[1:28:04] look at this pick up your pen and write
[1:28:06] it's no accident
[1:28:08] and I think I just get the feeling and I
[1:28:10] could be wrong but brothers and sisters
[1:28:13] it seems almost like there's a fear
[1:28:15] about that whole entire topic pick up
[1:28:17] your pen and write and I think there is
[1:28:20] and the reason there is is because it
[1:28:22] takes all the power away from Satan it
[1:28:25] exposes Satan and it gives him no power
[1:28:28] in our lives because if the word truly
[1:28:30] says that
[1:28:31] to pick up your pen and write that she
[1:28:33] has thus saith the Lord the secret is
[1:28:35] the word is in the bride and she has
[1:28:37] thus saith the Lord and the mind of
[1:28:39] Christ to know what to do with it what
[1:28:41] devil can stand before you
[1:28:43] what's devil devil can stand before me
[1:28:46] what devil could stand before a group of
[1:28:48] believers who are knit together in love
[1:28:51] what devil could stand before a family
[1:28:55] there isn't one
[1:28:58] because it doesn't matter what happens
[1:28:59] to this flesh brothers and sisters
[1:29:00] remember it doesn't matter what happens
[1:29:02] to this flesh this flesh has to perish
[1:29:04] one way or another whether we go in a
[1:29:07] body change this flesh stays here and we
[1:29:09] go and take on our new theophany bodies
[1:29:12] or whether we go to the Grave this flesh
[1:29:14] rots in the grave it doesn't matter this
[1:29:16] flesh has to rot one way or another
[1:29:18] but there ain't no devil that's going to
[1:29:20] hold us in the grave
[1:29:22] nothing is going to keep us from seeing
[1:29:24] the goal nothing is going to keep us
[1:29:25] down from achieving the position that we
[1:29:28] are ordained to be in which is truly in
[1:29:31] his throne if we overcome and what do we
[1:29:34] need to overcome brothers and sisters we
[1:29:36] don't need to overcome sin and hell and
[1:29:38] death all of that has already been
[1:29:40] overcome what we need to do is overcome
[1:29:41] our own will so we can just simply
[1:29:43] accept the fact that he did it all that
[1:29:45] he paid it all all to him I owe
[1:29:48] if we can do that
[1:29:50] we've made it
[1:29:52] we've made it
[1:29:54] let us hold fast brothers and sisters
[1:29:57] the profession of our faith without
[1:29:58] wavering
[1:30:00] without wavering knowing that when we
[1:30:02] talk
[1:30:03] it's our voice
[1:30:04] but is it really our voice
[1:30:07] because whose thoughts are driving our
[1:30:09] voice
[1:30:10] how how how is our voice actually
[1:30:12] functioning
[1:30:13] what are we giving voice to
[1:30:15] are we speaking the word
[1:30:18] or are we potentially giving the serpent
[1:30:21] some voice time are we giving them some
[1:30:23] air time in our life
[1:30:25] we're not even doing that
[1:30:27] airtime is expensive
[1:30:29] in general how much is their time in the
[1:30:31] life of a Believer there's no room for
[1:30:34] Satan to have a voice in our lives
[1:30:35] brothers and sisters
[1:30:37] Lord help us
[1:30:39] she has the mind of Christ
[1:30:41] to know what to do with the word I
[1:30:43] believe there's all kinds of scarecrows
[1:30:45] around that whole entire discussion
[1:30:48] because there has been charlatans there
[1:30:50] has been people that will raise up and
[1:30:52] and pretend and and and live like we
[1:30:55] talked about the very beginning people
[1:30:56] who will say that I'm a good Christian
[1:30:58] person but then I'll have a double
[1:31:00] standard I'll do a dirty business deal
[1:31:02] or or I'll talk bad about someone I'll
[1:31:05] gossip I'll I'll do this I'll do that
[1:31:07] and there's a double standard there
[1:31:10] and you know that stops the power of God
[1:31:14] in our lives
[1:31:16] but there is truly an elected bride of
[1:31:19] Jesus Christ and I believe Satan just
[1:31:21] hates hearing these words because when
[1:31:23] she gets the Revelation about who she is
[1:31:25] the prophet for our day it's prophecy
[1:31:27] and prophecy has to come to pass it's
[1:31:30] the word of God it's thus saith the Lord
[1:31:32] when she gets that Revelation about what
[1:31:35] she is then the Rapture will go she goes
[1:31:38] up and he's cast down and his time is
[1:31:41] over
[1:31:42] she has the mind of Christ to know what
[1:31:45] to do with it she has thus saith the
[1:31:47] Lord
[1:31:48] we don't have to keep still brothers and
[1:31:50] sisters if we have the mind of Christ
[1:31:52] we don't have to
[1:31:55] not that we have to say I've got
[1:31:57] Authority so I can I can just get upset
[1:31:59] and say whatever I want because I've got
[1:32:01] the mind of Christ and I've got
[1:32:02] Authority no way no that's where we'll
[1:32:05] keep still
[1:32:06] when a devil comes and tries to step on
[1:32:08] our toes
[1:32:10] as a father in our home we identify a
[1:32:12] devil coming into our house
[1:32:15] we have the responsibility like Adam to
[1:32:18] redeem our family to kick that devil out
[1:32:21] to stomp on it to identify it in front
[1:32:23] of our family to show our children
[1:32:24] that's a devil and it's not tolerated
[1:32:27] it's not acceptable in our home we have
[1:32:29] that responsibility as Believers to
[1:32:32] understand to discern the spirits is
[1:32:34] what the word said
[1:32:38] don't let a scarecrow hold you back
[1:32:41] from realizing the power of the word in
[1:32:43] your voice
[1:32:45] in our voice we don't want the devil to
[1:32:47] have any room there's there's no
[1:32:50] there's no room for the serpent not in
[1:32:52] this Garden
[1:32:53] there's no room for the serpent we're
[1:32:55] coming into Springtime and we're going
[1:32:57] to get into gardening and and seeing all
[1:32:59] the all the life happen how it just
[1:33:03] comes naturally we don't need to give
[1:33:05] Satan any room in our lives brothers and
[1:33:08] sisters stand stand to your feet with me
[1:33:10] this morning
[1:33:13] I just
[1:33:15] really felt impressed to talk about how
[1:33:17] the the voice of God how it changed how
[1:33:21] it went from being a spirit voice
[1:33:24] to being a natural voice
[1:33:27] Adam forfeiting his rights to it going
[1:33:30] back to being a spiritual voice
[1:33:33] and the prophet for our day coming down
[1:33:36] from Glory
[1:33:38] just like we were pulled from him before
[1:33:40] the foundation of the world that light
[1:33:42] unto the world and given that voice
[1:33:45] again
[1:33:46] and handing it back that Prophet said
[1:33:49] that all that Adam lost has been
[1:33:51] restored
[1:33:52] and what greater
[1:33:55] what greater responsibility is there to
[1:33:57] than to have that voice his voice
[1:34:00] in our in our lives in our minds in our
[1:34:04] hearts
[1:34:05] if we could just remember
[1:34:08] his voice
[1:34:11] let's just bow
[1:34:13] gracious Heavenly Father
[1:34:15] Lord Jesus I I many times don't
[1:34:18] understand why things go the way they go
[1:34:20] when we come to preach and I just trust
[1:34:24] father that if I obey you that you will
[1:34:26] bless the word and father I pray that
[1:34:29] the words that were spoken today Broken
[1:34:31] as they were that you would just take
[1:34:32] them and and and make them right in the
[1:34:34] hearts of your children today Father
[1:34:36] Lord I pray that you would just be
[1:34:38] glorified in all that was said and done
[1:34:40] I pray father that we could Lord begin
[1:34:43] to recognize that voice and and in our
[1:34:46] own lives begin to give that voice the
[1:34:50] preeminence that it desires that voice
[1:34:53] Lord Jesus that's you
[1:34:56] forgive me for making it an inanimate
[1:34:58] object Lord we want to make sure that
[1:35:01] you speak through us
[1:35:04] father that we don't give the serpent
[1:35:06] any time in our lives that we do not
[1:35:09] allow ourselves to just wander out from
[1:35:13] behind the blood and wander back in
[1:35:15] again transgressing you because it's
[1:35:18] just what we do and we know that you'll
[1:35:19] bless us you will bless us for a Time
[1:35:23] but father it's
[1:35:25] it's just a real Revelation to know that
[1:35:28] we don't want to just do it because we
[1:35:31] don't want to be blessed we want to do
[1:35:33] it because you love us so greatly so
[1:35:36] much we want to reverence you with our
[1:35:39] entire lives
[1:35:41] as your bride because of what you've
[1:35:43] done for us Lord
[1:35:45] we came into this world without one hope
[1:35:48] without one possibility of a chance to
[1:35:52] ever be redeemed if you did not choose
[1:35:55] to redeem us Lord
[1:35:57] so father we just thank you for
[1:35:59] redeeming us we thank you for giving us
[1:36:01] your word thank you for sending us a
[1:36:03] prophet to expound upon that word Lord
[1:36:05] so that people like me could understand
[1:36:07] it in in in a way that would just
[1:36:09] encourage me I pray that the word would
[1:36:12] just encourage your people today as well
[1:36:14] father and Lord Jesus most of all that
[1:36:17] you would be glorified in our lives that
[1:36:19] we would just give voice to you in such
[1:36:21] a way that you would just bless us
[1:36:24] abundantly above all that we could ask
[1:36:26] or think and we're not talking about
[1:36:27] money we want to see spiritual
[1:36:29] Revelation in our lives Lord that's the
[1:36:31] blessing that I'm asking for that we
[1:36:34] could stand in the face of the enemy and
[1:36:36] say no way
[1:36:38] you can't touch me
[1:36:40] because I'm God's
[1:36:43] we pray Lord Jesus that you would just
