[55:23] the spirit of the Lord and just allow
[55:25] the Lord to move through him and see
[55:27] what the Lord once said to us and as we
[55:30] prayed earlier we just want to make sure
[55:32] that we have hearts to receive that word
[55:34] when it comes forward it's one thing to
[55:36] say that we want a fresh anointing for
[55:39] the ministry but we want a fresh heart
[55:41] to receive that word when it comes so we
[55:44] just like to maybe sing that song again

[1:02:10] and I just want to say thank you very
[1:02:12] much for coming out
[1:02:14] on a Saturday evening knowing that there
[1:02:16] is services on Sunday
[1:02:18] and after three continuous services
[1:02:21] I believe you're already blessed by
[1:02:23] being here amen uh
[1:02:27] I want us to turn to mark 16.
[1:02:33] we believe it is inspired right because
[1:02:36] all scripture is inspired
[1:02:40] the School of Theology cannot tell us
[1:02:42] anything
[1:02:45] so the Lord has spoken in this end time
[1:02:51] so I'm reading Mark 16 and I'm reading
[1:02:54] from verse 9.
[1:02:58] um
[1:02:59] I'll go from 9 to 15.
[1:03:07] Mark 16 verse 9.
[1:03:11] now when Jesus was risen early the first
[1:03:14] day of the week he appeared first to
[1:03:16] Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast
[1:03:18] Seven Devils
[1:03:20] and she went and told them that had been
[1:03:23] with him
[1:03:24] as demand and went
[1:03:27] and they when they had heard that he was
[1:03:30] alive and had been seen Affair believed
[1:03:33] not
[1:03:34] after that he appeared in another form
[1:03:39] that's a lot right there
[1:03:42] he appeared in another form
[1:03:44] onto two of them as they walked and went
[1:03:48] into the country
[1:03:49] and they went and told it onto the
[1:03:52] residue neither believed the them
[1:03:56] afterward he appeared onto the 11 as
[1:03:58] they started meet and I braided them
[1:04:01] with their unbelief and Hardness of
[1:04:03] Heart because they believed not them
[1:04:06] which had seen him appear
[1:04:09] which has seen him after he was risen
[1:04:12] and he said unto them go into all the
[1:04:16] world and pray the gospel to every
[1:04:18] creature
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:21] so
[1:04:23] he's holding them for their own belief
[1:04:25] and right away he's sending them
[1:04:27] that is scolding in family
[1:04:31] praise the name of the Lord and so let's
[1:04:34] read first Thessalonians 4.
[1:04:38] just one verse 16.
[1:04:41] very familiar verse
[1:05:06] first Thessalonians 4 16.
[1:05:11] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:05:13] heaven with a shout
[1:05:15] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[1:05:18] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:05:20] shall rise first
[1:05:23] may the Lord had his blessings to the
[1:05:25] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:05:30] praise the name of the Lord
[1:05:33] Hallelujah
[1:05:36] so this is the fourth day of feasting in
[1:05:39] family
[1:05:41] feasting together
[1:05:44] as a family
[1:05:46] and I think a lot has been brought in
[1:05:50] very simple yet profound ways about the
[1:05:53] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:55] and this day
[1:05:57] and
[1:06:00] I for one I want to say like John of old
[1:06:03] you know on on Peter on Mount
[1:06:06] Transfiguration it is good to be here
[1:06:10] praise the name of the Lord
[1:06:12] it has been really really good I fed and
[1:06:15] I'm glad that I just took the time to to
[1:06:18] be a part of this and
[1:06:21] I say this if you missed what has gone
[1:06:25] on so far and
[1:06:26] even if you've been here but you've been
[1:06:28] distracted maybe you've been here but
[1:06:32] something just find time and listen to
[1:06:35] these things again
[1:06:37] because I believe they are spiritual
[1:06:39] food in due season is the Lord himself
[1:06:42] descended to commune with his children
[1:06:44] amen and I I see this
[1:06:48] that is what happens when leadership
[1:06:51] submits to headship praise the name of
[1:06:54] the Lord
[1:06:55] now the theme of these meetings was is
[1:07:00] he is risen
[1:07:03] he is risen and the hope is that
[1:07:06] something will be said something will be
[1:07:10] will be done here that'll point or at
[1:07:14] least remind us
[1:07:16] of the Risen Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:20] Hallelujah
[1:07:21] because
[1:07:23] there is no way for us to achieve that
[1:07:25] aim that purpose okay to get to that
[1:07:27] position that the Lord wants us
[1:07:31] if we don't meet the Risen Lord Jesus
[1:07:34] Christ
[1:07:35] Hallelujah
[1:07:37] and so yes um it started on Wednesday
[1:07:41] I think brother
[1:07:43] Gilbert brought the question and I
[1:07:45] believe everybody who was here
[1:07:48] at least since then has
[1:07:51] asked himself that question or attempted
[1:07:53] to answer
[1:07:54] what does the resurrection mean
[1:07:57] praise the name of the Lord
[1:07:59] now we know that we can never answer
[1:08:02] that question if we don't know where the
[1:08:05] victory was won
[1:08:06] Hallelujah and so then for the
[1:08:10] Toby brought it very beautifully
[1:08:13] the victory is not a Calvary but didn't
[1:08:16] get so many praise the name of the Lord
[1:08:18] now the thoughts of Gethsemane always
[1:08:21] brings something to to heart and it
[1:08:24] brings something to bite and that is the
[1:08:25] fact that
[1:08:27] Jesus prayed
[1:08:29] and he had a preference
[1:08:32] ultimately he surrendered his will to
[1:08:34] the father
[1:08:35] but he had a preference
[1:08:37] that preference was not answered or
[1:08:41] rather the answer was not what he
[1:08:42] preferred
[1:08:44] and I think that it puts our Christian
[1:08:47] Life in in such perspective
[1:08:50] that we don't get it because we want it
[1:08:53] we get it because it's his will
[1:08:56] and it's part of his plan and purpose
[1:08:58] for us
[1:09:00] Hallelujah
[1:09:01] and so I I really enjoyed that coming
[1:09:04] from Gethsemane and then brother Murphy
[1:09:08] came to tell Lucius
[1:09:10] all of that has been done
[1:09:13] but the resurrection was actually a
[1:09:15] victory it was a declaration of victory
[1:09:17] the Bible had already been fought
[1:09:20] but that picture was you and I
[1:09:22] praise the name of the Lord the
[1:09:24] motivation that led the Lord
[1:09:27] to the Cross was you and I
[1:09:30] I hope we don't take these things for
[1:09:32] granted
[1:09:33] and this evening what I'm trying to do
[1:09:36] right now is
[1:09:38] for the first time I'm trying to use the
[1:09:40] slides
[1:09:41] and so please bear with me
[1:09:44] Hallelujah
[1:09:46] and my topic as you can see there is
[1:09:49] identified by his deeds
[1:09:52] amen identified by his deeds now um
[1:09:58] I think Thursday
[1:10:00] started hitting some things
[1:10:03] and and and I loved it
[1:10:06] but you know I'm always mindful of the
[1:10:08] the young guys who spend time with me
[1:10:10] downstairs and I was thinking
[1:10:13] if only they catch it
[1:10:15] because it was a Thursday evening and he
[1:10:18] was saying it was a Night Like This when
[1:10:21] the crucifixion happened
[1:10:23] Hallelujah and and you know there is a
[1:10:26] question that I
[1:10:28] I didn't have it growing up
[1:10:31] but it has come up
[1:10:33] and for most people I would say it's
[1:10:37] difficult to answer and that is how to
[1:10:40] fit three days
[1:10:41] into Friday night to Sunday morning
[1:10:45] 15 three full days into sun Friday
[1:10:48] evening to Sunday morning and actually
[1:10:52] the the the the doors I'll see the
[1:10:55] critics actually quote the statement of
[1:10:57] Jesus when he said as the son of man was
[1:11:00] in the belly of the will for three days
[1:11:03] and three nights
[1:11:05] so shall
[1:11:06] as Jonah was in the belly of the wheel
[1:11:09] for three days and three nights so shall
[1:11:11] the son of man be
[1:11:12] and so the question has a reason and
[1:11:15] I've looked at it and there's no way I
[1:11:17] can fit three days and three nights into
[1:11:20] Friday evening
[1:11:21] to Sunday morning
[1:11:24] unless
[1:11:26] we go by the scriptural way Hallelujah
[1:11:29] because you see if and please all those
[1:11:33] people come along with me let me just
[1:11:37] talk to my young people for a little bit
[1:11:39] Hallelujah
[1:11:42] because you see when you
[1:11:44] take the scriptural way when you take
[1:11:47] God's definition
[1:11:48] then everything rounds perfect that's
[1:11:51] why I always say if there's a Bible
[1:11:52] question there has to be a Bible outside
[1:11:55] praise the name of the Lord
[1:11:57] but when you use this Roman Calendar
[1:11:59] that we have
[1:12:00] in which the day starts at
[1:12:03] 12 midnight
[1:12:05] so all the darkness into six o'clock all
[1:12:09] of that is still morning
[1:12:10] and then it goes on it doesn't fit
[1:12:14] but you see God defined a day
[1:12:17] and since the time God defined it there
[1:12:19] has not changed his mind
[1:12:21] we may be civilized and we have a system
[1:12:25] that works for us and there are all the
[1:12:27] good reasons
[1:12:29] and praise God for all of that but God
[1:12:32] has to change his mind
[1:12:34] and that is what we have to understand
[1:12:35] that when you have a Bible question
[1:12:37] there is a Bible answer in Genesis
[1:12:40] chapter one
[1:12:42] without exaggerating I think God defines
[1:12:44] a day at least six times
[1:12:48] when God created heaven and there was
[1:12:50] Darkness
[1:12:51] and then he called light
[1:12:53] and the scripture says he separated the
[1:12:55] darkness from the light
[1:12:57] the darkness he called Knights
[1:13:00] and the light he called day
[1:13:03] and then in verse 5 he says in the
[1:13:05] evening and the morning was the first
[1:13:07] day
[1:13:08] Now that statement what that statement
[1:13:10] carefully because he was going to repeat
[1:13:12] it in Genesis chapter one alone he
[1:13:14] repeats this I've missed six times in
[1:13:16] verse 5 in verse 8 in verse 13 in verse
[1:13:19] 19 and verse 23 in verse 31 he repeats
[1:13:21] the sins in the evening and the morning
[1:13:23] was the day and so in God's definition
[1:13:26] of a day it starts from the evening and
[1:13:30] it ends in the morning so in essence
[1:13:33] from sunset
[1:13:35] to Sunrise is the evening from sunrise
[1:13:38] to sunset is the morning and then the
[1:13:41] day is complete now if you watch
[1:13:43] carefully and if you go to Israel today
[1:13:46] not years ago no today when they
[1:13:49] celebrate their Sabbath it starts from
[1:13:52] the day that we call Friday evening
[1:13:57] and then it ends on the day that we call
[1:14:00] Saturday evening
[1:14:01] now I don't like using these days when
[1:14:03] I'm discussing this the Thursday Friday
[1:14:05] and Monday I don't use it because the
[1:14:07] moment I mention it it brings back the
[1:14:09] the the Roman Calendar that we are using
[1:14:12] and that is not God's calendar
[1:14:15] but you see when you look at the Jews
[1:14:18] you'll find God's calendar but even
[1:14:20] Among Us Gentiles the people who are use
[1:14:26] um the people who
[1:14:28] worship on Saturday not like The
[1:14:30] Seventh-Day Adventists the reforming
[1:14:32] Adventists historic adventures all these
[1:14:34] people their Sabbath begins on a Friday
[1:14:36] evening
[1:14:38] and it ends on a Saturday evening and so
[1:14:41] when you look at it like that you'll
[1:14:43] understand perfectly that it works well
[1:14:46] for the three days under consideration
[1:14:49] now if you permit me I want to say this
[1:14:52] that
[1:14:53] the three days we are dealing with is
[1:14:55] the preparation I'm using Bible language
[1:14:58] their preparation their Sabbath and the
[1:15:01] first day of the week
[1:15:03] three days preparations
[1:15:05] now the preparation was the day before
[1:15:09] the Sabbath
[1:15:10] not half the inoculated the whole day so
[1:15:13] 24 hours before the Sabbath
[1:15:15] and so the preparation became the day of
[1:15:18] the crucifixion
[1:15:19] and then the Sabbath was the day of rest
[1:15:21] and the first of the week
[1:15:24] which I believe has started now was the
[1:15:27] day of the Resurrection praise the name
[1:15:29] of the Lord and so when you look at it
[1:15:31] like that he died on the evening of the
[1:15:34] preparation
[1:15:35] Now understand it carefully the next
[1:15:37] morning was the morning of the
[1:15:40] preparation it was not the next day
[1:15:43] right so it's tasked on the evening of
[1:15:46] the preparation to the morning
[1:15:48] and then the next evening is the evening
[1:15:50] of the Sabbath to the morning and then
[1:15:53] the next evening is the evening of the
[1:15:56] first day of the week
[1:15:57] and then the born in three days three
[1:16:00] nights praise the name of the Lord now
[1:16:03] take your time I don't assume they're
[1:16:05] just talking about this like that night
[1:16:07] clarify it for everybody but take your
[1:16:09] time and considerate that the moment you
[1:16:11] start a day any day
[1:16:13] the Bible has said the evening and the
[1:16:15] morning was the day so if he died in an
[1:16:18] evening they have to come the morning
[1:16:20] before you go to the next day
[1:16:22] if you go into the Sabbath evening it
[1:16:25] starts morning and on and on praise the
[1:16:28] name of the Lord and so anyway I thought
[1:16:30] that I had to just
[1:16:32] clarify this
[1:16:34] especially for the young people that I I
[1:16:37] spend time with
[1:16:39] and so what our focus is to this morning
[1:16:42] or this evening
[1:16:43] is the period from the very first day
[1:16:47] from the first day of the week
[1:16:49] practically up till now Hallelujah
[1:16:52] because once he was risen the grief had
[1:16:55] no use anymore longer praise the name of
[1:16:58] the Lord and more important than that we
[1:17:00] were risen with him
[1:17:02] Hallelujah and so I just want to start
[1:17:05] by pointing out that yes
[1:17:07] um
[1:17:08] the professor fiction must have been
[1:17:10] difficult
[1:17:11] from that time the the
[1:17:14] crucifixion that the yeah the
[1:17:16] crucifixion and the Sabbath whilst they
[1:17:18] were waiting for the first day it has
[1:17:20] probably must have been some of the
[1:17:21] saddest days in the lives of these
[1:17:23] people the apostles the disciples and
[1:17:26] especially think of it the women who
[1:17:28] followed him From Galilee
[1:17:30] the scripture says they they ministered
[1:17:33] unto him
[1:17:34] and now they come here and they
[1:17:36] witnessed their lord their savior Man
[1:17:39] full of so much love and then so much
[1:17:42] hatred directed at him
[1:17:44] now he has spoken to them about it
[1:17:46] but they were overwhelmed by events and
[1:17:49] practically everything that they heard
[1:17:51] from him was sort of not on their mind
[1:17:54] at that point
[1:17:56] and so they witnessed the man that even
[1:17:59] before their eyes
[1:18:01] brought a dead man from Death To Life
[1:18:05] and now he's been crucified he's placed
[1:18:08] in the Tomb
[1:18:10] and a big Stone has been rolled over it
[1:18:13] and the stone is so big that they as the
[1:18:16] women cannot roll it and not just that
[1:18:19] it had been sealed
[1:18:23] so even if men are going to move it it
[1:18:27] will be unlawful
[1:18:29] right and so it sounds like that that
[1:18:31] barrier had been placed between man and
[1:18:34] his Lord
[1:18:36] and
[1:18:38] there was no way that they could get
[1:18:40] into it praise the name of the Lord
[1:18:43] and so as if the barrier is meant to
[1:18:45] keep them there forever
[1:18:48] but what happened was that the
[1:18:49] crucifixion was still forever
[1:18:52] even the weights longer it might it
[1:18:55] might have been was not forever
[1:18:57] the morning came I praise the name of
[1:19:00] the Lord the day of the Resurrection
[1:19:02] came and it was evident that the grave
[1:19:06] cannot no longer hold him
[1:19:08] praise the name of the Lord
[1:19:11] now once he was alive he has spoken
[1:19:14] about
[1:19:15] his crucifixion his burial his
[1:19:18] resurrection
[1:19:19] and now the word that he has spoken to
[1:19:22] them the time had come for it to be made
[1:19:25] manifest
[1:19:26] there was no power in hell to stop it
[1:19:29] because he had spoken already
[1:19:32] and and when I get to Junctions like
[1:19:35] this
[1:19:36] I just want to pause and let you know
[1:19:39] that the Lord has spoken about you
[1:19:41] and that is why you are here and the
[1:19:44] fact that he spoke about you means no
[1:19:46] power can stop it from happening
[1:19:49] praise the name of the Lord
[1:19:50] [Music]
[1:19:52] there are so many scriptures we can
[1:19:54] refer to that tells us that he spoke
[1:19:57] about us he thought about us and he
[1:19:59] spoke about us praise the name of the
[1:20:01] Lord
[1:20:02] and so like I said
[1:20:04] there's no power absolutely
[1:20:07] that can stop it
[1:20:09] and so nothing stopped him
[1:20:12] he had to come out and that was the time
[1:20:15] for him to declare his victory
[1:20:17] specifically to the bride the Bible had
[1:20:20] already been won their Resurrection was
[1:20:23] a declaration of Victory Hallelujah
[1:20:27] now for God to manifest that
[1:20:30] Resurrection not to manifest but to show
[1:20:33] it to us
[1:20:35] the stone had to be moved
[1:20:38] now remember we cannot move the stone
[1:20:41] and so the Lord had to move the stone
[1:20:44] praise the name of the Lord now remember
[1:20:46] who placed the stone there
[1:20:48] man plays the stone man plugged the
[1:20:52] assets of man to the Lord
[1:20:55] praise the name of the Lord but the Lord
[1:20:57] the love he had for us was deep
[1:21:00] it was great
[1:21:02] and so he moved the stone praise the
[1:21:05] name of the Lord now we have to
[1:21:07] understand that in our lives the things
[1:21:10] the impediments the difficulties
[1:21:13] not for us to move it's not for us to do
[1:21:15] it's for us to trust him to do it for us
[1:21:18] Hallelujah and not just that he has
[1:21:20] promised praise the name of the Lord
[1:21:23] now I just want to point out this that
[1:21:26] this tool was not removed
[1:21:28] for him to come out
[1:21:30] it was not for him that the stone was
[1:21:32] removed
[1:21:33] now if you remember correctly in John 20
[1:21:36] I think
[1:21:37] they were guided that the disciples were
[1:21:39] guarded in a room
[1:21:41] and for few of the Jews the doors were
[1:21:43] locked the windows were closed and he
[1:21:46] came there
[1:21:47] and so this was at a point where no
[1:21:50] physical barrier was an impediment
[1:21:52] and that is the law that we served today
[1:21:55] for the Risen Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:58] no stone no wall no but just came can
[1:22:02] stop him praise the name of the Lord all
[1:22:04] he did he needs from us
[1:22:06] is our willingness to welcome him
[1:22:09] praise the name of the Lord
[1:22:15] a lot of times we come here and we
[1:22:16] extend invitations
[1:22:18] but we have to be willing to welcome him
[1:22:21] praise the name of the Lord
[1:22:23] Hallelujah
[1:22:29] now when the stone was removed
[1:22:32] for the first time it gave us access to
[1:22:35] an empty tomb
[1:22:37] it's for us
[1:22:39] it gave us access to an empty tomb now
[1:22:42] you see we were going to deal with the
[1:22:44] situation from that day and that time
[1:22:46] until now there is a situation we don't
[1:22:49] have the physical body of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:52] Christ
[1:22:53] and so we're going to deal with a
[1:22:55] situation where we'll have to look at
[1:22:57] the evidence and belief
[1:22:59] praise the name of the Lord that's why
[1:23:01] it says blessed is he
[1:23:04] that has not seen and yet believed
[1:23:07] and so there's a blessing for people who
[1:23:09] see that evidence and not have the
[1:23:11] physical body
[1:23:13] and yet believe
[1:23:15] Hallelujah
[1:23:18] I will start reading this uh quotes
[1:23:30] in Jesus Christ the same yesterday to
[1:23:32] them forever 58 but Ram says the only
[1:23:36] way he would be any different would be a
[1:23:37] Corporal body talking about the Lord
[1:23:39] Jesus Christ
[1:23:40] and his core probability is at the right
[1:23:43] hand of the father's Throne making
[1:23:45] intercession
[1:23:46] Upon Our confession Hallelujah now that
[1:23:50] was my purpose but I just loved all that
[1:23:52] it says in addition and anything that he
[1:23:55] died for any attribute that his
[1:23:57] atonement called for it's our personal
[1:24:00] property
[1:24:02] Hallelujah of every believer to accept
[1:24:04] it and confess it as a finished work and
[1:24:07] receive it How Great Thou Art Hallelujah
[1:24:13] so the empty tomb was proved that life
[1:24:15] does not end in the Tomb
[1:24:18] the empty tomb was proof that there is a
[1:24:21] resurrection in life Hallelujah and so
[1:24:25] if you have that quickening power that
[1:24:27] was in the Lord Jesus Christ in you then
[1:24:30] it means the tomb cannot hold you
[1:24:32] it means there is not an absolutely that
[1:24:35] can stop you praise the name of the Lord
[1:24:37] so ages when you have that in you that
[1:24:40] is when you can say because he lives I
[1:24:43] live also
[1:24:46] Hallelujah
[1:24:49] now
[1:24:53] what they didn't realize
[1:24:56] was that at this point the ministry of
[1:24:59] the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ was
[1:25:02] turned in a corner
[1:25:04] that the ministry was moving to a new
[1:25:06] phase
[1:25:07] it was moving to a face where we will
[1:25:10] not have the need to go to him
[1:25:13] but he was going to come to us
[1:25:15] Hallelujah and not just that he was
[1:25:17] coming to those that he knew
[1:25:20] before the foundation of the Earth
[1:25:23] praise the name of the Lord and so for
[1:25:25] that no barrier was going to stop him
[1:25:28] praise the Lord
[1:25:31] now remember he told them everything
[1:25:33] before it happened
[1:25:36] but it's just that the people were
[1:25:38] overwhelmed
[1:25:40] right and so let's read something here
[1:25:45] and this is John 16.
[1:25:48] yeah this is John 16 6.
[1:25:52] and this is part of the times and the
[1:25:54] instances when he was telling them about
[1:25:56] what was happening he said
[1:25:58] but because I've said these things unto
[1:26:00] you sorrow has filled your heart
[1:26:02] nevertheless I tell you the truth it is
[1:26:06] expedient for you that I go
[1:26:09] and these are some of the things that uh
[1:26:12] oftentimes I say
[1:26:14] difficult for the natural mind to
[1:26:16] understand or accept
[1:26:18] this is the Lord who has been with them
[1:26:20] the Lord who has healed their diseases
[1:26:22] the Lord who has brought food for them
[1:26:25] the Lord who has encouraged them who has
[1:26:27] strengthened them who has changed their
[1:26:28] life and now he's going to leave them
[1:26:30] and he says it is expedient means it's
[1:26:33] beneficial it is to your advantage that
[1:26:36] I live
[1:26:37] what was he talking about
[1:26:39] well he tries to explain this for if I
[1:26:42] go not away
[1:26:45] the comforter will not come unto you
[1:26:49] but if
[1:26:53] but if I depart I'll send him unto you
[1:26:55] and when he is come he will reprove the
[1:26:58] word of sin
[1:27:00] and of righteousness
[1:27:02] and of judgment
[1:27:04] Hallelujah so the Lord began to sort of
[1:27:08] signal the change in the ministry it was
[1:27:11] going from a Ministry of him being with
[1:27:13] them to a minister where he'll be in
[1:27:15] them
[1:27:16] praise the name of the Lord
[1:27:18] and so he was going to be with them in
[1:27:21] them so when he talks about reprove the
[1:27:24] world of sin
[1:27:25] how is it going to do if he's done with
[1:27:27] them
[1:27:28] through his Believers Hallelujah of and
[1:27:32] of righteousness how through his
[1:27:34] Believers of judgment how through his
[1:27:37] Believers and so the simplest thing is
[1:27:39] this if you have received the Holy Ghost
[1:27:41] there's an assignment for you
[1:27:44] if you have received the Holy Ghost
[1:27:46] there is a work for you to do Hallelujah
[1:27:48] if you received the resurrected the Lord
[1:27:51] Jesus Christ then you are to represent
[1:27:54] and present the Lord Jesus Christ unto
[1:27:56] everybody you come in touch with
[1:27:58] praise the name of the Lord I'm not
[1:28:01] saying everybody is a preacher or
[1:28:02] everybody is a man but by your speech
[1:28:07] by addressing
[1:28:08] by your behavior by your actions by all
[1:28:12] of your life listen this is a Saturday
[1:28:14] evening
[1:28:18] of a holiday weekend
[1:28:21] there are so many things you could be
[1:28:22] doing now if you choose to be here by
[1:28:26] your priorities alone you are declaring
[1:28:28] a Risen Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:29] [Applause]
[1:28:31] Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[1:28:34] so it's by the things we do consciously
[1:28:37] unconsciously our prioritize our
[1:28:39] priorities are made known
[1:28:41] Hallelujah
[1:28:46] and so like everything else he told them
[1:28:48] many many things
[1:28:50] about himself and he explained it to
[1:28:53] them
[1:28:54] but it's that they did not
[1:28:57] really get it or if they believe it it
[1:29:00] just escaped them by events that was
[1:29:03] happening
[1:29:04] now John 12 24
[1:29:07] this is Jesus speaking he says very
[1:29:09] rarely I say unto you except of corn a
[1:29:12] corn of wheat fall into the ground now I
[1:29:15] saw this scripture yesterday
[1:29:17] except a crown of which fall into the
[1:29:20] ground and die either by death alone
[1:29:24] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[1:29:28] fruit Alleluia and so God was signaling
[1:29:32] how things were going to happen that the
[1:29:34] fullness of the godhead
[1:29:36] which was dwelled in one entity one body
[1:29:39] called the Lord Jesus Christ that is
[1:29:41] Paul that's not me dwelling in one body
[1:29:44] now was going to fall it was going to
[1:29:47] die but it was going to come up in as
[1:29:51] many people as can receive it
[1:29:54] praise the name of the Lord you see how
[1:29:56] expedient it was that he had to die
[1:29:58] Hallelujah so with that in mind he went
[1:30:03] to the cross
[1:30:04] yes brother sister he was thinking about
[1:30:06] us
[1:30:07] praise the name of the Lord
[1:30:14] and so what I see now is that
[1:30:17] the pain
[1:30:19] their sorrow the disappointment the
[1:30:21] cross
[1:30:22] Calvary all of that was just
[1:30:27] on the way from his glory to your hearts
[1:30:31] Hallelujah
[1:30:33] and so this is what it was now we could
[1:30:35] not pass through that
[1:30:37] there's a show of sort of there's a
[1:30:39] share of pain for us there's a sort of
[1:30:41] Heartache for us but we could not pass
[1:30:44] through what he passed through
[1:30:45] and so because we couldn't go to him he
[1:30:48] came to us
[1:30:49] that's the love
[1:30:51] you remember the barrier the stone the
[1:30:53] seal we couldn't move it Hallelujah and
[1:30:57] so he came to us praise the name of the
[1:31:00] Lord
[1:31:01] now in the spoken word is the
[1:31:04] Original Seed
[1:31:07] program says Christ was manifested to
[1:31:10] destroy the works of the devil is that
[1:31:12] right
[1:31:17] now we all believed the Bajaj key and
[1:31:19] does not limit his power right
[1:31:21] Hallelujah
[1:31:23] is that right congregation says amen
[1:31:26] so you all believe that that is why he
[1:31:29] was
[1:31:30] God's word that's why he was God's word
[1:31:33] we destroys the works of the hybrid the
[1:31:36] devil is that right
[1:31:38] he was done to do that he was born to be
[1:31:41] that to destroy the works of the devil
[1:31:44] now his body is to do the same
[1:31:48] amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:31:54] his body is to do the same because their
[1:31:56] body is head
[1:31:58] and body is together that's right if
[1:32:02] Christ is the head was the word his body
[1:32:04] has to be the same then as his head was
[1:32:11] so in essence
[1:32:14] when you witness the resurrected Lord
[1:32:16] Jesus Christ
[1:32:18] what you are doing
[1:32:20] is that you'll become a means of like a
[1:32:23] witness
[1:32:25] and I'll go a little further
[1:32:27] that their body that Witnesses the
[1:32:30] resurrection
[1:32:32] pacifies of the Resurrection
[1:32:34] through all their life they testify of
[1:32:37] their Resurrection but you see the best
[1:32:39] testimony
[1:32:41] is when you are manifesting the Living
[1:32:43] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:45] Hallelujah
[1:32:47] now you see if if if I don't know if you
[1:32:51] get some of them
[1:32:52] the the door-to-door salesman come to
[1:32:55] you
[1:32:56] but whatever products that you have
[1:32:59] you could see the ad on the internet you
[1:33:03] can see it on the billboard they could
[1:33:05] talk about it on radio and you could see
[1:33:08] it in a brochure it could be on the
[1:33:10] television
[1:33:11] you know multimedia whatever means
[1:33:15] but when the people come to you to you a
[1:33:19] very efficient salesman why they do they
[1:33:22] bring their product itself to you
[1:33:24] they don't come and tell you about the
[1:33:26] product they give you the products so
[1:33:29] regardless of all that you've seen now
[1:33:31] here is the product you can look at it
[1:33:33] you can try it like the car dealerships
[1:33:36] when they know you're serious they give
[1:33:37] you the key go and try it
[1:33:39] praise the name of the Lord and this is
[1:33:42] what is happening that the people who
[1:33:44] saw him resurrecting they testified of
[1:33:46] it now it doesn't matter that people
[1:33:48] didn't believe they testified all the
[1:33:50] same but you see that was a Prelude to
[1:33:53] something else that was going to happen
[1:33:55] Hallelujah and so when you look for the
[1:33:58] Risen Lord Jesus Christ today there are
[1:34:01] two things you have to do first look to
[1:34:03] your life
[1:34:04] to see if you find him
[1:34:06] praise the name of the Lord and if you
[1:34:09] don't find him look for him in your life
[1:34:12] find him in your life praise the name
[1:34:14] and once you have him you can share
[1:34:18] because this is what the Lord Jesus
[1:34:20] Christ requires
[1:34:22] that he desires to live in US remember
[1:34:25] that was God's purpose all the way from
[1:34:27] the Garden of Eden
[1:34:30] praise the name of the Lord to the
[1:34:32] extent that he be created
[1:34:36] now he's not abandoned his purpose
[1:34:38] no I weakness does not stop him
[1:34:41] and that purpose will be fulfilled and
[1:34:43] it's in fulfillment right now
[1:34:48] so in that sense when you accept the
[1:34:52] revelation of his appearing
[1:34:54] you are accepting a battle
[1:34:57] because you are accepting a vessel
[1:34:59] through which the Lord resurrected Lord
[1:35:02] Jesus Christ will manifest himself to
[1:35:04] destroy the works of the devil
[1:35:07] now that sounds like a big thing are we
[1:35:09] going to battle no
[1:35:11] but you see
[1:35:13] every time
[1:35:15] that you live right everything that you
[1:35:18] do that is scriptural is a condemnation
[1:35:21] to deviance
[1:35:23] simple
[1:35:24] live your life the way you want to live
[1:35:26] it
[1:35:27] be who you want to be according to
[1:35:30] scripture and already you are destroying
[1:35:32] the works of the devil
[1:35:35] sister look at how you are dressed when
[1:35:37] you are coming here
[1:35:38] couldn't you find a nice tight pants
[1:35:40] that will show all your shape and
[1:35:42] leave nothing to imagination
[1:35:45] no you don't want it why
[1:35:49] if that is all that we have around us
[1:35:52] why would you do that
[1:35:55] this is the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:35:56] Christ already manifesting himself
[1:35:59] praise the name of the Lord
[1:36:10] I have to say this all the same it
[1:36:12] doesn't matter it's not it's not it's
[1:36:13] not part of the I don't have it on my
[1:36:15] nose but listen brother sisters
[1:36:21] people
[1:36:22] in marriage
[1:36:25] have accepted
[1:36:27] that divorce is an option
[1:36:30] that is the LIE of the devil
[1:36:34] and I am saying this
[1:36:37] without sincerity in my heart it hurts
[1:36:40] what I'm saying is this when if somebody
[1:36:43] comes here and they have a testimony
[1:36:45] doesn't it energize you
[1:36:48] and when you sit here with somebody and
[1:36:49] they step out there
[1:36:51] and they start thinking that they can do
[1:36:53] whatever oh I have a coach
[1:36:57] that's a court nullify the vowel
[1:37:01] you went before the Lord and you spoke
[1:37:05] and you said I love you
[1:37:08] I'll
[1:37:09] protect you and on and on for better for
[1:37:13] word for good and bad until death the
[1:37:16] worst part whose file was that
[1:37:20] you gave that vow
[1:37:22] and suddenly I have a quote that
[1:37:24] nullifies all the vow
[1:37:32] I didn't plan it but it hurts me
[1:37:37] and I feel that if I talk about it
[1:37:39] maybe I'll be able to go on
[1:37:42] all right this is not right
[1:37:45] and and
[1:37:47] okay there's a part where the brown
[1:37:49] blames the ministers and I want to tell
[1:37:51] you this
[1:37:53] at least I've said it today
[1:37:56] and so have it regardless of who lives
[1:38:00] what and what happens the word of God is
[1:38:01] the same
[1:38:03] and in Ecclesiastes
[1:38:07] he actually says that he's not
[1:38:10] interested in the vows of fools
[1:38:13] that you are good if you don't vow
[1:38:16] you are free if you don't commit
[1:38:18] yourself
[1:38:20] forgive me for talking about extremes
[1:38:23] she has a gun pointing to my heart it's
[1:38:25] my head it's no reason for divorce
[1:38:28] he's going to punch me and beat me it's
[1:38:31] no reason for divorce
[1:38:35] it's absolute
[1:38:37] is the word of God
[1:38:38] and in Malacca he says he hates divorce
[1:38:42] that is the Lord we serve
[1:38:46] please understand this
[1:38:49] it's wrong
[1:38:51] don't
[1:38:54] I will be abusive and rude if I use the
[1:38:57] words that I really want to use I don't
[1:38:59] believe any preacher
[1:39:01] who tells you that Lord revealed to me
[1:39:07] this is one statement that I'm saying
[1:39:10] that I'm not ashamed and I'll be able
[1:39:12] and willing to repeat it for the rest of
[1:39:14] my life don't believe any preacher who
[1:39:17] tells you that
[1:39:18] it's not in this Bible from Genesis to
[1:39:21] revelation God never ever permitted one
[1:39:23] person to divorce oh Muslims permitted
[1:39:26] well one Moses permitted the Lord will
[1:39:29] not even hear their prayers read in
[1:39:31] Malachi is that because of that I will
[1:39:34] not hear the prayers you will bring all
[1:39:36] your everything I want to hear it and in
[1:39:38] the New Testament he says the same thing
[1:39:40] even that he says brother treat her well
[1:39:43] so that your prayers are not hindered
[1:39:46] and by the way the vow that we say
[1:39:50] this this is taking me time more than I
[1:39:52] thought The Vow that we say is not just
[1:39:55] to stay married
[1:39:57] it's deeper than that you actually
[1:39:58] commit yourself to a lot
[1:40:00] that's why I want Jesus prayed marriage
[1:40:02] and divorce I think in Matthew 19
[1:40:03] ultimately when he preached married and
[1:40:05] divorced
[1:40:07] even the disciples had done it's not
[1:40:10] good to marry
[1:40:11] think of it yeah
[1:40:14] yeah think of it please
[1:40:17] we can stand here and talk about all the
[1:40:19] deepness and everything I also love them
[1:40:22] but let's do the simple things
[1:40:26] look not one not two people here that we
[1:40:30] know that I've sat here and then they
[1:40:31] get out there and and that's it it's as
[1:40:34] if nothing happened here
[1:40:38] forgive me I'll just keep going but
[1:40:42] this this thing really came came to me I
[1:40:45] I didn't know what to do
[1:40:47] Hallelujah
[1:40:50] so like I think a battle with the devil
[1:40:52] sounds serious
[1:40:53] but actually what is happening is that
[1:40:55] we are called to be there to commit to
[1:40:59] the devil and let the Lord fight the
[1:41:01] battle
[1:41:02] Hallelujah
[1:41:04] it does not depend on us
[1:41:06] and that is for us as long as we can
[1:41:08] accept what he does for us praise the
[1:41:12] name of the Lord
[1:41:15] a little bit because yesterday I saw
[1:41:18] that scripture and when I saw it right
[1:41:21] there I was sitting there it spoke to me
[1:41:23] and so I just want to uh look at it for
[1:41:27] now yes
[1:41:29] it says because you see Peter had a lot
[1:41:33] of zeal
[1:41:34] Peter had a lot that he was very
[1:41:36] determined and he had Zeal and he was
[1:41:39] committed to do it but Jesus also knew
[1:41:42] that all our Zeal doesn't do much if the
[1:41:45] spirit of the Lord is not in US
[1:41:48] and so brother sister when you meet a
[1:41:50] Ministry that is telling you get the
[1:41:52] Holy Ghost just listen and and it's not
[1:41:55] like you can do a great way to get the
[1:41:57] Holy Ghost no ask the Lord
[1:41:59] believe and the most important and let
[1:42:02] him feel welcomed
[1:42:05] Hallelujah because we pray and we invite
[1:42:08] him over and over and over again but
[1:42:11] will he be pleased with the life I live
[1:42:15] will he be pleased with all these
[1:42:18] naked women pictures on my wall
[1:42:20] will he be pleased with all the lies
[1:42:23] that I am I'm telling and I'm living
[1:42:25] will he be pleased when I'm deceiving
[1:42:27] somebody so over and over check your
[1:42:30] life and let him feel welcomed that is
[1:42:33] all it takes
[1:42:34] praise the name of the Lord
[1:42:41] now um
[1:42:43] and so watch this and I'm reading a
[1:42:47] Matthew 26 14. and he comes on to his
[1:42:51] disciples and finded them asleep and
[1:42:53] save unto Peter now watch this
[1:42:56] he came unto his disciples plural
[1:42:59] he found them Ashley plural and then he
[1:43:03] spoke to Peter
[1:43:04] Hallelujah because he knew the man he
[1:43:07] knew his Zeal and he knew what was going
[1:43:10] to happen very soon
[1:43:12] but he wanted to encourage him he wanted
[1:43:15] to strengthen him he wanted to keep him
[1:43:17] in the fault
[1:43:18] and so he said unto me that what Colina
[1:43:20] watch with me one hour
[1:43:23] watch and pray that ye enter not into
[1:43:25] that so he's beginning to give him tips
[1:43:28] for the life's journey right
[1:43:30] and so he speaks to them he speaks to
[1:43:32] him now elsewhere if you remember he
[1:43:34] speaks specifically to Peter and he says
[1:43:37] the devil has sought to have you
[1:43:40] and to sift you like weights Hallelujah
[1:43:44] and he says I have prayed for you praise
[1:43:47] the Lord as I'm thinking of it I'm
[1:43:49] thinking of the two programs right the
[1:43:52] devil has a program Jesus has a program
[1:43:54] and when I'm thinking that you are here
[1:43:56] right now because he has prayed for you
[1:43:59] Hallelujah now if you doubt it go back
[1:44:03] into the Old Testament
[1:44:05] the son of David Solomon when he
[1:44:08] dedicated the temple he prays for Israel
[1:44:11] and prays for this he gets to a point
[1:44:13] where he prays for us but that was only
[1:44:16] a Prelude to what Jesus was coming to do
[1:44:18] in John 17. he prayed for us
[1:44:21] and that is why we are here so
[1:44:23] regardless of what happens be conscious
[1:44:25] not because of your feeble effort but
[1:44:27] because of what he has done for us and
[1:44:30] take courage let's be confident praise
[1:44:33] the name of the Lord
[1:44:37] Hallelujah
[1:44:41] and so
[1:44:43] the Lord knew that what was ahead
[1:44:47] requires more than zeal
[1:44:50] praise the name of the Lord
[1:44:52] and so as time comes
[1:44:54] one is difficult
[1:44:56] the time for the crucifixion is closed
[1:44:59] and the Lord is speaking to them he says
[1:45:01] oh all of you shall be offended in me
[1:45:04] today
[1:45:05] and Peter says no way not be
[1:45:08] Lord I'll be with even my life
[1:45:11] I'll give it for you and Jesus says the
[1:45:14] cork will not Crow twice you'll deny me
[1:45:18] Thrice
[1:45:20] and it happened exactly
[1:45:23] as Jesus said
[1:45:26] and so what I'm saying is this that
[1:45:29] when he did that
[1:45:31] he lied his way out of being a disciple
[1:45:34] of Jesus Christ
[1:45:36] now they were all offended
[1:45:38] but he specifically denied three times
[1:45:42] in front of witnesses
[1:45:44] no I don't even know the man
[1:45:46] and so it wasn't that the Lord has
[1:45:49] pushed him out but he had lied his way
[1:45:52] out and the devil was right there to
[1:45:54] tell him no you're no more worthy you
[1:45:57] don't deserve anything look at what
[1:45:59] you've done The Man Who Loved You look
[1:46:01] at what you've done to him and on and on
[1:46:03] and on but you see when Jesus rose up
[1:46:05] Hallelujah he said go and tell my
[1:46:08] disciples and Peter
[1:46:10] [Applause]
[1:46:12] Drawing the Line bigger
[1:46:16] bringing Peter back into the phone
[1:46:19] Hallelujah
[1:46:21] that is the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:46:23] Christ praise the name of the Lord
[1:46:27] now one of the differences
[1:46:30] in the change of ministry
[1:46:32] was that at this point it was moving
[1:46:35] from a very public Ministry
[1:46:38] to a very personal Ministry
[1:46:41] it was moving from a point of big
[1:46:46] uh meetings and great healing campaigns
[1:46:51] and now it was coming to
[1:46:53] one or none individualized
[1:46:56] Hallelujah now the aspect of this
[1:47:00] individualized uh relationship also to
[1:47:03] speak a personalized Ministry was that
[1:47:06] you only recognizing
[1:47:08] fresh when it appears to you but more
[1:47:11] than that he has to reveal himself to
[1:47:13] you
[1:47:14] so he appears and he reveals himself to
[1:47:18] you Hallelujah
[1:47:20] and how does he do it he reveals by a
[1:47:23] sign he reveals by something that you
[1:47:25] know about him something that is very
[1:47:27] unique something that will make you
[1:47:29] recognize that is him and he does that
[1:47:32] to only the people of his own Chosen and
[1:47:34] I believe this is what brought us today
[1:47:36] you're here today because that is what
[1:47:38] we do here hallelujah now let's read
[1:47:42] this uh let's look at this uh
[1:47:45] quotes here when their eyes were opened
[1:47:48] they knew him that's 1964.
[1:47:53] now here is truth
[1:47:55] if he has risen from the dead then he
[1:47:58] promised that God will be made known in
[1:48:01] human flesh
[1:48:03] now think of it that is one thing that
[1:48:05] we have always rejected
[1:48:08] this is this one thing that Humanity has
[1:48:11] always rejected we are okay with a God
[1:48:13] who is spiritual we are okay with a God
[1:48:15] who is some but that human standing by
[1:48:18] me whose trust like the way I sweat
[1:48:22] who maybe as Jesus was working some of
[1:48:24] them could even run better than Jesus or
[1:48:27] do some heavier work than him and then
[1:48:29] to accept that that man is Jesus Christ
[1:48:32] it becomes difficult and so throughout
[1:48:34] history when God manifests in flesh only
[1:48:37] those who are ordained see it
[1:48:40] Hallelujah
[1:48:42] he said but watch brother Abraham and
[1:48:45] now I see why I he said now no matter
[1:48:48] how much he anoints me
[1:48:51] watch this now
[1:48:53] the God must investing in flesh is now
[1:48:57] happening he says no matter how much he
[1:49:00] anoints me you've got to be Anointed
[1:49:02] with faith to believe it
[1:49:07] and so this is where the problem comes
[1:49:11] a man with all his weaknesses and
[1:49:13] shortfalls and to say that God is
[1:49:15] manifesting through them then you are
[1:49:17] making the man God
[1:49:20] Hallelujah
[1:49:21] so he said it takes both of us
[1:49:24] the woman that touched His Garment she
[1:49:27] had to believe
[1:49:29] she would have went on by see he would
[1:49:32] have went on on by see she had to
[1:49:35] believe it see it's God
[1:49:39] then he goes into another Direction
[1:49:41] where he says now if somebody thinks a
[1:49:43] gift
[1:49:44] is a great big knife God gives you a
[1:49:46] gift you can take it and slice it and do
[1:49:49] what you've got the wrong conception of
[1:49:51] a gift
[1:49:52] a gift is knowing how to get yourself
[1:49:55] out of the way
[1:49:58] that is how he anoints you right you get
[1:50:01] yourself out of the way and let God do
[1:50:04] what he wants to do see is knowing how
[1:50:07] to relax yourself that God can use you
[1:50:10] in the way that he wants to just get
[1:50:13] yourself out of the way see
[1:50:16] and so what is happening when it comes
[1:50:18] to our Salvation our healing when it
[1:50:20] comes to the Lord's dealing with his
[1:50:22] bride he does not leave it to anybody it
[1:50:24] does not leave it to the great Angel
[1:50:26] whoever he does not give in to the
[1:50:28] Archangel and the terrorists know he
[1:50:30] does it himself
[1:50:31] praise the name of the Lord but then he
[1:50:34] uses humans for that purpose Hallelujah
[1:50:39] and so in that sense Jesus like the
[1:50:41] scripture we read he appeared to Mary
[1:50:43] first after the resurrection
[1:50:45] and he spoke to her
[1:50:48] but she didn't recognize him
[1:50:50] until
[1:50:51] he called her by name
[1:50:54] and once he called her by his name that
[1:50:56] opened her eyes praise the name of the
[1:50:58] Lord
[1:51:00] then he appeared to the two
[1:51:02] their way to uh emails
[1:51:05] and they did not recognize him
[1:51:08] until he broke the bread
[1:51:09] now what a man has been with you brother
[1:51:12] Brahms is for six hours he preached them
[1:51:15] and what I love about that story is that
[1:51:18] it says
[1:51:19] that beginning from Moses and the
[1:51:22] prophets
[1:51:23] Hallelujah now
[1:51:25] for the young people you know
[1:51:28] there is the law that is Moses and
[1:51:32] there's a Prophets
[1:51:33] now uh the Poetry or wisdom was not part
[1:51:38] of scripture
[1:51:41] and the history was also not part of so
[1:51:44] Kings and all those was not part of it
[1:51:46] so in essence he took the entire
[1:51:48] scripture because Old Testament is about
[1:51:51] to is not yet written and so scripture
[1:51:54] was the law and the prophets
[1:51:56] and so he took all of it and for six
[1:51:59] hours he tied all the Loose Ends
[1:52:01] Hallelujah he said oh the Loose Ends and
[1:52:05] he was talking to them about himself
[1:52:07] praise the name of the Lord now we say
[1:52:10] this so that when it happens again we
[1:52:12] know that is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:52:14] praise the name of the Lord
[1:52:18] now in Mark 16
[1:52:22] he appeared onto the 11 apostles
[1:52:26] and most of whom had had the
[1:52:28] resurrection
[1:52:29] but they had not believed yet
[1:52:33] and that is key for us to know that just
[1:52:35] the fact that you testified somebody did
[1:52:37] not accept it does not mean they cannot
[1:52:40] accept it later
[1:52:41] just pray for them
[1:52:43] don't just throw them over their own
[1:52:46] Believers that they pray for them
[1:52:48] and believe
[1:52:50] Hallelujah but you see
[1:52:53] when they have received the testimony
[1:52:56] and they had not believed it what has
[1:52:58] happened is that they had missed that
[1:53:00] blessing
[1:53:01] because blessed is he
[1:53:03] who else believes who has and yet not
[1:53:06] seen Hallelujah
[1:53:08] praise the name of the Lord
[1:53:10] and so I would say this that that
[1:53:12] blessing is still wait was still waiting
[1:53:15] right it was still waiting for a people
[1:53:18] who will believe even when they had not
[1:53:21] seen
[1:53:22] and if you if you're a Bible student you
[1:53:24] understand that I'm talking about
[1:53:25] Gentile Faith right now
[1:53:28] that is not for the Jews
[1:53:30] that is Gentile faith now I'm not going
[1:53:33] to go in today but we know
[1:53:35] that the ones that don't need the law to
[1:53:38] come to them the one that don't need
[1:53:40] hands laid on those are the Gentiles and
[1:53:43] that is the people that we are
[1:53:45] Hallelujah and so these things are in
[1:53:47] scripture for us to know and understand
[1:53:49] our call praise the name of the Lord
[1:53:53] man
[1:53:56] now when you see
[1:53:59] or when you believe
[1:54:02] even when you've not seen
[1:54:04] what you are saying is God is faithful
[1:54:07] because what you are holding on is this
[1:54:09] word that he has told you and the Lord
[1:54:12] laughs
[1:54:14] to be seen as faithful
[1:54:17] now go over all the messages anytime
[1:54:20] Abraham will discern and say this is it
[1:54:22] was that the truth
[1:54:24] you have to confirm and say that God is
[1:54:27] faithful and then you receive
[1:54:29] praise the name of the Lord
[1:54:32] now Mary became a witness
[1:54:34] now it's not as if she had not seen that
[1:54:37] they had brought back to life before
[1:54:40] Lazarus was her brother
[1:54:42] and so she has seen it before but when
[1:54:44] she experienced this Resurrection
[1:54:48] she became a witness
[1:54:50] but the people did not believe
[1:54:52] now why am I saying this I'm saying that
[1:54:55] sister you also have a role to play
[1:54:57] oh it's true and I believe with all my
[1:55:00] heart uh you you shouldn't be a preacher
[1:55:03] and all that but this message calls you
[1:55:06] the pastor of the house
[1:55:08] Hallelujah
[1:55:10] and there is nothing stopping you from
[1:55:12] sharing your testimony
[1:55:14] and sometimes some of these Testaments
[1:55:16] are more powerful than all the
[1:55:17] scriptures that we can read
[1:55:20] Hallelujah
[1:55:21] and so you also have a role to play
[1:55:24] now according to the story of the two
[1:55:26] people who were going to immerse is the
[1:55:28] same thing that Mary had witnessed to
[1:55:31] them and they had not believed yet
[1:55:33] And yet when their eyes was opened
[1:55:36] nobody could stop them from testifying
[1:55:39] Hallelujah
[1:55:41] and so this is what I'm saying that
[1:55:46] his works
[1:55:48] identify him
[1:55:50] because the people that he appeared to
[1:55:52] were people who had had an encounter
[1:55:55] with him there were people who had met
[1:55:58] him before and so they couldn't identify
[1:56:01] him by the way that he did by the
[1:56:04] distance I'm not talking about miracles
[1:56:06] here calling Mary by name is not a
[1:56:08] miracle
[1:56:09] or breaking bread is not a miracle but
[1:56:12] that experience with them that encounter
[1:56:14] with them is what brought these people
[1:56:16] to the recognition that here it is that
[1:56:20] is him Hallelujah so he identified
[1:56:23] himself by his worst Hallelujah and so
[1:56:27] his ethnic Ministry had become a
[1:56:30] testament of his presence Hallelujah and
[1:56:33] this is what I'm saying that when you
[1:56:34] witness it again
[1:56:36] you know and understand that he is here
[1:56:39] praise the name of the Lord
[1:56:42] so in Matthew 26 about sorry Matthew 11
[1:56:45] 2
[1:56:47] and
[1:56:50] yes
[1:56:52] it talks about Elijah well John
[1:56:56] and this John is John the Baptist
[1:57:00] he says now when John had heard in
[1:57:02] prison the works of Christ he sent two
[1:57:06] of his disciples understand it what
[1:57:09] brought this encounter he sent two
[1:57:11] offices at he head of his works
[1:57:14] and so the works identify him and like I
[1:57:17] said The Works doesn't mean Miracles at
[1:57:19] least the ones we've seen so far of his
[1:57:21] appearing before people were not
[1:57:24] Miracles by the way unique they were
[1:57:26] distinctive it spoke about him
[1:57:28] Hallelujah and so John had heard in
[1:57:33] prison the works of Christ he sent two
[1:57:35] of his disciples and said unto them how
[1:57:37] thou he who should come or do we look
[1:57:40] for another
[1:57:45] Jesus answered and said unto them go and
[1:57:47] show John again those things which he do
[1:57:50] hear and see
[1:57:53] now watch this carefully Hallelujah
[1:57:56] because he was going to even to the
[1:57:58] prophet he was going to identify himself
[1:58:00] by his deeds he says the blind Sea and
[1:58:04] the lame walk and the lepers are
[1:58:07] cleansed and the death here and the dead
[1:58:10] are raised up and the poor have the
[1:58:12] gospel pray to them and blessed is he
[1:58:15] who is not offended because of me
[1:58:21] Hallelujah
[1:58:24] in our generation
[1:58:26] have we witnessed a similar Ministry
[1:58:30] praise the name of the Lord remember the
[1:58:32] works identify him
[1:58:35] have we witnessed a ministering with
[1:58:36] their blind sea
[1:58:38] have we went with us a worldwide
[1:58:40] Ministry that you cannot fault and with
[1:58:43] the lame walk in with the death here in
[1:58:47] which the dead is raised back to life in
[1:58:50] this congregation in which the cancer is
[1:58:52] healed
[1:58:55] can we identify the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:57] now
[1:58:58] praise the name of the Lord
[1:59:01] because there has been a Ministry that
[1:59:03] is unparalleled in Christian history
[1:59:06] and we hear the stories and and a lot of
[1:59:09] times we hear from childhood and we get
[1:59:10] used to it we get almost desensitized
[1:59:15] praise the name of the Lord
[1:59:17] so can you identify him by his works
[1:59:22] praise the name of the Lord and that is
[1:59:24] what we are called to do
[1:59:33] we will see Jesus 1962.
[1:59:37] it says God and that is Barbara I'm
[1:59:40] praying God will you do it tonight again
[1:59:42] do something among us tonight Lord just
[1:59:45] like you did it before your crucifixion
[1:59:47] then we will have confidence and know
[1:59:49] that our Christ is not dead
[1:59:52] by his risen from the dead and it's
[1:59:54] alive here Among Us forevermore
[1:59:58] Hallelujah and so even brother Abraham
[2:00:00] was looking for that deed the Deeds that
[2:00:03] identify him praise the name of the Lord
[2:00:06] so those are things that you don't take
[2:00:08] for granted now as I'm saying this I'm
[2:00:11] sort of limiting myself because all of
[2:00:14] this
[2:00:15] were done
[2:00:17] before he came to live in them
[2:00:20] all the things that we are talking about
[2:00:22] where he's appearing it was not his
[2:00:25] coming yet
[2:00:26] his coming was when he came to live in
[2:00:29] them
[2:00:30] Hallelujah but why my question is has he
[2:00:33] appeared in this generation
[2:00:37] and that's what I want us to recognize
[2:00:39] praise the name of the Lord
[2:00:41] now Abraham comments on Luke 17 30.
[2:00:46] he comments on Luke 17 30 he says that
[2:00:49] is inconvinced and then consent
[2:00:54] he says I believe the Church of Jesus
[2:00:57] Christ is a called out group that's been
[2:00:59] Sanctified by the blood of Jesus and set
[2:01:01] aside for service I believe this thing
[2:01:04] that we as we see doing is the appearing
[2:01:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ in our midst
[2:01:11] now take note is 1962 right
[2:01:14] and he said remember in the days of
[2:01:16] Sodom
[2:01:17] that was a man standing there that could
[2:01:20] eat and drink
[2:01:23] but it was God in the man
[2:01:26] showing that God would appear in the
[2:01:28] last days in the form of human flesh in
[2:01:31] his church
[2:01:33] which is his bride
[2:01:37] Madame this church has a capital letter
[2:01:40] all right
[2:01:44] praise the name of the Lord and they
[2:01:47] will do the same thing he did amen
[2:01:51] and so this is what has happened that
[2:01:54] when he comes
[2:01:56] he does the same thing
[2:01:58] my prayer is Lord let it be in me
[2:02:01] praise the name of the Lord let it be in
[2:02:03] my life
[2:02:05] Hallelujah
[2:02:10] now let's read this the end time
[2:02:12] evangelism 62. it says same thing today
[2:02:15] when you see his work now we've already
[2:02:18] seen and are witnessing the appearing of
[2:02:21] the Lord
[2:02:22] now remember appearing and coming is two
[2:02:24] different words
[2:02:26] to appear and then to come
[2:02:28] now is the appearance he's already
[2:02:31] appeared in these last days right here
[2:02:34] with us in the last few years now it's a
[2:02:37] sign of his coming
[2:02:40] right when you see the appearance is a
[2:02:43] sign of his coming now all the things
[2:02:45] that we've spoken of so far about his
[2:02:47] appearance it didn't take too much like
[2:02:49] within like at Pentecost he came
[2:02:52] and so the appearance is a sign of his
[2:02:55] coming
[2:02:56] his appearance in his church in the form
[2:02:59] of the Holy Spirit showing that it's him
[2:03:04] praise the name of the Living God when
[2:03:07] you say in the form of the Holy Spirit
[2:03:08] showing that it's him it could mean
[2:03:10] anything but he continues because people
[2:03:12] cannot do these things that you see the
[2:03:14] Holy Spirit doing so that's the
[2:03:17] appearing of the Lord
[2:03:19] so if you're somebody who follows this
[2:03:21] message you know exactly what he's
[2:03:23] talking about
[2:03:24] so now remember he spoke both places
[2:03:27] apparent and coming now he upgraded them
[2:03:30] because of their their Hardness of Heart
[2:03:33] because they didn't believe those who
[2:03:35] had seen it I believe he'll do the same
[2:03:38] today
[2:03:40] so yeah I just want to pause and say
[2:03:42] this there are two people there are
[2:03:45] those who witness the resurrection and
[2:03:47] there were those who were told but they
[2:03:49] were both supposed to believe and those
[2:03:52] who did not believe even though they
[2:03:55] were told they were upgraded which means
[2:03:57] they were scolded for it
[2:03:59] it doesn't mean that they were rejected
[2:04:01] no
[2:04:03] it's just a family thing right
[2:04:05] praise the name of the Lord
[2:04:08] and I said
[2:04:10] after they have they didn't believe the
[2:04:11] testimony of those people and he
[2:04:13] upgraded them for it and then he
[2:04:14] commissioned them to go
[2:04:18] into all the world preach the gospel to
[2:04:21] every creature and he would be with them
[2:04:25] to the consummation to the consummation
[2:04:28] the end of the world these signs shall
[2:04:31] followed them that believed
[2:04:34] Hallelujah and so what was happening is
[2:04:37] that he was going to come in them as
[2:04:40] they go
[2:04:41] and so the appearing in itself was not
[2:04:44] enough he had to come before they could
[2:04:46] do it now if you follow scripture
[2:04:48] correctly yes all this appearance
[2:04:50] happened but they both just to testify
[2:04:52] came after the day of Pentecost
[2:04:54] Hallelujah
[2:05:02] now um
[2:05:04] with some of the people that we spend I
[2:05:07] spent time with downstairs we've
[2:05:08] discussed the Messianic sign
[2:05:11] and we've discussed how
[2:05:14] it happens to the Jews well the Jews got
[2:05:17] their sign
[2:05:18] and the Samaritans got the assigned
[2:05:21] and the Gentiles did not get a sign
[2:05:23] until now
[2:05:25] and and it wasn't really a topic that I
[2:05:28] wanted to discuss but we We Came Upon it
[2:05:32] because we're just discussing the
[2:05:34] ministry of Elisha
[2:05:35] and in the ministry of Elijah there was
[2:05:38] such a manifestation
[2:05:40] that at some point the king of Syria had
[2:05:43] to pause
[2:05:44] his
[2:05:46] top brass military people and say enough
[2:05:49] no more military plans no more battle
[2:05:51] plants
[2:05:52] until I know who is leaking our
[2:05:54] information to the king of Israel
[2:05:57] because if there's no use planning when
[2:05:59] as soon as we are done you are going to
[2:06:00] go and tell that so who is in charge but
[2:06:03] you see there was a man there
[2:06:05] who knew a little more about life than
[2:06:08] Syria
[2:06:10] and so the man said oh relaxing
[2:06:13] there is no snitch Among Us
[2:06:16] that's the language of my boys
[2:06:22] and so I said oh there's no spy Among Us
[2:06:27] it's Elisha in Dothan who is telling you
[2:06:30] the things you are saying in your in
[2:06:32] your bed chamber Hallelujah in Damascus
[2:06:38] Hallelujah and so and and this I I just
[2:06:42] mentioned this for us to understand that
[2:06:45] that's
[2:06:46] Messianic sign has been associated with
[2:06:49] the ministry of the Elijah spirit
[2:06:53] now what happened is that all the
[2:06:55] previous comments had to do with Jews
[2:06:58] and so with Jews God is dealing with
[2:07:01] them as a nation and so maybe it
[2:07:04] happened once maybe it happened twice
[2:07:06] but with us Gentiles he's dealing with
[2:07:09] us as individuals and so over and over
[2:07:11] again it happened night after night
[2:07:13] place after place all around the world
[2:07:16] this mechanic sign was displayed
[2:07:18] everywhere
[2:07:20] and and I I I can spend the whole night
[2:07:23] talking about that but I just want us to
[2:07:26] read just one quote here now remember
[2:07:31] I have to turn it down I always forget
[2:07:37] now just let's consider this coach and
[2:07:40] see how it ends and that is what matters
[2:07:42] to me most and and will be closing very
[2:07:44] soon
[2:07:45] brother says he assists a man sitting
[2:07:47] here his head down crying praying for
[2:07:49] himself and also for his wife she isn't
[2:07:52] here hallelujah
[2:07:54] now you're talking to a man there first
[2:07:57] of all you know what the man is praying
[2:07:58] about and then you know where what is
[2:08:02] happening what I said she's not with you
[2:08:05] this afternoon
[2:08:07] She's suffering you think God could tell
[2:08:10] me what her trouble is
[2:08:12] and hair not here
[2:08:15] so it is diagnosing from far
[2:08:18] he said you believe it you do I'm a
[2:08:21] stranger to you is that right your wife
[2:08:23] has a female trouble
[2:08:25] if that's right raise up your hand
[2:08:27] say
[2:08:29] hi so they will see it and your name is
[2:08:33] Mr Smith so diagnose the wife and now
[2:08:36] come to talk to the man do you believe
[2:08:38] that God will make her well and if
[2:08:40] that's right wave your hand up and down
[2:08:43] like this
[2:08:44] and then look at Batman says I challenge
[2:08:46] you to believe that Jesus Christ is
[2:08:48] revealed in the form of son of man in
[2:08:52] human flesh through the bride's body
[2:08:57] Hallelujah and says accept his call
[2:09:05] praise the name of the Lord now I accept
[2:09:08] that a lot of the course has to do with
[2:09:11] the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:09:13] that revelation of his appearance and
[2:09:15] that actually was my topic until the
[2:09:18] meeting started and that's that went on
[2:09:20] it changed and he changed until now we
[2:09:24] have identified by his deeds
[2:09:27] now I want us to read this because I
[2:09:30] once made a preacher and and and this
[2:09:33] was a Street Preacher
[2:09:35] and I met him I was I just believed the
[2:09:38] message
[2:09:39] and I met when this Street Preacher was
[2:09:41] saying that
[2:09:42] Jesus was God
[2:09:45] and for me who has who had just believed
[2:09:48] the message it was amazing this this was
[2:09:50] back in in Ghana it was amazing to hear
[2:09:52] that so I went to sit down and this is
[2:09:54] the scripture that he was using and so
[2:09:57] I'll just just go through quickly he
[2:10:00] says for he commanded this is Psalm 107
[2:10:03] verse 25 to 29 and his emphasis was on
[2:10:05] 29 say for he come he commanded the he
[2:10:09] commanded and raises the storm the
[2:10:11] stormy wind which lifted up the waves
[2:10:14] thereof they mount up to the heaven they
[2:10:17] go down again to the deaths their soul
[2:10:19] is melted because of trouble they are
[2:10:22] real to and fro and started like a
[2:10:24] drunken man and uh at the end of their
[2:10:26] way so this is a desperate situation
[2:10:28] when Sublime they don't know what to do
[2:10:31] and he says then they cry unto the Lord
[2:10:33] in their trouble and he bringeth them
[2:10:35] out of their distress he make the storm
[2:10:39] a calm so
[2:10:41] that the waves thereof are still
[2:10:45] and so this preacher mentions this and
[2:10:49] then he goes back to the story of the
[2:10:50] Lord Jesus Christ in the New Testament
[2:10:52] and then he he preaches about the the
[2:10:55] disciples with the Lord in the boat and
[2:10:57] how the wind come and the Storm come and
[2:11:00] the waves and is and and they are
[2:11:01] desperate they don't know what to do and
[2:11:03] then they go and wake the Lord Jesus
[2:11:05] Christ and then he stands up and Rebrand
[2:11:08] says he pulls himself together and he
[2:11:11] speaks softly and say please be still
[2:11:14] and so he reads all this story and then
[2:11:16] he says you see that's the only one who
[2:11:20] can calm the storm
[2:11:23] and so I was so I was fascinated by just
[2:11:27] this man and what he was doing and I was
[2:11:29] really excited now that was then
[2:11:32] I didn't know that the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:11:34] identified himself like that again today
[2:11:37] and so when we talk of the Risen Lord
[2:11:40] Jesus Christ this is good to know what
[2:11:41] he did in history
[2:11:43] but what he has done today matters to us
[2:11:46] Hallelujah
[2:11:48] now in in testimony verbraham speaks of
[2:11:51] a situation I think he had been to
[2:11:53] Canada he had been to Canada he went
[2:11:56] hunting and then he's going back and he
[2:11:58] goes to Colorado and he takes some
[2:12:00] ministers and they go hunting and so
[2:12:04] uh it was announced that there was going
[2:12:07] to be a blizzard and Brown says this
[2:12:09] blizzard is it's powerful if if you are
[2:12:12] caught in it says in a matter of hours
[2:12:13] you could get up to 30 feet of snow and
[2:12:16] you perish in there he uses that word
[2:12:19] and so he see he they mentioned it and
[2:12:23] then all the people say we are not
[2:12:26] living so everybody is leaving but the
[2:12:28] people brother Abraham is working with
[2:12:30] Anna living and so he said okay then you
[2:12:33] can go out you are doing your hunting
[2:12:34] and everything he says this first sign
[2:12:37] of rain rushed back to the camp he said
[2:12:40] the first sign because in 15 minutes you
[2:12:43] won't know your way back to the camp and
[2:12:44] you'll perish and so he speaks he tells
[2:12:48] them this and he himself goes out but at
[2:12:51] some point he shoots a buck
[2:12:53] and it drops somewhere and by then it
[2:12:57] looks like the blizzard was starting
[2:12:59] so he goes in further to the top of the
[2:13:02] mountain he looks for the back he
[2:13:04] doesn't find the back and then he's
[2:13:05] leaving like all normal human beings do
[2:13:09] there's a blizzard coming it's going to
[2:13:11] kill you so you run away
[2:13:13] and so he's going he's going and and I'm
[2:13:17] trying to cut this shot so we'll finish
[2:13:18] very soon and then he hears a voice that
[2:13:21] says go back where you come from
[2:13:26] Hallelujah now what about Abraham says I
[2:13:28] says sometimes God makes us do things
[2:13:31] that seem very dangerous and out of line
[2:13:34] Hallelujah
[2:13:36] and so
[2:13:38] he trains he looks at the blizzard and
[2:13:40] everything and there is noise and
[2:13:42] everything maybe I just heard it he
[2:13:44] turns to go and then he cannot go and
[2:13:47] then he hears the voice again go back
[2:13:50] and so then he turns
[2:13:52] and he walks into the blizzard
[2:13:55] and so he goes into the blizzard
[2:13:57] and he goes right to where he was and
[2:14:01] then he fits down
[2:14:02] his drenching there is wind that it's
[2:14:06] cloudy it's gloomy there is sleet there
[2:14:09] is hail
[2:14:10] and he sits down he's thinking what am I
[2:14:13] doing here
[2:14:14] and as he thinks that the voice comes
[2:14:17] against I am the Lord God I've created
[2:14:21] the heavens and earth nature obeys me
[2:14:24] Hallelujah
[2:14:29] and so when he hears that
[2:14:32] he says he tries to find the pillar of
[2:14:34] Fire
[2:14:35] because
[2:14:37] every time that he's Heard a Voice like
[2:14:39] that Airness of the Lord he sees the
[2:14:41] pillow of fire with it
[2:14:43] and this is very notable that I found in
[2:14:45] that story so he looked for the
[2:14:48] for the
[2:14:49] pillar fire
[2:14:51] and he does not find it and he says Lord
[2:14:54] where are you
[2:14:56] and he gets no answer
[2:14:58] and then it says again
[2:15:01] I am the Lord God that had you speak to
[2:15:04] those squirrels into existence
[2:15:07] Hallelujah
[2:15:10] and so that is the part
[2:15:12] that when it says that it's gone from
[2:15:15] the the Lord who created heaven and
[2:15:17] earth to the Lord
[2:15:19] who made you speak those questions now
[2:15:22] I'm sure you all know the story of this
[2:15:23] squirrels hunting and wanting squirrels
[2:15:27] and it's it's not squirrel season and uh
[2:15:31] thinking about the scripture if you say
[2:15:33] to this mountain let it move and you
[2:15:35] don't doubt and then the angel coming to
[2:15:37] teach him the angel coming to tell him
[2:15:39] yeah it's part of the atonement
[2:15:42] that a man could be so surrendered that
[2:15:45] the Lord will use his lips to speak
[2:15:48] Hallelujah that the Lord will use his
[2:15:50] lips to speak and so the god that the
[2:15:53] angel teaches him a little bit of these
[2:15:55] things and then after a while he says
[2:15:57] speak
[2:15:59] whatever you want
[2:16:01] and Brian says
[2:16:04] he says there are no specific people
[2:16:06] here hallelujah sorry
[2:16:09] so there are no sick people here and
[2:16:12] doesn't know what and then the The Voice
[2:16:14] actually tells him you are hunting you
[2:16:17] want squirrels
[2:16:19] and so then he speaks
[2:16:21] and the way he said the spirit shall
[2:16:23] come and where they should go Weddle and
[2:16:25] he'll shoot them it happened exactly but
[2:16:27] the part that interests me is that in
[2:16:29] that at that time and this is what
[2:16:32] happens he looked for the pillar fire
[2:16:34] and he did not find it
[2:16:36] I'm I'm I'm just I'll just leave you to
[2:16:39] make your conclusions here I I won't
[2:16:41] speculate when I'm talking about these
[2:16:42] things but when on on on on in the storm
[2:16:47] he looked for the pillar of fire the
[2:16:48] Lord was speaking to him he looked for
[2:16:50] the pillow fight he did not find it now
[2:16:52] when he says I am the Lord that uh made
[2:16:55] you speak the screw us into existence
[2:16:58] that time acts well he looked for the
[2:17:01] pillar of fire he did not find it
[2:17:03] and then he spoke
[2:17:05] not the only other thing about it is
[2:17:07] this
[2:17:08] that when he spoke he did not say that
[2:17:11] says the Lord
[2:17:13] I'll just leave that to you
[2:17:14] when he spoke he did not say that says
[2:17:17] the Lord
[2:17:18] Hallelujah
[2:17:20] and so then and we're going on with with
[2:17:22] this story about the the other one
[2:17:27] is then on that very hour
[2:17:32] okay
[2:17:36] now
[2:17:38] okay then on that very hour it spoke
[2:17:42] again
[2:17:43] to that very same time sitting up there
[2:17:46] and he said I am the one that stood on
[2:17:48] the ship that night and made the winds
[2:17:51] and the waves to seize
[2:17:53] and said rise up on your feet and rebuke
[2:17:56] the storm and it will obey exactly what
[2:17:58] you say
[2:18:00] what am I saying is
[2:18:03] songs
[2:18:04] and then
[2:18:05] just has come to bring it to
[2:18:07] manifestation but all of that were to
[2:18:10] Jews and Samaritans and now there's a
[2:18:14] Ministry manifesting that same thing
[2:18:16] again
[2:18:17] [Music]
[2:18:17] [Applause]
[2:18:18] and it says it won't be revealed to
[2:18:21] everybody
[2:18:22] but it's people of his own chosen
[2:18:25] and this is why we are talking about the
[2:18:27] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ at this
[2:18:28] point Hallelujah
[2:18:31] and so I'll just let Abraham continues
[2:18:33] and standing there at that time I raised
[2:18:36] up and I and I said Lord God great
[2:18:39] creator of nature I believe that that's
[2:18:41] you speaking not one time have you ever
[2:18:44] showed me anything that was wrong and
[2:18:47] one not one time have you
[2:18:49] let me say anything but what's come to
[2:18:53] pass
[2:18:54] I said therefore I say to this storm
[2:18:57] that's a region go to your places go
[2:19:00] back leave this alone and I command that
[2:19:03] the sun will shine for the next four
[2:19:06] days so these men can dedicate their
[2:19:08] trophies and I can help them get them
[2:19:11] and get out of these mountains and the
[2:19:14] Lord God who is my Southern judge this
[2:19:15] morning that rain and things twisting
[2:19:18] within a moment time there wasn't a bit
[2:19:20] of it
[2:19:22] I looked and there was a wind come from
[2:19:24] the other way across the top of the
[2:19:26] mountain and lifted up those clouds like
[2:19:28] that within just a matter of a few
[2:19:30] minutes the sun was broke up right
[2:19:33] through the top shining right down just
[2:19:36] as pretty as it could be
[2:19:39] Hallelujah
[2:19:41] the hill stopped their sleeves their
[2:19:43] sleet stopped
[2:19:46] and so what I'm saying is that in this
[2:19:47] end time
[2:19:49] the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ has
[2:19:52] appeared in this ministry of Malachi 4.
[2:19:55] and not just appearing but he has
[2:19:57] revealed himself to his Gentile bride
[2:20:00] Hallelujah
[2:20:02] now um
[2:20:04] the unveiling of God
[2:20:07] this is 1964.
[2:20:12] he says and Jesus said to that
[2:20:15] and Jesus said that to weed down the
[2:20:17] crowd yeah
[2:20:18] yes and I and my father and one and that
[2:20:21] things that he says that anoints people
[2:20:23] and they leave him
[2:20:25] he says see
[2:20:29] till he could get their group together
[2:20:31] and out of those people
[2:20:34] they only 11 of them then understood
[2:20:37] actually who he was
[2:20:39] they know that he was God and God Alone
[2:20:42] and then he says now my subject this
[2:20:44] morning is to reveal and unveil that God
[2:20:49] Hallelujah
[2:20:51] so what God was that
[2:20:53] God was manifesting himself through the
[2:20:56] Lord Jesus Christ because that is the
[2:20:58] Lord Jesus Christ they were looking at
[2:21:00] and that's the largest person who
[2:21:02] stumbled many and they left and that's
[2:21:04] the Lord Jesus Christ at the 11 saw and
[2:21:06] recognized that he was God and here is a
[2:21:09] man a Malta man a sinner saved by grace
[2:21:12] standing and saying my Ministry of
[2:21:15] that's a different court it's not here
[2:21:17] since my Ministry is to declare that he
[2:21:19] is here
[2:21:21] praise the name of the Lord
[2:21:24] and so if you believe that you are a
[2:21:26] bread of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:21:28] then I think that you are placing on you
[2:21:31] the duty to believe all of the message
[2:21:36] because
[2:21:37] listen the Bible mentions the bride it
[2:21:40] doesn't say it is you and I
[2:21:42] praise the name of the Lord but the Lord
[2:21:45] himself descends with a message and
[2:21:49] declares that you and I are the bride
[2:21:52] now if we can accept that do we have to
[2:21:55] ignore the other things that message
[2:21:57] says
[2:21:58] praise the name of the Lord because you
[2:22:01] see the moment you accept that you are
[2:22:02] right you are again admitting that God
[2:22:05] is faithful
[2:22:06] and so we all have a duty to believe
[2:22:09] everything he tells you drew through
[2:22:11] those same lips that declared as his
[2:22:14] bride Hallelujah
[2:22:18] I believe we are here because he called
[2:22:19] us
[2:22:21] and I believe that he's more aware of
[2:22:23] our weaknesses and shortfalls than we do
[2:22:27] and so he calls us in spite of our
[2:22:31] weaknesses
[2:22:32] Hallelujah is there anything that is
[2:22:35] going to stop him from fulfilling his
[2:22:38] purpose in our lives
[2:22:40] the stone didn't
[2:22:41] they feel they didn't
[2:22:43] what do you think what can you find that
[2:22:46] was stopping from fulfilling his purpose
[2:22:49] we just have to understand this
[2:22:51] that there are no circumstances in our
[2:22:53] life that he does not know
[2:22:57] things happen in our heart beats and we
[2:22:59] are afraid and we are scared and we
[2:23:01] don't know what to do
[2:23:02] yes those things are meant to have that
[2:23:05] effect on us
[2:23:06] but after all that
[2:23:09] if we look to him we are saying that you
[2:23:12] are greater than these things
[2:23:14] and the Lord laughed knowledge by his
[2:23:17] right
[2:23:19] this is the name of the Lord
[2:23:22] Hallelujah
[2:23:26] I will call the musicians
[2:23:30] now what I want to bring to your
[2:23:32] attention again
[2:23:34] is that these people and we read it
[2:23:39] who heard that he's risen
[2:23:42] and disbelieved
[2:23:45] he still sent them anyway
[2:23:48] but of course they were not going to go
[2:23:50] until he has come in them
[2:23:54] and to understand it that there is
[2:23:56] nothing
[2:23:57] that will stop him if he's revealed
[2:24:00] himself to you today
[2:24:01] if it's confirmed to you that he is the
[2:24:03] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ today yes
[2:24:06] it happened in Bible times we all agree
[2:24:08] but when he calls you and shows himself
[2:24:11] to you I'll tell you this 99 of the
[2:24:14] world don't know that
[2:24:16] so he's done that to a people of his own
[2:24:19] children and that people that great
[2:24:22] people that we are talking is you and I
[2:24:25] it's true we may not see it now
[2:24:27] but that is what is happening and so
[2:24:30] it's for us to embrace our call it's for
[2:24:33] us to accept our call
[2:24:36] because there's a private discussion
[2:24:37] going on between God and his pride
[2:24:40] that's a private interaction people
[2:24:42] don't know that is going on
[2:24:45] these things that I'm saying even talk
[2:24:48] about this like are you making him God I
[2:24:51] believe you understand that I'm talking
[2:24:52] about a sinner saved by grace
[2:24:54] but he was just God's choice to talk to
[2:24:56] me
[2:24:57] in essence he was a servant of my father
[2:25:01] it's not about making somebody or
[2:25:03] raising somebody no no no God decided to
[2:25:06] make a choice
[2:25:08] and all that he's done to us is explain
[2:25:11] the word
[2:25:13] and then reveal it to us hallelujah now
[2:25:18] I just want to talk to you about one
[2:25:21] final instant and I'm surprised I didn't
[2:25:25] mention it but I see it in my nose now
[2:25:26] and so I'll just mention this
[2:25:28] Jesus
[2:25:30] showed himself to his disciples
[2:25:32] in the sea of tiberias
[2:25:34] if if if you remember he went to them
[2:25:38] they are all given up hope they are gone
[2:25:40] fishing
[2:25:41] and Jesus comes and says oh children
[2:25:43] have you found anything and they said no
[2:25:45] he said drop your net on the right side
[2:25:51] now I'm not sure the responsive would
[2:25:53] have received
[2:25:55] today
[2:25:57] they've been prison all night you think
[2:25:59] they didn't drop that no
[2:26:03] and they obey it
[2:26:07] and then when they obeyed they got so
[2:26:10] much fish that they couldn't pull
[2:26:13] why am I saying this because when that
[2:26:15] happened
[2:26:18] among all the disciples there was one of
[2:26:21] them
[2:26:22] that was John
[2:26:24] and Barbara tells us he represents the
[2:26:26] bride correct
[2:26:27] when that happened
[2:26:29] John looked
[2:26:31] they did had happened he looked and he
[2:26:34] told the rest it's the Lord
[2:26:36] Hallelujah
[2:26:38] what I'm saying is we have a call to
[2:26:41] identify the resurrected Lord Jesus
[2:26:43] Christ
[2:26:44] Hallelujah and we are to identify him by
[2:26:47] his teeth
[2:26:49] praise the name of the Lord and then we
[2:26:52] have to let it manifest in our own lives
[2:26:54] because that is what he says to do in US
[2:26:57] he rose to live in US
[2:26:59] he didn't sanctify a place where we can
[2:27:02] go to and find him maybe a Mecca that we
[2:27:04] could go to know
[2:27:06] he didn't get a temple where we could go
[2:27:09] to his desire from the foundation of the
[2:27:12] Earth has been to live in our hearts
[2:27:15] all we need to do is let him feel
[2:27:17] welcomed
[2:27:18] so I will be on our feet
[2:27:22] [Applause]
[2:27:27] he abides
[2:27:33] [Music]
[2:27:48] I'm rejoicing night and day
[2:27:53] [Music]
[2:28:01] and there is

[2:31:16] was not
[2:31:17] brother Emmanuel speaking to us tonight
[2:31:21] and you know many people would say well
[2:31:23] brother Berry how could that be anyone
[2:31:25] else but you know we just believe we
[2:31:28] believe the word of God for our day and
[2:31:30] that's the that's the identification of
[2:31:33] the comforter abiding in US
[2:31:36] many people will say well brother Barry
[2:31:38] hold on a second I've got the Holy Ghost
[2:31:41] but do you believe the entirety of the
[2:31:44] message of the hour
[2:31:45] that is the true identification
[2:31:48] it's not about the first puller the
[2:31:50] second pull it's not about seeing great
[2:31:52] signs and wonders and miracles that's
[2:31:54] not it at all it's all about the word
[2:31:56] the opening of the word my goodness what
[2:31:58] a tremendous what a tremendous lesson
[2:32:02] tonight
[2:32:03] he's identified by his deeds
[2:32:06] and you know brothers and sisters it's
[2:32:08] not about his deeds in church we're all
[2:32:11] perfect Christians right here

[2:32:22] it many times

[2:32:26] do we say the things we shouldn't say my
[2:32:29] goodness
