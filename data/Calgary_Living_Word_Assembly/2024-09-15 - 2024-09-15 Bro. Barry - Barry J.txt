go to him in prayer amen we just have two unspoken requests and uh let's just go to him gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness amen we thank you for your Tender Mercies to each and every one of us Lord Jesus father we know that you know the beginning you know the ending you know every single thing in between and father we know that you know who you yours are amen and father we just pray that this morning one more time that your word would come by our way and wash us father Lord we are so thankful that you have called us unto adoption in this age in which we live in Father

you for it Lord father we pray that you would meet each need sovereignly now father we know the two unspoken requests that we've mentioned father you know them and we thank you Lord that you are more than able to meet those needs we thank you that you are actually meeting them even today father while we speak we love you father we thank you now we just ask that Lord we could push aside our own thinking Lord that we could push aside our own traditions and our own thoughts and ideas and father just give you the full preeminence that you desire today in our service Lord we haven't come to hear from a man and Lord if we have come to hear from a man forgive us Lord because that's not what church is about church is coming to hear from you and father our desire I believe it for every one of us is to truly hear from you Lord that when we leave this building we won't be the same people that came in we won't think the same way we won't have the same thoughts but we'll say maybe there was something to that what we heard today Father we just ask you invite you Lord Jesus to have the preeminence in every aspect of this service now in the words that are spoken in the thoughts that are thought in the hearts Lord Jesus that received this word have your way now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you I uh just want to thank everyone for the specials this morning sister Elizabeth thank you so much for your unwavering specials amen we pray the Lord's richest blessings upon you and traveling mercies as you go back home we pray that you would just take some of the the light the life from Calgary Living Word back to your family there back to the congregation there um I just have one praise report that I want to bring amen before we uh read a scripture here it's from Sister Stella and uh it says Brethren I'm thanking God for successful dedication of my baby Jordan today back home I want to thank the church to remember the mother Joy who is not feeling too well for God's healing and to the entire family God bless you all sister Stella amen we're certainly thankful for the healing touch of Our Lord we know that he is more than able amen if you have your Bibles this morning thank you musicians I'd like to read from Ephesians chapter 5 I'd also like to read from the book of Joshua when we get there um Lord willing Ephesians chapter five very familiar scripture I just uh I felt it impressed to uh maybe stir up our our Pure Minds by way of remembrance this morning and there's nothing better that can do it than the word of God Amen Ephesians chap 5 verse 21 we took this as a tremendous study of uh our position and our roles on Wednesday nights a little while ago verse 21 of Ephesians chapter 5 says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives so subit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every husbands love your wives even as Christ also love the church and gave himself for it remember brothers and sisters he didn't just come to church by giving himself for it he didn't just pay his tithes he didn't just put groceries in the fridge he didn't just pay the mortgage he didn't just teach his children he gave his life for his church and the word says that husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word I just love this next verse that he might present it to who to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish if we try and present ourselves to him it's with blemish and it's not holy it's religious so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh oh my but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is Paul speaking to the Ephesian church here we know that it's God speaking through his age Messenger to the church he says this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church Oh my he said so much about the natural husbands and wives but then he says no this is about a mystery this is something that pertains to more than just husbands and wives but then he says nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband amen let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful for your word Lord and this morning we recognize that Lord you are the husband and Lord the called out church is your wife and if we are your wife Lord as the called out church then help us to reverence you today give us the strength Lord that we need to reverence you in every Lord Jesus we love you and we thank you we just want to commit this service into your hands now for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just a couple of announcements before we get into the word here um we will be commencing with the vote for the church officers it's later than we've done in previous years and I do apologize for that but we will be commencing with that on the 1st of October which is I think a Tuesday this year the voting will commence on the 1st and it will close on the 4th and uh if you just watch for the email it will be just like the last couple that we've had from uh a proxy it will be an online vote so we have uh the church officers that have served in the past they are the same ones that desire to serve in the capacity that they have in the future and uh we're certainly excited to see what the Lord will do are you thankful for the church officers this morning give them a round we know that it takes a desire to serve it it's a it's a desire that not everyone has but the trustees they look after the office of the church the building and keeping everything in check making sure that we are comfortable making sure that everything is functioning and uh it's not an easy job but they do a wonderful job because every single time we get to church it just sort of happens we have it all in order we're certainly thankful for that we're thankful for the office of the deacons the deacons that stand at the door tirelessly that look after things for us that sometimes have to speak out and say you know what if you wouldn't mind please don't do that or you know if you could please move up here because we just need to create a seat at the back for another family that's maybe come a little bit later sometimes we maybe don't like what the deacons have to say but we know the prophet for our day said that the deacons are the policemen for the church and they don't need to they shouldn't wait to talk to the pastor to see if they should do something you know if if you look at the word if you look at the office of a deacon I would say this and perhaps maybe some would argue but we can have a discussion about it if you look at the requirements of the office of a deacon it's even a little bit higher than that of a pastor we know the the pastor oversees it all but the office of a deacon actually does quite a bit of function it is a good thing when we desire the office of a deacon but it is a very very strong scriptural spiritual office it's not something to be taken lightly and for these brothers to be willing to stand up and actually step into that office that shows that they're willing to demonstrate by their lives that they live that they're qualified for that position because we would not want to serve the Lord in any capacity thinking presuming presuming that we're okay in our lives in our walk with the Lord and actually not having that walk that it takes to be in that position so God bless you Brothers for stepping forward to take that position as a deacon and uh I know I did it many years and it's not easy but the Lord gives us strength he's more than faithful are you happy this morning we have a communion service coming up next uh Sunday the 22nd at 5 5:30 p.m. we certainly look forward to seeing each and every one who desires to come and uh submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God because when we come together in a communion service it's not about us it's about coming and recognizing Discerning the Lord's body our brothers and our sisters that who have the Holy Ghost Inside of them we're actually not washing our brother our sister's feet when we come to the communion table we're actually partaking of communion bread and taking a little bit of wine but what we're doing is Discerning the Lord's body the body that was broken for us and the blood that was shed that brought our Redemption that not just brought our Redemption but gives us the ability to understand who we are in the day in which we live the communion service brothers and sisters for those who haven't participated for a long time I've strongly recommend that you examine your life and take a look at it and say is this for me because we know the prophet for our day said the communion service is for every believer it's not something that's just a voluntary thing I'll just take it and leave it if we're Believers then we follow the word of God and that's what the word says so we have a communion service coming up on the 22nd next Sunday at 5:30 p.m. we'll have testimonies we'll have foot washing and we'll have communion service all right let's get into the word today uh talking about our Ephesians chapter 5 going back to this I just felt so led to go here today really enjoyed the service last week with brother toonbo there's so many notes that I got out of it and I trust that everyone else did and I think it's just a beautiful thing when we do have the online services that we can go back and reference to sometimes maybe we don't take notes personally in service I find that I like to I try to but sometimes I get so into the word that's happening it's impossible to actually write notes and you know what H used to happen to me is uh I'll just be completely transparent my pastor used to talk so fast sometimes it would make me frustrated because I couldn't write the notes down but we could always get the recording so we could always go back and reference it and I I began to actually really appreciate that I really enjoyed the fact that I could go back and listen and you know we all have that ability now through YouTube we don't even have to ask for a CD from the brothers for a piece of the service we can just go and look any single time we want to and it's just a wonderful thing when we can look back and and just pick things up but I know that I got uh quite a bit of notes and uh just appreciate brother tonbo and his stand for the word and you know I think one of the things that really indicates his stand for the word is the just the life that he lives serving the lord as long as he has and the capacity that he's at and and I think we all heard the testimony that when he came to Calgary here it was the first time he'd taken a break in in many years even Decades of preaching the gospel and he was able to just have a rest which is certainly a wonderful thing but really enjoyed the service last week and uh today getting into our scripture talking about Ephesians chapter 5 we know that Paul speaking to the Ephesian Church he's talking about the husbands and how they're supposed to conduct themselves according to the word of God and wives how excuse me they're supposed to conduct themselves according to the word of God when we did this study on Wednesday night um probably about a year ago or longer probably two years even um I just pointed out I felt so impressed to point out we we can look at the scripture and say that you know the husband has been taught that the wife is supposed to just submit and it's an unconditional thing just submit and it truly is according to the word of God but a wife that doesn't see a husband living his life according to the word of God is going to have a real hard time being able to submit to that being able to surrender her headship to her headship she's going to have a real hard time with it it doesn't mean that it's not conditional it's not conditional if you want to see the power of God move in your life you got to accept it the way that God's given it and then God will honor his word amen but it starts verse 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God we have to be willing to come together to submit ourselves one to another and you know when we have the Holy Ghost in our lives in our midst it it's really important for us to recognize if we truly do have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when we're submitting ourselves one to another we're submitting ourselves unto God now some might say brother bar you're taking and making a human being god well who are you if you have the Holy Ghost I want to talk about uh a little testimony I've got a I've got a a friend that I knew in the world and years ago I I grew up with and I've told some testimonies about this this gentleman and anyways I uh I drove past his house a little while ago this summer and uh I noticed that this old friend of mine the the house had changed it was the same way for years for decades but when we went past this summer I noticed that it was it was changed and I knew something was different the house sold or something was wrong something had changed and his parents lived in the house and they were old and it turns out that his his dad had passed away and so they had to sell the house his mom could no longer live there and uh so he now lives with his mom and it's kind of a a long story that way but what I'm getting at is seeing the life that was lived when I was in the world and seeing the life that I Live Now is is a dramatic change and even in the midst of that worldly life that I was living there was a time where this friend of mine he was uh connected with this woman that was his girlfriend at the time and he went to a church with her and he went to this church and he said that that for some reason he found himself at the front of the church and I thought he was telling me this story in the world and and I thought wow that's an interesting story he he found himself at the front of the church and he said when they prayed for him he felt something go in the top of his head and out the bottom of his body out out out his foot and I remember in the world having a moment thought a thought where I was like that's interesting you never hear people talk like that in the world what was that in a church it made me think that perhaps there was some kind of power or something that that that could have been there and I asked him you know what about that did you continue going to the church and he said no no no but it really stuck with me it made me think about it and and even in the world I thought man there's something about that and I remember when I first started coming to church here that was kind of my reference point to Modern Christianity it's kind of strange but it's true and I actually asked brother Ken do you have that kind of power in the church here is this the same kind of church and brother Ken said well maybe not exactly like that but what I learned and I'm sure that we all have and this is really kind of where I want to get to today is that that truly we know if you listen to anointed ones at the end time brother radam says that's the real anointing on the false vessel right you can have the real anointing it comes into the church he comes where he's invited now I'm not saying this man that I know is a false vessel I don't know that's up to God to figure out that's not up to me to figure out and it behooves us to make sure that we're not trying to figure it out for other people but what I'm getting at is I wanted to say to him and I plan to in the future is you know what you don't have to have it just come in and then go out and I think many times in Our Lives that's what happens is we experience the anointing of a service and we say wow that's a fantastic service bless God God bless everyone Shake everyone's hand and then we go home and we just live the same life that we've ever lived brothers and sisters it doesn't have to be that way you can take him with you you can take that power of God and and live it amen not us live it but allow him to live it through us and the only way that happens is through surrender amen but that's where I want to get to today you know talking about submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God how do we do that come according to the word amen unless we're willing to come exactly according to the word we're not going to get the right results and I just you know I I was laboring thinking I don't know if I want to go and start talking about this today in service and you hear the songs and you hear the poem You Hear The testimonies and it's God vindicating it saying yes go forwards like Joshua Don't Be Afraid don't don't don't don't worry because I'll be with you so here we are submitting ourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is a head of the church and he is a savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything so what that says to me brothers and sisters and I think the prophet says it I'm not going to bring up too many quotes about it because I want to go further with it but I'm just sort of laying a background setting a foundation here what I want to say is that based on the word of God the wife is completely and totally surrendered unto the husband she is 100% the husband's responsibility for the husband to say the wife is acting out and going crazy she's maybe doing things and maybe things are wild and and we're not sure what's happening the reason for that is there's something wrong with the husband something is wrong something is off something needs to be corrected but it's not something that we need to see correction in terms of a a a an embarrassing situation we just need to get back to the word that's all the husband is head of the wife you know what Christ is the head of the church right and we want him to be our husband and we want him to nourish us and to cherish us and to keep us in every single trial and every tribulation that we go through are we actually ministering the same Grace is that same Grace flowing from Christ through us as husbands to our wives if it's not then we need to just stop and we need to check up with the word of God because there's something wrong if it's not because it doesn't line up with the word 25 says husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it there wasn't one thing that he held back on he gave all of himself for the church remember when he was let's just start with the end shall we maybe how much he gave when he was on the cross how much pride did he have when he was on the cross how much of himself was he covering up there was nothing covering him on the cross was there no he was naked on the cross he was put put to an open shame why was he put to an open shame so that we could see Redemption so that we could be husbands to our wives amen so that we could have overcoming power in our lives amen he wasn't put to an open shame you know how the Catholic Church does it how many people do it they put the loin cloth around them no no not at all and and you know many times I think we can just get into sort of a I don't even know how you would describe it maybe almost like a fairy tale perspective of what happened and maybe an example of that could be like Christmas time how you know Jesus was born in a manger he was in a manger and and the world presented in such a way that it's soft and fluffy and maybe a little bit of straw that's nice and clean you know it wasn't that way he was wrapped in a swaddling cloth which was the filthy stinking rag that was between the the yolk on a ox and he probably had straw in the manger the manger is what they feed the animals out of he probably had straw in there that had manure on it who would take their baby into a position like that who would want to have a baby in that kind of a hospital room my point is sometimes we can paint a picture and have an idea in our head that it's really kind of different than what it was he was put to an open shame there was no pride in Jesus Christ when he was on that cross for us you know in our day God sent us a prophet and we all know the prophet that's why we're here because we believe that God sent a prophet God sent a Vindicated Prophet for this age that's why we're here he was born in the hills of Kentucky 1906 I believe we know this land was a a land of religious freedom we could go into all the history of the US but but I think it's amazing to look at because this land was raised up for one purpose wasn't it brothers and sisters to fulfill Revelations 13 according to the word of this Vindicated Prophet but here we had to have a place for a Vindicated Prophet to rise up do you think God could raise up an entire nation for a Vindicated prophet he did we know this man he had a strange birth he had strange experiences we know that when he was young working for his daddy who was just a normal human being of the day what was he doing living in prohibition I think and what were they doing they were making moonshine his dad was making moonshine and and and and carousing with women after hours and this is what this boy the environment this this Prophet was raised in and we know that he tells the stories where people judged him hard and said you're a brandom they'll cross the street so they don't have to talk to him because they didn't like his daddy we know that he said his people they died with their boots on you know what that means that means there's no peace or rest people die in the street wearing their boots they get killed he said those were the people that he came from but we know in the midst of of all of that there was a time where the voice came and spoke in the tree and we know the story all too well I'm not trying to give a story time here but I'm trying to paint the picture about this Vindicated Prophet there was a time where that angel of the Lord came and spoke to him in a whirlwind in a tree and said to him don't drink don't ever drink or smoke or defile your body in any way because there's a work for you to do later and isn't it wonderful to think that this work that he did later has manifest now in our lives amen that work that he did is manifesting right now we know that he had a call on his life to preach not knowing where it would take him but but this this Angel of the Lord came and met him again and told him you know what your your message the word from you you're going to go and preach all around the world to Kings and potentates and they're going to they're going to hear your word there's going to be kings that are want to be prayed for by you and we know it was it was you can look it up King George I believe was that was that Queen Elizabeth's dad he was prayed for and healed but we know this angel came and told him that and we know that's what he went and did we know that this man the identification of him is actually in the word Revelations 10:7 Malachi 4 5 and 6 I I think it's just so so beautiful we all know this I I know it's exactly what we believe it's it's what we know and the entire message that this man brought point points to the word of God points directly back to the King James version of the word and we know that this God that we're talking about the God that everyone claims but not everyone is willing to actually take his word about this God that we're talking about he sent this Prophet for a purpose it wasn't just to have a Healing Ministry to go around the world it wasn't just to have a a first and second poll it wasn't so that there could be a a voice of God Recordings in a geographical location and people could go and and and partake of some of the things that the prophet liked to do or or have sightseeing tours or all of that that was not the purpose at all of what this Prophet was sent for the purpose this Prophet was sent for was just like elaser was sent for and that was to go and call a bride amen for Isaac his dad wanted to see him get the right bride not just any bride but the right bride this Prophet was sent to call out the right bride to set the church in order sir to bring Church order to show us how to love our wives to show our wives how to love our husbands and to show all of us how to love our Heavenly husband and how do we do that just follow the word of the prophet and get back to the word and push aside all of our traditions and all of our teachings I love the song that sister kindness sung it's not time to be playing games it's not time to be playing Church brothers and sisters it's not at all time to say I I've heard it all there's nothing you can teach me who are you looking for if that's what you're saying I want to say this to you who is it that you're looking for to talk to you are you looking for God to speak to you or is a church experience that and that alone it's just a church experience God sent the prophet for a purpose to call a church to call a bride of his own choosing and the only way that bride is going to be called out the only way she's going to be that bride the true identification of her being the bride is she will get in line with the word she will line right up with that word and if she is his bride She'll follow his word holy amen I think it's so beautiful She'll follow his word holy let's turn over to Joshua chapter 14 now today I just want to be sure that we're clear I'm not picking on wives and I'm not picking on husbands I I'm not trying to pick on anyone what I want to do is encourage us to follow the lord holy amen hallelujah we want to see the Lord move in our lives amen there's only one way we're going to see that happen brothers and sisters in Joshua chapter 14 a very familiar scripture I I hope to refer to it all the way through this morning verse 6 then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in gilgal and Caleb the son of jauna the kenite and said unto them Lord thou knowest the thing that the Lord said to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh barnea and we know what the thing the Lord said was there's only two of you that are actually going to go in to see the promised land all the rest of them who were there decided to follow the words of the spies the the other 10 that were with them we know 12 went into the promised land I won't go too far into that right now verse 7 says 40 years this is Caleb speaking here 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh barnea to aspy out the land and I was brought him word again as it was in Mine Heart nevertheless the Brethren that went up with me now notice he says the Brethren he doesn't say the enemies he doesn't say the the people from the land he says the Brethren nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt how did they make the heart of the people melt go back and read the story of Kadesh barnea what were they doing murmuring what were they doing talking what were they doing having Whispers And conversations in the background about what they thought the ministry should be doing about what the prophet should be saying and how how they couldn't do it look at the natural circumstances but what did God say hey you know what you're not willing to take me at my word you're not willing to trust me all the way away with you can you imagine how they must have felt we know there was a great mourning in the land because they heard the word of the Prophet they were right there they probably were I'm going to say in their day they were probably message theologians they probably knew more than that Minister could ever learn that's right they've probably been in the message for generations for decades but for some reason some reason they just couldn't go all the way they couldn't they couldn't actually accept the word for their day nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt my and they paid for it didn't they but I wholly followed the Lord my God brothers and sisters today I want to say let that be our scripture let that be where we rest in the word of God I holy followed the word of my God there's coming a day where we're going to have to stand before God ourselves ourselves with no one else around there ain't going to be no church there ain't going to be no family there ain't going to be no Traditions nobody is going to be able to speak on our behalf except for Jesus Christ and you know we could say hey we cast out devils in your name and he'll say you know I I I don't think I ever even knew you we didn't have a personal relationship for for some reason I I don't I don't think I knew you but if we wholly follow him amen then Jesus Christ is our intercessor he's the one that's going to say enter thou into the joy of the Lord come on my servant you've made me pleased you've really done what I wanted you to do all the way along verse n says and Moses swear on that day saying surely the land whereon thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou Hast wholly followed the Lord my God remember this is Caleb speaking here he's in a position where he's beginning to recognize this is not just a historical teaching about the message I've seen signs I've seen wonders I've followed the Lord holy all the days of my life and now I I've actually got this great challenge ahead of me there's this great mountain in front of me and I can choose to go around the mountain I can choose to step back from the mountain or I can put my shoulders back and square up and say I holy followed the Lord in my day and we know that's what he's doing here verse 10 says and now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 4 and5 years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and5 years old old 85 years old he's an old man as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now I pray that brothers and sisters we would be able to have that testimony right now my strength is just as strong right now as the day that I got saved the day that I recognized that God came in flesh died on a cross so that I could receive Redemption when I recognize that for the first time in my life my I pray that would be our testimony brothers and sisters oh my as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me and as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in sometimes we find our our flesh our bodies are weak we know that Jesus had to say it to her his disciples one time when he wanted them to pray in the garden you know I know the spirit is willing but your flesh is weak you just keep falling asleep when it's time to pray I pray that we won't be falling asleep when it's time to pray amen verse 12 now therefore what does he say give me this mountain give me this mountain don't take it away from me don't don't don't find a way around it don't help me tunnel through it don't don't make it Tunnel Mountain for me like in B but give me an opportunity Lord to go forwards in the power and strength of your might and now give me this mountain wherefore the Lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how oh my the anakims were there uhoh no no no no no we got to back up sorry we could have had that mountain but the Giants were there we need to step back you know the CPR one time they were actually going to Tunnel through the mountain tunnel Mountain but somebody came up with a a really smart idea naturally speaking and they said why would we tunnel through it when we could just go around it so instead of tunneling through the mountain they just went around it but they call the mountain Tunnel Mountain but you know Joshua wasn't looking for a way to tunnel under it he wasn't looking for a way to go around it but I love how he's so excited about it you know as I follow the lord holy and all of this and I'm in position oh now therefore give me this mountain wherefore the Lord spake in that day for thou heardest in the day how the anakims were there oh my the Giants and that the cities were great and Fen if so be the Lord will be with me what then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said brothers and sisters we know full well that Caleb is a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost the one that would lead and guide Caleb that's right so now looking at our scripture through that lens I want to go back to Ephesians 5 and say what's our Promised Land because remember the prophet that we believe that we follow holy he said the book of Ephesians perfectly parallels the Book of Joshua amen amen and maybe he said it this way I'm going to back up in case anybody is trying to challenge me on that maybe he said it this way that Joshua perfectly parallels the book of Ephesians he could have said it one way or the other but I know he said it I'm not claiming to be a theologian I'm just claiming to know that I know the man who wrote this Bible you know the prophet he said get back to the word what we're talking about today brothers and sisters is recognizing our position as husbands all of the responsibility is ours full stop amen that's what the word of God says we can say that we've taken a bride and everything is wrong and she's maybe acting out and and if that's the case what's wrong with you where do we stand before the Lord there has to be a reason for it but same thing with the with the husband if the husband is is is not willing to follow the word of God what's what's going on with the wife we are supposed to be one but I just love how it says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord you know what I want to talk about today brothers and sisters I guess if I had to maybe put a title on this sermon I I would title it leadership I would want it to be titled leadership and we're probably going to talk about that today with the young people about leadership we have got to be willing to be led you know brother bradam talks about leadership right at the end of his ministry the culmination of the entirety of the message and we had talked about this in the past how we have communion with the Lord Jesus Christ we know communion was the very last message but just before that was leadership you know if we're not willing to be led then we're never going to be able to have communion that's just never going to happen everybody has to be led we get led into this world brother brandham says and we get LED out of this world that's just the way it works we can't help it but we have the ability to thank the Lord that he has given us the ability to recognize his calling to call a bride a wife of his own choosing and if she is truly his bride then she will follow follow his word holy amen hallelujah you won't be interested in listening to traditions and saying ah I don't know I've done it another way all these years and everything will be fine you know what don't take my word for it take the word of God for it take the message of the hour for it see what the prophet of God says thank you you know in the exposition of the seven Church ages the samian church age we've already gone over this we we went over this in uh my it's getting warm in here we went went over this in uh on Wednesday night services the exposition of the seven Church agents did you get the the emails brother you have this one why does he stand by brother brandham is talking about how God sometimes lets us go through trials Let's us go through tribulations why does he just stand by sometimes why does he stand by he says he says the reason is in Romans 8:17 and 18 and if children then air Hees of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together sorry I'm just getting really hot here I just need to get some ventilation I might even have to do a little bit of this hope that's okay that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US amen very familiar quote here I know we we we all know it and if we don't I I recommend that we just look it up and maybe consider it a little bit the reason for this he says is that character simply is never made without suffering because we're born into the message of the hour our parents are message Believers for decades does not mean we have the character of Christ in our lives we have got to have a new birth experience amen Mary the mother the one that the Catholic Church wants to esteem greater than Christ she had to have an upper room experience she had to be one of the 120 upstairs that came stumbling out like drunk people into the streets and one moment they were afraid of the Romans they were afraid they were going to get persecuted and hurt for talking about this Jesus but in the next moment they had boldness like they'd never seen how does that happen it's the glory which shall be revealed in US brother bam says the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift amen so if it's a victory how do we get that Victory brothers and sisters we don't go out and get fed to Lions do we some might say well my co-workers they call me a Holy Roller that's part of it I would say but I would say the greater part of it is where we take our own will and we actually bring it to center with the word of God with the message of the hour we're willing to surrender all of our thoughts and all of our ideas and say be it unto me just like Mary said according to Thy word and what happens when that happens we have the new birth we get the power of the highest overshadowing us and we have a new life starting to come forward inside of us and that life Shall be Called who Jesus amen Jesus the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift we've got to surrender our own will if we're going to see Victory a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule so now we come to the stage where we have to say well what character are we talking about here because I could say that fellow he's a real good character that fellow he's got a really good character I I I've got a really good character but we can all have different characteristics but you know brothers and sisters this character that we're talking about here is the life of Jesus Christ that's right we know the word of God says let this mind that was also in who bew in you so if that's the case it's not us any longer it's got to be his character living out through US Christ brings Redemption to the church Hallelujah we all say Amen to that Christ is the masculine the church is the the feminine husbands you bring Redemption to your families amen you bring Redemption to your wives we know that's exactly according to the word of God Amen we know that a Christian marriage in this world is exactly a reflection of our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ amen and if it's not a reflection of the Lord Jesus Christ then there's something wrong a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic if we want to try and demand I've got power you submit I'm going to say this from the pulpit you've got a little bit of something satanic going on right brothers and sisters it either is or it isn't that's right but when we're willing to lay down our life for our brides and say hey you know what search me and try me Lord just like the prophet said invisible Union of the Bride when he opens in his prayer he says search our hearts and try us Lord oh but Lord search me and try me first unless we're willing to do that brothers and sisters I want to say this real loud and clear we're not ready to be married yet we've got to be willing to lay down our lives for our wives and I say Lord help me but if we're willing to take and take the word of God if we're willing to take the word of God without being in our position correctly as a husband and try and usurp some sort of authority and say the word of God says this you're supposed to submit without being in line ourselves that's a satanic thing that we've got going on and I say Lord help us not have anything satanic in our lives but you know it's either good or it's bad it's it's either it's either of the Lord or it's of the devil right there's two Spirits at play here so don't get too uneasy when I say it's satanic because there's a lot of satanic there's a lot of evil in this world that's right power without character is satanic but Power with character power with the character of Christ in our lives power with and I'll say this brothers and sisters we might even be in a situation I'm talking from experience here now we might even be in a situation where we know that we're out of order according to the word of God we are out of order according to the word of God we just don't know how to do it you know what as long as we are willing to say Lord I don't even know how to do it oh Lord just help me I don't know what this guy's preaching he keeps harping on it over and over again but but but but I believe it is the word of God help me to realize it help me to apply it in my life if we're willing to do that that's all it takes he'll come on the scene and he'll show us that's right and you know what he won't just show us he'll actually begin to do it through us we'll come to the place where we'll say how come did that happen that way why did I behave that way that's beyond my thinking and even your wife will say what's wrong with you buddy maybe your husband will say whoa what happened to her I want to say this if you want to see your wife change then take a look in the mirror see if we line up with the word of God and if we don't all we need to do is do that's all that's where I said though so sometimes many times oh my many times we've just got a little bit of a garment on us still we want to go on to that cross just with Christ but we don't want to do it fully naked we just want to have that loin cloth right we just want to have that little bit of Pride left in our lives we don't no we're not going to go that far it's kind of like doors and doors brother bradam talks about it we can have the Lord come into our life into our house and we could bring them into the Foy we could bring them into the kitchen into the living room hey check out the beautiful Lazy Boy recliner there why don't you fix yourself a sandwich just make yourself right at home but don't you dare go into that room under the stairs I I've got some private boxes in there that nobody gets to see I've got some hurts in my life that I never want to talk about I I've got some some things maybe from my family that I can't talk about you don't have to talk about just tell him about just invite him to come inside that room just one time open that door come and look at all the boxes come and take those boxes and you know what he'll do he'll take those boxes right out of that room and throw them into the sea of his forgetfulness but as long as we're willing to keep that door locked and keep it private then we're going to stay right where we are exactly where we are there will be no progression but to try and usurp any kind of authority without first being in line with the word of God oh my we're actually trying to demonstrate a satanic power and you know I think many times we don't even realize it in our lives it's just the way we've always done it we've lived this way according to the message of the hour our whole entire lives our parents did this is the way it's always been it's not the way that God wants it the only way that God wants it is according to his word that's the only way God wants it is according to his word and how do we see his word through the lens of a Vindicated prophet in our day and we're willing to subject ourselves to that he goes on to say and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and has sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him what do we have to overcome we can look around and say we got to overcome Hollywood we got to overcome the internet we got to overcome our jobs we got to overcome the pride of life where we want to just amass Supreme amounts of wealth we want to be so flush with cash we've got to overcome all of that we've got to overcome our pride you know the biggest thing that we've got to do is overcome ourselves overcoming ourselves and subjecting ourselves one to another in the fear of God so long as we're submitting ourselves one to another another in the fear of God that is the starting point that is the place where we begin amen hallelujah brother Brown goes on to say and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared we know that this is exactly the scripture right that's right it's not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes hallelujah oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation how is that tribulation going to be brothers and sisters many times in leoda where we're rich and we're increased with goods and we don't have any need of anything do we the worst that can happen to us for the most part is maybe we'll have a a a situation where there'll be a global pandemic and everything will shut down all of our businesses and the churches and everything and everything is disrupted right I mean we have other things that go on in our lives but I'm just saying that we we go through tribulation but not really tremendous tribulation Maybe like some people do where they're actually persecuted for speaking the name of Jesus Christ where they'll be actually taken and thrown in prison where they will maybe be executed where where family members will just disappear and people will wonder what happened to them while they were Believers we don't suffer that kind of tribulation what we suffer is trying to get over ourselves and the devil knows it full well that's why we have this barrage of things in our lives that continually seem to to drag us down but you know the word of God God says and brother bradam says it here think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that's what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we all have trials those who say they don't watch out we're all tried and chastened his sons we're all tried and chastened Sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it he even says it isn't of God brothers and sisters we have to have trials we have to have situations we have to have tribulations but it's working out the victory of Christ's character in Our Lives who wants our own character anyway we got to see the old man die Hebrews 126 and8 For Whom the Lo Lord loveth he chasteneth now remember he chasteneth when we step into the role of trying to chasen One Another We're actually stepping into the position of God and I want to say this we're potentially getting into the place where we're actually getting into maybe a little bit of Satan Satanism that little satanic thing where we have a little bit of power without the character of Christ behind us we don't want to persecute one another we love one another it's the Lord that does the chastening and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth but if ye be without chastisement if we're not willing to take it whereof all our partakers then ye are bastards and not Sons were not even counted to be one of his my you know I started looking at this power without character and uh it just made me think of a couple different different people in the Bible and uh there's a couple of real Stark examples of power without character and the first one is Pharaoh we know that God allowed pharaoh to raise up but if you want to know specifically where I'm going I'll tell you and that's simply this he heard that there was a message of a deliverer didn't he and he knew it was a prophetic utterance he knew that so he was afraid it automatically brought an insecurity and a fear to him so what did he do all the children two years of of age and younger kill them all just wipe them out but there was that one wasn't there that one called Moses that was put into the reads and he was saved that was a a sign of an insecure leader that was someone who had all the power in the land with no character no Christlike character and we know it repeated exactly the same isn't it interesting how it repeated exactly the same in the time of Jesus the word came through through the Magi Herod caught wind of it oh my there's something going on in the land there's a prophetic utterance what there's a messiah oh my he's he's a baby oh my two years and under kill them all and we know that it was exactly according to scripture Matthew 2:18 in Rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning Rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not because the whole land all the children were killed Spirits don't die right power without character we know that Satan loves to go to church and he's the most religious out of everyone I uh I find it interesting when you get the folks that are I call it hyper religious hyper religious everything is absolutely spiritual some things in this life aren't really spiritual we know that we're not wrestling against flesh and blood we're wrestling against principalities and Powers but sometimes you can't even have a conversation without somebody making some sort of spiritual thing it it it it yeah we don't want to go too far one way or the other brothers and sisters we know there's a middle of the road and I know we've heard it said in our lives I think this is real good real important when we go when we pass on what would people say about us what would be the Legacy that we leave behind and we've heard it said what would our enemies say say about us and I think that's so important too what our enemies say that we we are spiteful we Christians but we're not afraid to put up our Dukes we're not afraid to go blow for blow in terms of words they can say something and we can say something they can say something and I can say something better they can say something that's really hurtful and I can get even more hurtful than them but I'm a believer I'm a Christian right I'm not afraid to tell you in the next sentence I'm a Believer what kind of character is that and I want to go further with it and say should we pass on what would our spouses say about us what would our families say about us those ones that know us the most intimately what would our children say about us I say Lord help me amen Lord help me check me examine me I don't want to be saying these words thinking that I'm anywhere cuz I know I'm nowhere without him amen but we've got to be willing to subject ourselves to his word amen wholly entirely not partially 1963 a trumpet gives an uncertain sound you know what brother Ram talks about when he says the trumpet gives an uncertain sound if you haven't heard this message I strongly recommend listening to it we know it's a it's actually a scripture but in here just a quote I've got a few quotes 146 if the Church of the Living God is the Church of the Living God if the Church of the Living God is the Church of the Living God it'll put forth the word of the Living God it sounds so simple he says you don't have to add peacock feathers nowhere and every feather in there will be adjoined to a peacock you can believe that and every feather that's joined into the Church of God will be the word of God he will never inject anything else but the word amen cuz the nature of the spirit puts out only the word amen amen I'm getting to feel religious right he goes on to say not nothing you try to do nothing you manufacture so we can try and do all we want brothers and sisters but it's not going to bring us the right the right results he goes on to say you can't manufacture you can't manufacture salvation you can't manufacture the gifts you've got to Bear the gifts certainly see the Sheep doesn't manufacture wool he has wool because he's a sheep he just Bears the wool the cherry tree doesn't manufacture cherries it just Bears cherries because the life of it is that it's that way isn't it beautiful to think that the fruit of the spirit it's not even for us the fruit of the spirit is on our branches for those other people that come around to meet us so that they can pick of that fruit and say wow there's there's there's there's kindness and there's love and there's longsuffering and you know every single time I get around you I just don't understand it I just feel good you're always so happy there's so much joy in your life amen hallelujah they in of that fruit and they're eating it they're partaking of it brother the ROM says and the Church of the Living God doesn't inject this to try to make themselves look like something the Church of the Living God doesn't have to manufacture and put out there the Church of the Living God doesn't have to do all kinds of different things to try and get people around them to think that they believe they just are they just live a life amen they don't have to try to make themselves look like something they're already what they are by the grace of God Amen and the word of God is joined with them and they're joined with the word and the works that was brought forth in that perfect one Jesus Christ God manifested in flesh will produce itself through every Born Again believer amen isn't that good it just will it's not something that we have to try and manufacture amen I don't have to come to church a certain number of times in a month or in a year to be a believer I don't have to tithe a certain amount I don't have to come to prayer meetings a certain amount I don't have to go to communion service a certain amount I don't have to dress a certain way I I don't have to not smoke I don't have to not drink I don't have to not carouse I just do all of that because I am Jesus Christ God manifested in flesh will produce itself through every born-again believer he said so amen nothing else now that's something certain now we're changing gears as we as we go forwards brothers and sisters I'm not interested in talking about God sending a prophet and talking about history like we have there's tremendous stories about that but what about that to you what does God sending a prophet God having a Vindicated Propet in the land mean to you does it change your life does it make us believe the word of God more Hallelujah does it cause us to step up when we know we're falling down or does it push us back and we say oh no that's too much it it hurts brother Barry oh you're being really strong you know what where we're at we're at a place where it's not time to be playing games if we were going to be allh handed rifles today with bayonets on them and full clips of ammunition because another country was invading our country and the only way we're going to survive is so that we can get out there and actually kill the enemy and we were all handed rifles today how would we be talking would we we would we just be saying you know let's try and be strong let's not get too excited because you know people could get upset we'd be screaming amen I'd be screaming saying take no prisoners don't let those anakins live brothers and sisters take your Mountain amen you followed the Lord holy all of your life what have you got to be afraid of you're in your Promised Land am you don't have to be a prisoner and you know what happens brothers and sisters unfortunately it's the truth we can come to the place where we can become a prisoner of this word that's right we can become a prisoner of this word where we say we believe the message of the hour but we don't exercise the message of the hour if we're not willing to exercise the message of the hour we might as well not claim it now that's really strong and I wouldn't say just walk away and get fed up what I would say is get moving you've got the greatest thing that's struck this Earth since Jesus Christ the tying up of all of the Loose Ends amenallah there's nothing Stopping You brothers and sisters there's nothing stopping us the devil's going to come around and say no no no you can't the word of God says yes yes yes you can am doesn't matter if it's a giant just be like Caleb oh my but if you don't follow the word of God holy how could you be like Caleb yes sir we know the word of God says that if if our hearts don't condemn us then what we can have confidence towards the word of God we can have confidence towards the Lord but when we've got that little thing there that little thing there it's not going to work Ephesians chapter 5 going back to our our theme today about leadership submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God am you're not greater she's not less we're all children of God Amen and you know if you listen to questions and answers you hear brother bradam talk about how a Son of God ought to treat a daughter of God he ought to remember that she should be very much respected and never treated like the world like husbands treat their world worldly wives and he says it in a way that if you're wondering what I'm asking you better go listen to it because it's strong we better examine the way we treat our wives submitting ourselves one to another in the fear of God it's important if we're not willing to do that we're not going to see the power of God and and you know at the end of it it says he I speak of this great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church brothers and sisters Once Upon a Time this was a mystery we had a Vindicated Prophet that came and made this mystery history amen because we're talking about now the life of the husband coming into the wife the church the Lord Jesus Christ coming to life manifesting In the Flesh and if this message isn't causing Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever to manifest in our flesh there's something wrong with this message and I want to say clearly there's nothing wrong with this messag so who's manifesting in our flesh are we willing to subject ourselves to the word of God holy amen or in part just partially just as much as I can take it you know it's it's a bit much in strongs strongs concordance you know oh my sorry yeah ah sometimes I get a little too excited I apologize verse 29 of Ephesians chapter 6 oh maybe we'll go to 28 so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church I got looking at these words here hated is g344 Meo and it means to detest especially to persecute I know that sometimes in our lives the devil will come around and try and get us to actually persecute we try and get us to say to the wife oh you didn't do this and oh you didn't do that and and oh you forgot about the other thing and oh look at your hair and look at your skirt and the the clothes aren't pressed and and the house is dirty and and and and and and and and and and and and it just got me thinking about this how quickly we can begin doing this if we're not careful brothers and sisters because the word of God says that no man ever yet hated his own flesh never yet persecuted his own flesh but we know that when we have a wife she is our own flesh so when we begin to do that with her we're not hurting her even though we are hurting her we're persecuting ourselves now I'm saying that from a uh uh maybe a a selfish perspective as husbands but think about the damage to her when we start doing that if we dare start doing that think about the damage to her sometimes we can do things that takes years decades maybe forever sometimes it's impossible to heal wounds that we cause but we know nothing is impossible through the Lord Jesus Christ I love how he goes on to say for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth what does that word nourisheth mean Tre to rear up to maturity and I always thought this was to nourish if to make sure that there was maybe some lotion and maybe the skin was nourished and you know maybe there was nutrients there was proper groceries and stuff but that's not what the word of God says at all it says that as a husband what what we're learning here what I'm learning here is that we're supposed to make sure that our wives are coming to maturity we're supposed to be raising them up that's what that word nourish means g625 e Tre to rear up to maturity I.E genitive case to cherish or train bring up and nourish husbands it's up to us to be doing this with our wives and to cherisheth it even as the Lord the church oh my who doesn't want to be cherished by the Lord today raise your hand no nobody wants to raise their hand because we all want to be cherished by the [Applause] Lord so we ought to be cherishing our wives it's G 2282 phpo probably it says to warm to brood I.E figuratively to Foster to cherish anybody ever seen a brooding hen how hens are with their young when they've hatched the the hens yeah they put their wings out they puff out and if the children children if those little chicks start poking their heads out she covers them she keeps them she you can take her and you can push her we were in Hawaii one time and we found a Broody hen with chicks under her and we kind of pushed her a little bit and and the chicks ran right over under her and she just kept puffing out and protecting him it's amazing to see that but it's to Foster to cherish to brood to keep warm who would not want to cherish their own flesh for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh there's coming a point in time in our lives brothers and sisters where we need to no longer be under our mothers we no longer need to be under our fathers but we need to actually be married to the Lord Jesus Christ where we have got to have our own experience and we know full well from the Garden of Eden that there isn't going to be three people in the marriage that was created in heaven there's only going to be two it's going to be the Lord Jesus Christ and his bride and they twoo are going to become one amen my now let's get into some quotes let's start preaching let's have church 1963 Christ is the mystery of God God revealed he says and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man and as the days of lot when a modern Billy gram and Oral Roberts went down into Sodom and preached to them sodomites and blinded their eyes see with the gospel one Angel stayed back a messenger with Abraham and the elected group the one that didn't say father Son and Holy Ghost that didn't say I saw three I didn't say Lords I saw Lord there was one God amen a messenger with Abraham and the elected group and what kind of a sign did he do see what did he call what did Abraham call him Elohim God manifested in flesh and isn't it beautiful to think when I was contemplating this brothers and sisters he came in the flesh and he sat down and he ate meat and he drank milk and he ate bread and he ate butter and it all just sort of signified to me in that moment that he came right down to where Abram was when he was giving him a name change don't think that we need to become some sort of Pious holy individual before we're going to connect with God he knows exactly where we are he'll come down and have lunch with you if you invite him if you follow his word holy amen hallelujah God manifested in flesh back in that day what about this day amen Jesus showing that he himself God in him will be manifested in where his bride am his bride in the last days he says oh my just no end to it just a revelation of God it's Eternal just keeps moving on and on I just can't help but think about the the the the scripture in Revelations let us rejoice and be exceedingly god let's be very very glad why for the marriage of the Lamb hath come we know the scripture all well and his wife hath made herself ready not not the bride many times I've quoted that the bride has made herself ready no no no it's moved signifies something intimate has happened there's a relationship there and it's not it's not the bride any longer his wife hath made herself ready how do we do that by believing this word by following this word holy that's how we do it you know sometimes we're just a little bit afraid to and that's really what it comes down to that's the bottom line I've done it this way all my life and I'll say this that's why we are where we are but when we're willing to step out by faith and say hey you know what maybe I haven't got it right maybe it hasn't worked the way that I thought it should if we're willing to step out by faith and show him that step of Faith where I'm taking my pride and I'm just going to say goodbye Pride I I don't need you anymore I trust the Lord holy I'm I'm willing and Desiring to follow his word holy in a new way that I never have before so that he could potentially bless me and you know what brothers and sisters if you're willing to do that if you say to him God be God and I'll follow you that way I Promise You by experience I'm a witness to it he will bless you amen sometimes we're just a little afraid to take God's word to to take it holy well all say we take God's word but sometimes we're just a little afraid to take it wholly and you know what it takes to do that it takes being honest we've got to be willing to be honest not just with the word but with ourselves that's right we got to be honest with ourselves and and what that means is to allow the word to correct us when we need correction and if we can't receive correction according to the word we know what we already read it says that we're not his son I just think this is so beautiful in Joshua 14 you know he talks about his Brethren that went up with him doesn't matter what anyone else does brothers and sisters doesn't matter what anybody else says it only matters where we are in our own hearts amen are we able to say that I followed you holy and you know what we might be able to look back in our lives and say you know um for so long I didn't follow him wholly and and I've been afraid to maybe take a step forward and make a change and do things differently it doesn't mean that we can't follow him wholly today and I guarantee you he's calling for that if there's someone that hasn't he wants us all to follow him wholly and if we're willing to do that we will see the power of God manifest in our lives amen we will see the character of the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives talking about the word taking on flesh I can see it's already 12 I I just my how time flies brother bradam I'll call the musicians or I we'll keep going for a while here he says we see the end time this is out of the token we see the end time signs of the Holy Ghost return back upon the people as it was in the days of lot how the Holy Spirit worked through that human flesh there that was God manifest in the flesh it's so good to look back we can say look at brother brandham God manifest In the Flesh now we don't make brother brandham God but we can see his Spirit was standing two feet from him we know that he wasn't the son of man he says I was a son of man revealing the son of man how God would manifest himself in his bride in that day and show the same sign Jesus said it'll be the same thing in the last days we see it many times brothers and sisters because we had a prophet a Vindicated Prophet come on the scene and have the signs and wonders we say unless we see the signs of Wonders we're not actually in the word I want to tell you something the only thing that's going to separate us is our willingness to be in the word if we're found in the word then we've got the greatest sign and wonder that we could ever manifest in the day in which we live and that's God manifesting himself in flesh because human beings in this age they can't line up with the word they never will they will never do it when their eyes were open 1964 but when you see the son of man revealed the word come back in human flesh a man that eat the Flesh of a calf drink the milk from a cow eat cakes that was made Upon A hear and was called Elohim amen a man with Dusty clothes on God manifest in flesh boy it sure sounds good back there doesn't it what about today where is he today brothers and sisters there he was on Earth manifest In the Flesh and said as it was in the days of Sodom when the son of man is being revealed in the last days the world would be in a Sodom condition and here it is amen when was this preached 1964 he says here it is could he see where we are today where are we today brothers and sisters here it is why here it is my I'm sorry the identific the identified maybe stand with me as we close the identified Christ of all ages remember God changes his form and morphe the Greek word means he puts on a different mask like in kmen or something or Shakespeare's plays he's like an actor he changes his form all what those prophets were that was God in those prophets Jesus said so you call them Gods who the word of God came to and here I am the Son of God how do you condemn me oh my the same thing is today it's God manifested in flesh the message of the hour the light of the day we can't have them other messages back there they have to be done lived up here we live in a glare of a light that's the greatest Deb the greatest robbery the nation's ever known was performed in England here not long ago done by false light $7 million Train Robbery never was known before known of before in history that was a great indebt a marker to the age of villains in the world and the greatest marker of villains in the age in the world that we ever live in is a false light in this hour that we're living in trying to put us back under some kind of a Creed in things when we're living Epistles or in other words we're Epistles that's living that's been written and now living out the word of God as he promised in the hour manifested word Epistles written that's been living out that was what Apostles was and we know the word of God says that were written Epistles read of all men we can say what we want to say but people are reading our lives he says that's what John the Baptist was he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness he tried to tell them that he was also Malachi 3 behold I send my messenger before my face prepare the way before the people he was that living word amen and the true Born Again Church in this hour is the Living Word of God it's the word of this age made manifest brothers and sisters don't put it off on the prophet don't put it out there into some future age amen you've got to say I follow the word holy and I believe the word of the Vindicated Prophet it makes it hard for us just say Lord search me and try me Amen Let Me subject myself to your word yes the true Born Again Church in this hour is the Living Word of God Amen it's the word of this age made manifest and here he says search the scriptures and see what's supposed to be in this age there is Christ Living again just changing his mask from one to the other I say Lord let me follow you holy today let's just just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we know that this word that you've given to the church in the age in which we live is is more than we can bear as humans amen father many times we don't even know what way to turn we don't even know what way to go but Lord Jesus help us father to come back to your word amen help us Lord Jesus to not keep a filing cabinet of wrongs in our lives help us not keep drawers and boxes of things that have hurt us father that we'll never allow you to go through that will'll never ever open up in our minds and allow you to take out and heal for us Lord we know that we've read it this morning that Lord Jesus for us to have the power manifested of the most high God living in our lives is going to only come by trials father you are only going to give it to us by becoming Victorious over our trials and the only way we're ever going to do it is to surrender ourselves unto you so father I pray this morning that you would allow us to just subject ourselves unto you father oh Lord Jesus maybe for some of us help us to do it fresh help us to do it the first time ever in our lives Lord maybe there's others that just need a refilling Lord Jesus whatever our needs are you know us father search us and try us now father help us to line up with your word we don't know how many more days we have father it's a Sodom condition in this world and we know that everything is in line father father for the going away of your church oh Father I can't help but think you're just crying out for your bride to just stay in line we know that was the vision given to your Prophet just stay in line oh Father the first version that he saw of the Bride she was getting out of step and the reason for it was because she was looking at others help us to not look at others Lord help us to look away to Jesus help us to look to you father to keep our Focus to keep ourselves in step with your word Lord oh Father we pray that you would just fill us with your spirit Lord give us a renewed oh Father sense of being Lord Jesus help us to know that you are not the great I was but you are The Great I Am oh Father be God in our lives Lord Jesus help us to line up with your word that we could say in Our Moment of decision in our Valley Lord when the Giants come
