along the way we love you and we thank you and we just ask all of these things Lord in the name above every name the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Hallelujah Welcome to our visitors Mr Lenae it's been a long time God bless you everyone else if you have your Bibles this morning I'd just like to read from John chapter 15. John chapter 15. start with verse 1. certainly a privilege to be in the house of the Lord this morning John chapter 15. again today talking about the the True Vine verse 1 says I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the Vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the Vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples the scripture here could easily be referred to as the scripture of Jesus speaking to his disciples which indeed he was the historical account he was speaking in a parable to his disciples and and it could easily be said that that's exactly what he did and that's exactly what that scripture is and that's all there is about it but we know we had a prophet in our day come and say that every scripture has a compound meaning and Revelation and today I I want to with you my brothers and my sisters take this scripture and lift it up out of history and make it a living word because it's not just a Jesus that came to Calvary and died and rose again and someday we'll meet him we're speaking about the Jesus Christ who is here right now with us in our midst we are talking about a living God let's just go to him in prayer gracious heavenly father one more time we're just so thankful that we can open our lips and and close our eyes Lord Jesus and open our hearts unto you father we know there's no greater privilege on Earth than to be able to commune with you but first we know father we need to be led and the only way we'll ever have communion with you is to be led and not just led by a man but led by Your Word father because we know that your word is spirit and life and father we just take your word the way that you've given it to us in our day and we just apply it father we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated today I uh just a few announcements before we get into the word today um just such a beautiful thought I was looking at the calendar we're just about exactly one day away from the first day of spring officially such a a wonderful thought even though it looks like we're in the middle of winter here and it certainly feels like it but you know what I I think that we can actually just call the things that aren't as though they are and the things that are as though they're not um I can bear witness that down south in North Carolina it's actually Springtime the grass is green the daffodils are popping up and the trees don't really have leaves on them except for a few right at the very top you can see green buds coming out just like a little paintbrush on the tops of the trees it's beautiful and you know what's coming our way I have a lasting memory of being there last weekend when I got on the plane on Tuesday Morning leaving the hotel it was Pitch Black it was very early but I heard one sound that made me stop for a moment and that was a robin you could just hear the robin chirping with all of its might in the darkness and I thought my isn't that just a wonderful sound that Springtime coming our way so I just wanted to remind us that spring is on the way and we have Easter meetings coming up it's the week of the 5th of the ninth um Wednesday right through to Sunday it's a bit of a different thing here we haven't really done it and uh you know if you try different things you you never know you might get different results and we just want to try something a little different um just to have a little bit more church and I know that it's a lot of church to have services that many times so if you can't come because you have commitments or you have work or whatever it is it's okay the only thing is the idea is to get a little bit more Church get a little bit more of our time set aside just to see if God won't do something for us in our midst maybe we have a need in our lives maybe it's a personal need maybe it's in our family maybe we struggle with some scripture maybe we struggle with some message maybe there's something that we just don't understand we have a question or a longing in our heart if we set aside some time God will actually answer it for us if we're willing to just dedicate a little bit of time to him so if you can we certainly want to encourage you to I had said at one point if anybody has a friend or or family member that they've always wanted to invite to church it would be a perfect time for it we're going to split it up so it's not going to be all just brother Barry I'm only going to take one Service as far as I know and the rest of the Brethren are going to pitch in and and go for it so I think it's going to be a wonderful time in the Lord so pray for the April Easter meetings here and uh I'm sure we won't be disappointed this Wednesday coming up we have brother Mervin Lord willing he was going to take the service I'm not sure if that will still stand with sister Faye and the circumstances that's on the calendar and uh I haven't heard otherwise yet but you know we're always fluid and willing to just uh be be flexible we don't need to be rigid you know that's the way the Lord does things he he'll he'll take our paradigms and shatter them our ideas and traditions the way we think things should happen and and he'll just throw us off just to see if we really do believe we really do get upset we know the disciples are with them in the boat one time and that was a a real big deal but they didn't recognize who was in their boat but we know today who really is in our boat we don't have to worry so you know brother Mervin if you're listening this morning uh if it's if it's any trouble brother we'll certainly work it out we have a prayer meeting on Thursday the 16th we have a youth event on the 17th and then next Sunday we have a bit of a special Sunday we're gonna have a morning service and instead of a communion service this month we're going to have a worship service of praise and worship service and uh as the songs that we sang this morning I don't know how anybody could set still I couldn't I even came out and said to brother Peter I can't sit in that chair I have to move I have to express what's inside of me it's coming out and you know like we've said many times this is the quietest place we're ever going to be right here um there's something special about the thought of the redeemed and how the redeemed worship you know when the morning Stars sang together all of the Angels they sang together they sang together on a regular basis but there was a time where the sons of God shouted for Joy brothers and sisters and I can't help but think the reason they shouted for Joy is because they recognized they were redeemed they were not like the angels that were created to never fall they were created to fall and you know when we hear that word the the sons of God shouting for Joy I just can't help but put myself there and think you know what I was there before the foundation of the world not not from the foundation of the world because there was a time where it was starting from the foundation of the world but there's a group of people who are the sons and daughters of God who were from before the foundation of the world back in the mind of God before the before my goodness I I could just get started with that but we're going to have a praise and worship service if you have a special by all means feel welcome to bring it if you have never done a special and you've always wanted to it's a great opportunity just make a Joyful Noise is what the word says you don't have to be perfectly trained on key and and and and a master of it just make a Joyful Noise and express what the Lord's done for you and you know what if you don't want to bring a special just come and bring your lick of fire together and just see what the Lord will do next Sunday the 18th we're gonna have an evening worship service we'll just start at six o'clock and we'll just see what the Lord wants to do certainly like to thank brother Toby for the service last week really enjoyed that yeah amen you know it means a lot to to I would say a minister to a pastor to go away to have the ability the the desire to go away for whatever the reason and to know that someone is back home that is just going to put their shoulder to the wheel there's no alternate agenda it's just preaching the word of God knowing that we're together we're we're United together under one headship one leadership and we're pushing for the same thing it's just a wonderful thought it did my heart good to have a conversation Saturday night with our brother I want to bring greetings from many ministers in in all over the states actually from Ohio all the way over to I think even California there were some from Arizona there was some for Virginia I think there was Kentucky and uh and uh North Carolina South Carolina all over the place brother Wayne Lawson specifically said to send his greetings to the church in Calgary brother Daryl ward he said send his greetings to the church in Calgary Pastor Josh Bennett he was the pastor of the host Church in uh in Newton North Carolina where we were he said greet the church and brother George Smith was there he turned up and uh you know if you need any materials about the message witnessing materials he is a witnessing machine for the message of the hour he has all kinds of printed materials and we know Jeffersonville is no longer printing materials but there's some that are and so he has a lot and it's a really interesting thing having a conversation with him just before kovit I was working on seeing if we could get brother George Smith to come here and uh I really want to I want to get him here we're going to see if we can do it I invited him again he has a tremendous testimony he's a man you know it doesn't really do us any good spiritually it doesn't improve our spirituality but sometimes it's just nice to hear the stories of what it was like to be by the prophet we know that he married the prophet's daughter and he's got a lot of stories so it'd be neat to have him come and just spend a little bit of time with us he uh he said to say hello as well the whole premise of the weekend last weekend when I went to it was simply end time evangelism and and for pastors and for evangelists knowing that really we are working on the fields that are ready for Harvest but there's always going to be that last predestinated seed until that last predestinian sea comes in when that seed comes in and matures then we all go we know that day is approaching fast it's approaching rapidly and there's little points that I think were really really interesting to hear um you know brother Daryl ward he talked about it and I've mentioned this to a couple of the brothers but he he's a man now I think he's pressing 60 in in his life and he said when I first started evangelizing when I first started ministering the gospel I felt like the Lord was coming tomorrow because we were so far beyond the ministry of the Prophet I I think he started in like 1975 maybe the late 70s is when he started and uh he said I couldn't see that we would be going on as far as we have and I'm sure many of the Elder ministers those generals who are out there who have had their shoulder to the wheel for years and years for decades with this this message brother Daryl ward he said specifically though I see the end of my Ministry in sight and who knows if we see the coming of the Lord before that happens so the the idea here the premise is there's got to be someone that's going to grab the Baton and go forwards and carry this message of the hour to the people until we actually see that last predestinated seed come in and get mature so it was a really interesting time just to to listen to some of the experiences and and some of the the things that maybe work and some of the things that don't one of the things that the brothers did was talked about errors brother Daryl specifically talked about mistakes that he had made and you can't buy that kind of experience you can't go to a School of Theology and get that kind of information that kind of input it was it was really moving to hear the humility in the hearts of the brothers and just you know be able to hear things that can help so that was why I went there I was very very encouraged and uh I just think it's a wonderful time to get with Believers especially pastors and uh just to see what the Lord's doing and you know it's it's really no different there are no different people um there than they are here and and all around the world we're all believers we're all Sinners saved by grace but it's just an amazing thought to think that we're not just Sinners saved by grace we're Sinners that were saved by grace from before the foundation of the world so that we could actually fulfill the word for our day we could be the Willing recipients for that that call it the football that's going to be thrown to the end zone that long bomb that God knew someone would be there to be able to receive that word I uh wrapped up the whole weekend I was telling this on Wednesday but for those who didn't catch it I I was able to go through the Billy Graham Library in uh in Charlotte North Carolina and it's a tremendous thing to look at the life of that Minister and we know that anybody who knows the message of the hour knows that brother Branham talked about Oral Roberts and Billy Graham as those two angels that went down to Sodom he typed them as those two angels that went down to Sodom but not just out of the the story of Sodom but in the in the Sodom condition the world is in today and what did they do they went and preached the people blind and what did they preach them blind to the truth for their day but it's interesting when you look at it because they actually just even Billy Graham he preached to millions and millions of people he had answered prayers there's testimonies of answered prayers and you know brother Branham says it you know they didn't have a lot of healing but they certainly preached blindness and uh maybe we'll get into that quote a little bit later I don't know if we'll get there but it was just really moving to look at that that whole museum and to think that you know this man had such a tremendous testimony such an impact such an impact that they labeled him I don't know if it was the U.S or or the world Evangelical Society I don't know but they labeled him as America's pastor and a world the world evangelist and I'm not trying to pump the tires of Billy Graham today what I am trying to say is it's amazing because we believe in the seventh angel messenger Bar None we know who that is we know what that is we know all about that but I've just never really looked at the anointing of those two angels that went down to Sodom and when you stand there and you see the pictures and the videos of this man and you see how he impacted the world if you think about it if he is the pastor of the USA if we study Revelations chapter 13 13 stars 13 stripes if you've gone down that road before you'll understand how he could be America's Pastor because he smote them blind they think that they're rich increased with Goods they have need of nothing everything is fine they can have a pastor and they can have a worship team and and they can have the smoke and the lights and and if you want to talk about a laodicean worship just go and look at one of those churches that's not what we do and we never will we're so thankful that we can actually Worship the Lord in spirit and in truth Lord willing we're going to get into that discussion down the road here in 23 worship true worship and what that really means but to think about Billy Graham and how he impacted the world with his ministry and how humbling it is brothers and sisters to realize those people they they never had a chance they were smote Blind by the gospel that Jesus came he died on Calvary he was murdered he was put to death he was buried he rose again and and you know praise God I'm saved that's as far as it goes but as soon as you start to talk I just can't help but think about brother Gilbert now I and my father are one as soon as you start talking like that whoa then you're getting crazy right they're going to pick up stones and say you're nuts you're mad but that was the purpose of the message of the our brothers and sisters not to bring a bunch of mysteries but to unravel the Mysteries to unveil the Living God to say that he's no longer veiled that he's actually standing In Plain Sight as the Bride of Jesus Christ well we know uh the spirit of God is always moving and and and those two angels came and and they they they fulfilled their Ministry one of the things that we saw there which also I found to be fascinating they were on they showed clip after clip after clip in one of the video stations when you walk through this place of of how he was on talk shows and and they wanted to interview him as as America's pastor and they wanted to grill him and say really you're saved how do you know you're saved and just really ask them tough questions and try and rattle them and get them upset and shake them and you know what he wouldn't even Flinch he would just say you know what God loves you too all you have to do is accept him in the power of his resurrection and you too could be saved he loves everyone he would that nobody would be lost and he would just go into preaching but what that was it wasn't the man it was the anointing of that angel in the man and to close it off I thought it was just amazing because he spoke words that our Prophet spoke he said you know one day they're going to say that I died this is actually on his Tombstone one of these days they're going to say that I'm I've died but he said don't you believe them because I will have gone into the presence of God and I'll be more alive than I ever have in my entire life in the presence of God that's exactly the way brother Bradham would say it too we're never going to die we don't die Believers don't die the only only thing is it just changes our our location even unbelievers don't die which is terrible but you know it's true but we know there's only one form of eternal life we'll just clarify that there's only one form of turtle life and that's God's life the unbelieving will not be in an eternal hell brother Branham said it very clearly there's no eternal hell that's a trinitarian Doctrine to say that there's an eternal house forever and forever and that's a space of time brother Bradham said very clearly but there's only one thing that's Eternal and that's God's life Zoe God's own life and if we have his Spirit within us brothers and sisters then we've got nothing to worry about I just can't help but think about how the the spirit of God is just always moving you know and like we said at the very beginning we read this scripture here in John chapter 15 how he is the vine he's the True Vine and we are the branches and and how this scripture is moving and it's not just staying in one place saying that this is a scripture for the disciples in the time that Jesus was here on Earth under that anointing excuse me what he was doing was setting an example to say that anyone who has his spirit in them is going to be the branch and his life when when they receive his life his real life in them then that life is going to manifest through that individual and it's not something that we can put on we can't produce it we can't manufacture it it just happens it's just like the trees when the sun changes the the the the Azimuth in the sky when that sun changes and the light spectrum changes all of the trees recognize it's time to actually pull that life out from the roots and go up into the branches bring all of that that those chemicals so they can go back into the the branches and and Purge forth life that's exactly what we're talking about in John chapter 15. and I want to focus this morning specifically on verse 8 herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples we're not looking at the scripture and thinking that you know we're going to just go and bear some fruit we're going to go and do some spiritual exercises and and get some more fruit it's not like that at all the only way that we can do it is to actually submit ourselves unto the word and some people would say well submit yourself to the church submit yourself maybe to the elders or or or the Deacon board or or maybe just some more prayer all of that would certainly help but you know the only way that we're going to see more fruit in our lives is to submit ourselves unto the word unto Jesus Christ himself and if we do that then we will see this word not just stay as a stale stagnant word that was just for Jesus disciples one day it will become our word and we'll be able to say I see myself there and you know when brother Branham talks about it we probably heard it before we were talking about it on the weekend you know there's no accident that brother Branham says things and he tells that story of going to visit that little boy going to visit his auntie somewhere and he he sees himself in a mirror for the very first time but he has a recognition to say mama that's me I recognize myself there it has to be the same way in the word of God brothers and sisters this is not about other people if it's about other people then we're missing the point of the word for our day it's got to be a living word for us in our day the spirit of God is always moving and how does he move he moves by a pillar of fire uh but to lead the People by night and A Cloud by day and we know that we have witnessed both of those in our generation he is the same yesterday today and forever he is the same he does not change his ways we know that the the churches would like to say well he does change his ways and some of the stuff was just cultural and you know that was for a different age and you know the apostolic age ended somewhere along the way but nobody can put a date to it and say it ended specifically right there we know that the apostolic age is where we're living because it never ended but Brother Brad I'm the prophet for our day he said we're not just building a wall anymore brothers and sisters we're building a house and because we're building a house we've got to pay attention to the plan we've got to pay attention to the blueprints and you know from our little bit of building experience that we had one of the most important things that we could ever do when we're in the midst of a project and we're building and we have a question about what to do next is to invite the architect to come to our site our site and take a look at our plans and take a look at our building and take a look at our problem and help us come to a conclusion that will match the blueprint when we're done and it's no different for us today brothers and sisters this this this message is moving and and it's moving fast we can look at the world today and say the world is moving fast and AI it's like a freight train AI is on the scene and we know that it's continually learning and there's little voice boxes in people's houses all over the world millions and billions of them and telephones and computers AI is listening and learning and it's like a freight train but they say once it gets going they're not going to be able to stop it and what's going to happen then who knows the B system will have a pretty easy access to the whole entire world but I'm not saying that to scare us I'm saying not to say look if the world is gaining that much power and that much momentum and that much knowledge how much more the Sons and Daughters of God a recognition to who they really are the word of God is moving and one of these days it's going to move right on out of here it's going to change our bodies but I just think it's such a beautiful thought I don't think I'm done talking about this I'm not going to really go too far into it today but to think that you know the the church was was once just called out from from Egypt they were the called out from Egypt and then they were the called out Church brother Branham says they became the church the called out ones and they moved from the church to with Jesus where they were servants as disciples but there came a point in time in the relationship with Jesus and his disciples where he said you know what I no longer call you disciples I no longer call you servants but I call you friends there's a changing a developing a nurturing of the relationship it's growing and the same thing happens between a husband and wife I'm sure that we could hear the Elder say it you know I I never loved my wife as much as I do now I thought I loved her when we first got married but my goodness now many years down the road I love her more than I ever have and to think that this church now moved into the servant role and from the servant role moved into friends Jesus himself said I call you friends when we think about the prophet of God in our day thousands of years after that discussion with his disciples he said to them I no longer call you church I call you bride so that you'll understand what I'm going to hand you when I open these seals that wasn't William Mary and Branham saying those words brothers and sisters that wasn't just a fancy statement that was God himself standing on Earth saying hey something significant is about to happen the whole world is about to change in 1963 when the seals are open every one of them are all the way opened something is going to take place and I want to make sure that you understand it it's not going to be for everyone on the planet it's only going to be for a very select few those ones who were with me were in me from before the foundation of the world on the back of my mind I no longer call you servants I no longer call you church I no longer call you friends but I call you bride and so brothers and sisters that was back in 1963 where are we today this word is moving on to think that this relationship is growing it's evolving my goodness I can say it not just like my wife but as a Son of God I love him now today more than I've ever loved him so many things now I understand but you know the more I understand the more I recognize there's very little I could ever do all I have to do is just accept him and his word and when I do that I recognize that he is going to do it all he's going to perform it all like I said when I came back from North Carolina I was busy thinking that there was some way that I needed to pray some way I needed to come to church something I needed to do I had to fast I had to do all these different things so that we would see results when we pray you know what it's not up to me to bring the results it's up to him to bring the results the only thing I need to do is be in my position and that's the key brothers and sisters and I think it's just beautiful because this is just like a hand to glove it's just dovetailing together when we talk about our positions of the husband and the wife and the children and how the scriptures tell us how we should act we can act that way as the wife of Jesus Christ towards our husband and boy when we get into our position positionally placed in the word as the Bride of Jesus Christ what's going to happen is we're going to have a little bit more of a relationship that relationship is going to evolve into such a closeness that we're going to have an intimacy and you know what that means is that I believe it with all my heart there's probably people here that have experienced it as not just me I'm not someone who's super spiritual but I'll say it this way as we go we are going to be a super church we are going to be a super race and I would say we are now a super church we are now a super race and so it's not that foreign to say a little bit super spiritual brothers and sisters if we're not super spiritual then I think that we're missing the mark but you know people will say they're Fanatics when you start talking that way because really what it is is you're saying I and my father are one it's not two it's one you're having an intimate relationship with him and you know where we're going brothers and sisters is not to remain as the Bride of Jesus Christ we know that the word of God brother Toby said it you know on Sunday he said there's a scripture in Revelations that we need to Rejoice there's coming a time where we'll say we should rejoice and be very glad not just a little glad be very glad shout like the sons of God and recognize that the bride has made herself ready but not the bride it doesn't say bride in the word it says his wife hath made herself ready there's a change somewhere between there and where brother Branham said I no longer call you church I call you Brett there's an intimacy that comes together where the two become one where they start to actually discern each other's thoughts brother Bradham said you're going to have the mind of Christ in you and you'll know what to do with the word I would say that's pretty intimate I don't think it gets any more intimate than that don't don't think intimate in terms of a natural relation brothers and sisters although the nacho types the spiritual but we're talking about the most intimate relation ever and that is that when we have a thought we're going to have a husband that says all right I'll give it to you you didn't even say it I know you didn't say it nobody else heard you say it but somehow somewhere you're gonna have it delivered to you because I'm the one hearing your thoughts we know brother Branham said that our thoughts are louder in heaven than our voices here on Earth my goodness this word is moving it's a transition I think it's just so beautiful because we're moving into our position as the wife of Jesus Christ we're moving from bride into the wife position where it's the most intimate relation that there is where you know what we are able to have a new birth that's what comes out of it we just simply have a new birth we can't help it when we take that word into US brother Branham he said it you know I preached on it for a long time and we just say like Mary be it unto me according to Thy word that angel messenger bringing that word and we just say Amen to that word we have a new birth that happens inside of us and we know the angel messenger said that that birth that's going to happen isn't going to be you it's not going to be your child it's not going to be anyone other than Jesus Christ the power of the most high is what's going to overshadow you and that's what will bring this to to life and we know that at the salutation of the name Jesus in Elizabeth's ears when the Two Sisters got together to talk about what's going on how crazy things were getting in their lives the salutation of Jesus in Elizabeth's ears caused her baby John the Baptist to LEAP in her womb at the name of Jesus Christ how much more the Sons and Daughters of God today brothers and sisters I just can't help but think how wonderful that is as we're going forwards we're moving into our position and it's in one position it's not in two positions it's not in three positions it's not in various different positions and different angles around the message of the hour it's only one message and that one message is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and that one message is what's going to change our bodies no other message will change our bodies the only way we get there is just simply accept the word for our day but with this transition with this moving of the word we're transitioning it's it's a transition time things are moving very quickly all around us we've said it and and I just think it's so beautiful to see how incredible this transition anointing is on one hand we can look at the world around us and say this whole transitioning thing is horrible and it's terrible and and with the perversion of creation the way that God made it it is it's horrible and it's terrible and what makes it horrible and terrible I think probably the most horrible and terrible is that they're taking away the rights for parents to be able to have choice in their children's future when children don't have a developed enough mind to be able to make a solid decision the B system now has control where they're saying that children can make their own decision and it's not up to parents and if parents want to say anything against it they can actually get in trouble for it think about how far that's gone it's terrible in my opinion I think that's the worst because parents should be able to parent until they're done parenting until their children are ready to fly until they're ready to be adults according to the way parents want them to be but you know it's an anointing that's on this age and the whole entire world doesn't even recognize it we've talked about this in the past but I think it's important to just remember when we see the influence of this it's all over North America it's all over Europe it's all over the world everywhere we go there's nowhere that we can go where it's not affected and you know there's some countries you might say they've got laws and it's it's not allowed homosexuality is against the law and and maybe it's severely punished if you get caught and and you know what that's fine and good but there's still social media social media the internet has its tentacles everywhere in the world and I'll tell you that spirit is using that platform more than anywhere and and that's what's happening brothers and sisters that anointing is everywhere on the world it's come in like a flood the enemy has come in like a flood but you know what brothers and sisters the spirit of God will always raise a standard against it and you my brother my sister are that standard that God has chosen to raise up against that and you know what one day we're going to be shut down for talking this way but until that day we're going to say it we're going to say it clearly we're going to speak it you know what we we love the sinner but we hate the sin if you come against the word of God you're sinning yes but all creation is groaning for this all creation is groaning for it Romans chapter 8 you know the earnest expectation of the creature wadeth for what for the manifestation of the sons of God but you know what brothers and sisters take a look at how dark and gloomy it is out there how much change how much movement there is from from the way the forefathers fought I heard people in the U.S saying they were U.S citizens saying that my forefathers never fought for this country the way this country is right now they would never have fought and laid down their lives for this and to think about it the Canadian soldiers would be the same way to think that we're we're talking about trying to create an environment where men will be women and women will be men what on Earth is that that's a Sodom condition right there if we ever saw it and I would say this brothers and sisters it's never been this Sodom since before the days of Sodom and we know what happened then right but I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory oh my which shall be revealed in US because if we're children then we're heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together thinking about this suffering you know we're not going to be taken out and scourged you can talk to many different people and get many different answers according to the message of the hour for this some say there will be a severe persecution some say they'll be hunted down like dogs you can find quotes to support everything you want but excuse me to think about this that you know if Christ has a bride and she has already judged herself does she need to be judged does she need to be persecuted and hunted down like a dog is that really what's going to happen to the bride when the prophet of God preached the sermon there's going to be a secret sudden catching away of the Bride we're judging ourselves here and I would say as we judge ourselves here we suffer here we look at this world around us and we suffer we suffer with Christ because we know that he looks at his creation and he groans he looks at his creation and and cries to think that men would want to be women and women would want to be men and children won't even be given the choice they'll just be influenced by that spirit I would say that suffering with him but that's so that we may be also glorified together verse 16 here is really what I wanted to get to with uh you know Romans chapter 8 just bringing this in a little bit here and as my father glorified that you bear much fruit so that you be my disciples that's John 15 8. why is that we can try all we want brothers and sisters but the spirit itself the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God it's not something that we can manufacture the shape just has wool the dove he's just White and the reason for the both of those is they both have oil on the inside of them that just causes them to just be the way they are they don't have to go and have a bath the oil inside of them just cleans them it Bears witness the spirit on the inside Bears witness that we are the children of God and all of creation is groaning for the manifestation of us brothers and sisters when we look at the world and see how terribly dark it is and how maybe frustrating it is to see how it seems like Satan is getting such a victory in this world in this age it's only because it's the end of all time it's the change of everything brother Branham said it very clearly in the seventh seal the seventh seal is the end of all creation it's the end of all time it's the end of all prophecy it's the end of all things and that seventh seal is wide open before our wandering eyes we can see it and if you can't see it today I pray that you will be able to see the seventh seal all the way open because then it changes the Bible it's like brother Bradham said you should be able to see Jesus Christ from Genesis to revelation we should be able to see the seventh seal from Genesis to Revelation because really what is the seventh seal it's Christ Jesus the unveiling of the almighty God in our day my goodness you know we're not stuck beyond the spirit of bondage again to fear we talked about it on Wednesday and I just had it on my heart when we were down south thinking about it you know you hear stories and and you see the way people behave and and different situations and I I just can't help but but word it this way that you know if we're preaching do's and don'ts then then we're actually missing the the meat of the word we're missing the power of what the message of the hour truly is brothers and sisters if we've got to preach do's and don'ts then we're not getting people to Christ we're getting people to church and we're doing the same thing at that point under the guise of the message of the hour that Billy Graham did we're taking people to the Cross to say that Jesus was here and he he was crucified for our sins he died for us and he rose again and then someday he's coming back for us but the message of the hour takes us further than that brothers and sisters and shows us that he's actually come he's already come you know he's leading the church by Pillar of Fire and a cloud just like we read we're not giving back to the bondage of a spirit of of fear the bondage of fear to preach do's and don'ts and and have people live under that guy we want to get people to Jesus Christ to The Living Word for our day that's the only way we're going to have success brothers and sisters that's the only way we're going to truly see the Jesus of the Old Testament Jehovah of the Old Testament being Jesus of the new the Holy Ghost in you the only way we're going to see that is to get people G to Jesus Christ brother Bradham said it I I'm afraid that we're only getting people to church we're not getting people to Christ it can't be getting people to an association if we do that then we're just another denomination that we preach Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever when he the spirit of Truth come he will lead us and guide us into all truth and that's where it gets a bit scary where it gets a bit frightening for some people because we know that we've seen people who have actually misused the message of the hour people who have been raised up under Ministries in under the guise of the message of the hour you know we can see all kinds of different things out there but just bringing it down home who we've had ministers who have mistreated the Bride of Jesus Christ doesn't change the people it just changes the ministers I found some quotes about that that brother Branham talks about and and it's going to be woeful for those ministers that mistreat the Bride of Jesus Christ and sometimes it's not a physical abuse or even a mental abuse it's a spiritual abuse they take the Bride of Jesus Christ down the road they're not supposed to go but his Spirit beareth witness with our spirit and I'll just love that I just love that I had a pastor that when I first got saved in the message of the hour that's what he did I thought maybe he would preach do's and don'ts he would he would give us direct answers to maybe some certain questions and he would say you know what you've got to do the work for yourself you've got to see what God wants from it you can't come to me and expect me to give you an answer because then every time you're going to come to me and you're going to want me to give you an answer but it's got to be a relationship between you and him because his spirit will bearth witness in our lives and if we don't have his spirit it's sad but it's true brothers and sisters that Spirit beareth witness in our lives when we behave according to the word and when we misbehave according to the word you can't hide it it beareth witness what spirit is on the inside of us people can only act for a period of time but whatever's on the inside of them the more that they're under the anointed word the more that they're under the preached word of the hour the more that that happens the more they manifest whatever seed is inside of them because we know it's the word of God that fertilizes the sea Gene of God that's inside us from before the foundation of the world and we cannot hide Who We Are but when we are truly the Sons and Daughters of God when that word comes forward that that sea Gene just leaps in the womb it just jumps to life it says Amen to that word just like John the Baptist I just couldn't help but think about this word moving and how the bride is is moving into her place moving into her position and we've talked about this as families and and how God he has a bride that he has chosen from before the foundation of the world you know Satan was given the opportunity to go and take a bride out of the perfect garden out of the perfect condition and he did but now Satan has been given six thousand years to create his own garden to create his own environment and God said you know what don't doubt that I will take a bride of my own choosing out of your garden and when I come she will not refuse my word it's not that she's going to refuse my church or refuse my ministers or refuse any of that it's not going to be do's and don'ts it's going to be my word that she will not refuse and she will go right into her position the woman the church the feminine the bride the wife in her position you know brothers and sisters there's no more powerful position in the universe is there then the Bride of Jesus Christ no longer just the Bride of Jesus Christ but the wife of Jesus Christ we know that if you play chess besides the king there's only one other player that is more powerful than the king even more powerful than the king is that right and that's the queen she can do anything she wants to on that board and you know what that's he what he's done for us in our day if we can get into our position as his wife brothers and sisters I I believe it there's no telling what we could do on the board the chess board that God has we know that God is not afraid to actually take a wager right he did that with job Satan came and and and was doing his thing and God said to him hey have you ever considered my servant job knowing that job was a part of him before the foundation of the world but job didn't recognize it and we know through that whole trial that's where job was able to come to the realization of it excuse me I just think it's wonderful though if we can get into our position there's only one way that she can get in there brothers and sisters that's just to take him at his word can't believe I've gone this far and I haven't had a quote but here we go I got one brother Branham says like Israel back in her Promised Land she didn't know she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically put back there why National Force put her in her place brother Branham and this is in the message recognizing your day and its message he says now I'm going to say something National Force put Israel in her Homeland National Force will put the church in the world Council of churches we're not the church brothers and sisters that's changed 1963 that changed but the power of God will put the people in The Bride it's the power of God that's going to do that he says the world forces this way and the world forces that way but the but God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place isn't that beautiful we don't have to worry about trying to put ourselves in our place I think it's just magnificent when we look at this for me it just takes all the pressure off I don't have to try anything I just have to follow his word if I just follow his word he will put me in my position my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ we'll put her in her place no National Force will do it but the National Force did Drive Israel to the Homeland the national forces of the Council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it he says oh people recognize your day as Jesus warned you the sign of Sodom and the church's condition of this day just don't have to look very far do you Sodom condition is everywhere and isn't it wonderful to think that the condition that we live in maybe I shouldn't say it that way forgive me strike that from the record it's not wonderful to think about I was being sarcastic and I shouldn't be from here to think that it's not just one day out of the year that we recognize it it's not like it's Mother's Day or it's Father's Day or it's boss's day or it's employees day it's pride month we've got to do a month we have to do a big show it's got to be a big deal and that's the world that we live in and go and look at churches churches get lots of lots of action and lots of likes but the reason for it is they're actually pulling on the senses of people they're not actually preaching the word of God and most of it is the music they're pulling people in they've got a worship team I heard someone speaking about it recently they said they had smoke machines they've got lights they've got all of the the wonderful gifts that God has placed in people's lives but they're worshiping and you know they're worshiping in vain they really honestly believe they're worshiping God the terrible thing is they're worshiping the God of this evil age they don't recognize that if you've got cut hair and you're praying you're not praying to God that if you've got cut hair and you're wearing pants you're not actually worshiping God when you're singing it's terrible but that's the condition we live in we can recognize our day in its message we can recognize that the word of God is moving it can feel like you know what brother Barry we've heard this so many times from 1965 onwards we've been in the message for 40 years and we've heard it all and you know what it's just going to be that way that's what the word of God says wasn't it the same since the fathers fell asleep nothing has changed and one of these days brothers and sisters we're going to start to see our loved ones because they who who went before us are going to come and they're going to be saying to us take take notice take notice all that you ever believed is actually at hand right now you don't have to look any further you can just rest we said this a little while ago and I think it's just such a beautiful thing imagine if you were just getting ready one night to go to bed or getting ready one morning getting out of bed and you had an angel of God come to you and say to you just an angel of Light that fit the full description manifestation of the word of God and said to you you don't have to worry brother Henry you actually made it everything that you've ever dreamed about even though you have faults and failures in your flesh you don't have to worry about it at all because you're already seated in Heavenly places brother just keep doing what you're doing don't worry about trying to change and be a different person brothers and sisters we've had that delivered to us in our age the prophet of God God speaking through the prophet of God saying that you are the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ that he has taken for his own choosing you don't have to do something different you don't have to try and be someone that you're not just be yourself just keep doing what you're doing just keep pressing toward that prize remember when brother Brown went across there beyond the curtain of time what that voice said to him when he had to come back he said no no I don't want to go back and he said the remaining thought that he had was that voice saying just keep pressing on don't give up brothers and sisters this is no time to give up faith I'm preaching to myself here maybe I'm getting a little excited brother Barry take a breath I I'm preaching to myself here I think about the many times that I fall and that I fail and that I have misery in my own life and think that how could I ever go on how could I ever go and stand behind a sacred desk and actually speak to his bride but you know what that voice just says get back up just get up you're either down or you're getting up but you're never going to stay in that position you're never going to be down we just have to keep pressing on brothers and sisters and have Grace one for another recognizing that we're all Sinners saved by grace and you know what's beautiful because that's the way he chose to do it and if we have any questions oh my brother Daryl took a text down there it was so good man he talked about how Rahab she's always referred to as the Harlot right she never had just Rahab the woman Rahab the redeemed Rahab anything else it's Rahab the Harlot she was a harlot and the word of God says so but you know what rahab's life was her sermon Rahab all she had to do was accept that messenger's words and she actually knew it in her heart as a harlot that's when the word came to her brothers and sisters not when she was Polished in the church she wasn't already in the congregation of Israel she was a harlot and you know what just because she accepted the word when it came she and her whole family was saved you want to save your whole family just take the word the way that it was delivered to us just accept it the way that God gave it to us and apply that token say give me a true token and watch and see if he won't do it her life was her sermon she didn't have to preach her life being a harlot was her sermon that she was a sinner saved by grace and you know what's fascinating with this brothers and sisters is this is the lineage of Christ he didn't come through any other lineage he came down through Rahab the Harlot because he needed to demonstrate he was taking sinful flesh tempting like manners in every single point so that he could take it all of the sin through all of the ages all the faults and failures and nailed them to his cross so that some people could say amen I accept that he paid it all I don't have to do anything but that's what happens when we get into do's and don'ts we're trying to take sins and nail them to his cross we're trying to take sacrifices and try and apply them and and you know what the word of God says that he went and paid the price he went and strove for sin he went a strove against blood he actually went to the cross and he nailed sin to the Cross once and for all and went to be at the right hand of the father and is set down on his throne and you know what that means to be set down that means full Authority just like the queen on the chessboard you know brothers and sisters here now we're starting to get into our text and we have like 17 minutes left looking at this scripture John 15 verse 8 herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples you aren't going to be his disciple unless you're bearing fruit brothers and sister and the only fruit that you want to bear in my opinion my view is the spirit of Christ that's all and he will bring forth the fruit in your life all you have to do is trust him and he will bring the fruit in your life here's another quote brother Bradham talking about the fruit of the spirit he says what is the fruit of the spirit many times I thought the fruit of the spirit is maybe you know like we would see what the fruits of the spirit are excuse me in terms of the scriptures and we'll get into that but here we have brother Bradham saying something just so radical no wonder he he shook the foundations of Christendom of of all of the associations of all of the the the the many membered Christian people in this world how he says this what is the Fruit of the Spirit the manifestation of the promised word it sounds like such a simple statement doesn't it I said it that way just to lead us on a little bit what is the fruit of the spirit the manifestation of the promised word that's all it is if they'd just stopped to look he did not have these things that they had fruit of the spirit or anything but the word that was promised that day was manifesting himself that was exactly the light of the hour that was it see no matter how much education how kind how much you speak with tongues how much kind gentle and everything you are unless you accept that word of the hour when it's manifested before you when it's manifested before you you're in the same predicament it sounds like such a simple thing brothers and sisters I hope we can just dwell on this let it saturate just think about it doesn't matter what we do what kind of service we have how polished we remain maybe how long we've been around the message it doesn't matter about any of that unless we accept that manifested word when it's presented we're going to miss it we're going to be in that same predicament brother Brandon says that might sound crude I don't mean it that way but it's the truth just just believe it see all right now God forgive me you see what I mean who had the fruit of the spirit Jesus he said search the scriptures you think in them you have eternal life but they are they to testify of me they tell you who I am he never did come out and say who he was though did he isn't that beautiful Jesus never one time said thus saith the Lord did he why didn't he because he was the Lord he didn't have to say thus saith the Lord he wasn't just a prophet he wasn't any prophet he was the prophet they tell you who I am he never did come out and say who he was he didn't tell them and he and he got this great congregation he said unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood who's the son of man unless you do that you have no life in you we know that everybody said oh he's a vampire he's crazy he's mad we need to leave him alone and get out of here but it was by revelation maybe people didn't understand exactly what it was but something on the inside of the inside said hey Amen to that word I don't understand it but I accept it all of it the way that he has brought it so just just to be clear to clarify the fruit of the spirit Galatians 5 the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness and goodness and Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and you know we just heard brother Bradham say it doesn't matter how much of that you have how much of that you have unless you receive the fullness of the word for your day when it's presented to you then you'll be in the same predicament as those people Ephesians chapter 5 says for ye were sometimes Darkness not just in darkness but you were Darkness you were sometimes Darkness but now ye are light in the Lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and Truth proving that what is acceptable unto the Lord when he the spirit of truth comes he will lead us and guide us into all truth and what will happen then brothers and sisters then will begin to bear fruit we'll begin to bear fruit what we'll do is we won't bear fruit maybe in terms of just being a good polished person people will come and stomp on your toes remember brother Bradham says that you can act all you want but when the pressure comes that's when we start to show who we really are when things start to get a little bit crazy when things start to maybe not go our way when things start to get topsy-turvy that's when you start to see who people really are the true inner man comes out when things start to get a little bit crazy when the pressure's on but you know what's going to happen is maybe brothers and sisters you'll be the same person in every single point of your life but when the pressure comes in your life suddenly you'll behave differently suddenly there will be a new person living there it might be as subtle as that and that's where brother Branham says the Holy Ghost is without sensation there's no lightning bolt experience where you can say wow I got it now and you know when people say that you probably want to just take a step back and say well wait a second you know let's have a conversation about it um but there's no sensation about it at all it's our lives we bear fruit and the fruit that we bear brothers and sisters is the manifestation of the word for our day and that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost and that's the only evidence of the Holy Ghost it's not saying that I've got good deeds and actions and behaviors and thoughts and and and and and I give and and whatever it's not our actions at all it's our ability to receive the word and not just our ability to receive the word it's our ability to actually be purged as the branch because he is the true vine the only true vine and when we live in our position as the queen as the Bride As the wife he will Purge that branch and we will bring forth fruit I I just think it's beautiful when you think about that too because you know in the anointed once at the end time brother Branham talks about how there's a rain that's going to fall and when that rain falls everyone rejoices the weeds and the wheat and you don't know who is who in the zoo we just don't know that it's not up to us to know that we can say by discernment well someone's not behaving according to the word of God okay but I I don't know I'm not interested in being a quick draw a gunslinger for people to say that they're in or out that's not up to me that's up to him the only thing I want to do is just continue to preach the word preach the truth in season and see God take action based on that word that's the only thing that he's obligated to our opinions don't count my opinion doesn't count if I ever offer my opinion I apologize it's not worth anything you know looking at this this this whole idea of the moving the word moving in our day and and seeing how it's changed positions what it is we've said it a little bit earlier it's the unveiling or the revealing and that happens by faith and we know that faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen and faith is a revelation the Rapture to the believer is a revelation it's not something that we can put on we can't just say that I'm going to go out and buy myself some Faith where the random talks about it he says you're gonna can't just go down to the corner store and buy yourself some Joy I think it'd be awesome if we could I would have a an abundance of Joy on hand in my own life in my maybe in my glove box in my vehicle just so I had it there but you can't do that that's not the way it works the joy that we're after is the the strength of the Lord the joy of the Lord is our strength but faith is the evidence of things hoped for the the the evidence of things not seen you know we're talking about living in a day where we're going to see a Rapture a body change happen and uh you know that faith when we live it out in our lives is what will come forward when the father is glorified as we bear much fruit we're going to have faith and we're not just going to have faith to say that I can move a mountain or I can lift a car by my thoughts or I can just have something that I desire set an attention for it it's not that at all brother Branham says it's common faith that moves the hand of God just like hisp that applied the blood for the children of Israel the Passover in Egypt and you know our works is our faith expressed and every one of us is at a different level of our walk where we're going to Bear forth fruit nobody is exempt from it we're all on a journey and we're all getting acquainted one another with the Lord with the word in our lives and we need to just be careful to offer the grace that we need for one another so that we can all make that spiritual journey so that we can all make that that that relationship happen we've got to be willing to make room for one another but you know our works as Faith expressed brother Bradham says that their husband and wife they're not just you know your works and your faith are kind of separated they're not our Behavior or our works is our faith expressed our Behavior expressed and you know the word of God says that we're supposed to Bear forth much fruit when we do bear forth much fruit then our father is glorified he is glorified through us and the fruit that we bear and the fruit that we bear had better line up with his word and if it doesn't you know we can set it earlier we just need to get back up we don't need to stay down and wallow in it but we need to continually keep pressing on that's what brother Branham said just keep pressing on as the believer of the word for our day just keep pressing on we know that healing is a revelation God's word says it and all we have to do is believe it we we we I I think myself I can just talk about myself I I have thought that there's something that I need to do to see healing and you know what there's no specific prayer there is the prayer of faith that we need to pray but you know the the word of God is true and that's all there is to it and we just need to say beat unto me according to Thy word and and you know we don't need to take a thought for what should be said what needs to happen we can just see the Lord move on the scene all we have to do is believe it you know where we're at today brothers and sisters is Rapture Rapture is a revelation and you know it's it's only going to happen in God's time it's only going to happen God's way it's only going to happen according to God's word that's all the only thing is we can recognize that it's the season this is the season of rapture this is the season of body change and you know what's going to happen brother banham says it's going to take more faith than any other age he says and I want you to get built up now in in this holy Oracles of God in a faith the faith of this hour not the faith of another hour the faith of this hour the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing Faith to be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard word that you have heard preached the signs wonders you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether if that be of God or not and you know looking at the message of the hour brothers and sisters I don't think it can be said any clearer than that take a look at the first and second polls of his ministry and the third poll is where they'll say well he went off on his Doctrine well what Doctrine did he go off on because he didn't follow the School of Theology Jesus never followed a School of Theology when he was here on Earth did any of his prophets follow a School of Theology when they were here on Earth none of them did so why would it be any different today take a look at the man of God who had a Healing Ministry a campaign that had many people impersonated and rise up afterwards and begin to activate that Faith but then as soon as the word started to come forward I and my father are one my goodness that was at a spiritual food and due season says the new birth Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth that's it there's a whole bunch more there I'm not going to read right now brother Branham he talks about that sort of Crisis the mystery of God revealed the new birth is Christ the new birth is not just Christ that died at Calvary and actually rose again and then is coming soon that's not the new birth brothers and sisters that was for a day but when that word came forth out of the Vindicated Prophet to say I no longer call you church I call you bride I personally my view which isn't worth much I believe that that's where that changed that was a pivotal moment where the Prophet said we're building a house now we're turning a corner and unless you're following the blueprint you're going to miss the turn you're going to keep building the wall you're going to be miles down this wall and recognize that people are over there way down there I thought it was interesting looking at the Matthew effect it's it's an interesting thought because you know what it boils down to one example they use in Wikipedia is that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and that's what's going to happen brothers and sisters what's happening right now in our day the the spiritually Rich are getting richer and the spiritually poor getting poorer they're they're actually digressing they're going in different directions now and there's not much that we can do about it but he said he'd pour His Spirit out upon All Flesh and the flesh that is his spirit that is his his Gene his kin folk they're the ones that are going to actually rise up they're the one that are going to get more spiritually rich but those other ones they're going to get more and more spiritually poor they're going to maybe Prosper they'll have lots of money in their bank account they'll have good jobs and careers maybe great positions in the city we know that lot who was a penny in God's economy he became the mayor of Sodom we could have a really good position but that don't mean nothing that don't mean nothing where are we spiritually that's what counts we're going to take faith we need faith more faith than we've ever had out of any other age that's such a profound thought about him says this here he says now look I've said some pretty rough things about airplane automobile remember they are horsepower too all of it is horsepower the church is just moving up holy ghost power is the holy ghost that we're justified by it's not something that we do on our own he says you ministers know that don't you the Holy Ghost sanctifies us the Holy Ghost fills us the Holy Ghost gives us rapturing faith that's why brothers and sisters you hear me talk about it all the time and you will until this gets changed so the program shifts however God sees it fit I'm gonna say it we've got to get the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives unless we get that we're not going to see the rapture he says we're moving up that was out of countdown I'm sorry Ed really got inspired I have a lot of notes and we have a couple minutes left here we okay I'll try not to keep us late I have a birthday party for my mom she turned 80 yesterday happy birthday Mom if you're watching you know in Isaiah 61 my yeah hold Isaiah 61. the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound this speaks of getting people to Calvary it doesn't speak to the Bride of Jesus Christ and you know it's verse two verse 2 is where we actually fall in verse two to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn and we know that this scripture is what Jesus went and sat down in the temple one day and he said to them he only read the first half of this though verse 2 to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he sat down and he looked at them and they had their eyes fastened on him and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes and they had no idea what he talked about and in 1965 if you listen to the message birth pains brother Branham he actually encountered a situation where he was given a new Bible and in this Bible the page is stuck together and he had an issue trying to find the scripture that he was after and and we know that in this message what happened was a priest with all his robes and gowns on was sitting there on the platform he said Hold Steady God is fixing to move take my Bible and read from my Bible and we know that this is exactly what happened when Jesus went into the temple and the priest delivered the Bible unto him the Scrolls that he might read from it to them they wanted to hear what he had to say and the same thing happened in our day in our generation a priest handed the Bible to the prophet and the prophet said to them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears he says at 6 15 times in this message this day the scripture is fulfilled I've got some quotes from it I'm just going to go for it and we'll try and wrap it up quick here brother Bradham says how could he stand her that day and say this day this scripture is fulfilled right before your eyes how outstanding how so plainly and yet those people misunderstood he says why it's because they took the interpretation of some order of priests that they were listening to I want to say it this way brothers and sisters if we're not careful we can do that with the word of God for our day and we will not bear forth the fruit that is going to glorify our heavenly father if we do that paragraph 87 the word had said that he would come just the way he come and there he stood reading the word and saying to them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes and still they failed to see him or recognize him like they did in all other ages 118 and about that time the Holy Ghost fell on his sister setting out there in the meeting and she raised up speaking in unknown tongues and gave the interpretation of the very thing that the priest and I were talking about on the platform the whole church the whole place went into a roar he says carried on over into Oral Roberts convention last week or a week before last and was the talk of the convention I just think it's beautiful to say that to recognize that because people would say well look at Oral Roberts and and Billy Graham and how they set the stage and how they did everything and and William Branham he was just a little Pebble on the beach actually they were following his lead that's what happened here they were following the prophet for our day he says how did the priest setting under the Holy Spirit revealed out there through a woman his sister I believe it was of that I was taking place up there on the platform and revealed that thing that we were hiding the hour that we're living this day this scripture is fulfilled this day the evening lights have come and we fail to see it notice 154 when I was baptizing my 17th person under this witness and you know the rest of the story and when I was standing there baptizing the 17th person a light come down from heaven shining down above there like a star falling from the heaven a voice said as John the Baptist was sent to forer on the first coming of Christ your message shall forerun the second coming into all the world it's beautiful to think that this is what the prophet of God was saying I just have to read this little last little bit again as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message shall forerun his second coming into all the world this is what the prophet of God says this day this scripture is fulfilled John the Baptist the Forerunner we know that it's Elijah the anointing I'll call the musicians or I won't stop 165 and he said the Seven Seals of the Hidden Mysteries of the entire Bible will be opened and fulfill Revelations 10. that in the seventh Angel's message these things should come to pass this day this scripture before our eyes is this day this scripture is fulfilled he says I don't know how you can actually come up with maybe six seals being open and not the seventh when you have the progressive revelation like he taught 1965 here he is saying the Seven Seals of the Hidden Mysteries of the entire Bible will be opened and this day this scripture is fulfilled 170 the prophet said there will come a day that Shall be Called neither day or night a dismal day a lot of rain and fog just enough to know how to join church or put your name on a book but it shall be light about the evening time this day this scripture is fulfilled and what brings it day brothers and sisters is the word the word manifested in our day people say an amen to the word people living that word people pressing on people having the desire to come out and actually put their shoulder to the wheel to say Amen to the word because as you eat the book you become the book 237 is there a man on Earth has got repentance so preached so plainly as Billy Graham maybe stand with me as we close has there been a man that has had an effect on the people like Billy Graham never has there been internationally a man Oh Billy Sunday and so forth was here in the United States but Billy Graham is known all over the world worldwide see where he's calling out of Sodom and he's got his accompanying party there with the Pentecostal church and Oral Roberts but what about the elect group this is where it gets good what kind of a sign are they supposed to see what are they supposed to have Hallelujah it shall be light in the evening time this day this scripture is fulfilled this day God's promise is fulfilled we know that to be the truth he is here tonight as he was then 240 now to preach it that I said a while ago if you preach anything and it's the gospel truth then God is obligated to vindicate that it's is that true now if that be so let God let the god that wrote the word let the god that made the prophecy let the God who is the god of the world come forth and prove that he is still God and here we are brothers and sisters this many years down the road we had the prophet standing and declaring this day this scripture is fulfilled and it's the same for us now we have the ability to accept the entire word for our day and all we have to do is say Amen to it not try and Hyper analyze it not try and make it say something it doesn't just simply eat the word eat the book the way that he's given it to us and it shall be light in the evening time and that light brothers and sisters is truly his word his life living out through you and that is how the father is glorified by you being the manifested word for our day let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness Lord thank you for your word your Vindicated word Lord thank you that we have the ability to recognize it Lord Jesus father that there's not some great fantastic there's not some fanatical rather there's just you and we know that you are your word and and so many people are looking for some kind of a physical manifestation but they're they're looking earnestly Lord for you and they're looking for something different than what they should be looking for because they don't recognize the scriptures the scriptures say that there will be a coming of the Lord but it will be a word coming it will be the bride coming of the Lord is what your Prophet taught and father we are standing here to declare that we accept that word the way that you've given it father and Lord we just say be it unto us according to your word so that we can be that light so that we can be the light to this Dying World father Lord I pray that you would just bless the words that were spoken that you would just keep your hand upon us as we go our separate ways father that you would just help us Lord to recognize our position in you and father if there's someone that we could Minister through the testimony that we have in our lives Lord knowing that rahab's testimony was her life father we all have a testimony sometimes we don't have to be a preacher we can just go and and tell how it got lit and father see people's lives get changed Lord we just asked that you would give us the ability to evangelize in this end time father each one of us Lord that everyone around us would know truly what we believe truly Who We Believe father we love you we thank you we ask all these
