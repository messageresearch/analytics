your spirit saith unto the church Lord even tonight father we just Commit This service now into your hands hands for your glory Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles tonight I just want to continue on in our study of the exposition of the seven Church ages book um just wanted to uh while you're turning over to Revelations CH 3 verse 14 I just wanted to remind everyone that we had put it out there a little while ago and I should have done it much sooner but you know it's got to be a revelation I guess and that's the way things are it's my first time going through as a congregation study with this book and you know if there's anybody that has questions about this book there there they've got to be spiritual questions that means there has to be a spiritual answer for them so I just wanted to remind us that we are certainly open to questions and answers for this so if you have a question question by all means reach out or just write it down and drop it in the offering or put it in the box at the back however is convenient for you we certainly would love to uh engage in the questions and answers over in Revelations chapter 3 verse 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the leod Deans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and Mis miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we're so thankful for your word thank you that we can read it in freedom of speech Lord and father we just pray that Lord you would rebuke us and you would chasen us Lord father that we would be your children that we would demonstrate that we can receive correction that we can learn Lord that we can grow and that we can bring glory to your name amen by obedience to your word father we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated is that brother Dave hakak there God bless you brother and family you know what really odd is before the service I had Brother David on my heart it sounds weird but it's true it's so uh so wonderful to see you brother carrying on in our uh our study of the exposition of the seven Church ages um sorry before that get ahead of myself here got some announcements we got the prayer meeting tomorrow night at uh 7:30 p.m. here at the church we have uh Men's breakfast on the 15th with brother Cadre and I've sent that information out on the men's chat we have uh Saturday evening service at 6: p.m. then we have the Sunday service service at 10:00 a.m. regular time and we will have the youth uh service the youth gathering at our house after the service on Sunday and then on the 26th we will have the annual General men's meeting so we'll cancel the Wednesday service and we'll have that in the basement here and then uh we just wanted to mention also that September 12th 13th and 14th we will have services with brother Andrew Glover and uh I trust that everyone is warm tonight tonight it's certainly miserable weather out there but we're certainly thankful that we can be inside where it's warm and safe carrying on in our our study of this book you know the uh where we left off I'll just pick up there brother Bram he it's in the leoan church age he says yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece and it's just amazing if you look around found um at different denominations and different beliefs true words have never been spoken there's so many different versions of What Christianity is he goes on to say so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride and that is a powerful statement amen he will confound them through the prophet they'll reject the prophet that God could send a prophet to this age not just that brothers and sisters this is where it gets down to the the brass tax as it were the bride the bride will confound them for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come isn't that beautiful in harmony they will say the same thing just like parents when the children go and ask Mama mama can I do this she says no they run to Daddy Daddy can I do this they don't even have to talk as parents but they just say the same thing there's something about them when they're in unity once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age now he has cried out to this last AG you have the word you have more Bibles than ever and can you imagine what brother brandham would have said here if he would have known the power of these you have computers you have the internet right you have the table with every single recorded message every single printed word you have all of it my you have more Bibles than ever but you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want and this is where it gets interesting you can get into that study that we talked about a while ago that got passed around about the different versions of the Bible you just get into the New World Translation and whole verses are taken out of that Bible yes the the the the NIV is Twisted some of the verses aren't even they're missing words like and and you could say hey I believe this Bible I believe every single word of it but is it the inspired word that was given and I mean it just goes back to what we talked about earlier here where he says that the they'll just reject the prophet as soon as you reject the prophet then you have the open door for anything else it becomes a freef fall you can take any any version of the Bible and say sure I could use that version of the Bible and still be saved sure enough maybe you could but can you actually be in the Rapture as the Bride of Jesus Christ by rejecting anything that the prophet said I don't know I personally would say that's pretty Shaky Ground you're going out on a limb there but anyways brother bradam I'm just going to read this again now he has cried to out to this last age you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want you are not interested in living it but debating it I would sooner you were cold or hot if you were cold and rejected it I could stand that if you would get white hot to know its truth and live it I would praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it I in return turn must refuse to honor you my I will spew you out for you nauseate me who would want to nauseate God Almighty wow now anybody knows that it is lukewarm water that makes you sick at the stomach if you need an emedic lukewarm water is about the best thing to drink a lukewarm church has made God sick and he has declared he will spew it out reminds us how he felt just before the flood doesn't it oh would to God the church were cold or hot best of all she should be fervent hot but she is not sentence has been passed she is no longer God's voice to the world she will maintain that she is but God says not I remember when I first started coming around I heard brother Ken Boer preach and and he talked about this that it would be better that you were either cold all the way or hot because of what the word says I couldn't believe it when I heard that and actually caught a bit of a revelation about that God would prefer that we were actually one or the other but because we're lukewarm my I say Lord don't let us get lukewarm oh God God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride amen that voice is in the Bride As we have said and we will talk more about that later that's exciting news I'm excited to get there now the second he says because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold Tri in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rayment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see isn't it beautiful in Revelations 3:17 to18 that he not only just pronounces the the the symptoms but he pronounces The Cure he gives you the Cure and and there's no way that cure will actually work outside of like we speak about on Sunday spiritual revelation Revelation by the spirit it's going to take Revelation by the spirit to actually understand what those verses mean amen going on he says now look at the first phrase of this verse because thou sayest see they were speaking they were talking as the mouthpiece of God the this proves exactly what I said verses 16117 meant but though they say it that does not make it right and we know that's the propaganda machine just continually say it just keep saying it and eventually everyone will just buy into it if you just keep saying it that's what the media Outlets do just keep saying the same thing it doesn't matter whether it's true or false just keep saying it the more you say it the more they hear it the more they'll like it that's exactly what the radios do with music a new song gets released and they pay big money to get it on the radio stations and they just keep playing and playing and playing and many times I know when I was in the world I'd hear a song and I'd think man that's a weird song I don't really dig that song but then after a month or so I'd be like oh yeah that's that song and before long I'd be you know moving with that song initially my reaction was I don't like it but that's just human nature Satan knows exactly how to get through but though they say it that does not make it right just because everyone's saying it doesn't mean it's right the Catholic Church says she speaks for God saying she is the assured voice of the Lord but how many people can be so spiritually Wicked is more than I know but they produce according to the seed which is in them and we know where that seed came from don't we o burn the leod dean church is saying I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing that was her self-estimate she looked at herself and that was what she saw she said I am rich which means that she is wealthy in the things of this world she is boasting in the face of James chapter 2 verses 5 to7 hearken my beloved Brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and HS of the Kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him but ye have despised the poor do not the rich do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judge judgement seats do not they blaspheme that worthy Name by the which you are called now I do not suggest that a rich person cannot be spiritual but we all know what the world says very few are it is the poor that predominate in the body of the true church now then if the church becomes full of wealth we know only one thing thing this is hard kabad and remember that word means the spirit of the Lord has departed kabod and I I think it's important I'm going to put this in here as well brothers and sisters there's nothing wrong with having wealth but seek ye first the kingdom of God he will bless us we know many people in the Bible that we're very blessed but we also know many people today that say I just don't want to get a job so I'm going to say I'm going to be spiritual and I'm going to be the person that brother Bram is talking about here and I don't have to work because God's going to bless me the children of Israel had to get out of bed in the morning they had to get out of bed and go to work and so long as they were willing to do that God did the work for them amen but if we're not willing to get out of bed and go to work God can't bless us brothers and sisters and we know it's not about blessing and having all of the spiritual wealth we're not we're not talking about that I'm saying that brother bradam says that it's razor thin it's razor thin it's a paradox we've got to live in this world but not be of this world we have to provide for our families so anyway I do not suggest that a rich person cannot be spiritual but we all know that the word says that very few are it's the poor that predominate in the body of the true church now then if the the church becomes full of wealth we know only one thing kabad has been written over her portals you can't deny that for that is the word talk about wealth in the church why there never has been such a show of wealth the beautiful sanctuaries that are multiplied in number as never before the various groups Vie with each other to see who can build the biggest and the loveliest and they build Education Centers worth unestimated millions and those buildings are used only an hour or two a week now that would not be such a terrible thing but they expect this little time spent by the children in the education plant to take the place of the hours of training supposed to be given in the home I thought he was going to say as I was reading this originally in the church but it's not brothers and sisters judgment starts at the house of the Lord right but we are supposed to train up a child in the way they should go and then they won't depart from it he goes on to say money has poured into the church until different denominations own stocks and bonds factories oil wells insurance companies they they have poured money into welfare and retirement funds now this sounds good but it has become a snare to the ministers for if they decide to leave their group for more light or the love of God their pensions are lost to them but you know I can tell you for sure there would be no greater blessing to one of those men to be able to walk away from that to say you know what forsaking all I take Christ amen to be able to do that would be the greatest blessing ever and there's no doubt that God would bless that person I'd have no doubt about that that's right but it's fear that grips us fear grips us when we want to be able to provide for our families brother BR goes on to say most can't stand this and stay with their pressure groups now don't forget that this is the last age we know that this is the last age because Israel has gone back to Palestine if we believe that he really is coming then there must be something wrong with those people who are building so vastly it makes one think that these people plan on staying here forever or that the coming of Jesus is hundreds of years off and who knows it could be we don't know that we're supposed to just continue on working the way that we do and paying our bills and getting paid and loving our families and going to church putting our shoulders to the wheel we're supposed to just be good Christians right that's what the prophet said good Christian people don't be Fanatics one way or the other just continue on he he he could come tomorrow he could come in a hundred years from now but you know the devil likes to get in the details and say well you know there some people that believe that you know you got to go through the tribulation some are are post-tribulation and some are pre-tribulation and some are midt people I I trust that none of the Believers of this message are anything but pre-trib Believers because the one that's already judged doesn't need to be judged we don't need to judge our wives once we marry them we marry our wives and then we love our wives and the the the the weddings here on Earth are just a natural type of what actually happen spiritually so beautiful he goes on to say do you know that Religion Today is known as Big Business it is an absolute fact fact that they are placing business managers in the churches to take care of the finances this is what is this what God desires did not his word teach us in the book of Acts that seven Men full of the Holy Ghost and Faith serve the Lord in business matters you can surely see why God said you must you say you are wealthy I never said so there are radio programs television programs and I can tell you from my experience seeing the television programs I've said it many times see a tell evangelist calling for money begging for money send us money then God will bless you it's terrible but it's it's true it's very much real and the numerous Church Endeavors that are costing millions and millions of dollars wealth Pours and pours into the church that membership increases along with the money yet the work is not being done as it was done when there was no money but men rested solely on the ability given to them by the Holy Ghost there are paid preachers paid assistants paid Ministers of music and education paid choirs paid custodians programs and entertainment all costing great sums but for all that the power is decreasing we know brother bradam says that people in the last days will trade power for programs yes the church is Rich but the power is not there God moves by his Spirit not by the amount of money or talent in the church that's why I think it's so beautiful we can't allow politics to dictate how the church is going to be run as soon as we do that we start to fall slip into this category here he goes on to say now now I want to show you how diabolical this urge for money has become my the churches have gone all out to get a membership especially of the wealthy everywhere there is the cry to make religion so attractive and appealing that the rich and cultured and all who have worldly Prestige will come in and be active in the church can't they understand that if wealth is the Criterion of spirituality then the world already has God has all of God and the church has nothing what a comparison such a simple comparison but powerful thou sayest I am increased with Goods this literally means I have spiritual riches this sounds like the Millennium with streets of gold and the presence of God but I wonder if this is so is the church truly rich in the spiritual things of God let us examine this 20th century leod and boast in the light of the word if the church were truly spiritually Rich its influence would be felt upon community life but exactly what kind of lives are these so-called spiritual and influential men of the community living out in Suburbia out in the better class districts there abounds wife swapping prostitution and bands of children crashing parties exactly a terrible toll in property damage immorality has reached an all-time high in promiscuous sex acts narcotic addiction gambling stealing and all kinds of evil isn't it bizarre that he would be talking about all of those things in the same paragraph he's talking about the church why I mean even coming from the world I never would have thought all of that would be lumped together to me that's shocking and the church goes on claiming how fine this generation how fine is this generation how full are the churches and how responsive are even the natives on the mission fields they get results the church has turned the people over to the doctors especially the psychiatrists how can it Pratt about being rich spiritually is more than I know it isn't true they are bankrupt and don't know it you know brother bradam uses this this dialogue a little bit in here as he goes forward they are bankrupt and don't know it I had never thought of it that way I heard actually brother brother Eugene Braun talk about this the first time I ever heard it and uh you know if we're not willing to make investments spiritually we can't go and withdraw spiritually we can try but our bank account spiritually is going to be empty if we have a marriage and we don't invest in our marriage we can't expect to see returns coming out of our marriage if we don't have a relationship and the same thing with our children if we're not willing to invest in our children we're not going to see that return come out of our family the way that we think we should we need to make sure that we have the right investment and spiritually speaking this is powerful we don't want to be spiritually bankrupt he goes on to say take a good look around you examine the people as they walk by in the multitudes you see can you pick out those that have the appearance of Christians watch how they dress watch how they act hear what they say and see where they go every once in a while you find people and you can say that must be a type of a Christian right there and usually it's the women isn't it because they're displaying Holiness they have long hair you can see they have long hair and they have long garments they're wearing dresses it's different watch how they dress watch how they act hear what they see and see where they go surely there ought to be some real evidence of the new birth amongst all those we see go by but few there be today the fundamental churches are telling us they have millions saved and even spirit filled spirit filled can you call woman spirit filled who go around with frizzy bobbed hair shorts and slacks halters and briefs all painted up like Jezebel if these are adorned in modest appar apparel as becometh Christian woman I would hate to think what it would be like if I had to witness a display of immodesty wow now I know that the women don't set the Styles Hollywood does that but listen ladies they still sell Yard Goods and sewing machines you don't have to buy what's in the stores and then use that as an excuse exuse this is a deadly serious matter that I'm going into have you not read in Scripture that when a man looks on a woman and lust after her in his heart he has already committed adultery with her in his heart and suppose you dressed in such a way as to cause that that makes you his partner in sin even though you would be absolutely unaware of it being a true virgin with no such desires yet god holds you accountable and you will be judged that is powerful it's amazing because you know I I just I'm going to say it we preached on this a little while ago we should be able to come to church and not have to have fear of encountering something that's going to draw a man's eye the red-blooded male has been created thus to have the desire to look and it behooves the sisters to heed the words written right here to make sure that we're dressing appropriately to not Garner something like that to happen but you know it's not the women necessarily in total the men have responsibility as well and I just want to say this Brothers Brothers specifically and sisters because they're listening you know if God will hold the sister this accountable how accountable will the men be held he's not just going to take the sisters and and throw them into the fire he's got equal judgment he's a just God if the woman is going to be judged that hard or or that straight then I would say for sure the men will be also so we need to know where we stand I think this is so good to hear it we need to know it's it's like we spoke about on Sunday about you know we can have a a a a perceived expectation without ever communicating it a and maybe we start to get upset or get mad because maybe something isn't happening the way that we think that it should sometimes we see that in families we see it in marriages we can see it in work relationships we can see it in friend relationships we can see it in in church uh Church existence we can see it all over the place but the thing is we need to communicate and isn't it wonderful that we serve a just God that would actually make sure this point specifically so specifically is communicated to us in the age in which we live it's so incredibly important my brother Bram he goes on to say now I know you ladies don't like this kind of preaching but sister you were dead wrong in what you were doing if your hair is cut you're wearing makeup you're wearing shorts you're you know you're you're fitting the bill of what he described there he says the Bible forbids you to cut your hair God gave it for a covering he gave a command for you to wear it long it's your glory when you cut your hair you signified that you left the headship of your husband like Eve you walked out and went on your own you got the vote you took men's jobs you left off being female you ought to repent and come back to God and this is so opposite of this world my and if all this wasn't bad enough a whole lot of you took the idea that you could invade the pulpits and the church offices that God reserved for men and for men only now remember we said this a little bit earlier just because everyone's saying it just because everyone's doing it doesn't mean it's right it's correct according to the word of God right and the more we see it it doesn't mean that it's right Oh my he says oh I touched a sore spot then didn't I well show me one place in the Bible that God ever ordained a woman to preach or take authority over a man and I will apologize for what I have said you can't find that I'm wrong I'm right for I stand with the word and in the word if you were spiritually Rich you would know that's true there's nothing true but the word Paul said in 1 Timothy 2:12 I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man now I know you can go a little bit further and that's where the churches take it and they say that well they're supposed to communicate and and it gets slippery and they take the scripture and they they bend it to to suit their their ideologies but just because everyone is saying it it doesn't matter Paul said it and that's what we believe and I think that's so beautiful there has to be a benchmark and we know that at the beginning of this book Paul was the first age messenger he set the pattern for every every Church age coming after amen he goes on to say you can't possibly take a place amongst the five-fold ministry of Ephesians 4 and not take authority over men sister you had better listen to that word it was not the spirit of God manifesting in a spirit filled life that told you to preach because the spirit and the word are one amen they say the same thing that's why when you see someone claiming that they've got a revelation from God and it's contrary to the word of God you know that's not of God and it's terrible because sometimes you see it and you have to scratch your head and you know I don't think it's really necessary for us to make sure that every single time we encounter that that we we get ready for a fight to say that I know I'm right just like brother bradam said he knew that he was right he knew where he stood we know where we stand the bride knows the word the word is in the bride and she has thus sayith the Lord but she doesn't have to actually battle she doesn't have to fight the word does the fighting the word does the Discerning the word does the dividing between the the soul and the spirit it's not up to us to to worry about that it's just up to us to worry about being in the word he said you can't possibly take the place among the five-fold ministry of Ephesians 4 and not take authority over men sister you'd better listen to that word it was not the spirit of God manifesting in a Spirit-filled life that told you to preach because the spirit and the word are one they say the same thing amen somebody made a mistake somebody was fooled isn't it interesting how he puts these words in there he says somebody made a mistake somebody was fooled he he's given them a way out it's so important to make sure that we have a way out let God do the Sorting it's not up to us to sort people out that way they made a mistake they were fooled so wake up before it's too late Satan fooled Eve and you know Satan would never ever have been able to fool Eve if she would have remained in her husband if she remained even in her husband's word she would never have been able to be fooled but as soon as she started to deviate from the word of her husband just like us as soon as we start to deviate away from the word of our husband uhoh I just love this though somebody made a mistake someone was fooled just wake up before it's too late Satan fooled Eve your mother he's fooling the daughters now may God help you I have need of nothing now when anybody says I have need of nothing he could very well be saying I have everything or he could be saying I don't want anymore as I am full now you can express this any way you want and it all adds up to the fact that the church is complacent she's satisfied with what she has she either figures she has it all or has enough and that is exactly what we find today which denomination is not claiming that it has the Revelation and the power and The Truth Listen to The Baptists and they have it all listen to the Methodist and they have it all am listen to the Church of Christ and everyone is wrong but them here what the Pentecostals say and they have the fullness of the fullness now they know I am telling the truth about them for not one of their manuals say any different they wrote it all out just so nice and put their names to it and finished it all up God just doesn't have anymore and there are those who just don't want anymore they do not believe in healing and would not want it although it is in the word I just can't help but think about that woman that was in the hospital when brother Brandon went to pray for that that other person there and and he said can we pray and and as he went to pray that woman said pull that curtain pull that curtain she was all upset because he was going to pray and and he was shocked and it shocking because there's some people they stay so firm in their beliefs there there's no flexibility and their ability to be able to just accept the word for their day like we said on Sunday I believe it was Sunday that God's going to be revealing himself throughout eternity man there's nobody that can come to the place that could say on Earth on this side of Eternity that I've got it all I've got enough there's never going to be enough we're always going to want more they do not believe in healing and would not want it although it is in the word there are those who would not take the Holy Spirit if God opened the heavens and showed them a sign can you believe that now they are all saying and trying to prove that they have it all or they have enough yet is that the truth compare this 20th century Church to the first century Church go ahead do that where's the power where's the love where's the purified church that with stod sin and walked with faith toward Jesus huh where's the unity I I know that when you start to see Discord and and not Unity my I would say leoan he says you can't find it if this church has all it needs why were they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts as though they didn't have it all and yet they had far more than they have today he goes on to say God's diagnosis now what God saw was entirely different from what they said they saw they said that they were rich in goods and spiritually wealthy they had arrived they had need of nothing but God saw it otherwise he said you don't know this but you are wretched miserable poor blind and naked now when a people are that way especially naked and don't know it there has to be something awfully wrong surely something must be happening it's not that God has blinded their eyes as he did the Jews is the gospel going back to the Jews is history repeating itself I say it is and we know we say it all all the time just any day now CNN and Fox News and all the AL all the news outlets they're going to be posting on their websites live coverage of two witnesses in Israel they're going to see it we know the gospel is going back to the Jews God says this church of the Leo Dean age is wretched and that word comes from two Greek words which means in endure and trial and it has nothing to do with the trials that come to a true Christian for God describes a Christian in trial as blessed and his attitude one of Joy whereas this description is phrased as wretched and miserable my how strange in this age of Plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance How can there be trials well now it is strange but in this age of Plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there is so much more to be had what with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night pep pills in the morning rushing to doctors entering institutions and trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol yes this age boasts of its tremendous stores of worldly Goods but the people are less happy than ever isn't that true you look around the world and you see people same countries fighting one another total opposition to one another because of political views to the place where they want to fight they want to harm one another but they're Brothers they're Sisters of the same Nation we know that it's supposed to be that way the word of God says it my this age boasts of its spiritual attainments but the people are less sure of themselves than ever this age boasts of better moral values and it's more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about its knowledge and science but it's fighting a losing battle in all fields for the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or even keep apress with all the changes that have come upon the Earth in one generation we have gone all the way from the horse and buggy age to the Space Age and we are proud and boastful about it but inside is a Dark Void Cavern that is crying out in torment and without a known reason men's hearts are failing for fear and the world is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of neurotics and we know one of the biggest biggest businesses on Earth today is Big Pharma all of the drugs that are prescribed to people and I don't know what the percentage is someone here probably might know more than I but I can imagine that the psychological aspect of drugs to treat people for depression anti-depressants all of those things that we read about here is probably a humongous percentage of that in big Pharma but it's the age we live in just kick God out and see what happens hey it boasts but it cannot come back it cries peace and there is no peace it cries that it has a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace saith God to the wicked Isaiah 57:21 they are miserable that means they are objects to be pied pied they scorn pity they are full of Pride they VA what they have but what they have will not stand the test of time they have built upon quick sand rather than the rock of revelation of God's word soon cometh the earthquake soon there will be the storms of wrath of God in judgment then come sudden destruction and in spite of all their carnal preparation they will still be unprepared for what comes upon the Earth they are those who in spite of all their worldly efforts are actually opposing themselves and don't know it objects of pity they are indeed pity the poor people who are in this last day in this last day ecumenical move for they call it the move of God when it is of Satan you know brothers and sisters if you just go I think I talked about it on Sunday but I can't get away from this if you listen to Satan's Eden brother Brenham talks in there about how the people will be be having wonderful worship Services they'll be having tremendous praise and not realize that they're worshiping actually worshiping Satan they'll have wonderful music wonderful programs wonderful choirs all the while worshiping the devil can you believe it when I was growing up in the world I always thought the the Church of Satan was the only place to worship Satan I come to find out that God sent a prophet and said no no it'll be in churches they'll be in churches thinking they're worshiping God when they're actually worshiping the devil shocking pity them brothers and sisters pity those who do not know the curse of organization pity those who have so many beautiful churches such lovely parsonages such grandly trained choirs such a show of wealth and such a sedate and reverent form of worship just say Amen in one of those churches sometime when the preaching's going on pity them don't envy them back to the old store buildings back to the dimly lit rooms back to the cellers back to the less of the world and more of God pity those who make their great claims and talk about their gifts feel for them as objects of pity for soon they will be objects of Wrath and you know brothers and sisters I can't help but think you know when when you look around in this world you can't help but actually sigh and cry for the Abominations in the land it I personally believe it's not necessarily the lgbtq thing it's not all of the sinful things that are going on in this world it's the people that think they're worshiping God but are truly worshiping Satan they genuinely want to do right but don't know it brother Brandon preaches it and knoweth it not my paragraph 20 here they are poor now of course that means spiritually poor and go back to that word bankrupt again they haven't actually been able to invest properly it's beautiful brother brandham preaches Investments as one of the last messages they have to invest properly if you don't invest properly you're not going to get the right return these people are not going to get the right return that's why they're to be pied it's not about being boastful and it's not about being puffed up true revelation and causes humility in a real believer and causes them to sigh and cry brother branam says that's one of the signs of the baptism of the Holy Ghost being able to sigh and cry for the Abominations in the land he says they're poor now of course that means spiritually poor or bankrupt the sign of this age as it closes is bigger and better churches with more and more people with more and more manifestation of what is supposed to be demonstrations of the Holy Ghost but the filled altars the gifts of the Spirit in operation the remarkable attendance is not the answer from God for those who come to the altars very seldom stay to go on with God they have just an experience and you know I I can't help but think that's what my pastor used to preach about with a camp experience you can go and get caught up in the emotion of it and then come back home and actually just slip back into the position you were once in and that's not what the camp experience is all about the camp experience is about going and making friends and drawing closer to God to grow spiritually that's what God is interested in our lives and you know I I just can't help but tell that story one more time that I heard an evangelist talk about how a guy came in a prayer line and said you know when I was young I was 16 years old I went to a camp and something happened to me I know something happened to me in a prayer line and I went home and I was so excited and I told all the people about something happening to me and they all said oh it's all just emotion you had a camp experience forget about it don't do it those people get all hung up on all that stuff you just continue on with the way we do things here forget about that and you know the man went 40 years in his life to a prayer line to an evangelist for the spirit of God to tell that man you know what happened there is you got the whole Holy Ghost you've had the Holy Ghost your whole life and the devil tried to tell you that you don't have the Holy Ghost so you fought your whole entire life looking for something you've already had don't put God In The Box you can get the Holy Ghost at camp but just keep feeding them just keep feeding them my for those who come to the altars very seldom state to go on with God and after the great campaigns are finished where they are all those who came down the Isles they heard a man they listened to an appeal they came into the net but they were not fish and turtle like they had crawled back to their own Waters then there was all this talk about glossia glossolalia glossolalia who knows that word glossolalia I had never heard it until I actually read this book so I I actually made sure I I looked it up and brought it here it says the phenomenon of apparently speaking in an unknown language especially in a religious worship it is practiced especially by Pentecostal and charismatic Christians and you don't have to look very far you can see people they'll be having a conversation they'll they'll be talking and then all all of a sudden they'll just go off in some unknown language gasalia will take over in the conversation and you'll be like what what what did you just say but they just carry on and uh yeah there's a term for it colossal Alia I hope I'm saying that right it is supposed to be the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and people are thinking that what we are in the midst of a great Revival the Revival is over my a Vindicated Prophet saying these words the Revival is over America had her last chance in 1957 and I know someone has done it there's a video out there but if you were to look it up you could go and look at what happened after 1957 in terms of crime statistics or moral values in North America or maybe specifically in the United States but Canada and the US they're twins they're tied we're tied together we're the same as much as we don't want to be or or do want to be it doesn't matter we're all North Americans but if you look at the rate of crime and and immorality from this point 1957 I saw a video where a brother did this might have been Lonnie Jenkins that did it but the crime rate is astounding it it if you look at a bar graph it just goes just about straight up from this point in time 1957 just reject God take him out and see what happens he says the Revival is over America had her last chance in 57 now the tongues are God's sign of impending disaster not of of of Revival the tongues are the sign of impending disaster my goodness even as they were when they appeared upon the wall at belshazzar's feast and We Know It took a prophet to come and actually deal with it didn't it and that Prophet was rewarded it's amazing he says' don't you know that many are going to come in the last day and sayl Lord have we not done many wonderful Works in thy name even to the casting out of devils and he will say depart from me ye that work iniquity I never knew you and remember that word new in the Bible is a very intimate experience it is not just a knowledge I'll say it this way it was it's a perfect realization a perfect realization my I should probably call the musicians don't you know that many are going to come in the last day and say Lord Lord have we not done many wonderful Works in thy name even to the casting out of devils and he will say depart from me ye that work iniquity I never knew you that's Matthew 7:22 to 23 Jesus said they were workers of iniquity knowing that they should do something and not doing it and knowing not to do something and yet doing it workers of iniquity yet you get a man that can come and pray for the sick get oil and blood appearing in the congregation excuse me prophecy coming forth and all manner of the Supernatural and the people will gather around him and swear that he is of the Lord e even though he is actually making money a racket of religion and living in sin the only answer they have is the absolutely unbiblical answer of well he gets results so he must be of God how terrible how actually poor this age is in the spirit of God and the poor poverty stricken ones don't even know it and we know he's not talking about poverty stricken financially he's talking spiritually maybe stand with me as we close [Music] tonight certainly wonderful to study this book and to know that that's not us what we read about tonight that's not us let's just bow in
