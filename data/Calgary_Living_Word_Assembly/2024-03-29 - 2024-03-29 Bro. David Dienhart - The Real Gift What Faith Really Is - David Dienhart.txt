preaching Bring It On am don't look at this man I'll tell you what and don't get to looking at yourself either but look at what God has done for you and what he's done for you he placed in you amen hallelujah amen amen so I just thankful that you know little woman meeting Elijah said is all well with you all with your family amen she said all is well the prophet told us why she said that because she met the word I wonder if we met the word amen hallelujah hallelujah I want to bring a little something tonight I have a thought in my heart for this tonight and through Sunday if the Lord is willing and a subject I give my title here but my subject I want to speak on is and I appreciate the brother that read the poem which one was that that read the poem up here was you I thought that was you yes I appreciated that because watch what my subject is positionally placed in Jesus Christ now he didn't know that the prophet said that means so much to us talking to to his bride to see ourself positionally placed amen so i' kind of run that the subject through these next meetings if God's willing and I want my subject tonight to be the real gift amen what faith really islah let's bow our heads in prayer our heavenly father Our Father how we can say that tonight thank you Lord thy will be done in this meeting as it was already positioned and already for ordained in heaven yes Lord may you Lord Minister your word in the strength of your word for you said your word is in our mouth and Lord I'm expecting you to move the man completely aside which I believe Lord as far as I know I'm committed to you you can speak things that David knows nothing about right neither any of us Lord but speak to that soul and may light shine upon that Soul amen and bring forth that predestinated life that came through your blood yes Lord Lord Jesus we thank you for this opportunity now and may the words that come out of my mouth bring Deliverance bring healing and bring Salvation to those that are positionally ready and also predestinated to receive it I ask it For Your Glory father in thy name and the blessing upon Thy Word word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen turn with me in your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 1 I have three scriptures I'd like to read hope that's better I was getting a little feedback is that better okay okay good praise the Lord now if I get a little bit running this in my you just forgive me seemed like every time I get up to preach it's like eating uh Mexican food my nose wants to run but I'll just ask Lord you take a hold of it and you can do with it what you want amen Ephesians chapter 1 beginning with the well let's just let's begin with the third verse no let's begin with verse two Grace be unto you is there any you in here amen yes and peace from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ amen blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ by the way that's your father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath pasted it blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ notice the believer's position here in Heavenly places in Christ Christ amen according as he hath chosen you that's us amen amen that's him has chosen you in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen having predestined ated us unto the adoption of children or going up to that fullness there growing up into him by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will whose will not yours not your human will his will all right to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted what accepted accepted are you accepted whereas he has made us accepted in the Beloved Amen in whom we have Redemption through his blood we who are we those that were in him chosen in him yes life lays in the blood right amen all right so having Redemption through the blood and the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace amen wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence I have this marked down another place I'll just read it here now having made known unto us the mystery yes of his word his will yes sir that's his word it is yes is that right that's his word all right wherein Heath made known unto us and we know that this isn't a group Affair this is an individual Affair amen amen May known unto us the mystery of his will according to his not yours his takes takes takes David right out of the picture unto his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself self I'm talking about the outer man takes the outer man out of the way because the mystery is not the outer man right it's the inner man amen amen amen all right all right turn with me over here that's quite a bit of reading I'm sorry but I'm just going to follow the lord if that's all right all right now turn me over here to Hebrews amen chapter 11 verse one verse one sets the theme of the whole chapter amen all right so verse one now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen or felt or tasted amen amen right nothing the senses will declare right all right but we're not walking according to that that's right that's right we're walking according not by sight but by faith amen okay so let me read it again now the now Faith is the substance of things hoped for notice it's not imagination it's a substance right amen it's real it's living it's substance all right of things hoped for what is hoped for what he promised yes he gave it to you by the word he gave it to you by promise of the EV see and then it's for things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen I want you to turn with me over there to now first John chapter five I'm just going to start with verse one I'm putting emphasis on verse four here it could emphasize everything we'll probably go into other scriptures as we go on later on in these meetings verse one whosoever believeth that's it amen whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God who could even call Jesus Lord except the Lord was in youall that's right is that right amen all right but said Jesus is born of God for everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God where when we love God and keep his Commandments do you love God sir how can you except he first loved you brother Curtis God bless you praise the Lord Rebecca God bless you I've known this brother a while been a real blessing to me hallelujah amen I've you've driven a long ways or flew I don't know how but God bless you all right I'm sorry sorry to take that Sidetrack there but amen let me come back to this again for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments that's how you prove his love and his Commandments are not Grievious for whatsoever is born of God or of the word of God overcometh the world amen amen ah Hallelujah this is the victory yes that overcometh the world even our faith you may be seated sorry to keep you standing so long I want to read something out of communion just to start this out and I want you young people to listen all of us to listen but young people this when I had this on my heart to read it I didn't know how I'd read it but I just felt it spoke to all of us of course but to young people they think this is an older people's message it is not right I knew what it meant at a very young age of 12 and 14 years old to know what this message meant that wasn't something I did that was something God put in me amen amen amen amen and he can put it in you yes amen amen and if you realize after we're done here he's already put it in you Hallelujah that's right all right now so let's go on here he says I want to start at page six you're very familiar with this but brother Brandon referring back to a young age here when something happened this is communion 1965 last message he preached this recorded right right y all right he says this like in the book here I'll start a paragraph 44 if you have the book like in the book here a spot where he was talking about the two books being one now you know in the church AE book he goes over that all right makes it very clear we're not here to take our own thinking about things we had a prophet and God used the prophet to interpret his word amen how many know that amen we don't have a right to put our thinking to it right you just ask God to reveal what he said amen because what he said you'll find in the word yes right if you can't place what he said in the word you don't have what he said amen that's because God will put it in the word God will place it to you in the word right cuz any true Revelation got to be Vindicated by the scriptures right yes amen that's right all right so but he's saying here speaking back what how when he first came he said he said but that but there two books being one The Book of Life The First Book of Life coming up was when you were born that was your your natural birth see but one time but then one time way back down in there there was a little grain of life if I as I was explaining a little grain of life and to some of you young sisters out explaining that in the house this afternoon there was a little grain of Life laying there that you wonder where did it come from I was saying this take talking for myself like you self like you was going to say William brandham well 40 years ago William brandham isn't the same one tonight if somebody back there would say William brandom he was a rank Rascal anybody anybody here ever was a rank Rascal true we all were sir amen but God had something else in us thank you Lord now watch he said no matter how rank rascal you were Jacob was too yeah but God loved Jacob why because he had the seed what seed God's seed Amen in the seed God's seed God's seed is germinated or gered excuse brother brandom said it's gerz Amen a lot of seed here out here but not not every seed germatize but he's talking about this little grain of Life inside of here all right now he says here because I was a rank Rascal because I was born of Charles and Ella branam now I'm not talking about your parents being bad they had to bring you by Union into this life because you were ordained and predestinated to come here amen so it wasn't by chance that you Believers have been brought right here even to this place Amen brother brandom said there's nothing can happen to a real Believer by chance amen it's all ordained of God praise the lord we ought to walk out of here thanking the lord right now we could just close the book and say Amen it's good to be here amen amen all right so he said I was born of Charles and Ella brandom in their nature I was a sinner I came to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me I didn't even have to have them happen they were there humanly all right now but down in there also was another nature present now watch is another other words every seed shall bring forth of its kind whether natural as Eve said I got a man from the Lord that's a natural law God put in place is that right but also Adam he brought forth one too are you with me and it had to produce of its kind all right now there's another nature present see predestinated was in there by God in there by who this other nature was in there by God right all right in the same body two Natures in there I'm not talking Two Souls now don't get that in your head I'm talking about two Natures they're actually twins right amen boy I tempted to bring that message tonight I did I thought of that twins closer than you think yes sir true yeah one side of you is one twin the other side the other twin but the Elder has to serve the younger Hallelujah is that right because the younger had the birthright that's right not the older amen all right I think you understand enough right there okay so start serving start you just start you let the younger start taking possession amen of the ground yes and it will obey will obey what the word amen all right as the ground has to obey the seed you put it in the ground you water it you plant it and that seed will produce of his kind but what's it going to do the ground has to give away for the seed to be manifest good and bad you understand that same rain different seed but they have produce what they are but I'm talking about the seed of God here tonight all right now so he said I only catered to one as I growed I only catered to one i grewed as a baby da da and da da and the first thing you know I became a liar and everything else that's a sinner because it was in him because I was raised that way but down in there was a little speck of life amen how did that come forth where did that come from Life himself amen listen you were loosed by God's blood it loosed you it's changed you therefore there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen amen perfect blood has loosed you you're free where's your faith lay tonight where does your faith lay all right does it lay in the one other twin or does it lay in the word okay I don't want to get spread out here too far I got to come back now there's little speck of Life all the time now I'm going to bypass some of this he goes back to where you know how his family was pop and Mom they'd have parties and he'd go out hunting with his dog and take his lanard out into the woods and stay all night and I thought how many times being out there in the summertime to get my sticks put him down little Windbreak amen and he said I camped here one night I built a fire right here and I was waiting for my own coup dog to tree and I had a fire here it was froze 5 Ines deep in the ground but Little Flower where did you come from no matter what the elements are you won't keep that bride seed from growing what is the bride seed his own amen you can't stop it there's not enough mistakes there's not enough failures when you have that Word Alive in you there's not enough of anything could keep that from coming to its place in the Fulfillment of his word because he will fulfill his word his word cannot return void and you are that word amen but his word won't return void you're not here by chance you're here for purpose and the purpose is God's purpose amen and his purpose will not be thwarted you have a place and you have the position and your position is in Christ and that's good enough the word is good enough amen amen heavens and earth will pass the worry but that word won't and if you be that word how you going to pass away there's nothing going to upset the word so where's your strength lay not in your weakness amen it lays in the word amen all right and you're weak the humanness is weak you have to reckon yourself weak and when you do you'll give yourself to someone that's strong when you realize you can't do anything then you'll submit yourself to him that said I can do all things and you can do all things if you believe I can do all things he is in you all right now now what's he saying here who where did hey he said where did you come from who came out and planted you what hot house that did they bring you out of or denomination or what about it where'd you come from that little FL say why it was Little Flower I'd say why it was froze everything build a fire besides the freezing element there was heat element everything on top that big old log where I burned you and yet here you are and you're alive and you're alive where did you come from what was it there was another here's your twin there was another William branam see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God Amen the word of God the genes of God the word of God that was placed that was placed in there you never put it there young people listen to me he put it there where's your desire tonight where's the desire of your soul tonight are you wanting more of God you say I just don't understand it quit trying to understand any of it amen you can't do it let God reveal it to you you don't sit down to eat and try to figure out what's in your food you're hungry you eat it and it works amen is that right then if you eat the word of God it's going to work because there's a craving inside of you for it hallelujah amen and God put that craving in you and you're drawing through that word life to Quicken what's God put in you amen so just start drinking start eating Amen Let God direct it oh you're not too young you know God pulls on your heart you yield to that pull and watch what God will do he'll change you amen he'll make you different he'll make you a standout he'll make you to be manifest himself manifest I don't want it any other way I want himself to be manifest through me and the prophet said in this age he now works in and through his bride yes is that right okay now so but something in me was calling who brought you here it was that eternal life working in the body he said it was placed there each one of us can think similar thing but watch what he said it was working before you even knew it it was already working it was already there working you just had to come to realization in your appointed time and God opened the mystery of that to you personally amen the veil was taken off and now you're looking into a glass that declares who you are amen you want to really know who you are come to this word come to the word for the season and you'll know who you are amen let God take the seal off your life and break that seal all right now so there's something in me calling that eternal life was working in the body then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it the Holy Ghost was poured upon it and it began to grow and that old life was forgiven and put in the sea of forgetfulness God's forgetfulness never remembered anymore now that was a long route or go here but I hope that helps someone all right now you realize that to be his chosen in him that you had to come from the same source that Jesus came is that right you came from the same source and was eternal with him already am all right now I'm going to be drawing some things out of different messages here that I have so you bear with me in perfect Faith he States this now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have have faith in what the word says you are where does faith takes this resting place in the unmovable word of God unmovable unchanging word of God that's where Faith takes this resting place whose Faith God's God's Own Faith we're not talking about an intellectual Faith tonight we're talking about God's own faith all right and Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was see you're coming from the same Source through the same Source from the same Source it's written of Me Jesus went back to the scripture and said it's written of me didn't David in the Psalms and the prophets and all them speak of him he said I'm the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven amen I'm the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I'm all these things I am that I am amen where were you when he said that all right then what he said and the same promises that applied to him applies to his bride hallelujah amen amen amen CU you were in him you're accepted in him when you died with him we talk about the crucifixion yeah yeah it wasn't a good day but it was a wonderful day for us because we were judged in his body blameless we were judged his body therefore we don't come to condemnation there is no more condemnation we don't stand to be at the judgment and be judged we already are judged in Christ that's a wonderful day amen for us see it changes the aspect of it doesn't it it it looked terrible it looked it looked it looked terrible but that was life being given amen is that right freely poured out for judgment because the law of of God required death to transgress the law is that right and he paid it amen and you paid it in him thank you Lord hallelujah you paid it in him all right now so he says I am that tree of life in the garden I am all these things I am that I am and he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah Bo couldn't we go and what else he said that same spirit in you an anointed Messiah of the age is that right the same anoint anointing upon you as it was in him I'm not going to get ahead of myself here I got tomorrow and Sunday yet but that same spirit amen all right he said anointed Messiah and he's pouring himself into us and we're becoming one we are becoming one for what what's happening there's a union made here amen an invisible Union the union is invisible but the manifestation is very visible but they don't know what brings it because that's the mystery and it's not known to the public hallelujah it's only known to the bride amen but it's manifested as a witness because you're his witness why because you were with him from the beginning and the beginning was the word now we're coming into something because that word is a thought expressed in order for the thought to be manifested had to be expressed in a word and the Word was manifested Hallelujah the thought manifested that's why you and I have that word in our mouth Born Again Believers have that word of faith already in our mouth amen because it's in your heart talk about recognizing position all right now he said now let's go on on but it's my faith in God now I myself do nothing but it's my faith and the spirit of God was in him he said now I myself talking about the man Jesus was a man how many know that he was all man he was fully man amen but the spirit of God was with him upon him he said now I myself do nothing but it's my faith in God amen it's my faith and God was with him God was in him I mean and God was in him the word made manifest God was in him the word God the word made manifest other words it was God's thought of himself in the fullness of the godhead bodily as in a son form because it was God manifested in flesh amen all right now so it was God in him the word made manifest and when the word of God comes now it's turned the corner now when the word of God comes in you amen now when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest amen for you are a believer that Iden identified it the word manifested in you identifies you a Believer what am I talking about a True Believer amen there's all kinds of people say they're Believers right but there's an Evidence to a True Believer we'll come to that in a minute maybe not a minute maybe 10 minutes 15 maybe a half hour all right but it's made manifest for you are a Believer now watch what he said see and a believer is a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you don't I want you to hold that quote really close now a Believer is the faith of God we just read what faith was we know faith is a revelation faith is revelation it's not imagination it's Revelation it's something you know it's something you have it's called substance of the promise amen are you with me all right so the faith of God that moves in you that's the believer God recognizes the believer because his own faith is in him amen so now Faith a revelation is the substance amen so the faith of God the believer was already is substance of God of the word amen amen amen now let's go to a couple more scriptures here or first let's I want to take some other thing here now okay watch what we're talking about here now this God's Great secret has always blinded we're talking about God's secret now amen only in The Believer because we're referring we're showing who the believer is amen this is what I'm talking about is positionally placing you amen you are the faith of God all right God's Great secret has always blinded the wisdom of the world they can't get it they don't they just don't understand it Satan don't understand it none of the rest of them understands it but just those who are predestinated to understand it how God and Christ are one notice now he's talking about the three-fold mystery he in the this is the second fold of Christ the mystery you you'll understand where we're coming from here the next secondly the manifested Christ in you first it was God manifested in Christ then all that he poured into Christ Christ is poured into his body the bride the church all right so he said secondly the manifested Christ in you the hope of glory this is where we're at all right the great manifested God in Christ now Christ manifested in you all right now look what was once God's Great secret he had in the back part of his mind I can't cover it all now you just have to read between the lines here well was once God's Great secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer right hallelujah amen all right that is the body of Christ amen the believer that is what he put in the heart of the believer that is the body of Christ where he put this was in his own body God's got a body God's got a wife a body has St prepared me amen is that right he's got a wife this is Adam had a wife but where was the mystery in Adam but God took the seal off of Adam and revealed the mystery and Eve couldn't come to herself until God brought her to the man then she could see where she came from that's why the seals were open that is the mystery of that seven seal it's unveiled in secret why because the secret denotes a I mean the silence denotes a secret but it's open hallelujah it's open okay I can't go any further I feel the Lord stopped me because this going on to another meeting all right now but watch what he said it's put in the hearts of the believer what was once God's Great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest for you are a Believer so the faith of God is now made manifest it was hidden there was a part of himself hidden that he had in his mind of himself amen that could not be open it could not be revealed until this hour now we're right what what is the next step where are we coming to now what's the third fold Eden we're it's Christ's achievement all right now he said then it's given right down to his church what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church it's a love affair amen between him and the church why because a Union's been made the Bible said that he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit amen wonder whose spirit that was you're joined unto the Lord and the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there Liberty not bound not binding it's liberty amen you're free Hallelujah you're set free you're loosed the perfect blood has loosed you amen amen amen amen all right now you see and he's Whispering secrets to her every day I have a little secret whisper to me why because his mercies are new every morning great is his faithfulness and that's the truth you lay in this word and there'll be secrets ministered to you because your desire is more of him I've got to have more of him there's something driving me to more of him I've got to have him in order to make a Rapture this Secret's got to be unveiled to me and that Secret's got to grow into himself hallelujah amen amen now so Jesus making love to the church his bride Whispering secrets to her and just like your wife you love her so much you tell her your secrets you get her up next to you and love you and everything you know how it is and that's just what God is doing to the church he's letting her know the secrets just the secrets it's not a public show you're trying to make it a public show forget it because when this comes in it automatically lives out right you don't have to pump it up and make it happen you don't have to music and everything else and we love music but you don't have any of that when he comes in it's a word it's alive it's God's faith and it's moving amen he Hebrews 4:12 said the word is sharper a two-edged sword amen living and operative let's go let's I don't mean to turn here but let's go over to Hebrews just a minute look at this just to and I don't want to take too long I didn't think I had too much here to take so long and I pray that I don't being a Friday here but we're in a special meeting all right Hebrews 4:12 and the word of God is quick and Powerful that's what I want to come to quick and Powerful means if you look down if you have a skull field it's a little o there it says living and operative the word of God is living and operative that's exactly what he said his bride would be living and in action the word living is that right amen so there they there now so we have that now let's keep moving here I'm speaking to myself keep moving well you keep moving too just keep walking walking with who God you want to make a Rapture walk with God Enoch walked with God and was not amen what's going to happen to you if you walk with God Amen with God in you and you and him walking together in communion A Love Affair what's it going to create what's it going to happen it brings a body change amen amen amen all right you just got to lay in this presence of the Sun and ripen so now Ephesians let's go to Ephesians a minute 2 chapter 2 Ephesians 2 and verse 8 verse one we'll take with verse one and we know he's the head of the body that's the first chapter in the 22nd verse said he put all things under his feet amen is that right and what is and let's let's start verse 19 here I don't mean to start so far back but take verse 19 what is the exceeding greatness of his power that your eyes of your understanding being lightened see that and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usw who believe there it is that's it let me start that 18th the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that we may know no no no what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usw who believe according to the working of what of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places and he goes on to say let's just skip down the 22 and had put all this principality and power and might and Dominion under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the body the church which is his body the fullness of him the fullness of him I love that word the fullness of him because our message today the message to us is the fullness of him that filth all in all now verse one chapter 2 and you hath he quickened he quickened who were dead in trespass F in sins let us jump down verse 5 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ he raised us up that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by Gra Grace are you saved watch for by grace are you saved people stop there A lot of times just stop and that's true it's a true statement for by Grace you are saved not your ability God's ability but look where it comes through for Grace by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves it is the gift now watch My Title Here it is the gift of God what is you're saved by grace through faith not of yourself that faith is not of yourself right Grace has given it to you it's not of yourself it was placed there amen amen not of yourselves it is the gift of God Amen thank you Lord now if you want to he give you the GI gift how many will want to receive it that's all you have to do if he giv you a gift I gave you a gift you say I don't want the gift it's not for you then but if I give you the gift and you accept that gift the gift is yours amen you've accepted it then that ought to settle it amen amen because this is the gift of God Romans 6:23 said the gift of God is eternal life that right amen so the gift of God is eternal life amen yes it is thank you Lord now we're going to go a little deeper here let's go a little deeper shall we all right now we'll go over here to what something he said now I know you've been kind of going through the church age book I guess you still are okay but John 51516 you have turned to it I'll just quote it to you you have not chosen me yes but I have chosen you now because of that you say well I had a choice you did but if there wasn't a predestinated choice already made you wouldn't have made the choice right is that right you had the choice you had free moral agency but God before you even had that opinion or had the ability to make the choice he already chose you in himself Therefore your choice is made but you had to make it amen he said ask and I'll Grant it to you but the but the word the the will of God was that you ask he already determined to give it to you but you got to ask great are you with me all right now so you have not chosen me but I've chosen you now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world that choosing of the bride was purpose in himself and I read it Ephesians 1:9 and in Romans 9:11 or 911 it said the purpose of God the purpose then of God was according to a that election according to election that election might stand amen how did he elect You by forn knowledge he knew you how can you know him unless he knew you amen he knew you therefore he said my sheep know me yes because I knew them amen amen hallelujah what a rest that's right all right now that purpose of God was according to election might stand you can't read it any other way Page 149 of church age book you can't read it any other way the heart purpose of excuse me let me read again the heart purpose the Eternal purpose now we'll find that Ephesians 11 verse 11 that God by his eternal purpose let's just read that real quick Ephesians 3 let start verse 9 and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath God hid in God no excuse me beginning of the world hath been hid excuse me hath been hid in God who created All Things by the seed his seed manifest Jesus Christ himself all right all things by his word all right to the intent that NOW Watch God's intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God Amen according see why the devil's fighting you about feeding in this open book that's right he'll fight you every way he can he'll get you tied up somewhere he'll point you to something else you're too busy you're too busy you're too busy true is that right yes but what do you have to do Die daily to yourself take up your cross and follow him amen amen all right I just thought I'd dropped that in for extra measure now the heart purpose the Eternal purpose so let's look at this verse 11 according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ notice where this eternal purpose was purposed INR Christ Jesus our not a second person yeah right our Lord in whom we have boldness and access I love that word access in whom we have boldness and access to everything our husband owns amen thank you Lord all that he has amen amen wonderful in whom we have boldness and access don't you believe the wife has access to everything her husband has amen should hello maybe that stirred up something I hope it did right because we're talking about a spiritual union here and you're reflecting that Union amen natural that's right speaking of a higher Union because I'm in him and he in me amen amen and the Bible said that we give him right over his body the wife he has no power over his body but the wife and the wife has no power over her body but the husband amen amen hello who's the husband's body you are amen I and you ye and me one yes sir one body one head I'll just leave it there it's 1 Corinthians 7:4 maybe you've never heard it that way but we'll take the spiritual aspect of that of that scripture good brother amen applies the natural I was going to preach on that by way that's what I kept being tossed around about the Lord but I just I know that this is what God wants tonight amen you would bear with me a little while longer okay now now let's go back here so I I said the Eternal purpose in whom we have boldness let now watch in verse 12 in whom in whom Jesus Christ Our Lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him God's Own Faith amen you're not another you are God's Own Faith you are his substance Hallelujah Glory thank you Lord now watch what he says now now his heart purpose his eternal purp only one Eternal you know that is God and if you're in him you're as Eternal as he is amen that's what the other twin fight you with that's right that's what he questions that's what he argues with you about but Faith takes this resting place Amen in the living word amen Lord you see this confidence that we have is in you your headship is in you amen amen and it's the word that's why you can accept and receive this word and you can see the word for the season amen all right now so you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride I just love this look at the heart purpose amen the very core of himself right here the very heart core of himself the very Faith the same Faith his faith that he had in himself amen amen do you believe God spoke the worlds into existence by faith amen then it wasn't imagination he spoke what he had he spoke what he knew he spoke what is real he put it to action amen and the word has never failed in the mouth of Believers in this day am now what the prophet said the word is never failed in the mouth of the believing Christian see Christian is not a cliche to us Christian is deity made flesh amen it's exactly what it is yes sir all right now so he's his his eternal purpose his heart purpose was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself Hallelujah that purpose that Eternal purpose was in himself y amen where were you where were you when I laid the foundation of the world and the sons of God sang together where were you and if you know where you come from you know who you are and if you know who you are you know where you're going is that right [Music] if you know where you came from he just said where you came from you were the very Heart Of God you were his very purpose you his eternal purpose was in you you yourself literally you I don't care how little Satan must make you little you don't know anything it don't care what we know it's what we believe he's trying to push that he's trying to push his religious knowledge upon you don't allow it to happen it's a ration and the bride is the only one that can see receive that true revelation of the word which is substance cuz that's your evidence amen amen that you are a seed of God amen amen praise the Lord all right now he said the purpose that purpose was his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being Eternal was decreed you've already been decreed hallelujah oh if I can just do something if I can just do something you can't have to do anything just believe what he said take him at his word and go to doing what he said to do amen eat the book that's right eat it you become what you eat eat the book amen amen I'm not trying to scream at you yell that's just good brother thank you amen that's sium all right am now Hallelujah all right so and it was decreed before the foundation of the world watch carefully now and see this before there was even a speck of Stardust before God was God God is an object of worship so God was eternal but so to be an object of worship he became God Amen Hallelujah is that right and he had Angels created to worship him where were you then right amen still in himen who are they worshiping right Lord right Hallelujah who were they worshiping they were worshiping God where were you amen thank you Lord and the Bible said that God would make the people at the end bow at your feet amen amen make the unbeliever bow at your feet they want to reject the word you're the word and you'll make them someday bow at your feet because you were the word living in your day and that's God himself amen amen praise the Lord you weren't born of Flesh and Blood you were born of the word you were born of God amen amen amen the new birth is a spoken word creation amen amen and it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that's you you are the birth word that's your identification you're not another you're him hallelujah amen I'm I'm talking about this mystery I'm talking about the real gift yes sir unveiled amen amen I'm coming to it just hold on you Buckle yourself up real good now listen all right now watch carefully before the specka SP Stardust before God God was God see no one there to worship him so he created angels and he was at that time the eternal spirit he was potentially God and he was known only as an eternal spirit the bride now this what point we going to get to the bride was already in his mind amen amen hallelujah where is fear where's anxiety I know we face it every day and don't tell me you don't every day the devil's trying to put something there to get you to reason with how you're going to get over this how you going to cross over this he said I don't know how I'm getting over under around it but God will make a way through it amen am and he already has Hallelujah all right now so the bride was already in his mind yes she was kind of got a question about that but he said yes she was right she was now watch this word existing yes she was existing in his that's Eternal his the Eternal thoughts am she was existing in his thoughts brother sister that very word substance means something existing amen amen that's real she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God what about those thought of God they are Eternal are they not they are Eternal Hallelujah all this makes me happy this makes me happy are you happy I'm happy am huj we can be happy you Lord hallelujah there's no reason not to be happy there's no reason to be discouraged there's no reason to be complaining quit your murmuring I'm speaking to myself I'm speaking to David quit your [Applause] murmuring peace be still and the winds and the waves and David obeyed him hallelujah amen you take rulership the Lord said I put my mind in you I've given my thoughts to you I you know where I am then take rulership over that spirit that's wanting to reason with you and take you down by your senses you don't have to accept it reject it he can't give it to you unless you accept it you reject it refuse to give it place in the name of Jesus Christ we're not talking about a why was we're talking about the I [Music] [Applause] am all right now so they're existing he said are the thoughts of God we're talking about the thoughts of God he knew all things but we're talking about God's thoughts of himself amenu the script the Bible the prophet said when God thought of you and thought of others when he thought of me and thought of you he was the thoughts of himself becoming material Glory so good I'm talking about a real gift yeah yeah I'm talking about what a real believer is that's right I'm talking about what faith really is amen all right amen now watch he said so you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this Hallelujah that just blessed me so much when I've seen this if you can see this you will see many things amen of course it'll just keep unfolding it keeps unfolding it's eternity unfolding it just keeps unfolding it's like the seven seal like he said it was you'll blow out five stars and one of those Stars will blow out five more and the path of the Justice a Shining Light and it grows greater and greater so true amen amen so true keeps unveiling itself keeps unfolding itself amen well I thought I knew it but it just expanded to something more it just kept revealing it something more the thoughts of God are Eternal and you are those thoughts you're that substance Hallelujah of what he hoped for hallelujah hallu thank you glory to God amen amen he said now like I said faith is not an imagination amen faith ises not reason [Music] brother R said this faith I have here isn't something I imagine I hope for he said it's something I have yeah it's real amen and you don't have to wonder if it's going to come to pass you've already got it Hallelujah the word has to be fulfilled and Faith puts the word in action to fulfillment amen hallelujah the word quickened in you is Jesus Christ himself and that's the new birth amen amen what kind of stature did he grow into and what kind of troubles did he have to go through he learned obedience to the things he suffered but he was God's word made [Music] manifest he was the character of God and that character had to be molded amen as Rebecca rode on those camel the very thing she watered was carrying her I wonder if you're watering that seed and it's carrying you to the one you've never even seen but your love having not seen you love while we look not at the things which are seen but the things that are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are the eternal amen hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord now I'm kind of lost track of my notes Here let me just look back here a minute all right so we see the purpose that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith verse 17 third of Ephesians that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that being that ye that ye being rooted and grounded in love God is love he that hath love loves God Amen he that hath love he knows when he loves the Brethren you can love the Brethren without loving God because God is the Brethren amen amen thank you Lord God is the body amen and God is love and he that hath God hath love how the devil twist you around in that won't he y he wants to speak FAL love all the time to you right FAL Love's okay but G love is above that that rejoices in the truth right amen amen there's a lot of we could saying that but you know what I'm trying to say there's only one God's love it's a higher love amen I we don't want to preach on that because we can preach a whole message on love and we have and we will all right now they are real the the thoughts of God are real amen all right now so I think you got the idea I could take a lot of that the the see you didn't become seed by the rebirth you were seed that's right right amen that's why you can be quickened amen amen see the new birth is the word quickened you can't have a new birth unless you're the seed true amen that's it amen but we I'm going to come to the evidence of whether you are or not which I've already touched on it but we'll just touch on it some more Hallelujah all right now so we'll just take this idea well it's some way I feel or I shouted or I did this or I did that it's simpler than that yes sir that's right thank you we think that's pretty simple but this is simpler than that amen we'll get to it in just a minute amen all right down on the inside brother Brown talking about the three realms Body Spirit Soul okay you are a Triune being all right but down on the inside of the next realm the next realm he was talking about was beyond the second

that's predestinated by God there is where the real seed germ lays is in there amen see God hit us so far away the devil you know let that be revealed sometime the devil couldn't find it if he tried

out for his elect seed in the soul amen if that's not there you can have the anointing you can have cast out Devils you can have Mighty signs and wonders but never able to receive the word by Revelation for the hour and the time amen all right now he says he said it can be anointed and do all these other things but when it comes to that TI poost to that word you'll never move from there

right back to the word it's written of me there's your answer so we do have the devil's answer yes sir am amen yes all right now so now let's look at this I'm coming down to a close now real quick this is taken out of the message things that are to be I think it's paragraph 112 brother R said you say I got the baptism of the with the Holy Spirit now that's a requirement amen you can't be born again without the baptism of the Holy Ghost exactly right right is that right amen justification sanctification the baptism and the baptism made way for the Holy Ghost himself Christ himself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again amen seed time it's seed time bride original word time you are the original word you're the original life and you're the manifestation of the son of man am than you Lord amen it's the original life that's me it's the Original Seed that's me amen that's him yes amen amen the son of man is revealed amen the seventh seal is unveiled hallelujah amen and you're that you're that message amen amen public knows nothing about it they weren't meant to know anything about it you were because it's Rapture right yes right and the bride's the only one that's going to take the Rapture amen so he had to make sure that it was Kept Secret from Satan until the very end when he could do nothing about it Hallelujah and now it's unveiled to individuals right we'll walk in the light the beautiful light we walk where the de drops of Mercy are bright thy light has come bright amen so what did Solomon say to his Queen Arise My [Music] Love Come Away amen where we going the rapture's begun Come Away thank you Hallelujah all right where's it begun in you Hallelujah you're the opened word you're being caught away in fact this catch away is so powerful it's a secret it's a secret catching away he comes up and you hear the you hear the sound say the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him come away go you out to meet him and she arose trimmed her lamp Hallelujah put her got ready GL amen is that right and went into the marriage is that right and the door was shut y now I don't know when that last one comes in but the door will be shut amen because you've entered into Union amen and that Union is his presence and in that presence you grow in that presence you're growing up into what himself that's why that himself is getting clearer clearer to you because he's personalized himself to you you are himself okay now I've been over that I'll stop now let's go on let's quit let's take it so I said I got the baptism of Holy Spirit brother Bram said that still has nothing to do with it now you have to understand what he's saying now watch he said he said that's only just a temporal gift for you yes but watch what he said the real gift the real gift is your soul down in there amen that was born of God right and that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God am and there you grow up see then you're a son and daughter of God you're a child of God coming see just like a mother now you're in the bowels of the earth trying to come forth you're a Son of God coming forth you see the word says I should do this I should be born again see and you obey it you come to it all right now he said well I belong to church that don't mean one thing amen I believe in going to church y but you don't belong to church you belong to the word Christ all right then those members of Christ come together and you got quite a bonfire that's right right because those members of Christ come together there's Christ that's why we assemble together yes amen the more as you see the day approaching amen yeah right okay we should be coming together not running from the presence we ought to be coming into the presence of God for where two or three are gathered together in my name there is his presence there is he himself amen you want to meet him come come to church amen come with the body no I'm not saying you can't meet him only in church you meet him out there too amen is that right but you got a place to be fed I'll just stop there I'll let the pastor take care of all that all right now the real gift amen see you see your father he say well I'm Pentecostal that don't mean that it now that that I belong that if you don't line with that word there's something wrong right then see your real father ain't God see because that real start in your soul before that was even a spirit it was your soul that Soul didn't come from God then it wasn't a germ of God to begin you're deceived you're just in a patch of weeds amen think of that just bearing the words the world's record of the weeds coming forth acting like the world loving the world is because the love of God is not in you let's look a little further now let's what's the evidence of that the real Gene the real germ watch what brother Brown said the real Gene the real germ is a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world Amen then you were in God a gene a word an attribute from the beginning we just covered that all right now the evidence whether you are or not whether you have that word or not amen hallelujah thank now we know it was the thought and that thought became expressed and God brought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed and that's you and Jacob alone had the seed is why he had respect to the birthright and the Covenant of God if you are true seed you will hear that word amen right what does hear me receive itall you will receive that word amen the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you you're the branch he's the Vine he energizes the branch all right empowers you he will Empower you and you will receive the word for your day and age amen see how clear the true evidence is right when the word is revealed to you Jesus was the royal seed he lived in a human body and when the spirit called to him the the word manifested thought when the spirit called to it there he went to Jordan was baptized in water and upon obeying the word the Holy Spirit came upon him and the voice said this is my beloved Son hear ye him now if you excuse me this is my beloved wife hear ye him amen not her him amen because the final voice yes is the bride under her messenger she becomes the final voice to the age amen you see there it's hear ye him amen through her yes amen amen amen hear you him that's what we're talking about amen amen if you're going to hear him what about the one that came from him amen amen Eve was the mystery of Adam revealed the bride is the mystery of Christ the which is the mystery of God Amen revealed so she's the complete revelation of the whole thing right amen and that's the message of the seventh angel Revelations 10 Hallelujah the message of Revelations 10 was the seventh seal which opened all of them amen right there all right so the message of Revelations 10 the seventh seal that's Prophet said that Feast of the trumpets he said the message of Revelations 10 is the seventh seal yes and the message of Revelation 10 when the when the seventh angel shall begin to sound brother Braham said not in the beginning but his message amen the other was catching attention to the voice the sign pointing to the voice are you with me and so so he said now she oh yeah the when the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God would be finished amen this day this scripture is being fulfilled amen amen [Music] amen then take the book bride give me the book yes yes why could why could John being the type of the Bride be so adamant give me the book the angel said take the book yes take it eat it because you must prophesy again yeah I believe in return Ministry it's happening amen oh yes we are the return Ministry we are the return Ministry of Jesus Christ it's not another it's himself revealed again amen right we've had the sign pointing to that conception we've conceived the word amen the promised son comes through the bride hello amen are you with me yes all right I'm closing now see I didn't make three or four closes here I just said I got to now I'm closing all right so now the true evidence now receiving now so the Holy Ghost positioned him this is my beloved Son here the voice did not say this has become my son Jesus was the son the Holy Ghost positioned him as that son before them all then having been filled thus and the same pattern hold at Pentecost and Ever Ever After he went and demonstrated power receiving the full revelation of God and from God for that day amen now he completes the work amen what he fulfilled Jesus said and now he continues to fulfill through his bride amen all right amen amen hallelujah am now so we we are coming to a conclusion the Eternal logos God was manifested in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily so where you amen and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh amen amen who's the Eternal one the real gift that's right amen amen that birth word is the Eternal one I'm talking about in here that's Eternal you are that birth word amen and who are you himself yes in bright form amen all right now so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God amen amen the real you he said in in the things that are to be he said the real you is the spirit of God in you amen the real you is the spirit of God in you amen the real gift or I should say the real believer is the faith of God in you amen moving in you amen yes there's your real gift amen amen amen now so the real you is the spirit of God in you for you are the word living and in action you are his victory amen this is the victory sir that overcometh the world Amen even our faith amen praise the Lord who faith God Is My Rock you remember what brother Bram said speaking of Psalm 62 what The Rock is Rock means Revelation is that
