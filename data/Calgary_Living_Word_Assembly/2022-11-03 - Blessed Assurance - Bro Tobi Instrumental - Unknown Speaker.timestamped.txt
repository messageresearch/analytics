[0:06] first of all I want to say thank you for
[0:09] everyone that was praying for me when I
[0:11] had a pinched nerve
[0:14] um
[0:16] you know it was a real painful process
[0:17] and and the Lord healed me
[0:21] and uh
[0:23] just this week this past week
[0:26] I started to feel real bad pains again
[0:29] and I kept confessing that the Lord has
[0:32] healed me
[0:33] and uh I said to the Lord just couple
[0:35] days ago because I actually couldn't go
[0:37] to work on Friday I had to go to
[0:39] emergency
[0:40] um because I had a real terrible night I
[0:44] said to the Lord if you give me the
[0:45] strength I'll be here
[0:46] this morning to
[0:48] give a testimony in a song and with a
[0:52] pain in the back it's hard to play my
[0:54] horn
[0:55] and yesterday I was practicing a it was
[0:58] really painful I
[0:59] laid on the floor in pain and I said
[1:02] Satan I'm coming here too
[1:05] do especially anyway
[1:08] and and this special will be a shame on
[1:10] the devil special
[1:12] so the song is Blessed assurance Jesus
[1:15] Is Mine regardless of what happens Jesus
[1:19] is ours may you be blessed
