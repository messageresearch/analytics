[15:25] testimony is a testimony is a
[15:27] Thanksgiving I had this friend of mine
[15:30] and a colleague so she told me I had
[15:33] that she will be going for a surgery on
[15:35] November 1 year that I will be with her
[15:39] so I cancelled my shift so I was with
[15:42] her at sou campus the sge was
[15:45] successful so when we came back to her
[15:48] house in the night at midnight Friday uh
[15:52] Thursday Friday night there was a
[15:55] complication was so
[15:57] serious meanwhile I prayed to God I said
[16:00] God I don't know why this a friend or a
[16:02] colleague asked me to come and stay with
[16:05] her but you know but we sh with God may
[16:09] you take control and help her to come
[16:11] out from this surgery it's not a small
[16:13] surgery
[16:14] so I called the ambulance that night
[16:18] from her house that was around 2: a.m.
[16:22] so they came we took her back to a
[16:26] hospital so I was there till
[16:29] Friday morning I came back she wasn't
[16:33] she didn't even know where she was but
[16:36] when she woke up she told me what to
[16:38] bring for her for her I went back to her
[16:40] house and before then she gave me two
[16:45] present she said she never know that
[16:47] this is my Christmas
[16:49] present so that morning that Friday
[16:52] morning my P I put it in that bag she

[16:58] things I was carrying back to the
[17:00] hospital when I was entering the
[17:02] elevator maybe it was it dropped I
[17:05] didn't see it and the throughout the
[17:07] Friday I didn't have any cost to look
[17:09] for my P or buy anything I now remember
[17:13] that I have I have promised God that
[17:15] this Sunday I'm going to give a test uh
[17:18] a Thanksgiving I didn't prepare anything
[17:21] so I was looking for my post I went back
[17:23] to the hospital I asked she said I
