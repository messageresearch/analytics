[46:15] but we know that your word is Eternal
[46:18] Father
[46:19] and that all heavens and earth will pass
[46:21] away
[46:23] and father many times we look for
[46:25] tremendous miracles in our lives and
[46:27] signs and wonders
[46:28] but Lord we know that you you said to us
[46:31] through your Prophet that the greatest
[46:32] Miracle is that a man father could
[46:35] recognize his sinful nature Lord and
[46:38] just commit his life into your hands and
[46:41] that you could convert that man that you
[46:43] could see that man be transformed by the
[46:45] renewing of his mind according to your
[46:48] word that he could become a new creature
[46:50] in Christ Jesus father help us to
[46:53] remember help us to recognize the
[46:55] greatest Miracle ever performed Lord

[46:59] that a man could be transformed into the
[47:02] very image of God
[47:04] Lord we just Commit This service into

[47:08] the reading of the word as we go
[47:10] forwards father we just love you and we
[47:13] thank you we ask all these things in
[47:14] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[47:18] God bless you tonight you may be seated
[47:25] just a couple of announcements for
[47:28] this weekend coming up we have the
[47:29] passion play on Saturday and
[47:32] sure it'll be a wonderful time of
[47:34] fellowship and
[47:36] just enjoying each other's company in
[47:39] Drum Heller
[47:40] um
[47:41] I felt led to ask brother Ben ogu to
[47:44] take the service for us on Sunday
[47:46] I know that his time is short with us
[47:48] although he's been here for a while he's
[47:50] traveling to Edmonton next week and he
[47:53] agreed to take the service on Sunday so
[47:55] we're certainly excited to hear what the
[47:57] Lord has placed on our brother's heart
[48:01] so uh pray for our brother I'm sure
[48:03] they'll put him to work in Edmonton when
[48:06] he goes there as well
[48:08] but so we have the passion play on
[48:10] Saturday and then brother Ben will take
[48:12] the service on Sunday
[48:13] are you happy tonight
[48:15] and believe it or not I'm happy too I
[48:18] just can't help but get emotional when I
[48:20] get in his presence bear with me for one
[48:22] more
[48:29] I uh I'm certainly thankful in my life
[48:31] I'm
[48:33] I would say 99 over this thing that uh
[48:37] attacked me as well
[48:39] certainly wonderful to recognize the the
[48:42] word of the Lord in our lives
[48:45] tonight I want to go back to Matthew
[48:46] chapter 14 and uh
[48:49] and just dwell on this a little bit I
[48:51] think it's real important for us to
[48:53] recognize that when we're going through
[48:55] our circumstances
[48:57] it's uh it's important to remember that
[49:00] he's there with us
[49:02] and and to not look at it from the
[49:04] circumstance where our situations can
[49:07] become even spooky
[49:09] and we know that that's what brother
[49:11] Branham talked about and we'll get into
[49:12] that a little bit but
[49:13] in this story here I think it's amazing
[49:16] I was just studying it again looking at
[49:18] it and thinking you know the disciples
[49:20] they were in the ship but why were they
[49:22] in the ship
[49:24] they were there because Jesus
[49:26] constrained them to get into the ship
[49:29] they had the 5 000 being fed just men
[49:33] not including women and children so we
[49:35] didn't even know how many thousands of
[49:37] people were fed in the story just before
[49:39] this a tremendous campaign and we know
[49:42] there must have been a lot of virtue
[49:44] that went out of Jesus to to have that
[49:47] scenario happen but but all that Mighty
[49:50] sign and wonder that that Mighty service
[49:52] that they had Jesus finally came to the
[49:55] place where he said enough and he
[49:57] constrained the people to go home he
[49:58] said you got to go home the show's over
[50:01] we can't do anything more for you the
[50:03] services are over we had a great meeting
[50:05] uh go home and talk about the special
[50:07] services and study the notes that you
[50:09] took from the weekend and the disciples
[50:11] you too need to go and what did Jesus do
[50:15] he went up to a high mountain apart he
[50:17] sent them into the ship and then he went
[50:20] to pray and I just can't help but wonder
[50:22] what did he go to pray about what was he
[50:25] doing while he was praying there you
[50:27] know who's whose names did he mention
[50:30] when he was praying on that mountain
[50:33] but those disciples were in that boat
[50:35] that started to get tossed around like a
[50:38] bottle stopper brother Brown talks about
[50:39] and and they're in the water and and
[50:42] they're a few furlongs out about an
[50:44] eighth of a mile from Shore is what they
[50:47] say and uh what happened was the ship
[50:50] started to get tossed about the wind
[50:51] started to get contrary with that ship
[50:53] while they were in it and I can only
[50:56] imagine if I was one of those disciples
[50:58] I'd be thinking man here we are in the
[51:00] midst of this ship now in the midst of
[51:02] this storm here and this is what Jesus
[51:05] told us to do
[51:06] he's the one that put us here
[51:09] brothers and sisters how easy can it be
[51:11] for us in our lives to think that
[51:13] sometimes we go through trials and to
[51:16] think that Jesus allows for these trials
[51:18] to happen and you know what I'm going to
[51:20] say that I'm just guilty I'm I'm number
[51:22] one at the front of the line to admit
[51:25] that I am guilty of saying Lord why
[51:28] would you do this to me why do we have
[51:30] to go through these things and I'll just
[51:33] give you the little testimony I was
[51:34] sharing with brother Logan after service
[51:35] on Sunday with the dog when I ran over
[51:38] my dog it sounds like a stupid testimony
[51:40] maybe for those people that don't have
[51:42] pets or don't understand what it means
[51:44] to have a dog and and so we have this
[51:46] dog and I I ran it over with a machine
[51:48] at our house and and I thought I killed
[51:51] it I really did and I'm not saying that
[51:54] I'm I'm I'm glory in in the situation
[51:57] and how terrible it was but it was
[51:59] terrible she was screaming and yelling
[52:01] and I thought that I literally killed
[52:03] her and she finally got to the place
[52:05] where she just went limp and laid down
[52:07] and wasn't making any more noise and she
[52:09] started to close her eyes and I I cried
[52:11] out to God I said Lord why do we have to
[52:13] have these circumstances what is this
[52:18] and then she started to revive a little
[52:20] bit and I thought I better rush to the
[52:21] vet I better just take her to the vet I
[52:23] know it's just going to be thousands of
[52:24] dollars and a big problem and gonna have
[52:26] to tell the family I just killed the dog
[52:28] and now we got all this situation that
[52:30] was so avoidable why am I in this boat
[52:33] is what I was thinking
[52:35] and so here we go down the highway I'm
[52:38] almost to the vet and I started to
[52:40] really just not get angry but frustrated
[52:43] to think why why why why and I'm just
[52:46] trying to be honest here so you
[52:48] understand my perception of this my
[52:50] perspective here I'm not trying to say
[52:52] that anybody else I can only deal with
[52:55] my own circumstances my own experience
[52:57] but it just became so real to me and I
[53:00] had a few days of this why and the vet
[53:03] he started to tell me that you know we
[53:06] can't really see any broken bones
[53:08] we did X-rays and there's not really
[53:10] very many broken bones we can't see any
[53:12] broken bones for that matter
[53:14] and and we do an ultrasound and we can't
[53:16] see any damaged organs
[53:21] and I'm thinking my goodness
[53:24] and he said you know one other thing
[53:26] the thing that I think is surprising he
[53:28] said to me take a look at this and she
[53:30] was in there she had an IV attached to
[53:32] her and she could tell she was groggy
[53:33] she was on drugs it's just a dog I know
[53:36] it's just a stupid dog but you know what
[53:38] one time God used just a stupid possum
[53:40] to actually create a point a situation
[53:43] God deals with us the way that we need
[53:45] to be dealt with brothers and sisters
[53:47] and clearly I needed to be dealt with
[53:48] this way so I go out and I see her
[53:50] sitting on the table and the vet's there
[53:52] and he says you know there's one more
[53:53] thing that you need to know when animals
[53:55] get hit by Vehicles they usually always
[53:57] get chipped teeth or broken teeth he
[53:59] said look at her teeth there's not one
[54:01] damaged tooth in her mouth are you sure
[54:04] she was hit I was doing about 40
[54:06] kilometers an hour and she she got hit
[54:09] you know I was there I saw it and some
[54:12] people might say well you know it
[54:14] couldn't have been that bad right if you
[54:16] would see her at our house now you'd see
[54:17] her wagon her tail people might think
[54:19] that they'll say well it could have
[54:20] really been that bad and you know what I
[54:22] know I was there I witnessed it
[54:24] sometimes we need to talk about these
[54:26] things we need to remember the
[54:28] circumstances that Jesus allows us to go
[54:30] through he tells us constrains us to get
[54:33] in the boat
[54:35] but brothers and sisters I still had
[54:36] this thing in my heart
[54:38] this thing why
[54:41] why why would we do this why why
[54:46] it took until Sunday that was probably
[54:48] about it was Wednesday I remember I
[54:50] texted the deacons and said hey I don't
[54:52] know if I'm going to make it to church
[54:53] tonight
[54:54] I'm not sure if it's going to happen
[54:55] because I'm at the Vets right now with
[54:57] this emergency so I don't know what's
[54:59] going to happen but we were we were uh I
[55:02] went from Wednesday until Sunday and it
[55:05] was Sunday morning on the way to church
[55:09] I was having this why conversation just
[55:12] inside my heart not talking to anybody
[55:14] just it's just there you know how it is
[55:16] when you have a thought and you just
[55:17] can't understand it you can't reconcile
[55:20] it it's just continually there I had
[55:22] this thought and and and on the way to
[55:24] church distinctly remember driving up
[55:26] the road out of Okotoks I this why and
[55:29] and I believe the Lord just said to me
[55:31] very clearly so that I could show you
[55:33] that I'm still with you
[55:36] just be of good cheer
[55:39] it is I and when you're in a situation
[55:42] brothers and sisters you're not there by
[55:44] accident we're not in a situation by
[55:46] accident it's so that he can show us
[55:48] that he's with us
[55:51] but sometimes it can seem spooky to us
[55:54] the situation seems so strange and
[55:57] naturally speaking I was telling brother
[55:59] Logan I'll just say it because it's it
[56:01] just really struck me in the moment I
[56:03] was so sweaty and so clammy in the
[56:05] situation I had a puddle of sweat on the
[56:08] console of my vehicle just from my arm I
[56:11] was like oh it's all wet I must have
[56:12] spilled some water and I never spilled
[56:14] any water I didn't have any water I was
[56:15] just in this fog of mine trying to rush
[56:18] to the vet
[56:20] what a situation
[56:22] but I could look at it now and say thank
[56:24] you Lord
[56:25] but in the moment sometimes it's very
[56:27] difficult and I just want to say tonight
[56:29] brothers and sisters sometimes we can
[56:31] look at a situation and think why but if
[56:34] we can just stop thinking about the why
[56:36] and start remembering the who because if
[56:40] we can remember the who all the rest of
[56:42] it doesn't matter because if we can
[56:44] remember that he is with us in the
[56:47] situation it doesn't matter it will turn
[56:49] out for the good
[56:51] talking about this this testimony thing
[56:54] tonight I I just want to just make a
[56:57] point of of of mentioning another thing
[56:59] that that I experienced in
[57:01] you know
[57:03] sometimes it can seem a little bit weird
[57:05] but testimony services are important
[57:07] they're very important I had another one
[57:10] where I I was in a situation that was a
[57:13] really good one
[57:15] All Things Considered I had uh just
[57:18] changed jobs I moved from one job to
[57:20] another job and I was working for a a
[57:24] man in in his building and I was working
[57:27] all night I was doing an all-night job I
[57:30] needed to work overnight
[57:31] and this is when I was a believer
[57:35] excuse me and I was working in this
[57:36] building and it was an empty building
[57:39] and it was a big building and uh in a
[57:42] sort of a crime kind of an area of the
[57:45] city
[57:46] and as I was working in this building I
[57:48] was listening to the message it was
[57:49] beautiful I could just turn it up loud
[57:51] and I could just you know go from one
[57:53] place to the other place to do my job
[57:55] and and just listen and I I don't know I
[57:58] probably listened to three messages and
[58:00] in between the messages I would pray and
[58:02] while I was praying and and listening I
[58:05] would be singing and I was just having a
[58:07] little Jubilee with the Lord it was
[58:09] incredible and I'd start to get tired
[58:11] and I just thanked the Lord and maybe
[58:13] drink a little more coffee and just keep
[58:15] going and singing and and and worshiping
[58:18] and just having this time and and going
[58:20] back and forth through this building
[58:21] really large building and you know while
[58:24] I was working there something happened
[58:26] really significant something really
[58:29] significant happened I felt a presence
[58:31] come in behind me in this building and
[58:34] and in the moment I got so scared I
[58:38] didn't know what was happening it
[58:39] actually literally made the hair stand
[58:41] up on my head I was I was shocked by the
[58:45] feeling that I was encountering and and
[58:48] so immediately I start to think oh it's
[58:51] a devil oh it's it's a bad thing it's
[58:53] it's terrible and I start to rebuke it
[58:54] in the name of Jesus Christ and oh no oh
[58:58] and you know I took it from that
[59:00] situation it wasn't very long after that
[59:03] the police were at the door
[59:04] they're like you know this area is uh
[59:06] common for crime and and we're not sure
[59:09] who you are and we want to see some ID
[59:11] we just want to check and make sure that
[59:12] you're not actually robbing the place
[59:14] and I said no no I'm just doing a night
[59:15] shift work in here as a carpenter it's
[59:17] you know it's all good but I I again I
[59:21] wondered what was that what was that but
[59:24] I believe the Lord showed me were you
[59:26] not actually worshiping were you not
[59:28] listening were you not calling upon the
[59:30] name of the Lord for hours that night
[59:33] all night long
[59:35] and finally
[59:37] I come to you and you don't even
[59:39] recognize me
[59:41] what a tremendous thing brothers and
[59:43] sisters that's just me and my experience
[59:45] and and something that I encountered in
[59:47] my life I'm not saying that everyone
[59:49] should have that or or maybe someone I
[59:52] don't know whether you understand even
[59:53] what I'm talking about but what I'm
[59:54] saying is we need to be able to
[59:56] recognize his presence when he comes and
[59:59] that should not be uncommon for us we
[1:00:02] should actually be more surprised when
[1:00:03] he's not with us
[1:00:07] but it really made me think you know
[1:00:09] about this scripture here
[1:00:11] you know the ship was in the midst of
[1:00:13] the sea tossed with waves and the wind
[1:00:14] was contrary
[1:00:16] and the Fourth Watch of the night
[1:00:18] between three and six in the morning
[1:00:21] in the wee wee hours of the morning
[1:00:24] it's about the time it happened to me
[1:00:26] I guess that's what makes this kind of
[1:00:27] real to me you know what here we have
[1:00:30] the disciples
[1:00:32] in this boat in the situation in the
[1:00:34] Fourth Watch of the night this is verse
[1:00:35] 25 of Matthew chapter 14. Jesus went
[1:00:39] unto them
[1:00:40] walking on the sea
[1:00:42] so isn't it amazing to think that the
[1:00:44] sea was contrary to their situation in
[1:00:47] that boat that Jesus constrained them to
[1:00:49] get into
[1:00:50] but on the top of that storm Jesus
[1:00:53] walked to them
[1:00:56] in that storm Jesus came to them
[1:01:00] he didn't just come to them on the beach
[1:01:02] where it was all nice and calm he sent
[1:01:04] them out into the boat and then he came
[1:01:06] to them but what happened when he came
[1:01:09] to them verse 26 and when the disciples
[1:01:11] saw him walking on the sea they were
[1:01:15] troubled saying it's a spirit and they
[1:01:17] cried out for fear
[1:01:20] for me when I think about this I think
[1:01:22] wow maybe I'm not so crazy
[1:01:25] you know brother Ed biskel he gives the
[1:01:27] testimony
[1:01:28] um I'm not even sure where they are I
[1:01:29] think they might be on YouTube if
[1:01:31] anybody's interested they're powerful
[1:01:33] testimonies
[1:01:34] about how he interacted with the prophet
[1:01:37] of God but one of the last ones he talks
[1:01:39] about I think it is he explains how he
[1:01:41] was in the front seat of a car with the
[1:01:43] prophet of God and how the angel of the
[1:01:45] Lord came down into the car between them
[1:01:47] and he said the hair on brother
[1:01:49] branham's face it bristled out straight
[1:01:52] he said you just wanted to die when
[1:01:54] you're in that presence because as a man
[1:01:57] you can't hardly stand being in the
[1:01:58] presence of God when it's that that real
[1:02:01] that powerful but it's it's frightening
[1:02:04] if we're not used to it and I think that
[1:02:06] brother Bradham even said it someone
[1:02:07] could clarify this or correct me I think
[1:02:09] brother brownham said you can never get
[1:02:10] used to it never get used to his
[1:02:13] presence
[1:02:15] because we can't see God in this flesh
[1:02:17] and live
[1:02:18] but when the disciples saw him walking
[1:02:20] on the sea they were troubled saying
[1:02:22] it's a spirit and they cried out for
[1:02:24] fear
[1:02:25] but straightway Jesus spake unto them
[1:02:28] saying be of good cheer it is I be not
[1:02:32] afraid
[1:02:33] if I if I had to stop right here and
[1:02:36] just say this is it for the service
[1:02:37] tonight which I'm not gonna but if I did
[1:02:40] I just would say this brothers and
[1:02:42] sisters be of good cheer
[1:02:45] because the I am is here
[1:02:48] be of good cheer Don't Be Afraid don't
[1:02:51] be afraid of the situation the
[1:02:53] circumstance the problems the issues
[1:02:55] whatever it is don't be afraid because
[1:02:57] he is here
[1:02:59] and we know brother Branham says that
[1:03:00] many times he is here
[1:03:03] he's not coming he is here because
[1:03:05] brother random said it many times also
[1:03:07] if you can't believe the works that I do
[1:03:11] hahaha
[1:03:12] believe oh my oh I'm just going to read
[1:03:16] a quote here
[1:03:18] uh
[1:03:20] uh it's sort of be not afraid 1961-0224
[1:03:30] you know they thought this was spooky
[1:03:31] they thought that the spirit walking on
[1:03:33] the water
[1:03:35] while they were in the storm in the ship
[1:03:38] that Jesus told them to get into
[1:03:40] and the position that they found
[1:03:42] themselves in was exactly where Jesus
[1:03:44] put them isn't it
[1:03:46] paragraph 61 says so he came walking to
[1:03:49] him on the water
[1:03:51] their last hour
[1:03:53] all Hope's gone what happened
[1:03:57] as soon as they seen him
[1:03:59] just the same as they did then they're
[1:04:02] doing today
[1:04:04] as soon as they seen him
[1:04:07] they're doing today just exactly the
[1:04:09] same as they did then
[1:04:11] they're doing today the only thing that
[1:04:14] could help them
[1:04:16] they was afraid of it
[1:04:20] I just want to pause there and think
[1:04:22] about that you know what I can speak
[1:04:24] from my own experience and tell you that
[1:04:26] the only reason why would I be afraid of
[1:04:28] it I can tell you why I'd be afraid of
[1:04:30] it because I might have condemnation in
[1:04:32] my heart
[1:04:34] something that I know that I haven't
[1:04:36] done or something that I know that I've
[1:04:38] done and I shouldn't have
[1:04:40] and I just haven't made that right
[1:04:42] so when I have this situation in my life
[1:04:44] Jesus doesn't go anywhere he's always
[1:04:46] there
[1:04:48] but there's something in us that
[1:04:50] restricts us from actually being able to
[1:04:52] contact him and say wow I don't have to
[1:04:55] be afraid I don't have to actually think
[1:04:58] that this situation is is my last hope
[1:05:03] but why do people get afraid why are
[1:05:05] people scared
[1:05:06] I can tell you I'm I'm super encouraged
[1:05:09] after talking to sister Tina today
[1:05:10] because she said I'm not afraid I you
[1:05:13] know the doctor said to her you can have
[1:05:15] the solution that we've got and and
[1:05:17] that's our solution for you and she said
[1:05:20] well you know there's one more solution
[1:05:21] that I'm waiting for she said those
[1:05:23] words and she said I'm not afraid if if
[1:05:25] God decides to take me home then then
[1:05:28] that's his will for my life and I'm not
[1:05:30] afraid of that
[1:05:31] what a tremendous testimony
[1:05:34] but you know even amongst Believers and
[1:05:36] I would say myself I've been this way
[1:05:37] I've been afraid
[1:05:39] and the only reason that is is because I
[1:05:41] know that I don't have it actually
[1:05:42] sorted out properly there's still
[1:05:44] something maybe lingering there and you
[1:05:46] know brothers and sisters as long as
[1:05:47] there's something there in our lives
[1:05:48] Satan is going to come around and he's
[1:05:51] going to have the ability to harass us
[1:05:53] but remember we said it on Sunday I've
[1:05:56] quoted it many times and I think it's so
[1:05:58] beautiful sometimes we just need to
[1:06:00] refresh on some of the quotes and maybe
[1:06:02] I probably need to refresh on a lot of
[1:06:04] them some people might say I think I
[1:06:06] would say that too but you know it's
[1:06:07] full obedience entitles us to the Token
[1:06:10] right we can say that many times and
[1:06:12] I've said it that way so many times but
[1:06:14] it's not just full obedience brothers
[1:06:15] and sisters because full obedience to
[1:06:17] what full obedience to the entire word
[1:06:21] entitles us to the Token full obedience
[1:06:24] to the full word of God entitles us to
[1:06:26] the Token we can't just say I'm going to
[1:06:28] say full obedience to what William Mary
[1:06:30] and Bradham said because he's a man and
[1:06:32] he said you know what if you can't take
[1:06:33] my word for it take the word of God for
[1:06:35] it
[1:06:37] he was a man and he was fallible
[1:06:38] unfortunately but God wanted it to be
[1:06:41] that way because he said just like John
[1:06:43] the Baptist I must decrease so what so
[1:06:46] that he could increase and the same
[1:06:48] thing has to be in our lives we've got
[1:06:49] to be willing to die out to ourselves so
[1:06:52] that he can increase in our lives
[1:06:56] but he come walking to him on the water
[1:06:58] their last hour all Hope's gone what
[1:07:01] happened as soon as they seen him just
[1:07:04] the same as they did then they're doing
[1:07:05] today the only thing that could help
[1:07:08] them they was afraid of it
[1:07:11] they took it as spooky he's a spirit
[1:07:15] brother Bradham says in the same thing
[1:07:16] today
[1:07:18] why
[1:07:20] I think this is astounding when I read
[1:07:22] this because I know I've experienced it
[1:07:24] and I don't ever want to do that when I
[1:07:26] call upon the name of the Lord I want to
[1:07:28] know that it's him that's coming and you
[1:07:30] know what Satan's not going to come
[1:07:31] around when we're calling on the Lord he
[1:07:34] doesn't want nothing to do with the
[1:07:35] angels of the Lord he doesn't want
[1:07:36] nothing to do with God when we get on
[1:07:39] our knees and we start calling on the
[1:07:40] name of the Lord he's going to come and
[1:07:42] try and mess with our mind he'll try and
[1:07:43] maybe get the kids to yell he'll try and
[1:07:45] cause all this different distractions
[1:07:47] that he can do but you know what he
[1:07:49] doesn't want to come anywhere near us
[1:07:51] he ain't going to have nothing to do
[1:07:52] with us it's only going to be God
[1:07:55] brother Adam goes on to say you Baptist
[1:07:57] you Methodist you Presbyterian Catholic
[1:07:59] you Pentecostals Oneness threeness
[1:08:00] fiveness assemblies Foursquare whatever
[1:08:03] you may be
[1:08:05] I'll pause there too
[1:08:07] because we could say message
[1:08:10] the message doesn't save us
[1:08:12] Christ Jesus saves us but when we
[1:08:15] understand what the message is it's the
[1:08:17] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:08:19] then we understand what we're talking
[1:08:21] about here and what I mean by this
[1:08:25] for fiveness assemblies four square
[1:08:27] whatever you may be you're God's
[1:08:30] children but don't be afraid
[1:08:33] God promised he would do it
[1:08:37] if he could speak tonight
[1:08:40] imagine this this is the prophet of God
[1:08:42] the prophet of God is God's mouthpiece
[1:08:44] and here we have the prophet of God as
[1:08:47] his mouthpiece saying this if God could
[1:08:49] speak tonight I think this is amazing if
[1:08:52] if God could speak tonight he'd say as
[1:08:56] it was then when they were all scared
[1:08:59] well said we've seen a spirit it looks
[1:09:02] spooky there's something strange about
[1:09:04] it said do not fear it is I the same
[1:09:07] yesterday today and forever be not
[1:09:10] afraid it is I
[1:09:14] brother Branham says won't you church
[1:09:16] tonight
[1:09:17] let him in your little bark
[1:09:20] as you're sailing over life solemn Maine
[1:09:23] won't you just open up your heart and
[1:09:26] say Lord Jesus I believe you I'm willing
[1:09:31] I know that scripture
[1:09:33] the man's told me what is the scripture
[1:09:36] I know that the Bible said you're the
[1:09:38] same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:42] I know these things
[1:09:46] I just think it's such an amazing thing
[1:09:48] so beautiful
[1:09:50] Jesus
[1:09:52] told the disciples get in the boat
[1:09:56] knowing full well what was coming
[1:09:59] he wasn't surprised
[1:10:01] God is never surprised
[1:10:04] when he tells us to go a certain
[1:10:05] direction and we go that certain
[1:10:07] direction and then we have the situation
[1:10:09] he's not surprised
[1:10:11] and you know what when we surprise
[1:10:13] ourselves with how we act in the
[1:10:16] circumstances and the situations in our
[1:10:18] lives even though we're surprised and
[1:10:20] sometimes all the people around us are
[1:10:22] surprised he's not surprised
[1:10:25] he's still not surprised we can't
[1:10:27] surprise God we can't shock him with our
[1:10:30] lives it doesn't make an occasion for us
[1:10:33] to sin it doesn't mean that we can
[1:10:36] actually just go off in a in a different
[1:10:38] direction and act a different way than
[1:10:40] what a Believer would would act we don't
[1:10:42] want to make Grace a disgrace we're not
[1:10:44] doing that what I'm trying to do tonight
[1:10:46] brothers and sisters just to speak
[1:10:48] plainly is to encourage our faith to
[1:10:50] recognize the faith lies in the church
[1:10:53] and if we don't preach Faith then faith
[1:10:56] is just going to lie dormant
[1:10:57] we need to recognize that he is the same
[1:11:00] yesterday today and forever not just for
[1:11:02] some church out there somewhere maybe
[1:11:04] some great ministry somewhere but for me
[1:11:06] right now in my situation in my
[1:11:09] circumstances he is the same yesterday
[1:11:10] today and forever he told me to go this
[1:11:13] way and maybe I went a little bit of a
[1:11:15] different way but he knew that I would
[1:11:17] go that way I just was thinking today
[1:11:19] about Jonah you know the world would say
[1:11:21] that Jonah is a backslider he's a
[1:11:23] backslidden prophet but brother Bradham
[1:11:25] he said it very clearly he was not a
[1:11:28] backslider he was in God's will he was
[1:11:30] doing God's will because those people
[1:11:32] would never have received him or his
[1:11:35] word had a fish never spat him up on the
[1:11:37] ocean on the sea from the ocean on the
[1:11:41] beach from the ocean from the sea
[1:11:43] you know what I'm saying
[1:11:46] confusing myself here but you know what
[1:11:48] I mean
[1:11:49] he he he wasn't surprised God wasn't
[1:11:52] surprised by his behavior
[1:11:55] he knew exactly where he was he knew he
[1:11:57] had iniquity in his heart again being in
[1:11:59] a ship that was tossed contrary to the
[1:12:01] to the way it should be with the ship
[1:12:03] and he knew he had iniquity in his heart
[1:12:05] and he said you know what just throw me
[1:12:07] over could you imagine that
[1:12:09] just biting my hands and my feet and
[1:12:10] throw me over because I deserve to die I
[1:12:13] know that I've transgressed the
[1:12:14] direction of God God knew exactly what
[1:12:16] he would do
[1:12:18] and God took him and saved him
[1:12:20] and when he was in that position long
[1:12:22] enough
[1:12:23] he remembered that scripture you know
[1:12:25] what when I'm in the midst of my
[1:12:26] circumstance I'm just going to look I'm
[1:12:28] going to raise my eyes and I'm going to
[1:12:30] look towards the temple of God because
[1:12:32] therein lies my salvation therein lies
[1:12:35] my God that is the way I'm gonna go and
[1:12:37] if I ever have another chance in my life
[1:12:39] I'm just gonna go straight the way that
[1:12:41] God shows me how many times in our lives
[1:12:44] have we encountered that I've gone
[1:12:45] through the circumstance I'm in the
[1:12:47] midst of my trial and I know that I made
[1:12:49] a mistake I know that I'd done wrong but
[1:12:51] I'm just gonna just Lord commit it into
[1:12:53] your hands and if it Be Your Will for me
[1:12:55] to live to see another day I'm just
[1:12:57] going to serve you with all my might and
[1:12:59] all of my heart
[1:13:00] he wants us to get to that place
[1:13:02] brothers and sisters he wants to be able
[1:13:04] to demonstrate that he's God in our
[1:13:06] lives in our moment in our situation he
[1:13:09] doesn't want us to be wondering if he's
[1:13:11] God he wants to show us that I am the
[1:13:14] same yesterday today and forever in your
[1:13:15] life in our lives
[1:13:17] I'm so thankful for that I just have to
[1:13:20] say Thank You Lord you might wonder why
[1:13:22] you're so thanking the lord tonight in
[1:13:24] your prayers because I know that he's in
[1:13:25] control brothers and sisters I look at
[1:13:28] sister Tina's condition tonight and I
[1:13:30] think my goodness the doctors want to
[1:13:32] tell her you've got this device now
[1:13:34] you're going to have to put this device
[1:13:36] on and wear it like a pack everywhere
[1:13:38] you go now and that's their only
[1:13:39] solution but here we have a sister
[1:13:41] saying hey you know what I know that
[1:13:43] God's my healer and I'm willing to die
[1:13:44] believing that he's my healer because
[1:13:46] I'm not afraid I know that if I die I'm
[1:13:49] going to be with God because I'm not
[1:13:51] going to die you can never kill me as a
[1:13:54] Believer I think we need to have that
[1:13:55] resolve
[1:13:57] when that happens you know what happens
[1:13:58] you know what happens Satan's powerless
[1:14:01] before you
[1:14:02] it's not just a revelation it's not just
[1:14:04] understanding the seals it's not just
[1:14:06] understanding that God sent a prophet
[1:14:08] that that that that that the Gates of
[1:14:10] Hell won't be able to Prevail against us
[1:14:12] it's not understanding that Revelation
[1:14:14] although that Revelation is what will
[1:14:16] release us from this Human Condition
[1:14:18] into the heavenlies
[1:14:20] but it's not understanding the theories
[1:14:22] it's coming as a little child it's just
[1:14:25] accepting his word and saying hey I
[1:14:26] believe that and I'm willing to accept
[1:14:27] it the way that you've given it to us
[1:14:29] and I'm not going to put any theology on
[1:14:31] I'm not going to put any any ideas and
[1:14:33] and traditions or cultures or anything
[1:14:36] on it I'm just going to say be it unto
[1:14:37] me according to Thy Word
[1:14:41] I love how brother Branham says it
[1:14:42] that's why I'm talking this way it's
[1:14:44] because of what he said he said don't
[1:14:46] try to figure it out
[1:14:48] don't don't try to understand it
[1:14:50] says you tell your little girl
[1:14:53] you're going to get her something
[1:14:56] she just believes it that's all
[1:14:59] and I think it's beautiful how he brings
[1:15:02] this to his campaign to to The Healing
[1:15:05] Ministry the the present moment in his
[1:15:07] life he says your children just believes
[1:15:10] it when you say you're going to get them
[1:15:11] something he says that's all
[1:15:13] watch children when they get to the
[1:15:15] pulpit not to preach but in the prayer
[1:15:18] line watch children when they get to the
[1:15:20] pulpit watch and see if every one of
[1:15:23] them isn't healed
[1:15:25] because they just believe it that's all
[1:15:31] watch them when they're called on the
[1:15:33] platform out there no matter what's
[1:15:36] wrong with them
[1:15:38] when they're called out there watch them
[1:15:40] jump to their feet no matter if they're
[1:15:42] crippled blind whatever it is
[1:15:46] watch them receive it right now
[1:15:50] but the elderly ones
[1:15:52] will set around and say now wait I can't
[1:15:55] move
[1:15:57] I haven't moved this foot for a long
[1:15:58] time
[1:16:00] a child won't think of that
[1:16:02] he will just jump to his feet right now
[1:16:07] I say Lord help me to jump to my feet
[1:16:09] right now
[1:16:11] because I've got things in my life aches
[1:16:13] and pains I brought up to the prayer
[1:16:15] meetings specific requests there's
[1:16:18] things in my life that I I really would
[1:16:19] like to see the Lord move on and maybe
[1:16:21] that's what I need to do maybe I just
[1:16:23] need to jump to my feet right now and
[1:16:24] say just just amen Lord be it unto me
[1:16:27] I'm either going to damage myself
[1:16:28] further or you're going to heal my body
[1:16:30] and I trust that you'll heal my body
[1:16:33] and you know I don't want to push us
[1:16:34] that way either because we can make
[1:16:35] Grace a disgrace we can tell people to
[1:16:37] go and do things that are contrary to
[1:16:39] just common sense don't do that
[1:16:43] don't do that
[1:16:45] just me speaking here but we've got to
[1:16:48] live by faith brothers and sisters
[1:16:51] faith in a word that was delivered to us
[1:16:53] for a purpose the purpose of it brothers
[1:16:55] and sisters isn't so that we can have a
[1:16:57] good fellowship and and live together in
[1:17:00] harmony and and have a wonderful Church
[1:17:02] body that can help one another when
[1:17:04] we're down and and so on and so forth
[1:17:07] that's not it we're we're given this
[1:17:09] perfect word and we're given a perfect
[1:17:11] Faith to to marry with that perfect word
[1:17:13] as husband and wife so that that perfect
[1:17:15] word will give us that perfect Faith
[1:17:18] which will in turn be called rapturing
[1:17:20] Faith which will absolutely change these
[1:17:22] bodies in the moment in a twinkling of
[1:17:24] an eye that's the promise for our age
[1:17:26] and we do have that promise it's coming
[1:17:29] it's imminent we can see it all around
[1:17:31] us this world is seemingly fall apart
[1:17:33] falling apart but remember like we said
[1:17:35] on Sunday I just want to say it again
[1:17:36] you know what it's not that world that's
[1:17:39] putting the pressure on the bride and
[1:17:40] going to squeeze the bride out of here
[1:17:42] it's the bride's presence that's putting
[1:17:43] the squeeze on this world it truly is
[1:17:46] the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:17:48] his bride that's causing all the rest of
[1:17:50] this fanaticism to take place and one of
[1:17:52] these days grace is going to lift off of
[1:17:55] this world the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:17:57] will no longer be here and we're not
[1:17:59] going to want to be here when that time
[1:18:00] comes and we won't be by the grace of
[1:18:02] God
[1:18:03] Brother Brad I'm talking about the child
[1:18:05] here he says he will do but we try to
[1:18:08] figure it all out
[1:18:09] we got to figure it out
[1:18:13] getting into our story now
[1:18:15] going a little bit further
[1:18:17] one of the other parts of it maybe we
[1:18:20] can just read read in the Bible here
[1:18:25] just carrying on from
[1:18:28] verse 27.
[1:18:31] before we go any further with this quote
[1:18:36] it's notable what happened in this
[1:18:38] situation verse 28 of Matthew chapter
[1:18:42] 14.
[1:18:45] and Peter answered him
[1:18:49] and said Lord
[1:18:51] if it be thou
[1:18:54] bid me to come unto thee on the water
[1:19:00] and what did Jesus say he didn't say oh
[1:19:02] no
[1:19:04] you can't do it only I can
[1:19:08] or nope
[1:19:09] only the
[1:19:11] Bishop can
[1:19:13] only the ministry
[1:19:16] maybe just the deacons or the evangelist
[1:19:22] no
[1:19:24] and he said come
[1:19:27] and when Peter was come down out of the
[1:19:29] ship he walked on the water
[1:19:32] I just think it's beautiful
[1:19:35] he walked on the water why
[1:19:37] to go to Jesus
[1:19:41] he'll make a way for us brothers and
[1:19:42] sisters
[1:19:45] I think it's so beautiful and I just
[1:19:46] want to pause here and and just labor on
[1:19:49] this point Peter got down out of the
[1:19:52] ship
[1:19:53] and walked on the water
[1:19:55] can you imagine that it wasn't just
[1:19:57] Jesus that was walking on the water it
[1:19:59] was Peter also
[1:20:01] and why because he had faith enough to
[1:20:04] say Lord if it's you then bid me to come
[1:20:06] allow me to come unto you and I just
[1:20:09] want to say this tonight brothers and
[1:20:10] sisters remember that water wasn't
[1:20:12] actually smooth glass
[1:20:15] it wasn't perfect water this was stormy
[1:20:17] water
[1:20:19] but yet he walked on it which means that
[1:20:21] he was above it remember when the enemy
[1:20:24] comes in like a flood brothers and
[1:20:25] sisters the spirit of God raises a Peter
[1:20:28] above it and I want to encourage us
[1:20:31] tonight when the spirit of God when this
[1:20:33] sorry when the spirit of the enemy comes
[1:20:35] in like a flood the spirit of God raises
[1:20:38] a standard against it and and here we
[1:20:40] have the situation where Peter now
[1:20:42] caught in the midst of this storm he has
[1:20:44] this desire as he was that was his
[1:20:47] nature to Just Launch out with whatever
[1:20:49] the first thought that came to his mind
[1:20:51] he's just right there right on it and
[1:20:54] and he is saying okay if that's you then
[1:20:56] then then then let me come unto you how
[1:20:59] many of us can say that tonight in the
[1:21:01] midst of our storms brothers and sisters
[1:21:03] when we have that situation in our lives
[1:21:06] and it gets spooky and we don't
[1:21:08] understand what's going on can we just
[1:21:10] say Lord if you're here just let me come
[1:21:12] out to you just let me walk on top of
[1:21:14] this storm don't let me have to sink
[1:21:16] down in it but we know in verse 30 it
[1:21:18] says but when he saw the wind boisterous
[1:21:21] he was afraid
[1:21:23] and he beginning and beginning to sink
[1:21:25] he cried saying Lord save me
[1:21:28] and immediately Jesus stretched forth
[1:21:30] his hand and caught him and said unto
[1:21:32] him oh thou of little faith
[1:21:35] wherefore did thou doubt
[1:21:38] Jesus was right there
[1:21:41] he could see him right there he already
[1:21:44] identified that that was him right there
[1:21:46] he was already climbed down out of the
[1:21:48] ship right there he was already walking
[1:21:50] on the water right there
[1:21:53] but yet what did he do
[1:21:55] he looked at his circumstances
[1:21:58] he looked at the wind
[1:22:00] he looked at the waves
[1:22:02] maybe he looked back at the disciples
[1:22:04] maybe he looked and saw the fear on his
[1:22:06] brother's faces
[1:22:08] in the midst of the situation instead of
[1:22:10] staying where he was walking on the
[1:22:13] water
[1:22:15] fear took over him and he began to sink
[1:22:18] and I just can't help but think tonight
[1:22:20] brothers and sisters we have been called
[1:22:22] not to sink
[1:22:24] we've been called not to cry out to
[1:22:26] Jesus because we're of little faith and
[1:22:28] we're going under and we're just barely
[1:22:30] making it I think that's the position of
[1:22:32] maybe the denominational Christian
[1:22:33] that's the position of someone that
[1:22:35] hasn't really recognized the true
[1:22:37] presence of Jesus Christ the same
[1:22:39] yesterday today and forever according to
[1:22:40] the message of the hour someone who
[1:22:42] truly recognized that he has forgiven me
[1:22:45] and I have been able to just accept his
[1:22:48] forgiveness brothers and sisters we
[1:22:50] don't have to be falling down in the
[1:22:52] water
[1:22:54] and as I'm talking remember I'm
[1:22:56] preaching to me I'm thinking about
[1:22:58] myself driving up the hill I don't have
[1:23:00] to think I'm sinking into this problem
[1:23:02] in this situation and be crying out to
[1:23:04] God why now I can look at the situation
[1:23:07] and say Amen something's happening Jesus
[1:23:10] is here and he's going to keep me above
[1:23:12] this water doesn't matter how wet that
[1:23:14] console is I'm going to be above it
[1:23:16] doesn't matter if my dog dies she's
[1:23:19] gonna be there when I get over there
[1:23:20] doesn't matter what happens if this
[1:23:23] flesh gets destroyed there's a brand new
[1:23:25] body already waiting for me it doesn't
[1:23:27] matter if I'm not present in this flesh
[1:23:29] because I'll be present with God
[1:23:33] brother Adam says he'll do it but we try
[1:23:35] to figure it all out we got to figure it
[1:23:38] out what if Peter stopped that night to
[1:23:40] figure it out
[1:23:41] now Lord you told me to walk on the
[1:23:44] water
[1:23:45] now let me see
[1:23:47] now I'm strictly a scientist
[1:23:51] and I know the formula of water is H2O
[1:23:55] why no man can walk on hydrogen and
[1:23:57] oxygen it's just proven scientifically
[1:23:59] that that's not possible right no man
[1:24:02] can walk on hydrogen and oxidant there's
[1:24:05] no need for me trying that why would I
[1:24:07] try it because it's just not humanly
[1:24:09] possible
[1:24:11] but brothers and sisters remember his
[1:24:13] will is his word and his word says that
[1:24:15] all things are possible to those who
[1:24:17] believe
[1:24:18] not some things and not many things but
[1:24:21] all things are possible to those who
[1:24:23] believe
[1:24:25] why no man can walk on hydrogen and
[1:24:27] oxygen there's no need of me trying that
[1:24:30] how many times you ever hear someone say
[1:24:31] stuff like that as a Believer oh
[1:24:34] there's no need of trying that I don't
[1:24:36] know if I'd do that that's maybe a
[1:24:38] little bit crazy
[1:24:40] you might actually cause a bit of a
[1:24:42] problem if you do that I want to say
[1:24:44] this when we talk about this level of
[1:24:46] Faith brothers and sisters this isn't
[1:24:48] just let's let's just lay hands on you
[1:24:50] and we'll have a prayer meeting and
[1:24:51] things will get better this is truly the
[1:24:53] revelation of Jesus Christ alive and
[1:24:55] well in your life and and until you know
[1:24:58] him that way that you walk with him and
[1:25:01] you talk with him and and you have that
[1:25:03] communion that fellowship with him don't
[1:25:05] try anything fundamental I don't want to
[1:25:07] try and get us to go and walk out in
[1:25:08] front of a bus because we know God will
[1:25:10] save us if this body be destroyed this
[1:25:12] earthy Tabernacle be destroyed we have a
[1:25:14] new body waiting for us no no we don't
[1:25:16] want to we don't want to tempt God we
[1:25:19] don't want to make Grace a disgrace we
[1:25:21] want to recognize that as we live our
[1:25:22] lives according to the word of God as
[1:25:24] Believers in our day when the Devil
[1:25:26] comes around because he's simply a tool
[1:25:28] in the hand of God God's going to say go
[1:25:30] and get this accomplished in my brother
[1:25:31] or my sister's life in my child's life
[1:25:33] just allow it to happen because what's
[1:25:35] going to happen is they're going to do
[1:25:36] exactly what I want them to do because I
[1:25:39] know they've been predestinated from
[1:25:40] before the foundation of the world they
[1:25:42] have my mind already in them their mind
[1:25:44] is already renewed
[1:25:46] and they're going to do exactly what I
[1:25:47] want them to do but sometimes we just
[1:25:49] need a little bit of a push we don't
[1:25:51] want to get fundamental the crazy about
[1:25:53] this we just want to recognize when we
[1:25:55] have that level of Faith brothers and
[1:25:57] sisters when he makes himself that real
[1:25:58] to us we can just say be it unto me
[1:26:00] according to thy will I know the
[1:26:02] situation is for your purpose Lord I
[1:26:04] know you're working it out for a purpose
[1:26:06] and we just want to see your purpose
[1:26:07] come to pass
[1:26:10] I I I'm strictly a scientist he says I
[1:26:12] know the formula of water is H2O why no
[1:26:14] man can walk on hydrogen and oxygen
[1:26:16] there's no need of me trying that well
[1:26:19] you you well you asked me something
[1:26:22] impossible
[1:26:24] then Peter never would have walked on
[1:26:27] the water
[1:26:30] imagine that
[1:26:32] he asked for something impossible
[1:26:35] so I want to say you know I talked about
[1:26:37] Peter being that person who was just a
[1:26:39] quick guide to speak
[1:26:41] imagine if he wasn't quick to speak
[1:26:45] if he maybe was a bit like me and he
[1:26:47] would just take it in and think about
[1:26:48] the situation maybe somebody else would
[1:26:50] have jumped out of the boat and gone and
[1:26:52] actually done that before
[1:26:54] he could have had opportunity to do it
[1:26:57] but God created him to be that way for a
[1:26:59] purpose and he was able to say it Lord
[1:27:01] if that's you then just then me to come
[1:27:03] unto you right sometimes we need to have
[1:27:05] that kind of faith and I would say
[1:27:06] that's childlike Faith wouldn't you
[1:27:08] that's the one that's going to say hey
[1:27:10] you know what I just believe it I'm not
[1:27:12] going to try and figure it out he said
[1:27:13] that he's the same yesterday today for
[1:27:15] everybody his stripes I am healed he
[1:27:17] took those stripes for a purpose we know
[1:27:18] that the first drops of blood that were
[1:27:20] shed they were actually there we know
[1:27:22] that it was in the garden when he laid
[1:27:23] down his will but really it wasn't at
[1:27:25] Calvary when the nails went into him is
[1:27:26] when he took the stripes for our healing
[1:27:29] that's the blood that was shed
[1:27:31] the only thing he know he never figured
[1:27:34] out how it was he just took God at his
[1:27:37] word and went walking on
[1:27:40] I just think it's so beautiful brother
[1:27:41] Branham says that's what we got to do
[1:27:44] don't try to figure it out how God's
[1:27:47] going to do these things
[1:27:49] just accept it and go on
[1:27:53] just accept it and go on
[1:27:57] tonight I just wanted to try and
[1:27:58] encourage our faith brothers and sisters
[1:28:00] that you know we can find ourselves in
[1:28:02] the circumstances and the situations
[1:28:04] with the ships and and the seas and our
[1:28:07] problems and issues and circumstances
[1:28:10] but God knows exactly where we are
[1:28:14] and I can promise you that we didn't get
[1:28:16] to where we are on accident we got to
[1:28:19] where we are so that he can express
[1:28:22] himself to us and through us he wants us
[1:28:26] to walk on that situation he doesn't
[1:28:28] want us to have to tread through it and
[1:28:30] drown in it no way we know that he will
[1:28:33] make a way of Escape through the
[1:28:35] situation for us
[1:28:37] so I want to say tonight brothers and
[1:28:39] sisters what's your need
[1:28:41] what's our need
[1:28:43] what's your Mountain we sing that song
[1:28:46] so many times what's the mountain that
[1:28:48] we have standing in front of us maybe
[1:28:51] it's not even directly in front of us
[1:28:52] it's it's 20 miles down the road but we
[1:28:54] know we've got to go through that
[1:28:56] mountain we've got to get around that
[1:28:57] mountain it's in our way
[1:29:01] I just want to say this tonight hold on
[1:29:05] hold on brothers and sisters just wait
[1:29:08] on the Lord
[1:29:09] because we know that if we wait on the
[1:29:11] Lord we'll renew our strength
[1:29:14] and we need our strength for the journey
[1:29:17] and our strength many times will turn
[1:29:19] into his strength
[1:29:21] we won't even understand it we know that
[1:29:23] the the picture that we have in the back
[1:29:25] there I believe it is when I don't know
[1:29:27] what the story is exactly who wrote it
[1:29:30] but it's the footprints and the sands of
[1:29:31] time isn't it where there's just one set
[1:29:33] of footprints there and the one man goes
[1:29:35] to heaven and he says Lord why didn't
[1:29:37] you help me and he says look there was
[1:29:39] only one set of footprints there and
[1:29:41] that set of footprints was me while I
[1:29:43] carried you didn't you recognize that
[1:29:46] so many times we think that we're doing
[1:29:48] it on our own we're making it happen on
[1:29:50] our own but that's not at all what's
[1:29:51] happening he's one the one that's
[1:29:53] carrying us he's the one that's taken us
[1:29:55] through
[1:29:58] you know
[1:29:59] they that wait upon the Lord
[1:30:03] talking about this
[1:30:05] this uh
[1:30:08] this word weight
[1:30:11] I just have to check something here bear
[1:30:13] with me I really don't like doing that
[1:30:19] um
[1:30:20] yeah it is H 6960
[1:30:24] sometimes I confuse myself and it
[1:30:26] doesn't take very much for that to
[1:30:28] happen but uh you know this this
[1:30:31] scripture they that wait upon the Lord
[1:30:33] this word wait it made me think you know
[1:30:35] sometimes we have many times we have
[1:30:38] circumstances in our lives that just
[1:30:39] never seem to change
[1:30:41] it seems like we've got this trial and
[1:30:43] it just continually continually goes on
[1:30:46] and on and on and Satan comes around and
[1:30:50] tells us you're never going to get over
[1:30:51] it you're never going to get away from
[1:30:53] it you're never going to overcome it and
[1:30:55] you know I believe that you will
[1:30:58] I personally believe you will we don't
[1:31:01] have to actually live in a cage our
[1:31:03] entire lives but you know whether
[1:31:05] Bradham talks about that that
[1:31:07] circumstance of The Crow and how there
[1:31:09] was a farmer that found a crow and he
[1:31:11] had the crow and he tied a string around
[1:31:13] that Crow and he kept that Crow and that
[1:31:15] Crow recognized that he was tied by a
[1:31:17] string and when all his buddies would
[1:31:19] come in and they would feed together and
[1:31:20] he would fellowship with his friends of
[1:31:22] the crows and then something would
[1:31:24] happen in one two and then all of them
[1:31:26] would fly away he'd try and fly away and
[1:31:28] he couldn't get away
[1:31:29] he recognized that he was bound he was
[1:31:32] tied he couldn't get away and we know
[1:31:34] that this situation for this Crow it's
[1:31:37] such a simple story but brothers and
[1:31:40] sisters many times we can find ourselves
[1:31:41] in that circumstance where this Crow had
[1:31:44] his string around his leg but one time
[1:31:46] someone came along and they untied that
[1:31:48] string they were able to get him free
[1:31:50] and he didn't recognize that string was
[1:31:53] tied
[1:31:54] he didn't think that string was loose
[1:31:56] from his leg I mean he he felt like he
[1:31:58] was still tied that was all he knew for
[1:32:00] however long he was in those bonds he
[1:32:03] was in those Fetters he had this problem
[1:32:05] in his life he's stuck but he was truly
[1:32:07] free and you know all he had to do was
[1:32:10] try and flap his wings but he clearly
[1:32:13] came to the place where he gave up
[1:32:14] trying to fly
[1:32:16] and we know that we are eagles of this
[1:32:18] age and and I want to say just like
[1:32:20] brother Bradham said you hear that
[1:32:21] scream brothers and sisters just jump
[1:32:23] I've been thinking about it you know
[1:32:25] many times we have these circumstances
[1:32:27] these situations these problems in our
[1:32:29] lives brother Branham talked about it
[1:32:31] how he had this one thing that he went
[1:32:33] right to the end of his life and he did
[1:32:35] 1965 he talks about it on the wings of a
[1:32:37] snow white dove how he had this enemy
[1:32:40] this thing six inches long this little
[1:32:43] weasel looking thing that always
[1:32:45] badgered him and he tried to get rid of
[1:32:48] it and he could never get rid of it and
[1:32:49] what happened was there was a time there
[1:32:51] was a day appointed of the father where
[1:32:54] he told him clearly your enemy is dead
[1:32:56] and I want to tell you brothers and
[1:32:58] sisters whatever it is that's badgering
[1:33:01] you whatever it is that's holding you
[1:33:02] back whatever it is that thinks it's got
[1:33:04] a grip on your life there's coming a
[1:33:06] time appointed of the father for you and
[1:33:09] for me where we can say our enemy is
[1:33:11] dead and it doesn't have to be the end
[1:33:13] of our Lives all it takes is a full
[1:33:15] surrender her unto the Lord they that
[1:33:18] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:33:21] strength and they're going to mount up
[1:33:23] with wings as the Eagles but age 6960 is
[1:33:27] kava out of the Strong's Concordance
[1:33:29] weight is to bind together perhaps to
[1:33:33] twist that is to collect to expect
[1:33:37] not just hope not just think but to
[1:33:40] expect to gather together to look
[1:33:42] patiently to tarry and to wait I just
[1:33:45] want to say brothers and sisters tarry
[1:33:47] and wait upon the Lord he will renew
[1:33:49] your strength and when he does it you
[1:33:51] will have the ability to Flap your wings
[1:33:54] and the things that used to bind you
[1:33:56] down you will recognize they no longer
[1:33:58] hold you you can break the bonds of
[1:34:00] gravity and fly
[1:34:03] and fly to a place where maybe you've
[1:34:05] never gone before and I think that
[1:34:07] that's entirely possible for us brothers
[1:34:09] and sisters but the only way it's going
[1:34:11] to happen is if we wait upon the Lord
[1:34:12] and sometimes waiting upon the Lord
[1:34:15] isn't maybe the way we think and I just
[1:34:18] want to try and encourage us this way
[1:34:20] this isn't something that we can say I'm
[1:34:23] just going to purpose in my life I'm
[1:34:25] going to have a hunger strike I'm going
[1:34:26] to go and fast and pray and I'm going to
[1:34:28] wait upon the Lord and he's going to
[1:34:29] move
[1:34:30] because when we do that brothers and
[1:34:32] sisters what we're doing is we're trying
[1:34:34] to actually frustrate Grace we're going
[1:34:37] to try and move the hand of God and
[1:34:39] we're not going to move the hand of God
[1:34:40] the only thing that we're going to do is
[1:34:42] get in line with his word
[1:34:44] he wants us to live and be contributing
[1:34:46] members of this Society he wants us to
[1:34:49] live our lives we have to live our lives
[1:34:51] we've got to be a dad if we're a father
[1:34:53] we've got to be a mother if we've had
[1:34:55] children and we're a mom we've got to be
[1:34:57] a husband we've got to be a wife we've
[1:34:59] got to be children if we're in our
[1:35:00] positions we've got to be those people
[1:35:03] I can't just say I'm not going to be a
[1:35:05] dad now I'm going to go and out to the
[1:35:07] backfield and I'm just going to go and
[1:35:08] fast and pray and everyone needs to
[1:35:09] figure out their things and I'll come
[1:35:11] back when I'm ready I don't have that
[1:35:13] luxury and and it wouldn't be right for
[1:35:14] me to do that I still need to provide a
[1:35:17] living for my family
[1:35:19] I still need to be there for my wife I
[1:35:21] still need to be there for the children
[1:35:22] I still need to be here at the pulpit I
[1:35:24] can't just disappear and say I'm just
[1:35:26] going to go and wait upon the Lord no
[1:35:28] that's not what this scripture is saying
[1:35:30] this scripture is saying wait upon the
[1:35:31] Lord in your position
[1:35:34] go to church
[1:35:35] be with your family go to work but trust
[1:35:39] God for a solution in your life and he
[1:35:41] will provide it and do chorus brothers
[1:35:43] and sisters
[1:35:45] I just want to encourage us tonight a
[1:35:47] little bit something else along the way
[1:35:50] just a little bit more about the
[1:35:51] testimony Road
[1:35:53] you know sister Tina she's in the
[1:35:55] hospital
[1:35:56] and uh I think it's just amazing
[1:36:00] I I had created this a little while ago
[1:36:03] for people might have forgotten about it
[1:36:05] and some people might not even know we
[1:36:07] have it I I thought it would be really
[1:36:08] neat to get a testimony book to get a
[1:36:11] book full of testimonies
[1:36:12] not because we're trying to get
[1:36:14] fundamental and we're going to create a
[1:36:16] book of Acts that the the the the world
[1:36:19] will read about us after we're gone I'm
[1:36:21] not going fundamentally crazy like that
[1:36:23] even though we are a little bit but I
[1:36:25] thought it would be really neat to have
[1:36:26] something significant to write
[1:36:27] testimonies in for what God has done in
[1:36:29] our lives
[1:36:31] and I know that initially uh when I did
[1:36:33] it maybe it was just the wrong time or I
[1:36:36] don't know but
[1:36:37] I felt like it wasn't really well
[1:36:39] received so I put it away
[1:36:42] and I almost forgot about it
[1:36:44] and I started thinking about sister Tina
[1:36:46] I went and saw her today and I started
[1:36:47] to really think about her and and I I
[1:36:50] remembered something
[1:36:52] that she's the first one to actually
[1:36:53] give me a testimony to put in this book
[1:36:56] and I thought my goodness
[1:36:58] what a tremendous thing so tonight I
[1:37:01] just want to take a couple minutes and I
[1:37:03] want to read a testimony of sister Tina
[1:37:04] but for those people that don't know
[1:37:06] about this book it's here for us and I
[1:37:08] really want to encourage as many people
[1:37:10] that have testimonies come and write
[1:37:11] your testimony in here what what this
[1:37:13] book is about is encouraging us to
[1:37:15] recognize that you know sometimes we can
[1:37:17] have a testimony service and we hear it
[1:37:19] and maybe we just don't remember it and
[1:37:21] life comes around and forgets we forget
[1:37:23] about things our lives are busy I want
[1:37:26] to encourage us to remember these
[1:37:27] testimonies so I thought it would be
[1:37:29] neat to just have a place that we could
[1:37:30] we could we could write these these
[1:37:32] testimonies in and I I I got brother
[1:37:34] Mervin to write in here for me I had
[1:37:36] some words that I wanted to put in here
[1:37:38] for everyone that reads this just so we
[1:37:40] recognize what this is about and it says
[1:37:41] this book is dedicated to the glory of
[1:37:44] our Lord Jesus Christ period
[1:37:47] it's my intention to encourage the faith
[1:37:49] of each person who reads the acts of the
[1:37:53] holy spirit in these testimonies because
[1:37:55] it's not the acts of Our Lives it's not
[1:37:57] the acts of the ministry it's not the
[1:38:00] acts of the Prophet it's the acts of the
[1:38:02] Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:38:04] it says these are real in account and
[1:38:07] current from our generation
[1:38:09] may God richly bless you
[1:38:12] now I know there's some significant
[1:38:14] testimonies out there I mean real good
[1:38:17] ones
[1:38:18] and I I would be thrilled if people want
[1:38:20] to add to this
[1:38:21] so the first testimony in here is from
[1:38:23] October 2nd 2019.
[1:38:26] God bless you Saints I would like to
[1:38:28] thank the Lord for his healing power
[1:38:31] once again in my life
[1:38:33] before the past week I wake up on
[1:38:36] Wednesday morning with a sore throat I
[1:38:39] went to see the doctor but I was given
[1:38:41] to returning the following day
[1:38:44] but in the night from Wednesday to
[1:38:46] Thursday I could not sleep I was
[1:38:49] coughing a lot and have strong fever
[1:38:53] in the morning I started having seizures
[1:38:57] I stretched myself on the ground so I do
[1:38:59] not fall
[1:39:00] any hour and hurt myself
[1:39:05] I was alone
[1:39:07] and needed help
[1:39:09] I was very weak but in the morning I
[1:39:12] have enough strength
[1:39:14] to walk up and have help call 911
[1:39:19] and ended in the hospital
[1:39:22] I thank you for your prayers God has
[1:39:25] proved again
[1:39:27] his faithfulness to me
[1:39:32] says thank you sister Tina
[1:39:35] when we were talking to her today I said
[1:39:37] how many times
[1:39:39] how many times has God proved himself to
[1:39:41] you how many times you've been in the
[1:39:42] hospital like this and she said seven
[1:39:44] times
[1:39:45] today was the seventh time and I said
[1:39:48] seven is a perfect number sister
[1:39:51] seven is a perfect number
[1:39:56] in 2021
[1:39:59] November actually it was July 11th in
[1:40:03] 2021
[1:40:06] sister Tina this was our very first
[1:40:08] service after kovid sister Tina another
[1:40:10] testimony
[1:40:12] Shalom to all the saints
[1:40:14] thank God for being back among you
[1:40:17] may God bless each of you who have
[1:40:20] expressed your love in one way or
[1:40:22] another
[1:40:23] sister Tina
[1:40:26] I want to say tonight brothers and
[1:40:27] sisters our sister China is sitting in
[1:40:30] the Foothills Hospital
[1:40:31] standing on the word of God
[1:40:34] saying the doctor is trying to give me a
[1:40:36] solution where I can wear a backpack
[1:40:39] it's actually a pack
[1:40:41] with a control thing there's stuff
[1:40:43] inside it and what it does is it will
[1:40:46] control what's going on in her heart
[1:40:48] rate it will pump the electricity to her
[1:40:50] heart and and they'll take the pacemaker
[1:40:52] out of her heart and and she'll have to
[1:40:54] wear this either a backpack a strap just
[1:40:57] like a purse she'll have a purse with
[1:40:59] her wherever she goes or a backpack
[1:41:01] situation this is what the doctors are
[1:41:04] saying and and it's the only solution
[1:41:06] for her and she's there in the hospital
[1:41:07] saying nope don't want it I'm not
[1:41:09] interested I'm interested in the Lord
[1:41:11] Jesus Christ moving in my life
[1:41:14] that's the second testimony from sister
[1:41:16] Tina here we have the third testimony
[1:41:18] from sister Tina
[1:41:20] she's not afraid to give a testimony of
[1:41:22] what the Lord's doing for her in her
[1:41:24] life and I just want to encourage every
[1:41:26] one of us tonight
[1:41:28] to not only have prayer here as we close
[1:41:30] the service for our dear sister
[1:41:33] but to remember her in prayer when we go
[1:41:36] home
[1:41:37] do not forget about her when we pray for
[1:41:39] our food tomorrow for breakfast when we
[1:41:41] have lunch and when we have supper and
[1:41:44] the next day and just trust that the
[1:41:47] Lord's will will be done in Sister
[1:41:48] Tina's life
[1:41:51] maybe I'll call the musicians as I read
[1:41:53] this she says Shalom people of God
[1:41:57] I would like to thank the Lord for this
[1:41:59] opportunity he gives me to be with you
[1:42:01] again today
[1:42:04] I just think it's beautiful
[1:42:07] we can stop right there
[1:42:09] she knows the importance of what it
[1:42:11] means to be in service
[1:42:13] she knows what it means to be able to be
[1:42:15] there because she can understand what it
[1:42:16] means when she wants to be there but
[1:42:18] can't be
[1:42:20] I spend a month and a half in the
[1:42:23] hospital heart failure the diagnosis was
[1:42:27] very bad dramatic
[1:42:29] I was on the verge of death
[1:42:34] but despite the seriousness of the
[1:42:36] situation
[1:42:38] I clung to the promises of God
[1:42:40] brothers and sisters she's doing that
[1:42:42] very thing right now tonight
[1:42:44] the very same scenario
[1:42:48] reminding him
[1:42:50] what he said about me mine a list of
[1:42:54] what God Said was necessary for me
[1:42:58] so that each time when I was in too much
[1:43:01] pain or doubt
[1:43:03] or medical team with his report I had to
[1:43:07] remind God
[1:43:08] what he said
[1:43:10] I say God you said Daddy you said again
[1:43:14] and again
[1:43:17] that way I could hold on
[1:43:20] I would like to thank all of you who
[1:43:23] have prayed for me
[1:43:25] or showed your kindness to me
[1:43:28] even a lovely family here
[1:43:31] send some money to me
[1:43:33] may God richly bless them also sister
[1:43:36] Joy sisters Sharon's mom from Edmonton
[1:43:40] may God bless her
[1:43:42] a nice sister a woman of faith
[1:43:46] she called me to encourage me every day
[1:43:49] and you know she said those words today
[1:43:51] as well
[1:43:52] she's called her to encourage her every
[1:43:54] day now I'm getting better and better
[1:43:57] every day I can say now God you did it
[1:44:00] God bless you all praise the Lord sister
[1:44:03] Tina sorry for the poor English
[1:44:06] another testimony three of them from
[1:44:09] sister Tina
[1:44:10] I just started thinking about it today
[1:44:13] why I know that she's got some written
[1:44:15] testimonies
[1:44:16] what a tremendous thing it is to give
[1:44:19] God the glory maybe stand with me
[1:44:20] tonight as we close
[1:44:24] brothers and sisters I just want to
[1:44:26] encourage us when we're in the storm
[1:44:27] when we're in the boat
[1:44:30] don't be afraid to walk on the water
[1:44:32] don't be afraid to walk on the situation
[1:44:34] just walk forwards walk to Jesus Look
[1:44:38] Away to Jesus don't look at the storm
[1:44:40] don't look at the waves don't look at
[1:44:42] the wind just look away to Jesus because
[1:44:44] he is the one that knew you would be
[1:44:46] right there so he could come to you in
[1:44:49] your situation let's just bow in prayer
[1:44:52] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:44:54] for your goodness to us Lord we thank
[1:44:57] you that you are the same yesterday
[1:44:58] today and forever and even tonight
[1:45:01] father while we have the circumstances
[1:45:03] while we have the situations you want to
[1:45:05] express yourself to us father you want
[1:45:08] to express yourself to us through our
[1:45:10] situations and Lord how would we ever
[1:45:12] know if we didn't have circumstances how
[1:45:15] would we ever know if we didn't have
[1:45:17] situations Lord I've said it so many
[1:45:20] times about Abraham taking his promised
[1:45:23] son Isaac to the top of the mountain and
[1:45:25] the word of God says
[1:45:27] now I know
[1:45:30] that you love me
[1:45:32] but we know father it was only so that
[1:45:34] Abraham could know
[1:45:36] that you love him
[1:45:37] and father I think so many times in our
[1:45:40] lives we have these circumstances we
[1:45:42] have these situations it's not so they
[1:45:44] can destroy us
[1:45:46] so that we can know how much you love us
[1:45:50] and father I pray tonight that you would
[1:45:52] just help us Lord to rise
[1:45:54] on the wings of Faith Lord Jesus to take
[1:45:58] a hold of the promise of this hour that
[1:46:01] you are the same yesterday today and
[1:46:03] forever you're not a dirty old grandpa
[1:46:05] that's just often some other dimension
[1:46:07] busy doing a puzzle somewhere you are
[1:46:10] The Great I Am that created this
[1:46:12] universe you called us before the
[1:46:14] foundation of the world from your very
[1:46:17] side Lord Jesus to be expressed in this
[1:46:19] age to be the ones to be able to say
[1:46:22] Amen to the word for our day
[1:46:24] Lord Jesus we just thank you for that
[1:46:27] Revelation to recognize who we are and
[1:46:30] father we pray that as we go forwards
[1:46:31] Lord in our circumstances in our
[1:46:33] situations that we would just have the
[1:46:35] ability to stand
[1:46:37] father knowing that you're in control
[1:46:40] to not want to sit down and and be
[1:46:42] afraid and ring our hands but Lord Jesus
[1:46:45] to lift our hands to lift those feeble
[1:46:48] hands up to heaven and say praise the
[1:46:50] Lord thank you Father for redeeming me
[1:46:52] thank you for shedding your blood for my
[1:46:54] Redemption Lord oh Father not so that I
[1:46:57] could be saved but so that I could love
[1:46:59] you father Lord Jesus what a tremendous
[1:47:02] thing it is to be able to love you
[1:47:05] father tonight we just want to unite
[1:47:07] together as a body of Believers for our
[1:47:10] dear sister Tina Lord we know that this
[1:47:13] is the seventh time that you've called
[1:47:14] her to this position Lord where she's
[1:47:16] dealing with a physician team that's
[1:47:19] trying to give her a Doctrine Lord
[1:47:21] that's contrary to your word and father
[1:47:23] we know that she is standing upon your
[1:47:26] word Lord she is saying I'm willing to
[1:47:28] stand in the midst of these waves in the
[1:47:30] midst of this storm I'm going to climb
[1:47:31] down under this ship and I don't care if
[1:47:33] I sink I'm going to sink trusting you
[1:47:36] father we pray that you would just Reach
[1:47:38] Out And Touch our dear sister father
[1:47:40] according to her Faith Lord what a
[1:47:43] tremendous thing it is to see a believer
[1:47:45] in this age father oh Lord I pray that I
[1:47:48] would have that kind of faith if I was
[1:47:50] in that situation Lord father we pray
[1:47:52] that you would strengthen and encourage
[1:47:54] sister Tina father we pray that she
[1:47:56] could just be a strength and
[1:47:57] encouragement to her family Lord to her
[1:48:00] daughters Lord to her grandchildren
[1:48:02] father to her entire family Lord that
[1:48:04] they would look to her and say that is a
[1:48:06] true Christian
[1:48:08] father I just pray that Lord tonight you
[1:48:11] would just go with us as we go our
[1:48:13] separate ways
[1:48:14] father that maybe we would just have a
[1:48:16] little bit of encouragement Lord
[1:48:18] maybe we would have a little bit more
[1:48:20] Faith Lord Jesus than we realized we had
[1:48:23] before we came in and father we just
[1:48:26] pray that Lord somehow someway the
[1:48:28] testimonies in our lives would stir up
[1:48:30] to the surface Lord and we would just
[1:48:32] have to express them Father and Lord
[1:48:35] that it would be an encouragement to
[1:48:37] somebody else who might read it father
[1:48:38] Lord that it wouldn't be something that
[1:48:40] we're trying to put on by ourselves Lord
[1:48:43] but Lord we're trying to just remember
[1:48:45] the goodness of you in our lives
[1:48:48] father we just love you and we thank you
[1:48:50] and we pray that you would just continue
[1:48:51] to keep your hand upon each one of us
[1:48:53] father those who are streaming tonight
[1:48:55] father those who are present those who
[1:48:57] maybe aren't doing either father that
[1:48:59] are just busy with their lives maybe
[1:49:01] they're traveling father keep your hand
[1:49:03] upon each one we ask and Lord If It Be
[1:49:05] Your Will for us to gather again on

[1:49:09] we will be careful to give you all the
[1:49:12] praise and all the glory father we just
[1:49:14] pray that even right now you would Grant
[1:49:16] a fresh coal off the altar oh Father and
[1:49:19] place it upon our brother's lips Lord
[1:49:21] that you would just allow brother Ben to
[1:49:23] just get out of the way and allow you to
[1:49:25] minister to the very needs in our midst
[1:49:27] father and we'll be careful to say Amen
[1:49:30] to that word father Lord how we love you
