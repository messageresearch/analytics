Stella, if I could ask you to come with your your special first to be unveil. God bless you, church. Okay, I just want to thank God for your prayers. The period I was sick, everybody in my house back home was sick. I never knew but God's mercy and grace was upon us. And I thank God and I just want to encourage us. This God we are worshiping, he never fails. He comes anytime you call him. &gt;&gt; Just be sure and call him with your sincere heart. &gt;&gt; He will always be there for you. &gt;&gt; I just want to use this song to say thank you. I know I'm I'm not but his mercies is always upon me. &gt;&gt; It pays to serve Jesus. I speak from my heart is always sorry. I'm sorry. It best to serve Jesus. I speak from my heart. He's always we was if we do our part. There's nothing in this wide world that pleasure can afford. Yes, please and contentment in serving the Lord. [Music] I love him for better than in days of you. I serve him more truly than ever before. I do as he beats me. Whatever the cost, I'll be a true soldier. I die at my post and off when I'm tempted and turn from my sto I take myself. Sorry. I'm sorry. And off and I'm tempted. I will turn from the track. I think of my savior. My man wonders back to the place where there now him on Calary Street. I hear a voice saying I suffered for thee. I love far better than in days of you. I serve you more truly than ever before. I do as he beats me. Whatever the cost, I'll be a true soldier and I at my post. A place I was set free. It was where I found It was life pardon and heaven to me that Jesus was sweetly to my weary. My sins were forgiving. He made my heart. [Music] I love him far better than in days of you. I serve him more truly than ever before. I do as he beats me was ever the cost. I'll be a true soldier and I at my post. How rich is a blessing the world cannot give. I'm satisfied fully for Jesus to live. No friends may forsake me and friends and trials arise. I'm trusting in Jesus. His love never does. I love him forever. And in days of you I serve him more truly than ever before. I do as he beats me was ever the cost. I'll be a true soldier and I at my post. There's no one like Jesus can shame me today. His love and his kindness can never fade away. In winter, in summer, in sunshine and rain. His love and affection are always the same. I love him better than in days of you. I serve him more truly than ever before. I do as he beats me was ever the cost. I be a true soldier and die at my post. [Music] Will you have these blessings that Jesus bestows our freeful salvation from sin at times? Oh come to the savior to calary flee. The fountain is open is flowing for thee. [Music] I love him far better than in days of I serve him much truly than ever before. I do as he be was ever the cost. I'll be a true soldier and I at my post. God bless you church. Please don't mind me. [Applause] Mario, if I could ask you to come up right away. [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I'm going to sing this song today as it as it expresses the current situation that I am in. I will like a few weeks ago. I would say perhaps a month I would say. I was driving when I received a call that my loving father passed away. I was driving and all of a sudden I stopped the vehicle and experienced the quietness of this news and I know I gave this testimony that I heard a voice says he was he will be dead at 96 years old. I am not here to preserve a lie that it that was told by the devil. And I know that the prophet say if it if it doesn't happen the way that you told that you've been told it would happen, it is not the voice of God. &gt;&gt; So uh amid all the tribulations, persecutions, hardships of life, there are many voices that talks But once we are in the body of Christ, we must be able to determine which is the voice of Christ. And then we will be able to know that voice if it if it happened exactly the way that God told us it will happen. Otherwise, it's not the voice of Christ. And then the prophet says if there is someone that is a problem that is me it's not Christ. Sometime we listen to many voice but it is our own voice that is the problem. So my apologies if I told that but I believe I'm speaking to people that are matured in the in the body of Christ. You will understand that. So does Jesus care? &gt;&gt; Yes he does. Does Gus care When my heart is pained too deeply for mirth and song. When the bird then press and the cares the distress and the way grow was weary and long. [Music] Oh yes, he cares. And I know he cares. His heart is touched with my grief. When the days so weary the long night we know that my savior cares. [Music] Thus Jesus scared when my way is dark with a name less dread and fear. [Music] As the day lights fade [Music] into deep night shades, does he care enough to be paid? Oh yes, he cares. And I know he cares. His heart is touched with my grief. [Music] When the days so weary, the lone night dreary, and I know that my savior cares. Does Jesus care? &gt;&gt; When I've tried and failed to resist some temptation strong when my dear face is grief, there is no relief. Though my tears flows all the night long. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he cares. And I know he cares cuz he touched his heart. He's touched with my grief. [Music] Oh, when the days are weary, the long night we know that my savior he cares. Does Jesus care when I've said goodbye to one of the dearest to me in my s hearted till it's nearly breaks. Is it odd to him? Does he see? [Music] Oh yes, he cares. And I know he cares. His heart is touched with my grief. [Music] When the days so weary, the long night we know that my savior cares. [Music] [Applause] Amen. If you all please stand with me as we change the order of the service. [Music] Oh, we sing praises to your name. Oh Lord, praise us to your name. Oh, for your name and bring me to sing praise to your name. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] We give glory to God. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] worship. He deserves it. [Music] [Applause] We sing praises. We sing praises to your name. [Music] Oh, [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] heat, heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] and greatly [Applause] praise. [Music] Amen. God bless you this morning. Welcome to the house of the Lord once again. It's an honor and a privilege to gather together in his name, the name above every name. &gt;&gt; Certainly thankful to be back. It's sure good to get away and have a break. Certainly thank everyone who helped make that possible. I know it can be a real inconvenience, but I believe something happened and we had a wonderful time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just have a few requests this morning that we'd like to bring before the throne. And before we do that, we actually have a praise report. It's from Brother Jose and Sister Becky. It's a praise report. We want to give all the glory to God for his faithfulness, traveling mercies granted to my mother Emily. The Lord went before her and made every path smooth and guiding her journey with peace and grace. &gt;&gt; They say we also thank the church for your prayers. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to give the Lord the glory. We have a request this morning from sister kindness says please saints pray with me for a situation in my home church back home and my understanding is that this happened about eight or nine hours ago. Please saints pray with me a situation in my home church back home that God will arrest the armed men who took some of our members while traveling and bring them back home safely. &gt;&gt; So some people were kidnapped and uh I asked how many and I think seven or eight people. They went to a funeral and were traveling back home. They were on their way back and armed men just kidnapped them. She says, "Praying that God will intervene at this time and they will be returned and released. I know he is much more than able." God bless you. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to stand with sister kindness this morning and remember those folks who are in great distress this morning, our time, probably evening their time. Another request from brother Emanuel Lobe says, "I'm asking for prayers for my mother, Sister Mary Loe, who has been suffering from a cough and chest pain for over a month. All the medical tests she has done have come back negative and the doctors no longer know what to do. I'm counting on divine intervention." &gt;&gt; And you know, that's exactly the place where God specializes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'd also like to remember brother Jerry Carpenter who's been having a bout of bleeding noses. If you just have a request this morning that you would like to remember, maybe make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him with these requests. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for your goodness and your tender mercies once again, Father, for us to gather together, to have the privilege, Lord, to gather together in your name. Lord Jesus, we know that there is no other provided place of worship on this earth than in you. And Father, we recognize that and we thank you for that, Lord. That place that you carved out in this world of darkness, Lord. We know that you showed that it would be completely black if not for a little tiny sliver of light here in the end. And we know that light is you, Father. And we just make a a way for you, Father. All hail King Jesus this morning. Heavenly Father, we don't count it lightly to gather together this way. We don't know how many more times &gt;&gt; we'll be able to. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; But while we can, Father, we give you praise. &gt;&gt; We give you glory and honor, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you for your goodness to us, Lord. We don't say it in vain, Lord. We know that you are the author and the finisher of our faith, Lord. Let alone all of the things that you provide for us in our lives. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just thank you for the needs in our lives. &gt;&gt; We just commit each need made known unto you today by the way of an uplift hand. Father, that you would sovereignly intervene in those needs. &gt;&gt; That you would meet the need, Lord Jesus, according to your will. We pray for brother Jerry Carpenter, Lord, that you would help them. Help him with the bleeding noses, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're a faithful light shining in the past. We pray that you would just bless them abundantly. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to remember, oh, Father, Brother Emanuel's mom. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; She needs a touch from you, Father. We stand together united as a body to give you praise. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just want to oh father remember the request made known unto you today unto us Lord by sister kindness father of those people who were kidnapped. &gt;&gt; Lord we know that this world is not our home. We are just pilgrims passing through Father. And Lord Jesus, I I can't remember who it was or or where the testimony was, but we know that a very similar situation happened just exactly like this. And you came on the scene and you delivered those people who were held captives. And we know that's exactly according to your word. You said that yourself when you were on the mount preaching, Lord Jesus, that you would leave deliver the captives, Father, that you would set them free. So Lord Jesus, we stand united together in the name of Jesus and commit each life into your hands that you would deliver them in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Father, we pray for the captives, Lord, that maybe through this experience that they would be able to, Lord, maybe not just be arrested, but come to know you and the power of your resurrection, Lord, that they would recognize that these people that they've kidnapped are not ordinary people. These are different people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we know that Satan has no power, but what you allow him. And whatever you allow him is for our good. &gt;&gt; Even if it doesn't look good from our natural senses, we know that something is happening. And Father, we just commit this need into your hand. And we'll be careful to bring you a praise report, Lord, when we hear it. Father, we just want to thank you for Lord your provision for Sister Michelle and brother Aiden's friends in the Netherlands. Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, we know that you are a God of miracles. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, if you would provide a home for people who can't afford it, who maybe outside of a miracle wouldn't be able to have it. Lord Jesus, how much more would you deliver the captives? Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we're so thankful that we know you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just that we know of you, Father, but that we truly know you personally, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, you know my heart. My desire this morning is that if anybody doesn't know you this morning in the power of your resurrection, oh Father, that by the time we're done, that something will happen in their lives. Father, whether we're streaming or whether they watch this later or present right now in this building, Father, you're not bound by time or space. And we just give you the glory. We give you the liberty, Father. We welcome you with a kiss. Oh, Father, we anoint your head with oil. &gt;&gt; And what an honor to wash your feet, Lord. &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you. &gt;&gt; We just want to commit these needs into your hands, Father, for your glory now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, musicians. Just can it can't get in his presence and not get emotional. &gt;&gt; Certainly wonderful. &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles this morning, I have a scripture the Lord put on my heart. Just so thankful for the leadership of the Lord. Sorry. In Philippians chapter 3, &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 3. Start reading with verse 9. Philippians 3:9. Just love this scripture, don't you? And being found in him. I believe we could just preach a a series on that right there. One sentence, being found in him, &gt;&gt; and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. by the righteousness which is of God by faith &gt;&gt; that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death. If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead, not as though I had already attained, either were already per perfect, but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before. I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore as many as be perfect. And remember that word perfect is not something that we do. It's not us pressing our clothes or shining our wheels or keeping our house. It's not that. It's maturity. Amen. &gt;&gt; As many of us, let us therefore, as many as be perfect or mature, be thus minded. And if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer one more time. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful for your word, Lord. We're so thankful for your leadership and your guidance, Lord Jesus. The provision that you've given us, Lord, in the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, the revealed word. It's one thing to to be able to know the word, to speak the word, and to read the word, but it's an entirely different thing to have it revealed to us. &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask that one more time you would take this word that's spoken today and turn back the pages, Father, and reveal it to us. Help us to see what is written in between the lines. Lord Jesus, Father, we love you and we thank you. We just commit this word into your hands now for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be seated. Um, excuse me one second. Sorry about that. I just uh certainly excited to be here today. Glad to be back and uh we had just an absolutely wonderful time while we were away. &gt;&gt; Uh just a few announcements before we get going. And uh I think it's it's just important to start out and uh have a little bit of a beginning to the service. You know, uh we've got a prayer meeting coming up on October the 9th at 7:30. If you can make it, it's always a wonderful time. We know the Lord has answered many prayers through those prayer meetings. We have the youth lunch and uh gathering will be at uh youth activity will be at our house on the 19th and uh we'll be hosting that. We have a communion service coming up at 5:30 on the 26th and we haven't had a communion service for quite some time. I'm certainly excited about that. And uh on the 31st we have a youth service here in the sanctuary. And uh for those people who are in the know, we had a youth service here on the 26th of September. And it was just a tremendous time of gathering. And uh you know, we had a little bit of an exhortation. I took it and explained the purpose behind it, what we really are after with it. And I know because it's something new and different, some people get nervous and think, "What are we doing? This is out of order. It's not what we normally do." You know what? It's it's it's good to get a little bit out of order once in a while. I'm not saying that it's out of order, but it's different. It's something new and I say exciting. And you know why I say that is I've heard from multiple of the youth they're asking for more. Not just once a month, but twice a month. And I said, "That's that's great. I love the enthusiasm with it, but what I would like to do is just walk before we run. &gt;&gt; Let's see if we can start doing some regular monthly meetings first. And then you know what? If it is a hit, if we do keep going with it, then I'm all all in. I'll support it. We could have one every single week if the parents want to get behind it. But it's a lot of effort to actually get home from work, get changed, get across the city with your children to actually be involved in something. So, I want to be careful. I want to I want to be respectful of everyone's time, but I want to try and carve out a little bit of a space where we can begin cultivating the youth to be able to play music in the church and to be able to manifest the gifts that are already there. The gifts are already there. It's just up to us to try and discover them. We know that the the word says that gifts and callings are without repentance. They come from God. They're not ours. We don't impart a gift into a person. So, anyways, that's what that's about. The youth services 7:30 on the 31st. We've got uh lots of time to plan for it. I'm hoping that we won't have parents out trick-or-treating with their children and participating in the worldly pleasures because that's truly what it is. Halloween is of the devil, &gt;&gt; I don't think we need to say that from the pulpit. &gt;&gt; But if we're taking and implementing our children into worldly Halloween things, brothers and sisters, where are we at? &gt;&gt; We believe this message, don't we? Amen. &gt;&gt; I would say this. Do you think Brother Brandon would take his kids trick-or-treating? &gt;&gt; If he would, I doubt he would. So, if he wouldn't, why would we? It's not legalism. I'm just saying we we don't need to uh give any any glory to the devil. He's got enough traction in this world. Why would we give him an ounce? &gt;&gt; And I know it's a very difficult thing because the kids love candy and trick-or-treating. We'll buy candy. If you want candy, we'll have candy. &gt;&gt; It's not about candy, is it? &gt;&gt; Because you can go to the store and get candy. It's about getting in the spirit of things. Well, Brother Brandham said we ought to get in the spirit of things here in the church just as exuberantly as they do out there in the world. &gt;&gt; So, why would we want to mess around with worldly things? &gt;&gt; Let's get to church and get after it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Another uh little note here, we have brother Cadre Digs coming in November 22nd and 23rd. will have two services, a Saturday night and a Sunday morning. You know, uh I I got I got a few pictures. I just wanted to just impart a little bit about what happened this last week and what's going on uh in general. But uh if you want to just go with the slides, brother, we'll do the pictures first. This uh picture here is what we did. This is what we went to do. We went up north and uh my brother, he got a wall tent and we set up a bear fence and we had a little kitchen area set up and we just carved out a week of time where we could go and take our time to try and do this. And so we we got up there and the very first day we were able to do this. And so obviously you see Benjamin there and that's his cousin Austin, my older brother's uh youngest. He's the one that killed it. It's his very first bull and uh it's it's a doozy. It's a big one. And I asked him how big is this because I've never seen a moose on the ground and he said he thought it was a pretty good one and uh it is I compared it with some bones from another one and it's probably double the size. So I think in terms of moose it's probably a medium to large Canadian moose like uh Alberta moose anyways. There's some really big ones up north. But so if you want to go to the next one that's uh I shared it on the on the link but just to show you what it's like to get out there. You know, you have the daytime adventure and then the nighttime the Lord just comes by your way. And you know, I just had a little jubilee myself with the Lord. And uh it wasn't a great tremendous prayer meetings. It wasn't anything like that. But what it was was we're able to just simply be together. And you know, my brother and his son were so respectful and and my nephew was there as well, Joey. And you know, every time we had a meal, we just we just said grace. and I just got up and, you know, read my Bible and everyone was just very very respectful with with us there. I I thought it was wonderful. And, you know, as you see the vivid northern lights, I don't know if you've experienced it yourself, if you've ever gone and slept out in the open like that, the the dreams that I had were so vivid, they were just as vivid as the northern lights. And I'm saying all this for a reason because I want to try and encourage the brothers. Um, get your children out. If you can get out in the woods, go rent a cabin, take a tent, uh, find a way, rent an RV, go and do stuff with your your family. It is so important. Uh, we'll get into maybe that later. Um, is there another picture there? That's it for pictures. Yeah, I didn't really want to go too far. Now, uh, I I just thought it was a wonderful time and I I wanted to share a little bit with you. Maybe Lord willing, we'll be able to share a little meat. We don't have uh free rain to all of the meat from this moose because it wasn't our moose. We were just there for the uh adventure. I bought some tags and so did Benjamin, but we never got anything else. It was just a moose and uh you know, people prayed for it and and the Lord really delivered. So, it was a wonderful thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you all. If you want to go to the next slide, I think it's a pretty incredible thing. I don't know if anybody has heard about this. If you haven't, you might want to look it up. You can't really see it there. I apologize. This is called Communion America. Communion America. And it's supposed to start October the 9th and go through to October the 12th. And what they're going to do is have a revival in the US in Washington in the capital of the United States. They're going to have a communion on the last day. It it says 2025 is the time to gather not around celebrity personalities but for a great communion revival centered on Jesus who is alive, well, and moving right now in this generation. He is the dream of a generation. I think that's so amazing uh wording. He's not the dream of a generation, is he? He's a reality of a generation. says, "We're gathering on the National Mall in Washington DC for 4 days, the tw the 9th to the 12th in 50 tents of non-stop worship, one tent for each state with thousands of worshippers, prayer, gospel proclamation, and commissioning every night. On October 11th, we will host a communion table the length of the whole National Mall in Washington DC. It's a festival around the presence of God. They're doing this. It's coming up next week. &gt;&gt; It's tremendous to think about when you know what brother Brandham said in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; But I don't know if we could actually even put it into perspective how far a mile is. They're planning a communion table over a mile long and they're going to come and get together and do all of this. This is the ecumenical move. Can you play the last one, brother? I think there was two of those slides. If not, it's okay. Okay. I apologize. I thought I put two in. That's just fine. I think it's amazing to see that happening. You know, brother Brandham talked about how if you want to see what time it is, just take a look at Israel in terms of God's time piece, we have the ability to see what's going on through the lens of the message. And and I typed it in, a few different hits came up and uh brother Brandham, he says this in what is it? uh in the sixth seal talking about this communion America. They're getting together to celebrate Jesus Christ. They're looking for revival. They're really pushing for it. Brother Brandom says God will close the door one day. He did in the day of Noah and they beat on the door. Brother Brham knocks on the pulpit. Is that right? Now remember the Bible said in that seventh watch, right? Is that right? Some fell asleep in the first watch, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh. But in the seventh watch, there came forth a proclamation, a cry. The bridegroom cometh. And we know, we've talked about this in the past. This is the wise and unwise virgins. They're both virgins. There's five wise. There's five unwise. They're both virgins to the word of God. They both believe in Jesus Christ. They both slumbered and slept, but only one group of them had oil. The other group never had enough oil. Brother Brandham talks about this. The sleeping virgins say, "S say, I'd like to have some of that oil now." The bride said, "I got I just got enough for myself. Just got enough. If you want it, you go pray up." So when we see this in the message and and you see this taking place naturally, they're talking about getting together to pray. They're talking to get together to have a little bit of a revival in the United States of America. But yet we have a prophet that said the revival is over. That revival is done and gone. And what you did was you rejected the living word for your day. &gt;&gt; You rejected the prophetic utterance that God gave. And for that, the only thing that's left is judgment. &gt;&gt; And he said, my brother Brandham didn't say this, even though it was his voice that said it. And people will probably get really bent out of shape if you're watching this. And maybe if you don't believe the message of the hour, but what did he say? I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; How did they do that? They rejected the word that was given through a prophetic utterance. Oh my, he's a great man. He's he's a wonderful man of God. He's got many gifts and talents. But when he began to actually bring the word of God, oh no, we can't take that. No, no, we're not going to go there. That is the rejecting of God. That's not just the rejecting of a a man and his message. The bride said, "I got just enough for myself. Just got enough. If you want it, you go pray it up." &gt;&gt; Don't you see the sleeping virgin? Now look at the Episcopalian, the Presbyterian, the Lutheran, and everything trying to. And the trouble of it is instead of trying to get the Holy Ghost, they're trying to speak in tongues. And a lot of them speak in tongues and is ashamed to come to this church to be prayed for. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wants me to come to their house and pray for them. You call that the Holy Ghost? That's speaking in tongues, but not the Holy Ghost. See? Now, I love how Brother Bradom says this, and this is why I'm going a little further with it. He says, "Now I believe the Holy Ghost speaks in tongues, &gt;&gt; but it's only one gift." &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; of the nine fruit of the spirit. &gt;&gt; It's only one. &gt;&gt; Why would we major on a minor? &gt;&gt; When we have the giver, why would we worry about the gifts? I love how Brother Brandham says it. Why would we want the shoe or why would we want just the tongue when we could have the whole shoe? Now, I believe in the Holy Ghost speaks in tongues. You know, I believe that. See, but there's a counterfeit to it, too. Yes, sir. The fruits of the spirit proves what it is. The fruit of the tree proves what kind of a tree it is. Not the bark, the fruit. &gt;&gt; And how could you say that? Well, you know, I've never heard it before, but you could take Brother Brandham talks about the brother in Arizona that had the lemon tree, right? Yes. &gt;&gt; Was it a lemon tree or an orange tree? &gt;&gt; Orange tree. And he the brother had grafted in lemons and and tangerines and tangelos and and grapefruits. All the different citrus fruits he grafted into the tree. And all of those branches that were grafted in, they live off the life of that original tree. &gt;&gt; Yes, indeed they do. But if they ever bring forth fruit, they're not going to bring forth the orange that that tree is originally. They're only going to bring forth the fruit that's inside of them. And Jesus said, "I am the vine. Ye are the branches." If we are the same as that vine, we will have the same fruit &gt;&gt; as that vine. &gt;&gt; It won't be a lemon on an orange tree. &gt;&gt; It won't be a counterfeit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Today, I want to talk about the power of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I just think it's amazing to look at what's going on around this world, to see all of the things that are going on. It's incredible. We live in an incredible time. You know, Brother Bradom, he says it I I looked at many different quotes and uh if you want to search it out, you'll maybe be able to find it and and see it. Brother Bradom says that right about the time that that unwise virgin goes seeking the oil, which is the Holy Ghost, we know the oil is the Holy Ghost. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we know that &gt;&gt; the oil typifies the Holy Ghost. It's not just a symbol, a symbolic thing that just sounds good in a religious realm. It truly is the literal life of Jesus Christ and the power of his resurrection. And there's two types of that manifestation in this world, especially in in the Christian world. One of them are the people that truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, Jesus Christ himself, living out through their lives. And the other ones live off of the example of those people. &gt;&gt; They live off of the experience of the other people. That's where Brother Emanuel said it when when I was away on Wednesday night. He said, "You could have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of the day and still go to hell. That's how you do it. You come to church and you see the great manifestation, the the presence of God manifesting in our service, but never ever willing to completely let go of all of what we think we know, all of what we've been taught and just give way to the Holy Ghost. Just yield entirely to the Lord so that he can live through our lives. That's the difference between the two. &gt;&gt; One has enough oil and one doesn't. one observes the one with the oil because the shout has already gone forth. Brother Brandham declared that &gt;&gt; the shouts already happened. &gt;&gt; The voice is already happening. The voice is the message in the bride. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a trump of the Lord. And I don't think it's any accident that it's called the trump of God. &gt;&gt; Today talking about the power of his resurrection. You know, there's one hit in the Bible, the power of his resurrection. You might be wondering where I got this from. It was while we were away. Well, I just fellowshipping with the Lord. Just just taking in the sights and the sounds of being away from everything. There's just something so powerful of getting away from all that we know and just getting alone with one another and and the Lord. This came to me just really profoundly, the power of his resurrection. So, I went and looked it up and Paul's speaking here, you know, he he talks about who he is and and all that he knows and all that he's been taught and everything from his history and he said, "You know what? I have to count all of that dong." It was the greatest thing to me for the longest time until I actually met him personally myself. And when that time happened on the road to Damascus, he was never the same. He didn't go and say, "I've got this tremendous experience. God met me, blinded me, and and gave me my sight back, and now I can go and preach the gospel. No, he had to go and actually check it all with the word of God. And that's what every one of our responsibility is. If we see something with this message, we have to check it up with the word of God. But then understand that it's going to be revealed by the Lord to us through his word. I just love what I heard in the in the brother's preacher. I think it was brother Emanuel. He said it that there is actually there's the knowledge of the word. There's the reading of the word, but then there's actually the revealing of the word. And a man cannot reveal the the magnitude or or the revelation of the word of God. It has to be revelation by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Has to be. I certainly appreciated both of the services. I know I'm going on about brother Emanuel. really enjoyed Brother Tobiy's service and I'm so thankful to have the gifts in the body that can step in and and really minister the word of God the way that we need it and and to be just so in season, so in sync with everything that's going on. It's not like we're trying to pull in different directions. We're we're we're we're going the same way with this word. It's just wonderful. I'm certainly thankful for that. There's something great about understanding the positions of our our families and the positions in our families and being able to train our children the way they need to be taught &gt;&gt; to encourage them &gt;&gt; to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And you know, that's one of the reasons why I want to do the youth services. We had, excuse me, a little bit of an exhortation about the youth services and I talked about David and how each one of these children are little Davids. And if you look it up, that's the quote that I brought one of them where brother Brandham talks about little Davids. And uh you know, everyone has the opportunity. If you've ever played music or gone up on stage for a service, you understand what I'm talking about. You know what it means to go and slay giants because you got to fight your way to get on stage. I think anybody that would come up here and not have to actually go through some level of anxiety to be able to do something for the house of the Lord oughtn't to be up here &gt;&gt; because it's a pride thing then. Then it's a show. And if we're looking for a show, hey, you know what? There's lots of places where you can go to actually show the talent, the gift that God has given you. There's many different bands that are looking for musicians. There's places that are looking for singers. We can do concerts. We can do all of those things. But this is worship in the house of the Lord. This is revelation by the spirit about how I'm supposed to play my instrument. Not instruction from a music instructor. It's all about the spirit of God. But the children that came in on the very first night, we just simply said, "Who can play the piano? Who can play the organ? Who can play the guitar? Who can play whatever? Who can do it? If you can do it, raise your hand." They raised hands. They came up and they actually s we sang three or four songs. And guess what? We worshiped. The presence of God came into the building and we worshiped. It was far from perfect. But it's not about perfection in the way that we would think about it. &gt;&gt; It's making a joyful noise unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I can't help but think what an encouragement that is for the children when the adults can be in the back worshiping God to the music that they're doing. &gt;&gt; Tremendous. That to me is the power of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; People wanting to worship God. Whether it's through song, whether it's through music, whether it's just through raising your hands and and and opening your heart unto the Lord, but the power of his resurrection is where we're going today. And there's one hit in the Bible. That's where I took it from out of Philippians. Paul talking about how he's not interested in looking at the past. He was a a bad guy to the way of the apostles view, wasn't he? &gt;&gt; He was laying the church to waste when he talks about zeal. If you want to talk about zeal, he was zealous. He was a zealot for the word of God. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I count all that dung." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I count it all dung. &gt;&gt; All the my former thinking and teaching because I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God through Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; But you know in the message there's 205 results for the exact quote. the power of his resurrection. And for me, that's just amazing because, you know, when you look at it, one scripture, one sentence can garner 205 hits out of the entire message. And I know there's probably more, but there's something to this. There's some some some weight to this, some gravity to this. And I think it's just beautiful because it really speaks of the consciousness of sunship, of recognizing who we are. When we know that we are the son of the boss, when we know that we're the son of the king, when we know that we're the son of our parents, when our parents speak and introduce us and say, "This is my son." Something happens. There's an appreciation. There's a consciousness that that's my dad. That's my daddy and I'm his son. And it doesn't matter what I think or feel. It just is that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I just appreciate brother brother Toby's way of going about it and and saying that that's exactly what we're doing here as parents. It's exactly a type of God dealing with us in our lives. And what it's all about is reinforcing our identity to us that we are sons. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Reinforcing it over and over and over &gt;&gt; because we're sons. We receive correction. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I say, "Look out, man. If you can't receive correction, the moment that I can't receive correction, look out." We all have to receive it. Because if we're not able to receive correction by the word of God, then we're not his son. That's what his word says. But it also says that we're not supposed to work our children. We're not supposed to discourage our children unto wrath. We're supposed to encourage our children. And I think it's such an amazing thought because that's what he does over and over and over again. He encourages us to understand who we are. How does he do it? He tells us that there's no substitute for the truth. And that's where it becomes difficult many times in our lives because we think well we we know this from our past and we know that from our past, but does it actually blend with our word for our day? Does it actually really go hand to glove for that? If it doesn't, then there's probably something a little bit wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One of these days, God's going to close the door. We read that quote out of the sixth seal. One of these days, God's going to close the door just like he did at the day of Noah. He's going to close that door. And there's there isn't going to be anybody coming in. All that's filthy, let them be filthy still, right? All that's holy, let them be holy. And we know what's going to happen. we'll we'll we'll start to see loved ones everything will change and by the time that happens it's too late we can go and repent and and brother Brandham said it they they Bible says that they knocked on the door pounded on the door no let us in let us in and he had to say listen I didn't close the door all I did was preach the word and that word closed the door and it's the same thing today one of these days it's going to change and it's just going to be the secret sudden going way of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a great persecution coming around and kicking indoors and hunting us down like dogs. No, that'll be the people who are actually left behind. The ones that don't actually go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And how do you go in the rapture? How do you get there? Just get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, when we have the Holy Ghost in our life, we're going to stumble and fall. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're trapped in this pest house. Amen. &gt;&gt; The difference between the people who are with the Holy Ghost, who have the Holy Ghost in their life, and the people that don't have the Holy Ghost in their life, the people that don't have the Holy Ghost in their life, they stumble and fall and they think, "There's nothing to it. Why could I actually ever live that? I could never live that. Why would I even try? It needs to be no longer me, but Christ that lives in me. He's the one." And what will happen is we'll get up and we'll get our butts back to church again. We won't stay down and stay away. But there's no substitute for the truth. There's no substituting the truth. Eve tried that. And what happened? Custom fig leaves came out. We We're going to try and hide ourselves with a new religion. We're going to say, you know what? We don't have to worship the way that God wants us to worship, the way that he gave us to worship. What we're going to do is is not just feed on the tree of life. We're going to feed on the tree of knowledge of good and evil. We're going to try that for a little while. And what happened? We know the fall of mankind and and we know why we know why it happened. We know how it happened. I'm not going to go too far into that. But what I am saying is Jesus said that not one jot or one tit can pass. Not not one jot or one tit. The smallest mark in in the Greek dictionary. The smallest little tiny indicators in the Greek dictionary. Not one of those can pass before his will will be done. And you know, to have one of those off is actually going to be death. That's going to be tribulation material. To have one jot or one tit off, not in the hearts of a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's not the way it'll go because a believer will always say, "Be it unto me according to thy word." Lord, I I I might not understand it. I don't even really be able to to to know it myself. I I might not be a a really smart guy, but alls I can say is I want to surrender unto that word more and more in my life. And the more that I surrender, the lighter my load. &gt;&gt; The more that I surrender, the more that he takes control. That's the way it works. &gt;&gt; You know, one word off in the hearts of the believer, brother Emanuel said this and I just have to say it. One word off in the hearts of a believer can transpire into one word off into the congregation. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And how important is it for us to be established in the present truth? If we're not established in the present truth, then we're just like every single other church in this world. &gt;&gt; And that doesn't puff us up. It humbles us. It makes us recognize really where we stand. &gt;&gt; Those people in Israel are crying out for Messiah. &gt;&gt; They really want Messiah. This is the year where they sacrifice the first red hepher in over 2,000 years. The building of the third temple is right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are longing for Messiah. They're crying out for Messiah. Where are we at, brothers and sisters? They were blinded for our sake, persecuted to the ends of the earth so that we could hear this gospel today. &gt;&gt; Wow. It's so important for us to recognize there's a written word, &gt;&gt; but there's a revealed word. &gt;&gt; We're willing recipients of the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Random talks about it. We'll get into it a little bit, but the the mechanics are one thing. We have decades of mechanics. And you know, when you live by the law, you die by the law. When you just try and extremely strain people to live by the letter of the law, the children are pretty smart. They see it's legalism. &gt;&gt; They see legalism full well. That's what happens when you live by the law. You have a legalistic perspective. Everyone else is wrong. Unless you see it my way, you're wrong. Well, God God deals with everyone sovereignly. The bride of Jesus Christ accepts the revealed word for their day. That doesn't mean that there's other people that aren't saved. &gt;&gt; What it means is there's some people that will go on the rapture and other people that will actually be there later on. But Ephesians 4, you know, we can't we can't do away with God's word. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot do away with God. There's no substitute. We said it already. Brother Emanuel said it. There's no substitute for God's word &gt;&gt; just because everyone says it because a lot of people are doing it. There's no substitute for God's word. You can't just change God's word. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:11 says, "And he gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors, and teachers." Why? He didn't just say, "I give them to you." He says, "For the perfecting of the saints." And remember, perfecting is perfect is maturing. The maturing of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know the rest of it. It says, "Till we all come in the unity of the spirit." &gt;&gt; Right? The unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The only way that's going to happen is for us to forget about what we know &gt;&gt; to say, "Be it unto me according to thy word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what? I remember a brother, a veteran brother. Many people probably weren't here at the time. He said, "I struggled my entire life with the Holy Ghost, knowing whether I've got the Holy Ghost, raised in the message, &gt;&gt; steeped in tradition, but said, "I want to know that I know that I know. And I want to get rebaptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So I can drive down a stake today, tonight, and say, "You don't have any power over me, Satan." Because from this time forward, I know what's happened. I understand it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think we need a shakeup like that. &gt;&gt; Just to say, "Be it unto me according to thy word." &gt;&gt; But are we too too rigid and prideful to say, "No, I know it. There's nothing you can tell me." Are we? I don't want to be that way. We've got to say just like Mary, be it unto me according to thy word. How else is the spirit of the most high going to overshadow us? He's a gentleman. &gt;&gt; He's not going to force himself. &gt;&gt; You know, it's manifesting time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the day that we live in right now. Brothers and sisters, I see this all going on. I just can't help but think something big is just about to happen. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm crazy and and and many people probably think that and that's okay. &gt;&gt; Leave me alone. I like it this way. &gt;&gt; But you know, God has a way. And to try and say there's a substitute for it &gt;&gt; is is shockingly frightening. &gt;&gt; It truly is. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. especially in the ranks of of what we call this message for people to say that there's another way. Getting a little too Pentecostal is is out of order. No. Brother Brandham said Pentecost is an experience, didn't he? &gt;&gt; It's not a denomination. &gt;&gt; So if someone gets excited about this word, that's not wrong. &gt;&gt; It's wrong to try and quench the spirit. The word speaks expressly about that out of God's provided place of worship in 1965. He says, "Then notice, not only does he come in by the Holy Spirit, the only way we're going to get to know him is by the Holy Spirit." By the way, if I haven't said it in the last while, you got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I I heard someone preaching it and I thought it was good because he says it unequivocally. You have to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that you can speak in tongues. And I'm like, "Oh man, come on. Come on." But he said it so fervently. I was like, "Man, this guy sounds like a believer. You unequivocally have to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's the only way. Without it, you're lost." And he's 100% right. I'm saying, "Amen." A I have to let down. But you know what, Brother Brandham, the prophet for this age, he said, then notice, not only does he come in by the Holy Spirit with the learning of his word, &gt;&gt; Amen. He manifests that word. &gt;&gt; That's why I say when we get the ones that want to say it's an invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yep. It is. Sometimes you can't really see it initially, but just give it time. &gt;&gt; Give it the time test. We talked about it like oil and vinegar. You want to make a vinegarette dressing, you can get it together and emulsify it. Put it in a mixer and blend it and it'll it'll be so emulsified. It'll just look like one liquid. But just give it the time test. Just let it sit there on the counter for a little bit and you'll see what will happen. &gt;&gt; It will separate. Without the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that's what's going to happen. We will separate also. We can't stand. People can't stand the word of God in the day in which we live. The true word. People want to have some kind of a religion that's going to accommodate the way they want to live. And unfortunately, that's even in the ranks of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I want to have multiple wives. I want to be able to do this. I want to drink on the side. I want to be able to do that. Everything that I want to do, I can find a ministry. You can. &gt;&gt; You'll find a ministry that will give you the liberty to do whatever you want. &gt;&gt; God said that he would give them over to what? &gt;&gt; A rep probate mind. &gt;&gt; He will also send them a strong delusion. They'll be delusional. They'll think, "Oh my, I've got the message of the hour. This is okay." It's not okay. &gt;&gt; It's got to line up with the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says then notice, not only does he come in by the Holy Spirit with the learning of his word. We learn about the word. We learn about the message. He manifests that word. We become a new creature in Christ Jesus. Now, I can't remember who who said it, whether it was brother Toby or whether it was brother Emanuel, but you know, we do become a new creature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; There comes a time in our life. I think it was brother Toby. There comes a time in our life where we see a change. It's not easy to be a message kid, is it? &gt;&gt; It's not. He talked about how the elders, they had a transformation. They came in out of the world. They came from denomination and God did something wonderful for them in their lives. But as a child in the message, you're just raised up in the message. But there still has to come a time where you come to know him personally. &gt;&gt; And how can you tell? &gt;&gt; He begins to manifest his word in your life. How how does that work? I'm going to use an example and I hope it's okay. Brother Miles, I'm going to I'm going to use you, brother. I hope it's okay. We prayed for Brother Miles that he would find a work co-op in the city of Calgary so that he wouldn't have to travel abroad to be away from church so that he could actually be in service for the king. &gt;&gt; That was part of the requirement of the prayer. Lord, we want this, but we want it this way. For this reason, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; What' God do? &gt;&gt; God came in &gt;&gt; by the spirit by the learning of his word. We can bring a a prayer and supplication to him according to his word, which is his will that I want to be in service for the king. And God comes around and then he manifests it by the word. What happens? Oh, you can have a co-op right here in the city of Calgary. You don't have to leave church. You can stay living at home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's not it. &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes people might be saying, "Well, it's just fluke, Brother Barry." Is it fluke when we take our prayers to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, &gt;&gt; and you get what you ask for? &gt;&gt; Then we prayed that he would find the perfect job. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; we prayed that he would find the perfect job. Now he's in a position which is the perfect position. &gt;&gt; We did the same with brother Daniel. Where is he? Our song leader. Same thing. Not just any job, but the perfect job. Did you get a perfect job? &gt;&gt; That's God. That's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; If we want to actually bring our prayers and supplications to him, he is listening to our prayers. &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. We heard the the little testimony. The first time that that sister was prayed for, she was on the other side. She heard that prayer. Can you believe that? &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, have mercy on me." If I find myself in a situation where I'm absent in the body, but I know I'm present with the Lord according to the word of God. That I would hear the saints of God praying for brother Barry and I'd be like, "Hallelujah. Glory to God." Oh my. Can you imagine how she must have felt? And a second prayer, a second prayer brought her back into her body. &gt;&gt; Oh my, she started to twitch. Not for 20 days had she moved. And then what? One more prayer. She gets up and says, "Get the stuff together. These people are hungry. We need to make tamalies." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful testimony. &gt;&gt; That's not fiction, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. But he comes in by the spirit with the learning of his word. We say, "Wow, I need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins so that I can actually receive that gift of the Holy Ghost for myself. It's for me." And then he manifests that word. The things that we used to love, they just fall off. The people that we used to love, they just become dull. The places we used to go, just not into it. What I really want to do is get excited because when I hear somebody say there's going to be a church service, something jumps inside of me. Like David said, I I was excited when they said, "Let us go unto the house of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We become a new creature. &gt;&gt; We don't have the old interests in our lives. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now remember the prophets believe the word. They receive the word of God. And God, the Holy Spirit, came into them and fired that promise out and made it come to pass. Oh my, who's going to condemn that? Who could do that? We know it. We preaching to the choir sometimes. Amos 3:7, surely the Lord God will do nothing &gt;&gt; except he first reveal his secret unto his servants, the prophets. That's that's God's way of doing it &gt;&gt; and it hasn't changed. But I I just, you know, got thinking about this the the power of his resurrection and the quotes as we get into studying. 2 Corinthians 7 came to mind. Verse one, having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit. not just of the flesh but of the spirit. Perfecting holiness in the fear of God. Maturing holiness &gt;&gt; in the fear of God. &gt;&gt; Recognizing we were talking about this at home. One of the biggest downfalls of of children I think it is. Is that right? Is that we just lose the God consciousness. &gt;&gt; We just lose the consciousness that God is watching &gt;&gt; that God is listening. We're just around the dinner table. Nobody else in church can hear us. We can talk about that brother or sister or or we can just look at that thing or we can just think that thing. You know, our our thoughts are louder in heaven than our voices here on earth. &gt;&gt; It's a tremendous thing to recognize. But, you know, we can cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh. And how do we do that? We just go on our knees and say, "Lord, forgive me. Let me die out to this pest house that I'm in. I recognize this this prison that I'm in." And one of these days I'm going to be set free from it. Whether I go by the way of the grave or the great trump of God happens and I go by the way of the sky. One one day I'm going to be delivered from this pest house. But I'm stuck here. And you know that I He knows that we are. &gt;&gt; He knows every single every single struggle that we're going through. He knew the struggle before we were even born here on earth. Brother Brandham says that he knows every single flea, &gt;&gt; every single time it would bat its eye and how much tallow would come off of it. &gt;&gt; Now, I have trouble even understanding that myself because some animals have a lot of fleas, but he knows everyone. &gt;&gt; 1964 Jehovah Gyra number two. I don't know if I got into this in the past, but I I think in the future I will. We don't need to prove God's word. &gt;&gt; And sometimes I think we try to we get caught up in the hype of the moment and we want to try and prove God's word and trust that because we do things a certain way. And you know, brother Brandham said it, if God met someone on a certain ground, a certain way, and you meet him &gt;&gt; yourself on a certain ground a certain way, that he's obligated to meet you the same way. Sometimes in our lives, we can do that the way we think that we can do that. And God doesn't move the way that we want it to happen. That doesn't mean that he's not God. &gt;&gt; But we got to be very careful with that. &gt;&gt; God is not going to be moved by anything that we can do as a human. &gt;&gt; The only thing that's going to move him is faith. &gt;&gt; Faith in his word. &gt;&gt; But he is the only interpreter of his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take a scholar. It doesn't take a great message ministry. And I'm not throwing off on anyone. What I am saying is it takes revelation by the spirit is what the seventh angel messenger said. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 129 here it says, "But God don't need nobody to interpret him. He is his own interpreter." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He don't need nobody to interpret him. Nobody. He makes the promise, then he brings it to pass. And that's interpretation of it by bringing it to pass in our lives by bringing a prayer and a supplication. Bringing it to the Lord in a prayer meeting, by the way, and just giving it to the Lord with a few faithful saints and saying, "I trust you, Lord, that you will be able to make this happen the way that you want it to happen." and then sit back and watch and give God the glory. Say, "Thank you, Lord, for making this come to pass according to your word. Thank you, Lord, for interpreting this by bringing it to pass in my life the way that you want it to happen because I know that I'm going to graduate and I know that I'm going to get a job somewhere. So, why wouldn't you provide that perfect job for me anyways?" &gt;&gt; What a tremendous thing it is. I just think it's so beautiful, don't you, to see the young brothers, believers of this word, raised in the message, and then come to the place now where we've got to make real world big people decisions and just trust the Lord with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding, but in all of your ways, man, that's the key. All of your ways, not most of them, not Wednesdays and Sundays, not threequarters of them, all of your ways, acknowledge him and he shall direct your paths. &gt;&gt; He makes the promise, then he brings it to pass. And that's interpretation of it. No one has to interpret it. God don't ask no one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Bible is of no private interpretation. I love that because some people would say, "Well, it takes a prophet Indeed it does. Indeed it does. The seventh angel messenger said it very clearly. If what's happening is happening, what I think is happening is happening. There won't be two of us standing here at the same time. We can get into the really deep things of this, but I'm not going to today. We know that a a mighty angel descended with an open book in his hand, and it wasn't brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; It wasn't brother Brandham that did that put one foot on the sea and one foot on the earth and declared complete ownership over all of it. with a rainbow about his head. Who had a rainbow about his head? We know who exactly who that is. The angel of the covenant, the Lord Jesus Christ himself shall descend out of heaven with a shout. And that is what he did. And then he took that shout and gave it unto man. And it became the voice. And that is what is resounding here today and and does every time we get together and fellowship around this word. It is the voice of the resurrection. the power of his resurrection in our ears. The more we say amen to that word, the more we see the resurrection of Jesus Christ today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the key I want to get to. We need to see the resurrection of Jesus Christ today. It's beautiful 2,000 years ago. Without it, we wouldn't have any salvation. &gt;&gt; There had to be a manifestation of that. &gt;&gt; But where is it today? &gt;&gt; Is it something we just talk about? Or can we actually show our children there is a God with skin on? There is a living God. We do believe in a living word. That's why we call this assembly the living word assembly in Calvary because God is alive today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He makes the promise. &gt;&gt; Then he brings it to pass. &gt;&gt; And that's the interpretation of it. &gt;&gt; No one has to interpret it. It's so dangerous when we think someone has to interpret this word of God. &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful the way he did it? He raised up a prophet, a hillbilly Kentucky hillbilly out of Kentucky to come and bring this word and and and to be able to actually have it recorded. the magnetic recording device was released. That technology was released and the prophet the the the prophetic office was released and everything was released all at the same time and went around the world seven times and everything just happened and here we are today with this word. He doesn't need anybody to interpret this word. &gt;&gt; Nobody. There's no eighth messenger. There's no seven and a half. &gt;&gt; Nobody interprets this word except for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's only revealed by the spirit. And that's why he said in the church age book, you've got to get in the spirit first. Get in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Forget about all the rest of it. Push it all back aside. Just get in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let him reveal it to us. He is the teacher. &gt;&gt; Said it before that, you know, some people believe that we need a prophet to interpret the word. And sure enough, we do. And he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He came and he brought this word the way that God wanted it delivered. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he told it to us the way that we needed it. It's no accident that it was given to us in the grammar that it was given to us in. It's no accident that it was given to this world, I'm going to say it this way, to this world in English. Why wasn't it given to this world in Spanish? Why wasn't it given to this world in Cantonese? Why was it English? It's no accident. I've I've said it before. It's pretty amazing that, you know, we would see the the word of God manifest through a seventh angel messenger. It's pretty amazing that we could be here and and and see it. And I had a brother say to me one time, "Isn't it amazing to think that God would actually raise up an entire nation &gt;&gt; so that that prophetic utterance could come out of it?" &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; To me, that's astounding. But that's the God we serve. Just like every single flea that bats his eye, he knows about it. Right? Every hair that's on our head, he knows about it. &gt;&gt; He makes the promise, then he brings it to pass. &gt;&gt; And that's the interpretation of it. So, if he's made a promise in the Bible, brothers and sisters, I'm probably going to dig into this a little bit later. If he makes a promise in the Bible, then it's up to him to interpret it. It's up to him to bring it to pass. That's how he interprets it. &gt;&gt; He doesn't give us a head knowledge to say, "I've got the the knowledge of this. I've got the grammar way of understanding it in this way and that way and the other way and before long we're so far out on branches that we're confused ourselves. &gt;&gt; No, it's revelation by the spirit and he keeps it simple. &gt;&gt; The Bible is of no private interpretation. And that's what happens when you get the great teachers that want to take this word and try and do something with it. It's not a teacher's responsibility. It's the spirit's responsibility. And if we say that we wish that God sent us a prophet so the prophet could actually help us go a little further with it. The prophet that was in the land that said there won't be two of us at the same time if what's happening is happening. &gt;&gt; He said there is a prophet in the land and that prophet is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the prophet. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the prophet. The Bible is of no private interpretation. When we start hearing, oh my, there's a a teaching that's that's private. It's like this. I mean, it's as crazy as saying, you know, we'll baptize someone in the name of Rosco. We'll we'll pray in the name of Rosco. Are you serious? People doing that? Of course they are. &gt;&gt; Yes, they are. &gt;&gt; They're seducing spirits. &gt;&gt; Evil spirits &gt;&gt; wrapped up in religion claiming to be of Christ. &gt;&gt; The prophet in our day, he said, "As long as you do that, you call me Antichrist. You make me antichrist and I'm going to take myself off. I have to take myself off the field because I won't stand for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You fix that up. You make that right and then I'll come back on the field. Until you do, that ain't happening. And it's interesting because it was just before the seals were released. &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; He knows his men will be honest with the word. They'll stay true to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Goes on to say, "Everybody trying to say it means this, that, let God speak for himself. Just let God speak for himself. He's the one that does it. He made the promise. He stands behind it. He does to believers. &gt;&gt; He doesn't stand behind it for everyone. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. We know that all things work together to the good, right? &gt;&gt; Not for everyone. &gt;&gt; To those who are called &gt;&gt; according to his purpose. Those are the ones that it works out to the good for. &gt;&gt; It's not for everyone. &gt;&gt; You know what? I just couldn't help but think as I was studying this out, how how do I prove it? How do I prove that I I've got the Holy Ghost? How do I prove that God is actually working in my life? How do I prove that I've got the Holy Ghost? How And many times we just need to prove to ourselves. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Forget about all the other people. Sometimes our parents might be grilling us a little bit about it, but or or brothers or sisters, but you know, we don't have to prove nothing is what I want to say. It's up to God to prove it. &gt;&gt; It's up to us to be faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To simply get up and go to church. &gt;&gt; You see the people that say, "I've got such a great grand revelation of the word of God, but can't come to church." &gt;&gt; I say, "What message do you believe?" &gt;&gt; I mean, we believe it or not. Do we halfway believe the message of the hour or do we all the way believe the message of the hour? If we all the way believe the message of the hour, then we're going to want to be in church every time the doors are open. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. We can't always. Sometimes we have to work. But if we're actually just staying home and doing other things, if we're just booking things just because what is it? What? What is it? &gt;&gt; That's not the spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. But how do I prove God's word? God proves his own word. &gt;&gt; We don't have to prove nothing. The only thing we've got to do is be faithful. And what I mean by that is patient. &gt;&gt; We've got to be patient in our position. You know, it's not an actual sprinting race. If anybody here has ever ran a marathon, you know what I'm talking about. If you've got a long destination that you've got to go on your feet, you know what I mean. You have to pace yourself. You don't want to blow all your energy right away. You're going to need it later on. But, you know, sometimes just being able to go to church is a struggle seemingly. It's tough. The devil just wants to keep us away. &gt;&gt; But if we're willing to say, "Shut up flesh. &gt;&gt; You don't reign. &gt;&gt; God reigns in this flesh." &gt;&gt; And I'm going to follow the word of God for my day. God will prove his word if we are faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. How does God vindicate his word? I just have to say it. How does he vindicate his word? He brings it to pass &gt;&gt; and alls we need to do is commit it unto him. Commit all of our ways unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just give it unto him and allow him to work it out in our lives. You know, talking about the power of the resurrection. Let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 10. &gt;&gt; I can see we're just about out of time and I feel like I'm just wanting to get started just like usual. It's beautiful. Hebrews chapter 10. We're not talking about looking back to the old things as Paul said. We're we're interested in looking forward to the new things, pressing towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus, understanding that there is a a a power of his resurrection and and can you see that power of his resurrection in your life? That's really what I wanted to say today, brothers and sisters. Can you see that? Is it happening in your life? Because if it's not, then there's something maybe just that needs to be changed just a little bit. And I guarantee you, you will see it. Sometimes in our lives, we have a great experience maybe years ago and and and our experience can get cold. We heard about it when we were in the States. Sometimes we just deviate a little bit, man. We just let one thing slide. And maybe we just don't stop going to church on Wednesday nights and you know we're busy with work and our lives and things happen and we just let that one little thing slip and before long this other thing over here just begins to slip and before long these other things all over the place are slipping and we wonder how did we ever get to this position. God allows us to get there so that we'll look up &gt;&gt; and say how did I get here? &gt;&gt; But that's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want to beat us up. He wants to love us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Hebrews chapter 10 verse 14 by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified. &gt;&gt; Alls we need to do is celebrate that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many times we want to have an offering. We want to have some great thing that we've done. I've got this thing that I've got to do. You know what? He's done it all. &gt;&gt; Alls we need to do is be willing to acknowledge him in this marathon race that we're running. Follow him according to the instruction that we're given, according to the word for our day, which will perfect our bodies to receive that word and one day change our bodies. &gt;&gt; But don't think that we're just one day magically going to have that change of a body and we're going to have a change of a character because that ain't happening. You got to get this character right here first. &gt;&gt; Once this character is right, then these bodies will be changed. We heard about it again this last week. Once the bride recognizes, once the church recognizes what it is, then the rapture will go, &gt;&gt; reinforcing sunship, encouraging us to good works. But Hebrews 10:14, it says, "For by one offering, he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified, whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us, that after he had said before, oh my, this is where I'm going to really start preaching, brothers and sisters. This is the what? This is the covenant. The covenant, not something that we made, something that he made. This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, sayaeth the Lord. I will put my laws into their hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're not going to go into their hearts without the Holy Ghost. We can read and read and read and read and read, be ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. It has got to be God himself, the Holy Ghost, revealing this word to us. And that is him putting his laws into their hearts and into their minds will I write them. &gt;&gt; We'll be striving to serve him according to his word for our day. &gt;&gt; And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, I don't want to say this is something that's coming in the future. Some people want to put it off and say this is coming in the future. I want to say it the way the prophet said it. &gt;&gt; This day, this scripture is fulfilled in your ears. &gt;&gt; This day we can say that our sins and iniquities he will remember no more. &gt;&gt; How could we remain silent over that? &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not saying we are, but I just can't help but think, you know, that makes me want to have a Pentecostal revival myself. to think that he's not going to remember my sin or my iniquity. They're cast into the sea of his forgetfulness. Let me do that myself with my own sin and iniquity. Cast them into the sea of his forgetfulness. Help me not remember them anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 18 says, "Now where remission of these is, oh boy, there is no more offering for sin." Right &gt;&gt; now, some would say, "Wow, you can actually do whatever you want now because you're going to make it. It's just fine." Yep, you can do whatever you want. You're a free will agent. Go and have a little sippy. Go and have a little smoky. Go and watch and listen and do whatever. We can do all of that, but we don't want to, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because the prophet told us through a prophetic utterance from the throne of God, "These things don't please me. They're all attributes of something that I don't like. And that thing that I don't like is unbelief in my word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we're talking about something here in Hebrews. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 16. This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, sayeth the Lord. I will put my laws into their hearts, and into their mind will I write them, and their sin and iniquities will I remember no more. Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. Oh my. This is what I wanted to get to, brothers and sisters. Once upon a time, the children of Israel longed to see what was behind that veil. Now, that veil is torn wide open. And we have full access. Let us come boldly with assurance that he's expecting us. &gt;&gt; He's not just looking hoping that he's going to see us. He's expecting to see us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; How? &gt;&gt; By a new and living way. &gt;&gt; The resurrected Jesus Christ in our lives. The power of his resurrection is going to constrain us to come according to his word by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of God. Let us draw near with a true heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, let us draw near. Let us draw near with a true heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; In full assurance &gt;&gt; of faith &gt;&gt; knowing that he has already done it all, man. He's done it all. He's paid the full sacrifice for our sin and iniquity. He's put them away. There's no more remembrance of it. He doesn't even know it. We say, "Lord, forgive me." He says, "For what?" &gt;&gt; For what? &gt;&gt; But it doesn't give us license to go and sin. It doesn't give us license to go and do things that we know we ought to do. Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, we no longer desire to hang out with those friends. We no longer desire to watch those things. We no longer desire to look back and think about all the bad things that I've done in my life and I could just never have the success in our our our life that we want to have. No, we don't do that. We've been sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies are washed with pure water. &gt;&gt; What water? We come to church to have a shower and a bath, don't we? So &gt;&gt; that's why we come here for the washing of the water by the word. &gt;&gt; And you know, brothers and sisters, I've said it many times, but I'll say it from the pulpit. If somebody comes in here ill-dressed, maybe smelly of cigarettes or maybe weed or whatever it is, bring them in. &gt;&gt; Let's get them washed up by the water of the word, how are they ever going to hear it? How are they ever going to see it if we're not willing to even let them in? Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not better than them. &gt;&gt; Outside of an experience on our own, &gt;&gt; we're just the same. &gt;&gt; And given the pressures of this world, oh my, there's no escaping it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's no escaping the pressures of this world outside of Jesus Christ himself. The true baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives. But what we're talking about here is the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The power of his resurrection. I think is just scratching the surface of really where I want to get into, brothers and sisters, but I can see I'm over time now. It's it's amazing to see this. I'll call the musicians and try and and bring it in for landing here. But, you know, we're talking about a new and living way. And that is the living life of Jesus Christ living out through us. Not maybe like we see in some of the mega churches. Not that it makes us better, but we're willing to take the word over everything. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for a rock concert. We're not looking for ultimate performance. What we're looking for is the spirit of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; so that people can come in and actually be changed. Hearts can be encouraged to the word of God. Children can come to know the Lord in the power of his resurrection. Sinners can be saved. That's what we're doing here. That's what this is all about. &gt;&gt; It's not about patting ourselves on the back and saying what good people we are. We're ranked sinners saved by grace. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. But we can't change God's program. We can't eliminate any scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I was thinking about this as I was studying. You know, outside of the Holy Ghost in our lives, my the devil is is a master of the scripture. Satan knows this word better than any human ever will. &gt;&gt; But boy oh boy, when we have the spirit of Christ inside of us, There's no match for Satan. &gt;&gt; Satan meets the matchless one. But he doesn't believe it. And that's why we get sorely tempted over and over and over again because he doesn't believe it. He just doesn't believe it that God would come down and and and and condescend so far that he would inhabit the lives of people like you and I. Amen. &gt;&gt; My I just want to say maybe stand with me as we close here. You know, out of it is the rising of the sun. It's a the last quote that I'll bring. I just think it's so good. Brother Brandham, he says there has been churches, churches, brides, brides, churches, brides, brides. But there's got to come one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's got to come a real bride. And you know that real bride is going to be the one that goes on to make herself ready in the book of Revelation. She's going to be the one that becomes wife because she has a consecration of the marriage. She has a true relationship with her husband. But he says, "But there has to be one that's not only got the mechanics, but the dynamics of it makes that church live, move in the power of his resurrection." Until we come to that place, until we find that place, what good does it do to polish the hubs? &gt;&gt; What good does it do to give her a facelift or a Simonized job? He's talking about a car and polishing it up and doing all the things we can do to a car. What good does it do to do that to our lives? What good does it do to do that to our church until we have the dynamic power of the resurrected Jesus Christ living out through us? What good does it do? He says, "What good does it do to give her a facelift or a Simonized job when there's no dynamics in it?" No matter how much the mechanics prove to be right, there has got to be a dynamics to make it work. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that's what he proved. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Talking about the resurrection power on Easter morning. That's what Easter proved. He wasn't only the word, but he was God himself. The dynamics in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That made the body of Christ, Jesus Christ, cold, stiff, and dead in the grave, shaken to life and rise again and roll away the stone. I love that because it wasn't as though angels came and rolled away the stone the way he's talking here. It was that resurrecting power. And today I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters. If any of us are caught in a tomb, oh my, let's see that resurrecting power come and manifest in our lives and maybe a way like we've never seen it before. So that that stone that's holding us in bondage can be rolled away as well. &gt;&gt; Because he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; The devil wants us to say, "No, you're dead. There's no way that you'll ever get out of where you're at. There's no way that you'll ever see a different life. There's no way that you'll ever have power over this in your life. You're never going to. He's right. But Christ already has. &gt;&gt; And if you've got him on the inside, you've got that resurrected power. You've got a newness of life, a new way of living. It's that dynamics in the word. That's why brother Brandham said the only true evidence of the Holy Ghost is your ability to believe the word for the day in which you live. That's the dynamic power &gt;&gt; that made the body of Jesus Christ cold, stiff, and dead in the grave shaken to life and rise again and roll away the stone. I am he that was dead. So dead till the sun said he was dead. The moon said he was dead. The stars said he was dead. We know all nature said he was dead. Yes. &gt;&gt; And now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again. &gt;&gt; He was not only the mechanics, God's word. Oh, but he was the dynamics to prove it. &gt;&gt; There's a reason why he preached this message, brothers and sisters. Not to look back and say, "What a wonderful Easter it was 2,000 years ago." Well, he says at the beginning of that message that he wants to see us recognize 2,000 years later the resurrection of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What we're preaching this morning, he has got to be alive and well in our lives today. He goes on to say, "And as he being the groom, the bride has to come forth because it's part of him. And it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the bride. It can only manifest. If it does something different from the groom, it isn't the bride. &gt;&gt; If it does something different than the groom, it isn't the bride. &gt;&gt; And I want to say it this way. If it does something different than the prophetic utterance, it isn't the bride. If it does something different than the way the prophet taught it, it isn't the bride. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She is him. &gt;&gt; Woo. I think that's so beautiful. That's where I live, brothers and sisters. She is him. This is the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. The manifestation of the angel messenger's word in the virgin womb causes the life of Jesus Christ to come forth in every single person which makes up this bride body. &gt;&gt; My she is his flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. She is him as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side. She had taken a spirit, a feminist spirit from him, the flesh from his side, made both mechanics and dynamics. the wife, the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and dynamics until the church of the people, all these Easter bunnies and ceremonies and big churches and finery will fail and pass away &gt;&gt; until that church becomes both dynamics &gt;&gt; and mechanics. &gt;&gt; I say let those dynamics fall on the mechanics. Amen. &gt;&gt; But how is that ever going to happen if we don't get together when the church opens its doors? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we want to see more of God, maybe we ought to give a little more. &gt;&gt; And if there's a deep calling, brothers and sisters, there is a deep to respond. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful. I was looking at it. The city of Calgary has exceeded 1.6 million people. Now, where's the last predestinated seed? &gt;&gt; Amen. How are we going to find that one? Where are we going? What are we doing? I think we're on the on the edge of something big going down in this world. And I really want to do our part here in the city of Calgary to find that last predestinated seed. My &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning, I just want to invite you to make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we bow our heads and and close the service here. Maybe there's something in our life that just hasn't been going right and we just don't understand and we just need the Lord to reveal it to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we just raise our hand while all of our eyes are closed and our heads are bowed and just trust him that he's watching and he knows our hearts. He's more than able. My eyes are closed, too. I don't want to see. I don't need to see. because it's not me that we're going to bring these needs to. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, this morning you see the hands, Lord Jesus. You see the needs in the hearts of your children. And Father, Lord, I just can't help but think of the the desire in their hearts, Lord, to raise their hands to you to say that there's more that I need of you. We know that you said through your prophet where there is a deep calling, there has to be a deep to respond. Where there's a scriptural question, there is a scriptural answer. Where there's a need in our life, you have a solution for us already. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to ask that you would allow the dynamic power of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ come upon your church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In a way like maybe we've never experienced before. Myself, too. Lord, &gt;&gt; help us to get out of the way and and hail King Jesus. Help us to just make the way for you, Lord, to manifest in our lives. What good is it to polish the church? What good is it to polish the hubs? What good is it to do any of that, Lord, if we don't have the dynamic spark in our lives of your Holy Spirit? Father, we just cast down every imagination that would try and exalt itself against your word now in the name of Jesus Christ. And we invite you, Lord, to take your position in the throne rooms of our hearts. &gt;&gt; We give you the preeminence, Lord. We thank you for your word. Thank you, Lord, that you rolled away that stone, Father. That you shook that dead body back to life with your spirit and that you stepped out and said, "I am he. I declare, oh, Father, the resurrected life of Jesus Christ back on this earth again. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Help us to receive it the way that you've given it. Lord, help us not to make excuses for it, Lord, and say that we just believe that it should be another way, so that's the way it's going to be. Oh, Father, forgive us for all of our shortcomings. Help us to receive that that one sacrifice that you made for every one of us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help us to receive it the way that you've given it. And Lord Jesus, we'll be careful to give you praise. Lord Jesus, we love you and we thank you. And Lord, we just pray that you would keep your hand upon each one of us now as we go our separate ways. Bless those who couldn't come today, Father, wherever they are. Thank you, Father, for touching those lives, keeping your angels encamped about those who fear you, even in the midst of of maybe armed gunmen, bad guys that would think that they have power over your children. Oh, Father, we thank you that your angels are encamped about those who fear you. Oh, Father, we know that there's way more for them than there are against them. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, even now if they're still in bondage, we pray that you would just bring them comfort, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, maybe they could be just like Paul and Silas while they were in prison that night, Father. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. And in their afflictions, in their pain, they began to worship. And in the midst of the worship, Father, it shook the foundations of that building, of that prison. And open the doors, Lord, and loose the chains. Father, we pray that you would just send them encouragement, Lord Jesus, even now in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we look forward to the testimony. We'll be careful to give you praise. We commit each and every one of the other prayer requests unto you as well. Father, keep your hand upon us as we go our separate ways. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're so thankful that you call us your sons and your daughters. &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you. We ask all these things now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Can we sing that song? I bless your name. I bless your name [Music] in prisoners chains with bleeding stripes. All silence prayed that night. And in their pain began to see [Music] doesn't matter what our challenge is. I bless your name.
