[45:22] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[45:26] and the sin which doth so easily beset
[45:30] us and let us run with patience the race
[45:33] that is set before
[45:35] us looking unto Jesus the author and
[45:39] finisher of our faith
[45:41] amen who for the joy that was set before
[45:44] him endured the cross despising the
[45:47] shame and is set down at the right hand
[45:51] of the Throne of God
[45:54] Amen
[45:57] let's just go on to him in prayer one
[45:59] more
[46:00] time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you
[46:03] for your
[46:04] word just pray that you would anoint it
[46:08] father and that you would Quicken it to
[46:10] us by your spirit
[46:12] tonight we know that man's words will
[46:16] fail we know that this whole world
[46:18] around us is falling apart and Lord
[46:21] Jesus there's one thing that will remain
[46:23] and that's your word and we pray that
[46:25] father tonight you would just Quicken
[46:27] this word and that it would find its
[46:29] Mark in our hearts tonight Lord Jesus in
[46:32] that place that you've made for us that
[46:35] place that you've made in US father for
[46:37] you
[46:38] rather just love you and we thank you we
[46:40] commit this service now into your hands
[46:43] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[46:46] God bless you tonight you may be
[46:50] seated did you ever think
[46:53] about Hebrews chapter 12 the second
[46:57] verse it says looking unto Jesus the
[47:00] author and finisher of our faith so he
[47:04] created our faith and he finishes our
[47:07] faith as well yes but did you ever think
[47:10] of the the second part there the second
[47:14] sentence who for the joy that was set
[47:18] before him endured the
[47:21] cross how could enduring the cross be
[47:24] Joy
[47:26] what part of that would have
[47:28] joy but I just want to say tonight I I
[47:31] think it's so beautiful because tonight
[47:34] we can look at ourselves and we can look
[47:36] at our brothers and our sisters and our
[47:37] families and our friends and we can
[47:40] recognize that you and we are that joy
[47:45] we are the jewels in his crown that's
[47:47] why he went to the Cross so that we
[47:50] could be here tonight and talk about him
[47:53] we just have a couple of uh sorry
[47:55] announcements um we have the ladies
[47:58] brunch coming up and uh that's this
[48:00] Saturday we have a communion service
[48:02] this Sunday uh the communion service
[48:04] will be at 6:
[48:06] pm and uh we'll probably have a few
[48:08] testimonies in that service as well we
[48:11] have the prayer meeting coming up this
[48:13] Thursday on the 16th that's at 7:30 p.m.
[48:19] and that wasn't on the calendar I just
[48:21] put it in and uh I apologize if that
[48:24] makes anybody uneasy you don't have to
[48:26] feel the pressure but I strongly
[48:29] recommend if you want to see things
[48:31] happen if you want to see God move in
[48:32] your life it's uh well worth looking at
[48:36] anyways uh so the prayer meeting will be
[48:38] this Thursday at 7:30 p.m. we have a
[48:40] youth gathering on the
[48:42] 19th and uh I just want to bring you
[48:44] greetings from Brother Paul halet in NAA
[48:47] Idaho he said to greet the Saints in
[48:49] Calgary at Calgary Living Word we had a
[48:52] just a beautiful conversation it's
[48:54] amazing when you talk to some folks
[48:55] there's just never ever enough time you
[48:58] can just talk on and on and you say you
[49:02] know well I think it's probably time to
[49:04] go and then something else comes up and
[49:06] you keep talking and before long it's
[49:08] not minutes it's hours that you're on
[49:10] the phone and you're like my goodness
[49:12] it's just not enough time so I bring you
[49:15] greetings from Brother Paul halit and I
[49:17] also bring you greetings from Brother
[49:19] codre digs and it looks like brother
[49:22] Cadre uh will be coming through here in
[49:24] December likely towards the middle of
[49:27] December we're certainly excited to see
[49:29] what will happen he's working out his
[49:31] itinerary and I said to him We're
[49:32] flexible here it's okay just uh let us
[49:35] know what works for you and and we'll
[49:37] make it work so he'll be coming through
[49:40] in December you're happy tonight amen
[49:43] certainly Odd as we were driving into
[49:46] service tonight just when we Crest the
[49:48] hill coming in from the south end of the
[49:49] city you know to see all of the city in
[49:52] in in darkness the sky is completely
[49:55] dark now with the time change uh I I
[49:58] said to Lisa you know it wasn't very
[49:59] long ago that you know this time of
[50:02] night the sun was really high in the sky
[50:05] and you know it was beautifully bright
[50:06] out until about 10:30 at night and here
[50:09] we are now uh early in the day in
[50:12] darkness I don't know how people could
[50:14] live in Alaska where it's 6 months of
[50:16] darkness I I can't handle the darkness
[50:19] or clouds but you know tonight just
[50:22] looking at our scripture in uh in
[50:24] Hebrews chapter 12 wherefore seeing we
[50:27] are also are compassed about with so
[50:30] great a cloud of witnesses isn't that
[50:33] beautiful brothers and sisters if we
[50:36] could just have that anointing that
[50:38] Elisha had when his servant came to him
[50:41] aesia and said you know what master
[50:44] master we perish when they got up in the
[50:45] morning and saw all the syrians
[50:48] surrounding their Camp you know if we
[50:50] could just have that isav tonight to say
[50:53] you know what if we could just see that
[50:54] there's more for us than there are
[50:57] against us just because we can't see
[50:59] them brothers and sisters you are
[51:01] compassed about with a great host of
[51:05] witness a tremendous cloud of witness
[51:07] and I think it's beautiful we could even
[51:08] tie that back into the cloud we saw in
[51:10] 1963 for some folks that is just a cloud
[51:13] that's just a picture that's just
[51:15] something a token that goes on the wall
[51:17] that is associated somehow with the
[51:19] ministry and and it's just a a
[51:21] supernatural event maybe and other
[51:23] people will have the explanation to say
[51:24] that maybe was a rocket or some sort of
[51:27] scientific explanation but the others
[51:29] will have the ability to say that's a a
[51:32] compassing cloud of witness of the life
[51:34] that we believe we understand what
[51:36] happened there and that was a blending
[51:39] of the ages we can see that you know
[51:41] what there's time was running out there
[51:43] and and we are now in a different age
[51:45] and at the end of brother bram's
[51:46] Ministry he said it very clearly that
[51:47] we're not in the leoan church age some
[51:50] folks will remain there but there's
[51:52] others that have gone into the bride age
[51:55] and what is it that does that brothers
[51:57] and sisters it's not greater preaching
[51:58] it's not uh uh fantastic Ministries it's
[52:01] not tenure in the message of of the hour
[52:04] it's truly having revelation of the word
[52:07] for our day that's what put people in
[52:10] the boat there was only eight Souls that
[52:12] were saved that got into the boat when
[52:14] Noah was around preaching his message
[52:17] and we know there's not very many people
[52:18] that are going to get in the boat so to
[52:20] speak in this age but there is a
[52:23] blending of the ages and we're so for to
[52:25] be able to be a part of it but tonight I
[52:27] just wanted to say to us brothers and
[52:29] sisters you know if we could just see
[52:31] this great this great cloud of witnesses
[52:34] that's around us let's just lay aside
[52:36] every weight let's just take the
[52:38] pressure off let's stop worrying about
[52:41] the problems and start focusing on the
[52:43] promise because if we could do that
[52:45] brothers and sisters our lives would
[52:47] become a little softer a little easier a
[52:51] little more more more able to be to Bear
[52:54] Our Lives and the troubles and the and
[52:56] the trials that we go through the devil
[52:58] wants us to believe that we're defeated
[53:00] but you know what we're preaching about
[53:02] we have been and we will continue to is
[53:04] that he is defeated he's the one that's
[53:07] defeated he knows it better than most
[53:09] theologians better than 90% of the
[53:12] theologians in this world Satan knows it
[53:15] assuredly that he is defeated and that
[53:17] if the true church can catch a
[53:20] revelation a true revelation of the word
[53:24] for their day
[53:26] then Satan will be powerless before her
[53:29] and we're going to read that tonight I
[53:30] think it's so beautiful we're just going
[53:32] to maybe do a little teeny recap and and
[53:35] then go forwards in our in our study of
[53:38] this book The the exposition of the
[53:40] seven Church ages um you know we we got
[53:44] into some real good stuff last time we
[53:46] just left off with paragraph 17 now
[53:48] remember this Christ in the true true
[53:50] church is a continuation of the book of
[53:53] Acts you know some people are saying
[53:55] that there's a real push to go back to
[53:59] Pentecost and truly I believe that some
[54:01] people are are doing that some people
[54:04] are real trying to to do that to say
[54:06] that if there's a manifestation of of
[54:09] one of the gifts of the Spirit we know
[54:10] there's there's many different gifts of
[54:12] the Spirit but if we can see a
[54:14] manifestation of the gift of the spirit
[54:16] then we'll know that we actually got it
[54:19] but that's what brother bradam preached
[54:21] against that's what the Holy Ghost in
[54:22] brother bradam preached against you know
[54:25] having an identification of a speaking
[54:27] in tongues doesn't mean that we're any
[54:30] closer to the Living God than any other
[54:33] gift and you know brother bradam says it
[54:36] in in his way you know why would you
[54:37] want to just have the tongue when you
[54:38] could have the whole shoe right if
[54:41] you've ever had a shoe you know there's
[54:43] a tongue inside the shoe why would you
[54:44] want to just have speaking in tongues
[54:47] when you could have a true revelation of
[54:49] the word for your day amen yes
[54:54] Hallelujah
[54:56] remember this Christ in the true church
[54:58] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[55:00] but the Book of Revelation shows how the
[55:02] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[55:04] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[55:07] formula powerless I think we talked
[55:08] about this last week and how you know
[55:10] many times we can look around and and
[55:12] say well this church and and that church
[55:15] and you know maybe even in our church
[55:16] well this brother he comes from that
[55:18] background and that brother comes from
[55:20] that background and you know I'll say it
[55:22] for me people might look at me and say
[55:24] well brother Barry comes from a
[55:26] Pentecostal background so he's got a
[55:27] little bit of a Pentecostal slant you
[55:29] know maybe maybe we all have our stories
[55:32] we all have our testimonies we all have
[55:34] our our history that that makes us up
[55:37] makes us who we are but you know I think
[55:40] that we can just rest assured that God
[55:42] who is rich in Mercy made certain that
[55:45] we came from exactly where we came from
[55:48] exactly how we came from where we came
[55:50] from and we had to go through all of the
[55:52] experiences that we've gone through to
[55:54] be exactly who we are in the day in
[55:56] which we live that gives us the ability
[55:59] to receive the word for our day but I
[56:01] think it's just beautiful because you
[56:03] know we can look at other people and say
[56:05] oh look at them they're lukewarm and oh
[56:07] look at them they're formal and
[56:10] Powerless you know what brothers and
[56:12] sisters if we do any of that then we
[56:14] need to stop I would say this and get to
[56:16] the Altar and get a real experience
[56:19] because we need to make sure that we're
[56:20] going inward this has to be an inward
[56:24] experience we got look inside and make
[56:25] sure that I'm not getting lukewarm
[56:28] formal and Powerless because as soon as
[56:30] we're starting to look outward and see
[56:31] other people doing that that's that
[56:33] Antichrist Spirit creeping into that
[56:35] church don't look at a church building
[56:37] don't look at an association look at
[56:38] your heart that's the church that's the
[56:41] building that God's Building remember
[56:42] brother Bram said it in the Rapture
[56:44] message he's not building a wall he's
[56:47] not going down through the centuries
[56:48] doing the same thing over and over again
[56:50] right now he's building a house and this
[56:52] house that he's building is a temple up
[56:54] of the Holy Ghost and you know Paul said
[56:57] it that we are the Temple of the Holy
[56:59] Ghost we don't have to go too far into
[57:02] that tonight but you know I I just think
[57:04] it's beautiful brother Bram a little
[57:05] further back in in this message just a
[57:07] little bit of a recap you know brother
[57:09] Bram he talks about how the devil
[57:11] actually gets a little uneasy in in his
[57:14] his meetings and and and how you see the
[57:16] most peculiar Expressions come over the
[57:19] faces of people when Satan knows he's
[57:21] just about to be exposed and and I'm not
[57:24] saying tonight I know I said it in the
[57:25] past that you can see it you can notice
[57:27] it in in preaching and you can when you
[57:29] hit on certain things you can see that
[57:31] people's countenances change and it's
[57:33] just the way it is you can see that in
[57:34] an in an experience when you're just
[57:35] having a conversation with somebody I'll
[57:38] give you an example of myself when you
[57:40] can see someone's countenance change you
[57:43] pick it up when brother Wayne Lawson was
[57:45] here last time I was sitting right about
[57:47] there uh uh he was preaching and the
[57:49] Lord was dealing with me with me in
[57:51] something real specific and and I had
[57:54] gone to a different planet in my mind
[57:57] and he perceived it while he was
[57:58] ministering he could see something was
[58:00] going on and and if you were to go back
[58:02] and listen to the recording you would
[58:04] hear Brother Wayne's voice say brother
[58:05] Barry is everything okay because he saw
[58:08] something happening my countenance
[58:10] changed it happens brothers and sisters
[58:13] you know when the word is coming forth
[58:15] God is dealing with us and and we're
[58:17] either actually having our heart touched
[58:20] like we sang or we're not but I think
[58:22] it's beautiful brother Bram he says it
[58:24] here he says you can see the faces of
[58:26] people when Satan knows he's going to be
[58:28] exposed now it isn't the people that I'm
[58:31] talking about isn't that
[58:34] beautiful it's important for us to
[58:36] recognize it we're talking about God or
[58:39] the devil right but the devil wants us
[58:41] to say no I'm talking about brother
[58:43] Henry no I'm talking about brother
[58:45] Daniel I'm talking about brother Joel
[58:46] brother dawn oh have you seen those
[58:48] Brothers no way as soon as we start
[58:51] doing that then we're giving the devil a
[58:53] day off we're playing right into his
[58:55] trap of
[58:57] deception I think that's the only way
[58:59] he's got a a a road in with us I mean I
[59:03] I think truly as Believers of this word
[59:06] we're too far down the road to be
[59:08] deceived by some sort of weird false
[59:10] Doctrine aren't
[59:12] we the Revelation is way too expansive
[59:15] this great cloud of witness that we are
[59:17] a part of is way too too bright and and
[59:21] clear to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[59:23] there's some people maybe in the world
[59:25] who would be truly elect seed of God
[59:28] that maybe haven't heard about the
[59:29] message of the hour that God sent a
[59:31] prophet and truly they will have the
[59:33] ability to hear it but we're not going
[59:35] to be deceived by that but I just think
[59:37] it's interesting he says now it isn't
[59:38] the people that I'm talking about it's
[59:40] that Satan has got a hold in their
[59:43] lives Satan can get a hold in our lives
[59:46] brothers and sisters through sin
[59:48] indifference and
[59:50] disease Satan will come and knock on our
[59:52] door he'll come and try and and shake
[59:55] the door he'll try that lock and see if
[59:57] that door is is shut and locked if it's
[59:59] sealed if it's got the token and you
[1:00:01] know he'll try us and God will allow it
[1:00:04] God will allow it just to see what we'll
[1:00:08] do I just think it's interesting you
[1:00:10] know if we talk about Sin you know sin
[1:00:13] is unbelief we know what that is it's
[1:00:15] not drinking it's not smoking it's not
[1:00:17] going out to the bar it's not looking at
[1:00:19] the wrong things it's not listening to
[1:00:21] the wrong things it's not even doing the
[1:00:23] wrong things even even though we know
[1:00:25] those are all attributes of sin but what
[1:00:27] is sin it took a prophet in our day to
[1:00:30] bring the true Clarity to this sin is
[1:00:33] unbelief unbelief in the word of God
[1:00:36] Amen yes amen the devil gets a hold of
[1:00:39] people's lives through sin and
[1:00:41] indifference and I think this one is
[1:00:43] real interesting it's always intrigued
[1:00:45] me and you know I'll probably harp on
[1:00:48] this for a while but I think it's real
[1:00:49] important for us as the Church of the
[1:00:51] Living God to recognize Satan's tactics
[1:00:54] and how he likes to get a hold of
[1:00:56] people's lives it's no accident that the
[1:00:59] prophet of God took and wrote this down
[1:01:02] the way that he did it gives us the
[1:01:04] ability to recognize his tactics and
[1:01:06] when we can recognize the enemy's
[1:01:07] tactics we can actually block them
[1:01:10] before he even gets in yes but
[1:01:12] indifference what's indifference the the
[1:01:15] definition of IND indifference is a lack
[1:01:17] of Interest concern or
[1:01:21] sympathy does anybody have indifference
[1:01:23] tonight
[1:01:25] there's times in my life where I've had
[1:01:27] indifference oh that brother's got a big
[1:01:29] problem in his life well you know what
[1:01:30] he actually walked into that and he
[1:01:32] pretty much deserves it so you know hey
[1:01:36] or that sister that that that thing that
[1:01:39] happens you know we can get indifference
[1:01:41] we we can look at it and say there's a
[1:01:43] prayer meeting coming up on Thursday
[1:01:44] night I just have a lack of interest in
[1:01:46] that you know we've prayed many times we
[1:01:48] haven't seen much happen you know maybe
[1:01:50] the way brother Barry does it or
[1:01:51] whatever it is you know it's just a lack
[1:01:53] of Interest or you know going to church
[1:01:55] on a Wednesday night it's just it's just
[1:01:57] a lack of Interest a communion service I
[1:01:59] just don't have the interest in that you
[1:02:01] know I I I believe I don't have to do
[1:02:03] that you know maybe but I would say this
[1:02:07] if it's in the word of God if the
[1:02:08] prophet of God brought it and said these
[1:02:09] are the things we need to do these are
[1:02:11] the ordinances that are going to change
[1:02:13] your life as a believer of this word uh
[1:02:15] do we have a lack of Interest or concern
[1:02:18] about it or even have sympathy for it or
[1:02:20] is it something that's the top of mind
[1:02:22] that's like we just can't wait to do it
[1:02:24] yes sir right that's how the devil gets
[1:02:27] in our lives through sin unbelief in the
[1:02:30] word indifference just having a lack of
[1:02:32] concern for the generality of what
[1:02:34] happens in the church maybe or or even
[1:02:36] in our families I've just got a lack of
[1:02:39] concern for my marriage I I've just got
[1:02:42] a lack of concern for my children
[1:02:43] because I'm busy man I've got a lot to
[1:02:45] do I got so much on my plate I've never
[1:02:48] had this much pressure in my
[1:02:50] life that's exactly where the devil
[1:02:52] wants us he wants us to get there so
[1:02:55] we're so busy we are indifferent about
[1:02:57] our marriage or about our family or
[1:02:59] about our church we don't have concern
[1:03:02] or sympathy for it because we've got so
[1:03:04] much
[1:03:05] problem take a step backwards brothers
[1:03:08] and sisters and say whoa what's going on
[1:03:10] in my life is this indifference do I
[1:03:12] have indifference because if I've got
[1:03:14] indifference the prophet of God said
[1:03:15] that's how Satan gets a hold in our
[1:03:17] lives man wow sometimes we just need to
[1:03:19] be shaken a little bit we need to look
[1:03:21] at this and say wow do I have IND
[1:03:24] and then disease we get illness in our
[1:03:27] bodies Satan will come around and God
[1:03:30] will allow it God will allow it and
[1:03:32] that's just to see what we'll do amen
[1:03:35] just to prove us a little bit I I think
[1:03:38] it's just beautiful because we will have
[1:03:40] a testimony if we're son and daughter of
[1:03:41] God if any one of those things gets a
[1:03:43] hold in our lives you know what we'll be
[1:03:44] delivered from it promise you you'll be
[1:03:47] delivered from it it won't stay it can't
[1:03:49] stay but remember brothers and sisters
[1:03:51] when when we feel like we're isolated
[1:03:53] and we feel like we're alone and and we
[1:03:56] just want to crawl under a rock because
[1:03:59] we feel like we're overwhelmed in a
[1:04:01] situation just go and read Hebrews 12:1
[1:04:05] wherefore seeing we are also compassed
[1:04:07] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:04:10] let's just lay aside every weight and
[1:04:12] the sin which doth so easily beset us
[1:04:16] and let us run with patience the race
[1:04:18] that's set before us to me this
[1:04:20] describes a marathon there's a few
[1:04:23] people I know that maybe have run in
[1:04:25] here tonight but you know a marathon
[1:04:27] you're not actually sprinting and
[1:04:29] running with all your energy you're just
[1:04:30] putting one foot in front of the other
[1:04:32] and sometimes it's almost like you're
[1:04:34] walking you're not even trying to run
[1:04:36] with all of your energy you're just
[1:04:38] putting one foot in front of the others
[1:04:40] and that's what we're doing we're
[1:04:41] running a marathon brothers and sisters
[1:04:42] all we've got to do is cross the finish
[1:04:44] line it's not a race against anybody
[1:04:46] else we're all at different Paces we
[1:04:48] just need to keep going we just need to
[1:04:50] keep running we just need to keep
[1:04:51] encouraging one another by the word of
[1:04:53] God when the devil comes around and says
[1:04:54] you're defeated you're alone you've got
[1:04:56] no hope you might as well give up and
[1:04:58] pack it in you might as well do exactly
[1:05:00] whatever it is that the word of God
[1:05:02] would say you shouldn't do just remember
[1:05:04] there is more surrounding you even in
[1:05:07] that moment than you can see with your
[1:05:09] eyes there's more for you than there are
[1:05:11] against you just start to speak the word
[1:05:14] start to remind Satan you know when he
[1:05:17] would come around and try and make us
[1:05:18] feel defeated when he would try and make
[1:05:21] us feel like we've made too great of an
[1:05:23] error all of that is the devil when he
[1:05:25] would try and make us afraid try and
[1:05:27] remind the devil of his future he I I
[1:05:30] just thought about it today I was having
[1:05:32] a conversation with him because he is
[1:05:33] just battling me just coming at me with
[1:05:36] my own stuff continually badgering me
[1:05:39] and I finally stopped I put down my tool
[1:05:41] I was in the shop where I actually study
[1:05:44] the most probably I just listen to the
[1:05:46] message and I absorb it and I'm pray and
[1:05:49] anyways I just stopped for a second and
[1:05:51] I said you know what Satan I I just I'm
[1:05:53] SI sick and tired of hearing you I just
[1:05:55] rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ I
[1:05:57] don't have to tolerate you but you know
[1:05:59] what I just want to remind you of your
[1:06:01] future you're trying to work me over
[1:06:03] here continually with these thoughts
[1:06:05] that are just ridiculous I just want to
[1:06:07] remind you about the Lake of Fire
[1:06:09] remember that you're you're going to be
[1:06:11] cast into a lake of fire but I also want
[1:06:13] to remind you of something else you know
[1:06:15] how smart you are you know many people
[1:06:17] would say brother Barry you're going a
[1:06:18] little bit too far with this but I just
[1:06:20] it just hit me and I think the Lord
[1:06:21] allowed me to see it today and maybe
[1:06:23] someone wants to dispute it but that's
[1:06:25] okay we can but isn't it interesting
[1:06:27] that it was the most religious people
[1:06:29] that put Jesus on the cross why did they
[1:06:31] do that they were influenced by someone
[1:06:33] and that's what I reminded Satan
[1:06:35] remember how smart you are you're the
[1:06:37] one that actually got Jesus put on that
[1:06:39] cross which was my
[1:06:41] Redemption thank you
[1:06:43] Satan thank you devil because of that
[1:06:47] because of what you did you actually
[1:06:49] bought my Redemption you actually pushed
[1:06:52] that down the road a little further we
[1:06:53] know that Jesus bought my Redemption
[1:06:55] Jesus bought your Redemption don't get
[1:06:57] me wrong but he could not see that Jesus
[1:07:00] was actually God the fullness of the
[1:07:02] godhead bodily in a man and what he did
[1:07:06] was he actually caused that to happen
[1:07:08] yes so I actually was thanking the devil
[1:07:11] today I said Thank You Satan for doing
[1:07:13] that for actually fulfilling Your Role
[1:07:14] because you were created to be destroyed
[1:07:16] you were created to be defeated but you
[1:07:18] know what I was created to sit and Rule
[1:07:21] and reign with him in his throne because
[1:07:23] I know that I'm going to overcome only
[1:07:25] because I believe in the word of God not
[1:07:27] because of anything that I could do
[1:07:28] because he is already overcome and I
[1:07:30] believe that's the only
[1:07:32] reason sometimes we just need to have a
[1:07:34] conversation with the devil when he
[1:07:35] comes around just try and remind him of
[1:07:38] his future he doesn't want to hear that
[1:07:39] very much brothers and sisters when you
[1:07:41] start talking about the Lake of Fire
[1:07:43] that he's going to be cast into it
[1:07:44] Revelations 20:10 and you just
[1:07:47] continually remind him of that and and
[1:07:49] how you are an overcome you can just
[1:07:51] continually Give Him scripture after
[1:07:53] scripture after scripture eventually
[1:07:54] he's going to leave yes sir and tonight
[1:07:56] I just want to maybe turn with me to to
[1:07:58] Luke chapter 4 just talk about this a
[1:08:00] little bit here
[1:08:02] um as we're getting
[1:08:05] going uh seems to be the way it is it's
[1:08:09] beautiful though Luke chapter 4 we'll
[1:08:13] just start reading with verse one the
[1:08:15] devil's coming around he's going to come
[1:08:17] around and come around and come around
[1:08:19] we're going to read it in this uh
[1:08:21] exposition of the seven Church ages Lord
[1:08:22] willing if we can get that far tonight
[1:08:25] uh but he's going to come around and
[1:08:27] Badger us right up until the time that
[1:08:29] he is going to be cast into the Lake of
[1:08:31] Fire he's not going to give up not one
[1:08:34] bit but what's going to happen is we're
[1:08:36] going to get stronger and stronger and
[1:08:38] we're going to become less and less
[1:08:39] tolerant to all of his tactics and the
[1:08:42] way that he operates and we're just
[1:08:43] going to put him on the run to the place
[1:08:45] where he's not even going to want to
[1:08:46] deal with
[1:08:47] us re uh sorry Luke 4 verse 1 and Jesus
[1:08:53] being being full of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:55] returned from Jordan and was led by the
[1:08:58] spirit Into the Wilderness being 40 days
[1:09:00] tempted of the devil and in those days
[1:09:03] he didn't eat he did in those days he
[1:09:07] did eat nothing and when they were ended
[1:09:09] he afterward hungered and the devil said
[1:09:12] unto him if thou be the Son of God
[1:09:14] command this stone that it be made
[1:09:17] bread so remember brothers and sisters
[1:09:19] he was tempted in all manners just like
[1:09:22] we are the devil spoke to Jesus yes sir
[1:09:27] and Jesus answered him saying it's
[1:09:29] written that man shall not live by bread
[1:09:31] alone but by every word of God
[1:09:35] Amen and the devil taking him up into a
[1:09:38] high mountain showed him all the
[1:09:39] kingdoms of the world in a moment of
[1:09:41] time and the devil said unto him all
[1:09:44] this power will I give thee and the
[1:09:46] glory of them for that is delivered unto
[1:09:50] me and to whomsoever I will give it
[1:09:55] if
[1:09:56] therefore Wilt worship if thou therefore
[1:09:59] Wilt worship me all shall be thine and
[1:10:03] Jesus answered and said unto him get
[1:10:05] thee behind me Satan for it is written
[1:10:08] Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and
[1:10:11] him only shalt thou serve amen and he
[1:10:14] brought him to Jerusalem and set him on
[1:10:16] a pinnacle of the temple and said unto
[1:10:18] him if thou be the Son of God cast
[1:10:20] thyself down from hence for it is
[1:10:24] written he shall give his angels charge
[1:10:26] over thee to keep thee and in their
[1:10:29] hands they shall bear thee up lest at
[1:10:31] any time thou Dash thy foot against a
[1:10:35] stone and Jesus answering said unto him
[1:10:39] it is said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
[1:10:42] thy God Amen and when the devil had
[1:10:46] ended all the Temptation he departed
[1:10:50] from him for a season I just wanted to
[1:10:53] highlight that part there brothers and
[1:10:55] sisters two parts one is when did this
[1:10:58] happen this happened once Jesus was
[1:11:00] filled with the Holy
[1:11:01] Ghost so you know we could say it sadly
[1:11:05] the battle really starts when we truly
[1:11:08] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[1:11:10] you know what we're still going to fight
[1:11:12] we're still going to battle even without
[1:11:13] the Holy Ghost in our lives and the only
[1:11:16] way we're going to overcome is with the
[1:11:17] Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost we're
[1:11:19] defeated we're defeated before we even
[1:11:21] start doesn't matter whether we try or
[1:11:22] whether we don't try without the Holy
[1:11:24] Ghost we're defeated so we have got to
[1:11:26] go forwards as Believers in our day and
[1:11:28] get the Holy Ghost in our lives but
[1:11:30] that's when the battle's going to come
[1:11:31] but brothers and sisters you don't have
[1:11:32] to take a thought for what you'll say
[1:11:34] because when you eat the book when you
[1:11:36] feed on the message of the hour when you
[1:11:38] read the Bible and pray you know what's
[1:11:40] going to happen when Satan comes around
[1:11:42] we're going to start to identify him
[1:11:43] we're going to start to see when we
[1:11:45] become a little bit indifferent we're
[1:11:46] going to start to see when we get an
[1:11:47] illness in our body we're going to start
[1:11:49] to see when unbelief comes around and
[1:11:51] starts to say maybe it isn't true that
[1:11:53] God sent a prophet or maybe there is an
[1:11:56] eighth messenger or maybe we could just
[1:11:57] stay home and listen to tapes all these
[1:12:00] different things are going to come
[1:12:01] around but we're going to have the
[1:12:02] ability to say you know what no way
[1:12:04] that's not what the word of God says I'm
[1:12:06] going to follow the word of God and
[1:12:08] that's what Jesus did here for it is
[1:12:10] also written but you know verse 13 says
[1:12:13] and when the devil had ended all the
[1:12:15] Temptation he wasn't getting anywhere
[1:12:17] with them what did he do it says the
[1:12:19] devil
[1:12:20] departed no different for us brothers
[1:12:22] and sisters just be steadfast stay in
[1:12:25] the word of God and don't give up when
[1:12:28] the Devil comes around and tempts us
[1:12:30] sore speak the word am speak back to the
[1:12:33] devil and tell him you don't don't say
[1:12:35] boo devil if you want to go ahead and do
[1:12:38] it but but just simply say you know what
[1:12:41] get lost I don't have to tolerate you
[1:12:44] get away from me in the name of Jesus
[1:12:46] Christ and he has to go and you know for
[1:12:49] those people that don't know maybe it'll
[1:12:51] take five minutes it's not like an app
[1:12:54] on our phone or or or maybe skip the
[1:12:56] dishes we can just dial and it just
[1:12:58] comes at a certain time it's going to
[1:13:00] take a little bit of time sometimes
[1:13:01] it'll be instantaneous and other times
[1:13:04] he'll linger but don't worry just speak
[1:13:07] the word and start to think about good
[1:13:09] thoughts start to think about the things
[1:13:11] that are lovely and the things that are
[1:13:13] pure and the things that are true and
[1:13:15] the things that are holy start to
[1:13:17] meditate on those things brothers and
[1:13:19] sisters because if they be in you you
[1:13:21] shall not fall amen Hallelujah but you
[1:13:24] know the devil came after him once he
[1:13:27] had the Holy Ghost but then there was a
[1:13:29] time where the devil departed but only
[1:13:30] for a season yes only for a season he he
[1:13:33] comes around and he comes around and
[1:13:35] he's going to shake us down and try and
[1:13:38] and Bug us and do as much as he can but
[1:13:39] just make sure you got the token once
[1:13:41] you got the token you got the best
[1:13:43] deadbolt system that there ever is
[1:13:45] there's no way that he can get through
[1:13:47] if you got the token he's just going to
[1:13:48] pass right past because he doesn't want
[1:13:50] nothing to do with that token brothers
[1:13:52] and sisters right but just remember
[1:13:53] there's there's ways that the devil gets
[1:13:55] into our lives it's through sin
[1:13:58] indifference and disease but you know
[1:14:00] what Satan will be exposed and and what
[1:14:03] is it it's a revelation by the Holy
[1:14:05] Ghost brother brandham says a little
[1:14:07] further down you know some people would
[1:14:08] say that maybe it's it's Witchcraft and
[1:14:10] and it's mind reading or telepathy but
[1:14:12] it's a revelation by the holy ghost that
[1:14:14] he has the ability to see that and
[1:14:16] there's only one way that we can see
[1:14:17] what we see in our day it's a revelation
[1:14:20] by the Holy Ghost it's just so important
[1:14:22] for us to remember remember that
[1:14:25] paragraph 18 further down just carrying
[1:14:27] on with what we're we're saying and
[1:14:30] where we're going it exposes
[1:14:34] Satan revealing his Works attempted
[1:14:37] destruction of God's people and the
[1:14:39] discrediting of God's word right down to
[1:14:42] the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:14:44] he fights that he cannot stand it he he
[1:14:46] won't give up he's always going to
[1:14:49] battle us brothers and sisters and the
[1:14:51] worst thing that he's going to do is try
[1:14:52] and dis credit God's word he's going to
[1:14:54] say that we can do it another way
[1:14:56] there's something else that we can do
[1:14:57] there's an alternative way maybe around
[1:15:00] the message of the hour something
[1:15:02] different we can do uh look at our
[1:15:04] brother look at our sister look at the
[1:15:06] ministry look at the pastor look at the
[1:15:08] deacons say this is wrong that's wrong
[1:15:10] the other thing is wrong what about the
[1:15:12] inward work you know one of the things
[1:15:14] that's the worst thing that can happen
[1:15:16] is to have a critical spirit and come
[1:15:18] into the church with it and then start
[1:15:20] to criticize when we're doing that
[1:15:22] brothers and sisters something's wrong
[1:15:23] inside something's wrong right here when
[1:15:26] we're doing
[1:15:31] that Jesus never criticized amen the
[1:15:35] Sinners the most puffed up religious
[1:15:38] ones he did yeah but he just brought the
[1:15:40] word to them he just brought the
[1:15:42] correction to them
[1:15:45] amen paragraph 19 says he knows that if
[1:15:48] the people get the true revelation of
[1:15:52] the true church and what she is what she
[1:15:56] stands
[1:15:57] for and that she can do the Greater
[1:15:59] Works she will be an invincible
[1:16:03] Army so he's not talking about some
[1:16:06] other future age and someone else
[1:16:08] somewhere in a different dimension he's
[1:16:12] talking about you tonight amen you call
[1:16:15] yourself the Bride of Jesus Christ yes
[1:16:17] you're the
[1:16:19] she if
[1:16:20] she gets the revelation
[1:16:24] the true revelation of the true church
[1:16:26] if she gets that and and what she is
[1:16:30] what is she the Bride of Jesus
[1:16:32] Christ M Jesus
[1:16:36] Christ her word is his word if she
[1:16:40] doesn't like it then then you can take
[1:16:43] it up with him but he's going to say hey
[1:16:45] she said it that's her word and her word
[1:16:48] is my word so you better deal with her
[1:16:50] right she can do the greater work she
[1:16:53] will be an invincible Army says if they
[1:16:56] get a true revelation of the two Spirits
[1:16:58] within the framework of the Christian
[1:16:59] church and by God's spirit discern and
[1:17:01] withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan
[1:17:03] will be powerless before her you he will
[1:17:07] be as definitely thwarted today as when
[1:17:09] Christ with stod his every effort to
[1:17:11] gain power over him in the desert just
[1:17:14] like we read about in Luke chter 4 by
[1:17:17] speaking the word the devil's going to
[1:17:19] talk to you he's going to shake you down
[1:17:21] but when you can speak the word back to
[1:17:23] him and recognize his tactics that he's
[1:17:25] going to come around and try and give us
[1:17:26] unbelief he's going to whisper in our
[1:17:28] ears oh that's a mistake and that's
[1:17:30] wrong oh maybe we should do something a
[1:17:32] little different maybe we know a little
[1:17:34] better or or a little less or whatever
[1:17:36] whatever it is sin indifference and
[1:17:38] disease if I could just have those three
[1:17:41] words remain with us tonight as we go
[1:17:43] forwards this week remember sin
[1:17:45] indifference and disease if we can see
[1:17:48] those we can recognize how he's coming
[1:17:50] around to try and get us paragraph 20
[1:17:52] says yes yes Satan hates Revelation but
[1:17:54] we love it with true Revelation in our
[1:17:57] lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:17:59] against us but we will prevail over them
[1:18:02] this is what we've been saying on
[1:18:04] Sundays you will recall that I mentioned
[1:18:06] at the beginning of this message that
[1:18:08] this book we are studying is the actual
[1:18:10] revelation of Jesus himself in the
[1:18:15] church and his work in the future
[1:18:18] ages then I mentioned that it takes the
[1:18:21] Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or
[1:18:25] we'll fail to get
[1:18:27] it bringing these two thoughts together
[1:18:31] you will see that it won't take just
[1:18:32] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[1:18:35] book real it's going to take the
[1:18:38] operation of the Holy
[1:18:40] Ghost brothers and sisters like I said
[1:18:44] before I'll say it again tonight I
[1:18:46] believe he's speaking about the word of
[1:18:47] God as well as this book that he has put
[1:18:50] together it's not just this book that
[1:18:53] he's put together even though it is but
[1:18:55] this book that he put together is the
[1:18:57] word of God I'm not saying we read this
[1:19:01] and say that this is going to be our
[1:19:02] Salvation right here what this book does
[1:19:04] is points back to the word of God yes
[1:19:07] and every every sentence in here every
[1:19:10] paragraph references the word of
[1:19:13] God but you know the only way that we're
[1:19:16] going to get it we're going to
[1:19:17] understand it is by Revelation by the
[1:19:19] spirit just like when we read the word
[1:19:21] of God the only way that can actually
[1:19:23] have Success reading the word of God is
[1:19:25] to have Revelation by the spirit that's
[1:19:29] why we continually say it you got to
[1:19:30] have Revelation Revelation Revelation
[1:19:32] but you got to have the Holy Spirit
[1:19:34] you've got to get baptized you got to
[1:19:36] repent and get baptized in the name of
[1:19:37] the Lord Jesus Christ according to acts
[1:19:39] 238 not entitles to actually get the
[1:19:42] Holy Ghost in your life and if you don't
[1:19:45] do that then how can you ever see the
[1:19:48] true Revelation the true meaning of the
[1:19:50] word but you know going on in what he
[1:19:53] says here it's going to take the
[1:19:54] operation of the Holy Ghost it's got to
[1:19:56] be revealed to
[1:19:58] us that means this book can't be
[1:20:00] revealed to anyone but a special class
[1:20:03] of
[1:20:05] people now that there I think is a real
[1:20:08] strong statement many people could look
[1:20:10] at that and say whoa hold on a second
[1:20:13] what makes anyone a special class we're
[1:20:17] talking about a country in the world and
[1:20:19] how that country really looks down on o
[1:20:21] other people other races and and
[1:20:24] according to your passports and I
[1:20:26] thought my is that even still around but
[1:20:29] I guess it is it's it's very much around
[1:20:33] but you know we're not talking about the
[1:20:34] literal skin color or or country of
[1:20:37] origin in this book that's not what
[1:20:39] we're saying about a special class of
[1:20:41] people it's not about how someone was
[1:20:43] taught manners at home it's not how
[1:20:45] maybe somebody had tenure in the message
[1:20:47] of the hour they were raised in the
[1:20:49] message of the hour and that causes them
[1:20:51] to be a special class of person we're
[1:20:53] not talking about that either we're
[1:20:55] talking about people who have the Holy
[1:20:57] Ghost in their lives people who have the
[1:20:59] operation of the Holy Ghost in their
[1:21:01] lives and what that means what is
[1:21:03] Operation of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:21:05] discernment yes sir when you hear
[1:21:07] something that comes into you there's
[1:21:09] something inside of us that filters that
[1:21:12] that shakes it down that pulls it apart
[1:21:14] that puts it back together again and
[1:21:15] says it's correct or it's incorrect
[1:21:19] discernment isn't just for the prophet
[1:21:21] discernment isn't just for evangelists
[1:21:24] or teachers or pastors discernment is
[1:21:27] for the children of God am discernment
[1:21:30] is by the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:21:32] operation of the Holy Ghost amen we've
[1:21:35] got to have that and that's what creates
[1:21:37] a special class of people to think that
[1:21:39] anybody else is a special class of
[1:21:41] person because of anything else is not
[1:21:44] understanding what this is saying here
[1:21:46] what what this special class of people
[1:21:48] are it's people that have the operation
[1:21:50] of the Holy Ghost in their lives amen
[1:21:53] and if we want to see where they got the
[1:21:55] operation of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:21:56] just take a look at the fruits of the
[1:21:57] spirit take a look at the Statue of the
[1:21:59] perfect man take a look at at
[1:22:01] Corinthians when when we can see where
[1:22:03] where love doesn't fail where we can see
[1:22:06] what charity actually is if we have
[1:22:09] those those attributes living out
[1:22:11] through our lives brothers and sisters
[1:22:13] then we'll know we've got the operation
[1:22:15] of the Holy Ghost because it's always
[1:22:16] going to point back to the word of God
[1:22:18] Amen it says that this book can't be
[1:22:21] revealed to anyone but a special class
[1:22:23] of people it will take one with
[1:22:25] prophetic
[1:22:26] Insight you've got to be a
[1:22:29] prophet you've got to have prophetic
[1:22:31] Insight how you going to do that outside
[1:22:33] of the Holy Ghost in your life it's not
[1:22:35] going to
[1:22:37] happen it will require the ability to
[1:22:40] hear from
[1:22:42] god wow and I think that's so so
[1:22:45] important for us brothers and sisters
[1:22:47] it's not coming to church it's not just
[1:22:48] what the preacher is going to preach has
[1:22:50] he heard from God well I I would
[1:22:52] certainly hope so I hope that he's heard
[1:22:54] from God but what about you have you
[1:22:56] heard from God anybody here heard from
[1:22:58] God this week I'm not looking for a show
[1:23:01] of hands but I'm just saying it brothers
[1:23:02] and sisters it's that important it's
[1:23:04] that pertinent it's that vital we have
[1:23:06] got to have our own relationship with
[1:23:08] God in our lives if we don't have that
[1:23:11] relationship then we're missing the
[1:23:12] point right amen it's not an association
[1:23:15] that's going to get us there it's got to
[1:23:17] be one with prophetic Insight it
[1:23:20] requires the ability to hear from God
[1:23:25] amen sometimes maybe pastors or
[1:23:28] preachers can fit the description I
[1:23:30] shouldn't say pastors I should just say
[1:23:32] preachers sometimes people just talk and
[1:23:34] talk and talk and talk and talk and talk
[1:23:36] and talk and talk and they don't ever
[1:23:39] take the time to
[1:23:40] listen but you know brothers and sisters
[1:23:42] I I've heard it said from a worldly man
[1:23:45] he said my dad taught me something and
[1:23:47] he always said Son there's a reason why
[1:23:50] you've got two of these and one of these
[1:23:54] we should be listening more than we
[1:23:55] should be
[1:23:57] talking and we know that the word of God
[1:23:59] says that we should be quick to listen
[1:24:01] quick to hear and slow to speak and if
[1:24:04] we're doing anything else something's
[1:24:07] wrong we need to make sure that we're
[1:24:09] actually following the word of God that
[1:24:11] we've got his life living out through us
[1:24:13] that we have Supernatural instruction
[1:24:16] and and brother bham says it will
[1:24:18] require Supernatural instruction it will
[1:24:20] require the ability to hear from God it
[1:24:23] will require Supernatural instruction
[1:24:25] not just a student comparing verse with
[1:24:28] verse though that's good we cannot study
[1:24:32] the word of God we cannot enter into the
[1:24:34] exposition of the seven Church ages and
[1:24:36] think that we're going to learn it just
[1:24:38] by going verse by verse by by paragraph
[1:24:41] by paragraph by Page by Page studying it
[1:24:44] like a student like we would at
[1:24:45] University that we were taught to do or
[1:24:47] in school like we were taught to do it's
[1:24:49] going to require prophetic Insight super
[1:24:52] natural instruction the ability to hear
[1:24:54] from God he says but a mystery requires
[1:24:58] the teaching of the spirit or it never
[1:25:00] becomes
[1:25:01] clear how we need to hear from God and
[1:25:03] lay ourselves open and become yielded to
[1:25:05] the spirit to hear and know you know
[1:25:07] brothers and sisters I can't help but
[1:25:08] think that if we never ever go on from
[1:25:12] just learning just studying verse to
[1:25:14] verse if we never go on to getting the
[1:25:16] token in our lives you know what will
[1:25:17] happen is we will actually become
[1:25:20] indifferent to the word of God right
[1:25:22] it will become something that's just you
[1:25:24] know whatever I know it I've heard it
[1:25:26] you know there's nothing that anybody's
[1:25:28] going to teach me we're not actually
[1:25:30] getting Supernatural instruction by the
[1:25:32] spirit and that's what happens when we
[1:25:34] come to church we want Supernatural
[1:25:36] instruction by the spirit amen that song
[1:25:38] that we sang no one else can touch my
[1:25:40] heart like you do is that true in our
[1:25:43] lives nobody else the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:45] when we come to church and we worship
[1:25:47] him can he touch his can he touch our
[1:25:50] heart paragraph 22 says as I have
[1:25:53] already said the Book of Revelation is a
[1:25:55] consummation of the scriptures that
[1:25:58] means it's coming together and making it
[1:26:00] one it's even placed exactly right in
[1:26:03] the cannon of scripture at the
[1:26:05] end now you can know why it says that
[1:26:10] Anyone who reads or even hears it is
[1:26:12] blessed amen amen it's the revelation of
[1:26:15] God that will give you authority over
[1:26:18] the devil Hallelujah the revelation of
[1:26:21] God and and I just think it this way I
[1:26:24] want to say it this way tonight I just
[1:26:26] want to try and make it relevant to us
[1:26:28] in our day it's not just a book from
[1:26:29] 1965 or maybe even a 1960 when he
[1:26:33] preached these these messages but
[1:26:35] brothers and sisters it it it will it
[1:26:37] will take the revelation of God that
[1:26:39] will give you the authority over the
[1:26:41] devil do we have the revelation of God
[1:26:43] for us in our lives that's the Holy
[1:26:46] Ghost the only way we get the Holy Ghost
[1:26:49] is to get baptized in the name of the
[1:26:50] Lord Jesus Christ and I know that we're
[1:26:51] there I I I just want to encourage
[1:26:53] anyone that maybe hasn't been able to do
[1:26:56] that to take a look at that brother Ram
[1:26:59] goes on to say and you see why they who
[1:27:01] would add to or take from would be
[1:27:06] cursed it would have to be so for who
[1:27:08] can add or take away from the perfect
[1:27:10] revelation of God and overcome the
[1:27:14] enemy it's it is that
[1:27:16] simple we cannot add to it or take away
[1:27:19] from it we can't say that the the
[1:27:21] exposition of the word the revelation of
[1:27:23] Jesus Christ through the Vindicated
[1:27:25] prophet in our day I can just take and
[1:27:27] and make the the message something else
[1:27:29] I I I can just study it and and maybe do
[1:27:32] something different than what the
[1:27:33] prophet said if we're doing anything
[1:27:35] different than what William Mary and
[1:27:37] brandham said then brothers and sisters
[1:27:38] leave it alone leave it alone if you see
[1:27:41] people trying to influence you to do
[1:27:43] something different than what William
[1:27:44] Mar and bradam said leave it alone amen
[1:27:47] it's not going to do anything for you it
[1:27:49] will take you away from the
[1:27:51] word brother bam says it's that simple
[1:27:54] there is nothing of such prevailing
[1:27:56] power as the revelation of the
[1:28:00] word verse or or paragraph 23 see in
[1:28:04] verse three a blessing is pronounced on
[1:28:07] those who give special attention to this
[1:28:09] book I think this refers to the Old
[1:28:11] Testament custom of the priests reading
[1:28:13] the word to the congregation in the
[1:28:15] morning you see many could not read so
[1:28:18] the priest had to read to them as long
[1:28:21] as it was the word the blessing was
[1:28:23] there it didn't matter if it was read or
[1:28:27] heard and tonight brothers and sisters
[1:28:29] we've all been given the ability we have
[1:28:31] the blessing of being able to read and
[1:28:33] if anybody here doesn't have the ability
[1:28:36] to read I do apologize but I think for
[1:28:38] the most part most of us uh have the
[1:28:41] ability to read the word so we can hear
[1:28:43] it spoken but we also need to eat it we
[1:28:45] need to read it and that's how we eat
[1:28:47] the book John was instructed in
[1:28:49] Revelations chap 4 to take the book and
[1:28:51] eat eat it up and and you know sorry it
[1:28:54] might be a little further in Revelations
[1:28:56] but he was instructed to take the book
[1:28:57] and eat it and that's how we eat it
[1:28:59] today that's by reading
[1:29:01] it paragraph 24 says the time is at hand
[1:29:05] the time was not at hand previously in
[1:29:08] the wisdom and economy of God this
[1:29:11] Mighty
[1:29:13] Revelation though fully known to God
[1:29:16] could not come forth hither to thus we
[1:29:19] immediately learn a principle
[1:29:22] the revelation of God for each age can
[1:29:26] come in that age only and at a specific
[1:29:31] time I think we could just dwell on that
[1:29:33] for a while you know looking at where
[1:29:36] we're at we look back and we can see the
[1:29:37] first and second polls we can see the
[1:29:40] justification the sanctification but
[1:29:43] then there's the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:44] Ghost where it's a spoken word condition
[1:29:46] where we have the ability to speak the
[1:29:48] word and know that God's going to back
[1:29:50] it up for us we don't have to to try and
[1:29:52] back it up we don't have anything to try
[1:29:54] and perform we just need to know that
[1:29:55] we're going to speak the word according
[1:29:57] to the word when we do that brothers and
[1:30:00] sisters that's when the devil trembles
[1:30:02] that's when the devil ain't going to
[1:30:03] have no part of you when you can speak
[1:30:05] the word according to the word not be
[1:30:08] like James when we speak the word when
[1:30:10] we go to him in prayer and you know many
[1:30:12] times our prayers aren't answered the
[1:30:13] way that we want it to happen it's
[1:30:15] because we want to consume it upon our
[1:30:17] lust we're asking about our our
[1:30:20] carnality and and maybe
[1:30:22] spirituality but you know we got to go
[1:30:24] further than that we got to get into our
[1:30:25] soul ality we got to get into that Soul
[1:30:28] realm and we've said it I don't know
[1:30:30] when but when we're praying from our
[1:30:32] souls brothers and sisters it's a
[1:30:34] different realm it's a different
[1:30:35] conversation Al together than than when
[1:30:37] we're dealing with the the the things
[1:30:40] that we deal with in our world in our
[1:30:42] jobs in our schools or badgering us in
[1:30:44] our mind when we're trying to pray and
[1:30:45] breakr and then we've got our own
[1:30:48] natural abilities and disabilities that
[1:30:51] get in the way of our prayers but when
[1:30:52] we just break through that's breaking
[1:30:54] through into that place where it's no
[1:30:57] longer us praying where it's the Lord
[1:30:59] praying through US brothers and sisters
[1:31:01] that's a a totally different
[1:31:05] conversation but brother banam he says
[1:31:07] it thus we immediately learn a principle
[1:31:08] the revelation of God for each age can
[1:31:10] come in that age only and at a specific
[1:31:13] time and isn't it wonderful to think
[1:31:15] that we have been called in this very
[1:31:17] specific time to be recipients of this
[1:31:20] message of the hour in its fullness amen
[1:31:23] there's no more mystery if there's a
[1:31:25] mystery according to the message of the
[1:31:27] hour then there's a problem brothers and
[1:31:29] sisters the the Mysteries have all been
[1:31:31] explained and unraveled and tied up
[1:31:34] again there's no more mystery paragraph
[1:31:37] 25 says look at the history of Israel
[1:31:39] the revelation of God to Moses came only
[1:31:42] at a specific time of history and even
[1:31:45] more specifically it came as the people
[1:31:48] Cried unto
[1:31:49] God Jesus himself self came at the
[1:31:53] fullness of time he being the complete
[1:31:56] revelation of the
[1:31:59] godhead and in this age
[1:32:02] leoan the revelation of God will come in
[1:32:06] its due time it will not falter neither
[1:32:10] will it be
[1:32:11] premature think on this and heed it well
[1:32:14] for we are in the end time
[1:32:18] today think on this and heed it well
[1:32:21] isn't it wonderful to think that that we
[1:32:23] have been called we we don't even have
[1:32:26] anything that we've got to do we just
[1:32:27] have to believe it we just have to
[1:32:29] accept it and believe it ask the Lord
[1:32:32] for that Supernatural instruction ask
[1:32:35] for the true Revelation according to the
[1:32:37] word brothers and sisters when we get
[1:32:38] into that prayer and you know the Bible
[1:32:40] will become a new book to us amen the
[1:32:44] salutation he says John to the seven
[1:32:47] churches which are in Asia Grace be unto
[1:32:49] you and peace from him which is and
[1:32:51] which was and which is to come and from
[1:32:53] the seven spirits which are before his
[1:32:56] throne and from Jesus Christ who is the
[1:32:59] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:33:02] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[1:33:03] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[1:33:06] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[1:33:10] and hath made us Kings and Priests unto
[1:33:13] God and his father to him be glory and
[1:33:16] Dominion forever and ever amen now
[1:33:20] brother Bram he goes into to explain in
[1:33:22] a bit about this here he says in
[1:33:23] paragraph 26 the word Asia is actually
[1:33:26] Asia Minor it's a small parcel of land
[1:33:29] about the size of Indiana the seven
[1:33:31] churches there were Especial excuse me
[1:33:34] especially picked from all other
[1:33:36] churches for their characteristics which
[1:33:39] same characteristics would be found in
[1:33:41] the successive ages centuries later the
[1:33:45] seven spirits Before the Throne is the
[1:33:47] spirit that was in each of the seven
[1:33:50] Messengers given giving them their
[1:33:52] Ministries for the age in which they
[1:33:55] lived now all these Expressions him
[1:33:59] which is and which was and which is to
[1:34:02] come and faithful witness and the earth
[1:34:06] and the alpha and sorry faithful witness
[1:34:10] and the firstborn from among the dead
[1:34:13] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[1:34:15] and the Alpha and Omega and the almighty
[1:34:18] are titles and description to
[1:34:21] descriptions of the one and same person
[1:34:25] who is the Lord Jesus Christ who washed
[1:34:28] us from our sins in his own blood it's
[1:34:32] so easy when you look at that and you
[1:34:34] start to read it it sounds so busy and
[1:34:36] we know that's where the devil gets in
[1:34:37] is where we have so many details and and
[1:34:40] the way the descriptive words are verse
[1:34:43] or chapter 29 the spirit of God in John
[1:34:46] Expresses thusly in order to set forth
[1:34:49] the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ and to
[1:34:52] reveal the godhead as one God today
[1:34:57] there is a gross error it is that there
[1:35:00] are three Gods instead of one amen this
[1:35:03] Revelation is given to John by Jesus
[1:35:06] himself corrects that
[1:35:08] error it's not that there are three Gods
[1:35:12] but one God in three offices there is
[1:35:15] one God with three titles Father Son and
[1:35:19] Holy Ghost this Mighty Revelation is
[1:35:22] what the early church had and it must be
[1:35:24] restored in this last day along with the
[1:35:27] correct formula of water baptism
[1:35:31] amen now modern theologians won't agree
[1:35:34] with me for here is what is written in a
[1:35:36] great Christian
[1:35:37] magazine that teaching on the Trinity is
[1:35:40] at the very heart and core of the Old
[1:35:43] Testament it is every wit as much at the
[1:35:46] heart and core of the New Testament the
[1:35:49] New Testament is just as much opposed as
[1:35:52] the Old Testament is to the thought that
[1:35:54] there are more Gods than one yet the New
[1:35:58] Testament with equal clearness teaches
[1:36:01] that the father is God the son is God
[1:36:04] the holy spirit is God and these three
[1:36:07] are not three aspects of the same person
[1:36:10] but are three persons standing in a
[1:36:13] truly personal relationship to one
[1:36:16] another there we have the great doctrine
[1:36:20] of the three persons
[1:36:21] but one
[1:36:23] God I never really experienced this
[1:36:27] myself until just the other day I had
[1:36:30] someone try and and and find out what I
[1:36:34] believe and and they wound up actually
[1:36:37] calibrating me into a Oneness Doctrine
[1:36:39] that's that's where they were able to
[1:36:41] comprehend me to be living pigeon hold
[1:36:44] me into there but I just said what
[1:36:46] brother bradam said in here and you know
[1:36:48] it's not the trinitarian doctrine that
[1:36:50] there's three persons there's three
[1:36:53] attributes there's three characteristics
[1:36:55] there's three offices there's three
[1:36:57] manifestations of The Same Spirit in
[1:36:59] three different
[1:37:02] offices and there's one
[1:37:04] God and you know people want to try and
[1:37:07] and pinpoint where you're at with that
[1:37:09] and so does the devil because the devil
[1:37:12] can get you off from actually being
[1:37:14] where you need to be then that's okay it
[1:37:16] doesn't care what side of the road you
[1:37:17] are what ditch you fall into so long as
[1:37:20] you get into a ditch but I said to him
[1:37:22] you know I I understand that and I
[1:37:24] understand that but you know where we're
[1:37:25] at where I'm at is right down the middle
[1:37:28] I believe that there's three
[1:37:30] manifestations in one God he is a father
[1:37:33] and he is a son and he does have the
[1:37:35] Holy Spirit and and we were in a a group
[1:37:38] of people and I had to say it to him I
[1:37:40] couldn't believe the way he kind of came
[1:37:41] at me guns blazing we were at a school
[1:37:44] event and I had to say to him you know
[1:37:46] what if we said if I said it right now
[1:37:48] how many fathers are there here in the
[1:37:50] midst
[1:37:51] and there was a whole bunch of parents
[1:37:53] with their children you know many people
[1:37:55] would have to raise their hands and say
[1:37:56] I'm a father so how can you say
[1:37:58] someone's name by saying father and just
[1:38:01] the same with the son how could you say
[1:38:03] Sons how many sons are here how many
[1:38:06] kids would put up their hands the devil
[1:38:08] has this made so completely clear and
[1:38:11] the reason it's so strong in people's
[1:38:13] lives is because they've gone and
[1:38:15] they've paid good money for an education
[1:38:17] that's taught them this is the way it is
[1:38:19] this is what we believe this is the
[1:38:20] curriculum this is everything that we've
[1:38:22] believed this is what we've been taught
[1:38:23] this is what the fathers were taught
[1:38:25] this is the way it is eat it it's good
[1:38:28] but you know what it is you're
[1:38:29] scratching around like chickens in a
[1:38:31] chicken yard not recognizing that this
[1:38:33] isn't really the truth but there's
[1:38:36] something in the heart of a True
[1:38:37] Believer that can say I could just never
[1:38:39] understand that I can never comprehend
[1:38:41] how that would work because the spirit
[1:38:44] is trying to operate through our lives
[1:38:46] and you know eventually we hear that
[1:38:48] scream of the eagle and we look up and
[1:38:51] we say wow I can I can see with both of
[1:38:54] my eyes up do you know that chickens
[1:38:56] specifically have the ability to see the
[1:38:59] ground with one eye and the sky or
[1:39:01] anything else with the other eye that's
[1:39:02] why they Bob their heads around so much
[1:39:05] but eagles they can see with both their
[1:39:08] eyes they've got tremendous Vision they
[1:39:11] can look up and they can see Mama eagle
[1:39:13] flying in the sky and hear that sound
[1:39:16] recognize that sound just jump just take
[1:39:18] one jump that's what brother brandham
[1:39:20] says Holy Ghost is screaming to us just
[1:39:22] take one jump towards him and I want to
[1:39:25] say it tonight brothers and sisters
[1:39:26] maybe if we've had an experience and
[1:39:28] it's just growing a little bit cold
[1:39:30] don't stay there just take one jump to
[1:39:32] him just jump to him tonight and say
[1:39:35] Lord F me let me lift my cup unto you
[1:39:38] and just top me up Lord we know that
[1:39:40] there was one difference between the 10
[1:39:42] virgins right the five wise and the five
[1:39:44] unwise they both had oil they both
[1:39:46] slumbered and slept they both were
[1:39:47] virgins but only one had enough oil amen
[1:39:51] that's why we come to church that's why
[1:39:52] we feed on the word of God so that we
[1:39:54] can get enough oil in our cup brothers
[1:39:56] and sisters we might not even make it
[1:39:57] till
[1:39:59] tomorrow make sure we've got enough oil
[1:40:01] in our
[1:40:05] cup but it's beautiful how this is we've
[1:40:08] been given the ability to see this by
[1:40:10] the revelation of the spirit in our
[1:40:12] lives modern theologians won't agree
[1:40:15] with me paragraph 30 for here is what is
[1:40:19] written in a great Christian magazine
[1:40:21] that teaching on Trinity is at the very
[1:40:24] heart and core of the Old Testament it's
[1:40:27] not at the very heart and core of the
[1:40:29] Old Testament it's at the very heart and
[1:40:31] core of the curriculum that's given
[1:40:34] through theologians in the theological
[1:40:36] study books that's what it is and it
[1:40:38] comes from the nian council we'll get
[1:40:40] into that and and we'll actually pull up
[1:40:42] some actual documentation from the nian
[1:40:46] council and will show that that's
[1:40:47] exactly where it came brother bradam
[1:40:49] says that there was a two-way split
[1:40:50] split and one was actually the the
[1:40:53] Oneness Doctrine and the other one was
[1:40:56] the the trinitarian doctrine and that's
[1:40:58] where it happened in 320 ad the nian
[1:41:01] council that happened and you know what
[1:41:03] brothers and sisters it's beautiful
[1:41:04] because brother bradam he says it that
[1:41:06] there is going to be another nian
[1:41:09] Council there is going to be another one
[1:41:11] and he even says so far I pretty sure he
[1:41:14] says thus sayith the Lord it will happen
[1:41:17] and you know what's going to happen when
[1:41:19] that happens I I trust that we won't
[1:41:21] even be here for it but you never know
[1:41:23] what could happen there's already a a
[1:41:25] church in Saudi Arabia I believe it is
[1:41:29] that's called the abrahamic house and it
[1:41:31] has the blessing of the Pope and it's
[1:41:34] got the the I don't know what it is from
[1:41:38] Islam all of them are coming together in
[1:41:41] one the Protestant churches as well
[1:41:43] brothers and sisters one Church One Roof
[1:41:46] a one universal church imagine that yeah
[1:41:50] and back in the 60s we had a prophet
[1:41:53] declaring that there's going to be
[1:41:55] another nyine Council they're going to
[1:41:56] come together and they're going to unite
[1:41:58] together under one banner and you know
[1:42:00] they're going to think they're actually
[1:42:01] worshiping God and who are they going to
[1:42:03] be worshiping the God of this evil age
[1:42:05] they're not even going to recognize that
[1:42:07] God's not even going to hear their
[1:42:08] prayer he's not even going to be
[1:42:09] interested in what's going
[1:42:12] on but Blessed Be Your Eyes brothers and
[1:42:16] sisters because you can see the things
[1:42:18] of God you can hear the revelation of
[1:42:21] the spirit when when the spirit speaks
[1:42:23] expressly unto his bride we have been
[1:42:26] given the ability to hear it it's the
[1:42:27] greatest thing that we could ever get in
[1:42:29] our lives and and you know the next best
[1:42:31] thing is our our our our marriages the
[1:42:34] Lord to give us our salvation but then
[1:42:36] to give us our marriages to give us our
[1:42:38] our wives our beautiful brides and to
[1:42:41] recognize that that's the greatest thing
[1:42:43] that he could give us outside of our
[1:42:45] Salvation my goodness how much we have
[1:42:47] to be thankful for and for all those
[1:42:50] people who are looking for brides you
[1:42:52] know what God has one in store for you
[1:42:54] you don't have to worry there's no need
[1:42:57] to panic and get excited and go and do
[1:42:59] anything too rash too irrational just
[1:43:02] trust the Lord with all your heart and
[1:43:04] lean not unto your own understanding but
[1:43:07] let the operation of the Spirit come
[1:43:09] through you and happen in your life and
[1:43:11] you know how can you how could you ever
[1:43:13] do that if you didn't have the Holy
[1:43:15] Ghost in your life if you didn't have
[1:43:17] the token applied to your your your your
[1:43:20] lentil and and your doorposts it's just
[1:43:22] impossible that's why I don't think that
[1:43:24] we could ever overemphasize Revelation
[1:43:27] by the spirit it's not Revelation by the
[1:43:29] church or or by the pastor it's
[1:43:31] Revelation by the spirit the only way
[1:43:33] you're going to get the spirit is to
[1:43:34] actually follow the word for your day
[1:43:37] and everything will work out right once
[1:43:38] you get the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:43:39] brothers and sisters I I promise it will
[1:43:42] it it's just it's it's not easy it's not
[1:43:45] easy the Holy Ghost isn't just a a
[1:43:48] ticket to paradise and and there's no
[1:43:50] more problems in your life we read about
[1:43:52] it earlier that's where it actually gets
[1:43:54] hard but that's going to give you the
[1:43:55] overcoming power amen every single one
[1:43:58] of us in this flesh we've got a date
[1:43:59] with Destiny we're going to go into the
[1:44:01] grave unless the Lord takes us in the
[1:44:02] Rapture and you know brother Bram talks
[1:44:05] about having life Assurance a and many
[1:44:07] people are talking about life insurance
[1:44:09] but life Assurance it means that even
[1:44:12] though this body will get into the
[1:44:14] graveyard there's one thing that
[1:44:15] assurance that Blessed assurance that
[1:44:17] Jesus is mine that will get us out of
[1:44:19] the graveyard and that's what we're
[1:44:21] looking for we're not looking for a an
[1:44:24] easy excuse to get out of our our
[1:44:26] problems in our lives but we just want
[1:44:27] to know that we'll be able to overcome
[1:44:29] and then we'll sit with him in his
[1:44:30] throne amen let's just close
[1:44:33] tonight maybe stand with me as we just
[1:44:37] have a word of prayer gracious Heavenly
[1:44:39] Father we thank you for the mighty
[1:44:42] Revelations that you've given to us
[1:44:44] thank you for this word Lord that we've
[1:44:48] read tonight father as we read read the
[1:44:51] the the Book of Revelation and we study
[1:44:53] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:44:56] and we know that there was a man on
[1:44:58] Earth that he he heard you T say to him
[1:45:01] pick up your pen and
[1:45:03] write father we know that that's part of
[1:45:06] what's in this book Lord we pray that we
[1:45:09] could just have the operation of the
[1:45:11] spirit in our lives Lord that we could
[1:45:13] understand these Revelations that they
[1:45:16] would become clear to us that we would
[1:45:18] recognize that it's not a man saying
[1:45:20] that he was given a special pair of
[1:45:22] glasses and and some other Revelation
[1:45:25] came down and now we're mixing anything
[1:45:28] different with the word of God we're not
[1:45:30] hybridizing your word it's truly your
[1:45:33] word father what an honor and and a
[1:45:35] blessing it is a privilege father to to
[1:45:38] get Revelation by the spirit what
[1:45:40] greater thing could you have a a man on
[1:45:43] this side of Eternity encourage other
[1:45:46] men and women to do than to get the Holy
[1:45:48] Ghost in their lives father I don't know
[1:45:51] anything and I thank you for that I
[1:45:53] thank you for the desire that you've
[1:45:55] given me Lord to preach the Holy Ghost
[1:45:58] father to see that Lord it takes the
[1:46:01] operation of the spirit and that's not
[1:46:02] something that we can do we can't just
[1:46:04] wave our wand and say it's time for the
[1:46:06] spirit to move we need to yield
[1:46:08] ourselves and and make ourselves yielded
[1:46:10] and open unto you and just invite you to
[1:46:13] to to reveal these things to us Lord and
[1:46:16] when you do father oh lord it's so
[1:46:18] wonderful because it always lines up
[1:46:20] with you your word and father then we
[1:46:22] have such an easy time to Rejoice such
[1:46:24] an easy time to praise you and worship
[1:46:26] you because we know that we have the
[1:46:28] operation of the spirit in our lives
[1:46:30] that we have that conversation where we
[1:46:32] speak unto you and you speak back to us
[1:46:34] we hear from you Lord father what a
[1:46:37] privilege to hear from you Lord tonight
[1:46:40] I pray that Lord somehow the words that
[1:46:42] were spoken would just be an
[1:46:43] encouragement to your children father
[1:46:45] that we would go away from here with
[1:46:47] encouragement in our lives Lord that we
[1:46:49] would look to you just a little more
[1:46:51] earnestly maybe father and Lord we just
[1:46:54] thank you for meeting all of the needs
[1:46:56] that were mentioned to you tonight Lord
[1:46:58] all of the requests that were expressed
[1:47:00] unto you father that you could just
[1:47:02] express your life to us and through
[1:47:04] those needs Lord father we pray that you
[1:47:07] would just be with those who who need a
[1:47:09] touch from you father who maybe weren't
[1:47:11] mentioned tonight father Lord there's
[1:47:13] many in our lives I know my dad and his
