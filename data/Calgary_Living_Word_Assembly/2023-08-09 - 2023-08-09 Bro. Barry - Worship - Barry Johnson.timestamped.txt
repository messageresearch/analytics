[51:55] tonight
[51:57] thank you musicians
[51:59] certainly appreciate each gift
[52:02] you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to
[52:04] read from Saint John chapter 4.
[52:07] very familiar scripture
[52:09] I would like to take it from a little
[52:11] bit of a different angle tonight we'll
[52:13] just start reading with verse one
[52:17] Saint John chapter 4.
[52:21] trust that the Lord will speak to us
[52:28] it's a story of the woman at Samaria the
[52:30] woman at the well
[52:32] and uh
[52:34] let's start with verse one Saint John
[52:37] chapter 4.
[52:40] when therefore the Lord knew how the
[52:42] Pharisees had heard
[52:44] that Jesus made
[52:47] and baptized more disciples than John
[52:51] though Jesus himself
[52:53] baptized not but his disciples
[52:58] he left Judea and departed into Galilee
[53:03] excuse me and he must needs go through
[53:05] Samaria
[53:08] then cometh he to a city of Samaria
[53:10] which is called saikar near the parcel
[53:12] of ground that Jacob gave to his son
[53:14] Joseph
[53:16] now Jacob's Well was there
[53:19] Jesus therefore being worried with his
[53:21] journey
[53:22] sat thus on the well
[53:25] and it was about the sixth hour
[53:28] to cometh the woman of Samaria to draw
[53:30] water Jesus saith unto her give me a
[53:32] drink
[53:33] for his disciples were gone away unto
[53:36] the city to buy meat
[53:38] then saith the woman of Samaria unto him
[53:42] how is it that thou being a Jew ask is
[53:45] drink of me
[53:47] which I'm a woman of Samaria
[53:50] for the Jews have no dealings with the
[53:52] Samaritans
[53:53] Jesus answered and said unto her
[53:56] if thou knewest the gift of God
[53:58] and who it is that saith to thee give me
[54:01] to drink
[54:02] thou would have have asked him
[54:06] and he would have given the Living Water
[54:10] the woman saith unto him sir thou has
[54:13] nothing to draw with and the well is
[54:14] deep from Once then hast thou that
[54:17] Living Water
[54:19] art thou greater than our father Jacob
[54:21] which gave us the well and drank thereof
[54:24] himself
[54:25] and his children and his cattle
[54:28] Jesus answered and said unto her
[54:31] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[54:33] thirst again
[54:35] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[54:37] I shall give him shall never thirst but
[54:40] the water that I give him shall be in
[54:42] him a well
[54:44] of water springing up into everlasting
[54:48] life
[54:50] the woman saith unto him sir give me
[54:52] this water that I thirst not neither
[54:54] come hither to draw
[54:56] Jesus said saith unto her go call thy
[54:59] husband and come hither
[55:01] the woman answered and said I have no
[55:03] husband
[55:05] Jesus saith unto her thou Hast well said
[55:07] I have no husband for thou Hast had five
[55:11] husbands and he whom thou now has is not
[55:14] thy husband in that setest thou truly
[55:18] the woman saith unto him sir I perceive
[55:21] that thou art a prophet our fathers
[55:24] worshiped in this mountain and ye say
[55:27] that in Jerusalem is the place where men
[55:31] ought to worship
[55:32] Jesus saith unto her woman believe me
[55:37] the hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[55:39] this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[55:42] worship the father
[55:45] ye worship ye know not what
[55:49] we know what we worship for salvation is
[55:52] of the Jews
[55:54] but the hour cometh and now is
[55:57] when the true worshipers shall worship
[56:00] the father in spirit and in truth
[56:04] for the father seeketh such to worship
[56:06] Him
[56:07] God is a spirit
[56:09] and they that worship Him
[56:11] must worship Him
[56:13] in spirit and in truth
[56:17] let's just bow in prayer
[56:19] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[56:21] for this word we thank you for this
[56:23] story Lord
[56:24] we thank you for the unveiling of God
[56:28] because we know that when you came in
[56:31] the form of Jesus Christ you were the
[56:33] unveiling of God and Lord we know that
[56:36] you change not and that you are the same
[56:39] yesterday today and forever and as we
[56:41] read this word father as we pursue you
[56:44] through this word Lord Jesus we know
[56:46] that you unveil yourself
[56:48] layer by layer day by day service by
[56:52] service word by word song by song Father
[56:55] we come to know you in a greater way and
[56:58] father tonight is no different we just
[57:00] desire to know you a little more to come
[57:03] a little closer father to go a little
[57:05] higher and we just invite you father to
[57:07] just break this bread of life unto us
[57:09] once again
[57:11] will be careful to give you all the
[57:12] praise Lord
[57:14] just ask all these things in Jesus
[57:16] Christ's name we pray amen
[57:18] I bless you tonight you may be seated
[57:24] a couple of announcements we have
[57:26] confirmed with brother Andrew he will be
[57:29] here Friday evening and we'll have two
[57:31] services this weekend
[57:33] it's been interesting because he uh I
[57:36] think he's he got really sick recently
[57:39] he was preaching at a a youth camp
[57:41] and he said to me this week that he had
[57:44] bronchitis and a sinus infection and he
[57:48] was actually going to fly into
[57:50] Edmonton and then come down to Calgary
[57:52] and he had to cancel the service in
[57:55] Edmonton so that he could take some rest
[57:57] to come here and I said to him if you
[57:59] want to reschedule it's okay we can we
[58:01] can work around it I know there's people
[58:04] that wanted to come but I certainly
[58:05] don't want to put a lot of pressure on a
[58:07] man just because we're having Services
[58:08] we want to make sure that our brothers
[58:10] feel strong so he said to me everything
[58:13] is fine and he's rebooked his ticket to
[58:16] fly into Calgary so he'll be here Friday
[58:18] evening and we'll have two services this
[58:21] weekend
[58:22] Saturday night and then Sunday morning
[58:24] regular time
[58:26] we have the Youth Event coming up on the
[58:28] 18th ladies brunch on the 26th and a
[58:31] potluck again on the 27th and I believe
[58:34] after that we'll be back in school and
[58:38] up to our old routines again for the
[58:41] most part some people are seeing
[58:43] children go back into school sooner than
[58:44] the end of the month and some of us will
[58:46] be going in in September but we just
[58:49] trust the Lord will watch over the
[58:51] children as we uh as we get into this
[58:54] next routine of Our Lives
[58:57] are you happy tonight
[58:59] certainly wonderful to see everyone come
[59:01] out on a on a Wednesday evening it's
[59:04] kind of difficult when people are
[59:05] traveling but we trust that they're
[59:07] being fed where ever they are I got to
[59:10] speak to brother Jonah emkey this week
[59:12] in Kelowna had a great conversation as
[59:14] always he has been such an encouragement
[59:17] for me in stepping into this role of
[59:20] Pastor and he just said please greet the
[59:23] Saints for me just say hello to Calgary
[59:25] Living Word so greetings from Brother uh
[59:28] Jonah emke in Kelowna
[59:31] we have uh our scripture tonight I would
[59:35] like to begin I guess the topic of
[59:37] talking about worship and understanding
[59:41] that worship is just a a part of the
[59:44] believer's life when we believe we
[59:46] worship
[59:47] it's that simple we cannot be a believer
[59:50] and not worship
[59:52] because the word of God says
[59:54] that the father seeketh such to worship
[59:59] him those who Worship in spirit and in
[1:00:02] truth
[1:00:03] there's a lot of stuff that I want to go
[1:00:04] over and I'm really not going to rush
[1:00:07] through this I'm going to take some time
[1:00:09] we'll probably be going over and over
[1:00:11] and over as we go through this into the
[1:00:13] future there's many many things about it
[1:00:16] but tonight I'll maybe just do a little
[1:00:18] bit of a high level flyover and we'll
[1:00:20] just see many times we have really
[1:00:23] well-laid plans and the Lord just takes
[1:00:25] control and it's funny how things go so
[1:00:28] one of the things that I saw in church
[1:00:31] order in studying worship is that
[1:00:33] brother Branham says you know the the
[1:00:35] pastor ought to come out and just talk
[1:00:36] for 30 minutes maybe 40 45 minutes and
[1:00:40] be done and I thought that was really
[1:00:43] good for me you know because I I have
[1:00:45] people calling on me to preach a
[1:00:46] three-hour service and I know that after
[1:00:49] about 40 minutes 45 minutes you start to
[1:00:51] lose the people but at the same time
[1:00:53] when the spirit's moving we can go a
[1:00:56] three-hour service and be like how did
[1:00:58] that happen because it only feels like
[1:01:00] we've been here half an hour when the
[1:01:02] Lord moves we're the spirit of the Lord
[1:01:04] is there's liberty we're going to get
[1:01:05] into that scripture tonight I think it's
[1:01:07] really good it's important for us to
[1:01:09] recognize that when we meet here in the
[1:01:11] house of the Lord we've come here to
[1:01:12] worship God and if we've come for any
[1:01:14] other reason brothers and sisters I
[1:01:16] think that maybe we need to just check
[1:01:17] up a little bit because that's why we we
[1:01:20] gather as Believers we come to worship
[1:01:22] God and you know that is where our
[1:01:25] blessing is going to lie it's not going
[1:01:26] to lie in coming to church and and just
[1:01:29] going through a form of ritual and and
[1:01:31] and and sacraments and and and
[1:01:33] traditions and think that God's going to
[1:01:36] be happy with that he's not going to be
[1:01:37] happy with that in fact if that's what
[1:01:39] we're doing then we don't even know who
[1:01:41] we're worshiping
[1:01:42] we're we're stuck in a position where
[1:01:45] you know I I I think it's it's it's a
[1:01:48] dangerous place to be if we don't know
[1:01:50] who the God is the present tense I am we
[1:01:53] talked about it on Sunday you know I am
[1:01:55] the resurrection and the life it's one
[1:01:58] thing to say that he's the resurrection
[1:01:59] and oh my I believe that he rose from
[1:02:01] the dead and I claim him as as my savior
[1:02:03] but is he Lord because if he's Lord then
[1:02:06] he has that life living out through you
[1:02:08] you have the ability to say Amen to the
[1:02:10] word but you know we're talking tonight
[1:02:11] about worshiping in and it has to be in
[1:02:14] spirit and it has to be in truth and the
[1:02:16] only way that we're going to be able to
[1:02:17] worship Him truly is to have the baptism
[1:02:19] of the Holy Ghost in our lives that is
[1:02:21] the spirit that's the only Spirit that's
[1:02:23] going to be able to be accepted there's
[1:02:26] a lot of other spirits around we know
[1:02:28] that but the only way a Believer today
[1:02:30] is going to be able to worship Him is in
[1:02:32] the Holy Ghost
[1:02:33] and we know that when we have the Holy
[1:02:35] Ghost In Our Lives we can sing in the
[1:02:37] spirit
[1:02:37] we can dance in the spirit
[1:02:40] we can we can speak in the spirit
[1:02:42] there's many different fruit of the Holy
[1:02:45] Spirit right we're not going to make
[1:02:47] make any bones about that but we want to
[1:02:50] make sure that if if we see a
[1:02:53] manifestation of that in our midst that
[1:02:55] we want people to have the Liberty to
[1:02:57] experience that we don't want to try and
[1:02:59] and and and put a stop to it and say
[1:03:01] you're not doing it the way that I feel
[1:03:03] like you should do it this isn't the way
[1:03:04] that I've ever experienced before in my
[1:03:06] life if we're going to do that then
[1:03:07] we're going to stop the spirit of God
[1:03:09] remember he's timid
[1:03:12] he's a gentleman
[1:03:13] he's a dove
[1:03:15] he's not going to force his way anywhere
[1:03:18] but I think it's important to recognize
[1:03:19] that we have the ability to worship Him
[1:03:21] in spirit truly in Spirit by the holy
[1:03:24] spirit in our lives and that's why one
[1:03:27] of the reasons why we we can't over
[1:03:29] emphasize the importance of getting in
[1:03:32] the spirit brother Branham says the
[1:03:33] baptism of the Holy Spirit but we're not
[1:03:35] going to go too far with that tonight we
[1:03:36] just need to understand that we have to
[1:03:38] have the spirit there's one spirit and
[1:03:40] and that is the Lord Jesus Christ his
[1:03:42] life living out through us and then in
[1:03:44] truth
[1:03:45] truth it's a beautiful thought when we
[1:03:47] when we can think about truth what truly
[1:03:49] is truth you know there was a man one
[1:03:52] day that stood in the presence of Truth
[1:03:54] and he said what is truth he didn't
[1:03:57] recognize Jesus Christ was God himself
[1:04:00] standing in the flesh
[1:04:02] even when his wife warned him don't
[1:04:04] don't condemn this man he's an innocent
[1:04:06] man I've had dreams about this it's
[1:04:08] going to turn really bad if you do that
[1:04:10] what did pilate do he washed his hands
[1:04:12] and he said oh I just washed my hands of
[1:04:14] the situation had full power to deal
[1:04:16] with it did I lose
[1:04:18] the microphone it sounds like it died
[1:04:21] it's okay
[1:04:23] did you adjust it somehow I yeah sorry
[1:04:26] but pilate he washed his hands of the
[1:04:28] circumstance of the situation he didn't
[1:04:30] want anything to do with it
[1:04:33] but we know that what he did was he
[1:04:34] sealed his fate in doing so and brothers
[1:04:37] and sisters when we come right face to
[1:04:39] face with the truth in our day
[1:04:41] and we wash our hands of it and we say
[1:04:43] oh no I'm not going to get that way I'm
[1:04:46] not going to do that I'm just going to
[1:04:47] step back and say that's not according
[1:04:49] to my Creeds or my dogmas or my
[1:04:52] traditions or my ways if we start doing
[1:04:54] that we're going to seal Our Fate you
[1:04:57] know brother banham preaches that
[1:04:58] message there sorry I'm going to quote
[1:05:01] it wrong
[1:05:03] there's a time there's always a time in
[1:05:04] our life
[1:05:06] when we have the opportunity to accept
[1:05:08] or reject
[1:05:11] tonight I'll just get into the notes
[1:05:13] here and we'll just see what the Lord
[1:05:15] will do I'm just going to take from
[1:05:16] verse 23 and 24 from this story but the
[1:05:19] hour cometh and now is when the true
[1:05:21] worshipers shall worship the father in
[1:05:24] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:05:27] seeketh such to worship Him
[1:05:32] we need to recognize brothers and
[1:05:34] sisters we have that ability
[1:05:36] because if we truly have received the
[1:05:39] Holy Ghost In Our Lives then that means
[1:05:40] we truly have received the message of
[1:05:42] the hour
[1:05:44] because outside of the message of the
[1:05:45] hour or getting baptized in the name of
[1:05:48] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:05:49] of our sins
[1:05:51] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:05:53] Ghost but outside of that we're actually
[1:05:55] coming not according to the formula to
[1:05:57] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:59] but when we get there we're able to
[1:06:01] worship Him in spirit and in truth and
[1:06:03] we know that he always comes where he's
[1:06:05] invited and we when we worship Him and
[1:06:07] we go into the Spirit Worship Him in
[1:06:10] spirit according to the truth of the
[1:06:12] hour the truth of our day the truth of
[1:06:14] the message of the hour recognizing that
[1:06:16] he's already done it all we've done
[1:06:18] nothing but he has done it all he has
[1:06:21] paid it all for our sakes when we can
[1:06:24] come to that place brothers and sisters
[1:06:26] he will take and make us exactly the way
[1:06:28] he wants us to be he will receive our
[1:06:30] worship when we can give him worship
[1:06:33] that he will receive what do you think
[1:06:34] will happen in our lives I think it will
[1:06:36] just unlock everything it will take this
[1:06:38] book and make it a brand new book to us
[1:06:40] the way we deal with our brothers and
[1:06:42] sisters we'll look at them differently
[1:06:43] we'll act differently we'll sing
[1:06:45] differently we'll pray differently
[1:06:46] everything in our life changes we become
[1:06:49] new creatures in Christ Jesus
[1:06:51] and when we have the ability to
[1:06:53] recognize that I just think the the the
[1:06:55] opportunities are Limitless not not for
[1:06:58] us to make a show we know the the third
[1:07:00] poll the the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:02] is not not for a public show God doesn't
[1:07:05] clown for nobody we're not going to say
[1:07:07] I'm just gonna do something and and make
[1:07:10] something happen you know that's that's
[1:07:12] that's potentially working iniquity
[1:07:14] we're not going to do that we know that
[1:07:16] there's people that Jesus said will uh
[1:07:18] will come to him on that day and say
[1:07:20] Lord Lord didn't we cast out devils in
[1:07:22] thy name didn't we have many many many
[1:07:24] wonderful services and mighty works of
[1:07:28] the Holy Ghost in our lives and what
[1:07:29] will he say he'll say depart from me ye
[1:07:32] workers of iniquity because I never even
[1:07:34] knew you and what does that mean that
[1:07:36] means that they never actually came
[1:07:38] according to the word for their day and
[1:07:40] according to the word for their day
[1:07:42] today is getting the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:44] Ghost but once we get that brothers and
[1:07:46] sisters that's all we need
[1:07:48] because we'll always come according to
[1:07:50] the word we'll say Amen to that word
[1:07:52] when it comes our way worshiping in
[1:07:54] spirit and in truth the father seeketh
[1:07:56] such to worship Him
[1:07:58] he's not looking for people outside of
[1:08:01] that you know what brother Branham says
[1:08:03] it it gets hard it gets real hard when
[1:08:06] we start looking at this brothers and
[1:08:07] sisters but just to recognize what the
[1:08:09] prophet of God said he says there's
[1:08:10] millions and billions of people in this
[1:08:12] age impersonating Christianity
[1:08:18] I know
[1:08:20] there's so many things I want to say and
[1:08:22] I'm just I'm just going to take my time
[1:08:23] as we go through this because it's so
[1:08:25] important for us to recognize really if
[1:08:28] we have
[1:08:29] come according to the way God has
[1:08:31] provided for us brothers and sisters
[1:08:33] there ain't no culture there ain't no
[1:08:35] country there ain't nothing to hold us
[1:08:37] back we've got the ability to worship
[1:08:40] him the way that he desires to be
[1:08:42] worshiped and if we want to see him move
[1:08:44] in our lives worship Him
[1:08:46] give him the glory that he desires God
[1:08:50] is an object of worship
[1:08:53] he wants worship
[1:08:54] Brother Brad I'm talking about getting
[1:08:56] in the spirit in 1961 I've got a few
[1:08:59] quotes tonight
[1:09:01] paragraph 125 of getting in the spirit
[1:09:04] it's zero four two eight
[1:09:10] I'll just start paragraph 125. he says
[1:09:13] now we're a school of prophets
[1:09:15] we got it all fixed up
[1:09:18] we know just exactly what he ought to do
[1:09:22] we know just how he ought to do we know
[1:09:26] that the only thing
[1:09:30] thing you have to do is come in and say
[1:09:35] I believe
[1:09:36] and shake hands
[1:09:38] and we'll sprinkle this way or baptize
[1:09:41] this way
[1:09:42] or back this way or that way
[1:09:45] or oh my and we got it
[1:09:47] now that's just the way he does
[1:09:51] and you go ahead and you baptize this
[1:09:53] way and baptize that way and sprinkle
[1:09:55] this way and sprinkle that way and take
[1:09:57] communion this way and that way
[1:09:59] and you still find out you got no God
[1:10:04] you got a form of rituals
[1:10:07] and I'm just going to pause there and
[1:10:08] say this brothers and sisters as parents
[1:10:10] it behooves us to teach our children
[1:10:13] that we don't have a god of rituals
[1:10:16] we serve the Living God
[1:10:19] he's the present tense I am in every
[1:10:22] situation of Our Lives the people we are
[1:10:24] here in this building is the people we
[1:10:26] are behind closed doors in our house
[1:10:30] we're not different people at work we're
[1:10:32] not different people at school we're
[1:10:33] believers
[1:10:36] sometimes you can have this this this
[1:10:38] way where we we come to church and we
[1:10:41] say Amen just right and and we've got
[1:10:44] our rituals just right and if something
[1:10:46] is out of order from our just right then
[1:10:48] it's a big deal it's a big problem and
[1:10:50] we don't know what to do
[1:10:51] I just want to encourage us to just
[1:10:54] remember let your hair down relax if
[1:10:57] there's ever a place you can be relaxed
[1:10:59] it's in here as believers
[1:11:01] we're going to get into it but brother
[1:11:02] Branham he says that you know what the
[1:11:04] whole world gets into the spirit of
[1:11:06] their stuff what about the Bride of
[1:11:08] Jesus Christ
[1:11:09] can we get into the spirit
[1:11:12] or does it scare us does it make us
[1:11:14] frightened
[1:11:15] sometimes if we sing too loud if we
[1:11:17] shout too loud if the preacher's too
[1:11:19] loud all these different things can be
[1:11:21] just get maybe in the way of our our way
[1:11:24] don't worry about our way worry about
[1:11:26] his way let his way be the way
[1:11:30] sprinkle this way sprinkle that way take
[1:11:32] communion this way and that way and you
[1:11:33] still find out you got no God
[1:11:35] you got a form of rituals that's all
[1:11:38] God is a spirit and they that worship
[1:11:41] Him must Worship in spirit and in truth
[1:11:44] amen God sends us Prophets
[1:11:47] God send us prophets back to tear up the
[1:11:52] thing I think this is beautiful and it
[1:11:54] just you know what I I just can't help
[1:11:57] but think it's just an encouragement as
[1:11:59] a preacher to think that really this is
[1:12:01] what we need to do we need to tear down
[1:12:03] those things brothers and sisters if
[1:12:04] we've got forms of of righteousness if
[1:12:07] we've got high places if we've got
[1:12:09] Groves all different ways in our lives
[1:12:12] and they don't line up with the word of
[1:12:13] God according to the message of the hour
[1:12:15] we've got to tear them down we've got to
[1:12:18] get rid of them we've got to make sure
[1:12:19] that we boot them out of our homes and
[1:12:21] boot them out of our families and boot
[1:12:23] them out of our Lives boot them out of
[1:12:24] our churches God is only going to accept
[1:12:27] one form of worship and that is in
[1:12:30] spirit and in truth and I would say
[1:12:32] that's him searching for a genuine heart
[1:12:35] one that's going to say Lord I I know
[1:12:38] that I'm nobody I'm nothing search my
[1:12:40] heart and try me I don't have anything
[1:12:42] to hide from you Lord
[1:12:44] but we talked about it a long time ago
[1:12:45] and we've got doors and door when
[1:12:47] there's that one spot that we just won't
[1:12:49] open we're afraid to open that door
[1:12:51] don't go you can go anywhere you want to
[1:12:52] preacher but don't go there uh oh
[1:12:55] there's a problem
[1:12:56] God wants every single door in the house
[1:12:58] open and when he sees that he sees he's
[1:13:01] got a dedicated human he's got a person
[1:13:02] that's fully surrendered we need to make
[1:13:05] sure that that we we don't have all
[1:13:07] these different ways he says amen God
[1:13:09] send us prophets back to tear the thing
[1:13:12] up and to bring out the truth that will
[1:13:15] show it vain theology oh my I just think
[1:13:19] about this and I think Lord help me not
[1:13:21] have vain theology I don't want to have
[1:13:24] anything that would hinder your spirit
[1:13:26] from moving in my life I don't want to
[1:13:28] have any Traditions any Creeds I don't
[1:13:30] want a hybrid message of the hour I want
[1:13:33] the truth remember brother Branham said
[1:13:35] when he went beyond the curtain of time
[1:13:37] stay straight on that word
[1:13:40] there's only one thing that's going to
[1:13:41] get us to the other side and that's
[1:13:43] going to be divine love the love of
[1:13:45] Jesus Christ the life of Jesus Christ
[1:13:47] Living out through us
[1:13:50] but if we got reservations and say oh
[1:13:52] there's this and there's that and
[1:13:53] there's the other
[1:13:55] where are we at brothers and sisters
[1:13:57] remember the father
[1:14:00] he seeks those to worship Him in spirit
[1:14:04] and in truth those are the ones that he
[1:14:06] wants
[1:14:07] he's not interested in the half-baked
[1:14:09] Christian experience he's not interested
[1:14:12] in the unbelievers he's only interested
[1:14:14] in those that are not afraid to disclose
[1:14:16] their eyes and open their hearts and
[1:14:18] lift up their hands and give him the
[1:14:20] glory that he deserves
[1:14:24] and where I really want to get with this
[1:14:25] is to recognize that you know many times
[1:14:28] we'll hear people say well now you're
[1:14:30] dealing On Emotion I think it's
[1:14:31] beautiful we're we're not even getting
[1:14:33] started tonight and it's already 9 30.
[1:14:35] my goodness 8 30 sorry
[1:14:38] we have uh we have this sorry honey I
[1:14:41] didn't mean to scare you
[1:14:44] we have this understanding that you know
[1:14:46] John is is a type of the Bride that's
[1:14:49] what the prophet of God said
[1:14:51] he's the type of the bride and he was
[1:14:53] called higher he was called to a a
[1:14:55] greater Revelation he wasn't invited to
[1:14:57] just stay where he was to stay where all
[1:14:59] the disciples were no you have been
[1:15:01] called to a special elevation a special
[1:15:04] place a place that nobody gets to come
[1:15:06] except for my truly elect and you know
[1:15:09] when he heard that voice he saw that
[1:15:12] door open in heaven as the Bride of
[1:15:13] Jesus Christ recognizes when she hears
[1:15:16] that voice it's not the voice of a man
[1:15:18] that attracts her it's not the voice of
[1:15:20] a a hillbilly from Kentucky that
[1:15:23] attracts her it's the voice behind the
[1:15:25] sign that attracts her it's the voice
[1:15:27] from that open door in heaven saying
[1:15:29] there's a revelation here if you can
[1:15:31] receive it just come a little higher
[1:15:32] into this Revelation and I'll show you
[1:15:35] things to come
[1:15:37] we talked about it months ago maybe even
[1:15:40] years ago I think it's so beautiful I
[1:15:42] just want to dwell on it for a little
[1:15:43] while I hope it's okay you know what
[1:15:45] there's a difference between this we say
[1:15:48] the prophet of God says that this the
[1:15:50] Holy Ghost is without sensation
[1:15:53] that's what the prophet of God says and
[1:15:55] I know we can all say Amen to that but
[1:15:56] he doesn't say it's without emotion
[1:15:59] but many times we can take and actually
[1:16:01] couple the two together and say that
[1:16:04] it's the same thing it's not the same
[1:16:05] thing the prophet of God says it and I
[1:16:07] can bring quotes up to to back up
[1:16:09] there's ample quotes about it where he
[1:16:11] says there is a uh not a sensation but
[1:16:14] there is an emotion with it there is an
[1:16:17] emotion when you get the baptism of the
[1:16:19] Holy Ghost you don't sit there like a
[1:16:21] dried up old stick you can't help but
[1:16:24] Worship in spirit because you recognize
[1:16:26] you've got the truth
[1:16:29] remember John in his experience
[1:16:32] I want to say this
[1:16:34] and many people might might I don't know
[1:16:36] I shouldn't say that for forgive me for
[1:16:38] doing that when I do I I need to change
[1:16:40] my way
[1:16:42] I believe John got the Holy Ghost
[1:16:44] because John went to heaven
[1:16:47] John he went to a place where nobody
[1:16:49] gets to go but what did he do there
[1:16:51] brothers and sisters he saw the the the
[1:16:53] the the the
[1:16:54] he saw God sitting on the throne
[1:16:59] one with the book of redemption in his
[1:17:01] head and it was a closed book and what
[1:17:03] did he do he wept
[1:17:07] he had a sensation
[1:17:09] he had an emotion he wept
[1:17:12] because he recognized if there wasn't
[1:17:14] someone worthy to take that book and
[1:17:16] open it
[1:17:17] to reveal his name and all the bride's
[1:17:20] name that we were all lost
[1:17:22] so he wept when it was oh when it was
[1:17:24] closed but he also rejoiced greatly when
[1:17:27] he recognized oh my there was one worthy
[1:17:31] to take that book and to open it and to
[1:17:34] look thereon
[1:17:36] and he rejoiced
[1:17:39] there is
[1:17:40] there is an emotion brothers and sisters
[1:17:43] and we don't need to be afraid of
[1:17:44] emotion
[1:17:46] if we've got the truth and we're in the
[1:17:48] spirit
[1:17:51] out of I am he in 1959.
[1:17:54] it is I sorry it is I Be not Afraid in
[1:17:58] 1959 I apologize
[1:18:00] zero eight one one
[1:18:02] it is I be not afraid I think we went
[1:18:04] over this a little while ago but I love
[1:18:06] how brother Bradham he just brings out
[1:18:07] this story I'm just going to take some
[1:18:08] time and read this tonight and we might
[1:18:10] only get this far and I think that's
[1:18:11] okay but we'll just see what the Lord
[1:18:13] will do here paragraph 22 it is I be not
[1:18:16] afraid
[1:18:18] Andrew brother Branham he he he he
[1:18:21] narrates this story Through The Eyes of
[1:18:23] Andrew a disciple who who witnessed what
[1:18:27] was happening at the well in Samaria
[1:18:30] then and this paragraph 22 then Andrew
[1:18:33] must have stopped oing just a moment and
[1:18:35] he said Brethren did not our hearts burn
[1:18:37] within us when we seen him
[1:18:41] no more than a man wary in his way and
[1:18:44] he sat down on the well
[1:18:47] he was so tired
[1:18:49] he couldn't go down into Samaria with us
[1:18:51] that day when we get went to get him
[1:18:53] some victuals get to some victuals for
[1:18:56] him and and how we talked on the road
[1:18:58] about how how we loved him
[1:19:01] and before they would even give us the
[1:19:03] food
[1:19:04] here come a woman down the street
[1:19:06] screaming
[1:19:08] come see a man who's told me the things
[1:19:11] I've done isn't this the very Messiah
[1:19:14] isn't it him
[1:19:16] can you imagine those disciples they
[1:19:19] would have been like oh
[1:19:21] he's up there we better go we better get
[1:19:23] that food and get up there to him
[1:19:26] come and see a man who's told me the
[1:19:28] things I've done isn't this the very
[1:19:29] Messiah isn't it him for he said to me
[1:19:32] when I was out there to get a bucket of
[1:19:34] water I just went to the well like I
[1:19:36] always do and I heard someone ask me for
[1:19:38] a drink and I looked over and seen a
[1:19:41] middle-aged Jew
[1:19:43] and he said to me woman bring me a drink
[1:19:46] and I said it's not customary for you
[1:19:48] Jews to ask Samaritan such
[1:19:51] and he said if you knew who
[1:19:54] you were talking to you'd ask me for a
[1:19:58] drink I'd give you water
[1:20:02] that you don't come here to draw
[1:20:04] oh we got to talking about different
[1:20:06] denominations
[1:20:08] and the places to worship
[1:20:10] and he told me that God was a spirit and
[1:20:14] they that worship Him must Worship in
[1:20:18] spirit and in truth
[1:20:20] I just want to pause there for a second
[1:20:22] to think about this just to emphasize
[1:20:25] this here she is talking
[1:20:27] to God
[1:20:29] and he's explaining to her through Jesus
[1:20:33] God in flesh he's explaining to her that
[1:20:36] they who worship will worship in spirit
[1:20:39] and Truth there will be people that do
[1:20:41] it
[1:20:42] and we know that she desired to worship
[1:20:44] she had a thirst we know brother Bradham
[1:20:47] he preaches so much on this topic she
[1:20:49] had a thirst and that thirst could only
[1:20:51] be satisfied by one thing many times in
[1:20:54] this world we have thirsts that will
[1:20:56] only be satisfied by one thing
[1:20:59] she tried to fill it with husbands she
[1:21:01] tried to fill it with many different
[1:21:02] things but here she meets him in person
[1:21:06] and what happened to her it changed her
[1:21:08] life that conversation she recognized
[1:21:11] this man he actually has truth there is
[1:21:14] truth here because I had been taught my
[1:21:16] whole entire life that something like
[1:21:18] this was going to happen and now here I
[1:21:21] perceive that this man is the prophet
[1:21:23] he's right here in front of me
[1:21:25] he told me that God was a spirit and
[1:21:28] they must worship they that worship Him
[1:21:30] must Worship in spirit and in truth then
[1:21:33] I shall never forget she might have said
[1:21:35] this when he turned those piercing eyes
[1:21:38] against me and he said woman go get your
[1:21:41] and I said to him I don't husband and
[1:21:44] you men know
[1:21:46] how many I've lived
[1:21:48] and you know you men know how many I've
[1:21:50] lived and he said no you have no husband
[1:21:52] because you've had five husbands and the
[1:21:54] one that you're now living with is not
[1:21:56] yours and of course she'd say something
[1:21:58] like this I was surprised we don't have
[1:22:00] such in our churches today
[1:22:03] and I turn quickly to look at him and I
[1:22:05] said sir I perceive that you are a
[1:22:07] prophet We Know by the Messiah will be a
[1:22:10] prophet for when he comes he will tell
[1:22:13] us such things
[1:22:14] and this is the words that he said
[1:22:18] I am he that speaks to you
[1:22:22] and tonight brothers and sisters I just
[1:22:24] want to say we all have that opportunity
[1:22:27] to be that woman at the well where he
[1:22:29] will come to us we don't seek Him
[1:22:32] brother Bradham says it in the message
[1:22:34] we don't go just stumble into the the
[1:22:36] mission on the corner and suddenly we we
[1:22:38] get this message of the hour man doesn't
[1:22:41] seek God God seeks man and when he comes
[1:22:44] he speaks to us he'll tell us the things
[1:22:47] that that nobody knows about us
[1:22:50] and you know what's sad is sometimes not
[1:22:53] not sometimes I think every time God
[1:22:55] will speak to us through the pulpit
[1:22:57] he'll speak to us through a tape he'll
[1:22:59] speak to us when we read our Bible and
[1:23:01] we can take the Bible and we can take
[1:23:03] the take but when it comes to the pulpit
[1:23:05] it can be a difficult thing because it
[1:23:06] can sound like someone's been talking
[1:23:08] about our life but you know brothers and
[1:23:10] sisters I want to encourage you tonight
[1:23:12] if you hear God speak to you through the
[1:23:15] pulpit no one is going behind your back
[1:23:17] and talking to me no one's going behind
[1:23:19] your back and talking to other brothers
[1:23:20] it's God it's the Holy Ghost it's spirit
[1:23:24] and Truth coming your way
[1:23:26] just like this woman at the well only we
[1:23:29] don't have a well to go to we've got a
[1:23:31] church to come to we've got a place
[1:23:33] where we can come where we know that he
[1:23:35] will meet us because he's provided it
[1:23:37] for us
[1:23:40] you know the word
[1:23:41] itself is truth for us today that is the
[1:23:46] truth the word of God and the word of
[1:23:48] God
[1:23:50] becomes flesh and I would say not just
[1:23:52] dwells Among Us now it dwells in US
[1:23:56] and remember John he wasn't instructed
[1:23:58] you know it's wonderful to see that the
[1:24:01] lamb has come and taken the book and and
[1:24:04] that Lamb with the book John was
[1:24:06] instructed to come
[1:24:09] and take the book wasn't he
[1:24:13] John being a type of the Bride
[1:24:15] tonight I want to say this brothers and
[1:24:17] sisters
[1:24:18] as the Bride of Jesus Christ we've been
[1:24:20] instructed to come and take the book
[1:24:21] also
[1:24:22] but not just take the Book and Tape and
[1:24:25] say that I've got the books and tapes so
[1:24:26] it's all good
[1:24:27] supposed to take the book and eat it
[1:24:29] and what's going to happen is it's going
[1:24:31] to be sweet as honey in our mouth isn't
[1:24:33] it we're going to be so sweet when we
[1:24:34] talk about the message of the hour and
[1:24:36] so sweet when we talk about the
[1:24:38] messenger and and all of the message and
[1:24:40] all the stories are going to be so sweet
[1:24:42] when they ring out in our ears
[1:24:44] but it's going to make our bellies
[1:24:46] bitter it's going to make us
[1:24:47] uncomfortable we're not going to feel at
[1:24:50] home we're going to feel like strangers
[1:24:52] and pilgrims like we're we're looking
[1:24:53] for a city with with a foundation but
[1:24:56] it's a foundation made by God it's not a
[1:24:59] place that we can come to in this world
[1:25:00] where we're going to feel comfortable
[1:25:03] we're going to come to a place where
[1:25:04] we're just not comfortable
[1:25:06] but we've been instructed to take the
[1:25:08] book and eat it too
[1:25:09] and what happens to us when that happens
[1:25:11] brothers and sisters is we become the
[1:25:13] book
[1:25:14] we're no longer just looking at books
[1:25:16] and tapes and saying that's where my
[1:25:18] salvation lies that's where it's all at
[1:25:20] it's not just in the books and tapes
[1:25:21] it's in Christ Jesus taking up his Abode
[1:25:24] in our lives you know out of Jezebel
[1:25:27] religion in 1961 talking about spirit
[1:25:30] and Truth tonight worshiping God in
[1:25:33] spirit and Truth
[1:25:35] and Jezebel religion
[1:25:37] 610319 paragraph 21.
[1:25:41] remember the Good Samaritan that found
[1:25:43] the man wounded
[1:25:45] he brought him to the Inn that's the
[1:25:47] church
[1:25:48] and gave the man their two pence and
[1:25:50] told him if he needed any more he'd pay
[1:25:53] him when he come
[1:25:55] so he's got two pence he's able
[1:25:57] he's able to doctor you up if he's a man
[1:26:00] of God
[1:26:02] if he's a man of God that stands on the
[1:26:04] word of God he's got what God gave him
[1:26:07] the spirit and the word is that right
[1:26:11] how is it
[1:26:13] we're to worship
[1:26:15] in spirit and in truth
[1:26:17] and the word is truth is that right
[1:26:20] I just want to say tonight brothers and
[1:26:22] sisters
[1:26:24] the word of God operates in ways that we
[1:26:27] don't comprehend with our mind it's
[1:26:30] beautiful thing isn't it and I'm sure
[1:26:32] that we all understand it but sometimes
[1:26:33] we just need to stir up our Pure Minds
[1:26:36] by way of remember it sometimes maybe
[1:26:37] the children haven't heard it or or
[1:26:39] maybe don't understand it the way that
[1:26:40] we're talking about it so just bear with
[1:26:42] me if if you're a veteran in the word
[1:26:44] and you get it you understand this but
[1:26:47] as we as we go forwards I think it's
[1:26:49] important to recognize that the Lord God
[1:26:52] himself will minister to us the way that
[1:26:55] we need to be ministered to and I want
[1:26:57] to say it just from experience from my
[1:26:58] own little experience when I first came
[1:27:00] to church I came to church I was invited
[1:27:03] to come to special meetings to hear the
[1:27:05] the great evangelists come and and to
[1:27:08] hear another evangelist come and and the
[1:27:10] person that invited me which is my wife
[1:27:12] she she said to me she had a bit of a
[1:27:14] revelation at one point she said why
[1:27:16] would I want him to come and just hear
[1:27:18] an evangelist talk when I want I think
[1:27:22] it would be good for him to come and
[1:27:23] just hear what my pastor says isn't it
[1:27:26] important to just hear what the regular
[1:27:28] everyday Pastor has to say I think it's
[1:27:31] beautiful because in the end that's what
[1:27:33] I did I came on a regular Wednesday
[1:27:35] night service that's what changed my
[1:27:36] life forever brothers and sisters was a
[1:27:38] Wednesday night service hearing brother
[1:27:40] Ken preach and I didn't understand all
[1:27:43] of the the stuff that he was talking
[1:27:45] about I didn't understand the doctrines
[1:27:46] I I didn't even understand that you
[1:27:48] could get the message of the hour as
[1:27:50] something that you could have as your
[1:27:52] own to study and look at for months
[1:27:54] after I came to church
[1:27:56] but what I did understand was that there
[1:27:58] was something true here that there was
[1:28:00] some truth and there was Spirit when we
[1:28:03] would enter into the pre-service music
[1:28:05] brothers and sisters it did something to
[1:28:07] me and I can say that I needed it it
[1:28:10] washed me by the water of the word by
[1:28:12] the pre-service music there's an
[1:28:13] anointing to that coming to church early
[1:28:16] it does something to us it sets the
[1:28:18] atmosphere in our lives it allows us to
[1:28:20] turn off all of the world and all of The
[1:28:23] Temptations and troubles and problems of
[1:28:25] the world that we have that's why we
[1:28:27] come to church a little bit early we're
[1:28:28] going to get into all of this the
[1:28:30] prophet gave us instructions very clear
[1:28:31] instructions and I would say this it was
[1:28:33] God that gave the prophet instructions
[1:28:35] for us so that we would be able to come
[1:28:37] to this place where we're worshiping in
[1:28:39] spirit and truth because there's coming
[1:28:40] a time but now is where people will
[1:28:43] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:28:46] it's not just something that we're
[1:28:48] talking about that's kind of a a fun
[1:28:50] thing or maybe just a fantastic thing
[1:28:52] brothers and sisters we're coming to
[1:28:54] meet with God Almighty there's so many
[1:28:57] aspects of this that we can get into and
[1:28:59] probably will God permitting in time
[1:29:02] brother Adams he says so he's got two
[1:29:04] pence he's able to dock you up if he's a
[1:29:06] man of God if he's a man of God that
[1:29:08] stands on the word of God he's got what
[1:29:10] God gave him the spirit and the word is
[1:29:13] that right how is it we are to Worship
[1:29:16] in spirit and in truth and the word is
[1:29:19] the truth is that right so I just want
[1:29:21] to make those points to understand that
[1:29:23] God is a spirit and he desires to be
[1:29:26] worshiped and his word is the truth and
[1:29:29] if we have both of those coming together
[1:29:31] brothers and sisters we've got the
[1:29:32] Dynamics
[1:29:33] we've got all the mechanics and I want
[1:29:36] to say thank you to each of the
[1:29:37] musicians that bring of their gifts week
[1:29:39] after week tirelessly wanting to give of
[1:29:42] their gift
[1:29:43] I can only imagine what it would be like
[1:29:45] to be a musician and and get in the
[1:29:47] spirit and fall under the anointing it
[1:29:50] would be so difficult to not want to
[1:29:52] play the loudest and maybe fastest as I
[1:29:55] could or or however the spirit leads me
[1:29:58] but for the musicians to all come
[1:30:00] together and and play One music
[1:30:03] that's the anointing of God
[1:30:07] and I just want to make this point that
[1:30:09] you know
[1:30:11] we're not we're not setting an
[1:30:13] atmosphere for devils
[1:30:15] we're setting an atmosphere for the
[1:30:17] spirit of God to move
[1:30:19] and that's our sole purpose that's our
[1:30:21] sole desire every single one of the
[1:30:23] musicians that comes up here I want to
[1:30:25] say this tonight they've got the Holy
[1:30:27] Ghost
[1:30:29] or they won't be coming up here
[1:30:31] and I want to say this also some people
[1:30:33] might say oh brother Barry how could you
[1:30:35] say that some of those young people how
[1:30:36] do you know that
[1:30:38] I don't want to challenge that
[1:30:40] I don't want to say they don't got the
[1:30:41] Holy Ghost and I think it would be a
[1:30:43] dangerous place for anyone to say that
[1:30:45] someone doesn't if they're willing to
[1:30:46] subject themselves to the word of God
[1:30:51] I've witnessed it
[1:30:54] maybe I shouldn't go there but I'm doing
[1:30:55] I'm gonna I've witnessed it
[1:30:57] or a young person has had a gift and and
[1:31:00] come to play to offer it to the Lord and
[1:31:03] someone else in the church come and
[1:31:04] destroy that person
[1:31:06] to another person
[1:31:08] and what that did was that took that
[1:31:10] person away from potentially being able
[1:31:12] to play their gift in the church and
[1:31:13] potentially being able to come up in the
[1:31:16] spirit and get Washed by the Water of
[1:31:18] the word and now where are they
[1:31:21] I want to say this they're not in church
[1:31:24] but that doesn't mean that God won't
[1:31:26] deal with them I do think that it means
[1:31:28] that someone's going to answer for that
[1:31:30] one day
[1:31:32] I wouldn't want to be that person
[1:31:36] we don't ever want to you know that's
[1:31:37] one of the things that my pastor taught
[1:31:39] me early on and I'm so thankful for it
[1:31:41] he witnessed me coming up in in the
[1:31:43] stages we go through the stages don't we
[1:31:44] as Believers we come through the
[1:31:47] justification stage and we get saved and
[1:31:50] we're all amongst Angels Everyone's an
[1:31:52] angel isn't it wonderful when we're
[1:31:54] saved it's just beautiful to come to
[1:31:56] church and we get Washed by the Water of
[1:31:58] the word we have the pre-service music
[1:32:00] and we're amongst angels and maybe we
[1:32:01] have potlucks and fellowship and it's
[1:32:04] just beautiful
[1:32:05] then we come to
[1:32:07] sanctification
[1:32:09] and we get all cleansed out now and set
[1:32:11] aside for service and then we start to
[1:32:12] look around and recognize whoa some
[1:32:14] people are they're actually people
[1:32:16] they're not angels
[1:32:18] I can see the hind parts of that person
[1:32:20] and and they never treated me right and
[1:32:23] and I can see what they do and and the
[1:32:25] other one man
[1:32:27] they're Christians whoo
[1:32:30] but isn't it interesting we're going
[1:32:32] through the stages and you know what
[1:32:34] brother Ken he taught me he said you'd
[1:32:35] never judge someone's experience that's
[1:32:38] not up to you to judge you judge your
[1:32:39] own experience
[1:32:41] you work on yourself and when you start
[1:32:44] to get that rising up inside of you
[1:32:46] where you're judging someone else's
[1:32:47] experience it's time to get back to the
[1:32:49] altar brother Branham even says it maybe
[1:32:51] not exactly that way we need to make
[1:32:53] sure that we're not judging other
[1:32:55] people's experience what we want to do
[1:32:57] is be an encouragement we want to help
[1:32:59] people get to the word of God we want to
[1:33:01] help people get to worshiping and
[1:33:03] spirited and Truth not hinder them not
[1:33:05] hold them back and say that you're not
[1:33:06] doing it my way you're not doing it the
[1:33:08] way that I taught you're not behaving
[1:33:10] the way that I thought you should be you
[1:33:11] know when we start doing that brothers
[1:33:12] and sisters you can go through
[1:33:13] justification and you can go to
[1:33:15] sanctification but you can get stuck in
[1:33:17] sanctification
[1:33:19] stuck there where everything that
[1:33:21] happens is something to criticize
[1:33:25] that's not a believer's life
[1:33:27] no we want to see everyone come to the
[1:33:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost we want to
[1:33:32] step Beyond those stages where we can
[1:33:34] say you know what it's not up to me to
[1:33:36] judge people it's up to God to judge
[1:33:38] people I just want to encourage people
[1:33:40] to get to God
[1:33:44] but if we just go and demonstrate a
[1:33:46] critical spirit then what are we going
[1:33:48] to do
[1:33:51] you know we want to make every minute
[1:33:52] count brothers and sisters
[1:33:54] we're here for a purpose now I want to
[1:33:56] say this really checked me as I was
[1:33:58] going through this we want to make every
[1:34:00] minute count I think about how many
[1:34:01] minutes I have in a day and what do I do
[1:34:04] with them
[1:34:05] what do we do with our minutes how do we
[1:34:07] how do we make our lives better how do
[1:34:10] we help other people around us because
[1:34:11] whether Bradham said eternal life is
[1:34:12] living for others so what are we doing
[1:34:14] here
[1:34:17] out of Confirmation and evidence 1962.
[1:34:21] zero six two one e
[1:34:24] paragraph 27.
[1:34:27] but the Branham says now let's let's
[1:34:29] listen real close as I'm giving you
[1:34:32] giving a moment of time for you to get
[1:34:35] to the scripture
[1:34:37] so he's just going to take his text but
[1:34:38] he just drops this little note in here
[1:34:39] he says remember that we mustn't never
[1:34:41] come to church to play religious
[1:34:45] we must have come to just put on a
[1:34:47] religious Act
[1:34:49] to go to church
[1:34:51] we must come
[1:34:53] to Worship in spirit and in truth
[1:34:57] and I just I just
[1:34:59] I just want to say this we must come to
[1:35:02] Worship in spirit and in truth
[1:35:04] brothers and sisters
[1:35:06] saying Amen to the word of the preaching
[1:35:07] of the word is one portion of it
[1:35:10] but he's looking for worship
[1:35:13] he wants to hear our voice worship Him
[1:35:16] and and if we have something that's
[1:35:18] going to stand in our way that's going
[1:35:20] to stop us from being able to worship
[1:35:22] Him
[1:35:23] is he going to say that's okay my word
[1:35:26] said that I wanted you to worship me but
[1:35:28] you never did because that whatever
[1:35:30] circumstance or situation happens so you
[1:35:33] know don't worry about it what's he
[1:35:34] going to say to all the other people
[1:35:35] he's a just God he's not a dodeal
[1:35:38] grandpa he's only going to judge the
[1:35:39] World by his word
[1:35:41] and we've got to recognize that we have
[1:35:43] the opportunity to come and worship him
[1:35:45] in spirit and in truth we have the
[1:35:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah we've got
[1:35:49] the truth of the message of the hour
[1:35:51] yeah so why can't we worship Him in
[1:35:53] spirit and Truth give him all of the
[1:35:55] glory of Our Lives
[1:35:57] I'm not saying we don't brothers and
[1:35:58] sisters I want to encourage us if you've
[1:36:00] got more in you then give it give it to
[1:36:03] him don't hold it back don't wait for
[1:36:05] some day where it's all going to be
[1:36:07] different and better because the Rapture
[1:36:08] is going to happen any one of these days
[1:36:11] we don't want to be found saying oh my I
[1:36:13] could have given more but I just held it
[1:36:15] in me because of brother so and so or
[1:36:18] sister such and such or whatever the
[1:36:19] person or or situation was
[1:36:23] I want to give you another example when
[1:36:25] I first started preaching
[1:36:26] I believe the Lord has dealt with me
[1:36:28] many different ways many different times
[1:36:29] but this was a time where brother Ken
[1:36:32] had went away and he said I I know he
[1:36:34] thought this he never said it directly
[1:36:36] but I trust you to take a service in my
[1:36:37] stead I trust you as a Believer to just
[1:36:40] take the service and go and preach it
[1:36:42] and and and I know that it will all be
[1:36:44] fine I entrust you with the word to get
[1:36:46] behind that sacred pulpit and and so I
[1:36:49] went and had to live my life that day
[1:36:51] and I got into a circumstance a
[1:36:53] situation with another brother and and I
[1:36:55] could not for the life of me get Beyond
[1:36:58] get over myself let's put it that way I
[1:37:01] had such a problem
[1:37:03] and I thought you know what I'm just not
[1:37:04] doing I'm just not preaching I'm just so
[1:37:06] upset in my spirit I'm just going to
[1:37:07] bring the wrong attitude to church I
[1:37:08] just can't do it forget it I'm not going
[1:37:10] to preach
[1:37:11] and you know it was like I don't know
[1:37:12] one of the first few times uh to preach
[1:37:15] and I told Brother Ken I've got this
[1:37:17] thing I got a preacher so he says okay I
[1:37:19] trust you and then the Devil comes
[1:37:20] around and does that right we can look
[1:37:22] at it now and say yeah obviously that's
[1:37:23] what happened but here I am thrown in
[1:37:25] the towel forget it I'm not even gonna
[1:37:26] preach I can't do it I'm gonna have the
[1:37:28] wrong spirit I go and sit down on the
[1:37:30] study and just what am I going to do
[1:37:33] and I believe the Lord said that what
[1:37:35] are you going to do you're going to quit
[1:37:37] are you a quitter
[1:37:39] you think you're preaching your word
[1:37:41] you're preaching my word
[1:37:44] get up and go and see if I won't come
[1:37:47] and vindicate it
[1:37:49] for me it changed it it gave me the
[1:37:52] ability to recognize I'm not going to
[1:37:53] let no situation or no brother no sister
[1:37:55] no no anything that I think should stop
[1:37:58] me from coming and preaching I'm going
[1:38:00] to get right in my position and just
[1:38:02] allow God to move and I want to say it
[1:38:04] tonight brothers and sisters if we can
[1:38:06] get ourselves into our position to
[1:38:08] Worship in spirit and truth and just
[1:38:10] forget about all the rest of it just
[1:38:12] watch what God will do
[1:38:14] and I believe it with all my heart
[1:38:16] there's a reason why he wants to go this
[1:38:18] way
[1:38:19] one of the things I've said in the past
[1:38:20] I'm going to keep saying it on and on
[1:38:22] and on there's coming a time where we're
[1:38:24] not going to have prayer meetings we're
[1:38:25] not going to be talking about the
[1:38:27] message of the hour and quoting quotes
[1:38:28] and and coming to church and doing all
[1:38:31] these things that we're doing brothers
[1:38:32] and sisters we're just going to be
[1:38:33] worshiping God we're just going to be
[1:38:35] giving him praise and thanking him for
[1:38:38] calling us before the foundation of the
[1:38:39] world to be the recipients in the last
[1:38:42] age
[1:38:45] remember that we mustn't never come to
[1:38:46] church to play religious
[1:38:48] and I want to say this to have a
[1:38:50] covering
[1:38:52] I can hide behind my my cloak of of
[1:38:54] religion and say that I believe the
[1:38:56] message of the hour God sees right
[1:38:57] through it
[1:39:00] must it never come to church to play
[1:39:01] religious
[1:39:02] we mustn't come just to put on a
[1:39:05] religious act to go to church
[1:39:08] we mustn't come to church or we must
[1:39:10] come to church in spirit and in truth
[1:39:13] we must deeply and sincerely we must
[1:39:18] really mean what we're coming here for
[1:39:22] and I just think it's beautiful I want
[1:39:24] to pause there for a second and just say
[1:39:25] God bless you each one who's willing to
[1:39:27] take your gift and offer it to the Lord
[1:39:29] because I believe each musician deeply
[1:39:32] and sincerely understands what they're
[1:39:34] doing
[1:39:35] we're not coming just to play in a band
[1:39:37] you know why I'm going this way but I'm
[1:39:38] going to do it if we have people that
[1:39:40] are criticizing are you bringing a gift
[1:39:44] because until we're willing to actually
[1:39:46] give something what are we criticizing
[1:39:49] encourage brothers and sisters
[1:39:52] if you think it should be different
[1:39:53] encourage it
[1:39:55] ask God to make it different and see if
[1:39:57] he won't
[1:39:59] but first you've got to Worship in
[1:40:01] spirit and a truth that's the trouble
[1:40:03] isn't it that's the challenge remember
[1:40:05] we must never come to church to play
[1:40:07] religious we mustn't come just to put on
[1:40:11] a religious act to go to church we must
[1:40:13] come to Worship in spirit and in truth
[1:40:15] we must deeply and sincerely we must
[1:40:19] really mean what we're coming here for
[1:40:21] the days they're getting evil the time
[1:40:25] is evil and we want to make every minute
[1:40:28] count and especially when we're in the
[1:40:30] house of the Lord brothers and sisters I
[1:40:33] want to say this the whole world is evil
[1:40:36] we have this opportunity to come and
[1:40:39] worship Before the Throne of God
[1:40:41] Almighty why would we want to get caught
[1:40:43] up thinking things should be something
[1:40:46] different or a different way or
[1:40:47] something other than what it is what if
[1:40:50] we were just to push it all aside and
[1:40:52] say I'm going to give my all because I
[1:40:54] recognize what God's done for me in my
[1:40:56] life
[1:41:00] I think we have the opportunity brothers
[1:41:03] and sisters to worship God in spirit and
[1:41:05] in truth because he's told us the father
[1:41:07] seeketh such to worship Him
[1:41:14] I've got a quote here that I'm not going
[1:41:16] to read tonight I'm just going to jump
[1:41:18] over it because I think it's so
[1:41:19] important I really want to dwell on it
[1:41:21] later
[1:41:24] I'll call the musicians I don't want to
[1:41:26] keep us too long tonight
[1:41:29] in Luke chapter 19.
[1:41:32] maybe if you turn there with me verse 36
[1:41:37] story that
[1:41:40] we talked about a little while ago at
[1:41:42] Easter
[1:41:44] Jesus coming into Jerusalem
[1:41:49] riding on the ass of a full
[1:41:53] fall of an ass I mean
[1:41:55] verse 36
[1:41:58] Luke chapter 19 as he went they spread
[1:42:01] their clothes in the way
[1:42:04] when he was come nigh even now at The
[1:42:06] Descent of Mount of Olives
[1:42:09] the whole multitude of the disciples
[1:42:10] began to rejoice and praise God with a
[1:42:13] loud voice
[1:42:15] for all the mighty works that he had
[1:42:17] seen
[1:42:18] isn't that beautiful
[1:42:21] I want to encourage you tonight brothers
[1:42:22] and sisters
[1:42:24] ever who's listening
[1:42:25] if you have seen the Great Mighty works
[1:42:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:29] Rejoice with a loud voice
[1:42:32] don't be bashful
[1:42:34] to shout
[1:42:35] to shout unto the Lord
[1:42:37] to rejoice and praise God with a loud
[1:42:39] voice for all the mighty works that he
[1:42:41] has done for you that you have seen
[1:42:43] verse 38 says saying blessed be the king
[1:42:46] that cometh in the name of the Lord
[1:42:48] peace in heaven and glory in the highest
[1:42:53] isn't it interesting
[1:42:55] the Bible documents now the religious
[1:42:57] ones the ones who were there they were
[1:43:00] all around weren't they they were there
[1:43:01] in the midst and some of the Pharisees
[1:43:03] among the multitude said unto him Master
[1:43:06] rebuke thy disciples oh my they're
[1:43:09] getting a little bit out of order
[1:43:10] they're they're maybe they're playing
[1:43:12] the music a little too loud or maybe a
[1:43:14] little too fast and and maybe they're
[1:43:16] they're singing a little too
[1:43:18] contemporary of songs where's their
[1:43:21] heart
[1:43:22] are they rejoicing for what God has done
[1:43:25] for them in their lives some of the
[1:43:27] Pharisees among the multitude said unto
[1:43:29] him Master rebuke thy disciples and he
[1:43:32] answered and said unto them I tell you
[1:43:34] that if these should hold their peace
[1:43:36] the stones would immediately cry out
[1:43:40] all creation is groaning brothers and
[1:43:43] sisters for the manifestations of the
[1:43:45] sons of God and you know
[1:43:47] when the sons of God manifest what what
[1:43:50] happened before the before when when the
[1:43:54] morning Stars sang together the sons of
[1:43:57] God they shouted for joy they didn't
[1:43:59] just quietly say amen and and sing at a
[1:44:03] at a normal churchiosity level so
[1:44:06] everyone's comfortable it wasn't about
[1:44:09] that it was about expressing that I
[1:44:11] understood that if God didn't call me
[1:44:12] before the foundation of the world to be
[1:44:15] his elect in the last day that I would
[1:44:17] be lost as lost can be I would be one of
[1:44:19] those millions and billions of people
[1:44:21] out there who could potentially be
[1:44:22] impersonating Christianity or worse I
[1:44:25] could be one that was never called to be
[1:44:27] saved and just completely lost created
[1:44:30] according to election to be destroyed
[1:44:32] there's people in this world like that
[1:44:35] we know the word of God says Pharaoh was
[1:44:37] created to be destroyed so God could
[1:44:40] demonstrate his power
[1:44:43] but there were some that were created to
[1:44:45] be saved
[1:44:47] brothers and sisters we've got every
[1:44:48] single reason to rejoice
[1:44:51] to not hold back to not worry about what
[1:44:54] anybody thinks only worry about what he
[1:44:56] thinks and I can tell you when you get
[1:44:59] to that place when we get to that place
[1:45:01] brothers and sisters I say Lord help me
[1:45:03] too because when we get there
[1:45:05] my goodness I I don't believe there's
[1:45:07] going to be any devil that wants to
[1:45:09] stick around here there won't be no
[1:45:10] devil that will want to be around our
[1:45:12] families no devil that will want to be
[1:45:14] in our homes or in our churches uh I
[1:45:17] believe we will just begin to see that
[1:45:19] that quick powerful work of the third
[1:45:21] poll take place in our lives maybe stand
[1:45:24] with me tonight
[1:45:26] answered and said unto them I tell you
[1:45:28] that if these should hold their peace
[1:45:30] the stones would immediately cry out
[1:45:34] Don't Be Afraid brothers and sisters
[1:45:36] Shout to the Lord
[1:45:38] let's just go to him in prayer
