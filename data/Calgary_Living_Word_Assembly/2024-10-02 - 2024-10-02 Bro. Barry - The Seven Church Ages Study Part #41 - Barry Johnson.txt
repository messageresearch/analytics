before we do that we just had a couple of prayer requests we wanted to remember starting with thanking the lord for touching sister Beth vanderplas in the past she is continually healing and uh getting better so we're certainly thankful for the Lord's Healing Touch in her life and I'd like to testify tonight at The Healing Touch in my body and my knee I've been waiting a long time for it and uh I can feel it it just feels better every single day and I'm certainly thankful for that just have a couple of unspoken requests tonight and if you have a need by all means just defy gravity and let him know it tonight and he'll be sure to answer it gracious Heavenly Father tonight as we come before you we are so thankful that we have the mechanics in place Lord Jesus father we've got the songs to set the atmosphere we've got all of the equipment and the musicians and the and the instruments Lord Jesus but father most of all we brought our hearts tonight Lord Jesus and father we know that they're knit together in love father with your spirit and we just pray that Lord Jesus we could push aside all of our Humanity Lord and just enter into that place tonight where all things are possible father we thank you for touching sister Beth Vander Plass Lord we just ask that you would continue to minister unto her father Lord we pray for the vanderplas family Lord and the Carpenters also that you would just continue blessing them Father letting them be a blessing to the folks in the past Lord Jesus father we pray Lord that you would just receive all the praise and glory for touching my leg Lord I'm certainly thankful Lord Jesus for what you've done for me and I know that healing comes from you and we just thank you for that lord it's getting better every single day and father we just want to commit the two unspoken requests into your hands father once again we know that you know them we know you know every aspect of them Father And We Just Want to Thank You Lord Jesus for sending Deliverance father we pray for each and every need made known unto you tonight by way of an uplift hand hand father and Lord maybe there's some that just didn't raise a hand father we know that all of us are needy people and we just father want you to reveal yourself to us and we know that's why you give us the needs why you give us the valleys and the trials Lord so you can express to us that you are a Healer that you are a restorer that you are a husband that you do love us father more than we could ever imagine father tonight we pray that you would just bring restoration and healing to each and every life each and every heart each and every mind here tonight Lord as we just Commit This service into your hands now For Your Glory we just ask that you would be with those who couldn't be

for all that you do for us every single day we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians once again for bringing of your sacred portion amen it can't be easy for a musician to race across town after work on a Wednesday evening and get in the spirit and be able to come and set an atmosphere where the Lord will move in amen we thank thank the Lord for each and every one who offers their gift freely if you'll turn with me in Revelations chapter 2 tonight we'll car carry on with our study in the exposition of the seven Church ages in the thyrian church age that starts in uh Revelations chap 2 Verse 18 Revelations 2 Verse 18 says unto the angel of the church in thara write these things sayith the Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first not withstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works but unto you I say and unto the rest in thota as many as have not this Doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden but that which ye have already hold fast till I come and he that overcometh and keepeth my words unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to Shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the Morning Star he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you that you give everyone a space to repent Lord and tonight father we know that's our desire is to subject ourselves to your word and father to come with hearts that are open repentant Hearts father Desiring to learn and to grow by Your Word father we just ask that Lord now that we have the mechanics set that the Dynamics of your Holy Spirit would take control and that you would just minister to us this word fresh once again Lord as we go forwards we just ask ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I just had this on my heart and uh I just thought I'd read it I hope it's okay it's out of the exposition of the seven Church ages if anybody out there is going through something maybe it'll be for you tonight the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval so we can't look at this life the natural events the circumstances surrounding us and say God is with us or that God isn't with us based on the natural events that we see his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world and does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and he manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself how many of us brought ourselves to him he brought us to himself sorry one second here Oh my he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as Sons speaks of adoption doesn't it and how shall I prove my love to him how shall I prove that I'm placed as a son how shall I prove that I'm adopted how shall I prove that I actually love him other than just saying flippantly that I love you Lord how shall I prove that how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and not just believing it it can be pretty easy to believe it but when we believe something we actually begin to act like we believe it is that right and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass I just think that's such a beautiful thought it came to me real strong before service and I thought I better read it if that's the case maybe someone's going through something maybe we have circumstances and situations brothers and sisters he loves us and how do we show our love back to him we just conduct ourselves with joy amidst our our lives and the trials that we're going through God bless you tonight that was for free just like to welcome back all those who were traveling brother Toby he was traveling to Florida he took some services at Brother Joseph Underwoods God bless you brother brother Emanuel is back from the UK he was at his brother's funeral and uh we have brother mvin he's away from us tonight he's up north being Joseph for cnrl certainly miss everyone when they do go away and uh I do apologize for my behavior over the last week or two I've been a little bit out of it with the the surgery and the medication that I was on it was a bit much and I'm certainly thankful I'm not on that medication anymore and uh Lord willing I will never do it again but you know uh it's important to take it the right time and just enough to get you through I guess it's all about pain management and it helped it worked but I'm back so God bless you tonight we have a prayer meeting tomorrow night at 7:30 for those who can come we know it's always a blessing we have the singles weekend coming up this weekend we've got the youth event on Sunday the 20th I believe it is after service and I just wanted to mention that we do have the uh ongoing vote for the church officers it is actually going to close at 11:59 p.m. on October the 4th and uh if if you haven't received uh an email with a ballot in there by all means just reach out and let me know um just wanted to make sure that we're clear there are requirements there are conditions to be able to vote in this uh election and any election that happens in the assembly you first have to be tithe paying and offerings paying tithes and offerings you have to attend a minimum of three months to qualify you have to be in regular attendance to be able to qualify and you need to be over 18 years of age to qualify and uh it says in the bylaws for the uh for the uh assembly that if a man is married and he meets these requirements then his wife automatically qualifies to vote as well so I do believe we have followed all of that criteria if you have any questions or concerns by all means just uh reach out and we can talk about it are you happy tonight amen certainly thankful for this study the exposition of the seven Church ages you know I've heard it said a few different times and maybe a couple different ways how this study just sets the church in order the exposition of the seven Church ages is the essence of the message of the hour the purity of it all of it condensed into one one book which is uh a real real neat thing if you ever could uh condense the message into one book that is I think this would be it um last time we talked we uh were in the thyrian church age I believe we started it and uh we covered the the story of St Patrick and how he trained dogs and how St Patrick was not um the messenger for the age it was Columba and uh the thyrian age uh is just such an interesting study of the word because we know that it is uh it's not a good age it is the uh the ruling of a woman over a man and uh that's what thot tyrian is dominating female and uh you know when the church gets to dominating over the ministry or over the word there's a problem there's politics and that's really what brother brandham gets into here with this um I think it's just wonderful to hear though just sort of recapping kind of uh maybe we didn't maybe I'll just start here in paragraph 2 four of the of uh the thot tyrian Church age talking about uh Columba when he went and uh he was dealing with some uh some authoritarians that were not willing to talk to him and uh you know he actually just preached the gospel and by preaching the gospel he he won many to the Lord in paragraph 24 it says on another occasion when he was also shut out from a village as he turned away to depart the son of the chief suddenly became violently ill even unto death St Columbo was quickly sought after and recalled people know who to call in their hour of trial don't they even unbelievers when he prayed the prayer of faith the boy was instantly healed The Village was then open to evangelization by the gospel you know brothers and sisters I talked about it a while ago in uh my own life and if I had a Ministry or whatever we'd want to call it for the longest time I thought there needed to be a certain thing in my life and and you know maybe done in a certain way and and when you pray that prayer of faith that way then God will come on the scene but you know it's not up to us to get God to come on the scene it's up to us to Simply Pray when Believers real Believers genuine Believers pray God's listening and he comes on the scene and backs up his own word it's not up to us to try and bring him to come on the scene he's just waiting to come on the scene carrying on in paragraph 25 I think this is where we left off last time the pure gospel that was preached by Columba and his fellow workers spread over the whole of Scotland turning it to God it also overflowed into Ireland and over northern Europe his means of spreading the gospel was one wherein perhaps 12 men under a leader would go into a new area and literally build a gospel centered Town amongst these 12 men would be Carpenters teachers preachers Etc all wonderfully versed in the word and holy living I love that part not just wonderfully versed in the word but wonderfully versed in the word and the action the action to the vision that we heard about on Sunday the holy living this little colony was enclosed by a wall soon this enclosure would be surrounded by students and their families in their own homes learning the word and preparing to go out and serve the Lord as missionaries leaders and preachers the men were free to marry though many did not in order to serve God the better they remained free from State help and thereby thereby steered clear of politics instead of ever attacking other religions they taught the truth for they belied that the truth was weapon enough to accomplish the ends that God had in mind for them just try and argue hey try and argue the people that want to come against the message of the hour they'll always tie us up they'll always be just a little bit smarter but if we just preach the word if we just say the word the word does all the Sorting we don't need to worry about that at all they were absolutely independent of Rome St Columbo was the founder of a great Bible school on the I island of high off the Southwest coast of Scotland when he went there the island was so Barren and Rocky that it could not bear enough food for them all isn't this beautiful but Columba planted seed with one hand while he held the other Aloft in prayer today the island is one of the most fertile in the world from this Bible centered Island went forth Mighty Scholars endowed with wisdom and the power of God when I read the history of this great servant of God and the wonderful work he did it saddened my heart to find that the papal power lusting to bring all men into its grasp came and eventually defiled these Mission fields and destroyed the truth as it was taught by Columba it is not uh it is not just a simple thing for people to actually be able to get the word and believe the word the devil is coming around as a roaring lion we know that Vision that brother brandham had it's such a good one and it just sort of coincides with this story of Columba planting seed with one hand and praying with the other one we know brother Ram saw that vision of the man in white going around on dis Fields he was talking about where the Earth was turned it was readied soil to accept seed but then what happened the man dressed in black the Sinister one came around behind him and actually SED tears amongst all the good seed that's what the devil is doing that's what the devil does and how do how does he do it he does it with words just with words that's all it is words he's pretty Sly the salutation Revelations 2:18 these things saith the Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass I just think this is such an amazing scripture myself when I look at this this does not paint the picture of a Dodie old grandpa does it this Paints the picture of the king of kings and Lord of lords the just one who will recompense for all that is done in this age in in all the ages the revelation of the godhead to the thot tyrian age is that Jesus is the son of God once in the days of his flesh he was known as the son of man but henceforth we know him no more after the flesh he is no longer the son of man the great prophet who in himself gathered together all prophecies the only begotten is back in the bosom of the father now we know him after the power of the resurrection and isn't that beautiful because we don't know him of the power of the Resurrection in the story about Easter 2,000 years ago we know about the power of the Resurrection in our lives and homes and families here today he is alive he's risen and has taken unto himself his mighty power and is above all and overall to the praise of his own Glory that's so beautiful his glory he will not share with another his leadership over the church he will not surrender to any man there ain't no Bishops there ain't no Cardinals there ain't no Vicor to Christ but there's Christ he looks down upon thyra and here he sees in that City and in that fourth age the honor which belongs to him alone bestowed upon another his eyes Blaze with the fire of Wrath and judgment as he sees Apollo revered as the Son of God when he alone is the only begotten of the father how awful must must be his judgment upon the religion of the thot tyan age wherein the church members are like the Pagan worshippers of the Son of God Apollo the son of Zeus elevate a human ruler to adoration backed by the power of the state and that's why I just have to pause there brothers and sisters and and mention it we all know it but sometimes maybe it's just good to remember that's why God will not allow any Ministry to get raised up if people start getting their eyes on a man good or bad there will be a situation that will take that man out of the way because God won't share his glory with nobody not with anyone brother Ram goes on to say for that is exactly what he saw the Roman Catholic Church fully immersed in idol worship based upon rights of the son god Apollo had elevated a man to act ual deity Pope through the marriage of the church to the state for Thomas aquinus and alveris Pelagius formulated and stated that the pope seems to those who view him with the spiritual eye to be not a man but a God that just makes it idol worship right there idolatry immediately there are no bounds to his authority goodness he can declare to be right what he will and can take away from any their rights as he sees fit and and that is actually it's on the road today to doubt this Universal Power leads to being shut out from Salvation And even today even in the message you can hear people that take it and spin it their own way and say say if you don't believe it that the way I believe it then you're going to go to hell you're going to burn in hell how could anybody who is a believer of this word ever ever say those words to doubt this Universal Power leads to being shut out from salvation goodness the great enemies of the church are the Heretics who will not wear the Yoke of true obedience and that's definitely Us in the way in which you call heresy We Will Not Bow Down and Worship the Pope will we we ain't going to kiss the ring it ain't going to happen 1 Timothy 2:5 there is one mediator between God and Men the man Jesus Christ the son of God but the pope of Rome has changed the word isn't that just exactly like Satan just exactly like the Garden of Eden just just changed the word just a little bit right just a little bit how he made it one mediator between God and man not men so now he mediates between the mediator and Men those middle managers my but there is none other mediator save the son the pope pronounces salvation through the Church of Rome but there is no salvation except through the Son of God no wonder the eyes blaze in fiery judgment no wonder the feet are like fine brass as he stands ready to trample into powder and dust the wicked kingdoms of this world thank God for those strong feet of brass they have passed through the Judgment for us amen they are now our foundation for what he gained is ours we stand identified in him Jesus the son of God it was in this age that we witness the rise of interesting you know when brother bam talks about muhammadislam muhammadislam it was in this age that we witness the rise of image about their Prophet Muhammad right now I'm not trying to throw off on him now but we know what's happened in this world it's terrible if people try and mock them they come and kill them even today it was also in this age that the false Church defied the first commandment of almighty God and launched swiftly into breaking the second commandment for it put its Pope in the place of Jesus Christ and established and enfor forced idol worship to such an extent that it meant death to those who refused who refused the icons of place within the church under Empress Theodora alone from 842 to 867 over 100,000 saints were killed because they reputed the images of no value surely this age must repent or lose all there stands the Lord of glory god very God his word cast aside his person rejected but human hands and human hearts cannot depose him let them deny him he remaineth faithful fear not little flock it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and when I come with feet of brass and flaming eyes I will recompense judgment is mine I will repay sayith the lord it's interesting how this is written because I personally believe you go between the man the prophet and the Lord Jesus not saying this is the word of God but I'm saying there's a man inspired to speak the eulogy Revelations 2:19 I Know Thy works and love and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first here again we find the same introductory remarks I Know Thy works the Son of God himself said believe me for the very Works sake he put an emphasis on his own Works while on Earth The Works that he did were ordained of God to inspire faith in him it was a great part of his ministry his holy spirit in the first Apostle Paul said in Ephesians 2:10 for we are as workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath ordained that we should walk in them I really like that scripture and I just kind of took a look at it tonight I think there's I think there's something in there just a little nugget paragraph 36 these Works were to inspire faith in him as they would show forth the relationship to him that Paul described as created in him now works will never take the place of faith in God for our salvation but works will show forth our faith already placed in him this is this is a real nugget here this this uh couple of paragraphs here Works don't actually show that that we're saved our Salvation is not based on works and we know the church many churches have based salvation upon works the more works you do the more saved you get the more family members you can save etc etc brother Bram he says here good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a saved life as fruit unto the Lord you don't have to tell people certain things in their lives when we get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when he singular the spirit of truth comes Jesus Christ the word this one with eyes flaming as fire and feet as brass when he comes into our lives he leads us and guides us into all truth he shows us what he likes and he shows us what he doesn't like in our lives and if we've truly met him then we listen to him and we change our lives we change our minds we don't actually continue on I love what how brother B brother mvin brought it on on Sunday the Masterpiece family and and the one part in there he talked about repenting it it means to change our mind that's what repentance means is to change our mind but what happens is it doesn't just change our mind and we can have a cup of coffee with friends and say Amen I've just changed my mind I've repented no what it does is it changes our actions if we've truly repented if we haven't truly repented then we go on the cycle and our actions don't change and we we continue on there's still something in our life that we need to get rid of and you know brothers and sisters I just think it's important for us to actually speak straight about these things because these are devils that like to get in our lives and and try and make us think that we're saved and everything is good when really we're not when things are not good because the action doesn't show that it's good I say Lord help me when we repent we change our mind which changes our actions good works won't save us good works won't save me good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a saved life as fruit unto the Lord I believe in Good Works he says even if a man is not saved he ought to do good works and do the best he can what is horrible in the sight of God is for men to do evil works and then say they are doing the will of the Lord Lord help us Lord that is what the Bishops and popes and the hierarchy of Rome were doing and are doing they were killing maming and doing all manner of evil in the name of the Lord they lived out lives exactly opposite to what the world teaches now we wouldn't have to look very far or talk to very many people to hear and and ask if the Catholic church just the Catholic Church specifically and I don't mean to throw off on them but just just to say that what he read here what we read here what he was saying there back then is still happening now how can there be all these different news items these situations that happen to to families and children and and there seems to be nothing that happens there's no court of appeal the bishop or the Cardinal just goes to a new posting somewhere else how does that happen they lived out lives exactly opposite to what the word teaches in that evil day those True Believers sha like a light in a dark place I just love that because it's the same today brothers and sisters those Believers shine like a light in the dark place as they continually did good they returned cursing with blessing and did the truth to honor God even though many died for it it's seems like maybe it would be easier to do that if our lives were on the line if we knew that we're going to get fed to lions and so on and so forth maybe we would be a little more committed sometimes to just do truth and and to be honest and and to be upright and to live our lives according to the gospel but because we don't have that that great thing it's just sort of a a gray area in the lives of a Christian and I guarantee you that Satan knows that and he loves that because it gives him a place to hide it gives gives them an opportunity to mess with people's minds where they think they're doing good when they're really not doing good because you know what guilty of the least is guilty of the whole I want to ask a question tonight uh which is worse which is worse brothers and sisters a little white lie or a terrible vicious lie which one of those is worse anybody they're all the same Sin is Sin truth is truth a lie is a lie it's true or it's not true there's good and there's evil there's sin and there's Holiness Amen in this verse he's commending his children because they were living changed lives they weren't living according to the way they were according to the the people that were there all the churches that were happening their Works testified to a new spirit where within not in their church not in their Association not in their tenure their Works testified to a new spirit within men saw their good works and glorified God people read them because they were written Epistles right read of all men we know that we can preach but you know what our lives speak way louder than our our words do we can say children I don't want to see you do that I don't want to see that happening I I don't want to see you doing that children but then as a parent as a daddy I can go and do exactly what I'm telling my children not to do and what am I children going to think what are my children going to do my children are going to say I'm going to do exactly what Daddy's doing you can tell me not to do it all you want but you do it so why shouldn't I their Works testify to a new spirit within men saw their good works and glorified God men were able to get saved by the lives being lived through the Believers yes sir if you are a Christian and you are going to do what is right your your Works will show that your heart is right isn't that true though won't our our works our life show that we're actually right with the Lord works g241 airone out of the Strong's Concordance by implication and act deed doing labor work it's something that we do we don't just say that we have it but we actually demonstrate it and and people say wow you got it you know I I think it's interesting there's two sides to the idea the ideology of works as I was studying this I just started contemplating it you know and one side is to look at all that I've done for the kingdom of God which is what the church typically does Universal the more works you do the more saved you become right and and that I want to say brothers and sisters if we're not careful it can creep into our lives as Believers to think that because we do good works that we're more saved that's not the case the verification of our life our life with the Lord and and his love for us is in the Divine it's in the Beloved right it's because he tells us that he loves us because he came and died for us but to say that I do good and now I'm saved can't you see how saved I am by how good I act doesn't work that way the other side is is to behave and and act like the works that I do will just make it right it it will somehow make the bad situation better and and that's not the case either there has to be a middle ground and and we know that the prophet taught that it's a razor edge thin it it's going to be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible so guarantee you it's going to be in and around this message of the hour I personally believe brothers and sisters according to the word that there's only one way to see the works that's in this scripture here in Ephesians 2:10 and and that's to recognize that this is the very life of Jesus Christ Living out through us because we are his workmanship which means we've been created by Him to actually bear fruit and he said it we know we read that in in in John I believe it is that I am the vine and you are the branches and all of the branches es will be purged and the ones that won't bear fruit they're going to be clipped off and and and heu Into the Fire and that's so that the rest of the tree can grow better where it is producing fruit I Works doesn't actually save us brothers and sisters we are his workmanship created for himself to live in and through and you know because of that the works manifest EST they do they just do sheep they just bear wool doves are just white we just are believers because we believe we we have his life in us and even in the smallest of ways that's where I just wanted to say that you know which lie is is worse the the big one or the little one The Little White Lie the world says it's just a little white lie it's not a big deal but you know what if you went to court with that then you would actually lose all credibility in court in a court case right if you had just a little white lie because how many more of the answers would be Little White Lies and I would say this if you were actually taking and weighing The Little White Lies they would stack up to one great big lie wouldn't they even the smallest of ways guilty of the least is guilty of the whole you know in Revelations 21:8 it just made me think about this this one scripture here verse 8 Revelations 21:8 but the fearful and un believing and the Abominable and the murderers and the mongers and the sorcerers and all idolators and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death there is no such thing as a small sin there's no such thing as a small lie brothers and sisters it it is or it isn't it's sin or it's not but you know in John 14 I just love how Jesus said this verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also we're not going to do another Works we're not going to act a different way from the way he set the pattern in the word of God we're not going to do that if we truly believe his word of God the way that he gave it to us and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father we know that brother bradam said it in the message of the hour it's not going to be greater works because you can't do Greater Works than raise someone from the dead but there will be a lot more of them amen and we know according to the message of the hour the prophet for our day he did a lot more miraculous things there was so much of a manifestation of the spirit of God in his life even more so than was documented of Jesus Christ in the word but we know that the word also says that you know you wouldn't even be able to document all of the things that happened in the life of Jesus when he walked here on Earth because he was God In the Flesh and so many things happened that many people don't even know it's just a wonderful thing you know brothers and sisters Works won't save us and and I think it's so good because we can we can remember this we can look at it and say brother Bram you know in 1965 he preached a message works is Faith expressed we're very familiar with that aren't we and it's true because that's exactly right and I say Amen to that every time I hear it and speak it and listen to that message works is Faith expressed it is not faith is Works expressed it's not the other way sometimes S I think it can actually become that way in our lives and that's what I'm saying it's the trick of the devil to get in there and make us think because we're doing good we've got all these good works everything is right in our life and it's not necessarily is it according to the word that is the sword that's the deciding factor is it according to the word if it's according to the word then I say hey you know what the works that you do are going to be just like he did and they're going to be more and it will be expressing the faith that's inside of us brother Bram he says yes sir if you are a Christian you are going to do what's right period even when it takes the hide off our backs even when it's the most uncomfortable conversation even when it it's the most difficult thing that we've ever done in our lives we will always do what's right because brothers and sisters that's where Jesus Christ is going to meet us he's not going to meet us hiding behind a lie he's not going to meet us hiding behind something that's not true he's only going to meet us right where the problem is your Works will show that your heart is right and it won't be something that you put on not just a garment not just a fig Leaf right I believe the message I believe God sent a prophet I I've got a fig Leaf no no it'll be the life that we live people will see it and they'll wonder about it and the best part is Lord willing people will get saved because of it because that's the ultimate thing is to see people get saved to find that last predestinated seed brother R goes on to say for you will do his will when no one but God sees you you will do his will when no one but God sees you and you will do his will even if it cost you your life that is hard but I believe it's true I know your love service faith and patience you will note that their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without love our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service that is powerful right there Paul speaking to the Corinthians said without love I am nothing and whatever I do is without profit unless it's done in love now you can see right here that these Believers weren't in that nickan class nicotin wait a second I thought we were talking thyrian ties it together doesn't he they weren't in that nickan class that did works as a mean of Salvation or to be admired by men they did their works out of the love of God that was shed abroad in their hearts by the holy ghost that love in their hearts was God's love for his own Jesus said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples that you have love one for another John 13:35 the pagans who saw the lives of the Earth early Christians said behold how they love each other John said in 1 John 47 everyone that loveth is born of God I just think it's such a good thing Lord willing we'll probably get into a study in love it's powerful it's the strongest force in the universe brothers and sisters there's nothing stronger than love I want to give you a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity knowing to do something and not doing it and knowing that you shouldn't do something and doing it iniquity abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the Leo Dean or last AG self love and love for material things will take place of the true love of God now I've got this highlighted here and marked so I've got a harp on it for a bit self-love and love for material things help us Lord what is self-love just not considering others just making sure that everything that I need and I want I do and I get whether it's material things or whether it's maybe intellectual things maybe it's making myself to be the the boss I'm the boss right I love myself I love to look at myself in the mirror look at me look at my works and love for material things boy Amazon has made it real easy for that to happen right the love for material things we've got to be careful brothers and sisters the devil he knows exactly how we're created and you know what unfortunately all of us have human DNA man there's not one of us that has Angelic DNA we we're human beings and we're created in the image of God but in this flesh we have got to kill the old man if we're not willing to kill the old man then one of these two is going to happen we're going to get caught up with ourselves we'll we'll have to get doorways made wider so our heads will fit through them right and and so that we can drag all of our material things with us through those doors but it will take the place of the true love of God brother Bram says we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so it's not just brother Barry saying it here brother Bram is saying we need to guard against the power of sin self-love and love for material things in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit I say Lord Jesus help us realize the effect of this last day Spirit help us to love one another like Christ loved the church that he would give us life for it that he would cherish it and nourish it it's time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us the one thing that will be able to help us we'll reject it those dark and Dreadful years the True Vine held its love for God and love of the Brethren God commended them for for it I know your service Jesus said he that is greatest of all oh my is what he's servant of all a wise man commented on that saying here here's what he said only history will prove the truth of that dictum and that man was right all the truly great men of history have been servants they haven't been busting themselves forward saying get out of the way cuz I'm here amen Make Way for me they've been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always be at the head have gone down in shame even the very rich are condemned by God when they have not used their wealth right but look into history and you will find that the truly great were those who served others history can never Acclaim For Those whom much was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others now let us apply that to ourselves and I've got that highlighted too now let us apply that to ourselves now let let let me apply that to me even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so are we to follow that example see him as he bows himself over the feet of the Apostles and washes their tired and dirty feet this one who is the ultimate judge with eyes flames of fire and feet of brass for judgment that one bowing down and washing stinking feet my he said you don't know now what I am doing but you will know Hereafter but what you see me doing you ought also to do he became became a servant in order that God could Elevate him to the highest Heights and one day in the Judgment of the Saints we are going to hear him say Well done good and faithful servant enter thou into the joy of the Lord It's hard to always be a servant but those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seated with him in his throne it will be worth it all then let us labor for the master from the Dawn Till Setting Sun let us talk of all his wondrous love and care amen and when all of life is over and our work on Earth is done and the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be there amen I know your faith now he does not say here as he did to the church in pergamus you hold my faith he's not talking about his faith now but he's commending them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentions their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in James the trying of your faith worketh patience amen James 13 three there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of our faith and this world brothers and sisters unfortunately is set up to actually create us to be impatient isn't it you can hardly drive on the roads without getting in someone's way and having people honk at you or shake their fist or or we ourselves become the ones actually driving faster to not get any anybody's way God's will oh sorry there's absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of our faith and you know the trial of our faith is where we reach the darkest place in our lives where we don't just have the flowery bed ofes where we don't just have situations where we think that you know it's difficult it's hard situation but where we come to where we really have to say do I believe or not because the devil's going to come around and say this is the Lord you serve remember the story about brother brandham when his wife had already passed and the doctors came and told him about his other his daughter now Sharon Rose flies in her eyes her eyes Crossing from the pain that she was going through as a little baby an infant and and how he had to endure that go through that situation and that's right when the treachery of the Devil comes around he takes us to our darkest spot God allows us to get there to try our faith that's what he's trying us he's not trying to see whether we have good church attendance or whether we're good people good citizens it's the trial of our faith where the devil will come around and say that's the god you serve you did all of that for him you made yourself a fool everybody mocked you and laughed at you and you still had held fast to this message and and you prayed for people and everybody got well but you can't pray for your wife and have her get well that's the god you serve really that's what the devil is going to do he's going to come around with that kind of talk and when we reach our darkest hour that's when the rubber meets the road and we show who we are that's when we can understand brothers and sisters it is the trial of our faith it's not the trial of our riches it's not the trial of of our our our our our Goods in this world our worldly actions it's the trial of our faith do we believe or not in Romans 5:3 tribulation worketh patience how highly God regards this outworking of our patience as seen in James 1:4 but let patience have her perfect work who knew that patience was uh feminine but let patience have her perfect work I just can't help but think that that patience is likely speaking of the Church of the Living God the feminine but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire lacking nothing isn't that interesting how Perfection is linked to patience I say Lord help me Lord help me God's will for us is perfection isn't that beautiful and that Perfection is patience I would never have thought this outside of reading this book outside of studying the the the exposition of the seven Church ages God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience wow waiting on God and waiting for God Isn't that true they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength this is the process of character development not getting what we want when we ask the way we ask and still being able to love him the trial of our faith understanding that sometimes what we ask for isn't actually his will for us but waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development how highly God has commended these Saints of the Dark Ages patient as as Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly Faithfully they served God that is all they wanted out of life just service to their lord how great was to be their reward my I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor role of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased how tragic it was that in the Ephesian age love waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages but in this age in the darkest of all ages they served him even more amen wow what a lesson that is just thinking about this again brothers and sisters I can't help but think about it those we've heard about the Dark Ages we've read about the persecution we've heard about the fox's book of Martyrs all the people that have gone ahead before us given their lives for this message watch their families to be destroyed fed to Lions etc etc we've all heard about that but one day we're going to go shake their hands we're going to say how did you do it what an honor and a privilege it is to meet you to think that you were in that terrible situation my it just makes makes me think what's my troubles what's my tribulations I can just go and turn on the to and have a hot shower I can go to the fridge and just get some food we can just go and jump in our vehicles yeah we can go to our jobs we can even just come to the place of worship where we've got soft seats not wooden pews right where we've got air conditioning and fans and a furnace that heats it you know there's people that have worshiped regardless regardless of the situation why what a lesson that is brother bradam says there's no ceasing of this gracious service of Love unto the Lord I better call the musicians I could just keep going and going and going with this it's so good there's no other there's no ceasing of this gracious service of Love unto the Lord but rather an increasing of it and and and another one here this nugget just before we close that's the secret brother bradam says let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is what increased service stand with me as we close tonight let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord whatever it is and our reply is increased service when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to to shout the victory amen God bless you tonight we'll just end right there let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord I just can't help but think of all the saints that have gone on Lord and to think about the pressures that they were under and the trials that they had to endure father knowing it was the trial of their faith and Lord nothing could take that Faith because we know that you are the same yesterday today and forever and we know that it's not a faith in God it's the faith of God that it was literally your faith living out through those Saints in that age and we know that it doesn't make it any easier sometimes when we talk that way it can sound like it's maybe a supernatural faith that would just make it simple but we know that Lord there was something inside of them that desired to serve you harder and and longer the more the persecutions came name and father I pray that tonight we would just consider some of the words that were spoken father and Lord if anything was spoken out of turn forgive me I pray that we could just heed to your word Lord Jesus that we would allow it to live out through US Lord we know that's the desire of your children tonight father is is to not just hear your word but to do your word father to not just be hearers but doers Lord Jesus oh father let us live lives in such a way that the works Express oh what kind of faith we truly have to this world around us Lord let our co-workers say You Must Believe in a different way than I've ever seen before Oh father let the the children in school be able to be that bright shining light in that that world of Darkness Lord in this oh Father in this world that we live in the agendas that are there Lord trying to teach our children things that are so foreign to Believers father we pray that you would help the husbands and the wives Lord to just live a life so consecrated to you that it encourages their spouse Lord Jesus to serve you more oh Father help each one of us Lord to have that love one to another that Lord the world would say they truly believe because they love so strong amen father we love you tonight we just thank you for all of your Tender Mercies in our lives and we pray that as we go forwards we would think about those people who have gone on before us Lord that laid down their lives for this gospel help us Lord Jesus to be willing to do the same we just ask now that you would keep your hand upon us Lord as we go our separate ways father that we would desire to love you more than we ever have in our lives father I just want to ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen can we sing that song Lord I want to love you more more than I ever have before simple song but powerful [Music] nonetheless Lord I Want to Love You More than I ever have
