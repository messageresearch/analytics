like to read from John chapter 11. something I think maybe we went over a while ago it's uh I don't think it ever gets old though certainly like to welcome all of our visitors we have Brother John catenge from Alaska I believe he's the the father of our visitors that have been here the husband and uh we certainly just want to welcome you brother and I understand he's a minister in Alaska a minister of this gospel so we just want to welcome you and our midst brother God bless you and we have a sister Teresita a friend of sister Emmy she is here visiting from Philippines where are you sister she's there okay God bless you Sister welcome certainly trust you'll feel right at home as well we have sister mercy here from Massachusetts I think I said that right I hope so God bless you Sister welcome and we have sister Ruth here on a visit from Germany God bless you Sister I trust each one feels welcome here today we have some visitors that aren't really visitors they're just more family and we trust you just feel right at home today I don't want to leave anyone out so I'm going to stop right there those are the notes that I had written down so God bless you each one today as we as we fellowship with the Lord I trust you are well fed out of John chapter 11 today just like to start with verse 1. let's take a little bit of time I trust we're okay today for some time John chapter 11. we'll start with verse 1. now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany of the town of Mary and her sister Martha and it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick just want to remind us this is the one this is the one that understood how to greet Jesus how to appreciate his presence and remember how the prophet brought how clearly we need to recognize when we gather together like this we don't want to invite him here to just sit in a corner and say God bless you we had Jesus in our midst we want to anoint him we want to welcome him we want to hear from him we want him to be appreciated and you know if we do that then he will bless us and you know this is a historical account of what already happened and look at how he comes and blesses her imagine if we don't appreciate him in our midst we could be down the road and need him but did we appreciate him when we had him it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick therefore his sisters sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus and when when he had heard therefore that he was sick he Abode two days still in the same place where he was then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into Judea again his disciples say unto him Master the Jews of late sought to stonelee and goest thou tether again Jesus answered are there not 12 hours in a day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep and said his disciples Lord if he sleep he shall do well how be it Jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead can you imagine Jesus saying this next words and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him then saith Thomas which is called didymus unto his fellow disciples let us also go that me we may die with him then when Jesus came he found that he had Lane in the grave four days already let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we know that you are the bread of life and that you have come down from heaven and we know that mankind cannot live on bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and Father we believe that each one of these words proceeded out of your mouth and father we just accept them the way that you have given them and we pray Lord that you would just break them open fresh to us once again Lord that we would just grow and and learn and that we would just have a deeper love and a greater relationship with you father we love you and we thank you we just commit all the rest of this service into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated for those people who don't know unfortunately our internet is down and it's just the way it is so we'll have to upload the recording later as I understand is it is it still down I think it is still down um unfortunately that's the area of the city that we live in the internet is terrible Lord willing will find a solution for those people who stream and uh and whatnot that join us that way um yesterday we we had the funeral for sister Tina and I think it's uh it's a very sad time and we have to say farewell to one of our beloved one of our brothers one of our sisters when someone gets called home by the Lord it is very difficult for us here and today I just want to maybe expound upon what we talked about yesterday we had the funeral and I took from from this scripture and they gave me a space of time to to speak and and I was honored to be able to to do that and there was people there at the funeral which we see at just about every funeral even when it's a Believer there's people from all walks of life but something excuse me I think something happened in that in that time in that moment everyone came together in one mind and one Accord it was an amazing time and I took from John chapter 11 the scripture that we're going to get into and uh The Story of Lazarus and and we're not expecting to see sister Tina raised from the grave that's not where I'm going with this at all um if I had to make a title I would say I am the resurrection and the life not just the resurrection because you know many people can be raised from the dead and they'll still die again in this world in this flesh but we have to have the life and and that's really what I want to expound upon today but I just want to go over sort of what we talked about a little bit about yesterday and and maybe really preach it today if that's okay you know the group yesterday they gave me a little space of time and I I I just barely got started with what I had in store and I wasn't sure how much time there would be and uh there's never enough time I guess when you're a preacher once upon a time I thought how could I ever stand to be at the pulpit for half an hour or 40 minutes or an hour and now it seems I feel pressured to to shut up so we'll just see what the Lord does today you know in our scripture um if we just carry on I didn't want to keep us standing we'll just pick up from from verse 14. I just think it's amazing maybe we'll just go back and read verse 4 before we go too far I just want to sort of bring this to light here verse 4 of chapter 11 of John when Jesus heard that he's that he said that Lazarus was sick when Jesus heard that he said the sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby I think it's amazing when we look at this because as Believers today sometimes we think you know I I I know as Believers today we look at it and we say every single sickness is from the devil and we had a prophet very clearly lay that out for our for us it wasn't God that put this sickness on Lazarus it was the devil that put the sickness on Lazarus but only because God said you can do it and it's going to be for my glory that's the only reason you can do this and I'm going to allow you to do it but God doesn't put a sickness on anybody I think it's very important to recognize that but here we have God in flesh in Jesus Christ the the man walking on Earth saying this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God a sickness can be for the glory of God are you serious this is God's word this is what God is saying this isn't just a disciples interpretation or a prophet's meaning this is what God is saying the sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the son of God might be glorified thereby I think that's a beautiful statement don't you that God would speak those words because many times we see afflictions come on our lives come into our our our groups and our circumstances and our situations can be terrible but take hope brothers and sisters take courage because the only reason it's happening is so that it can be for the glory of God it's not so that we can be destroyed it's so that we can magnify the Lord and say you know the reason this is happening is because you first allowed it to happen to me and if you're allowing it to happen to me there's something you want to see come out of me there's a character that you're going to squeeze out of me and it's going to change me I'm not going to be the same person that I was there's no way that Mary and Martha and all of the other believers were the same people after his resurrection especially Lazarus but then verse 14 then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead I want you to understand he says to them I understand the situation full well I might be sounding like I'm speaking in Parables but let's just get right down to the the rubber meets the road let's get to the Brass tax he's dead his life has left him corruption has set in but but as the son of man stands before you now I'm going to show you who you're really dealing with here verse 15 and I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent that ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him what a tremendous tremendous thought he wanted them to know that he was dead he wanted Lazarus to be good and dead but isn't it wonderful to think that Lazarus Soul could never go too far brother Branham talks about how his soul was gone for four days where did his soul go but it was never Out Of Reach for God because his soul was right there in his hand wasn't it verse 16 then said said Thomas which is called didymus unto his fellow disciples let us go off so that we may die with him totally not understanding totally doubting right he's the one that said unless I I see the the hands and and thrust my hand into his side I won't believe when the girls came back and said you know what the grave is empty they said it was probably Thomas that said it oh it's just an idol Tale even though that's what he said would happen it's amazing verse 17 then when Jesus came he found that he had Lain in the grave four days already now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou Hat's been here my brother had not died remember verse 4. I I didn't come because if I did actually it was verse 15. sorry I'm glad for your sakes that I didn't come because if I did then you wouldn't believe but now you're going to be able to believe I keep jumping around I apologize verse 21 then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou Hat's been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whosoever thou Wilt ask of God will give it thee Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this and we know the story very well I I could go on I don't really want to read the whole chapter we know that Jesus went and and and walked right up there and the people were mourning there was a time of of real mourning and lamenting because they missed their brother they missed him they loved him and and he was dead he was truly gone but what an opportunity to see God glorified in their midst to see God glorified in their lives but what he was doing brothers and sisters was setting an example an enzyme that there will come a day where there will be a resurrection where the graves will open and the dead will come first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet with them in the clouds but in the meantime there's another part of that scripture I am the resurrection and the life and this is where I want to dwell today I'm going to keep sort of laboring on that part I am the life I just want to talk about sister Tina for a moment and I think it's such a beautiful thing when we have testimonies brothers and sisters how important it is to have testimonies I want to say this too in a carnal way if you love someone take the time to tell them that you love them if you love someone take the time to tell them that you love them put your arm around them and get your picture taken with them smile with them it'll bring you comfort because you know one of these days if God doesn't call The Rapture and we go in the sky we're going to go in the grave and we're going to have a time of mourning there's going to be a hole in our lives a whole in our hearts that can never be filled on this side of Eternity that's the way God created it and we know that was instituted in the Garden of Eden by the choice of man another man not us but another man chose that because he loved his bride his wife was deceived she was a part of him and he loved her so much that he was willing to step out from his position as a fully adopted son of God as the one that was created without a belly button the Son of God Adam loved his bride so much that he said I understand what I'm going to forsake but I'm going out after her because I love her I'm willing to die because he knew that was the consequences of following her we know we've probably heard it many times that he could have said no I need another one this one's tainted give me another one Lord but he didn't because God knew exactly how he would behave because he created man in his own image knowing that that was an example of what Christ would do and here we have Christ now coming to demonstrate there will be a resurrection but there's got to be a life the only way there's going to be a resurrection is to demonstrate that life in our lives and our life isn't enough brothers and sisters it's got to be his life it's got to be that word that we sang about he he sent his word are we willing to accept that word if we're not willing to accept that word then we're not going to be able to have his life there's only one way we're going to have his life sister Tina she wrote some testimonies out and gave them to us and and and I just want to read one of them today because I think that even though she has gone to the Grave this voice speaks out from the grave it speaks Beyond it it's a life it's the testimony of a real believer she says Shalom people of God I would like to thank the Lord for this opportunity he gives me to be with you again today this is a believing sister who had to deal with sickness and I apologize I've read this before some people might be saying grown brother Barry you're doing this again if you are just bear with me but if if you you're not and and you understand what I'm trying to get to today remember that this is a sister that is now in glory imagine what she's saying imagine what she's thinking whose hands are she shaking how many people's necks have she hugged all the time since she's been gone now she says I would like to thank the Lord for this opportunity he gives me to be with you again today this is a privilege brothers and sisters to gather together on this side of Eternity she said I spend a month and a half in the hospital heart failure the diagnosis was very bad dramatic I was on the verge of death but despite the seriousness of the situation I clung to the promises of God reminding him what he said about me I think it's so beautiful what do you say about you brothers and sisters do we know what he said about us I think it's so good if we can just take the time to go back and and remind ourselves about what he said about us and then we can remind him about what he said about us there's nothing more powerful than for a child to say but daddy do you remember what you said to me when a child can remind his parents of their word oh my it's enough to melt a parent's heart despite the seriousness of the situation I clung to the promises of God reminding him what he said about me a list of what God Said was necessary for me so that each time when I was in too much pain or doubt or medical team with his report I had to remind God what he said I think this is beautiful it makes me want to make a checklist myself when I start to hear the doctor's report when I start to hear the other stuff going on when I get down in my spirit maybe when I get sick in my body when when I need to just remind myself sometimes it's good just to have a quick checklist just to go over and just say wow this this this this I had to remind God what he said I say God you said I love this part daddy you said again and again that way I can hold on I would like to thank all of you who have prayed for me or showed your kindness to me this is Sister Tina saying it to you today if you've ever prayed for her she would like to thank you but now she doesn't need our prayers she's in glory what a tremendous thing for oh I'll just read it again I would like to thank all of you who have prayed for me or showed your kindness to me even a lovely family here send money to me may God richly bless them also and sister Joy sister Sharon's mom from Edmonton may God bless her a nice sister a woman of faith she called me to encourage me every day now I'm getting better and better every day I can say now God you did it God bless you all praise the Lord sister Tina sorry for the poor English this testimony came out last year and so some might say well where is she now she's in the grave isn't she yeah her body is in the grave but she's with the Lord and you know one way or another we've got to go we know that Paul said to live as Christ that's that's the testimony of the believer to live as Christ it doesn't matter what the doctor's report says I'm going to hold to the promises of God but hey to die is to gain that that means that I'm no longer dealing with any of the problems here I I step from time back into eternity and I get my theophany body I'm never going to be sick I'm never going to be tired I'm never going to be sad I'm never going to be frustrated I'm never going to be confused I'm never going to be angry never going to have to deal with any of the things that we have to deal with in this body here I'm saying all this to say maybe it's not such a bad thing to pass away when you're a believer when we know where we're going to go we need to know where we're going to go because One Way Or Another We're going to go there's no promise for us when we go out this door today as we heard what was it last weekend or the weekend before it was last weekend wasn't it the livesies we certainly thanked the Lord for watching over them one block from the church right after service the devil takes his agents and crashes into their van wrecks their van gives them injuries one block from church talked about it before brothers and sisters I personally believe it and I like to just explain it the way that I visualize it I think the Lord shows me is I think his angels we know that he has his angels encamped about those who fear Him but I like to make it a little more graphic to think that that trailer and truck that crashed into their van it was God's angels that just lubricated them to pass by and it was only the van that was really hurt they sustained some injuries from it but what could it have been I want to say that was the hand of God in their life we have reason to rejoice we're certainly thankful to see them being able to serve the Lord almost seems like as soon as they took a step forward to play here the devil's had an onslaught but we know that God's in control how many are going to pray for the livesies just hold them up in prayer just just ask the Lord to continue to watch over them that's why we have a body of Believers so we can pray one for another we can confess our faults one to another and pray for one another that we might be healed that's why we come to church brothers and sisters to be a part of the body all right certainly thankful for the life of sister Tina going through kovitz she had so many encouraging words for me she she phoned me and would encourage me and and it just surprised me because I knew that she was sick at the times that she was calling me to encourage me and I'm I'm I'd say you know relatively speaking perfectly healthy but yet I've got someone who is ill calling to encourage me what a testimony I would say that is the life of the Resurrection in the sister and that truly is our our our Anchor Point we have the ability to to just see that life live out through each one of ours I got ahead of myself here got excited I apologize we've got some announcements um Andrew brother Andrew Glover will be here next weekend and uh we're certainly excited to see what the Lord has in store for that we have the Youth Event on the 18th of this month we have a ladies brunch on the 26th I believe and we have a potluck Fellowship after service on the 27th for those people who are able to attend it certainly is a time a wonderful time of Fellowship and we trust that each one will be blessed are you happy this morning we have uh Saint John 11. verse 26 I just think it's a beautiful thought whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe thou this believe us thou this you know brother Branham preaches the service believeth though this and he takes this text and and talks about being uh you know Lazarus being raised from the dead and you know we have we have this this situation the story that we're talking about this morning where Jesus is called on the scene but he doesn't turn up right when he's called and I think it's such an important part of the believer's life to recognize the believer's life in Christ is not formulated after meta it's not formed after skip the dishes it's not formed after McDonald's it's not formed after any kind of man's thinking or ideas this world that we live in is created according to the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil brother Branham says it very clearly rather God says it very clearly through brother Branham that this is Satan's Eden all civilization is created for Satan it's Satan's kingdom and you know God is not going to conform to Satan's kingdom there was no other age where where Satan was called the god of the age except for this age that we live in right now this is Satan's Ed and this is Satan's kingdom and God doesn't answer the way that Satan is training man to look for answers God is Not on speed dial all we have to do is speak our voice God hears it his ears are always open to our prayers but he's going to answer our prayers in his time and he's going to do it in his way it's not going to be our way it's not going to be Hollywood's way it's not going to be according to music or movies or the way that maybe traditionally we think it should be we can jump up and down and scream and shout while we pray and that's not going to cause God to move any sooner or be any later the only thing that's going to move God is Faith in his word being able to believe if we can do that then we're going to see something happen the only way that's going to happen is for that Resurrection to happen in our lives for him to resurrect in our life and when that happens brothers and sisters we're going to have a testimony that we live not that we talk about talk is cheap saying that I'm a Christian I believe the message God sent a prophet all of that is great but can we live it if we can't live it then what we're doing is sending a mixed signal and I would say God have mercy on our souls if we're going to live in this world and claim the message of the hour and give a mixed signal to people wanting to know Christianity oh you have wonderful services and and you're such a fine person in church but I can't do a business deal with you because you're going to skin me I know it or maybe you gotta temper like a buzz saw you know what we can all live in this world we live in this Human Condition but when we live in this Human Condition the life of that Resurrection is going to come forward and it's going to right the wrongs we're not just going to sweep it under the rug that's the difference that's the only difference the believer is going to say my I'm wrong I'm sorry will you forgive me and you know one of the biggest deceptions in this world even around the message of the hours for people to say you weren't sincere how do you know how do you know your brother your sister is not sincere it's not between you and them it's between them and God at that point if they've come according to the word of God I say Lord help me to be sincere help me to receive the the Forgiveness when people forgive me and help me to have the Forgiveness back to people we live in this Human Condition and isn't it amazing that song that we sang I am the Lord that sent my word to heal our disease sometimes our disease isn't just uh it's not just something that's that's that's destroying our flesh it's not something that's actually taking us down to the Grave sometimes it's mental sometimes we got something wrong with our brains brothers and sisters sometimes there's some short-circuited wiring inside there and Satan loves it that way he'll take it and make it his playground we have illness in the flesh and we have illness in the mind both illnesses but we know that he sent his word to heal our disease and all we have to do is say Amen to that word we just need to say be it unto me according to Thy word you have sent your word I have accepted it and now I can see that Resurrection coming forth in my life and it's causing a life to live out through me this flesh is going to go to the Grave if we don't go to the sky it's got to happen but you know the believer he's going to say Amen you know what if that's the way the Lord wants it to be then that's the way it's going to be and and maybe he's done with me maybe he's used me maybe I've fulfilled the purpose of my life we know we we read that that scripture in yesterday in in Sister Tina's funeral it's second Timothy 4 7 I fought the good fight I've finished the race I've kept the faith sometimes in our lives that's what happens and God takes us home and when he does that it's no accident we've done what we're supposed to do God doesn't ring his hands and say oh my there's an emergency there's an accident something has happened we need to get a special counsel together and get the angels to go and investigate what happened and and have a big investigation no everything happens because God said so otherwise he's not God and we have the ability to say Amen to to believe that to recognize that he he is allowed it to happen that way for a purpose we don't know many times what the purpose is but by and by we will you know this death that we have to contend with it it entered in the human race back in Genesis verse chapter 2 verse 16. I'll just read it for the sake of time and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die you're gonna die if you do it but here we have the situation the circumstance we talked about it earlier Adam had a wife that was taken from his side the very first surgery that was ever performed was God taking Eve out of Adam she wasn't created as a separate being she was created from him brother Branham called her a byproduct meaning a part of him not just a leftover piece of waste sometimes people can treat their wives that way and that's false that's wrong but she she was a part of him and he loved her so much that he was willing to leave his first estate he was willing to forget what it was like to live in the garden and we know that he took her he stepped down and went after his bride because she was deceived we know that Adam wasn't deceived but here we go thousands of years later the promise that God knew in the back of his mind before the foundation of the world his plan was coming to fruition so he could actually manifest the attributes that were inside of him that were in his thoughts before there ever was a sun moon or Stars before there is even Stardust he knew that Adam would take his bride he knew that she would fall he knew that he would follow her because of the love that love wasn't something that Adam just had and that he found somewhere along the way that he was taught somehow that someone explained to him that was a love that was given to him because he was the son of God that was God's Own love that manifested in Adam to go out after his bride and here we have Jesus on the scene thousands of years later and I want to say not just Jesus as a second or third person many times we can look at it that way let's just say it this way here we have God manifested in the flesh coming down now and and recognizing fellowshipping with his Brethren and saying to them you know what I'm glad I didn't go down there because you guys wouldn't necessarily believe but I know because I am the one who created everything from the beginning I know that you will now believe when you see it for yourself and here we have Jesus telling them that I am the resurrection and the life who could say that for those people that want to say Jesus wasn't God who could raise someone from the dead who could declare I am the resurrection and the life there's only one there's only one that could ever claim that I think it's so beautiful how we have this this story verse 20 then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming when and met with him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou Wilt ask of God God will give it thee not recognizing that she's speaking to God whatever you decide to do will happen Jesus say It unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again at the resurrection of the last day Jesus saith unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this isn't it wonderful how he poses the question at the end he says whoever believes in me you'll never die even though you're dead in your sin in your trespasses if you believe in me you'll never die that's not even going to be possible and that's where I think as a Believer we have the ability to recognize to live as Christ to die is gain what would happen if we had no fear in our lives what could we do what could we accomplish if we had no fear if we had no Financial fear we could just get into whatever Adventure we want to and just go for it and you'll never fail financially you'll just be blessed you'll have all the money you want all you got to do is just go to the bank and just take money out as much as you want do as many wire transfers as you desire whatever you want to do or or maybe an education you could just go and get whatever degree you want as many of them as you want I just think it's amazing when we think about that because we have that level of of of gift given to us but it's just not tangible according to this world we have more than any of that because all of that is this world's riches this world's wealth this world's knowledge but to think about what it's going to be like on the other side where sister Tina is right now I apologize if this is kind of like a funeral I don't want to make it like a funeral I want to make this a celebration of life because she had that Resurrection in her and she was able to have that life that's what sustained her to write these testimonies and that's why I want to talk about it today as soon as I heard that she was sick in the hospital I went to see her just hours before she passed away I saw her hands folded in the casket and I thought thank you Lord I was able to hold her hand and just pray with her and just commit her life into your care Lord just to think that she was just moments away from stepping over into Glory my you know when she was there in the room just hours before she passed away she kept wanting to get up and walk and and the nurse kept saying no you you you you can't really get up and walk and she was connected to the machine and I don't know she had lots of tubes and and machines and everything go in there and and her daughter said no you you can't get up and walk mom you have to stay and so they sat her up and she just wasn't comfortable she was ready to go is what I could see she wanted to get moving she was tired of what was going on there I just think it was an amazing thing to see her she knew that Resurrection because she had that life it was a part of who she was you know out of 1964 then Jesus came and called at 640213 we've got a few quotes today it's paragraph 62 and he said I am the resurrection and the life though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die I am that's the I am that was in the burning bush with Moses I just think it's beautiful and and I I could dwell there for a little while but I just want to make sure that we don't have any different IMs I want to make sure that we understand that Jesus Christ standing in the flesh was not the first person the second person or the third person of any Trinity he was God himself and we have brother Branham saying that he was the exact same I am in that Burning Bush when he was going down to Pharaoh's house it wasn't just Moses standing there I am said let my people go that was I am in that man standing there saying that declaring it he was donating his voice and his body but brother Branham says that's the I am that was in the burning bush with Moses I am the resurrection I am the life I was the wall I am still he I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die I think the believer can see that remember we read beyond the curtain of time if anybody didn't hear it or or didn't see it or maybe you just haven't thought about it for a little while just look it up beyond the curtain of time or just text me if you don't know I'd be happy to send it to you brother Branham gives that graphic description of what it's like beyond the curtain of time and he said there's only one thing that's going to make it there and that only one thing that's going to make it there is perfect love that's charity that's Jesus Christ the man himself I am living out through us the resurrection and the life living out through us that perfect love is Jesus Christ himself it's not a bunch of different intangible things we could say it's the Holy Ghost and we could say that it's charity it's all the same thing it's Jesus Christ I am God's own life Elohim living out through us whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die after this great assurance that she had that he was the promised word when he said being a prophet he could not lie therefore he when he said I am the I am I am he that is the resurrection and the life I just think this story is amazing to think God in flesh Elohim standing there in the body of a human being created in a perfect conception the sieging of God connecting with an egg of God inside a borrowed womb of Mary Mary and Joseph having nothing to do with it except for one person a virgin to his word through the messenger through that angel messenger she was a virgin to that word because she said hey just be it unto me according to Thy word I don't understand it but I believe it and what happened that that being that started was the Holy Ghost the son of the Holy Ghost and that's why people have so much confusion they want to try and tie it all together and make it a trinitarian thing you know what it was the power of the highest that came over Mary and that's what happened it was Jesus Christ that came from her womb and it's the same thing for the Bride of Jesus Christ today when the human being recognizes the word given through an angel messenger and she just says I don't understand it I don't I really don't get it but I believe it something happens there's a spiritual conception when that moment happens brothers and sisters it causes that person to become a virgin to the word it's not a virgin in our flesh in our bodies in in our minds it's to the word in our heart meaning there's nothing else that we want to accept we just want to accept him that life or the Amplified Bible John 11 25 and 26 Jesus said unto her I am myself the resurrection and the life whosoever believes in adheres to trust sin and relies on me although he may die yet shall he live one of these days we could go into the grave we don't know I just think it's so important the only way we're going to get out of the Grave is to recognize that resurrection and life right now the only way that's going to happen is for us to just understand we have to just accept the word for our day and when we do that when we do that we're going to say hey be it unto me according to Thy word and if Thy word says to just repent for our sins get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ repenting for our sins then we shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and when we do receive the gift of the Holy Ghost then we have that token in our hand then we know we have that Resurrection in life and you know what I want to say this brothers and sisters you have that Resurrection in life at the moment you say I want to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of my sins you don't get the Holy Ghost when you come up out of the water you don't see a dove come down you don't see a pillar of fire it doesn't happen that way it's it's a spiritual conception when you say be it unto me according to Thy word you get that gift of the Holy Ghost and you know what it'll start to manifest in many different ways but I want to say the very first way that it will manifest is your willingness to become subject to the word when you say I want to be baptized that's when you can demonstrate that you've got the Holy Ghost because you've got the outward expression of the inward work that's already happening but there's some people that will say no I've been baptized in the name of the father in the name of the son in the name of the Holy Ghost according to the scriptures but you haven't been baptized at all that's what the prophet said because who's the father we can go over this every single time and it might be Elementary but there might be people that don't know this brothers and sisters without the Holy Ghost we're lost as lost can be that's what the prophet said that's what God Said to the prophet to this age without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we are lost as lost can be that's when we're going to shiver and shake when the doctor says you know what you're gonna die and when you look at him and say oh I don't know whether I got that token I don't know oh there's things in my life there's people I haven't forgiven I've got baggage I've got all these different things oh no I know the message of the hour but now I'm going to lament because I don't know whether I know oh no it's going to turn into a big thing but when you know that you've lived according to the word of God he gives you that report you can say I can never die you can take this body but you can't take my soul because it's not my life living out it's his life out of the Amplified Jesus said unto her I myself the resurrection and the life whoever whosoever whoever sorry believes in adheres to trust in and relies on me though he may die yet he shall live that's what this scripture is saying if we have to lay down this body we're going to raise again brothers and sisters it's going to happen it's just a matter of time but while we're here living I think it's so beautiful we have this testimony sister Tina has now this testimony she's gone to the Grave her body went to the Grave she never went to the Grave she went to heaven she went to be with the Lord and she's going to be there until but you know while we're here we who are alive and remain we've got the ability to comfort one another with these words to recognize that we have a testimony also and we can write our testimonies out we can come and take the opportunity to take the mic when we have a communion service or maybe even just a testimony service and just give God the glory and tell what God has done for us in our lives what he's done for me it's not about anybody else it's what he's done for me I just want to say praise the Lord brothers and sisters as well another opportunity for a testimony I was at the funeral yesterday and I heard a familiar sound and maybe it's not the greatest sound but to hear sister jarmaine come up the the the pathway to come down the aisle walking she's not in a wheelchair we need to give God the glory we've had her on our prayer request we've been praying for sister jarmaine and her family and here they are today they walked in the building he is the resurrection and the life if we can just believe on that just because he takes someone home doesn't mean he has lost any power at all the only thing that's happened is it's his will coming to pass nobody dies by accident verse 26 out of the Amplified and whoever continues to live whoever continues to live and believes in has faith in Cleaves to and relies on me shall never actually die at all I think it's so beautiful do you believe this I am the resurrection and the life God himself manifesting to each and every one of the Believers and the word that we hear the message of the hour brothers and sisters just like Lazarus who is dead in the grave did he even have ears to hear could he hear that voice when Jesus cried with a loud voice brother Adam talks about in the message the rapture oddly enough the whole story about Lazarus but could he hear that voice I don't think in his body he could corruption had already said and maybe his eardrum started to dry up and crack maybe there was holes in his eardrums and his body brother Bradham talks about his nose being sunk into his face I don't want to go too graphic but you know what his his physical body was irrelevant because it was the soul that he was calling it wasn't even his own life there's no life on this Earth that's our life brothers and sisters if we've got breath in our lungs it's God's own life living out through us every single breath is a gift from God every time we can bat our eyes every tear we cry every emotion we feel that is a gift from God that might sound crazy but you know brothers and sisters we were created in his own image to actually rule and reign with him not to fall but Adam took that step to bring us into this place so now as soon as he took that step you know I mentioned it before I heard a minister talking about this what was it like for Adam to have that very first adrenaline rush when he heard the voice of God walking in the cool of the evening that very first time that that drug came from his mind it released and just went through his whole entire body what did that feel like it caused fear the very first time he had fear he had Adrenaline Rush he had fear all at the very same time so overwhelming that he hid himself from God but it's the voice I am the resurrection and the life and I just want to try and emphasize that all I can today brothers and sisters I am God is the resurrection his life living out through the individuals and we've been given the opportunity to have the life here on Earth so that we can manifest his life back to him we can give our lives to him brother Bradham says it if you want to live why do you want to live if you want to be healed why do you want to be healed what's the purpose for your healing is it just so that you can live a good life and and and maybe have a little bit of a legacy and then go on or are you wanting to live a good life to serve God according to his word are you wanting to fulfill God's purpose in your life why do we want to be healed as Believers we want to serve God with all of our hearts but you know I I just want to go to a maybe another little bit of a level with all of this and and just say that you know what there was a time of mourning brothers and sisters there was a time of mourning even Jesus himself and now let's go back in the conversation a little bit we're saying Jesus but remember Jesus was God he wept at the tomb of Lazarus and there's people that stumble at that and say well he was just a man when he did that and you know what yeah he was a man he was all man when he cried but he was all God when he put his shoulders back and squared up to that tomb and said Lazarus come forth [Music] I am the resurrection and the life there was a time of mourning and you know what in our lives brothers and sisters there's a time of mourning because of Adam's choice not ours we mourn it's it's an emotional time for us when we lose a loved one when somebody passes on goes beyond the curtain of time for us here that remain we which are alive and remain you know what we need to comfort one another with these words to recognize there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a meeting in the air and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them you know it sure doesn't feel like it many times in my life I Stumble and I fall how many stumble and fall in your lives the key to it is get up the believer gets back up just get up the Believers got that kind of a grit in their lives they just get back up again they don't stay down and say I can't live it because remember we are not the resurrection and the life he is I am the resurrection and the life if we can get it that way where he lives that life through us then you know what we'll be able to get back up again but if we say I want to try and live the message of the hour we're never going to do it we're going to fall flat on our face every single time and we're going to wonder why do we even bother trying but boy oh boy when he comes to town I am gets in our lives it changes everything and you know what sure we still mourn remember Jesus Jesus cried he wept at the tomb of Lazarus I think it's beautiful to a degree because what it does is it shows that God himself was tempted in all points just like we are God knows what it's like to have a broken heart God knows what it's like to lose someone really close to us but his word says I'll never leave you or forsake you you're going to go through times of mourning you're going to lose loved ones and you're going to miss them dearly and there's nothing on Earth no words of comfort that can ever fill that hole in our heart but there's a time for everything and that's the word of God it's not something that was just a good song that came around somewhere along the way any good song that quotes the word of God is just something that's a perversion of the word of God and I'm talking about something that I know from the world so forgive me for even going there but you know what there's a time there is a season for every single thing under the sun and you know Jesus God I am the one who was the resurrection and the life he sat everyone down one day and told them on the hillside blessed are they who mourn for they shall be comforted he didn't just talk about other things he specifically said blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted somewhere along the way they shall be comforted and who knows how it will come maybe it will come through a brother maybe it will come through a sister maybe it will come through a sermon maybe it will come from listening to a tape maybe it will come from reading the Bible maybe it will come from a dream maybe it will come from prayer we don't know where it will come from but the word of God says that they shall be comforted and we can just take that and say Amen I'll take that all day long when we lose people it's not easy turn with me over to the Book of Ecclesiastes we talked about this yesterday I just thought it would be so good to read it I was just mentioning it a little bit Ecclesiastes chapter 3. verse 1 it says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven we could just pause there and think about that every single purpose under heaven there is a season and a Time there's no accidents in this world this is the word of God verse 2 says a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get time to lose a time to keep a time to Cast Away a time to Rend a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak A Time To Love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace I just want to jump down to verse 14. this is Solomon speaking I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God do with it that men should fear before him I just can't help but think that is such a beautiful scripture that verse 14. of Our Lives when we live the testimony of Jesus Christ in our lives when we live that resurrection and we demonstrate his life it's God that does it and it's forever isn't it beautiful to think that when we have the ability to believe when we're saved when we truly get saved brothers and sisters we're saved until the day of our Redemption until we get to our destination we're not saved today and we go outside the church and we stumble and we fall and and then we have to go and and repent and hopefully God will take us back into his lap and forgive us you know what his ear is always open to our prayers he always always is waiting for us to come back to him we heard the prophet of God say it so many times you know how can we ever get back to God and he says just go back to where you got off just find that place where you had that issue and if you have any problems trying to find that place I dare you just ask them in all sincerity I promise you he'll show you brother Branham tells that story about that Soldier Boy out on the field the chaplain coming to him while he's dying he took a bullet or shrapnel to his chest and his lungs are filling up with blood and he doesn't have much time the chaplain's not going to be able to save him the Medics can't help him nobody can help him the blood is filling up in his lungs and he's just about to die and the chaplain tells him are you okay are you ready to meet God and the boy says I don't know I don't know and he says do you remember where you got off I'm paraphrasing heavy here just for time's sake but the boy says no I don't and the chaplain says you better hurry up you better figure it out because you've only got a minute or so left your lungs are filling with blood and he says the boy he remembers he remembers where he got off the place where he just did that thing you know brother Bradham preaches the sermon from that time there's always the time brothers and sisters just that one little thing that we did somewhere along the way just that one time from that time that's where it changed for me and you know what God stays there just waiting for us to come back to him but so long as we're willing to come back to him he'll say hey it's all good I've loved you from beginning before the foundation of the world don't you worry that's all we have to do but maybe it sounds contrary to what I was saying brothers and sisters a son and daughter of God is always going to go back to him we're never going to just say no I can't be I can't be saved it's just never going to happen I've sinned away my day of Grace there's going to come a time where we're going to look back in our lives and we're going to say wow I just need to get back to where I was but you know what brothers and sisters is a time for everything single thing under the sun there's a time for every season and every single purpose if we have mourning in our hearts today because our dear sister Tina has passed on it's a normal human condition we are supposed to mourn that's the word of God but the word of God says that we will be comforted somewhere along the way nobody can tell us you know what according to my calculations you've mourned enough time is up you need to just get on with life and get better some people have the audacity to say those words but those are the people that don't recognize the word of God he doesn't put a time stamp on it he says they shall be comforted that's all sometimes it can take a day sometimes it can take a week sometimes it can take a year you know what sometimes you'll never be comforted all the way at the loss of a loved one it's just the way it works sometimes it's a temporary comforting maybe it's just a little bit of a fix for a while and it gets us through another day another week another month but that's the curse we live under and we can't escape it but you know if the devil ever tries to take our flesh we will never go to the Grave we'll go to our reward and you know what it shall be forever the thing I I just wanna I don't want to dwell on the morning part but you know what it is a normal thing we can actually mourn we can weep it's important for us to do that it really is I heard someone say it yesterday you know the tears they cleanse our soul I think it's so good we need to be able to mourn we need to be able to weep God himself wept at the tomb of Lazarus some people will stumble and say well that was that was just a man and sure enough maybe it was but he came to be tempted in all points just like us you know brothers and sisters there was another time in this story and it was a time of great rejoicing wasn't it when they rolled back the stone and they said Oh Lord he stinketh he's been in the Tomb four days now are you sure what are you doing and he said just trust me I am the resurrection and the life just trust me just just put your faith in me and see what happens and you know brothers and sisters there was a time of great rejoicing and isn't it interesting I just want to throw this in there I find it astounding I found it a little while ago the word of God says that the the Pharisees or the Sadducees the the religious leaders of the day they desired to put Lazarus back in that grave because of the testimony of Jesus Christ they wanted to kill him so that people would stop talking about that Resurrection can you believe that who does that who who who is able to resurrect someone from the dead outside of Jesus Christ up until then no one but they didn't like it because it was against their traditions we talked about it on Wednesday it was against their thinking they had everything figured out in their mind all of their traditional ways were already there and when something new came along when it was time to turn a corner in the ministry of Jesus Christ it was just more than they could bear they just couldn't comprehend how could it be different than than what we actually believe our traditions you know they uh they desired to put him to death for the good that he did isn't that interesting and not so much for the good that he did but for who he claimed to be and he wasn't lying that's the tragedy but it wasn't even for their sake it was for ours that's why they were blinded so that we could have this Resurrection in life in our lives one day we know that we're going to see our sister Tina we talked about it yesterday there has to be people that go on before us as brother Branham said that you know about about a month or so I think he said in the message that there will be people that actually come forward just like when Abraham and Sarah brother Bradham said they wanted to make a Whistle Stop they said Lord on the way to heaven could we just make a whistle stop back in Jerusalem and just go and see the old place could we just go and and see the old people and just get that refreshment and and God said sure go ahead yeah go no problem just go and take a look at the old place and and walk around and they saw that people saw them right is that the scripture the people started to recognize them and they said oh we need to get out of here they're starting to see us you know that's going to happen again brothers and sisters and we need people that will recognize to come back to see us again but these people in this story they called on Jesus but he didn't come right away he knew who he was he had full confidence in the word he wanted to see all of this come to pass he wanted to see it play out he wanted to see them get sad he wanted to see them mourn he wanted to show them the full power of the manifestation of his word he said even for your sakes I'm glad that I didn't come and and I find that astounding and that can be a confusing thing for us as Believers when we call on his name and he doesn't come the way that we think he should that can confuse us what we need to do is just trust him and say Lord I don't understand this but I know that it's in your time and in your way because you said I am the resurrection and the life and I just I I said this yesterday I think I wanted to so bad I'm going to say it today there's a reason why sister Tina lived the way that she did there's a reason why she had these testimonies it's because she believed that I am for today it wasn't the I was or the I will be it wasn't some historical event or some futuristic idea it was the Jesus Christ of today and the only Jesus Christ of today that we can have our our complete trust in is the Jesus Christ that came according to the message of the hour through a Vindicated prophet because there's no other Vindicated Prophet that brought a message like we have she was able to meet the Jesus Christ of today the present tense I am for herself and because of that brothers and sisters she was able to receive the baptism the true baptism of the Holy Ghost to become a fully adopted son or a fully adopted daughter of God she understood the doctor's report fully the doctor said to her the second last time she went into the hospital we're going to give you a heart pump and you're going to wear it like a backpack and you'll be able to have many more years of of quality of life and she said no my God said he's my healer I'm going to put my trust in him and if he decides not to heal me then he's going to take me home she understood the great Physicians report and I just want to emphasize this you know the word of God says he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live I just wanted to say it this way in in remembrance of sister Tina she that believeth in me though she were dead yet shall she live and you know she's more alive today than she was a few days ago when she was here on Earth isn't she I I hope we're okay for a few more minutes I'm not gonna go too much longer I don't really think so but I just want to bring out one more point about this talking about the resurrection understanding that God has a purpose in our lives and that we have to go through these times of mourning we have to go through weeping we have to go through the the the law of the contrast so that we can understand what it means to be able to dance there Comes A Time under heaven where we will dance again if we're weeping if we're mourning it will happen it's the word of God job story of Job he saw something didn't he I'm not going to try and take too much time with this brothers and sisters but I just have a quote and maybe a few comments and then we'll close but you know what brother Branham says that it was in The Darkest Hour that job he saw something wasn't it didn't job lose everything that he had except for his wife and his own life and could you imagine the amount the level of Calamity in that man's life to hear that his sons and daughters they they died and and while they yet spoke another messenger comes and says all of your business venture all of your interests are wiped out and while he yet spoke something else another Calamity all of these things one after the other after the other because God said do whatever you want to do whatever you want to just don't touch his life can you imagine that was God's will do we think that he doesn't talk about us can promise you brothers and sisters speaks your name then Jesus came and called paragraph 118. he said if a tree goes down in the grave a scent of rain The Roots come out again if a flower dies the little seed lays there and bursts open the pope runs out of it there ain't a way you can find the life in it but when spring comes around up comes that Little Flower again now there's hope if a flower dies if a tree dies but a man said he layeth down he giveth up the ghost his sons come to honor him and he perceive it not job wanted to know when they plant a seed in the ground and it comes up but they plant a man in the ground and he don't come up now he said what about all of this and I can't help but imagine brothers and sisters how many times we would say those words maybe not in our mouth maybe we wouldn't utter those words but in our mind maybe in our heart and I can tell you for a certain that I have the reason I'm saying it is because I have we had a baby at one time and we had to give that perfectly healthy baby up he just came too premature and we had to just commit him back to God we didn't come to the front of the church and give a baby dedication we just had a baby and dedicated it to God and then God took him home and one day we're going to see Timothy come knocking on our door saying take comfort mommy and daddy your day is near so I just want to tell you I'm not just saying this because I think it's cool and I'm trying to express that you should be or shouldn't be away I want to say that I can relate this to my life this means something to me when they plant a seed in the ground and it comes up but they plant a man in the ground and you don't come up now what about all this and especially for the Believers of this message of the hour we get into the first and the second polls we should be able to have a prayer meeting we should be able to bring people up anoint them with oil and see them dance out of the church God's got a perfect will and his will will always come to pass his way it's not up to us to tell him what his will is it's up to us to just simply believe that it's for his purpose and by and by we'll be able to thank him for it we'll be able to rejoice but the Bradham goes on to say and he couldn't understand it sometimes in our lives we can't understand it how a man much more Glory than a flower a man much more Glory than a tree in the image of God and yet he planted him in the ground and that settled it his sons come to mourn and he perceive it not oh that thou would hide me in the grave that thou would keep me in the secret place till thy wrath be past that anointest me a time and a place I cannot pass notice now when all this distress come and his friends turn their back on him and accusing him of being a secret sinner I just want to pause there for a second it just emphasize this brothers and sisters when God's will happens when somebody passes away it's not because we've sinned we're not secret sinners I beat myself up for years thinking that I did something wrong or I didn't do something right I was the cause of whatever happened it's not the case it's God's perfect will nobody dies out of punishment because of what we've done maybe that was the prophet's story but I want to say today that's not yours now you might say how would you know brother Mary I don't know but I want to tell you don't live in condemnation thinking that maybe something happened or didn't happen that could have or should have happened nobody goes home unless God invites them nobody you're not a secret sinner if you have confessed your sin before the Lord if you've died out to yourself if you have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you have received the gift of the Holy Ghost you don't lose that gift of the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters you have that gift of the Holy Ghost until the day of your destination or your Redemption you have it goes on to say wife had turned him down everybody had turned him down said his breath was strange to his wife she didn't even want to smell him and all the things that happened to him and look like God turned him down if we have Calamity in our lives it doesn't mean God's turned us down means that God loves us if we're weeping it means that God loves us if if we're mourning it means that God loves us that his word applies to us in our lives all the things that happen to him look like God turned him down and when he's going to die and go into the ground but brothers and sisters there came a time where God came and spoke to job it was no longer his friends brother Branham says that it was maybe the deacons in the church that came around and said you're a secret sinner it was the Believers in another part he says but there came a time where God himself came and spoke to job and I promise you there will come a time where God will come and speak to you in your situation God spoke to him as much as it is to say job now gird up your loins I'm going to talk to you and then when he said you see the tree never sinned the flower never sinned it served my purpose therefore it was dermatized one to the other and it didn't sin so it rises up again but man sinned therefore he's cut off so then job began to wonder and then he got into distress just like Martha did in the darkest hour when all of his influence he had lived had he lived it in vain That's what Satan does to us isn't it remember the prophet of God when Sharon Rose was laid on his wife in the hospital dying doctors told him there's no hope your wife's gone now your baby too don't go down there and see her because she she'll infect you you'll get infected and he said I'm going to see her and he saw the little baby Sharon Rose cross-eyed with flies in her eyes in such Agony and pain and what happened the same thing here the devil came around and said that's the god you serve my you could pray for everyone else and they're healed but look at you must be a secret sinner must be something in your life what have you done but we know that God was squeezing this man God wanted this Prophet to be a little more attentive he didn't want him to listen to anybody else's voice he only wanted him to hear the voice of God that's what Satan's going to do is wait for our darkest hour brothers and sisters he's going to let us go on and on and on and he'll wait till we're at our weakest point or at our darkest hour and then he'll come around and say that's the god you serve you follow that one that God of William Branham you you believe that look at where you're at look at what he's allowed to come upon you look at where you find yourself today 10 years ago you never would have believed this would where you be where you'd be 20 years ago you never would have dreamed your life would wind up like this but here you are today take courage brothers and sisters it's God's will it's God's will for you to have the kingdom I am the resurrection and the life so then job began to wonder and then he got into distress just like Mary Did In The Darkest Hour when all of his influence he had he lived it in vain how would he speak to job he's a prophet how will he speak to him in a vision says then he looked up and the Thunders roared and the Lightnings flashed and Jesus came along I love how he says it because he doesn't say God came along Jesus came along to meet job Jesus came along then he seen him in the last days he said I know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand upon this Earth though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see the darkest hour then Jesus came along brothers and sisters we're going to go into our darkest hours every one of us have to that's the way he created us but then Jesus is going to come on Jesus will come around he will come around if we are faithful if we're willing to just take him at his word just like we sang at the beginning of the service you are the god that sent me your word and and you've healed my disease whatever that disease is brothers and sisters he will do it maybe stand with me as we close today I am the resurrection and the life don't let it be the I am the resurrection and the life in somebody else's life Let It Be Your resurrection and your life have that experience for yourself brothers and sisters it will bring the full confidence in the word it will give us the ability to recognize we're going to mourn we're going to weep we're going to sing we're going to dance we're going through the whole range of emotions in this Human Condition but in the end we'll know that Our Redeemer Lives let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your word Lord we thank you for the encouragement of your word Lord we can listen to a man and a man will never bring us
