[44:46] requests tonight that we would like to
[44:47] remember before the Lord as we go to him
[44:50] in prayer. Brother Johnny Huckluck, just
[44:53] continue thanking the Lord for his will
[44:56] in his life. We have a few unspoken
[44:59] requests tonight. We just want to hold
[45:01] before the Lord. And I have uh an old
[45:04] friend that I had mentioned before. Just
[45:06] want to mention his name again. Sean
[45:09] Mitchell. I believe he's looking for a
[45:11] touch from the Lord. If you have a need
[45:13] tonight, maybe just defy gravity and
[45:16] make it known unto him. Gracious
[45:18] heavenly father, we thank you for this
[45:20] opportunity to gather together in your
[45:22] name. Amen. Lord Jesus, one more time on
[45:26] this side of eternity. Yes. Amen. We
[45:28] don't know how many more times we have
[45:30] these opportunities, Lord.
[45:32] Father, we're just so thankful that we
[45:34] know the only reason that we're here is
[45:36] because you called us here. Father,
[45:40] you spoke to us, Lord. You gave us the
[45:43] ability to hear what the spirit saith
[45:45] unto this church, Lord, into this age.
[45:49] And Father, tonight we celebrate that,
[45:52] Lord, by giving you worship. Hallelujah.
[45:54] Father, what an honor and a privilege it
[45:56] is to worship you, Father, in spirit and
[45:59] in truth. Thank you. And Lord Jesus,
[46:01] tonight we just thank you for your
[46:03] goodness and your tender mercies to each
[46:05] and every one of us. Father, Lord Jesus,
[46:08] tonight we just want to remember each
[46:09] and every request that was made known
[46:11] unto you tonight by the way of an uplift
[46:13] hand. Father, we just want to commit the
[46:16] needs unto you. We know that you are
[46:18] more than able. Father, we want to just
[46:21] remember Shawn Mitchell, the old friend
[46:24] of mine. That you would, Lord, touch
[46:26] him, Lord, in a special way, Father,
[46:28] somehow some way that perhaps he would
[46:31] be able to have an ear to hear as well,
[46:33] Father. That he would be able to drink
[46:36] from this fountain, Lord Jesus, that we
[46:38] live from. Father, we just pray for him
[46:41] tonight. Lord Jesus, we just want to
[46:43] remember the unspoken request. You know
[46:45] the needs, Father. Lord Jesus, sensitive
[46:49] issues, Lord, that only complex
[46:52] problems, Lord, that only you can
[46:54] resolve, Father. Amen. Tonight, we just
[46:56] commit them all unto you, Lord, knowing
[46:58] that you are more than able, Father. And
[47:01] we thank you for working them out
[47:03] according to your will and your purpose.
[47:06] And father, tonight we thank you also
[47:08] for brother Johnny Huckleak, Lord, and
[47:11] the testimony in his life about what
[47:13] you're doing to him and through him.
[47:16] Father, we pray that you would just
[47:18] continue watching over him and
[47:20] encouraging him by your word. And
[47:22] Father, we'll be careful to give you all
[47:24] the praise and all the glory when we see
[47:28] the testimony in his life. Amen. Father,
[47:31] now as we turn to your word, we pray,
[47:33] Lord, that you would, as brother Steve
[47:35] mentioned, that you would just speak to
[47:37] us, Father, help us to push aside all of
[47:39] the cares of this world, Lord, all of
[47:42] our thoughts, all of our carnality,
[47:44] Lord, and just give you the full
[47:46] preeminence that you desire.
[47:49] We just love you and we thank you. We
[47:51] ask all these things in Jesus Christ's
[47:52] name we pray. Amen.
[47:55] Thank you,
[47:56] musicians. Amen. And tonight, if you
[47:59] have your Bibles, I would like to read
[48:00] from the second epistle of Peter,
[48:03] chapter
[48:05] 1. And uh tonight, I would like to
[48:07] tackle begin tackling because I don't
[48:11] think that we'll ever be able to really
[48:13] get it straight. But uh the question,
[48:16] the one question that I did get uh first
[48:18] question about the exposition of the
[48:20] seven church ages from our church age
[48:22] book study and that is on election. I
[48:26] don't know if we will be able to
[48:28] actually uh do it justice in just one
[48:31] service. In fact, I'm pretty sure we
[48:32] won't. So, we'll just see what the Lord
[48:34] will do. But second Peter chapter
[48:39] 1, Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle
[48:42] of Jesus Christ. To them that have
[48:45] obtained like precious faith with us
[48:48] through the righteousness of God and our
[48:51] Savior Jesus Christ.
[48:54] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[48:57] through the knowledge of God and of
[49:00] Jesus our
[49:01] Lord. according as his divine power hath
[49:05] given unto us all things that pertain
[49:08] unto life and
[49:10] godliness through the knowledge of him
[49:13] that hath called us to glory and virtue.
[49:16] Amen. Whereby are given unto us
[49:20] exceeding great and precious
[49:23] promises, that by these ye might be
[49:26] partakers of the divine nature, having
[49:30] escaped the corruption that is in the
[49:32] world through lust. And beside this,
[49:37] giving all diligence, add to your faith
[49:39] virtue, and to your virtue knowledge,
[49:42] and to your knowledge temperance, and to
[49:45] temperance patience, and to patience
[49:47] godliness, and to godliness brotherly
[49:51] kindness, and to brotherly kindness
[49:53] charity.
[49:55] For if these things be in you and
[49:58] abound, they make you that ye shall
[50:02] neither be barren, nor unfruitful in the
[50:05] knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[50:08] Christ. But he that lackth these things
[50:11] is blind, and cannot see a far off, and
[50:15] hath forgotten that he was purged from
[50:18] his old sins.
[50:21] Wherefore the rather, brethren, give
[50:23] diligence to make your calling and
[50:27] election sure. For if ye do these
[50:31] things, ye shall never fall. Let's just
[50:34] bow one more time. Heavenly Father,
[50:36] we're so thankful for your word. We're
[50:39] so thankful that it's not just a
[50:41] textbook, print pages of history, that
[50:45] it's truly a living word. And Father,
[50:48] tonight we pray that you would just take
[50:50] and and breathe life into this word one
[50:53] more time for us tonight, Lord. That
[50:55] when we leave this building tonight, we
[50:57] would say truly we heard from you one
[50:59] more time. We just commit that all
[51:02] that's said and done in to your name. In
[51:05] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God
[51:07] bless you tonight. You may be
[51:10] seated. I uh I think it's just a
[51:14] wonderful study here.
[51:15] this this thought of election and uh
[51:19] looking at the uh the scripture that we
[51:22] read
[51:23] tonight knowing that there is a formula
[51:27] there is actually an instruction there
[51:30] is a method to actually seeing ourselves
[51:34] not fall and there's also a little bit
[51:39] of a reflection looking the other way
[51:40] and I think it's interesting verse 9
[51:42] says after the the virtues
[51:45] you know that we we so often talk about
[51:47] in the pyramid of brother Brham in the
[51:51] church ages we're very familiar with
[51:52] that but in verse 9 it says but he that
[51:55] lackth these things is blind and cannot
[51:59] see a far off and you know many times
[52:02] what happens is we wind up just looking
[52:05] right in front of us at one thing
[52:06] instead of looking at the big picture.
[52:09] He that lackth these things is blind and
[52:11] cannot see a far off, and hath forgotten
[52:13] that he was purged from his old sins.
[52:16] Wherefore the rather, brethren, give
[52:18] diligence, be careful, be cautious, be
[52:21] diligent to make your calling and
[52:24] election
[52:25] sure. I think that's so beautiful and
[52:28] and it's such a wonderful description
[52:30] because if we do that, we're focusing on
[52:33] ourselves. We're saying, Lord, be it
[52:35] unto me according to thy word. Not go
[52:38] and correct brother or or deal with
[52:41] sister, but just deal with me. Change my
[52:45] heart, Lord. It's such a beautiful
[52:47] thing. Amen. And and if we're doing
[52:49] that, it says here, "For if you do these
[52:52] things, ye shall never fall." Who who
[52:55] wants to never fall tonight? I think
[52:56] it's such a beautiful thing. We have a
[52:59] formula for it. And you know, if we're
[53:01] elected of God, we'll never fall. It's
[53:03] that simple. But it's it's not simple.
[53:06] It's one of those simple things. This
[53:07] election discussion is one of those
[53:10] simple things that's very very
[53:12] complicated and very deep. And uh you
[53:15] know, just carnally speaking, there's no
[53:18] way the human mind can understand it.
[53:19] Brother Brandham says it. The only thing
[53:21] that we can do is accept it by faith
[53:23] that God is sovereign and he will do
[53:25] things the way he does things. And
[53:27] there's nothing that we can do about
[53:29] that. But I think we do have the ability
[53:32] to comprehend and and the ability to
[53:35] understand some things about God, about
[53:38] his nature and and the way he is and how
[53:40] he is immutable in his nature and his
[53:44] ways. Meaning that he will never change.
[53:46] We change, human beings change, um
[53:50] countries change. There's a lot of
[53:52] different things in this world that
[53:54] change, but God never changes. It's such
[53:57] a wonderful thing that we can have that
[53:58] anchor point for our
[54:01] salvation. But I just thought this would
[54:03] be a really good scripture to start with
[54:05] as we dive into this. Wherefore the
[54:07] rather brethren, giving diligence to
[54:09] make your calling and election sure. For
[54:11] if you do these things, ye shall never
[54:14] fall. If we're willing to just give
[54:16] diligence and make our calling and
[54:18] election sure, make sure every single
[54:20] time we think about the Lord just to
[54:22] check up with him. And every single time
[54:25] we aren't thinking about the Lord, we
[54:27] ought to be thinking about the Lord
[54:28] because every time we do a business
[54:30] transaction, every time we we go to
[54:33] school, every time we go to work, every
[54:35] time we come to service, every time we
[54:37] get up, every time we go to bed, every
[54:40] time we have a thought firing in our
[54:42] mind, we ought to be thinking about the
[54:45] Lord. Amen. And and and don't get me
[54:47] wrong because I'm not saying that we
[54:50] should be so spiritually minded that
[54:52] we're no earthly good because some
[54:53] people try to run that that route and
[54:56] and that's an awfully tough row to hoe,
[54:59] so to speak. We can get that way where
[55:02] we make everything spiritual. And you
[55:04] know, I'm not saying that. What I am
[55:06] saying is the word of God says to pray
[55:07] without ceasing. That's the word of God.
[55:10] So, we ought to have a God consciousness
[55:14] is is what I was taught that that just
[55:16] goes with us wherever we're at. Whatever
[55:18] we're doing, whenever we're doing it,
[55:20] there's a God consciousness with us.
[55:23] We're always thinking about him. He's
[55:25] always present. Where this question
[55:27] arose is out of the exposition of the
[55:29] seven church ages in the Sardisian
[55:31] church age. And uh brother Brandham, he
[55:34] says, "Now, let us go another step." and
[55:37] and he really talks about it before
[55:39] this. I didn't want to do that tonight
[55:41] just for the sake of time. I wanted to
[55:44] bring a few other quotes and just preach
[55:46] a little and try and transition maybe a
[55:48] little bit out of the exposition of the
[55:50] seven church ages and get back to
[55:51] preaching again. But I just think it's
[55:53] there's so much in here. I don't know if
[55:55] we could ever get away from this book.
[55:57] But the question is about election. How
[56:00] do we understand election? How how does
[56:02] that apply to us? So brother Brownie
[56:04] says, "Now let us go another step. But
[56:06] before we do, let us review our case
[56:09] thus
[56:10] far. First of all, we know most
[56:13] assuredly that the purpose of God stands
[56:16] in
[56:18] election. Now, in this quote, he talks
[56:20] about four different classes of people,
[56:23] four different types of human beings
[56:25] that have been on the earth since the
[56:27] very beginning in the Garden of Eden
[56:29] right up to the very end at the white
[56:31] throne judgment.
[56:33] It was purposed in himself. It was God's
[56:36] purpose to bring forth a people like
[56:40] unto
[56:41] himself that would be a word bride.
[56:44] Amen. Remember he talks about in the
[56:46] church age book that she is a virgin to
[56:48] his word. And that means that she will
[56:50] accept nothing else. No man-made creeds,
[56:52] no traditions, no teachings of men, no
[56:57] nothing except for the word.
[57:00] She was
[57:01] fornown sorry she was chosen before him
[57:05] be she was chosen before the foundation
[57:08] of the world in him she was
[57:12] fornown and beloved before she was ever
[57:15] brought forth during the ages upon the
[57:18] earth
[57:21] she was redeemed by his
[57:23] blood and can never come into
[57:27] condemnation
[57:30] I think that we could just stop there
[57:32] and probably shout a while if we find
[57:35] ourselves in that category.
[57:38] She can never come into condemnation.
[57:42] Hallelujah. But yet, how many of us here
[57:45] in this building tonight would say, "I
[57:49] have condemnation in my life. I have had
[57:52] condemnation in my life and I probably
[57:55] know myself that I will have
[57:57] condemnation in my life. He the prophet
[58:00] of God just God through the prophet said
[58:02] that she will never have condemnation.
[58:05] How does that work? It's a paradox.
[58:07] Brother Brham preached in 1965. It's a
[58:10] paradox. How could it be so so true yet
[58:13] so difficult to actually understand? We
[58:16] understand it by faith. We believe it by
[58:19] faith. It's Hebrews chapter 11, the
[58:22] faith chapter. But this whole thing, she
[58:25] can never come into condemnation. I
[58:28] think that's so beautiful. That was
[58:29] really my heart's desire tonight as we
[58:32] preach this, as we talk about this is to
[58:34] really kind of grasp this, that she, the
[58:37] bride, will never come into
[58:39] condemnation. We're going to make
[58:41] problems in our lives here on earth.
[58:43] We're going to to upset in this life.
[58:46] We're going to have situations and
[58:48] circumstances continually. That's where
[58:49] the devil's going to try and get us on
[58:51] every single chance that he gets. But
[58:54] the way God sees us is the way he made
[58:57] us. Amen. And that way is perfect
[59:01] because she is a part of him and he is
[59:04] perfect. It's just so beautiful here.
[59:07] She was fornown and beloved before she
[59:09] was ever brought forth during the ages
[59:12] upon the earth. She was redeemed by his
[59:14] blood and can never come into
[59:18] condemnation. She can never be in the
[59:20] judgment because sin cannot be imputed
[59:24] unto her. How can that possibly be? Sin
[59:28] cannot be imputed unto her. Oh my, I
[59:32] love that.
[59:36] Romans 4:8, "Blessed is the man whom the
[59:40] Lord will not impute
[59:44] sin, but indeed she shall be with him in
[59:48] his throne of judgment, judging the
[59:50] world, even
[59:53] angels." Her name, each of her members,
[59:57] was written in a section of the Lamb's
[59:59] book of life before the foundation of
[1:00:01] the world.
[1:00:03] Now, I believe tonight and every time we
[1:00:07] gather, that's who we're preaching to.
[1:00:09] Amen. That class of people. Amen. But we
[1:00:12] know the prophet of God said there's
[1:00:13] always three in every church. It's not
[1:00:17] up to us to decide who is who. It's up
[1:00:19] to God to decide that. It's up to us to
[1:00:22] treat everyone as though they fit that
[1:00:25] category, that one that we just read.
[1:00:27] Every one of them, the elect of God. And
[1:00:30] it's up to God to sort them out. It's
[1:00:31] not up to us.
[1:00:33] Secondly, there is another class. Their
[1:00:36] names are also in the book of life and
[1:00:39] they will come up in the second
[1:00:43] resurrection. Such are the foolish
[1:00:45] virgins and the righteous as are spoken
[1:00:48] of in Matthew 25. In this class also are
[1:00:52] those who do not worship the beast or
[1:00:55] become involved in the antichrist system
[1:00:57] but die for their faith even though they
[1:01:00] are not in the
[1:01:02] bride not having been born
[1:01:05] again but they will come up in the
[1:01:07] second resurrection and go into eternal
[1:01:10] life. How could they not be born again
[1:01:13] and still come up and have eternal
[1:01:16] life? I think it's a beautiful thought.
[1:01:19] Because we know for sure the people that
[1:01:22] reject the message of the hour that
[1:01:23] don't actually get the true baptism of
[1:01:26] the Holy Ghost, that's the class, the
[1:01:28] category they'll find themselves in.
[1:01:30] They haven't really been born again. We
[1:01:32] haven't been converted until we actually
[1:01:33] get the Holy Ghost in our life. We know
[1:01:36] that's what brother Brandham
[1:01:38] said. Though they are not in the bride,
[1:01:41] not having been born again, but they
[1:01:43] will come up in the second resurrection
[1:01:44] and go on to eternal life. Amen.
[1:01:47] Thirdly, there are the borderline
[1:01:50] Christians such as we saw in Israel
[1:01:52] coming out of Egypt. These had their
[1:01:55] names in the book of life and their
[1:01:59] works written in the books. These having
[1:02:02] failed to obey God and being void of the
[1:02:06] spirit, though even the signs and
[1:02:09] wonders were amongst
[1:02:11] them, will have their names removed from
[1:02:15] the book of life.
[1:02:17] I think this is so amazing if we could
[1:02:19] just read these, study these. I I
[1:02:23] believe this anyways and and and absorb
[1:02:26] what is being said because so much is
[1:02:28] being said in in these paragraphs. It's
[1:02:31] it's almost impossible to really absorb
[1:02:34] what the prophet is saying, the gravity
[1:02:36] of what he's saying here. But I I I just
[1:02:38] want to say this. I think myself what I
[1:02:41] experience is the devil tries to bring
[1:02:44] things around to make it seem like I am
[1:02:46] going to fit in one of those last two
[1:02:49] categories that we read. Somehow
[1:02:51] somewhere along the way I'm going to
[1:02:52] have to stand and give an account for my
[1:02:54] actions here on earth. A and you know if
[1:02:57] we judge ourselves here now we're not
[1:02:59] going to be judged. Then we're going to
[1:03:02] be seated with him in his throne. And
[1:03:04] that is our ability to not come into
[1:03:07] condemnation is to judge ourselves here
[1:03:09] according to God's word. To say unto
[1:03:11] ourselves, "Be it unto me according to
[1:03:13] thy word." If you don't want me to wear
[1:03:15] pants, I won't wear pants. If you don't
[1:03:16] want me to wear shorts, I won't wear
[1:03:17] shorts. If you don't want me to cut my
[1:03:19] hair, I won't cut my hair. You don't
[1:03:20] want me to listen to that music, you
[1:03:21] don't want me to watch that movie, you
[1:03:22] don't want me to go to that place, don't
[1:03:24] want me to hang out those people,
[1:03:25] whatever you want, Lord, is what I want.
[1:03:28] Because what you want is going to make
[1:03:30] me happy.
[1:03:33] These having to having failed to obey
[1:03:36] God and being void of the spirit though
[1:03:39] even the signs and wonders were amongst
[1:03:41] them. Remember away with experience as
[1:03:46] the plum line. That's what the prophet
[1:03:48] said. That is not our measuring stick.
[1:03:50] Satan can impersonate any gift. Though
[1:03:54] even signs and wonders were amongst them
[1:03:57] will have their names removed from the
[1:03:59] book of life.
[1:04:01] My I personally think brothers and
[1:04:03] sisters we might have the ability to
[1:04:07] help influence some people to see
[1:04:10] eternal life. Amen. By giving them
[1:04:12] opportunity to do good to the bride of
[1:04:15] Jesus
[1:04:17] Christ to save them from the lake of
[1:04:20] fire. Brother Brandham said he wanted to
[1:04:22] take as many people with him as he
[1:04:24] could. Amen. And I know that if we ever
[1:04:26] lose the burden for souls, then we have
[1:04:28] got a problem with our experience.
[1:04:33] But they'll have their names removed
[1:04:34] from the book of life. Amongst this
[1:04:36] group will be the ones like Judas who
[1:04:39] though entirely void of the spirit but
[1:04:42] are
[1:04:44] religious will have manifestation in
[1:04:47] their
[1:04:48] lives. And though on the
[1:04:51] books were not the elected in
[1:04:55] him, such also as Balum will be in that
[1:04:58] group. Fourth and finally are the ones
[1:05:02] whose names have never been or will ever
[1:05:06] be written on the books. Such are found
[1:05:10] in Revelation
[1:05:11] 13:8. Revelation 17:8. and all that
[1:05:15] dwell upon the earth shall worship him
[1:05:17] whose names are not written in the book
[1:05:19] of life of the lamb slain from the
[1:05:22] foundation of the world. The beast that
[1:05:25] thou sawest was and is not and shall
[1:05:28] ascend out of the bottomless pit and go
[1:05:31] into predition. And they that dwell on
[1:05:33] the earth shall wander whose names were
[1:05:36] not written in the book of life from the
[1:05:38] foundation of the world. when they
[1:05:41] behold the beast that was and is not and
[1:05:45] yet
[1:05:46] is. Jesus said that a certain
[1:05:50] group would accept one who came in his
[1:05:54] own name. That one is the antichrist.
[1:05:58] And that is exactly what it says of them
[1:06:00] in Revelations 13:8 and 178.
[1:06:04] These were ordained of God, but not unto
[1:06:09] election.
[1:06:12] And with this group is such that are as
[1:06:17] Pharaoh. It says of him, even for this
[1:06:20] same purpose have I raised thee up
[1:06:23] vessels of wrath fitted to
[1:06:28] destruction. Romans 9:17 and 22.
[1:06:32] None of these would be placed on the
[1:06:34] records of
[1:06:36] life. I'm not saying that there is no
[1:06:39] record of them. No doubt there is some
[1:06:42] kind of a record of them, but not in the
[1:06:44] records of
[1:06:45] life. Their purpose of existence has
[1:06:49] been dealt with slightly in the rest of
[1:06:52] this book. But we can add two more
[1:06:54] scriptures. Proverbs 16:4, "The Lord
[1:06:58] hath made the wicked for the day of
[1:07:00] evil.
[1:07:02] Job
[1:07:04] 21:30, "The wicked is reserved to the
[1:07:09] day of
[1:07:10] destruction, or they shall be brought
[1:07:12] forth to the day of
[1:07:16] wrath."
[1:07:17] Boy, I think before we go on, I just
[1:07:20] want to
[1:07:21] say the bride of Jesus Christ does not
[1:07:24] fit any one of those other three
[1:07:25] categories
[1:07:27] at all.
[1:07:29] If the devil comes around and says that
[1:07:31] we're going to have to go and be judged,
[1:07:32] if you ever get those thoughts in our
[1:07:34] mind, you know it's the devil because
[1:07:35] God said through his prophet that she
[1:07:37] won't be judged. Amen. She will not come
[1:07:40] into condemnation.
[1:07:42] So, I don't know about everyone here,
[1:07:45] but I know myself, I have had those
[1:07:47] thoughts that somehow someway I'm going
[1:07:50] to have to give an account. I'm going to
[1:07:51] have to be judged. I'm going to have all
[1:07:52] this problem down the road because of
[1:07:54] the life that I I've experienced, the
[1:07:56] life that I live, the times that I fail,
[1:07:58] the times that I fall. And you know, it
[1:08:01] doesn't matter because my heart's desire
[1:08:03] is to get on my face before the Lord and
[1:08:06] say, "Lord, forgive me. I don't want to
[1:08:08] be in this flesh. I don't want to be in
[1:08:10] this past house. If I had my way, I
[1:08:12] would be in my theophony body right now.
[1:08:16] But I find myself here. And the only
[1:08:18] desire that I really have is to serve
[1:08:20] the Lord with all my heart and all my
[1:08:24] mind and all my soul. But every single
[1:08:26] thing in this world that's created in
[1:08:28] this world in Satan's Eden is against
[1:08:32] that.
[1:08:34] So when the devil comes around and lies
[1:08:36] to us, just remind him he's a liar.
[1:08:39] Amen. If we hear anything in our minds
[1:08:42] that's contrary to that word that says
[1:08:44] she will not come into the condemnation,
[1:08:46] just remember that's the devil speaking.
[1:08:49] Anyone that says that is off base.
[1:08:51] They've actually missed the mark for our
[1:08:53] day. The mark for our day says that she
[1:08:55] will not come into condemnation. We're
[1:08:57] not going to be judged because we're
[1:08:59] judging ourselves now. Now, I I know
[1:09:02] there's going to be some people that
[1:09:03] aren't willing to judge themselves now.
[1:09:04] They're just willing to judge other
[1:09:05] people and that's just God's work. It's
[1:09:07] not ours. But the true believers are
[1:09:09] going to be the ones that are judging
[1:09:11] themselves in the word of God. They're
[1:09:12] going to be saying, "Be it unto me
[1:09:14] according to thy word." And that's that.
[1:09:18] He says this, "Since this portion of the
[1:09:20] word is hard for the human mind to
[1:09:23] grasp, it must be accepted and believed
[1:09:26] by faith."
[1:09:29] Just like being saved, we have to accept
[1:09:32] that and believe by faith that we're not
[1:09:34] going to go into the condemnation. We're
[1:09:36] not going to be judged. God has called
[1:09:38] us. He's given us the ability to receive
[1:09:41] salvation for our souls. But it's a dual
[1:09:44] covenant, isn't it? Amen. Because he
[1:09:46] also took stripes before he was
[1:09:48] crucified for our sin. And those stripes
[1:09:51] were for our healing in our bodies. And
[1:09:54] I know that every single one of us would
[1:09:56] be able to raise their hand and say,
[1:09:57] "Yes, I know he's healed me in my life.
[1:10:00] Somewhere along the way, I've had an
[1:10:02] illness and he's healed me." Every
[1:10:04] single one of us has that ability to do
[1:10:06] that because he is our healer. He's
[1:10:08] given us the ability to have healing in
[1:10:10] our lives. But we don't want to major on
[1:10:13] that. We want to major on salvation as
[1:10:15] we talked about on Sunday because many
[1:10:17] people from the other categories can be
[1:10:19] healed and then still be in those other
[1:10:21] categories. We don't want to worry about
[1:10:23] healing. Healing will follow. All we
[1:10:25] want to do is put the word first.
[1:10:30] If we can put him first, everything else
[1:10:32] will follow.
[1:10:33] But you know, this portion of the word
[1:10:35] is really hard for the human mind to
[1:10:37] grasp. How can that be? That some people
[1:10:39] are just made for
[1:10:41] destruction. Boy, and I know we've all
[1:10:45] heard it said somewhere along the way
[1:10:46] that, you know, those people over there,
[1:10:48] they're this or, you know, that group is
[1:10:50] a little bit of that. You know, we don't
[1:10:52] want to get caught up in that. We're
[1:10:53] putting people in categories. People are
[1:10:55] not cannon fodder for us to say. It's
[1:10:58] not up to us to say people are serpent
[1:11:00] seed. That's up to God. Amen. We know
[1:11:04] what serpent seed is. We know exactly
[1:11:06] what that doctrine is. But we're not
[1:11:08] we're not to go around and start
[1:11:10] classifying people in these categories.
[1:11:13] We want to try and encourage people.
[1:11:15] Give them the opportunity. Give them
[1:11:17] some encouragement. The people that
[1:11:19] don't have a chance that will never see
[1:11:21] Jesus Christ except for the interaction
[1:11:23] that we have with them on earth. Amen.
[1:11:26] We know, we've heard it so many times
[1:11:28] that we could be the only Jesus that a
[1:11:31] human being ever sees on earth, the life
[1:11:34] that we live before the people, the
[1:11:36] interactions that we present. And how
[1:11:39] easy is it to get a hot head? How easy
[1:11:41] is it to get offended? How easy is it to
[1:11:44] just have the humanity, the things that
[1:11:47] we contend with in our lives get in the
[1:11:49] way and cause problems?
[1:11:52] But you know this portion of the word is
[1:11:54] hard for the human mind to grasp just
[1:11:56] like it is for salvation just like it is
[1:11:58] for healing. But we just believe it. We
[1:12:00] accept it by faith. God said it. I
[1:12:03] believe it. That settles it. He says
[1:12:05] some will be offended but what I have by
[1:12:08] what I have set forth because they fail
[1:12:10] to understand the sovereignty of
[1:12:14] God. And that really is what it comes
[1:12:16] down to. I think I've told the story.
[1:12:18] Once upon a time after I was saved uh a
[1:12:21] little while, I went to a friend's
[1:12:22] funeral, a worldly friend in England,
[1:12:24] and while we were over there, they
[1:12:26] wanted to go and have a a stag party.
[1:12:29] And I I I don't know. I guess I didn't
[1:12:31] really think that one through. I really
[1:12:33] didn't think that one through. And And
[1:12:35] I'm only going to be honest with you. We
[1:12:37] we we were in a foreign land at a
[1:12:41] foreign house and the group of boys or
[1:12:44] English boys and they wanted to take and
[1:12:47] take the friend out. The two guys came
[1:12:49] from Canada, the English friend of mine
[1:12:51] and and myself and he wanted me to be
[1:12:53] the best man for his wedding. So here I
[1:12:55] find myself in the situation to support
[1:12:56] him and try and encourage him. And we
[1:12:59] get over there and uh they're going to
[1:13:01] go out and and have an evening out. And
[1:13:04] as a believer, I just wasn't even
[1:13:05] thinking clearly. I guess maybe I'm
[1:13:07] going to blame it on jet lag, but uh we
[1:13:10] wound up going out on the town along
[1:13:12] like an hour journey away from where we
[1:13:14] were in London. Now, they're going to
[1:13:17] have a stag party and and so it was
[1:13:19] interesting. It was an all day thing. It
[1:13:21] started at a at a game of cricket. And I
[1:13:24] apologize for the story, but it's just a
[1:13:25] life experience that I think is
[1:13:27] important for what we're talking about
[1:13:28] here. It started with a game of cricket
[1:13:31] in in the early late morning and then it
[1:13:33] went all through the afternoon and then
[1:13:35] it went to the evening we went to a
[1:13:36] restaurant and went to another
[1:13:38] restaurant and before long we find
[1:13:40] ourselves at the pub and they're talking
[1:13:42] about going to another type of pub and I
[1:13:45] that's where I said you know what I'm
[1:13:47] not doing this I'm not doing this I
[1:13:49] don't care where we are or who we're
[1:13:50] with this is where I draw the line in
[1:13:53] the sand I'm not doing that I will not I
[1:13:55] refuse I'll I'll just walk somewhere I
[1:13:58] don't know, go get a hotel. I don't know
[1:14:00] what I'll do, but I'm not doing that.
[1:14:02] And uh so then they said I was a, you
[1:14:04] know, a party pooper and I was really
[1:14:07] raining on the parade and the
[1:14:09] experience. It was kind of funny, but we
[1:14:11] found ourselves at this other place and
[1:14:13] uh it was a pub and it was really
[1:14:15] low-key and they were doing their thing
[1:14:17] and I was just kind of there lamenting
[1:14:19] that I was there and really wanting to
[1:14:21] go. But this one guy that was part of
[1:14:23] the group, you could see the way it
[1:14:25] goes. He was drinking. They were
[1:14:27] drinking and he got drunk. And as he
[1:14:29] did, he finally came and said what was
[1:14:32] on his mind, what was on his heart to
[1:14:33] me. And I know it wasn't even him that
[1:14:35] was talking, but he wanted to challenge
[1:14:37] me on on scripture. He wanted to
[1:14:39] challenge me on a couple of scriptures
[1:14:40] that he knew of and and God and all this
[1:14:43] stuff. And we we had to have the
[1:14:45] conversation straight out at the end to
[1:14:47] say, "Hey, you know, do you believe that
[1:14:49] there is a God? Do you believe that
[1:14:51] there is a sovereign creator of the
[1:14:53] universe and that the Bible is the
[1:14:55] infallible word of God? And he said,
[1:14:57] "No, no way. Why would I believe that?"
[1:14:58] And I had to say to him, "Then we have
[1:15:00] absolutely nothing more to say." You
[1:15:05] might as well just have another beer, my
[1:15:06] friend. I can't help you. If you're not
[1:15:10] willing to acknowledge God as God, then
[1:15:12] I can't help you. But I'll tell you
[1:15:14] what, I do see him as a sovereign
[1:15:17] creator of the universe. and I see his
[1:15:20] word as my absolute and I won't deviate
[1:15:23] it one iota. It doesn't matter who's
[1:15:25] drinking or who's doing what. That's why
[1:15:28] maybe call me that kind of a guy, but
[1:15:30] that's why I would say I am a Christian
[1:15:32] because I put his word first and I won't
[1:15:34] deviate for one second about that. But
[1:15:37] it just really kind of struck home for
[1:15:39] me to see that this individual had
[1:15:42] absolutely zero desire to even talk
[1:15:45] about God being the absolute about the
[1:15:48] Bible. But yet he wanted to challenge me
[1:15:50] on the scripture. I thought it was
[1:15:52] intriguing. But you know I I just had to
[1:15:55] say you know what you don't see it that
[1:15:56] way then we have nothing more to talk
[1:15:58] about. Brother Branomy says here, I set
[1:16:00] forth because they fail to understand
[1:16:03] the sovereignty of God, which sets forth
[1:16:06] that God is God. And because he is God,
[1:16:11] one cannot defeat his councils or thwart
[1:16:14] his will and purpose. But he being
[1:16:19] omnipotent is ruling in all affairs and
[1:16:24] is doing whatever he will with all his
[1:16:27] creation
[1:16:30] because all were created for his good
[1:16:33] pleasure. And we know as the elect bride
[1:16:36] of Jesus Christ, that's scripture that
[1:16:38] he's saying that that all of it was
[1:16:41] created for his good pleasure. We even
[1:16:44] sing that song, Majesty. That's why
[1:16:46] we're created. is for his good pleasure.
[1:16:49] But you know, it's it's it's amazing to
[1:16:52] look at this and and see that God will
[1:16:56] always have his will come to pass. And
[1:16:58] it just brings to mind the scripture,
[1:17:00] the prophet Micaiah, you know, where uh
[1:17:04] Elijah the prophet was there and Ahab,
[1:17:07] the whole story. We know uh we know what
[1:17:10] was going on there. And uh Jehoshaphat
[1:17:14] and and Jehoshaphat says, you know,
[1:17:16] isn't there one more? We got 400 God
[1:17:19] prophets. Brother Brandham called them.
[1:17:20] And we know that it gets into Micaiah
[1:17:23] coming and saying, you know what, even
[1:17:24] if you go up and do it, you're you're
[1:17:26] this is your land. You should be able to
[1:17:27] go and and take back all of the land the
[1:17:30] Assyrians have taken. No problem. And
[1:17:32] all the prophets were prophesying, go
[1:17:34] on, take up the land. Just help
[1:17:36] yourselves to it. But we know the one
[1:17:38] God prophet came and stood against all
[1:17:40] of And he said, "I will only say what
[1:17:41] God puts in my mouth." And what he had
[1:17:44] to say, it must have taken a lot of
[1:17:46] courage. But it was God's courage in
[1:17:48] him. And what did he say? He said he saw
[1:17:50] a vision of a throne in heaven and God
[1:17:53] sitting on his throne, the sovereign
[1:17:55] creator. And and what did he say? Who's
[1:17:58] going to get my will to come to pass in
[1:18:00] Ahab's life? And we know that there was
[1:18:03] a few different voices that came up in
[1:18:05] the story, but there was one that came
[1:18:08] out of hell. and threw himself down at
[1:18:12] God's feet. It's hard to even comprehend
[1:18:14] this story. And he said, "I'll go. I'll
[1:18:16] do it." And he said, "Wherewith will you
[1:18:18] get my will to come to pass?" And he
[1:18:20] said, "I'll go and I'll be a lying
[1:18:22] spirit in his
[1:18:25] prophets." Can you imagine that?
[1:18:28] But he made it happen, didn't he? Yes.
[1:18:31] God doesn't actually push us down the
[1:18:33] pipe. Brother Brandham said that many
[1:18:35] times. We're waiting for God to push us
[1:18:36] down the pipe. We're just waiting on the
[1:18:38] Lord. Sometimes we can wait too long. If
[1:18:40] we're not marching, God can't really
[1:18:41] bless us. It's a fine balance. But if we
[1:18:44] give him the opportunity, he will bless
[1:18:46] us.
[1:18:49] But he has a will and it will come to
[1:18:51] pass in every one of our lives. His will
[1:18:54] and his purpose. But he being omnipotent
[1:18:56] is ruling in all affairs. There's no
[1:18:59] accidents. There's no things that happen
[1:19:01] just by accident and and and we're like,
[1:19:03] "Wow, we're so surprised by it." We know
[1:19:06] that we are as human beings many times
[1:19:08] surprised by things. But God's not
[1:19:10] surprised ever. God knows that every
[1:19:13] single thing is going on. He's governing
[1:19:15] all of it. All of the affairs. It it's
[1:19:18] very difficult for us to even imagine. I
[1:19:20] I had tried to express this before when
[1:19:22] we were preaching about the prophet
[1:19:23] Micaiah so many times. But if you think
[1:19:26] about how many times we think in our
[1:19:29] mind and how many thoughts we have and
[1:19:32] how many people there are thinking
[1:19:33] thoughts, how many neurons are firing
[1:19:36] here on earth, how many affairs is God
[1:19:39] governing in all at one time? Over 8
[1:19:43] billion minds and hearts of people right
[1:19:48] now at this very instant. He's
[1:19:51] constantly present in everyone's
[1:19:53] thoughts. It's just amazing to me. It
[1:19:55] it's it's mindblowing to think about
[1:19:57] that, but he is and and he's making sure
[1:20:00] that his will is coming to pass and
[1:20:02] Satan can't get in the way of that. And
[1:20:04] especially for his bride, Satan cannot
[1:20:07] get in his in her way. It's so
[1:20:10] beautiful. He's governing in all the
[1:20:11] affairs and doing whatever he will with
[1:20:13] all his creation because all were
[1:20:14] created for his good pleasure.
[1:20:16] Therefore, as Paul says, if God should
[1:20:19] take one lump of clay and make of that
[1:20:22] same lump one vessel unto honor and
[1:20:26] another vessel unto dishonor, who can be
[1:20:29] offended and cry against him? That he
[1:20:32] has the right to do this on the grounds
[1:20:35] of creation alone we cannot
[1:20:38] deny. Yet went even further. For
[1:20:42] according to Romans
[1:20:44] 14:7-9, we have the irrefutable proof
[1:20:48] that Jesus paid the purchase price of
[1:20:50] the whole
[1:20:51] world. And therefore, he can do as he
[1:20:54] wills with his
[1:20:56] own. And I know I I'm not sure. I don't
[1:20:59] think it's that scripture. I think I I
[1:21:01] don't know. I'm going to get confused.
[1:21:03] It happens easy with me. But he he even
[1:21:07] talks about us being his inheritance.
[1:21:11] We are his inheritance. Jesus Christ's
[1:21:14] inheritance. And and it is the will of
[1:21:17] the father that that is the case. And he
[1:21:21] he I think it's so beautiful. Therefore,
[1:21:25] he can do as he wills with his own. For
[1:21:28] none of us liveth to himself, and no man
[1:21:31] dieth to himself. For whether we live,
[1:21:34] we live unto the Lord. And whether we
[1:21:36] die, we die unto the Lord. Whether we
[1:21:39] live thereof or die, we are the Lord's.
[1:21:42] Amen. And you know, I think, brothers
[1:21:44] and sisters, this is just my thought. I
[1:21:46] think this is where Satan becomes
[1:21:48] powerless before us. Amen.
[1:21:52] When we can say that scripture and not
[1:21:56] say it as a memorized Sunday school
[1:21:58] lesson that we've learned and it's just
[1:22:00] something that we can quote by heart,
[1:22:02] but we say it because we believe it with
[1:22:03] all of our heart, with all that we are,
[1:22:06] all of our fiber. What it does is it
[1:22:08] shows that we're not afraid. When Satan
[1:22:10] comes around as a roaring lion, we can
[1:22:12] show him, hey, you know what? You're a
[1:22:14] bluff. I'm not afraid. If I live, I live
[1:22:18] for Christ. If I die, I die in Christ. I
[1:22:22] gain. I don't lose. I go on to the Lord.
[1:22:26] What a tremendous thing that is. And you
[1:22:28] know that's the same way it is with
[1:22:29] bullies here on earth. Many times people
[1:22:32] will come around and try and intimidate,
[1:22:33] try and scare, try and push, try and
[1:22:35] poke, try and push and shove and see if
[1:22:39] you're afraid. And if you can just stand
[1:22:41] your ground and say, "Listen, man. I'm
[1:22:42] not afraid. It's God's will that's going
[1:22:45] to come to pass. That's what's going to
[1:22:46] happen. And nobody's gonna stop that.
[1:22:50] It just goes away when you do that. It's
[1:22:52] interesting. But whether we live,
[1:22:55] therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
[1:22:57] For to this end, Christ both died and
[1:23:00] rose and revived that he might be Lord
[1:23:03] both of the dead and the
[1:23:06] living. This is where it's beautiful.
[1:23:09] Ownership, not relationship, is meant
[1:23:12] here. He owns us. He bought us with a
[1:23:15] price. How many of us are willing to
[1:23:18] just say, you know, when I go and buy
[1:23:19] something really, really valuable and
[1:23:21] special, the most important purchase in
[1:23:23] my life, it's okay. I don't need to get
[1:23:25] all of it. I'll just let some of it, you
[1:23:27] know, slide. You can just keep some of
[1:23:29] it. We're going to fight for every
[1:23:31] single speck of what we purchased,
[1:23:34] aren't we? We're not going home until
[1:23:37] we've got it all. And I think that's
[1:23:39] beautiful. He's talking about ownership
[1:23:41] here, not relationship is meant here.
[1:23:44] This is also set forth in John 17:2. As
[1:23:48] thou hast given him power over all
[1:23:51] flesh, that he should give eternal life
[1:23:54] to as many as thou hast given
[1:23:58] him. Now, if we impute omniscience to
[1:24:01] God, we must also
[1:24:04] accept that he is perfect in wisdom and
[1:24:07] righteousness.
[1:24:09] This plan of election and
[1:24:12] reprobation is the wisdom of God
[1:24:14] revealed in all ages.
[1:24:18] Even as it says in Ephesians 1
[1:24:22] 3-11, blessed be the God and Father of
[1:24:25] our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed
[1:24:28] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:24:31] heavenly places in Christ, according as
[1:24:34] he hath chosen us in him before the
[1:24:38] foundation of the world. He didn't just
[1:24:41] choose us in him when we stumbled into
[1:24:44] the message church that we heard about
[1:24:46] for the first time. He didn't just
[1:24:49] choose us in him when we were just born
[1:24:52] into the family that we were born into.
[1:24:54] He didn't just choose us in him
[1:24:57] somewhere along the way by accident. It
[1:24:59] was before the foundation of the world.
[1:25:02] I can't even remember the quote. I was
[1:25:04] reading it this week. Before there was
[1:25:06] even a speck of stardust. before this
[1:25:09] universe was formed. We were in him
[1:25:12] then.
[1:25:16] My it might be in
[1:25:19] uh oh my no I'm not going to go there.
[1:25:22] I'll leave it
[1:25:23] alone. Blessed be the God and father of
[1:25:26] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[1:25:28] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:25:30] heavenly places in Christ. How many
[1:25:32] people feel like they're sitting in
[1:25:33] heavenly places
[1:25:36] according as he hath chosen us in him
[1:25:39] before the foundation of the world that
[1:25:42] we should be holy and without blame
[1:25:45] before him in love. Amen. Having
[1:25:49] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:25:53] children by Jesus Christ to himself.
[1:25:56] Amen. It's difficult to even understand.
[1:25:59] This is why we need to have the spirit,
[1:26:01] the Holy Ghost in our lives to be able
[1:26:03] to read something like this and have the
[1:26:04] spirit quickened to say, "Hey, that's
[1:26:07] me. That's me." Predestinated us unto
[1:26:11] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:26:14] to himself according to the good
[1:26:17] pleasure of his will. Not our will, not
[1:26:19] the pastor's will, not the evangelist's
[1:26:21] will, not parents will, his will, to the
[1:26:24] praise of the glory of his grace,
[1:26:27] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:26:31] beloved. Such a beautiful thing. in whom
[1:26:35] we have redemption through his blood,
[1:26:36] the forgiveness of
[1:26:38] sins, according to the riches of his
[1:26:42] grace, wherein he hath abounded toward
[1:26:45] us all
[1:26:47] wisdom and
[1:26:49] prudence, having made known unto us the
[1:26:53] mystery of his will. What is his
[1:26:56] will? His word. It's such a simple
[1:26:59] thing, but so complicated all at the
[1:27:02] same time. It's one of those deep
[1:27:05] things. The mystery of his will
[1:27:08] according to his good pleasure. Not
[1:27:10] everyone gets the spirit in their life
[1:27:12] to quicken the
[1:27:14] word. Sometimes people they just get
[1:27:16] wisdom. They get head knowledge and it
[1:27:19] stays up here. And we've heard it said
[1:27:21] many times that's the longest journey a
[1:27:22] human will ever make is for that word to
[1:27:25] go from their head down into their
[1:27:26] heart. I say Lord don't let that be our
[1:27:30] our experience.
[1:27:32] My let us understand the mystery of his
[1:27:34] will according to his good pleasure
[1:27:35] which he hath purposed in himself that
[1:27:37] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:27:39] times he might gather together in one
[1:27:42] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:27:45] heaven which are on earth even in him in
[1:27:48] whom also we have obtained an
[1:27:50] inheritance being predestinated
[1:27:52] according to the purpose of him who
[1:27:54] workketh all things after the counsel of
[1:27:57] his own
[1:27:58] will. Thus, if God has so designed that
[1:28:03] there be those whose names are placed in
[1:28:07] a section of the Lamb's book of life and
[1:28:10] cannot be
[1:28:11] erased, for they are the names of his
[1:28:15] bride, then we must accept that. How
[1:28:18] many accept that tonight?
[1:28:20] I say, my I don't feel like it. I can't
[1:28:22] explain it. I don't even understand it.
[1:28:24] But I accept it. I'll just accept it
[1:28:27] because that's what he said.
[1:28:31] Boy, what a tremendous thing that is. If
[1:28:34] it also states that there are those
[1:28:36] whose names were placed in the record of
[1:28:39] the book of life, but in the fornowledge
[1:28:42] of God, they were to fall and have their
[1:28:47] names removed, we must accept
[1:28:52] that. And if there are those whose names
[1:28:56] were never placed upon a record of
[1:29:00] life, we must accept that also. And if
[1:29:03] there are those who will enter into
[1:29:06] eternal life after the white throne
[1:29:10] judgment
[1:29:11] solely on the grounds of being good and
[1:29:15] kind and just to the elect of God who
[1:29:20] are his
[1:29:21] brethren, then we cannot but accept
[1:29:24] that. Amen.
[1:29:26] And you know, I I think we could preach
[1:29:29] a whole series just on this paragraph,
[1:29:32] this sentence right here to think about
[1:29:34] how many people in this world we have
[1:29:36] the opportunity to affect.
[1:29:39] How many people in this world do we have
[1:29:41] the opportunity to extend a special
[1:29:44] measure of grace? Many times we feel
[1:29:47] like we're just caught up in this life
[1:29:49] in the moment. We get out of my way. I
[1:29:52] got to go to work. I'm late. I uh we got
[1:29:54] problems. We got pressures in our lives.
[1:29:57] But how many times can we just let
[1:29:59] someone in? How many times can we just
[1:30:02] allow someone to do something nice for
[1:30:04] us? We have so many opportunities. I
[1:30:07] believe and and how many people, you
[1:30:10] know, talking about the sovereignty of
[1:30:11] God and and how many people are in this
[1:30:13] world. We we we talked about how many
[1:30:15] people there are and how many thoughts
[1:30:17] are happening simultaneously all around
[1:30:19] the world. God's governing and all the
[1:30:20] affairs. But how many people do we have
[1:30:23] the ability to interact with in our
[1:30:24] lives out of eight bill over 8 billion
[1:30:27] people? The the number of people that we
[1:30:29] would see from the time we actually get
[1:30:32] saved filled with the Holy Ghost in our
[1:30:34] lives and understand some of this stuff
[1:30:36] that we're talking about. How many
[1:30:37] people do we have the ability to maybe
[1:30:40] impart eternal life to by giving them an
[1:30:43] opportunity to do good for us throughout
[1:30:45] the course of our life and the course of
[1:30:47] the history of mankind and the
[1:30:48] population that's on the world. That's a
[1:30:50] very small number.
[1:30:53] I think it's incredible.
[1:30:57] We can never underestimate the
[1:30:59] sovereignty of God. How many people that
[1:31:02] have been good to us to think about
[1:31:05] maybe how they've been skunks to the
[1:31:08] rest of the world. Maybe really hard
[1:31:12] individuals to everyone else in this
[1:31:14] world, but for some reason we have the
[1:31:17] ability to connect with them. And
[1:31:18] sometimes you hear people say, you you
[1:31:20] know that guy, you're able to deal with
[1:31:22] him, man, he's a hard guy. I could never
[1:31:24] communicate with him. I could never work
[1:31:26] with him or be friends with him. And
[1:31:28] somehow someway, it's just doable. What
[1:31:32] is that? I believe that's the spirit of
[1:31:34] God. That's the sovereignty of God
[1:31:37] expressing himself to that human being.
[1:31:40] And you know, honestly, brothers and
[1:31:42] sisters, we don't know what people go
[1:31:43] through. Sometimes people have some
[1:31:46] pretty horrible stories in their lives.
[1:31:49] They've got things that they had to go
[1:31:50] through and they haven't told a soul
[1:31:52] about and they're just packing those
[1:31:54] things around and it causes them to
[1:31:57] behave a certain way. And sometimes that
[1:31:59] way makes them really prickly to all the
[1:32:02] other people around them. And you know,
[1:32:03] we're not exclusive inside the church.
[1:32:05] We're human beings. We all deal with
[1:32:07] these human natures and it happens even
[1:32:10] inside the
[1:32:11] church. But you know, we have the
[1:32:14] ability to just show love. Amen. To
[1:32:17] impart kindness, to show Christ. Even
[1:32:20] when someone would step on us on our
[1:32:23] toes, even when someone might even spit
[1:32:25] on us, we have the ability to
[1:32:28] potentially impart eternal life.
[1:32:32] He says, "For who knoweth the mind of
[1:32:34] the Lord that he should instruct him."
[1:32:36] My, I think that's powerful. Who would
[1:32:40] dare start putting people in or out?
[1:32:43] It's God that judges, not us. We judge
[1:32:46] ourselves. I think that's so good. To
[1:32:48] me, that just takes all the pressure
[1:32:49] off. Doesn't it take the pressure off to
[1:32:52] think that I really only have to worry
[1:32:53] about me? Maybe as the father in the
[1:32:55] home, I've got to worry about my family.
[1:32:58] Then that's a lot of pressure. I'm not
[1:32:59] saying that's not a lot of pressure.
[1:33:00] That's more pressure than maybe a lot of
[1:33:02] the young brothers realize at the time
[1:33:04] of getting married. And I'll say by
[1:33:06] experience, it's way more than I
[1:33:08] realized when I got married. The gravity
[1:33:10] of the situation, the pressure there is
[1:33:12] when you start having children. It's
[1:33:14] great. It feels wonderful. You're going
[1:33:15] to have children. But you're responsible
[1:33:17] for them. All the days of their life up
[1:33:20] until the point of accountability. It's
[1:33:22] all yours, baby. God never came down in
[1:33:25] the Garden of Eden and said, "Eve, where
[1:33:27] are you?" He said,
[1:33:29] "Adam, what's your deal?" But he knew
[1:33:32] where he was. Amen. Who knoweth the mind
[1:33:35] of the Lord that he should instruct him?
[1:33:38] Rather, let us be subject in faith to
[1:33:41] him who is our father and live. So now
[1:33:45] we're we're talking this is all sort of
[1:33:47] just talking about the question of
[1:33:49] election where this question of election
[1:33:51] came from was from this portion of the
[1:33:54] church age book. He goes on to say, "To
[1:33:57] understand the subject even more
[1:33:58] clearly, it will now be wise to approach
[1:34:00] it from the standpoint of the church
[1:34:03] through the ages. Up until now, we have
[1:34:06] been thinking in terms of the removal of
[1:34:08] the names of
[1:34:11] individuals. Now, we want to consider
[1:34:13] not the individuals but the groups
[1:34:16] represented in the church. To do so, we
[1:34:20] will liken the church through the
[1:34:22] ages to the wheat plant.
[1:34:26] I love how he just makes it so simple
[1:34:27] all the way through the church ages. How
[1:34:29] brother Brandham would give an example
[1:34:31] and then he would just go back and point
[1:34:32] out a scripture. This scripture is what
[1:34:34] we're talking about. This is where we're
[1:34:36] getting the inspiration from here. He
[1:34:38] excuse me. Here he's talking about the
[1:34:40] grain of wheat is planted to the end
[1:34:43] that a single grain of wheat will
[1:34:45] reproduce and multiply itself through a
[1:34:48] certain process during a certain period
[1:34:50] of time. That single seed will die. But
[1:34:54] in dying the life that was in it will
[1:34:59] come up into a plant which in turn will
[1:35:02] be the bearer or carrier of that life
[1:35:05] which is to come back to
[1:35:08] originality in a multiplied form. Isn't
[1:35:12] that beautiful? And we know the Bible
[1:35:14] says unless a corner wheat falls in the
[1:35:16] ground and dies, it abides alone. But
[1:35:20] boy, when it does that, there is a
[1:35:21] harvest that comes
[1:35:23] up. Jesus, the great royal seed, died.
[1:35:28] That matchless one who is the life of
[1:35:30] the church, stands in the midst of the
[1:35:33] church for all seven ages, giving his
[1:35:36] life to the church, the carrier or
[1:35:38] bearer to the end that his very life
[1:35:42] will be reproduced in
[1:35:44] bodies unto his in the resurrection.
[1:35:49] I think that's beautiful. Many times we
[1:35:51] could just read over that and and it
[1:35:53] just kind of glazes over because we've
[1:35:55] had so many words that I've read tonight
[1:35:57] and and many times as we study the
[1:36:00] exposition of the seven church ages. His
[1:36:02] very life will be
[1:36:05] reproduced in bodies like unto his in
[1:36:09] the resurrection.
[1:36:11] It is at the resurrection that the royal
[1:36:15] seed will see many royal seeds like unto
[1:36:19] himself. And we know that a lot of
[1:36:21] people have gone on before us and they
[1:36:24] are the bride of Jesus
[1:36:26] Christ. They don't they don't get to
[1:36:29] escape the taste of
[1:36:32] death. But there's going to be people on
[1:36:34] earth that will escape the taste of
[1:36:37] death. Right? There will be a people who
[1:36:40] will have his very
[1:36:42] character. It will be his life, his very
[1:36:46] life living out through them at the
[1:36:49] resurrection. What a tremendous thing
[1:36:52] that is.
[1:36:54] And we know we've talked about it many,
[1:36:56] many times as we studied out the church
[1:36:58] age book. You know, he's working on one
[1:37:00] thing. And that's what election is for
[1:37:02] is to actually work out a character.
[1:37:05] That's what he's after is the character
[1:37:07] of himself in the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:15] Not his character plus ours, not ours
[1:37:17] plus his, but just his. The royal seed
[1:37:21] will see many royal seeds like unto
[1:37:23] himself, and they will be even as he is.
[1:37:26] For says John, we shall be like him.
[1:37:29] This is what John the Baptist was
[1:37:31] referring to when he said Jesus would
[1:37:34] gather the wheat into the garner. That
[1:37:37] was the resurrection where the redeemed
[1:37:40] who had been elected unto eternal life
[1:37:43] came in. Now then, the record of this
[1:37:47] wheat plant whose end is to reproduce
[1:37:50] the original seed in multiplied form is
[1:37:55] the book of life.
[1:37:57] I repeat the history or record of this
[1:38:00] wheat plant is the book of
[1:38:03] life of which a part of the book of life
[1:38:08] is the record of eternal
[1:38:10] life. A section of the book of
[1:38:13] life. This is convincingly seen by
[1:38:17] examining the wheat plant. A bare seed
[1:38:20] is sown. Soon a blade is seen.
[1:38:24] But that is not the wheat
[1:38:26] yet. Then it grows into a
[1:38:29] stock. This is not yet the
[1:38:32] wheat. Life is there, but not the wheat.
[1:38:37] Then at the end of the stock is a little
[1:38:40] spike that sends out a
[1:38:42] tassel. Still a wheat plant, but no
[1:38:46] wheat
[1:38:47] yet. Then the plant is
[1:38:50] pollenized and we see the chaff grow.
[1:38:54] This looks mighty like the wheat, but it
[1:38:57] is not yet
[1:38:59] seed. Then forms the wheat in the
[1:39:02] husk. It is now back to what it was
[1:39:06] originally. Now the ripened wheat is
[1:39:13] harvested. This is what I wanted to
[1:39:15] bring and show as the question. So you
[1:39:18] can see why this is really uh there's no
[1:39:22] way you can address it even in one
[1:39:26] service. I think it's beautiful the way
[1:39:28] brother Brandham talks about this. The
[1:39:31] plant that we're talking about the wheat
[1:39:33] plant, every single stage of that wheat
[1:39:35] plant is required in order for it to
[1:39:38] come back to seed. Hallelujah. To say
[1:39:40] that the chaff isn't required and you
[1:39:43] know some people are chaff and some
[1:39:45] people are tassel and I'm wheat. No, no,
[1:39:48] no, no, no. We don't have wheat unless
[1:39:51] we have all of the rest of the plant.
[1:39:54] And the beautiful thing about it is it
[1:39:56] is the exact same life in every single
[1:39:59] portion of the plant. The only
[1:40:01] difference is the seed itself can
[1:40:04] actually reproduce and bring forth more
[1:40:08] life. And that's why it has to go full
[1:40:10] circle. And that's why we are as the
[1:40:12] bride of Jesus Christ compared to the
[1:40:15] wheat because it's not our life inside
[1:40:18] us. It's Christ. It has to be Christ.
[1:40:22] You know, talking about
[1:40:24] election. I I I'm laughing because
[1:40:28] I that's only one quote. As the brothers
[1:40:31] know, I sent some quotes and uh I've got
[1:40:34] some notes and we're just starting
[1:40:36] now. We'll pick up next week, I guess.
[1:40:39] You know, talking about election, it's
[1:40:41] mentioned six times in the Bible in
[1:40:44] Romans chapter 9 11. For the children
[1:40:47] being not yet born, neither having done
[1:40:50] any good or evil, that the purpose of
[1:40:52] God according to election might stand,
[1:40:55] not of works, but of him that
[1:40:59] calleth. Only election. Romans 11:5.
[1:41:02] Even so then at this present time also
[1:41:05] there is a remnant according to the
[1:41:08] election of grace. Such a beautiful
[1:41:11] thing. Romans 11:7 What then? Israel
[1:41:15] hath not obtained that which he seeketh
[1:41:17] for, but the election hath obtained it,
[1:41:22] and the rest were blinded. Why were they
[1:41:23] blinded? For our sakes. Romans 11:28. As
[1:41:28] concerning the gospel, they are enemies
[1:41:30] for your sakes. But as touching the
[1:41:33] election, they are beloved for the
[1:41:36] father's sakes. Because you know that
[1:41:40] the Jews, brother Brandham talks about
[1:41:42] them in the church age book. And he
[1:41:44] says, they are elected. They are not the
[1:41:47] enemy of God. As some church folks out
[1:41:50] there in Christianity would say that the
[1:41:54] Jews are the ones that persecuted and
[1:41:55] crucified the Savior. So they're bad
[1:41:59] guys. They're not bad guys. They're
[1:42:00] elected to be in their position. This is
[1:42:03] what God chose. He chose those people
[1:42:06] for a purpose so that we could be
[1:42:09] called. It's amazing to think about the
[1:42:12] sovereignty of God. Oh my. 1
[1:42:14] Thessalonians 1 verse 4. Knowing
[1:42:17] brethren, beloved, your election of God.
[1:42:22] Second Peter 1, wherefore the rather
[1:42:24] brethren, give diligence to make your
[1:42:26] calling and election sure. For if you do
[1:42:28] these things, ye shall never
[1:42:30] fall. It's mentioned in the
[1:42:33] Bible in the exposition of the seven
[1:42:36] church ages. Just setting a background
[1:42:39] for this as we get into some of the
[1:42:41] quotes and we'll have to pick it up next
[1:42:43] time, but in in the exposition of the
[1:42:45] seven church ages, it's mentioned 17
[1:42:48] times
[1:42:50] election. And you know, it's mentioned
[1:42:52] 258 times in the message entirely.
[1:42:57] And uh I I just think it's amazing.
[1:43:00] Election is not something that we need
[1:43:02] to be afraid of. Election isn't
[1:43:04] something that we need to try and argue
[1:43:06] about or even try and comprehend with
[1:43:09] our human minds other than what brother
[1:43:12] Bradom said. Yay. What the Holy Ghost
[1:43:14] said through brother Bradom there is
[1:43:16] that we need to just accept it by faith
[1:43:18] just like salvation. We can't comprehend
[1:43:22] election. I think it's so important to
[1:43:24] to to maybe just say that especially for
[1:43:27] the young people, for the people that
[1:43:29] maybe are struggling with it, whoever
[1:43:31] has a question about election. It's
[1:43:33] God's choice, not ours. And I think it's
[1:43:36] beautiful because the reason we are here
[1:43:39] is that he's chosen us unto election.
[1:43:42] That's why we're here tonight. Not so
[1:43:44] that we can find ourselves in one of
[1:43:46] those other three categories where we
[1:43:47] have to be judged. We're busy here
[1:43:49] judging ourselves right now. Amen.
[1:43:53] Trusting that the Lord will do it, you
[1:43:55] know. Um my I wonder how far to go
[1:44:02] tonight. It's just so rich. I just I
[1:44:05] kind of feel bad that we're done
[1:44:07] actually reading through the exposition
[1:44:08] of the seven church ages because I've
[1:44:10] enjoyed it so much. 62 services and uh I
[1:44:16] just feel like going and starting over,
[1:44:17] starting right at the very beginning
[1:44:18] again. There's so much in there right
[1:44:20] from the start. But, you know, talking
[1:44:23] about election is just such a a rich
[1:44:25] thing. I'm just gonna we'll come back to
[1:44:28] this, but I'm just going to jump ahead a
[1:44:30] little bit here. I wanted to bring a
[1:44:32] quote and
[1:44:33] I hope I can find
[1:44:36] it. Bear with me for a
[1:44:41] second. Yeah, I'll
[1:44:45] just It's the trouble when you get too
[1:44:47] many quotes and you get too studied into
[1:44:50] something. It's I'm sorry. I know it
[1:44:52] becomes really awkward. I'm just going
[1:44:54] to read this as we close. I'll call the
[1:44:56] musicians
[1:45:01] tonight. You know, brother Bradomy talks
[1:45:04] about being elected and uh how we go
[1:45:08] through trials here on on
[1:45:12] earth. And
[1:45:15] uh I just have way too much here in this
[1:45:19] one quote. I apologize. It's out of the
[1:45:21] exposition of the seven church ages in
[1:45:23] the Samriian church age. We will uh read
[1:45:27] this
[1:45:29] again, but I just wanted to bring this
[1:45:32] point. You know,
[1:45:35] we we look at trials in our lives and
[1:45:38] and sometimes wonder why we have them.
[1:45:41] And God is working out perfection in our
[1:45:45] lives.
[1:45:47] And just for the sake of time, I'm only
[1:45:49] going to read the the back po portion of
[1:45:52] this. And according to Paul, he has left
[1:45:55] his church a measure of
[1:45:58] suffering that they too by their faith
[1:46:01] in God while suffering for him would
[1:46:04] come to a place of
[1:46:06] perfection. And he knows what every
[1:46:09] single one of us need to come to that
[1:46:11] place of perfection.
[1:46:16] Why did he want this? James
[1:46:19] 1:24. My brethren, count it all joy when
[1:46:22] ye fall into diverse temptations,
[1:46:24] knowing
[1:46:25] this, that the trying of your faith
[1:46:28] workketh patience, but let patience have
[1:46:31] her perfect work, that ye may be perfect
[1:46:34] and entire, wanting nothing.
[1:46:37] I remember when I was call it a babe in
[1:46:39] Christ, I was
[1:46:41] lamenting to an elder brother about some
[1:46:45] of the struggles in my
[1:46:47] life. And I know that we all have them.
[1:46:50] Um, but I was lamenting about my
[1:46:53] struggles. And you know, the elder
[1:46:55] brother said to me, he said, "Well, you
[1:46:57] know that we all have to have
[1:46:59] struggles. God has chosen that." The
[1:47:02] prophet said that Satan has one punch
[1:47:04] coming to every single person and and
[1:47:07] that's going to be our trial and
[1:47:09] sometimes it's this and sometimes it's
[1:47:11] that and sometimes it's the other and
[1:47:13] you know my struggles were maybe more
[1:47:16] inward and that's what I was expressing
[1:47:18] to the brother and he said you know what
[1:47:20] would you rather have would you rather
[1:47:22] have maybe a car accident where you
[1:47:24] become maybe a quadripollegic and and
[1:47:27] that's your struggle or or a sickness
[1:47:30] that impairs s you or
[1:47:32] blindness, what would you rather have?
[1:47:35] And it kind of put it into perspective
[1:47:37] to me because I'm able to live maybe
[1:47:39] portion part partially a full life, you
[1:47:42] know, I can I can get around and and and
[1:47:45] and live, but it just got me to think
[1:47:49] what what would I really prefer? Because
[1:47:51] the if the devil has a punch, what is it
[1:47:54] that we would rather have?
[1:47:59] He wants to see his character in our
[1:48:01] lives. Brother Brandom, he says this.
[1:48:02] Why does he stand by? The reason is in
[1:48:04] Romans 8:17 to18. We're going to get
[1:48:08] back into this. I'm not going to just uh
[1:48:11] call this good, but I just want to close
[1:48:12] on this and just maybe plant this seed.
[1:48:15] And if children, then hes of God and
[1:48:18] joint hes with Christ. If so be that we
[1:48:21] suffer with him, that we may be also
[1:48:24] glorified together. For I reckon that
[1:48:26] the sufferings of this present time are
[1:48:27] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:48:30] which shall be revealed within
[1:48:32] us. Unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[1:48:35] reign with him. You have to suffer to
[1:48:39] reign. The reason for
[1:48:42] this is that character simply is never
[1:48:46] made without
[1:48:48] suffering. And you know, you can see it
[1:48:50] when you deal with people, in dealing
[1:48:52] with human beings.
[1:48:55] The people who are the kindest, most
[1:48:58] compassionate people look like they've
[1:49:00] gone through life on a flowery bed of
[1:49:02] ease. But unfortunately, that's not the
[1:49:05] case. Those are the people that have
[1:49:07] gone through the fiery trials of
[1:49:10] affliction and they understand what it
[1:49:13] means to have problems and issues in
[1:49:15] life and and they're able to relate to
[1:49:18] individuals when they see them going
[1:49:20] through trials. And I think it's
[1:49:22] wonderful as believers, we have that
[1:49:23] ability to offer peace and offer joy and
[1:49:28] understanding to those people who are
[1:49:30] going through
[1:49:31] trials because we have to get a
[1:49:34] character that's fit to reign. The
[1:49:36] reason for this is that character is
[1:49:38] simply never made without suffering.
[1:49:40] Character is not a victory, brothers and
[1:49:42] sisters. His character is not a it it is
[1:49:46] a victory. Sorry. It is not a gift. We
[1:49:49] don't just get handed a gift of
[1:49:52] character, his
[1:49:53] character. We have to overcome. And that
[1:49:57] is how we are able to actually sit with
[1:49:59] him in his throne of judgment to be
[1:50:02] overcomers of this age is to actually
[1:50:04] overcome. And you know, I I'm learning
[1:50:08] that probably one of the biggest
[1:50:10] hurdles, one of the biggest obstacles in
[1:50:12] this world to overcome is this guy right
[1:50:15] here. The guy that we see, the woman
[1:50:17] that we see in the mirror, that's that's
[1:50:20] the biggest portion of overcoming in
[1:50:22] this life. When we can overcome that
[1:50:26] person, we're beginning to see the
[1:50:28] character of Christ in our lives because
[1:50:31] we know the battle for salvation, the
[1:50:34] battle for healing was
[1:50:36] won, not at the whipping post and not at
[1:50:39] the
[1:50:40] cross, not even at the
[1:50:43] resurrection. It was in the Garden of
[1:50:45] Eden when he laid down his will and
[1:50:47] said, "I know that I want this. Can this
[1:50:50] cup pass from me?" Oh my. But
[1:50:53] nevertheless, let me take that cup and
[1:50:55] drink it. Right? It's when he laid down
[1:50:58] his will. That's when the victory was
[1:51:00] won. That was when the first drops of
[1:51:02] blood hit the ground for the redemption
[1:51:04] of this world. Maybe stand with us
[1:51:05] tonight as we
[1:51:07] close. Character is a victory. It's not
[1:51:10] a gift. A man with character can't reign
[1:51:12] because power apart from character is
[1:51:16] satanic. But power with character is fit
[1:51:18] to rule. And since he wants us to share
[1:51:21] even his throne on the same basis that
[1:51:24] he overcame and is sat down in his
[1:51:26] father's throne, then we have to
[1:51:29] overcome to sit with
[1:51:32] him. And the little temporary suffering
[1:51:34] we go through now is not worthy to be
[1:51:36] compared to the tremendous glory that
[1:51:39] will be revealed in us when he comes.
[1:51:41] Oh, what treasures are laid up for those
[1:51:43] who are willing to enter into his
[1:51:45] kingdom through much tribulation. And
[1:51:47] you know, I I I just said this before
[1:51:49] when we studied this out, it just it
[1:51:51] just jumps out to me. We read this and
[1:51:53] think the little temporary suffering
[1:51:55] that we go through. We we don't go
[1:51:57] through little temporary sufferings
[1:51:58] here. Some of the sufferings that we go
[1:52:00] through, they shake our world. They
[1:52:02] change our lives forever. We're not the
[1:52:04] same people when we go through these
[1:52:07] trials. But he calls them little
[1:52:09] temporary
[1:52:10] sufferings. How do we explain it? We
[1:52:13] can't. Let's just go to him in prayer.
[1:52:17] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just thank you
[1:52:19] for your word. Thank you for the study
[1:52:22] and the exposition of the seven church
[1:52:23] ages. Lord, thank you for the the
[1:52:26] question, Lord, about election, Lord,
[1:52:28] how we never even touched it tonight.
[1:52:31] All as we did was mention the
[1:52:34] question, the origin of it, where it
[1:52:36] came from, Lord. And Father, I pray that
[1:52:39] we would be able to somehow come up with
[1:52:42] an answer in the hearts of your
[1:52:44] children, Lord Jesus. That we would be
[1:52:47] able to look at this this thought of
[1:52:49] election and understand that it's your
[1:52:51] will that you chose us in you before the
[1:52:54] foundation of the world. That we would
[1:52:56] maybe start to look at things just a
[1:52:59] little bit differently. a and realize
[1:53:01] that you are working out your character
[1:53:04] in us, Father, that's fit to rule and
[1:53:06] reign with you in your throne. Father,
[1:53:09] we love you tonight and we just want to
[1:53:11] commit all that was said and done in
[1:53:14] this service into your hands for your
[1:53:16] glory. We pray that you would keep your
[1:53:18] hand upon each one of us as we go our
[1:53:20] separate ways. Lord, be with those who
[1:53:22] are traveling tonight. Lord, we think of
[1:53:25] brother Paul and sister Elaine coming
[1:53:26] back from dealing with the affairs of
[1:53:29] brother Pete Clawson. Lord, we pray for
[1:53:32] the family, Lord, that you would just
[1:53:34] somehow through this this transition of
[1:53:36] life, Lord, that you would minister to
[1:53:39] the children, Father, and the
[1:53:41] grandchildren, Lord, the nieces and
[1:53:43] nephews, Father, the the people that
[1:53:45] were affected by Brother Pete's life,
[1:53:47] Lord, that they would maybe just draw
[1:53:49] closer to you. Father, we love you and
[1:53:52] we thank you. We just ask all these
[1:53:53] things now in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:53:57] pray.
[1:53:58] Amen.
[1:54:00] Amen. Is that marvelous grace?
[1:54:05] Yeah.
[1:54:08] Marvelous grace of our
[1:54:12] loving Lord.
[1:54:15] Grace that
[1:54:18] exceeds our sin and our
[1:54:23] guilt.
