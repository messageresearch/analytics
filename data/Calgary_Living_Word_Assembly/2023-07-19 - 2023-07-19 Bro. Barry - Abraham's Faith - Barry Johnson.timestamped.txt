[44:22] amen
[44:23] amen thank you musicians
[44:26] tonight
[44:28] certainly amazing to see a full stage of
[44:30] musicians every chair is full just
[44:33] amazing God bless you all tonight if you
[44:36] have your Bibles I'd like to read a
[44:38] couple of scriptures
[44:40] hopefully
[44:41] something to encourage you with
[44:44] just felt led today to go
[44:47] a certain direction
[44:49] many times I wonder Lord how
[44:52] why where
[44:54] and he never disappoints
[44:58] I'd just like to read from Romans
[44:59] chapter 7 tonight
[45:04] maybe real familiar scriptures and then
[45:07] just over the page in Romans chapter 8.
[45:15] sometimes I just think it's real good to
[45:18] just be encouraged by the word
[45:21] Romans chapter 7 I'd like to read
[45:24] just one verse verse 18.
[45:28] and then Romans 8 verse 11.
[45:33] Romans 7 verse 18.
[45:37] for I know
[45:39] that in me that is in my flesh
[45:43] dwelleth no good thing
[45:46] for to will is present with me
[45:50] but how to perform that which is good
[45:54] I find not
[45:58] Romans 8
[46:00] verse 11.
[46:02] but if the spirit of him
[46:05] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[46:08] in you
[46:11] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[46:14] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies
[46:18] by his spirit
[46:20] that dwelleth in you
[46:24] let's just bow one more time
[46:26] Heavenly Father Lord I believe that we
[46:28] have just asked a question and Lord
[46:31] you've given an answer just in two
[46:33] scriptures father and I believe that if
[46:35] we were to just close our Bibles and go
[46:37] home tonight already father that we
[46:39] would be blessed just by hearing your
[46:42] word father tonight we pray that you
[46:44] would take the words that are spoken
[46:46] father and just break them open to us
[46:48] fresh Lord that you would feed us Lord
[46:51] that when we leave here tonight we would
[46:52] say truly you spoke to us father give us
[46:55] Hearts to receive that which you want
[46:57] spoken to the church tonight we just ask
[46:59] all these things now in Jesus Christ's
[47:01] name we pray amen God bless you tonight
[47:04] you may be seated
[47:07] just for a few moments
[47:09] I'll try not to go along tonight
[47:12] certainly thankful for the service last
[47:14] Wednesday brother Emanuel for putting
[47:17] your shoulder to the wheel and certainly
[47:19] thankful I don't know if I say it enough
[47:21] and I I just forgive me if I don't I'm
[47:24] certainly thankful for the specials
[47:26] it's amazing to see the gifts in the
[47:28] body and the people that want to express
[47:30] those gifts don't ever be bashful for it
[47:33] and I want it to be clear I'll never get
[47:36] upset because we don't have enough time
[47:38] to preach seemingly if people want to
[47:40] sing obviously there's an order to the
[47:42] service but if you have a special you
[47:44] want to bring every single week it's
[47:45] okay you can do it and I believe the
[47:49] body of Christ is blessed by it what
[47:51] happens is we're setting an atmosphere
[47:52] where he can move in and it's a
[47:55] tremendous thing and many times when we
[47:57] feel like we don't want to do it that's
[47:58] the best time to do it if the Lord has
[48:01] put something on our heart
[48:03] thank you brother Emanuel for taking the
[48:05] service last week tremendous service I
[48:07] took it in uh
[48:09] in the recording and certainly thankful
[48:11] for the specials in the body just a
[48:15] couple of announcements before we get
[48:16] too far into this we've got the uh I was
[48:18] talking to brother Joel about this
[48:20] where's brother General there's brother
[48:21] Joel the uh I figured we should call it
[48:24] something now and I'm going to say it
[48:26] tonight from the pulpit we're going to
[48:27] have the unofficial annual Calgary youth
[48:30] Fellowship weekend
[48:32] this weekend
[48:34] and uh hopefully soon we'll make it the
[48:36] official annual Calgary youth Fellowship
[48:38] weekend but we'll just see what the Lord
[48:40] will do we seem to have more and more
[48:42] interest and uh it's a tremendous thing
[48:45] for the Joel and Sister Crystal have a
[48:47] gift for hospitality and creating
[48:49] activities that the youth can engage in
[48:52] and that truly is a gift and we're
[48:54] certainly thankful for that in the body
[48:55] and the desire to participate in that so
[48:58] this weekend is going to be a fellowship
[49:00] at their new home they're opening it up
[49:03] and then they're going to have a
[49:04] Saturday hike as well and we just want
[49:07] to remember everyone in prayer that
[49:09] they'll be safe on the hike and that the
[49:10] Lord will bless their Fellowship it's
[49:12] important to Fellowship especially for
[49:14] the young people
[49:15] it's critical in fact the relationships
[49:18] need to be developed as friends and
[49:20] potential spouses as well not saying
[49:23] that we're creating an environment for
[49:24] spousal connections don't get me wrong
[49:27] but we know as Believers you want your
[49:29] children to associate with Believers you
[49:32] don't want them going out in the world
[49:33] and trying to find a spouse and think
[49:35] that you can convert them to get the
[49:37] Holy Ghost it ain't going to work that
[49:38] way it doesn't work that way you need to
[49:40] find someone who is a Believer who
[49:42] believes this word and what better way
[49:44] than to have Christian Fellowship so
[49:47] um I'm certainly thankful we're going to
[49:49] have a busy weekend then we will have a
[49:52] potluck on Sunday potluck fellowship and
[49:54] we'll be supplying some pizza for that
[49:55] just to try something different and we'd
[49:58] appreciate it if you could bring a side
[50:00] dish to go along with it maybe solids or
[50:02] desserts or whatever but I'm sure
[50:04] everyone has already seen the
[50:05] communication from Lisa my wife and we
[50:08] just trust it'll be a wonderful weekend
[50:10] the summer sure is a wonderful time we
[50:12] have a different sort of perspective on
[50:15] things children are out of school and
[50:17] you know it's uh it's quite easy to stay
[50:20] up late and uh and to sleep in and if
[50:23] we're not careful it can it can be a
[50:25] habit-forming thing but we have
[50:27] of lives that we need to tend to and
[50:31] usually that keeps us out of trouble
[50:34] tonight I want to just start from a
[50:37] couple weeks ago where I left off I
[50:40] think it was just such an amazing thing
[50:43] um service that brother Ben took I I
[50:45] just can't really get away from it and
[50:47] out of the fundamental foundation for
[50:49] Faith it's a quote that I read last time
[50:52] but I just want to say it again
[50:55] um I'm not even sure what paragraph it
[50:57] is but brother Branham he says now
[51:01] Satan by the laws of sin and death
[51:04] makes everything that sin and death
[51:07] bought
[51:08] operate
[51:10] to Satan sends a cancer
[51:14] the man recognized it receives it
[51:18] Satan sends heartaches we recognize it
[51:21] and receive it
[51:23] and if Satan by his power
[51:26] can make his laws work in man
[51:30] how much more
[51:32] ought god with his power make his laws
[51:35] work in man
[51:37] if Satan can make his laws be sure
[51:41] and US recognize it which he does
[51:44] doesn't he
[51:46] if Satan can make his laws be sure and
[51:51] US recognize it how much more ought God
[51:55] to his children
[51:58] to make his laws be recognized among his
[52:01] people of Divine Healing Revelation
[52:03] power gifts manifestation of the spirit
[52:09] the law of sin and death works in the
[52:11] people and the law of Liberty of Christ
[52:14] has come unto us to set us free from
[52:17] those things
[52:18] remember we've been saying it where the
[52:21] spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[52:24] and that's not just brother Berry
[52:26] talking about maybe a a Pentecostal
[52:29] slant where the services are people get
[52:31] excited because the spirit of Lord is
[52:34] there and there's liberty and sure
[52:35] enough that's a true scripture where the
[52:38] spirit of the Lord is there's liberty
[52:39] people want to clap their hands they
[52:41] want to scream they want to shout they
[52:43] maybe want to run around the building
[52:45] they just can't contain themselves maybe
[52:47] musicians play Loud they play fast it's
[52:50] the spirit of the Lord there's liberty
[52:52] but I believe it goes further than that
[52:54] and and I want to sort of harp on that
[52:56] tonight the spirit of the Lord bringing
[52:58] Liberty is to understand brothers and
[53:00] sisters we're not bound by Satan and his
[53:03] laws as Believers of this word for our
[53:05] day we're Bound by the word for our day
[53:08] which is absolute Liberty over Satan and
[53:11] his laws
[53:13] and I think it's just so beautiful when
[53:15] we look at this scripture in Romans
[53:16] chapter 7 verse 18 I know that in me is
[53:20] it that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[53:23] thing how many people can say that you
[53:25] can look in the mirror and say man I
[53:27] know there's nothing good in my life
[53:30] many times we know what the problem is
[53:34] show me the solution
[53:37] telling me there's a problem doesn't do
[53:39] me any good I already know that I've got
[53:41] this problem I already know that I've
[53:43] got this thing
[53:45] you know what happens is sometimes
[53:46] people they get stuck under law and
[53:48] legalism and when they're under law and
[53:50] legalism they're continually looking at
[53:51] the problems
[53:53] in their own life and especially in
[53:55] other people's lives but if we can stop
[53:58] doing that stop looking at the problems
[53:59] and start looking at the promise
[54:01] brothers and sisters the problems melt
[54:04] away the problems have no more power
[54:05] over us
[54:07] I just think it's so beautiful though
[54:09] Verse 18 for I know that in me that is
[54:11] in my flesh dwelleth no good thing
[54:13] there's nothing good in our flesh we're
[54:15] born in sin shaped and iniquity come
[54:17] into this world speaking of life we are
[54:19] in this hybrid condition we never did it
[54:24] for to will is present with me we know
[54:27] that when the disciples went with Jesus
[54:28] into the garden he said just Terry here
[54:32] and I'm just going to go a little
[54:33] further and I'm going to pray in the
[54:35] Garden of Gethsemane
[54:37] and the and the disciples couldn't even
[54:39] stay awake they couldn't even stay awake
[54:40] to pray and and Jesus came back a couple
[54:43] times didn't he and he found him
[54:44] sleeping a couple times and he said you
[54:46] know Kat you just Terry for a knock out
[54:48] you just pray for an hour
[54:50] can't you just take your time and and
[54:52] pray for an hour even keep your eyes
[54:55] awake but then he said you know what I
[54:57] get it you live in this hybrid condition
[55:01] the flesh is weak but the spirit is
[55:03] willing
[55:04] and he said those words and then he said
[55:06] up let's go
[55:08] the man of Perdition is here he knew his
[55:10] time had come at that point
[55:12] but here we have this this scripture
[55:14] here
[55:16] I know that it that in me that is in my
[55:19] flesh dwelleth no good thing for it to
[55:20] will is present
[55:22] with me I desire to my will is there but
[55:26] how to perform that which is good I find
[55:30] not
[55:32] and I just want to say this for those
[55:34] people who say I I look at the message
[55:36] of the hour I try living the message of
[55:37] the hour I just can't live it and walk
[55:38] away and maybe just sort of On The
[55:40] Fringe because I don't know anybody that
[55:42] can live the message of the hour no one
[55:43] can live the message of the hour no one
[55:46] can live the message of the hour the
[55:48] only way we'll ever be able to live the
[55:50] message of the hour is for us to die and
[55:52] for him to live the message of the hour
[55:54] through us that's the only way you can
[55:56] be a believer of this word for today you
[55:58] can say you believe God sent a prophet
[56:00] you can have all the books and tapes you
[56:02] could be raised in a message Church in a
[56:04] message home that does all the right
[56:05] message things but until you have that
[56:08] same spirit that raised Jesus Christ out
[56:10] of the Grave until that happens
[56:13] it's just the law and and it'll always
[56:16] be a question we'll always Wonder Isn't
[56:19] there something more but tonight I want
[56:21] to talk about that I want to talk about
[56:22] the Glorious Liberty of him that has
[56:24] raised Christ out of the Dead out of the
[56:26] Grave because what happens when that
[56:28] happens if the spirit of him that raised
[56:30] Jesus from the dead dwells in you not in
[56:34] your church not in your family not in
[56:36] your pastor not in the deacons if he
[56:38] dwells in you he that raised up Christ
[56:41] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[56:44] mortal bodies
[56:45] not by attendance to church not by
[56:48] associations not by positionally placing
[56:52] yourself geographically in the world but
[56:55] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[56:57] that's the only way it's going to happen
[57:00] that's the only way that it will Quicken
[57:02] our mortal bodies and I think it's so
[57:04] beautiful because it answers that
[57:05] question I I don't know how to do this
[57:08] how to perform that which is good I find
[57:10] not and here we have Paul
[57:13] getting the Revelation just turn the
[57:16] page Paul and just continue writing Paul
[57:19] and Paul writes it that if the same
[57:21] spirit that raised Jesus from the dead I
[57:23] get it if that same Spirit dwells in
[57:26] your mortal body it will Quicken your
[57:27] mortal body if the Same Spirit could
[57:30] raise Jesus from the dead then it can
[57:32] raise our Same Spirit from the dead it
[57:34] can take us from the law of sin and
[57:37] death and take us unto the law of
[57:38] Liberty of Christ that's come unto us to
[57:41] set us free from those things
[57:43] brother Adam goes on to say so I believe
[57:45] this with all my heart I believe that
[57:47] we're nearing the age that when people
[57:49] are going to recognize these things
[57:52] and what I want to get to tonight
[57:53] brothers and sisters is to recognize
[57:55] these things isn't to recognize God's
[57:57] not a prophet not to recognize there's
[57:58] Divine Healing in the church which God
[58:00] did both both of those things have
[58:01] happened but to recognize who we are to
[58:03] recognize that that same Spirit quickens
[58:05] us to this word it gives us the ability
[58:07] to have the Liberty to be free from this
[58:10] flesh
[58:11] to not look at this flesh kind of like I
[58:14] was talking about on Sunday that story
[58:16] about the snake we can look at the snake
[58:17] and say oh my I rebuke you I can hear
[58:19] your rattle I know you're there I can
[58:21] even see you I can see the shed I can
[58:23] see oh I know all about that snake that
[58:25] problem and I continue to look at that
[58:26] problem and that problem I keep hearing
[58:28] that problem and that problem and that
[58:30] problem what about the promise
[58:32] what about just walking away and just
[58:34] going down the pathway and you can
[58:36] eventually you won't hear that
[58:37] rattlesnake shaking you won't hear it at
[58:39] all and eventually it'll be gone you
[58:42] won't even think about it and it'll just
[58:44] be looking through your pictures one day
[58:45] you'll be like wow there was that
[58:46] problem on the pathway how many times in
[58:49] our lives have we experienced that as
[58:51] believers
[58:52] we've gone into the Glorious Liberty of
[58:54] Christ in our lives
[58:56] and suddenly we remember that thing whoa
[58:59] that thing that used to bug me
[59:01] how but I can't hear the rattle of that
[59:04] anymore I don't have any part of that
[59:06] anymore in my life
[59:08] what's happening is we're recognizing
[59:10] these things that brother radam says
[59:12] that we've had so much vain philosophy
[59:15] and so forth and teachings that ought
[59:17] not to be until it has set
[59:21] the human mind to a revolution of
[59:24] thinking on matters of this and that and
[59:26] take away from the word of God and you
[59:28] know what I would say one of the worst
[59:29] things that's happened around the
[59:31] message of the hour is for people to
[59:32] rise up thinking that they've got a
[59:35] Ministry to draw men unto themselves
[59:38] vain philosophy taking people and
[59:41] teaching them things they ought not to
[59:43] be taught what about just teach them the
[59:45] word
[59:46] show them what the prophet of God said
[59:49] and let God do the work
[59:51] it's not a man thing
[59:54] but now I want to get to where we want
[59:56] to go to tonight I just think it's so
[59:58] beautiful because we can recognize all
[1:00:00] that Satan's done oh I got this cancer
[1:00:02] oh I've got this sickness oh I've got
[1:00:04] this problem my finances my marriage my
[1:00:07] children all these problems and things
[1:00:09] in our lives stop looking at those
[1:00:11] brothers and sisters get the token and
[1:00:14] just hold that token and remind Satan
[1:00:16] you know what you can show me all of
[1:00:18] your things but I want to show you this
[1:00:19] this is the token of the holy ghost in
[1:00:22] my life and whether I see it whether I
[1:00:24] feel it it doesn't matter to me God said
[1:00:26] and I believe and that's all that
[1:00:28] matters that doesn't even affect me when
[1:00:31] Satan says stuff like that
[1:00:34] even though it does
[1:00:36] but I'm going somewhere tonight with
[1:00:37] this you might look at me and and maybe
[1:00:39] I sound like I'm crazy I feel like it's
[1:00:41] awfully quiet tonight and I'm sorry I
[1:00:43] don't want to sound like a lunatic here
[1:00:44] but you know what Abraham was a lunatic
[1:00:46] in his day wasn't he and that's really
[1:00:48] what we're getting to
[1:00:49] think about the story of Abraham in his
[1:00:52] life and and some quotes that brother
[1:00:53] Branham talks about it how much
[1:00:55] criticism he must have had you're
[1:00:58] calling yourself Abraham brother Branham
[1:01:01] says his family said your name was Abram
[1:01:04] you're calling yourself Abraham father
[1:01:06] of Nations you're 100 years old you
[1:01:09] think you're going to have a child
[1:01:11] you're crazy
[1:01:13] but we know the word of God says that he
[1:01:15] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:01:16] through unbelief but was strong giving
[1:01:19] God praise he understood that God said
[1:01:22] it and that's all that mattered and you
[1:01:23] know in our day if we could just believe
[1:01:25] that God said it truly believe that God
[1:01:27] said it and that's all that matters it
[1:01:29] will change everything in our lives what
[1:01:31] it will do firstly is it will dull that
[1:01:33] rattlesnake sound of Satan in our lives
[1:01:35] we need to tune him down and turn up the
[1:01:38] word in our lives and the only way that
[1:01:40] happens is by believing and Faith cometh
[1:01:43] by hearing and hearing the word faith is
[1:01:45] what's going to unlock this for us you
[1:01:48] know in Romans 8 chapter Romans 8
[1:01:52] 12.
[1:01:55] I just was reading this I'll read 11
[1:01:57] first but if the spirit of him that
[1:01:59] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:02:01] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:02:03] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:02:06] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:02:09] you we know that word Quicken means to
[1:02:10] bring to life it's not going to make us
[1:02:13] speed up and and be able to do different
[1:02:15] things in our lives it's going to
[1:02:16] Quicken our bodies and give us life life
[1:02:20] Eternal We'll have eternal life right
[1:02:21] now in our bodies in this flesh that we
[1:02:24] live in and that eternal life is going
[1:02:26] to be that logos that that little lick
[1:02:28] of fire that we come together to bring
[1:02:29] together to make one lick of fire to
[1:02:32] burn bright before the Lord but here we
[1:02:34] have this scripture and the next verse
[1:02:36] verse 12 says therefore brethren we are
[1:02:40] debtors
[1:02:41] not to the flesh to live after the flesh
[1:02:44] we're not looking at the flesh to live
[1:02:46] after the flesh but when we see that in
[1:02:49] our lives when we're looking at the
[1:02:50] flesh I just want to remind us tonight
[1:02:52] we're looking at the wrong thing
[1:02:53] brothers and sisters don't look at the
[1:02:55] flesh don't look at your flesh
[1:02:58] don't look at mine
[1:02:59] this flesh has to perish
[1:03:02] brother Branham says it real clearly
[1:03:04] that you can't see the real me and I
[1:03:06] can't see the real you
[1:03:08] we're stuck in this theophany in this
[1:03:11] body I mean we're not in our theophany
[1:03:12] body our theophany body is the perfect
[1:03:14] body that's the image that Christ sees
[1:03:17] us and that God sees us in he doesn't
[1:03:19] even see us in this condition he hears
[1:03:22] our voice he wants to hear what our
[1:03:23] confession is
[1:03:26] he wants to hear our words what we say
[1:03:28] because out of the abundance of the
[1:03:31] heart the mouth speaketh
[1:03:34] so where we are in our hearts and in our
[1:03:37] minds what we're going to do is express
[1:03:40] it through our mouths
[1:03:42] that's why I've said so many times we
[1:03:44] can give the devil Credence or we can
[1:03:46] give the word of God Jesus Christ power
[1:03:49] in our lives credence
[1:03:51] therefore brethren we are not debtors
[1:03:54] we are dead or sorry not to the flesh to
[1:03:56] live after the flesh
[1:03:58] in the Amplified Bible that it says so
[1:04:00] then brethren we are debtors
[1:04:04] but not to the flesh
[1:04:06] we are not obligated to our carnal
[1:04:10] nature
[1:04:13] Satan wants us to believe that we're
[1:04:15] obligated to our carnal nature
[1:04:18] especially when we start to talk about
[1:04:20] past family traits and different things
[1:04:23] that are associated around maybe
[1:04:26] genetics and maybe my dad had a bad
[1:04:28] temper so that's why I've got a bad
[1:04:30] temper and I can't help it it's just the
[1:04:32] way it's been maybe his dad had a bad
[1:04:33] temper and you know what that is it's a
[1:04:35] spirit and that Spirit gets around us
[1:04:37] and it just wants us to give it Credence
[1:04:39] it wants to give us get us to speak
[1:04:42] about it but but here we have this this
[1:04:45] word I just think it really brings it
[1:04:47] out a little bit we are not obligated to
[1:04:49] our carnal nature if someone in our
[1:04:52] lives had in our family has had a temper
[1:04:54] or someone has maybe had a a
[1:04:58] what would you call it a genetic defect
[1:05:00] where that person in the family maybe a
[1:05:02] grandfather a grandmother or an aunt an
[1:05:05] uncle a mother or father has something
[1:05:07] where they've had cancer in their body
[1:05:08] that's that's what the devil wants us to
[1:05:10] say well we've got this carnal nature
[1:05:12] and we're just stuck with it and we're
[1:05:14] going to have to deal with it and if we
[1:05:16] say it that way then we will be
[1:05:19] but we're not obligated to our carnal
[1:05:21] nature brothers and sisters that's what
[1:05:23] I want to point out we are not obligated
[1:05:26] to our carnal nature it says to live a
[1:05:28] life ruled by the standard set up by the
[1:05:32] dictates of our flesh
[1:05:35] but this whole entire world is set up
[1:05:37] exactly that way
[1:05:39] that we will live according to the
[1:05:40] dictates of our flesh
[1:05:43] I knew somebody once who who was living
[1:05:45] a relatively normal life
[1:05:47] and they discovered that they had
[1:05:51] been diagnosed with something they they
[1:05:52] weren't feeling right one day and and
[1:05:54] they they went and got diagnosed and it
[1:05:58] it was a disease that wasn't
[1:06:01] life-threatening disease
[1:06:04] but certainly slightly life-altering
[1:06:07] and and they told me about it and they
[1:06:09] were really really shaken up by it
[1:06:11] because it's not a good thing to get a
[1:06:12] diagnosis from a doctor is it I mean
[1:06:14] especially a bad one I don't want to I
[1:06:16] don't want to say that it's easy and you
[1:06:18] know it's just been a bed of roses for
[1:06:20] me so I can I can say physically I have
[1:06:23] never had that terrible thing given to
[1:06:25] me so you know it's pretty easy to talk
[1:06:27] I understand that but but this this
[1:06:30] fellow he said to me had this diagnosis
[1:06:31] from the doctor and I said to him you
[1:06:33] know you don't have to embrace it
[1:06:36] you don't have to say I'm going to
[1:06:38] wholeheartedly accept it and then just
[1:06:40] make it mine you can say maybe that's
[1:06:44] what the doctor said but I just don't
[1:06:46] know if I believe it or not and I'm not
[1:06:48] willing to accept it to be the end-all
[1:06:51] in my life
[1:06:54] but they didn't listen to me not that
[1:06:56] they would maybe they shouldn't I'm not
[1:06:58] saying that I'm Authority on anything
[1:07:00] but just sadly they embraced it
[1:07:04] and their life has spiraled to a place
[1:07:06] now where they're afraid to even just go
[1:07:07] out out of their house because they're
[1:07:10] afraid they'll get sick whereas just
[1:07:12] before they were going out and they were
[1:07:14] functioning in society but now they're
[1:07:16] shut in
[1:07:17] and it's really sad to see
[1:07:20] but I just think we have the ability to
[1:07:23] accept the word or to reject the word
[1:07:25] that's really what it comes down to and
[1:07:27] we will we will project what's in our
[1:07:30] lives what's in our hearts whether we
[1:07:32] speak it or whether we just live it it's
[1:07:34] going to come out we can't hide it
[1:07:38] so then brethren we are debtors not to
[1:07:40] the flesh we are not obligated to our
[1:07:42] carnal nature to live a life ruled by
[1:07:45] the standards set up by the dictates of
[1:07:48] the flesh
[1:07:50] I just think it's such an amazing thing
[1:07:52] and my goal tonight brothers and sisters
[1:07:55] I believe the whole entire desire is to
[1:07:57] just encourage us to not look at this
[1:07:59] world
[1:08:00] let's look at the word of God and the
[1:08:02] promise that waits for us that New
[1:08:04] Jerusalem City for the Believers let's
[1:08:06] not get fussed on the little details and
[1:08:08] and the little problems the issues that
[1:08:10] are in our lives remember uh was it is
[1:08:13] it is it is it brother Gary Walker I
[1:08:15] think he's the one that said it when
[1:08:17] when he got that Revelation in his life
[1:08:19] if he were to go on the other side what
[1:08:21] would what would he say it would be
[1:08:22] worth at all
[1:08:24] all of the struggle that he had to go
[1:08:25] through from that car accident and all
[1:08:27] the rehabilitation and all the setbacks
[1:08:29] and all the problems he said if he had
[1:08:32] to go through this all and and he was on
[1:08:34] the other side looking back he would say
[1:08:35] it was worth every single bit of it and
[1:08:37] the struggles that we go through in our
[1:08:39] lives are for a purpose it's to bring
[1:08:41] out the the example of his life in us
[1:08:44] and and I think that we all have the
[1:08:46] opportunity to express that and that's
[1:08:48] why we're here tonight that's why we're
[1:08:50] here in this world
[1:08:52] you know in in uh bear with me for a
[1:08:56] second here I've got some quotes I
[1:08:58] always do God's provided place of
[1:09:00] worship in 1965.
[1:09:04] brother he says and in the First
[1:09:06] Corinthians 12 it said by one Spirit
[1:09:08] we're all baptized into one body
[1:09:11] now after you're in this body Romans 8 1
[1:09:14] said there's therefore now no
[1:09:15] condemnation
[1:09:17] to them that are in Christ Jesus that
[1:09:19] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:09:21] spirit there is the place where there is
[1:09:24] no condemnation
[1:09:26] and I think this is just so beautiful
[1:09:28] because it can draw every one of us
[1:09:30] together I know we all come from
[1:09:31] different backgrounds different places
[1:09:32] geographically different churches
[1:09:34] sometimes it's even different it's
[1:09:36] different different beliefs around the
[1:09:38] message of the hour
[1:09:41] but we're not interested in looking at
[1:09:42] that and I wouldn't recommend looking at
[1:09:45] that in anyone I I would look beyond
[1:09:47] that into the heart of the person and
[1:09:49] see how they believe the word of God
[1:09:51] brother Bradham he says there is the
[1:09:53] place where there is no condemnation
[1:09:56] whether you go to a Methodist Baptist
[1:09:59] Presbyterian Church wherever it is if
[1:10:02] you are in Christ
[1:10:04] you are a new creature
[1:10:06] and there is no condemnation in you
[1:10:09] nowhere at all
[1:10:11] can you believe that does it feel like
[1:10:12] that in our lives there's no
[1:10:14] condemnation anywhere at all I don't
[1:10:16] know maybe someone has that feeling but
[1:10:19] I sure don't feel that
[1:10:20] just being honest I think it's amazing
[1:10:23] because that's what the word of God says
[1:10:25] that's what the prophet of God said
[1:10:27] that's what God said to us through the
[1:10:28] prophet if you are in Christ you are a
[1:10:31] new creature and there is no
[1:10:32] condemnation in you nowhere at all
[1:10:35] that's God's meeting place that's where
[1:10:38] God meets the worshiper isn't that
[1:10:40] interesting that's not where the
[1:10:41] worshiper meets God that's where God
[1:10:43] comes and meets the worshiper there is
[1:10:46] where you are accounted a new creature
[1:10:49] for they're dead to the things of the
[1:10:51] world they're alive in him the presence
[1:10:54] of God is with them day by day
[1:10:59] I just think it's so beautiful
[1:11:01] that's why I'm reading it I hope it's
[1:11:03] okay tonight paragraph 101 he lives in
[1:11:06] them through every age every age that's
[1:11:08] come along down through the Bible where
[1:11:11] Man meets God's requirement
[1:11:14] what's God's requirement for today
[1:11:16] brothers and sisters only believe
[1:11:19] and when you believe you'll get baptized
[1:11:21] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:11:24] the remission of your sins then you
[1:11:25] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:27] and all of this just becomes a wide open
[1:11:30] brand new book to us doesn't it
[1:11:32] he lives in them through every age this
[1:11:35] age included I think is what really
[1:11:37] spoke to me here every age that's come
[1:11:39] along down through the Bible when a man
[1:11:41] meets God's requirement comes into the
[1:11:43] place where to where he provided in his
[1:11:46] written word for that day God makes that
[1:11:50] person to be a new creature
[1:11:53] and he has no condemnation look at job
[1:11:57] my goodness he says am I deafening you
[1:12:02] the way that I'm in these mics and I I'm
[1:12:05] sorry about it I want to say the same
[1:12:06] thing too it just gets me excited when I
[1:12:08] I read this myself I I know it's the
[1:12:11] rebound in here I hear it in here myself
[1:12:13] he says but look job regardless of how
[1:12:16] many people tried to condemn him how
[1:12:18] many said he was wrong he was keeping
[1:12:21] the Commandment of God by that burnt
[1:12:24] offering I'm not going into the story of
[1:12:26] job tonight but I just want to remind us
[1:12:28] that that was all he had to do was not
[1:12:30] move from his sacrifice to not move from
[1:12:33] his position not say that oh my my house
[1:12:36] is gone and my children are gone and my
[1:12:38] business is gone and now I've got to
[1:12:39] move away because somehow something has
[1:12:41] happened in my life and I just I just
[1:12:43] don't know what to do he stayed right
[1:12:45] there and what did he do he gave God
[1:12:47] something to honor with that he knowed
[1:12:49] he was justified because he was keeping
[1:12:51] the Commandments of God that's how he
[1:12:54] was justified because he was doing the
[1:12:56] things that God wanted him to do now
[1:12:58] what I'm saying by him staying right
[1:13:00] there is nothing moved him from his
[1:13:03] ultimate belief in the word of God
[1:13:05] whether we move from Calgary to another
[1:13:07] location that's not what I'm saying we
[1:13:09] didn't move off of our Ash Heap is what
[1:13:12] job did he stayed right there where he
[1:13:14] had offered that sacrifice we stay right
[1:13:17] where we believe the word of God nobody
[1:13:19] will ever be able to tell us that God is
[1:13:21] not real that the message of the hour
[1:13:22] isn't truly sent to us from God
[1:13:28] I just think it's amazing verse 13 for
[1:13:31] if you live after the flesh he shall die
[1:13:34] but if ye through the spirit
[1:13:36] do you mortify the Deeds of the body ye
[1:13:39] shall live Romans 8 13.
[1:13:42] if you live after the flesh he shall die
[1:13:45] you know like they say if you live by
[1:13:47] the gun you'll die by the gun if you
[1:13:49] live by the sword you'll die by the
[1:13:50] sword
[1:13:51] if you live by the flesh you'll die by
[1:13:53] the flesh you're busy looking at other
[1:13:55] people's flesh all their behaviors and
[1:13:59] all their problems and all the churches
[1:14:01] and all their behaviors and all their
[1:14:02] problems and the deacons and the song
[1:14:05] leaders and all the problems the
[1:14:06] problems the problems it's just going to
[1:14:08] be a problem and eventually you're going
[1:14:10] to be a problem
[1:14:12] but if you're looking at the Spirit of
[1:14:15] Christ
[1:14:16] if you're looking at the word of God if
[1:14:19] you're saying you know what I understand
[1:14:21] that if I live after the flesh I'll die
[1:14:23] but but I through the the spirit do
[1:14:27] mortify the Deeds of the body then I
[1:14:30] shall live it gives me the ability to
[1:14:32] recognize I can have Grace for my
[1:14:34] brothers and my sisters I can have Grace
[1:14:36] for the other pastors even the ones that
[1:14:39] I look at and I see that maybe they're
[1:14:41] off the word
[1:14:43] they don't want to be off the word
[1:14:45] they want to earnestly contend for the
[1:14:47] faith that was once delivered for the
[1:14:48] Saints it's not up to me to judge them
[1:14:50] it's up to God to judge them it's up to
[1:14:52] me to have the right response to pray
[1:14:54] for them
[1:14:55] to have Grace for them
[1:14:58] he says we have to have Temptation in
[1:15:02] our lives
[1:15:03] it's healthy for us
[1:15:04] out of who is this Melchizedek 1965.
[1:15:09] he says but you see in order to stand
[1:15:11] temptation
[1:15:13] you had to bypass the theophany
[1:15:16] you had to come down here in flesh
[1:15:20] to be tempted by sin I was reading this
[1:15:23] this afternoon and I thought that's
[1:15:24] amazing
[1:15:26] I don't know if I've ever really thought
[1:15:27] of it that way that I had to come down
[1:15:29] here have you ever thought about that
[1:15:31] you had to come down here
[1:15:33] I I know that I came from Christ before
[1:15:35] the foundation of the world but I've
[1:15:36] always thought about him coming down
[1:15:37] here from heaven right to manifest In
[1:15:40] the Flesh like we talked about on Sunday
[1:15:41] but I never thought about me having to
[1:15:43] come down here
[1:15:45] but I did and so did you
[1:15:47] you had to come down here you had to
[1:15:50] bypass the theophany you had to come
[1:15:52] down here in flesh to be tempted by sin
[1:15:55] Jesus had to come down here
[1:15:58] to be manifest In the Flesh to be
[1:16:01] tempted
[1:16:02] by sin
[1:16:04] and then if you stand
[1:16:06] all the father hath given me will come
[1:16:10] to me
[1:16:11] and I'll raise him up on the last day
[1:16:14] see
[1:16:15] you had to be first and then you see he
[1:16:19] come right down the regular line
[1:16:22] from attribute to before the foundation
[1:16:25] of the world his name is put on the
[1:16:27] Lamb's Book of Life then from that he
[1:16:29] become the word the theophany that could
[1:16:33] appear disappear
[1:16:35] and then he become flesh and returned
[1:16:38] back again
[1:16:39] resurrected that same body in a
[1:16:41] glorified condition so just to recap
[1:16:44] this maybe for those people who don't
[1:16:45] understand it we're talking about him
[1:16:47] being Elohim the self-existing one then
[1:16:50] he comes down in the form of Melchizedek
[1:16:53] he comes down in the form of of those
[1:16:55] three the one plus the two angels that
[1:16:58] went to visit Abram to tell him he had a
[1:17:00] new name just before he went to judge
[1:17:02] Sodom he he came down and and he would
[1:17:05] appear and he would disappear and then
[1:17:08] he came and became flesh he became flesh
[1:17:10] and returned back again resurrected that
[1:17:13] same time that same body in a glorified
[1:17:16] condition as Jesus Christ that's what
[1:17:17] brother Adam was talking about he says
[1:17:19] but you bypass the theophany and become
[1:17:22] flesh man to be tempted by sin
[1:17:27] so Brethren sisters don't think it
[1:17:30] strange
[1:17:31] when we're tempted sore
[1:17:34] recognize that that was what God wanted
[1:17:36] for us
[1:17:38] and it wasn't so that we could be
[1:17:39] destroyed it so that we could overcome
[1:17:42] to set with him in his throne and what
[1:17:44] are we going to overcome we're going to
[1:17:45] overcome sin in the world and Satan and
[1:17:48] all of that but more than anything we're
[1:17:49] going to overcome this guy this flesh
[1:17:52] this flesh is going to give way to his
[1:17:55] spirit and it doesn't I I just think
[1:17:57] it's so amazing and maybe this is the
[1:17:59] point to get to tonight it might not
[1:18:01] give way to his spirit in the way that
[1:18:03] we think
[1:18:04] maybe it's not going to be a splitting
[1:18:06] of the flesh the skin from from top to
[1:18:09] bottom and and suddenly this new
[1:18:11] creature is just going to emerge like
[1:18:13] we're coming out of our old skin and
[1:18:15] going into a new skin and then we're
[1:18:16] just going to slowly rise to the sky
[1:18:18] that's not what's going to happen
[1:18:19] brothers and sisters what's going to
[1:18:20] happen is we're going to be able to say
[1:18:22] Amen to the word and you know what when
[1:18:24] we fall down in our flesh when we have a
[1:18:26] problem with a brother or a sister we're
[1:18:28] gonna go and make that thing right we're
[1:18:30] going to be like David who is a man
[1:18:31] after God's Own Heart and what made him
[1:18:34] that way brother Bradham said he was
[1:18:36] quick to repent
[1:18:37] we're going to be quick to repent when
[1:18:39] we see these traits these attributes
[1:18:41] happening in our lives brothers and
[1:18:43] sisters I believe that gives us the
[1:18:44] ability to recognize the key has gone in
[1:18:47] the lock and it's turned and now it's
[1:18:49] unlocked for us we have the ability to
[1:18:51] recognize that we've already made
[1:18:53] ourselves seated in Heavenly places in
[1:18:56] Christ Jesus when we can believe the
[1:18:58] word of God
[1:19:00] but if we're still questioning it and
[1:19:02] saying hi I don't know look at that
[1:19:04] brother I don't know look at this
[1:19:06] situation or well you know would I have
[1:19:08] this situation if I really believed
[1:19:10] we're not living in the first and second
[1:19:12] poll Ministry of the word of God we're
[1:19:14] living in the third poll why cry speak
[1:19:16] we're living in the third pole Ministry
[1:19:19] of the word the expression the fullness
[1:19:21] of the word now being manifest through
[1:19:23] Mankind and where brothers and sisters
[1:19:26] not some great ministry out there you're
[1:19:28] the great ministry right here in your
[1:19:31] life in in the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:19:34] but you bypass the theophany and become
[1:19:36] flesh man to be tempted by sin and then
[1:19:38] if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved
[1:19:40] we have one already waiting we have not
[1:19:43] yet the bodies but look when this body
[1:19:46] receives the spirit of God The Immortal
[1:19:49] Life inside of you it throws this body
[1:19:52] in subjection to God
[1:19:55] how does it throw this body into
[1:19:57] subjection to God brothers and sisters I
[1:20:00] want to say it clearly it puts us in
[1:20:02] subjection to the word of God that was
[1:20:05] given to this age through the prophet of
[1:20:07] Malachi 4.
[1:20:09] we don't say oh we follow a man we
[1:20:11] follow the word of God because the word
[1:20:12] that came from that man was exactly in
[1:20:15] the line of the word of God it brought
[1:20:17] us back it restored the hearts of the
[1:20:21] children back to the faith of the
[1:20:22] Pentecostal fathers
[1:20:27] he that's born of God does not commit
[1:20:29] sin
[1:20:30] are you born of God tonight
[1:20:33] then you can't even sin brothers and
[1:20:35] sisters
[1:20:36] my
[1:20:37] you can't even sin even if you want to
[1:20:41] it doesn't mean that you go out and and
[1:20:43] rob a bank and you go out and you do all
[1:20:45] these sinful things of course we don't
[1:20:47] want to do that
[1:20:49] but we're talking about being able to
[1:20:50] believe the word of God because unbelief
[1:20:52] is sin
[1:20:54] not believing the word of God is sin and
[1:20:57] and taking and making the message of the
[1:20:59] hour
[1:21:00] comfortable to fit our lives is not
[1:21:03] according to the word of God that's not
[1:21:05] going to make us any better this is
[1:21:07] going to actually challenge us it's
[1:21:08] going to stretch us it's gonna it's
[1:21:10] gonna show who we are but you know we're
[1:21:13] in a place where where there's no time
[1:21:15] for playing
[1:21:16] this is no time for playing Church no
[1:21:19] time to to see whether this is just the
[1:21:22] real thing or not I'm just gonna wait
[1:21:23] and see whether it becomes something
[1:21:25] more than it is or or whether it's of
[1:21:27] God or whether it's not this is no time
[1:21:29] to play Church Brothers and Sisters this
[1:21:31] is the end of all time this is the end
[1:21:33] of all ages you can talk to anybody in
[1:21:34] this world and they'll say yeah this
[1:21:36] world can't stay the way it is it's
[1:21:38] about to blow up and maybe not in in
[1:21:40] terms of nuclear bombs I don't know I
[1:21:42] don't want to say it that way but maybe
[1:21:44] civil unrest look at the way the
[1:21:45] governments are look at how people
[1:21:47] everyone's got an opinion now and it
[1:21:49] doesn't matter they have the right to
[1:21:51] voice it it wasn't very long ago where
[1:21:53] you had to have respect for the
[1:21:55] government where you had to have respect
[1:21:57] for your elders but now teachers will
[1:22:00] get in trouble for saying the wrong
[1:22:01] thing
[1:22:03] teachers will get fired for saying the
[1:22:05] wrong thing
[1:22:07] defund the police
[1:22:10] where did all this lack of respect come
[1:22:11] from this world is not our home brothers
[1:22:14] and sisters this world is on the brink
[1:22:16] of something really significant
[1:22:19] and I think it's so beautiful I want to
[1:22:20] say this I had this this this thought in
[1:22:23] the back room tonight you know it's
[1:22:24] terribly dark as this world is brothers
[1:22:27] and sisters it's going that way for one
[1:22:29] reason and that reason is to show how
[1:22:31] bright you're burning to show how bright
[1:22:33] that Pillar of Fire is in his elect Lady
[1:22:36] it's not so that we can be drowned out
[1:22:38] and smothered out it's so that we can
[1:22:40] show really who we are and nice and
[1:22:43] bright
[1:22:44] it throws this body into subjection to
[1:22:46] God hallelujah he that's born of God
[1:22:49] does not commit sin he cannot sin there
[1:22:52] is therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:22:55] who are in Christ them that are in
[1:22:57] Christ Jesus they walk not after the
[1:22:59] flesh but after the spirit there you are
[1:23:01] see that throws your body subject
[1:23:05] you don't have to say oh if I could just
[1:23:07] quit drinking
[1:23:09] if I could just
[1:23:11] he says just get in Christ
[1:23:13] and it's all gone see
[1:23:15] because your body is subject to the
[1:23:18] spirit it's no more subject to the
[1:23:20] things of the world they're dead
[1:23:22] they are dead
[1:23:24] your sins are buried in baptism
[1:23:27] and that's why we get baptized as an
[1:23:29] outward expression of the inward work of
[1:23:32] of the belief that it's not to be
[1:23:34] baptized in the name of the father
[1:23:35] that's on the Holy Ghost who is the
[1:23:37] father
[1:23:37] there's no name there and who's the son
[1:23:39] there's no name there it's not getting a
[1:23:41] trinitarian baptism it's getting
[1:23:42] baptized in Christian baptism according
[1:23:44] to Acts 2 38 which was restored unto the
[1:23:47] church which causes the children's
[1:23:48] Hearts to be drawn back to the faith of
[1:23:51] the Pentecostal fathers to say wow
[1:23:52] that's been laying there in plain sight
[1:23:54] all day long we know brother Branham
[1:23:55] says it in the church H book it's in
[1:23:57] plain sight you don't have to get a
[1:23:58] revelation about water baptism
[1:24:00] it's right there
[1:24:03] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:24:05] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:24:07] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he
[1:24:08] says they're dead your sins are buried
[1:24:10] in baptism and you are a new creation in
[1:24:12] Christ and your body becoming subject to
[1:24:15] the spirit try to live a right kind of
[1:24:18] life
[1:24:19] many times we're going to fall down our
[1:24:21] theophonies will live a perfect life
[1:24:23] our theophanes are already living a
[1:24:25] perfect life before God right now in
[1:24:27] another dimension which is just right
[1:24:29] here the theophanes are already perfect
[1:24:31] we can't try and get these bodies to be
[1:24:34] a theophany body
[1:24:35] we we can't try and be an angel and live
[1:24:37] as an angel
[1:24:39] we're Sons and Daughters of God living
[1:24:40] in the Fallen condition we're not going
[1:24:42] to make Grace a disgrace but we're
[1:24:45] always going to bring these bodies back
[1:24:46] into subjection of the word of God
[1:24:49] that's the difference between a Believer
[1:24:51] and an unbeliever an unbeliever is going
[1:24:53] to say I don't know I don't know I can't
[1:24:55] live it and that's what the believer
[1:24:56] says no you can't and neither can I but
[1:24:59] his spirit that lives within me he can
[1:25:01] and I will always come subject to the
[1:25:03] word of God
[1:25:07] I think it's beautiful if you have your
[1:25:09] Bibles tonight maybe turn with me over
[1:25:10] to Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:25:13] still have
[1:25:15] a little bit of time
[1:25:16] a little bit of time
[1:25:19] I just want to get this across tonight I
[1:25:21] think it's the main theme the main point
[1:25:23] many times I wonder if this makes sense
[1:25:25] when I put it together like Lord does it
[1:25:27] really make sense
[1:25:30] Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:25:33] verses 6. verse 6.
[1:25:37] we need to remember this
[1:25:40] as we go
[1:25:42] but without faith it is impossible to
[1:25:45] please him
[1:25:48] we have to have faith brothers and
[1:25:49] sisters
[1:25:51] without faith
[1:25:53] it's impossible to please him for he
[1:25:55] that cometh to God
[1:25:57] must believe that he is
[1:26:03] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:26:05] diligently seek him
[1:26:11] not he will be
[1:26:14] or he was
[1:26:16] but that he is present tense
[1:26:20] I am
[1:26:22] and you know I'm no grammar
[1:26:25] person here I
[1:26:27] I don't know much but I just think what
[1:26:29] brother Branham says he says watch those
[1:26:31] pronouns
[1:26:32] and and I know this isn't even a pronoun
[1:26:34] and I don't think but just that he is it
[1:26:37] makes it present tense some of these
[1:26:39] things are just so minor and so small we
[1:26:41] can just easily gloss over and read over
[1:26:43] it and it's just like yeah you know he
[1:26:45] is you know something else but it's not
[1:26:48] saying that he is
[1:26:50] he is God he's not saying he is Jesus
[1:26:54] he's not saying he is theophany he is
[1:26:57] the great one he is
[1:27:00] and a comma
[1:27:02] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:27:05] diligently seek him
[1:27:07] we have the ability to recognize that
[1:27:09] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:27:10] him and and we we have been given the
[1:27:14] ability to stand in our day which I
[1:27:16] think is is incredible because we get
[1:27:18] the fact that he is and for many people
[1:27:20] he's probably saying Brother Bear you
[1:27:22] just keep harping about that but I just
[1:27:24] think it's so important let's just go on
[1:27:26] let's skip down to verse eight I don't
[1:27:28] want to go off on a tangent about Noah
[1:27:30] and I will if I read verse seven that's
[1:27:31] the only reason I don't want to read it
[1:27:33] I don't want to delete any of the words
[1:27:35] so I'm not doing that I just want to
[1:27:36] stick with the faith of Abraham verse 8
[1:27:39] says by a by faith Abraham when he was
[1:27:41] called to go into a place which he
[1:27:44] should after receive for an inheritance
[1:27:47] obeyed
[1:27:49] and he went out not knowing whether he
[1:27:53] went
[1:27:54] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[1:27:56] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[1:27:59] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[1:28:01] Heirs with him of the same promise
[1:28:05] for he looked for a city which hath
[1:28:07] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[1:28:09] God
[1:28:10] and through faith also Sarah herself
[1:28:14] received strength to conceive seed and
[1:28:17] when was delivered of a child when she
[1:28:19] was past age because she judged him
[1:28:22] faithful who had promised
[1:28:25] now this just struck me this afternoon
[1:28:28] isn't this the one
[1:28:30] Sarah the one that would have been
[1:28:32] destroyed
[1:28:33] if she wasn't a part of Abram Abraham
[1:28:36] isn't this the one that laughed up her
[1:28:38] sleeve
[1:28:39] when she heard God actually saying that
[1:28:42] to Abraham through the sidewall of the
[1:28:44] tent I'm going to visit you according to
[1:28:46] the time of life isn't she the one his
[1:28:48] wife that laughed at that statement how
[1:28:50] could I have pleasure with my Lord being
[1:28:52] past age how could that possibly be this
[1:28:54] is the one that laughed but she had
[1:28:58] judged him faithful who had promised
[1:29:04] doesn't say that Abraham
[1:29:07] had faith it says that she judged him
[1:29:10] faithful who had promise I think there's
[1:29:12] so much in here that we could unpack she
[1:29:15] believed her husband
[1:29:16] she believed her Lord not calling her
[1:29:19] husband Lord even though I believe she
[1:29:21] did but she believed the Lord she had
[1:29:23] faith
[1:29:26] how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:29:28] brothers and sisters
[1:29:30] faith that these bodies will lie to us
[1:29:33] these bodies will deceive us these
[1:29:36] bodies are not the final answer
[1:29:39] so we need to be very very very very
[1:29:41] careful how we look at ourselves and how
[1:29:43] we look at others because it's not this
[1:29:46] body it's not this flesh that we're
[1:29:48] going to be judged by it's going to be
[1:29:50] by the spirit that's inside this body in
[1:29:52] this flesh that we can't even see
[1:29:58] Romans chapter 4 verse 20 he staggered
[1:30:00] not at the promise of God through
[1:30:02] unbelief
[1:30:03] talking about Abraham but was strong in
[1:30:06] faith giving glory to God maybe oh am I
[1:30:10] on the right part here
[1:30:12] yeah let's turn there let's turn to
[1:30:14] Romans chapter 4.
[1:30:16] we got to do it we still got a little
[1:30:18] bit of time
[1:30:20] I hope it's okay
[1:30:22] Romans chapter 4
[1:30:26] . sometimes I think it's just really
[1:30:28] important to take some time and dwell on
[1:30:30] things and I think this is one that
[1:30:31] really is important for us to just
[1:30:33] recognize that the heroes in the Bible
[1:30:35] were people just like us
[1:30:38] they were no different
[1:30:41] they had flash problems we know that
[1:30:43] Abraham what did he do
[1:30:45] he he went down brother Bradham says as
[1:30:48] a backslider into Egypt
[1:30:50] and said to his wife just say that
[1:30:52] you're my sister so he could save his
[1:30:54] hide didn't he
[1:30:56] but for the grace of God to come in the
[1:30:58] form of a dream to the king and didn't
[1:31:00] this happen twice
[1:31:03] he comes in the form of a dream and
[1:31:06] tells the King give him his wife back
[1:31:07] and if you don't do it you're going to
[1:31:09] be a dead man your kingdom will be taken
[1:31:12] from you and the King says Lord you know
[1:31:14] the Integrity of my heart and he says
[1:31:16] yeah I know that's why I'm telling you
[1:31:19] but what is it here we have a king in
[1:31:21] Egypt saying to God you know the
[1:31:23] Integrity of my heart don't they believe
[1:31:25] idols and follow false gods how does
[1:31:28] that work
[1:31:29] that's where I say brothers and sisters
[1:31:31] we can't put God in a box and say that
[1:31:33] unless you believe it the way that I
[1:31:35] believe it or the way that I think I
[1:31:36] believe it that's the way it is
[1:31:39] this is a king in Egypt
[1:31:42] I don't know where that came from but
[1:31:43] anyways we we I do no sorry forgive me
[1:31:47] Lord Hebrew Romans chapter chapter 4
[1:31:50] Romans chapter 4 verse 1.
[1:31:54] what shall we say then that Abraham Our
[1:31:58] Father
[1:31:58] as pertaining to the flesh hath found
[1:32:02] for If Abraham was justified by works
[1:32:06] he hath whereof took Glory
[1:32:09] but not before God
[1:32:12] but what saith the scripture Abraham
[1:32:14] believed God and it was counted unto him
[1:32:16] for righteousness
[1:32:18] now to him that worketh is the reward
[1:32:21] not reckoned of Grace but of debt
[1:32:26] but to him that worketh not
[1:32:28] but believeth on him that justifieth the
[1:32:32] ungodly
[1:32:34] his faith is counted for righteousness
[1:32:37] this is excuse me this is separating law
[1:32:40] and Grace right there
[1:32:41] if we're thinking that our works of
[1:32:43] righteousness are going to do it
[1:32:45] we can read this word here and we can
[1:32:46] recognize our works of righteousness are
[1:32:48] not going to do it being a legalist is
[1:32:50] not going to do it
[1:32:52] having everything in our lives perfect
[1:32:53] is not going to do it but having the
[1:32:56] ability to understand but to him that
[1:32:59] worketh not I just believe on him that
[1:33:02] justifieth the ungodly because I know
[1:33:05] outside of his Spirit living inside of
[1:33:07] me I would be ungodly but for the grace
[1:33:09] of God there go I when we look at people
[1:33:12] in this world we need to make sure that
[1:33:14] we remember that outside of the grace of
[1:33:16] God we would be ranked Sinners also
[1:33:20] but to him that worketh not but
[1:33:22] believeth on him that justifieth the
[1:33:24] ungodly his faith is counted for
[1:33:26] righteousness
[1:33:27] even as David David also describeth the
[1:33:31] blessedness blessedness of the man unto
[1:33:35] whom God imputeth righteousness
[1:33:38] without works saying blessed are they
[1:33:41] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[1:33:43] sins are covered
[1:33:45] blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[1:33:48] not impute sin
[1:33:51] cometh this blessedness blessedness then
[1:33:55] upon the circumcision only or upon the
[1:33:58] uncircumcision also for we say that
[1:34:01] Faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[1:34:04] righteousness
[1:34:06] how was it then reckoned
[1:34:09] when he was in the circumcision or in
[1:34:11] the uncircumcision we know that that was
[1:34:13] given as a sign
[1:34:15] for the Sons and Daughters of God for
[1:34:17] the Israelis for the Hebrews
[1:34:19] in their flesh it was a sign of the
[1:34:21] flesh not in circumcision but in
[1:34:23] uncircumcision
[1:34:25] he that received the sign of
[1:34:27] circumcision a seal of the righteousness
[1:34:29] of the faith which he had yet being
[1:34:33] uncircumcised that he might be the
[1:34:36] father of all them that believe though
[1:34:39] they be not circumcised that
[1:34:41] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[1:34:44] also
[1:34:46] and the father of circumcision to them
[1:34:48] who are not of the circumcision only but
[1:34:51] who also walk in the steps of that Faith
[1:34:55] of Our Father Abraham
[1:34:57] which had being yet uncircumcised for
[1:35:01] the promise that he should be heir of
[1:35:04] the world was not to Abraham or to his
[1:35:08] seed through the law
[1:35:11] but through the righteousness of faith
[1:35:16] for if they which are of the law be
[1:35:19] heirs
[1:35:21] faith is made void
[1:35:24] and the promise made of none effect
[1:35:27] because the law worketh Wrath
[1:35:30] for where no law is there is no
[1:35:33] transgression
[1:35:35] therefore it is of faith
[1:35:38] that it might be by grace to the end the
[1:35:42] promise might be sure to all the seed
[1:35:46] not
[1:35:49] not to that only which is of the law
[1:35:52] but to that also which is of the faith
[1:35:56] of Abraham who is the father of us all
[1:36:03] I just want to uh
[1:36:06] yeah we have to keep going I apologize
[1:36:08] this is so long but as it is written
[1:36:11] verse 17 I have made thee a father of
[1:36:13] many nations before him whom he believed
[1:36:17] even God who quickeneth the dead and
[1:36:21] calleth those things which be not as
[1:36:24] though they were
[1:36:27] who against hope believed in Hope
[1:36:31] that he might become the father of many
[1:36:34] nations according to that which was
[1:36:36] spoken so shall thy seed be and being
[1:36:39] not weak in faith he considered not his
[1:36:42] own body now dead when he was about a
[1:36:45] hundred years old
[1:36:47] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:36:52] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:36:54] through unbelief
[1:36:56] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[1:36:59] God
[1:37:02] and being fully persuaded that what he
[1:37:05] had promised
[1:37:07] he was able to perform
[1:37:10] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[1:37:13] righteousness
[1:37:15] now it was not written for his sake
[1:37:18] alone
[1:37:19] that it was imputed to him
[1:37:23] but for us also
[1:37:25] to whom it shall be imputed if we
[1:37:27] believe on him that raised up Jesus our
[1:37:30] lord from the dead
[1:37:32] who was delivered for our offenses and
[1:37:36] was raised again for our justification
[1:37:40] remember in the in the invisible Union
[1:37:43] of the Bride of Jesus Christ brother
[1:37:44] Bradham says in 1965 that you are
[1:37:47] already Justified
[1:37:49] you're Justified and he says it's like
[1:37:52] you never even did it and he says that
[1:37:55] but then he goes on to say a little
[1:37:57] further that you actually never did do
[1:38:00] it if you believe this word of God
[1:38:03] because he doesn't look at us in this
[1:38:05] flesh he doesn't look at us in this
[1:38:06] condition and we know that we have
[1:38:08] Romans 4 talking here about Abraham he
[1:38:12] he had been a follower of the word of
[1:38:13] God and he followed the the steps that
[1:38:16] God had given him the leadership of the
[1:38:18] Lord in his life and there was the love
[1:38:19] of of the uncircumcision versus the law
[1:38:22] of circumcision and and all of the steps
[1:38:25] in the law but then he comes further
[1:38:27] down and he says that he staggered not
[1:38:29] at the promise of God through unbelief
[1:38:31] but was strong and faith-giving glory to
[1:38:33] God I just think verse 21 really applies
[1:38:36] to us also as the spiritual seed the
[1:38:39] Royal Seed of Abraham and being fully
[1:38:42] persuaded that what he had promised
[1:38:45] not what what we had promised or maybe
[1:38:47] someone in this flesh in our lives had
[1:38:49] promised because everyone in this world
[1:38:52] will disappoint us
[1:38:54] but being fully persuaded that what he
[1:38:57] had promised God Elohim the one he met
[1:38:59] in the tent door that Day In the Heat of
[1:39:01] the day what he had promised he was able
[1:39:05] also to perform and because he was fully
[1:39:09] persuaded it was therefore imputed to
[1:39:12] him for righteousness
[1:39:15] he never even sinned in his life even
[1:39:17] though the we know the word says that he
[1:39:19] was a backslaughter he went down into
[1:39:20] Egypt he gave away his wife to try and
[1:39:22] save his his height just tell him you're
[1:39:24] my sister we know that he backslid many
[1:39:26] different ways but when the true test
[1:39:28] came when he was given that promise we
[1:39:30] know brother Brown even talks about it
[1:39:31] his wife said you know what it's not
[1:39:33] happening honey we'll just do it our way
[1:39:35] here take my solution I've got a
[1:39:37] solution take Hagar you can you can
[1:39:39] still have that child but I'll make it
[1:39:41] come to pass and we know that brother
[1:39:43] Branham he said it very clearly the word
[1:39:44] of God says it very clearly God said no
[1:39:46] that's not the way it's going to come to
[1:39:47] pass you can go ahead and do it but I'm
[1:39:49] not going to count it to you as
[1:39:51] unrighteousness you're going to have
[1:39:52] some trouble in your house you're going
[1:39:54] to have some problems in your life
[1:39:55] because you didn't follow my word holy
[1:39:57] but I'm not going to hold it against you
[1:39:59] you're going to reap the rewards from it
[1:40:01] you're planting a harvest and you're
[1:40:02] going to see a problem from it
[1:40:05] but he was fully persuaded that what he
[1:40:08] was he had promised God had promised him
[1:40:10] he was able to perform it it wasn't up
[1:40:12] to Abraham to perform it
[1:40:16] I just think it's so beautiful because
[1:40:18] how many times Naturally Speaking did he
[1:40:20] stagger brothers and sisters how many
[1:40:21] times in our lives Naturally Speaking do
[1:40:23] we stagger brothers and sisters how many
[1:40:25] times do we fall down and flat on our
[1:40:27] face how many times and the devil will
[1:40:29] say oh is it really real because if it
[1:40:31] was really real would you have fallen on
[1:40:32] your face yes you would have it's
[1:40:34] because you have to overcome that thing
[1:40:36] and get back up again and that's the
[1:40:38] difference between the Believers and the
[1:40:40] people who haven't really come to that
[1:40:42] maturity level yet the Believers the
[1:40:44] true seasoned Believers get back up
[1:40:46] again and that's why I keep saying about
[1:40:48] the the elders how they come to church
[1:40:49] and they look perfect they've got no
[1:40:51] problems in their lives you know what it
[1:40:53] is they've learned to get back up again
[1:40:55] that's all it is that's why they come to
[1:40:58] church that's why we drag our carcasses
[1:41:00] into church we get back up again we
[1:41:02] don't stay down and say I can never make
[1:41:05] it I can't live it no one can on their
[1:41:07] own but boy if the same spirit that
[1:41:10] raised Jesus Christ up from the dead if
[1:41:12] it dwells in you oh my something
[1:41:15] different happens in your life you're
[1:41:16] able to forgive your brother you're able
[1:41:18] to be forgiven you are able to get back
[1:41:21] up again and come to church
[1:41:23] we don't quit Believers don't quit I
[1:41:26] just think it's beautiful though he
[1:41:28] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:41:29] through unbelief that is the sin
[1:41:31] brothers and sisters unbelief but he was
[1:41:35] fully persuaded wasn't he that he was
[1:41:37] able to deliver what he promised
[1:41:41] are you able to believe that he is able
[1:41:44] to deliver what he promised in this life
[1:41:47] that we are more than Overcomers
[1:41:50] more than conquerors that we will sit
[1:41:53] with him in his throne we don't have to
[1:41:54] tolerate the devil and his tactics and
[1:41:56] his Antics we don't have to listen to
[1:41:58] his voice
[1:41:59] just brothers and sisters be fully
[1:42:01] persuaded that what he promised he's
[1:42:04] able to perform it in your lives
[1:42:08] if we have confusion in our lives he is
[1:42:11] not the author of confusion
[1:42:14] if we have sickness in our lives it's
[1:42:16] not because God gave us sickness it's
[1:42:19] because Satan gave us sickness but what
[1:42:21] we started out with at the beginning is
[1:42:23] if if Satan has these laws in this flesh
[1:42:25] how much more the spirit of God that
[1:42:28] raised up Jesus Christ from the dead
[1:42:29] when he dwells in our mortal bodies how
[1:42:32] much more does his Spirit have in our
[1:42:35] our bodies how much more does his law
[1:42:37] have in our lives I think it's so
[1:42:39] beautiful you know he didn't stumble him
[1:42:41] a bit the stuff didn't stumble Abraham a
[1:42:44] bit and works as Faith expressed two
[1:42:46] main paragraph 218. he says let's think
[1:42:49] of Abraham for just a few minutes
[1:42:50] Abraham got that Holy Union
[1:42:54] incomplete see
[1:42:56] he got the whole thing together he
[1:42:58] called things contrary to his faith as
[1:43:02] though it was not
[1:43:05] do we do that are we able to do that
[1:43:07] brothers and sisters we see things in
[1:43:09] our lives we see them with our eyes we
[1:43:11] perceive them with our senses we hear
[1:43:13] things with our ears are we able to say
[1:43:15] ah that brother that sister they didn't
[1:43:17] mean that
[1:43:18] that problem that's in front of our eyes
[1:43:21] we we don't see that it's not the way
[1:43:24] that we see it it's not the way that we
[1:43:26] perceive it with these senses in these
[1:43:28] bodies
[1:43:28] let's think of Abraham for just a few
[1:43:30] minutes Abraham got that Holy Union
[1:43:32] incomplete see he got that whole thing
[1:43:34] together he called the things contrary
[1:43:36] to his faith as though it was not and
[1:43:39] acted on the same principle
[1:43:43] because it's one thing to talk talks
[1:43:44] cheap isn't it
[1:43:46] but when we've got to act
[1:43:50] he says I can imagine
[1:43:52] after about 20 years somebody come by
[1:43:54] and said father of Nations
[1:43:57] Abram you said your name was Abraham
[1:44:00] which means father of Nations
[1:44:03] just how many children do you have right
[1:44:05] now Abraham see
[1:44:08] and you know what alls he could do is
[1:44:10] say yep you're right naturally speaking
[1:44:11] but I know whom whom I have believed and
[1:44:14] and that he is able to keep that which
[1:44:18] he had promised unto me I know I heard
[1:44:20] his voice you might not have heard it
[1:44:22] but I heard it and that's all that
[1:44:23] matters
[1:44:26] and once we've actually been able to
[1:44:27] hear his voice that way Brothers it
[1:44:28] doesn't matter who comes along doesn't
[1:44:30] matter what comes along and I want to be
[1:44:32] clear I'm not saying that I'm going to
[1:44:34] make a a statement to say that you know
[1:44:36] what you should call your sickness you
[1:44:38] don't have a sickness and you shouldn't
[1:44:40] go and see a doctor
[1:44:41] and especially as a parent when you have
[1:44:43] a child and your child's sick and you
[1:44:45] say no I'm going to call that thing as
[1:44:46] though it's not even there look they're
[1:44:47] perfectly healthy and they're white as a
[1:44:49] ghost and maybe vomiting and they've got
[1:44:51] a fever take your child to the hospital
[1:44:54] God is not afraid to use doctors
[1:44:58] we have to be responsible in our lives
[1:45:00] what I'm saying is we can take things to
[1:45:02] an extreme one way or the other remember
[1:45:04] there's a highway that's going down the
[1:45:06] road but there is a way that is a way of
[1:45:09] Holiness I believe that God will be with
[1:45:11] you even in you even right to the
[1:45:13] hospital with your child and you can say
[1:45:16] Lord direct the doctors direct these
[1:45:18] people help us find the right solution
[1:45:20] and maybe if there's a fever that it
[1:45:22] will leave
[1:45:23] but I will never ever ever be taken on
[1:45:27] record to say don't ever take your
[1:45:28] children to the doctor I would say this
[1:45:30] and I'm not going to say it I'm not
[1:45:32] going to say any more about it let God
[1:45:34] lead you get the Holy Ghost and let him
[1:45:36] lead you God uses doctors
[1:45:40] sometimes I got to be careful we have to
[1:45:42] be careful
[1:45:44] father of Nations Abram you said your
[1:45:47] name was Abraham which means father of
[1:45:49] Nations just how many children do you
[1:45:51] have right now Abram see and all she
[1:45:53] could do is agree with him right but we
[1:45:55] have brother Brown I'm saying this that
[1:45:57] didn't stumble him a bit paragraph 219
[1:46:00] the Bible said he staggered not at the
[1:46:03] word of God through unbelief he went
[1:46:05] right ahead making ready keeping all the
[1:46:07] booties ready and the bird eye and
[1:46:09] everything he was going to have the baby
[1:46:12] that's all God said that does anybody
[1:46:15] know what a bird eye is
[1:46:17] I'd really like to know what a bird eye
[1:46:19] is
[1:46:21] it's a pin
[1:46:24] interesting
[1:46:26] probably for keeping the baby wrapped up
[1:46:29] yeah I've
[1:46:30] always for the diaper
[1:46:32] the bird eye okay thank you I had never
[1:46:36] known what that is I've always wondered
[1:46:37] it
[1:46:38] for time's sake I'm just going to read
[1:46:40] another quote here
[1:46:41] um
[1:46:42] my goodness which one is it I'll even
[1:46:44] call the musicians just so I don't keep
[1:46:46] us here
[1:46:47] proving his word 1965.
[1:46:51] paragraph 66.
[1:46:53] God wants to prove this in us he wants
[1:46:55] to hear our voice he wants us to give
[1:46:58] him the ability to move in our lives and
[1:47:01] if we get caught up in the moment
[1:47:03] brothers and sisters and start calling
[1:47:04] the things that are as though they are
[1:47:06] and the things that aren't as though
[1:47:08] they aren't then that's the way it's
[1:47:09] going to be but if we can start to look
[1:47:11] past what our senses perceive and and
[1:47:14] live like Abraham and stagger not at the
[1:47:16] promise of God
[1:47:18] through unbelief but just be strong and
[1:47:20] say I don't care what anybody says
[1:47:21] because I know who's called me I know
[1:47:23] his voice and he has shown me this very
[1:47:25] clearly then he will move in our lives
[1:47:28] and it might not be today it might not
[1:47:29] be tomorrow it might not be next week it
[1:47:31] might not be a month but it will happen
[1:47:33] it has to happen because it's not up to
[1:47:36] us to bring it to pass and I believe
[1:47:38] when we get to that level when we get to
[1:47:39] that place we recognize that it's never
[1:47:41] going to be us bringing it to pass but
[1:47:44] we can get so wound up thinking there's
[1:47:46] something that we can do to bring it to
[1:47:48] pass and if it doesn't come to pass it
[1:47:50] throws Us in turmoil and then we start
[1:47:52] to question our experience on this very
[1:47:54] word
[1:47:56] don't do it brothers and sisters just
[1:47:58] trust them it's up to him to deliver on
[1:48:00] his promise it's his promise it's not
[1:48:02] ours we never made the promise he made
[1:48:04] the promise hold him to his word and see
[1:48:06] if he won't come on the scene maybe
[1:48:08] stand with me tonight as we close
[1:48:09] paragraph 66 he says the Bible said that
[1:48:13] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[1:48:15] God through unbelief but was strong
[1:48:18] giving praise to God his name was
[1:48:20] changed from Abram to Abraham
[1:48:23] the changing of the name made his name
[1:48:27] father of Nations could you imagine a
[1:48:29] man living with his wife his sweetheart
[1:48:31] that he had lived with her for now for
[1:48:34] all these years and now somewhere in the
[1:48:36] age of 80 years old and his wife 70
[1:48:38] years old and yet without one child or
[1:48:41] any hope of a child yet claimed that he
[1:48:44] was the father of nation he'd be a
[1:48:46] lunatic today wouldn't he
[1:48:48] that's what we would call them crazy
[1:48:51] he says could you imagine the criticism
[1:48:53] of his passing fellow man would say
[1:48:55] father of Nations
[1:48:58] now how many children
[1:48:59] do you have at this time and all the
[1:49:02] criticism he had to go through with
[1:49:05] I believe it can happen in our lives we
[1:49:07] can start to confess something and we
[1:49:09] can if we're not careful as Believers we
[1:49:11] can start to actually have the wrong
[1:49:12] confession for our brothers and sisters
[1:49:15] we want to encourage them to believe the
[1:49:18] word of God but remember it's got to be
[1:49:20] with balance
[1:49:24] but Abraham didn't stagger anywhere at
[1:49:26] all
[1:49:27] of unbelief
[1:49:29] he believed that God was able to perform
[1:49:32] that which he had promised that God
[1:49:36] would prove his word
[1:49:39] no matter how long it took
[1:49:42] and I just want to encourage us this
[1:49:44] this way because if we are the Royal
[1:49:46] Seed of Abraham then we have those Royal
[1:49:49] genetics of Abraham when we look at
[1:49:51] those old Natures those genetics from
[1:49:54] our grandparents and our parents and
[1:49:55] maybe aunts and uncles and we think oh
[1:49:57] no I've got all this stuff it's all
[1:49:59] against me you know what don't look at
[1:50:01] that don't look at the problems look at
[1:50:03] the promise the promise is that you are
[1:50:04] the Royal Seed of Abraham and if you are
[1:50:07] the Royal Seed of Abraham then you've
[1:50:08] got the Royal genetics of Abraham and
[1:50:10] those genetic genes in Abraham said that
[1:50:13] he didn't stagger anywhere at all of
[1:50:15] unbelief he believed that God was able
[1:50:18] to perform that which he had promised
[1:50:20] that God would prove his word no matter
[1:50:22] how long it took but instead of getting
[1:50:24] weaker each time like we are prone to do
[1:50:26] he got stronger all the time if it
[1:50:29] didn't happen today tomorrow it will be
[1:50:32] a greater Miracle because that's one day
[1:50:34] older and that was God that was God in
[1:50:36] Abraham for he knowed that God proved
[1:50:39] all of his words to be so if his
[1:50:41] children and will only take his word so
[1:50:44] he can prove it by you that's the only
[1:50:47] way he can prove his word he wants to
[1:50:50] prove it and it's got to be proved
[1:50:51] through us that's why we've got to have
[1:50:53] problems that's why we've got to have
[1:50:55] circumstances and situations so that he
[1:50:58] can prove his word this is not approving
[1:51:00] his word by the way 1965 I don't know if
[1:51:02] I said that he doesn't prove it to
[1:51:04] unbelievers they can't be proved they
[1:51:07] are unbelievers but it's not two
[1:51:09] unbelievers it's not for unbelievers
[1:51:11] it's to him that belief and if he can
[1:51:15] find someone who will believe his word
[1:51:17] he will prove his word by you
[1:51:21] and sometimes sickness and things happen
[1:51:23] to us that way
[1:51:25] that God can prove himself
[1:51:28] I just want to say tonight brothers and
[1:51:30] sisters let God prove himself
[1:51:32] let him prove himself through you and
[1:51:34] and to you let's just bow in prayer
[1:51:37] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[1:51:39] you for your goodness we thank you for
[1:51:42] your word Lord I pray that tonight we
[1:51:44] could just allow you to prove yourself
[1:51:46] through US father Lord that you could
[1:51:48] prove yourself to us just a little
[1:51:50] further Lord Jesus as we go forwards
[1:51:52] maybe even right now in this moment
[1:51:54] tonight that we would just recognize you
[1:51:57] as the as the as the is as the I am in
[1:52:00] as the present tense I am father that
[1:52:02] there's no no problem that you don't
[1:52:04] know about there's no issue that you're
[1:52:06] not aware of there's no surprise gonna
