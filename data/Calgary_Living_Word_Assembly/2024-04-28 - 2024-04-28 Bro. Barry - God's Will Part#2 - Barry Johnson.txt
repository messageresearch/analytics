morning maybe just make it known unto him by way of an an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer just have one unspoken request we'd like to bring Before the Throne gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for this day we thank you for your goodness and your Tender Mercies to each and every one of us Lord we know that it's only by your grace that we stand and father our hearts ache for those people around us Lord Jesus that just don't have the Liberty that we do we know that many are the afflictions of the righteous but Lord You Deliver Us from them all and father this morning we just want to commit each need made known unto you today by way of an uplift hand the unspoken request father each and every need we just want to ask Lord Jesus that you would sovereignly come on the scene once again and meet the needs according to your will we know that your will is your word and father this morning we pray that your word would have preeminence in our hearts Lord Jesus in our minds father but most of all in our souls Lord Jesus we pray that you would just Lord be the king of kings and Lord of lords of our our our our very beings Lord of our Serv service of our assembly Lord let us recognize you as you are this morning we just want to ask father that you would just do something special for us today Lord that all the Believers that have gathered here today Lord Jesus will not leave this building feeling like they've gathered in vain but Lord that somehow some way you will speak to us one more time father we want to remember those who are traveling Lord those who are not with us today for whatever the reason Lord father we pray that you would be with sister Leah still father Lord Lord we know that she needs a touch from you and the baby we thank you for the answered prayers thus far and Lord we just want to commit the family further into your hands Lord for your glory Lord we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles today I'd just like to read a couple of scriptures one from second Timothy chapter 3 another very familiar one Romans chapter 8 my second Timothy 3 verse 11 persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch and and Antioch at laconium at Lera what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution over in Romans chapter 8 verse 28 Romans 8 verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose amen for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified ified and whom he justified them he also glorified let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord many times we can't even really understand or comprehend this word when we read it so father this morning we just ask Lord that you would break this word open to us fresh once again like a fresh loaf of bread Lord Jesus that we could just sit down and partake of Lord that we could just savor it as we walk with you along the way we just ask that you would bless the reading of your word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated certainly happy to be back in the house of the Lord welcome all the visitors it's funny how some people go away and you think the place is going to be empty and fewer people but it seems the Lord brings more people God richly bless you this morning once again welcome to all the visitors uh just a few announcements we've got a prayer meeting coming up this Thursday May the 2nd the first Thursday of the month May the 26th we'll have a communion service and on uh the 18th we have a men's breakfast coming up at our house and uh I trust it'll be a time of encouragement by the word just for the record this is not a social event it's a time to get together and and reflect and encourage one another by the word just the brothers we all struggle the devil is going about as a roaring lion lion seeking whom he may devour and every one of us have a testimony of how we've overcome the things in our lives and just like the sisters have been doing according to Titus Chapter 2 just like the sisters have been doing according to Titus Chapter 2 we plan to do the same thing according to Titus Chapter 2 if you want to turn over there quickly with me in your Bibles I'll just have a quick discussion about this um we could do a lot of social events and I think they're great they're fun to do we do potlucks and we will have social potlucks at our house through the course of the warmer months but when we get together in in these formats as the sisters according to Titus Chapter 2 um it's a time of encouragement it's about instructing the younger how to actually live as an elder how to live as a mature Christian and unless we teach our children how will they know the word of God says to train them up in the way they should go and it won't depart from them but if we don't train them then how will they know and many times it's interesting because as parents we can tell our children over and over and over the same thing and they won't listen to us they'll think that it's just us saying something to them and then one day the children might come home and say Mom Dad guess what I got this tremendous Revelation somebody said something to me that just it's it's it's it's Earth shattering it changes my perspective on everything and you'll be like oh what is it and and they'll say the same thing that you've been telling them all along and you'll have to say what a sage individual that is what what what a smart person that is God blessed them for their willingness to serve the body but you know that's the way it works that's human nature it's not the fault of the parent and it's not the fault of the child it's just the way humans are sometimes people have the ability to connect with other people in a different way that we can't right that's why there's an instruction for training the younger to be like the older amen but if you just look at you know verse uh Titus Chapter 2 veres 1 to5 I'm not going to read all of it you can when you get home just for time sake but verse 6 to 8 it says young men likewise exhort to be sober minded and that's urge urge self-control verse 7 says in all things showing thyself a pattern of Good Works in Doctrine showing uncorrupt gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you this is about training one another amen and you know what I'll say this maybe I'm in the office of Pastor I'm 52 years old in July there's Brothers here that are older than me and maybe they've got experience that I can learn from I don't claim to be the absolute Christ is the absolute but he uses the body to encourage the body healing comes through the body is what brother bradam taught so that's why we're doing this it's not a social event so just in case anybody is wondering we're trying to operate according to the word of God we want to see everyone be encouraged and uh you know we struggle and if there's a struggle that someone is going through if you confess your faults one to another and pray for one another then what happens then you shall be healed amen but how can you pray for one another if you don't know what your faults are your faults aren't necessarily where you actually go and you make mistakes or maybe you've got a genetic thing in your life maybe you just can't overcome something in your life but the devil wants you to say that you're isolated you're the only person in the world especially in your church that's ever gone through what you're going through nobody else has any clue or idea what kind of feelings or emotions you're feeling or experiencing but that's a lie of the devil because we're all human beings and there's only three Giants that we have to battle right we're not going to preach on that today I just want to say brothers and sisters consider it the the sisters when to get together it's a time of encouragement according to the word of God if we apply the word of God then we can't actually give room to the devil that's right the more we apply the word of God in our lives in our homes in our congregation the less room we give to the devil so we got a men's breakfast coming up May the 18th at our house and like I said it's not social Gathering we're going to get together and we're going to break bread we're going to eat but it's going to be a time of encouragement Lord willing uh we have brother Dale at delodon Sunday June the 2nd he's a pastor from Nigeria he'll be taking the service here on Sunday June the 2nd and Wednesday July 17th we have brother Jack Duff from Florida coming here we're certainly excited to meet up with him he's been on a morning Bible study for uh probably since covid the last four years and uh We've really come to to appreciate his ministry so we're excited to see him here as well are you happy this morning we certainly are excited this last week has been a a a good week it's been a gripping week I think the meetings with brother Nester were just wonderful wonderful meetings long meetings but so packed with nuggets and you know I'm just going to continue to say this um as we go forward it's just seared in me I'm going to remember brother netor for this I know brother mvin talked to us about it when we were actually in uh in in Philippines with him uh a year and a half ago and I believe this is the word you were talking about isn't it brother when we were driving that day we were coming back from a jungle church that we met but ining ganap it's a more perfect description of Justified perfect justification in naring ganap and you know that's the scripture that we read this morning he who was that he did predestinate them he also called and and whom he called them he also Justified and naring ganap uh and whom he justified he's already glorified amen so we're already seated in Heavenly places according to the word of God we just have to try and see ourselves and one another in that place you know out of the saman church age I'm just going to go back to where we were um I guess it was the 14th before brother Nestor came so two weeks ago we were just taking a look at God's Will and uh I just want to do a part two on that today and we probably will have to do a three on it but uh we'll just see what the Lord will do today but out of the samian church age brother bradam he talks about how you know we have to suffer and and there's just no way around that there's no way around the fact that we have to suffer as human beings and especially as believers there's there's no way around that we we read it in the scripture this morning we know that uh in Timothy persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch and and lolium at Lisa what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution and you know as I was studying this it just it just hit me that you know when we talk about persecution it's not necessarily somebody coming and stepping on our toes it's not necessarily someone from a different Church saying you don't believe the same doctrine that I believe so I'm going to persecute you and say that I can't fellowship with you we can't have the right hand of Fellowship it's not about that necessarily either it's about the devil coming and getting inside of our heads and what what more does the devil have what age has the devil ever had more of a foothold Inside the Minds of human beings than this age in which we live in and how he does it is through screens through social through all of the electronic contact that we have we have way less contact humanly and way more screen time as human beings it's not healthy for us myself included I say Lord let me have the spanking too I I know I need it and and you know if we're actually getting chastisement that means that we're actually children because if he wasn't actually chastising us then I think we had ought to maybe have some fear in our lives according to the word of God but you know out of the saman church age brother Bram says the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved is only only in Jesus Christ is only in his word that's the only approval that we have his love is elective we read it in Romans chapter 8 his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and we said this last week how did he say so he said it through the five-fold ministry he said it through the word of God but he didn't come down in in a a a ball of light and speak to us individually and say I love you we've heard it through the office and the administration that he has put in place for us he's told us that he loves us he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself how many has been brought to him this morning he's brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said first off believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his I was going to say Infinite Wisdom he in his wisdom allows to come to pass so when we see suffering when we see Trials Come to Us brothers and sisters it's not because we're being destroyed and you know what it doesn't necessarily mean that we're actually in trouble and we're being punished because you can't judge what's going on by the storms of life God's love for us has got nothing to do with the circumstances that we see around us although for the prophet in the office of the Prophet sure enough he was able to say that he actually stepped over a red flag in his life and he didn't listen to the word of the Lord and he chose to listen to his mother-in-law instead and the Lord required a price to be paid for that and it wasn't so that he would pay a price for his salvation what it was so that he could actually see a greater understanding of the word in his own life God wanted to get his attention on him and not on his mother-in-law not on Dr best not on any other Ministry that was around that he had to contend with with he wanted the prophet's eyes on him and him alone and that was so that he could properly store up food for a season and here we are partaking of that food it's just wonderful but talking about God's will and I I'm just going to do a little recap and try and maybe do it quickly because I really do want to get into uh Genesis and the scripture that we were talking about last time there's so much in there the story of Joseph is just phenomenal but you know when I was young my dad was teaching me uh while we were still in church he said that if there's one thing that I could impart to you one thing that I could teach you it would be to find the will of the Lord for your life and so I kind of had that in my heart Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee and I just took that and and wondered for years because I I grew up in the Pentecostal church and and about age 14 went out into the world and became a man and started doing my own thing and till age 33 I was was kind of just wandering around a muuk and I still had this kind of in my heart but didn't really know where to go or or what to do or who to talk to even about it and was just sort of stumbling around the best I could but I still had this desire to find maybe the will of God but where do you look where do you find it how how do you get there and I I just secretly wanted to find that so you know for just about 15 20 years I was wandering around looking for it one day I got witnessed to and I came to church and suddenly I heard the pastor of the church my pastor preaching that his will is his word his will is his word and and for myself I thought wow that's incredible I wonder what that means though H how does that actually unpack how do you rationalize that how does that work in the life of a Believer so I I actually struggled as many people do even as a young Christian I struggled and the devil just loves to try and have a field day with Believers especially young believers we say that you have to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's true but you know the battle doesn't start even start until you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that's where God shows his will through our lives that's where he shows overcoming power in our lives and the overcoming that we have to do we could say we need to overcome our boss and we need to overcome our teacher we need to overcome maybe our parents or we need to overcome our children but you know who we need to overcome we just need to look in the mirror that's who we need to overcome when we can overcome that guy or that sister then we're talking about something and the only way that happens is by the will of God the word in our lives that comes by the spirit but I had this pastor who is preaching that his will is his word and he said it over and over again and I I just many times I struggled and I would go and talk to him and and and see if I could get some reasoning or understanding and he would just always try and impart that to me that his will is his word and I know what he was saying to me now but at the time I thought can't you give me something else something more to to take home with me to a a better tool I'm a guy and I I like to use tools and maybe you could just give me a brand new tool that I could put in my tool box and know how to actually deal with these situations but he said to me no no no you've got to find it yourself his his will is his word you've got to open that word up and you got to find it and the only way you're going to be able to find the answer is by his Spirit living out through you and you know I want to say now I I I wish that maybe I would have done more for my pastor when I had the opportunity because goodness sakes he was giving me the greatest gift that I could get by saying get that spirit inside of you because that's the only thing that's going to quick in that word and then you're going to know his will so I struggled for many years as a young Christian and uh we we went through the process of time I became a deacon in the church and we got married and we we I got married first before I did the Deacon bit but we we we were just in in the midst of life and we went through some real hardships and uh things happened in our lives that were unexpected and I I started to get a little maybe dry walking through a little bit of a Wilderness as it were spiritually speaking and even even to the point where I I just wondered if this the Devil comes around in our hardest times the hardest times when it's the worst and then he whispers on our shoulder is this real because you know the word of God says that you know we're not dealing with the trials of our jobs and the trials of our families and the trials of our finances and the although all of those are trials it's the trials of our faith is what the Devil Comes around and tries to get us on so if he can get us on our faith then our marriage then our church then our boss then our finances everything that we're contending with in our lives will fail or maybe even succeed as a curse it's a totally different discussion but what my point is with all of this is I struggled I really struggled and and I got to the place where God wanted me to I was thinking maybe I could do something on my own there was some understanding I had a revelation of the message message and you know I I was living a better life I knew I wasn't who I used to be I knew for sure that I wasn't who I wanted to be but I knew I was somewhere in the middle and it was probably better but it became a really difficult place because I knew there was a power of God I knew there was a will of God and I was close to it but it just wasn't happening in my life I wasn't seeing the fruit of it in my life and it really started to make me upset and irritated because I'm the one that had to do the work work so in all of that I had a conversation with god one time he spoke to me and this was just out of the blue I said this last time I'm just going to say it maybe for the people who weren't here but out of the blue I was just driving one day and I just had a voice come to me if you've ever had it happen you'll know exactly what I mean and I know it because I had a few different events in my life where I heard the same voice speak to me but this time he he just said to me in the midst of my my anxiety and my maybe my fear and and my UPS set and this was like probably a three-year process in my life that the Lord came and said to me so you're looking for an answer on that my my will is my word you want to answer for that and I said yes indeed I do and I just kept driving and I was going to work and yes indeed I do yeah if that's if that's you Lord I know you'll actually speak to me and you'll continue and it will be a scriptural answer and that's what he said you want a scriptural answer I'll give you a scriptural answer and I'm like okay I think this is the Lord now and he said take a look at Joseph's life the story of Joseph my my will is my word it's not an achievement it's not a destination and it's not an action on our part there's nothing that you can do to activate my will my will is my will and it's Sovereign and I thought goodness okay and he said but you know I I know you want a second answer you don't just want one scripture you want another one and I saides indeed you know me Lord and and so he said okay take a look at Daniel take a look at Daniel's life it's not an achievement it's not a destination and it's not an action even though every single one of those things is it's a paradox so for me I was I was like man this is interesting I can't wait till I can pull over my vehicle to go and read the story about Joseph and to go and read the story about Daniel and that's sort of my inspiration for us here today it is truly a paradox because it it it's something that's that seems just about unreal but it's very true impossible but true and you know the the answer that really I was looking for is the truth for my question about how can your your will be your word how does that apply for me in my life at first I was thinking it was just a real easy answer for the pastor to give it it just was simple and it is exactly what the prophet said we'll get into it but what it was was simply this and and it came to me through the word it wasn't because somebody told me or talked me into it and that's why I think it's so powerful if the spirit reveals it to an individual it becomes your personal revelation it's not somebody talking you into something it's not a sales call the truth of the question came to me very clearly that if ye abide in me and my what my word abides in you then ask what you will it doesn't say go to a specific place it doesn't say talk to a specific person it just says get my word in of you and and my word is is me the spirit right but if you abide in me the word read the word feed on the word fellowship with him in prayer listen to the message of the hour demonstrate that you're abiding in him then he will abide in you then we have nothing to fear we can ask whatever we need and we'll never ask a Miss brothers and sisters just like I've said we'll never get out of order in the service here if we get excited because won't we have a time when we get over Yonder I mean really I think it's going to take a few years for us to get over the We Made It part of that meeting we made it brother joose way all of the struggles all of the trials all of the tribulations that we went through we made it can you believe it and then we'll say where's brother so and so where's sister so and so and it will just go on and on and on and on and on oh my but we can talk about it here and have a time right here you don't have to worry about getting out of order don't worry about it I think maybe it might be good for us to once in a while that's right amen brothers and sisters if you get in a rut in a road and that rut has been traveled in over and over and over what happens is that rut gets deeper and deeper and deeper and initially you could probably steer out of that rut because it's not very deep but eventually you're going to come to a place where that rut will keep you and you will be stuck in that rut amen don't make it a rut of religion we want to be able to worship Him in spirit and in truth he said that if you won't worship me the rocks will immediately cry out unto me sons and Daughters of the most high God that know what it means to be justified that knows what it means to have perfect justification you never did it in the first place worship just flows I don't care who's here I don't care what they're thinking I don't care what I've gone through because I know what he's brought me from Hallelujah 1965 one in a million brother bradam he says let me give you a shocking something see not all that says unto me Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father his will is his word I want to say this his will is his word sure enough we can say his will is his word brother Barry the the King James version of the Bible is as far as I want to go we're talking about a brother in water baptism and uh this brother with water baptism he wants to just take what Jesus said go ye into all the world and baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost but what part of the Bible is what Jesus said is what I want to say we got to follow the word if we're following the word then that's his will his will is his word we can be ever so religious have great times shouting jumping in these meetings which were I I don't want to be critical but I have a duty to do to God and that duty is to be sincere and SA what he wants me to say many people claim Jesus many people claim the word of God but not very many people are willing to say God sent a prophet and I believe him because that Prophet is only going to point back to the word of God if he's a true Prophet that's Vindicated he's going to point to the word of God many people claim Jesus many people claim the blood but they'll say his word is for another time he'll say you know what wearing slacks women wearing pants that's for that's for another time it's for another culture but it's Satan's trick to put it off into the past to another culture or into the future to some other time but ignore what's going on right now today you know Not much bothers Satan we said this last time Not much bothers Satan about religion remember Satan is the most religious he is the most religious and he is what was he created for he was created to worship he had the worship program Satan knows all about it he knows all about it but you know brothers and sisters we we can go beyond all of the theory about Satan and all of the worry about Satan and how much power Satan has maybe he was created co-equal with God just get his will his word inside of you and then bring it up on your lips one time believing it in your heart with all of your heart unwavering and you will have that devil trembling he will be a powerless defeated enemy before you he he knows full well that if he can just get us bluffed think that we're good everything is fine in our lives we've got a religious cloak we're a part of the message of the hour everything is fine in our lives you know what happens is he knows exactly where we are and he is not powerless but boy oh boy when you step back behind that word of God he becomes powerless he's a defeated being can you imagine quarreling with a defeated enemy it doesn't make any sense why would we do that he's already defeated but talking about his will being his word Psalms 138 Thy word above all thy name I will worship toward thy Holy Temple and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy Truth for thou Hast magnified Thy word above all thy name Amen in the day when I cried thou answerest me and strengthen me with strength in my soul I say Lord help me to cry out because if there's ever a place we need strength brothers and sisters today it's in our souls the world is showing us we need strength in our bod so we can have good life a good strong long life who wants to contend living in this life we want to get over Yonder but you know what if we do pray for our food this is another thing that my pastor used to teach a lot we could go and eat any food and pray for that food God will actually impart the minerals and nutrients in that food that we need if we believe out of 1960 the queen of of Sheba paragraph 93 brother bam said I said I can't help how much Goliath is God is still God the god of David still lives the god of Abraham still lives the god of Jacob lives the God that was in Christ is living tonight he's raised and I know he's real how many here today know he's real there's something that no matter what the difficult is you want to go anyhow remember all of the brothers of David even the king were afraid of that giant down in the valley but this Ruddy little fellow what did he do he came and said are you guys serious right now I'm just a ruddy little kid I came to bring you cheese and meat and try and see what's going on in the in the midst of the battle here and all of you guys are afraid of one measy giant down in the valley he's trespassing we're in our Promised Land he's got no right isn't there anybody that's going to go and fight him and everyone was afraid and this Ruddy little guy what'd he do he said okay I'll go and the King said oh if you're going to go you better be careful because you know you're just a youth and he's been a warrior since he was a youth and he's a big big bad giant now you better be careful isn't that interesting the king the the leader of the army would be discouraging the one who has the revelation yes the devil's no different today brothers and sisters but that Ruddy little fellow what did he do he didn't cower from that giant he didn't run back up the hill he ran down to the battle and I believe the True Believer with the spirit of God is going to run right to the battle we're not going to run away from it we're going to draw that much closer together he says no matter what the difficult is you want to go anyhow because there's you got an objective and if you'll take the right motive towards that objective remember he was trespassing he was a trespasser there was no enemy that could stand before the children of Israel in their Promised Land not one enemy you got an objective and if you'll take the right motive towards that objective you'll get there you got to have the right motive towards your objective that's the way I always find the will of God first think if it's the will of God then my motive and my objective to it if it's the right motive then the objective I have now this might sound a little bit nebulous and and maybe stretching something here maybe I am stretching it but I want to say this if you are in a position in your life brothers and sisters we'll just jump right to the punchline now I got lots more to say we're not going to end yet but no matter where you're at I I want to say this if you've got his spirit inside of you brothers and sisters you are in his will you're completely in his will some people will be worried oh my I don't want to take a step I don't want to get outside of his perfect will oh I could be in his permissive will if I just go one inch this way or maybe if I don't do this that way or the other then I could be in a permissive will brothers and sisters get right with God you're in his perfect will it doesn't matter where you are or what you're going through amen because if you're in his perfect will you'll always subject yourself to his word and as long as you're willing to do that if you're willing to subject yourself to his word it shows you're in his will amen hallelujah then I want to say this ask what you will don't be afraid you know we've said it many times in the past and I believe it applies right here we could be so Heavenly minded that we're no Earth good so super spiritual about everything that we're encountering does it really matter what side of the bread you put the butter on when you're eating does it really matter how you brush your teeth right it doesn't does it and I believe the majority of this life is like that for God as human beings we live our lives and sometimes we can be so spiritually minded we're afraid to take a step and what it becomes is spiritual analysis paralysis we're so spiritual we can't take a step but remember what did Joshua get commissioned with if you're going to March into this Promised Land then every single place the soul of your foot Treads is your possession go forwards be strong be courageous be very courageous and March forwards because this is your promised land and as long as you're in this land there's no man that will ever be able to stand before you we've gone over and over and over this but I just want to say it today maybe for the visitors there ain't no one devil that can stand before you all the days of your life when you're in your Promised Land the promised land for us today is the Holy Ghost it's not saying that I'm a part of the message of the hour that is a falsehood you need to get that message of the hour inside of you amen once that message is inside of you ask what you will because what's the message it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever all the works that he did will we do also but if you have the right motive towards your objective then you can have what you will whatever you want than you Lord and you know having what you want is not going out and saying I want a Lamborghini you know I think a a brand new Huracan is exactly what God's will is for my life there's many people that do that I need a golf stream God told me this morning when I was I was getting ready for service that I need a golf stream a and you know he said that you're going to get it for me can you imagine brothers and sisters this is real I'm not saying that I God said that to me I'm not saying that I'm saying not to you but there's Ministry out there wolves in sheep's clothing saying those words and people believing it amen we're not playing that game no no no we're not going to ask a Miss we'll never ask a Miss if we've got his spirit inside of us we'll only ask according to his word but that's why I say the only thing for us today is to get his holy ghost to get his spirit inside of us without his spirit then we're going to be just like all the other religious cranks in this world brothers and sisters the differentiation here with the message of the hour and everyone else is the real baptism of the Holy Ghost and the false baptism of the Holy Ghost there's an anointing of the Holy Ghost but then there's the actual indwelling of the justifying Spirit the one who actually justifies us you know if we have the right attitude the right mental attitude towards what towards the word of God will bring any promise to pass in our lives you know out of uh out of uh oh my 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 14 says now we exhort you Brethren warn them that are unruly Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but follow that which is good both amongst yourselves and to all men Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you I believe talking about the word of God it is very very important to just consider the will of God and and what that really means it is his word his will is his word verse 19 says quench not the spirit despise not prophesyings prove all things hold fast to that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of Lord Jesus Christ Faithful Is He that calleth you who also will do it I just want to to throw that in there brothers and sisters I think it's so important for us to remember that it's not us doing it all that we just read is him doing it it's him doing it in our lives but only if we're willing to surrender to his will which is his word my so like we said last time What attitude do we have today brothers and sisters we're going somewhere with all of this this is all leading up to if you think about the life of Joseph we just described the life of Joseph right here out of Thessalonians I believe um but we'll get into it in a little bit I think it's just so so good out of First Peter SEC uh 1 Peter 2 verse 13 submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme or unto Governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well for so is the will of God that ye with welld doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your Liberty for a cloak of maliciousness saying I'm in the message I've I've made it so I can do these dirty things on the sides or dirty deals or whatever no not using your Liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the Servants of God honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God honor the king servants I'll say this employees be subject to your masters with all fear and just for the record that word servants has nothing to do with wives and it has nothing to do with children it's employees servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the forward the ones that are tough to deal with with for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrongfully for what is what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God many times we want to say I got rights man you can't treat me that way what does the word of God say wow even when we're mistreated as Believers of this message of the hour Holy Ghost filled people we don't got a lot of wiggle room if we have his will his word inside of us verse 21 says for even here unto were ye called This is the calling that we've been called to because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth remember we're talking about Joseph who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not we know the word is speaking about Jesus for the record but I'm just sort of trying to draw our attention to Joseph I'm not saying this is speaking of Joseph specifically this is referring to Jesus Christ who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself self to him that judgeth righteously if we do that brothers and sisters ourselves then we simply Heap coals of fire upon those who are persecuting us but when we literally go to the stove and open the door and dig out a nice bucket full of coals and go and throw it at our brother or throw it at our sister then the word of God is of none effect in our lives right then they can actually turn around and potentially do that to us verse 24 who his own self bear our sins in his own body on a tree speaking of Jesus God In the Flesh that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes ye were healed for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and Bishop of your souls isn't that wonderful to think that we all were sheep gone astray but there came a time where we heard heard the shepherd's voice did you ever see that video where there's a herd of sheep on the hill it was circulating a little while ago and there was a group of people at a viewing area here and two or three of the people they tried calling here sheep here sheep sheep sheep and the Sheep just kept grazing didn't even Flinch didn't even care like not a word didn't matter how much they called the Sheep but then the shepherd stepped up and he said the words that those sheep were used to and immediately the Sheep turned and came my sheep hear my voice my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow that's why we have to have his Spirit when we're willing to have his Spirit then we'll actually hear his voice and you know brothers and sisters there's no shortcuts to it we read it in the saman church age we have to suffer that's the life that we've been given Jesus came and he suffered how did he learn obedience it was through the things that he suffered we're going to suffer in this world but when we suffer we're going to come in line with the word of God and when we come in line with the word of God then we can exercise the power of God not to go and persecute but what we've talked about in the past this is the most beautiful thing I I think it's probably the the key to overcoming as a believer in the message of the hour in in Christianity in general if we have a problem with a brother or a sister go to prayer go to prayer and pray for that brother and sister that God would bless that brother and sister pray that God would actually uplift that brother and sister pray that that Lord would just pour out a spiritual Revelation in their life pray that the Lord would heal their bodies that he would heal their their homes and and pour an abundance of goodness into their life and what happens when you do that brothers and sisters is 99.9% of the time I would say it all the time for the record God he your prayer but what happens 99% of the time is that person doesn't change you don't necessarily see God pour a blessing out in their life but what happens is our heart changes we get up singing and shouting the Victory and then we can say victory is mine not God you need to change that person you need to change that guy you got to fix that sister she's just got such a mouth on her all she does is all he does is all these things the more we do that the more we cause problems but you know what the prophet said we talked about this a little while ago say something nice about someone if you want to talk about someone say something nice don't talk dirty don't talk bad when you're doing that you're just saying here devil here here's a mouth here's some lips and a tongue come and use them for your glory that's what we're doing that might sound really crude and rude but it's true we're either going to give voice to God or to the devil that's what's going to happen in our lives there's no shortcuts for every one of us we all have to learn obedience the same way God's will for our lives brothers and sisters is his word God's will is his word and and like I said you know I had this conversation I knew there had to be a scriptural answer for the the question in my life and I believe God God brought it brother Brad I'm talking about the uh the story of Joseph my goodness actually we'll just read the scripture here let's turn over to Genesis Chapter 30 we've still got lots of time but it's amazing how slippery that last 25 minutes is the story of Joseph is just so fascinating because when Joseph came on the scene we we talked about this last time do you have that slide brother I sent an email we got a minute I think I hope it came through we talked about this last week how Joseph came on the scene um we know that Joseph he he came on the scene through Rebecca but we have Jacob who was the the brother that started out his life pulling a fast one and uh his mother helped him with it we didn't really talk about that last week but um do you have that slide brother it didn't come through that's too bad there's a line that I wanted to show um anyways Jacob came into the uh the scenario and uh he deceived his dad he got the blessing he took it from Esau and we know that that's the word of God Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated just to give a little bit of a quick background on that but uh what happened was Jacob now was told by his mom you better flee because if you don't your brother's going to kill you because you took the birthright but he wasn't really interested in the birthright didn't mean much to him he was willing to trade the birthright for a a little bit of food because his natural circumstances were more important to him than the spiritual blessing in his life and so what he did was he fled and went to his his mother's brother's house lean and lean again did what Joseph did he pulled a fast one on him he worked for him for seven years and was promised that he could marry Rebecca he met her and she was the most beautiful thing that he had ever seen in his life and when he actually was come time to marry her she was the the not the oldest she was the second youngest I think the second daughter and uh the father pulled a fast one the father-in-law and at their marriage swapped and gave him Leah instead of Rebecca and uh so he actually got pretty bitter in the morning we know the story um but what happened was there was children born from that marriage from uh Jacob with Leah and then there was children born with Jacob and Rebecca the one Rachel I don't know why I'm saying that yeah sorry Jacob and Rachel and uh the two children that came from Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin and the others are from the other wives and the wives slaves is what the Bible says and and helpers however you want to want to word that but uh anyways um it's interesting because those two children were with the wife that Joseph uh sorry that Jacob loved the most and uh yeah it's just an interesting thing we brought that last week but out of out of Genesis 30: 23 and she can received and bear a son and said God hath taken away my reproach verse 24 and she called his name Joseph and said the Lord shall add to me another son Jacob was his father Rachel his mother and his brother was Benjamin Jacob he had four wives sorry it's not scripture now and and we know that that he was tricked and there was the other two maid servants is what the Bible says and uh we know that this is where all the 12 Patriarchs for the children of Israel came from it's a very interesting thing Joseph and his brothers but from an early age Joseph could not help what he actually was and sorry I went back too far to Genesis Chapter 30 um I didn't really want to get into that I wanted to get into [Music] Joseph Joseph in Genesis chapter 37 is where I wanted to go to here we have Joseph at about 17 years old he was feeding the flock with his Brethren I guess I'll just start with verse one chapter 37 of Genesis and Jacob dwelt in the land where his father was a stranger and in the land of Canaan these are the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his Brethren and the lad was with the sons of of billah and with the sons of zilpa those are the two maid servants and his father's wives and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report and and we know we we talked about this last week how Israel loved Joseph more than all of his children and what did he do he gave him the Cod of Many Colors and many times this is a a story that's like a Sunday School Story and uh it's it's a good good story It's a Wonderful story but there's a very deep meaning to this story it's way more than just maybe coloring books and uh the colorful jacket but the brothers they couldn't stand who he was because they saw their dad loved him more and that's simply because they he loved their mother more and and that's the way it worked but the more they saw of this one the more they hated him and and it goes on to say that they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him in verse four and verse 5 Joseph dreamed a dream and told it to his Brethren and they hated him yet the more verse 7 you know he he talks about the sheaves how they stood around and made obedience to my sheath and they hated him yet the more verse 8 says and and verse n you know behold the moon the sun moon and 11 stars made obedience to me and and he told it to his father this is verse 10 and to his brother and I'm just going through this really quickly because I want to try and get further than we did last time and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou Hast dreamed shall I and thy mother and thy Brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the Earth can you imagine the child saying that that's what's going to happen as a father you're going to say really we're going to come and and and worship you you're our son you're going to worship us that's the way this is going to work but it shows his dad observed it in in verse 11 and his Brethren envied him didn't like it at all but his father observed the saying and we know the story goes on through the process of time in in in process of time the Brethren were out doing their things with the sheep and and dad said to Joseph I think it's time you go check on the on the flocks and your brethren and see what's going on see what kind of evil they're up to we know that they're up to no good and we know that while he went out looking for them he met a guy in the field and told them where they were where the brothers were in verse 19 says and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh here he comes now what's going to happen and let us slay him and cast him into some pit where we will say some evil Beast hath devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams can you imagine that that's the Brethren that he had from the different wives the different mothers and and it's just terrible how that would be the case and Reuben heard of it this is verse 12 and he delivered him out of their hands and said let us not kill him and Reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might that he might rid him out of their hand to deliver them him to his father again his intention was to actually save his life wasn't it right he wanted to actually see him go back to his dad verse 23 and it came to pass when Joseph was come unto his Brethren that they stripped Joseph of his coat his coat of many colors that was on him and we know that they were absolutely jealous over him we that the father would love him the way that they he did and uh so they they threw him down the the they sold him into slavery and then I want to pick up the story where he actually goes down into into Egypt because I think is where it's where it really starts to to pick up just a little side note along the way to look at one one member there's two actually in the story Judah and Reuben they both play pivotal roles in the story but Judah he he was not really a kind brother and uh it's interesting because if you look at the way he treated him and his behavior in this story I'm not going to dig too far into it but just for the sake of time I just wanted to mention it um how his behavior was but yet he is the direct lineage of Christ we know that Christ came from the tribe of Judah but it's no accident that it behaved that way you know par or uh chapter 38 of Genesis he goes into talking about Judah and how he had sons and how he had a daughter and how the son died and and he you know the the law of the Jews was that the next son would rise up and actually have children in place of his brother that passed away and the brother was wicked and he didn't want to do it you know the story of uh of uh Judah here and Tamar what happened was he found himself down the road going to do a little bit of work and as Judah the the one of the Patriarchs was along the way what does he do he goes and actually doesn't doesn't perform the duty that he's supposed to he told his do his son's wife to go and wait as as a widow in the in the house of your father wait wait there and when the youngest son gets of age he'll actually come and marry you and raise up seed in in place of your the the two other brothers she said okay she was obedient and what happened was the other boy grew up and he didn't do anything about it he just went along his way and as he was on the way going to Shear his sheep seeing what was going on just conducting business what did he do he found a prostitute he thought on the side of the road and didn't realize that it was actually his daughter-in-law and she actually redeemed the seed from that tribe through her the lineage of Christ came can you imagine that that's the way it happened just a sidebar about that but going down into chapter 39 if you want to turn there chapter 39 of Genesis and Joseph was brought down to Egypt already sold into slavery he was brought down into Egypt and potier an officer of pharaoh captain of the guard and Egyptian brought him bought him of the hands of the ishmaelites which had brought him down tither so now I i' I've laid sort of the background and talked a little bit about the backstory I'm sorry that it was kind of broken up and I misquoted Rebecca for Rachel but here we are I'm getting to the point that I wanted to get to today and now the time is slipping away verse two and the Lord was with Joseph he was hated by his brothers questioned by his parents attempted to be killed by his brothers sold into slavery by his brothers finds him himself through all of these bumpy patches all of these valleys all along the way did the Lord just suddenly meet him there in Egypt do you think the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and his master saw what his master saw that the Lord was with him this is where I want to dig in brothers and sisters when we live our lives do our masters in this world see that the Lord is with us because if he sees that he's with us then we're going to prosper amen this is where I think it's so important to say it's not all about a destination to say that God's will is for me to move to so and so even though it is but even if if if if all it is is God's will for someone to move from another country to come to Calgary to come to Canada in Calgary in Canada if that's all it is then then what's the purpose there has to be more when you're there right that's my point we live our lives until we can't live anymore so while we're living Our Lives we have got to be able to demonstrate the life of Jesus Christ through US amen we've got to be able to show the world that the Lord is with us just like he was with Joseph am now I'm not saying that we're Joseph but I want want to say this the Vindicated Prophet for our day Malachi 45 and 6 Revelations 10 1-7 that prophet he said that you are Messiah ET and I know there's preachers out there that would say oh that's blasphemous that's heresy how could you say that if you have his Spirit then whose Spirit do you have we know that we've heard it preached through a Vindicated Prophet that if you've got the spirit of Dillinger inside of you then what are you going to do you're going to be a gangster right if you've got the spirit of Beethoven inside of you what are you going to do you're going to sit down and you're going to be able to compose music and play but if you got the spirit of Christ inside of you right what's going to happen who are you verse three and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to Pro prosper in his hand I I just feel so impressed to say this brothers and sisters if you believe the word of God if you believe the message of the hour if you've got the holy ghost in your life this is not exclusive to Joseph because he was a type of Jesus Christ this is exclusive to the people who have Jesus Christ Living in them the world can't claim this but the people who have the spirit of Christ Living out through them they can claim this the Lord will make everything prosper in your hand amen it's not to say that we're not going to go through valleys it's the trials of our faith that are going to prove who we are we're having a conversation this week and I think it's so good I'm going to continue to say brothers and sisters all you've got to do the Lord allows this on purpose he allows the pressure to come in our lives to squish us don't look for some great ecclesiastical squeeze out there somewhere look for it right here because this is the squeeze that I think think is the most important this is just my opinion here but that squeeze is going to demonstrate who's on the inside CU you're either going to have the spirit of Christ or you're going to have the spirit of the world to reject the baptism of the Holy Ghost is to what accept the mark of the beast you're going to have one or the other Spirit living out through you I think it's so beautiful we don't have to be afraid don't worry brothers and sisters just get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the reason the Vindicated Prophet came so that we could be introduced to the bridegroom and become his Earthly bride verse four and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer of his house and all that he had put into his hand and it came to pass from the time that he had made him Overseer in his house and over all that he had the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake how many times have we heard that someone is a Joseph to ACC company talking about the brothers or the sisters they go and they work for someone and they just Prosper that place things just happen and it's supernatural you could even talk to some brothers that say I don't even know how it happened I can't even explain it I just know it did I was there and I just prayed the Lord will bless the Egyptians house for your sake but in this story he blessed it for Joseph's sake and all the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field and I just think this next verse is beautiful and he left all that he had in Joseph's hand and he knew not ought he had save the bread which he did eat that means he completely trusted him 100% and didn't worry about it and you know I believe that's the way God wants to be with his child with his son and with his daughter with his Earthly bride he wants to just say you've got the checkbook honey and all you've got to do is write the check right and we know brother bradam he said that there's two types of people isn't there there's the fundamentalists where they've got all the Dynamics and then there's the other ones maybe who are the real Believers but they've got the full checkbook but they just don't have the money in the bank and I'm totally saying it wrong but brother bradam said if you ever get those two people together the one that has the checkbook and the one that has the bank account you get those two together the Dynamics and the mechanics look out but here we have Joseph as an example living his life and it didn't seem to matter where he went did it wherever he went the blessing of God was with him some might say well that's just predestination God made him that way and you know that wasn't for anyone else it was just for him and you know sometimes that's the way it is that you can't get anybody to believe something they don't want to believe it takes God to issue Revelation it needs to become real to the individual but once that happens once we recognize that there's a compound meaning and Revelation for every single verse then we begin to see not only Christ from Genesis to Revelation but we start to see our name from Genesis to revelation we start to see that's me that's me that's me hey mama that's me that's me I can recognize the reflection in that mirror that's me it's not just Joseph it's not just someone else but you know I I just want to go a little bit further here in this scripture and it came to pass after these things verse S that his master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph hm and she said lie with me but what he refused why because he was in God's will why because his word was in him why because his parents trained him up in the way that he should go so when he was posed with this circumstance he didn't cave in he refused but you know what the word of God says just like the lives that we live brothers and sisters it doesn't matter what our circumstance what we find our station to be what our Giants are in the valley because we've all got them the devil doesn't give up and this woman here even after he refused she became persistent and she tried more and more and more and what did he say in verse 9 he says there's none greater in this house than I neither hath he kept back anything from me this is Joseph speaking to the wife about his master pontier he hath kept sorry there is none greater in this house than I neither hath he kept anything from me but thee because Thou Art his wife and how can I do this great wickedness and it's interesting because I I found when I was reading this I was expecting the word to say how can I keep from doing this wickedness against him but he doesn't doesn't say that does he no he says how can I then how can I do this great wickedness and sin against God automatically going against the word because he knew his will and it came to pass as she spake to Joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie with her or to be with her and we know the story it came to pass about this time Joseph went into to the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within and she caught him by His Garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled he didn't give in he fought because he knew his position he knew his master he knew where he stood wasn't interested in just giving in and we know the story it goes on to say now he's right back into a valley again before he was on the Mountaintop all that pontier had was in his hands but now uhoh prison back in the pit back in the pit you go he must have been wondering H I thought I was in God's will I thought his will was his word and his word was in me and I could ask whatever I will did it change no God began to Magnify Him more because he condu conducted himself with grace even in the turmoil the turmoil the situation verse verse 20 says and Joseph's Master took him and put him into prison a place where the king's prisoners were bound and remember this is God's will back to prison hey verse 21 but the Lord was what he was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of The Keeper of the prison it's not about where we go brothers and sisters it's about who we go with it's all about who we go with no matter where we go no matter what we do what job we apply for what position we're looking at whoever we're going to marry whatever it is we're doing do it with Christ verse 23 The Keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with with him and and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper am and that's one of the biggest tricks of the devil today is for us to begin prospering and saying my I did good today you know what you only did good because he allowed it and if we're willing to say Thank You Lord because you're the only reason I've done good he's going to continue prospering you and we know the story how it goes just so good this whole story of Joseph I know we're out of time now my just a couple more minutes if that's okay on we'll carry on later but my my my my we might need a part three even for Joseph here it's just incredible isn't it verse chapter 40 how how he goes and now that he's in prison what happens is he finds himself with the Butler and the and the baker the two and they have dreams and and it's interesting because as they have dreams what does Joseph say to them do not interpretations belong to God immediately he gives it to God he doesn't say oh I can interpret dreams yeah God's really entrusted me with a gift no he doesn't do that at all he gives it to God I'll call the musicians or or I will really just keep going on and on I don't want to keep us long here but you know we we know this story here the Butler and the baker he he they both inter tell him the dreams and uh he tells the butler you know what the dream says that in three days time you're going to be back you're going to squeeze the grapes in Pharaoh's cup again you're going to be right where you were but the baker he had the three baskets on his head and and the birds came and ate all of the food the meat out of the basket out of the top basket and and Joseph had to tell him you know what that that means that in 3 days from now you're going to hang High the Pharaoh is not going to have any more use for you whatever you've done you've done and we know both of those came to pass and Joseph he said in verse 14 of Genesis chapter 40 but think on me when it shall be well with thee to the Butler and show kindness I pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house and you know in Genesis chapter 41 this is why I I'm sorry brothers and sisters I just I feel like I could keep going Genesis chapter 41 I'm going to leave off here or I won't quit maybe stand with me and it came to pass at the end of two full years he's in prison it's not just a week it's not just a month two more full years of being in God's will if you're struggling brothers and sisters if there's a trial if there's a a turmoil if there's a situation doesn't mean you're outside of God's will just make sure you've got God inside of you have the Holy Ghost Inside of You brothers and sisters it doesn't matter what your station is he's looking to see your response to the circumstance because when you get squeezed whatever's on the inside is going to come out and when you're getting a a a a squeeze spiritually or or mentally what's going to happen is whoever's on the inside is going to come out and you can't hide that person just get someone a little bit angry and see what happens see how they act do they act like Joseph do they have the spirit of Christ or do they get really mad and they want to lash out they want to call you a name back because they feel like you stepped on them do they want to do this because of that is it this and that or is it Lord have mercy am because the spirit of Christ is very clearly outlined in the word of God I'm going to keep going with this Lord willing just remember his will is his word and just make sure you've got him wherever you're at whatever it is you're going through commit it to him but he wants us to March brothers and sisters we've got to be willing to March forward we can't just stay in one spot we've got to be able to take a step and know by faith he's going to have that next stare there for us many times we can't see it we just have to believe it let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we love you and we thank you so much for your goodness and your mercy to us Lord thank you for the story of Joseph Lord father we look forward to meeting him someday we know there's so much in that story Lord that we couldn't even talk about today and father I pray that Lord you would just help us us to maybe not stumble around next time so much and just be able to be a little more clear with it Lord father I pray that you would just help us to see the story of Joseph and how Lord Jesus you express yourself to us and through us and many times through us is how you express to us father I pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us as we go our separate ways Lord that you would be with those who are traveling and that father we could just see your will in our lives clearer and clearer as the days go by Lord father we pray that you would just be glorified now in a couple of songs that we sing before we go our separate ways we love you we thank you we just commit each life into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we
