[43:15] some something I sometimes forget and I
[43:18] I paid up myself because as a musician I
[43:21] should never forget to thank the
[43:24] musicians I don't feel good when the
[43:27] minister doesn't thank us just to be
[43:30] honest so it's I shouldn't forget I want
[43:36] us to read from Romans chapter 4 this
[43:40] morning and we'll also read from Romans
[43:42] chapter
[43:43] 8 Romans chapter 4 will start from verse
[43:46] 17 and we'll read to the end of that
[43:50] chapter and then Romans 8 we'll read the
[43:53] very
[43:55] famous part of that chapter I think all
[43:59] of it is actually famous and speaks to
[44:01] us but we read 38 and
[44:04] 39 if I could please have some more
[44:07] monitor that'll be good thank
[44:10] you Romans 4 from verse
[44:15] 17 Paul speaking here says as it is
[44:18] written I have made thee a father of
[44:21] many nations talking about Abraham
[44:25] before him whom he believed even God who
[44:28] quickeneth the dead and calleth those
[44:31] things which be not as do the were amen
[44:35] who against hope believed in hope that
[44:40] he might become the father of many
[44:42] nations according to that which was
[44:46] spoken so shall thy seed be and being
[44:50] not weak in faith he considered not his
[44:53] own body now dead when he was about
[44:55] about 100 years old neither yet the
[44:58] deadness of Sarah's whoop is stagered
[45:02] not at the promise of God through
[45:04] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[45:07] glory to God Amen and being fully
[45:10] persuaded that what he had
[45:12] promised he was able to perform amen
[45:16] that's where I'm going to take my title
[45:17] from this morning just I'll continue to
[45:19] read but my title this morning will be
[45:23] that um just the state M saying I am
[45:27] fully
[45:28] persuaded my title this morning I am
[45:31] fully persuaded and therefore it was
[45:33] imputed to him for
[45:36] righteousness now it was not written for
[45:39] his sake
[45:40] alone pay attention to that that it was
[45:44] imputed to him but for us
[45:47] also to whom it shall be
[45:50] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[45:54] up Jesus our lord from the dead he was
[45:57] delivered for our offenses and was
[46:00] raised again for our
[46:03] justification let's just quickly flip
[46:05] over to chapter 8 from verse 38 to
[46:11] 39 Paul's speaking here it said for I am
[46:15] persuaded that neither death nor life No
[46:20] Angels no principalities no powers no
[46:24] things present nor things to comeu nor
[46:28] height nor depth nor any other
[46:31] creature anything that's created At All
[46:34] by God by
[46:36] man shall be able to separate us from
[46:40] the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[46:43] our lordu let's pray this
[46:46] morning Heavenly
[46:50] Father this is the most important part
[46:52] of the service amen it's not because the
[46:55] other parts were not
[46:58] important but that was the preparation
[47:00] for this
[47:02] time the time lord when we want to hear
[47:05] directly from you yes amen anytime we'll
[47:08] come here Lord Jesus our desire is to
[47:10] hear directly from you thank you Lord
[47:12] amen and Lord we want to ask you to take
[47:16] total control now
[47:18] Lord take this unworthy
[47:21] leaps and just speak to the needs of
[47:24] your people yes amen amen the word is a
[47:27] discerner of the thoughts and the
[47:28] intents of the
[47:30] Heart Lord it wouldn't feel good if your
[47:32] people came with burdens and they have
[47:34] to go back with those
[47:36] burdens you know what those burdens are
[47:38] I don't know them Lord but you know them
[47:41] yes amen they're here Lord Jesus Christ
[47:45] father for you to take all those burdens
[47:49] from
[47:50] them Lord to to to to soo the pain there
[47:54] Lord Jesus
[47:56] to find solutions to their problems to
[47:59] comfort their hearts Lord and all of
[48:02] that can only be done by you can only be
[48:06] done by your
[48:07] word may you speak to your people this
[48:09] morning yes amen remember our brothers
[48:12] Lord Jesus Christ in leth Bridge
[48:14] including our
[48:15] pastor we just pray that you do the same
[48:18] there
[48:19] Lord Lord as our fathers of old we say
[48:23] the Lord watch between me and thee
[48:26] saying that may the Lord go with you as
[48:29] he will go with me so that when we meet
[48:32] again we can testify of What the Lord
[48:34] Has Done amen let that be Lord Jesus our
[48:38] testimony when our brothers will return
[48:41] with thir testimonies of what you've
[48:43] done in Lethbridge at the end of the
[48:45] service may we look back and say God has
[48:48] been with us has spoken to us and has
[48:51] met our every need in Jesus Christ's
[48:54] name we pray amen amen amen you may have
[48:57] your
[49:01] seat so just still very much in the mood
[49:04] of the New Year how many of us enjoyed
[49:07] the service last week that our pastor
[49:10] took you know the word of God is given
[49:13] not only
[49:14] for admonition it's also given for
[49:17] rebuke for reprove for
[49:20] correction and I've always thought that
[49:22] anytime that the Lord brings correction
[49:25] God is extending his
[49:28] mercy and it I think it was a good start
[49:31] to the year for God to clean us
[49:34] up make us get our house in order amen
[49:38] so that he can send down the blessings
[49:40] am so this morning you know I was
[49:43] thinking about what to bring and this
[49:46] message um was what the Lord L in my
[49:50] heart I brought it in Lethbridge on the
[49:51] last day of
[49:53] 2023 and I just felt in press in my
[49:56] heart to bring it again because this
[49:58] title that I've taken this morning is
[50:01] what I am coming into 2024 with an
[50:05] assurance that I am fully persuaded you
[50:08] know we think about the fact that God um
[50:11] said to us in the scripture I think I
[50:13] said that when I was praying um last
[50:15] week you know when we were going to take
[50:17] the offering that God said to us you
[50:20] know by by the the psalmist that said
[50:22] teach us to number our days
[50:26] you know we we count years we count
[50:28] months we count weeks it's God's design
[50:31] from the beginning God already put you
[50:33] know the the the the stars in there the
[50:35] moon in there the the the sun in there
[50:37] for a purpose and that purpose is so
[50:40] that it will be for for for seasons and
[50:43] for years and God expects us that as we
[50:46] count those years we are not just
[50:49] counting for fun God expects us that we
[50:52] apply our hearts to wisdom and as as we
[50:55] turn into a new year is an opportunity
[50:58] to look back and say what has God done
[51:00] in the past year but more importantly
[51:04] what is God ready to do in this new year
[51:08] now in looking at what God has done in
[51:09] the past year you know that song says
[51:12] count your blessings name them one by
[51:15] one many times we think about the
[51:17] counting but we forget about the naming
[51:21] of those blessings because when God
[51:23] gives you a blessing then there is a
[51:25] purpose why God is bringing that
[51:27] blessing God brings that blessing to
[51:29] encourage you to be able to trust him
[51:32] for what he's going to do in the future
[51:35] you know so God wants us to count the
[51:37] blessings but also to name those
[51:39] blessings how do you name your blessings
[51:42] you reflect on what God has done you
[51:44] look at an experience that you've had
[51:47] and you say to the devil that with this
[51:49] experience God has proven to me that
[51:52] what God cannot do does not
[51:57] exist God takes you through a trial you
[52:00] come out of that trial and God shows you
[52:04] by that blessing that I am the Lord your
[52:06] God that Health all your
[52:08] diseases so God expects us to count our
[52:12] blessings and name our blessings to
[52:14] record them I remember Pastor talking
[52:16] about you know the testimony book we all
[52:19] guilty we know that I don't know how
[52:21] many of us have written in that book but
[52:24] the pastor wanted it to be a book of
[52:28] remembrance and even if you don't get a
[52:30] chance to write it there find a way to
[52:33] record what God has done in your life
[52:35] amen hallelujah and memories are not
[52:37] always sharp but sometimes you know it's
[52:41] good enough even if you haven't written
[52:43] it down to think about what God has done
[52:45] to help you to know that God is able to
[52:48] do more in the future you know the very
[52:51] reason why we have the scriptures the
[52:54] Bible said this thing Things are Written
[52:55] for our examples so we can have a
[52:58] reference point so we can go back and
[53:01] say if God did this for Abraham then God
[53:03] can do it for me and that's what I'm
[53:06] bringing this morning you know this
[53:07] morning I'm not my regular comfort zone
[53:11] of teaching I probably won't be there
[53:13] this morning I'll probably be doing a
[53:15] bit of preaching this morning so bear
[53:17] with me if I go too fast and uh if I'm
[53:20] going too fast just slow me down a
[53:21] little bit uh the deacons can do that or
[53:24] anybody
[53:27] so we're taking the title this morning
[53:29] of I am fully
[53:31] persuaded and Paul was giving an account
[53:34] of
[53:35] Abraham that Abraham was fully persuaded
[53:39] that the promise that God made God was
[53:41] able to bring it to pass now being
[53:44] persuaded means to be convinced being
[53:47] persuaded means to be certain being
[53:49] persuaded means to be satisfied being
[53:52] persuaded means to be worn over being
[53:55] persuaded mean to be sold I'm sold on
[53:58] that idea I'm sold on what he has told
[54:00] me being persuaded means to be inclined
[54:03] toward something so the story of Abraham
[54:06] goes this way he was
[54:09] living in the land where God um has
[54:13] taken his forefathers After the flood I
[54:15] believe he came from my kids can correct
[54:18] me if I'm wrong but I think I think he
[54:19] came from the lineage of jaff is that
[54:21] correct
[54:23] pus it was sham okay okay thank you we
[54:26] went through it at home
[54:28] recently and his forefathers had
[54:31] migrated because they started to
[54:33] multiply After the flood but there were
[54:36] no more serving God and then God decided
[54:39] to call a single man out and this is
[54:43] what God did God said come out of your
[54:45] father's land come out of your Kindra
[54:48] and I will take you to a land now if I
[54:52] tell you come follow me what's the next
[54:55] question where are we
[54:58] going and if I tell you nowhere are you
[55:01] going to follow me you're going to think
[55:04] twice you know where I come from
[55:07] especially if a stranger you don't
[55:09] follow a
[55:11] stranger right but Abraham must have
[55:15] understood that this person that was
[55:17] speaking to him was someone that was
[55:20] greater than just anybody it was someone
[55:22] he could trust it was someone he could
[55:24] put his confidence in and the Bible said
[55:27] that the things that God said to him
[55:30] regardless of the current situation and
[55:34] Circumstance Abraham believed God
[55:37] regardless of the situation of the
[55:38] circumstance now when God started to
[55:41] speak to Abraham in Genesis chapter 12
[55:43] let's just take a look at some of the
[55:45] things that God said to him and let's
[55:47] look at how impossible those things were
[55:50] God called Abraham he said now get thee
[55:53] out of thy country from thy Kindra and
[55:56] from thy Father's House unto a land that
[55:58] I will show thee and I will make of thee
[56:01] a great nation who was he talking to a
[56:05] man that had no
[56:07] child a man whose wife was
[56:10] Barren he didn't say I will make of thee
[56:13] many children he said I will make of
[56:15] thee a great
[56:17] nation he said and I will bless thee and
[56:22] make thy name
[56:23] great a man that no one knew anything
[56:27] about and thou shallal be a blessed that
[56:31] means it was going to be a source of
[56:34] blessing now what did he say again and I
[56:37] will bless them that bless thee and
[56:40] curse them that curseth thee and in thee
[56:43] wow shall all the
[56:47] families of the earth be
[56:51] blessed all the families of the earth
[56:54] and the Bible I told us that Abraham
[56:56] departed but when Abraham decided to go
[57:00] he did not fully follow the instruction
[57:03] of God God told him to depart and take
[57:07] what belongs to him now Abraham went as
[57:11] with his father and with with his nephew
[57:15] those were not not technically people
[57:17] that belonged to him were not part of
[57:18] his household but Abraham did that just
[57:21] in in in the kindness of his heart you
[57:24] know my nephew you know is fatherless my
[57:28] brother has died I don't want to leave
[57:29] him alone and he started to go with him
[57:32] and as he went they got to a
[57:36] place where now the first thing that
[57:38] happened was Abraham backed so he he he
[57:42] went with lot and his father his father
[57:44] died on the trip and then when Abraham
[57:46] got to a
[57:48] place which the Bible you know made us
[57:51] to realize that that was also part of
[57:54] the land of Canaan there was famine in
[57:57] the land and Abraham went to Egypt now
[58:01] God knows how to make us take a walk
[58:05] with
[58:06] him you know brother Paul
[58:08] kichi that very first message you
[58:11] preached has never left
[58:13] me a walk with
[58:16] God Abraham walked with God when you
[58:20] talk about taking a walk with someone it
[58:23] is Progressive
[58:25] when you talk about taking a walk with
[58:27] someone there are lined marks there are
[58:29] M Stones as you continue to go and that
[58:33] is the exact same way God has called us
[58:36] when God called you there were certain
[58:38] promises that God made to you as an
[58:41] individual amen there are promises we
[58:43] can look at in the Bible it might look
[58:45] generic but until that promise becomes
[58:48] personal to you then it's not yours now
[58:51] when God makes that promise and it
[58:53] becomes personal to to you there are
[58:55] chances that that promise looks as if it
[58:59] will never come to pass but what is God
[59:02] looking for God is looking for Faith but
[59:05] many times when we talk about Abraham
[59:07] Abraham told us that the account of
[59:09] Abraham in Hebrews chapter 11 showed
[59:12] Abraham as a perfect person because Paul
[59:15] said that he did not starer as a promise
[59:18] of God through unbelief but was strong
[59:21] in faith giving thanks that was the
[59:24] account but if you go back and read what
[59:26] happened we have many instances where
[59:30] Abraham staggered what does that mean
[59:33] when you taking your walk with God
[59:35] you'll make mistakes but there's a
[59:37] Redemption that has happened that makes
[59:40] God not to count your mistakes and
[59:43] regardless of how many times Satan
[59:45] brings those mistakes in front of you
[59:47] and tell you you've made those mistakes
[59:49] ask ask ask Satan whose account are we
[59:52] going to
[59:53] believe amen now let's let me show you
[59:56] some of the mistakes that Abraham made
[59:58] the very first thing he did he was in
[1:00:00] the land where God said he should go to
[1:00:02] and there was famine on the land and the
[1:00:05] first thing Abraham did was to Backle
[1:00:07] but Abraham said going to Egypt is a
[1:00:10] backsliding condition now that was the
[1:00:13] first thing he did he went into a place
[1:00:15] where God said don't be there that was
[1:00:18] different from where God wanted him to
[1:00:20] be and when he got to Egypt just like it
[1:00:23] happens to us because when you take the
[1:00:25] first wrong step you're actually on your
[1:00:28] way to taking many many more wrong steps
[1:00:32] right because why you've changed
[1:00:33] direction if you're going on a straight
[1:00:36] line and you decide to just take an inch
[1:00:40] of an angle and just take a turn the
[1:00:42] farther you go the farther away you are
[1:00:46] from the path that you were on before so
[1:00:49] Abraham got to Egypt and then he looked
[1:00:51] at his 65 year-old wife who was still
[1:00:55] very pretty and the Egyptians were going
[1:00:57] to look at her and you know take her
[1:01:00] away from him and he said you know what
[1:01:03] sari we're going to a place where they
[1:01:06] don't fear God we're going to a place
[1:01:09] where I know that when they see you they
[1:01:12] know you're pretty you're 65 but you
[1:01:14] still look pretty they might want to
[1:01:16] take you away from me so here is the
[1:01:18] deal when they ask about our
[1:01:21] relationship tell them that you're my
[1:01:23] sister
[1:01:25] so he went from backsliding moving away
[1:01:28] from where God wanted him to be and he
[1:01:31] found himself telling a
[1:01:33] lie now God knows how to make things
[1:01:37] work out for good what what was what was
[1:01:40] one of the promises that God made to
[1:01:41] Abraham God said he was going to bless
[1:01:43] Abraham right Abraham did not have a
[1:01:45] thinge there was no record of Abraham
[1:01:47] being a rich man before he
[1:01:50] left where he was his father's house but
[1:01:53] when he got to Egypt and we know the
[1:01:56] story Pharaoh was told about sah Pharaoh
[1:01:59] decided to take her wanted her to become
[1:02:02] another wife and then God went and spoke
[1:02:06] to Pharaoh like you're a dead man why
[1:02:08] why are you taking someone else's wife
[1:02:10] and like a asked the question how did
[1:02:12] God speak to
[1:02:14] Pharaoh should we do a
[1:02:17] quiz but what I said to them is though
[1:02:20] Pharaoh was not serving the Living God
[1:02:24] they all had a way of communicating with
[1:02:27] divinity with the Divine one and it
[1:02:30] could have been through their um
[1:02:32] magicians or whatever they would have
[1:02:34] come to say there's something wrong in
[1:02:36] the palace you've taken what does not
[1:02:39] belong to you and maybe they will cast
[1:02:41] lot they will do all the magician stuff
[1:02:43] and then the information will come to
[1:02:45] say that this woman that you took must
[1:02:48] be someone's wife so God had a way of
[1:02:51] revealing himself to them although they
[1:02:54] did not not serve
[1:02:55] God that's my
[1:02:57] understanding now Pharaoh said to to to
[1:03:00] to Abraham why did you do this why were
[1:03:03] you going to put me in this bad spot why
[1:03:05] were you going to make me get destroyed
[1:03:07] for no
[1:03:09] reason and then Abraham said well I was
[1:03:11] afraid now God started to fulfill using
[1:03:15] that oh God is so awesome even in his
[1:03:17] backs sading condition God started to
[1:03:20] bring the promise to pass the Bible told
[1:03:23] us that Abraham was blessed by
[1:03:27] Pharaoh let me read
[1:03:30] it and Pharaoh commanded as men
[1:03:33] concerning
[1:03:34] him sorry
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:42] um
[1:03:46] okay
[1:03:47] yeah um and Abraham went up out of Egypt
[1:03:50] this is Genesis 13 he and his wife and
[1:03:53] all that he had lot with him and Abraham
[1:03:55] was very rich in cattle in silver and in
[1:03:58] Gold there must have been a place where
[1:04:01] um yeah I think I and the princess of
[1:04:03] pharaoh this is sorry verse 12 now sorry
[1:04:06] chapter 12:1 15 the princess also of
[1:04:08] pharaoh saw her and commanded her before
[1:04:10] pharaoh and the woman was taken into
[1:04:13] Pharaoh's house and he treated Abraham
[1:04:15] well for her sake so when he took his
[1:04:19] wife away from him thinking that that
[1:04:20] was a sister he started to treat Abraham
[1:04:23] well and he had sheep he blessed Abraham
[1:04:27] he brought blessings upon Abraham and
[1:04:29] Abraham had sheep and oxen and Hees and
[1:04:32] Men servants and Maid servants and shees
[1:04:35] and camels now what was God doing God
[1:04:38] started to bring his promise of blessing
[1:04:40] to pass even in the backing condition
[1:04:44] that Abraham was what does that tell me
[1:04:47] you know the song writer said and I
[1:04:49] always love this line in that old belev
[1:04:52] song He said your Shepherds elected the
[1:04:55] path you must tray what does that mean
[1:04:58] even when you are in sin it is not
[1:05:01] outside of the plan of
[1:05:05] God is it outside of the will of God yes
[1:05:08] God doesn't want us to be in sin but
[1:05:10] it's not outside of his plan because
[1:05:13] it's so he all working together for good
[1:05:16] why will Paul say that for we
[1:05:20] know that all things you know God knows
[1:05:23] how to Blindside the devil Satan is
[1:05:27] thinking is trying to put you in trouble
[1:05:29] but God is using that trouble to bring
[1:05:31] down a potential blessing why the
[1:05:34] purpose of God cannot be
[1:05:38] defeated thank do you believe that this
[1:05:41] morning are you fully persuaded this
[1:05:44] morning oh we are coming into a year
[1:05:48] that has a lot of
[1:05:50] uncertainties the American election is
[1:05:52] happening this year
[1:05:55] my daughter was asking Alexa how old is
[1:05:57] Joe
[1:05:59] Biden Alexa said he's 81 years
[1:06:02] old is
[1:06:05] fril are we going to have a woman
[1:06:07] president in America we don't know
[1:06:10] brother J was praying and telling us
[1:06:12] what's going on in
[1:06:15] Israel and we know that this thing some
[1:06:18] of those things cannot happen when we
[1:06:20] are still
[1:06:21] here there's a lot of uncertain
[1:06:24] the economies of the world they are
[1:06:28] crashing America is getting to a state
[1:06:31] where she has to go back to Rome and ask
[1:06:34] for
[1:06:35] gold so the lot of uncertainties that we
[1:06:38] should expect will happen but in the
[1:06:41] midst of all these uncertainties this is
[1:06:43] the time to be certain of God this is
[1:06:47] the time to know that your Shepherd
[1:06:49] selected the path you must tread
[1:06:51] regardless of what happens God has you
[1:06:54] taken care of some things might happen
[1:06:57] it might look as see oh the world is
[1:06:59] about to end but
[1:07:01] remember there's nothing you're going
[1:07:03] through that God did not intend to
[1:07:06] happen oh wonderful I was thinking about
[1:07:09] it this
[1:07:11] morning we are only
[1:07:14] actors in God's
[1:07:16] play now when the when did God design
[1:07:19] that play when did he write it out it
[1:07:22] was before the foundation of the world
[1:07:24] now when God did the planning those of
[1:07:26] us that work in project management and
[1:07:29] all of those stuff even those that have
[1:07:31] businesses planning is always something
[1:07:33] that's important but when you do your
[1:07:36] own planning you have to do a lot of
[1:07:38] reviews you plan you take it back you
[1:07:41] review you come back you do some
[1:07:43] analysis you come back you you review
[1:07:45] that plan you get it to a point you are
[1:07:47] implementing the plan you're you're
[1:07:49] you're still rebuilding it as as anyone
[1:07:51] ever heard the term you know building a
[1:07:53] plane whilst you're flying
[1:07:54] it but that's because we humans but when
[1:07:58] God wrote that plan in the beginning he
[1:08:00] didn't have to review it now many times
[1:08:04] we think about the plan of God and it
[1:08:05] looks like something that is far
[1:08:07] removed but however one thing you must
[1:08:10] know is that you are a little bitty
[1:08:13] piece of that
[1:08:15] plan you are a little Bey piece of that
[1:08:20] plan it's just like a like pebbles on
[1:08:23] the beach
[1:08:24] you know the ter terminology you're not
[1:08:26] the only Pebble on the beach is to make
[1:08:29] you feel like you're small but is in
[1:08:32] God's Own maybe not small maybe just to
[1:08:33] keep you humble just to remember that
[1:08:35] you're not the only one that can do what
[1:08:37] you do right right but all those Pebbles
[1:08:39] on the
[1:08:40] beach in God's own economy God
[1:08:43] identifies them God recognizes them they
[1:08:47] are all important they are so important
[1:08:50] that without them God's plan cannot be
[1:08:53] complete
[1:08:56] have you ever thought of yourself as
[1:08:57] that way that without you God's plan
[1:09:01] cannot be
[1:09:02] complete so regardless of what happens
[1:09:06] regardless of how you look at yourself
[1:09:08] you are so important to God that God
[1:09:11] cannot lose you that's why Jesus Christ
[1:09:13] said he said all that the father has
[1:09:15] given me they are what they are their
[1:09:18] mine he said no man can pluck them out
[1:09:22] of my hands Hallelujah he said why the
[1:09:24] father that gave them to me he is
[1:09:27] mightier than all so don't look at
[1:09:29] yourself as a small person don't look at
[1:09:31] yourself as someone that's not important
[1:09:33] I was thinking about it oh my
[1:09:35] goodness if Jesus Christ were to come in
[1:09:38] flesh today and he's in the City of
[1:09:40] Calgary and Jesus wanted to go to church
[1:09:44] guess where Jesus will come to he will
[1:09:47] come to the midst of the bright
[1:09:49] amen it will come it's not because
[1:09:52] others are not important
[1:09:54] but Jesus is the word and the word
[1:09:57] always attracts Jesus what happened when
[1:10:01] Jesus was 12 years old I don't know why
[1:10:03] I'm verying off but it's for
[1:10:05] somebody Jesus was 12 years
[1:10:08] old Joseph Mary's mother Jesus the rest
[1:10:13] of the family they went to Jerusalem to
[1:10:16] observe the normal custom of
[1:10:20] feast and it was time for them to go and
[1:10:24] they forgot about
[1:10:25] Jesus many times they forget about
[1:10:29] Jesus and they started joury and I
[1:10:32] believe they journeyed for three days
[1:10:34] before they looked in their company like
[1:10:36] oh we thought he was with a
[1:10:38] cousin is not with you oh the other
[1:10:41] cousin asked them is Jesus there no oh
[1:10:45] no way we must have we must have left
[1:10:46] him and they traveled back but where did
[1:10:49] they find Jesus they found Jesus with
[1:10:53] the word
[1:10:55] amen so if you want to find Jesus today
[1:10:58] if you want to know where Jesus will be
[1:11:01] Jesus will always be where the word
[1:11:06] is back to our
[1:11:09] story how am I doing with time my
[1:11:12] goodness Abraham and
[1:11:15] lot got to a point you know Abraham
[1:11:18] returned back to the land of Canaan
[1:11:19] where God you know wanted him to be
[1:11:21] initially after he left Egypt now he
[1:11:24] returned with blessing amen he started
[1:11:26] to transfer that blessing part of that
[1:11:29] blessing over to his nephew to lot they
[1:11:32] started to increase now they increased
[1:11:35] to a state where it was impossible for
[1:11:38] them to
[1:11:40] cohabit because the herzman of lot and
[1:11:44] the Hersman of Abraham started fighting
[1:11:46] we don't know exactly what we're
[1:11:47] fighting over it could be like oh no
[1:11:49] that well is supposed to be for us you
[1:11:51] know we have not F that camels and
[1:11:54] you're talking about feeding your camels
[1:11:56] there was a conflict that
[1:11:57] happened now something else I was stting
[1:11:59] to think about this morning I've not
[1:12:01] done enough study but I felt it was also
[1:12:05] part of the Walk that Abraham was having
[1:12:09] with God and if we look at second Peter
[1:12:12] chapter 1 and brother BR preed that
[1:12:14] message the statue of a perfect
[1:12:16] B brother Abraham told us that how to
[1:12:19] build the house that God lives in is
[1:12:23] those
[1:12:25] virtues he also made us to understand
[1:12:27] that it is a walk with God it's a
[1:12:30] process of
[1:12:32] becoming someone that gets to the
[1:12:35] stature of a perfect
[1:12:38] man and brother B will also explain that
[1:12:41] perfect in the sense of how it was used
[1:12:43] in the Bible was not sinless it was
[1:12:45] perfect in terms of
[1:12:51] completion now God taught Abraham Faith
[1:12:54] from the very first time God called him
[1:12:58] because he only took faith if God had
[1:12:59] told Abraham where he was going he would
[1:13:02] not need faith if I say go come go with
[1:13:04] me and say where are we going like we're
[1:13:06] going downtown oh downtown I've been
[1:13:07] there before let's go he wouldn't take
[1:13:10] Faith it wasn't require it wouldn't
[1:13:13] require Faith but God did not tell him
[1:13:15] where he was going God gave him promises
[1:13:17] that he couldn't bring to pass but he
[1:13:20] was persuaded enough to know that this
[1:13:21] God that made the promise he can fulfill
[1:13:23] it that was Faith now God brought him to
[1:13:27] a place of trial and what was God trying
[1:13:30] to do trying to see his brotherly
[1:13:36] kindness that's all the way up that's
[1:13:38] why I said I'm not done the study oh
[1:13:39] probably can fix you know the gaps in
[1:13:42] between but at this time God was
[1:13:44] teaching Abraham brotherly kindness now
[1:13:48] who was the promise given to was it lot
[1:13:50] or was given to Abraham it was given to
[1:13:52] Abraham
[1:13:54] and Abraham got to that
[1:13:56] point where he had to Humble
[1:14:00] himself Abraham was the older one was
[1:14:03] supposed to make the choice first but he
[1:14:05] said to lot he said you look at the land
[1:14:07] it's before us you choose where you want
[1:14:11] to
[1:14:11] go now there's so many lessons here and
[1:14:14] I just want to quickly point out the
[1:14:16] lesson that we can also take from
[1:14:19] lot lot looked by sight
[1:14:24] he looked at the plains he found the
[1:14:27] areas that were green that had good
[1:14:29] vegetation for their
[1:14:31] animals and when he left the Bible said
[1:14:34] he pitched his tent towards Sodom he did
[1:14:39] not go into
[1:14:40] Sodom he pitched his tent towards
[1:14:44] Sodom he went very close to sin but
[1:14:47] never really got into sin but fast
[1:14:50] forward to the time after this after
[1:14:52] that se oparation had happened that
[1:14:56] where he was we were told in the Bible
[1:14:59] that there was a fight between some
[1:15:00] Kings and lot and his family were taken
[1:15:03] captive when the Bible was giving us
[1:15:05] that record the Bible told us that lot
[1:15:08] was in
[1:15:09] Sodom so initially was close to Sodom
[1:15:13] but he gradually moved closer until he
[1:15:16] found himself in Sodom we're not going
[1:15:19] to the details of what but we know what
[1:15:21] Sodom is we know how the men and the
[1:15:24] women of Sodom brought God to a level of
[1:15:28] disgust that God couldn't contain it
[1:15:31] anymore that he had to destroy sudom so
[1:15:33] God taught Abraham brotherly kindness
[1:15:37] from the first time he had to make that
[1:15:38] choice and from the other time he had to
[1:15:40] go rescue now at the time when Abraham
[1:15:44] finally separated
[1:15:48] himself from every unbeliever the Bram
[1:15:51] said God came and reaffirm the
[1:15:55] promise so as we keep
[1:15:58] going we found that that God changed
[1:16:01] that promise from just a promise to a
[1:16:04] covenant
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:11] hallelujah if it was just a promise it
[1:16:13] was it was okay God will still fulfill
[1:16:17] it but David said what is
[1:16:20] man that you even consider
[1:16:24] am but God wanted to take it from just a
[1:16:27] promise to a state where just as we
[1:16:31] humans will make our promises to each
[1:16:33] other and you say oh you promis this no
[1:16:35] I want you to sign the document we want
[1:16:36] a
[1:16:37] contract God said I'm going to do it the
[1:16:39] way you do it as humans I'm going to
[1:16:42] make it Covenant so God said to
[1:16:44] Abraham take an eeper 3year
[1:16:48] old take a she goat 3year old take a ram
[1:16:52] 3-year-old
[1:16:53] take a young pigeon and take
[1:16:57] a was the last
[1:16:59] one tole
[1:17:01] do
[1:17:03] sorry back to our our living
[1:17:07] room it's it's it's interesting because
[1:17:09] we're going through this study as well
[1:17:10] at home and it's interesting
[1:17:13] to to to be to be you know remembering
[1:17:17] some of those things we were talking
[1:17:18] about now God told him like those first
[1:17:21] three the hea the sheot and the ram said
[1:17:25] when you kill them divide
[1:17:27] them but don't do the same to the the
[1:17:30] birds now but BR explained to us that in
[1:17:34] their time the way they made
[1:17:36] covenants is that they will WR it on the
[1:17:39] sheet of
[1:17:40] paper they will tear it into two one
[1:17:44] takes this the other takes that then
[1:17:46] they will bring an animal kill the
[1:17:49] animal divide it into two what are they
[1:17:52] saying if if I fill my part of the
[1:17:54] promise let me be like this
[1:17:59] animalall now the thing about this
[1:18:01] Covenant that God made it was an
[1:18:04] unconditional
[1:18:08] Covenant there were other covenants that
[1:18:10] God made the Mosaic Covenant when God
[1:18:13] made it it was based on you know you do
[1:18:16] this it was based on the law if you do
[1:18:18] this this is if you go to Deuteronomy
[1:18:20] you will see what Moses said if you do
[1:18:23] do this God will bless you if you do
[1:18:24] that God will curse you but right before
[1:18:27] even that happened because we are not
[1:18:30] connected to the Mosaic Covenant we are
[1:18:33] connected to the abrahamic Covenant
[1:18:36] before God will ever bring the law God
[1:18:38] already gave us an unconditional
[1:18:41] Covenant brother said that God did not
[1:18:43] base it on what man can do because every
[1:18:46] time that God tried to make a covenant
[1:18:48] with man man
[1:18:51] failed amen he knows our fry he knows we
[1:18:55] are humans he knows we can't keep our
[1:18:57] promises remember that song remind me
[1:19:00] dear Lord I know I am human and humans
[1:19:03] forget and God made that
[1:19:06] Covenant upon the basis of him being
[1:19:10] able to fulfill it Abraham had nothing
[1:19:13] to do and God said if I don't fulfill
[1:19:16] this Covenant let me be like this hea
[1:19:18] that's been killed and divided into two
[1:19:20] let me be like this Ram that's been
[1:19:22] killed and divided to you let me be like
[1:19:24] this she goat can God die no God cannot
[1:19:27] die that's
[1:19:30] right and that was not
[1:19:34] enough God gave a sign Hallelujah he
[1:19:38] said I've giving you the Covenant you
[1:19:41] know I will not fail the Bible said by
[1:19:43] two immutable
[1:19:45] things in which he was impossible for
[1:19:48] God to
[1:19:49] lie Hallelujah by two IM mutable things
[1:19:52] in which it was impossible for God to
[1:19:54] lie we might have a strong consolation
[1:19:58] that's right those of us that have fled
[1:20:00] for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope
[1:20:03] Hallelujah that set before
[1:20:05] us so what was that sign it was a sign
[1:20:08] of
[1:20:10] circumcision why is it important to say
[1:20:12] this brother brah said somebody came and
[1:20:14] said to him that you know Abraham
[1:20:16] believed God and he was imputed unto him
[1:20:19] for righteousness what more can you do
[1:20:21] than to believe God Abraham said that's
[1:20:24] correct but that was not enough because
[1:20:26] the person that was saying Abraham
[1:20:28] believed God and he was imputed felt
[1:20:30] that once you believe because there was
[1:20:32] a Doctrine at the time that when you
[1:20:33] believe you have received the Holy
[1:20:36] Ghost but brother Braham said that he
[1:20:39] didn't just do that God did something
[1:20:43] else he gave a sign of
[1:20:46] circumcision that sign was to separate
[1:20:49] those that had the Covenant from those
[1:20:51] that did not have the Covenant if you
[1:20:54] have the Covenant what God wants you to
[1:20:57] do to prove you have the Covenant is to
[1:20:59] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:02] that is why it is important that is why
[1:21:04] brother Braham preached the message
[1:21:06] token and said this is the highlight of
[1:21:09] my Ministry
[1:21:11] amen you must receive the
[1:21:13] token that is the sign of the
[1:21:16] Covenant let me quickly read brother BR
[1:21:18] to you faith of Abraham paragraph 16 it
[1:21:22] say said now the reason I chose Abraham
[1:21:24] because that was the promise made to
[1:21:25] Abraham we all know that God made
[1:21:28] covenants with man and man always breaks
[1:21:31] his Covenant with God so in the case of
[1:21:35] Abraham God made the Covenant with
[1:21:37] himself and Abraham
[1:21:40] unconditionally you know he said to Adam
[1:21:42] in the adamic Covenant if you will not
[1:21:44] do this and if you'll do that you know
[1:21:47] he said if you the day you eat thereof
[1:21:49] that day you shall surely die it was it
[1:21:51] was it was based on a condition
[1:21:53] right he said Adam turned right around
[1:21:57] and broke it but in Abraham it wasn't if
[1:22:01] you do anything it is I have done
[1:22:07] hallelujah it's already a past tense
[1:22:10] Abraham had nothing to do with it it was
[1:22:14] God that did it you have nothing to do
[1:22:18] with it it is God that did it the reason
[1:22:21] why you are here this morning is that
[1:22:23] something pulled you I was praying in
[1:22:25] the room I said Lord your people are
[1:22:27] coming on a day that's cold like this I
[1:22:29] said maybe there are some of them that
[1:22:30] are only here because their parents said
[1:22:32] they should come but they still
[1:22:33] came there might be some people that are
[1:22:36] here because they're thinking oh if I
[1:22:37] don't come someone's going to call me
[1:22:38] why didn't you come to church but they
[1:22:40] still came there's something that you
[1:22:42] used to set the condition right for them
[1:22:45] to be in church and those that are not
[1:22:48] here that are streaming as well there
[1:22:49] was a desire in their heart to switch on
[1:22:52] their device rise and stream and hear
[1:22:54] the word of God so that shows me that
[1:22:57] God is pulling something inside of you
[1:23:00] there's a pool that is responding to a
[1:23:02] pool there is a deep that is responding
[1:23:04] to a deep God is making you know that
[1:23:07] I've got something for you you come
[1:23:09] receive
[1:23:10] it it has nothing to do what what with
[1:23:13] what you can do we cannot draw ourselves
[1:23:16] to him he the one that draws himself to
[1:23:18] us when he draws himself to us he does
[1:23:21] the work
[1:23:23] what is rest seasoning from your own
[1:23:28] Works
[1:23:30] Hallelujah but said but in Abraham it
[1:23:33] wasn't if you do anything it's I have
[1:23:35] done it's already a past tense Abraham
[1:23:39] had nothing to do with it it was God
[1:23:41] that did it and now I want you to notice
[1:23:43] this three nights as we go through it
[1:23:46] wasn't only to
[1:23:48] Abraham but it was to Abraham's seed
[1:23:52] amen remember it didn't say seeds it
[1:23:55] said seed as in
[1:23:57] singular amen and our hair according to
[1:24:02] the promise sorry I read it
[1:24:05] wrong it was to Abraham's seed Abraham's
[1:24:08] children the Covenant was made to
[1:24:11] Abraham and his children abrah said well
[1:24:13] you say that will be Jews no we've been
[1:24:16] in Christ we take on Abraham's seed
[1:24:20] because Christ was that seed and here
[1:24:22] with him according to the promise we are
[1:24:24] Abraham's seed if we are dead in Christ
[1:24:26] we become Abraham's seed and at her
[1:24:30] according to the promise therefore that
[1:24:33] every person that's been born again of
[1:24:34] the Holy Spirit truly born not just
[1:24:37] thought they were born right not went
[1:24:40] through some emotion not went through
[1:24:42] some sensation but was truly borned they
[1:24:46] could have all the emotion sensation
[1:24:49] with it but you could have the sensation
[1:24:52] and emotion and not be
[1:24:56] born you can have the emotion and The
[1:24:59] Sensation and be born but you could also
[1:25:01] have the emotion and The Sensation and
[1:25:02] not be born so what is most important is
[1:25:06] the birth itself regardless of how it
[1:25:08] happens but Abraham said every breath is
[1:25:10] a mess for some they're quiet when the
[1:25:13] mess is
[1:25:14] happening for others wow you know when
[1:25:18] you were in the in the hospital and the
[1:25:20] babies have been delivered some babies
[1:25:22] would just
[1:25:24] cry and that's all
[1:25:29] some sorry did I scream sorry the
[1:25:32] monitors are not laughing loud enough
[1:25:35] I'm sorry if I startled
[1:25:38] anyone but the question is is the Baby
[1:25:41] Alive did the birth happen and that's
[1:25:44] whatam is saying here you could have all
[1:25:46] the sensation and the emotion and not be
[1:25:48] born but those who are borned of the
[1:25:50] spirit of God are Abraham's seed Not
[1:25:54] seeds but seed the promised seed for
[1:25:59] it's true Christ which was the son of
[1:26:01] Abraham if you can get a hold of this
[1:26:04] said then if we are Abraham's seed we've
[1:26:06] got to have the faith of
[1:26:12] Abraham a lion gives birth to a
[1:26:17] lion if we are the Seed of Abraham we
[1:26:20] have got to have the attribute of
[1:26:22] Abraham what was the attribute of
[1:26:23] Abraham the faith of Abraham to believe
[1:26:26] God for something that was
[1:26:29] impossible brothers and sisters take a
[1:26:32] moment and think of something you think
[1:26:33] is
[1:26:35] impossible sister Amber you might look
[1:26:38] impossible for your children to be
[1:26:42] saved but if that's your promise it's
[1:26:46] yours make up your mind that in 2024 you
[1:26:50] are holding on to that promise amen
[1:26:53] anyone that's in that situation hold on
[1:26:55] to that promise the same way Abraham did
[1:27:00] tell the devil I am a Seed of Abraham I
[1:27:03] have the attribute of Abraham when
[1:27:05] Abraham was in a situation like mine the
[1:27:07] reaction of Abraham was that he believed
[1:27:10] God he counted him that promise
[1:27:14] faithful oh blessed be the name of the
[1:27:18] Lord if we are Abraham's seed we've got
[1:27:20] to have the faith of Abraham
[1:27:22] and the Bible said he was like God
[1:27:25] hallelujah Abraham was not just having
[1:27:27] that Faith because it wasn't just his
[1:27:29] faith the Bible told us that is it was
[1:27:31] the faith of God that God put in Abraham
[1:27:35] and if we are SE of Abraham if we are
[1:27:37] children of Abraham if we are children
[1:27:39] of God God has put that same faith in us
[1:27:42] all we need to do is to recognize it and
[1:27:46] put it into action amen you love the
[1:27:48] Lord this
[1:27:50] morning the Bible said he was like God
[1:27:52] God that he called those things which
[1:27:55] were not as though they were because God
[1:27:59] said so
[1:28:01] hallah now when God was
[1:28:04] deciding to make you his child you were
[1:28:08] not
[1:28:10] there a story that we all
[1:28:14] know was about the natural son of
[1:28:18] Abraham
[1:28:19] Isaac when his wife reaka could not have
[1:28:22] children for a long time he turned to
[1:28:24] God and prayed and God answered his
[1:28:28] prayer and Rebecca became pregnant with
[1:28:31] two boys and the Bible made us to know
[1:28:35] that before those children were born
[1:28:38] before they will ever do any evil or
[1:28:41] good God came to to Rebecca and said
[1:28:45] Rebecca you've got two nations in your
[1:28:48] womb and they always fighting against
[1:28:50] each other now the two are fighting
[1:28:53] against each other there's one of them
[1:28:55] that I love and the other one I
[1:29:02] hate Paul said is there unrighteousness
[1:29:05] in
[1:29:07] God but by God's forn
[1:29:10] knowledge by God seeing the future right
[1:29:13] from the beginning he saw those ones
[1:29:16] that were his seed he saw those ones
[1:29:19] that will be partakers of the divine
[1:29:21] nature
[1:29:22] and whenever you are becoming a partaker
[1:29:24] of the divine nature showing God's
[1:29:27] attribute it brings more love of God to
[1:29:29] you and it's the opposite when someone
[1:29:32] is displaying the attribute of Satan God
[1:29:35] hates the person you said that's a
[1:29:37] strong word but that's what God said
[1:29:40] that's
[1:29:43] right Romans 9:11 for the children be
[1:29:47] not yet born neither having done any
[1:29:49] good or evil oh I love this
[1:29:53] that the purpose of God according to
[1:29:56] election might stand amen now brothers
[1:29:59] and
[1:30:00] sisters you are a purpose of God
[1:30:06] am I don't think you heard
[1:30:09] me you are a purpose of
[1:30:15] God what what makes us doubt that is
[1:30:19] because our imagination is limited said
[1:30:22] to when we were born and when we
[1:30:26] die brother brah will preach somewhere
[1:30:29] when he started talking about you know
[1:30:32] predestination he said let's take a
[1:30:36] trip to before anything was ever
[1:30:39] formed and let's take a tribute to the
[1:30:41] mind of God and let's start to think
[1:30:43] about what was in the mind of God and he
[1:30:46] said God have attributes and those
[1:30:49] attributes that God had are you and and
[1:30:53] me meaning that years I don't know
[1:30:56] millions and trillions of years
[1:30:58] scientists would tell us about millions
[1:30:59] of years I don't know if they can ever
[1:31:01] count you know what was before before
[1:31:03] the beginning right but said Genesis one
[1:31:06] said in the beginning was the the
[1:31:09] beginning God made the heavens and the
[1:31:10] Earth and he said we don't know how long
[1:31:12] that took just said foot stop amen
[1:31:16] hallelujah and they started talking
[1:31:17] about this Earth was without form
[1:31:19] brother brah said there was a wall that
[1:31:21] existed before and then God destroyed it
[1:31:24] and made the world that we are living in
[1:31:26] now but what I want you to know that
[1:31:29] you're a purpose of God Amen and God
[1:31:31] elected you and that election can never
[1:31:35] change there is no way you are going to
[1:31:38] be in trouble and remember that you are
[1:31:41] a purpose of God and still be
[1:31:43] sad there is no way you're are going to
[1:31:46] have dismay and remember that you were
[1:31:48] in the plan of God and still feel
[1:31:50] dejected there is no way you are going
[1:31:52] to have a
[1:31:54] need and then remember that you are
[1:31:57] God's child and still start crying why
[1:32:00] because you know your father is the one
[1:32:03] that that does what amen what what what
[1:32:06] what did David
[1:32:07] say sorry I'm being on my unlike myself
[1:32:10] today but I hope it's
[1:32:12] okay David said he has the cattle on a
[1:32:16] thousand
[1:32:18] hills I think someone tried to do the
[1:32:20] math
[1:32:23] it didn't say on one
[1:32:26] Hill cattle on a thousand
[1:32:29] hills many times we think that being a
[1:32:32] message believer means you will always
[1:32:34] be in
[1:32:35] need we can't have Rich message
[1:32:38] Believers you can't ask God for money
[1:32:41] that is
[1:32:42] natural I beg to
[1:32:46] defer I beg to differ because when God
[1:32:49] said he was going to bless Abraham God
[1:32:52] did not limit it to spiritual
[1:32:54] blessing God blessed Abraham with
[1:32:56] physical blessing as well how will the
[1:32:59] work of God progress if everyone in the
[1:33:02] church is poor how will the work of God
[1:33:06] progress but God decides to bless
[1:33:09] you so that you can bring that that
[1:33:11] bless oh I don't have that scripture but
[1:33:13] Paul was saying to the rich he said the
[1:33:16] reason why God blessed you is so you can
[1:33:18] bless
[1:33:20] others amen so that if there are
[1:33:25] needs we can be instruments in the hands
[1:33:28] of
[1:33:29] God we can be
[1:33:33] providers we can step into that
[1:33:35] attribute of God that attribute that is
[1:33:38] called Jehovah
[1:33:39] jir hallah and though is my brother that
[1:33:42] is given me that need I know that I have
[1:33:45] prayed for it I know I've trusted God
[1:33:47] for it and I know it was God that put it
[1:33:49] in my in the heart of my brother to give
[1:33:51] that need to me
[1:33:53] why why because it's Jehovah
[1:33:57] amen but theam said anytime that God
[1:34:00] wants to act he uses
[1:34:02] man anytime Satan wants to act he uses
[1:34:05] man if God ever descent here we cannot
[1:34:08] stand the presence of
[1:34:10] God but that's why God always hidees
[1:34:12] himself behind a man a badger skin to
[1:34:15] make it easy for us to be able to touch
[1:34:18] God he said god with skin on it remember
[1:34:21] that
[1:34:22] story God will skin on
[1:34:27] it so you're an attribute of God you are
[1:34:30] here for a purpose you are here to
[1:34:32] fulfill a purpose the sooner you
[1:34:35] understand that the more you find
[1:34:38] yourself doing exactly what God wants
[1:34:39] you to do the more everything you do in
[1:34:42] your life when you go to work when you
[1:34:45] are with your family all the callings of
[1:34:47] your life you will not see it I'm just
[1:34:49] I'm just you w't see it like I'm just
[1:34:50] I'm just following regular routine right
[1:34:54] brother Joel might be taking photos but
[1:34:56] that's the Holy Spirit taking photos
[1:34:58] Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah amen
[1:35:02] oh
[1:35:04] wonderful brother Paul you renovating
[1:35:07] houses but that's God coming in the
[1:35:10] flesh to do that am when he does it you
[1:35:13] will see Perfection amen maybe the
[1:35:15] client is not happy and when they're
[1:35:17] going to call you they're going to think
[1:35:18] that you're going to you know start to
[1:35:20] defend yourself and you say to them no
[1:35:22] worries we'll fix it like which man
[1:35:24] could do
[1:35:32] that let's talk about the son of
[1:35:35] prosperity his name was
[1:35:38] Joseph life was hard for him at the
[1:35:41] start he wasn't the one that brought the
[1:35:43] dreams to
[1:35:45] himself God gave him
[1:35:47] dreams and the only thing the small boy
[1:35:50] could do was just to tell his dreams
[1:35:51] dreams to his parents and to his
[1:35:54] siblings and they hated him for it it
[1:35:57] was not in his power to bring the dreams
[1:35:59] to
[1:36:01] pass the only thing is those Brothers
[1:36:03] they felt
[1:36:06] threatened because they also knew that
[1:36:08] he was a faithful guy he was a righteous
[1:36:10] guy it will always tell on them when
[1:36:13] they did what was
[1:36:14] wrong and that made them to hit him the
[1:36:19] more now when God God was going to
[1:36:22] fulfill that plan it was not a Bed of
[1:36:26] Roses God knows how to take us through
[1:36:28] the Crooked pathway that's right I've
[1:36:31] said this a few times but you know that
[1:36:34] the Bible said actually told us that God
[1:36:38] is the Alpha and the
[1:36:41] Omega he said is nothing in
[1:36:47] between what that means is that when God
[1:36:50] sees it God is only looking at the end
[1:36:54] God is not moved by what happens in
[1:36:56] between because he is fully persuaded
[1:36:59] that the promise I made will come to
[1:37:01] pass
[1:37:05] amen so God is not moved by all that
[1:37:08] happens and Joseph went from being sold
[1:37:11] as a slave to strangers to becoming you
[1:37:15] know a a a slave in the house of
[1:37:18] somebody that served pharaoh to be lied
[1:37:21] upon to being told that you know you you
[1:37:24] you you you you you did something that
[1:37:26] his imagination could not
[1:37:29] take you know sometimes when someone is
[1:37:31] accused of something that they could
[1:37:33] potentially do it doesn't feel that bad
[1:37:36] you say oh I didn't do it I didn't do it
[1:37:38] this
[1:37:39] time kids you
[1:37:42] remember when you took the
[1:37:44] chocolate right you know I wasn't the
[1:37:47] one that took CH you did it cuz you did
[1:37:48] it the last time no but I didn't do it
[1:37:51] you did it and then you look oh Dad Dad
[1:37:54] accused me of something I didn't do but
[1:37:55] you could potentially have done it but
[1:37:57] think about something that you could
[1:37:59] never have
[1:38:01] done and someone accuses you of
[1:38:04] it think about the hurt that Joseph
[1:38:08] felt and Not only was he accused of it
[1:38:11] he had to face the
[1:38:13] punishment it's reading in the news the
[1:38:15] other day some men that were you know
[1:38:18] went to prison and uh they've been in
[1:38:20] prison for 40 something years I guess 75
[1:38:23] year old man and now the judge says oh
[1:38:26] I'm sorry you actually never did it that
[1:38:27] was
[1:38:28] Injustice where does he start
[1:38:32] from he's lost perhaps 40 years or more
[1:38:35] of his life for something he never
[1:38:39] did so that's how Joseph felt but as
[1:38:42] Joseph was in that prison the calling of
[1:38:46] God upon his life could not
[1:38:50] hide the purpose of God in his life
[1:38:52] could not
[1:38:54] hide that gift that God had given him
[1:38:57] could not be
[1:38:58] hidden if you plant a lily but made us
[1:39:02] to understand it's got to come through a
[1:39:04] lot before he can come
[1:39:07] out but there's a power that is pushing
[1:39:10] it through all the struggles that power
[1:39:12] is pushing it where is the power pushing
[1:39:14] him towards he pushing him towards the
[1:39:17] promise he pushing it towards the
[1:39:19] purpose of his life amen when we in high
[1:39:21] school baby Elementary School we did an
[1:39:23] experiment I don't know if the kids
[1:39:25] still do it but you take a box dark box
[1:39:30] put a plant in it no actually put you
[1:39:33] know um a pot in it a small pot your
[1:39:36] plant maybe corner or something in it
[1:39:38] and then you make a little opening
[1:39:42] somewhere for lights to come in now by
[1:39:47] Nature that seed that is inside the soil
[1:39:52] is looking for light for it to
[1:39:54] grow and you realize that as it starts
[1:39:57] to grow it starts to point towards where
[1:40:00] that light is coming from and that is
[1:40:04] the same thing that that that that
[1:40:06] happens in the life of a Believer the
[1:40:08] light which is the word of God is your
[1:40:10] compass is what you're growing towards
[1:40:13] is what you are responding
[1:40:15] to amen so Joseph was responding to that
[1:40:19] promise and though it took a long
[1:40:22] time God brought that promise to
[1:40:25] pass remember that when he was in the
[1:40:28] prison and those two servants of pharaoh
[1:40:32] the Porter and the baker had their
[1:40:34] dreams and came to him and he told them
[1:40:37] the the meaning of their dreams and then
[1:40:39] they went down and he kept thinking why
[1:40:41] will the porter forget
[1:40:44] me why will he forget me it's been two
[1:40:47] years he hasn't remembered but if he had
[1:40:50] remembered ear
[1:40:52] earlier Joseph would have become the
[1:40:56] prince because Pharaoh wouldn't have had
[1:40:58] the dream at that
[1:40:59] time because the vision is yet for an
[1:41:03] appointed
[1:41:05] time the vision is yet for an appointed
[1:41:09] time he said but at the end
[1:41:14] hallelujah oh is there something that
[1:41:16] you have laid before the Lord and it
[1:41:19] looks like it's lingering
[1:41:22] there's that job that he said Lord this
[1:41:25] is the type of job I
[1:41:27] want looks like my career is taunted
[1:41:30] looks like I'm not getting the growth I
[1:41:32] want this is what it is you've applied
[1:41:35] and applied and applied and applied and
[1:41:37] is all
[1:41:38] rejections I want to tell you this
[1:41:40] morning the vision is for an appointed
[1:41:45] time but at the end it shall speak amen
[1:41:49] and not lie amen he said though it t to
[1:41:53] man it is taring to man it looks like
[1:41:56] you're waiting to man it looks like it's
[1:41:59] it's it's it's supposed to have happened
[1:42:00] why hasn't it happened he said wait for
[1:42:04] it amen wait for it don't wait in
[1:42:07] complain continue to wait in Praise
[1:42:11] continue to thank the Lord whatever you
[1:42:14] looking for you're looking for children
[1:42:16] God is able to give it to you Hallelujah
[1:42:20] you know for Abraham when God finally
[1:42:22] was going to bring that promise of Isaac
[1:42:24] to pass God visited him a year
[1:42:27] before and said to him according to the
[1:42:30] time of
[1:42:32] life Sarah will bring forth the child
[1:42:35] and his name will be
[1:42:38] Isaac you can imagine Abraham and Sarah
[1:42:41] when they were buying the things for the
[1:42:43] baby they had a name on it put the name
[1:42:46] Isaac on it because we know that that
[1:42:48] baby is coming amen the one that made
[1:42:51] the promise he is faithful amen you can
[1:42:54] already start to buy your baby things
[1:42:56] and put the name you desire on those
[1:42:58] things start to make God know that you
[1:43:01] are in Preparation to receive the
[1:43:04] promise that he has made to
[1:43:08] you the vision is for an appointed
[1:43:11] time but it will surely come am it will
[1:43:15] not
[1:43:19] h we talk about amrah and
[1:43:22] joked we don't have all the
[1:43:25] time let's talk about a man that faced
[1:43:29] the greatest trial in the Bible
[1:43:34] job he was a man
[1:43:36] that the Bible said he was
[1:43:41] righteous you couldn't lay any charge to
[1:43:44] him he had seven sons and three
[1:43:47] daughters and because he was a rich man
[1:43:51] the richest man in the eastern part of
[1:43:53] the world at that
[1:43:55] time his sons had money and they will
[1:43:58] throw parties at their homes and his
[1:44:01] daughters will attend probably his
[1:44:03] daughters stayed with him in his house
[1:44:05] but his sons all had their own
[1:44:08] houses and he didn't know what was going
[1:44:11] on but he wanted to keep his house
[1:44:15] spotless as much as possible and he knew
[1:44:18] at that time that Jehovah had a remedy
[1:44:22] for sin if anyone had committed sin the
[1:44:25] way to come and get forgiveness of sin
[1:44:28] is to kill an animal and regardless of
[1:44:31] whether he could confirm it or not job
[1:44:33] will always do a sacrifice perform a
[1:44:37] sacrifice after they had their get
[1:44:41] togethers and God was proud of
[1:44:43] him but one
[1:44:45] day the accuser of the Brethren also
[1:44:48] came with the sons of God before God
[1:44:51] and God likes to brag about his
[1:44:54] children have you ever had that had that
[1:44:57] feeling when you do something right that
[1:44:59] the holy spirit is just pleased with you
[1:45:01] that the Holy Spirit just feels like
[1:45:03] bragging about you that the Holy Spirit
[1:45:05] just likes the way you responded to that
[1:45:07] person when they said something very
[1:45:08] wrong to
[1:45:11] you and maybe your husband or your
[1:45:15] wife oh you have to be honest it happens
[1:45:19] all the time
[1:45:21] I always say that that virtue of
[1:45:24] patience get into
[1:45:28] marriage and then you will go through
[1:45:30] the process of being being brought into
[1:45:33] that maturity
[1:45:34] level of
[1:45:37] patience I know I'm not the same as I
[1:45:40] was 12 years ago when we just got
[1:45:44] married so
[1:45:46] job God started to brag about him to the
[1:45:49] devil
[1:45:51] and the devil said to God the only
[1:45:54] reason why job is serving you is because
[1:45:57] of the
[1:45:59] riches now God knew that job wasn't
[1:46:02] serving him because of the
[1:46:03] riches it was God's choice to bless
[1:46:07] job God wanted to
[1:46:11] have a John
[1:46:14] Charis God wanted to have a Cosmos
[1:46:18] magika on the earth at that time that
[1:46:21] will have enough money and will be a
[1:46:26] representation and an
[1:46:28] example and a curse to those that will
[1:46:31] have their money and not serve God so
[1:46:34] that on the day of judgment when someone
[1:46:36] will say Lord the reason I did not serve
[1:46:38] you is because you blessed me with money
[1:46:41] God will say John charot come CU M come
[1:46:46] were you a billionaire on Earth yes I
[1:46:49] was and you still preach on the streets
[1:46:52] the streets of
[1:46:53] Lagos yes I
[1:46:57] did and God will say look at that
[1:47:00] man that's my
[1:47:03] son he had all the
[1:47:06] riches he could mess his life up he
[1:47:08] could do whatever whatever he wanted to
[1:47:09] do but he decided to serve me so God had
[1:47:13] job on Earth as a testimony of a rich
[1:47:16] man that will not deny God that will use
[1:47:19] his rich is for God
[1:47:23] Amen and God said well if you don't
[1:47:26] believe me it's not hard I'll take away
[1:47:29] the riches you go take away the riches
[1:47:33] but don't touch him that's
[1:47:35] right and the worst Calamity that could
[1:47:38] ever happen to a human being happened to
[1:47:42] job in one
[1:47:44] day but what was job's
[1:47:48] response job said the the lord giveth am
[1:47:52] the lord taketh away job recognized the
[1:47:56] source of his
[1:47:59] riches some people have money but they
[1:48:02] think the source is their hard
[1:48:04] work you ever hear people talk about oh
[1:48:07] I've worked so hard that's the only
[1:48:09] reason I'm here I made this business
[1:48:14] work brother Justice and sister Sharon
[1:48:16] was showing us a video
[1:48:18] yesterday of a guy that was being
[1:48:22] interviewed from just a situation that
[1:48:25] happened he made $16
[1:48:27] million and they were asking him do you
[1:48:29] have an advice for young people how to
[1:48:32] make money he
[1:48:34] said no let your Source be God if I will
[1:48:39] paraphrase let your Source be God like
[1:48:43] is there any other trick any other way
[1:48:44] no just you just keep your relationship
[1:48:47] with God know where your source is if
[1:48:50] your source is God then you will know
[1:48:53] that whether those riches remain or they
[1:48:56] don't the god that gave the riches is
[1:48:58] able to replenish
[1:49:01] again how many people commit suicide
[1:49:03] because their business is filled a lot
[1:49:05] of
[1:49:06] people but when you know that it's from
[1:49:10] God if God takes it away you have to
[1:49:12] know that there's a purpose for it and
[1:49:15] the god that took it away he's able to
[1:49:17] bring it back am so the devil convinced
[1:49:20] you know made God to say you know you
[1:49:21] can take his riches away and then the
[1:49:23] next day Satan came again God said well
[1:49:25] you took his riches away he's still
[1:49:27] serving me said well you know when a man
[1:49:30] is well well well in his body he's
[1:49:33] always fine but you let me touch his
[1:49:35] health and he will curse you to your
[1:49:39] face now as this conversation was going
[1:49:42] on job was not aware of
[1:49:45] it right right God did not explain to
[1:49:49] job what that
[1:49:53] happened brother BR
[1:49:55] preached he didn't it wasn't recorded
[1:49:58] but it told us that he preed job and the
[1:50:01] hash ape for six weeks and a sister came
[1:50:04] and
[1:50:06] said when are you going to take job off
[1:50:09] of the harsh
[1:50:11] AP said when the Holy Spirit leads me
[1:50:14] to but I never understood how it'll take
[1:50:17] brother Braham six weeks to preach about
[1:50:19] job on the asip until I recently took
[1:50:22] another study of the Book of Job right
[1:50:25] amen and this time sorry if you don't
[1:50:28] agree with me but this time I listened
[1:50:31] to it in the NLT
[1:50:34] version just to be able to hear it in an
[1:50:38] English that is closer to the English we
[1:50:40] speak today this day and age to make me
[1:50:45] appreciate the agony of
[1:50:49] job
[1:50:50] the first thing that job had to deal
[1:50:52] with is that when his friends came after
[1:50:55] his misery he had I don't know what I I
[1:50:58] try to Google it like does science even
[1:51:00] know what disease he had because he had
[1:51:03] balls over his body there were pores
[1:51:05] coming out he couldn't even sit on on a
[1:51:08] wooden bench or anything he had to pile
[1:51:10] up Ashes to sit on to be comfortable
[1:51:13] just a little
[1:51:15] bit and the Bible said when his friends
[1:51:17] came and saw him in that condition no
[1:51:20] one could speak for seven
[1:51:24] days imagine going to see someone that
[1:51:26] you knew a rich man in a hospital
[1:51:30] bed and they just a shadow of
[1:51:34] themselves they couldn't speak for seven
[1:51:37] days and job started to speak to express
[1:51:40] his mind which we're going to quickly go
[1:51:42] into but I want to to just look at
[1:51:46] quickly I want us to quickly look at
[1:51:48] what responses this man that needed
[1:51:51] Comfort what sort of responses did he
[1:51:53] get from his friends pardon me I'll be
[1:51:55] reading from the analy version the first
[1:51:58] friend elifa said will you be patient
[1:52:01] and let me say a
[1:52:03] word for who could keep from speaking
[1:52:06] out in the past you have encouraged many
[1:52:09] people you have strengthened those who
[1:52:11] were weak your words have supported
[1:52:13] those who were Fallen you you encourage
[1:52:16] those with shaking EAS but now when
[1:52:19] troubl strikes you lose heart you're
[1:52:22] terrified when he touches you
[1:52:26] doesn't your reverence for God give you
[1:52:29] confidence doesn't your life of
[1:52:31] Integrity give you hope stop and think
[1:52:34] do the innocent
[1:52:36] die when have the upright been destroyed
[1:52:40] my experience shows that those who plant
[1:52:43] trouble and cultivate evil will harvest
[1:52:46] the same a breath from God destroy them
[1:52:50] the vanish in the blast of his
[1:52:53] anger imagine a friend that's supposed
[1:52:55] to bring comforting words saying this to
[1:53:00] job bead said how long will you go on
[1:53:04] like this you sound like a blustering
[1:53:06] wind does God twist Justice does the
[1:53:10] almighty twist what is Right Said your
[1:53:13] children must have sinned against him
[1:53:16] didn't he offer the
[1:53:17] sacrifice he did
[1:53:20] even if they had sinned he offered
[1:53:22] sacrifice he brought them under the
[1:53:28] blood says so their punishment was well
[1:53:30] deserved well if you pray to God and
[1:53:33] seek the favor of the almighty and if
[1:53:34] you're pure and live with Integrity it
[1:53:37] will surely rise up and restore your
[1:53:39] happy home and though you started with
[1:53:41] little you will end with much the third
[1:53:44] friend over said shouldn't someone
[1:53:47] answer this torrent of words is a person
[1:53:50] proved innocent just by a lot of
[1:53:53] talking should I remain silent while you
[1:53:55] Babble on when you mock God shouldn't
[1:53:58] someone make you
[1:54:00] ashamed you claim my beliefs are pure
[1:54:04] and I am clean on the sight of God if
[1:54:06] only God will speak if only he will tell
[1:54:09] you what it thinks if only he will tell
[1:54:12] you the secrets of wisdom for True
[1:54:15] wisdom is not a simple matter listen God
[1:54:19] is doubtless punishing you for less than
[1:54:22] you
[1:54:26] deserve a righteous
[1:54:30] man job could not explain the situation
[1:54:33] he was
[1:54:34] in he couldn't also explain why God
[1:54:36] would be
[1:54:40] silent he concluded that God was angry
[1:54:42] with
[1:54:44] him and he was entirely
[1:54:47] confused and even more so very depressed
[1:54:51] he said if the
[1:54:52] misery if my misery could be weighed and
[1:54:55] my troubles put on scales they will
[1:54:58] outweigh all the Sands of the sea so
[1:55:01] that is why I spoke impulsively for the
[1:55:03] almighty has struck me down with his
[1:55:05] arrows their poisons infect my spirit
[1:55:08] God's Terrors are lined up against me
[1:55:11] don't I have a right to complain don't
[1:55:14] wild donkeys Pray when they find no
[1:55:16] grass and oxen Belo when they have no
[1:55:19] food don't people complain about
[1:55:21] unsalted food Brothers don't do
[1:55:25] that she might forget to put the salt
[1:55:28] sometimes just get a bit of it and add
[1:55:31] yourself doesn't anyone want the
[1:55:34] tastelessness sorry does anyone want the
[1:55:37] tastelessness tasteless white of an egg
[1:55:39] my appetite disappears when I look at it
[1:55:42] I gag at the thought of eating oh that I
[1:55:45] might have my request that God will
[1:55:48] grant my desire I wish he will crush me
[1:55:51] I wish he will reach out his hand and
[1:55:53] kill
[1:55:54] me at least I can take comfort in
[1:55:57] this despite the pain I have not denied
[1:56:01] the words of the Holy One but I do not
[1:56:04] have the strength to endure I have
[1:56:07] nothing to live
[1:56:10] for he went on to say I'm disgusted with
[1:56:13] my life let me complain freely my bitter
[1:56:15] Soul must complain I will say to God
[1:56:18] don't simply condemn me
[1:56:20] tell me the charge you are bringing
[1:56:21] against me what do you gain by
[1:56:23] oppressing me why do you reject me the
[1:56:26] work of your own hands while smiling on
[1:56:29] the schemes of the wicked are your eyes
[1:56:32] like those of a human do you see things
[1:56:35] only as people see them is your lifetime
[1:56:38] only as long as hours is your life so
[1:56:41] short that you must quickly probe for my
[1:56:43] guilt and search for my sin although you
[1:56:46] know I'm not guilty no one can Rescue Me
[1:56:49] from your hands you formed me with your
[1:56:52] hands you made me yet now you completely
[1:56:54] destroy
[1:56:56] me remember that you made me from dust
[1:56:59] will you turn me back to dust so soon
[1:57:02] you guided my conception and formed me
[1:57:04] in the womb you clothed me with skin and
[1:57:07] flesh and you knit my bones and sin
[1:57:10] together you gave me life and showed me
[1:57:12] your unfailing love my life was
[1:57:14] preserved by your care yet your your
[1:57:17] real motive your true intent
[1:57:20] was to watch me and if I sinned you will
[1:57:23] not forgive my guilt if I am guilty too
[1:57:27] bad for me and even if I'm innocent I
[1:57:29] can't hold my head high because I'm
[1:57:32] filled with shame and misery and if I
[1:57:34] hold my head high you hunt me like a
[1:57:36] lion and display your awesome power
[1:57:39] against me again and
[1:57:41] again you witness against me you pour
[1:57:45] out your growing anger on me and bring
[1:57:46] fresh armies against me why then why why
[1:57:49] did you deliver me from my mother's womb
[1:57:52] why did you let me die at Birth it will
[1:57:55] be as though as I had never existed
[1:57:58] going directly from the womb to the
[1:58:00] Grave I have only a few days left so
[1:58:03] leave me alone that I may have a moment
[1:58:05] of comfort before I leave never to
[1:58:08] return for the land of darkness and
[1:58:11] autog
[1:58:13] GL this is how he
[1:58:16] felt but that was God testing job
[1:58:20] why did I bring this regardless of your
[1:58:23] trials or testings that you may go
[1:58:25] through none of us can ever come near
[1:58:28] where job went through none of
[1:58:33] us but he said
[1:58:36] somewhere he said when you have tried
[1:58:38] me I shall come forth as
[1:58:42] gold but Abraham said job being the
[1:58:45] Prophet The Spirit come on him and he
[1:58:47] stood up on his feet and shook himself
[1:58:49] the spirit on him the prophet now
[1:58:52] finding the will of God and standing up
[1:58:54] he said I know my redeemer leaveth and
[1:58:58] at the last days he will stand upon this
[1:59:00] Earth though the schem WMS destroy this
[1:59:04] body yet in my
[1:59:06] flesh yet in my flesh I shall see God
[1:59:11] whom I shall see for
[1:59:13] myself my eyes shall be old and not
[1:59:16] another Abraham said that's right the
[1:59:18] prophet s the coming of the Lord I know
[1:59:21] my redeemer leaveth lives now
[1:59:25] continually Forever My Redeemer leaveth
[1:59:29] it's continual
[1:59:31] amen it will stand on the earth do the
[1:59:35] schem ons destroy my body said like he
[1:59:38] did the flower down there and so for yet
[1:59:40] in my flesh I'll see God who I shall see
[1:59:43] for myself my eyes Shall Behold and not
[1:59:46] another I'll call the musicians now
[1:59:51] ver 10 minutes to
[1:59:52] 12 I know it's cold I know we're tired
[1:59:57] the cold makes you
[1:59:59] tired I was out yesterday came back home
[2:00:01] and I felt like I'd done a full day of
[2:00:07] work well thank you for being
[2:00:10] attentive thank you for not sleeping too
[2:00:18] much brothers and
[2:00:22] sisters we all should decide that in
[2:00:24] this year as we go
[2:00:27] forward we will only listen to
[2:00:30] God we'll be persuaded that the promise
[2:00:32] he has
[2:00:33] made is able to bring it to
[2:00:37] pass the Braham said in the message
[2:00:39] believing God and that's where I got the
[2:00:41] inspiration for this message if you were
[2:00:43] wondering he said when I put that
[2:00:45] Tabernacle on the
[2:00:47] corner and kneel in here on a pile of
[2:00:51] gypsum weed and old horse weeds here and
[2:00:55] this right over this Pulpit this morning
[2:00:58] when he was
[2:00:59] upon God said I will bless
[2:01:04] it maybe there's something small that
[2:01:07] you're
[2:01:09] starting maybe there's something that
[2:01:11] God has laid in your heart that you've
[2:01:12] not even
[2:01:13] started and God has said I will bless
[2:01:16] it maybe you've brought some prayer CH
[2:01:19] before
[2:01:20] God a desire you have for a loved one
[2:01:24] and God said I will bless
[2:01:26] it the Braham said here stood the false
[2:01:30] prophet up and said I seen automobiles
[2:01:33] moving in and out and I see the stones
[2:01:36] going one from another so as God told
[2:01:39] the Braham that he was going to bless
[2:01:41] the Braham Tabernacle at the time when
[2:01:43] he was starting to build it when it was
[2:01:46] just weeds when it was just a swarm
[2:01:51] God said I'll bless
[2:01:52] it but right after that false prophet
[2:01:55] started to
[2:01:57] arise it might not be actual false
[2:01:59] prophets it might be the devil messing
[2:02:02] with your mind telling you that it's not
[2:02:04] going to happen listen to the prophet of
[2:02:07] God said that was 20 years ago and today
[2:02:12] it's still sailing on and it will Sail
[2:02:15] on because it was built here upon sweat
[2:02:19] and tears of
[2:02:21] prayer and promise of God it shall
[2:02:27] Prevail Abraham said Upon This Rock I'll
[2:02:30] build my church the gates of hell
[2:02:32] wouldn't Prevail against it said there
[2:02:34] you are yes sir don't pay no attention
[2:02:37] to what they say don't pay no attention
[2:02:40] to what people say anyone that tells you
[2:02:43] anything different from what God has
[2:02:45] told you shut your ears to what they say
[2:02:48] Amen if Satan is telling you something
[2:02:50] different than what God has told you
[2:02:53] shut your ears to it amen said I've
[2:02:56] learned my Lessing of listening to
[2:02:58] people who don't know what they're
[2:03:00] talking about I listen to one person
[2:03:05] that's almighty God Amen Jesus said from
[2:03:08] hence forth you ask in my name ask the
[2:03:11] father in my name and you'll get it
[2:03:14] brother Braham says I believe it amen
[2:03:19] let's be on our
[2:03:20] feet are you persuaded this morning
[2:03:24] fully
[2:03:25] persuaded that he that made the promise
[2:03:28] is able to bring it to
[2:03:31] pass are there are some promises that he
[2:03:34] made that you forgot
[2:03:37] about because it wasn't coming to pass
[2:03:41] you had waited and waited and waited and
[2:03:44] you think it will never happen again the
[2:03:47] vision is for a appointed time said
[2:03:51] though it
[2:03:52] hry it shall not
[2:03:54] hry wait for
[2:03:56] it give it
[2:03:59] time give it
[2:04:02] time there's a season there's a time
[2:04:07] appointed God has taught me that over
[2:04:09] the past year past couple
[2:04:12] years times to get anous about things
[2:04:14] just even very little things I remember
[2:04:17] we had planted some on meal grass
[2:04:20] in the summer before just actually fall
[2:04:23] of
[2:04:25] 2022 and I was really really waiting for
[2:04:29] them to grow and Bloom and bluem but we
[2:04:32] had planted too late in the year for
[2:04:34] that to happen and I took it to God In
[2:04:37] Prayer like Lord I because I like when
[2:04:40] it's summertime I really like when
[2:04:42] spring in summer I really like the lawn
[2:04:44] to look really beautiful put a lot of
[2:04:46] hard work to it people ask me why I do
[2:04:48] that that I said well I studied to be a
[2:04:50] farmer as my first degree so don't blame
[2:04:52] me it's also I'll just confess sometimes
[2:04:56] gets me away from the family sometimes
[2:05:00] and I can have my own time just to be
[2:05:03] honest when men do gardening trust me
[2:05:08] there's something
[2:05:09] more but I was like this is not growing
[2:05:14] and God said give it time
[2:05:16] amen the following
[2:05:19] spring it outperformed my expectation
[2:05:24] am I was asking for it at a time that it
[2:05:27] was not
[2:05:29] due according to Nature it wasn't the
[2:05:32] time according to God's plan it wasn't
[2:05:35] the time I was only worried for no
[2:05:40] reason but God's time is always the best
[2:05:46] time so if there's anything the Lord has
[2:05:49] promised you if there's anything you've
[2:05:50] laid before the Lord do it hurry it will
[2:05:54] not hry amen stay fully
[2:05:57] persuaded that he that made the promise
[2:06:00] is able to bring it to pass remind him
[2:06:04] every morning say Lord this might have
[2:06:07] taken time but I'm fully persuaded if
[2:06:10] you did it for Abraham and I am a Seed
[2:06:13] of Abraham and I have the same faith of
[2:06:16] Abraham brother Abraham said if somebody
[2:06:19] receiv received something from God on a
[2:06:21] certain basis he said God will be
[2:06:25] impartial
[2:06:27] amen not to give it to someone else on
[2:06:30] the same basis that is the god that we
[2:06:33] serve let's go to into this year so
[2:06:37] continuing into the year I can't believe
[2:06:38] it's already half of the month of
[2:06:40] January but let's go into this year
[2:06:44] without full
[2:06:45] Assurance it was the one that taught us
[2:06:47] to number our days
[2:06:49] for one reason we might apply our hearts
[2:06:51] to wisdom we can measure our growth we
[2:06:54] can see where we were before and ask
[2:06:56] ourselves am I getting better like our
[2:06:58] Pastor said if there's any growth to
[2:07:00] Aspire to is our Christian growth
[2:07:04] am what was I last year little ones the
[2:07:08] Lord still gives the baptism of the Holy
[2:07:11] Ghost if he did not happen last year you
[2:07:15] pray you desire it you trust the Lord
[2:07:19] for it when you receive the Holy Ghost
[2:07:21] it takes it takes a lot of worries away
[2:07:24] from you and from your parents brother
[2:07:27] Bram said that when you are sealed it is
[2:07:30] until the day of your Redemption so
[2:07:33] parents when we see our children receive
[2:07:36] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are not
[2:07:38] going to get worried about they going
[2:07:40] Wayward in the future we are not going
[2:07:42] to get about sorry worry about them
[2:07:44] leaving church because that this has now
[2:07:47] become their own personal
[2:07:49] revelation so as we are praying as we
[2:07:52] trusting God for them sometimes they do
[2:07:54] the things that pains us and we wonder
[2:07:57] how the devil you know got got a chance
[2:07:59] to get into our homes and get our
[2:08:01] children to do this nasty
[2:08:03] things but let's keep believing the
[2:08:05] promise amen he gave us those children
[2:08:09] we we dedicated each and every one of
[2:08:11] them to God when they were
[2:08:14] babies we gave them over to him amen
[2:08:17] hallelujah and he said anyone that the
[2:08:19] father gives to
[2:08:21] me they are mine I will not lose
[2:08:25] them let's bow our heads this
[2:08:29] morning our dear
[2:08:33] father you visited us today
[2:08:37] yes it has nothing to do Lord with a
[2:08:42] vessel it is the pulling and the prayers
[2:08:45] of your
[2:08:46] people and your desire your love your
[2:08:51] mercy that you have shown to your people
[2:08:54] to meet the needs that are represented
[2:08:57] here maybe you've got personal in some
[2:09:01] ways that has nothing to do with man's
[2:09:05] idea that is you just been
[2:09:08] caring to speak directly to the needs of
[2:09:11] your
[2:09:12] people your word is a discerner of the
[2:09:14] thoughts and the intents of the
[2:09:16] heart as we pray prayed Lord Jesus at
[2:09:19] the start of this service if your people
[2:09:21] will brace this freezing conditions to
[2:09:24] come to church with burdens with
[2:09:28] needs Lord it will be inappropriate for
[2:09:32] them to go back with those
[2:09:34] burdens We Trust Lord Jesus as your
[2:09:37] people have
[2:09:38] yielded Lord to hear from you
[2:09:41] today you have taken away the burdens
[2:09:45] you've taken away the
[2:09:46] pains Lord Jesus you've given us more
[2:09:49] Assurance than we could ever
[2:09:52] have that you are always with
[2:09:55] us that we can go Lord Jesus with more
[2:09:58] Assurance with more much more
[2:10:02] persuasion with much more
[2:10:05] inclination that God is always with us
[2:10:09] that he that made the
[2:10:11] promise it will bring it to
[2:10:13] pass I command your blessings upon your
[2:10:17] children
[2:10:19] Lord I am nothing Lord but I'm reminded
[2:10:23] Lord Jesus that in the Old Testament
[2:10:26] when the people come for the service at
[2:10:28] the close of the service the priest Will
[2:10:30] Bless the
[2:10:32] people not me Lord Jesus Will perhaps
[2:10:36] the gift you placed in my life upon the
[2:10:39] basis of the commission of the Holy
[2:10:41] Spirit I command your blessings upon
[2:10:44] your
[2:10:44] people if there's anything Lord Jesus
[2:10:47] that they have laid before you Lord
[2:10:50] Jesus any
[2:10:53] aspirations any
[2:10:57] desires Lord any matter they have
[2:11:00] committed into your
[2:11:02] hands may you meet them at the point of
[2:11:04] their
[2:11:06] needs may you bless the work of the
[2:11:08] hands of your people Lord may you
[2:11:10] multiply the works of their hands Lord
[2:11:14] anything they lay their hands upon
[2:11:15] according to your word may it prosper
[2:11:18] and flourish am may you Lord Jesus
[2:11:23] raise men and women that will be good
[2:11:27] ambassadors of your
[2:11:30] kingdom to all levels and Strat of life
[2:11:34] and
[2:11:36] living that the unbelievers on the day
[2:11:38] of judgment will not have an
[2:11:41] excuse that people will not be able to
[2:11:43] say Lord I didn't serve you because I
[2:11:45] was rich I didn't serve you because
[2:11:47] things w well for me I didn't serve you
[2:11:49] because I was in this condition or I was
[2:11:51] even leaving in the City of Calgary
[2:11:54] where people don't want to hear the name
[2:11:56] God
[2:11:57] called may we be
[2:12:00] witnesses that can stand on the day of
[2:12:03] judgment and say we were in the very
[2:12:05] same condition as those people but Grace
[2:12:08] spoke for us Grace kept us Grace helped
[2:12:12] us we lived for God lord Jesus reminded
[2:12:15] Lord of that Short age where the the
[2:12:18] Bible said Lord Jesus they were leaving
[2:12:20] where Satan's seat was and yet they were
[2:12:25] righteous we know Lord we are leaving

[2:22:23] Hallelujah don't you like the Simplicity
[2:22:26] of the
[2:22:27] Gospel it's it's it's so interesting I
[2:22:30] find brother Toby addressing the young
[2:22:32] ones about the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:22:34] and I'm thinking God is faithful God is
[2:22:37] true this is what we've been we we we've
[2:22:40] been talking about even today like the
[2:22:42] things we're talking about about the
[2:22:44] natural baptism has a purpose and that
[2:22:47] is it leads us to the baptism of the
[2:22:49] Holy Ghost and then once you get there
[2:22:51] that seals it and so I've just talking
[2:22:54] to each one and we were talking about
[2:22:57] the purpose for which we went into the
[2:23:00] in for baptism has that been fulfilled
[2:23:03] and if not what is stopping it so so
[2:23:06] it's it's just so beautiful our Lord is
[2:23:08] so good brother you see if God gives
[2:23:12] birth to you or if if any parent here
[2:23:15] you know you did not decide where your
[2:23:18] child should be born h no you decided
[2:23:20] where your child your child did not
[2:23:21] decide it you
[2:23:24] decided where your child will sleep what
[2:23:27] they'll wear their name what they eat
[2:23:30] everything you decided and sometimes it
[2:23:33] may not be comfortable for your child
[2:23:36] but it's your decision and this is what
[2:23:38] we are going through they may be
[2:23:40] disappointments they may be pain they
[2:23:42] may be sorrow they may be heartaches but
[2:23:46] that is the choice God God has made for
[2:23:47] us the thing is he's faithful and he'll
[2:23:51] see see us to the end so let's glorify
[2:23:54] him let's let's do that little bit
[2:23:56] because you see problems gives us that
[2:23:58] unique opportunity to offer that
[2:24:01] sacrifice of praise it's easy for us all
[2:24:04] to thank him when all is well but when
[2:24:07] there is pain when there is sorrow when
[2:24:09] there are heartaches when there are
[2:24:11] disappointments and we still don't look
[2:24:13] at our feelings but the word and say
[2:24:16] glory be to to his name that is the
[2:24:18] unique thing that he's looking from us
[2:24:20] let's stay faithful because he is
[2:24:22] faithful amen let's bow down our heart
[2:24:24] before
[2:24:25] him Lord you are faithful you are true
