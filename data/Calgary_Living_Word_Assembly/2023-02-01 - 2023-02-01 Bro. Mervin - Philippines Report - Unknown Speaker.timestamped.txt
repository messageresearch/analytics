[27:10] king of all
[27:13] Kings amen
[27:19] God bless you this evening
[27:22] it's been a while I think I'm gonna
[27:25] thank the musician
[27:26] I have
[27:28] I think almost couple of hundred slides
[27:31] but
[27:32] there are a lot of pictures I know we
[27:34] shared a lot of pictures and videos with
[27:37] sister Lisa
[27:38] and the family so I hope you will not be
[27:41] stumbled with some of the pictures
[27:43] because it's a we want to show the law
[27:46] of contrast actually with this mission
[27:48] trip if there's you know some poor areas
[27:52] there are some rich areas good places
[27:54] bad places but the overall thing is when
[27:57] you meet the bride of Christ it's all
[27:59] good people amen because we have common
[28:01] denominator we have the Holy Spirit
[28:03] together amen and we're so thankful and
[28:08] to him and maybe while you're standing
[28:10] let's read the the scripture which is
[28:13] related to a little bit of missions it
[28:16] will be Romans 10.
[28:20] verses 13 to 16. I didn't put that in
[28:23] the slides
[28:25] but let's read it all together
[28:29] okay
[28:31] say Amen when you're there amen
[28:34] okay Romans 10 verses 13 2. 16 for
[28:40] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[28:43] the Lord shall be saved
[28:46] do we call him every time amen it means
[28:48] we're saved even before the foundation
[28:50] of the world Amen
[28:52] how then shall they call on him in whom
[28:55] they have not believed
[28:58] and how shall they believe in him of
[29:01] whom they have not heard and how shall
[29:04] they hear without a preacher you can see
[29:06] here even brother Branham
[29:09] his theme song is only believe
[29:11] because when you believe you will
[29:13] receive you will obey you will do all
[29:16] the things and act upon it amen and how
[29:19] would you believe without hearing the
[29:21] preaching of the word that's why we have
[29:22] fivefold Ministry and our trip is not in
[29:25] vain we believe that amen because we
[29:27] there are lots of good reports amen
[29:30] about this trip and let's hear let's
[29:33] continue verse 15 and how shall they
[29:36] preach
[29:37] except they be sent
[29:40] as it is written how beautiful are the
[29:44] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[29:46] peace and bring Glad Tidings of good
[29:49] things
[29:50] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[29:54] for Isaiah said Lord who had believer
[29:57] report we believe that we believe this
[29:58] report amen let's bow our hearts this
[30:00] evening oh Lord Jesus we are not worthy
[30:04] Lord before you unless you anoint us and
[30:07] send your Holy Spirit in us oh Lord but
[30:10] by the power that you have given us by
[30:13] the election that you have placed in us
[30:15] we are all made worthy we are all
[30:18] Justified we never did it in the first
[30:21] place because you destroyed all the
[30:23] evidence of our sins though we thank
[30:26] Lord that we have done all those things
[30:28] but by your blood Lord by your cleansing
[30:31] blood you already
[30:33] predestinated us elected us before the
[30:37] foundation of the world
[30:39] who whose report we will believe Lord
[30:41] accept your word Lord help us now Lord
[30:44] prepare our hearts Lord open our hearts
[30:47] may this little testimony Lord be a be a
[30:50] blessing to the hearers lord it's not it
[30:53] might not be a preaching or a teaching
[30:55] but uh it's a it's a testimony thing
[30:57] Lord of your goodness and mercy and
[31:00] Grace Lord in our lives as uh as we
[31:03] surrender unto you Lord wherever we go
[31:06] oh God may you be in the service Lord
[31:08] from the from the beginning to the end
[31:10] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you
[31:12] may be seated amen
[31:17] amen praise the Lord
[31:20] I'll just read this quote before before
[31:23] starting the the presentation
[31:26] it's in the identified Christ of all
[31:29] ages
[31:30] let me just read it because it's a
[31:32] beautiful quote
[31:35] that Barbara Branham it's in 1964 April
[31:39] 1st the identified Christ of all ages he
[31:42] said
[31:42] but when you find Christian people
[31:46] where the holy spirit is
[31:49] no matter what nation
[31:51] amen how far in the jungle or whatever
[31:55] it is
[31:56] they do the same thing you do when you
[31:59] receive the Holy Ghost
[32:01] amen they do just the same thing they
[32:04] have the same Liberty amen we we are
[32:08] free from all sins amen we are we are
[32:11] Jubilee it has been preached amen they
[32:14] do
[32:15] they believe the same way and act the
[32:17] same way that any Christian does when he
[32:20] receives Christ did you receive Christ
[32:22] amen and we we know who we are we know
[32:25] what we are that's why we can relax and
[32:28] be at rest amen we might be laboring
[32:31] into that rest because that's the
[32:32] difficult thing to do is to labor and to
[32:35] rest because we are still in this flesh
[32:38] we are still in progress therefore we
[32:41] always fight
[32:42] we think that we can do something
[32:43] according to our uh capability but
[32:47] actually God wants us to surrender
[32:49] completely amen so that he can work on
[32:52] us so as I uh progress in the in the
[32:56] pictures I will I will share I will
[32:58] share the testimony if I can but then
[33:01] the thing the pictures paint a thousand
[33:03] words so let's see how it goes uh
[33:06] brother Josh or Isaac
[33:11] so our our report oops
[33:14] it doesn't show here bro okay there you
[33:17] go
[33:18] so December 2022 to January 2020 uh this
[33:23] January 20 23rd we went there earlier
[33:26] around two weeks earlier than the
[33:28] Johnsons uh and uh we prepared the way a
[33:32] little bit so that at least they they
[33:34] will be comfortable when they come and
[33:36] at the same time we have several uh
[33:39] churches that we visited as well because
[33:43] there are so many uh activities there
[33:46] during December because it's a holiday
[33:47] so all come meetings because there's so
[33:50] many message Believers in the
[33:52] Philippines and every church maybe one
[33:54] group has 35 churches in one group so
[33:57] they cannot fit in in one uh one camp
[34:00] meeting so there are several cup
[34:02] meetings and uh we were invited to
[34:05] attend but we can only attend one uh
[34:08] camp meeting because they're a little
[34:10] bit far as you know
[34:12] in Philippines though they are it's just
[34:14] 30 kilometers it will take you two hours
[34:16] three hours and it's a good experience
[34:18] by by them that
[34:20] so we don't take by kilometers we take
[34:23] by the hours how long it would take from
[34:25] one point to another point then convert
[34:27] it here that's how how far it is you can
[34:30] say when it's three hours it means from
[34:31] here to Edmonton right but actually
[34:33] you're going only to every maybe or yeah
[34:36] so that's how we we we take it so uh
[34:42] yeah so
[34:46] okay sorry it's uh
[34:49] December 14th I I actually my my wife
[34:53] arrived November 20th and then I
[34:55] followed December 14th and then miles I
[34:58] think uh December 21st and Lynn 20 on
[35:02] the 25th so our our children are 10
[35:06] adults already so they have their own
[35:08] lives so they go to they work they go to
[35:11] school and for us I work and my wife
[35:13] works for me so so he she has all the
[35:17] time right Workshop right I work she
[35:20] shops so that's marriage right so she
[35:23] knows that she has that Revelation I
[35:25] guess so so she's happy with that and
[35:28] not not as a joke but uh it's good to to
[35:32] be revelated that way right so
[35:35] uh and and then when I arrived December
[35:38] 12th I I left here December 10th but uh
[35:41] uh the 15 hours difference is uh it's
[35:45] like another day so I arrived there
[35:47] December I I left December 10th and I
[35:50] arrived December 12th and immediately
[35:52] December 14th I already preached I was
[35:55] invited by Brother Valdez the pastor
[35:58] there in nuevasia which brother were
[36:00] very uh met after when when they arrived
[36:04] and it's been actually a
[36:08] School mate that we did that I didn't
[36:12] know I knew it last year when I first
[36:14] met him he he told me about uh about his
[36:17] teachers when he was in elementary and
[36:19] then he showed me those are my teachers
[36:21] I told him and
[36:22] so it means we were classmates without
[36:25] knowing it and and we graduated the same
[36:28] time in elementary I believe or or so so
[36:31] anyway we visited the church so I I
[36:33] preached there uh I spoke there
[36:35] Wednesday night and you can see uh he
[36:39] asked for help beforehand because uh
[36:42] because of this uh that that last camp
[36:45] meeting uh many people come on his
[36:50] church as well so he wanted to to pour
[36:53] some concrete so that they can put the
[36:54] tents and the church helped in advance
[36:57] and actually they put the concrete and
[36:58] we found we saw it and
[37:01] this is the work that they did before we
[37:03] came and they finished it somehow uh
[37:07] maybe
[37:09] 100 or 200 people come in in that church
[37:13] because it's just close by to the camp
[37:15] campsite so and then you can see they
[37:20] did the work and yeah this is how it
[37:24] looked
[37:25] in the inside and they did a lot of work
[37:28] also after this
[37:30] I'll show you so Burberry visited so
[37:33] these are not in uh chronological order
[37:36] but then the thing is that's the time
[37:38] already in in January when we we went
[37:41] there very was there too to visit it
[37:43] this is the last church we visited with
[37:46] brother Berry before they left
[37:49] and uh this is Brother Val is my and
[37:52] this is also a pastor in one of the
[37:55] churches there is Pastor Ray
[37:57] uh you can see the so they uh Bradberry
[38:01] had the heart to to help so he gave some
[38:04] amount and then they immediately you
[38:06] know uh uh painted the the church
[38:09] actually so they did some Renovations
[38:11] immediately
[38:13] because when you when you try to
[38:16] he has two outreaches basically and they
[38:19] are uh in progress of building the
[38:22] churches but then the thing is before
[38:23] you can do an Outreach you have to start
[38:26] with your church first right so he he
[38:28] started with this church but then it's
[38:30] not finished yet so Barbary has the the
[38:33] desire to to help and then actually they
[38:37] they did it immediately then he he gave
[38:39] me the pictures and this is the result
[38:42] now it's fully fully painted and somehow
[38:46] it's it's better it's air conditioned
[38:48] now because it's too hot there so they
[38:51] had all this stuff so you know little
[38:54] help uh you know it it makes a big
[38:57] difference to the church right so
[39:00] yeah and then this is the result
[39:01] actually but yeah lack of pictures but
[39:04] but that's uh how it progressed after
[39:07] after we left and then uh December 18th
[39:12] uh
[39:14] we went to Brad I was invited by brother
[39:16] Danny because uh I need to do the the
[39:20] work while the pastor is not there yet
[39:23] so I I represented Calgary Living Word
[39:26] there because there's so many churches
[39:28] there actually they've been so happy to
[39:31] to receive us and then they were so
[39:33] excited waiting for Barry to come and
[39:37] actually I I only filtered all the
[39:40] invitations otherwise Sister Lisa might
[39:43] not be able to come back anymore so all
[39:45] right so so to be honest they will work
[39:49] you out it's like in Africa I guess
[39:51] every day almost
[39:53] they want you to preach but it was a
[39:55] blessing actually so December 18th
[39:58] Sunday I was able to to speak and some
[40:02] of the the topics that I discussed there
[40:04] had been preached here because of course
[40:07] you have to preach here first and this
[40:09] this is our home church and we just want
[40:11] to share because being a let's say an
[40:14] evangelist or a missionary of course you
[40:16] have to have a home church right so you
[40:19] must be under a pastor and that's that's
[40:21] scriptural and that is as per the
[40:24] message of the hour you cannot just go
[40:25] by your own you have to be under a
[40:28] ministry under a local church right so
[40:31] we we respect that and we believe that
[40:33] amen and uh
[40:36] you can see the the church there so very
[40:38] established church and uh you know a
[40:42] brother Danny del mundo is is our friend
[40:44] and we introduce the Johnsons to the Del
[40:48] Mundos and actually they're good people
[40:50] and
[40:51] uh we love them
[40:54] and he has a lot of outreaches and then
[40:57] it's just like Roman Candle a pastor
[40:59] will be ordained and that Pastor will
[41:01] have another Outreach and Outreach and
[41:03] Outreach that's why they became bigger
[41:05] hopefully we can do that of course it's
[41:08] not it's not required to go overseas you
[41:10] can do it like what Barbara is saying
[41:13] this is a mission field we live here so
[41:15] this is our mission field amen so a
[41:18] million
[41:19] 1.2 million uh
[41:22] calgarians right so how many are we here
[41:25] we're not even maybe 200 or something
[41:27] but uh in there they that's what they do
[41:30] but uh I'm not saying we we should do
[41:33] what they're doing that we we will have
[41:34] a lot of outreaches but then the thing
[41:36] is they they live the life according to
[41:38] what has been uh preached by Brother
[41:40] Branham to to you know to uh to uh to
[41:45] preach the gospel and teach it and and
[41:47] witness to many people amen and uh it's
[41:50] been a blessing you can see that uh
[41:52] he was able to establish a lot of
[41:54] churches through through the help of the
[41:57] Lord of course because he was called he
[41:59] said you can say he's a missionary
[42:00] Pastor that's why he's come they're
[42:03] around 36 churches that congregated at
[42:06] that time they're around a thousand
[42:07] people that attended so uh it's been a
[42:12] pleasure to be a part of their uh their
[42:15] camp meeting amen so this one is just a
[42:19] normal Sunday service
[42:21] and uh this is their believer's Camp
[42:24] which is uh in one of the provinces it's
[42:28] around two hours from our hometown but
[42:31] uh maybe from Manila it's around three
[42:32] hours amen so so these are the ministers
[42:36] that uh
[42:37] that congregated in that camp meeting
[42:40] and uh yeah I felt
[42:44] uh
[42:46] humbled you can say because these are uh
[42:50] ministers who are preaching for 30 40
[42:52] years that they've been in the message
[42:53] and some of them you can see their white
[42:56] hair they've been all over the world
[42:59] actually some of them but they're good
[43:02] people they're they're like us they
[43:03] believe the same message and it was a
[43:07] privilege to be part of that uh
[43:10] Believers Camp which is it's manifesting
[43:13] time
[43:13] right so that's their team and uh
[43:17] we know when we go for Missions we have
[43:19] to look for the last predestinated seat
[43:21] but it doesn't end there
[43:24] we must bring them in
[43:26] we must perfect them right through the
[43:29] preaching and teaching of the word so
[43:31] that they can manifest the fruit of the
[43:34] holy spirit amen and because that's the
[43:36] main thing we must manifest of who we
[43:39] are amen there's no
[43:41] there are only two seeds you can say all
[43:44] right the seed of God and Seed of The
[43:46] Serpent and and for us we believe that
[43:48] we're the the seed of God we have the
[43:50] germ seed of God that's why we believe
[43:52] the full word amen but then we're not
[43:55] putting out all those who who doesn't
[43:58] have the seed because by by uh by the
[44:02] grace that that will be given through us
[44:04] we can preach and extend the grace
[44:07] through through uh if they do something
[44:10] good to us we know that that's a
[44:12] different class of per people right the
[44:14] the the the the cup of cold water amen
[44:17] that's why my preaching here uh my topic
[44:21] here is uh uh it's the new bird will
[44:23] lead to Perfection because if you have
[44:25] the new birth which is the right Bird
[44:28] right or if you're uh interchange it
[44:33] with Jacob he knows his Birthright he
[44:36] was after the birth right but then you
[44:39] must have the right bird as well so that
[44:40] you can be perfected which is which is
[44:43] uh the new birth amen the new birth
[44:47] means it's uh the revelation of Jesus
[44:50] Christ personally to us
[44:52] the people that are being used the
[44:54] fivefold ministry will just preach the
[44:56] word but it's the revelation of Jesus
[44:59] Christ personally to us that that will
[45:01] Quicken the seed that is in us because
[45:04] that seed was elected of God
[45:07] We cannot put any seed on anyone amen
[45:10] that's why for us it's just to look for
[45:12] those predestinated sin amen and along
[45:15] the way if we if they don't have seed
[45:16] but if they do good to us they can have
[45:20] uh they can enter into that eternal life
[45:22] amen although they didn't have eternal
[45:25] life from the beginning but they will be
[45:26] given
[45:27] eternal life by by being good to us amen
[45:30] that's why when we go anywhere we have
[45:33] to represent Jesus Christ whatever we do
[45:35] right and uh I know we our our work are
[45:40] very uh demanding of our time and I'm
[45:43] preaching to myself because the thing is
[45:45] since I came
[45:47] there's a lot people I mean there are
[45:52] things that that were left
[45:55] since uh since I left they are still
[45:58] there and I I have to I have to do them
[46:00] so we're not excused because that's I
[46:03] think that's the curse for for a man is
[46:05] to to to provide for the family and
[46:08] we're not complaining I'm just saying
[46:10] that although we need to do that but our
[46:12] Focus must must be
[46:14] the the real thing which is uh to to
[46:18] minister to the bride basically of
[46:21] Christ amen and and ministering meaning
[46:23] even though we don't uh speak here we
[46:27] still have to share the gospel to
[46:28] everyone witness to everyone the good
[46:30] news amen because no one would want
[46:33] uh anyone to go to hell even Barbara
[46:36] Branham is saying you don't want your
[46:37] enemy to go to
[46:39] to to hell because uh it's he was given
[46:43] the vision it's terrible Place amen
[46:46] that's why
[46:47] uh that's why we we have that burden to
[46:51] go amen uh it just happened that the
[46:54] Philippines is my uh Hometown that's why
[46:56] uh Brian I'm saying go to your people
[46:59] right then I speak the language so and I
[47:02] can relate
[47:03] uh and and the experience there like uh
[47:06] the comfort room that we have right so
[47:08] CR I know the
[47:11] the the boys have experienced it it's a
[47:14] comfort room it means it should be
[47:15] comfortable right but then the thing is
[47:17] uh you know the the way there is not
[47:21] like here but then the thing is the law
[47:23] of contrast that we we've been trying to
[47:25] uh uh for for the boys to to experience
[47:30] is uh we are really privileged people
[47:32] here in North America because if you go
[47:36] to a third world country you you won't
[47:38] expect the the all the Comfort here in
[47:42] North America here you have a lot of
[47:44] choices you have a lot of things that
[47:45] you enjoy but then people still complain
[47:49] great amen but there whatever they have
[47:53] I will show you later on and uh
[47:56] some of the people that we met and we
[47:59] have
[48:00] it's it's really a law of contrast and
[48:02] it will it will humble you it will make
[48:05] you uh
[48:07] think from a different perspective that
[48:09] you we are really blessed here we have
[48:12] everything that we need here
[48:14] amen and uh but the thing is the the
[48:17] Christ that we have here they have they
[48:19] have it there too
[48:21] and that's the good thing amen so yeah I
[48:24] was able to to speak there uh
[48:27] and uh you can see the the people there
[48:30] it's yeah around a thousand they're
[48:32] saying they're they're 35 36 churches
[48:35] that they they they
[48:38] they congregated basically
[48:41] and uh
[48:43] oh I think this one these are the tents
[48:46] that they they put there so actually
[48:48] Barbara and the family also went in this
[48:51] place when after the camp and then they
[48:54] they have seen it firsthand what uh what
[48:57] the campus I know there's still a lot of
[48:59] work there but they're planning to have
[49:01] the the international youth meeting I
[49:03] think in 24
[49:04] 2024 so yeah uh they will invite all the
[49:08] youth
[49:09] worldwide I think because the last time
[49:12] they did they have limited space but in
[49:14] this case they can invite many many
[49:17] people and yeah young people from Europe
[49:20] are already expecting it because the
[49:23] ministry actually
[49:25] it's a bit uh
[49:28] spread out because he has been invited
[49:31] in Europe in U.S and uh and and some
[49:35] other in Asia basically so yeah and
[49:39] their their family is a wonderful family
[49:41] they are friends with many people so and
[49:44] they are friends and they are the
[49:45] friends of Johnsons now so they are in
[49:48] contact with them but anyway so this is
[49:51] the the camp
[49:53] campsite where they where they typically
[49:57] stay so these are their tents
[50:00] and this basketball court at least for
[50:03] recreation they they will put the you
[50:05] know a covered Court they will convert
[50:07] this to a covert card but of course it
[50:09] will be Progressive it will be a lot of
[50:11] money to to do it but then the thing is
[50:13] they're just believing uh because God
[50:16] will provide for sure and uh we believe
[50:18] with them amen and they're actually
[50:22] there's uh they will build the dormitory
[50:26] here when we went there they're already
[50:27] pouring concrete uh beside here so it
[50:30] will be a dormitory and then this will
[50:32] be a covert Court that's what they're uh
[50:35] doing right now
[50:37] okay and uh these ones are
[50:40] are the ministers and and this brother
[50:43] brother Roger he's been with me in
[50:48] in Qatar we sleep together he saw is my
[50:52] friend and almost like a real blood
[50:55] brother and uh he's now the pastor in
[50:57] one of the churches there and then we
[50:59] met after how many years now over 10
[51:02] years 15 years and we were so happy to
[51:05] meet and he replaced the the dad of
[51:09] sister Sabel Isabel the wife of brother
[51:12] Danny because he passed away the the dad
[51:15] of sister Isabel and he was the one who
[51:18] who got ordained to be the the pastor
[51:20] just recently I think last year and I
[51:23] was so happy to to meet him and he's a
[51:25] good brother and we sleep side by side
[51:28] in Qatar and we just met after many many
[51:31] years and I was so happy to to meet him
[51:33] again so yeah
[51:36] so this one is a briefing for the
[51:40] uh for those nine people who decided to
[51:43] get baptized so I gave them the briefing
[51:47] why they need to be baptized and because
[51:49] they decided after the service Sunday I
[51:52] think and then I was I was uh delegated
[51:56] to to do the to do the honors basically
[51:59] so there are nine Souls that uh that
[52:02] accepted but uh you know every cup
[52:06] meetings they they're harvesting Souls
[52:08] you can say you know one one soul is
[52:11] priceless amen ten thousand worlds
[52:14] that's its worth and that's why for
[52:17] every bride
[52:18] we must know that our price is the blood
[52:22] of Jesus Christ
[52:23] it's very you can say you if the devil
[52:28] is telling us who that we are worthless
[52:30] now we can just resist the devil and
[52:33] tell him about God's promises in the
[52:35] Bible
[52:36] right so because the thing is we are
[52:38] sinless but less bride of Jesus Christ
[52:41] that's why looking for the last
[52:42] predestinated is very important amen
[52:45] that's the work that we we we are uh
[52:49] happy to do amen and uh as you can see
[52:53] uh there's no uh they just have this and
[52:59] then we did the baptism here and I was
[53:02] not immersed I know we we discussed me
[53:04] and Briar Berry because some some people
[53:06] are are saying is that really proper
[53:09] when when the one that is baptizing is
[53:11] not immersed uh with water because but
[53:15] then the thing is when you check the
[53:17] word
[53:18] baptized comes from the Greek word
[53:20] baptizo meaning
[53:22] totally immersed who is totally immersed
[53:25] the one that is being baptized is not
[53:26] the one that is baptizing so I I don't
[53:29] see any technicality there but uh it's
[53:32] good to you know when when you're
[53:34] thinking because some some ministers are
[53:36] are commenting on that but uh for me I
[53:39] mean for us when we discuss I don't see
[53:42] any issue that uh
[53:44] as long as he the person is totally
[53:47] immersed basically because in Romans 6
[53:50] with his death we are dead with him with
[53:54] this Resurrection we are resurrected
[53:55] with him amen that's that's the thing
[53:58] and uh and we must totally die to
[54:01] ourselves so that we can live and be
[54:03] born again amen
[54:05] so nine Souls were baptized and
[54:08] you can see even a younger one because
[54:11] actually one of the pastors were
[54:13] questioning about the the baptism how
[54:15] how old are you oh yeah I'm eight oh you
[54:18] cannot but I stop him you know what
[54:20] there's no stopping in uh in the desire
[54:23] of anyone because uh even John the
[54:26] Baptist
[54:27] right he was baptized with the Holy
[54:30] Ghost when he was in the womb so the
[54:33] thing is that that's how it is and then
[54:35] we allowed and I told him I will baptize
[54:38] him there's no there's no issue because
[54:40] it's scriptural and
[54:42] and even Branham said that uh don't you
[54:46] know the desire of the of the child we
[54:49] must honor amen it's very important
[54:54] and we we prayed for them and uh here uh
[54:57] we distributed Bibles
[54:59] around 100 Bibles and uh you can see
[55:02] these are pastors actually because
[55:04] there's so many that got baptized and
[55:06] they didn't have the Bible so we help on
[55:09] that on that end around 100 Bibles were
[55:12] distributed
[55:13] you can see here these are Pastors in
[55:16] different places actually so it's it's
[55:17] good to to see people from different
[55:20] walks although they they speak we speak
[55:24] the common uh Filipino or Tagalog
[55:27] language but then they they're from
[55:28] different provinces so it's good to to
[55:30] see and it's our first time to meet a
[55:33] lot of pastors also amen so
[55:37] yeah so the Bible's here
[55:41] and we distributed some goodies as well
[55:44] which is uh these are spaghetti and some
[55:47] coffee three in one I think the
[55:49] favorites now of of the boys
[55:53] and uh yeah so to to the to the Indigent
[55:57] members uh who who came uh I think last
[56:01] time I I mentioned that uh for two days
[56:03] they traveled by land
[56:05] they walked because uh because it was
[56:08] Isis uh uh it's uh there's there was a
[56:13] storm at that time but in this case they
[56:15] were able to use their their boats so it
[56:19] just took them maybe half day to to come
[56:21] to to this uh uh camp meeting but last
[56:26] time it took them two days to to walk
[56:28] then they just slept ever walked eight
[56:31] hours and then slept in in some Villages
[56:34] there and then come so for 24 48 Hours
[56:36] of travel by by walking amen but uh in
[56:41] this case uh it was better so we were
[56:43] able to to distribute some goodies as
[56:46] well
[56:47] okay uh
[56:50] and this one are the members of brother
[56:53] Danny already because the the camp is
[56:56] already done at that time Sunday so we
[56:58] just have a little bit of a picture here
[57:01] amen and January 1st I was uh because I
[57:05] didn't have any plan but then uh
[57:07] we went to one of the churches which are
[57:11] close to our house which is just 30
[57:12] minutes away and the pastor has been
[57:15] asking me if I don't have any plans so I
[57:19] he asked me to to speak for him his name
[57:22] is brother Joel uh archibido and uh
[57:26] you can see yeah
[57:29] I I want to to share a testimony here
[57:32] because this is the brother of my wife
[57:35] this is Brother Ray Ray is his name
[57:39] he I I think uh in November I think
[57:43] before I came there or maybe early
[57:45] December before I came uh my wife
[57:48] invited him to attend this church
[57:51] and he's not a Believer but he believes
[57:54] the Bible and then
[57:57] the good thing is now he's already
[57:59] attending this church and he brought his
[58:01] family
[58:01] with him and uh we're believing with him
[58:05] and he's the one who's sharing what the
[58:07] message
[58:08] that is being preached by the pastor and
[58:11] the pastor is my friend and uh I told
[58:14] him just you know be gentle with them
[58:16] because they are new but uh it's a good
[58:19] it's a it's a young church but uh I know
[58:23] they're preaching the word and and
[58:25] brother Ray my brother-in-law is very uh
[58:28] uh received receiving of uh he he
[58:32] receives what what is being preached and
[58:34] that's a the greatest testimony that we
[58:37] can say because uh we want our family to
[58:39] be in in the message right if uh that's
[58:42] our sincere desire because we don't want
[58:44] everyone to be lost amen and uh we're
[58:47] thankful to that and at the same time
[58:51] next slide here
[58:54] these are my brothers and sisters when
[58:57] they know when they knew that I will be
[58:59] preaching in in that place and they are
[59:01] close by I only invited my sister uh who
[59:05] who was a former Pentecostal before and
[59:08] he believes the Bible and then he said I
[59:10] will come he said he came from Saudi and
[59:13] we we had the reunion and then all my
[59:16] other siblings were there and then they
[59:17] said I we want to come too we want to
[59:19] hear from you so actually it was a
[59:22] blessing I was touching the I I picked
[59:26] them up and the whole van was full with
[59:28] the with my sisters and my brother and
[59:32] my nephews and it's a blessing actually
[59:34] and and after the the service they gave
[59:38] a good report and then they're they're
[59:40] telling me how how did you know all of
[59:42] those I told them I didn't know them but
[59:45] the thing is it's they are in the Bible
[59:47] and then because I I preach about the
[59:49] the prophet so they heard about it so
[59:53] they didn't question anything but that
[59:55] we believe for our families because the
[59:57] thing is we can represent them they
[1:00:00] might not have the ears to to hear the
[1:00:02] word but it will be according to to the
[1:00:05] one speaking it's Ezekiel 37 amen when
[1:00:09] when Ezekiel was uh prophesying to that
[1:00:12] bones they are not only bones they are
[1:00:14] dry bones they didn't have have any ears
[1:00:16] to hear but then they heard because
[1:00:20] Ezekiel was asked by the by God to
[1:00:24] prophesy to the bones to have uh to have
[1:00:27] signed used to have you know their Dry
[1:00:30] Bones they didn't have any ears to hear
[1:00:33] we know Faith Comet by hearing the word
[1:00:36] but these Dry Bones didn't have any ears
[1:00:39] but they followed what the prophet said
[1:00:42] that's why you see we we can say that uh
[1:00:45] Ezekiel was given the proper instruction
[1:00:49] and he didn't know what to do he was
[1:00:52] always asking God God what should I do
[1:00:54] we should be like that right because God
[1:00:55] wants us to be led and we should be uh
[1:00:59] teachable and we should be able to be
[1:01:02] led otherwise God cannot lead us because
[1:01:04] we will be pushing back but then in this
[1:01:06] case Ezekiel just said
[1:01:08] tell me Lord and then he followed and
[1:01:11] then you see after that the the bones
[1:01:15] heard something and then they they had
[1:01:18] the the skin the the the bow I mean the
[1:01:22] the sinus everything and then after that
[1:01:24] what did he do he breathed on them
[1:01:27] which is the bread of life which is the
[1:01:30] eternal life amen it's the same for
[1:01:32] Abraham
[1:01:33] amen before it was Abram but then
[1:01:36] because of the Breath of God he became
[1:01:39] Abraham I know I think it's brother
[1:01:40] Wayne Lawson who mentioned that but the
[1:01:43] letter AIDS there that's why Branham
[1:01:45] right it's it's a bread of life
[1:01:47] everything that we we we breathe and
[1:01:50] even Sarai
[1:01:51] he became Sarah we know that uh
[1:01:55] being Abram
[1:01:57] I I suck is not the son of Abraham he's
[1:02:01] a son of Abram right I mean what I'm
[1:02:05] saying is the first son is Ishmael
[1:02:07] Ishmael is not a son of Abraham he was a
[1:02:12] son of Abram
[1:02:13] right because he's not the promised one
[1:02:15] but then when he was given the bread of
[1:02:17] life when the when they change the body
[1:02:19] Branham is saying he became Abraham and
[1:02:23] then he and and then Sarai became Sarah
[1:02:26] and then they they got Isaac which is
[1:02:29] the promise and what I'm saying here is
[1:02:31] the bread of life can come through the
[1:02:33] body amen and we we've been preaching
[1:02:36] the son of man Ministries through the
[1:02:39] bride right now because uh brother
[1:02:41] Branham already left the scene and we
[1:02:43] are continuing that Ministry I think
[1:02:45] brother Berry just preached last Sunday
[1:02:47] oh he said Sunday I think so yeah that
[1:02:50] he's the Alpha and Omega in the in
[1:02:51] between but since the in between he's
[1:02:54] not here where is he now he's in the
[1:02:57] bride right now because the Holy Spirit
[1:03:00] is Jesus Christ himself in us we're
[1:03:03] continuing that Ministry and then later
[1:03:05] on we he will come we will be with him
[1:03:08] together amen so the bride is the in
[1:03:10] between
[1:03:11] because Christ is in the bride amen it
[1:03:14] it will end up the same because uh
[1:03:16] Christ is the mystery of God rebuild and
[1:03:18] the bride is the mystery of Christ
[1:03:21] revealed the bride is revealing Christ
[1:03:23] amen and and we're fulfilling that
[1:03:26] second purpose of God
[1:03:28] and what's the purpose or or what's the
[1:03:31] result when we uh when we fulfill the
[1:03:33] second purpose we will go back to Eden
[1:03:36] condition again and that means that's
[1:03:39] why we're the product product of the
[1:03:40] third pool which is speaking word
[1:03:42] condition amen we're the Bride of the
[1:03:44] eighth day amen so when we realize who
[1:03:48] we are it's always being
[1:03:50] harped on here or being pretty cheap
[1:03:53] that uh once we receive or we know what
[1:03:56] we are and who we are then the Rapture
[1:03:57] will go but it's already happening right
[1:03:59] now
[1:04:00] right we're just waiting for the actual
[1:04:02] meeting in the air it's only the chains
[1:04:06] of body that we're changing we're
[1:04:07] waiting for but if we die
[1:04:10] we die with the Lord if we live we live
[1:04:12] with the Lord therefore we live or we
[1:04:14] die we are we are the Lords so why worry
[1:04:18] amen so so what I'm saying is uh
[1:04:23] we have the power to speak
[1:04:25] right even though they cannot hear but
[1:04:28] God will hear the the the faith of the
[1:04:31] one that is speaking and that's us
[1:04:33] because God revealed it to us amen and
[1:04:36] we're so thankful and to that amen
[1:04:39] so
[1:04:41] so you can
[1:04:43] very popular song in the Philippines and
[1:04:46] goodness of God
[1:04:49] so
[1:04:52] that's how just so that you can see the
[1:05:00] then here comes the fun when they
[1:05:02] arrived January 3rd uh so we met in the
[1:05:06] airport and then we flew directly to
[1:05:10] to this island called the
[1:05:13] Quran and the airport is busuanga it's
[1:05:16] around an hour five minutes
[1:05:20] flight from Manila
[1:05:23] so this is I think I think his sister
[1:05:27] Lisa's uh picture this is the top view
[1:05:31] of or aerial view of Quran
[1:05:34] you can see the
[1:05:37] the good things there so
[1:05:40] yeah and we saw all this this came from
[1:05:44] our own cameras not not from Google
[1:05:47] so yeah so just I think some already saw
[1:05:51] this but
[1:05:52] I mean with the family but you can see
[1:05:56] the
[1:05:57] so we were able to to get our own boat
[1:06:00] there and uh so that we can go where not
[1:06:04] so many people are where the naked
[1:06:06] people are because we have our own world
[1:06:08] we created our own world because we have
[1:06:11] that power right so we just spoke the
[1:06:14] word and we we did it amen
[1:06:17] so yeah we
[1:06:19] you see the Coconuts there we some of
[1:06:23] the
[1:06:24] the bucket list of the boys I think were
[1:06:29] were checked you can say
[1:06:31] amen there's a lot of
[1:06:34] good fruits there tropical fruits
[1:06:36] coconut CIS and mangoes you can say
[1:06:38] there's a lot
[1:06:40] yeah okay
[1:06:43] so you see after after uh 15 hours of
[1:06:47] flight or 17 hours of flight so we have
[1:06:49] to make them Rest by going to the to the
[1:06:53] ocean I guess so
[1:06:55] and yeah this is this is a true story
[1:06:59] and it's not a Photoshop right so you
[1:07:03] yeah it's a beautiful place actually
[1:07:05] that's why I've been I've been saying
[1:07:08] when I introduced Branham our brother
[1:07:10] buried uh before he speaks uh when I
[1:07:13] told them that we came from Quran I told
[1:07:15] them if might have if if brother Branham
[1:07:19] visited coron he might have said also
[1:07:23] that he he would be a Filipino in the
[1:07:25] Millennium yeah it's so bad but you know
[1:07:28] because it's beautiful I think to cease
[1:07:30] to believe but then to feel also is to
[1:07:32] to believe it right so it's warm water
[1:07:35] blue turquoise
[1:07:37] yeah so
[1:07:39] yeah we have a very good photographer
[1:07:42] which is our tour guide the brother
[1:07:44] dodong and I will have a story
[1:07:47] I will not try to
[1:07:49] I'll check my time
[1:07:51] I hope you're not bored amen
[1:07:54] okay so we did a lot of uh
[1:07:58] a little bit of hiking here because this
[1:08:00] one is uh I forgot the lake you have to
[1:08:03] hike up and then hike down and this is a
[1:08:06] popular picture taking location
[1:08:10] so and then you will see all the things
[1:08:14] and then we had another day of fishing
[1:08:17] we rented another boat by ourselves at
[1:08:20] this uh of course with brother dodong
[1:08:23] uh
[1:08:25] we
[1:08:27] so I hope you're not stumbled that we we
[1:08:30] visited this but the thing is uh it's a
[1:08:32] good thing to show that there are good
[1:08:34] places also and then there are bad
[1:08:36] places but then the thing is with the
[1:08:37] bride wherever you go if you're with the
[1:08:39] bride you're always be sitting in
[1:08:41] Heavenly places because you're always
[1:08:43] talking about the Lord amen and and plus
[1:08:45] the the nature this is given by God and
[1:08:48] then we should just have to visit them
[1:08:50] it's not because we wanted to go or or
[1:08:53] you know to to take a real real vacation
[1:08:56] but this is not an expensive vacation
[1:08:58] because we know the people right uh
[1:09:01] brother don't know the owner of the boat
[1:09:03] that's why we were able to to uh to rent
[1:09:06] it and it's not
[1:09:07] it's not expensive that's what my point
[1:09:10] is amen if you know someone that's why
[1:09:13] the bread is the most connected person
[1:09:14] on Earth wherever you go is there a
[1:09:17] church here yes okay can I contact oh
[1:09:20] you you stay in our place you know and
[1:09:23] it happened right wherever you go look
[1:09:26] for the church amen that's the first
[1:09:28] thing that you need to do is there a
[1:09:29] church there amen
[1:09:33] yeah so yeah we had a
[1:09:36] God gave us a very good son here because
[1:09:41] the first day we we went there is a it's
[1:09:44] kind of rainy so but the next day the
[1:09:48] sun you can see the blue and and we I
[1:09:51] think I we caught how many five or so I
[1:09:53] think Isaac and Benjamin they they
[1:09:56] caught a lot yeah quite a few
[1:09:59] you can see oops sorry
[1:10:02] okay
[1:10:03] yeah and uh this is brother dodong
[1:10:06] actually
[1:10:07] but then the thing is we ask
[1:10:09] uh before we we went there we asked for
[1:10:12] a Believer uh Believers Church and then
[1:10:16] they gave us some contacts and then we
[1:10:18] contacted them and then they gave they
[1:10:20] told us that uh a certain brother dodong
[1:10:23] is a tourist guide in one of the uh tour
[1:10:27] tour companies there so we contacted
[1:10:31] that tour uh to our company and then we
[1:10:34] want the tour guide to be brother dodo
[1:10:36] and then they gave us brother dodong and
[1:10:38] this is brother dodong but then the
[1:10:40] thing is when when we met him he's
[1:10:41] wearing shorts he's uh and then he's
[1:10:45] talking about uh his presbyter having
[1:10:47] Revival and everything but uh we
[1:10:50] every all of those uh statements we
[1:10:54] didn't think
[1:10:56] uh twice that he's a Believer maybe he's
[1:10:58] just new in the message but then later
[1:11:00] on we found out that he he's another
[1:11:03] brother dodong
[1:11:06] there's another brother dodong that is a
[1:11:08] real message believer but he's a message
[1:11:10] but he is a very sweet guy and now he
[1:11:14] asks us to uh for help basically uh
[1:11:18] regarding what we believe because he saw
[1:11:20] the life in us so he wants to to preach
[1:11:24] to his family he wants to know the word
[1:11:27] so
[1:11:28] right now we we prepared some Bibles and
[1:11:32] and and the message of the hour in his
[1:11:34] own language and it's ready to be
[1:11:36] shipped we were able to to secure some
[1:11:39] message of the hour uh translated in in
[1:11:42] his local language and thank we thank
[1:11:45] the message hub for that because they
[1:11:48] printed a lot of uh those things you can
[1:11:51] see that there are there are good things
[1:11:53] that will result from from those because
[1:11:55] uh he he doesn't speak English very well
[1:11:58] but then the thing is if if he will uh
[1:12:01] read the the message in English he might
[1:12:03] not understand but there's some
[1:12:04] translation in the local dialect of my
[1:12:06] wife basically so yeah it's ready to be
[1:12:09] shipped and uh we want him to be
[1:12:11] connected with brother Dany also so that
[1:12:13] at least he can be in the right uh right
[1:12:17] atmosphere and right teaching but then
[1:12:20] the thing is yeah you can see
[1:12:23] this is his family he has six children
[1:12:26] and he has this uh
[1:12:28] motorbike with this they call it kalon
[1:12:31] kalon so this is how they they uh
[1:12:34] commute there so uh Bradberry has the
[1:12:38] heart to to help him because that when
[1:12:40] while we were there he got the motorbike
[1:12:43] uh you know broken so with hundred
[1:12:46] dollars I guess he was able to fix it so
[1:12:48] praise the Lord and then they visited Us
[1:12:51] in the in the hotel and uh they are
[1:12:53] sweet people you can see but the the
[1:12:55] thing is uh you know uh what I'm saying
[1:12:59] is about the law of contrast we might be
[1:13:01] living luxurious here or or comfortably
[1:13:05] but then we visited their home and I'll
[1:13:08] show you the picture this is their home
[1:13:10] so we went there like a mission trip you
[1:13:13] can see The Shanty here where they live
[1:13:16] so you can see their small table here
[1:13:19] this is where they cook with coal or or
[1:13:22] wood then this is uh where's there yeah
[1:13:27] this after the picture this is maybe
[1:13:30] four by four this is all their room with
[1:13:34] with eight people uh uh sleeping on it
[1:13:37] so the mother mom and dad and the six uh
[1:13:41] children they're all
[1:13:43] uh living here or sleeping here that's
[1:13:46] that's how they they live there
[1:13:48] so and his job is a tour guide which is
[1:13:52] around uh twelve dollars a day
[1:13:55] that's that's his pay and then when we
[1:13:58] met him he was so
[1:14:00] uh blessed and he was saying it was a
[1:14:04] pleasure knowing you and he thanked us a
[1:14:07] lot because of course we gave him tip
[1:14:09] and uh because we thought he was a
[1:14:11] Believer also and he's good to us and
[1:14:13] you know he's a very good tour guide we
[1:14:16] went a lot a lot of uh
[1:14:18] you can say uh
[1:14:21] uh snorkeling and uh diving and all this
[1:14:26] stuff he he was a very good uh person
[1:14:29] amen but we tried to help him because
[1:14:32] because he has a good heart amen and he
[1:14:35] was blessed we are blessed too
[1:14:37] amen so this is the church we we didn't
[1:14:39] think of anything here because it says
[1:14:41] it says Jesus Christ believer church but
[1:14:44] then when I asked the people from Manila
[1:14:46] do you know this church they said no and
[1:14:48] then they're talking about a presbyter
[1:14:50] so it look we found out later that
[1:14:53] they're Presbyterians and uh they're
[1:14:56] talking about their their Bishop
[1:14:59] basically their their Presbyterian who's
[1:15:00] doing the Revival but then when we met
[1:15:02] him me and Barbarian and it looks like
[1:15:06] it's kind of aloof but anyway so at
[1:15:09] least we we can extend our Grace to them
[1:15:12] amen and uh I think that this is the
[1:15:15] wife of the pastor there
[1:15:17] and this is the president you can see so
[1:15:19] there's some red flags are these real
[1:15:22] Believers because they're all in shorts
[1:15:24] I guess almost so looks like they're not
[1:15:26] and then we found out later but then
[1:15:28] without knowing at all but uh you don't
[1:15:30] judge right but then until until you
[1:15:32] find out but it's good to meet them
[1:15:35] actually this pastor here he's the
[1:15:37] pastor he had the he had a very good
[1:15:39] testimonial as well he was shot many
[1:15:42] times I guess and he showed all the
[1:15:44] bullet uh all the old bullet holes in
[1:15:48] his in his body and his uh leg Yeah so
[1:15:52] he's a living testimony of of what God
[1:15:56] is doing although he's not a Believer
[1:15:57] yet we're claiming that they're not
[1:16:00] Believers yet but then the thing is time
[1:16:03] comes when who knows berardo might be
[1:16:05] the instrument to to uh because he's the
[1:16:09] brother-in-law of brother they live
[1:16:11] close by so they they're just side by
[1:16:13] side in the same area basically
[1:16:17] okay so this is our hotel and they
[1:16:19] visited us before we left the Quran
[1:16:22] and uh yeah it's another so actually
[1:16:25] this one is a it's not sequential so
[1:16:28] miles just and my wife prepared this but
[1:16:31] then the thing is we were hoping to go
[1:16:34] to an island that where nobody is and
[1:16:36] actually Christopher was hoping that
[1:16:39] there will be a coconut in that Island
[1:16:42] and then God gave us the favor right and
[1:16:45] we we ducked the boat ducked in this
[1:16:47] island and where we were alone but there
[1:16:50] there are a couple and a little child
[1:16:53] that that were living here for decades
[1:16:55] the little child is just two years old
[1:16:57] it's the it's their grand
[1:17:00] grandson but then you can see the the
[1:17:03] thing there is a white beach with the
[1:17:06] uh warm water so we did a lot of
[1:17:09] swimming and snorkeling here so that's
[1:17:11] uh Christopher he's back at least to to
[1:17:15] go up the coconut tree amen and uh oh is
[1:17:19] that Miles you cannot see him but that
[1:17:21] smiles too
[1:17:22] uh
[1:17:24] yeah these are the couple and then yeah
[1:17:27] this is the young their grand grandson
[1:17:31] basically
[1:17:33] so we did a lot of
[1:17:36] uh
[1:17:37] uh kayaking also amen so January 7 we
[1:17:41] went back to Manila then that started
[1:17:44] the
[1:17:45] uh for Burberry to minister so January
[1:17:48] 7th we have a little bit a little
[1:17:50] get-together uh
[1:17:53] with with the young kids and also we
[1:17:57] played the uh some gym it's a gym night
[1:18:00] basically so actually uh just a little
[1:18:03] bit of a testimony the the lady on the
[1:18:05] left here
[1:18:06] uh she lost a child when when when the
[1:18:10] child was about to be one year old
[1:18:12] that's what I heard
[1:18:13] and and the second one is Micah the
[1:18:17] sister or daughter-in-law of brother
[1:18:19] Danny and then she's praying they are
[1:18:21] praying for for a child and then why am
[1:18:25] I why am I uh telling these stories
[1:18:27] because when Barbara Berry preached the
[1:18:30] next day on the 8th he talked about uh
[1:18:34] he talked about the testimony of losing
[1:18:36] a child
[1:18:37] and that related to the person and then
[1:18:40] I think he was the one who was shouting
[1:18:42] and uh and then at the same time the
[1:18:44] other one is Micah who's
[1:18:46] praying for a
[1:18:48] for for your chat for a child and then
[1:18:51] he actually he's a very good com she she
[1:18:54] is a very good composer and a and a
[1:18:57] singer and
[1:18:58] she just sung that song during that time
[1:19:01] and uh I forgot the the lyrics uh isn't
[1:19:05] it that I gave you Isaac something like
[1:19:07] that and then Bradberry preached on it
[1:19:10] that uh
[1:19:11] that they have Isaac after after Timothy
[1:19:14] then it was real blessing then you can
[1:19:17] you can see the the move of the Holy
[1:19:19] Spirit during the service and
[1:19:22] yeah yeah the testimonies are personal
[1:19:24] right so the thing is no one can take
[1:19:27] them away it's like what education is is
[1:19:30] if you're educated no one can take it
[1:19:32] away if the holy spirit is with you no
[1:19:34] one can take it away from you amen and
[1:19:36] it's the same with our testimony they
[1:19:39] are personal and they are I cannot
[1:19:42] borrow some somebody somebody else's
[1:19:43] testimony right and uh and it it it was
[1:19:48] a great service you can I can say that
[1:19:50] and uh there's there are lots of uh good
[1:19:53] things that they they they posted and
[1:19:56] then they they told us and and we sent
[1:19:58] them to to Burberry because they're
[1:20:00] thinking brother for coming you know the
[1:20:03] Pastoral thing that they preach here
[1:20:04] like the proper positioning of uh the
[1:20:08] the husband the wife and the children it
[1:20:10] was a real blessing even brother Daniel
[1:20:12] was telling me it was done it was a
[1:20:16] great uh mission trip you can say
[1:20:18] because a pastor will it's a pastoral
[1:20:21] message that that they receive amen and
[1:20:24] they were thankful about it and he
[1:20:27] preached a perfect strength and perfect
[1:20:28] weakness on the morning of the of uh of
[1:20:33] January 8th and then yeah you can see
[1:20:37] here that's the song service
[1:20:45] okay some pictures after the service
[1:20:48] uh you know every time there's a lot of
[1:20:50] food but I didn't show a lot of food
[1:20:52] there uh
[1:20:55] and in the evening we went to uh elect
[1:20:58] bright assembly I think sister Shelley
[1:21:00] and bra Ken went there and uh with
[1:21:02] Brother Ray Ray Soriano uh
[1:21:06] we we he uh brother very preached there
[1:21:09] too
[1:21:10] so you can see yeah this the one I like
[1:21:13] bright assembly I think sister Shelley
[1:21:14] might I think brother Ken was sitting on
[1:21:17] on the other side here before uh when we
[1:21:20] when we streamed that and uh
[1:21:24] they are also very established church
[1:21:26] and they have maybe 600 800 people and
[1:21:30] then they have five groups
[1:21:32] and they cannot fit in in this small uh
[1:21:37] church that's why they're they're
[1:21:39] planning to build a bigger church and
[1:21:42] imagine only two groups can fit and then
[1:21:45] they have five groups so it means two in
[1:21:47] the morning two in the evening and one
[1:21:48] will not be in the church will be
[1:21:50] streaming right so it's a it's a it's a
[1:21:53] bit challenging and uh yeah it's a very
[1:21:55] established church and uh yeah they love
[1:21:57] the they love the world basically we had
[1:22:00] a very good Fellowship after as well uh
[1:22:03] with the
[1:22:07] I'll skip some and this is Brother Ray
[1:22:09] basically Brother Ray Soriano
[1:22:12] so yeah we have some pictures here
[1:22:16] and Hometown Angeles this is our home
[1:22:18] when we went that's our rest rest Place
[1:22:21] basically so we have actually a one one
[1:22:25] three here which it's called Chico and
[1:22:27] we call it the Mana tree because every
[1:22:29] day there are some droppings they are
[1:22:33] very sweet like you can say sugary uh
[1:22:37] sugary fruit that it's like real sugar
[1:22:40] and they're very sweet every morning
[1:22:42] because the bats will take the the good
[1:22:44] ones and they will drop because we don't
[1:22:45] have anything to to to go up the trees
[1:22:48] they they just drop so every day there's
[1:22:50] there's some monetary maybe around five
[1:22:52] or six big ones and we just cut them and
[1:22:55] I think the boys love them so and sister
[1:22:58] Lisa and Barbara too so we have a good
[1:23:01] Fellowship here
[1:23:03] lots of coconuts as well here and
[1:23:05] actually this is a mango tree but it
[1:23:07] doesn't bear fruit yet
[1:23:09] yeah lots of food local ones
[1:23:12] and we visited one of the churches one
[1:23:15] of the outreaches of browardani also
[1:23:18] which is a church that that is being
[1:23:20] built and uh Burberry has that desire
[1:23:23] also to help and he gave them a little
[1:23:25] help here I think for the roof so we
[1:23:28] will find the roof we will see the roof
[1:23:30] we will see the the result you can see
[1:23:33] and uh we know that's that's the reason
[1:23:36] why it's good also to go there by
[1:23:38] ourselves and then we will see the
[1:23:39] actual work it's not only by picture so
[1:23:42] you can see they got the picture with
[1:23:45] the with the thing and then later on you
[1:23:47] will see how it evolves how it
[1:23:49] progresses amen
[1:23:50] so
[1:23:52] I know that that's Mission so yeah it's
[1:23:54] kind of pretty good sized building
[1:23:59] yeah and we gave Bibles as well amen
[1:24:03] yeah this is the pastor Pastor June uh
[1:24:08] lots of food again they waited for us
[1:24:10] although we were late yeah so but they
[1:24:14] they always serve you like a king or
[1:24:16] whatever the best that they have they
[1:24:19] will serve you that's the that's how
[1:24:21] they that's how the bride serves the
[1:24:23] bride you can say Amen
[1:24:26] so and I forget how old was she 90 93
[1:24:31] and then they have a good conversation
[1:24:32] she's very good in English and and she
[1:24:34] said you are like me you're beautiful so
[1:24:39] yeah so we are both beautiful she said
[1:24:42] so
[1:24:44] yeah and another church so this is in
[1:24:46] the evening already uh very very pretty
[1:24:50] and burden is always the The Interpreter
[1:24:52] in Tagalog
[1:24:53] amen so actually he was asking where
[1:24:57] Barry was asking Josh the technician how
[1:25:00] come we don't do this he said but he in
[1:25:03] in the Philippines it's very common that
[1:25:04] while I will read or or whoever the
[1:25:07] preacher is uh if he doesn't have the
[1:25:11] notes then it will be posted like this
[1:25:13] together while while he's uh reading the
[1:25:16] quotes and they can do that even the
[1:25:18] scriptures so maybe we should do that
[1:25:20] maybe that's that's doable right so and
[1:25:24] it's not it's they've been doing this
[1:25:26] since maybe 10 years ago even when
[1:25:28] briarcan was there I think they've been
[1:25:30] doing that so it means it's not a new
[1:25:31] technology but we should just adopt it
[1:25:33] because it's very convenient when okay
[1:25:36] open this and then someone will post it
[1:25:39] right the scripture and the quotes and
[1:25:41] with the technology it's easier to do
[1:25:43] amen so
[1:25:45] yeah okay and this side uh pictures lots
[1:25:51] of pictures it's good to visit
[1:25:52] the the the bride of Christ wherever
[1:25:55] they are because you have a common
[1:25:56] denominator you're always talking about
[1:25:58] the Lord amen there's nothing No Malice
[1:26:02] no nothing it's always the Lord amen the
[1:26:04] goodness and uh you know it's that's why
[1:26:08] we if there's a chance of course we want
[1:26:11] to go again uh that's that's the thing
[1:26:13] it's not it's not because uh we live
[1:26:16] there that's why we have a we have a
[1:26:17] place there so if we are there then
[1:26:19] might as well you know visit the
[1:26:21] churches because uh you'll never know
[1:26:23] how how you could be a blessing to them
[1:26:26] they are being blessed and you are
[1:26:28] blessed and the fellowship the the thing
[1:26:31] that you're learning and then you can
[1:26:34] feel their pain also it means because
[1:26:36] this world is not our home right and
[1:26:41] here we're always Bound By by work
[1:26:46] basically and and the things that we
[1:26:48] want to achieve here uh naturally but
[1:26:51] then for them I think of course they
[1:26:53] want to strive as well but then the
[1:26:55] thing is even they are poor they have
[1:26:57] the Lord that's why they're always happy
[1:26:59] you can say uh depression There is
[1:27:03] almost not a a word before but uh yeah
[1:27:08] yeah because their life is typically the
[1:27:11] depression itself it's kind of there's
[1:27:14] so many there's so many places there
[1:27:16] that are not so well off it's really
[1:27:19] just you know 12 a day that's that's
[1:27:23] just your McDonald's Maybe right so but
[1:27:26] for them that's their whole thing for
[1:27:28] the day so yeah but uh with the churches
[1:27:31] that's their Oasis when they gather
[1:27:34] together and then you can see the food
[1:27:35] that they serve to us it's a lot
[1:27:38] we had the feast we had the spread at
[1:27:41] that time amen I will try to okay I
[1:27:45] still have a video uh miles prepared a
[1:27:49] video after this also we we gave the the
[1:27:51] ministers
[1:27:52] some bags because they do missions and
[1:27:55] then they do mostly most of the time
[1:27:57] they do a motorbike so yeah we give them
[1:28:01] backpacks these are all pastors
[1:28:05] and
[1:28:09] yeah and
[1:28:12] you can see some relaxation sometimes
[1:28:14] because every other day you have to
[1:28:15] relax because you have to travel two
[1:28:17] hours here two hours there so our bodies
[1:28:20] need to relax too that's why I cannot
[1:28:22] blame sister at least I get a little bit
[1:28:23] ill but amen but God is in control amen
[1:28:27] and this is the place where
[1:28:30] where there's a lot of fun also here we
[1:28:33] had a lot of coconuts and this for this
[1:28:36] one
[1:28:37] the church donated the the flooring here
[1:28:41] so before there's no it's it's uh it's
[1:28:45] what they call dirt but now you can see
[1:28:47] they already poured the concrete
[1:28:49] and the church helped on that
[1:28:52] and and very very pretty oh I think it's
[1:28:56] not actually preaching our only
[1:28:57] exhortation because sister Elisa was not
[1:29:00] feeling well at that time so it's only
[1:29:02] around 30 minutes or so but we had a
[1:29:05] good time here with the a lot of food as
[1:29:07] well
[1:29:08] and uh okay and then this is another
[1:29:12] church where we went and
[1:29:14] where where Christopher uh gave the
[1:29:18] special
[1:29:19] amen and uh
[1:29:23] yeah
[1:29:25] okay and uh
[1:29:27] hey lots of pictures with the
[1:29:31] this is brother Danny
[1:29:33] basically okay just to so that you would
[1:29:37] know
[1:29:38] I think
[1:29:40] yeah this is brother Danny is the the
[1:29:42] one who's our host Pastor basically he
[1:29:44] was the one who who arranged the
[1:29:46] itinerary and this is his wife and these
[1:29:49] are pastors wives basically so these are
[1:29:53] other pastors I know you you won't
[1:29:55] remember them so I won't mention their
[1:29:57] name so and the young people lots of
[1:30:00] young people
[1:30:01] and uh
[1:30:03] you can see
[1:30:05] the church was full at that time it's a
[1:30:08] Wednesday night but you can see
[1:30:10] uh lots of people and then again food
[1:30:13] right so
[1:30:15] yeah these are the pastors close by so
[1:30:18] they they just congregated together in
[1:30:20] one so that it's a joint Fellowship
[1:30:23] if we can do that that's so nice I mean
[1:30:25] with different churches congregating why
[1:30:27] not right so and you're preaching the
[1:30:30] same word anyway amen
[1:30:31] and yeah this is the camp Campground
[1:30:35] where we went after so we we we had some
[1:30:39] pomelos we we picked some fruits there
[1:30:43] so and yeah we had the good Fellowship
[1:30:47] with the
[1:30:49] with the brothers there and we picked
[1:30:51] ourselves uh dos pomelos you might find
[1:30:54] them in Superstore right so yeah and
[1:30:58] this is the eagle you might have seen it
[1:31:00] that brother bear is uh
[1:31:02] so it was given this one was curved by a
[1:31:06] brother
[1:31:08] it was given to brother Danny but then
[1:31:10] it was a blockade for brother Berry so
[1:31:12] you will find it it's it's amazing it it
[1:31:16] was handcrafted very very nice
[1:31:19] amen so
[1:31:22] yeah okay
[1:31:24] some of the good stuff there up to relax
[1:31:27] and there are some a houses that they
[1:31:31] will build so that if a visiting
[1:31:33] Minister will come or if we will be
[1:31:35] there so it will be a maybe around five
[1:31:38] by four meters
[1:31:40] and then it will be just like a house
[1:31:42] that that will be built there will be a
[1:31:45] prototype and then it will be mass
[1:31:47] produced whoever wants to have an area
[1:31:49] there because it's a pretty decent size
[1:31:51] of a of a campground so whoever has the
[1:31:55] money then he will be allowed to it's
[1:31:57] just like a timeshare but then for those
[1:32:00] who who has money only right so it might
[1:32:02] cost around uh I don't know three maybe
[1:32:06] five thousand dollars that's all to
[1:32:08] finish with all all of it but it depends
[1:32:11] on how far you want to go
[1:32:13] then it will be like a timeshare maybe
[1:32:15] one week there and you will have a good
[1:32:18] time with the Believers amen so yeah we
[1:32:21] we got one so
[1:32:23] whoever will come will have that place
[1:32:26] so yeah so and this is our place before
[1:32:29] we left so yeah uh this basketball court
[1:32:32] before we before we came it's not there
[1:32:35] but then the thing is uh it was so that
[1:32:37] at least the boys can can enjoy and we
[1:32:39] enjoy too and Miles also for a short
[1:32:42] time yeah so this is our home there we
[1:32:46] have this our compound and this is the
[1:32:48] del mundo family that visited us
[1:32:51] and yeah January 15 because we extended
[1:32:55] a bit and then immediately they asked
[1:32:56] can you please the next day so okay uh
[1:33:00] yeah we we went to this is one of the
[1:33:03] outreaches of brother Daniel so you see
[1:33:05] how established now they yeah they
[1:33:08] they're kind of and the young people are
[1:33:11] the ones who are funding the finishing
[1:33:14] of the church so that's how how good
[1:33:17] they are of course to start it it came
[1:33:19] from Joe Green from North Carolina with
[1:33:22] little maybe I don't know uh seven
[1:33:25] thousand five hundred dollars to start
[1:33:27] but then the thing is this one is
[1:33:28] already
[1:33:29] around maybe 20 000 already but through
[1:33:33] the through the local ones so of course
[1:33:35] you must have skin in the game right it
[1:33:37] must be the members who who should be uh
[1:33:40] uh continuing it's not always asking
[1:33:42] money but to start of course this is in
[1:33:44] Manila so it's very expensive to to get
[1:33:47] uh to get the uh a lot or or a property
[1:33:51] and it was a very good testimony they
[1:33:54] told us
[1:33:54] they just they said there's some uh
[1:33:57] ghosts there that's why they wanted to
[1:33:59] sell that's why it was very cheap that
[1:34:02] they had and the ghost now it became a
[1:34:04] Holy Ghost
[1:34:06] yeah
[1:34:08] amen so yeah there's a lot of good
[1:34:11] testimonies there okay so yeah these are
[1:34:14] this this is the pastor uh Pastor Dennis
[1:34:17] and these are his deacons actually seven
[1:34:19] years ago we were able to to visit and
[1:34:23] the church is still starting and we were
[1:34:25] they asked me to pray for the deacons uh
[1:34:28] because at that time they're just
[1:34:29] starting and now it's kind of very
[1:34:31] established already if you if you see it
[1:34:34] it's they they did a very good job and
[1:34:36] it's because of the young people and and
[1:34:39] of course the members so they have
[1:34:40] burden for their church right that's why
[1:34:42] they they grew
[1:34:44] amen so yeah okay so maybe I'll I'll
[1:34:50] show the the video that Miles uh
[1:34:52] prepared and then we can
[1:34:54] we can close uh it's it's not sequential
[1:34:57] but at least you will find a little bit
[1:34:59] of a summary of what we did good uh I
[1:35:02] mean mostly good I guess the one that he
[1:35:05] showed the uh but uh
[1:35:08] you can see
[1:35:10] God is good amen and uh I know we don't
[1:35:13] have much time
[1:35:15] you can see the the goodness of the Lord
[1:35:19] and wherever you go if if you're
[1:35:21] bringing the name of the Lord you will
[1:35:23] act like like him amen and you want to
[1:35:26] conduct yourself
