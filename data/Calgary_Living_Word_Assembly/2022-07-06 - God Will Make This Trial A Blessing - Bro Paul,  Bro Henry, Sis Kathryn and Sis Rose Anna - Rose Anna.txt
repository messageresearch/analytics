========================================
oh I just come into a valley like I've never seen before I keep searching for a way out seems like padlocks are on the door or there must be another sunrise and another Sunset that I see God will make this trial a blessing just be patient you will see we'll see oh God please [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] come into this place to see every child of God you test he must face it is here that God will mold you and make you what you ought to be God will make this trial a blessing just be patient you will see oh God [Music] all together well I'm standing on the mountains [Music] foreign [Music] there's no need to get discouraged [Music] [Applause] oh yes my God will make this right a blessing though it sends me to my knees though my tearsity [Music] thank you [Music]
