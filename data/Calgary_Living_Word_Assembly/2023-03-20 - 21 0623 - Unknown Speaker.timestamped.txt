[42:33] grace and His glory where the saints of
[42:40] God will be
[42:43] that sounds like home to
[42:48] me thinking of that little stanza there
[42:49] the hills will Echo with the story
[42:51] remember brother random song or is his
[42:53] his story he said when you hear me
[42:55] singing Amazing Grace a voice down in
[42:57] the valley he said Oh Brother Brad I
[42:59] made it
[43:00] I believe our songs will resonate
[43:03] through the Hills of Glory
[43:05] we'll be singing I will be I trust you
[43:08] will be
[43:09] maybe I love singing more than others
[43:11] but
[43:12] I just tend to think that worship will
[43:14] be part of our life all through eternity
[43:16] he's so worthy of it Turn Your Eyes Upon
[43:19] Jesus where else would you want to turn
[43:21] let's let's turn to him tonight as we
[43:23] invite our pastor a couple more courses
[43:26] will too
[43:28] [Music]
[43:35] Jesus
[43:36] oh look for in his
[43:41] wonderful face
[43:46] and the things
[43:55] [Music]
[44:00] glory and grace one more time
[44:06] your eyes
[44:09] Upon Jesus
[44:12] Jesus
[44:13] [Music]
[44:21] [Music]
[44:32] [Music]
[44:48] though these ships been battered aren't
[44:53] you thankful for that tonight oh yes the
[44:56] egg holds oh the lovely Lord Jesus
[44:59] [Music]
[45:03] I told
[45:08] [Music]
[45:12] it on my knees as I face Life's a raging
[45:20] Seas but the anchor
[45:24] holds
[45:27] in spite of this storm what a promise oh
[45:32] yes the anger home
[45:38] oh the ships been battered
[45:46] thank you
[46:01] foreign
[46:11] [Music]
[46:23] it's a pretty amazing promise
[46:27] to know that as the storm rages
[46:30] the anchor just goes deeper
[46:33] you know that story about how a tree
[46:35] gets stronger and taller
[46:38] it's because of the storm it's because
[46:40] of the wind causes the tree to stretch
[46:43] and lean
[46:45] and causes the roots to pull
[46:48] and stretch
[46:50] and be able to grow deeper and if we
[46:53] didn't have the storms in life we
[46:55] wouldn't be able to plant Our Roots
[46:56] deeper either
[46:58] it's part of the natural course that God
[47:01] has chosen for us in our day
[47:04] but we know
[47:06] that when the enemy comes in like a
[47:08] flood
[47:09] spirit of God raises a standard against
[47:12] it
[47:13] and we can see that in our individual
[47:15] lives and experience it in our
[47:17] individual circumstances
[47:19] but I think sometimes it's worth to just
[47:22] step back and look at the big picture
[47:24] and realize that the enemy has come in
[47:28] like a flood to this generation and God
[47:31] has raised a standard against it and
[47:34] that standard is the brothers and the
[47:37] sisters who receive the word for their
[47:39] day the ability to overcome and
[47:42] withstand Satan
[47:44] not by anything that they could ever do
[47:47] but simply by their testimony and the
[47:49] blood of the Lamb
[47:52] let's just go to him in prayer
[47:54] if anybody has a prayer request just
[47:56] make it known to him with an uplifted
[47:58] hand like to continue to remember
[48:00] brother Jonah the Saints in Kelowna for
[48:03] the John Drake is in need of a a lung
[48:06] transplant with covid in the hospital
[48:10] we just pray for the the Saints there
[48:12] and every other need tonight
[48:15] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so
[48:18] thankful that we can call you father
[48:20] we're so thankful that we can call you
[48:23] Lord
[48:24] because your word says that the only way
[48:26] we could ever do that is by your Holy
[48:28] Ghost by your Holy Spirit living out
[48:31] through US Lord
[48:33] father tonight I pray that Lord if
[48:35] there's anything in our lives that would
[48:37] be displeasing unto you that you would
[48:39] just forgive us for it now
[48:41] Lord I pray that if there's anything in
[48:43] our lives that would clog up the
[48:45] channels Lord Jesus father that you
[48:48] would just Purge it from us now that you
[48:51] would just take away all sin and all
[48:53] iniquity in our lives Lord Jesus that we
[48:56] could just be washed out and and
[48:57] cleansed by the blood of the Lamb
[49:01] rather that we could come before your
[49:03] throne with boldness tonight
[49:05] Lord Jesus the way that you have
[49:07] instructed us to the way that we would
[49:09] want our children to come unto us to not
[49:12] be afraid to not have any guilt to not
[49:15] have any shame but to recognize that the
[49:17] only way you see us is the way that you
[49:20] created us
[49:22] and father tonight we just want to
[49:24] remember the prayer requests as we
[49:26] mention them Father firstly the uplifted
[49:28] hands everyone who has the need Lord
[49:30] Jesus you know the need behind the hand
[49:33] and we thank you Father that you already
[49:35] have a solution to that need before it
[49:39] was even mentioned by the raising of the
[49:42] hand father we pray for the Saints in
[49:45] Kelowna Lord Jesus our brothers and
[49:47] sisters
[49:48] who are affected by coved Lord Lord in
[49:51] the very specific situation a pastor who
[49:53] has been laid down in in a in a
[49:56] situation where he can't even be with
[49:58] those those people that need his support
[50:00] Lord Jesus to look at what Satan's
[50:03] trying to do to the situation but we
[50:05] know that he will not Prevail that he
[50:08] cannot Prevail that your word is the
[50:11] only thing that will prevail and father
[50:13] we just stand United with our brothers
[50:16] and our sisters in Kelowna tonight and
[50:18] we just ask that you would touch them
[50:20] all that you would heal them all that
[50:22] you would raise them back up again
[50:23] father Lord that our brother wouldn't
[50:25] need to have a lung transplant because
[50:27] the great physician has come by and
[50:30] already transplanted his lungs in the
[50:32] name of Jesus we ask it father we just
[50:35] love you and we thank you we pray that
[50:37] you would bless our little service here
[50:38] tonight Lord father we ask that I could
[50:40] just get out of the way and that you
[50:42] could come by here father and that you
[50:44] could speak to us Lord that you could
[50:46] speak through US father that you would
[50:48] give us ears to hear what the spirit has
[50:51] to say and Lord Jesus a heart to receive
[50:53] that word tonight father in its fullness
[50:56] we just love you and we thank you and we
[50:58] just ask all these things now in Jesus
[51:00] Christ's name amen
[51:03] Hallelujah God bless you thank you
[51:06] musicians tonight if you have your
[51:07] Bibles I'd like to read from Hebrews
[51:09] chapter 10.
[51:14] Hebrews chapter 10. we'll just start
[51:17] reading with verse one in Hebrews
[51:19] chapter 10.
[51:21] I trust everyone's having a good week so
[51:24] far it's definitely been beautiful
[51:26] weather
[51:29] so nice to see it's one extreme to the
[51:32] other though in our climate we find that
[51:34] uh
[51:35] just when we start to get used to one
[51:37] temperature and one climate we start to
[51:39] climatize
[51:41] then it changes for us and it goes the
[51:43] other way
[51:45] in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1
[51:50] for the law
[51:51] having a shadow of good things to come
[51:54] and not the very image of the things
[51:58] can never
[52:00] with those sacrifices which they offer
[52:03] year by year continually make the
[52:06] Commerce there unto perfect
[52:09] for then would they not have ceased to
[52:11] be offered
[52:13] because that the worshipers once purged
[52:16] should have had no more conscience of
[52:20] sins
[52:22] but in those sacrifices there is a
[52:25] remembrance again made of sins every
[52:28] year
[52:30] for it is not possible that the blood of
[52:33] bulls and goats
[52:35] should take away sins
[52:38] wherefore
[52:39] when he cometh into the world he saith
[52:43] sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not
[52:47] but a body hast thou prepared me
[52:52] let's just bow one more time
[52:54] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[52:56] tonight as we
[52:58] speak about the Natural Things father
[53:02] we just pray that you would reveal the
[53:04] spiritual
[53:06] father we pray that tonight we wouldn't
[53:08] be talking about the natural things and
[53:11] and dwelling upon natural circumstances
[53:13] but father that you would just take us
[53:15] into the heavenlies Lord that we could
[53:18] just see the spiritual word tonight
[53:21] father that you would speak to our our
[53:23] souls tonight father Lord Jesus that one
[53:27] more time your sheep would be fed Lord
[53:30] Jesus that you would be glorified in all
[53:33] that's said and done we want this
[53:34] service to be all about you tonight
[53:36] father even as we speak about the
[53:39] natural things pertaining to the weather
[53:41] Lord Jesus we know that it changes
[53:43] continually and we just can never really
[53:45] predict it but we're so thankful there's
[53:47] one thing that never changes Lord your
[53:50] word says that heavens and earth will
[53:52] pass away but your word will remain
[53:54] father help us to eat the book tonight
[53:57] Lord Jesus one more time
[53:59] we just ask all these things in Jesus
[54:01] Christ's name we pray amen
[54:04] God bless you tonight you may be seated
[54:09] I just had this thought that I couldn't
[54:11] get rid of so I felt that it was the
[54:14] Lord once again leading so here we go
[54:19] the thought about a body
[54:21] hast thou prepared
[54:25] and we know that
[54:27] we're speaking in in Hebrews here Paul
[54:30] is talking about
[54:32] the contrast between
[54:34] law and Grace
[54:37] and how the law under the law according
[54:39] to Moses law
[54:41] offering the blood of bulls and goats
[54:44] would never do away with sin would never
[54:47] get rid of it entirely
[54:50] it never could because not one animal
[54:53] could ever be a Kinsmen Redeemer
[54:58] just uh
[55:01] I think it's amazing when we look at it
[55:03] to think that a body hast thou prepared
[55:05] me
[55:06] because if we look at ourselves
[55:08] we are that body for today
[55:11] we are the body that he has chosen today
[55:14] that person that is purged from sin that
[55:17] comes in one time because of the
[55:20] testimony of someone else the life that
[55:22] lives out through them
[55:24] when they die out to themselves and they
[55:27] become a new creature in Christ Jesus
[55:29] many times I think we can look at it and
[55:31] see it as as we become a new creature
[55:34] it's it's it's a it's a mixing of our
[55:37] our old self mostly dead and and this
[55:40] new desire to live in a Christian Realm
[55:43] but that's not it at all brothers and
[55:45] sisters becoming a new creature in
[55:49] Christ Jesus means that we literally are
[55:52] becoming the Lord Jesus Christ in our
[55:55] flesh we are not living according to a
[55:58] mixing of our old selves and a mixing of
[56:01] the desire to be the new person the new
[56:04] creature in Christ Jesus we literally
[56:06] have to die out to ourselves and we said
[56:08] it many many times brother Branham says
[56:10] it in invisible Union the old man has to
[56:13] die
[56:13] every single Speck of the old man has to
[56:16] die
[56:18] speaking tonight about a body
[56:21] a body hast thou prepared me
[56:24] many different ways we can look at the
[56:26] body we can look at the body as the
[56:27] general body the mystical body of the
[56:30] Lord Jesus Christ
[56:32] but I think tonight more than anything
[56:33] I'd like to talk about the individual
[56:36] body
[56:37] the individual Temple
[56:39] the individual
[56:41] being the body of Jesus Christ if we can
[56:45] go through our lives looking at
[56:47] ourselves that way that we are his
[56:50] choice we are his body when he came to
[56:53] Earth the first time he chose Adam to be
[56:57] his body Adam was God on Earth god
[57:01] Jehovah was God in heaven but Adam was
[57:05] God's choice to be God on Earth in in
[57:07] the Book of Genesis in the very
[57:09] beginning but Adam being in that God
[57:12] position didn't realize that when he
[57:14] tried to step into death he couldn't
[57:17] step back into life and what he found
[57:20] was he actually contravened the word of
[57:22] God and brought death to all mankind we
[57:26] know that the the Temptation came
[57:28] through the woman that Adam was not
[57:30] deceived that it actually was a willful
[57:33] act of Adam to follow his wife because
[57:37] he loved her but it was the ultimate
[57:39] plan of God a a display of his love for
[57:42] his bride
[57:44] in the final days
[57:46] throughout all the ages not just the
[57:48] final days but just to to have a body
[57:52] that he has prepared
[57:54] to look at our own lives and think how
[57:57] many things that we go through in our
[57:58] lives how many struggles how many faults
[58:02] and how many failures and Satan comes
[58:04] around and reminds us of all of those so
[58:07] very often
[58:09] and sometimes other people do it as well
[58:12] some people can't help themselves
[58:15] but you know what we need to do we need
[58:17] to look at the mirror of God's word and
[58:18] realize that we are his choice he chose
[58:22] us we didn't choose him
[58:25] many times it can feel like we chose him
[58:29] and that's when we start to get into
[58:30] works and and basically I would say a
[58:34] nicolaitan spirit can creep into our
[58:36] lives and maybe feel begin to feel like
[58:39] there's something that we can do there's
[58:40] a Works based gospel and and even around
[58:43] the truth of our day and there's nothing
[58:46] that we could ever do there's nothing
[58:47] we've ever done
[58:49] except for be able to recognize our
[58:51] weakness to recognize that we have
[58:53] nothing good about us except for a
[58:55] hybrid condition
[58:58] but he has prepared a body
[59:01] in you and in I
[59:04] he prepared a body in Jesus Christ he
[59:07] prepared a body in Adam
[59:11] you know we talked about it I can't even
[59:13] remember when it was
[59:15] it's amazing how how quickly time goes
[59:18] and and how
[59:20] yeah it's just amazing how things go but
[59:22] uh you know we spoke recently about how
[59:25] God chose
[59:27] man
[59:28] many different ways he chose to express
[59:31] himself
[59:32] many different ways to the children of
[59:35] Israel as they were coming out of Egypt
[59:37] and and he displayed himself to
[59:40] Believers throughout all the ages in men
[59:44] that's how he chooses to display himself
[59:46] and and me myself just marveling at this
[59:50] thought that God has has chosen a body a
[59:54] body hast thou prepared me
[59:56] every single one of us brothers and
[59:58] sisters are his body that he has
[1:00:00] prepared that he chose to dwell himself
[1:00:03] in
[1:00:04] you know we say it many times when we
[1:00:06] get over to the other side how how we're
[1:00:08] gonna say Noah how'd you do it Joshua
[1:00:10] how did you do it Moses what was it like
[1:00:12] all of the Believers but they're going
[1:00:14] to say no what about you you're the one
[1:00:17] that he chose to express himself through
[1:00:20] laodicea in
[1:00:22] a body
[1:00:23] hath he chosen a body hast thou he hast
[1:00:28] thou prepared me
[1:00:33] we get to be his body here on Earth
[1:00:36] and I'm sorry brothers and sisters I I
[1:00:39] know some people
[1:00:41] some people get offended if we're not
[1:00:43] wearing a tie or whatever but
[1:00:46] it's hot
[1:00:48] I have to take and open the sleeve and
[1:00:52] this is pretty hot
[1:00:53] you know what it doesn't matter because
[1:00:55] we have the word
[1:00:57] we can have church
[1:00:59] we can worship Him
[1:01:01] we know brother Paul said there's
[1:01:02] probably going to be something
[1:01:03] significant about being on the other
[1:01:05] side in worship and we know that brother
[1:01:06] Branham said that this is the quietest
[1:01:08] place we're ever going to be
[1:01:10] he says it multiple times
[1:01:12] you know when we get that full
[1:01:14] realization when we get that full
[1:01:16] understanding of what it means to be
[1:01:18] redeemed
[1:01:20] all of the angels that actually stepped
[1:01:22] outside of their natural state those
[1:01:26] ones that followed Lucifer There's No
[1:01:29] Redemption for them
[1:01:31] there's some people that were created
[1:01:33] for Destruction human beings
[1:01:36] there's other people that have the
[1:01:38] potential to be saved Maybe by doing
[1:01:40] something or or or helping the children
[1:01:43] of God somewhere along the way
[1:01:45] but then there's another group of people
[1:01:47] that was elected to succeed they were
[1:01:50] elected to be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:01:52] to get to that place in our minds where
[1:01:55] we can recognize that consciously
[1:01:56] understand that brothers and sisters
[1:01:58] there ain't nothing that's going to hold
[1:02:00] us back from shouting for Joy because we
[1:02:03] know it was never our choice it was his
[1:02:05] choice all along
[1:02:08] it's just it just baffles the mind to
[1:02:11] think about that
[1:02:12] and and what it's like to to realize
[1:02:15] that you know what every single one of
[1:02:16] us outside of his grace our souls are
[1:02:19] hanging over Hell by a chain a breaking
[1:02:23] chain a rusty chain a chain that's
[1:02:25] probably not going to be able to stand
[1:02:26] up to the heat very long
[1:02:28] but to realize that he has chosen to
[1:02:30] save us and raise us up as his body not
[1:02:34] just as a son and daughter of God not
[1:02:36] just as a human being on Earth that can
[1:02:38] understand the scripture and say bless
[1:02:40] God I'm saved I believe the prophet for
[1:02:42] my day but to believe that we truly are
[1:02:45] adopted Sons and Daughters of God the
[1:02:47] one that he has chosen to make his voice
[1:02:52] the one that he has chosen to live out
[1:02:53] through to work through is just
[1:02:55] tremendous
[1:02:56] so tremendous it actually makes me want
[1:02:59] to get into gymnastics when I start
[1:03:00] thinking about that because I feel like
[1:03:02] doing somersaults or cartwheels or
[1:03:04] backflips and shouting while I do it
[1:03:09] because I know where I come from
[1:03:13] you know brother Emmanuel said it it
[1:03:14] hasn't left me
[1:03:16] our message is our testimony I know what
[1:03:19] God's done for me and you know maybe I
[1:03:22] can't quote the scripture is really good
[1:03:24] and I I can't quote the quotes really
[1:03:25] good but I can tell you what God has
[1:03:27] done for me and nobody can change that
[1:03:29] let me tell you I am a new creature in
[1:03:32] Christ Jesus I'm not who I want to be
[1:03:34] but I'm certainly not who I used to be
[1:03:37] goodness sakes oh my could introduce you
[1:03:41] to people that would say what what
[1:03:43] happened to this guy where did he go how
[1:03:45] how did this happen how could this
[1:03:47] possibly be
[1:03:49] out of last uh last Wednesday I read
[1:03:51] this quote and I just wanted to start
[1:03:52] out by reading this tonight and we
[1:03:54] haven't had a Time Warp tonight I'm
[1:03:56] thankful for that we've got a little bit
[1:03:58] of time
[1:03:59] um
[1:04:01] then unconsciously your faith is there
[1:04:04] brothers and sisters this is what I
[1:04:06] really want to try and encourage
[1:04:08] continually over and over and try and
[1:04:11] remind and try and just I guess
[1:04:13] encourages the best word that
[1:04:15] unconsciously your faith is there
[1:04:18] you don't have to worry about whether
[1:04:20] you've got faith enough to do this
[1:04:22] as Sons and Daughters of God when we're
[1:04:24] adopted Sons and Daughters of God this
[1:04:27] is speaking about adopted Sons and
[1:04:29] Daughters of God in 1955 even before the
[1:04:32] seals were opened he's he's a prophet
[1:04:34] prophesying about adopted Sons and
[1:04:37] Daughters of God the ones that truly are
[1:04:39] the body that's been prepared those
[1:04:42] people the ones that actually don't even
[1:04:44] have to try and drum anything up they
[1:04:46] don't have to worry when the winds are
[1:04:48] blowing and the ship is being tossed
[1:04:50] about like a bottle stopper where the
[1:04:52] disciples the ones with him get so upset
[1:04:54] because they think they're going to
[1:04:55] perish
[1:04:56] because they know that all the devils
[1:04:58] are surrounding them
[1:05:00] but they can just simply speak the word
[1:05:01] because they know that they're adopted
[1:05:03] they know that they've been given the
[1:05:04] checkbook and they've got the money in
[1:05:06] the bank to back that check when they
[1:05:08] write it
[1:05:09] unconsciously your faith is there you
[1:05:13] don't have to worry about whether you
[1:05:14] got faith enough to do this or faith
[1:05:16] enough to do that
[1:05:18] it's just there anyhow it's just there
[1:05:22] you just do it because the father said
[1:05:24] so
[1:05:27] and it's the Living Word in you
[1:05:31] and God's in you manifesting himself
[1:05:35] just like he was in Christ
[1:05:38] I just want to pause there and and say
[1:05:41] don't don't look at works
[1:05:44] don't say well where's Mark 16 in action
[1:05:46] I didn't raise anybody from the dead
[1:05:48] recently and uh you know I've got this
[1:05:50] problem financially and it just
[1:05:52] continually drags around with me and uh
[1:05:54] you know this other thing is going on
[1:05:56] and uh you know I I prayed about it and
[1:05:59] God hasn't moved and uh all these
[1:06:01] different things you know what that is
[1:06:02] that's Satan trying to get you worked up
[1:06:04] in the situation and distract you from
[1:06:07] what's really happening because what's
[1:06:08] really happening if you are a true son
[1:06:10] and daughter of God the true baptism of
[1:06:12] the holy spirit gives you the ability to
[1:06:14] say Amen to the word when it comes
[1:06:17] that's the true evidence of the Holy
[1:06:19] Spirit not because you've been able to
[1:06:21] live in an Apostolic age and act like
[1:06:23] one of the Apostles where you can you
[1:06:26] can raise the dead and and cast out
[1:06:28] demons and all of that stuff remember
[1:06:29] when the 70 came back to Jesus and they
[1:06:32] were so excited because they they've
[1:06:34] been out doing the major campaign going
[1:06:37] across the country and doing all those
[1:06:38] things those Great Mighty works of God
[1:06:41] and what did Jesus say to them don't
[1:06:42] Rejoice because you're doing that that
[1:06:44] doesn't matter Rejoice because your
[1:06:46] names are written in heaven that's why
[1:06:49] you need to rejoice and you know
[1:06:50] brothers and sisters if we don't have
[1:06:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our
[1:06:53] lives
[1:06:56] we actually potentially are receiving
[1:06:58] the mark of the beast
[1:07:01] and I don't mean to make it sound in
[1:07:03] such a way that I I paused as I said
[1:07:05] that because it almost sounds
[1:07:06] frightening I'm not trying to scare I'm
[1:07:08] just trying to say what's the truth
[1:07:11] if we reject the Holy Spirit we receive
[1:07:14] the mark of the beast
[1:07:15] that's what happens
[1:07:18] in our day we don't want to do that but
[1:07:19] just to look at this
[1:07:22] this quote here he was
[1:07:25] and and it's the Living Word in you and
[1:07:28] God's in you manifesting himself just
[1:07:30] like he was in Christ
[1:07:33] he says you say as he was in Christ yes
[1:07:36] sir
[1:07:38] he said the works that I do
[1:07:42] shall you also
[1:07:45] and it's interesting to to think about
[1:07:47] it because you know how in Matthew 4
[1:07:52] Matthew 4
[1:07:54] The Works that Jesus did
[1:07:57] he cast out Satan
[1:07:59] from his midst right
[1:08:02] the tempter came to him and said if thou
[1:08:04] be the Son of God command that these
[1:08:06] Stones be made bread
[1:08:08] show us a sign and we'll believe
[1:08:11] right what did Jesus do
[1:08:14] he used the word
[1:08:16] he used the word but he answered and
[1:08:18] said it's written man shall not live by
[1:08:19] bread alone
[1:08:21] but by every word
[1:08:23] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:08:26] and how does a man live on that word how
[1:08:28] does a man eat that word
[1:08:30] by hearing the word
[1:08:32] by reading the word
[1:08:34] by saying Amen to that word
[1:08:38] you know
[1:08:40] I I felt this I've we have all heard it
[1:08:43] said that when you say Amen it's it's
[1:08:45] like Sikkim to a dog when you say that
[1:08:48] when someone's preaching but I I I I
[1:08:50] just had this thought I don't know maybe
[1:08:52] somebody said it and I just can't
[1:08:53] remember who or or what or where but I
[1:08:56] just believe this too brothers and
[1:08:57] sisters when you say Amen what you do is
[1:09:00] you smack all of the Demons around you
[1:09:02] that are tempting you trying to torment
[1:09:04] you all of them get a punch in the face
[1:09:06] every one of them when you say Amen to
[1:09:09] the word
[1:09:11] it does something
[1:09:13] it doesn't just go idle when you say
[1:09:15] Amen to the word and you don't have to
[1:09:17] shout it or or scream it or jump up and
[1:09:20] and run to the front of the church and
[1:09:22] and act like that it's not like that
[1:09:24] when there's something in your heart
[1:09:26] that says Amen to the word be it unto me
[1:09:28] according to Thy word that's what Jesus
[1:09:31] is looking for that's the works that
[1:09:32] brother Branham is talking about here
[1:09:36] you know Jesus saith unto him it's it's
[1:09:38] written again Thou shalt not tempt the
[1:09:39] Lord thy God then Jesus said unto him
[1:09:42] get thee and Satan for it's written Thou
[1:09:44] shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him
[1:09:47] only shalt thou serve all of those are
[1:09:50] scriptures
[1:09:51] that were written before the word using
[1:09:54] the word
[1:09:55] same thing for us today brothers and
[1:09:57] sisters we the body that's been prepared
[1:10:01] by the word
[1:10:03] using the word
[1:10:06] he says it's the Living Word in you
[1:10:10] not the Living Word in me the prophet
[1:10:13] not the Living Word in your pastor
[1:10:16] not the Living Word in a in a deacon or
[1:10:18] a trustee or an evangelist or an apostle
[1:10:21] or a teacher
[1:10:24] not the Living Word in them it's the
[1:10:26] Living Word in you
[1:10:28] and God's in you
[1:10:30] manifesting himself just like he was in
[1:10:33] Christ
[1:10:36] the ability to speak the word the
[1:10:39] ability to receive the word
[1:10:41] that's all
[1:10:43] not Mighty works not not wonders
[1:10:47] you say as he was in Christ yes sir he
[1:10:51] said the works that I do
[1:10:53] shall you also
[1:10:55] even more than this for I go to my
[1:10:58] father
[1:10:59] now that's his word Saint John 14 12 he
[1:11:02] gave the promise everyone will believe
[1:11:06] that was inspired
[1:11:08] and so a little while the world see me
[1:11:10] no more yet you shall see me
[1:11:13] for I'll be with you until the end of
[1:11:15] the age of the Apostles
[1:11:19] no I'll be with you
[1:11:22] even in you
[1:11:24] to the end of the world
[1:11:27] and he says Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ is
[1:11:30] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:11:33] to think that that's that's who we're
[1:11:35] looking for
[1:11:36] I believe that through the through the
[1:11:39] mighty signs the the polls that we've
[1:11:42] seen in the in the life of the prophet
[1:11:44] has almost set something in Motion in in
[1:11:48] the message to create an idea that
[1:11:51] unless we see the mighty works that the
[1:11:54] prophet was doing in his life
[1:11:56] actively working in our lives that maybe
[1:11:58] we just aren't quite there we just
[1:12:00] haven't achieved it yet we might not
[1:12:02] have actually been fully adopted yet
[1:12:05] brothers and sisters the evidence of the
[1:12:06] Holy Ghost in our lives he said it the
[1:12:08] prophet said it I'm not going to read
[1:12:10] the quote I'll say look it up
[1:12:13] he said the true evidence of the Holy
[1:12:15] Spirit In Our Lives is the ability to
[1:12:17] receive the word
[1:12:19] the ability to receive the word not say
[1:12:21] that I've I've I've I've seen all these
[1:12:24] Mighty Works in my life I don't even
[1:12:25] know why I'm talking like this tonight
[1:12:27] it's so bizarre it's completely off the
[1:12:29] notes
[1:12:30] but hey
[1:12:31] a body has he prepared and you know
[1:12:33] brothers and sisters that body is you
[1:12:36] and I I've said it and I'll just keep
[1:12:37] saying it tonight it's you it's I it's
[1:12:40] everyone that receives the word in our
[1:12:42] day and to receive the word in our day
[1:12:44] we don't just receive the word according
[1:12:46] to a Catholic and and receives the word
[1:12:49] according to a denominational Church a
[1:12:51] Pentecostal or a Baptist or a Methodist
[1:12:54] we don't do that
[1:12:56] you can't receive the word according to
[1:12:58] that
[1:12:59] because what's Jesus going to judge the
[1:13:01] World by when he comes back a church and
[1:13:03] if it is which one isn't there 44 000
[1:13:07] different denominations of Christian
[1:13:09] churches in the world today
[1:13:11] it's it's very close to that forty four
[1:13:13] thousand so which one of those is he
[1:13:14] going to judge the World by we know that
[1:13:17] brother Branham says that's not what
[1:13:18] he's going to judge the World by he's
[1:13:19] going to judge the World by Christ which
[1:13:21] is the word and you know what if we have
[1:13:24] the word in us we have Christ in US
[1:13:28] and at that point brothers and sisters
[1:13:30] we become that body that's been prepared
[1:13:34] we become that body and you know the
[1:13:37] beautiful part is and that's what I was
[1:13:38] saying when it gets into adoption when
[1:13:40] we come to that place of realization of
[1:13:42] adoption being fully adopted in our Our
[1:13:45] Lives to be fully adopted Sons and
[1:13:47] Daughters of God we realize that that
[1:13:49] body he has prepared
[1:13:51] we haven't prepared it but when we
[1:13:53] recognize that we are the dwelling place
[1:13:55] of the most high the temple built
[1:13:57] without hands my goodness then we want
[1:14:00] to do things to sanctify it to to
[1:14:03] actually fortify it to actually prepare
[1:14:06] it so that he will actually manifest in
[1:14:08] it and through it you know we can look
[1:14:11] at the church building and we have the
[1:14:12] springtime cleanups and imagine if we
[1:14:15] did that in our lives where we just had
[1:14:17] one time a year where we just tidied up
[1:14:19] our lives and and made it good but you
[1:14:21] know as a Christian we do it every
[1:14:24] single day not just once a week not just
[1:14:27] twice a week or or once or twice a month
[1:14:29] or even once every six months or once a
[1:14:31] year we would be dead if we did that we
[1:14:34] have to feed on the word every single
[1:14:37] day of Our Lives
[1:14:39] we have to make sure that that body is
[1:14:41] looked after
[1:14:43] and not not not by the way cardinality
[1:14:46] would look at it how how we can go and
[1:14:48] lift weights and exercise and and eat so
[1:14:51] good and eat all the the vitamins and
[1:14:53] the minerals and I'm so thankful that we
[1:14:55] had a pastor that would just say you
[1:14:57] know what we need to have that kind of
[1:14:58] Faith the faith that we're talking about
[1:14:59] right here that we could go and eat at
[1:15:01] McDonald's one of the junkiest places
[1:15:03] that that would ever produce food on the
[1:15:05] open market and ask the Lord to bless it
[1:15:07] and be able to get all of the nutrients
[1:15:09] that we would get out of that meal if we
[1:15:12] needed it
[1:15:13] because the Lord blessed our food
[1:15:16] when we spoke it wasn't us speaking it
[1:15:20] was him speaking that's why it's so
[1:15:22] important to be able to pray
[1:15:25] out of the Statue of a perfect man
[1:15:27] now this is where we start to get good
[1:15:29] but the statue of a perfect man now God
[1:15:31] or the Bible said here that Stephen
[1:15:34] spoke of Solomon building a temple and
[1:15:37] the most high don't dwell in temples
[1:15:39] made with hands for Heavens my Throne
[1:15:41] Earth is my footstool and where is the
[1:15:43] place of my rest
[1:15:46] isn't this beautiful
[1:15:48] but a body hast thou prepared me Brother
[1:15:51] Brad I'm speaking here he says amen
[1:15:53] there you are amen there you are a body
[1:15:56] hast thou prepared me God dwells in the
[1:16:00] Statue of a man
[1:16:04] and I'll say
[1:16:06] and a woman
[1:16:10] reflecting himself into that being
[1:16:15] perfect worship
[1:16:18] thinking about worship talking about
[1:16:20] worship tonight perfect worship
[1:16:23] it's not just singing songs
[1:16:26] perfect worship is in perfect harmony
[1:16:30] with one another
[1:16:32] giving him the ability to reflect
[1:16:34] himself through us
[1:16:36] reflecting himself into that being he
[1:16:38] says perfect worship God in us
[1:16:43] being his Tabernacle
[1:16:45] God manifesting
[1:16:48] oh how we could stay on that
[1:16:52] see it almost suffocate in here from
[1:16:55] Heat
[1:16:57] I didn't actually yeah that's
[1:17:00] interesting I didn't put this together
[1:17:01] like this because of the Heat
[1:17:04] oh my
[1:17:05] thinking about this though the body hast
[1:17:08] thou prepared me
[1:17:10] and there you are
[1:17:12] it's interesting to look at it and
[1:17:14] realize that
[1:17:16] we are his choice
[1:17:19] even if we
[1:17:21] don't want to be
[1:17:24] we still are his choice
[1:17:28] remember the story brother Brown told
[1:17:30] about that minister
[1:17:32] that Minister he decided he was done
[1:17:34] with it he just threw in the towel he's
[1:17:36] going to go and get a case of beer he
[1:17:38] drove a crowd drove across town went and
[1:17:40] got the box of beer
[1:17:42] I was going to go and drink it
[1:17:44] and God took him home
[1:17:47] God didn't let him go through with it
[1:17:49] brother Branham said for a purpose
[1:17:50] because he is one of his own he wouldn't
[1:17:53] let him go too far
[1:17:55] many times we we have our own will but
[1:17:58] God's will be done
[1:18:01] God's will will always be done
[1:18:05] going on in the Statue of a perfect man
[1:18:07] talking about this body talking about
[1:18:09] God's choice of a place to dwell
[1:18:13] now that is the house God dwells in not
[1:18:17] a building with a big Bell on top of it
[1:18:19] and a high steeple sea
[1:18:21] but a body hast thou prepared me a body
[1:18:25] that God can dwell in
[1:18:28] I just love how it brings he brings this
[1:18:31] down really close to home he makes it so
[1:18:34] we can understand it he makes it so that
[1:18:36] we can comprehend it we can understand
[1:18:38] it it's not out there and and nebulous
[1:18:41] and and and and nicolaitan it's about
[1:18:44] every single one of us having the
[1:18:46] ability to recognize that we're that
[1:18:47] body he says a body thou Hast prepared
[1:18:50] me a body that God can dwell in God can
[1:18:53] walk in God can see in God can talk in
[1:18:58] God can work in
[1:19:01] amen
[1:19:04] living
[1:19:05] instrumentally of God
[1:19:10] so I was I was interested in this and I
[1:19:12] looked up the word instrumentally and
[1:19:15] and it basically just goes back to
[1:19:17] instrument but to look at it from that
[1:19:19] perspective to think that really that's
[1:19:21] what we are
[1:19:23] an instrument
[1:19:26] we're the instrument and God is the
[1:19:28] musician
[1:19:29] the Holy Spirit living out through US
[1:19:31] reflecting himself through Us in how we
[1:19:35] walk
[1:19:36] in how we talk
[1:19:38] being a place that he can dwell in
[1:19:40] working through
[1:19:42] living instrumentally of God when he
[1:19:45] says go we go when he says come we come
[1:19:47] when he says stop we stop
[1:19:50] we don't live our lives according to our
[1:19:51] own will brother Bradham says it we've
[1:19:54] all heard it a a
[1:19:57] a Christian life
[1:19:59] eternal life is not living for ourselves
[1:20:01] not living according to our own will
[1:20:04] but living for others
[1:20:08] he goes on to say living instrumentally
[1:20:11] for God God walking on two feet
[1:20:16] in you
[1:20:19] God walking in two feet in you
[1:20:24] for ye are written Epistles red of all
[1:20:26] men
[1:20:27] and the life that's in Christ
[1:20:30] and if the life that's in Christ be in
[1:20:32] you
[1:20:33] you'll bear the life that Christ bore
[1:20:38] how often did he get upset
[1:20:41] how often did he get fussed at
[1:20:43] situations
[1:20:44] how often did he argue
[1:20:47] how often did he have contention with
[1:20:49] people
[1:20:51] did he poke at people
[1:20:53] the only ones that he really did were
[1:20:55] the ones that acted to be the most
[1:20:57] religious
[1:20:59] really right
[1:21:00] it was the people that were the most
[1:21:02] undesirable were the ones that he was
[1:21:04] interested in
[1:21:06] the ones that had the ability to receive
[1:21:08] the word
[1:21:10] I just love how he says it though the
[1:21:12] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:21:14] of God God walking in you for ye are
[1:21:18] written Epistles red of all men and if
[1:21:20] the life
[1:21:21] that's in Christ being you you'll bear
[1:21:24] the life Christ bore
[1:21:26] but brothers and sisters I just want to
[1:21:28] underline that tonight don't look for
[1:21:30] signs and wonders to say that that's the
[1:21:32] life that Christ bore look for the
[1:21:35] stature of the perfect man
[1:21:37] and what's the top of that
[1:21:39] is charity is love
[1:21:41] because God is love
[1:21:43] but you know what there's all of the
[1:21:46] parts below that and all of them
[1:21:49] add up to it
[1:21:51] all of the virtues that we need to see
[1:21:54] in our life
[1:21:57] it's not about signs and wonders it's
[1:21:59] not about having a great healing
[1:22:01] campaign or even a Revival we know the
[1:22:03] Revival is over this this ministry that
[1:22:06] we're dealing with that we're living
[1:22:07] walking and talking about is is a
[1:22:10] Ministry to the total lost
[1:22:12] it's interesting because when brother
[1:22:14] Bradham Drew out the uh the the seven
[1:22:18] Church ages remember he drew it out on
[1:22:20] the Blackboard
[1:22:22] he drew it with a little bit of light
[1:22:23] just a teeny little sliver of light is
[1:22:26] what he said in the laodicean age he
[1:22:28] said the Holy Ghost came along and
[1:22:30] actually drew that one
[1:22:32] Vindicated what he drew but drew the
[1:22:34] last one with no light
[1:22:36] imagine that the prophet on Earth
[1:22:39] throwing himself in the breach showing
[1:22:41] just a little teeny sliver of light
[1:22:44] meaning that there was just a group of
[1:22:46] people a tiny little group of people the
[1:22:48] ones that God has chosen to be his body
[1:22:51] walking on Earth again
[1:22:53] you know the the temple the original
[1:22:55] Temple that was given in the
[1:22:57] instructions to Moses just one part of
[1:23:00] that I want to talk about tonight and
[1:23:01] that's that's God gave him the
[1:23:03] instructions to to build the temple we
[1:23:05] know they're very ex very very explicit
[1:23:08] very very very detailed instructions on
[1:23:12] how to build it the size to build it the
[1:23:14] materials to use the people to gather
[1:23:16] all of the things to build this Temple
[1:23:19] but one of the components that he chose
[1:23:21] was a badger skin I think we've all
[1:23:24] heard it said many times in the past
[1:23:25] that it's no accident that he chose to
[1:23:27] use a badger skin and one of the reasons
[1:23:29] is because it's a very very strong skin
[1:23:32] very strong and I can only imagine there
[1:23:34] was a lot of badgers around in the day
[1:23:36] it was probably a relatively easy
[1:23:38] creature to get their hands on
[1:23:40] it wasn't a very nice one though it
[1:23:43] wasn't a very nice creature the badger
[1:23:45] the European Badger or the honey badger
[1:23:47] the one that was likely the one that was
[1:23:49] over there which still is is a very mean
[1:23:53] Creature if you try and Corner that
[1:23:54] thing it has a temper on it
[1:23:58] many people will not even approach them
[1:24:00] but uh you know it's no accident that
[1:24:02] God chose that to be what he made his
[1:24:05] Temple out of
[1:24:07] to think about how that actually can
[1:24:09] compare to the human being in in
[1:24:12] attitude sometimes people if they get
[1:24:15] cornered in situations they don't like
[1:24:18] even if they're wrong they still will
[1:24:21] actually turn mean and and and maybe not
[1:24:24] act just like a Christian ought to
[1:24:27] but it doesn't change what's on the
[1:24:29] inside of them it's the outside it's the
[1:24:32] badger skin it's that genetic makeup
[1:24:34] that we all deal with that code from the
[1:24:37] hybrid creature that we are
[1:24:40] that genetic code that we deal with but
[1:24:43] it doesn't change what's on the inside
[1:24:46] tonight what we're talking about is
[1:24:47] what's on the inside a body hast thou
[1:24:50] prepared me we have been made to be
[1:24:53] bodies walking around here we've been
[1:24:55] made to be bodies that come together as
[1:24:57] the many membered body
[1:24:59] for his Spirit to be in one mind in one
[1:25:02] Accord
[1:25:04] but you know I just can't help but think
[1:25:06] that this little animal was a bit of a a
[1:25:08] bit of a reflection
[1:25:10] of the human nature the nature that can
[1:25:14] be in humans
[1:25:15] very very tough
[1:25:17] and very very alley
[1:25:22] but you know
[1:25:24] that's God's choice
[1:25:26] I can look at myself outside of a new
[1:25:29] birth
[1:25:29] and say that I probably was that way
[1:25:32] not probably I was that way
[1:25:35] just a little stinky badger
[1:25:38] something with a snarly attitude and uh
[1:25:41] probably not good for much
[1:25:45] but that's human beings in general
[1:25:48] when we get the new birth
[1:25:50] we become the new creature in Christ
[1:25:52] Jesus like we've said
[1:25:54] you know it's uh it's interesting to see
[1:25:57] God's choice and it can be real easy to
[1:26:00] stumble at the Veil
[1:26:01] and many times
[1:26:04] I know I've been guilty of it to look at
[1:26:06] people and think could that really be
[1:26:08] how could that possibly be
[1:26:10] but we don't ever want to be judging
[1:26:11] anyone
[1:26:13] by their skin
[1:26:15] we don't ever want to judge a book by
[1:26:16] its cover because we don't know about
[1:26:18] the story that's inside that book
[1:26:21] and every single human being has a story
[1:26:24] that they have had to write that's our
[1:26:27] lives we don't have a choice about that
[1:26:29] but to think about how God when we can
[1:26:32] look back on our lives and see how God
[1:26:34] has allowed us to come certain ways it
[1:26:37] it it's it's so humbling to look at it
[1:26:41] let's turn over to First Corinthians
[1:26:45] First Corinthians
[1:26:47] chapter 15.
[1:26:50] I'm just going to read a little
[1:26:51] scripture here tonight to just
[1:26:54] talk about sort of the contrast about
[1:26:56] this body
[1:26:59] and how how we can actually see it and I
[1:27:03] think it's neat to to see how the word
[1:27:05] identifies the natural sometimes we can
[1:27:08] read about the spiritual and talk about
[1:27:10] the spiritual and and it just becomes
[1:27:12] all spiritual but
[1:27:14] God did it in such a way that we could
[1:27:16] actually it shows us that he's conscious
[1:27:19] of the natural as well by the way this
[1:27:21] is written let's start reading with
[1:27:22] verse 35 in First Corinthians chapter
[1:27:25] 15.
[1:27:29] but some man will say how are the dead
[1:27:30] raised up
[1:27:32] and with what body do they come
[1:27:36] thou fool
[1:27:38] that which thou sowest is not quickened
[1:27:40] except it die
[1:27:42] what Paul is talking about here is about
[1:27:45] having the new birth
[1:27:47] when you put a seed in the ground the
[1:27:49] only way that seed is actually going to
[1:27:51] come to life is if it completely dies
[1:27:53] and rots away and he's talking about the
[1:27:55] new birth and he's upgrading the
[1:27:57] Corinthians here just before this and I
[1:27:59] didn't really want to get into that but
[1:28:00] I just want to explain that part of it
[1:28:02] as we go into the rest of it here thou
[1:28:05] fool that which thou sowest is not
[1:28:07] quickened except it die you have to have
[1:28:08] a new birth
[1:28:10] and that which thou sowest thou sowest
[1:28:13] not that body that shall be but bear
[1:28:17] grain
[1:28:18] it may chance of wheat or some other
[1:28:22] grain
[1:28:24] but God giveth it a body as it hath
[1:28:27] pleased him and to every seed his own
[1:28:30] body
[1:28:33] All Flesh is not the same flesh but
[1:28:36] there is one kind of Flesh
[1:28:40] of men another flesh of beasts another
[1:28:43] of fishes and another of birds
[1:28:47] there are also celestial bodies and
[1:28:49] bodies terrestrial
[1:28:51] but the glory of the celestial is one
[1:28:53] and the glory of the terrestrial is
[1:28:55] another
[1:28:57] there is one glory of the Sun
[1:29:00] and another glory of the Moon
[1:29:02] and another glory of the Stars
[1:29:05] for one star diareth from another star
[1:29:08] in glory
[1:29:09] think about how many stars are there out
[1:29:12] there
[1:29:14] verse 42 so also is the resurrection of
[1:29:17] the Dead
[1:29:19] it is sown in corruption
[1:29:22] it is raised in incorruption
[1:29:25] it is sown in dishonor
[1:29:28] it is raised in glory
[1:29:30] it is sown in weakness
[1:29:33] it is raised in power
[1:29:36] it is sown a natural body
[1:29:39] it is raised a spiritual body
[1:29:43] there is a natural body and there is a
[1:29:46] spiritual body
[1:29:47] and so it is written the first man Adam
[1:29:50] was made a living soul
[1:29:53] the last Adam
[1:29:55] was made a quickening spirit
[1:30:00] how be it that was not the first which
[1:30:03] is spiritual but that which is natural
[1:30:06] and afterward that which is spiritual
[1:30:10] the first man is of the Earth
[1:30:14] earthy
[1:30:15] the second man
[1:30:17] is the Lord From Heaven
[1:30:20] as is the earthy such are they also that
[1:30:23] are earthy and as is the Heavenly such
[1:30:26] are they also that are heavenly and as
[1:30:30] we have borne the image of the Earthly
[1:30:32] we shall also bear the image of the
[1:30:35] heavenly
[1:30:37] when we receive the Holy Spirit In Our
[1:30:39] Lives brothers and sisters becoming a
[1:30:42] new creature in Christ Jesus the word
[1:30:44] itself begins to reflect out of us
[1:30:48] we're not rejoicing because we're having
[1:30:50] great healing campaigns and because we
[1:30:52] cast out devils and raise the dead and
[1:30:54] heal the sick and and the blind sea and
[1:30:57] all of that we're not looking for that
[1:30:58] we're looking for the one thing the one
[1:31:01] true evidence of the Holy Spirit In Our
[1:31:03] Lives to show that the Lord is in US
[1:31:08] verse 47 the first man is of the earth
[1:31:11] Earthly the second man
[1:31:13] that's the one we're talking about
[1:31:15] tonight the second man
[1:31:17] is what
[1:31:19] is the Lord From Heaven
[1:31:22] and where is the Lord From Heaven
[1:31:24] tonight
[1:31:26] where is he tonight brothers and sisters
[1:31:30] verse 48 as is the Earthly such are they
[1:31:32] also that are earthy and ah and as is
[1:31:37] the Heavenly such are they also that are
[1:31:39] heavenly
[1:31:40] you know I just can't help but say just
[1:31:43] let's flip over to Romans chapter 8 just
[1:31:45] for fun we still have a few minutes
[1:31:47] tonight we haven't run out of time
[1:31:51] it doesn't get any finer than this
[1:31:55] Romans chapter 8.
[1:31:59] verse 1.
[1:32:05] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:32:07] to them which are in Christ Jesus
[1:32:12] but I would say there is therefore now
[1:32:14] no condemnation to them which have
[1:32:17] Christ Jesus in them
[1:32:21] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:32:23] the spirit
[1:32:24] we're not we're walking after the fleshy
[1:32:27] things in this world
[1:32:29] we are the body that he has chosen
[1:32:32] in verse 2 for the law of the spirit of
[1:32:34] life in Christ Jesus hath made me free
[1:32:37] from the law of sin and death
[1:32:40] for what the law could not do and that
[1:32:42] it was weak through the flesh
[1:32:45] the blood of bulls and goats God sending
[1:32:48] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[1:32:50] flesh and for sin condemned sin in the
[1:32:53] flesh that the righteousness of the law
[1:32:56] might be fulfilled in who
[1:32:58] in us who walk not after the flesh but
[1:33:02] after the spirit for they that are after
[1:33:04] The Flesh do mind the things of the
[1:33:06] flesh but they that are after the spirit
[1:33:07] the things of the spirit for to be
[1:33:10] carnally minded is death
[1:33:13] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:33:15] peace
[1:33:17] rest
[1:33:19] that Eighth Day
[1:33:21] the understanding that he's got it all
[1:33:22] under control we don't understand many
[1:33:24] things that happen in our lives
[1:33:27] but we know that he's got it all under
[1:33:28] control and we know that everything that
[1:33:30] happens to us is for a purpose it's so
[1:33:32] that he can work out his glory through
[1:33:34] our lives
[1:33:38] verse 7 because the carnal mind is
[1:33:41] enmity against God
[1:33:44] for it is not subject to the law of God
[1:33:46] neither indeed can be
[1:33:50] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:33:52] cannot please God
[1:33:55] we don't want to be in the flesh
[1:33:56] brothers and sisters
[1:33:58] says right here that we can't please God
[1:34:00] when we're in the flesh
[1:34:02] and you know really it can be easy to to
[1:34:04] just look at it and say maybe I'm
[1:34:06] getting fleshy by saying such and such
[1:34:08] about someone or whatever whatever but I
[1:34:10] don't think that that's really what the
[1:34:11] the true meaning to the laodicean age
[1:34:13] about this is brothers and sisters to
[1:34:15] get in the flesh is to deny the word of
[1:34:17] God to deny one portion of the word of
[1:34:20] God Eve denied one word in the Garden of
[1:34:23] Eden for us to deny one word today for
[1:34:26] us to interpret the message of the
[1:34:28] Prophet the Vindicated Prophet for our
[1:34:30] day for us to interpret it and say well
[1:34:31] I know he said it that way but I can do
[1:34:33] it this way we can just do most of it
[1:34:35] but we'll just do a little bit of
[1:34:37] whatever if we try and do that brothers
[1:34:39] and sisters that's what he's talking
[1:34:40] about here that's the message for us in
[1:34:42] our day the carnal mind is enmity
[1:34:45] against God science is going to be
[1:34:48] esteemed higher than the word of God in
[1:34:51] my life I'm going to say what a doctor
[1:34:53] says before I take the word of God
[1:34:56] brothers and sisters that's being
[1:34:57] carnally minded we don't want to be
[1:34:59] carnally minded we need to speak the
[1:35:01] word of God we need to cast out devils
[1:35:04] in the name of Jesus Christ they might
[1:35:06] not move just because we say it but you
[1:35:08] know what they have to go there comes a
[1:35:10] point in time where they have to go
[1:35:13] the carnal mind is enmity against God
[1:35:18] and you know what we might have a
[1:35:19] situation in our life that unfolds
[1:35:21] in such a way that it's just
[1:35:23] contrary to the way we think that it
[1:35:25] should because the devil should go
[1:35:28] but God will allow things to happen in
[1:35:30] ways that he allows things to happen and
[1:35:32] we can't question that
[1:35:35] we can only
[1:35:36] go on and say you know what my testimony
[1:35:40] is stronger than the situation
[1:35:42] and and that's the way it is
[1:35:46] but to be carnally minded is enmity
[1:35:48] against God
[1:35:50] for it is not subjects of the law of God
[1:35:52] neither indeed can be so then they that
[1:35:55] are in the flesh cannot please God
[1:35:58] I just love this verse 9 but ye are not
[1:36:01] in the flesh
[1:36:02] but in the spirit
[1:36:04] if so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[1:36:07] you now if any man have not the spirit
[1:36:10] of Christ he is none of his and if
[1:36:12] Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:36:14] because of sin
[1:36:17] but the spirit is life because of
[1:36:20] righteousness
[1:36:22] and verse 11 but if the spirit of him
[1:36:24] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:36:26] in you
[1:36:28] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:36:30] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:36:33] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:36:37] and what does he mean by Quicken your
[1:36:38] mortal bodies
[1:36:41] he means that you'll have eternal life
[1:36:44] will be quickened to the word
[1:36:47] firstly
[1:36:49] and that's where we begin to walk after
[1:36:50] the spirit where the carnal man dies
[1:36:53] and we begin to have a testimony that
[1:36:56] we're a new creature in Christ Jesus and
[1:36:58] then the battle starts
[1:37:01] when we get saved when you get the Holy
[1:37:03] Ghost in your life it's not a flowery
[1:37:05] bed of ease It's Not Easy Street that's
[1:37:07] when the battle starts
[1:37:10] that's when the Devils come around and
[1:37:12] start to tempt and try
[1:37:15] but you know what when we actually
[1:37:17] aren't carnally minded when that spirit
[1:37:19] that raised up Jesus from the dead is
[1:37:22] dwelling in US it quickens our mortal
[1:37:25] bodies to the word because we know
[1:37:28] that will never die
[1:37:30] it doesn't matter what comes our way
[1:37:32] doesn't matter if God chooses to take us
[1:37:35] home
[1:37:36] doesn't matter whatever happens is for
[1:37:39] our good
[1:37:41] because the spirit of him
[1:37:43] lives out through us
[1:37:45] in the unveiling of God brother Branham
[1:37:47] says behind the old temple in the Veil
[1:37:50] what was back behind there
[1:37:53] what was Jehovah what was hit back there
[1:37:57] what was the veil hiding oh hallelujah
[1:38:00] what was the veil hiding
[1:38:03] it was hiding the word
[1:38:06] he doesn't say it was hiding the pillar
[1:38:07] of fire he doesn't say it was hiding the
[1:38:09] Shekinah Glory doesn't say you mean he
[1:38:11] does after I think but he doesn't say
[1:38:13] that it was hiding anything else he just
[1:38:16] says it was hiding the word
[1:38:17] Thy word have I hid in my heart that I
[1:38:20] might not sin against thee Thy word is a
[1:38:23] light a lamp unto my feet and a light
[1:38:26] unto my path it's it's the word brothers
[1:38:28] and sisters it's the only thing that can
[1:38:30] save us
[1:38:32] he says what was hit back there what was
[1:38:34] the veil hiding oh hallelujah what was
[1:38:36] the veil hiding it was hiding the word
[1:38:38] the veil all Badger skins was hiding the
[1:38:42] word to their eyes natural
[1:38:45] behind there also was the show bread see
[1:38:49] the bread of life
[1:38:50] that we've been talking about
[1:38:53] it was the showbread see behind there
[1:38:55] also
[1:38:56] was the Shekinah Glory
[1:39:00] but it was hid from all of them it was
[1:39:02] all hid
[1:39:03] all the glory of God was right behind
[1:39:06] that old Badger skin
[1:39:08] that's right
[1:39:10] all the fullness of God
[1:39:13] dwelling
[1:39:15] in a son and a daughter
[1:39:19] all right I just want to read that
[1:39:20] scripture now I just have to
[1:39:22] bear with me for a second
[1:39:25] I just
[1:39:26] it's stuck with me
[1:39:29] and I just can't get rid of it brothers
[1:39:31] and sisters if you turn over to
[1:39:32] Ephesians chapter 3.
[1:39:35] talking about what brother Branham is
[1:39:37] saying here the glory of God was right
[1:39:39] behind that old Badger skin that's right
[1:39:42] I'll head to the Natural Eye it is today
[1:39:44] too he says
[1:39:46] it is today too
[1:39:50] all the glory of God was right behind
[1:39:53] that old Badger skin
[1:39:55] and it is today too in Ephesians chapter
[1:39:58] 3 verse 16.
[1:40:01] that he would Grant you
[1:40:03] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:40:05] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:40:08] in the Inner Man right that Christ May
[1:40:10] dwell in your hearts by faith that ye
[1:40:12] being rooted and grounded in love
[1:40:16] may be able to comprehend with all the
[1:40:18] saints what is the breadth and length
[1:40:20] and depth and height you might be able
[1:40:21] to understand it we would have the
[1:40:23] comprehension of what this means to have
[1:40:25] God living in US verse 19 is the is sort
[1:40:28] of the the punch line and to know the
[1:40:30] love of Christ which passeth knowledge
[1:40:33] that ye might be filled with all the
[1:40:37] fullness of God not just abortion not
[1:40:40] just a little bit
[1:40:42] not just a a tiny little sprinkle of it
[1:40:45] but all the fullness of God right there
[1:40:48] behind the badger skin brothers and
[1:40:50] sisters huh
[1:40:52] can you imagine that if we could look at
[1:40:54] each other and realize yeah look at that
[1:40:56] old Badger over there remember
[1:40:59] all the glory of God potentially dwells
[1:41:02] right there behind that Badger skin
[1:41:05] I just believe this could help maybe the
[1:41:08] way we deal with one another maybe the
[1:41:11] way we deal with our children maybe the
[1:41:13] way we deal with our parents maybe the
[1:41:15] way we deal with our spouses maybe the
[1:41:17] way we deal with our deacons I don't
[1:41:19] know
[1:41:20] but if we look at one another in a
[1:41:22] different way that you know what
[1:41:23] potentially all of the glory of God is
[1:41:27] right behind that Badger skin
[1:41:30] that's God's choice
[1:41:32] all the glory of God was right behind
[1:41:34] that old Badger skin that's right he
[1:41:36] says I'll head to the Natural Eye it is
[1:41:38] today too it's called a bunch of Holy
[1:41:41] Rollers fanatics but they don't know
[1:41:43] what's hid behind
[1:41:45] he says that's right they don't know see
[1:41:49] then when God in Mercy rent The Veil for
[1:41:54] them to see
[1:41:58] because he did
[1:42:01] right when Jesus was on the cross it was
[1:42:03] the very first place that he went to
[1:42:04] when he gave up the ghost isn't it he
[1:42:06] went right into the temple
[1:42:07] right to the temple
[1:42:09] to rent the veil for them to see
[1:42:13] he says they were so wrapped up in their
[1:42:15] traditions
[1:42:17] that it was still hit to them even to
[1:42:19] this day same now he says
[1:42:22] out of the unveiling of God
[1:42:26] the glory the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:28] the Shekinah Glory that comes upon the
[1:42:31] believer now I mean the real believer he
[1:42:33] says in Brackets that causes the works
[1:42:36] of God and the faith to come into him to
[1:42:39] believe the word of God that's all hid
[1:42:41] to them eyes they say them things are
[1:42:43] past you see they're still living behind
[1:42:46] the veil
[1:42:48] you're not behind that Veil anymore
[1:42:49] little ones God's come into full view of
[1:42:53] you
[1:42:57] it's just glorious this this just
[1:42:59] I don't know just excites me
[1:43:02] it's going to read a little more here
[1:43:04] as we come to the end
[1:43:07] out of the unveiling of God
[1:43:09] he says the Shekinah Glory manifests him
[1:43:12] it brings forth the Word of Promise
[1:43:14] right out
[1:43:16] to you
[1:43:19] that's the reason that he had to Veil
[1:43:20] Moses face because in him was the word
[1:43:23] he veiled Jesus
[1:43:26] as a humble little man
[1:43:29] to keep them from seeing Jehovah
[1:43:32] like we've talked about how he would
[1:43:34] Veil himself in a human being and come
[1:43:37] and express himself to the world a body
[1:43:40] hast thou prepared me he it just I don't
[1:43:44] even know if I'm expressing this right
[1:43:45] even but it's just short circuits my
[1:43:48] brain
[1:43:49] to think
[1:43:51] how much of a condescension it must have
[1:43:54] been for God to manifest himself in a
[1:43:56] human being I think I'm saying that
[1:43:57] right it just I can't even really get my
[1:44:01] head wrapped around that I don't know if
[1:44:02] it's just me or not but
[1:44:04] like we just we're humans and and you
[1:44:06] know how I guess we have to look at it
[1:44:08] that way you know when brother Bradham
[1:44:09] was talking to his friend there and his
[1:44:11] I think it was Charlie Cox saying you
[1:44:13] know whether it be hunting in Heaven Can
[1:44:14] Can we hunt squirrels in heaven and
[1:44:15] brother Branham compares the hog nature
[1:44:18] and you know would you ever want to go
[1:44:19] back to being a hog if you ever became a
[1:44:21] human being and no we certainly wouldn't
[1:44:23] and I guess it's it's like that I guess
[1:44:26] I'm just babbling now but it's just
[1:44:28] bizarre to think that
[1:44:30] how far did he condescend to trick Satan
[1:44:35] it's so amazing and brothers and sisters
[1:44:37] it has to be the same thing today he's
[1:44:39] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:44:41] and forever a body he has prepared today
[1:44:44] brothers and sisters and we're talking
[1:44:46] to it right now those people who receive
[1:44:49] the word
[1:44:50] those people who receive a prophet in
[1:44:52] the name of a prophet they receive the
[1:44:53] prophet's reward we go on to Glory we
[1:44:56] are the ones that he actually presents
[1:44:58] to Jesus when he gets judged amazing to
[1:45:02] think about that story that we read back
[1:45:04] a little while ago crossing the beyond
[1:45:06] the curtain of time is the message yeah
[1:45:09] amazing to think about
[1:45:11] he says he had to fail Moses face
[1:45:14] because he hid because in him was the
[1:45:17] word
[1:45:18] he veiled Jesus as a humble little man
[1:45:20] to keep them from seeing Jehovah I just
[1:45:23] can't get beyond that because I keep
[1:45:24] thinking about it how he just veils
[1:45:26] himself in people throughout the ages
[1:45:28] all of the different men we could talk
[1:45:30] about tonight all of the different women
[1:45:31] that we could talk about tonight that he
[1:45:34] veiled himself in every one of them he
[1:45:37] chose to Veil himself in so that that
[1:45:40] word could continually come down further
[1:45:42] and further and further and further
[1:45:44] throughout all of the ages so that it
[1:45:45] could come to us tonight brothers and
[1:45:47] sisters so that we could be able to
[1:45:49] comprehend with All Saints oh my
[1:45:52] Jesus as a humble little man to keep
[1:45:55] them from seeing Jehovah and he fails
[1:45:58] himself today in Earthen vessels
[1:46:00] with the Shekinah
[1:46:04] the outside
[1:46:05] looks like a bunch of holy rulers old
[1:46:07] Badger skins
[1:46:09] you can look it up in uh
[1:46:11] the unveiling of God he says it so many
[1:46:14] times
[1:46:16] um
[1:46:17] yeah it's amazing but the outside looks
[1:46:19] like a bunch of Holy Rollers old Badger
[1:46:21] skins but the inside hides the Shekinah
[1:46:24] Glory and it ripens the showbread that
[1:46:28] we Feast on
[1:46:29] you know just talking about that we
[1:46:31] could take a whole service about that
[1:46:33] talking about the bread of life it
[1:46:34] ripens the show bread what is he talking
[1:46:36] about that brothers and sisters he's
[1:46:38] talking about adding word cell upon word
[1:46:40] cell keeping that bread alive that bread
[1:46:43] being stored in the holy of holies and
[1:46:45] the holiest of holies inside our souls
[1:46:48] that word which we hide in our heart
[1:46:50] that we might not sin against him we are
[1:46:53] preserving that showbread we have eaten
[1:46:56] that bread every time we read the word
[1:46:58] we Feast on that bread and we preserve
[1:47:00] that bread in our lives every time we
[1:47:02] listen to a message we Feast on that
[1:47:04] bread and we preserve that bread in our
[1:47:06] lives there was a time where that bread
[1:47:09] was only given out by the priest and
[1:47:11] people didn't have the ability to do
[1:47:12] that when the nicolaitan spirit wrote
[1:47:15] that Antichrist Spirit there's another
[1:47:17] time where they could only go out and
[1:47:19] just collect enough just for one day and
[1:47:21] then if they took any more and preserved
[1:47:22] it it would just go rotten
[1:47:25] the showbread for us today brothers and
[1:47:27] sisters it's kind of the same thing if
[1:47:29] we don't actually feed it if we don't
[1:47:31] water it if we don't preserve it in our
[1:47:33] lives by by continually abiding in it
[1:47:37] then it will go rotten in our lives
[1:47:40] it ripens the shoe bread he says that we
[1:47:43] Feast on and drive across the country
[1:47:45] for hundreds of miles see it's the
[1:47:47] believer's food it's only for believers
[1:47:50] remember the showbread was only for the
[1:47:52] believer only see
[1:47:54] showbread seed
[1:47:57] notice what does it do that Shekinah
[1:48:00] Glory over
[1:48:01] the shoe bread kept it from spoiling
[1:48:05] kept it from spoiling I'll just call it
[1:48:07] musicians as we wrap up tonight
[1:48:09] it kept the showbread from spoiling
[1:48:11] remember the manna that came from heaven
[1:48:13] it was stayed in the Shekinah Glory
[1:48:17] from one generation to another
[1:48:20] outside it
[1:48:22] it got wiggle tails in it overnight
[1:48:26] it contaminated
[1:48:28] is that right outside of the Shekinah
[1:48:30] Glory the days of Miracles has passed
[1:48:32] see it's all fanaticism but inside
[1:48:35] talking about the inside
[1:48:38] stand with me tonight as we as we close
[1:48:42] I just want to go back to the original
[1:48:43] quote that I read tonight
[1:48:45] trust there isn't too many quotes
[1:48:49] out of the fundamental foundation for
[1:48:51] faith brother Branham says then
[1:48:53] unconsciously your faith is there
[1:48:57] why is your faith there brothers and
[1:48:59] sisters because you know who is on the
[1:49:02] inside
[1:49:03] you might not feel it but remember
[1:49:06] brother Branham said that Holy Ghost is
[1:49:08] without sensation
[1:49:11] true baptism of the holy spirit is your
[1:49:13] ability to receive the word for your day
[1:49:16] not just receive the word and say I can
[1:49:18] say Amen to the word but to actually
[1:49:20] take the word and eat it
[1:49:22] just like John did he was instructed to
[1:49:25] take the book and eat it and he did and
[1:49:28] it was sweet as honey in his mouth the
[1:49:29] words just roll off our tongues but once
[1:49:32] it gets right down on the inside of
[1:49:34] these Badger skins
[1:49:36] it becomes trouble inside doesn't it
[1:49:39] because the old man starts to die
[1:49:42] but the new man starts to live
[1:49:45] and the more we feed the more the old
[1:49:47] man dies and the more the new man lives
[1:49:50] and the more we do that cycle
[1:49:52] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:49:54] is in the world my goodness
[1:49:57] he says then unconsciously your faith is
[1:49:59] there you don't have to worry about
[1:50:00] whether you've got faith enough to do
[1:50:02] this or faith enough to do that it's
[1:50:04] just there anyhow you just do it because
[1:50:06] the father said so speak the word why
[1:50:09] cry speak just speak and go forwards
[1:50:11] know that you're truly an adopted son
[1:50:14] and daughter of God if you've met the
[1:50:15] requirements then he will meet every
[1:50:18] single one of his promises in our lives
[1:50:19] so long as we're willing to come
[1:50:21] according to his word that's all don't
[1:50:23] listen to Satan don't think about Satan
[1:50:26] when he comes around and says you did
[1:50:27] this or you didn't do that all the stuff
[1:50:29] that Satan tries to do remember God only
[1:50:31] sees you the way that he created you he
[1:50:33] only hears your voice that's all he
[1:50:36] doesn't listen to the accuser of the
[1:50:38] Brethren very soon soon and very soon
[1:50:41] we're going to see the king and when we
[1:50:42] do brothers and sisters Satan is
[1:50:44] completely cast out and he no longer has
[1:50:46] a voice but you know what when he comes
[1:50:48] and tries to accuse us
[1:50:50] God says you know what
[1:50:53] that one that actually came
[1:50:55] that I tricked you with that one that
[1:50:58] Holy one that was born in that woman
[1:51:02] that one was a kinsman redeemer
[1:51:05] and that one paid the price once and for
[1:51:07] all for every single one of my children
[1:51:10] and there isn't one of them that I'll
[1:51:12] lose and it doesn't matter what you try
[1:51:13] and tell me about that person you know
[1:51:15] how it is when you love someone someone
[1:51:17] could come and try and tell you anything
[1:51:18] about them and you'll say I don't care
[1:51:20] what you say to me about that person I
[1:51:22] don't want to hear it I don't want to
[1:51:23] hear it don't even talk to me close your
[1:51:25] mouth go away imagine that's what God
[1:51:28] does for us
[1:51:30] you've got nothing to say Satan I paid
[1:51:32] the price and you know it
[1:51:34] it's finished they're saved they're my
[1:51:36] adopted Sons and Daughters of God
[1:51:39] but we just bypassed our theophonies and
[1:51:42] we haven't experienced that realm in our
[1:51:45] consciousness
[1:51:46] so we don't really understand that we
[1:51:48] just have to believe it by faith
[1:51:50] and that's the faith brother Branham is
[1:51:52] talking about here
[1:51:53] that Faith it's just unconscious your
[1:51:56] faith is there you don't have to worry
[1:51:58] about whether you've got faith enough to
[1:51:59] do this think about a person that gets
[1:52:01] laid up in a hospital bed maybe they
[1:52:03] have amnesia maybe they have some
[1:52:05] terrible disease where they forget
[1:52:07] everything about them and all the people
[1:52:09] around them all of the stuff in their
[1:52:11] life is gone but then you start to sing
[1:52:13] a gospel song around them and they just
[1:52:15] start to sing the song something just
[1:52:17] starts to happen in their life because
[1:52:19] you can't change what's on the inside of
[1:52:21] a person this flesh has to fail
[1:52:24] whether we go to the sky or the grave
[1:52:26] this flesh it's going to perish
[1:52:30] then unconsciously your faith is there
[1:52:32] you don't have to worry about whether
[1:52:33] you've got faith enough to do this or
[1:52:34] faith enough to do that it's just there
[1:52:36] anyhow you just do it because the father
[1:52:38] said so and it's the Living Word in you
[1:52:43] it's not the Living Word in Calgary
[1:52:45] Living Word assembly it's the Living
[1:52:47] Word in every one of us that's what
[1:52:48] makes this The Living Word Assembly of
[1:52:50] God it's us
[1:52:52] it's him living out through us the
[1:52:54] Shekinah Glory behind the badger skin
[1:52:57] The Living Word
[1:52:58] in you and God's in you manifesting
[1:53:02] himself just like he was in Christ you
[1:53:04] say he as he was in Christ that's a
[1:53:07] pretty heavy statement as he was in
[1:53:09] Christ
[1:53:12] Prophet for our day says yes yes sir
[1:53:16] he said the works that I do shall you do
[1:53:19] also even more than this
[1:53:22] for I go to my father
[1:53:24] we've said it many times but you know
[1:53:26] it's possible to be
[1:53:28] a nuisance to the devil
[1:53:30] so that he doesn't even know what to do
[1:53:31] with us
[1:53:33] we could be so hidden Christ that he
[1:53:35] can't even find us
[1:53:37] he can't change our testimony
[1:53:39] brother Branham talks about it you can
[1:53:42] throw them up and throw them down you
[1:53:44] can get them sick
[1:53:45] I believe it's in the Statue of a
[1:53:47] perfect man
[1:53:49] maybe it's in the adoption series it's
[1:53:50] in the adoption series for sure it is he
[1:53:53] says the tutor
[1:53:55] having a good tutor goes to the father
[1:53:57] and says you know that son I've I've
[1:53:59] I've seen him get beat up I've seen him
[1:54:01] up and down I've seen his wife against
[1:54:03] him I've seen the church against him
[1:54:04] I've seen friends against him I've seen
[1:54:06] him sick I've seen him well I've seen
[1:54:09] all these different things up and down
[1:54:10] and all around and he just doesn't
[1:54:11] change his testimony he just keeps
[1:54:14] praising you this is the report the
[1:54:16] Tudor gives to the father brothers and
[1:54:18] sisters what's the father gonna say
[1:54:20] that's my son that's my daughter
[1:54:24] that's who exactly who I created them to
[1:54:26] be
[1:54:27] that's what we want the report to be
[1:54:29] back to the father from our tutor and we
[1:54:31] know that Tudor is the Holy Ghost
[1:54:33] we don't want him going back with the
[1:54:35] report saying you know he's almost got
[1:54:37] the word most of it he believes most of
[1:54:38] it but every once in a while there's one
[1:54:40] or two situations that come around and
[1:54:42] he just doesn't really speak the word to
[1:54:44] that situation yet what's gonna happen
[1:54:46] brothers and sisters that situation is
[1:54:49] going to keep coming back to us it's
[1:54:51] going to keep returning to us until we
[1:54:53] actually pass the test and it's going to
[1:54:55] be the word test and I'm saying I'm
[1:54:57] speaking to me here right now I've got
[1:54:59] my own tests brothers and sisters let me
[1:55:01] tell you but you know what I know that
[1:55:04] I'll prevail
[1:55:05] because he said I would
[1:55:08] just like he said that he loved me
[1:55:11] let's just bow and prayer tonight
[1:55:13] gracious Heavenly Father tonight I pray
[1:55:15] that the words that were spoken would
[1:55:16] just be encouragement to your children
[1:55:18] father Lord I pray that you would just
[1:55:20] bless the words that were spoken to our
[1:55:22] spiritual nourishment tonight father
[1:55:24] that Lord as we go forwards we would not
[1:55:27] look at what the accuser says but we
[1:55:29] would look to what you say father that
[1:55:31] we would just start to have that faith
[1:55:33] that unconscious Faith live out through
[1:55:36] us in our lives Lord Jesus that while
[1:55:38] the situations come our way that we just
[1:55:40] won't be shaken because we know that you
[1:55:43] have everything under control Lord Jesus
[1:55:45] we just love you and we thank you

[1:55:58] through how many different hands of men
[1:56:00] how many different voices of men how
[1:56:02] many different pens of men for us to be
[1:56:04] able to be here today to comprehend it
[1:56:07] Lord father we thank you for sending us
[1:56:09] a prophet Lord that you could speak to
[1:56:11] us through according to your word your
[1:56:13] word says that you will speak to men
[1:56:15] through a prophet and father we're so
[1:56:17] thankful that you've given us the
[1:56:18] ability to receive a prophet
[1:56:21] we pray Lord Jesus that you would just
[1:56:23] bless the word that was spoken that you
[1:56:24] would go with us as we go our separate
[1:56:26] ways If It Be Your Will for us to meet
