you your word is your your love is pure Lord and your gracious unto us Lord electing us before the foundation of the world without us knowing oh Lord Jesus that you will even before the foundation of the world you can just say that you are in my thoughts you are predestinated telling us Lord being your sons daughters and even being your bride Lord the newly wedded wife that has all your attributes Lord in US where you dwell in us oh Lord Jesus oh Lord this is all because of your love or it was love that hang you on the tree Lord because we're precious in your sight and we're so precious that our our price is your life very precious Lord that what can be precious more than more than life itself even as if if anyone will give us million dollar or even billion dollars for a day but then the next day we will die we won't accept that million dollar or billion dollars because that life is so precious and that life Lord you have Lord through your blood and Calvary Lord you have covered our sins you have cleansed our sins completely oh Lord Jesus that's why we are so thankful unto you Lord for your sacrifice to us no one can do it Lord accept you therefore we are here gathered Lord before you Lord so that we can we can express our love express our worship express our adoration our thankfulness unto you Lord for what you have done Lord we just pray that it will not be in vain Lord as we lord progress ourselves Lord we are not even worthy Lord but you made us worthy by by substituting yourself unto us being the appropriate propitiation of our sins Lord we became perfect Lord because you were perfect oh Lord we want to thank you now Lord you want to Lord be changed Lord from glory to glory as we preached your word Lord and we hear it oh Lord may we receive it gladly and live according to it oh Lord may you settle my nerves Lord so many notes that we can we can tackle Lord we can we can read we can preach we can teach Lord but there's only one thing that that you always wanted us Lord is for us to receive your word completely stay oh God may you be in US Lord to all of us the preacher and even the here Lord because no one is worthy but you alone Lord Jesus as I Surrender unto you Lord that's the key Lord I don't want I don't want to take on my notes Lord I just want to preach from my heart whatever you have put in Me O Lord Jesus without any notes without any projection of of slides Lord may you be in control of all things now from beginning to end Jesus Christ name we pray amen thank you musicians maybe while you're standing let's read the two verses Revelations 2 11. very familiar scripture Revelations 2 11. so we will we won't have slides tonight although the topic is very long maybe the ministers who will preach next time and even Barbary will take we will pick up where we will live let's see how it goes but uh yeah I don't want to take lots of your time this evening so let's see where we will be able to to take his word for for tonight amen Revelations 2 11 very simple but very powerful he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcome it shall not be heard of the second death amen and Ephesians 4 30. very familiar scripture because the thing is if we are preaching something not familiar there's something might be wrong right so we we're just repeating what the prophet of this age has taught us because we are under his ministry amen Ephesians 4 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption may the Lord have blessing on the reading of his word you may be seated amen if you can see I'll I'll title my sermon the bride is at rest with this word amen because when you know that this word is for a purpose everything that happens is for ordained regardless of what perspective from man's perspective we know that it could be a difficult to go through that Journey as we've been fellowshipping during the uh with Barbara and Brad Paul if we know then from the beginning because it's written in the word right we will go to rapture we will we will be with him in Paradise in in heaven in Millennium and later on in New Haven and Newark we all know that we will be raptured because we're the bride of Christ amen but then he didn't tell us how we will go through that it it's it's not very clear on on the scripture or on what will happen to Brother Don brother Paul or myself but the good thing is we know the end right but that Journey is always uh it's rough most most of the time right but then there's a purpose for that right because if it's not rough then it's a smooth sailing we might not need God anymore we might not call him anymore if uh if if everything is smooth sailing right if if Joseph would know that he will be in prison although he knew that his family will bow through uh we will bow on him because he he had that uh he had that uh Vision or or dream that he would to become governor basically right because they later on we found out in the scripture that he became governor of Egypt and is next to pharaoh right so it's not mentioned that way but then his family and his brothers and sisters uh the other 11 tribes will bow on him do you think Jacob will sign sign sign up on that even though he's thinking it's great knowing that he will go to prison he will be you know you know all the all the afflictions all the difficulties that he will that he uh encountered do you think he will sign up for that so even us knowing that we will we will be ruptured let's say but then if God will tell us what uh what will be our next step what the afflictions we will take you think uh you think we will sign up for difficulties but then the thing is God is in control he knows right and that's why the bride is at rest knowing that his word will be fulfilled right so there's so many things that we as the bride didn't want to sign up and we think that our prayers are not answered but actually he answers our prayers without knowing it typically we let's say we ask for strength right but that cannot be overnight so what does God do to us so that we can we can have the strength he will give us difficulties right to make us strong so those difficulties amen we will build strength right and and then we ask for wisdom uh wisdom is a gift right but then knowingly if we want to wisdom it's not overnight that oh I give you wisdom here it is no what what he will give us is problems to solve so that we know how to roam around that uh that problem and then we will have the wisdom right so all those white hair with those who who have white hair they they just didn't come overnight they came through age right they came through experience and that's why when we ask for wisdom let's say we ask the elders right because Elder means uh is the the length of uh office uh serving the lord right is a service to the Lord that's why Elders in the church it's it's how long they they've been serving the lord that's why you you want to ask how did they go through that right oh without knowing right without knowing we are fulfilling or or God is answering our prayers amen so another one is uh if we ask for courage so God will give us dangers to overcome them by depending on him right so the bride is over overcoming power right so sometimes we say we have to be careful on what we pray for right but then the things we need all this the afflictions of the righteous right uh even uh you know God is not the author of confusion right the the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord so therefore everything that happens to us is for ordained we just don't know but sometimes it's self-inflicted we have to be careful but then the thing is that is a permissive will that will accomplish is perfect will we will go back to the middle which is the which is the word amen and and again we ask to have love I know this is the call for for for today because the Capstone is love that's charity right that's the Capstone of of the pyramid we know that and then if we ask for love what what will God typically gives us he will give us troubles right he will give us the troublemakers whether it's a family or a friend or whoever that we will express love so that so yeah if we can love the unlovable that is the true love which is love which is unconditional love amen so regardless of what's going on that's why this message is full of grace actually we think so much of the the legalism but actually we pass that because the law it will just condemn us that we're sinners but then Paul is saying the law uh Jesus Christ said he didn't he didn't come to uh to what do you call it uh to uh not to follow the law right but to magnify it but magnifying means what to know that we cannot do it by our own right we need the Lord that's why the thing is we are living by grace the Old Testament saints were living by law but then you see they were not ruptured until God until Jesus Christ died on the cross you will see the last person that that accepted him is the the right the one on the cross right that person didn't even get baptized he didn't have any chance right but he was you know the other one is mocking Jesus the other one is uh marking the other one or or rebuking the other one hey we are both Sinners and then we're but him he didn't do anything right but then what did he ask Ed please don't forget me right so what did Jesus say today you will be with me in Paradise so he is the last Old Testament saint that got raptured together with Jesus Christ he didn't he didn't I'm pretty sure he didn't know of justification right because he's a it's a thief I guess right he's a sinner right he didn't know sanctification right justification sanctification baptism of the whole ghost how would he know that being a sinner right but then he accepted Jesus Christ so the only thing there is accepting Jesus Christ personally right regard those those are those uh like uh uh Acts 2 38 right repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but at for his case he didn't have that chance but then the thing is he's the one that need to be accepted because he's there right and he died for all our sins it means he didn't die for the righteous right he died for the Sinners amen so we're so thankful amen that we are at rest regardless of what's going on in our lives we know that he's in control right so if if he's in control we are at rest that's the real rest we labor and to rest meaning uh it's so difficult to be at rest because when we know that we can do something then that's the thing that God will do to us is uh he will he might not hear our prayers because we're doing it by our own he wants us to rely on him completely amen so being at rest means you rely on the word completely right and and he will do it so even Branham is saying the greatest gift is for William Branham to get out of the way right and then and that's the thing he he he can be used completely if he's surrendered amen the bride doesn't have any thought of his of her own it's all gods amen and if we if we think that way then we will not rely on our own understanding right we will not rely on our own thinking our own intellect our own skill amen we think that we can turn the world upside down no we can't right so it's it's the thing and the brightest a different mindset we're focused on the eternal if we will if we would want to achieve anything in this world Brian Branham is saying is Achieve eternal life because all of this will perish anyway amen it's so important amen so you can see here he that happened here let him hear what the spirit said and to the churches you see he didn't say he that has a mouth or a tongue right he that had an ear when you hear it means your taking the input somebody is talking and then you're listening and then of course we have to listen to the voice of God right and how would you know if it is the voice of God it is according to the word amen it's different from the the one when you're talking talking means you're expressing your thought but the bride has not thought of his own right and if we are if we are of course we are all in progress when we talk and it's not according to the word then that's not the the the the thought of God because if we are if we have the mind of Christ then we will talk about the word of God every time we are read uh we are living Epistles red of all man and we know that God will interpret his word by bringing it to pass we might not know that we're fulfilling it already because the thing is when it come to pass that means it's past tense right Branham is saying oh you you must have all of this when he was preaching but he was taken out of the scene in 1965. so what now are we left uh without a messenger no we that that's the reason why we have the prophetic Ministry and there is Ministry of uh Malachi 4 Ephesians 4 11 but we're preaching the same thing as what he preached because what he preaches what Paul preached which is the word of God that's why his colleagues go back to the word always amen it's not our own word at all no because the thing is that's why whoever is behind here we'll say the same thing because we have we have common source the Bible and the message it's not our own understanding and not our own might and intellect or whatever right so I I just wanna read a quote here that even even Charles porgin Charles Charles sparjan he said Martin Luther said I have covenanted with my Lord that he should not send me Visions or dreams or even angels I am content with this gift of the scriptures which teaches and supplies all that is necessary both for this life and that which is to come so it means the world is enough we know we need the the the the mechanics and the Dynamics but they are all encompassing the Lord Jesus Christ that is our God right the Lord Jesus Christ is the complete name of God and he is the word right this is not new to everyone right because we're we're preaching to the to Believers here and it's so important for us that we should gather here to hear the word because this is the only place where we put his name on and right now we know the mercy seat is still applicable but then the thing is it's only for the bride why because the seals were already open we know already uh all the mystery which are history now right and it is through the bride right now that's why we are the hope of this generation we always we always say that because Grace can be only extended through the bride right now it's not through the other denominations because the thing is we have the full world already it was given to us it was revealed to us how through the prophet it has been preached here why do we need a prophet why do we believe what we believe right because God or the word comes through Prophets we are not God but God comes through us because we are speaking what the word says amen and there are some written word we we have spoken word but there are also Unwritten word the unwritten word can only be interpreted by the prophet amen and and and we're so glad for us he didn't withhold any information to us that's why we have an open book is are the Seven Seals open yes amen there is no such thing as uh the the seventh seal is not yet open because the thing is the seals is Christ himself right he cannot when he went down with an open book it says right it's just not revealed before the before the seals were open but they are already open when they came down and we believe that that's through the cloud when when when Barbara Branham was caught up amen so we're so thankful that uh we have all those uh we have the word for our day right and and uh with that we are at rest with the word amen and and we can see that the the Holy Spirit we always uh we we hear it because it's important right we need to have the in feeling of the Holy Spirit at the same time we need to be sealed by the Holy Spirit right and we will we will tackle that somehow and then uh just wanna bring a thought here uh because pre-seals and post seals uh they're they're kind of important because God corrected Branham we're not the one correcting Branham it's God himself who corrected him because he's also human beings like you and me amen and then uh we can see that uh sometimes he will even pre-seals and then after the seals were open then he uh he was corrected and then uh it's it's important that we know those things for example uh I will give a I I will give a a study a little bit here because uh pre-sales regarding New Birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost and adoption in pre-sales brother Branham is saying these are all different so maybe we will I will I will read in countdown uh in 1962 November 9th he said this is pre-sales okay this is uh before 1963. he said and the new birth as people talks that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth now that's wrong so this is random speaking okay I'm not trying to to make the quotes fight with each other but then being human being and then being filled with the Holy Ghost he's subject to correction by the word it's only the word that can correct him amen so he said that the new birth as people talks that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth now that's wrong the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from the new birth the new birth is when you're born again okay that's why it's born again so you have a new bird but the Holy Ghost is when power comes into that word for service that's exact see the Holy Ghost is baptized into the Holy Ghost so so you see he's saying it's different so the the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from the New Birth this is in countdown you can take note of those uh but I can give you the quote later on so so you see and then another one is uh about uh in question and answers in COD 1961 uh January 12. he said the evidence that you've got the Holy Ghost is the life that you live but he corrected that later or we know it's the ability to receive the word for your day right so buy their fruits you shall know them and the fruit of the spirit is not nowhere in scripture found speaking in tongues the fruit of the spirit is love joy Faith long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience see now that is the fruit that's what you find on the tree to tell what kind of factory it is but but the the fruit of the holy spirit is just the product of what what you are right but it's not the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost but then post seals okay uh in Sumerian Church age we know this is grammarista later on and then it was out I think in 1965 or something so he said here I mean for The Sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit or born of the holy spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one and the same so you see so we need to progress that's why we cannot bring one coat and run with it we have to we always we have the 1200 plus sermons right and we have the cell phone or whatever tablet we have we have the ability to search that's why it's flowing through the bride right now the the mercy cities in man right now brother Branham is saying it's in the heart of man that's why we're the one who's giving Mercy to everyone because we know the truth amen another one in this million Church AIDS again does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so amen and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as Sons placing is what adoption so it means it's all the same what I'm what I'm talking about here is a the new birth what is the new birth is revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you so if he's revealed are you not going to be baptized with this Holy Spirit if you if he's revealed to you personally are you not going to be placed or adopted as full Sons heir of all the inheritance that's why the thing is it's kind of it will be a vicious cycle when we think that uh we need to be baptized first or we need to be born again first and then we will receive the the Holy Ghost right because it's always a question asked that uh and and that kind of thinking will will lead to two types of people but we're not those people okay I'll just mention it because the thing is if we know that these are all the same and it will happen because once you're sealed you're sealed that's the one we we read Ephesians 4 30. we are sealed until when the day of our Redemption amen so the first type of people that will uh will will come out of thinking that these are two different things those are so-called legalistic or self-righteous right they are blind to their own sin who feel that they have achieved the proper level of goodness to have received the Holy Ghost so it means they they they're it's a cobra right it's it's like a covering it's a religion so these are called the self-righteous Pharisees sometimes the Pharisees you can interpret interpret them the the the word as far to see Pharisee right or the Sadducees they are sad to see right so but we're not those right they're self-righteous people right the other type will be those who are always moping around feeling that they can never achieve the proper level of goodness to be able to believe that they have received the Holy Ghost so it means we're working on our own self it means we fail daily right everyone is a sinner that's why we backed like daily Paul is saying but remember only the Christians only through Christians backslide right because when you're a sinner and then you're already condemned then you're already out of the of the race right but then we're not we don't have that right to put in or out anyone right that's why Grace is flowing through the bride right now amen and we're so happy that the seals were opened and and God used the prophet who showing that he can make mistakes like you and me because even the prophet of old prophets of old they also made mistakes right so the thing is but when he says that said the Lord and uh it it came from the Lord and and how can we know that that's the truth it will be fulfilled amen it will be manifested amen and we're so glad that uh we have that ability to receive the word for this day and that's the evidence that we have the holy spirit amen because the thing is we cannot have the the uh the word of Moses to work in this day amen word of Noah so it's the word of our Vindicated prophet right that had thousands of visions that came to pass and we know some are not yet fulfilled but they will be fulfilled fulfilled means that's the proof that they that the word is true once they are fulfilled and for us we're fulfilling prophecies without even knowing it right how do we know that we're fulfilling prophecies because we walk it's automatic life for us but we're in progress right preaching to myself I'm the worst of all worse so I will accept that then but the thing is accepting that you're a sinner is the key right it's just like complex when you know that there's an issue once you identify that you have a complex 50 is solved right but if you don't know that you have a complex then you think that you're doing right but then you have already an issue right but then it's the thing that that discernment is very important that you you really have the the issue and that's why we need the Lord to change us right even repentance what is repentance repentance is so important is the desire to change you don't want to go back to where you came from and although it's difficult because of this flesh but you have the desire to change amen that's that's what you call complete repentance amen and uh we're so glad that we we are taught very well by by the prophet and uh we don't need to worry being bright that's why we are at rest because of his word his promises will be fulfilled amen it's so good that uh the life of God will be just expressed automatically but we need to feed we need to be in service we need to be to not forsake the assembling as we see that they approaching amen it's very important that's why you can see even even with our uh chat group when one is sick everyone will be praying that's the importance of being in the body when one is sick then everyone is hurting also right so it's so important and and it doesn't matter who's preaching here as long as he's preaching the word and we know we need to be immersed with the word every time all of us we have all our part amen and and we are called to do so wherever we go right so so that's why we are walking a piece else ahead of all men it will just automatically we'll see brother uh they will see brother Gilbert even though he was he was just standing on the on the bus station there and then the person there I know you're a man of God how did he know he didn't even talk to him right because of the how we conduct ourselves Lord help us amen we don't want to misrepresent the Lord wherever we go even on simple things on sing small things because small things matter amen because those will be accumulated and become big things and how can God you know uh trust us in uh big things if if small things he cannot trust us that's why working around forgive me Lord I don't want to work around on anything even simple thing amen we that's our sincere disciple because perfection is removing all the small small items there because we have all we can see the full picture but then still we still have impurities we still have all those extra uh you you can say if you have a drawing of of a man then you need to erase some of those imperfections so that it will become perfect it's just like the gold right you need to beat it up until you will remove all the impurities until you will see the your image which is the image of God Amen it's the it's the same and that can only happen if we have the word for our day amen so I don't want to uh tackle a lot of things uh today but then the thing is uh the important thing is I'll just read some of the quotes here you can see that happen here an ear let him hear what the spirit of the Lord says to the churches right he it says it's singular right that's why there's only one messenger for every age that Messenger will hear what the spirit of the Lord is saying at that age for that age let's tackle about our age right now this is an AIDS although we we move up with the bride AIDS but then our messenger is Barbara Branham no doubt and then he is the one who had the ear to hear but then the thing is what what happens to that messenger is he will broadcast what he heard to the people that will receive but who can receive what the spirit said is only for those specific people that's why for us we're so special that we can hear anything that Branham is saying is good for us he will not let us go astray or you know all the instructions that is required for Rapture because this message is for Rapture right because the other six ages they were not ruptured they're waiting for us to be perfected right so this this age is for full word not partial word the the previous ones they didn't receive the full word but for us we were given the full word so I will read this now we have this is still in uh Sumerian Church age now we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the AIDS in which he lives let me show you most clearly he said The Seven Ages are set forth in Revelations chapter 2 and 3 taking the whole span of the fullness of the Gentiles or the whole time in which God is dealing with the Gentiles and to Salvation in every single age Bar None it says the very same thing in opening and closing the message to it to its age what is that and to the messenger of Ephesus Philadelphia right this thing said he etc etc he that happened here let him let him singular hear what the spirit said to the churches okay notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word for that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and the one that one messenger is the messenger to the true church and it's that is capital c we are the true church amen we are the uh you can say the the the true church which is the bride church he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches but true and false the message is then broadcast to all okay but though it is broadcast for all who come within Reigns of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way or we thank the lord we receive it amen each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger those who hear are not getting their own private revelation amen we cannot interpret the message by our own right nor is a group getting their Collective Revelation it's not by our own group we God deals with us individually amen but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God that's why we cannot preach other messages amen because even in Galatians 1 8 right though we are an angel from heaven preaching the gospel then that we have preached unto you let him be accursed because that one is that said the Lord amen he always give us the the real interpretation because he's a prophet by birth right it's a Vindicated Prophet because all the Visions all the prophecies uh most uh some will be fulfilled Amen in the future but uh he had a lot of them and it's all he's a Vindicated Prophet that's why we're here we believe the message of the hour otherwise we will just be yeah moping around and you know uh will be drag pillar to pose or whatever but then the thing is we have the anchor which is the message and the message will bring us back to the word amen very very important amen so now just just to continue here now think it not strange that this is the case for Paul said this pattern under the hand of God Paul alone had the full Revelation for his day as evidenced by his confrontation of the other apostles who admitted that Paul was the prophet Messenger to the Gentiles for that day no one can dispute that he's the messenger for the Gentiles right even the even the apostles knew that uh because uh the the Jews left the left the world so we Lo we turn to the Gentiles that's what Paul said right so he's the prophet Messenger to the Gentiles for that day and also note by actually illustration in the word that when Paul decided to go to Asia God forbade him for for the ship his children were in Macedonia and and the macedonians would hear what the spirit had to say through Paul while the people in Asia would not so it means in in this case it's geographical location those who are in Macedonia will hear what Paul will say but not in Asia so for us we had a Vindicated Prophet from America we are here in North America right and we heard it although it this message is not only for for North America anyway that's why it's uh Briar Branham went all over the world seven times so that this will be preached but this will only be received by who the elect amen and then elect means you're predestinated you're for ordained to receive it whether you like it or not amen and it isn't that good amen that whether you like it or not even though you think that uh you can do something but then God will not allow you right that's why all those prayers that we think that oh God is not hearing my prayers but actually he hears amen and we don't even need to worry why uh why we think it's not answer or a prayer will not be answered but actually it is answered it's always for maturity means our character is being built through those afflictions amen and we are at rest amen when we have the when we know that the word is fulfilled through US amen God is good amen are we good yeah I will I will close soon so that everyone will wake up [Laughter] uh I know we're not sleeping but uh it's just repeating what others are saying in closing they will say right and they're all nice it's it's short all right so I have some a little bit of a illustration later on here but I will explain it and end it with that one it will be a little bit different you might have seen this but I will explain it in a in a in a way that will uh will be easily understood even by the younger younger ones we are one school one room Schoolhouse right so so if if we check on this I know our topic our topic today by the way is uh yeah the bride is at rest with the word and we know we know uh when we have the word we it just proves that we have the uh we have the Holy Ghost if we have the ability to receive the word right and and the word uh the word it means receive the word for our day right so uh because unbelief or or the original sin is unbelief in the word of God so if you don't believe the word you are sinning right but we are given the the the ability to receive it through the through the prophet of this age that's why we're not see we are declared righteous because of that right so if you see for example I put two so that I can do it two times so if you can see these are exactly the same right if if from far you will not see a difference right so there ginger ale and this this is aluminum can aluminum can right but from fire you won't see but there is a difference right I will be here one is empty and open one is full and sealed they're saying like a Proverbs I I cannot find it in the Bible but they said that if you are empty you're noisy it's more maybe as compared to the one that uh so it means you uh or or or maybe in a different way when when uh when a body of water is deep it's calm but those who are shallower noisy right but then that's one but then with this uh when it comes to being filled and sealed I just want to show you that uh this one is empty right this one is full so now if I will do a little bit of a demonstration okay you can see it so this is empty okay so I will step on it so what happened so it just crashed I'll try the one with the seal and with filled and seal let's see I hope it will not I hope I'm not that heavy okay oh wow so what did you get from there the thing is these are exactly the same vessels but one is empty and open the other one is filled and sealed so the one that I did think of those or think of that action as Trials of life right afflictions uh all the problems and everything so what will happen if you're not filled and sealed you will be crushed but if you are filled and sealed and we know that what fills us and seals us is the Holy Ghost then we can withstand all those trials and sufferings so what do we need to do brothers and sisters we need to be filled and sealed allow the Lord to fill us and seal us so that we can whatever Trials of this life will you know we encounter we know that we can reach the destination we will withstand amen so it's very important to be filled and sealed with the holy spirit amen oh I hope that's one so we can repeat this one but later on we can drink this so again right so coke same vessel but this time it's different colors so we know the Lord is uh uh you know he can use any vessel right it's the same thing right so I will do it again ah okay so this is crushed so again this one is sealed okay this is good to its destination it means that's why it reaches us and then we can buy it right so it's a it's a it's a product amen so see it's strong right because it's filled and sealed so we need that brothers and sisters we can only do that though if we allow God to fill us and seal us amen so I hope that's uh it's it's a very good illustration to see that uh not the holy spirit because you are sealed until the day of what of our Redemption so no matter what trial will come we will overcome because you are filled and sealed with the holy spirit amen and that's why it's so important to understand that this word will bring Perfection will bring us to the Rapture will bring us to maturity it will bake our greenness our immaturity amen it's very important I'll call the musician so that we'll take a lot of time but later on we'll uh we'll have more presentations better but what what am I trying to say here it's very important that we know our position again again brothers and sisters all the preaching here is all about maturity being in position because we know when you're not in position God cannot work it's so important for us to know our positions it doesn't mean that one is not doing his position you will be affected although it's a change effect right but then the thing is it's between our personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ even the husband is not doing his part the wife should do his her part right if if the wife is not doing her the husband should do their part same for the for the children we cannot blame somebody else because it's a personal revelation personal relationship to Christ although we are we We Are all uh in one unit right it's like a chain right but but we need to have Grace on each other we need to help each other brothers and sisters that's why we we must belong to a body or Believers wherever you are it's so important and what more we're bringing the word the full word we're not even denominational uh uh uh uh you know we're not even in denomination we are the full Perfect Bride word of Jesus Christ we're so thankful brothers and sisters uh if we can just understand who we are then you will be at rest you will be at rest no matter what we we might think of okay oh it's good for for my children and children's children to to have a lot of things no we should just enjoy the fruit of our labor here because in the end it will be their own lives as well and then for us it's uh we're aiming for for the eternal life not not to to acquire all the things here but you know it's not bad to be you know living in a good life here because of your the fruit of your labor right because Abraham is was rich right uh even job but then the thing is that's not the point the point there is we must know our Focus we must focus on the things that are eternal and it's so important brothers and sisters to be really you know uh in a body where where somebody can pray for you because uh every every prayer counts amen and then it's so important that's that's the real love for for a Believer is to to live for others basically right Eternal eternal life is living for others it means we must start that while we are still living here on Earth we cannot wait for millennium to do that because there's no point anymore that's why we need to help each other here and uh you know be be subjected to the word that we receive for the day amen we're so glad that we have all those uh nuggets I know it's very short and hopefully it was a little bit uh encouraging that we know every word will be fulfilled amen and we can rely on that amen and uh remember once you are filled and sealed you can storm the weather right we know that that one cities inspected it will go to its destination which is what Redemption right that's why the inspector will check whether there's a loose end or whatever there for us once we are filled and sealed we will reach Redemption we will be redeemed because we belong to him Redemption means paying for what is yours you cannot redeem something that is not yours right it has been explained before amen if you if you point a watch only the owner can you know pay pay back and and take it back right if it if it's not yours then they will not even allow you to to redeem it and we belong to God because we were in him before the foundation of the world Amen there's so many many things oh for this message that's why never ending preaching in uh with the 1200 messages you will see it it's very rich right but the important thing the Capstone let's not forget that the love for one another amen how would you know that you love me you love you have love for one another amen so so important brothers and sisters we were given the instruction and we don't need to worry so much we will be at rest when we know that uh his word will be fulfilled amen let's sing brother what do you have huh greater is he doesn't that is in me amen [Music] greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me he that is in the world Satan's like a roaring lion roaming to and from [Music] the Bible tells us so [Music] many Souls have been his praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] greater is he that is [Music] that is in me literacy that is [Music] he that is [Music] in me about and prayer oh Lord Jesus we want to thank you Lord for this evening Lord might be short Lord but we know that you are in US Lord with us and in US and we know all things that is in God he poured into Christ and all that is in Christ he poured it into the church which is US O Lord and when we have You O Lord Jesus what why do we worry we don't need to worry at all Lord Jesus we want to be encouraged by Your Word Lord Jesus just to show even with this simple illustration oh Lord Jesus that when we are filled and sealed with your Holy Spirit we don't need to worry at all no matter what circumstance circumstances that will be before us all Lord Jesus will have that power Lord to overcome because you have filled us and sealed us with your Holy Spirit oh Lord when we have your Holy Spirit in US Lord we will have that ability to receive every word Lord for our day and when we have your word for our day Lord we'll just continue until you come Lord we might not all be perfect right now we might not all be matured right now Lord but uh we are in progress this is the process of redemption oh Lord Jesus when where you have showed us Lord until we reach our final maturity unleash when you remove all the immaturity in us oh Lord we just have to lay under the presence of the son Lord which is your word Lord Jesus oh Lord help us to to go back to the word every time lord when we have any any doubt oh Lord Jesus help us to understand show it to us in scripture in the message Lord where where that's our our main source of our living O Lord we don't need to worry at all Lord Jesus we know we love each other Lord Jesus that's why we are here gathering together Lord May that love be a couple of unconditional love Lord not feel your love oh Lord Jesus and and we know we can we can do that by extending Grace to each and every one of us all standing on the Gap even for those who are not Believers Lord because we know it's not only believers who will be who will be in in the new Heaven and new earth there will be other classes of people oh Lord Jesus but those people Lord can only attain such salvation through us oh Lord Jesus we don't have the prophet now with us Lord but then he left a very precious message which is the message of the hour Lord that comes through a Vindicated Prophet where where we can we can go back to the world and it will line up Lord it will dovetail with the with the scripture every dot every detail will be fulfilled Lord and we know that that's why we can rest assured Lord that the we can rely on your word Lord Jesus oh God we want to thank you for for putting us in position now Lord Jesus so that we can we can receive your word because we know even brother Branham when he see visions and before something will be fulfilled everything that he saw in the vision must be in place before he can say oh you'll be healed oh because before he can declare healing he will have a sign oh Lord Jesus all those things oh Lord Jesus we're so thankful Lord that you have healed us with our spiritual Amnesia that's why we know who we are Lord and by knowing who we are we will be in position and we can receive your word completely oh Lord Jesus we want to thank you now for this evening Lord made you encourage me with your word Lord may it be an encouragement to your people as well it might be simple Lord we don't need to complicate things oh Lord Jesus because you work in Simplicity and you reveal yourself also in the same oh Lord help us Lord that we will understand and thank you for your revelation we pray now that you'll uh take care of the sick Lord even the brother Aiden I believe he's getting well now Lord Jesus we we pray for his complete deliverance Lord from from that illness O

person that just doesn't have the ceiling you know they're making lots of noise and they're rattling around but when that bug board comes back and it's loaded down it's got a full load of the word of God inside of it and it's sealed it's just like the cans tonight what a beautiful depiction that was sealed and filled filled and sealed my goodness I would pray but brother Mervin already did we'll
