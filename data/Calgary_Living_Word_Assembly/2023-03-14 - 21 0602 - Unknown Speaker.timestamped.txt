[43:46] and your mercy to each one of us Lord
[43:48] every one of us has the testimony of
[43:52] what you have done for us in our lives
[43:55] and Lord what you are currently doing in
[43:57] our lives
[43:59] father we're so thankful that you sent
[44:01] us a prophet that would show us
[44:04] that you are the same yesterday today
[44:07] and forever
[44:08] you are not a god of History
[44:11] you are not a god of the future
[44:13] but that you are the present tense I am

[44:46] just take the preeminence that you
[44:49] desire that you would speak to us once

[45:06] God bless you
[45:08] musicians thank you so much
[45:11] we have your Bibles tonight
[45:13] just like to read from the book of
[45:14] Colossians
[45:16] chapter one
[45:21] and then Ephesians chapter 5.
[45:25] a little bit of a different way
[45:28] tonight but maybe a similar Direction
[45:36] Colossians chapter 1 verse 21.
[45:40] to 23.
[45:44] Ephesians 5 verses 26
[45:48] and 27.
[45:54] Colossians 1 21
[45:58] and you
[46:00] that were sometimes alienated and
[46:03] enemies in your mind by Wicked works
[46:07] yet now hath he reconciled
[46:10] in the body of his flesh through death
[46:14] to present you holy
[46:16] and unblameable
[46:18] and unreprovable in his sight
[46:22] if ye continue in the faith grounded and
[46:26] settled
[46:27] and be not moved away from the hope of
[46:30] the Gospel which ye have heard
[46:32] and which was preached to every creature
[46:34] which is under heaven
[46:36] where of I Paul
[46:38] and made a minister
[46:42] Ephesians chapter 5.
[46:48] just two verses out of a real familiar
[46:50] scripture
[46:53] verse 26 and 27.
[46:58] that he might sanctify
[47:00] and cleanse it with the washing
[47:04] with the water with the washing of the
[47:07] Water by the word
[47:09] that he might present it to himself a
[47:12] glorious Church
[47:14] not having spot
[47:16] or wrinkle
[47:18] or any such thing
[47:20] but that it should be holy
[47:22] and without blemish
[47:25] let's just bow
[47:27] gracious Heavenly Father
[47:29] Lord we're so thankful for your word
[47:32] Lord we're so thankful that your word it
[47:35] doesn't just speak to us a word but it
[47:39] speaks to us life
[47:41] father it shows us our identity
[47:45] Lord Jesus we see you in every chapter
[47:48] in every verse in every line
[47:51] and Lord we see ourselves in you
[47:55] what an honor and a privilege it is Lord
[47:57] Jesus
[47:59] not by anything that we have done
[48:02] but that you chose us first in you
[48:05] before the foundation of the world
[48:08] Lord Jesus tonight we pray that you
[48:10] would just take this word that you would
[48:12] break it open to us fresh again
[48:15] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[48:19] I bless you tonight you may be seated
[48:25] certainly thankful to be back
[48:27] we
[48:31] definitely put on some kilometers while
[48:33] we were away
[48:35] I certainly am thankful
[48:39] to the brothers for the brothers that
[48:41] put their shoulder to the wheel in my
[48:43] absence
[48:45] that were willing to step in and just
[48:47] allow the Lord to use them
[48:50] trust the Lord blessed you with their
[48:52] their offering their sacred portion
[48:56] it's definitely not easy to just come
[48:58] and minister
[48:59] we certainly don't take it lightly
[49:02] we uh on our on our trip we drove just
[49:06] over 2500 kilometers
[49:08] we went to Smithers BC which is just
[49:10] about to the coast of the northern
[49:13] Highway 16.
[49:15] just about to uh Prince Rupert we went
[49:18] to a place called Smithers and then 90
[49:20] kilometers further north from there
[49:22] and had a wonderful time of fellowship
[49:24] with the stewards brother John Stewart
[49:26] sister Jocelyn Stewart was there and
[49:29] they said to send their greetings to the
[49:32] faithful Saints in Calgary
[49:34] I don't know uh some of the people many
[49:37] people probably remember Sister Jocelyn
[49:39] living with us here fellowshipping with
[49:41] us while she went to school so we got to
[49:43] know her a bit a few years ago
[49:46] but it was certainly neat to see them
[49:48] and and brother John Jr
[49:51] and his wife sister Katrina we got to
[49:54] see them they live in Prince George so
[49:57] we got to go past their house on the way
[49:59] out on the way back
[50:01] it was just wonderful to stop in and see
[50:03] Believers and talk about the word and we
[50:05] had a real treat while we were there
[50:07] sister Katrina's mother was there from
[50:09] Pennsylvania
[50:10] sister Andrea so it was real real nice
[50:13] to talk to another genuine believer you
[50:16] know from a different place altogether
[50:18] but you can tell the The Same Spirit
[50:20] just it's wonderful to be around
[50:22] believers
[50:24] so we had just a wonderful time we had
[50:26] good weather and traveling mercies it
[50:28] was wonderful the Lord showed us just
[50:31] just a wonderful time together as a
[50:33] family and uh you know there's something
[50:36] special about spending a lot of time
[50:37] together in really close quarters
[50:41] where you don't have any distractions of
[50:44] life where it's just a totally different
[50:46] setting and uh
[50:48] just just absolutely wonderful thankful
[50:51] for the the prayers and support to be
[50:54] able to get away and do that
[50:57] the Lord really blessed us we got to see
[50:58] over 10 bears
[51:00] on the road it was just a wonderful
[51:02] wonderful time
[51:05] we uh look forward to what's coming up
[51:07] in our future here
[51:09] seeing the uh
[51:11] the restrictions are about to change
[51:14] Lord willing
[51:16] and uh
[51:17] I think as early as the 10th of June it
[51:20] looks like that will be where they
[51:22] switch from this phase one again the new
[51:25] phase one uh approach to reopening
[51:29] where we'll be allowed to have one third
[51:31] of the fire code allowed to be in the
[51:34] place of worship
[51:35] so we'll go from 15 percent which is 12
[51:39] people
[51:40] which yeah it's just funny how it
[51:42] flip-flops like that but that's where we
[51:44] are today we're allowed 12 people again
[51:46] we were allowed 15.
[51:48] but now uh we're gonna go to one third
[51:51] of the fire code is what they said by
[51:53] June 10th which would uh be just
[51:55] wonderful glorious in fact that will put
[51:57] us to a total of 26.6 people that will
[52:01] be allowed to have Fellowship here I
[52:03] don't know who the 0.6 of a person will
[52:06] be but I'm sure we can figure that out
[52:09] um but then you know early July the end
[52:11] of June uh they're saying no
[52:13] restrictions which I find amazing
[52:16] and uh what a time it will be of
[52:19] rejoicing
[52:22] we have a busy month of June and uh
[52:25] I apologize for anyone who has maybe
[52:27] taken back or taken by surprise at the
[52:31] new calendar that came out and uh I just
[52:34] have felt led for a while
[52:36] to try something new and we had talked
[52:39] about it a while ago about potentially
[52:40] doing additional services to allow for a
[52:44] greater rotation of the people
[52:46] and uh
[52:47] more frequent attendance to church
[52:51] and I had said you know
[52:54] um
[52:55] I'm a bit reluctant to actually start
[52:56] doing that if we have trouble filling
[52:59] just uh regular services
[53:01] and sometimes there is a lag I think
[53:04] brother Gilbert addressed it pretty
[53:06] straight when he ministered the last
[53:08] time but
[53:10] I just felt you know what let's go for
[53:12] it we talked about it with the ministry
[53:14] the ministry is interested in supporting
[53:16] it and uh so that takes a little bit of
[53:18] pressure off of me I really appreciate
[53:20] that it gives the ministry an
[53:22] opportunity to use their gift we know
[53:26] that it's important to be able to use
[53:27] your gift
[53:28] if God has given you one so
[53:31] um we're switching over to two Services
[53:33] a Sunday now we'll do a morning service
[53:36] and a Sunday night service
[53:38] and I know for some I just want to make
[53:42] it clear we're not interested in trying
[53:44] to put pressure on people
[53:46] um if if it doesn't work for you to come
[53:48] to church two times in one day then
[53:50] that's okay
[53:51] we don't want to put pressure on you
[53:52] don't don't don't think we're asking for
[53:55] money we're not pulling on money
[53:57] we're just simply saying we're going to
[53:58] open the doors and we're going to have
[54:00] another opportunity to worship God and
[54:02] as true believers I I don't see what
[54:05] else there really is in this world the
[54:07] more we look around the darker it gets
[54:11] we had a
[54:12] I was telling brother Emmanuel in the
[54:15] back we were in Jasper on our way back
[54:17] yesterday
[54:19] we stopped in Jasper to get a coffee we
[54:22] enjoy coffee
[54:23] and so we just wanted to get a little
[54:26] bit of a special coffee we got a nice
[54:28] one there in Jasper and Isaac said to me
[54:30] he said Daddy I saw a sign that I think
[54:32] was a bad sign what do you think is it
[54:35] bad and I said well what was it
[54:38] and he says the sign said I
[54:41] and then the heart symbol
[54:43] being gay
[54:46] and and I thought you know out of my my
[54:49] 11 year old son here we are
[54:52] getting a reflection of this nasty world
[54:54] that we live in
[54:56] and and as you drive through town
[54:58] There's the rainbow
[55:00] crosswalk
[55:01] and you know
[55:04] probably this is the kind of stuff that
[55:06] will get us shut down
[55:07] because we are are now labeled
[55:10] officially
[55:12] hate speech if we speak against being
[55:16] gay
[55:17] but you know what it's contrary to the
[55:19] word
[55:21] and until they rewrite the actual
[55:23] Constitution
[55:25] I believe we have the free right to
[55:27] speech as well according to the word
[55:30] and if they want to shut us down for
[55:32] calling truth truth
[55:34] then I guess that's what they need to do
[55:37] but you know what we're ready for it we
[55:39] had kind of a dry run here with this
[55:41] coved situation huh
[55:44] not saying that we want to make
[55:46] ourselves fanatics
[55:48] and and make a spiritual battle out of
[55:50] something that isn't really at our
[55:52] doorsteps but just to look at the
[55:54] situation now our children have to deal
[55:56] with this our children are being taught
[55:58] this in schools
[56:00] what a world we live in as we go
[56:03] brothers and sisters what else is there
[56:05] but fellowshipping with believers
[56:08] brother Branham said that coming to
[56:10] church is as close as we get to heaven
[56:12] on this side of Eternity that we will
[56:15] get
[56:17] so just for the record if you're if
[56:18] you're if you're busy if if you're
[56:21] swamped if if things just don't go right
[56:23] for you if it's too far out of your
[56:25] tradition or whatever to do a dual
[56:27] service on a Sunday there's no pressure
[56:30] don't feel pressured we just want to
[56:33] have church for those people who want to
[56:35] for the next little while it'll only be
[56:36] 26 people anyways and you know when the
[56:39] restrictions lift then uh
[56:41] we'll be able to just have church and
[56:43] you know we don't want to make it a
[56:44] bunch of of of laborious preaching where
[56:48] everyone is so burdened down and keep
[56:50] everyone here till 10 30 or 11 o'clock
[56:52] at night when we have school the next
[56:54] day we're not looking to do that what we
[56:57] want to do is encourage the people to
[56:59] exhort one another even more so as we
[57:01] see the day approaching
[57:03] give the children the ability to to be
[57:05] in an environment that's going to uplift
[57:07] and encourage them
[57:10] just to be able to worship God freely
[57:12] because we don't know how many more
[57:13] times we're going to have we really
[57:15] don't
[57:16] as the world grows darker it's going to
[57:20] get more and more difficult so forgive
[57:23] me but I just felt led to change that I
[57:25] know it's out of our our normal
[57:27] tradition here uh Sundays are a special
[57:29] time for folks for Fellowship like I
[57:31] said if if you feel led that's what you
[57:34] want to do then there's no judgment
[57:36] just do as you feel led
[57:39] we're anticipating uh more of a rotation
[57:42] for people to be able to come to church
[57:44] and uh you know we had changed this even
[57:48] before they decided to lift the
[57:49] restrictions and it was it was partially
[57:52] a coveted thing
[57:53] but partially
[57:55] a worship thing
[57:57] let's just see what God will do
[58:00] you know if we just keep doing the same
[58:02] thing over and over again
[58:04] and and hoping for
[58:06] a new result or a different result
[58:09] what does brother Branham call that
[58:10] what's the true definition of that
[58:13] it's insanity
[58:15] we need to be able to march forward
[58:16] brothers and sisters not not stay in the
[58:19] same place doing the same thing over and
[58:20] over again not saying that what we're
[58:22] doing is wrong
[58:24] but if we can do more why wouldn't we
[58:27] we just want to see what the Lord will
[58:28] do we we uh we read the scriptures we'll
[58:32] get into the scriptures in a couple of
[58:33] minutes I just have a a quote that I
[58:36] wanted to read
[58:38] out of uh what's out of the greatest
[58:40] news flash in history in 1961.
[58:43] brother Branham says they stayed there
[58:45] 40 years and died there
[58:48] right back over the same old thing all
[58:52] the time that's all right Acts 2 verse 4
[58:55] is part of it
[58:56] but the thing of it is
[58:58] he said one day to his rise you've been
[59:02] on this mountain for 40 years
[59:05] turn north
[59:07] Cross Jordan Yonder the separation
[59:11] for there's more than this mountain for
[59:14] you there's more than Acts 2 verse 4 for
[59:19] you
[59:19] every promise in the book belongs to the
[59:23] church
[59:24] and God's waiting for his church
[59:27] to rise and receive it
[59:31] he's given it to the church
[59:34] we've talked about the the Mysteries and
[59:37] the cloud and and and and the Bloody
[59:40] lamb and and the one that sat on the
[59:42] throne with the book in his hand and how
[59:44] he went and he took the book and he came
[59:46] down and put one foot on the line and
[59:47] one foot on the sea and and he delivered
[59:49] the book and and took that book and
[59:51] delivered it to the prophet and now the
[59:52] prophet is given it to the church and
[59:54] now what
[59:56] what's the church doing
[59:58] brother Adam says it right here
[1:00:01] and God's waiting for his church
[1:00:06] not just to receive it
[1:00:08] but to rise and receive it
[1:00:12] I I don't know this just inspires me
[1:00:14] here we have a prophet of God Vindicated
[1:00:17] prophet of God saying that God is
[1:00:19] waiting for his church to rise and
[1:00:23] receive it
[1:00:26] and I want to say this I'll just throw
[1:00:27] this in there even more so as you see
[1:00:30] the day approaching
[1:00:32] not just assembling ourselves together
[1:00:34] but exhorting one another
[1:00:36] encouraging one another right
[1:00:39] little Branham goes on to say how can
[1:00:41] you do it when you're still thirsting
[1:00:43] and wanting to be like the world
[1:00:47] how can they do it when they're still
[1:00:49] eating longing for garlic the flashpots
[1:00:52] of Egypt no
[1:00:55] this just spoke to me so vividly because
[1:00:58] of the study we did a while ago on
[1:01:00] Joshua and Ephesians paralleling Joshua
[1:01:03] that whole story of Joshua going
[1:01:05] forwards to conquer the land and God
[1:01:07] just cultivating the children of Israel
[1:01:09] and showing them that there's sin in the
[1:01:12] camp and you've got to just deal with
[1:01:14] these things in your life just clean
[1:01:15] them out just get rid of them and when
[1:01:17] you do that you can March forward again
[1:01:18] with the Surety and and know that you
[1:01:21] don't have to be afraid of the enemies
[1:01:22] when they come because they will come
[1:01:25] brothers and sisters Satan ain't gonna
[1:01:26] let us move forwards in a Peaceable
[1:01:29] manner Satan's going to come guns
[1:01:31] blazing
[1:01:32] for the true bride
[1:01:35] brother Branham says keep in step with
[1:01:37] Joshua that's right
[1:01:39] get the new grapes and the new
[1:01:40] Pentecostal wine
[1:01:43] get drunk on it
[1:01:46] I'm not saying go get wine I'm reading
[1:01:48] what the prophet said here he's talking
[1:01:49] about getting the Holy Spirit there's a
[1:01:51] stimulation that happens from the
[1:01:53] Revelation that that book is no longer
[1:01:55] in the hand of one sitting on the throne
[1:01:57] or in the hand of that Bloody lamb or
[1:02:00] even in the hand of the Prophet that
[1:02:01] book is now in our hands
[1:02:05] right he says get drunk on it brother
[1:02:07] you you won't yeah you won't even look
[1:02:10] at the world anymore
[1:02:12] something will happen to you oh let's go
[1:02:15] forward following the steps of our great
[1:02:17] leader and conqueror remember God told
[1:02:19] Joshua
[1:02:21] every place The Souls of your footsteps
[1:02:23] that's possession
[1:02:27] that's possession
[1:02:30] brother them footsteps means possession
[1:02:33] let's just keep walking into the
[1:02:35] promised land Not Looking Back to see
[1:02:37] what will happen back there and what
[1:02:39] somebody else is doing
[1:02:41] don't look at other churches don't look
[1:02:43] at other people don't look at one
[1:02:45] another look to Christ
[1:02:47] don't even look at me brothers and
[1:02:48] sisters he says let's just keep walking
[1:02:50] into the promised land Not Looking Back
[1:02:52] to see what will happen back there and
[1:02:54] what somebody else is doing keep your
[1:02:56] eyes on Jesus the Joshua the leader just
[1:03:00] keep moving on deeper depths and higher
[1:03:03] Heights until you're possess everything
[1:03:05] that God promised to you in his word
[1:03:11] not someone else not another church
[1:03:14] not not maybe what our our old teaching
[1:03:17] was or or maybe what we think maybe
[1:03:20] could be
[1:03:21] let's just look to Christ
[1:03:23] you know out of Hebrews chapter 10 I
[1:03:25] quoted it already but verse 22 let us
[1:03:27] draw near with a true heart and full
[1:03:29] Assurance of Faith having our hearts
[1:03:31] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[1:03:34] our bodies washed with pure water how do
[1:03:37] our bodies get washed brothers and
[1:03:40] sisters by pure water
[1:03:42] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:03:45] we read that already right
[1:03:47] having our bodies washed with pure water
[1:03:50] let us hold fast the profession of our
[1:03:53] faith without wavering
[1:03:55] for he is faithful that promised
[1:03:57] and and you know the famous scripture is
[1:04:00] coming up here and let us consider not
[1:04:02] one another to provoke unto love and to
[1:04:05] Good Works let's encourage one another
[1:04:09] let's be encouraging to one another
[1:04:12] let's consider one another to provoke
[1:04:14] unto love and to Good Works not
[1:04:16] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[1:04:18] together as the manner of some is
[1:04:21] because it is some people actually
[1:04:24] believe that it's okay to just forsake
[1:04:26] the assembling of yourselves it's it's
[1:04:29] true
[1:04:30] that spirit's alive and well is it alive
[1:04:32] in Paul's day it's alive today we don't
[1:04:34] have to look very far to see it it's
[1:04:37] alive and well today
[1:04:39] not forsaking the assembling of
[1:04:40] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:04:43] is but exhorting one another
[1:04:47] and so much the more as ye see the day
[1:04:51] approaching
[1:04:53] just thinking about that brothers and
[1:04:55] sisters how much exhorting could we do
[1:04:57] to one another
[1:04:58] to take our services and just just about
[1:05:01] double them in the course of a month
[1:05:04] whether we stream or whether we come in
[1:05:06] person
[1:05:08] I know myself the more Believers faces
[1:05:11] that I get to see the happier I am I
[1:05:14] could see a million other people in this
[1:05:16] world and it's fine and good but when
[1:05:18] you get to be around a Believer
[1:05:19] something happens there's a fellowship
[1:05:22] that happens and you don't even really
[1:05:24] have to say very much sometimes
[1:05:27] it's wonderful
[1:05:29] so I just trust as we go forwards pray
[1:05:31] with me brothers and sisters that the
[1:05:33] Lord will just take the the opportunity
[1:05:35] to
[1:05:37] maybe just show us why maybe I'm crazy
[1:05:39] and and
[1:05:41] I don't know
[1:05:43] I just believe there's something in
[1:05:44] store for us here
[1:05:48] I got another uh quote here or a few we
[1:05:52] still got some time 45 minutes maybe
[1:05:55] um out of images of Christ in 1959
[1:06:00] this this one just put me on the floor I
[1:06:02] just love this one this one's so good
[1:06:04] I'm going after tomorrow night after
[1:06:07] this wedding I'm going into the
[1:06:08] Wilderness and I mean to stay there
[1:06:11] because I weigh down in in my soul I
[1:06:14] feel that I need a closer walk with God
[1:06:17] than than what I'm
[1:06:21] imagine this is the prophet of God here
[1:06:23] saying this
[1:06:24] I need a closer walk with God
[1:06:27] we know he had that Vision to be
[1:06:30] more
[1:06:34] he had that vision of the black mamba
[1:06:37] snake
[1:06:39] just to be sincere
[1:06:41] right
[1:06:44] I'm thinking about this here about going
[1:06:45] into the Wilderness and uh
[1:06:48] it it just it really struck me when we
[1:06:50] were out there we were out in the middle
[1:06:51] of nowhere basically a place called fort
[1:06:54] babine
[1:06:55] and uh sort of mid Central uh
[1:07:00] Northern
[1:07:01] British Columbia
[1:07:03] not very much around
[1:07:05] and while we were there sitting around
[1:07:07] the fire one night
[1:07:09] we're just sitting there and somebody
[1:07:10] says look at that up in the sky and and
[1:07:13] so we look up and we see what you can't
[1:07:15] see it and just keep watching and sure
[1:07:18] enough there's another one we see this
[1:07:20] star just go like this
[1:07:23] and uh then there's another one right
[1:07:25] behind it
[1:07:26] and then there's another one right
[1:07:27] behind it and there's another one right
[1:07:29] behind it and and we're like what what
[1:07:33] on Earth is that
[1:07:34] I've seen a satellite before that just
[1:07:37] keeps going and going and you can see it
[1:07:38] Go by but this was like a star that
[1:07:40] would just sort of get bright and then
[1:07:42] disappear and it must have just been the
[1:07:44] way it was reflecting or whatever but my
[1:07:47] point with all of this I came back and
[1:07:49] we concluded around the fire that it
[1:07:50] must be something to do with man it must
[1:07:53] be satellites or something I came back
[1:07:55] and and truly it is it's SpaceX but you
[1:07:58] know even even out in the wilderness now
[1:08:01] where the Prophet could go and just get
[1:08:03] away from man and all of the spirits we
[1:08:06] can't even go into the Wilderness now
[1:08:07] and not see man looking into the heavens
[1:08:11] to look at how perverted this world
[1:08:13] really is brothers and sisters you know
[1:08:16] coming in here seems to be almost the
[1:08:18] only place if we didn't have the sounds
[1:08:20] of the vehicles going by it's amazing
[1:08:22] how this world really is
[1:08:24] looking at the prophet here he says I'm
[1:08:26] going after tomorrow night after this
[1:08:28] wedding I'm going into the Wilderness
[1:08:30] and I mean to stay there because I weigh
[1:08:32] down in my soul I feel that I need a
[1:08:34] closer walk with God than what I'm I
[1:08:36] don't don't
[1:08:38] to just walk I try to walk right before
[1:08:42] him but I want a closer walk with him
[1:08:46] while the Branham Tabernacles having a
[1:08:49] Revival
[1:08:50] I want one myself
[1:08:53] I don't want to just happen in the
[1:08:56] building
[1:08:57] I want it to happen in me
[1:09:00] I want a closer walk
[1:09:03] I want more of the holy spirit in me to
[1:09:08] reflect Christ in me
[1:09:11] I want to be like him
[1:09:14] I know that every true Christian wants
[1:09:17] to be like him
[1:09:20] we don't want to reflect ourselves
[1:09:22] we don't want to reflect all anything
[1:09:25] else other than him in this world he
[1:09:28] says that's my heart's desire to be like
[1:09:30] Jesus he well I want I want him to be my
[1:09:33] I want him to be the he is the example
[1:09:36] of what I want to be
[1:09:39] and look
[1:09:41] it'll take the Holy Ghost to do that
[1:09:45] that's the only thing that can do it
[1:09:48] it's things like this that I read that I
[1:09:50] think my
[1:09:52] thank you Lord I know that I'm on the
[1:09:54] right track what I'm talking about the
[1:09:55] Holy Ghost it just is like a Vindication
[1:09:58] for me and and maybe for some people
[1:10:00] it's it's just preaching to the choir
[1:10:03] but I think there's other people that
[1:10:05] will just get excited about it and say
[1:10:06] Amen
[1:10:08] I think brother Paul said it well you
[1:10:10] know there's
[1:10:12] Believers lives we hear the word and
[1:10:14] something just says it right
[1:10:15] you just say Amen say Amen to the word
[1:10:20] goes on to say I'm not interested in
[1:10:22] seminaries and what somebody's got to
[1:10:25] tell me
[1:10:27] I don't care about kissing crucifix or
[1:10:30] pulling through your heart
[1:10:32] or saying prayers to the Dead
[1:10:35] I'm interested in one thing
[1:10:38] that's more of the Holy Spirit to take
[1:10:41] over William Branham
[1:10:44] this is the prophet how much more the
[1:10:47] bride
[1:10:49] I'm not interested in joining a greater
[1:10:51] Church than what I belong to I belong to
[1:10:54] the real Church of the Living God of the
[1:10:57] firstborn I was born into it and I want
[1:11:00] more of the holy ghost in my life to
[1:11:03] reflect Christ who I love
[1:11:07] I think this is powerful here I'm not
[1:11:09] interested in joining a greater Church
[1:11:11] than what I belong to
[1:11:13] [Laughter]
[1:11:16] because I I belong to the real Church of
[1:11:20] the Living God the first
[1:11:26] it's not some other church somewhere
[1:11:29] else geographically that will give me a
[1:11:31] greater Revelation or a greater uh
[1:11:34] Ministry of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:36] we have all of that in our fingertips
[1:11:39] right now
[1:11:40] I want more of the holy ghost in my life
[1:11:43] to reflect Christ
[1:11:45] who I love
[1:11:47] I just I just have to say it this way
[1:11:50] slowly just hopefully this resonates he
[1:11:53] says I don't care what plane or level I
[1:11:56] have come
[1:11:57] come onto to get it
[1:12:01] I don't care if I have to go here or go
[1:12:04] there be called a fanatic holy ruler or
[1:12:07] whatever it might be
[1:12:09] I want more of his life to be reflected
[1:12:15] excuse me
[1:12:16] he just lays this out in here and I mean
[1:12:18] there's no there's no interpreting what
[1:12:21] he's trying to say here he's saying it
[1:12:23] so clearly I'm not interested in the
[1:12:26] plane I have come on
[1:12:28] I'm not interested in in where I'm at
[1:12:30] spiritually speaking brothers and
[1:12:32] sisters
[1:12:33] I believe that's truly The Cry of a of a
[1:12:36] of a True Believer I'm not interested in
[1:12:38] staying where I'm at I want to go higher
[1:12:41] I want to go farther we just heard the
[1:12:43] prophet say that footsteps are
[1:12:45] possession the farther that we're
[1:12:47] willing to go
[1:12:48] the more he's willing to give us
[1:12:51] I remember he said it that we started
[1:12:53] with that where he said God gave it and
[1:12:56] he's just waiting for his church to rise
[1:12:58] up and take it
[1:13:01] I'm not interested in the plane I've
[1:13:03] come to on I'm I'm interested in the
[1:13:05] Holy Ghost so I can be more of a servant
[1:13:08] like he was
[1:13:10] he was the Lord's servant
[1:13:15] wow
[1:13:16] never come to be served or ministered to
[1:13:20] never come for he to be ministered to
[1:13:23] but to minister to
[1:13:25] he took the place of the servant
[1:13:27] and if the king of Heaven could do that
[1:13:30] and we're the members of his body
[1:13:34] let's all be likewise
[1:13:37] there's no great ones amongst us
[1:13:39] no big eyes or little use
[1:13:42] or all one body the mystical body of
[1:13:45] Jesus Christ I love how he said that I'm
[1:13:47] looking for a greater Church
[1:13:49] we've got the greatest church that we
[1:13:51] could ever find brothers and sisters and
[1:13:53] that's Jesus Christ
[1:13:55] to be born into that mystical body of
[1:13:58] Jesus Christ it's not something that we
[1:14:00] can actually go and Achieve or bring
[1:14:02] ourselves to it's what he's called us to
[1:14:05] be who he called us to be
[1:14:08] he took the place of a servant and if
[1:14:10] the king of Heaven could do that
[1:14:12] and we are the members of his body let's
[1:14:15] all be likewise
[1:14:17] not be different
[1:14:19] but humble ourselves in his presence
[1:14:23] brothers and sisters where's his
[1:14:24] presence
[1:14:26] when we live our lives worstest presence
[1:14:28] is it just inside the building here
[1:14:31] his presence I'll say it because we all
[1:14:33] know it but I'm going to say it anyways
[1:14:35] it's in the presence of one another
[1:14:39] that's his presence
[1:14:41] that's his his chosen vessel that's how
[1:14:44] he's chosen to represent himself to this
[1:14:46] last age
[1:14:48] there's a whole entire group of people
[1:14:50] we talked about it so many times this
[1:14:51] they're looking for the 60-foot Jesus
[1:14:53] they're looking for some other
[1:14:55] Revelation they're looking for
[1:14:56] Revelation 19 to happen and and they're
[1:14:58] missing what's happening right now and
[1:15:00] brother Branham says they're actually
[1:15:01] ignoring what's happening right now
[1:15:04] because they don't want to hear a
[1:15:06] prophet
[1:15:07] because the word only comes to a prophet
[1:15:10] but for those people who have been
[1:15:11] chosen elected by God predestinated in
[1:15:14] him from before the foundation of the
[1:15:16] world they've been given ears to hear
[1:15:17] what the spirit saith to the church how
[1:15:19] does the spirit saith it to the church
[1:15:21] but through a Vindicated prophet
[1:15:25] he says here not be different but be
[1:15:28] humble ourselves in his presence no
[1:15:32] matter what the world's got to say or
[1:15:34] the intellectual people
[1:15:36] I just think about the message Scholars
[1:15:38] when I when I read that there the
[1:15:40] intellectual people
[1:15:42] not thinking about that just receive
[1:15:45] more of the Holy Ghost and be like Jesus
[1:15:49] humble meekly lowly
[1:15:52] take his place
[1:15:54] and he will take yours at the judgment
[1:15:58] my goodness I feel like we could just
[1:15:59] end it right there just with that one
[1:16:01] quote and and maybe just go away and
[1:16:03] listen to that message and just think
[1:16:04] about it
[1:16:06] the prophet of God he's not interested
[1:16:08] in staying in the same place not
[1:16:10] interested in how far he's come he knows
[1:16:13] that there's a greater miracle there's a
[1:16:15] greater calling
[1:16:17] you know there's a couple of examples in
[1:16:18] the Bible I'll just quickly go over and
[1:16:20] we know that Enoch was one of them right
[1:16:22] he had a testimony that that that
[1:16:24] pleased God he walked with God and he
[1:16:27] pleased him and he was not
[1:16:30] type of the Bride Enoch he he wasn't
[1:16:33] interested in staying where he was he
[1:16:36] knew that something greater was coming
[1:16:37] and we know that Elijah he had something
[1:16:40] greater too he had a revelation he knew
[1:16:42] that he was going to be taken up and
[1:16:44] that if Elisha he saw him go well you
[1:16:47] know what you can have what you asked
[1:16:48] for and it's interesting because in
[1:16:51] Elisha's life he didn't ask for anything
[1:16:52] other than a double portion of that same
[1:16:55] spirit that he had and you know we'll
[1:16:57] never ask anything amiss if we truly
[1:17:00] have the right spirit of God in our
[1:17:02] lives and I mean there's only one spirit
[1:17:04] of God don't get me wrong
[1:17:06] I worded that wrong there is only one
[1:17:09] spirit of God if we have his spirit in
[1:17:11] our lives we will never ask amiss ever
[1:17:14] and you know many times the devil will
[1:17:16] come around and say look at you and look
[1:17:18] at what you've done or you haven't done
[1:17:19] and you're a sinner how could you ever
[1:17:22] be that one who could just please God
[1:17:24] like Enoch and be not but remember David
[1:17:27] was one who was a man after God's Own
[1:17:31] Heart and it didn't matter what David
[1:17:33] did what gave him the difference what
[1:17:35] made the difference in David's life the
[1:17:37] prophet spelled it out super clearly he
[1:17:39] said the difference in David's life than
[1:17:41] anyone else what made his heart a heart
[1:17:44] after God's Own Heart a man after God's
[1:17:47] Own Heart was that he was quick to
[1:17:48] repent brothers and sisters we know the
[1:17:51] Zeal of this age is to repent in the
[1:17:54] heart of a True Believer and that's
[1:17:56] that's what does it for us is to say
[1:17:58] Lord I want to humble myself at your
[1:18:00] feet I don't want to say that I've got
[1:18:02] it made in the shade it's all done for
[1:18:04] me and and I was saved way back there at
[1:18:06] some camp meeting somewhere 25 30 50
[1:18:09] years ago and it's never going to change
[1:18:11] for me no way we've got to keep walking
[1:18:13] we got to keep marching forward
[1:18:15] footsteps is possession
[1:18:18] David was a man after God's Own Heart
[1:18:21] he was quick to repent
[1:18:23] brothers and sisters it's no different
[1:18:25] there's not a different spirit in the
[1:18:27] heart of a True Believer today
[1:18:29] we make mistakes
[1:18:31] we trip and we fall and what do we do we
[1:18:34] humble ourselves one to another and we
[1:18:37] exhort one another even more so as we
[1:18:40] see the day approaching
[1:18:43] we don't just let it lie and say you
[1:18:45] know I'll just
[1:18:46] it is what it is that person is just
[1:18:48] that person and I'll just leave it alone
[1:18:50] and that'll be that no
[1:18:52] no we're quick to repent just like David
[1:18:55] because we have a heart after God's Own
[1:18:58] Heart if we are his bride
[1:19:00] if we are his bride
[1:19:03] then the Twain have become one
[1:19:07] but you know I just thought I would
[1:19:09] maybe just talk about the the the people
[1:19:13] that I just mentioned and and we can
[1:19:15] look at them and say you know they're
[1:19:16] great heroes in the Bible
[1:19:19] but what about you
[1:19:21] take your name and put it there
[1:19:24] and think about that how we can have a
[1:19:27] heart after God's Own Heart we can be a
[1:19:30] man or a woman after God's Own Heart we
[1:19:33] can be people who actually please God
[1:19:36] with our walk it might not be easy
[1:19:39] it might be really difficult but even in
[1:19:42] the midst of the difficulties we can
[1:19:44] turn around and start to praise
[1:19:47] and see the Lord come on the scene and
[1:19:49] change things and you know many times in
[1:19:51] our lives brothers and sisters I just
[1:19:53] believe that that really the more we
[1:19:55] experience it the more it will just be
[1:19:58] so real to us we can see the Lord moving
[1:20:00] our lives so many times and maybe if we
[1:20:03] don't do things a whole lot differently
[1:20:05] if we could just actually adjust our
[1:20:07] thoughts adjust our actions just a tiny
[1:20:10] little bit and instead of maybe getting
[1:20:12] upset or flustered or even afraid in a
[1:20:14] situation start to laugh and sing praise
[1:20:17] just show Satan a totally different song
[1:20:21] in your heart show them something
[1:20:22] different don't be the same creature
[1:20:25] that we once were show Satan whose side
[1:20:28] you're on show him a new creature where
[1:20:31] in Christ Jesus walking in flesh
[1:20:35] your name brothers and sisters
[1:20:38] it's got to come down to you and I
[1:20:40] it has to it's fine to talk about the
[1:20:43] heroes in the Bible and and the prophet
[1:20:45] of our day but what about you
[1:20:48] we talked about the seven sons of Siva
[1:20:51] probably a long time ago and we know
[1:20:53] that those those Devils they said you
[1:20:55] know Jesus I know and Paul I know but
[1:20:57] who are you
[1:20:58] we can say well I'll tell you who who I
[1:21:02] am I'm a Son of God I'm a son of the
[1:21:04] most high God I am actually part of the
[1:21:07] mystical body of Jesus Christ now who
[1:21:09] are you how dare you think you can come
[1:21:12] and actually bring whatever it is you're
[1:21:14] trying to in the presence of the most
[1:21:17] high God
[1:21:20] brothers and sisters let's put our name
[1:21:21] there
[1:21:23] talking about the Holy Ghost out of
[1:21:26] Christ is the mystery
[1:21:28] of God revealed
[1:21:30] now lack of this now
[1:21:33] and Paul this great intellectual man he
[1:21:36] never tried to express his great
[1:21:39] theological terms upon the people
[1:21:43] he humbly accepted the word of the Lord
[1:21:46] and he lived the word
[1:21:48] so that it expressed it
[1:21:52] he lives so so Godly
[1:21:55] until they seen Jesus Christ in him so
[1:22:00] much
[1:22:01] till they wanted his handkerchief
[1:22:04] to take it and lay it upon the sick
[1:22:08] this is Paul's life
[1:22:12] brother Branham says there's
[1:22:15] The Life of Christ
[1:22:19] but this is Paul we're talking about
[1:22:22] but if that same spirit
[1:22:24] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:22:28] dwells where in you
[1:22:30] it shall Quicken your mortal body
[1:22:33] it brings life how does life come
[1:22:35] brothers and sisters through the body
[1:22:40] he goes on to say not what some oh you
[1:22:43] see Elijah done Elijah done that a long
[1:22:46] time ago
[1:22:48] I just with this particular quote I want
[1:22:51] to say it you know brother brownham he
[1:22:52] he Elijah brother Bradham he'd done that
[1:22:55] a long time ago yep it's easy to look
[1:22:58] back and see that isn't it
[1:23:00] oh you see Elijah done that a long time
[1:23:02] ago he laid laid his stick but oh that
[1:23:05] was the Days of Elijah oh that was the
[1:23:07] days of brother Bradham they had great
[1:23:09] prayer lines and and healing campaigns
[1:23:11] right
[1:23:13] now the world thought that the
[1:23:15] intellectual priests and things in the
[1:23:16] churches of that day thought that but to
[1:23:19] them believers they know it a little
[1:23:21] different
[1:23:23] they seen the revelation of Christ that
[1:23:26] was in Elijah
[1:23:28] have you seen the revelation of Christ
[1:23:30] that was in Elijah brothers and sisters
[1:23:34] it does something for us gives us the
[1:23:37] ability to realize that we don't need to
[1:23:39] see a a healing campaign we don't need
[1:23:42] to see a Vindicated prophet in our day
[1:23:45] because we actually saw the Life of
[1:23:47] Christ Living out through a Vindicated
[1:23:50] prophet in our day which was actually a
[1:23:52] wave Sheaf an example of the first fruit
[1:23:56] that should actually come forward in our
[1:23:58] lives when we come to full maturity
[1:24:02] it's not just for a prophet
[1:24:06] now the world thought that the
[1:24:07] intellectual priests and things and
[1:24:09] churches of that day thought that
[1:24:12] but to them believers they know
[1:24:14] different they seem the revelation of
[1:24:16] Christ that was in Elijah same thing
[1:24:21] was in Paul
[1:24:22] expressed the same kind of life
[1:24:26] because he was a prophecy
[1:24:29] he foretold things that happened exactly
[1:24:31] the way it was and they knowed that was
[1:24:34] God's identification of a prophet I just
[1:24:38] love the way that he talks about this
[1:24:42] about somebody else but as he does that
[1:24:45] he's actually talking about himself
[1:24:48] with this food that's stored up when we
[1:24:50] read this we can look at this and say
[1:24:52] this speaks exactly of William Branham
[1:24:57] even when they seen Peter foretell those
[1:25:00] things that came to pass they said just
[1:25:03] let his shadow pass over me amen
[1:25:06] that's the church
[1:25:08] that's the ones that believe it yes sir
[1:25:15] we have the ability to believe it
[1:25:17] tonight brothers and sisters
[1:25:19] and there's only one way that we are
[1:25:22] able to believe it though
[1:25:24] and that is through the revelation of
[1:25:26] Jesus Christ today the only way that we
[1:25:28] get that Revelation is by the holy
[1:25:30] spirit in our lives
[1:25:32] we've talked about it at length
[1:25:35] we can have the Holy Ghost anointing on
[1:25:37] our flesh and enjoy wonderful services
[1:25:39] and many blessings we can have the Holy
[1:25:42] Ghost anointing on our spirits
[1:25:45] and see even more blessings and be super
[1:25:48] fine people
[1:25:49] but I just love how brother Gilbert did
[1:25:52] that example do you remember how he did
[1:25:54] those circles
[1:25:55] Body Spirit and soul
[1:25:58] and what he did was he showed that snake
[1:26:00] nature that serpent nature inside the
[1:26:03] person unless we get the Holy Ghost
[1:26:05] we've got that serpent nature
[1:26:07] automatically built in to our our bodies
[1:26:10] and automatically built in to our
[1:26:13] spirits
[1:26:14] you know if we're truly called he can't
[1:26:17] touch our soul
[1:26:19] there's no room for a serpent in there
[1:26:21] no room for a snake nature in there is
[1:26:23] there
[1:26:24] that's the one that believes it he says
[1:26:26] yes sir it was revealed by what did Paul
[1:26:28] say because I got a ph lld and so forth
[1:26:32] they believe me no
[1:26:34] he said I forgot all those things
[1:26:37] the wisdom of man
[1:26:40] said had to die
[1:26:42] and I know him in the power of his
[1:26:45] resurrection
[1:26:47] if that ever happens to you brother if
[1:26:48] that ever happens to you sister you you
[1:26:50] get to know him in the power of his
[1:26:53] resurrection
[1:26:54] nobody will ever be able to talk you out
[1:26:56] of it nobody will ever be able to bring
[1:26:59] any bit of false Doctrine there will
[1:27:01] never be any sort of confusion that will
[1:27:03] come around that will take you away I
[1:27:06] often thought when I was younger I heard
[1:27:08] that scripture that the that it would be
[1:27:10] so close that it would deceive the very
[1:27:12] elected if it were possible and maybe
[1:27:14] even now tonight as I I speak those
[1:27:16] words for some people maybe children
[1:27:19] maybe people who haven't been totally
[1:27:21] established in the faith if it feels
[1:27:23] frightening that it could be so close
[1:27:25] that it would deceive the very elected
[1:27:27] if it were possible it's not possible
[1:27:30] period
[1:27:31] if we come according to his requirements
[1:27:34] repent and get baptized in the name of
[1:27:37] the Lord Jesus Christ not entitles
[1:27:40] I don't want to do it in titles it won't
[1:27:42] work it's the wrong formula but if we
[1:27:43] come according to the word for our day
[1:27:46] that was given to us by a Vindicated
[1:27:48] Prophet if we do that then we're given
[1:27:50] the ability to receive the gift of the
[1:27:51] Holy Ghost in our lives and if we
[1:27:53] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost In
[1:27:54] Our Lives we'll never be deceived never
[1:27:56] ever ever because you can't be deceived
[1:27:59] with the Holy Ghost any more than God
[1:28:00] himself can be deceived because the Holy
[1:28:03] Ghost is God it is the holy spirit it's
[1:28:06] his very Spirit dwelling in a human
[1:28:09] being again walking on Earth in flesh
[1:28:12] that is the Holy Ghost many times it can
[1:28:14] sound like it's a nebulous thing like
[1:28:16] it's something different some some other
[1:28:18] person or or maybe another nature it's
[1:28:20] not it's the Lord Jesus Christ dwelling
[1:28:23] in the heart the throne room of man
[1:28:29] Paul says that's what I come to you as
[1:28:32] with the demonstration of God's power
[1:28:35] what was it
[1:28:38] it's just amazing here such so many
[1:28:40] simple things that he says that are just
[1:28:43] so powerful that's what I come to you as
[1:28:45] with the demonstration of God's power
[1:28:48] what was it making Jesus Christ the same
[1:28:51] yesterday today and forever and you know
[1:28:55] that's that's what makes the water
[1:28:56] baptism Doctrine the trinitarian baptism
[1:29:01] and and and baptism in the name of the
[1:29:04] Lord Jesus Christ so contentious because
[1:29:07] one is designed by Satan to actually
[1:29:10] hold you back to keep you away to create
[1:29:13] a diversion and make you believe that
[1:29:16] you're saved make you believe that
[1:29:18] you're safe make you believe that that
[1:29:20] Holy Ghost anointing on your flesh will
[1:29:23] actually save you but you know
[1:29:26] there's only one that will save you and
[1:29:28] that is to have the Holy Ghost in
[1:29:30] your soul in our soul it has to be all
[1:29:33] the way down in our soul
[1:29:35] and our bodies know it
[1:29:37] you know brother Branham tells that
[1:29:38] story of that that woman who is out in
[1:29:40] the world she was a I think a Pianist in
[1:29:43] the church and she was good at playing
[1:29:45] the piano and and she had a a lovely
[1:29:48] life and and was married and then she
[1:29:50] moved to a place and started to actually
[1:29:52] become worldly and got into worldly
[1:29:54] things and before long she found herself
[1:29:56] with a just out in the world basically
[1:29:58] living with another person and and a
[1:30:01] terrible disease and she was in a bed in
[1:30:03] a hospital dying
[1:30:05] and the pastor came to see her
[1:30:08] and she said to the pastor I'm lost
[1:30:12] I'm lost as lost can be I think it was
[1:30:15] to brother Bradham and her pastor sorry
[1:30:17] her pastor is the one who is actually
[1:30:20] teaching her that it was okay to live
[1:30:22] that way
[1:30:23] so close that it would deceive the very
[1:30:25] elected if it were possible but in her
[1:30:27] body in her soul in her spirit as they
[1:30:31] began to separate brother Bradham talks
[1:30:33] about it that Pastor that liar said give
[1:30:36] her a hypo quick give her another hypo
[1:30:38] she said you're a liar you lied to me
[1:30:41] I'm lost as lost can be
[1:30:44] our bodies know it when we get to that
[1:30:45] state and you know so do our families
[1:30:48] when when something goes wrong in our
[1:30:50] lives as believers they know who to
[1:30:53] phone
[1:30:54] because they can see Christ being
[1:30:57] reflected just like we read in this
[1:30:59] quote they can see Christ walking on
[1:31:01] Earth again they can hear Christ talking
[1:31:04] through us
[1:31:06] and it's not a a boastful thing it's
[1:31:08] wonderful to think that someone would
[1:31:10] want to phone you and say could you
[1:31:11] please pray for the situation and and
[1:31:13] what an honor and a privilege it is to
[1:31:15] be able to go on our knees and say yes
[1:31:17] we certainly will because we know
[1:31:20] the Living God
[1:31:23] we know him
[1:31:24] he's a friend
[1:31:27] let's stick closer than a brother what a
[1:31:29] tremendous thing that is that thought
[1:31:31] alone is just amazing
[1:31:34] making Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:31:36] today and forever how important it is to
[1:31:39] understand that I don't know how many
[1:31:41] times the prophet said that Jesus Christ
[1:31:43] the same yesterday today and forever not
[1:31:45] taking God and making him a historical
[1:31:47] account and putting him off out into the
[1:31:49] future and ignoring what he's doing
[1:31:51] right now but accepting him as the
[1:31:53] present tense I am
[1:31:55] to think that that is the answer that
[1:31:58] God gave Moses when Moses said who
[1:32:00] should I tell him who sent me
[1:32:03] tell him I am
[1:32:06] I am
[1:32:09] and you know for myself that uh
[1:32:12] that just Rings true because
[1:32:14] I remember having a conversation with
[1:32:16] myself one time I do it quite often and
[1:32:19] one day maybe they'll lock me up for it
[1:32:21] but I just remember having a
[1:32:23] conversation with myself and I believe
[1:32:24] it was with God and with Satan and and
[1:32:27] Satan was saying to me you know who said
[1:32:29] you are a son of God and and I I just
[1:32:33] heard that voice it spoke inside my
[1:32:35] heart and said I am said I am and you
[1:32:37] know brothers and sisters when we start
[1:32:39] to get those Revelations those little
[1:32:41] things in our lives it just does
[1:32:43] something for us it takes us to another
[1:32:46] level and it gives us the ability to
[1:32:48] Just Want To Praise them we can't keep
[1:32:50] quiet when we hear the word we just say
[1:32:52] be it unto me according to Thy Word
[1:32:56] and you know
[1:32:58] we can say that be it unto me according
[1:33:00] to Thy Word with one word just amen
[1:33:04] so be it
[1:33:05] I hear the word of God coming forward so
[1:33:07] be it
[1:33:09] be it unto me
[1:33:10] so be it
[1:33:13] brother Adam goes on to say oh notice
[1:33:14] the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of
[1:33:19] the divine revelation of Christ
[1:33:23] imagine that brothers and sisters not a
[1:33:25] holy Roman Catholic priest
[1:33:28] not a geographical location
[1:33:30] somewhere in the United States out in
[1:33:33] Arizona
[1:33:34] I've often thought it'd sure be neat to
[1:33:36] go up into that box canyon
[1:33:38] maybe go up on the sunset Mountain
[1:33:41] go and try and pick a couple bird off a
[1:33:44] my trouser leg and and just be close in
[1:33:48] a situation where the prophet of God was
[1:33:50] it doesn't matter anymore
[1:33:52] it's not going to do anything for us
[1:33:54] there's no geographical location
[1:33:57] the only thing brothers and sisters he
[1:34:00] says it here the Holy Ghost is the only
[1:34:02] revealer of the divine revelation of
[1:34:05] Christ
[1:34:06] and what is that we've read that
[1:34:08] scripture quite frequently recently
[1:34:10] Christ in you
[1:34:12] the hope of glory the mystery that's
[1:34:15] been hid from all the ages but is made
[1:34:18] known now unto you Christ in you the
[1:34:23] hope of glory
[1:34:24] the only the only revealer of the divine
[1:34:28] revelation of Christ he says there's no
[1:34:30] school can do it no scholar can do it no
[1:34:33] man
[1:34:35] how well educated or how Godly or
[1:34:37] anything else
[1:34:38] there's no man can do it
[1:34:40] [Laughter]
[1:34:42] oh my I just think it's so good because
[1:34:45] I am truly ignorant and unlearned and I
[1:34:48] know some people don't like that but
[1:34:50] it's not up to me
[1:34:52] it's it's up to the lord it's just the
[1:34:54] way it is
[1:34:55] he can I guess take me and use me for
[1:34:57] his glory
[1:35:00] goes on to say I could I could sting
[1:35:02] hard here
[1:35:03] the people that know this message know
[1:35:05] where I'm going with this
[1:35:07] says how many Christians Born Again
[1:35:09] raise up your hands filled with the Holy
[1:35:11] Ghost all right here we go then
[1:35:14] all right notice
[1:35:16] and he will only do it to the
[1:35:19] predestinated that's exactly
[1:35:23] all the father has given me will come
[1:35:25] and no man can come except the father
[1:35:28] give him to me first
[1:35:31] just to think about that
[1:35:33] he says that anyone who has the Holy
[1:35:36] Ghost
[1:35:37] anyone who has the ability to say I've
[1:35:40] got the Holy Ghost filled with the Holy
[1:35:41] Ghost I'm a Christian Save Tonight with
[1:35:43] the Holy Ghost it's only because they
[1:35:46] first were chosen to be those people
[1:35:48] not because they came to church one
[1:35:50] night and said I choose
[1:35:52] it's because they were chosen to choose
[1:35:56] it's kind of difficult to understand
[1:35:58] with our minds but it's truth
[1:36:01] some people would say that means that
[1:36:03] you don't have a choice in this world
[1:36:04] you do have a choice in this world we
[1:36:06] have the ability to make choices and
[1:36:08] some of the choices that we make will
[1:36:10] make our lives very easy and some of the
[1:36:12] choices will make our lives very
[1:36:14] difficult but we will always make the
[1:36:16] right choice
[1:36:18] he will always see his word come to pass
[1:36:20] in our lives if we have been chosen in
[1:36:21] him before the foundation of the world
[1:36:25] that's that's just no question
[1:36:27] but I just love you know in Ephesians
[1:36:30] chapter 5 he says in verse 26 that he
[1:36:32] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:36:35] washing of the Water by the word
[1:36:38] not a minister
[1:36:40] not a pastor not an evangelist
[1:36:43] nobody else
[1:36:45] that he might sanctify it with the
[1:36:47] cleansing of the washing by the water
[1:36:48] the word that he might present it to
[1:36:51] himself
[1:36:53] a glorious church not having spot or
[1:36:56] wrinkle or any such thing
[1:36:58] but that it should be holy and without
[1:37:00] blemish can you imagine if we were to
[1:37:03] look at one another like that
[1:37:05] look at our brothers and look at our
[1:37:07] sisters and and just say that you are
[1:37:09] holy you're without spot you're without
[1:37:11] blemish
[1:37:13] not get caught up in the veil stumble at
[1:37:16] the Veil
[1:37:17] but to look at it and think that that
[1:37:19] person that we're talking to our brother
[1:37:21] and our sister are are our mother our
[1:37:24] father our our
[1:37:27] aunt or our uncle the people who we love
[1:37:29] who are believers in our lives the
[1:37:32] people that we rub shoulders with in
[1:37:34] church if we could just see them without
[1:37:36] spot or without wrinkle you know we
[1:37:39] don't really have the ability to do that
[1:37:42] but God does
[1:37:44] God only sees us the way that he made us
[1:37:46] and he hears our voice he doesn't look
[1:37:49] at our faults and our failures and try
[1:37:51] to drag us through the mud that's
[1:37:52] Satan's job Satan does that he doesn't
[1:37:55] do that God doesn't do that at all he
[1:37:58] just wants to bless us
[1:38:00] he just looks at us the way he made us
[1:38:04] brother says look at them pre-saying
[1:38:06] this man's Beelzebub he's a fortune
[1:38:08] teller he's a devil
[1:38:12] and the story of the little woman at the
[1:38:14] well
[1:38:16] he had one thing that he needed to do
[1:38:20] by the way of Samaria just one thing
[1:38:22] that he needed to do and his disciples
[1:38:24] are probably upset saying why do we got
[1:38:26] to go all the way over there why why he
[1:38:28] dragging us around one thing he needed
[1:38:31] to do was tell one person brother
[1:38:32] Bradham says you take
[1:38:37] ones one man is all it takes and here he
[1:38:41] goes on to say in that little old woman
[1:38:43] walking around there living with six
[1:38:45] husbands she was living with five and
[1:38:47] had the sixth one then Jesus said go get
[1:38:50] your husband and come here
[1:38:52] she said I have no husband said yes
[1:38:55] you've got six you've had five and the
[1:38:57] one you're living with now is not your
[1:38:59] husband
[1:39:00] can you imagine that
[1:39:02] that woman in that state
[1:39:04] how how terrible she must have felt
[1:39:08] in her heart to know that she had just
[1:39:10] completely lost everything that there
[1:39:12] was no hope uh about having the dreams
[1:39:15] that a woman might have a virtuous woman
[1:39:17] they were all gone
[1:39:20] and here she finds herself talking to
[1:39:23] the one
[1:39:24] that she was taught would come
[1:39:27] she had something in her to be able to
[1:39:29] receive that word when it came to her
[1:39:31] and note that she didn't come to the
[1:39:34] word
[1:39:36] the word came to her
[1:39:39] that that's just incredible it's just
[1:39:42] incredible she said I have no husband
[1:39:44] said yes you've got six you had five and
[1:39:46] the one you're living with now is not
[1:39:47] your husband she said sir what that that
[1:39:50] light struck that seed
[1:39:53] when it struck them priests they said
[1:39:55] this man's a fortune teller
[1:39:57] see no life there hybrid
[1:40:00] they come up as far as organizations but
[1:40:03] died from there on
[1:40:05] to thank brothers and sisters
[1:40:08] we have been called unto this word for
[1:40:11] our day
[1:40:12] predestinated to be able to hear it
[1:40:16] to my way of thinking
[1:40:18] it just makes worship so easy
[1:40:21] it just makes the desire to go to church
[1:40:23] so easy
[1:40:25] he said my my yoke is easy and my burden
[1:40:28] is light
[1:40:30] I remember thinking when I was a junior
[1:40:32] Christian I'll call it you know Sunday
[1:40:34] night services were tough
[1:40:36] they were
[1:40:38] but it was just the place that I was out
[1:40:40] in my life I wasn't really ready to take
[1:40:43] that next step and you know it's the old
[1:40:45] man dying out is what it is
[1:40:49] but we all have to grow and go at our
[1:40:52] own pace nobody wants to put any
[1:40:55] pressure on anybody and say it should be
[1:40:57] one way or the other way just just get
[1:40:59] the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters
[1:41:01] that's the only thing I want to put
[1:41:02] pressure on I just want to emphasize
[1:41:04] that with all my might to all the people
[1:41:07] who hear me who can hear my voice the
[1:41:09] children and adults alike just get the
[1:41:11] Holy Ghost that's the only ticket out of
[1:41:13] here it's the only thing that will
[1:41:15] separate us from the rest of this world
[1:41:16] it's the only thing that will give us
[1:41:18] the ability to tell the difference
[1:41:20] between truth and error outside of the
[1:41:23] Holy Ghost In Our Lives the true baptism
[1:41:25] of the Holy Ghost we are lost as lost
[1:41:27] can be
[1:41:29] the Rapture will go one day and and
[1:41:31] we'll be wondering wasn't something
[1:41:33] supposed to happen weren't we supposed
[1:41:34] to do something or go somewhere or
[1:41:36] someone's supposed to be here or
[1:41:37] whatever that's what will happen
[1:41:40] we need to come to church brothers and
[1:41:42] sisters and get Washed by the washing
[1:41:44] by the water of the word
[1:41:46] so that he can present it to himself
[1:41:52] not presented to a church
[1:41:55] we don't want to take anybody and say
[1:41:56] they've gone through the the many stages
[1:41:58] the courses of Calgary Living Word
[1:42:00] assembly and now they get a badge no we
[1:42:03] want to get people to Christ
[1:42:05] get people to the Holy Ghost get the
[1:42:07] Holy Ghost in our lives and we'll never
[1:42:10] ever ever be the same
[1:42:15] you know I'm probably just gonna wrap it
[1:42:17] up soon here
[1:42:18] I'll just call the musicians
[1:42:21] but to think that he wants to call a
[1:42:23] glorious Church
[1:42:24] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:42:27] thing nothing defiled in her in his wife
[1:42:33] nothing out of order
[1:42:36] but that it should be holy and without
[1:42:38] blemish
[1:42:39] I just read this this verse here maybe
[1:42:42] stand with me tonight as we close I just
[1:42:44] read this verse here and I think about
[1:42:46] the quote that brother Bradham says
[1:42:48] where he says when the church
[1:42:51] recognizes what it is
[1:42:55] then the Rapture will go
[1:42:57] you read this verse here
[1:43:00] that he might present it to himself a
[1:43:02] glorious Church
[1:43:04] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:43:06] thing but that it
[1:43:09] should be holy
[1:43:11] and without blemish
[1:43:14] perfect
[1:43:15] without blemish to me that's just
[1:43:18] tremendous you take that quote and this
[1:43:20] verse here my goodness
[1:43:22] when we can look at ourselves and say
[1:43:24] you know I I I don't feel it
[1:43:27] how many people feel saved
[1:43:29] sometimes we feel safe sometimes we're
[1:43:31] on top of the mountain sometimes we just
[1:43:33] have God's hand moving our lives in such
[1:43:36] a mighty way and we can just Rejoice but
[1:43:38] that doesn't change God's approval in
[1:43:40] our lives just because we're in a in a
[1:43:43] valley low or a mountain high it doesn't
[1:43:45] change God's word one iota not one iota
[1:43:48] not nor does it change his love for us
[1:43:51] we don't want to let the circumstances
[1:43:53] in our lives dictate our our love for
[1:43:56] the father or or allow us to feel his
[1:43:59] love for us
[1:44:01] if we're his child then we we are his
[1:44:04] child that's it
[1:44:06] but that should be holy and without
[1:44:08] blemish let's just bow
[1:44:10] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:44:13] we're so thankful that you have chosen a
[1:44:15] church that you have picked a bride Lord
[1:44:19] Jesus that you have predestinated a
