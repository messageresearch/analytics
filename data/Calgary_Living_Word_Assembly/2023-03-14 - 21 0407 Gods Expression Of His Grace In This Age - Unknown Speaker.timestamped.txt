[28:04] according to thy will according to Thy
[28:07] word so that your life can come to pass
[28:09] inside us father
[28:12] Lord we just ask that you would bless
[28:13] our little service tonight in a real
[28:15] special way father we pray that if
[28:17] there's any prayer requests tonight
[28:19] father that you would just meet them
[28:20] sovereignly according to the needs in
[28:23] your children
[28:24] we want to remember Sister Grace's
[28:26] sister father we thank you for bringing
[28:28] her through to a recovery
[28:30] Lord we could pray that you would just
[28:32] continue watching over her Lord
[28:35] pray that you would just bring her to a
[28:36] full restoration
[28:38] we pray that you would be with
[28:40] sister Grace's mom who has it
[28:43] pray that you would just have mercy upon
[28:45] her father that you would just allow her
[28:47] Lord Jesus to not suffer through it Lord
[28:50] that you would just bring her through it
[28:52] swiftly we pray that you would watch
[28:54] over her dad
[28:55] as well father who doesn't have it we
[28:58] just thank you for your tender hand of
[29:00] Mercy in our lives Lord and the many
[29:03] other countless people that we know
[29:04] father who have been affected by this
[29:06] plague by this virus Lord we pray that
[29:09] you would just be with the families that
[29:11] you would just minister to those whose
[29:13] hearts are broken father those people
[29:16] maybe who have lost loved ones Lord we
[29:18] pray that you would just watch over
[29:19] those people who maybe are unsure father
[29:22] whether they should take a virus
[29:24] vaccine Lord Jesus we pray that you
[29:27] would be with those who have taken the
[29:29] vaccine Lord we pray that you would be
[29:31] with those who have been sick with the
[29:33] disease father Lord we're in a time of
[29:35] of real confusion but we know just like
[29:38] in the wilderness that you told Moses to
[29:41] create a brass Serpent and if the people
[29:43] would look upon that serpent that they
[29:45] would live even if they are bit so
[29:48] tonight father I pray that we could just
[29:50] look upon that serpent that we wouldn't
[29:52] look to men that we wouldn't look to
[29:54] science but that we would look to the
[29:56] almighty God the author and the finisher
[29:58] of our faith Lord that's what we desire
[30:00] tonight Lord Jesus is more of you and
[30:03] less of us less of this world less of
[30:05] mankind but more of you father because
[30:08] we know that the dimensions are blending
[30:10] that just any day now something real
[30:13] special is going to happen father and we
[30:16] just want to be found with oil in our
[30:18] lamps we know that's the only thing
[30:20] that's going to save us Lord we just
[30:22] love you father we pray that you would
[30:24] just sovereignly speak to us Lord as we
[30:26] commit this service into your hands
[30:28] tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[30:30] amen
[30:33] Hallelujah God bless you musicians
[30:36] thank you so much once again for
[30:38] bringing your gifts
[30:41] to the house of the Lord
[30:43] I trust everyone is having a good day if
[30:47] you have your Bibles tonight I just
[30:49] can't get out of First Corinthians
[30:52] chapter 13 so we'll just trust the Lord
[30:54] we'll bless it
[30:56] then I'd like to turn over to Hebrews
[30:58] chapter 6.
[31:00] First Corinthians chapter 13.
[31:03] Hebrews chapter 6.
[31:13] tonight I'll be talking a little bit out
[31:16] of the message what is the attraction on
[31:19] the mount
[31:20] of 1965
[31:24] so in First Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse
[31:28] 9
[31:30] um
[31:31] we know in part for we know in part and
[31:34] we prophesy in part but when that which
[31:36] is perfect is come then that
[31:39] which is in part shall be done away
[31:42] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[31:45] understood as a child I thought as a
[31:46] child but when I became a man I put away
[31:49] childish things
[31:51] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[31:54] but then face to face
[31:56] for now I know in part but then
[31:59] shall I know even
[32:01] as also I am known
[32:06] let's turn over to Hebrews
[32:09] chapter 6.
[32:14] in parallel or in conjunction or in
[32:17] course with verse 10.
[32:20] Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1.
[32:23] therefore leaving the principles of the
[32:25] doctrine of Christ
[32:28] let us go on to perfection
[32:31] not laying again the foundation of
[32:33] repentance from dead works of Faith
[32:34] toward God
[32:36] of the doctrine of baptisms and of
[32:38] laying on of hands and of resurrection
[32:41] of the Dead
[32:42] and eternal judgment and this will we do
[32:47] if God permit
[32:48] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[32:51] Heavenly Father we've spoken
[32:55] you're holy writ
[32:57] we pray Lord Jesus that you would just
[32:59] bless it that you would just open our
[33:00] eyes of understanding
[33:02] that you would just give us ears to hear
[33:04] what the spirit saith unto the church
[33:06] not tomorrow
[33:07] not yesterday but today
[33:10] right now tonight father we pray that
[33:13] you would just give us a fresh portion
[33:15] Lord Jesus that it would be fresh Manna
[33:18] Lord God that it would just be a fresh
[33:20] bloody sacrifice to us once again that
[33:23] we would just be able to see that that
[33:25] that that that lion that John turned to
[33:28] sea but he saw a bloody lamb father we
[33:31] pray that tonight this would be one more
[33:33] Living Sacrifice to us father that would
[33:35] just nourish our spiritual bodies father
[33:38] we just ask that you would just take
[33:40] control of this service now in the name
[33:42] of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless
[33:46] you tonight you may be seated
[33:53] in Hebrews chapter 4 verse 16 let us
[33:57] therefore come boldly unto the throne of
[33:59] grace that we may obtain mercy and find
[34:03] Grace
[34:04] to help in a time of need
[34:07] when have we ever had such a time of
[34:09] need
[34:10] as we do now
[34:12] we were just talking about it how
[34:15] in in 9 11
[34:18] and uh just it's interesting I just find
[34:21] this fascinating in 9 11 there was so
[34:23] much
[34:24] broadcast of the blood and the fire and
[34:28] the carnality the Carnage The the pain
[34:32] the suffering the images that were
[34:34] presented to the world all over the
[34:36] place and everybody had such a desire to
[34:39] get back to God to to find a way to be
[34:43] saved and and here we have a global
[34:46] pandemic where people are
[34:49] supposedly dying in such great numbers
[34:51] and all of the stuff that's happening
[34:53] according to what's what this virus is
[34:56] but there's way less desire for God
[34:59] there's way less attraction to the mount
[35:03] and uh
[35:05] there's still a few people though that
[35:08] have that desire
[35:10] and I just want to underscore that point
[35:13] that if we have that desire
[35:15] we are blessed above all
[35:18] it's not elitism
[35:20] even though it truly is because not
[35:22] everyone has the desire
[35:24] and if we have the desire it is the
[35:27] greatest thing that we could ever ever
[35:28] ever ever achieve there's nothing
[35:31] greater in this world or the world to
[35:34] come that we could achieve than to have
[35:35] the desire to actually hear the word for
[35:38] our day
[35:40] brother Toby he he preached the message
[35:43] when he spoke last time the expression
[35:45] of God's grace Through the Ages and I
[35:47] just can't get away from that thought
[35:48] either and brothers and sisters that's
[35:51] what we're here to talk about tonight is
[35:52] God's expression
[35:54] of his grace in this age
[35:58] we can look at the age to come and we
[36:00] can look at the age behind but what good
[36:02] are they if we don't experience that
[36:04] Grace today
[36:06] and it needs to be today
[36:08] forget about tomorrow and forget about
[36:10] yesterday because neither one of them
[36:12] matter in the moment right now
[36:14] well we have our our breath in our lungs
[36:17] and our eyes are open and our our
[36:18] cognitive thinking is happening our
[36:20] reasoning we have the devil continually
[36:22] bombarding us with thoughts and thoughts
[36:25] and thoughts and ideas and thoughts and
[36:27] it's bombarding us with it
[36:30] we know that brother Branham said the
[36:32] lid was taken off of hell
[36:35] and they're not interested so much in
[36:38] all of the mainstream Christianity
[36:40] because they don't have oil
[36:43] there's an anointing
[36:45] hmm but if you think about it you have
[36:48] all the guns of Hell trained on you if
[36:51] you have the ability to hear
[36:53] this is no time
[36:56] to get lazy this is no time to get tired
[37:00] this is the time to press in
[37:02] you know how the world says it when the
[37:04] going gets tough the tough gets going
[37:06] it's all all these things are based on
[37:09] scriptural principles
[37:11] when the going gets tough It's Time to
[37:13] knuckle down and know what God we serve
[37:16] not be wondering not not not flailing
[37:20] back and forth kind of in kind of out I
[37:22] can't go and serve God according to the
[37:25] message of the hour because someone did
[37:27] something to me sometime or some
[37:29] somebody did something to my parents
[37:31] somewhere along the way what does that
[37:33] have to do with our our own experience
[37:35] with the Lord Jesus Christ he's not
[37:37] going to say to us if we stand Before
[37:39] the Throne if we do he's not going to
[37:42] say oh did that person offend you that's
[37:44] why you're there
[37:45] you know I gave you Grace and he's gonna
[37:48] I've got to be concerned about that he's
[37:49] going to say did you take the provided
[37:51] way that I gave you for the age in which
[37:53] you lived
[37:54] and that way for us it's not a boat
[37:58] it's not a boat
[38:00] it's a body change
[38:02] it's understanding that whether we live
[38:04] or we die we get a body change
[38:08] someone has to do it
[38:10] someone has to be there to be the
[38:12] recipient
[38:14] I just want to talk about us tonight
[38:18] and and Who We Are
[38:20] once again just another another mix of
[38:24] the leftovers that we've probably heard
[38:26] a hundred thousand times but you know he
[38:28] has a way of making it fresh we were
[38:30] talking about it again just something
[38:32] else quick conversations how profound
[38:34] they are when Brothers poor from vessel
[38:37] to vessel sisters Fellowship around the
[38:39] world you know the messages these same
[38:41] messages that were being preached years
[38:43] ago they weren't being preached the way
[38:46] they are today
[38:47] it's a further anointing
[38:49] as that Capstone comes down we sang that
[38:53] song it's manifesting time what are we
[38:55] manifesting we're manifesting him
[39:00] if we were to read that that scripture
[39:02] is it the Song of Solomon I think it is
[39:05] how how his beloved is there and and
[39:09] he's just catching glimpses of him here
[39:11] and there it's almost like and
[39:13] throughout the ages it's been that way
[39:15] to all the saints but brothers and
[39:17] sisters we are standing here today face
[39:20] to face
[39:22] full Revelation the entire word opened
[39:26] before us if we believe Revelations 10 7
[39:29] and that book is open and it's on earth
[39:32] now it's not coming in the future
[39:35] but it's Satan's job to take and make
[39:38] millions and billions of people think
[39:40] that it's coming in the future that's
[39:42] happening in some future age that's why
[39:44] I can't get away from it I probably
[39:45] won't for a long time just like I harped
[39:48] on the Holy Ghost now I'm going to
[39:49] intertwine the Holy Ghost with the cloud
[39:51] because if we realize what that cloud is
[39:53] it's not just some event it's not God
[39:55] just vindicating his man saying you know
[39:58] this guy was a good guy this is my man
[40:00] if you you just hear him you'll be saved
[40:03] and and truly if you do you will be
[40:06] but something really really significant
[40:09] happened in 1963 If people could catch
[40:12] that Revelation that the coming of the
[40:13] Lord is here right now that it's
[40:16] happened that it's not some crazy
[40:17] whacked out perusia doctrine that it's
[40:20] us for and no more no it's a doctrine of
[40:23] a devil if we could understand that that
[40:25] Grace is actually standing on Earth
[40:28] today what would we be doing
[40:31] we think about those days about when
[40:34] maybe we'll start to see loved ones
[40:37] brothers and sisters I I just want to
[40:40] say this I just feel inspired to say
[40:41] this if we if we think we're going to
[40:44] see loved ones then and and things will
[40:47] be good it's going to be too late then
[40:50] we have got to be ready to see loved
[40:52] ones today
[40:54] we have to make sure that we have oil in
[40:56] our lap today
[40:57] because we know that all all ten of them
[41:00] were virgins
[41:02] right the story of the ten virgins
[41:04] they're all virgins and they all had
[41:06] lamps
[41:07] the only difference is five of them had
[41:09] oil and five of them did not have oil
[41:11] and the five that didn't have oil they
[41:15] asked give us some oil
[41:17] it's time we know the bridegroom cometh
[41:20] we've heard the shout too
[41:22] but what did the five wise virgins say
[41:25] they said sorry we just have enough for
[41:27] us I can't give you two you got to go
[41:28] buy it yourself go find it and while
[41:30] they went searching for that oil
[41:34] the bridegroom came and he closed the
[41:36] door he closed the door not the brides
[41:39] not not not not the five wise virgins
[41:42] they just went in where they were called
[41:44] to go in because they had the oil in
[41:45] their lamps they were ready
[41:48] while the others were searching so if we
[41:50] want to put that in a timeline think
[41:51] about it the shouts happened the
[41:54] bridegroom cometh behold stand and trim
[41:56] your lamps that's already happened in
[41:58] our lifetime maybe not in our lifetime
[42:00] maybe before our lifetime
[42:03] the bridegroom cometh the bridegroom is
[42:05] here if
[42:07] sunset Mountain was truly the coming of
[42:09] the Lord
[42:10] right
[42:12] have we got oil in our Labs brothers and
[42:14] sisters that door is going to close any
[42:16] day now
[42:17] when that door closes it's too late
[42:21] that's totally
[42:23] inspired for right now that's completely
[42:25] not in my notes that's bizarre praise
[42:27] the Lord
[42:28] out of what is the attraction
[42:31] 1965-0725e
[42:36] he says to speak a word
[42:39] is a man
[42:42] confirm a word is God
[42:46] to say something is one thing
[42:49] God to do it is another
[42:52] it's like a proverb for our age hey it
[42:56] just it just struck me it was so
[42:59] profound for me to hear that to speak a
[43:02] word is a man confirm a word is God
[43:07] to say something is one thing God to do
[43:10] it is another thing
[43:13] God don't need any interpreter
[43:16] I just love this quote
[43:18] he does his own interpretation
[43:21] and we know how he does his own
[43:23] interpretation
[43:24] according to the prophet of Malachi 4 of
[43:27] Revelations 10 7. he made it expressly
[43:29] clear how God interprets his own word
[43:32] isn't it amazing to think that we have
[43:34] that Revelation it's just something that
[43:36] we just have it's just part of who we
[43:37] are there might be people that are
[43:39] listening right now that don't know what
[43:40] that is and I'll say it what it is God
[43:43] interprets his own word by bringing it
[43:45] to pass
[43:46] but how is he going to bring it to pass
[43:48] if somebody doesn't speak it
[43:51] right there's got to be an inspiration
[43:54] from somewhere from the inside of the
[43:56] inside that just speaks the word
[43:59] not cry
[44:01] we know in Moses day he said to him why
[44:03] cry why are you crying to me you can see
[44:06] that I delivered you you saw the plagues
[44:08] you saw everything that's happened I
[44:10] raised you up to be a delivery you saw
[44:11] the burning bush all these different
[44:13] things you came out of out of Egypt and
[44:16] and you went on the back side of the
[44:17] desert all of your life and now here you
[44:20] are and you're crying
[44:22] you've got that stick in your hand
[44:25] speak the word and go forwards brothers
[44:27] and sisters I believe that somehow
[44:30] somewhere along the way it almost comes
[44:32] to the place where it just becomes
[44:33] common to us where we're just
[44:36] lackadaisical where it's just we just
[44:38] hope that we'll hear from God someday
[44:40] that maybe somehow some way he'll just
[44:42] make himself more real to us I'm talking
[44:45] about myself here maybe he'll just
[44:47] Express himself in a greater way he's
[44:49] expressed himself the greatest way that
[44:51] he can the way that he's chosen through
[44:53] a prophet of our day we've taken the
[44:55] message of the hour we have the fullness
[44:57] of the word he's waiting for us to just
[44:59] speak the word Mark 16 in action that's
[45:03] the true church somewhere and all I want
[45:06] to do is try and encourage us to just
[45:08] have that kind of Faith to have that
[45:10] kind of encouragement to not listen to
[45:12] the devil when you get that idea when
[45:13] something comes up in your life where
[45:15] you want to say Satan I rebuke you in
[45:17] the name of Jesus you're a trespassing
[45:18] devil and you have no Authority get lost
[45:21] when we have that rise up inside us and
[45:24] we need to speak those words maybe we'll
[45:26] just think them because he'll come and
[45:27] sit on our shoulder he'll get all the
[45:29] Devils around us quickly jump on them
[45:30] don't get them to speak those words get
[45:32] them to doubt doubt doubt because if he
[45:35] doubts he won't speak the words and then
[45:36] we'll have power we'll stay
[45:38] brothers and sisters we need to speak
[45:40] the word we need to have boldness right
[45:42] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[45:44] throne not afraid to come unto the
[45:46] throne but boldly unto the throne how do
[45:48] we come unto the throne we speak the
[45:50] word
[45:52] the word says that he's got Watchers
[45:54] right
[45:56] on Earth
[45:58] going to and fro in the earth seeing
[46:00] what's up
[46:01] what are we doing what are we saying
[46:03] bringing the report back remember the
[46:05] story of adoption the tutor is bringing
[46:08] a report to the father
[46:10] we have a father and he knows our name
[46:13] he's taking a report back to the father
[46:15] he's waiting to hear what we're going to
[46:17] say
[46:18] I've said it many times in the past
[46:20] little while but I'll say it again in
[46:22] this context you know how Jesus asked
[46:24] the disciples what's everyone out there
[46:25] saying about us what is he saying what
[46:27] are they saying about me some said
[46:29] you're Elias you're the prophet you know
[46:30] Jeremiah someone along the way but okay
[46:34] that's fine but what do you say who do
[46:36] you say that I am and that's really
[46:37] where it's come down to today brothers
[46:39] and sisters who do we say he is
[46:44] when we sing that song I'm so glad that
[46:48] I can say I'm one of them
[46:50] do we understand what that means
[46:53] I think that Revelation is starting to
[46:55] break
[46:56] because when that time comes when that
[46:58] Revelation breaks we're not going to
[47:00] sing that song I'm so glad that I can
[47:03] say I'm one of them it's not going to be
[47:07] like that we'll be jumping up and down
[47:08] because we're one of those redeemed
[47:10] people one that he chose from before the
[47:13] foundation of the world where all of
[47:15] heaven will be silent to listen to what
[47:18] it sounds like for redeemed sons of God
[47:20] to sing
[47:22] Hallelujah and you know what every age
[47:26] has a revelation every age has a portion
[47:30] of the word that's given and as we go
[47:32] forwards brothers and sisters I just
[47:34] believe that this Revelation is just
[47:35] unfolding a little further it's just
[47:37] unfolding a little further it's the same
[47:38] word the same Revelation the same
[47:40] message I'm not saying that I've got
[47:42] anything greater I'm saying that I just
[47:44] believe we need to encourage ourselves
[47:46] to just go a little higher to just go a
[47:48] little further to realize our authority
[47:50] to not get slapped around by the devil
[47:52] think about how strong Satan is getting
[47:55] in this day in this age and I think that
[47:57] might be part of it that just wears upon
[48:00] us as as as the Sons and Daughters of
[48:02] God we look at how how how powerful
[48:04] Satan is look at it's his Eden where do
[48:07] we even fit we don't fit we are not
[48:09] citizens of this Kingdom we're the bride
[48:12] that's being taken out of Satan's Eden
[48:14] but you know what as Satan grows in
[48:15] power so does the Bride of Jesus Christ
[48:17] and he's just waiting for us to exercise
[48:19] our Authority
[48:22] he's given us the full open word if we
[48:25] have access to the throne of mercy and
[48:28] Grace then what are we doing we don't
[48:30] need to be afraid we don't need to be
[48:31] afraid of Satan
[48:34] you know the word says Paul said to the
[48:36] Corinthians for we know him pardon we
[48:38] prophesy in part and that happened for
[48:40] years throughout all the ages they knew
[48:42] in part and they prophesied in part
[48:44] right but verse 10 but when that which
[48:47] is perfect is come there was coming a
[48:49] day where there's going to be a
[48:50] Perfection that comes where that
[48:52] Perfection comes then that which is in
[48:54] part will just be set aside because we
[48:56] don't need that part anymore we've got
[48:58] everything we need and it's like the
[49:00] Pentecostals right they want that that
[49:03] that part they want all of the gifts
[49:06] they're not realizing that Perfection
[49:07] has truly come that that the the the
[49:10] speaking in tongues the initial evidence
[49:12] all the gifts who cares about all the
[49:15] gifts they come they'll follow the camel
[49:17] train will follow with all the gifts
[49:19] behind us as we go to The Giver all we
[49:22] need is the giver and we'll have all the
[49:23] gifts
[49:25] but it's Satan's trick to try and keep
[49:27] us down keep us burdened thinking that
[49:29] we need to look for some little tiny
[49:31] piece some little tiny Park but verse 10
[49:34] says but that when that which is perfect
[49:36] is come then that which is in part shall
[49:38] be done away because when I was a child
[49:40] I spake as a child when I when I was a
[49:42] message believer I came in and I was a
[49:44] child I had childlike faith and I I
[49:47] thought I understood what the word was I
[49:49] I understood as a child and I thought as
[49:52] a child excuse me I even spake as a
[49:54] child and I understood as a child I
[49:57] think you know many times some of the
[49:58] conversations that I must have had with
[49:59] brother Ken he was he was patient and he
[50:02] would just laugh when I would say things
[50:03] he had a he had a real kind chuckle and
[50:06] he would just laugh when some of the
[50:08] things I would say and I'm sure that he
[50:10] was thinking about this this verse here
[50:12] when I was a child I spake as a child he
[50:14] probably thought that too when he was
[50:16] young we probably have experienced that
[50:17] in our own lives we think back on things
[50:19] and think man I actually thought that
[50:21] way about the word but you know brothers
[50:23] and sisters we're not children anymore
[50:24] we are full adults we're mature adults
[50:28] we're not dealing with skim milk we're
[50:30] not dealing with milk as babes we're
[50:32] dealing with strong meat in our day the
[50:34] fullness of the word being opened the
[50:36] the thing that all of the all of the
[50:38] brothers and sisters from all of the
[50:41] ages desired to look on and and see we
[50:44] just have it it's just common and I
[50:45] think because it's so common and so wide
[50:48] open we have all the technology to get
[50:50] to it it's just so easy it's too easy
[50:53] and we just get too distracted
[50:55] I find I do
[50:58] I can't believe it I have not even
[51:00] entered into notes wow
[51:04] every age has predestinated believers
[51:07] and you know there's just a desire
[51:10] in those Believers to just take in the
[51:12] message is what brother Branham says
[51:14] maybe not exactly like that but just
[51:16] like that out of what is the attraction
[51:18] on the mount every age has Believers and
[51:22] in those Believers there's just a desire
[51:24] for that word and and nothing else will
[51:26] satisfy
[51:28] we can try different things in our lives
[51:30] we can look different ways we can get
[51:32] distracted and and we always find out
[51:35] that that he'll allow us to go so far in
[51:38] whatever we're our thinking is about
[51:39] whatever our our desires are but he
[51:42] always brings us back
[51:45] to the center always and really what the
[51:48] center is is him
[51:50] he's not going to share his glory with
[51:51] anybody he doesn't care about our image
[51:53] he doesn't care about our skills he
[51:55] doesn't care about our money he doesn't
[51:57] care about what we can do humanly
[51:59] everything that we think we know is
[52:02] irrelevant he wants to have preeminence
[52:04] in his body and that's the only thing
[52:07] that he will accept but brothers and
[52:09] sisters when we can come to that place
[52:11] where we just give him all the glory all
[52:14] of the glory of our lives in in our
[52:16] careers any success we have in our
[52:18] career it's because of him
[52:20] right any success we have in our
[52:22] business it's because of him he is our
[52:24] marketing program any success we have
[52:26] financially is because of him any
[52:28] success we have in school is because of
[52:31] him any success we have in a marriage is
[52:33] only because of him any success in child
[52:36] rearing is because of him any success in
[52:39] service is because of him it's just his
[52:41] he has to be our entire Focus entire
[52:44] focus and we have to just push aside all
[52:46] the things in our lives I think we're
[52:48] just coming to a place where it's
[52:49] becoming absolutely urgent we need to
[52:52] understand this call this cry that's
[52:54] going out as the brothers preach this
[52:55] message of the hour in this age it's
[52:58] getting more and more urgent you know
[53:00] the bridegroom has come already and that
[53:02] door is about to close and when that
[53:03] door closes it's too late
[53:06] go search for oil go do what you want
[53:08] we'll knock on the door and say but Lord
[53:10] didn't we cast out devils in your name
[53:12] didn't we have great message meetings I
[53:15] was raised in the message let me in and
[53:17] you know what he'll say
[53:19] you had the opportunity
[53:21] you were shown the word you had a full
[53:23] message app on your phone but you choose
[53:25] to watch videos or you choose to do
[53:27] something else instead of look at that
[53:29] message that you had all of it all of it
[53:34] Lord help us
[53:35] just any day now that door is going to
[53:38] close
[53:39] but thanks be to God there are a certain
[53:42] select group of people that have the
[53:43] desire to just take it all to just take
[53:46] it all it's their absolute there's
[53:48] nothing more important to them than
[53:50] taking in the message of of their day
[53:52] you know the story of Martha and Mary
[53:56] Martha and Mary just a fine example you
[53:59] have two Believers right
[54:01] but one of them is busy with all the
[54:04] things in life all the busy with things
[54:05] in life got to go and do and get and fix
[54:07] and make and bake and do all the stuff
[54:09] and the other one just just has one
[54:11] desire one desire and that's to sit at
[54:13] the Master's feet just tell me more just
[54:16] tell me more just tell me more which one
[54:18] are we
[54:19] you know what Jesus said to to the
[54:22] sister when she was upset because the
[54:24] one wasn't helping you know I'm not
[54:26] going to be with you all the time just
[54:28] relax the things of this life they'll
[54:30] look after themselves I feel like many
[54:33] times we get way too caught up in the
[54:34] moment and by doing that it's just
[54:36] Satan's distraction he just allows us to
[54:39] get so far into that place where we just
[54:41] have to react now we have to move we
[54:44] can't not react
[54:45] and he just laughs
[54:48] but God will give us a way of Escape he
[54:50] always does and and boy when we get that
[54:53] Revelation in our life
[54:55] I've heard a brother speaking about it
[54:57] recently that you know what we'll move
[54:59] our home
[55:01] will sell
[55:03] all that we got
[55:05] we'll throw our business away
[55:07] we'll forget about our careers
[55:10] we'll do everything that we can to make
[55:12] sure that our family comes together and
[55:14] we serve God with all of our might
[55:17] there's nothing in this world that's
[55:19] worth missing out on that Rapture and if
[55:22] we are not careful
[55:24] things will drag us down and we'll be
[55:27] caught up in a situation where we'll
[55:29] miss out on the blessing for our day
[55:31] we don't want to be busy trying to make
[55:34] stuff happen
[55:35] we want to make sure that we're giving
[55:36] him the opportunity
[55:40] but you know in in the situation of
[55:41] Martha and Mary I just want to say this
[55:43] that it doesn't make one more religious
[55:44] than the other
[55:46] don't get me wrong if maybe that was
[55:49] interpreted
[55:51] you know what it is it's revelation
[55:54] it's Revelation that's what it is that's
[55:57] the difference they're both believers
[55:59] it's Revelation and Revelation is given
[56:01] by God
[56:03] it's not imparted by a brother or a
[56:05] pastor or a teacher it comes from God
[56:09] and and how do we get it we get it by
[56:11] prayer we get it by reading the word he
[56:13] reveals himself to whomsoever he will
[56:16] doesn't make any one or the other more
[56:19] religious what it does is it proves
[56:21] election
[56:23] it's God's choice
[56:24] and if we can choose that what it does
[56:26] is it humbles
[56:27] you can imagine that it doesn't make one
[56:30] more proud or boastful because I was
[56:32] sitting at the master oh my you know no
[56:35] not at all
[56:37] it makes one one the other to say my I
[56:40] wish that Revelation would be imparted
[56:42] there as well
[56:44] but it shows a level of revelation
[56:46] really is what that is what that story
[56:48] is doing a level of revelation we can
[56:51] just get so caught up in this world he
[56:53] can give us but we can get so caught up
[56:56] in this world that we just forget a
[56:57] little bit about that revelation we just
[56:58] get a little spiritual Harmony
[57:01] you know he gives us faith it takes
[57:04] Faith to get revelation we have to have
[57:06] faith to pick up our Bible and read we
[57:08] have to have faith that heal in part
[57:10] revelation
[57:11] we have to have faith that it will
[57:13] actually be us
[57:15] we hear about others and all the sisters
[57:17] maybe that are in prayer lines maybe
[57:19] great revivals happening in other
[57:22] people's lives but what about me
[57:25] it has to be a revelation about him for
[57:28] me but you know he'll give us his faith
[57:31] if we really want it because ending
[57:33] we've talked about it where where our
[57:35] faith ends human faith comes to if we
[57:39] actually get into the word and we
[57:40] actually get into the message of the
[57:42] hour which is Christ
[57:43] faith has got to come to an end but when
[57:45] that happens he'll give us a revelation
[57:47] and then he'll give Faith the revelation
[57:50] will be about the word the mystery of
[57:52] God being revealed but a faith that's
[57:56] his faith and then He blesses us with it
[58:00] he doesn't just give us Faith to say
[58:02] you've got great faith you could go and
[58:03] move mountains now Faith you could go in
[58:07] and cast mountains into the sea and and
[58:09] heal people from the dead like we talked
[58:13] about you know no it's not it's not
[58:15] about that
[58:16] it's about having his faith so that he
[58:18] will actually give us Revelation
[58:20] Revelation who we are Revelation about
[58:23] the word revelation that we've got the
[58:24] ability to come before the throne face
[58:27] that we have the ability to speak the
[58:29] word and go forwards that we can
[58:31] understand when creep into our lives
[58:33] creep into our homes get get in amongst
[58:36] our children and with our homes we have
[58:39] the ability to discern that
[58:43] go to God crying because of it
[58:46] he doesn't want us to do that he Punch
[58:49] Out the Devil right out of our house
[58:51] give the devil a black eye send him
[58:53] right now because that's where they
[58:55] belong
[58:56] hell was created for the devil and his
[58:58] angels not our homes
[59:01] not our families
[59:03] but he's going to try and make that
[59:05] that's the case
[59:07] but he gives us his faith and then once
[59:09] we have blesses us with it look at
[59:11] Abraham's life
[59:13] Abraham was given so many Revel given so
[59:16] much Faith great faith he staggered not
[59:19] at the promise of God through but was
[59:22] strong in faith
[59:25] giving God
[59:28] his faith gives us the ability
[59:32] forward his faith not ours his faith his
[59:36] words
[59:38] remember that quote that we read
[59:40] let's go back to it to speak a word and
[59:44] but to confirm a word
[59:46] that's God
[59:49] but how is God ever going to confirm his
[59:51] word if we don't speak it
[59:52] if we speak his word because we're
[59:54] afraid
[59:56] because maybe we look at something and
[59:58] say well so and so the word and they put
[1:00:00] their neck out there and they got shamed
[1:00:02] they got embarrassed because it doesn't
[1:00:04] actually did what they said
[1:00:06] but you know the word says in James that
[1:00:08] we ask of Miss
[1:00:10] if we have the spirit of God in us we
[1:00:12] won't ask amiss we won't ask consume it
[1:00:16] upon the lusts of our flesh the desires
[1:00:19] of this life will greater desire which
[1:00:22] will be his faith his actual life coming
[1:00:25] through us see us speaking the word
[1:00:28] brothers and sisters we say it over and
[1:00:30] over we're going to keep saying it the
[1:00:32] mind of Christ
[1:00:34] to know what to do with it
[1:00:37] sure the prophet for our day the one who
[1:00:39] who we don't worship but we follow
[1:00:42] because he opened the word to us God
[1:00:45] chose to express himself to us
[1:00:48] he said she has thus saith the Lord
[1:00:53] and the mind of Christ to know what to
[1:00:55] do with it
[1:00:58] and then she keeps still
[1:01:00] it's a really simple equation
[1:01:03] he's not he has it and then she doesn't
[1:01:06] have it no if she doesn't have it then
[1:01:08] she just doesn't say anything because
[1:01:11] she's afraid to speak it but brothers
[1:01:13] and sisters when we got the word in us
[1:01:14] that we're right with God we're not on
[1:01:17] the cycle of iniquity in our lives when
[1:01:19] we've done everything that we we can
[1:01:21] speak the word and allow him to confirm
[1:01:23] it
[1:01:25] we're not going to ask a miss
[1:01:28] and that's the thing that I think we
[1:01:30] just need to have and encouraged in our
[1:01:32] lives we're not going to ask you're not
[1:01:34] going to ask a mess if you've got the
[1:01:35] holy ghost in your life ask a myth
[1:01:38] and if you don't ask a Miss then it's
[1:01:41] actually not you speak speaking through
[1:01:43] you and when he speaks through you what
[1:01:45] happens
[1:01:45] [Laughter]
[1:01:48] you have the power to create a world and
[1:01:50] go and inhabit it but that would be
[1:01:52] asking it of your flesh because you
[1:01:54] don't need to do that but when a devil
[1:01:56] comes into your house and starts to flip
[1:01:58] financially or afflicting you physically
[1:02:01] or afflicting you mentally you have the
[1:02:03] rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus
[1:02:05] Christ that Authority is in us as of God
[1:02:10] full adoption
[1:02:12] you know that song we we
[1:02:14] went to adoption full Authority and
[1:02:17] power not part Authority and power for
[1:02:19] tea and power when we sing that song do
[1:02:23] we believe that song
[1:02:25] we have that in our hearts is it real to
[1:02:28] us or is it a traditional form of
[1:02:30] worship just who
[1:02:32] we have to come to that place brothers
[1:02:34] and sisters where this is more than just
[1:02:35] what we more than just what we
[1:02:37] Fellowship around it's got to be the
[1:02:39] very essence of our lives around us
[1:02:42] needs to see this our children need to
[1:02:45] see god with skin on
[1:02:48] remember that story brother Bradham
[1:02:50] tells about that little boy he's
[1:02:51] sleeping upstairs in a rickety old
[1:02:54] clapboard house and the storms going
[1:02:56] through and Mama tells them go upstairs
[1:02:57] and he says I can't I don't want to I'm
[1:03:00] scared he comes down time and time again
[1:03:02] and and don't worry son God is with you
[1:03:05] we believe we're Christians God is with
[1:03:07] you and he says mom just need god with
[1:03:10] skin on right now come upstairs with me
[1:03:12] we need to be as little the word says He
[1:03:15] said it to his disciples unless you come
[1:03:17] as a little child you won't even see God
[1:03:20] there's no puffed up in this room for us
[1:03:23] there's no great Revelation the point
[1:03:25] that that we have pride in our lives
[1:03:28] that original sin no way
[1:03:30] no way we've got to be willing to come
[1:03:32] as little children
[1:03:34] you've got to be willing to confess our
[1:03:35] father and pray for one another
[1:03:38] so that what
[1:03:41] healed
[1:03:43] who doesn't want to be healed here
[1:03:50] he gives us his faith
[1:03:52] and you know what there's an expression
[1:03:54] of God's grace throughout every single
[1:03:56] age
[1:03:58] and we can look back and see all the
[1:03:59] people who benefited from that and we
[1:04:01] can we can look back at the messages and
[1:04:04] hear the message the prayer lines even
[1:04:06] the prayer line at the end of what is
[1:04:07] the attraction just kind of where I'm at
[1:04:10] right now but you can hear these people
[1:04:12] who are the ex of God's grace that that
[1:04:16] that brother Shepard who is in the
[1:04:18] baptismal in the baptismal during that
[1:04:21] service so that he could give room for
[1:04:22] another person to be there and brother
[1:04:24] Burns this man with his head down and
[1:04:27] and he needs a touch from God his wife
[1:04:29] told him another pair of shoes your
[1:04:31] shoes are worn out he said honey I don't
[1:04:33] need them I'm not going to live long
[1:04:34] enough
[1:04:35] foreign
[1:04:37] discerns that man an expression of God's
[1:04:40] grace
[1:04:41] it's so wonderful to look at that and
[1:04:43] see that but brothers and sisters it's
[1:04:45] no different now
[1:04:46] power is right here right now
[1:04:50] if two or three are guys in his name
[1:04:52] then he is there in the midst or he's
[1:04:55] not
[1:04:56] right
[1:04:57] there is or it isn't it's black or it's
[1:04:59] white it's no gray and and and
[1:05:02] they want to make it gray they want to
[1:05:04] say unless unless unless unless and less
[1:05:06] and less and less and yeah that's the
[1:05:09] way it'll be unless all these things
[1:05:11] happen unless you do it the theological
[1:05:13] way yeah
[1:05:15] but we've been sent a prophet to show us
[1:05:17] no
[1:05:18] traditions and get into Christ
[1:05:22] you have the ability you have access
[1:05:24] with boldness to go right to the very
[1:05:26] Throne of almighty God
[1:05:29] to become real to us and how is it going
[1:05:32] to come real to us if we just don't hear
[1:05:34] about it if we if we just get encouraged
[1:05:36] about it I just pray that it will become
[1:05:38] so real to us that we'll just Succeed In
[1:05:41] Action in our lives not because we're
[1:05:42] looking for for works because we have
[1:05:45] authority we don't have to tolerate the
[1:05:47] devil coming around and trying to
[1:05:49] torment us because that's what it means
[1:05:52] Tormentor
[1:05:53] we need to torment the devil we need to
[1:05:55] be a nuisance to the devil them to
[1:05:57] flight the word says to submit yourself
[1:06:00] therefore unto God then resemble and he
[1:06:03] will flee we don't flee from the devil
[1:06:05] he flees from us brothers and sisters
[1:06:09] what it needs to come to is can we look
[1:06:13] this grace to us word
[1:06:17] I found that word seeing this and just
[1:06:19] it's I just love how the Lord reveals
[1:06:22] stuff to us word
[1:06:24] he put that word in my heart so I looked
[1:06:26] it up in the Bible I'll just read a few
[1:06:27] scriptures here
[1:06:29] us word
[1:06:31] in Psalms 40 many O Lord
[1:06:34] God
[1:06:36] are thy wonderful works
[1:06:38] which thou Hast
[1:06:40] and thy thoughts
[1:06:42] which are to us word
[1:06:45] cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee
[1:06:48] if I would declare of them they are more
[1:06:52] than can be numbered
[1:06:55] to
[1:06:57] uh
[1:06:58] not someone else in some other age
[1:07:00] behind us or someone else there in the
[1:07:02] front of us in ahead of us our our next
[1:07:05] Generations or whatever should the Lord
[1:07:07] oh right now it has to be us word
[1:07:10] in Ephesians 1 that the God Jesus Christ
[1:07:13] the father of Glory may give unto you
[1:07:15] the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[1:07:19] knowledge of him that the eyes of your
[1:07:21] understanding being enlightened that ye
[1:07:24] make the hope of his calling and the
[1:07:26] riches of his glory of his inheritance
[1:07:28] in the Saints
[1:07:29] takes me right back to a adoption
[1:07:32] Ephesians paralleling Joshua
[1:07:36] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[1:07:39] his power
[1:07:41] to us word who believe
[1:07:43] according to the working of his might
[1:07:47] usward
[1:07:49] and the way it comes up in the Bible is
[1:07:50] us
[1:07:53] Dash word
[1:07:55] us word
[1:07:58] I'm wording it wrong word osward w-a-r
[1:08:03] us word who believe
[1:08:06] what is the exceeding of his power to us
[1:08:09] word
[1:08:10] to think that one day
[1:08:13] this will be changed will either go by
[1:08:15] the way of the grave and we'll get our
[1:08:17] new theophany body go by the way of the
[1:08:20] sky and we'll get our new theophany body
[1:08:22] but one way or the other at our new
[1:08:25] theophany body
[1:08:26] nothing can harm us not even death and
[1:08:29] that needs to be on on our lips we need
[1:08:31] to be able to speak that when the devil
[1:08:33] will come knocking on our door and say
[1:08:35] oh here's a box of cancer
[1:08:38] here's a box of asthma here's a box of
[1:08:42] whatever put your label on it coved
[1:08:44] Whatever It Is
[1:08:46] we can say no
[1:08:48] no no no no no
[1:08:51] what is the exceeding greatness of his
[1:08:54] power to me word
[1:08:57] to us word
[1:08:59] to me I know what his great power is
[1:09:02] because whether I live or whether I die
[1:09:04] in this flesh I'm Christ you can't hurt
[1:09:06] me Satan
[1:09:07] what you do
[1:09:11] second Peter
[1:09:13] second Peter 3 chapter 3 story verse 8
[1:09:15] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:09:18] that one day is with the Lord as a
[1:09:21] thousand years and a thousand years as
[1:09:23] one day
[1:09:24] the Lord is not slack concerning his
[1:09:26] promise as some men count slackness
[1:09:29] long-suffering to us word not willing
[1:09:33] that any but that all should come to
[1:09:37] repentance
[1:09:38] but the day of the Lord it will Thief in
[1:09:41] the Night
[1:09:42] in which the heaven shall pass away with
[1:09:44] a great noise
[1:09:46] shall melt with fervent heat the Earth
[1:09:48] also and the works that in shall be
[1:09:52] burned up
[1:09:53] it's coming a day where it's just going
[1:09:55] to be a complete reputation all of the
[1:09:58] sin is just going to vaporize
[1:10:01] then that all these things
[1:10:05] shall be dissolved
[1:10:07] what manner of persons ought ye to be in
[1:10:10] all holy conversation and godliness
[1:10:13] kind of brings it down down home to
[1:10:16] think about it
[1:10:17] for being a good Christian in church and
[1:10:21] then having a vicious conversation on
[1:10:23] around our dinner table
[1:10:26] or being a good Christian at home of an
[1:10:29] a vicious conversation with someone at
[1:10:31] work
[1:10:33] there's no room for that
[1:10:34] seeing that we understand his great
[1:10:37] power to usward and that all of the
[1:10:41] elements shall soon melt with a fervent
[1:10:43] heat and that we've been access to his
[1:10:46] throne we understand who we are and what
[1:10:48] we're raised up for we we people
[1:10:52] how should we be acting then
[1:10:54] in all whole conversation and godliness
[1:10:58] out of what is the attraction on the
[1:11:00] mount brother Branham in one of the
[1:11:01] president there he says and you're the
[1:11:04] same yesterday today and forever and you
[1:11:06] promise perks that I do shall ye do also
[1:11:10] brothers and sisters as I say and as I
[1:11:13] as I read this tonight I just want to
[1:11:14] say
[1:11:15] this encouragement can sometimes be put
[1:11:19] on the prophet and it's just what was
[1:11:21] the problem if it's office and that's
[1:11:23] what he had and he was the one that was
[1:11:25] given the ability to have this in his
[1:11:27] life it was the example
[1:11:30] if we only have six seals open
[1:11:33] a lot of room for many different
[1:11:34] interpretations but if you read the
[1:11:36] message and you take the message and
[1:11:37] it's all seven seals are open
[1:11:40] and I would talk to anyone about that
[1:11:42] but if they won't see this it will only
[1:11:45] be uh he was a good man and and there
[1:11:47] will be another man and maybe that man
[1:11:50] is Joseph and all these different things
[1:11:52] these weird things can come up I heard
[1:11:54] today and I just I never even really
[1:11:56] believe it I'm so thankful that I've
[1:11:58] never really
[1:12:00] there's a guy that's accepting worship
[1:12:02] as God right now in in a message format
[1:12:05] in in in in another continent in the
[1:12:07] world they're calling him Lord
[1:12:12] I I I myself was just on the floor I
[1:12:15] thought it was a joke but it's not the
[1:12:17] guy's actually accepting worship as God
[1:12:20] it's bizarre
[1:12:21] but you know it just comes down to this
[1:12:23] brothers and sisters if you don't get
[1:12:24] the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:12:26] that you're open to any doctrine of a
[1:12:29] devil and I mean any doctrine of a devil
[1:12:32] it can be some deity spirit it can be a
[1:12:35] a two two two one I'm not going to get
[1:12:38] into naming a bunch of different things
[1:12:39] they don't want to give credit to all
[1:12:41] these different doctrines of devil I
[1:12:43] want to give credit to the Holy Ghost I
[1:12:44] want to give credit where credit is due
[1:12:46] I want to say that if you don't get the
[1:12:47] Holy Ghost you're going to be able to be
[1:12:50] vulnerable to be opened up to whatever
[1:12:52] the cause is and going to capture your
[1:12:55] attention and you will be consumed by it
[1:12:58] if you don't have to post all of the
[1:13:00] guns of hell are trained upon you if
[1:13:02] you're going to mix and mingle around
[1:13:04] for our day if you're going to be around
[1:13:06] the message of the hour and not go all
[1:13:09] the way
[1:13:10] it would be better for you to not have
[1:13:12] known
[1:13:13] that's what the word says
[1:13:16] brother Branham says this and as he says
[1:13:18] this I just want to make it present
[1:13:20] tense I want to try to think that he
[1:13:22] wasn't just talking because he was in
[1:13:24] his office he wasn't just talking
[1:13:25] because he was talking and what I mean
[1:13:27] by his office the prophet's office it's
[1:13:30] not just for them and that
[1:13:32] he's speaking take it and make it a
[1:13:34] present tense I am this is a prayer for
[1:13:36] us today
[1:13:37] right now
[1:13:39] and you're the same yesterday today and
[1:13:41] forever and you've promised that I do
[1:13:43] shall ye do also More Than This shall
[1:13:46] you do because I go to the farm
[1:13:48] and behold
[1:13:50] in the last days I'll send to you Elijah
[1:13:53] prophet
[1:13:55] and he'll change the thoughts of the
[1:13:57] people
[1:13:58] his thoughts of the people
[1:14:00] is that interesting because the word
[1:14:02] says he'll change the hearts of the
[1:14:03] children
[1:14:04] he says he'll change the thoughts
[1:14:07] of the people
[1:14:09] turn parts of the children back to the
[1:14:12] apostolic teaching of the Bible and it
[1:14:14] shall be a light
[1:14:16] about the evening time here we are
[1:14:19] great God Of Heaven the ear
[1:14:22] in 1965
[1:14:25] where are we at today
[1:14:27] the hour is still here brothers and
[1:14:29] sisters that door isn't closed
[1:14:32] is still here
[1:14:35] are upon the people
[1:14:37] I just love how he says this now Satan
[1:14:40] you're defeated
[1:14:45] you are a liar
[1:14:49] and as a servant of God how many
[1:14:52] Servants of God do we have out there
[1:14:55] single person who believes the message
[1:14:57] of the hour every single one you are a
[1:15:00] servant
[1:15:02] Satan you're defeated you're a liar and
[1:15:05] as a servant of and as servants I love
[1:15:08] how he puts that in there as servants so
[1:15:10] it's not just him Prophet as a servant
[1:15:13] of God but as servants we command him of
[1:15:18] Jesus Christ that you obey the word of
[1:15:21] God
[1:15:22] and you go out
[1:15:25] of the people because it's written and
[1:15:28] they shall cast out Devils who are they
[1:15:35] and all the people may be set free
[1:15:38] the punchline that I got from this all
[1:15:41] the people may be set free
[1:15:43] who's let them come
[1:15:45] right
[1:15:46] all the people that want to be free will
[1:15:49] be they come according to the word for
[1:15:51] their day he says granted dear God you
[1:15:54] are the god of Heaven that defeated that
[1:15:56] day with an attraction on the Mount
[1:15:58] Calvary all sick Jesus and all the devil
[1:16:02] all the works of the devil
[1:16:04] you
[1:16:06] and the people are healed by your
[1:16:08] stripes they are free
[1:16:11] of Jesus Christ
[1:16:13] they are free so who are they don't
[1:16:16] there and say the people in Branham
[1:16:18] Tabernacle
[1:16:20] take it right here and I am they
[1:16:23] you are they we are they that he was in
[1:16:28] that prayer
[1:16:30] it's not just the people there in that
[1:16:31] meeting
[1:16:33] I think that we need to do this once in
[1:16:35] a while
[1:16:36] hahaha
[1:16:38] mission that God's given me you know
[1:16:39] what I think we need to do we need to
[1:16:41] take ourselves and we need to die out to
[1:16:43] our we need to just Huck ourselves into
[1:16:45] the bones of the message of the hour and
[1:16:48] in second king 13 it says and it came to
[1:16:51] pass as they were burying a man that
[1:16:53] behold they spot men and they cast the
[1:16:56] man into the Sepulcher of Elisha and
[1:16:59] when the man went down he touched the
[1:17:01] bones of Elisha he revived and stood up
[1:17:03] on his feet Brothers we need to come to
[1:17:06] the place where we're willing to just
[1:17:07] throw ourselves on the altar of the
[1:17:10] messenger on the altar of Christ today
[1:17:12] just die out to ourselves and see if
[1:17:15] that same same Elijah Elisha John the
[1:17:18] Baptist and William Miriam Branham
[1:17:20] anointing manifested
[1:17:23] you like
[1:17:24] see if it doesn't act you up to a new
[1:17:27] level
[1:17:28] don't take whatever it is we think we
[1:17:30] know
[1:17:31] we think we know don't have a tradition
[1:17:34] don't say that I've already got the
[1:17:36] message of the app it's it's just fine
[1:17:38] it's going to take me through make it a
[1:17:40] daily sacrifice make die out to
[1:17:43] ourselves and this word becomes a
[1:17:45] bleeding word to us every day I heard it
[1:17:49] said that a sacrifice when we go on our
[1:17:51] knees and we pray
[1:17:53] place when we come to church and sing a
[1:17:55] sacrifice when we give our tithe if it
[1:17:57] is not with
[1:18:00] then it's actually pointless
[1:18:04] only has no meaning
[1:18:05] and how do we get blood
[1:18:09] willing to die out ourselves
[1:18:12] good works ain't going to do it for us
[1:18:15] good works are burned we know that the
[1:18:17] the I don't know if it's even I don't
[1:18:18] think it's in the word I know
[1:18:21] the road to hell is paved with good
[1:18:24] intentions
[1:18:26] works is not going to save us
[1:18:30] we need to make willing to die out to
[1:18:32] ourselves and just throw ourselves on on
[1:18:35] that anointing and align to actually
[1:18:37] come and manifest in our lives because
[1:18:39] when it does brothers and sisters we'll
[1:18:41] never
[1:18:42] ever ever be the same and nobody will
[1:18:45] ever be able to talk us out of it
[1:18:47] of people that will say oh did you hear
[1:18:49] that brother Branham was hunting out a
[1:18:51] season and and that wasn't even where he
[1:18:53] said it was and and he said this and he
[1:18:57] said that and 16 men on the bridge and
[1:19:00] all these different things all these
[1:19:01] doctrinal things that creep in and suck
[1:19:04] you in to make you wonder and doubt and
[1:19:06] see was was William Miriam Bradham how
[1:19:09] Blasphemous can people get we don't
[1:19:12] worship a man but good
[1:19:15] if you can't believe the man that he did
[1:19:18] which is exactly what Jesus said to the
[1:19:21] people we're not saying that he was
[1:19:23] Jesus he was fulfilling an office he was
[1:19:26] anointed by it
[1:19:28] but if we can allow that same anointing
[1:19:31] to come upon us if if we can't allow
[1:19:33] that anointing to come up then why did
[1:19:36] that anointing come brothers and sisters
[1:19:39] some people will say Office of the
[1:19:41] prophet he wasn't a wave chief
[1:19:43] that's a doctrine of a devil say that he
[1:19:46] wasn't a wave Chief I I pray that we
[1:19:48] could have a conversation that we could
[1:19:50] actually try and out the wrinkles
[1:19:52] because he was the wave chief he was the
[1:19:54] example of mature Daughters of God the
[1:19:57] ones who are Mark 16 in action the true
[1:20:00] church the only church that he claims as
[1:20:03] his own because all else is false
[1:20:06] because all is some other life it's a
[1:20:09] hybrid condition his life
[1:20:11] is marked attraction his very own life
[1:20:14] that's the only Mark 16 to happen the
[1:20:17] only thing
[1:20:19] we've got to be willing to just throw
[1:20:21] myself down cast down our imagination
[1:20:24] our righteousness is brags before him
[1:20:29] but you know in Romans chapter 8 but if
[1:20:32] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[1:20:34] from the dead dwell in you
[1:20:38] Oh my he that raised up Christ from the
[1:20:40] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:20:42] bodies by his spirit that quickening
[1:20:45] power
[1:20:46] I don't know if anybody listened to it's
[1:20:48] the rising of the sun with eating here
[1:20:50] if you hear about that quickening power
[1:20:52] it just does something to Sons and
[1:20:54] Daughters of
[1:20:56] Christ from the dead shall also also
[1:20:59] Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[1:21:01] that dwelleth in you
[1:21:03] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[1:21:06] the flesh to live after the flesh for if
[1:21:08] he flesh ye shall die if you're caught
[1:21:11] up in all of the worldly things because
[1:21:13] I provide for my family and I still have
[1:21:15] to make a living and I still have to do
[1:21:17] all this stuff what we're doing is
[1:21:19] excuse for it to become an idol in our
[1:21:22] lives we need to put him first
[1:21:25] first and make him our marketing program
[1:21:27] make him all of our and when he is all
[1:21:31] of our life entirely
[1:21:33] that's when it changes for us
[1:21:36] he doesn't want our image he only wants
[1:21:39] his image he wants us
[1:21:41] His Image to the world around him and
[1:21:43] when we do that we're putting him first
[1:21:46] he'll bless us
[1:21:48] third we're not debtors
[1:21:50] not to we are debtors sorry not to the
[1:21:53] flesh after the flesh for if you live
[1:21:56] after the flesh ye shall die but if
[1:21:58] through the spirit purify the Deeds of
[1:22:01] the body ye shall live for as many as
[1:22:03] are led by this God
[1:22:07] they are the sons of God present I am if
[1:22:11] we're led by the spirit of God
[1:22:13] not by our own thinking
[1:22:15] by our tradition
[1:22:18] not by something that came over from
[1:22:21] um grandparents Traditions that was
[1:22:23] pulled over into the message of the hour
[1:22:25] and Blended in with it because it's been
[1:22:27] with us for all these years it's it's
[1:22:29] part of the message of the hour is it
[1:22:32] being able to make sure that it is part
[1:22:33] of the message of the hour and if it's
[1:22:34] not part of the message of the hour we
[1:22:36] just need to put it away
[1:22:38] we're not bad people
[1:22:40] they don't want to put anybody in or out
[1:22:42] or say anybody
[1:22:43] we just want to make sure that we throw
[1:22:45] away our traditions and get into Christ
[1:22:46] because that's what the prophet said
[1:22:48] that's not what Barry Johnson said I'm
[1:22:50] just repeating I'm parroting the prophet
[1:22:53] I don't like that but hey that's the
[1:22:55] only thing that's going to save us
[1:22:57] that's the only thing that will
[1:23:00] but if you mortify
[1:23:02] if ye through this mortify the Deeds of
[1:23:06] the body ye shall live
[1:23:10] I just love that they are the sons of
[1:23:12] God it's it's present tense they
[1:23:15] of God
[1:23:18] and you know brothers and sisters
[1:23:20] they're the
[1:23:22] brother Branham said that they're free
[1:23:24] I remember when he called out prayer he
[1:23:27] told him
[1:23:28] you're a liar
[1:23:30] you have no your powers were stripped at
[1:23:33] Calvary
[1:23:36] these people
[1:23:40] in Hebrews chapter one therefore leaving
[1:23:44] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[1:23:46] let us go on to perfection
[1:23:49] what is perfect there's only one thing
[1:23:51] that's perfect brothers and sisters
[1:23:53] weigh your traditions and get into
[1:23:55] Christ I believe that that says that
[1:23:57] right there
[1:23:58] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[1:24:01] we learned them when we were children
[1:24:04] we need to repent and that we need to
[1:24:05] get baptized
[1:24:07] and that we need to go on and Holy Ghost
[1:24:10] but then what
[1:24:11] when we get the Holy Ghost what does
[1:24:13] that do it doesn't get a way to live it
[1:24:16] doesn't give us a box of tools so that
[1:24:18] we can go into this world and just eat
[1:24:21] there's there's many religions out there
[1:24:23] that say that's what that is that'll
[1:24:24] give us the ability it gives us to
[1:24:26] actually Prosper because we can name it
[1:24:28] and then we can claim it and and we just
[1:24:31] can do that and and that's you know it's
[1:24:33] just a pendulum it swings both ways what
[1:24:36] it does though gives us the ability to
[1:24:38] get into Christ
[1:24:39] when we leave the doctrines and the
[1:24:41] principles that we've been taught as a
[1:24:43] child when I was a child I spake as a
[1:24:45] child and I thought as a child and I
[1:24:47] asked but when that which is perfect has
[1:24:49] come I have the ability to get right
[1:24:51] into Christ and I don't worry about
[1:24:53] those little things and what I'm getting
[1:24:55] at brothers and sisters is that we have
[1:24:56] full Authority and not just a song that
[1:24:59] we sing and we need to bring it from
[1:25:01] being just a song that we sing We need
[1:25:03] to can actually rebuke Satan in the name
[1:25:06] of Jesus Christ and he has to flee
[1:25:09] not just he might flee or or one day
[1:25:12] maybe he'll flee he has to
[1:25:15] remember how brother Bradham worded that
[1:25:16] I'm going to go back to that quote just
[1:25:18] because it's so good
[1:25:20] the way he worded it
[1:25:25] Satan you're defeated
[1:25:28] I just love those words
[1:25:31] you're actually going to be cast into a
[1:25:33] lake of fire
[1:25:34] and Revelations 10.
[1:25:38] I know he's listening that's why I'm
[1:25:40] saying it
[1:25:41] I'd love to actually do that and and I'm
[1:25:44] probably going to get steamrolled
[1:25:45] because of it but you know what what God
[1:25:48] wants then that's okay it'll be for my
[1:25:50] character
[1:25:51] but I'm just recognized that he has no
[1:25:54] Authority and why should I actually
[1:25:55] tolerate his antics
[1:25:58] I think the more that I talk about him
[1:26:00] being thrown into a lake of fire cast
[1:26:02] alive to fire well he'll be tormented
[1:26:05] day and night forever and ever
[1:26:08] he's hearing that
[1:26:12] but Satan anyways the prophet defeated
[1:26:15] and I believe it you're defeated you're
[1:26:17] a liar and as a God and as servants we
[1:26:21] command that in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:23] that you obey the god he has to obey the
[1:26:27] word of God he doesn't have an option
[1:26:30] we have the ability as human beings to
[1:26:34] obey the word of God but remember angel
[1:26:37] he has to follow the word of God
[1:26:41] one will
[1:26:43] but he knows it in my name the devils
[1:26:49] they shall speak with new tongues
[1:26:52] pick up serpents and if they drink any
[1:26:54] deadly thing it shall not harm them
[1:26:57] brothers and sisters we don't have to
[1:26:59] fear a vaccine
[1:27:00] I just want to throw that out there
[1:27:03] worry about a vaccine
[1:27:05] vaccine isn't going to take us to Hell a
[1:27:07] vacuum is going to give us the mark of
[1:27:09] the beast
[1:27:10] refusing the Holy Ghost
[1:27:13] today we have the option to get oil that
[1:27:16] is receiving the mark according to the
[1:27:20] prophet of Malachi 4. refusing to accept
[1:27:24] the
[1:27:25] is accepting the mark of the beast
[1:27:27] that's the mark of the beat
[1:27:31] there's come in a day where there will
[1:27:33] be a physical identification where
[1:27:35] there'll be something that's given to a
[1:27:37] person that will identify them and you
[1:27:39] won't buy or sell
[1:27:40] what but brother Branham says very
[1:27:43] clearly what the mark and the hand is in
[1:27:44] the mark in the forehead is
[1:27:46] the thoughts and the intents and the
[1:27:49] other one is the action the movement of
[1:27:51] the hand if you look into the message
[1:27:52] you'll see it
[1:27:54] it's not actually a microchip that's
[1:27:56] going in us that's going to happen to
[1:27:59] all the people maybe who are unwise
[1:28:01] virgin who will tribulation but it's not
[1:28:04] going to happen to the bride because she
[1:28:05] accepts the Holy Ghost
[1:28:08] in his fullness Christ she accepts the
[1:28:11] fact that Christ actually on Sunset
[1:28:14] Mountain just like he said he would just
[1:28:17] like the angel messengers of Galilee why
[1:28:20] stand you here gazing up into heaven
[1:28:22] into the cloud where this G
[1:28:24] he's going to come exactly the same way
[1:28:26] that you saw him go up into heaven that
[1:28:29] doorway open in heaven he's going to
[1:28:32] come exactly the same way so just go
[1:28:34] preach the God go back into Jerusalem
[1:28:36] and follow his instructions and get the
[1:28:38] Holy Ghost
[1:28:40] that's all we need is just to get the
[1:28:42] Holy Ghost and it sounds sounds Maybe
[1:28:45] I don't even know what the right word
[1:28:47] would be
[1:28:48] maybe it sounds a little bit hokey just
[1:28:50] get the Holy Ghost but it's the truth
[1:28:52] it really is the truth the only way
[1:28:56] today is to get the Holy Ghost if we
[1:28:59] think about the pressures of this life
[1:29:01] congratulations last night and this
[1:29:03] whole thing about children now in
[1:29:05] schools being able to be taught without
[1:29:08] parents permission
[1:29:11] that it's okay for them to change
[1:29:14] it just really magnifies the point
[1:29:18] how all creation is groaning for the
[1:29:21] manifestation of the sons of and we can
[1:29:24] see it brothers and sisters if you look
[1:29:26] at it being just imposed so that way
[1:29:30] that if you talk against it it's hate
[1:29:32] speech it's now let's just hate speech
[1:29:35] but look at it how important it is for
[1:29:39] Satan's
[1:29:40] to try and actually manipulate people to
[1:29:43] change their bodies it's because change
[1:29:46] is so close
[1:29:48] get oil
[1:29:51] be caught without it
[1:29:55] we have to just get into Christ and
[1:29:58] that's our Perfection and what is that
[1:30:00] Perfection What is
[1:30:02] for today just to break it down as we
[1:30:05] close
[1:30:05] maybe I'll even call
[1:30:08] what is Christ today Brothers and
[1:30:09] Sisters Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:30:12] it's the message of the hour
[1:30:16] what was Christ in Noah's day
[1:30:19] what was Christ in Paul's day
[1:30:22] what was Christ in in all of the
[1:30:25] different ages throughout the ages it
[1:30:27] was the messenger they brought
[1:30:30] was Christ for that day
[1:30:34] Christ today it's the message of this
[1:30:36] age
[1:30:37] and what is the message of this age
[1:30:39] sisters
[1:30:41] just to bring it right down home
[1:30:44] it's shapes
[1:30:47] even though some might say it is and and
[1:30:49] two is
[1:30:51] but it ain't books and tapes and it's
[1:30:53] not a message app it's not a hero tablet
[1:30:58] it's not a belt buckle
[1:31:01] I think tangible that we can see what it
[1:31:03] is the message today is Christ in you
[1:31:06] hope of glory
[1:31:08] and how does that happen by the Holy
[1:31:10] Ghost by accepting the day we get the
[1:31:13] opportunity to realize how we need to
[1:31:15] receive the Holy Ghost for our day when
[1:31:17] we close for our day we've got the oil
[1:31:19] and that's all we need
[1:31:21] seek ye first God and all these things
[1:31:25] all the rest of it will be added unto
[1:31:27] you when you need to speak forwards when
[1:31:29] you see the devil come in and try and
[1:31:31] torment you or your wife or your life
[1:31:34] stomp on the devil
[1:31:36] our heel isn't going to be bruised by
[1:31:38] his head
[1:31:39] we know that Christ heal already was
[1:31:41] bruised
[1:31:43] for our sake
[1:31:45] and he crushed Satan he killed him
[1:31:47] took away all his powers he's got no
[1:31:49] power
[1:31:51] and he's doomed and he knows it and the
[1:31:53] only thing that he has going forward
[1:31:56] is the distraction of the Bride As long
[1:31:58] as he can keep her distracted from
[1:32:00] actualizing what she is he's got a
[1:32:03] little space of time just a teeny little
[1:32:05] space
[1:32:07] But as soon as we realize it as soon as
[1:32:10] we come to that standing that we don't
[1:32:13] have to tolerate all this stuff that we
[1:32:15] tolerate on a regular basis just the way
[1:32:17] this world is around us the tangibility
[1:32:19] of this life we come in born in sin come
[1:32:23] into this world speaking lies but there
[1:32:25] comes a point in time where we no longer
[1:32:26] speak as a child thinking talk as a
[1:32:28] child or act as a child we we come to
[1:32:31] full maturity and we know that time
[1:32:34] comes that which is in part shall be
[1:32:36] done away with because that perfect
[1:32:39] comes into our hearts
[1:32:42] and when that which is perfect has come
[1:32:43] we can just all the things that we
[1:32:45] thought we we needed to worry about we
[1:32:47] don't need to worry about fussing about
[1:32:48] all these little details in life what we
[1:32:51] need to do is just get into Christ just
[1:32:52] keep him first promote him to
[1:32:55] of our lives and when he's there he'll
[1:32:57] look after everything else and he won't
[1:33:00] come do it but he might give people in
[1:33:02] our lives he might bring people into our
[1:33:04] lives
[1:33:05] right at the time we need it with the
[1:33:08] exact encouragement that we need and
[1:33:10] maybe we need to learn about how to do
[1:33:12] something maybe we need to learn just a
[1:33:14] carnal example how to finances invest or
[1:33:17] how to deal with our taxes
[1:33:20] if we bring that to him
[1:33:22] as a child of God do you think he won't
[1:33:24] give us a solution
[1:33:27] to think that he won't give us a
[1:33:29] solution if we ask him
[1:33:31] many times Satan will just get us so
[1:33:35] caught up in it we'll just get carnal
[1:33:36] and we'll go to Google
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:39] instead of actually going to God
[1:33:41] just a simple carnal example but works
[1:33:44] in every single area of our lives either
[1:33:46] it works or it doesn't brothers and
[1:33:48] sisters
[1:33:49] it either works or it doesn't there's no
[1:33:52] point pretending and saying that well
[1:33:53] that's good for some and not good for
[1:33:55] others it's good for everything if we're
[1:33:57] believers
[1:33:59] either it ain't
[1:34:03] sorry for being maybe hard
[1:34:06] forgive me but it's true
[1:34:09] the message for today is the hope of
[1:34:11] glory it doesn't do any good to just
[1:34:13] simply read or talk about it
[1:34:17] we've got to be willing to speak the
[1:34:19] word and go forwards someone has to get
[1:34:22] the word today
[1:34:24] and I say let it be us
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:29] don't want to just sing about it and
[1:34:30] talk about it brothers and sisters maybe
[1:34:32] for years maybe it's felt that way for
[1:34:34] years and and maybe there's just a time
[1:34:37] where we just move from being children
[1:34:39] to being adults to being the the fully
[1:34:42] established Daughters of God where we
[1:34:44] recognize that which is perfect is come
[1:34:47] already it's right here waiting for me
[1:34:49] to say be it unto me according to Thy
[1:34:52] word according to thy and what is that
[1:34:55] that's the message of the hour be unto
[1:34:56] me according to thy will according to
[1:34:58] Thy Word
[1:35:00] experience it for yourself
[1:35:03] you know I was having a calm the brother
[1:35:05] today maybe stand with me as we close
[1:35:07] it's having a conversation today with
[1:35:09] the brother was pouring his heart out to
[1:35:12] me and just it was so encouraging to
[1:35:14] hear him have a rule of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:16] in his life and he said you know I've
[1:35:19] tried my whole entire life happened and
[1:35:22] I've been up and I've been down and I'm
[1:35:24] just not into it anymore
[1:35:26] it's not the right way I don't have to
[1:35:30] try and Chase it I don't have to damage
[1:35:32] I don't have to have something great to
[1:35:34] show the world around me I don't have to
[1:35:36] measure everything all I need is the
[1:35:39] holy ghost in my life
[1:35:41] and I wanted to say to him
[1:35:43] you've got it brother I can tell you
[1:35:45] you've got it because you've got that
[1:35:46] desire in you willing to just throw it
[1:35:49] all away it doesn't matter
[1:35:52] I've got my family word I don't need
[1:35:55] anything else
[1:35:57] if we can come to that place
[1:35:59] I think God really just wants to bless
[1:36:01] us he wants to see us speak the word
[1:36:02] he's not gonna word he's already spoken
[1:36:05] the word through a prophet he's already
[1:36:08] done it he's already given us an open
[1:36:10] book with our name
[1:36:13] written inside and without all we need
[1:36:16] to do is recognize that brothers and
[1:36:17] sisters
[1:36:18] God bless you tonight let's just go
[1:36:22] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:36:24] for your word
[1:36:26] for the progressive revelation in our
[1:36:28] lives Lord
[1:36:30] thank you Father Lord we can look back
[1:36:33] in our lives and think that there's
[1:36:35] times where maybe damn things and in in
[1:36:38] in due course you allow that Revelation
[1:36:41] to break for us and and and to take us
[1:36:44] and and train us as children
[1:36:47] the ability to understand things later
[1:36:49] on that maybe we didn't understand
[1:36:51] before
[1:36:52] father we just want to have that measure
[1:36:56] of Grace for those people around
[1:36:58] maybe once upon a time someone had a
[1:37:02] strange Doctrine or strenation in their
[1:37:04] lives and it caused us to just be a
[1:37:07] little bit skewed in our
[1:37:10] father forgive us because we know that
[1:37:13] they have the opportunity
[1:37:15] also for progressive revelation in their
[1:37:18] lives
[1:37:19] and so as as as humans as we grow as as
[1:37:24] Sons and Daughters we have the
[1:37:26] opportunity to grow and learn and all of
[1:37:29] us evolve and change
[1:37:31] and Lord there's only one thing that we
[1:37:33] change into that's your image
[1:37:37] Lord I pray tonight that you would just
[1:37:39] take the words that were spoken Lord
[1:37:41] Jesus and bless them to the spiritual
[1:37:43] nourishment of every one of us father
[1:37:46] myself and
[1:37:47] I pray Lord Jesus that I wouldn't just
[1:37:50] be talking I don't want a talker of the
[1:37:54] word Lord I want to be a doer
[1:37:57] and I that if there's anything in my
[1:37:59] life that that is unpleasing to you that
[1:38:01] you would just forgive me for it take it
[1:38:04] from me that you would show me Lord
[1:38:05] Jesus that I could make it better myself
[1:38:09] I don't want to be in a position where I
[1:38:11] mislead anyone father I want to make
[1:38:14] your preaching your word in season
[1:38:17] because that's the only thing that will
[1:38:18] change our body
[1:38:20] we pray father that you would just bless
[1:38:22] each one that you would watch over the
[1:38:24] homes father if we go into this next
[1:38:26] phase of of weirdness with the covet
[1:38:29] Lord it seems important and so confusing
[1:38:31] but we know that you are not the author
[1:38:33] of it
[1:38:34] and we pray give us peace of mind and
[1:38:38] resolution in our hearts Lord Jesus to
[1:38:40] just stay together to bind ourselves
[1:38:42] that much closer together
[1:38:44] as we go forwards
[1:38:46] say that Lord
[1:38:48] whatever your will is that we would just
[1:38:50] be sensitive to yours we would see your
[1:38:53] will being done in our lives that Lord
[1:38:55] just like Mary when she said me
[1:38:58] according to Thy word father that that
[1:39:00] word would just take root and begin to
[1:39:02] life would just come to fruition and
[1:39:05] that we would see that life manifest in
[1:39:08] our life so much Lord that our bodies
[1:39:11] just can't contain that life any the old
[1:39:14] old people will just die away that we
[1:39:17] would just die out to ourselves that you
[1:39:19] live through US father
[1:39:21] we just love you and we thank you we
[1:39:23] pray that you would just give Lord and
[1:39:25] bring us back again on Sunday if it Be
