[37:20] Jesus father we're so thankful that we

[37:24] Jesus tonight we have many needs in our

[37:28] you would meet each one sovereignly

[37:56] Christ's name we pray
[37:58] amen amen thank you
[38:01] musicians certainly enjoy the songs and
[38:04] the special thank you sister Michelle
[38:07] it's wonderful it always sets an
[38:09] atmosphere if you have your Bibles
[38:11] tonight I'd like to read a story that's
[38:12] fairly familiar I just like to take a
[38:15] little look at uh foot washing and
[38:19] communion and we'll just take some time
[38:21] as we have the
[38:23] communions services and and I don't want
[38:26] to take too long tonight but maybe just
[38:28] set a little bit of a background for it
[38:31] and that comes from Luke
[38:33] 7 a very familiar
[38:37] scripture Luke chapter 7 it's the story
[38:41] of Simon the
[38:44] fery I'm sure we're all familiar with
[38:47] that but if you're not it's about the
[38:49] washing of the Lord's feet
[38:53] amen and as I looked at this I was able
[38:55] to see there's more to the the washing
[38:58] of feet than just simply this story or
[39:01] everything in the New Testament this
[39:03] goes back to Old Testament and isn't it
[39:05] beautiful because Christ never did
[39:08] anything God never does anything outside
[39:11] of the scripture unless his father First
[39:14] shows him this foot washing thing is
[39:17] exactly out of the Old Testament and uh
[39:19] we'll get into that Lord willing verse
[39:22] 36 of Luke 7 tonight and one of the
[39:26] Pharisees desired Ed him that he would
[39:28] eat with him and he went into the
[39:31] Pharisees house and sat down to
[39:34] meet and behold a woman in the city
[39:38] which was a sinner when she knew that
[39:41] Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house
[39:44] bought an alabaster box of
[39:47] ointment and stood At His Feet behind
[39:51] him weeping and began to wash his feet
[39:55] with tears and did White them with the
[39:58] hairs of her head and kissed his feet
[40:01] and anointed them with the
[40:03] ointment now when the FY which had
[40:06] bidden him saw it he spake within
[40:10] himself saying this man if he were a
[40:13] prophet would have known who and what
[40:17] manner of woman this is that toucheth
[40:20] him for she is a
[40:24] sinner and Jesus answering said unto to
[40:28] him totally Discerning his
[40:31] heart and Jesus answering said unto him
[40:36] Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee
[40:41] and he saith Master say
[40:45] on there was a certain creditor which
[40:47] had two
[40:48] debtors the one owed 500 Pence the other
[40:53] 50 and when they had nothing to pay he
[40:55] frankly forgave them both
[40:58] tell me therefore which of them will
[41:01] love him
[41:02] most Simon answered and said I suppose
[41:05] that he to whom he forgave most and he
[41:09] said unto him thou Hast rightly judged
[41:13] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[41:15] Simon seest thou this woman I entered
[41:17] into thine house and thou gavest me no
[41:19] water for my feet but she hath washed my
[41:23] feet with tears and wiped them with the
[41:26] hair of her
[41:28] head thou gavest me no kiss but this
[41:32] woman since the time I came in hath not
[41:35] ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil
[41:39] thou did not anoint but this woman hath
[41:42] anointed my feet with ointment wherefore
[41:46] I say unto thee her sins which are many
[41:50] are forgiven for she loved much but to
[41:55] whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth
[41:58] little and he said unto her thy sins are
[42:03] forgiven amen let's just bow in prayer
[42:06] one more time Heavenly Father Lord we're
[42:09] so thankful for your word we're so
[42:12] thankful that Lord Jesus we can see
[42:14] ourselves in your word amen because we
[42:16] know that we fit that
[42:18] description we just ask that you would
[42:20] break this bread of life to us fresh
[42:22] once again amen you would speak to our
[42:24] hearts Lord Jesus as we approach your
[42:27] table tonight father as we approach the
[42:30] partaking of the communion and the foot
[42:32] washing father we pray that Lord we
[42:35] could do it humbly that we could do it
[42:38] purely father that we could discern your
[42:40] body properly Hallelujah we just ask all
[42:43] these things now in Jesus Christ's name
[42:44] we pray amen amen God bless you tonight
[42:48] you may be
[42:49] seated I will certainly try not to take
[42:52] very much time certainly thankful for
[42:55] everyone coming out a little earlier
[42:56] it's a little bit different but Lord
[42:58] willing uh at the end of it we'll be
[43:00] able to get home a little earlier and uh
[43:03] you know if the spirit moves and we want
[43:05] to stay a little bit later than I could
[43:06] see that happening also we just want to
[43:09] we just want to have Liberty where the
[43:10] Lord is don't
[43:12] we tonight I just want to talk about
[43:14] foot washing and and I think it's a an
[43:17] amazing thing when you look at it as I
[43:20] mentioned there's uh never an accident
[43:22] it's never a coincidence the way the
[43:24] Lord does things it's always with a
[43:27] purpose and uh it's always according to
[43:29] scripture and if you'll turn with me to
[43:32] Psalms
[43:34] 58 verse
[43:38] 10 Psalms 58 verse
[43:56] 10
[43:57] Psalms 58:10 says the
[44:00] righteous shall
[44:02] rejoice when he seeth the
[44:06] Vengeance he shall wash his feet in the
[44:09] blood of the
[44:11] wicked so that a man shall say verily
[44:13] there is a reward for the righteous
[44:16] verily he is a God that judgeth in the
[44:21] earth and isn't it interesting brothers
[44:23] and sisters out of John Chapter 13 where
[44:27] we are going to read tonight if you want
[44:29] to turn over to that just talking about
[44:32] foot
[44:33] washing we know that Jesus I just want
[44:36] to talk about this a little bit before
[44:38] we go into it we'll have the communion
[44:40] service first don't get nervous that
[44:42] we'll have foot washing first we'll have
[44:44] the communion service first then we'll
[44:45] do the foot washing and then we'll have
[44:47] some testimony and song afterwards in
[44:50] case anybody needs to leave um we can do
[44:52] it that way but I just want to discuss
[44:54] the the foot washing portion I think
[44:56] it's so f
[44:57] fascinating the righteous shall rejoice
[45:00] when he seeth the Vengeance he shall
[45:03] wash his feet in the blood of the wicked
[45:06] and and here we have this this God in
[45:09] verse 11 so that a man shall say verily
[45:12] there is a reward for the righteous
[45:14] verily he is a God that judgeth in the
[45:19] earth do you imagine those disciples
[45:22] understood that this scripture was
[45:26] actually the one
[45:27] bowing down to wash their feet first he
[45:31] was washing their feet the god that's
[45:34] going to judge the Earth he's going to
[45:36] wash his feet in the blood of all of the
[45:39] Sinners was bowing down to wash their
[45:43] feet with water not with blood they did
[45:46] not have to go through the persecution
[45:48] they don't have to go through the
[45:50] Judgment that God who is righteous who
[45:52] is going to execute Vengeance on this
[45:54] world for turning him away
[45:57] was willing to actually be a footwash
[46:00] flunky brother bradam said to wash his
[46:03] disciples feet with water and to say to
[46:07] them do you know what I've done unto
[46:10] you do we recognize what he was doing
[46:13] unto them he was displaying Grace unto
[46:15] them because there is coming a time
[46:17] where that God of vengeance is going to
[46:20] wash his feet in the blood of the wicked
[46:23] and we know that the blood is going to
[46:25] run up to the horse's brother
[46:27] Idol for many miles in the valley
[46:31] megiddo I think it is in in in Israel in
[46:35] in the revelations it says that it's
[46:38] going to happen but here this righteous
[46:41] judge is going to wash his feet in the
[46:44] blood of the wicked but verily he is a
[46:47] God that judgeth in the
[46:50] earth and here the disciples in John
[46:54] chapter
[46:55] 13
[46:57] we know that
[47:00] Jesus verse four says of John Chapter 13
[47:04] He riseth from supper and laid aside his
[47:07] garments and took a towel and girded
[47:09] himself after that he pth water into a
[47:12] basin and began to wash the disciples
[47:15] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[47:19] wherewith he was
[47:21] girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and
[47:23] Peter saith unto himl Dost thou wash my
[47:26] feet
[47:28] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[47:32] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[47:35] know Hereafter you don't realize Peter
[47:39] what's happening here but I am the god
[47:41] that's going to execute judgment that's
[47:43] going to execute Vengeance on this
[47:45] sinful world one day but I'm first going
[47:48] to minister Grace unto those who I love
[47:52] those who I call not servants anymore
[47:54] but I call friends and not even just
[47:57] servants or friends but the bride those
[47:59] ones I'm going to wash their feet so if
[48:02] you know what I'm doing unto you you
[48:04] ought to be willing to do that one to
[48:07] another this is a very significant thing
[48:09] this foot washing thing isn't just a
[48:11] weird thing that William Mary and
[48:12] brandom came out with this this goes
[48:15] right back to the Old Testament this is
[48:17] an ordinance to recognize one day there
[48:19] is going to be a Vengeance there's going
[48:21] to be a judgment but it's going to be
[48:23] feet that are washed in blood but here
[48:26] he is this God of Vengeance
[48:29] demonstrating Grace with water and
[48:33] humbling himself before his disciples
[48:36] before his friends to wash their feet
[48:39] and to say to them do you you don't even
[48:41] know what I'm doing here this is the god
[48:44] of Glory tabernacled in flesh and I am
[48:48] going to humble myself before you and
[48:50] wash your feet I just I got into this
[48:53] and sometimes it's just like getting
[48:55] into a a pot of honey like brother
[48:57] bradam talked about the bears in his
[48:59] tent and you know you just start to see
[49:02] more and more and more I hope it's not
[49:05] too convoluted and and confusing tonight
[49:07] I certainly don't mean it to be that way
[49:09] but I I just think it's beautiful the
[49:11] way the Lord does things he never ever
[49:14] does things just by accident it's always
[49:17] always exactly according to the
[49:18] scripture amen you know this is the god
[49:21] that we serve brothers and sisters the
[49:23] one that actually will one day come back
[49:26] and be the judge will actually execute
[49:29] judgment and will wash his feet in blood
[49:32] but here we have the opportunity to wash
[49:34] his feet tonight Hallelujah with water
[49:38] the way that he instructed us we have
[49:40] Grace one to another and we know his
[49:43] disciples he told them how will the
[49:45] world know that you love me he said if
[49:49] you have love one for
[49:51] another and and that's that's not it's
[49:54] easier said than done isn't it in the
[49:56] flesh we can't do that but with his
[49:59] spirit in our lives we have the ability
[50:01] to love one another with with a love
[50:03] that goes well beyond what we can
[50:06] comprehend that that passes all
[50:08] understanding but I just wanted to talk
[50:10] a little bit tonight about this house of
[50:12] Simon the parable of the of the of the
[50:15] woman and and and how Simon the most
[50:18] religious one he had no idea who it was
[50:21] that was with him at his house he called
[50:24] Upon Jesus we talked about this we
[50:25] preached on it a while AG go but we can
[50:27] call Upon Jesus we can invite him to the
[50:29] services we can invite him to our homes
[50:32] invite him to our lives but then not
[50:34] recognize him or appreciate him when
[50:36] he's there where two or three are
[50:38] gathered together in his name he's there
[50:40] in their midst he's here tonight
[50:41] brothers and sisters he is Jesus Christ
[50:43] the same yesterday today and forever the
[50:45] same one that came and stood on stage
[50:47] with his his Prophet the seventh angel
[50:49] messenger that same God is right here
[50:51] tonight amen if you're willing to
[50:54] believe that and even if you're not
[50:56] willing to believe it his word said so
[50:58] so he's here there's no amount of
[51:00] unbelief that will stop him from
[51:02] actually fulfilling his word but that
[51:04] same one is here tonight and you know we
[51:06] have the ability to recognize his
[51:08] presence and to wash his feet when we
[51:11] wash one another's feet brothers and
[51:13] sisters you're not washing your brother
[51:16] your sister's feet at least I certainly
[51:18] hope not you know I think about this
[51:21] story here this woman who has the uh the
[51:24] hair right and and many might say well
[51:27] she was a prostitute brother Barry she
[51:29] probably was really unkempt and maybe
[51:30] she was but as Brothers and Sisters in
[51:34] Christ would we ever have the audacity
[51:36] to do that to wash a brother or a
[51:38] sister's feet with our tears amen let
[51:41] alone to get one or two hairs out of
[51:44] place maybe even when we just wash in a
[51:46] bucket oh we brush our our head against
[51:48] their knee or something and and and it's
[51:50] a problem this woman was all in there
[51:53] was nothing reserving her all of her
[51:56] reserv ations were gone she was pouring
[51:58] her life out washing his feet because
[52:00] she recognized he was left unattended
[52:03] brothers and sisters don't let anything
[52:05] stand in the way of you and God tonight
[52:08] anytime you have the opportunity to wash
[52:10] a brother or sister's feet recognize
[52:12] you're not washing your brother or
[52:13] sister's feet it's not about your
[52:15] brother or your sister it's all about
[52:17] you and
[52:18] God and we have the ability to allow
[52:21] someone to actually do that it's just
[52:24] like praying one for another but this
[52:27] God that we serve brothers and sisters
[52:29] he will execute judgment one day and we
[52:32] know that's what he did in Simon's house
[52:35] seest this
[52:37] woman my I entered into thine house and
[52:41] thou gavest me no water for my feet but
[52:44] she hath washed my feet with tears and
[52:47] wiped them with the hairs of her
[52:50] head
[52:52] why we need to recognize his presence
[52:55] amen you know there was a time where the
[52:58] disciples they said they were expecting
[53:00] Jesus to be someone different weren't
[53:02] they the the whole world was expecting a
[53:05] different Jesus they were expecting
[53:08] someone to come and execute judgment and
[53:11] to be that one who was going to wash his
[53:12] feet in the blood of human beings to to
[53:16] to set them free from the captors to get
[53:19] rid of the
[53:20] occupiers that's what they were
[53:21] expecting but they didn't recognize
[53:23] there was a lot of scripture that had to
[53:24] be fulfilled they didn't recognize there
[53:26] were seven whole church ages that had to
[53:29] happen and and we know that the
[53:31] disciples asked him in Acts chap 1 verse
[53:34] four it says and being assembled
[53:36] together with them commanded them that
[53:39] they should not depart from Jerusalem
[53:41] but wait for the promise of the Father
[53:42] which he saith he ye have heard of me
[53:45] for John truly baptized with water but
[53:48] ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[53:50] not many days hence when they therefore
[53:53] were come together they asked of him
[53:56] saying saying Lord wilt thou at this
[53:59] time restore again the kingdom to Israel
[54:03] and he said unto them it's not for you
[54:05] to know the times or the seasons which
[54:08] the father hath put in his own power now
[54:11] I know that we all know it I'm sure in
[54:13] the church age book brother Bram talks
[54:15] about he couldn't tell them everything
[54:17] that was going to happen because there
[54:19] were seven full Church ages that had to
[54:20] be
[54:21] fulfilled and and if they knew the
[54:23] pressure and the trials that were going
[54:25] to come their way they probably would
[54:27] have fainted but they have the ability
[54:30] by his Spirit to withstand the
[54:32] Antichrist spirit in every single
[54:35] age you know we need to I I just want to
[54:38] try and encourage us I say we need to
[54:40] but I I just want to encourage us
[54:41] brothers and sisters to recognize the
[54:44] spirit of God recognize our brother and
[54:46] our sister not to be just our brother
[54:48] and our sister Holy Ghost filled
[54:50] Christian brother and sister the Lord
[54:53] Jesus Christ manifest in flesh the word
[54:56] made
[54:57] flesh that's the song that we sing We
[54:59] Are the word made flesh
[55:03] today that is what the scriptures say
[55:07] hallelujah so if we are this is the Lord
[55:11] Jesus Christ right here amen and I
[55:13] firmly believe it with all my heart
[55:15] brothers and sisters this is it this is
[55:16] the second coming of Jesus Christ the
[55:18] word coming of the Lord manifesting in
[55:22] his bride body and the world's looking
[55:24] for 60 foot Jesus but I want to say this
[55:27] is it right here brothers and sisters
[55:29] this is the Lord Jesus Christ right here
[55:31] let's discern his body properly tonight
[55:34] out of the Mighty God unveil 1964
[55:37] brother bradam says I was reading a
[55:39] story some years ago and in this story
[55:42] it said a great Noble King I forget the
[55:46] name of him just now I I wasn't thinking
[55:48] about speaking of the story it perhaps
[55:51] fiction but it leads us to a point that
[55:54] gives us a background on what we want
[55:56] want to
[55:57] say this King he was such a noble King
[56:01] and such a great lover of his subjects
[56:04] till one day before his guard and his
[56:07] royalty he said today you see me for the
[56:11] last time for many years right and his
[56:15] guard and his Noble said unto him good
[56:18] King why are you saying that are you
[56:21] going to a foreign country somewhere to
[56:24] become an alien he said said no I'm
[56:27] staying right here well said I'm I'm
[56:30] going out amongst my subjects I'm going
[56:33] to become a
[56:36] peasant I'm going to cut wood with the
[56:38] wood Chopper I'm going to the to the
[56:41] ground with a toiler I'm going to prune
[56:44] the vines with those who prune
[56:46] Vines I'm going to be one of them in
[56:49] order to get better acquainted with what
[56:52] they are doing amen and I love them
[56:57] and I want to be more acquainted with
[56:58] them
[57:01] personally I love the way he says it
[57:03] they won't know me but yet I want to be
[57:07] acquainted with them in that way and the
[57:11] next morning when his delegates all of
[57:12] his people seen him or the ones was in
[57:16] the palace take off his crown and lay it
[57:19] upon the seat the throne and take off
[57:21] his robe and put on peasants clothes
[57:24] walk out amongst the common people
[57:28] people excuse me now in that little
[57:31] story we find out then about
[57:34] God they said to the king king we want
[57:38] you we love you we want you to remain
[57:42] King but he wanted to become one of them
[57:46] to know them better that they would know
[57:49] him better really what he was it was it
[57:54] it would display to them what he really
[57:57] was and and that's what God did he
[58:00] changed himself from being Jehovah God
[58:03] to become one of
[58:05] us that he might
[58:08] suffer he might taste death he might
[58:12] know what the sting of death was and
[58:15] take the penalty of death upon
[58:19] himself I could just stop there and
[58:21] probably preach for a little while amen
[58:24] what a tremendous thing it is yes to
[58:27] think that he just stepped aside from
[58:30] all of his glory and came down and took
[58:31] the sting of death for
[58:35] us and not just the sting of death but
[58:38] total
[58:40] humiliation beat to a
[58:44] pulp he washed feet with the lowly he
[58:49] dwelt in the tents with the poor he
[58:52] slept in the woods and in the streets
[58:54] with those who were under
[58:56] privileged he become one of us that he
[59:00] might understand us
[59:02] better and that we might understand him
[59:06] better and to think that in all points
[59:09] that were tempted he was also
[59:12] tempted he came down so that he could
[59:15] actually intercede for us so that he
[59:19] could be the high priest of our
[59:24] confession so when we wash one another's
[59:26] feet brothers and sisters I just want to
[59:28] encourage
[59:29] us take the time and recognize what it
[59:33] is we're
[59:34] doing it is not a light thing it's not a
[59:38] simple tradition of the church this is
[59:41] absolutely an ordinance of God we have
[59:44] been given this
[59:45] instruction through the word of God and
[59:48] it's just so beautiful because the
[59:50] prophet in our day he just simply said
[59:52] get back in line get back to the word
[59:54] and stay in line and this is an
[59:56] ordinance that he gave if you do this
[59:59] happy are you if you do these things
[1:00:02] because you recognize the Lord Jesus
[1:00:04] Christ you discern his body and his body
[1:00:07] isn't just the wine and and and and the
[1:00:09] bread it's not just the body and the
[1:00:11] blood it's his feet
[1:00:14] also 1964 the presence of God
[1:00:19] unrecognized this is the story that we
[1:00:21] read tonight brother Bram talking about
[1:00:24] it Simon the
[1:00:26] Pharisee and the ill- famed
[1:00:30] woman but the city they didn't have no
[1:00:33] confidence in him at the Pharisees house
[1:00:36] he invited him
[1:00:38] down at Simon a Pharisee and and had met
[1:00:42] a great
[1:00:43] supper and Pharisee wanted to prove to
[1:00:46] them he was no Prophet
[1:00:49] I so he was back there toasting with his
[1:00:52] glasses and his goblets and all the
[1:00:56] perfumes in the house can you imagine
[1:00:58] that just making a mockery of God
[1:01:01] manifest in flesh it just reminds me of
[1:01:04] the king making a mockery of God in the
[1:01:08] day when we know there was a hand that
[1:01:11] came and rode on the wall and said you
[1:01:14] know what your time is over and that
[1:01:17] same God was right there in this man's
[1:01:21] house and he was mocking making toasts
[1:01:23] and and having fun at his expense
[1:01:26] right
[1:01:28] why and Jesus had got in a in a past the
[1:01:35] footwash flunky and had sat down there
[1:01:38] and dirty and stinky off the field on
[1:01:40] him where the animals had been along the
[1:01:43] path and his garments that's the reason
[1:01:46] they washed feet in them days and you
[1:01:49] see the first thing when you're invited
[1:01:51] to a home there in Palestine when they
[1:01:53] wore those sandals the first thing they
[1:01:55] did did was to wash your
[1:01:57] feet and then give you something to walk
[1:02:01] on their
[1:02:02] carpets the great Persian rugs and
[1:02:04] things was
[1:02:07] beautiful the next thing they done they
[1:02:09] give you some oil in your hand it's got
[1:02:12] out of a little apple that's found way
[1:02:14] in the mountain the rose Apple after the
[1:02:16] rose is gone it leaves the apple and
[1:02:19] fine perfumes and they rub it all over
[1:02:22] their face and that direct raise of the
[1:02:25] pales and son is is horrible and you see
[1:02:28] that creates an odor and and then when
[1:02:31] you do then the host comes to the door
[1:02:34] and he kisses them on the neck and makes
[1:02:36] them
[1:02:37] welcome how did them flunkies ever let
[1:02:40] Jesus get by without washing his feet or
[1:02:44] giving him oil to anoint himself or even
[1:02:47] kiss him
[1:02:48] welcome now brother Bram he doesn't even
[1:02:50] answer that he just asked the question
[1:02:52] but I can't help but think there was a
[1:02:54] direction by someone
[1:02:57] when this man comes through the door
[1:02:59] step
[1:03:00] aside maybe direct him to go and sit
[1:03:03] back over there so we can go and see him
[1:03:06] and make toast and mock him and and make
[1:03:08] fun of him and and then when we're done
[1:03:10] with that we'll just ignore him because
[1:03:13] we know he's no Prophet can you imagine
[1:03:15] that the direction that must have
[1:03:18] happened yeah because we know that this
[1:03:21] was the custom and we know that the
[1:03:23] footwash flunky would have been paid to
[1:03:26] stand there at the door that would have
[1:03:28] been his job to make sure every single
[1:03:30] person coming in can you imagine the the
[1:03:32] Palestinian rugs and the fine stuff they
[1:03:36] had inside the houses for the footwash
[1:03:38] flunky to let somebody come by with
[1:03:40] stinky animal dong on their feet and
[1:03:43] come in and spoil their party while
[1:03:45] they're going to eat they've got to
[1:03:46] smell this guy's stinky feet can you
[1:03:48] imagine
[1:03:50] that right there had to have been a
[1:03:52] direction to say leave this one alone
[1:03:55] because we're going to do something with
[1:03:56] him tonight and you know one day we'll
[1:03:59] see this man we'll see him stand before
[1:04:01] the white Throne of judgment and give an
[1:04:03] account for the actions that took
[1:04:06] place and I'm not saying I know that I'm
[1:04:09] an authority I'm just saying just
[1:04:11] logically it would almost make sense
[1:04:13] that that could be the case there was a
[1:04:14] direction from someone to say just leave
[1:04:16] this one alone we want to have some fun
[1:04:17] we want to mock him not knowing that
[1:04:19] this was the one that's going to execute
[1:04:21] judgment this was the one that's going
[1:04:23] to restore the Kingdom of Israel back
[1:04:26] but it just wasn't at the right time but
[1:04:28] we know in paragraph 90 here it says but
[1:04:30] there was a little prostitute out on the
[1:04:33] street and we know that prostitute is
[1:04:35] what we are brothers and sisters that is
[1:04:37] an example of every single human being
[1:04:40] that accepts Jesus Christ as their
[1:04:42] savior all them religionists there now
[1:04:46] the whole company did not recognize him
[1:04:49] and a little woman of ill Fame she
[1:04:52] looked in through perhaps the gate and
[1:04:55] she seen him sitting like a Wallflower
[1:04:58] that's the way he is today amongst a
[1:05:01] bunch of religious too a Wallflower
[1:05:04] unwelcome unwanted filthy dirty Holy
[1:05:08] Roller they call it some kind of a a
[1:05:11] person that isn't in their right mind a
[1:05:13] fortune teller mental telepathy or some
[1:05:15] kind of an evil name and Jesus I'll get
[1:05:19] to it in a few minutes said speak a word
[1:05:23] against the son of man it shall be for
[1:05:25] forgiven you oh but when the Holy Ghost
[1:05:27] has come to do the same thing one word
[1:05:31] will never be forgiven you
[1:05:34] see remember whose feet you're washing
[1:05:36] tonight brothers and sisters but there
[1:05:39] in that little woman there that little
[1:05:41] woman seen he needed service and she
[1:05:46] rushed in real quickly went and got an
[1:05:48] alabaster box full of oil probably had
[1:05:51] bought it with the money from her
[1:05:54] prostitution
[1:05:57] can you imagine that but what was
[1:06:00] it she might have thought he is a
[1:06:03] prophet but I I remember another woman
[1:06:06] in my fix another character like mine
[1:06:08] she had the opportunity and she
[1:06:10] recognized him and she was forgiven up
[1:06:13] there at the well of sikar last night we
[1:06:15] talked of it and and if I could only get
[1:06:17] to him I know who he is I'll do him a
[1:06:20] service if the rest of them I I don't
[1:06:23] care what they do I'll do him a service
[1:06:26] I'll recognize he's the son of
[1:06:29] God she got a
[1:06:32] revelation and when that Revelation hit
[1:06:34] her heart there was nothing going to
[1:06:36] stop her from it was there she run in
[1:06:38] she got real close to him she felt so
[1:06:41] guilty that's the way a real penitent
[1:06:44] sinner feels in his presence guilty and
[1:06:48] the tears began to fall and she was
[1:06:51] trying to hide them they they dropped on
[1:06:53] his feet she was going to anoint him but
[1:06:56] the tears dropping on his feet can you
[1:06:59] imagine the
[1:07:00] scenario she got to the place where she
[1:07:02] couldn't even control
[1:07:04] herself what she wanted to do she
[1:07:07] couldn't even do the only thing she
[1:07:08] could do was drop to his feet humble
[1:07:11] herself completely and totally At His
[1:07:14] Feet just a mess in tears at his feet
[1:07:20] and she began to wipe them and crying
[1:07:22] and wiping them with her hands and and
[1:07:25] his his feet was all getting mused up
[1:07:28] with the dirt that was on it and if you
[1:07:30] want to really believe it the stink of
[1:07:32] the animals off the trail everyone
[1:07:33] walked the same Trail and there it was
[1:07:36] the stink on him sitting there and her
[1:07:39] tears was dropping on his feet and she
[1:07:41] was trying to wipe them off and she had
[1:07:44] no
[1:07:45] towel and you know the rest of the story
[1:07:47] her hair was there she used the covering
[1:07:50] that he gave her that God gave her she
[1:07:53] was probably raised in a Christian home
[1:07:55] and she knew that was her covering and
[1:07:58] that hair is what she used to wipe those
[1:08:00] tears and that stink off his feet and
[1:08:04] and to use that ointment that she
[1:08:05] probably got from her ill Fame but here
[1:08:08] we have this one who was going to
[1:08:11] execute judgment what did he do he said
[1:08:13] your sins are forgiven you he did not
[1:08:16] judge her for it he judged the
[1:08:19] fery the religious one the one that was
[1:08:22] all puffed up saying hey man I'm all
[1:08:24] good everything that I do in my life is
[1:08:26] perfect I've never sinned in my life we
[1:08:29] don't ever want to get there brothers
[1:08:31] and sisters the moment we get there it's
[1:08:33] just like the
[1:08:34] Pharisee tonight I just want to
[1:08:36] encourage us as we go forwards I want to
[1:08:39] study this a little further but think
[1:08:41] about it whose feet are you really
[1:08:42] washing tonight it is not just something
[1:08:46] that we do out of tradition it's not
[1:08:48] just something that's just an ordinance
[1:08:49] given by William Mary and bradam Jesus
[1:08:51] Christ said this to his
[1:08:54] friends happy happy are ye if you do
[1:08:56] these things and he is the one that led
[1:09:00] by example he didn't just go out and say
[1:09:02] go do this he showed them what to do and
[1:09:06] then he said go do it so God richly
[1:09:08] bless you tonight I just I I'll change
[1:09:11] the order of the service tonight we will
[1:09:13] go to the communion table we will talk
[1:09:16] in the future about communion we'll talk
[1:09:18] about the Lord's body Discerning the
[1:09:20] Lord's body there's so much in there I I
[1:09:23] really don't want to preach a a big
[1:09:25] sermon every time we have a communion
[1:09:26] service I just want to have a little
[1:09:28] exhortation to stimulate us to really
[1:09:31] think about what we're doing because the
[1:09:34] there's so much in a service like this
[1:09:35] tonight so maybe stand with me if you
[1:09:38] will and we'll just call the musician
[1:09:40] and and uh the brothers to come to the
[1:09:43] front and we'll just change the order of
[1:09:46] the service we'll go ahead and
[1:09:49] read from 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:09:54] 11
[1:10:10] 1 Corinthians 11 verse
[1:10:14] 23 for I have received of the
[1:10:18] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:10:22] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:10:25] in which he was betrayed took
[1:10:28] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:10:30] break
[1:10:31] it and said take eat this is my body
[1:10:37] which is broken for
[1:10:38] you this do in remembrance of
[1:10:42] me after the same manner also he took
[1:10:45] the cup when he had SED saying this cup
[1:10:49] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[1:10:52] ye as often as you drink it in
[1:10:54] remembrance of
[1:10:56] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:10:59] and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's
[1:11:03] death till he
[1:11:05] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:11:08] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:11:12] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:11:16] and blood of the
[1:11:17] Lord but let a man examine himself and
[1:11:21] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:11:23] of that cup
[1:11:25] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:11:27] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:11:30] to
[1:11:32] himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:11:35] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:11:40] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:11:44] we should judge ourselves we should not
[1:11:46] be judged but when we are judged we are
[1:11:49] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:11:52] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:11:56] brethren when ye come together to eat t
[1:12:00] one for
[1:12:01] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:12:04] eat at home that he come not together
[1:12:07] unto condemnation and the rest will I
[1:12:11] set in order when I
[1:12:14] come let's just take a moment or two and
[1:12:17] T one for another before we
[1:12:24] proceed
[1:12:38] [Music]
