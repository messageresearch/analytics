[1:00:50] this morning talking about your word
[1:00:52] being your will father I pray that
[1:00:54] scriptures that we've read would just
[1:00:57] resonate in our hearts Lord that we
[1:00:58] would understand that you have never
[1:01:00] left us nor forsaken us and it's always
[1:01:04] us father that leaves you and father I
[1:01:07] pray that if anybody needs to come back

[1:01:36] bless you this morning you may be
[1:01:39] seated welcome everyone some people
[1:01:43] might be wondering what's going on it's
[1:01:45] June the 2nd and brother Dela delodon
[1:01:48] isn't here it's brother Barry again and
[1:01:51] uh I I just got notied this week that
[1:01:54] brother Dela he had a holdup with his
[1:01:58] passports uh something to do with his US
[1:02:00] Visa and they took his passports to
[1:02:03] process it and he wasn't able to get it
[1:02:05] back and so it it's the natural
[1:02:07] circumstances but we know full well that
[1:02:09] God never wanted him here today or he
[1:02:12] would be right here today that's just
[1:02:14] the way God works so we certainly thank
[1:02:17] the Lord for his leadership and his
[1:02:19] guidance and uh we just said to brother
[1:02:22] Dela you know when the Lord works it out
[1:02:24] we'd certainly love to have him come um
[1:02:27] his schedule is absolutely full and uh
[1:02:30] I'm sure that as you know if you
[1:02:33] understand what traveling Ministry is
[1:02:35] like when you make arrangements um it's
[1:02:38] like a stack of dominoes and if you take
[1:02:41] one Domino out it makes it just about
[1:02:43] impossible for the rest of them to work
[1:02:45] and God just decided that this wouldn't
[1:02:47] work for him so his schedule is booked
[1:02:49] and uh we may or may not see him this
[1:02:51] Summer we'll just see what the Lord has
[1:02:53] in store so that's why brother Barry's
[1:02:54] here today and not brother Dela I do
[1:02:57] apologize for anyone that might be
[1:02:58] confused or if anybody came specifically
[1:03:00] to see brother Dela I do apologize but I
[1:03:03] hope you didn't come to see brother Dell
[1:03:05] I hope you came to see the Lord because
[1:03:07] that's why we gather together you don't
[1:03:09] want to gather together to see a man if
[1:03:11] that's the only reason you come you come
[1:03:12] for the wrong reason because a man will
[1:03:14] always disappoint always disappoint it's
[1:03:18] only God that can make the difference in
[1:03:19] our
[1:03:20] lives we have a a prayer meeting June
[1:03:22] the 6th at 7:30 p.m. we have a church
[1:03:25] cleanup next Saturday I believe it is
[1:03:27] June the 8th and I think we'll probably
[1:03:30] did we have a time 10:00 that's okay if
[1:03:33] you want to come a little bit early
[1:03:34] that's fine too there's usually always
[1:03:36] coffee and we can have a little bit of
[1:03:37] fellowship before we start to sweat uh
[1:03:40] remember many hands make light work it's
[1:03:43] not just one or two persons that make
[1:03:46] this happen it is everyone it's a many
[1:03:48] membered body so we appreciate all the
[1:03:49] help we can get uh we have brother marot
[1:03:52] Chua here on June the 9th we certainly
[1:03:54] look forward to seeing him and family I
[1:03:56] believe will be here as well um we have
[1:03:58] a worship service on June 23rd at 6:
[1:04:01] p.m. so uh we just just definitely want
[1:04:04] to encourage anybody that has a desire
[1:04:05] to sing a special and uh if you want to
[1:04:07] come and just worship God by all means
[1:04:10] come show the devil whose side you're on
[1:04:14] we don't need to preach we can just sing
[1:04:15] unto the Lord and it doesn't have to be
[1:04:18] uh all specials it can just be
[1:04:21] congregational worship unto God but
[1:04:23] maybe a few specials mixed in is is a
[1:04:26] real good thing that's kind of what I
[1:04:27] would like to see but we'll just let it
[1:04:29] happen the way the Lord wants it to uh
[1:04:32] we have brother Cadre digs here on June
[1:04:34] 26th and we have the the youth service
[1:04:37] the youth function uh June the 30th at
[1:04:40] our house after the service on Sunday
[1:04:44] and uh it looks like I did it again I do
[1:04:47] apologize on the 12th we have uh brother
[1:04:50] Jack Duff but this time I caught it it's
[1:04:53] in June it's not July I was saying July
[1:04:56] so it's a busy month with uh different
[1:04:58] ministers but certainly look forward to
[1:05:01] seeing each and every one of them you
[1:05:03] happy this
[1:05:06] morning we've been talking about his
[1:05:08] will being his word and we've had a a
[1:05:10] tremendous study so far this is part
[1:05:13] seven of I don't know how many in a
[1:05:15] series but um it's just been a a
[1:05:18] wonderful discussion about his will
[1:05:21] being his word and just from a specific
[1:05:23] angle that I believe the Lord has shown
[1:05:24] me about it and uh sometimes it's just a
[1:05:28] good thing to to recognize that his will
[1:05:31] is very important but many times it can
[1:05:34] be over complicated it can become a
[1:05:36] complex sometimes almost like an
[1:05:38] algebraic equation and that's just
[1:05:41] exactly the way the devil likes it to be
[1:05:43] doesn't he he likes it to become
[1:05:44] confusing he likes us to wonder he likes
[1:05:46] us to ask are we in God's will is this
[1:05:50] really the direction that I should be
[1:05:51] going is this really the life I should
[1:05:52] be living God knows exactly where we are
[1:05:54] he knows exactly who our name what our
[1:05:56] name is he knows our parents he knows
[1:05:59] all about us many times we just need to
[1:06:02] learn about ourselves but you know uh
[1:06:04] the angle that I'm taking this from is
[1:06:06] that his will is his word and it's not a
[1:06:09] destination I've said it in the past we
[1:06:10] talked about Joseph studyed Joseph's
[1:06:12] life and now we're into Daniel and
[1:06:15] Daniel's life and his will it it's not
[1:06:19] just his word and and saying that it's
[1:06:22] his will is his word um I'm I'm wording
[1:06:25] this wrong it's not just a destination
[1:06:27] his will isn't whether we should go to
[1:06:29] university and get a University degree e
[1:06:32] even though if we're aspiring to do that
[1:06:34] we really ought to see if that's what
[1:06:36] God wants us to do and we ought to
[1:06:39] commit all of our ways unto the Lord if
[1:06:41] we should go to a specific church we
[1:06:44] should see if that's God's will for us
[1:06:47] and there's going to be one resounding
[1:06:48] way to tell whether that's God's will
[1:06:50] for our life does the preaching at that
[1:06:54] church line up with the message of the
[1:06:56] hour if it doesn't line up with the
[1:06:58] message of the hour I strongly recommend
[1:07:00] that you don't go to that church because
[1:07:02] it's not going to send you to the right
[1:07:04] destination but his will is his word but
[1:07:08] it's not necessarily a destination it's
[1:07:10] not necessarily a place that we're going
[1:07:11] to travel to I want to go and travel to
[1:07:14] Vancouver should it be God's will for me
[1:07:16] to go and we know the word of God don't
[1:07:18] get me wrong says Lord willing we ought
[1:07:21] to say we should do this or we should do
[1:07:23] that that means we should be considering
[1:07:25] God in all of our ways but it's not
[1:07:28] necessarily where we're at or where
[1:07:30] we're going that's not where we're
[1:07:32] getting at when we talk about his will
[1:07:34] being his word it's not where we're at
[1:07:36] it's not where we're going I want to say
[1:07:37] this brothers and sisters it's who we
[1:07:39] are it's who we are do you have his word
[1:07:44] in your heart that you might not sin
[1:07:47] against him many times we look at that
[1:07:49] scripture I think that's a lovely Sunday
[1:07:51] school scripture isn't it it's a great
[1:07:54] memory verse for children we learn that
[1:07:56] as a child and we take it home and we
[1:07:58] think about it and many times we can
[1:08:00] just take these verses and and put them
[1:08:02] away in our pocket and say yeah I know
[1:08:03] that verse yeah Psalms 1119 yep it's
[1:08:06] great with Thy word have I hid in my
[1:08:08] heart that I might not sin against thee
[1:08:09] but let's just examine that scripture a
[1:08:11] little bit maybe try and unpack it Lord
[1:08:13] willing by the the Holy Spirit today by
[1:08:16] the Holy Ghost to see really are we
[1:08:19] hiding his word in our heart according
[1:08:21] to the message of the hour many people
[1:08:23] will take his word and put it in their
[1:08:25] heart and there'll be theologians about
[1:08:27] the Bible but they can't follow that
[1:08:30] Bible the only way we're going to be
[1:08:32] able to have his word in our heart truly
[1:08:35] is to have himself in our heart today
[1:08:38] brothers and sisters many people claim
[1:08:41] it but not many people can say I can
[1:08:43] actually follow all of the word because
[1:08:46] his will is his word amen and many
[1:08:51] people will say well we've got all the
[1:08:53] word we're we're a we're a
[1:08:56] uh oh my we're we're a Full Gospel
[1:09:00] Ministry aren't we we have the whole
[1:09:02] Bible we preach the whole Bible
[1:09:05] according to our religion according to
[1:09:07] our
[1:09:08] tradition but it's not about where we're
[1:09:10] going it's not about where we've been
[1:09:12] necessarily and it's not about what
[1:09:14] we're going to be it's who we are right
[1:09:16] now brothers and sisters it's it's it's
[1:09:18] the present tense I am he is the I am
[1:09:22] every moment of our life is God living
[1:09:25] out through us and and it's who we are
[1:09:27] and I I I just we we prayed about it
[1:09:29] this morning and I just can't help but
[1:09:31] come back to that and think I want to
[1:09:33] impress in our hearts when we when we
[1:09:34] hear the words this morning when we
[1:09:36] think about his will being his word
[1:09:38] we're not just ordinary people we are a
[1:09:40] special class of people we're a
[1:09:41] prophetic class of people because we've
[1:09:43] been given the ability to hear the
[1:09:44] message of the hour the words of God
[1:09:47] given to a Vindicated profit to this age
[1:09:51] this is something that we cannot just
[1:09:52] Overlook and take for granted and say
[1:09:54] you know I I I know the message I I I've
[1:09:56] got the prophet I I've got all the books
[1:09:58] and tapes I've even got the app on my
[1:10:00] phone well good for us right what good
[1:10:02] does it do it if we don't live it he
[1:10:05] gave very specific instructions and
[1:10:07] brothers and sisters when we try and
[1:10:09] interpret that word when we try and
[1:10:11] interpret what the prophet said to us
[1:10:13] and make it suit Our Lives my goodness
[1:10:17] you know what we're doing we're heading
[1:10:18] down the road of balum and baac we're
[1:10:21] going to take God's word now and try and
[1:10:24] adapt it to suit Our Lives instead of
[1:10:27] taking our lives and trying to adapt it
[1:10:30] to suit God's word there's a major
[1:10:32] difference there oh my but the devil is
[1:10:35] so subtle so subtle he'll say well our
[1:10:38] parents did that and they got away with
[1:10:40] it everything was fine for them was
[1:10:43] it is
[1:10:45] it it's not about them this is about
[1:10:49] us the present tense I am and you know
[1:10:52] what I want to do is impress on us
[1:10:54] brothers and sister sisters that we if
[1:10:56] we have the ability to hear this message
[1:10:57] of the hour if we have the ability to
[1:10:59] receive it all even when it takes our
[1:11:02] hide off doesn't feel good you know what
[1:11:04] we are we are the manifested sons and
[1:11:08] daughters of the most high God living
[1:11:10] out in this age that makes us
[1:11:12] automatically that special class of
[1:11:15] people that prophetic group of people
[1:11:17] that can hear what the spirit says to
[1:11:19] the age not everyone has that
[1:11:23] ability but you know as we go forwards
[1:11:26] we want his perfect will and I I'm I'm
[1:11:29] I'm going to get into his perfect will
[1:11:32] versus his permissive will but maybe not
[1:11:36] so much today as we go we're going to
[1:11:38] get into Daniel we're going to pick up
[1:11:39] where we left off last time I think it's
[1:11:41] so incredible the story but maybe it's
[1:11:45] just me I don't know but we do have a
[1:11:48] perfect will of God and we have a
[1:11:51] permissive will of God and if you look
[1:11:53] it up in the message brother bradam he
[1:11:54] uses it over and over again he talks
[1:11:57] about balum and baac and the perfect
[1:12:00] will of God and the permissive will of
[1:12:03] God and many times God will just give us
[1:12:05] over he'll say you know what you've
[1:12:07] asked me and I know your heart's desire
[1:12:09] you just want to go ahead and do that
[1:12:10] thing anyway so I'm just going to say
[1:12:12] God bless you go ahead and do your thing
[1:12:15] don't worry about it just help yourself
[1:12:18] but that doesn't change God's will his
[1:12:21] first answer is his only answer
[1:12:25] it's not going to change the more we
[1:12:27] pray to him and say I just really want
[1:12:29] to do this thing I wish you would allow
[1:12:31] me to do this thing it's not the way it
[1:12:33] works out of the handwriting on the wall
[1:12:39] 1956 I read this last week I just wanted
[1:12:42] to pick up as sort of
[1:12:45] a picking up where we left off the
[1:12:49] recap just have a few visitors here
[1:12:53] today I just wanted to welcome brother
[1:12:54] Kenneth Sister Irene and Shir they're
[1:12:57] friends of brother Peter and Sister
[1:12:58] Janet from Ghana God bless you
[1:13:07] today and we have some other visitors
[1:13:10] from Nigeria I I hope I say this right
[1:13:12] forgive me if I don't and Dam dami and
[1:13:15] AD from Nigeria God bless you I'm not
[1:13:19] sure where everyone's at
[1:13:21] today I trust you feel right at home
[1:13:25] you have the quotes brother you do amen
[1:13:30] 1956 the handwriting on the wall brother
[1:13:32] brandham speaking here he says now I
[1:13:33] want you to notice as soon as the king
[1:13:36] saw this Vision talking about
[1:13:40] Nebuchadnezzar we're going to get into
[1:13:41] this uh notice as soon as the king saw
[1:13:45] this vision and he made it he forced
[1:13:47] every person in his kingdom in his
[1:13:49] domain to worship this image he made an
[1:13:53] image we're going to get into the image
[1:13:55] that's where we left off last week he
[1:13:57] made an image and it's believed by
[1:14:00] scholars in which I do believe that a
[1:14:03] spirit filled person would see it that
[1:14:04] he worshiped Daniel that was the image
[1:14:07] that he created theologians will uh say
[1:14:11] that when we went to Bible College they
[1:14:12] taught us that that was an image of
[1:14:14] Nebuchadnezzar because he was such a
[1:14:16] narcissistic King but if you go and you
[1:14:18] read the scriptures it does not one time
[1:14:20] say that was an image of Nebuchadnezzar
[1:14:24] and if you look at the Scripture it
[1:14:26] follows directly after Daniel was used
[1:14:30] by God to give the interpretation of the
[1:14:33] dream that this King had first God gave
[1:14:35] the king the dream let's be clear and
[1:14:39] then God gave the ability to interpret
[1:14:41] the dream and and and we know that
[1:14:43] that's what uh he did here but he says I
[1:14:44] do believe that a Spirit-filled person
[1:14:46] would see it that that he worshiped
[1:14:47] Daniel is what he did and he made an
[1:14:50] image to Daniel and he called it
[1:14:53] belthazar
[1:14:55] he called Daniel
[1:14:57] belshazzar which is the name of his God
[1:15:00] and he made an image and forced every
[1:15:04] person to worship that image he says I
[1:15:08] want you to notice that the beginning of
[1:15:09] the Gentiles when God dwelt with dealt
[1:15:11] with them they got hottie in their heart
[1:15:15] and forced every man to worship the
[1:15:18] image of a holy
[1:15:20] man and the Gentile age was issued in
[1:15:23] with that it will go out in the same way
[1:15:26] the same way a boycott of the mark of
[1:15:29] the beast that will force the people to
[1:15:32] worship
[1:15:34] images and to do the things that we've
[1:15:37] been taught that was contrary to the
[1:15:39] word of
[1:15:40] God now I believe that that little tiny
[1:15:43] sentence there kind of almost lands in a
[1:15:47] space of
[1:15:48] time
[1:15:50] right that will force people to worship
[1:15:53] images and to do things that we've been
[1:15:56] taught was contrary to the word of
[1:16:00] God and brother it'll be so slick and
[1:16:04] Sly until it will deceive the very elect
[1:16:09] if
[1:16:10] possible so I just want to I just want
[1:16:13] to pause here and talk about this for a
[1:16:15] little bit brothers and sisters this to
[1:16:17] me would indicate this isn't going to be
[1:16:19] out there in the world this isn't going
[1:16:21] to be raging monsters it's not going to
[1:16:23] be a zombie apocalypse is not going to
[1:16:25] be all of the mark of the beast coming
[1:16:27] and rounding up people and putting them
[1:16:29] into internment camps and making them
[1:16:31] March through and get the mark of the
[1:16:32] beast and if they refuse it then they
[1:16:33] get killed all of that could happen and
[1:16:36] likely will somewhere along the way but
[1:16:38] what we're talking about is the
[1:16:40] spiritual coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:42] Christ and to reject that which is the
[1:16:45] word from a Vindicated prophet in our
[1:16:47] day to reject that is to accept
[1:16:49] automatically spiritually the mark of
[1:16:52] the beast we had this prophet say that
[1:16:55] the thought in the forehead is the mark
[1:16:58] in the forehead and then to take that
[1:17:00] Mark and actually make it apply to the
[1:17:03] movement in our hands is the action part
[1:17:06] of it and so we have the mark in our
[1:17:08] forehead and then we have the mark on
[1:17:10] our hand our action towards it and I
[1:17:13] want to say today brothers and sisters
[1:17:15] don't think that the devil isn't Sly
[1:17:16] enough to say and and take this word and
[1:17:19] mix it up so far in our lives it's not
[1:17:22] just the action of doing something
[1:17:25] against the word of God many times we
[1:17:26] can look at people and say oh they went
[1:17:28] created an awful website and they
[1:17:30] created all of the things and they're
[1:17:31] all against the word of God I want to
[1:17:33] say this brothers and sisters in action
[1:17:36] to live according to the message of the
[1:17:38] hour is the same thing the devil don't
[1:17:41] care what side of the road you go off on
[1:17:44] but we know remember there is a Highway
[1:17:47] and there is a holy way down the middle
[1:17:50] of the highway that brother Bram talked
[1:17:52] about it's in the word of God we know
[1:17:53] that but in action in action according
[1:17:57] to this word of God is going to be
[1:17:58] counted exactly the
[1:18:00] same as coming against the word of God
[1:18:04] because it would have been better for us
[1:18:05] not to have known about the message of
[1:18:07] the hour than to hear it and then claim
[1:18:11] it and then not live it right Lord have
[1:18:16] mercy and brother it'll be so slick and
[1:18:21] Sly until it will deceive the very elect
[1:18:24] if possible all so where is it going to
[1:18:26] be brothers and sisters in the Baptist
[1:18:28] denomination how many elect are in there
[1:18:31] maybe Lots probably not lots because
[1:18:35] they're willing to cling to a
[1:18:38] denominational
[1:18:39] teaching who knows we know brother
[1:18:42] bradam said that there's Believers in
[1:18:44] every group and it's not up to us to put
[1:18:47] people in or take people out it's up to
[1:18:49] God to
[1:18:51] judge
[1:18:52] but I want to say this it'll be so slick
[1:18:55] and Sly till it will deceive the very
[1:18:57] elect if it were possible so you better
[1:18:59] purpose in your heart tonight this
[1:19:02] morning and be filled with God's holy
[1:19:05] spirit that you'll be able to discern
[1:19:08] the right and the wrong thing when the
[1:19:10] proclamation is issued Hallelujah cuz
[1:19:13] remember brothers and sisters we don't
[1:19:15] know what what what 10 minutes after
[1:19:17] service is going to hold for us we don't
[1:19:20] know what tomorrow has in store and when
[1:19:22] those times come in our lives we don't
[1:19:24] don't have time to
[1:19:26] pray it's too late our praying time is
[1:19:30] over we've already had the opportunity
[1:19:33] to show where we
[1:19:37] stand he says when we see all the Easter
[1:19:40] remember this is my what year is this
[1:19:45] 1956 1956 when we see all the Eastern
[1:19:49] Middle Eastern Powers when we see the
[1:19:51] eastern and western world again again
[1:19:55] uniting see them two feet in Daniel's
[1:19:58] Vision see it's just repeating again
[1:20:00] it's just a Revival of the old Roman
[1:20:02] Empire coming up as certain as I'm
[1:20:04] standing here it's true it's time for
[1:20:08] Daniels to
[1:20:10] rise it's time for Daniels to rise it's
[1:20:15] time for people who will purpose in
[1:20:17] their heart that they'll live true to
[1:20:20] God Amen and to the Holy Spirit and to
[1:20:24] the principles of the Bible regardless
[1:20:27] of rest of what the rest of the world
[1:20:29] will say and and brother Barry is going
[1:20:31] to throw this in here this morning
[1:20:32] brothers and sisters it's time for
[1:20:34] people who will purpose in their heart
[1:20:36] that they'll live true to God and true
[1:20:38] to the Holy Spirit and to the principles
[1:20:41] of the Bible and to the principles of
[1:20:44] the message of the
[1:20:46] hour regardless of what the rest of the
[1:20:48] world says it doesn't matter what
[1:20:50] anybody else says what anybody else does
[1:20:54] amen because God's not going to say
[1:20:57] oh you you heard about the message of
[1:20:59] the hour didn't you yep
[1:21:04] but your brother or your sister they
[1:21:06] just didn't like it and and so they
[1:21:08] talked bad about the the minister and
[1:21:11] you you just sort of sided with them and
[1:21:14] you didn't really take a stand and
[1:21:16] because of that you couldn't really live
[1:21:18] according to it either so that's okay
[1:21:20] don't worry about it it's not going to
[1:21:21] be that way it's not going to ask about
[1:21:23] anybody else's experience except for
[1:21:26] ours we're going to stand before him and
[1:21:29] give an account for our
[1:21:31] lives and we know Paul said Lord don't
[1:21:35] let us do it with
[1:21:36] shame let us do it with
[1:21:39] joy that we could count it all joy that
[1:21:42] we know people actually were able to
[1:21:44] receive the word you know receiving the
[1:21:46] word is one thing but living it is a
[1:21:48] totally different thing it's a totally
[1:21:50] different thing brothers and sisters
[1:21:51] we're not we're not running a sprinting
[1:21:53] race this is not something that we can
[1:21:56] just have uh uh
[1:21:59] uh oh my former Pastor said it so I'm
[1:22:02] I'm just going to say it it's not bad A
[1:22:04] A Hallelujah H holdown we were right
[1:22:07] downtown with the Stampede you know we
[1:22:09] can have a great Revival today and just
[1:22:12] be out in the world tomorrow what does
[1:22:18] that by not getting sealed
[1:22:21] in by the holy spirit in our lives
[1:22:24] we're talking about the perfect will
[1:22:26] versus the permissive will from the
[1:22:28] angle of Daniel turn turn with me over
[1:22:30] to Daniel chapter
[1:22:32] 3 as we get into the the study
[1:22:40] today I do want to get into a real
[1:22:43] specific study maybe next time next week
[1:22:47] we get to do this it will be definitely
[1:22:49] about the perfect will versus the
[1:22:51] permissive
[1:22:53] will we know that in in Daniel chapter 2
[1:22:56] was the story of the dream and the image
[1:22:59] and uh how King Nebuchadnezzar erected
[1:23:03] an image and we know that that image was
[1:23:07] of
[1:23:14] Daniel Daniel chter
[1:23:16] 3:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an
[1:23:20] image of gold whose height was three
[1:23:23] score cubits and a bread
[1:23:25] thereof six cubits and he set it up in
[1:23:30] the plain of dura in the province of
[1:23:33] Babylon then Nebuchadnezzar the king
[1:23:36] sent to gather together the princes the
[1:23:37] governors the captains the judges the
[1:23:39] treasurers the counselors the sheriffs
[1:23:41] and all the rulers of the provinces to
[1:23:44] come to the dedication of the image
[1:23:47] which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
[1:23:50] then the princes the governors the
[1:23:52] captains the judges the treasurers the
[1:23:53] counselors the sheriffs and all the
[1:23:55] rulers of the provinces were gathered
[1:23:58] together unto the dedication of the
[1:23:59] image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had
[1:24:02] set up and they stood before the image
[1:24:06] that Nebuchadnezzar had set up then a
[1:24:10] heral cried aloud to you it is commanded
[1:24:13] oh people Nations and
[1:24:15] languages that at what time ye hear the
[1:24:18] sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbut
[1:24:21] Sury duler and all kinds of music ye
[1:24:24] Fall Down and Worship the golden image
[1:24:27] that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up
[1:24:31] and who so fth not down and
[1:24:34] worshipthe same hour be cast into the
[1:24:37] midst of a burning fiery
[1:24:40] furnace therefore at that time when all
[1:24:43] the people heard the sound of the Cornet
[1:24:44] flute harp sackbut Sal tree and all
[1:24:46] kinds of music all the people the
[1:24:49] Nations and the languages fell down and
[1:24:52] worshiped the golden image that
[1:24:56] Nebuchadnezzar the king had set
[1:24:59] up so we can see the story is set up now
[1:25:04] the image has been erected it's been
[1:25:07] raised and it's there for a purpose
[1:25:10] Daniel showed something tremendously
[1:25:13] Supernatural something that all of his
[1:25:15] magicians and Sorcerers and and advisers
[1:25:19] all of his committees they could never
[1:25:20] do and they even admitted it no man can
[1:25:22] do what you're saying to do remember he
[1:25:24] said I've got this dream and I need to
[1:25:26] know what's the interpretation of this
[1:25:28] dream and they came and they said oh
[1:25:29] King just tell us what the dream is and
[1:25:31] we'll be happy to give you the
[1:25:32] interpretation he said no you tell me
[1:25:35] the dream and then I'll know you
[1:25:37] actually are able to do the
[1:25:38] interpretation of it but if you can't
[1:25:40] tell me the dream then you know what
[1:25:42] you're going to be cut into pieces and
[1:25:43] your houses will be dung Hills what a
[1:25:46] terrible thing for those people and you
[1:25:48] can see that he was probably fed up with
[1:25:51] them and and he was troubled by this and
[1:25:53] and this is where I just think it's so
[1:25:54] beautiful we know this was God actually
[1:25:57] giving him a directive so that he would
[1:26:00] know exactly that God is over top of all
[1:26:03] of the Affairs of man that it wasn't
[1:26:05] just something
[1:26:07] surprising verse 8 says wherefore at the
[1:26:10] time certain calans came near and
[1:26:13] accused the
[1:26:14] Jews you can imagine in this situation
[1:26:18] how we have the kingdom and I think we
[1:26:21] talked about this in the past I'll try
[1:26:22] and get through it quickly but how had
[1:26:24] the kingdom and how all these people
[1:26:26] grew up in this Kingdom and worked their
[1:26:29] way up in the kingdom and made
[1:26:31] themselves uh politicians and followers
[1:26:35] and and all of the king's people they
[1:26:38] did everything they were taught to do
[1:26:39] they were trained up to serve the king
[1:26:42] to get high-ranking positions in the
[1:26:46] kingdom and we could even say what it is
[1:26:50] princes Governors captains judges the
[1:26:54] treasurers the counselors of the
[1:26:56] sheriffs the sheriffs and the rulers of
[1:26:59] all the provinces so this is everyone
[1:27:02] with a position in the country in
[1:27:04] Nebuchadnezzar's Kingdom but all these
[1:27:06] people witnessed all of the children
[1:27:09] being taken out of the land of Israel
[1:27:11] brought in as captives and suddenly now
[1:27:14] this one Daniel Rises to the top above
[1:27:18] everyone else suddenly this king is
[1:27:21] esteeming these guys this one in
[1:27:23] particular and he's bringing his friends
[1:27:25] along with him to one of the highest not
[1:27:28] just one of the highest but the highest
[1:27:30] position in the kingdom and isn't it
[1:27:32] interesting it's just like Joseph rising
[1:27:35] to the right hand of pharaoh where
[1:27:37] Pharaoh said you know what everything in
[1:27:39] the kingdom is yours you've got access
[1:27:41] to everything here the only thing is
[1:27:44] this Throne is mine but everything else
[1:27:47] is in your hands and here we have Daniel
[1:27:49] now rising to a place like that because
[1:27:52] of God
[1:27:54] yes not because he studied the Bible
[1:27:56] necessarily not because he had good
[1:27:58] church attendance not because of
[1:28:00] anything that he did other than he would
[1:28:02] not compromise on the word of God in his
[1:28:04] life and because of that we know that
[1:28:07] when the king made the pro Proclamation
[1:28:09] everyone's going to die he said wait
[1:28:11] you're being a little bit Hasty let's
[1:28:13] just do something about this let's just
[1:28:15] go and pray about it and what a what a
[1:28:17] tremendous thing that is even for the
[1:28:19] little things in our lives brothers and
[1:28:20] sisters to just pause for a second and
[1:28:22] just go and pray about it and and see
[1:28:24] what God has to say but many times we
[1:28:26] can trip over ourselves trying to find
[1:28:28] an answer for a solution that God's
[1:28:29] waiting to give
[1:28:31] us so Daniel he takes his friends and
[1:28:35] goes and prays about it comes back gives
[1:28:36] the interpretation we know the whole
[1:28:38] story but what what happened was he was
[1:28:41] elevated because of it to the place now
[1:28:43] you could imagine all of these guys
[1:28:45] lived their whole lives to get to this
[1:28:47] place we heard brother brandham say very
[1:28:49] clearly that that statue was an image of
[1:28:53] Daniel 60 foot Daniel raised up in the
[1:28:56] plains of dura and now all of these guys
[1:28:59] have to bow down to this guy he's a
[1:29:04] captive but now they're worshiping not
[1:29:06] just bowing down but Bow Down and
[1:29:08] Worship when you hear the sound of all
[1:29:11] of that it's a beautiful thing when you
[1:29:12] think about it because this King was
[1:29:15] extreme he wasn't interested in just
[1:29:17] going part way he was All or Nothing
[1:29:21] wasn't
[1:29:22] he King
[1:29:25] Nebuchadnezzar but I can't help but
[1:29:27] think he he actually was tapping into
[1:29:29] something he was seeing something and he
[1:29:31] just couldn't put his finger on it there
[1:29:32] was something really strange going on
[1:29:35] and and he really wanted to know what
[1:29:37] was going on and you know if you want to
[1:29:39] just turn with me over to Jeremiah
[1:29:41] chapter
[1:29:43] 39 when we're talking about
[1:29:46] Nebuchadnezzar this was a
[1:29:48] king that heard a
[1:29:51] prophecy this King heard about this
[1:29:55] prophecy and there's a reason why I want
[1:29:57] to point this
[1:30:00] out in in verse 11 of chapter 39 of
[1:30:11] Jeremiah my footnotes or the sorry the
[1:30:15] title at the top of the page here says
[1:30:17] Jeremiah
[1:30:18] loosed he was the prophet that was
[1:30:21] mistreated but he got loose
[1:30:25] verse 11 says now
[1:30:28] Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar sorry king
[1:30:31] of Babylon gave charge concerning
[1:30:35] Jeremiah to neb zeran the captain of the
[1:30:39] Guard saying take him and look well to
[1:30:42] him and do him no
[1:30:45] harm why is that why would the King give
[1:30:50] his captain
[1:30:52] charge to let this prophet
[1:30:54] go when everyone else in the kingdom was
[1:30:57] sacked or taken prisoner yet this one
[1:31:01] was being told by the king to be set
[1:31:04] free and I I'll just leave it you can go
[1:31:07] through and read it for time sake I'm
[1:31:09] going to jump to to chapter 40
[1:31:12] verse1 the word that came to Jeremiah
[1:31:15] from the Lord after that nebu
[1:31:19] zeran the captain of the Guard had led
[1:31:22] him go from Rama when he had taken him
[1:31:25] being bound in Chains among all that
[1:31:28] were carried away captive of Jerusalem
[1:31:30] and Judah which were carried away
[1:31:32] captive unto
[1:31:34] Babylon and the captain of the Guard
[1:31:37] took Jeremiah and said unto him the Lord
[1:31:40] thy God hath pronounced this evil upon
[1:31:43] this place now the Lord hath brought it
[1:31:47] and done according as he hath said
[1:31:51] because ye have sinned against the Lord
[1:31:54] and have not obeyed his voice therefore
[1:31:56] this thing is come upon you and now
[1:31:58] behold I loose thee this day from the
[1:32:02] chains which were upon thine hand if it
[1:32:05] seem good unto thee come with me unto
[1:32:07] Babylon to come to Babylon come and I
[1:32:10] will look well unto thee but if it is
[1:32:13] seem ill unto thee to come with me unto
[1:32:15] Babylon forbear behold all the land is
[1:32:19] before thee whether it seeth good and
[1:32:22] convenient for thee to go to their
[1:32:25] go so I just want to point out Jeremiah
[1:32:29] by following the word of the Lord at all
[1:32:33] expense just about everyone in the
[1:32:36] Kingdom there was a few but just about
[1:32:38] everyone in the Kingdom rejected the
[1:32:40] word in his mouth they said oh we know
[1:32:43] who your parents are his daddy did
[1:32:45] service in the temple and he actually
[1:32:48] started to hear the voice of the Lord
[1:32:51] and He alls he could do was follow the
[1:32:53] lord follow the the leadership of the
[1:32:54] Lord nobody was nudging him along saying
[1:32:56] you should be a prophet you should do
[1:32:57] this you should do that all he was doing
[1:33:00] was hearing from God and by doing so he
[1:33:02] spoke the word of God and God said to
[1:33:05] them because you've rejected me as your
[1:33:07] king you will now pay and we know the
[1:33:10] whole entire kingdom was sacked the
[1:33:13] whole story we know it I I don't want to
[1:33:14] go too far into it but what I do want to
[1:33:16] say is this King
[1:33:19] Nebuchadnezzar he understood there was a
[1:33:21] prophet in the land even the enemy from
[1:33:24] the north understood there was a prophet
[1:33:27] in the
[1:33:29] land isn't that amazing to think because
[1:33:33] of that he let him
[1:33:35] go and that's just astounding when you
[1:33:38] think about it because the only reason
[1:33:39] he did it we know it was God God said to
[1:33:42] him hey let my Prophet go and do them no
[1:33:47] harm but this King here was pretty full
[1:33:51] of
[1:33:52] himself he had he had a lot of character
[1:33:55] that he needed to
[1:33:57] express and uh so he erected this image
[1:33:59] he didn't know how to deal with this he
[1:34:01] knew somehow there was something going
[1:34:02] on and and we know that the the
[1:34:04] Babylonian religion which is the same as
[1:34:06] many other religions ancient religions
[1:34:08] even now modern religions I guess
[1:34:10] there's multiple gods a and you can have
[1:34:13] even a trinitarian religion where you've
[1:34:15] got more than one God you've got three
[1:34:16] distinct person of the Trinity we know
[1:34:20] that that's not even biblical but that's
[1:34:23] the way it is you can have many
[1:34:24] different gods and this is what
[1:34:25] Nebuchadnezzar was looking at he's like
[1:34:27] well I I can see that Daniel's God is a
[1:34:29] powerful God look at his God but all
[1:34:32] these other people there's something
[1:34:34] different about them we'll go on and
[1:34:36] read here verse verse 8 of uh Daniel
[1:34:39] chapter 3 wherefore at that time certain
[1:34:42] Chans came near and accused the Jews and
[1:34:47] they spake and said unto King
[1:34:49] Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever and
[1:34:52] you can imagine these were the ones who
[1:34:54] were jealous they were green with
[1:34:55] jealousy With Envy about all these
[1:34:57] captives coming in now and now suddenly
[1:35:00] here they are rising to a certain level
[1:35:02] of of political stature in the land and
[1:35:05] and now they don't have to listen but
[1:35:06] all the other ones do everyone else has
[1:35:08] to follow what the king says but now
[1:35:11] these ones are going to stand out my
[1:35:14] verse 10 thou oh King Hast made a decree
[1:35:16] that every man shall hear the sound of
[1:35:18] the Cornet flute harp sackbut Sultry and
[1:35:21] damer and all kinds of music shall fall
[1:35:23] down and worship the golden image and
[1:35:25] who so falth not down and
[1:35:30] worshipthe fiery
[1:35:33] furnace now we
[1:35:36] have the story laid out we've got the
[1:35:39] accusation coming up in verse 12 there
[1:35:41] are certain
[1:35:43] Jews whom thou Hast set over the Affairs
[1:35:47] of the province of Babylon Shadrach
[1:35:50] mesach and
[1:35:52] Abednego these men man oh King have not
[1:35:56] regarded
[1:35:57] thee they serve not thy
[1:36:00] Gods nor worship the golden image which
[1:36:05] thou has set up now I think we might
[1:36:07] have left off somewhere around there
[1:36:10] last time I think it's so beautiful it's
[1:36:12] just like the disciples in the book of
[1:36:14] Acts we know in the book of Acts it was
[1:36:18] the acts of the holy spirit in the
[1:36:21] apostles it's not the acts of the apost
[1:36:23] Apostles it's the acts of the Holy
[1:36:26] Spirit the apostles but here we have the
[1:36:28] apostles Jesus saying go ye forth into
[1:36:31] all the world and baptize in the name of
[1:36:32] the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:36:34] right that was the instructions that
[1:36:36] Jesus gave but they knew who Jesus was
[1:36:39] they knew who God was they knew his name
[1:36:41] and his name was Lord Jesus Christ so
[1:36:45] that's why after Jesus went up in a
[1:36:47] cloud and and and we know the word says
[1:36:50] the way same way you see him go up
[1:36:51] that's the same way he'll come we won't
[1:36:53] go too far to that today but we have
[1:36:55] disciples that knew Jesus they
[1:36:57] recognized his voice they knew him he
[1:37:00] was not their Master he was their friend
[1:37:03] he even declared it that way I no longer
[1:37:05] call you servant I Call You Friend they
[1:37:08] understood that and here we have
[1:37:10] something very similar going on these
[1:37:13] these these men I'm going to say men we
[1:37:16] call them kids the the Hebrew kids the
[1:37:19] Hebrew children these Hebrew men they
[1:37:22] knew exactly who Daniel was Daniel was
[1:37:27] their brother maybe Daniel was their
[1:37:29] Pastor because he was a prophet in his
[1:37:31] day maybe he was their pastor but they
[1:37:33] did not Elevate they weren't interested
[1:37:35] in elevating him to be above their God
[1:37:36] they weren't going to fall on their
[1:37:38] knees and worship their friend who would
[1:37:40] do that people that don't know the word
[1:37:43] of God would potentially and you know
[1:37:46] brothers and sisters we got into this
[1:37:48] last week and Lord willing we'll carry
[1:37:50] it on a little bit more and I don't mean
[1:37:52] it to be bad but sometimes I think it
[1:37:54] can be we can start to erect images in
[1:37:57] our own minds the devil is so Sly and so
[1:38:01] slick we read about this just now the
[1:38:03] the last quote we read how how he's
[1:38:06] going to come in and try to deceive the
[1:38:07] very elect if it were
[1:38:11] possible how's he going to do that
[1:38:14] sometimes I just want to say this we can
[1:38:15] we can get a an image in our mind of the
[1:38:18] way things should be we can erect our
[1:38:20] own image and is that actually the way
[1:38:23] God wants it to be I don't think it is
[1:38:27] God wants one image to be worshiped and
[1:38:30] only one and that is the Lord Jesus
[1:38:33] Christ any other image is actually going
[1:38:36] to lead to destruction brothers and
[1:38:38] sisters it's just going to be a
[1:38:39] destraction from the word and that's all
[1:38:40] it's going to take is a distraction from
[1:38:42] the word hey just look over here hey
[1:38:44] just just one little thing over here and
[1:38:46] as long as we're doing that as long as
[1:38:48] we're following that we're not keeping
[1:38:49] our eyes focused on Christ out of the
[1:38:52] exposition of the seven Church ages a
[1:38:54] resume of the ages brother Bram he says
[1:38:58] we learn in no uncertain terms that this
[1:39:01] false Vine is the vine of
[1:39:04] Satan their Gathering is of him Satan
[1:39:07] they
[1:39:08] meet in the name of
[1:39:10] God and lie that they are
[1:39:14] christs they preach they teach they
[1:39:18] baptize they worship they partake of
[1:39:21] various rights given by Christ to the
[1:39:24] church yet are not of
[1:39:26] God what this is really strong why would
[1:39:30] they not be of God simply because they
[1:39:32] wouldn't follow his word it's real
[1:39:35] simple and and it might sound
[1:39:37] condescending I don't mean it to sound
[1:39:38] condescending I mean to make it sound
[1:39:40] like it's simple brothers and sisters we
[1:39:42] either follow all of the word of God or
[1:39:44] we
[1:39:45] don't to follow most of the word of God
[1:39:49] is not following the word of God
[1:39:54] and that's what's required in this
[1:39:57] age my we get into the seventh age and
[1:40:01] all the Mysteries and all the seals
[1:40:03] being open and preach heavy mysterious
[1:40:06] doctor and brother but we can't do the
[1:40:08] simple things brothers and sisters it's
[1:40:11] time to get back to the
[1:40:14] word we've got to know the ABCs before
[1:40:17] we're ever going to see
[1:40:22] algebra it's the the age we live in this
[1:40:24] is no time to play church it's no time
[1:40:27] to say that I associate with the message
[1:40:29] of the hour and that's going to help me
[1:40:32] it's not going to help you get into
[1:40:36] Christ better yet get Christ into
[1:40:39] you the only way that's going to happen
[1:40:42] is to throw away the traditions and to
[1:40:45] take all of the images that we've got in
[1:40:48] our mind about what we think the message
[1:40:50] of the hour is and smashed them brothers
[1:40:53] and sisters we've got to be willing to
[1:40:56] Humble ourselves before God to say hey
[1:40:59] be it unto me according to Thy word Lord
[1:41:02] if we say no I've heard it all I've
[1:41:05] heard the message I've been raised in
[1:41:06] the message I my parents my grandparents
[1:41:09] this that the other you know what it's
[1:41:12] not going to work because God has no
[1:41:15] grandchildren he only has Sons and
[1:41:18] Daughters the ones that truly follow his
[1:41:22] word brother bam he says but since they
[1:41:26] are I'll go back to the beginning again
[1:41:28] I'll stop we'll just read this whole
[1:41:30] quote so I don't wreck it we learn in no
[1:41:33] uncertain terms that this false Vine is
[1:41:35] the vine of Satan the Gathering is of
[1:41:37] him Satan they meet in the name of God
[1:41:41] and lie that they are
[1:41:48] Christ they preach they teach they
[1:41:50] baptize they worship they partake of
[1:41:52] various rights given by Christ to the
[1:41:55] church yet they are not of God so close
[1:41:58] that it would deceive the very elected
[1:42:00] if it were possible but since they say
[1:42:03] they are God will hold them responsible
[1:42:06] we don't have to hold them responsible
[1:42:08] it's not up to us to do that brothers
[1:42:09] and sisters it's up to us to pray for
[1:42:10] one another to encourage one another but
[1:42:14] since they say they are God will hold
[1:42:15] them responsible and in each age he
[1:42:18] speaks of them and to them they remind
[1:42:22] us exact of balum he had the prophetic
[1:42:26] office he knew the proper approach unto
[1:42:29] God as demonstrated in the sacrifice of
[1:42:32] the clean beasts yet he was not a true
[1:42:37] word
[1:42:39] Prophet for when God told him not to go
[1:42:42] honor baac with his presence he sought
[1:42:46] to go anyway for he was motivated by his
[1:42:49] Lust For Gold and prestige
[1:42:55] so God let him
[1:42:56] go the perfect will of God gave way to
[1:43:00] the permissive will of God because the
[1:43:03] heart desire because of the heart
[1:43:06] desire of
[1:43:08] balum that's why we we we need to I I
[1:43:11] believe I want to encourage us brothers
[1:43:13] and sisters when we when we sing the
[1:43:15] songs of of David the man who is after a
[1:43:19] man after God's Own Heart and he we sing
[1:43:21] that song that it's this psalm create in
[1:43:24] me a Clean Heart Lord and renew a right
[1:43:29] Spirit within me it's not our own Spirit
[1:43:32] don't give me my spirit give me your
[1:43:34] spirit that's the only clean Spirit
[1:43:36] there
[1:43:37] is but we know that God said actually
[1:43:40] said go
[1:43:41] ahead did God change his mind no sir God
[1:43:45] had his way regardless of balum going
[1:43:48] balum did not anull the will of God and
[1:43:51] we can neither anull the of God brothers
[1:43:53] and sisters because his will is his word
[1:43:55] and his word will always come to pass
[1:43:58] heavens and earth will pass away but his
[1:43:59] word is the only thing that will remain
[1:44:02] God had his way regardless it was balum
[1:44:06] who was the loser for he bypassed the
[1:44:12] word remember brothers and sisters it's
[1:44:15] not just going to be action against the
[1:44:16] word of God in our age that's going to
[1:44:19] cause destruction it's going to be
[1:44:21] inaction towards the word of God when
[1:44:25] we've heard it and then we just choose
[1:44:27] to do our own thing that's the same
[1:44:29] thing and today we have the very same
[1:44:33] thing women preachers organization false
[1:44:36] Doctrine Etc and people worshiping God
[1:44:38] manifesting in the spirit and going
[1:44:40] right on as did balum claiming that God
[1:44:43] has spoken to them even when the
[1:44:45] commission received is opposite to the
[1:44:48] revealed
[1:44:50] word Lord have mercy
[1:44:53] yes
[1:44:55] yes and we have the prophets say can you
[1:44:59] read
[1:45:02] that and I will not
[1:45:06] deny that God spoke to
[1:45:08] them wow right
[1:45:12] y but it was just like when he spoke to
[1:45:16] balum that second time as he knew that
[1:45:19] balam wanted his own heart desire above
[1:45:22] the world
[1:45:24] word I say Lord don't let us put our
[1:45:26] heart desires above this word me too I
[1:45:30] say Lord don't let me put my heart
[1:45:33] desire above your
[1:45:34] word there's nothing in this world
[1:45:37] that's worth putting above his word
[1:45:38] brothers and sisters if we put anything
[1:45:41] between us and his word it's
[1:45:46] idolatry brother bam says it was just
[1:45:49] like when he spoke to balam that second
[1:45:50] time he knew that balam wanted his own
[1:45:52] heart desire above the word and he gave
[1:45:54] it to him yet all the while in the end
[1:45:58] having his own
[1:46:00] way even so today God tells folks to go
[1:46:04] ahead in their own heart's
[1:46:09] desires for they have already rejected
[1:46:11] the
[1:46:15] word but the will of God will be done
[1:46:17] regardless amen isn't that tremendous
[1:46:20] brothers and
[1:46:21] sisters and what is the will of God his
[1:46:23] word what's the true identification that
[1:46:26] we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:46:27] we're willing to line ourselves up with
[1:46:29] the word we're willing to say be it unto
[1:46:31] me oh Lord according to thy will which
[1:46:34] is Thy word even if it takes the hide
[1:46:35] off me even if I know that I've done
[1:46:38] wrong I've got to go and fix and I need
[1:46:39] to make these things right but the one
[1:46:41] that will never do that is the one
[1:46:44] that's already rejected the word they've
[1:46:45] already rejected the word because guilty
[1:46:48] of the least is guilty of the
[1:46:50] whole but the will of God will be done
[1:46:53] regardless he says amen I hope you see
[1:46:55] this it will not only clear up much of
[1:46:59] what is seen in all ages but it will
[1:47:02] especially help in this last age which
[1:47:05] has so much manifestation and external
[1:47:08] blessings when the whole period is so
[1:47:10] against the
[1:47:12] word
[1:47:14] revealed will of God I just love that
[1:47:19] the word revealed will of
[1:47:21] God my goodness
[1:47:24] going back to our story today we know
[1:47:26] that Nebuchadnezzar he was good to His
[1:47:28] prophets we talked about that in in
[1:47:31] Jeremiah 39 and 40 and I just think it's
[1:47:35] interesting don't you how how how
[1:47:37] sometimes unbelievers because we know
[1:47:39] Nebuchadnezzar wasn't a Believer he was
[1:47:41] an unbeliever he was an idolator he he
[1:47:44] was a king that never knew the god of
[1:47:46] heaven and we know that God dealt with
[1:47:48] him he let his his life pass over him
[1:47:50] seven times we can get into that story
[1:47:52] later on but for time's sake we know
[1:47:54] that he came to know God in a different
[1:47:57] way and he came to the place where he
[1:47:59] declared there is one living God God
[1:48:02] knows exactly how to deal with us but
[1:48:04] isn't it interesting how unbelievers can
[1:48:07] sometimes be nicer to the people of God
[1:48:09] than those so-called
[1:48:12] Believers how does that
[1:48:15] work I I think it's amazing we know that
[1:48:19] Matthew 10:41 I'll read it for time sake
[1:48:21] he says he that receiveth prophet in the
[1:48:23] name of the Prophet shall receive a
[1:48:25] prophet's reward and he that receiveth a
[1:48:27] righteous man in the name of a righteous
[1:48:28] man shall receive a righteous man's
[1:48:31] reward brothers and sisters that's how
[1:48:32] we're going to see people come to the
[1:48:33] white Throne judgment and actually get
[1:48:35] eternal
[1:48:36] life because they were good to the
[1:48:39] bride that's right that's what the
[1:48:42] prophet taught yes but here we have in
[1:48:44] our
[1:48:45] story let's go back to it we left off in
[1:48:48] verse 12 verse
[1:48:51] 13 that nebuch Nezar in his rage and
[1:48:56] fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach
[1:48:58] and Abednego then they brought these men
[1:49:01] before the king and you can only imagine
[1:49:03] when when they when they totally
[1:49:07] objected to the king they didn't listen
[1:49:08] to the king they stood out everyone else
[1:49:11] bowed down but these ones stood out
[1:49:13] isn't that the life of a Believer it's
[1:49:15] pretty easy for the brothers to blend in
[1:49:17] you know Lord have mercy on the sisters
[1:49:19] who stand out just like those Hebrew
[1:49:21] kids because they can't hide their
[1:49:23] garments they can't hide their hair
[1:49:26] they're the ones making a stand whether
[1:49:28] they want to or not Brothers we've got
[1:49:30] to pray for the sisters who take a stand
[1:49:32] and stand out just like these Hebrew
[1:49:34] kids
[1:49:35] did but we know Nebuchadnezzar verse 13
[1:49:38] in his rage and fury commanded to bring
[1:49:40] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego then they
[1:49:42] brought these men before the King
[1:49:44] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them
[1:49:46] is it true oh Shadrach Meshach and
[1:49:49] Abednego and you can imagine here we
[1:49:51] have the king thinking I allowed you to
[1:49:53] follow this guy who I know has
[1:49:54] Supernatural God he told you along he
[1:49:57] brought you along all three of you and
[1:49:58] now you defy me
[1:50:00] openly my he must have been in a real
[1:50:03] fit Shadrach Meshach and abedo do not ye
[1:50:07] serve my gods nor worship the golden
[1:50:10] image which I have set up now if ye be
[1:50:12] ready that at the what ye what time ye
[1:50:16] hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp
[1:50:18] sackbut salry and duler and all kinds of
[1:50:21] music ye Fall Down and Worship ship the
[1:50:23] image which I have made well but if you
[1:50:26] worship not ye shall be cast the same
[1:50:29] hour into the midst of a burning fiery
[1:50:33] furnace and who is that God that shall
[1:50:36] deliver you out of my
[1:50:39] hands right isn't it interesting that he
[1:50:41] would ask that question after he set
[1:50:44] everything in motion created all of this
[1:50:47] this problem and and this image and and
[1:50:50] all of this worship and everybody is
[1:50:52] involved with it but yet he would still
[1:50:54] have something in him that would say who
[1:50:56] is this God that can deliver you and I I
[1:51:00] can't help but think they they actually
[1:51:02] knew the word of God those boys in job
[1:51:05] 13:1 15 though he slay me yet will I
[1:51:09] trust in him but I will maintain my own
[1:51:13] ways before him job understood the word
[1:51:17] of God in his life we know that even his
[1:51:19] wife came against him and said why why
[1:51:21] don't you just Curse God die look at you
[1:51:24] look at you you're miserable and job
[1:51:26] said you know what thou speakest like a
[1:51:29] foolish woman he didn't say you are a
[1:51:31] foolish woman he said thou speakest as a
[1:51:35] foolish woman that I would do that
[1:51:38] though he slay me yet I will serve him
[1:51:41] acts 4:18 and they called them and
[1:51:44] commanded them not to speak at all nor
[1:51:46] teach in the name of Jesus but Peter and
[1:51:49] John answered and said unto them whether
[1:51:51] it be right in the sight of God to
[1:51:53] hearken unto you more than to our God
[1:51:56] judgey but for we cannot speak the
[1:51:59] things which we have seen and heard they
[1:52:03] know they knew they understood exactly
[1:52:06] who their God was and they were willing
[1:52:08] to make a stand for it here we have King
[1:52:12] Nebuchadnezzar saying who is that God
[1:52:14] that shall deliver you out of my hand
[1:52:16] and you know these boys because they
[1:52:18] understood God they understood where
[1:52:21] they were and who they were and where
[1:52:23] they stood Shadrach Meshach and abedo
[1:52:26] verse 16 answered and said to the king
[1:52:29] oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[1:52:32] answer thee in this matter that alone
[1:52:34] brothers and sisters was enough to put
[1:52:36] them in the burning fiery furnace I hope
[1:52:38] we understand that that that you did not
[1:52:40] come against King Nebuchadnezzar in the
[1:52:42] Babylonian province in in that Kingdom
[1:52:45] and stand up and defy openly the king to
[1:52:49] do that was death immediately remember
[1:52:52] even the the captain's guard who is
[1:52:54] feeding them they said no no no we can't
[1:52:57] eat this food that's tainted it's been
[1:52:59] sacrificed onto idols and that wine it's
[1:53:01] all unclean we can't eat that just give
[1:53:03] us pulse remember the captain of the the
[1:53:06] King's Guard said no I fear for my head
[1:53:08] you've got to actually allow me to to
[1:53:10] minister unto you but they said no just
[1:53:12] don't worry don't worry God has allowed
[1:53:14] us to find favor in your sight we went
[1:53:16] over all of that but but here we have
[1:53:19] the same children now saying hey doesn't
[1:53:21] matter who we talk to on side of
[1:53:22] Eternity we know there is one God and
[1:53:25] that's the only image that we're going
[1:53:26] to bow down
[1:53:29] to why is that because they received the
[1:53:32] word of the prophet in their
[1:53:34] day that's the only reason they could do
[1:53:37] it brothers and sisters many people
[1:53:38] might say oh brother Barry there's
[1:53:40] people there's many different ways you
[1:53:42] know what this whole world teaches that
[1:53:43] you can just get a GPS calculator and
[1:53:46] you can find your way around and they
[1:53:47] will even say there's many different
[1:53:49] ways to get to heaven there's only one
[1:53:51] way one truth truth and one life that's
[1:53:54] it that's Jesus Christ there's no way
[1:53:57] around it the only way we get to Jesus
[1:53:59] Christ is through the word of a
[1:54:01] Vindicated Prophet there's many people
[1:54:03] that will claim that they get there but
[1:54:05] they won't they don't you
[1:54:07] can't Shadrach Meshach and abedo verse
[1:54:10] 16 answered and said to the King
[1:54:12] Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[1:54:14] answer thee in this matter if it be so
[1:54:18] our God whom we serve is able to Deliver
[1:54:21] Us from the burning fiery furnace and he
[1:54:24] will deliver us out of thy hand oh King
[1:54:28] can you imagine a prophetic class of
[1:54:31] people amen they couldn't see how it was
[1:54:34] going to happen they didn't understand
[1:54:35] how it was going to happen my
[1:54:38] goodness I just think this is so
[1:54:40] beautiful boy I get talking and I just
[1:54:43] completely get off I do apologize off
[1:54:45] track Verse 18 but if not be it known
[1:54:48] unto thee Oh King that we will not serve
[1:54:50] thy Gods nor worship the gold an image
[1:54:53] which thou Hast set up so all of those
[1:54:55] verses those three verses 161 17 and 18
[1:54:58] put this man who was already in a rage
[1:55:00] into like a a nuclear fusion or fision
[1:55:03] whichever you call it this guy was going
[1:55:05] crosseyed with anger right and isn't it
[1:55:08] interesting verse 19 said then was
[1:55:10] Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury and the form
[1:55:13] of his Visage was changed against
[1:55:15] Shadrach mesach and abedo you can only
[1:55:17] imagine he had veins popping out on his
[1:55:19] forehead his whole face was red he
[1:55:22] didn't even know what to do himself so
[1:55:24] what did he say oh we're going to take
[1:55:26] and we're going to make that furnace
[1:55:27] seven times hter than it's ever been i'
[1:55:29] got to do everything I can against these
[1:55:32] boys that are going to defy me openly
[1:55:34] like that then Nebuchadnezzar was full
[1:55:36] of Fury and the form of his vision was
[1:55:37] changed against Shadrach Meshach and
[1:55:39] Abednego therefore he spake and
[1:55:41] commanded that they should heat that
[1:55:42] furnace one seven times more than it was
[1:55:46] want to be heated and he commanded the
[1:55:50] most mighty men that were in his army to
[1:55:51] bind Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and
[1:55:54] cast them into a burning fiery
[1:55:56] furnace then these men were Bound in
[1:55:59] their coats their hosen their hats and
[1:56:03] their other garments and were cast into
[1:56:05] the midst of the burning fiery
[1:56:08] furnace can you imagine that brothers
[1:56:10] and
[1:56:11] sisters I think it's beautiful how they
[1:56:13] were able to say you know what it
[1:56:15] doesn't matter we're not careful to
[1:56:16] answer you that is Holy Spirit courage
[1:56:20] right there amen amen it's not
[1:56:23] rebellious Spirit that's people knowing
[1:56:26] exactly who they are and exactly where
[1:56:29] they stand because that word the only
[1:56:31] word his will they have hidden in their
[1:56:34] heart they knew exactly all about it
[1:56:36] just like brother bradam says about the
[1:56:38] message of the hour when you get the
[1:56:39] Holy Ghost in your life there's no
[1:56:42] questions about it you know exactly all
[1:56:44] about
[1:56:45] it but you
[1:56:48] know I can't help but imagine they they
[1:56:51] knew some scripture in their lives and
[1:56:54] uh you know for time's sake I'm probably
[1:56:56] not going to read a lot of this
[1:56:59] here
[1:57:01] but I think it's important for us to
[1:57:08] know they were able to say our God whom
[1:57:12] we serve is able and he's able to
[1:57:15] deliver us not only from your hand but
[1:57:18] to Deliver Us from this Burning fiery
[1:57:20] furnace amen sometimes in our lives I
[1:57:22] believe we need to be able to speak by
[1:57:24] faith brothers and sisters and you know
[1:57:26] what we've heard it said before that the
[1:57:28] prophet is just he he said that God is
[1:57:31] just waiting for us to speak the word
[1:57:34] and that's just for heaven to back up
[1:57:36] that word he he's waiting for us to
[1:57:38] actually just speak the word that is the
[1:57:40] third pole Ministry we know that's the
[1:57:42] opening of the word but how are we ever
[1:57:44] going to do that if we don't follow the
[1:57:46] word
[1:57:47] amen many times people will actually
[1:57:50] want the word in their hour of need but
[1:57:52] the rest of the time in their lives you
[1:57:54] know it kind of gets in the way it
[1:57:55] cramps the style they have to go and
[1:57:57] hear the the preacher preach and hear
[1:57:59] all of his teaching and you know there's
[1:58:01] there's men that are fallible and every
[1:58:03] man is fallible I'm fallible I'll tell
[1:58:06] you that don't look to me Look Away to
[1:58:08] Jesus he is the one with your
[1:58:12] salvation but we know these Hebrew kids
[1:58:14] they are able to say that he's able to
[1:58:15] Deliver Us from this Burning fiery
[1:58:17] furnace and I want to say today brothers
[1:58:19] and sisters where do we find ourselves
[1:58:21] when we are in the midst of it what is
[1:58:23] he able to Deliver Us from I'm sure that
[1:58:25] we could come up with a laundry list
[1:58:27] he's able to Deliver Us from a mental
[1:58:30] anguish he is able to Deliver Us From
[1:58:33] Fear he is able to Deliver Us from colds
[1:58:36] he's able to Deliver Us from cancer he's
[1:58:39] able to Deliver us from death there's
[1:58:41] nothing that he's not able to Deliver Us
[1:58:44] from and you know what it doesn't matter
[1:58:46] who we come up against who might come up
[1:58:48] against us rather in this world nobody
[1:58:51] can pluck us from his
[1:58:54] hand but in Daniel 18 3:18 but if not it
[1:59:01] doesn't
[1:59:03] matter it doesn't mean that God won't
[1:59:05] hear our
[1:59:06] prayer if God won't deliver them from
[1:59:09] the fire they're not worried it's not
[1:59:11] because God won't hear their prayer it's
[1:59:13] not because God will abandon
[1:59:18] us it's simply because it must be God's
[1:59:22] perfect
[1:59:24] will nobody passes on without it being
[1:59:28] God's perfect will
[1:59:31] nobody the only reason people go from
[1:59:34] this world to the next is because God
[1:59:36] said it's time it's time for that person
[1:59:39] to come home amen and these Hebrew kids
[1:59:42] were willing to stake it all on the line
[1:59:44] how many times in our lives are we
[1:59:45] willing to do that brothers and
[1:59:47] sisters it it it's not an easy thing but
[1:59:50] you know we're coming to the place where
[1:59:52] it's so Sly and so subtle we don't need
[1:59:55] to worry about having a tremendous
[1:59:58] problem in our flesh worry about the
[2:00:00] tremendous problem Waring for our souls
[2:00:03] that's what we need to be worried
[2:00:06] about but you know what these kids they
[2:00:08] knew these men they knew that God didn't
[2:00:10] abandon
[2:00:12] them I just can't help but think they
[2:00:14] understood the prophet Isaiah in Isaiah
[2:00:17] 43:1 but now thus saith the Lord that
[2:00:20] created thee oh Jacob and he that formed
[2:00:23] thee oh Israel fear not for I have
[2:00:26] redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy
[2:00:30] name Thou Art mine when thou passest
[2:00:35] through the waters I will be with thee
[2:00:38] and through the rivers they shall not
[2:00:41] overflow thee when thou wst through the
[2:00:44] fire thou shallal not be burned neither
[2:00:48] shall the flame Kindle upon thee these
[2:00:52] were Believers of the word for their day
[2:00:56] and they were not willing to compromise
[2:00:58] not for any King not for any image not
[2:01:01] for any Kingdom brothers and sisters
[2:01:04] we've got to be very careful about the
[2:01:07] images that we're willing to erect in
[2:01:09] our
[2:01:10] lives the Devil comes in so subtly it'll
[2:01:14] start out with just one thing and then
[2:01:16] it will grow into another and then it
[2:01:17] will grow into another we cannot have an
[2:01:20] image that will be acceptable in the
[2:01:22] sight of God sometimes we can have a
[2:01:24] church image tear it down Smash It To
[2:01:28] The Ground the only image is
[2:01:31] Christ sometimes we can have a family
[2:01:35] image that's a tradition it's a
[2:01:37] traditional teaching Smash It To The
[2:01:41] Ground sometimes we can have a cultural
[2:01:44] image there's no culture in the Holy
[2:01:49] Ghost that is false lie of the devil
[2:01:53] when people say well it's my culture
[2:01:55] that's a lie of the
[2:01:57] devil
[2:01:59] right these Hebrew kids they knew they
[2:02:03] knew the prophecy of Isaiah they knew
[2:02:05] where they stood when thou wst through
[2:02:08] the fire Thou shalt not be burned
[2:02:12] amen that's why they said we're not
[2:02:14] careful to answer the this matter don't
[2:02:16] have to you know what if if if not be it
[2:02:19] known unto thee Oh King that we will not
[2:02:21] serve thee we will not worship thy Gods
[2:02:24] nor worship the golden image which th
[2:02:25] set up and we know this guy drove him
[2:02:27] into a
[2:02:28] frenzy and we heard that they were
[2:02:31] thrown into the fiery
[2:02:33] furnace verse
[2:02:35] 22 actually
[2:02:38] 21 then these men were Bound in their
[2:02:40] coats their hosen their hats and their
[2:02:42] other garments and were cast into the
[2:02:44] midst of the burning fiery furnace
[2:02:46] therefore because the king's commandment
[2:02:49] was urgent and the furnace was exceeding
[2:02:51] ly hot the flame of the fire slew those
[2:02:55] men that took up Shadrach Meshach and
[2:02:57] Abednego isn't it interesting how God
[2:02:59] will always have a
[2:03:01] witness something had to demonstrate
[2:03:03] that this was actually hot something had
[2:03:07] to demonstrate the king's Fury something
[2:03:09] had to demonstrate the delivering power
[2:03:12] of God spoken by the prophet
[2:03:16] Isaiah when thou walkest through the
[2:03:18] fire thou shal not be burned
[2:03:27] amen therefore because the king's
[2:03:29] commandment was urgent the furnace was
[2:03:31] exceedingly hot the flame of the fire
[2:03:33] slew those men that took up Shadrach
[2:03:35] mesach and Abednego and these three men
[2:03:37] Shadrach Meshach and abano fell down
[2:03:39] bound into the midst of the burning
[2:03:41] fiery furnace brothers and sisters I
[2:03:43] want to say today many times we can find
[2:03:45] ourselves bound and and falling down in
[2:03:48] the midst of a burning fiery furnace but
[2:03:52] it's right there it's right then that is
[2:03:54] when God is on the scene brothers and
[2:03:57] sisters don't think for a second that he
[2:03:59] has abandon you or abandon your prayers
[2:04:02] he has heard every single prayer and he
[2:04:04] knows exactly what your situation
[2:04:07] is and here we have verse 24 then
[2:04:09] Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonied and
[2:04:12] Rose up in haste and spake and said unto
[2:04:15] his counselors now all these
[2:04:17] accusers huh did we not cast three men
[2:04:21] bound into the midst of the fire they
[2:04:23] answered and said unto the king true oh
[2:04:25] King and what did he do he answered God
[2:04:28] allowing this King to witness it he
[2:04:30] answered and said lo I see four men
[2:04:33] loose walking in the midst of the fire
[2:04:36] and they have no hurt and the form of
[2:04:38] the fourth is like the Son of God isn't
[2:04:41] that amazing brothers and
[2:04:43] sisters if you want to see his will just
[2:04:47] apply his
[2:04:48] word if you want to see his will just
[2:04:50] apply his word my
[2:04:52] goodness oh it's
[2:04:56] good oh I'm just going to read one quote
[2:04:59] and then I'm going to close I'll call
[2:05:00] the musicians it's a long quote so you
[2:05:03] can stay sitting just for
[2:05:05] now 1953 0608 at Thy
[2:05:09] word it's a story that I read a long
[2:05:12] time ago and I just think it's so
[2:05:14] powerful brothers and sisters we need to
[2:05:16] remember that his ears are always open
[2:05:18] to our prayers and he's just waiting to
[2:05:20] see that we're willing to take him at
[2:05:22] his word he is not a vending machine we
[2:05:25] can't just go and live our lives
[2:05:27] willy-nilly and then suddenly have a
[2:05:29] problem and we got to come and put our
[2:05:31] coins in the machine and say oh God come
[2:05:34] and heal me oh God come and save me just
[2:05:37] apply the word in your
[2:05:39] life and then speak the word and see if
[2:05:42] God won't come on the scene brother
[2:05:44] bradam he said I was studying this out
[2:05:46] and brother bradam said you know those
[2:05:48] boys they had a prayer meeting that
[2:05:50] night those boys were saying while they
[2:05:53] were walking up the plank Shadrach
[2:05:56] Shadrach oh sorry brother I I'll take
[2:05:58] that Shadrach are you sure you prayed up
[2:06:01] last night you didn't fall asleep did
[2:06:04] you they knew they needed to make sure
[2:06:07] where they stood there's no room for
[2:06:10] error in this
[2:06:11] situation at Thy word brother browny
[2:06:14] says that's what it is take God at his
[2:06:15] word whatever God says God's able to
[2:06:17] perform God down through the edges I can
[2:06:20] see the Hebrew children that night when
[2:06:22] they came down to the fiery furnace they
[2:06:24] were down in Babylon what a condition
[2:06:27] what a Time way down in Babylon them
[2:06:30] boys had determined that they wasn't
[2:06:32] going to be
[2:06:33] defeated I can't imagine that we would
[2:06:36] never feel that way but brothers and
[2:06:38] sisters I can say it for sure there's
[2:06:40] times in my life where I have felt
[2:06:42] defeated have you ever felt defeated
[2:06:45] don't feel
[2:06:46] defeated when that feeling comes around
[2:06:48] that's the devil trying to come in like
[2:06:50] a flood but let that spirit of God raise
[2:06:53] up that standard inside of you to say
[2:06:55] there's nothing that can harm me they
[2:06:58] were going to take God's word for it we
[2:07:01] need some more of them tonight I want to
[2:07:04] say we need some more of them today
[2:07:06] Shadrach mesach and
[2:07:09] abedo what called the son of man on the
[2:07:12] scene brothers and sisters it wasn't
[2:07:15] King
[2:07:16] Nebuchadnezzar it wasn't even
[2:07:19] Daniel it was those Hebrew kids
[2:07:22] those ones that hid his word in their
[2:07:25] heart King made a prop Proclamation
[2:07:29] declaration and he said ever who won't
[2:07:31] bow to the image will excuse me don't
[2:07:34] give the devil any fear he says I like
[2:07:36] that determination the king said I will
[2:07:38] burn some of that Holy Roller religion
[2:07:41] out of them then and isn't that what the
[2:07:43] devil says to us today we'll be in a
[2:07:46] church service and God will say stand up
[2:07:49] and receive your healing and we'll be
[2:07:50] like oh my I don't know I think I'm
[2:07:54] going crazy because I I feel like I just
[2:07:56] want to stand up and shout in the middle
[2:07:58] of a service but everyone else is going
[2:07:59] to look around and say oh he's a holly
[2:08:01] roller brothers and sisters don't let
[2:08:03] nothing stop the spirit of God rising up
[2:08:06] inside of you because when he sees his
[2:08:09] word get a response then he's going to
[2:08:13] give you what you're looking
[2:08:15] for but as long as we sit in a church
[2:08:17] service and say oh
[2:08:19] my yeah I've heard that quote
[2:08:22] before yeah I've been around the message
[2:08:25] many many
[2:08:27] years d d God's just going to say you
[2:08:29] know what whatever have a nice day
[2:08:33] that's what he's going to say but when
[2:08:35] we're willing to actually say Lord I
[2:08:37] surrender all I'm willing to take all
[2:08:39] those images that have been raised up in
[2:08:41] my mind and just say be it unto me
[2:08:43] according to your your word then he's
[2:08:45] going to say hey now we're getting
[2:08:47] somewhere I'm seeing a response to my
[2:08:49] word when I see a response to my word
[2:08:51] that I'm going to pour out my blessings
[2:08:53] on you the king said I will burn some of
[2:08:56] that Holy Roller religion out of them
[2:08:59] don't let anybody worry you about Holy
[2:09:01] Roller religion in this building if
[2:09:02] there's ever a place that you can let
[2:09:04] off the pressure brothers and sisters

[2:09:26] respond to God's
[2:09:28] [Applause]

[2:09:30] word the devil will never be able to
[2:09:32] burn that Holy Roller religion out of
[2:09:35] you brother bradam he talks about John
[2:09:38] on the aisle of patmas before they sent
[2:09:40] him there they tried to boil that Holy
[2:09:42] Roller religion out of him you're not
[2:09:43] going to boil the Holy Spirit out of
[2:09:46] nobody so they got the Old Furnace hot
[2:09:49] seven times hotter than it ever was was
[2:09:51] I seen them tie their hands behind them
[2:09:54] can you imagine a Vindicated prophet in
[2:09:56] our day talking about a vision that God
[2:09:59] has given him about this circumstance
[2:10:02] this isn't just storytelling brothers
[2:10:04] and
[2:10:04] sisters H he's seen them tie their hands
[2:10:08] behind them they had a prayer meeting
[2:10:10] all that night the next day the death
[2:10:13] march come along plank walk up there a
[2:10:16] road wherever it was Stone Road to the
[2:10:19] furnace and they dropped off the furnace
[2:10:22] I can see the great strong men the king
[2:10:25] set up and say now we'll see how good
[2:10:27] this religion is marome right now we'll
[2:10:31] see how good this religion is isn't that

[2:10:37] good this religion is you just come down
[2:10:39] off that cross and then we'll believe
[2:10:41] that you're God it's the same Spirit now
[2:10:44] we'll see how good that religion is how
[2:10:46] much whether he will not take his word
[2:10:49] or not but they had an issue from God
[2:10:52] not to bow to images take God at his
[2:10:55] word I can see them start the Death
[2:10:58] March the old Skies roaring red with
[2:11:00] fire said you want to take it back you
