God bless you this morning. Welcome to the house of the Lord. If you have a need this morning, maybe [music] just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand. We have a couple of requests we'd like to bring before the church, before his throne. One is for brother Ron Snow's uncle in Newfoundland. He's been identified to have cancer in his body. I believe it's Ronald Snow. Brother Ronald Snow. We want to uplift him today. We have a brother Lazarus from New Delhi. New Delhi Church says, "We have a special prayer request for brother Lazarus. Both of his kidneys have been nonfunctional since 2007 and has been hospitalized due to multiple hip fractures. Despite his condition, he has continued to go out and to preach the word with unwavering faith and dedication. Please keep him in prayers for a quick discharge. If you have a need this morning, just make it known [music] unto him by way of an uplift hand. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we're so thankful that we can come together this way, Lord, that we can bring our little licks of fire together, Lord, to Father, be in your presence, the pillar of fire. Father, we know that's the very same pillar of fire that came down and met Moses in a burning bush. This is the very same pillar of fire that came and stood between Moses and your people. Oh, father and Pharaoh and his army, the enemy. And Lord Jesus, you're the same God today that you were then, that you ever will be. And Father, we're so thankful that we can, Lord, invite you to come by our way. &gt;&gt; And Lord, not only invite you because we know where you come, you come where you're always come where you're invited, Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, this morning as our brother already prayed, Father, we greet you. We greet you with a kiss, Lord. We welcome you, Father. That we could wash your feet, Lord Jesus. That we could anoint you with oil today, Lord. Father, we don't want to be those that just invite you to come by out of a convenience, Lord, out of an image situation, from pride. Oh Lord, we invite you to come by our way so we can acknowledge you, Lord. So that we can pour out our love to you, Father. Oh Lord Jesus, and thereby you could speak back to us, Father, the words that we need, the words of life. Oh, Father, the words that will change our bodies one day. Father, we're so thankful that we can gather together this way. We don't take it for granted. Lord, we recognize the day in which we live. You told us the signs that would be in the land. And Father, they're everywhere. They're on every hand. Father, we know every single day we could be looking up because we know our redemption isn't just nigh. that's right here at the door. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to check up today with your word. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would meet these requests, Lord, as they've been mentioned this morning, Brother Ronald Snow in Newfoundland, Lord, dealing with that giant of cancer. But we know that he's nothing compared to you, Father. &gt;&gt; No giant can withstand before the armies of the living God, &gt;&gt; and prosper. Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we stand with our brother in the name of Jesus that you would heal him, Lord. Father, we want to stand with this other brother in in the Delhi church in India. Father, we know that once upon a time there was oh father, there was a situation that happened where Lord, even the the biggest giant of all came around and stung your friend Lazarus, a man with the same name. Oh, Father, and you waited 4 days. You didn't come when we thought you should. But Father, you came exactly on time. &gt;&gt; And we invite you because you are the same. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, this is a servant of yours. No matter what the circumstance, he's still interested in promoting you to this world and taking as many people with him as he can. So, Father, we pray that that same God that stood in the frame of Jesus would go by their Delhi church today and stand by that man and raise him up in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Father, we're so thankful that we can know you that way. Lord, we know that, Father, we could see many signs and many wonders, many healings, many tremendous victories in our lives. But there's no greater victory or tremendous sign than when a man can be changed from a sinner into a saint. We know that's the greatest miracle. And that's why we're here today, Father, to check up by your word. Oh, Father, we pray that you would just meet the needs that were made known unto you today sovereignly, Father, in each individual's life, Lord. That Father, they would be able to come back with a praise report, Lord Jesus, as that one leper. Oh, let the other nine run away. But Father, we won't. We'll come back and say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus, for what you've done for us." Because once we were blind, but now we can see. Father, once we couldn't actually receive your word, but now we can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would be with those who might be traveling, Lord, that you would grant them traveling mercies, Father. Oh, Father, if anybody's sick in their body, Lord, maybe at home today, we pray that you would minister to them wherever they are, Lord. We know that you're not bound by time or space. Oh, Father, we love you and we thank you. We just want to commit all these needs into your hands now. And Father, the rest of this service as we turn to your word, we pray that you would just minister to us sovereignly according to your will. &gt;&gt; We just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians. [snorts] God bless you today. If you have your Bibles, I would like to read out of St. John chapter 3. St. John chapter 3 verse one. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; The same came to Jesus by night and said unto him, [clears throat] "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God, and no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him." &gt;&gt; Right? Jesus answered and said unto him, "Verily, verily, [snorts] I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus saith unto him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?" Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." &gt;&gt; That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. &gt;&gt; Marvel not that I say unto thee, Ye [clears throat] must be born again. The wind bloweth, whether it listeth, and thou heest the sound thereof, but can not tell whence it cometh, and whether it goeth. So is everyone that is born of the spirit." Nicodemus answered and said unto him, "How can these things be?" Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, we speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen, and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things? Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we just invite you one more time. &gt;&gt; Amen to teach us, Lord, of heavenly things. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to not be earthly. Help us to not be after the flesh, Lord. Yes, &gt;&gt; Father, we just desire to be in that place where you spoke about to the church in Romans chapter 8, Father, where there's no more condemnation because we're in you. Help us, Lord Jesus, to be in you today. And Father, if there's nobody or anybody in here, Father, that doesn't know you in the power of your resurrection today, Father, I pray that we could sing that song, this is the day. &gt;&gt; This is the day that the Lord hath made. And Father, we will rejoice and be glad in it, Lord. Father, every single one of us has got to be born again. And we just commit this service and all of it into your hands for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be seated. Just like to welcome all of our visitors. Certainly wonderful to see Sister Alice here again. God bless you. We have the fly shackers with us. God bless you. And we have the gun ones with us. Certainly honored to have you with us as well. It's always too short. We never seem to be able to get enough fellowship in. And uh we just certainly thank the Lord for the little times that we do get because we don't know. They could be the last time. &gt;&gt; We don't want to take it for granted. We don't know what tomorrow has in store. And you know, as believers, I think it's important to recognize we're not exclusive to the laws of this universe. Whether we go by the way of the grave or we go by the way of the sky, we've got to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think when brother Menof Freezen was here last time, he said these words, "No matter what, we can't stay here." &gt;&gt; No matter what, we cannot stay here. We have to go. Every single one of us. So, it behooves us to make sure that we've got our calling and election made sure. And I believe that's why we're all here today. I just wanted to read a thank you note that we got from the Kikuji family after the passing of Sister Germaine, laying her to rest there last weekend. It says, "The world's a whole lot better place because of people like you who give real joy and pleasure by the nice things that they do. It says here, "Dear church family, we want to take a moment to express our deep gratitude for the many thoughtful messages and prayers. Your loving support and kindness have comforted us during this time of loss, and we know that it's always a great time of loss when we lose a loved one. You have been a great blessing to us. Thanks be to God for putting you in our lives, the Kikuji family. And I want to say this, we certainly thank you for thank God for putting you in our lives as an assembly. It wouldn't be the same without you. &gt;&gt; We will certainly miss Sister Jarmine all the days of our life here on this side. But we know that we don't mourn as others mourn. We have a promise and that is that we will meet with her again. We're certainly excited for that with all of our loved ones. My &gt;&gt; this morning, I just wanted to uh also announce we've got the the men's breakfast is coming up. If you have any questions about that, by all means, just reach out. Um I'm going to be away next weekend. I'll be in Grand Prairie for three services. And we have brother Don Snow has agreed to take the service for us here on Sunday. And we know the Lord has put a lot on his heart. And uh it's interesting because for those people who know him, you know what I'm saying, but if you don't know brother Dawn, the way the Lord deals with him is such an amazing way. He has has a a gift to write poetry. And he expresses the words that the Lord the inspiration the Lord puts on his heart through poetry. And he has actually a book of poetry. It's not just one or two poems. Um it's amazing. And the Lord just keeps pouring out through his vessel. And uh that what I'm saying is that's just the tip of the iceberg. The poems that you hear are just the tip of the iceberg. If you ever sit around and fellowship with brother Dawn, he has a lot to say and uh in a great way. I'm not saying it in a bad way, in any in any way. I mean it to be the the greatest of compliments to see what the Lord has done in our brother's life and in the life of his family. Is your family here today? They're at home. They're still not well. We want to continue to remember Sister Rebecca and the kids as well in prayer. &gt;&gt; But I'll be away next weekend in Grand Prairie. I coveret your prayers as we're there. Just bringing some encouragement to the saints there and uh pray for brother Dawn if you don't mind. I want to continue on uh it's been a long time actually, a few weeks now since we talked about questions and answers. We've mentioned it to the church in the past um and brother Brham mentioned it in his church and we know that the the books the volumes of cood conduct order and doctrine are actually put together and uh they're just a series of questions and answers that were given to the prophet to the seventh angel messenger to William Mary and Brandham the man whom we do not worship I actually I think it's so beautiful to uh be able to say that you know we get so many questions now I It's wonderful. And you know, one of them that came through, I believe, I'm just going to read it and I'm just going to I'm just going to preach from my heart here for a minute. It's important to get the questions. We've asked people to write them down and just drop them in the offering or give them to a deacon or just give them to me. Um or even send a text message, whatever you want, however you want to communicate it. But what it means is that there's a question in your heart. If it's a spiritual question, there has to be a spiritual answer. &gt;&gt; And we're certainly thankful for that. Brother Random said specifically that it shows what's in the heart of the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's wonderful because we have the opportunity to grow. And I'll tell you, it's caused me to grow as I research the answers for the questions because I could give you brother Barry's answers, but they're going to be of no value. The only value is going to be the the answers according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's what's going to change our bodies. But it's wonderful that we have the questions because it means that there's something that we could actually learn. So, we're doing this together. I'm just saying this. We're doing this together. But this one here, I I didn't have to research it. I'm not going to research it. I'm just going to tell you straight as the pastor of Calgary Living Word. Absolutely straight as an arrow with I don't know if anybody hunts here with a broadhead tip on it that's razor sharp. All you have to do is just touch it and it'll actually slice you open. I'm going to make it that sharp and straight. It needs to be, brothers and sisters. And I know everyone is pausing now. We're gasping. What is it going to be? This one says, "God bless you." In most churches in Congo, this is what it says. I'm not saying this. This is what it says. In most churches in Congo, it says WMBB. I'm assuming that says William Mary Brham is worshiped as a god. And the word god is capitalized and it's underlined twice. In most churches in Congo, William Mariam Brham is worshiped as a god and he is called God. &gt;&gt; There's two of questions here. I'm going to address that one first. That is an antichrist spirit. &gt;&gt; Straight up. It's an evil spirit of the devil straight from hell. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anybody that would worship William Mary and Brandham has actually missed exactly what the message of the hour is &gt;&gt; because what William Mary Brham is not the message of the hour. He was the messenger of the hour. &gt;&gt; He brought a message to the world of Christ. &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Back on earth again. &gt;&gt; And he even said it in his message. If you listen to it, he says clearly, "This is the appearing &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; So, what happened on Sunset Mountain? We could go a long ways with it. I'm just going to address this. It's going to be short and sweet. Anyone that worships William, Mary, and Brandham is actually going to go into the tribulation. &gt;&gt; They are going to miss the rapture. They have completely missed the purpose of the message of the hour entirely. &gt;&gt; Entirely. &gt;&gt; It's a deity spirit that came around and tried to trip up the prophet at a very significant time in his life in his ministry. It came around in 1962 to try and get William Mary and Brennham to embrace that spirit, the deity spirit. But he wouldn't. He said to them, "You make me a heretic. you make me an antichrist if I do that. &gt;&gt; So as soon as you stop, I'll actually go back on the field. He literally took himself off the field &gt;&gt; because of it. &gt;&gt; He said, "You make me an antichrist by doing that. You make me an antichrist, &gt;&gt; not him." &gt;&gt; Anybody that would do that would take and make this prophet an antichrist. And and you could never take and make him an antichrist. You could never take his message and make him an antichrist, but you could actually make it a figment of your imagination. And that's what's happened. The Lord said that in the last days, they will be given over to a strong delusion. And people that think that he's God have been given over to a strong delusion. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean they can't be saved. It doesn't mean they can't be delivered. &gt;&gt; We We love We love the sinner, right? &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; We hate to sin. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter. I'm going to say this clearly because it says on here in the Congo, I want to say it clearly because the deity spirit is not race. It's not geographical. The deity spirit is international. &gt;&gt; And the deity spirit is multicultural. &gt;&gt; The deity spirit is in every single church. &gt;&gt; And it behooves the believers to make sure that they don't actually subscribe to that spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just because the angel of the Lord came down and visited this man does not mean this man died for our sins. &gt;&gt; There's only one, and we're going to get into that a little bit later. There's only one. Hebrews chapter 10, go and read it. It speaks about it. &gt;&gt; William, Mary, and Brandham was not the Lord. &gt;&gt; Anyone that worships William Mary and Brham has missed the message entirely. &gt;&gt; It's a deity spirit and it's an evil one. And it came in 1962 to try and trip up the prophet as I said because what was going to happen in 1963 something real significant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seven angels meet brother Brandham meet this man on top of a mountain and tell him to go back to Jeffersonville because those seven seals that have been sealed before the foundation of the world that John looked upon and and that voice told John, "Seal it up, John. It's not for your day." Daniel desired it and asked about it and he said, "No, it's not for you either, but it's for that group of people, that elect group of people at the end of time. &gt;&gt; It's for those people." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just before those seals were open, that spirit had a poke to try and see if he could actually trip them up. But he didn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you're never going to trip up a true son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll say this. Someone who isn't baptized with the Holy Ghost can be tripped up. And that's the differentiating factor right there. That's what we're going to get into today is the Holy Ghost. And I know some people will grown. And I think if you grown, you probably need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say it straight today. This ain't time for fooling. &gt;&gt; This is not playtime. This is about changing our bodies. We need the greatest faith that we're ever going to see in any one of the ages in this age. &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we're not going to see a body change. &gt;&gt; It's not about playing church, brothers and sisters. But anybody that would worship William Mary and Brandham or the image of William Mary and Brandham, they've missed the mark. &gt;&gt; We need to have a discussion because that's not what the message of the hour is. The second part of this, it says having WMBB, William Mary Brandham photo in at the home is a part of worshiping him. I'm assuming that that's what some people do. And and maybe when they go into people's houses now even and they see a picture of William Mry and Brandham on the wall or or maybe on a bookcase with the the halo over his head or the pillar of fire as we commonly refer to it as maybe they consider that to be worshiping William Mary and Brandham. And I think it's real important to recognize &gt;&gt; we worship Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's who we worship. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's who we worship. We don't worship William, Mary, and Brandham. &gt;&gt; And anyone that says that we do, they're a liar. &gt;&gt; It's another lying spirit, right? &gt;&gt; We know there's lying spirits. And and they're not afraid to come and and kneel down right before the throne of Almighty God and say that I'll go and do your will. I'll make your will come to pass in those people's lives. &gt;&gt; Lying spirits, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's a lie to say that we worship William, Mary, and Brham. And anybody that does it is completely off their rocker in terms of what this message is about. That picture was given for a reason. We could go into detail about it and maybe I will just for a little bit. There was a time where this minister, he was a denominational minister. He was a a Pentecostal minister, a Baptist minister is what he was. Best Dr. Best, he had the PhD on the word. And what he wanted to do, he said he advertised it around town. And he was going to take this heretic Brandham guy and he was going to tack his hide to his study wall. He was going to actually embarrass him and show that he was a fraud. And we know that you're never going to be able to do that with the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; But there was pictures that were taken, wasn't it? Seven pictures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seven pictures were taken. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Six of them. &gt;&gt; Remember, six of them were blank. Those pictures were Dr. best on the stage trying to actually make fun of of uh Bosworth, right? &gt;&gt; Because William Brandham said, "I'm not even going to go and debate this guy. I'm not going to do it." And Bosworth said, "Just let me, Adam. I'll do it. Let me go." And he said, "Okay, but don't fight." &gt;&gt; So he went up and he said to him, "The the redemptive names of Jehovah." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do they apply to Jesus? &gt;&gt; Right? Those redemptive names, do they apply to Jesus? And we know that he couldn't answer. And it's the same exact spirit that Jesus encountered when they came and and said to him, "By whose authority do you do this healing? This tremendous healing." And what did he say? Hey, John's baptism. Is it of God or of man? &gt;&gt; You tell me and then I'll tell you. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Oh, we cannot tell." And he said, "Neither do I. I'm not going to tell you whose authority is. I don't have to." &gt;&gt; But it was the same spirit there on stage. But anyways, Dr. Best was putting his fist in the in the in the prophet's representative's face. Dr. Dr. Best was just trying to make a mockery of it. And there were seven pictures taken by a professional photographer that best hired for that night in the Sam Houston Coliseum. And what happened? Six of those pictures, they actually were blank, &gt;&gt; overexposed, nothing on them. But the seventh one, &gt;&gt; the seventh one. Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; That's not a man that we worship. &gt;&gt; That's God saying that's my prophet. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; But if anybody has this in their house, I want to say it loud and clear today. Just like I said, sharp and and and and just like the word, right? If anybody has this in their house and and they consider it to be something that they worship, maybe they put some candles there, maybe they have incense around it, you're wrong. You're mistaken. &gt;&gt; You're making this an antichrist spirit. &gt;&gt; But you'll never ever make the message an antichrist spirit. You'll never denominate it. &gt;&gt; What you do is you take and tarnish the image that you have of it. And and you follow an antichrist spirit. &gt;&gt; But that picture was to identify this is my man. This is the guy that I have sent after six ages &gt;&gt; in the seventh age &gt;&gt; to identify myself with &gt;&gt; hear his words &gt;&gt; and remember brother Brandham even when he came down the angel of the Lord brought him down to the from the balcony brought him down his people his family were like don't go down there but he did it anyways &gt;&gt; he did &gt;&gt; and what did he say he just showed love he didn't go and debate and we know that's the strongest force in the universe is love. &gt;&gt; But there's times where we need to say it straight. Sometimes it has to be exactly laser beam straight. And this is an antichrist spirit. If somebody worships William Brandham or the image of William Miriam Brham, they've got it wrong. And I want to say this also. Don't think for a second if you are coming from that background anywhere in the world, doesn't matter what race, doesn't matter what continent. If you come from a background where people do that because you walk into a church here in North America and you see that picture or you come into someone's home and they have a picture of William Brandham there, that doesn't mean they worship him. &gt;&gt; Amen. It means that they appreciate that supernatural occurrence that happened with that guy because that guy led them directly to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So wherever it is in the world, if they worship William, Mary, and Brandham, they're wrong. &gt;&gt; And they do a real disservice to the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; But they'll never stop it, &gt;&gt; right? because the truly elect will see it &gt;&gt; and they'll move forward. &gt;&gt; I just wanted to get that one because I thought it was pretty straightforward and simple. I hope it's okay. If anybody has any questions about it, I'm certainly happy to talk about it. And uh there's nothing to debate about it. It's just simple. It's it's wrong to worship William Brham. Period. And if you have an image of William Brham and you worship that, it's wrong. Period. And worship Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one that came as God in the flesh to die and make remission for our sins. He's the only one and anybody else is false. &gt;&gt; Anybody else? So, God bless you whoever sent that. I know it takes courage to submit questions and uh we certainly want to try and address them in a in a really kind, loving way, but also uh direct and straight because like I said, we're not we're not playing around here. This is not a time for play. This is this is life or death. &gt;&gt; This is life or death. And today I want to get back into the question that we had a little while ago. It was one question with four parts. What does it mean to truly What does it mean to be truly born again? What does it mean to be truly born again? Just a beautiful question. Is it a different feeling? What happens to your actions? And how do you change? Because of the nature of this question, I feel like I could probably preach till we have a body change on this question and the different parts therein. And likely I probably will because it's vital and and I think that perhaps in some ways I have already. But what does it mean to truly be born again? Is it a different feeling? What happens to your actions? How do you change? Brother Brandham, he preached a message. Ye must be born again. And the last time I preached on this, we talked about this question. I actually took a few quotes from there. And I'm not going to quote us to death today. I'm going to simply preach the word. And I hope it's okay. You know, we all have to be born into this world. And we have to be born into this world through the fall in the garden. That's how we get born into this world. We don't get born by the way that we were supposed to. The way the original word was supposed to happen. It was the spoken word being the original seed. And if anybody's interested, we probably already know all of us that Brother Brandham preached a six-hour sermon on that morning and night. Two two sermons in one day. That's uh that's a big day. Two three-hour services. But he preached a sermon called the spoken word is the original seed. And he addresses this very clearly in that message about how there was a fall in the garden. We know there was a fall in the garden. And I talked about it last time. The serpent was not a snake. The serpent was not cursed. When God came into the garden and said, "Adam, where are you?" He didn't say, "Eve, where are you?" He held Adam accountable. And it's the same God today that we serve. He doesn't come down and say, "Why is your family a mess, misses?" If our family's a mess, he comes down and says, "Son, what's going on?" &gt;&gt; Because our relationship naturally is a type of our relationship spiritually. &gt;&gt; And that's a direct quote. I don't have it here now, but I know Brother Brandham says that. So, if we're getting bumpy waters in our relationship down here, we better take a look up there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we have all been subject to this fall that happened in the garden. None of us can escape it. Because we're born into a message home doesn't mean that we escape it. And and you can see where I'm going with this. I'm going to make sure that we underpin this all the way, every single step of the way. We have all got to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And you know, we've got to not only just go and say, "I want the baptism of the Holy Ghost." But we need to know that we have it &gt;&gt; because it's the token. And there's only one way to get it. And that one way to get it is full obedience &gt;&gt; to the complete word of God. &gt;&gt; That is what is going to entitle us to this token or the Holy Ghost in our life. But because of the fall, everyone in this world is born the same way. &gt;&gt; Isn't it interesting? Sinners and saints, we're all born the same way. No one is exclusive to it. Everyone falls under this curse. &gt;&gt; Once upon a time, we were supposed to be born by the spoken word. But we know that Adam and Eve, they changed things the way things were were set up in in the garden. And because of that, now here we are. And you know, we've we've heard it said many times, you know, born in sin, shaped in iniquity, we come into the world speaking lies. It's based on the scripture Psalms 51. Behold, I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me. This is David lamenting the actions in his life. David had some things, some attributes in his life that God had to take out of him. &gt;&gt; He had adultery in his life. That's God had to take it out of him. Can you imagine that? He was a man after God's own heart, but yet he had adultery. He was a man after God's own heart, but yet he had murder. We're all subject to those things in our lives &gt;&gt; unless we actually get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Because when mankind chose to reject God's provided way at the fall, what happened was they accepted Cain's way, which is a terrible thing. But here we are in a hybrid condition now, which is what Cain was, right? Cain was a hybrid thing, &gt;&gt; not even a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was he a person? &gt;&gt; I don't think so. &gt;&gt; Because the serpent wasn't a person. The serpent was not human. &gt;&gt; And it's one of the most twisted things when you really step back and look at it because the relation wasn't even human to human. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's where we know the denominational world will go screaming and yelling down the road, pulling their hair out, saying, "You're a heretic to even say such a thing." &gt;&gt; But why was it so important that God would actually curse &gt;&gt; everyone in the garden? Because they ate an apple really &gt;&gt; or an apricot. It depends on probably the decade and maybe the theologian who is actually uttering forth the the edict for the generation in terms of all of the theology schools. But we know that many times they say it was an apple. But everyone was born because of the fall in the garden by the desire the flesh desire of our parents. None of us chose to come to earth. I know. I don't recall saying, "Can I can I go and be born in Clarisome, Alberta? I just want to come to earth so bad. I just want to be a part of this world and and deal with all of the victories and all of the defeats. I want to experience all of the emotions. &gt;&gt; No, something happened. My parents caused my life to happen here." And we know that it was exactly according to the word of God. Every single one of us is born the way that we're born to fulfill the word of God. &gt;&gt; There has to be people to receive the word of God. There has to be people that will be born again because he has an elected group of people from before the foundation of the world in every single age that have to manifest the word for their day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know, because of that fall that happened, because of that flesh desire, God gave man an avenue of escape originally in the garden, didn't he? Adam and Eve, they wanted to actually cover up their sin. They wanted to take and make an an a new religion, right? They wanted to make aprons of leaves, &gt;&gt; a covering. And that's what happens to religion if we just have religion without the spirit. And don't think for a second that the message of the hour can't be just a religion to people &gt;&gt; because we can be a part of a message group but not go all the way into Christ and have his spirit manifesting through our lives. That's why I think this question is so magnificent and beautiful. Whoever wrote it, God bless you. It's so vital to us. What does it mean to be truly born again? Well, it means that we've been born in sin shaped in iniquity to come to this world speaking lies. We have got to have an experience with the Lord Jesus Christ for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Because we come from a message church, because we come from a message parent, it does not mean that we have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Our parents are our protection, our leadership, our direction. We heard about it on Friday. It was so beautiful. I'm going to get into it a little bit, but we have we as parents, we are that protection. We are the Holy Ghost for our children, but only to a certain point. As soon as our children start to say, I can think for myself immediately is the count the point of accountability. They don't have to just leave the house. Sometimes they just start to make decisions on their own and they think, we know that children get this way. &gt;&gt; They get much smarter than their parents. Even when their parents say things, you can see the the wheels turning in their head and they know. They know. They know. Don't worry guys, not my kids. Of course, my kids. I see it all the time. And you know, shockingly, what I think is so cool, sometimes they're right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes they got better ideas than me. And I just think it's wonderful, especially when it comes to lifting and moving stuff. But you know, every one of us is subject to this curse, the fall in the garden. And and God gave us a way of escape, and it's through the blood. Adam and Eve attempted to have their own religion, and we know that God said, "That's nice and everything, but here's what it's going to be. It's going to be animals until the cross. It's going to be blood of bulls and goats. That's what it's going to be." And so, here's some animal skins. Now, kindly get out. And he kicked him out of the garden &gt;&gt; and he said, "Go worship the way that you want to worship now. You chose your own way. &gt;&gt; Go enjoy it." &gt;&gt; And he put flaming swords in the hands of cherubams blocking their way to the tree of life, which was Christ. We know that. That was the garden. That was the story. And we know that in the day in which we live, those cherubams have been taken away. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it's actually death to us to stay out &gt;&gt; to stay away from that tree of life. &gt;&gt; Now it means death. It's exactly the opposite of the way it was in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; But God gave man an avenue escape and that was through the blood. &gt;&gt; Let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 10. Hebrews chapter 10. So beautiful when we can see the word here and just see how it how it actually applies to us in the day in which we live. Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect. And we know that word perfect means complete mature. The blood of animals, bulls, and goats could never actually do that. It just never could. Verse two says, "For then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins." But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. So brothers and sisters, I think it's important to remember that we can easily create a hybrid religion if we're not careful. If we come to the place where we believe that somehow I'm lost today &gt;&gt; and I'm saved tomorrow and right now today I'm saved and tomorrow when Monday comes around something happens to me and well I trip and I fall and I'm lost. That is it's absolutely a lie. &gt;&gt; I'd say it's a denominational lie. I grew up in a Pentecostal church and they taught that very clearly that you need to get to the altar. You need to repent because you've fallen. We all fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you're truly a son of God, you're always a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what could happen? Someone in the world could come and try and tell one of my boys that they're not boys, that they're girls, and they're going to tell them they're crazy &gt;&gt; because I know what I am. &gt;&gt; Someone in the world could come and tell them that you're not the son of Barry Allen Johnson. and they'll laugh at them and say you're crazy. &gt;&gt; You can take a DNA test. You cannot change that fact. It's a fact. &gt;&gt; And that's one of the things, one of the mysteries that William Brandham brought through the spoken word is the original seed is that you cannot be lost. You can't be saved today and lost tomorrow. &gt;&gt; If you are a son today, you always were a son. If you're a daughter today, you always were a daughter. You just recognized it one day &gt;&gt; and there's always always a time appointed of the father &gt;&gt; for people to recognize this is the day &gt;&gt; and you know I'll tell you I'm so thankful we got a little bit of a a preacher cam and it's for worship and and I get to watch people worshiping and you can see those people that just have the liberty of the spirit They're free in the Lord to worship him. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to harp and and preach about worshiping, but there's something about it. When a person recognizes what it means to be redeemed, &gt;&gt; when I'm redeemed, and nobody can take that away from me, it doesn't matter how I feel. It doesn't matter what I say. It doesn't matter what I do. I'm a son. I'm a daughter. And that's that. &gt;&gt; There's a real liberty that comes over them. And it's an opportunity to give your praise back to God. I thought it was so beautiful last weekend to be clear. You know, there's coming a time where we're not going to be preaching the message. We're not going to be preaching the word. We're not going to be saying there's conduct, order, and doctrine. We've got to do things a certain way. We're going to be in heaven. We're going to be before the King of Kings. We're going to recognize that we were one of the few. &gt;&gt; And what are we going to do? We're going to worship him. We're going to worship him so passionately. All of heaven is going to be silent &gt;&gt; just to listen to that group because no one else is redeemed in heaven &gt;&gt; except those elected ones. &gt;&gt; Nobody else in heaven. Remember the ones that rebelled? I remember having this question. Well, how could people be redeemed and not angels? That's God's choice, &gt;&gt; not mine. &gt;&gt; I don't have to choose it. I don't have to understand it. I just need to know that I'm one of them. And when I sing that song, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm not so glad that I can say I'm a branomite. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of those redeemed, &gt;&gt; one of those redeemed ones that he called through the seventh angel messenger. &gt;&gt; And it changes the song alto together. &gt;&gt; It changes the perspective to recognize really what are we doing here? This is not about just getting together and having church. This is about recognizing that all of those people that went on before us, the heroes of the Bible, are leaning over the banisters of heaven saying, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; But you know, verse four says, "For it was impossible, for it was not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice and offering, thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me. And we know that goes back to Psalms 40. Verse 6 says, "And burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin, thou hast had no pleasure." Can you imagine through all of that? He's had no pleasure &gt;&gt; since the fall, blood of bulls and goats, people coming in and bringing their sacrifice and then going home bringing the same desires, leaving with the same desires. Never a change in their life. They've done their spiritual duty. Amen. I came. I brought my sacrifice. God bless you. And they go home. The exact same people. Could you imagine? I I think it's astounding because some people try and do that here. But you know, when we do that here, we're only going to be worse or better. We're not going to leave the same because that's not the covenant that we live under. &gt;&gt; In burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin, thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, lo, I come in the volume of the book, it is written of me to do thy will, oh God. above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither had pleasure therein which are offered by the law. &gt;&gt; Then said he, lo, I come to do thy will, oh God, he taketh away the first that he may establish the second. M &gt;&gt; many times when we think about that prayer in the garden when Jesus said guys come let's pray what was he praying I read this and I think man that must have been a heavy prayer and we know it was because he sweat drops of blood that was the first atonement for our sins was his prayer saying these words in the garden &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; for us so that we could be here receiving this word &gt;&gt; by the witch By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once for all. And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftent times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins. That's why brothers and sisters, I'm going to pause right there. We're going to get into this a little further as we go, but I just want to say this. Let's not come to the house of the Lord and just offer the same sacrifices for sins and say, you know, I just did my duty. I did my civic spiritual duty and you know, I'm a message believer and bless God and go home and come back next week and go home and come back next week and go home and just live a different life when we go home and think that everything is okay when we go home and we come back and offer the same thing next week and everything is good because God's blessing us. &gt;&gt; That's not the way it's supposed to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be on fire for the Lord in the lives in which we live. And it's supposed to make a change in our lives. &gt;&gt; If it's not making a change, there's something wrong in our lives. &gt;&gt; But isn't it beautiful? Because God came himself and said, you know what? I never did have pleasure in those sacrifices. So, I'm going to come and I'm going to actually make it happen myself. He came and made atonement once and for all for all of mankind. It's so beautiful. He came to be the total atonement. &gt;&gt; So for us to think that there's something that we can do that's going to garner us, that's going to merit us favor in the kingdom of heaven, we have a hybrid religion. &gt;&gt; It's crucial that we understand this, brothers and sisters, because there's nothing that we can do to merit our position in the kingdom of heaven other than just accepting it, saying, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the greatest gift that we could ever have given to us. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom preaches that message. Works is faith. Tell me all about your faith. But I can see your works. &gt;&gt; Big deal. You got so much faith. You know the message. You can quote the quotes. You've been a message believer your whole life. And all these things you have done from your youth. But there's one thing thou lacks. We heard it on Friday. It was so beautiful. Message believer from his youth, raised in a message home. Everything he did was precise. God even acknowledged that when he stood there and told him, but he said, "There's one thing thou lackest." &gt;&gt; And remember, we heard it on Friday for those that didn't hear it. The love that was being expressed to him identified the lack. It was love that identified it. It wasn't it wasn't a scourging. It wasn't being brutal. It wasn't abusive. It was God saying, "If you just change this one thing in your life, you will see a greater success than you've ever imagined." And I say, "Lord, help me." &gt;&gt; We're all sinners saved by grace. [snorts] You know Hebrews 10 verse 12. He says, "But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever." One sacrifice for sins forever. &gt;&gt; And you know forever speaks of a space of time &gt;&gt; that's not eternal. So I think it's important for us to recognize that space is a space of time &gt;&gt; on earth. &gt;&gt; It is a space of time that we need it. &gt;&gt; It's God's provided way for us in the time that we need it. &gt;&gt; Just like healing in our bodies. We don't need healing in the millennium. &gt;&gt; We don't need healing at the marriage supper of the lamb. We need healing right here and now. &gt;&gt; That's why we need healing. But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God. And we know that sitting down, it represents a lot. &gt;&gt; It looks like just as we read it, it's real simple, but that represents a lot. That represents power and authority and sovereignty of God to be able to sit down and take your rest. It's over. It's finished. There's nothing else that can be done. goes on in verse 13, from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foottool, knowing that it's completely finished. When he bowed his head and died on the cross, he knew exactly what was going on. Satan didn't know what was going on until he knocked on the door of hell and Satan thought, "Oh, I've got you now. I knew you were coming here. We expected you." But then he did what? He grabbed him by the throat and said, "Not this one, buddy. this time you failed. &gt;&gt; And he stripped him of the keys of death and hell. &gt;&gt; And then what did he do? He led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. &gt;&gt; Verse 14 says, "For by one offering he hath perfected, completed, set apart." He had perfected, completed, set apart, matured. He did it all. Jesus paid it all. All to him I owed. &gt;&gt; Sin had left a crimson stain, but he left it white as snow. &gt;&gt; By one offering, he had perfected forever. Again, that space of time, he had perfected forever them that are sanctified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us. So for people to say, well, I've got the Holy Ghost. I believe God sent the prophet and and I believe the message of the hour, but I'm still not afraid to just make sure that I always always come out on top on every single business deal that I do. And it doesn't matter who goes down because of it. They made a mistake and they're wrong and I'm right. But what about grace? &gt;&gt; What about actually not digging up the past in a person's life and saying, "Don't you remember what you did to me 10 years ago? You did that to me. Remember, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; we could talk about charity, which is love &gt;&gt; in Corinthians. &gt;&gt; It's not puffed up. &gt;&gt; It doesn't vaunt itself. It's not always first. I don't have to be first in everything because I'm the king. &gt;&gt; No, no. The fathers of the homes are servants. Just like the pastor of the church is a servant to the church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And as soon as we get that mentality, we're not fit for that office, &gt;&gt; unfortunately. &gt;&gt; And what we need is a character change. What we need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And when that happens, something happens in our life for us to say that I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but yet I still have these characteristics in my life. I don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say this. We're going to say it straight out. &gt;&gt; Ask your spouse. Ask your spouse. What do they say? Are you the same person at home that you are at church? &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're not, why aren't you? &gt;&gt; Tell me why. &gt;&gt; Is it because home is a better place and I can just let my hair down and behave differently? &gt;&gt; Why would we be different people at home than we are at church? &gt;&gt; Ask your children. Yes. &gt;&gt; Do the children say that you're the same person that we see in church with the believers? &gt;&gt; If they don't say it, why not? &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, this is not time to fool around. We got to make sure that token is applied the right way in our homes, our children, our wives, our congregation, our church is depending on it. &gt;&gt; The death angel is coming through the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he don't care who he can devour. In fact, I think he has a special taste for children. &gt;&gt; And as parents, if we're not applying that token correctly by setting the example, sir, &gt;&gt; not just saying it, by doing it, &gt;&gt; the devil's coming. &gt;&gt; He's going to eat your lunch. &gt;&gt; I think it's just beautiful this scripture here. Verse 15 says, "Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us." &gt;&gt; It's not just looking at brother and saying, "He's got the Holy Ghost. I can see the witness in his life." And just living my life and not expecting to see the Holy Ghost in my life. Brothers and sisters, don't look at anyone else. Look at yourselves in the mirror of God's word and say, "Do I see the Holy Ghost?" Because if I do see the Holy Ghost, then I've got every reason to have liberty to worship with all of my heart in the church of the living God. This is the place to let it roar. This is the place to let it go. Brother Bradom said we should be just as exuberant as all of those people out in the world. Anybody here ever been to a hockey game? NHL hockey game? Anybody? Go ahead. I'll say it's not sinful. We know that all things aren't expedient even though they're lawful. &gt;&gt; I mean, they play music there and they do things there. You go to a CFL game. Anybody gone to one of those? I've been to both. Anybody ever go to a a a cricket match? A cricket match when there's a stadium full of people and they really do whatever they do in cricket. I was there, but I don't even know how they play it. I know they got a paddle and it's made from really strong wood, really good wood. But we should be just as exuberant as they are. &gt;&gt; And so I want to say today, brothers and sisters, if we get exuberant for other things in the world, but we don't hear, what's our problem? &gt;&gt; What are we missing? This is a sanctuary. And you know the sanctuary, sometimes we can have it in our minds. The sanctuary is the place, the holy of holies. It's behind the inner veil. Indeed, it is. &gt;&gt; And even a child running in an aisle after a service can upset the spirit for the next service. &gt;&gt; Parents, it's important to make sure that we understand this. That's what the prophet said, not brother Barry. Amen. &gt;&gt; But what I'm saying is let's not look at it that way. Let's just change our perspective. Let's take another camera angle view at it and say this. This is the sanctuary of safety. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where you can just let your hair down and worship the way that you always wanted to worship and said, "Maybe I wish I could just worship that way." Today's your day. You can do it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait for some other day. This is your day. &gt;&gt; I said I wasn't going to preach on worship, &gt;&gt; but you know, God, he desires worship. &gt;&gt; And and he insists on it, in fact. &gt;&gt; And if we're not worshiping God, what are we worshiping? Because we as humans are created to worship something. [laughter] &gt;&gt; We're going to worship something. &gt;&gt; That's right. And I'll tell you, if we're not worshiping God, &gt;&gt; we're worshiping the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; Because as we live our lives, we worship. &gt;&gt; Whether we understand it, whether we accept it, &gt;&gt; doesn't matter. Whether we comprehend it, as we breathe, as we live, as we work, as we aspire to do things in our lives and we dream and we build and we create and we do all this in our lives, we are worshiping. Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I didn't want to get into worship today. My But you know what it is? You got to go with the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all we're going to have one day. &gt;&gt; Is worship. &gt;&gt; So, I think it's important for us to just get used to it now. Get comfortable with it now. What a tremendous thing it is. What an opportunity it is. &gt;&gt; And worship isn't all about music. For the record, &gt;&gt; let's make sure we underscore that it's not all about music. It's not all about singing. &gt;&gt; There's so many aspects to it. We heard about it on the weekend. If you want to go back and and watch it, you can. I don't want to preach on that today. Verse 16 says, "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days." He's going to make a covenant with someone &gt;&gt; after those days, sayeth the Lord. I will put my laws into their hearts, excuse me, and in their minds will I write them. Now, some people would want to say that's just for the Jews. We know that every scripture has a compound meaning and revelation. And we know that this actual scripture here was written to the Gentile church. So, let's not put this off onto the Jews. &gt;&gt; Let's take this and eat it up. &gt;&gt; Even if it makes our belly bitter, &gt;&gt; let's do it because it's going to change our bodies. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I think it's so important to recognize that this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, sayeth the Lord. I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them. The Holy Ghost will say, "I like that." The Holy Ghost will say, "I don't like that." &gt;&gt; And it's up to us to decide, are we going to act on it or not? &gt;&gt; He's going to put his laws into our minds and into our hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how it's going to happen. It's not brother Barry preaching. It's not brother Eugene preaching. It's not brother Jerry preaching. It's not some other ministry out there doing it for us. It's the Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost himself inside of us. &gt;&gt; Writing it in our minds and our hearts. &gt;&gt; But it's so beautiful because verse 17 says, "In their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." &gt;&gt; Remember we preached on this a while ago. When we are willing to actually reject this flesh, when we're willing to reject the mark of the beast and accept the Holy Ghost instead of the opposite, resisting the Holy Ghost baptism and saying, "I'm good. I'm good. I've had it. I know that everything is fine. There's nothing else that you could teach me." As long as we have that behavior, we don't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But as long as we're saying amen to the word of God, that is him pulling on his word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But to think that there's coming a time where there's sins and iniquities. Well, I remember no more. Some people want to put that off to the millennium. Some people want to say amen. That's me right now. Right here. Right here. Right now. And I can say amen to that word because I know what it means. &gt;&gt; I'm not the same person that I used to be. Right &gt;&gt; now where there is remission of the where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin &gt;&gt; saying Lord forgive me I'm a sinner I don't have to pray pray the sinner's prayer even though we don't do that in in in how we believe but we recognize there comes a time where we have to say that I'm a sinner and I need the Lord I need his covenant I need this covenant for me it's good to look at it and say that somebody gets it somewhere along the way. But what about me? It needs to be for me. Having therefore, brethren, I want to say this today. This is where we need to get to. Boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. Not by our blood. Not by some other ministry's blood. By the blood of Jesus, not by the blood of William, Mary, and Brandham. By the blood of Jesus is what the word of God says. By a new and what? &gt;&gt; Living &gt;&gt; living way &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ in flesh. again, his spirit walking and talking in man again. Some people would say, "Well, there you go. You're talking about a deity spirit." No, I ain't. But yes, I am. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the Lord Jesus Christ taking up his abode in our lives through the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to get into answering some of these questions. I'll say it right now. One of them, how will we know that we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost? Will our will our actions change? You bet. &gt;&gt; You bet. So if we're still living our lives acting the same way that we've always acted, do we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Because he's not going to be contrary to his word. &gt;&gt; He's going to have the characteristics of his word. &gt;&gt; He's not going to have the characteristics, even though we probably should say the characteristics of Brother Barry or Brother Jerry or Brother Eugene, is he going to have the characteristics of a minister? We certainly hope so. We certainly hope that the ministers would actually have his characteristics, but don't look to ministry, brothers and sisters. Look to him. &gt;&gt; That's the characteristics that we want. And if you wonder what they are, they're in the word. I'm not going to dig into them too far today. I don't I don't want to do that today. I just want to try and answer these questions. They're so rich, so amazing to look at it. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, and having an high priest over the house of God, let us draw near &gt;&gt; with a true heart &gt;&gt; in full assurance of faith, &gt;&gt; having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. My verse 23 says, "Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering." Let's not go right hand or left hand. Let's stay exactly straight with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without wavering, for he is faithful that promised. &gt;&gt; He's faithful that promised. He will always always lift us up. &gt;&gt; And let us consider what? One another to provoke unto love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to good works. Isn't it interesting how automatically it goes into provoking one another &gt;&gt; to love &gt;&gt; to good works &gt;&gt; one to another? And we know that that's the same thing in the book of Ephesians chapter 5. Before we get into talking about roles, oh the husband and the wife, and you better behave this way and behave that way, how about we submit ourselves unto one another &gt;&gt; in the fear of God first. &gt;&gt; First, let's do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, we uh we heard about it, I believe on Wednesday, that, you know, faith is based on forgiveness. If we're not willing to forgive, then do we really have faith? But let's hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that promised. And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works. And we know he goes on to say, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is." Sometimes we can read that scripture and just say that and leave the rest of it out. I think it's important to get the whole thing. But exhorting one another, encouraging one another, loving one another, and so much more as you see the day approaching. We've said it before in the past many times. You know, sometimes when we go to church, we don't feel like it in our flesh. But maybe it's not for us. Maybe we're not going to church to get a blessing for ourselves. Maybe we're going to be a blessing for someone else because as they struggle in their lives, they're going to go to church and they're going to feel alone like nobody else is going through it. But they're going to look around and they're going to say, "There's brother so and so. There's sister so and so. Look at this family's here. Oh my, look at this family here. And everyone is so happy." Why is it? &gt;&gt; Because it's the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost living out through people. &gt;&gt; I love this this question. Whoever wrote it, my what does it mean to be truly born again? To be truly born again, it means that we have the Holy Ghost in our lives. &gt;&gt; That's what it means. To be truly born again doesn't mean we come to church and that we take a step of faith and we say I I surrender my life to God and that I just want to be saved now and hopefully somewhere along the way it's going to happen. No, we do do that. We do do that and we keep walking and we hold fast the profession of our faith. We keep coming to church and we keep feeding on the word. But there comes a point in time where we truly do get baptized with the Holy Ghost. And I'll tell you what, that is the new birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because us coming to church is just an association. &gt;&gt; Us coming to church, being born in a message church, that is not the new birth. &gt;&gt; That's the old birth. &gt;&gt; The new birth is where I can say I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I know that Jesus lives for me. I have a personal experience with him myself &gt;&gt; and it becomes apparent to everyone around. You know, the the next question is, is it a different feeling? And I believe all of these answers from these questions here, they answer the first question. What is it truly? What does it mean to truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost? Is it a different feeling? Is it a different feeling? I I think we could look at this and say, "Well, yes, it is." But no, it's not. We don't get a different feeling. And I've got a feeling, so I know I can feel that I've got the Holy Ghost. Brother Brandham said, "The Holy Ghost is without sensation. The power of the highest overshadowed Mary and she brought forth a life inside of her. &gt;&gt; She did, &gt;&gt; but it wasn't with a sensation. &gt;&gt; But I do know one thing. It would have been with emotion. &gt;&gt; That's where I think it's so important to recognize, brothers and sisters, that's a big scarecrow in and around the message where people will say, "You can't have emotion. The Holy Ghost is without sensation." Remember, that's what he said. It's without sensation. He didn't say it's without emotion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you get the Holy Ghost, some people scream, some people run, some people shout, some people cry, some people sing, some people speak in tongues, some people have a gift of prophecy, of faith, of healing. We know there's lots of different manifestations of the Holy Ghost, but all of them line up in one place, and that is with the ability to say amen to the word for their day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it a different feeling? &gt;&gt; Getting the Holy Ghost in our lives. Is it a different feeling? It is a different feeling in that you begin to feel differently about things. &gt;&gt; You begin to feel differently about people. &gt;&gt; Sometimes tremendous great hurts in our lives &gt;&gt; can actually just be absolved, &gt;&gt; right? and dissolved and just vanish. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we can have a buzzsaw temper and always be looking for conflict with people and something happens when we get the Holy Ghost in our life and we have a new character. There's new characteristics that start to come out. I feel different in my life. Indeed, yes, you do feel different, but you feel different towards situations and you feel different towards people and you feel different especially towards the word of God. You feel different about wanting to go to church. You feel different about wanting to sing. You feel different about wanting to say amen. You definitely do feel different. But you don't feel different in such a way that I had a chill run over me, so I must I must have the Holy Ghost. Oh my, I raised my hands in church and and I felt this warmth just come over me, so I must have the Holy Ghost. No, not that kind of a feeling. If it's an earthly sense, then we're actually missing the point because all of our earthly senses are designed for us to contact this earthly world around us. &gt;&gt; But there's another sense which is the faith sense. And that one is the one that dials in to what we're talking about today. Is it a different feeling? Indeed, it is a different feeling. You have a different opinion, a different feeling about everything around you. You get a totally different perspective about this word and about the world around you. When people see it, &gt;&gt; don't think it's invisible. We say it many times. It's the invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Sure enough, it is. But after a while, when you recognize really what he says in that message, and you begin to live what he says in that message, what happens to you is it becomes a visible union of the bride of Jesus Christ and the heavenly bridegroom. It becomes very visible because you no longer are the same. You become a new creature in Christ Jesus. It's so beautiful. There's only one way that you can contact it and it's by faith. &gt;&gt; Only believe and all things are possible. &gt;&gt; The next question, what happens to your actions? What happens to your actions? Brother Brandham, he talks about it. You know, how how to deal with things in your life. And you know if you do things that you don't like and uh I don't have the quote with me but I just think it's so beautiful how the Lord brings things to our remembrance. He says if you want to actually change things in your life just do the opposites. And he says this if you're a spoiled brat and you always want your way and you always want things to be first you you're first with everything. He says take just let somebody else have the first. Take a step back. If you're always angry because of things, start smiling. &gt;&gt; Take a step back and recognize it. I was having a conversation with a brother and we were talking about earthly things. And it came to the place in the conversation where he said, "You know what happens is I just get anxiety as I start to talk about all these different things." And really what I need to do is just take a step back and breathe and say, "God's got this all under his control." &gt;&gt; And when we can do that, it brings a rest. But if we're busy getting fussed about this and fussed about that and fussed about the other thing and this other problem and this and that and this and that, they're all they're all distractions of the devil. &gt;&gt; Why are we letting Satan do that to us? &gt;&gt; Why are we letting the devil do that to us? We don't have to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But what happens to your actions? I think it's a beautiful question. This is so good. I'm going to try and answer it all today. I hope it's okay. Maybe we'll go maybe I'll just warn you maybe 10 minutes over. Lord willing maybe we can finish it up in time. It's 10 to 12 now. I don't want to try and keep us too long. But we've got some questions and I want to try and get somewhere with them. I want to try and answer them. And if anybody as we talk about all this along the way, if you have more questions about what I've said, Lord willing, I'm hoping that I'm answering them, but I don't want to create more questions. But even if I do, don't feel bashful. Write them down and and and and let's answer them. Let's study them together and learn and grow together. Amen. &gt;&gt; What happens to your actions? And and this is just some of my notes here. Usually people begin to act differently. That's what happens to your actions. You begin to act differently because the word says that you become a new creature in Christ Jesus. You don't remain the same when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And for people to say that they are the same, maybe they are. Maybe they got the baptism at an early age. Maybe. But maybe not. I would say if our actions line up with the word of God, I would say yes indeed we did get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But if we've got attributes in our life, if we've got things in our life that are identifiers, like we said earlier, if we were to ask a spouse, if we were to ask the children, what are we when we're at home, are we the same people? If we're not, we've got these things in our life, these actions, there's things that we need to deal with. And you know, this answers one of the other questions as we get there, but our actions, they need to be different. If we just simply say, "I've got it and I'm not willing to change in my life," then there's a huge problem. Because you know what one of the biggest identifiers is with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, brothers and sisters, is humility. &gt;&gt; Being humble, &gt;&gt; being able to say, "I'm wrong." &gt;&gt; And and here's the bigger one in a marriage for those people who are married that really seem to struggle with this. And I I'm saying it because I know I do. I want to say I did. But to say I'm sorry. I I know that I did that and I know that that hurt you just now. &gt;&gt; And to deal with it right then &gt;&gt; instead of taking it with me and saying and going away, right? &gt;&gt; And how long does it take to get it all better? Because the longer it's left like that, the worse it gets. &gt;&gt; And many times we just pretend. I just pretend. I'll say it my way. I just pretend, you know, it didn't happen. It's okay. Whatever. It did happen. &gt;&gt; And it's going to be right there until I go back and say, "I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; But you know, sometimes sometimes it happens in life. We do things in a marriage specifically that we can't undo. There's no fixing it and there's no making it better. And the only thing that we can do is say, "I'm sorry." And the only thing that we can do is hope that that person has the level of revelation that maybe I do and that they would offer the level of forgiveness that I'm hoping that they can bring. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what, when we're encountering those situations, the only hope for forgiveness is full complete humility. &gt;&gt; As soon as we start bristling and saying, you know, whatever about that, now there's this. Guess what? We're going right back to square one. right back to zero again. And it's never going to get better. It's always going to be this cycle of problem and problem. Why is it? Because that's never been dealt with correctly. All we've got to do is deal with it correctly. But what happens to our actions is people begin to act differently. They do. For us to say that I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm the same person that I used to be is a lie of the devil. And I really welcome the conversation with anyone to say, "Well, I believe that I I have it and and I'm the same person." You're not the same person. No one has ever had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and stayed the same way. &gt;&gt; Nobody. &gt;&gt; So, what would make us think that we're exclusive? &gt;&gt; I I know what a religious spirit. &gt;&gt; And unfortunately, that's the worst one. There's countless examples in the Bible if you if you wonder. I'm not making this up. There's countless examples of the of it in the Bible where people some people they couldn't see and they got their eyesight. They're not the same person. Some people they couldn't walk but they can walk. &gt;&gt; They were able to move. &gt;&gt; Something happened to them in their lives. Some people they couldn't hear or be able to talk and they began to hear and they were able to talk. Remember, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Some people who met Jesus, they just simply stopped doing what they were doing and lived a totally different life altogether. &gt;&gt; And that's kind of the category that we fit in, eh? Isn't it? Because we can see, we can hear, we can talk, we can walk, we can sing, everything is good in our lives. &gt;&gt; But every single one of those people, they lined up with the word &gt;&gt; when they met the word for their day. Boy, I really wanted to get into what we talked about on Friday night. And Lord willing, I think maybe we'll be able to in the next few minutes here. I I think it's so important to us to to recognize it. Maybe just in the last few minutes. You know, every single one of the people, the examples that we just mentioned in the Bible, they all lined up with the word of God in the day in which they lived. Whether it was with Jesus, whether it was in any one of the church ages that we talk about so often, everyone lined up with the word for their day. That was the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; When someone says they're born again and their lives don't line up with the word, they're not truly born again. &gt;&gt; That's brother Barry saying it straight. But the prophet of God says it, too. He says it in that message. Ye must be born again. &gt;&gt; Go and listen to it. &gt;&gt; I've got a quote, one quote that I'm going to read as we as we wrap it up here. But the last one, I think it is. Is it? Yeah. The last one here of the four questions or the three parts to the one question is how do you change? And I think it's so beautiful. It's like somebody wanted me to preach this service. So they put them in there and crafted it this way so that we would actually preach it in such a way that it just goes full circle. So we know about the problem, brother Barry. We get it. How do we change? Isn't it beautiful to think that there is an opportunity for a solution to the problem? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, he created us to be a certain way, &gt;&gt; didn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He created us in his image. &gt;&gt; Many times we think about, well, he was a spirit and, you know, male and female created he them and in his image. He created us in the image of God. We've got arms and legs and and a head and, you know, we can imagine what God looks like. But I want to say it this way. He created us in his image to be a free will agent. Amen. &gt;&gt; God can make a choice, but his choice is always going to line up with his word. &gt;&gt; And he's given us the choice. Are we going to line up with his word? &gt;&gt; Because it's a choice. &gt;&gt; We have got to choose where we stand. And we know that we we've heard it many times. Choose ye this day. &gt;&gt; Whom are you going to serve? Who who are you going to serve? Are you going to follow Kora and Dayan? You going to follow all of the cunningly devised fables, all of the traditional teachings of man, teaching for doctrines, the commandments of men instead of following the the lively word that we talked about this morning, leadership of the Holy Ghost in our lives. How do you change? One sentence, I could answer it. You fully surrender your entire will. &gt;&gt; You fully surrender your entire will. And some people can do it and some people just can't. And it's not up to us to decide it. &gt;&gt; It's only up to us to just follow the leadership of the Lord in our own lives. &gt;&gt; And our actions will show who is who. &gt;&gt; We don't have to determine it. It's not up to us to determine it. &gt;&gt; And you know, I I just think it's so beautiful because the brother sang that song this morning. Brother Faren, thank you. &gt;&gt; I'll say yes. &gt;&gt; We sang that song. I'll say yes, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know, in my notes, I wrote this down early this morning as I was studying this, as I was meditating on this a as we were trying to to to to come to a place where I felt the leadership of the Lord. And you know what came to my heart was how do you know h how can you actually do this? How do you get the change in your life? I want to say this. It came to me this morning. It's like that party game that you would hear. Now, some people might say, "Well, you're getting very carnal, Brother Barry, for such a spiritual moment." But I believe it is exactly like that. And here's why. We sang the song to actually show me that it is exactly right. &gt;&gt; I'll say yes, Lord. It's like the party game where you just say yes to everything that's spoken to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing when you think about it because I know if I was a child and I know that my parents have said no to me about many different things, but I know now because of the the the covenant of the game, they're just going to say yes to every single thing that I say. Can you imagine that? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But you know, brothers and sisters, I don't think it's any different. &gt;&gt; Is it any different? We say yes to every single thing the word of God says to us in our lives. &gt;&gt; And when we make excuses and we say, "Well, maybe maybe not now." &gt;&gt; Guess what? You said no. &gt;&gt; When you say not now, you said no. &gt;&gt; And you could walk out of the place you're in when you say not now and not have the opportunity. We heard it on Friday. the rich young ruler. He came and went face to face with the word of God. &gt;&gt; And he said to him, "You know what? All of the things that you said you've done from your youth is true. You have served me faithfully. But you know what? Take all you've got, sell it, and come and follow me." While I was listening to this, I thought, man, you know, there's some people, some spirits that would say, yeah, they're probably saying that because he wanted all that tithe. &gt;&gt; But you know what? He he probably couldn't manage all that money if God gave it to him, &gt;&gt; not recognizing that he was talking to God. All of that money that he got came from God. There's not one penny that that rich young ruler got that Jesus did not allow. &gt;&gt; And we heard it on Friday. I thought it was so good that he probably got all of that money through godly means. &gt;&gt; He was a godly man. &gt;&gt; But the love that was in God right there before him told him, "You know what? This is going to corrupt you. And unless you're willing to let go of your riches, and follow me with all of your heart. &gt;&gt; These riches are going to take you down, boy. &gt;&gt; And you know what? He was sorrowful is what the word says. &gt;&gt; Immediately he was sorrowful because he knew that he trusted in the wrong thing. He trusted in his ability with his riches. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we know that took him down because the next part of the story is he lifted up his eyes in hell. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he of course demanded that there should be things going on in his life, right? Oh my. Get that Lazarus guy to go and dip his finger in water because I deserve to have my tongue cool. What do you deserve when you're in hell? You don't deserve nothing. &gt;&gt; Boy, when we get to that place, it's not a good place. &gt;&gt; But we don't have to go there. &gt;&gt; Alls we have to do is say yes. &gt;&gt; We just got to be willing to say yes. It sounds crazy. I know it. But I believe the Lord just showed me that this morning. Every single time, we need to be willing to say yes. And And how do you know that? How How do I know that? I know it by experience. I encountered it in my life. I I just can't explain it any other way, brothers and sisters. When you hear that you should tithe, what are you going to say? &gt;&gt; When you hear that you should give an offering, what are you going to say? &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you should. I say let you make the decision. When the word of God through a vindicated prophet says you should go to church, you should have the desire in your heart to go to church every time the doors are open, what are you going to say &gt;&gt; when when when he says that you should go to church half an hour early just so you can get all of the humanity out of the way so that you can actually get into the spirit of things. &gt;&gt; What are you going to say &gt;&gt; when he says don't cut hair? What are you going to say when he says don't wear garments that pertain to a man? What are you going to say when he says if you've been baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost means you haven't even been baptized at all. &gt;&gt; What are you going to say? &gt;&gt; But he doesn't leave you there, does he? He says, "Have you have you been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?" &gt;&gt; Since you believe, &gt;&gt; but what are you going to say? That's what it comes down to. What are you going to say when the word of God comes your way, comes across your path? What are you going to say? Because every single time it happens and you know that it's contrary to the way that you see things, the way that you believe things, the way that you live things, when you reach that crossroads, sometimes the crossroads, brothers and sisters, too, is just a little tiny deviation. Sometimes it's just what we call a fork in the road, right? And sometimes that road can run parallel for miles and miles and miles. But other times it's a crossroad where you have to come to a complete stop and then make a turn and go the other direction. And remember, brother Brandham said, "We're not building a h we're not building a wall any longer where we're just going down the wall and building it up and going down the wall and building it up. We're building a house." In the message, the rapture, he said it very clearly that we're building a house. It's a three-dimensional object. And you know, in this message, ye must be born again. He talks about it with a contractor, how if a contractor built him a house and he went down there to see that house that that contractor built him and he paid him money to build it according to the blueprint and he saw that things were not the way it was supposed to be according to the blueprint. He's not going to say, "Oh, that's cool. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. We'll just leave it that way." No. Every single thing that a person puts into a house when they custom design a house has a purpose. &gt;&gt; He's going to say, "Tear it down." That's not what I paid you for. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly the way it is for us in the day in which we live. Unless we've got the right foundation, unless we've got the Holy Ghost in our lives, &gt;&gt; all the rest of it doesn't mean anything. &gt;&gt; In fact, I think it does. Forgive me. The rest of it means religion. &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, we just have a nice covering. We've got a great association, &gt;&gt; a great fellowship. And and I don't think that you could choose better people to fellowship with. To be honest with you, the best people on earth are these people right here. &gt;&gt; But why would we want to come only so far? Have just a so far religion where I'm only going to go so far and I don't care what you tell me. I don't care how you say it to me. It's only going to do this much to me. I I just don't understand that for the life of me. Why would we want that? Why wouldn't we want to have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost where we can see the quickening power of the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives? that when we have a need for something, he is right there with us in our lives. But remember, brothers and sisters, we've got to make decisions. Every time we come to that place where the word says something and we believe something else, we've got a crossroad. Are we going to say yes? &gt;&gt; I want to challenge us today. Are we going to say yes? Because if you've said no, or maybe, not now, maybe later, if you've been doing that, this is not the time to be doing that. This is the time to say yes, Lord. Yes. To your will and to your way. &gt;&gt; Change my life. &gt;&gt; I want to challenge you today. If you have had those situations, &gt;&gt; try me. &gt;&gt; Try me and see. &gt;&gt; By saying yes to his word gives you full complete obedience &gt;&gt; which entitles you to the token. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't seen the manifestation of the token in your life, it's for a reason. And I challenge us today to go all the way and say yes because you will see the manifestation of the Lord in your life. And as you do, it just it becomes perpetual. Brothers and sisters, all you can do is worship. All you can do is thank him. It just becomes so wonderful. He's so wonderful, isn't he? &gt;&gt; You got to make a decision. We all have to make a decision. And you know, how do you change? I'll say it again because I know we're over time now. I'll call the musicians. How do you change? You fully surrender. &gt;&gt; You fully surrender your will and your ways, your traditions, your teachings, your ideas, your behaviors. You totally surrender them unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I don't know why, but maybe that picture, maybe you could be so close to the truth, but have it skewed just a little bit, which is enough to make it not have any effect in your life. Maybe there's people here that worship William Miam Brham. &gt;&gt; Stop it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Worship God. &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me as we close. &gt;&gt; How do you change? You fully surrender. You'll only see a permanent change in your life by full obedience to the complete word of God. &gt;&gt; You cannot do it on your own. Brothers and sisters, many times I think maybe we see people live a life and and it looks like they do it on their own. Nobody does it on their own. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nobody can do it on their own. Out of you must be born again. Brother Brandham in 1961 1231 he says so now remember it didn't say you ought to be born again. Now remember, we're in a one room schoolhouse. There's people here that don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that have never been born again. And there's people here are good old veterans of the cross. They've been born again for years and years. And they should be the loudest ameners of the bunch because they know what it means for them and their lives. &gt;&gt; So now remember, it didn't say you ought to be born again, but you must. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you must be born again. This ain't brother Barry just making this sound sharp. This is the word of God for our day. This is the vindicated prophets prophetic utterance from the throne of God to the people in this age who were fore orained who were elected before the foundation of the world to get this word. You must be born again. He says now we as English-speaking people understand what that word must means. That is absolutely. You've got to do it. See, it's a must. &gt;&gt; Not ought to. You'd be better off if you did, but you must be born again. I'll say it this way. It It would actually be better that you didn't hear about it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And not go after it than to hear about it and reject it. &gt;&gt; It would be better that you didn't hear about this Holy Ghost baptism. Uh he goes on to say, "You must be born again." And oh, if if we could just take that word this morning and break it down what it means, how that it's totally impossible. And then if it's that essential and that great that it's totally impossible to enter the kingdom of heaven or even see it until you're born again. And so many different interpretations of that word born again. We ought to seek it out with all of our heart to find out what it means. This is the vindicated prophet saying this. I want to say, brothers and sisters, if you haven't heard this message, you might want to listen to it. You must be born again. Changes everything in our lives. It changes our walk. It changes our talk. It changes our appearance. It changes our desire to worship. It changes everything of our lives. We no longer look at things the way that we used to. We do become new creatures even if we're raised in a message home. It has to be that way because of the way we're born. Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word, Lord. We thank you that we know that your word is your will. We thank you, Lord, for sending us a vindicated prophet. Lord, we don't worship him, Father. We worship you. And Lord, like we heard last weekend, we worship you in spirit and in truth because you [music] have enabled us to be born again. You have enabled us to be baptized with your Holy Spirit, literally your life. So Lord, we have spirit. And Father, in this age, you gave us an open book. You put it back into the hands of man again. So we have truth. And Father, when those two come together, we know that it's omnipotence, that it's truly your life. We thank you, Lord Jesus, that we can worship you in spirit and in truth. And we know, Father, that it's impossible to worship you any other way. And if we've ever tried to worship you any other way, we pray that you would forgive us, Lord. Father, if anybody has worshiped William Brandham, we pray that you would forgive them for it, Lord. Father, if anyone has a picture of him in their house and they look at it any other way than the way that you intended for it, we pray that you would forgive them for it. &gt;&gt; Let us look away to you, Father. Let us look to you because you are the author and you are the finisher of our salvation. And Father, through that message that you gave to us through your prophet, Lord, we have and are working out out our salvation with fear and with trembling, Lord, recognizing that you are a loving father, but you are a just God and you will judge this world only one way, and that's by your word. Help us, Lord, to line up with your word. Father, we love you and we thank you today. Father, if there's anybody here this morning that maybe just hasn't quite given their lives completely over to you, Father. Lord, I pray that today would be the day, Father, that they would be able to surrender their will completely unto you today, Father. That Lord, they would say yes. Oh father, when that time comes in their life where they recognize that they've lived their lives a certain way, but your word says something different. Help them, Father, to say yes. Help me too, Lord. Heavenly Father, I know I'm not exclusive and I thank you for this word, Lord, because it speaks to me just the same. Heavenly Father, we pray that you would be with those who couldn't be here today. &gt;&gt; Wherever they are, Lord Jesus, be with the carpenters in the past. Lord, they would love to be here. Father, we love Brother Jerry and Sister Mary. Lord, brother Andy and Sister Shelley and Sister Beth. Lord, we love the representation of your word. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Over there in the past. And we pray that you would just keep your hand upon them, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be with the busies, Lord. be with all the people, Father, that would love to fellowship with the assembly but just can't because of time or space, Lord. Father, I think about my parents, Lord. I pray that you would bless them as well. Anyone, Father, that would tune in, Lord, and just follow you according to the word that they see. I pray that you would just bless them abundantly. Lord, help us all, Father, to draw close to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that you would be with those who are traveling. Give them traveling mercies. bring them home safely, Father, at the appointed time. Lord, &gt;&gt; now we just ask, Lord, that you would keep your hand upon us as we go our separate ways today, Father. Bless our visitors, Lord. Give them traveling mercies as they drive back home this afternoon. Lord, and we just ask that you would be glorified now in a couple songs before we go, Lord. Just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song? I'll say yes, [music] Lord. I'll say yes. I'll say yes, Lord. [singing and music] I'll say yes to your will, Lord. I'll [music] say yes. Where you lead [singing] me, [music] I will go. [music and singing] I'll say yes, Lord. I'll [music] say yes.
