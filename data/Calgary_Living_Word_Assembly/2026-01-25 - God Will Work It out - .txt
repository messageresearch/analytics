Description:
Before I knew my name, before I drew a breath
He was making ways for me
Now and everyday, in each and every step
He is making ways for me

When my heart is full of doubt
Feels like faith is running out
I've come too far to turn around
I know

God will work it out
God will work it out
One thing I know
One thing I've found
God will work it out, woah
Oh, yes, He will
Oh, things are coming together

Pushing past the fear, fighting to relief
He is making ways for me
And He won't let me down, never ever leave
He's still making ways for me

When my heart is full of doubt
It feels like faith is running out
I've come too far to turn back 'round
I know (I know)

God will work it out
God will work it out
One thing I know
One thing I've found
No, I know God will work it out
Oh, God will work it out
God will work it out
One thing I know
One thing I've found
Oh, God will work it out

Oh
Be encouraged
Be encouraged
Be encouraged, oh

Be still my soul
Be still and know
Lean in, take hold
In God alone
Be still my soul
Be still and know
Lean in, take hold
In God alone (Ooh)
Be still my soul
Be still and know
Lean in, take hold
In God alone
(Be still) be still (oh, my soul) my soul
(Be still) be still and know
Lean in, take hold
In God alone

God will work it out
Oh, I know God will work it out
One thing I know
One thing I've found
Oh, that God will work it out
Oh, I know God will work it out (Yeah)
God will work it out
One thing I know
One thing I've found
Oh, my God will work it out
Oh, my God will work it out (oh, yes, He will, yes, He will)
God will work it out
(One thing) one thing I know
(One thing) one thing I've found
(One thing I know) one thing I know
(One thing I've found) one thing I've found
(I can testify that) one thing I know
One thing I've found
(One thing I know) one thing I know
(One thing I've found) one thing I've found
(One thing I know) one thing I know
One thing I've found
Oh, my God will work it out
Yes, my God will work it out (oh, yes, He will)
Oh, God will ...
