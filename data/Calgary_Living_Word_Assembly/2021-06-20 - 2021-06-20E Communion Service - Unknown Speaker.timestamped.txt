[48:52] times in our lives Lord so many
[48:55] testimonies father of you being a living
[48:58] God in our lives we thank you for your

[49:05] little service here tonight we pray that
[49:07] you would bless the words that are
[49:09] spoken Lord Jesus we pray that you would
[49:11] just give us some some words to consider
[49:14] tonight Lord about our own position in
[49:17] you
[49:18] father that we might leave here
[49:19] different than when we came
[49:22] pray that you would just bless every
[49:24] single aspect of this service tonight
[49:25] Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[49:30] bless you thank you musicians
[49:33] we'll try not to keep everybody very
[49:35] long tonight
[49:37] I know we're still transitioning into
[49:40] two services on a Sunday
[49:44] and I know it's not easy especially with
[49:46] children
[49:47] as we wrap up the school year
[49:50] and all of the things going on in our
[49:52] lives
[49:54] tonight we know it's a special night
[49:55] it's a communion service
[49:58] the next time we do this it will be a
[50:00] communion foot washing
[50:02] according to the word
[50:04] not our own Doctrine
[50:07] tonight I'd like to read continue on
[50:10] with Saint John chapter 6.
[50:15] Saint John chapter 6 and we'll just
[50:17] start from where we read this morning
[50:19] verse 26
[50:22] but we'll read a bit further tonight
[50:30] while you're turning there I'll just
[50:32] make a couple of announcements and that
[50:34] is that indeed brother Mervin will take
[50:37] the service next Sunday night
[50:39] and I truly apologize to everyone for
[50:42] just making it confusing I seem to be
[50:44] real good at that
[50:46] but uh
[50:48] I can admit it too so I apologize we'll
[50:51] have a schedule coming out and we'll
[50:54] just try and stick to the schedule
[50:57] um brother Gilbert had suggested that
[50:59] brother Mervin would take a a part two
[51:02] of what he preached the last time so it
[51:06] uh
[51:07] I think it'll work we'll just see what
[51:09] the Lord has in store for us so brother
[51:11] Mervin will take it and uh pray for him
[51:15] so we'll look for uh worship service as
[51:17] I spoke about this morning likely uh
[51:20] Sunday evening July the 11th we have
[51:23] some brothers that are going to be
[51:24] traveling and we want to make sure that
[51:27] as many people that can be here will be
[51:29] here
[51:30] there's some musicians that really want
[51:33] to be
[51:37] activity so
[51:39] I know it's kind of all over the place
[51:42] but the words that I spoke tonight will
[51:44] be reflected in the calendar so we'll
[51:46] try not to deviate from that and uh we
[51:49] trust that it will just be a blessing to
[51:51] everyone
[51:53] tonight in our scripture let's read from
[51:55] Saint John chapter 6 verse 26.
[52:00] Jesus answered them and said verily
[52:02] verily I say unto you
[52:05] ye seek me not because ye saw the
[52:07] Miracles but because ye did eat of the
[52:11] Loaves and were filled
[52:14] labor not for the meat which perisheth
[52:17] but for that meat which endureth unto
[52:19] everlasting life which the son of man
[52:22] shall give unto you for him have
[52:29] him what shall we do
[52:31] that we might
[52:33] that we might work the works of God
[52:38] Jesus answered and said unto them this
[52:41] is the work of God that ye believe on
[52:44] him whom he hath sent
[52:48] they said therefore unto him what sign
[52:50] showest thou then that we may see and
[52:54] believe thee
[52:55] what does thou work
[53:00] I just have to stop there and just
[53:01] remind everyone
[53:03] these are the people that just watched
[53:05] him break the bread
[53:08] multiply the loaves
[53:11] show us a sign and we'll believe
[53:14] come down off that cross and we'll
[53:17] believe
[53:19] these weren't believers
[53:23] they said our fathers did eat man and
[53:25] the desert as it is written he gave them
[53:27] bread from Heaven to eat
[53:30] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[53:32] I
[53:37] you the true bread from heaven
[53:40] for the bread of God is he which cometh
[53:42] down from heaven and giveth life unto
[53:45] the world
[53:47] then said they unto him Lord Evermore
[53:49] give us this bread
[53:51] and Jesus said unto them I am the bread
[53:55] of life
[53:56] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[54:00] and he that believeth on me shall never
[54:02] thirst
[54:03] but I say unto you that ye also have
[54:06] seen me and believe not
[54:10] all that the father giveth me shall come
[54:12] to me
[54:13] and him that cometh to me will I know
[54:16] Wise cast out
[54:18] for I came down from heaven not to do
[54:20] mine own will but the will of him that
[54:22] sent me
[54:24] and this is the Father's will which hath
[54:26] sent me
[54:28] that of all which he hath given me I
[54:31] should lose nothing
[54:33] but I should raise it up again at the
[54:37] last day
[54:38] and this is the will of him
[54:44] leaveth on him may have everlasting life
[54:47] and I will raise him up at the last day
[54:53] you can imagine as he's speaking it's
[54:56] becoming more and more and more personal
[55:00] he will raise him up he will raise him
[55:03] up and then he starts to transition to I
[55:05] Will Raise them up
[55:09] verse 41 the Jews then murmured at him
[55:12] because he said I am the bread which
[55:14] come down from heaven
[55:17] and they said is this is is not this
[55:20] Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and
[55:23] mother we know how is it then that he
[55:25] saith I come down from heaven
[55:28] it could be the same thing for us
[55:30] brothers and sisters
[55:31] if we have a brother and sister that has
[55:33] a revelation from God
[55:36] be careful
[55:38] if it lines up with the word
[55:40] we don't want to be judging them
[55:43] right
[55:44] how easily we can shift into the carnal
[55:47] realm and judged spiritual things
[55:50] we don't want to do that
[55:52] verse 43 Jesus therefore answered and
[55:55] said unto them murmur not among
[55:57] yourselves
[55:58] no man can come to me except the Father
[56:00] which hath sent me
[56:02] draw him and I
[56:08] it's and they shall be all taught of God
[56:12] every man therefore that hath heard and
[56:15] hath learned of the father come unto me
[56:19] not that any man hath seen the father
[56:21] save he which is of god
[56:25] and he hath seen the father
[56:29] verily verily I say unto you he that
[56:31] believeth on me hath everlasting life
[56:35] I am that bread of life
[56:38] you could imagine he's just stirring him
[56:40] up here by now these people are getting
[56:43] some agitated by these words
[56:46] but he doesn't just stop there
[56:48] he says your verse 49 your fathers did
[56:51] eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead
[56:54] this is the bread which cometh down from
[56:56] heaven that a man may eat thereof and
[56:59] not die
[57:00] I am the living bread which came down
[57:04] from heaven If any man eat of this bread
[57:06] he shall live forever and the bread that
[57:09] I will give is my flesh which I will
[57:13] give for the life of the world
[57:18] verse 52 the Jews therefore strove
[57:21] amongst themselves saying how can this
[57:23] man give us his flesh to eat
[57:29] then Jesus said unto him
[57:31] verily verily I say unto you
[57:34] except
[57:35] ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[57:39] drink his blood
[57:40] ye have no life in you
[57:43] who so eateth of My Flesh and drinketh
[57:47] my blood hath eternal life and I will
[57:50] raise him up at the last day for my
[57:53] flesh is meat indeed and my blood is
[57:57] drink indeed
[58:00] he did he that eateth my flesh and
[58:03] drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I
[58:06] in him
[58:07] as the living father hath sent me and I
[58:10] live by the father so he that eateth me
[58:14] even he shall live by me
[58:18] this is that bread which came down from
[58:21] heaven not as your fathers did eat Manna
[58:24] and are dead he that eateth of this
[58:27] bread shall live forever
[58:30] these things said he in the synagogue as
[58:33] he taught in Capernaum many therefore of
[58:36] his disciples when they heard this they
[58:38] said this is a hard saying who can hear
[58:41] it
[58:42] when Jesus knew in himself that his
[58:45] disciples murmured
[58:47] at it
[58:49] he said unto them
[58:51] Duff this offend you
[58:55] what if ye shall see the son of man
[58:57] Ascend up to where he was before
[59:02] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[59:05] flesh profiteth nothing
[59:07] the words that I speak unto you they are
[59:10] spirit and they are life
[59:13] but there are some of you that believe
[59:16] not
[59:19] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[59:21] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[59:24] tonight we're just so thankful for your
[59:25] word we're thankful for the Bread of
[59:28] Heaven we're thankful for the Revelation
[59:30] that you have given us of that bread
[59:32] Lord Jesus tonight we pray that you
[59:35] would just break it to us once again
[59:37] just a little bit further Lord that you
[59:39] would just Quicken it to our very Souls
[59:41] that when we leave this service tonight
[59:43] we would not be the same
[59:45] we just ask all these things now in
[59:48] Jesus Christ's name amen
[59:50] God bless you tonight you may be seated
[59:54] as I said I won't
[59:57] take a long time
[1:00:00] I don't want to keep everyone late
[1:00:03] but I just felt so inspired to go into
[1:00:06] this this scripture tonight to look at
[1:00:08] this these these people are the ones
[1:00:11] that saw Jesus perform the miracle
[1:00:15] and and here
[1:00:17] we are
[1:00:19] hearing them say to him what what work
[1:00:21] will you give us what sign will you give
[1:00:23] us you must have a sign to show us that
[1:00:26] you know these words that you're talking
[1:00:27] about are actually true
[1:00:30] and and he just he didn't he didn't
[1:00:33] mince words with them
[1:00:36] they were speaking carnally he was
[1:00:38] speaking spiritually and he just
[1:00:40] continued to speak spiritually my father
[1:00:42] sent this this bread from heaven and
[1:00:45] this bread is not the bread that your
[1:00:47] fathers ate in the wilderness and are
[1:00:50] now dead and I don't think they even
[1:00:53] really understood what he meant by that
[1:00:54] that Dead We Know by our Prophet for our
[1:00:58] day said that meant Eternal separation
[1:01:00] from God because they did not believe
[1:01:03] they didn't have faith in their hearts
[1:01:05] to mix with the word when it was brought
[1:01:07] to them through the prophet for their
[1:01:09] day
[1:01:10] brothers and sisters
[1:01:12] I pray that we will have faith to mix
[1:01:14] with the word
[1:01:15] that's brought To Us by the prophet in
[1:01:17] our day because he's Jesus Christ the
[1:01:19] same yesterday today and forever if we
[1:01:21] don't have faith in our hearts to mix
[1:01:22] with that word then we will find
[1:01:24] ourselves the same as those people
[1:01:27] in the wilderness
[1:01:29] Jesus
[1:01:31] God
[1:01:32] Jehovah
[1:01:33] Elohim he finally got fed up with them
[1:01:36] murmuring in the wilderness
[1:01:39] and he finally said to them because of
[1:01:42] your unbelief
[1:01:44] your carcasses are going to fall in the
[1:01:46] wilderness and you will not see the
[1:01:47] Promised Land
[1:01:49] because of your murmuring continually
[1:01:51] murmuring sign Wonder sign Wonder
[1:01:57] your shoes haven't worn out your clothes
[1:01:59] haven't worn out you haven't been sick
[1:02:01] you've been fed you've been given water
[1:02:05] every single need that you've ever had
[1:02:07] you've been given
[1:02:09] ah and you still murmur
[1:02:12] still murmur
[1:02:15] how far down the road are we today
[1:02:18] a couple have said it in here help us
[1:02:20] Lord we certainly don't want to be
[1:02:22] murmuring
[1:02:24] but to look at this word tonight I want
[1:02:26] to take it just a little step further uh
[1:02:29] Brothers I just ask I don't know if the
[1:02:31] furnace is off it's awfully hot can we
[1:02:34] turn the fans on
[1:02:35] if it's not cooling maybe even just like
[1:02:38] the
[1:02:39] ceiling fans
[1:02:41] I'm sorry to interrupt what I wanted to
[1:02:43] do tonight was take this and and bring
[1:02:45] it into our day and talk about this
[1:02:48] bread of life in our day you know when
[1:02:51] we look at the message of the hour when
[1:02:54] we hear the word spoken by the prophet
[1:02:56] we're not hearing the words of a man
[1:02:59] we're hearing the words of almighty God
[1:03:02] that's why God raises up a prophet so
[1:03:05] that he can use the voice of that
[1:03:07] surrendered vessel to speak Words of
[1:03:09] Life unto us to send us that bread from
[1:03:13] heaven
[1:03:14] and we have the opportunity to accept
[1:03:16] that word or reject that word now
[1:03:19] imagine if we're given that word from
[1:03:21] Heaven we're given that loaf of bread
[1:03:23] from Heaven just to make it just a
[1:03:26] simple illustration here if we take that
[1:03:28] loaf of bread and we have to eat that
[1:03:29] loaf of bread that's what's going to
[1:03:31] sustain us but we say no I don't think I
[1:03:34] like to eat the crusts I don't like the
[1:03:36] crust I'm going to cut the crust off but
[1:03:38] the crust has a lot of nutrients in it
[1:03:40] that we need but and that's why it's a
[1:03:43] part of the loaf but if we take and
[1:03:45] alter it and say I'm just going to cut
[1:03:46] the crusts off and eat it without that
[1:03:48] are we getting the full sustenance from
[1:03:51] that loaf of bread
[1:03:52] it becomes altered at that point and
[1:03:54] potentially we miss some of that that
[1:03:56] that nutrient that we need to sustain us
[1:03:59] same thing with the message of the hour
[1:04:01] brothers and sisters but in some cases
[1:04:03] it seems like we can keep the word of
[1:04:05] God not a problem and honor the word of
[1:04:07] God not a problem but we can take the
[1:04:10] message of the hour and we can dissect
[1:04:12] it and take the parts that fit us and
[1:04:14] actually set aside the parts we don't
[1:04:16] like we can say that maybe our parents
[1:04:18] were burned by a Ministry somewhere
[1:04:20] along the way and it's just okay for me
[1:04:22] to now retract back and act a certain
[1:04:25] way because of what I've seen
[1:04:28] God's not going to say to us were your
[1:04:31] parents offended
[1:04:33] he's going to say the same thing that he
[1:04:34] said to his disciples does that offend
[1:04:36] you
[1:04:38] does it offend you does the word of God
[1:04:40] through the prophet for your day offend
[1:04:42] you
[1:04:44] we need to make sure that we've got
[1:04:45] faith in our hearts to mix with that
[1:04:47] word for our day and you know what
[1:04:50] happens brothers and sisters as we have
[1:04:52] faith in our hearts to mix with that
[1:04:54] word for our day the only thing that we
[1:04:55] do is just say Amen
[1:04:57] we just say Amen there's something in us
[1:04:59] that just says amen and what it does is
[1:05:02] it fertilizes that word that seed that's
[1:05:04] in our heart that's in our soul and it
[1:05:06] starts to grow in our lives the exact
[1:05:09] same way that it did with Mary I just
[1:05:10] keep going back to it but I can't get
[1:05:12] away from it to think that Mary the only
[1:05:14] thing she had to do was say be it unto
[1:05:17] me according to Thy word the only thing
[1:05:18] she had to do was believe as we read
[1:05:20] this morning
[1:05:23] out of Jehovah Jireh 1964. brother
[1:05:26] Branham talking about this very
[1:05:27] scripture here he says now we find one
[1:05:30] time Jesus speaking just like watch one
[1:05:33] little quotation here I'd like to make
[1:05:36] Jesus has a great crowd around him and
[1:05:39] it looked like there was too many
[1:05:41] so watch what he said
[1:05:43] he had to shake him down a little bit
[1:05:46] he had to see who's who
[1:05:49] he had to do a little sifting and how
[1:05:51] does he do it by the word
[1:05:54] speaks the word
[1:05:56] Jesus had a great crowd around him and
[1:05:58] it looked like there was too many so
[1:06:00] watch what he said except ye eat the
[1:06:03] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[1:06:05] blood you have no life
[1:06:09] now what do you think that a medical
[1:06:10] doctor
[1:06:12] or any intellectual person would think
[1:06:15] when they heard
[1:06:16] of a man that had a name of being an
[1:06:20] illegitimate child
[1:06:22] and more like a renegade to the people
[1:06:25] of that day
[1:06:27] some guy that just
[1:06:29] came on the scene
[1:06:31] that didn't come on the scene the way
[1:06:32] that it should come the way that
[1:06:34] everyone thought that he should come the
[1:06:37] scholarly way
[1:06:38] the polished way the eloquent way
[1:06:42] born in a stable
[1:06:46] nursed in a rock in a Manger
[1:06:49] we've gone through all of that brother
[1:06:50] brother Ken really went through all of
[1:06:52] that at one point but so he says more
[1:06:55] like a renegade to the people of that
[1:06:57] day to stand up and make a quotation
[1:06:59] like that
[1:07:01] except you eat my flesh and you drink my
[1:07:03] blood why they'd say that man's a
[1:07:06] vampire a human vampire why
[1:07:10] my drink a man's blood and eat his flesh
[1:07:14] you congregation get away from such a
[1:07:17] crazy man
[1:07:19] this is the part that I wanted to get to
[1:07:21] brothers and sisters because we're all
[1:07:23] familiar with that portion of it
[1:07:25] we're all familiar with what he said
[1:07:26] unless you eat my flesh and you drink my
[1:07:28] blood you have no part in me unless
[1:07:30] you're willing to come to the communion
[1:07:32] table
[1:07:33] you have no part in me you can see where
[1:07:36] I'm going with this tonight
[1:07:37] I just felt so inspired to talk about
[1:07:40] this communion is vital
[1:07:43] communion is not optional
[1:07:46] communion is a staple in the diet of a
[1:07:49] Christian
[1:07:52] it's one of the three ordinances that
[1:07:53] our Prophet gave us
[1:07:55] communion table
[1:07:57] foot washing and water baptism in the
[1:07:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's
[1:08:02] amazing when you look at it how those
[1:08:04] three things are together
[1:08:06] if you look at it that way we could say
[1:08:08] that you know the the baptism of the
[1:08:11] Holy Ghost comes by by baptism of water
[1:08:13] correct water baptism in the name of the
[1:08:15] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:08:17] your sins
[1:08:18] that you should be saved right
[1:08:20] but yet those other two
[1:08:23] are a part of of the three that brother
[1:08:25] Branham brought for the church
[1:08:28] how important are those other two
[1:08:31] the one of them is coming and eating is
[1:08:33] flesh
[1:08:33] and drinking his blood and we'll read
[1:08:35] that in second Corinthians tonight
[1:08:38] but
[1:08:39] one of them is just following the
[1:08:41] scripture here and this was really early
[1:08:43] on in his ministry
[1:08:45] unless you eat my flesh and you drink my
[1:08:47] blood you have no part in me there was a
[1:08:49] bunch of make-believers hanging out in
[1:08:51] the church and what he had to do was
[1:08:52] shake them down
[1:08:54] they were getting in the way of the word
[1:08:57] so he had to do a little bit of a
[1:08:59] thinning in the crowd but this is the
[1:09:01] part I wanted to get to tonight brothers
[1:09:02] and sisters
[1:09:04] but the Branham goes on to say this
[1:09:06] he never explained it
[1:09:10] he never explained it
[1:09:13] he says it twice he never explained it
[1:09:15] he didn't have to explain it that's
[1:09:17] right he just wanted to see what kind of
[1:09:19] Faith they had see
[1:09:24] he goes on to say you if you believe
[1:09:27] you'd believe
[1:09:29] I don't care what anybody said
[1:09:33] my if I prayed for 5 000 people tonight
[1:09:38] and all five thousand died tonight
[1:09:42] in the morning
[1:09:44] I'd still be praying for the sick
[1:09:50] see
[1:09:51] it's What God Says is what counts it
[1:09:54] ain't what people does see
[1:09:57] it's not what people does and God he
[1:10:00] said except you eat the Flesh of the son
[1:10:02] of man and drink his blood you have no
[1:10:04] life in you
[1:10:06] my
[1:10:07] that people that intellectual group why
[1:10:09] they said get away from that man he's
[1:10:12] mad he's a wild man
[1:10:14] while he's a human vampire eat that
[1:10:17] man's body
[1:10:19] now he never explained it
[1:10:22] I just find that fascinating
[1:10:24] he just never even explained that
[1:10:28] all he did was Shake him down
[1:10:30] and you know the people who truly
[1:10:32] believed they said wow this is maybe
[1:10:33] getting a little nuts now some of my
[1:10:36] friends have actually left some of the
[1:10:38] people that I witnessed to to get into
[1:10:40] the church to come and follow the
[1:10:42] Messiah they they've left and now I have
[1:10:44] a choice to look like a bit of a fanatic
[1:10:47] and stay with them
[1:10:49] or to actually carry on
[1:10:51] and they made their choice
[1:10:54] they made the choice to carry on
[1:10:56] and you know some might say well they
[1:10:58] couldn't have made a choice but they did
[1:10:59] they had free will but they were
[1:11:01] predestinated
[1:11:03] to follow him even the son of perdition
[1:11:07] the twelve followed them
[1:11:09] well the 70
[1:11:10] they took off they said this is just
[1:11:12] crazy we can't we can't do this
[1:11:14] no way why would we do that
[1:11:17] he wouldn't explain it to us
[1:11:20] we couldn't reason it away so we gotta
[1:11:22] go
[1:11:24] it's not about intellectualism we cannot
[1:11:27] explain it we have to believe it
[1:11:31] he goes on to say now he had 70
[1:11:34] ordained preachers with him
[1:11:37] he thought he had a little too much
[1:11:39] crowd there
[1:11:40] so the crowd walked away from him
[1:11:44] so he had the ordained minister setting
[1:11:46] there
[1:11:47] he'd sent them out 70 of them
[1:11:51] he said what will you say
[1:11:54] when you see the son of man ascending up
[1:11:56] into heaven from whence he came
[1:12:00] prophesying of Acts chapter 1.
[1:12:04] knowing that that was exactly what's
[1:12:06] going to happen
[1:12:08] that he will Ascend right up to where he
[1:12:11] came from that he'll be received up into
[1:12:13] a cloud and that there would be two men
[1:12:15] standing there in white apparel saying
[1:12:17] to him ye men of Galilee why are you
[1:12:19] standing here looking around trying to
[1:12:20] reason this away
[1:12:22] he did exactly what he said he would
[1:12:24] back there with the 70.
[1:12:26] exactly what he said
[1:12:29] go on preach the gospel
[1:12:32] don't try and explain it just believe it
[1:12:37] now he never explained it them preachers
[1:12:40] said this man is sending up into heaven
[1:12:42] from whence he came why we know him
[1:12:45] we know his mother
[1:12:47] we've been to the stable where he was
[1:12:49] born
[1:12:50] we've seen the Cradle he was rocked in
[1:12:54] we fished with him
[1:12:57] looking at the carnal
[1:12:59] not understanding the spiritual
[1:13:03] and you know maybe we can't understand
[1:13:04] it
[1:13:05] and that's the beautiful part brothers
[1:13:07] and sisters that's the thing that I
[1:13:08] rejoice in because I I believe I'm not a
[1:13:10] very smart man but I do believe he's
[1:13:13] given me the ability to believe it
[1:13:17] and that's all we need brothers and
[1:13:19] sisters
[1:13:20] we don't have to understand it
[1:13:23] we don't have to be able to quote it up
[1:13:25] and down and and know all of the
[1:13:27] Nostalgia and the trivia about it we've
[1:13:31] got to believe it
[1:13:32] and you know what I'll just say it
[1:13:34] boldly talk is cheap
[1:13:37] if we're willing to live our lives
[1:13:38] according to the word that demonstrates
[1:13:40] the message that we believe
[1:13:42] I so appreciate what brother Emmanuel
[1:13:44] said last week
[1:13:47] our testimony
[1:13:49] is our message
[1:13:51] and we live our testimony every single
[1:13:53] day of Our Lives
[1:13:55] that just spoke to me
[1:13:57] because you know I can talk about your
[1:14:00] testimony
[1:14:01] and and you can talk about my testimony
[1:14:04] but will never have the same conviction
[1:14:06] that we'll have about telling our own
[1:14:09] testimony
[1:14:11] because we know what happened and you
[1:14:14] know when something happens in our own
[1:14:16] lives nobody can explain it like we can
[1:14:18] explain it nobody believes it like we
[1:14:21] believe it and you know when we get that
[1:14:23] experience that new birth that we talked
[1:14:24] about this morning when that happens in
[1:14:27] our lives
[1:14:28] we talk about it we show it our lives
[1:14:32] display it you cannot actually be
[1:14:35] converted and be the same person it's
[1:14:37] not possible
[1:14:38] you become a new creature in Christ
[1:14:40] Jesus is what the word says
[1:14:43] but here we have these people
[1:14:45] saying the same thing that they said in
[1:14:47] in verse 42 and they said is is not this
[1:14:50] Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and
[1:14:53] mother we know how is it then that he
[1:14:55] saith I came down from heaven
[1:14:58] brother Bradham says we've been to the
[1:15:01] stable this is what the people were
[1:15:02] saying we've been to the stable where he
[1:15:04] was born we've seen the Cradle he was
[1:15:05] rocked in we fished with him
[1:15:07] we're laying out here on the banks with
[1:15:09] him and this son of man Ascend up from
[1:15:12] whence he come
[1:15:15] he come from Bethlehem
[1:15:18] where's this coming up
[1:15:20] that's too much for us
[1:15:23] and they walked away from him
[1:15:26] and he never explained it
[1:15:28] brother branham's words he never
[1:15:30] explained it
[1:15:31] he didn't have to explain anything God
[1:15:34] don't have to explain nothing he says he
[1:15:38] is God he just does it because he
[1:15:40] promised it and he don't explain it
[1:15:44] alls we've got to do brothers and
[1:15:46] sisters is believe it
[1:15:49] we've got to be willing to take him at
[1:15:51] his word to eat his flesh
[1:15:53] and to drink his blood
[1:15:55] and you know some people it's too much
[1:15:59] some people have reservations they can't
[1:16:02] do it or they won't do it some people
[1:16:04] won't do communion foot washing but I I
[1:16:07] don't know I just would say why on Earth
[1:16:09] would we claim to believe if we don't
[1:16:11] follow the word if we don't follow the
[1:16:13] instructions to the word but it's no
[1:16:15] different than saying that I believe and
[1:16:17] not coming to church not having a home
[1:16:19] Church there's all these different
[1:16:20] things that we could get into and I
[1:16:21] don't want to tonight I just want to say
[1:16:24] this I am super humbled and thankful to
[1:16:27] be a part of a body of Believers that
[1:16:29] want to follow the word because you know
[1:16:32] it makes it easy to preach as I'm sure
[1:16:34] the brothers understand it's such an
[1:16:37] honor and a privilege to stand before
[1:16:39] the Justified bride of Jesus Christ
[1:16:43] to know that this is the group of people
[1:16:45] that he's called and you know brothers
[1:16:47] and sisters maybe he has more people in
[1:16:49] this city maybe he has no more people in
[1:16:51] the city it doesn't matter we're not
[1:16:52] into numbers we're not into quantity
[1:16:55] we're into quality we're into believing
[1:16:57] the word entirely when we do that
[1:17:00] anything is possible brothers and
[1:17:02] sisters
[1:17:04] I'm just gonna wrap it up there I don't
[1:17:07] want to keep us long tonight
[1:17:09] as I said I understand it can be real
[1:17:12] easy to make the services long
[1:17:15] and I really don't want to do that
[1:17:18] I
[1:17:20] I just want to give us time to get into
[1:17:22] the communion service so maybe we could
[1:17:24] change the order of the service now we
[1:17:26] could call the musicians if you could
[1:17:28] stand with me we'll turn over to
[1:17:30] actually First Corinthians it's not
[1:17:32] second I said second and that was
[1:17:34] completely wrong
[1:17:37] forgive me
[1:17:39] again I got a little excited
[1:17:42] I do that
[1:17:45] First Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:17:49] I think I said 12.
[1:17:52] my
[1:17:58] very familiar
[1:18:02] scripture
[1:18:05] verse start with verse 23.
[1:18:08] First Corinthians chapter 12.
[1:18:14] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:18:17] which also I delivered unto you
[1:18:20] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:18:23] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:18:27] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:18:30] and said take eat
[1:18:33] this is my body
[1:18:36] which is broken for you
[1:18:39] this do in remembrance of me
[1:18:42] after the same manner also he took the
[1:18:46] cup
[1:18:53] this do ye as often as he drink it in
[1:18:56] remembrance of me
[1:18:58] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:19:00] drink this cup
[1:19:01] you do
[1:19:03] shoe the Lord's death
[1:19:06] till he come
[1:19:08] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:19:10] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:19:12] unworthily
[1:19:13] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:19:16] the Lord
[1:19:18] but let a man examine himself
[1:19:21] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:19:25] drink of that cup
[1:19:27] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:19:29] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:19:32] to himself
[1:19:34] not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:19:38] for this cause
[1:19:39] many
[1:19:41] are weak and sickly among you and many
[1:19:44] sleep
[1:19:45] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:19:48] should not be judged
[1:19:49] but when we are judged we are chasten of
[1:19:52] the Lord
[1:19:53] that we should not be condemned with
[1:19:55] this world
[1:19:57] wherefore my brethren
[1:19:59] when ye come together to eat tarry one
[1:20:02] for another
[1:20:04] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:20:06] home
[1:20:07] that ye come not together unto
[1:20:09] condemnation
[1:20:11] and the rest will I set in order when I
[1:20:14] come
[1:20:16] let's just take a moment to Tarry
[1:20:19] if anybody has anything now's the time
