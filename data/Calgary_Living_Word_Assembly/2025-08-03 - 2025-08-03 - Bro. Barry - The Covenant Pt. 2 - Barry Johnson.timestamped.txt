[20:37] [Music]
[20:39] Um just read a few scriptures before we
[20:41] start here. Psalm 40:5 says, "Many, oh
[20:44] Lord, my God, are the wonderful works
[20:46] which thou has done, and thy thoughts
[20:49] which are to us word. They cannot be
[20:51] reckoned up in order unto thee. If I
[20:54] will declare and speak of them, they are
[20:56] more than can be numbered." Psalm 139:17
[21:00] to 18 says, "How precious also are thy
[21:02] thoughts unto me, oh God. How great is
[21:04] the sum of them. If I should count them,
[21:07] they are more in number than the sand.
[21:09] When I awake, I am still with thee.
[21:12] Lamentations 3:22-23 says, "It is of the
[21:14] Lord's mercies that we are not consumed
[21:18] because his compassions fail not, they
[21:21] are new every morning. Great is thy
[21:24] faithfulness." Amen. Please stand with
[21:26] me as we start the song service. If not
[21:28] for the grace of God and his mercies,
[21:30] his faithfulness, where would we be
[21:31] today?

[50:54] demand.

[54:22] ordinary
[54:23] things.
[54:25] Took a slave to tame the lion.
[54:30] Took a rock to make a stream.

[55:22] &gt;&gt; You're the God of all creation.
[55:26] You're the king above all kings.
[55:31] But only you would choose a rugged cross
[55:36] to rescue me.
[55:39] You're the healer of the broken.
[55:43] By faith I still believe.
[55:47] You took on my flesh. You conquered
[55:50] death. Lord, you are my victory.
[55:56] So I don't have to be the strongest.
[56:04] Cuz you are perfect in my weakness.
[56:12] You can move a mountain
[56:16] with faith like a grave mustard seed.
[56:23] I wonder what you could do with me.
[56:29] Open
[56:31] my eyes.
[56:33] [Music]
[56:37] Show me who I
[56:42] could be. Lord, help me. see
[56:49] that I I don't have to be the strongest.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; You are perfect in my weakness.
[57:05] Lord, if you can move a mountain
[57:09] with a like a grain of mustard seed,
[57:16] I wonder what you could do
[57:20] with me.
[57:22] [Music]

[57:36] [Music]
[57:39] with me.

[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:40] Jesus
[1:13:42] breaks
[1:13:45] every
[1:13:48] fatter.
[1:13:52] Jesus breaks
[1:13:56] every
[1:13:58] fetter
[1:14:00] for he sets me free and he sets
[1:14:06] me.
[1:14:08] Let's sing. I will shout hallelujah.
[1:14:10] Verse 5.
[1:14:12] And I will shout
[1:14:16] hallelujah.

[1:14:54] with me. And he walks
[1:14:58] with me.
[1:15:01] And he tells me I am his own.
[1:15:10] And the joy
[1:15:12] we share
[1:15:15] as we
[1:15:16] [Applause]
[1:15:29] come to the garden
[1:15:33] alone.
[1:15:38] Heat. Heat.
[1:15:48] Heat. Heat.
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:16:12] And he talks
[1:16:15] with me
[1:16:20] [Music]
[1:16:26] and the joy
[1:16:28] we share
[1:16:30] as we tear
[1:16:33] there
[1:16:35] none other
[1:16:38] has ever
[1:16:40] known. We'll go to verse two.
[1:16:45] He speaks and the sound of his voice he
[1:16:51] wants to speak today
[1:16:53] is so sweet.
[1:16:56] The birds hush their singing.
[1:17:03] And the bell
[1:17:07] that he gave
[1:17:09] to me
[1:17:12] within
[1:17:14] my heart
[1:17:17] is ringing.
[1:17:23] And he walks
[1:17:27] with me. And he talks.
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:51] Not neither
[1:17:54] has ever
[1:17:56] known. We'll do that third verse.
[1:18:01] I' stay
[1:18:03] in the garden with him.
[1:18:09] Though the night
[1:18:12] around me
[1:18:15] falls,
[1:18:19] but he b
[1:18:21] me go.
[1:18:23] Now the voice
[1:18:26] of wis
[1:18:30] to me
[1:18:33] is calling.
[1:18:37] Thank you Lord for calling.
[1:18:40] And he walks with me. And he talks
[1:18:47] with me.
[1:18:49] And he tells me I am his own.
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:19:00] we share
[1:19:02] as we tear
[1:19:05] there.
[1:19:07] None other
[1:19:10] has ever
[1:19:12] known.
[1:19:16] Hallelujah.
[1:19:18] Welcome to the house of the Lord this
[1:19:20] morning. If you have a need, may we just
[1:19:22] make it known unto him by way of an
[1:19:24] uplift hand.
[1:19:27] Just have a request here for Sister Mary
[1:19:30] Carpenter who had a fall. Just want to
[1:19:32] thank the Lord for healing her.
[1:19:36] Brother Jeff Paige has a cousin Bryce.
[1:19:39] He needs a touch from the Lord. He needs
[1:19:42] supernatural help. So we'll pray for him
[1:19:45] as well. Let's just bow. Gracious
[1:19:48] heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[1:19:51] we just are so thankful, Lord, that as
[1:19:54] we just sang, Lord, we don't sing that
[1:19:56] as a an old denominational hymn, Father,
[1:19:59] but we sing that by revelation through
[1:20:01] the lens of your word for our day, Lord,
[1:20:04] and recognize that you truly walk with
[1:20:06] us, Lord.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father. And you talk with us, Lord.
[1:20:11] What an honor and a privilege it is. as
[1:20:14] our brother prayed earlier. Oh, we could
[1:20:16] we could meet with kings and potentates
[1:20:19] and oh, we could meet with the most
[1:20:22] important people in this world. And what
[1:20:24] good would it do us, Lord? Father, it
[1:20:26] might puff up our pride, Lord Jesus. But
[1:20:29] we don't want pride. We know that your
[1:20:31] prophet said that true revelation
[1:20:33] doesn't puff men up. That it causes a
[1:20:37] real humility because we recognize that
[1:20:40] we're nothing outside of you. that
[1:20:42] outside of you and your baptism of your
[1:20:45] spirit, your life living through us,
[1:20:47] Lord. Father, we're lost as lost can be
[1:20:49] to know, Father, that you walk with us
[1:20:51] and you talk with us. Oh, Father, we're
[1:20:55] so thankful.
[1:20:57] Lord, we give you all the praise and all
[1:20:58] the glory this morning. You are so
[1:21:00] wonderful, Father. Lord Jesus, we thank
[1:21:04] you for the songs this morning. We thank
[1:21:06] you for each and every life represented
[1:21:08] here today, Lord. Father, we thank you
[1:21:10] for the needs that you've placed in our
[1:21:12] lives, Lord, because without the needs,
[1:21:15] there would be no way for us to
[1:21:17] recognize your attributes. And Father,
[1:21:20] this morning, we want to bring each need
[1:21:22] that was mentioned to you. Thank you for
[1:21:23] touching Sister Mary, Lord, for healing
[1:21:26] her, for raising her up, Lord. We thank
[1:21:28] you, Lord Jesus, that we can bring Bryce
[1:21:32] unto you, Father, unto your throne. the
[1:21:35] need that brother Jeff brought forward,
[1:21:37] Lord. Sometimes in our lives, there's
[1:21:40] only one way, Father. And we know that
[1:21:42] you will not let us go if we're yours.
[1:21:46] That you will walk with us and that you
[1:21:48] will talk with us.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; And you will tell us that we are yours.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we need to get flat on our
[1:21:55] backs just so we can look up. And
[1:21:57] Father, this morning we pray for Bryce,
[1:21:59] Lord, that your will would be done in
[1:22:01] his life. We pray there would be a
[1:22:03] testimony that brother Jeff could share
[1:22:05] through this situation.
[1:22:08] Father, we pray for each and every need
[1:22:09] that was made known unto you this
[1:22:11] morning, Father, by the way of an uplift
[1:22:13] hand. And Father, maybe just by a
[1:22:15] thought in a heart, Lord, we know that
[1:22:17] your word is quick and powerful and
[1:22:18] sharper than any two-edged sword.
[1:22:21] Father, dividing, oh Lord, the joints
[1:22:24] and the marrow, getting beyond this
[1:22:26] flesh, Lord Jesus, right down beyond our
[1:22:29] spirit, Lord, right to our very soul. We
[1:22:32] pray that you would discern each and
[1:22:33] every one of our hearts, Lord, this
[1:22:35] morning. That you would go from heart to
[1:22:37] heart, from seat to seat, Lord, and
[1:22:40] discern our hearts, Lord. Father, fill
[1:22:42] our cups where we need more of you. And
[1:22:44] father, we pray that you would just
[1:22:46] introduce yourself as you are the
[1:22:48] perfect gentleman to those who don't
[1:22:50] know you in the power of your
[1:22:51] resurrection. Father, we know that one
[1:22:53] way or another, we will not leave this
[1:22:55] building the same way that we came in.
[1:22:58] Oh, Father, we just love you and we
[1:23:00] thank you. We want to give you all the
[1:23:01] preeminence that you desire in this
[1:23:03] service. Lord, thank you for meeting the
[1:23:05] needs, Lord. Thank you that we can bring
[1:23:07] our needs unto you, Father. Where else
[1:23:09] would we go, Lord? We know that you
[1:23:12] asked your disciples one time when you
[1:23:14] told them to eat your flesh and drink
[1:23:16] your blood. You said, "Will you go
[1:23:17] also?" And we know that, oh, Father, by
[1:23:21] revelation, they said to you, "Unto whom
[1:23:24] would we go?" Father, we're so thankful
[1:23:26] that we could be here today. We just
[1:23:28] ask, Lord, that you would have the
[1:23:30] preeminence now in all that's said and
[1:23:32] done, in all that we think. Father, we
[1:23:34] just ask all these things in Jesus
[1:23:37] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you everyone. Musicians,
[1:23:46] my each and everyone, what a wonderful
[1:23:48] way to start the service.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you musicians. If you have your
[1:23:52] Bibles, I'd like to read a couple of
[1:23:54] scriptures today. First one in Matthew
[1:23:56] chapter 24. Kind of continuing on with
[1:24:01] maybe the signs of the times. We talked
[1:24:04] about a few services back in Matthew 24,
[1:24:07] the great tribulation.
[1:24:09] Jesus talking to his disciples
[1:24:13] and explaining to them what's actually
[1:24:15] going to take place. We just have three
[1:24:18] scriptures in this that I want to read
[1:24:20] and then we'll turn over to Genesis
[1:24:22] chapter 15 and Lord willing we'll
[1:24:25] continue on with our discussion from
[1:24:28] Wednesday about the covenant, God's
[1:24:30] unfailing covenant with his people.
[1:24:35] Matthew 24
[1:24:38] verse 10.
[1:24:40] Matthew 24
[1:24:43] verse 10.
[1:24:48] And then shall many be offended and
[1:24:52] shall betray one another and shall hate
[1:24:55] one another.
[1:24:57] And many false prophets shall rise and
[1:25:00] shall deceive many.
[1:25:03] And because iniquity shall abound,
[1:25:06] the love of many shall wax cold.
[1:25:11] But he that shall endure unto the end,
[1:25:14] the same shall be saved.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Let's turn over to Genesis.
[1:25:23] Genesis chapter 15, start with verse 8.
[1:25:42] Genesis chapter 15:8.
[1:25:47] It's the covenant that God made with
[1:25:49] Abram before he had his name change and
[1:25:52] his body changed.
[1:25:54] Verse
[1:25:56] 8 says, "And he said, Lord God,
[1:26:00] whereby shall I know that I shall
[1:26:04] inherit it?" And he said unto him,
[1:26:08] "Take me a heer of three years old, and
[1:26:11] a she goat of three years old, and a ram
[1:26:14] of three years old, and a turtle dove,
[1:26:16] and a young pigeon."
[1:26:19] And he took unto him all these, and
[1:26:21] divided them in the midst, and laid each
[1:26:24] piece, one against another, but the
[1:26:27] birds divided he not. And when the fowls
[1:26:31] came down upon the carcasses, Abram
[1:26:33] drove them away. And when the sun was
[1:26:36] going down, a deep sleep fell upon
[1:26:38] Abram, and lo, and horror of great
[1:26:42] darkness fell upon him. And he said unto
[1:26:46] Abram, "Know of assurityity that thy
[1:26:50] seed shall be a stranger in a land that
[1:26:53] is not theirs, and shall serve them,
[1:26:58] and they shall afflict them 400 years."
[1:27:03] Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[1:27:06] Father, Lord, we thank you for this
[1:27:07] word. We thank you, Lord Jesus, that we
[1:27:10] can see you in every single scripture
[1:27:14] from Genesis to Revelation. We thank
[1:27:17] you, Lord, for the revelation that we've
[1:27:19] been given through the eyes of your
[1:27:21] prophet. How you came and expounded to
[1:27:24] this age, Lord, tied up all the loose
[1:27:26] ends and gave us the complete revealing
[1:27:30] of all the mysteries.
[1:27:32] And we, Father, we just want to ask,
[1:27:35] Lord, that today you would be glorified
[1:27:37] in what we say and do now as we go
[1:27:38] forwards. We pray that you would just
[1:27:40] break this bread of life open to us
[1:27:43] fresh once again. Lord,
[1:27:46] just love you and we thank you. We ask
[1:27:47] all these things in Jesus Christ's name
[1:27:49] we pray. Amen.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be
[1:27:53] seated.
[1:27:57] Certainly want to welcome all of our
[1:27:59] visitors here.
[1:28:01] We have uh many visitors. We have a
[1:28:05] special weekend this weekend that we've
[1:28:07] been uh hosting at our house and our
[1:28:11] barn hall. We have the
[1:28:15] the singles, the young people that are
[1:28:18] singles, but they're actually young
[1:28:20] adults. But I'm not going to try and
[1:28:22] name names because I don't think I would
[1:28:24] be able to. We uh I'll leave leave
[1:28:27] someone out and uh maybe get something
[1:28:30] mixed up, but I just thought it was
[1:28:32] interesting to do a geographical
[1:28:34] comparison. We have people from
[1:28:36] Washington, we have people from Arizona,
[1:28:40] from Quebec, from Manitoba, from
[1:28:43] Saskatchewan, and and our province here,
[1:28:45] Alberta. There's a an interesting group
[1:28:48] of individuals. We've had a wonderful
[1:28:50] weekend so far, I believe, and uh it's
[1:28:53] not over.
[1:28:55] And I think it's amazing to see what the
[1:28:57] Lord, you know, will continue to do in
[1:28:59] our midst. Um, it's not a camp that we
[1:29:02] have for those people who are wondering.
[1:29:04] It's simply a get together of
[1:29:07] like-minded individuals, a place where
[1:29:09] they maybe will fit in. Sometimes we can
[1:29:12] come to a place where we're an adult and
[1:29:15] uh we're single, so we don't fit into a
[1:29:18] family camp. It just doesn't work.
[1:29:21] there's a lot of families and family
[1:29:22] activities and then there's the youth
[1:29:24] camps and you know sometimes there's
[1:29:27] just uh seemingly cracks where people
[1:29:30] don't seem to fit where they could fall
[1:29:32] into potentially and uh we just had a
[1:29:35] burden to create an environment where
[1:29:37] people could get together and have a bit
[1:29:39] of fellowship Christian fellowship
[1:29:42] one-on-one and uh as a group we've
[1:29:45] played some wonderful games it's been
[1:29:46] really fun actually so uh that's what's
[1:29:49] going on this weekend we're certainly
[1:29:50] Certainly honored to have the Trudeau's
[1:29:53] in our midst, Brother Jean Luke and
[1:29:56] Sister Cindy. God bless you. It's good
[1:29:57] to see you again. Uh more visitors from
[1:30:00] Quebec and uh yeah, we're certainly
[1:30:04] thankful to be in the presence of the
[1:30:05] Lord. I want to thank each one for the
[1:30:07] specials today. It certainly sets an
[1:30:10] atmosphere and uh you know, I I just
[1:30:12] can't get help but get in his presence.
[1:30:14] And sorry, I have to fix this here. Bear
[1:30:17] with me. Let me turn around. You can't
[1:30:19] see me doing this when I turn around.
[1:30:21] Right.
[1:30:23] I forgot to do that in the back. Wow.
[1:30:25] Okay, here we go. So, we're certainly
[1:30:28] thankful to be here and uh it's just a
[1:30:31] wonderful time to get together and get
[1:30:33] together in the presence of the Lord.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; And uh I'm certainly thankful. It's a
[1:30:37] long weekend. That was one of the
[1:30:39] requests we had if we do this uh singles
[1:30:41] weekend again that we could potentially
[1:30:43] do it on a long weekend so that people
[1:30:45] have the opportunity to travel a little
[1:30:46] better and uh maybe have a little less
[1:30:48] pressure. We can have another day. And
[1:30:51] so we tried to do that this year. And uh
[1:30:54] you know I was reminded by uh by by the
[1:30:57] deacons at the door today. It's a
[1:31:00] holiday weekend. Tomorrow's a holiday.
[1:31:03] So just take our time, not feel
[1:31:05] pressured. And uh I certainly feel that
[1:31:08] way. I know the Lord's here with us. We
[1:31:10] know that his word says where two or
[1:31:12] three are gathered in his name that he's
[1:31:13] there. Brothers and sisters, he's here.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; It's not a cliche. It's not a religious
[1:31:19] gathering. This is not a denominational
[1:31:22] event. This is a gathering with the King
[1:31:24] of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; And he is more more willing to meet our
[1:31:30] needs. A thousand times more willing to
[1:31:33] meet our needs than we are willing to
[1:31:35] accept. It is what the prophet said. And
[1:31:37] I can't help but think that that's what
[1:31:39] he said through the prophet.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; And I continually go to that because
[1:31:43] that's what a prophet is. A prophet is a
[1:31:45] mouthpiece. And and the mouthpiece is
[1:31:48] the microphone and the speaker of God.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; He uses men to speak and he always
[1:31:54] speaks through prophets. That is the
[1:31:55] plan of God. Way back to Mount Si when
[1:31:58] the people were afraid to go up on the
[1:32:01] mountain to go anywhere near the
[1:32:02] mountain. that was on fire at the top
[1:32:04] with smoke and thunder and lightning.
[1:32:07] And even Moses, the one he was calling
[1:32:09] to come up, you come up here. I want to
[1:32:12] talk to you. We know that he said he was
[1:32:14] exceedingly fearful
[1:32:17] and Yeah. So anyways,
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; That's the one that we're meeting with
[1:32:21] today. It's just wonderful to know that
[1:32:23] he's here in our midst
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; and there there ain't nothing he can't
[1:32:26] do
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; if we can believe.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; If we can believe. But you know,
[1:32:32] brothers and sisters, we uh were kind of
[1:32:34] talking about a little bit this weekend
[1:32:35] and I hope it's okay. I'm just going to
[1:32:37] preach today what's the Lord's kind of
[1:32:39] put on my heart and inspiration and you
[1:32:41] know, it's a bit of what we were talking
[1:32:43] about on Wednesday. We are willing
[1:32:45] recipients of his unconditional
[1:32:48] unconditional covenant that he gave to
[1:32:51] Abram way back here in the book of
[1:32:53] Genesis. We are the recipients of that.
[1:32:56] And the only thing that happens is we
[1:32:58] come to realize that. And you know, it's
[1:33:00] important to recognize how that happens.
[1:33:03] It's why we actually come to church is
[1:33:05] so that we can truly come to meet with
[1:33:08] Jesus Christ. We're not coming to a
[1:33:10] message church to get people to meet a
[1:33:13] prophet.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; That is not what we're doing. The
[1:33:16] prophet taught we need to get people to
[1:33:18] Jesus Christ.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; He even said, "I fear that we're only
[1:33:22] getting people to church and we're not
[1:33:24] getting people to Christ."
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. Today I'm going to preach
[1:33:28] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:33:30] and forever. And I trust that's what
[1:33:32] every minister in the message preaches.
[1:33:34] There's no deeper doctrine than Jesus
[1:33:36] Christ. The same yesterday, today, and
[1:33:38] forever. To take him right up out of the
[1:33:40] past and put him in the present. To take
[1:33:42] him out of the future somewhere and
[1:33:44] bring him right down to where we are
[1:33:46] today,
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; the great I am.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; And there ain't no need that we can have
[1:33:52] that we're encountering, that we're
[1:33:53] enduring, that we're going through in
[1:33:54] our life. There ain't nothing that he
[1:33:57] can't do for us.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; You know, I can't help but think, you
[1:34:03] know, we talked about it on Wednesday.
[1:34:04] We'll get into it a little bit. I'm
[1:34:05] probably going to say it a few times.
[1:34:07] Abraham, the Gentile, he was a Gentile
[1:34:10] when he was Abram.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; He was not a Jew. Don't think he was. He
[1:34:14] was a Gentile.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing to realize
[1:34:18] because he's come for the Gentiles. Now,
[1:34:20] this royal seed of Abraham is not the
[1:34:23] Jews. That's right.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; The royal seed of Abraham are Gentiles.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Gentiles sons and daughters that he's
[1:34:30] chosen to come collectively together to
[1:34:32] be one body, which is his bride body.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; And we're now living in that bride age.
[1:34:38] But here we have a man who was God's
[1:34:41] man, God's prophet back in the day. And
[1:34:43] the word of God says, we know in Romans
[1:34:46] that he staggered not at the promise of
[1:34:47] God through unbelief.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah, Lord.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; He was sounds like he was a perfect man.
[1:34:52] We said this on Wednesday. I'm just
[1:34:53] going to labor this a little bit. It
[1:34:55] sounds like he never staggered. He
[1:34:56] staggered.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; He was a backslider is what our prophet
[1:35:00] said.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Who would say tell the king that my my
[1:35:06] wife is my beautiful wife is my sister.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Because I want to save my hide because
[1:35:12] they might kill me and and take my wife.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; How backsliden can you get
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; to abandon your wife like that? Can you
[1:35:21] imagine the conversation they must have
[1:35:23] had afterwards?
[1:35:26] They lived in a supernatural world. They
[1:35:28] had supernatural experiences, but they
[1:35:30] also lived in a natural world where he
[1:35:32] staggered. And I guarantee you, this one
[1:35:34] was not a pushover. She probably had
[1:35:37] some words for him. But the word says
[1:35:40] that he staggered not at the promise of
[1:35:41] God through unbelief. Even though he
[1:35:43] staggered, he didn't have unbelief. What
[1:35:45] is unbelief? It's not stumbling and
[1:35:48] falling in our flesh clearly because
[1:35:49] that's what he did.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Unbelief is sin.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Unbelieving.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; You know, I think that God can do
[1:35:58] everything else in the message that
[1:36:00] we've been brought in the day in which
[1:36:01] we live except for this one thing in my
[1:36:03] life. I just can't get over it. I just
[1:36:05] can't change it. God doesn't seem to be
[1:36:07] moving in my life the way that I think
[1:36:08] that he should be in the time frame
[1:36:10] which it should be according to my mind.
[1:36:15] We don't want to be that way. God's
[1:36:17] going to take his his own time.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; God's time is perfect time. That's God's
[1:36:21] perfect will.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; His timing.
[1:36:25] Abram staggered not at the promise of
[1:36:27] God through unbelief. But what was he?
[1:36:29] He was strong in faith.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; And you know, I think that's probably
[1:36:34] the most important thing for us in the
[1:36:36] day in which we live, brothers and
[1:36:37] sisters. If we're going to be strong in
[1:36:38] anything, we better be strong in faith
[1:36:40] because this is the age where we need a
[1:36:42] certain type of faith. Anybody know what
[1:36:44] kind of faith we need for this age?
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; We need rapturing faith.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; This is the only age that we need
[1:36:50] rapturing faith for.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; And we know that faith lies on the
[1:36:54] tapes. But the tapes are only good
[1:36:56] enough as we eat them, as we consume
[1:36:59] them. We've got to be willing to listen
[1:37:01] to the tapes. We've got to be willing to
[1:37:03] say what the prophet said on those
[1:37:05] tapes. We've got to be willing to apply
[1:37:06] what the prophet said to do on those
[1:37:09] tapes in our lives
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; and not make excuses, not say, you know,
[1:37:13] I can do whatever maneuver. I can work
[1:37:15] my way. I got to work around. There's a
[1:37:17] loophole in the message. There ain't no
[1:37:19] loopholes in the word of God. There's no
[1:37:21] loopholes in the message of the hour.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; There's no contradictions.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; For those people that don't attend here,
[1:37:28] I'm just going to say it this way. I
[1:37:30] always preach this. Get the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Get him.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; The spirit of truth in your life
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; first
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; and foremost and everything else will
[1:37:42] become plain in God's time. It might not
[1:37:44] be thunderbolts of lightning all at
[1:37:47] once.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; And likely it won't be.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; God will say, "Okay, you're taking a
[1:37:53] step towards me now. The water's going
[1:37:56] to get contrary." Remember, he walked on
[1:37:58] the water out to the boat and the
[1:38:00] disciples were in it and it was pretty
[1:38:02] contrary. They were going to they were
[1:38:04] going to sink.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; But Peter, the one who was brave, what
[1:38:08] did he say? He was strong in faith,
[1:38:09] wasn't he?
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "Master, bid me come. Bid me
[1:38:13] come unto you." So what did he say?
[1:38:15] Come.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; And what happened? He had that faith for
[1:38:19] a brief second, for a split moment, he
[1:38:22] he stepped out on the water. Peter
[1:38:24] walked on the water, too.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; He stepped out of the boat. But we know
[1:38:28] that he started to look around. Oh no,
[1:38:29] the circumstance, the situation. Look at
[1:38:31] the waves. Look at the wind. Look at the
[1:38:32] water. How deep is this water? Ah.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; And he had to be saved. And what did
[1:38:38] Jesus say to him? My, if you just had
[1:38:41] more faith,
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; ye of little faith.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us not to be of little faith.
[1:38:48] We need to have a faith. Greater faith
[1:38:50] than any other age.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; That's the faith we need, brothers and
[1:38:53] sisters. And you know what's going to
[1:38:54] happen? I'll tell you. We're never going
[1:38:57] to live above our confession. is what
[1:39:00] God said to this age through his
[1:39:01] prophet.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; So if we say this ain't happening, God
[1:39:06] hasn't done this for me. I don't know if
[1:39:08] it's ever going to happen.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Who are we giving glory to?
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; We need to be saying praise God.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, how I don't even know
[1:39:17] how many times he he says it. We
[1:39:19] probably have an Orthodox message
[1:39:21] believer in our midst here. An al
[1:39:23] ultraorththodox message theologian.
[1:39:26] someone here that would know how many
[1:39:28] times brother Brandham said Abraham, he
[1:39:31] wasn't weak in faith, but what did he
[1:39:33] do? Every time he looked down and and
[1:39:35] thought all of these people were coming
[1:39:37] at him and saying, "You're a charlatan.
[1:39:38] God doesn't speak to you. You're going
[1:39:40] to have a baby. You're an old man. Look
[1:39:42] at your wife. She's an old woman. It
[1:39:44] ain't going to happen. You're crazy."
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; He never staggered.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; What did he do? Brother Bradom says he
[1:39:52] went home and got the booties ready.
[1:39:54] That's right.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; He made sure the bird eyee was there. He
[1:39:56] got the blankets. He got the the
[1:39:58] nursery. Everything was in order. Every
[1:40:01] time he started to hear that and feel
[1:40:02] that, what did he do? He acted on it in
[1:40:05] a greater way. He stepped into his
[1:40:07] confession.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, I just feel so
[1:40:12] impressed today. If we want to see God
[1:40:14] move in our lives, what are we doing
[1:40:15] about it? Are we grumbling about it, or
[1:40:17] are we giving God the glory and saying,
[1:40:19] "Hey, in my weakness, your strength is
[1:40:21] made perfect."
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:24] Therefore, I'll rejoice in my
[1:40:26] infirmities. In the position where I'm
[1:40:28] at, my station right now, I'm going to
[1:40:30] say, "Glory to God. You've got it all
[1:40:32] under control. I can't explain it or
[1:40:35] understand it, but I love you
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; because you first love me
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[1:40:43] God through unbelief, but was strong in
[1:40:47] faith."
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Giving glory to God. Amen.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; How many of us are strong in faith,
[1:40:54] giving glory to God when the devil's
[1:40:57] kicking us?
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; It ain't easy. I ain't saying it it's
[1:41:00] easy.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; What I'm saying is, brothers and
[1:41:03] sisters, when we're sick in our bodies,
[1:41:06] give God glory.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; When we have a fight in our marriage,
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; oh, what? Give God glory.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; It's the devil. Right?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Don't think for a second that God hasn't
[1:41:23] actually had a conversation about our
[1:41:25] situation.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "Have you considered
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; my brother Daniel?
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Have you considered my son?
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Have you considered him?" We got two
[1:41:35] Daniels sitting together. This is good.
[1:41:37] Have you considered him though?
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; I know that he won't shatter. He won't
[1:41:42] crumple.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in adoption,
[1:41:45] right?
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; You can take the tutor. Oh my. Goes to
[1:41:50] the father and explains, "You know what?
[1:41:51] I took him and I I I beat him up. I
[1:41:54] threw him down. I I put his wife against
[1:41:56] him. I got his pastor mad at him. All
[1:41:58] these different things happened and he
[1:42:00] still continues to praise you.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; He still continues to serve you."
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; What report is our tutor going to give
[1:42:07] to the father?
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; And we know the tutor is the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; That's what he says at adoption. We are
[1:42:14] adopted sons and daughters of God. Are
[1:42:16] we not? If we are, then I personally
[1:42:19] believe this myself, preaching to myself
[1:42:21] here, but as I look around, I see it
[1:42:23] also. I have to say it honestly,
[1:42:25] brothers and sisters, we're living a
[1:42:26] million times below our privilege.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; If we're adopted sons and daughters of
[1:42:31] God, what are we saying?
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it. We talked
[1:42:35] about it a week or so ago. Say nice
[1:42:37] things.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; You know, out of the abundance of the
[1:42:40] heart, the mouth speaketh,
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:43] If we want to see devils killed, if we
[1:42:46] want to see victory over devils, say
[1:42:47] nice things.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; If we're not saying nice things, what's
[1:42:51] happening is we're giving devils room to
[1:42:53] move.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Who wants to give the devil a day off?
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Who wants to give Satan a free pass?
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go home and smack talk the
[1:43:03] deacons. They didn't shake my hand.
[1:43:07] that song leader, that pastor, that
[1:43:09] preacher, this, that, the other,
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; blah, blah, blah. All we're doing is
[1:43:14] glorifying Satan.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; I think we need to have a testimony like
[1:43:19] Abraham.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Don't you?
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Abraham's testimony.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Where we stagger not at the promise of
[1:43:27] God through. No, no, no, no, no. We'll
[1:43:29] stagger at the promise of our brother
[1:43:30] maybe, and our sister, but we'll still
[1:43:32] give God the glory. We'll still say, you
[1:43:33] know what? Maybe they didn't mean to say
[1:43:35] that, but I love them anyways. They're
[1:43:36] my brother. They're my sister.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; That's my pastor. That's my song leader.
[1:43:40] Whatever it is, we'll say, "Praise God.
[1:43:43] Give him glory
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; and rejoice in our trials." I just love
[1:43:47] how he goes on to say this in Romans. He
[1:43:49] says, "And being fully persuaded that
[1:43:51] what he had promised, are we fully
[1:43:54] persuaded in our day, brothers and
[1:43:56] sisters, that what he promised in our
[1:43:57] lives,
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; he's able to."
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Are we fully persuaded?
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we are.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; I I just think I want to encourage us
[1:44:08] today, brothers and sisters. If you
[1:44:10] leave here today, don't think that
[1:44:11] Brother Barry gave you a spanking. Just
[1:44:14] think that Brother Barry wants to
[1:44:15] encourage us to be fully persuaded in
[1:44:18] this word for our day.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; We're not gathering to get together
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; to to to magnify cuttingly devised
[1:44:27] fables
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; of a prophet.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; We're here to get to Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; That's why that prophet came here.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Was to get people to Christ.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; So that we could be fully adopted sons
[1:44:41] and daughters of God, knowing our
[1:44:42] position in Christ Jesus, seated already
[1:44:46] in heavenly places.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brad, we read it on Wednesday.
[1:44:49] He says that you're not going to. You
[1:44:51] already are.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; If you're a son and daughter, you
[1:44:54] already are.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Jerry. I hope
[1:44:58] you're ready for that three-hour sermon
[1:44:59] today.
[1:45:01] I feel like it, brother.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; He always bugs me for a three-hour
[1:45:06] sermon. So, hold on, everyone.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; We've got water downstairs. We could
[1:45:10] turn the AC up a little bit. But Abraham
[1:45:14] was being fully persuaded that what he
[1:45:17] had promised, he was able also to
[1:45:19] perform.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; And I just want to encourage us,
[1:45:23] brothers and sisters, be fully
[1:45:24] persuaded. be fully persuaded that what
[1:45:27] he has promised you, he is also able to
[1:45:30] perform it.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Whatever that need is.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; I can't help but think that, you know,
[1:45:41] what what should be the most difficult
[1:45:42] thing seems to be the easiest and and
[1:45:45] what likely should be the easiest seems
[1:45:48] to be like the most difficult.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Did you ever notice that?
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The most difficult thing if
[1:45:54] you think about it, and I'm just going
[1:45:56] to say it this way, but I I fully
[1:45:58] believe it. I know we all do. If there
[1:46:00] is a life thereafter,
[1:46:04] isn't it the most difficult thing to
[1:46:05] believe that you're actually going to
[1:46:07] have salvation, that we have salvation,
[1:46:09] that God is going to catch us when we
[1:46:11] step from one dimension into the next,
[1:46:13] that death is just a buggy that's going
[1:46:14] to take us into the presence of God?
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; The thing that's the most difficult
[1:46:20] seems to be the most easy. If we were to
[1:46:22] say, "How many people are here saved
[1:46:24] today?" Just raise your hand. And I
[1:46:25] would imagine every single hand in the
[1:46:27] room would go up. But how many people
[1:46:30] are fully persuaded that God's going to
[1:46:31] deal with that thing in your life?
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; As many hands going to go up,
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; are we fully persuaded that he is able?
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; I want to try and persuade us, brothers
[1:46:44] and sisters, that he is more than able.
[1:46:46] Hallelujah.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; There ain't no need in our midst ever
[1:46:49] from birth unto death that he is not
[1:46:52] able to deliver us from or take us
[1:46:54] through.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Every single need.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Every single problem. The only reason we
[1:46:59] have needs and problems is so that he
[1:47:01] can express himself to us.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; And not just to us, but through us, to
[1:47:05] our brothers and our sisters.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; I've learned something a little bit just
[1:47:09] in my tiny tenure as a pastor. When you
[1:47:12] see God move in someone's life, when
[1:47:14] they take what's being preached and it
[1:47:16] applies to them in their life and they
[1:47:18] take it and they just step by faith and
[1:47:21] God does something for them and there's
[1:47:23] a testimony in a testimony service about
[1:47:26] what God has done for them, it does
[1:47:28] something supernatural for that guy
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; to say, "Praise the Lord. Something is
[1:47:32] happening. This is this is this is the
[1:47:35] Lord moving. It's just incredible." But
[1:47:37] it's not just for us is my point,
[1:47:38] brothers and sisters. It's for the body,
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; for our brothers and our sisters.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Think about that. That women, those two
[1:47:45] women. I just can't help but think about
[1:47:47] that. Brother Bradom prayed for and
[1:47:48] nothing really happened. They were
[1:47:49] prayed for the prayer line. He said to
[1:47:51] them, "Go on, receive your healing in
[1:47:53] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." One
[1:47:55] of them had a goiter. The other one
[1:47:56] couldn't stomach food. And what
[1:47:58] happened?
[1:48:00] Days went by. I think it was even weeks
[1:48:02] that went by after the services. They're
[1:48:05] there in their neighborhoods
[1:48:07] and the one woman is making a bed and
[1:48:10] she notices that that goer was gone.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; And what'd she do? She jumped up and
[1:48:15] started shaking the sheets. Where did
[1:48:17] the Where did it go? Where did it go?
[1:48:19] It's just gone.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; The other woman, she just sends the kids
[1:48:24] off to school. The husband's gone. Now
[1:48:26] she's going to care for the house and do
[1:48:28] her her job, whatever it is that she's
[1:48:30] doing. and and she sees some leftover
[1:48:32] food there from breakfast and she's
[1:48:34] like, "My something something's
[1:48:36] stimulating me. I I just feel like
[1:48:38] eating that." And what'd she do? She ate
[1:48:40] that. She could normally not eat
[1:48:41] anything because she would just get
[1:48:43] sick. And what happened? She ate more.
[1:48:45] And she ate more. And it wasn't very
[1:48:47] long before both these women went out
[1:48:49] screaming and yelling because God did
[1:48:51] something for them in their lives.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Just beautiful. Brother Adams said the
[1:48:58] angel of the Lord went through their
[1:49:00] area on a specific day.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; I just want to say this, brothers and
[1:49:05] sisters, be fully persuaded and invite
[1:49:07] that angel of the Lord to come by your
[1:49:09] way.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And I promise you, he will come by.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; He won't come the way we think.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; He won't come when we think he should.
[1:49:17] But just give him the opportunity to
[1:49:19] come is what I want to say.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:49:26] I just think it's beautiful. It's
[1:49:28] amazing to see how the law Lord actually
[1:49:31] moves in our midst. You know, there's uh
[1:49:34] I just wanted to mention this. I I
[1:49:36] haven't even start
[1:49:38] haven't even started yet today. I think
[1:49:40] it's beautiful. The Lord is so good,
[1:49:42] isn't he? Amen.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; I just wanted to mention this uh for our
[1:49:45] local assembly that uh we do have youth
[1:49:48] services coming up to begin um September
[1:49:52] 26th at 7:30 p.m. here in the sanctuary.
[1:49:55] And I I have to mention this. I know
[1:49:57] some people might be saying, "Brother
[1:49:59] Barry, now you're breaking the spirit."
[1:50:01] I'm not breaking the spirit. He hasn't
[1:50:03] left, has he?
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; He's still here.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure that I mention this.
[1:50:09] And uh sometimes when you get up here,
[1:50:10] you just get a little bit nervous. Get
[1:50:12] in the presence of God and it's very
[1:50:14] difficult to just function as a normal
[1:50:16] human being, brothers and sisters. It's
[1:50:17] just it's the way it is. But uh I I tend
[1:50:20] to get a little bit nervous sometimes. I
[1:50:22] get a little emotional. But I wanted to
[1:50:24] mention this one point. We're going to
[1:50:26] have youth services. We've talked about
[1:50:27] it. They're going to start September the
[1:50:29] 26th, 7:30 p.m. here in the sanctuary.
[1:50:32] And remember, it's open to all ages. If
[1:50:34] you want to come, that's fine. You're
[1:50:35] welcome to come.
[1:50:38] and uh even the young ones, you're
[1:50:40] welcome to come, but the only
[1:50:42] restriction is you have to be able to
[1:50:44] govern yourself. There's not going to be
[1:50:46] babysitters here. If the children can't
[1:50:49] come and sit still and have a real
[1:50:51] service, then maybe we just need to wait
[1:50:53] at home until we're just a little more
[1:50:54] mature so we can actually do that. We
[1:50:56] want to give everyone the opportunity.
[1:50:58] If you're an adult and you want to come,
[1:50:59] you're all welcome to come. It's going
[1:51:02] to be the last Friday of every month.
[1:51:04] We're going to start doing this. And uh
[1:51:06] as I mentioned, it's open to all ages.
[1:51:08] And uh I just in my note, I wrote this.
[1:51:11] You must be old enough to be reverent.
[1:51:13] And uh we'll certainly see what the Lord
[1:51:15] is going to do. What we're doing is it's
[1:51:17] going to be a youth service here in the
[1:51:19] sanctuary. And uh I I want to see that
[1:51:23] we're going to be ushering. We're going
[1:51:25] to be doing music. And we're even going
[1:51:27] to be preaching. The youth are going to
[1:51:30] be doing all of those. The parents, the
[1:51:32] deacons, the trustees, the pastor. We're
[1:51:35] not going to be doing that. I'm probably
[1:51:36] going to be encouraging a little bit.
[1:51:38] But I'll tell you, there's youth in our
[1:51:41] midst that really have a desire to
[1:51:43] preach. They've even got notes compiled.
[1:51:47] There's others that have songs to sing.
[1:51:49] Others have songs to play. And uh I'll
[1:51:52] tell you, my heart's desire with this is
[1:51:54] to encourage the youth to participate in
[1:51:57] the church. And I know that we always
[1:52:00] have the same musicians coming up and
[1:52:02] playing, but wouldn't it be wonderful if
[1:52:04] one of the musicians were able to just
[1:52:06] sub off once in a while and allow oh my
[1:52:09] a youth to go and play in the midst of a
[1:52:12] real service? How are they ever going to
[1:52:14] get the experience to do it if we don't
[1:52:16] actually give them an environment to
[1:52:18] grow and learn? So that's that's that's
[1:52:20] the driving force behind this. uh if the
[1:52:23] Lord should terry, which he could, we
[1:52:27] don't know how long it's going to be. We
[1:52:29] know there's people saying back in the
[1:52:30] 70s,
[1:52:33] you know, his coming it's near. We're
[1:52:35] not going to be able to even pay our
[1:52:37] mortgage off. We're not even going to be
[1:52:39] able to deal with our cars. Even back in
[1:52:41] the day when brother Brandham was
[1:52:42] around, we know these spirits are always
[1:52:44] around.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; But no man knows a day or the hour.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet told us we need to hoe our
[1:52:50] potatoes like he's coming a hundred
[1:52:51] years from now. Exactly.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; So, we need to make sure that we are
[1:52:54] positioning the church body for future
[1:52:57] days
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; and that the youth have a place in the
[1:53:01] church. So, we certainly want to give
[1:53:03] them the opportunity for that. And I
[1:53:05] apologize for stopping the preaching to
[1:53:07] do that. I just had to make sure that I
[1:53:10] announced it. I want to make sure we got
[1:53:11] enough time for that. So uh I just think
[1:53:14] it's beautiful uh to see the
[1:53:15] encouragement in in the youth and to see
[1:53:18] the the desire in their heart to
[1:53:20] actually participate in the services.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; So pray for us and uh pray for them. I'm
[1:53:27] sure the Lord will use them mightily.
[1:53:30] Okay. So speaking about our weekend a
[1:53:34] little bit too. I wanted to do this. It
[1:53:36] uh all kind of ties together. So just
[1:53:38] bear with me. I know you are and I thank
[1:53:40] you for it. the singles weekend that
[1:53:42] we've been doing is uh you know just try
[1:53:45] and encourage call out the youth, the
[1:53:48] young adults, those individuals that
[1:53:50] aren't married yet and uh just need a
[1:53:52] need an opportunity to fellowship. It's
[1:53:54] important to have fellowship with
[1:53:56] like-minded brothers and sisters,
[1:53:58] brothers and sisters of like precious
[1:53:59] faith. And you know, I would say this,
[1:54:01] if if we're going to do anything, there
[1:54:03] needs to be a scriptural basis for it.
[1:54:05] It needs to point back to the scripture.
[1:54:07] And I think it's just amazing because
[1:54:09] when we did it last year, this is the
[1:54:10] scripture that came to my heart. It's
[1:54:12] Isaiah 40:31.
[1:54:14] But they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:54:16] renew their strength. They shall mount
[1:54:18] up with wings as eagles. They shall run
[1:54:20] and not be weary. They shall walk and
[1:54:23] not faint. And we know that's a song
[1:54:25] that we sing, but I just think it's
[1:54:27] amazing to see the the individuals not
[1:54:30] giving themselves over to shortcuts to
[1:54:33] try and find spouses, not giving
[1:54:35] themselves over to situations that could
[1:54:38] lead them into what brother Brandham
[1:54:40] called hell on earth. By getting matched
[1:54:42] up with people that don't have like
[1:54:44] precious faith by holding your
[1:54:46] testimony, by waiting on the Lord, the
[1:54:49] Lord is what will renew our strength.
[1:54:52] And we know they'll mount up with wings
[1:54:53] as eagles. They shall. So I I just had
[1:54:56] that scripture last year. And I believe
[1:54:58] that's the overarching scripture for the
[1:55:00] entire thought, the entire idea is for
[1:55:03] the individuals to get together and
[1:55:06] understand that there's just an
[1:55:08] opportunity for fellowship. We're not
[1:55:10] matchmakers. We're not interested in
[1:55:12] that. We want God to do that. And you
[1:55:13] know, I I would say to anyone and to
[1:55:15] everyone, get the Holy Ghost. If you're
[1:55:18] getting together with anyone, you don't
[1:55:19] got the Holy Ghost, you are in dangerous
[1:55:21] waters. You are in very dangerous
[1:55:23] waters. Brother Random said it becomes
[1:55:24] hell on earth because you have different
[1:55:27] cultures that blend. You have different
[1:55:28] lives that come together. You've got to
[1:55:31] be on the same page. You know, well,
[1:55:32] some some things are simple. How do you
[1:55:34] how do you discipline children? Do you
[1:55:36] discipline children? Or do you have a
[1:55:37] psychology degree and say, "No, no, no,
[1:55:39] no, no, no. We just need to say, you
[1:55:40] know, junior, just don't do that. That's
[1:55:42] okay. Just take a breath. It'll be okay.
[1:55:45] We don't we don't use the rod anymore
[1:55:46] because we've got psychology." That's
[1:55:48] contrary to the word. And when you got
[1:55:50] one believer that wants to actually
[1:55:52] apply the word and you got somebody else
[1:55:54] that's married to them who claims to be
[1:55:56] a believer but doesn't want to apply the
[1:55:58] word the way the word says to apply it,
[1:56:00] you have a big problem in a marriage.
[1:56:03] And what's worse is you have children
[1:56:05] confused.
[1:56:06] The confusion of the children, man.
[1:56:08] That's why you got to get the Holy
[1:56:10] Ghost. Some people say it's weak to even
[1:56:12] preach that. But you know what? There's
[1:56:14] nothing else to preach in the day in
[1:56:15] which we live, brothers and sisters.
[1:56:17] That's what the message came for, was to
[1:56:19] restore people back to what was lost.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; The faith of the Pentecostal fathers is
[1:56:24] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:56:26] fell on the day of Pentecost.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Good word.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, we're lost as
[1:56:33] lost can be. That's an exact quote.
[1:56:34] That's what brother Brandham says.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Lost as lost can be. We can have all the
[1:56:38] church form. We can have all the message
[1:56:40] we want. We can know all the quotes and
[1:56:42] have been to all the places. What good
[1:56:44] is it
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; if we don't love our brother? What good
[1:56:47] is it if we don't have the Holy Ghost?
[1:56:49] And I'll tell you this, if you don't
[1:56:50] love your brother, you don't have the
[1:56:52] Holy Ghost.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; You don't love your sister, you don't
[1:56:56] have the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; You don't love your spouse, you ain't
[1:56:59] got the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost is love.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is charity. That's
[1:57:05] overarching to the entire
[1:57:08] the entire portion about spouses.
[1:57:12] This year's scripture for the uh for the
[1:57:14] singles I took Ephesians 6 and I'm not
[1:57:17] going to go too far into it. Finally, my
[1:57:18] brethren, be strong in the Lord and in
[1:57:20] the power of his might, not in our
[1:57:23] might. Put on the whole armor of God. We
[1:57:26] went through this as well. And uh you
[1:57:28] know, we started the weekend for those
[1:57:30] people who are wondering, those people
[1:57:31] might wonder about the future. We start
[1:57:33] the weekend with a scripture and and we
[1:57:35] go through and and we do a little bit of
[1:57:37] a theme. I do a little bit of an
[1:57:39] exhortation for the weekend and that's
[1:57:41] it. We don't have services all weekend
[1:57:43] long. And I I know some people have
[1:57:45] said, "Oh my, there's no way that I
[1:57:46] could ever go to that because that's not
[1:57:49] that's not spiritual enough for me." And
[1:57:51] and it just kind of made me sad to think
[1:57:53] that, you know, we live in a natural
[1:57:55] world here, brothers and sisters. We're
[1:57:56] not living in a world where we're
[1:57:58] actually,
[1:58:00] we've heard it said many times, we can
[1:58:02] be so spiritually minded that he so
[1:58:04] heavenly minded, we're no earthly good.
[1:58:07] And who would want to be that way? You
[1:58:09] know, when children see that, it turns
[1:58:11] children out to the world.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Ultra orthodox message people,
[1:58:17] everything is spiritual. We've said this
[1:58:19] before. You can't even go and buy a a
[1:58:21] cucumber without having a prayer
[1:58:24] meeting.
[1:58:26] We need to be able to live in this world
[1:58:28] and we need to be able to take steps and
[1:58:29] understand that God is in control. We're
[1:58:31] not. God is in control. And we've
[1:58:33] already died out to ourselves that
[1:58:35] morning. So why do we need to, you know,
[1:58:37] you know what I'm saying?
[1:58:39] We're dealing with adults and we want to
[1:58:41] encourage them to actually just continue
[1:58:44] to be strong in the Lord and in the
[1:58:46] power of his might,
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; not in our own.
[1:58:50] We've got uh another thing I wanted to
[1:58:52] mention here too. And I'm going to get
[1:58:53] into preaching. I hope it's okay if we
[1:58:54] just take a little bit of time today.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Some people might be getting a little
[1:58:58] bit anxious and I'm sorry, but it is a
[1:59:00] long weekend after all. And what else do
[1:59:03] we have to do? We don't have two
[1:59:04] services today.
[1:59:06] If anybody I guess has uh has a meal on
[1:59:09] the go, I'm I'm sorry. But uh you know,
[1:59:12] we have one more thing coming on. I'm
[1:59:13] just going to mention this and then
[1:59:14] we'll get really going here. We have
[1:59:15] questions and answers. We've been
[1:59:17] mentioning that uh we want people to
[1:59:19] write down their questions and we'll
[1:59:21] come up with answers and uh put them in
[1:59:23] the offering box or put them in the
[1:59:25] offering bag when it goes by and we will
[1:59:27] compile them and answer them. It was
[1:59:30] mentioned when brother Emanuel was uh
[1:59:32] taking the service for me in my absence
[1:59:34] and he said he wasn't sure what was in
[1:59:36] my mind and that's what's in my mind. We
[1:59:38] just want to compile a few and then
[1:59:39] we'll actually take some time and have a
[1:59:41] service and answer them by the grace of
[1:59:43] God. We will endeavor to answer them by
[1:59:46] the word.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; I'm certainly uh excited about it too
[1:59:50] because we're seeing them come in now.
[1:59:51] And brother Brandham says that questions
[1:59:53] from the people actually indicate what's
[1:59:55] in the heart.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Of the body. So there's real questions.
[2:00:00] There has to be real answers. And as a
[2:00:02] body, we want to find them together.
[2:00:03] We're a family. We want to be able to
[2:00:05] stay together and find these answers
[2:00:07] according to the word of God.
[2:00:10] Okay. Matthew chapter 24. Getting into
[2:00:13] it. And I I'll try not to keep us too
[2:00:15] late for the record. I'm not going to go
[2:00:16] three hours. So don't, as brother Cadre
[2:00:19] says, don't get nervous. I won't go
[2:00:21] three hours. But uh in in Matthew
[2:00:25] chapter 24 verse 10,
[2:00:30] and then shall many be offended and
[2:00:31] shall betray one another and shall hate
[2:00:33] one another. And many false prophets
[2:00:36] shall rise and deceive many. And I just
[2:00:39] want to throw this in there. I think
[2:00:41] it's important. You know, the word
[2:00:42] prophet in the Bible, Brother Brandham
[2:00:44] says is preacher.
[2:00:47] So don't worry about seeing a prophet,
[2:00:48] someone coming up and saying that
[2:00:50] they're prophetic. And we see it all
[2:00:51] over the place even now. And through the
[2:00:54] decades they've risen up and they still
[2:00:56] will continue to. But I don't think that
[2:00:58] we need to worry so much about them
[2:01:00] because you can usually see that there's
[2:01:02] some real promotion and real stuff going
[2:01:05] on that's just funny. But it says in
[2:01:08] here to beware, right? Many shall be
[2:01:12] offended and shall betray one another
[2:01:15] and shall hate one another. and many
[2:01:17] false prophets shall rise and deceive
[2:01:21] many.
[2:01:23] And because iniquity shall abound, the
[2:01:26] love of many shall wax cold,
[2:01:30] but he that shall endure unto the end,
[2:01:32] the same shall be saved.
[2:01:35] Talking about this here, I think these
[2:01:37] two are kind of linked together. And I I
[2:01:39] think it's beautiful when we look at
[2:01:40] this how Jesus mentioned this, how he
[2:01:43] said this to his disciples that you'll
[2:01:46] be hated of all nations for my name's
[2:01:48] sake. But you know, many shall be
[2:01:50] offended and shall betray one another
[2:01:53] and shall hate one another. That's where
[2:01:55] I'm saying if you've got hate, it's not
[2:01:58] of the Lord.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Hate is of the devil.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Hate is Cain's nature. It's the nature
[2:02:06] of Cain right from the very beginning.
[2:02:08] If we have any hatred in our lives, we
[2:02:11] need to actually go and have a prayer
[2:02:13] meeting. That's where we need to die out
[2:02:15] to ourselves.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; And many false prophets shall rise and
[2:02:19] deceive many. And and that's where I
[2:02:22] just want to say, you know, many false
[2:02:24] preachers will rise and shall deceive
[2:02:28] many. And don't don't get me wrong.
[2:02:30] We're not actually adding to or take
[2:02:32] away from the word. We don't want to do
[2:02:33] that. We just want to try and illustrate
[2:02:35] a little bit just so we can get a
[2:02:37] perspective on it. You know, out of the
[2:02:39] Amplified Bible, these verses say, "And
[2:02:42] then many will be offended and repelled
[2:02:46] and begin to distrust
[2:02:49] and desert
[2:02:51] him whom they ought to trust and obey."
[2:02:55] And you know, brothers and sisters, who
[2:02:57] is that him?
[2:02:59] It ain't the pastor. Even though it is,
[2:03:03] it ain't the teacher. Even though it is,
[2:03:06] what it comes down to is God.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; They're not trusting God because of
[2:03:12] these guys. But how will you know if
[2:03:15] these guys are not right? How will you
[2:03:17] know if there is a situation? The only
[2:03:19] way that you'll know is to know the word
[2:03:22] yourself.
[2:03:23] If you know the word yourself, then you
[2:03:26] won't have to be worried and have
[2:03:28] distrust or worry about deserting him
[2:03:31] whom they ought to trust and obey and
[2:03:33] will stumble and fall away and be betray
[2:03:37] one another and pursue one another with
[2:03:40] hatred.
[2:03:42] Now, we can say in this day and age,
[2:03:44] we've actually witnessed this.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; We've witnessed this. There's believers
[2:03:50] who actually went from believing to
[2:03:53] unbelieving, but they still claim Jesus
[2:03:56] Christ just like everyone else in the
[2:03:58] denominational world. They still claim
[2:03:59] the blood. They still claim the new
[2:04:02] birth, but they full-on reject that God
[2:04:05] sent a prophet. He sent a prophetic
[2:04:07] utterance through a Kentucky hillbilly
[2:04:10] to this generation.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; They want to have a denominational
[2:04:14] teaching. And we know that the word of
[2:04:16] God says that as a hog to a waller,
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; a dog right back to his vomit, the same
[2:04:23] thing that they came out of, they're
[2:04:24] going right back into.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Why is it? I'll say this. Because
[2:04:30] they're afraid to wait on the Lord.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; They're just afraid to wait on the Lord.
[2:04:36] Carrying on, it says, "And many false
[2:04:38] prophets will rise up and deceive and
[2:04:41] lead many into error. and the love of
[2:04:46] the great body of people. I love how it
[2:04:49] amplifies it here. It's not the love of
[2:04:51] many in the world, how they're just
[2:04:53] getting divorced and the unbelievers.
[2:04:55] This is ain't about unbelievers. We're
[2:04:57] talking about the church of the living
[2:04:58] God. We're talking about
[2:05:00] messagebelieving churches, sovereign
[2:05:03] bodies of the word. The love of the
[2:05:05] great body of people will grow cold
[2:05:08] because of the multiplied lawlessness
[2:05:11] and iniquity.
[2:05:14] What is iniquity? Iniquity is not doing
[2:05:16] what we know we're supposed to do
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; and doing what we know we're not
[2:05:21] supposed to do.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this, brothers and
[2:05:24] sisters. I'm not just preaching to you.
[2:05:26] I'm preaching to me.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; I know when I shouldn't be doing
[2:05:30] something and sometimes I still do it.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; It's Romans chapter 7. But you know, as
[2:05:36] we go forwards and we stagger, not at
[2:05:38] the promise of God through unbelief,
[2:05:40] even though we stagger, let's not
[2:05:41] stagger at that promise of God through
[2:05:43] unbelief, but let's be strong
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; in our faith.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; And our confession
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; and believe that he will be able to
[2:05:51] deliver us. He who endures to the end
[2:05:54] will be saved.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; This is a marathon we're running. We're
[2:05:57] not running a a sprinting race. This is
[2:06:00] a marathon. You got to be careful. You
[2:06:02] need to make sure that you're you're
[2:06:04] pacing yourself correctly, that you're
[2:06:06] you're you're looking to the end. You're
[2:06:08] not just looking to tomorrow and the
[2:06:10] next day and the next week. This is a a
[2:06:13] marathon,
[2:06:15] you know, just the word prophets out of
[2:06:16] the out of the concordance.
[2:06:20] Uh a superior prophet says, i.e.
[2:06:22] pretended for teller or religious
[2:06:25] impostor.
[2:06:27] A religious impostor. Can you believe
[2:06:29] that? A false prophet. That's what the
[2:06:31] false prophet is. And and I think it's
[2:06:34] just a an amazing thing because we can
[2:06:36] we can look around and we can say that
[2:06:38] we've actually witnessed it. We've seen
[2:06:40] it. And uh you know, we pray for those
[2:06:42] people. We don't want to condemn them.
[2:06:45] We don't we don't want to judge anybody
[2:06:47] that we don't be judged ourselves. But
[2:06:50] you know, this morning I want to talk
[2:06:52] about not so much in in Matthew chapter
[2:06:55] 24. I I just want to say that there's a
[2:06:58] reason why all of this shall happen.
[2:07:01] Many shall be offended and shall betray
[2:07:03] one another and shall hate one another.
[2:07:05] And you know what? Whether you hate
[2:07:06] someone a little bit or hate someone a
[2:07:07] lot, guess what?
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; You still hate them,
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:07:12] There's still that thing there. That
[2:07:14] hatred is still there. And and I I'm
[2:07:17] talking from experience, brothers and
[2:07:19] sisters. We can think that we're we're
[2:07:21] all good, but we still have this thing
[2:07:22] that keeps coming up about that person.
[2:07:24] That thing that just keeps coming up
[2:07:25] about that person. You have to say,
[2:07:27] "Lord, deliver me from this flesh."
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Turn over the page. Go from Romans
[2:07:31] chapter 7 over to Romans chapter 8.
[2:07:34] Right? Knowing that this flesh is
[2:07:37] corrupt. This flesh will not inherit
[2:07:39] incorruption.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Heading over to our covenant
[2:07:45] with Abraham. I think I just want to
[2:07:48] dwell here for a little bit. This is
[2:07:49] God's covenant with Abraham and it was
[2:07:52] for a generation.
[2:07:55] We know that if you just go back in in
[2:07:57] in Genesis 15
[2:08:01] verse 5,
[2:08:03] God brought him forth. It says, "And he
[2:08:05] brought him forth abroad and said, look
[2:08:08] now toward heaven and tell the stars if
[2:08:13] thou be able to number them." And he
[2:08:15] said unto him, "So shall thy seed be."
[2:08:20] There's no way that there would be that
[2:08:21] many people in in in the in the nation
[2:08:25] of Israel. So, it has to be it has to be
[2:08:29] another group of people. I think it's
[2:08:32] just amazing to look at this, but that's
[2:08:34] how much seed there would be. And verse
[2:08:37] six says, "And he believed in the Lord,
[2:08:41] and he counted it to him for
[2:08:43] righteousness."
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Now, brothers and sisters, we have got
[2:08:47] to believe in the Lord for him to count
[2:08:50] it to us for righteousness.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; If we say we believe the Lord with our
[2:08:54] lips, but excuse me, we're very far away
[2:08:58] in our hearts. Do we believe the Lord?
[2:09:01] We've got to take this heart and cause
[2:09:04] it to believe. And how can that happen?
[2:09:07] Humanly speaking, we'll never be able to
[2:09:08] do it. And that's why people say, "I
[2:09:11] just can't live it." And walk away
[2:09:14] because you never can. We can never
[2:09:16] change our heart. He has to change our
[2:09:19] heart. He has to take out this stony
[2:09:21] heart of flesh and replace it
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; with a brand new heart.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; I love how Brother Bradom says it. You
[2:09:27] know, before we can get the baptism of
[2:09:29] the Holy Ghost, he has to give us a new
[2:09:30] spirit. And don't think for a second
[2:09:32] that new spirit is truly the baptism of
[2:09:33] the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; That's where people get in treacherous
[2:09:36] ground. They think, "I got a new spirit.
[2:09:38] Glory to God. I've got the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:40] Look at me. I'm a good person. I go to
[2:09:41] church. I pay my tithe. I I dress right.
[2:09:43] I act right. I talk. Everything in my
[2:09:45] life is right except for that one
[2:09:47] thing." You know what? We still need to
[2:09:48] keep pressing on because there's another
[2:09:50] measure of the exact same grace. It's
[2:09:52] not another step of grace. It's the
[2:09:55] exact same grace that we've already
[2:09:56] experienced. And I think it's just
[2:09:58] beautiful. We have got to be willing to
[2:10:00] believe in the Lord and count it to him
[2:10:03] for our righteousness.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; And what's beautiful is he is our
[2:10:08] righteousness.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; We don't have any righteousness. It's
[2:10:11] him living out through us. His word in
[2:10:13] us that causes that righteousness to be
[2:10:16] good. Are we okay still? We're okay for
[2:10:18] time
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; because I feel like I'm really just
[2:10:20] getting started. I'm I'm not going to
[2:10:22] lie to you here. I I just think it's
[2:10:24] amazing when we look at this scripture
[2:10:26] in Genesis 15. We started with verse 9.
[2:10:29] And he said,"Lord God, whereby shall I
[2:10:32] know that I shall inherit it?" And he
[2:10:34] said unto him, "Take me a heer of three
[2:10:36] years old, and a sheaggo of three years
[2:10:37] old, and a ram of three years old, and a
[2:10:39] turtle dove, and a young pigeon." He
[2:10:41] went to God with this need, with this
[2:10:44] desire. How many times do we do it,
[2:10:47] brothers and sisters? Go to God with a
[2:10:49] need and a desire. I think it's so
[2:10:52] important for us to be able to do that.
[2:10:54] We are able, but are we willing? And and
[2:10:56] when we have that need and that desire,
[2:10:59] do we do that with that need or the
[2:11:01] desire? Or do we say, "No, I've got
[2:11:03] something else. I've got another way.
[2:11:05] Someone taught me some other thing. I'm
[2:11:07] just going to do it that way or or that
[2:11:09] how." We don't want to do that. We want
[2:11:11] to make sure that we believe in the Lord
[2:11:13] and count it to him for righteousness.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; But here he had a question. And I think
[2:11:20] verse seven is is beautiful. And he said
[2:11:22] unto him, I am the Lord that brought
[2:11:24] thee out of and of the Chaldes to give
[2:11:27] thee this land to inherit it. That's
[2:11:30] why, brothers and sisters, when we talk
[2:11:32] about the land of inheritance. In that
[2:11:35] day, it was a geographical location. In
[2:11:38] this day, it is not a geographical
[2:11:40] location. Going to Jeffersonville ain't
[2:11:42] going to save you.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Going to another church ain't going to
[2:11:46] save you. Although you could get fed
[2:11:49] maybe a little better and I wouldn't
[2:11:50] doubt it because I know who I am. I I'm
[2:11:52] not a great teacher. But I do know this
[2:11:55] brothers and sisters, it don't no matter
[2:11:56] matter where you go. You've got to get
[2:11:59] the Holy Ghost.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; If you don't get the Holy Ghost, you're
[2:12:06] going to miss the blessing of God. No
[2:12:07] matter where it is you go,
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; no matter what it is you do,
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; it's not going to actually work. But
[2:12:14] when you do get that baptism of the Holy
[2:12:16] Ghost, you do go into that inheritance
[2:12:18] for our day. That's the inheritance for
[2:12:20] us in our day. We preached on the book
[2:12:22] of Joshua how it parallels Ephesians.
[2:12:25] We're now seated in heavenly places.
[2:12:27] We're predestinated to be for ordained
[2:12:30] of God to be holy and without blame
[2:12:33] before him in love.
[2:12:35] But we got to march forward. How do we
[2:12:37] do that? The only way is to get the Holy
[2:12:40] Ghost in our lives. That is our promised
[2:12:41] land. If we want that inheritance, it's
[2:12:44] the same inheritance that he's talking
[2:12:45] to Abraham about here, but it is another
[2:12:48] actual meaning. It's a compound meaning
[2:12:51] and a compound revelation to the same
[2:12:53] scripture here. But you know, if we've
[2:12:55] never had an opportunity in our life
[2:12:57] where we've had the Holy Ghost, you
[2:12:58] might be wondering why, brother Barry,
[2:13:00] you're going on like this. We have got
[2:13:02] to be able to have an experience with
[2:13:04] God. Amen.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; If we don't know it, how can God say,
[2:13:09] "Do you remember that time back there
[2:13:11] then when I took you out of the land of
[2:13:14] the Chaldanss? I took you out of the
[2:13:16] land of I told you to leave all of your
[2:13:19] family's traditions. I told you to leave
[2:13:21] all of your family's teachings and get
[2:13:23] all the way into Christ Jesus for
[2:13:25] yourself. Do you remember when you did
[2:13:27] that back there? And how the word began
[2:13:30] to expound to you in mighty ways like
[2:13:32] you had never imagined? If you've never
[2:13:35] experienced that, brothers and sisters,
[2:13:37] how can you ever step into that place?
[2:13:40] How can you ever have that conversation
[2:13:42] with the Lord? He wants to be able to
[2:13:44] tell us, "I am the Lord that brought
[2:13:46] thee out of whatever it is that we were
[2:13:49] into."
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; And many times what we're into is things
[2:13:52] that we think are okay.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; But you know what? They're not
[2:13:57] necessarily
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; because I I'm so thankful. I had a
[2:14:02] pastor that taught me, he taught us,
[2:14:04] those people that were around when he
[2:14:05] was here, he said, 'Make make a list of
[2:14:07] 10 things that you believe.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Write them out and then take each one of
[2:14:11] those numbered number one to 10, right
[2:14:14] back to the word of God and make sure
[2:14:16] that you can draw a connection to those
[2:14:19] beliefs right back to the word of God.
[2:14:21] And if you can't do that, then what
[2:14:23] you're doing is believing something that
[2:14:25] was taught
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; by a man. Yeah.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; And remember Jesus said they're teaching
[2:14:30] for doctrines the commandments of men.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Don't think that we're exclusive in the
[2:14:35] message. That that ain't going to
[2:14:36] happen. The devil is going to come right
[2:14:38] in the midst of the message church and
[2:14:41] try and bring some sort of wacky thing
[2:14:44] that will cause us to just go a little
[2:14:45] bit off and we'll believe that we're all
[2:14:47] right.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; But we have to have the Holy Ghost in
[2:14:51] our lives, brothers and sisters. That's
[2:14:52] the only way we're ever going to know
[2:14:53] the difference. That's the only way
[2:14:54] we're ever going to know if there's a
[2:14:56] false prophet or a false teaching is to
[2:14:58] have the Holy Ghost in our life.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; We can know all the books, know all the
[2:15:01] tapes, been all the places, have all the
[2:15:04] memorabilia. It ain't going to do us a
[2:15:06] bit of good.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; Because the devil's more religious than
[2:15:09] that.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Lord God, whereby shall I
[2:15:14] know that I shall inherit it?" This is
[2:15:17] where it gets good. This is where I
[2:15:18] think it really starts to become
[2:15:20] encouraging because we know that he
[2:15:22] believed in the Lord and the Lord
[2:15:23] counted it unto him for righteousness
[2:15:25] because he was a believer. He came to
[2:15:26] church. He was justified and sanctified.
[2:15:28] We know that he he he came and and did
[2:15:31] everything that he should do. He was a
[2:15:32] good man. He separated himself from his
[2:15:35] family. Remember God told him, "I want
[2:15:37] you to leave your family alone. Leave
[2:15:40] all that you know and come into a
[2:15:42] different land. Come into another place
[2:15:45] where you don't know the people. where
[2:15:46] the people don't know you, where it's
[2:15:48] uncomfortable. That's where God wants to
[2:15:50] get us is into a position where we're
[2:15:52] uncomfortable. And that's why, brothers
[2:15:54] and sisters, the trials come our way.
[2:15:56] But we're supposed to count those trials
[2:15:58] with with greater than gold.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to rejoice in the midst
[2:16:02] of those trials because that's God
[2:16:04] dealing with us. That that we've talked
[2:16:06] about this, Brother Don. That's his
[2:16:08] grace to us, isn't it?
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Those trials, those fiery trials are
[2:16:13] God's grace to us.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We were talking about it on
[2:16:17] the weekend. Many people, they don't
[2:16:18] struggle. Why don't they struggle?
[2:16:19] Because the devil's already got them.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; My They got money. They got health. They
[2:16:27] got health and wealth. You see it all
[2:16:28] the time. They've got the means. They're
[2:16:30] happy seemingly, right? But they don't
[2:16:34] have this. They don't have what we have.
[2:16:38] And that's why I say it's amazing that
[2:16:39] we could look at the thing that's
[2:16:41] probably the most difficult to
[2:16:43] comprehend the promise that we can't
[2:16:45] even really begin to explain our
[2:16:47] salvation and we all believe it. But
[2:16:49] when it comes to that need in our lives
[2:16:51] right now, do we believe that he is able
[2:16:53] to do it for us
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; just like he's able to do salvation for
[2:16:58] us?
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. my
[2:17:02] we know that Abraham said to him and
[2:17:04] Lord God whereby shall I know
[2:17:08] that I shall inherit it and I just want
[2:17:11] to encourage us brothers and sisters ask
[2:17:14] God this question don't be bashful take
[2:17:17] that question if you have a question if
[2:17:19] you have a need in your life ask him
[2:17:21] that question how will I know that I
[2:17:25] will inherit this in my life for me this
[2:17:28] is personal Now it's not about anybody
[2:17:31] else. This is just about me.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; God said unto him, we know, take a heer
[2:17:38] of three years old and a she goat of
[2:17:40] three years old and a ram of three years
[2:17:41] old and a turtle dove and a young
[2:17:43] pigeon. God gave him the instructions.
[2:17:46] And what did he do? He followed them.
[2:17:50] God will give us instructions if we ask
[2:17:52] him. If he gives us instructions, are we
[2:17:54] willing to follow them? I say, "Lord,
[2:17:55] help me." I know he's given me
[2:17:57] instructions in my life and I think Lord
[2:17:59] that's just a little too hard. Oh man,
[2:18:01] you're I think you're asking a little
[2:18:02] bit too much. In fact, I think the
[2:18:04] scripture actually gives me a workound.
[2:18:05] There ain't no workaround with the
[2:18:07] leadership of the Holy Ghost, brothers
[2:18:08] and sisters. Because I'll tell you what,
[2:18:10] if God is actually leading us, he is
[2:18:12] always going to lead us exactly
[2:18:14] according to his word. The leadership
[2:18:16] that we get in our heart is going to
[2:18:18] take us right back to the word of God.
[2:18:20] We're going to be able to find it in the
[2:18:21] word of God. When people say, "I'm led."
[2:18:24] Are you led? Who are you being led by?
[2:18:26] You being led by Jesus Christ, the same
[2:18:28] yesterday, today, and forever. Or are
[2:18:29] you being led by an unholy religious
[2:18:32] spirit? Because an unholy religious
[2:18:34] spirit is going to have the workaround
[2:18:36] in the word. The Holy Ghost is going to
[2:18:38] take us right back to the word. Then
[2:18:40] we're going to be able to say, "Thank
[2:18:41] you, Father." Just like Brother Bradom
[2:18:43] says in the message, "Thank you, Daddy.
[2:18:45] I know that it's you leading me because
[2:18:46] it goes right back to your word."
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; But when we ask with sincerity, are we
[2:18:51] ready for the answer? That's the
[2:18:53] problem. That's the question.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; He asked God. God gave him the answer.
[2:18:58] He said, "Do this." So he did it. Verse
[2:19:01] 10. And he took unto him all these.
[2:19:03] Sounds really simple the way we're we're
[2:19:05] talking about this, but I trust we're
[2:19:06] getting somewhere with it. And he took
[2:19:08] unto him all these, and divided them in
[2:19:10] the midst, and laid each piece one
[2:19:12] against another, but the birds divided
[2:19:15] he not. And we know that later on in the
[2:19:17] in the book of Deuteronomy or Leviticus,
[2:19:19] there is an old Old Testament
[2:19:21] description in the law of what to do
[2:19:23] with the birds. And it goes into the
[2:19:25] speckled bird. We're not going to get
[2:19:26] too far into that, but he divided the
[2:19:28] birds not. And and it's an interesting
[2:19:30] thing I just wanted to make mention of.
[2:19:32] Verse 11 says, "And when the fowls came
[2:19:34] down upon the carcasses, Abram drove
[2:19:37] them away.
[2:19:39] When the sun was going down, a deep
[2:19:40] sleep fell upon Abram, and lo and horror
[2:19:42] of a great darkness fell upon him. And
[2:19:44] he said unto Abram, "Know of assurityity
[2:19:48] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[2:19:51] land that is not theirs, and shall serve
[2:19:54] them."
[2:19:55] I just can't help but think, brothers
[2:19:57] and sisters, as we are, the royal seed
[2:19:59] of Abraham, here we are in a land that's
[2:20:02] not our home. We're just passing
[2:20:05] through. We're just pilgrims in this
[2:20:06] land. Don't get too comfortable here. We
[2:20:08] heard brother Mano Freezen say it last
[2:20:10] weekend. No matter what happens, we
[2:20:13] cannot stay here.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Don't try and get comfortable here. We
[2:20:19] got to go.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; We got a date with destiny and it's
[2:20:23] going on to that city. We've got an
[2:20:26] inheritance that he's given us. But
[2:20:28] here, I want to talk about this for a
[2:20:29] little bit just for time sake. I'll try
[2:20:31] and be quick. Verse 10. And he took all
[2:20:33] these and he divided them in the midst
[2:20:35] and he laid each piece one against the
[2:20:37] other. And the birds divided he not. And
[2:20:39] we talked about this on Wednesday, how
[2:20:41] important it is to remember what brother
[2:20:43] Brandham said about the Chinese laundry
[2:20:45] and how they couldn't understand
[2:20:47] English. And and what happened was they
[2:20:49] would actually write down in Chinese
[2:20:52] maybe a a suit and pants and a shirt and
[2:20:55] what they would do is take the tag and
[2:20:56] they would tear the tag and they would
[2:20:58] give one to the customer and the guy who
[2:21:00] was operating the cleaners would keep
[2:21:02] the tag with the clothes and the only
[2:21:04] way you got those clothes back was to
[2:21:06] bring the other half of that tag. And if
[2:21:09] you didn't have it, there was no way you
[2:21:11] were going to get it. And here, Brother
[2:21:12] Bradom, he talks about this in the
[2:21:15] message. I'm not going to bring a quote
[2:21:16] on it, but just for time sake, I'm going
[2:21:18] to talk about it. I think I just want to
[2:21:20] preach a little bit of my heart. It's
[2:21:22] it's important for us to recognize how
[2:21:24] this applies to us in our life. We can
[2:21:26] ask God for an answer and he'll give us
[2:21:28] the direction, but are we willing to
[2:21:30] apply that direction to our lives? I
[2:21:32] say, "Lord, help me. Help me apply the
[2:21:34] direction when you give it to me." Amen.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't say there's a time frame
[2:21:38] here, brothers and sisters. And this is
[2:21:40] what I want to get to in this scripture
[2:21:42] here. He took him all these, divided
[2:21:44] them in the midst, and laid each piece,
[2:21:46] one against the other. And we know,
[2:21:47] brother Bradom, he talks about that as
[2:21:49] being like the Chinese laundry. He took
[2:21:51] half of the the ram here and half of the
[2:21:53] ram there. He divided them and set them
[2:21:56] down and laid them out. He followed the
[2:21:58] instruction of the Lord until
[2:22:01] when they went up into the the upper
[2:22:04] room at Pentecost. What was their
[2:22:05] instruction? Go ye into Jerusalem and
[2:22:08] tar there.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Until
[2:22:12] not for 2 days, not for 5 days, not for
[2:22:14] 15 days and 20 seconds. No, no. Until
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; the time appointed of the father. If we
[2:22:20] have a need in our life, I want to say
[2:22:22] this, brothers and sisters. Read this
[2:22:23] scripture here. Think about it. We can
[2:22:25] ask the Lord with all sincerity. He'll
[2:22:27] remind us that I'm the one that brought
[2:22:29] you out. I'm the one that brought you
[2:22:31] out of what you were into. I'm the one
[2:22:33] that delivered you into a promised land.
[2:22:35] I gave you the ability to get the Holy
[2:22:37] Ghost in your life.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; Now, I've got an instruction for you.
[2:22:42] Are you willing to follow it?
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; My goodness. If we're not willing to
[2:22:45] follow it, I think it'd be better for us
[2:22:47] to not even ask, brothers and sisters.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Lord, help me cuz I know
[2:22:52] I've asked and I've been given
[2:22:53] instruction." It's not easy being a
[2:22:55] human that believes because why? Because
[2:23:00] the spirit is emnity against this flesh.
[2:23:03] This flesh is emnity against the spirit.
[2:23:06] Both of them are waring one with the
[2:23:07] other.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; We know that's Romans chapter 7. But
[2:23:10] don't stay there. Like I say, turn the
[2:23:12] page.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8. There is therefore now
[2:23:15] no condemnation to those who what?
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Who are in Christ Jesus who what? Who
[2:23:21] walk not after the flesh.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; But after the spirit.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Get after the spirit, brothers and
[2:23:28] sisters. Ask him for an answer and he'll
[2:23:30] give you one
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; and are we willing to follow it?
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful.
[2:23:42] He followed the instructions. He
[2:23:44] separated all the carcasses and he laid
[2:23:45] them there.
[2:23:47] And you know it was until we don't have
[2:23:51] a time frame. We don't know how long.
[2:23:53] Many times in our life we can do that.
[2:23:54] We can follow the instructions of the
[2:23:56] Lord. We can do everything. We can ask
[2:23:57] him. He can remind us. We can say amen
[2:24:00] to the word and go through all the steps
[2:24:02] and get to the place where now we've
[2:24:03] laid everything out. But you know what
[2:24:05] happens? Says it in the scripture here.
[2:24:08] When the birds started coming,
[2:24:11] Abram got up and had to shoe away the
[2:24:13] birds. Don't think for a second that
[2:24:15] when we get our sacrifice laid out
[2:24:16] before the Lord, brothers and sisters,
[2:24:18] the devils ain't going to come around
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; and try and get at our sacrifice and try
[2:24:23] and corrupt our sacrifice and try and
[2:24:25] get us to not believe. That's when it's
[2:24:27] going to happen. In that moment while
[2:24:29] we're waiting for the promise of God to
[2:24:31] come by.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; That's when the devil's going to come
[2:24:35] around. The fowls of the air are going
[2:24:37] to come and try and eat our sacrifice.
[2:24:39] Don't let the devil eat your lunch.
[2:24:41] Brothers and sisters, get up and shoe
[2:24:43] those devils away. We know that we can't
[2:24:45] stop them from coming, but we can stop
[2:24:47] them from feeding. We can stop them from
[2:24:49] roosting. And I love how we hear brother
[2:24:51] Brandham say, it's just like the Old
[2:24:53] Testament and the New Testament
[2:24:54] together. It's a double barrel shotgun.
[2:24:56] Give those fowls of the air a dose of
[2:24:59] lead poisoning. Send them on their way
[2:25:01] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; And you know, it doesn't have to be
[2:25:05] shouting. It doesn't have to be
[2:25:06] stomping. You can just simply speak the
[2:25:08] word.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; I think it's amazing when we talk about
[2:25:12] Jesus Christ.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; He never got mad very often, did he?
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; The only thing that really got him riled
[2:25:17] was those religious ones.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Those ultraorththodox ones that were
[2:25:21] turning his father's house into a den of
[2:25:23] thieves. That got him a little upset.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; But you know, for the rest of the time,
[2:25:27] simply told devils, just come out of
[2:25:29] her.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; You know what, centurion type of the
[2:25:33] gentile bride, just go your way
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; because your faith hath made him whole.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Just because you asked, go your way.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; Your servants find.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; All of the types, we know it. Getting
[2:25:47] back to our scripture here, we got to be
[2:25:50] willing to just take the time. And what
[2:25:52] time is it? Why? The devil wants to get
[2:25:55] us impatient. We live in a world of
[2:25:57] impatience.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; There's so much impatience and anxiety,
[2:26:02] agitation because we want something done
[2:26:04] a certain way, certain time frame. Oh,
[2:26:07] it's got to be. It's got to be. What
[2:26:08] does it got to be? This is the word of
[2:26:09] God. It's going to be his way, his time
[2:26:12] according to his word.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; And if we're willing to take him at his
[2:26:16] word, that simply watch the blessing of
[2:26:19] God come into our life. Amen.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; You know, if Abraham tried to do a work
[2:26:24] around here and say, you know, I'm just
[2:26:25] going to do something else.
[2:26:28] What would have happened
[2:26:31] if he would have said, "No, I'm not
[2:26:32] going to actually take a a goat or a
[2:26:34] shem. I'm just going to substitute it
[2:26:36] with another animal. I'm just Right."
[2:26:38] You can imagine.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; There came a time after the waiting.
[2:26:43] Verse 17. And it came to pass that when
[2:26:45] the sun went down and it was dark,
[2:26:48] behold, a smoking furnace and a burning
[2:26:51] lamp that what? It passed between those
[2:26:55] pieces.
[2:26:57] I just want to say this today, brothers
[2:26:58] and sisters, as as I draw it to a close
[2:27:01] because I don't want to keep us here too
[2:27:03] long. But think about this.
[2:27:06] Once we get our sacrifice in order, laid
[2:27:09] out before him, our questions, the
[2:27:12] instructions that he's given us, and we
[2:27:14] have actually applied them. Again, I'm
[2:27:16] saying, Lord, help me. I'm the same as
[2:27:19] every one of us here. The inspiration
[2:27:21] comes and you can only preach it and you
[2:27:23] have to either say amen to it or reject
[2:27:25] it. And I just want to say amen to it
[2:27:27] all the way along. But I know it applies
[2:27:29] to me, too.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying I'm not not I'm
[2:27:32] exclusive. I'm not exclusive. He we ask
[2:27:35] we ask him let's not ask a miss like the
[2:27:38] book of James so that we can ask things
[2:27:41] upon our flesh upon our lusts let's ask
[2:27:44] things according to the word of God
[2:27:45] according to the spirit let's walk not
[2:27:47] after the flesh
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; and what our desires are
[2:27:51] but it came to pass that when the sun
[2:27:53] went down
[2:27:56] and when it was dark my just can't help
[2:27:59] but think you know sometimes it gets
[2:28:00] pretty dark in our lives doesn't Feels
[2:28:03] like the sun's gone down on us. Feels
[2:28:05] like the Lord's not even there.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; But it's right then, brothers and
[2:28:09] sisters, that that pillar of fire is
[2:28:11] going to come and it's going to
[2:28:13] manifest. It's going to walk in between
[2:28:15] every one of our sacrifices. He's going
[2:28:17] to come and check out every single room
[2:28:19] in our house. And like brother Brandham
[2:28:21] preached that message, doors in door. Is
[2:28:24] there any room for Abram to have any
[2:28:26] reservation in what he believes in a
[2:28:28] situation like that? There's no room.
[2:28:30] Amen.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; No room at all. How would we ever want
[2:28:33] to have a room in our lives that's
[2:28:35] locked up with those little secrets,
[2:28:37] those things that that maybe someone has
[2:28:39] hurt us, maybe someone has done us
[2:28:41] wrong, maybe someone hurt our parents,
[2:28:43] maybe someone hurt them or did them
[2:28:44] wrong, maybe our brother, maybe our s
[2:28:46] whatever it is in this life, that thing
[2:28:48] that we just can't let go of, why would
[2:28:50] we want to hold on to it?
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; Lay it down. Amen.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; That thing is going to take you and hold
[2:28:56] you back from seeing that pillar of fire
[2:28:59] come down upon your sacrifice.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; In fact, what that thing is, I'll tell
[2:29:03] you what it is. It is one of those fowls
[2:29:05] of the air that's come down and actually
[2:29:07] said, "I'm going to make my nest right
[2:29:09] here. I'm going to roost right here.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; It's a squatter. It's got no rights to
[2:29:13] be in your tree.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; Shoot it out of there. Get rid of it."
[2:29:18] You know, brother Brandom talks about
[2:29:19] this what this was the smoking furnace
[2:29:22] in the in the vision of Abram. And while
[2:29:24] he was going through this dream, it was
[2:29:26] actually the the manifestation of
[2:29:30] Calvary.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Of the spirit of God coming down upon
[2:29:34] his sacrifice and saying, "This is my
[2:29:37] beloved son. Hear ye him." And we know
[2:29:40] the first order of business after that
[2:29:42] flesh was torn, after the separation of
[2:29:44] body, soul, and spirit. His first order
[2:29:46] of business wasn't to go down into hell
[2:29:48] to release the captives or go up to
[2:29:50] heaven to receive praise. It was to go
[2:29:51] right into the most religious place and
[2:29:54] rip that veil and say, "For you to stay
[2:29:56] out any longer now means death." Once
[2:29:59] upon a time, it meant you're dying to go
[2:30:01] past that veil, to go into the Holy of
[2:30:03] Holies. But nowadays, brothers and
[2:30:05] sisters, since Calvary, since this
[2:30:07] smoking furnace that brother Brandham
[2:30:09] brings out, Calvary, it means death to
[2:30:12] stay out of it.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:15] Came to pass that when the sun went down
[2:30:17] and it was dark, behold, a smoking
[2:30:18] furnace and a burning lamp passed
[2:30:20] between those pieces, in the same day
[2:30:23] the Lord made a covenant with Abram,
[2:30:26] saying, "Unto thy seed have I given this
[2:30:29] land from the river of Egypt, the river
[2:30:32] the great river, the river Euphrates."
[2:30:34] Now, I want to say this, I say it at
[2:30:36] home here all the time for those people
[2:30:37] who are visitors. Every time we hear the
[2:30:39] knights, the Annites or whatever they
[2:30:42] are, just picture them as devils.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; They're just enemies in the land. And
[2:30:46] God's going to deal with every single
[2:30:48] one of them. But we can't look at them
[2:30:49] and get scared. We can't allow them to
[2:30:52] rattle our faith. We've got to be strong
[2:30:54] in faith, giving glory to God.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the Kennites and the
[2:30:59] Kennesites and the Komites and the
[2:31:02] Hittites and the Perizzites and the Raf
[2:31:05] Raffilms and the Amorites and the
[2:31:07] Canaanites and the Gegosites and the
[2:31:10] Jebusites. Every one of them, every
[2:31:12] single one of them who are inhabitants
[2:31:14] of the land. They built the houses. They
[2:31:16] did the gardens. They probably kept the
[2:31:18] bees and had the hives. They had the
[2:31:20] cows with the milk. They did the
[2:31:22] pomegranates. They did the figs. They
[2:31:24] they were vineyard dressers. They had
[2:31:26] the the vines that that it took two men
[2:31:29] to carry the bunch of grapes from. All
[2:31:31] of those were the children of Israel's
[2:31:34] possession
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; that they were sent to create.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; Don't think for a second that God
[2:31:40] doesn't know exactly where we are
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; and exactly what we're going through.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; He's going to bring it to pass according
[2:31:47] to his word.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; Which is his time.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; And we've got to be willing to just
[2:31:52] wait. Amen.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; And when the devils come around and try
[2:31:55] and land as fowls on our sacrifice,
[2:31:57] don't let them. Even if you let them
[2:31:59] land, brothers and sisters, I can't help
[2:32:01] but think, you're going to have to go
[2:32:02] and clean that poop off your sacrifice
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; if you let them land. Don't let them
[2:32:06] land.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; You don't have to scare them away before
[2:32:09] they even land.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, that might sound
[2:32:12] really kind of silly and funny to say
[2:32:14] it, but you know what happens? It's a
[2:32:16] thought that comes into our mind.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; That's the fowl coming down on the
[2:32:20] sacrifice. Let's just break it right
[2:32:22] down. Now, in the last few minutes, the
[2:32:24] thoughts come, brothers and sisters. We
[2:32:25] can't stop them. But they're not our
[2:32:27] thoughts. Satan's going to say, "They're
[2:32:28] your thoughts. You thought of that. No,
[2:32:30] I never. You brought it to me."
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; And I can't help but think even in the
[2:32:34] midst of a a church service where the
[2:32:36] the spirit of the living God wants to
[2:32:38] minister to needs. The devil will come
[2:32:40] around and plant strange thoughts in
[2:32:41] your head that are totally contrary to
[2:32:43] the word. Get out the double barrel
[2:32:45] shotgun of the Old and New Testament and
[2:32:47] put that devil to run.
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; You don't have to tolerate it. send him
[2:32:52] on his way.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; The same day, the same day that he made
[2:33:00] that sacrifice to the Lord, the Lord
[2:33:03] came and made a covenant with him. I
[2:33:06] just want to tell you, brothers and
[2:33:07] sisters, if you've never experienced it
[2:33:09] in your life where you can say that that
[2:33:13] he can come back to me and say that I am
[2:33:15] the Lord that brought thee out of
[2:33:18] whatever it was that you're in. If you
[2:33:19] don't know that, he wants you to know
[2:33:20] that. Don't think he doesn't want you to
[2:33:22] know that. For for there to be a thought
[2:33:24] in your head that he doesn't want you to
[2:33:25] know that is a lie of the devil.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; He wants you to know that. He wants you
[2:33:30] to know him as your God. He wants us to
[2:33:33] know him as a deliverer. He wants us to
[2:33:36] know him as a savior. He wants us to
[2:33:38] know him as a redeemer.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; He wants us to know him in all of his
[2:33:44] attributes.
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; We've got to be willing to follow his
[2:33:47] instruction. And I'll call the musicians
[2:33:49] up because I don't want to keep us too
[2:33:52] long. But I just want to encourage us
[2:33:54] that, you know, if we're the royal seed
[2:33:55] of Abraham,
[2:33:57] there's a promise for us.
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; And that promise is greater than any one
[2:34:03] of the circumstances in our lives. And I
[2:34:05] just can't help but think of summarizing
[2:34:07] it this way. You know, just like
[2:34:10] Abraham, he staggered not at the promise
[2:34:13] of God through unbelief. And you know,
[2:34:15] brothers and sisters, that might sound
[2:34:17] like a really weak statement because
[2:34:18] many times the world is set up in such a
[2:34:20] way that there's the the prosperity
[2:34:22] gospel. We've got to be able to see a
[2:34:24] return on our investment. I tithed all
[2:34:26] these years. I mean, shouldn't there be
[2:34:28] something a little more deep given to me
[2:34:31] from the pulpit or whatever it is? We we
[2:34:33] invested in the church. We did all this
[2:34:35] stuff and and look at what's coming back
[2:34:37] to us. There should be a return on our
[2:34:39] investment. as the royal seed of
[2:34:41] Abraham. There's no greater return on
[2:34:43] the investment, brothers and sisters,
[2:34:44] than being able to stagger not at the
[2:34:47] promise of God through unbelief because
[2:34:48] we're all going to stagger. Don't look
[2:34:50] at the flesh, though. When we start to
[2:34:52] look at what we've done and and who we
[2:34:54] are and all of that, it's it's the
[2:34:56] devil.
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; Look to Jesus Christ, brothers and
[2:34:59] sisters. Just take a and look away to
[2:35:01] Jesus Christ and see if he won't
[2:35:03] actually change that stony heart and
[2:35:05] turn it into a heart of flesh once
[2:35:07] again.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. you know, maybe stand with us as
[2:35:10] we as we close here. I've just got one
[2:35:12] little tiny quote that I'm going to
[2:35:13] read. It's out of modern events are made
[2:35:14] clear by prophecy. The brothers know
[2:35:16] that I sent quotes. I haven't read any
[2:35:18] of them and I'm not going to except for
[2:35:20] the one that I didn't send them. So,
[2:35:23] here we go. Just for the sake of uh
[2:35:25] discussion, this is out of the royal the
[2:35:27] the sorry, the modern events are made
[2:35:29] clear by by prophecy. He says, "Now we
[2:35:33] are supposed to be the royal seed of
[2:35:35] Abraham. Isaac was the natural seed. But
[2:35:39] the faith seed, the faith in the
[2:35:42] promised word, remember this is 1965,
[2:35:44] the end of this prophetic utterance just
[2:35:48] before he went off the air, 1965.
[2:35:51] But the faith seed, the faith in the
[2:35:53] promised word, the promised word, he
[2:35:56] says, don't miss it, was that royal
[2:35:59] seed. That was the seed, Abraham's
[2:36:03] faith.
[2:36:04] We being dead in Christ, we are
[2:36:07] Abraham's seed, hes with him according
[2:36:10] to the promise. Don't look for worldly
[2:36:14] blessings.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; He's going to meet all of our needs
[2:36:16] according to his riches in Christ Jesus.
[2:36:18] We know he's got all the money. All the
[2:36:20] money is his.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; All this world is his
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; all of it.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; But we're not here looking for this
[2:36:27] world, are we?
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; This world has to perish.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; This world has to be renovated. But once
[2:36:34] it's renovated, then we step into it.
[2:36:36] Then it becomes ours. It's a wonderful
[2:36:39] thing. Remember the faith in the
[2:36:41] promised word. That is the thing we
[2:36:43] should be looking for. His faith living
[2:36:46] out through us. The only way that
[2:36:47] happens is through his life living out
[2:36:49] through us. The only way that happens is
[2:36:51] for the true baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:36:53] The only way that happens is for us to
[2:36:55] fully surrender unto him.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; God, richly bless you all as we bow our
[2:36:59] heads for prayer.
[2:37:02] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we
[2:37:04] thank you for your word, thank you for
[2:37:06] each and every life represented here
[2:37:08] today, Lord, that we can take of our
[2:37:10] time and our resources and gather
[2:37:12] together in your name. Father, we we
[2:37:15] just ask that Lord, many times we can
[2:37:19] follow your instructions. We can ask you
[2:37:21] and follow your instructions. And Lord,
[2:37:22] it seems like in our perception that the
[2:37:26] time is ticking. it's going by and
[2:37:29] you're not answering us the way that
[2:37:31] maybe your word promises you would. Not
[2:37:34] even the way that we desire. But Father,
[2:37:36] help us to have your patience.
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; Help us to run this race
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; with patience, Lord. Help us to know
[2:37:44] that you are completely in control. And
[2:37:47] Father, we'll be careful to give you the
[2:37:49] praise when that when that comes to pass
[2:37:52] in our lives. Help us in the meantime,
[2:37:54] Lord Jesus, to shoe away those devils
[2:37:57] when they come around, the fowls of the
[2:37:58] air that want to actually mess up our
[2:38:01] sacrifice for you, Lord. They want to
[2:38:03] mess up our our actions that we've taken
[2:38:06] towards your instruction in our lives.
[2:38:08] Help us, Lord Jesus. We ask that you
[2:38:10] would lead us and guide us according to
[2:38:12] your word now. And Father, as we go our
[2:38:15] separate ways, we pray the fellowship
[2:38:16] wouldn't stop, Lord. That we would
[2:38:18] continue to fellowship around you. that
[2:38:20] you would be the central theme of all
[2:38:22] that we think, say, and do. Lord Jesus,
[2:38:26] be with those who are traveling away
[2:38:28] this weekend. Father, I just can't help
[2:38:30] but think about all those who are maybe
[2:38:32] tuning in streaming right now. We know
[2:38:34] you're not bound by time or space. Oh,
[2:38:36] Father, you could be down in the in the
[2:38:38] Cinney. Lord, you could be Oh, Father,
[2:38:41] up at Pine Lake, Father, there's nowhere
[2:38:43] that you can't be. You're not bound by
[2:38:45] time or space. Bless all of our brothers
[2:38:47] and sisters of like Precious Faith who
[2:38:49] are traveling. Lord, thank you for
[2:38:51] bringing Sister Ne and brother Logan
[2:38:53] home safely from their honeymoon. Lord,
[2:38:55] for blessing their marriage. Father,
[2:38:57] Lord, you are so wonderful. We just love
[2:38:59] you and we thank you, Lord. We pray that
[2:39:01] Lord, you would just be glorified now
[2:39:03] with a couple songs before we separate
[2:39:06] and go our separate ways. That Lord
[2:39:08] Jesus, maybe tomorrow when we wake up,
[2:39:10] we would wake up with a song in our
[2:39:12] heart, Lord, and a spring in our step to
[2:39:14] know that you speak to us. And when you
[2:39:16] do, we follow you, Lord Jesus. And
[2:39:18] because of that, you bless us according
[2:39:21] to your word that we have that faith,
[2:39:23] Lord Jesus, that will one day change our
[2:39:25] bodies. We love you, Father, and we
[2:39:28] thank you. We just commit all of our
[2:39:30] lives into your hands now for your care.
[2:39:33] In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
