[52:21] study a little bit about the uh talking
[52:25] about the Holy
[52:28] Ghost but I want to take a different
[52:30] maybe angle today maybe try and wrap up
[52:33] the the series that we've been talking
[52:35] about the the Holy Ghost if you could
[52:37] turn to Hebrews chapter
[52:41] 6 what uh what the Holy Ghost was given
[52:44] for and what is the holy ghost that
[52:47] brother bandam preached those two
[52:49] sermons I would like to move into a
[52:53] another sermon Lord willing
[52:56] and that will be questions and answers
[52:57] on the holy
[52:59] ghost that was preached uh right after
[53:03] Hebrews chapter 6 we'll just read the
[53:05] first two verses
[53:08] here of Hebrews chapter
[53:11] 6 verse one says therefore leaving the
[53:14] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[53:17] us go on to
[53:19] Perfection not laying again the
[53:21] foundation of repentance from dead works
[53:23] and of Faith towards God god of the
[53:26] doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of

[54:16] seated

[54:25] house of the Lord once
[54:27] again just a couple of announcements um
[54:30] before we get too far we have the ladies
[54:32] brunch coming up on the

[54:56] services are you happy this morning amen
[55:00] there's uh so much that I'd like to get
[55:02] into
[55:03] but I just feel uh compelled to maybe do
[55:07] a little bit of a recap and just maybe
[55:10] remember go over what we've been talking
[55:12] about is the two sermons that brother
[55:14] brandham preached and and one of them is
[55:17] called what is the Holy Ghost and the
[55:19] other one is what is the Holy Ghost
[55:20] given for and they are a a a series that
[55:25] are in the message app the table two
[55:29] Services right together and uh I just
[55:32] think it's such an important one I I I
[55:36] just can't get away from it you know the
[55:38] first one is what is the Holy Ghost and
[55:40] and I said from the beginning it just
[55:42] really resonated with me it's important
[55:44] to not just talk about what is the Holy
[55:47] Ghost um although it is very important
[55:50] to talk about what is the Holy Ghost the
[55:52] Holy Ghost is Christ the life of Jesus
[55:54] Christ that same Pillar of Fire that was
[55:56] with the children of Israel in the
[55:58] desert the same Pillar of Fire that
[56:01] protected the children of Israel from
[56:02] their enemies is the same Pillar of Fire
[56:05] that was actually recorded in the Sam
[56:08] Houston Coliseum and that was God
[56:11] himself making himself known to mankind
[56:14] showing that that same Pillar of Fire is
[56:17] back on Earth again it's not somewhere
[56:20] out there in the universe coming
[56:22] Somewhere in Time not just somewhere in
[56:25] the past but the present tense I am God
[56:28] himself back with people and so it
[56:31] caused me to actually go to a a place
[56:33] where I just couldn't get away from the
[56:35] thought who is the Holy Ghost because
[56:37] it's not just what is the Holy Ghost
[56:39] it's not just an intangible Spirit
[56:42] that's somehow someway going to come
[56:44] upon the church someday this is Jesus
[56:46] Christ the same yesterday today and
[56:48] forever and we know that brother bradam
[56:50] said that was one of the the the
[56:52] keystones for his ministry is to
[56:54] recognize that he is not somewhere in
[56:56] the future and somewhere in the past and
[56:59] and just ignore what's going on right
[57:00] now he is right here and and this has
[57:03] been on my heart for so long brothers
[57:05] and sisters if you want to see the
[57:06] Rapture of the church you're going to
[57:09] see it but what you're seeing is it
[57:11] right now this is the rapture of the
[57:13] church because we are going through a
[57:15] body change and eventually there's going
[57:18] to be a culmination of this body change
[57:20] where this wine the new wine is poured
[57:22] into the old Badger skins and those
[57:24] Badger skins these Badger skins will no
[57:26] longer be able to contain the revelation
[57:28] of Jesus
[57:30] Christ Lord and then we're going to have
[57:32] a body change we're not going to just
[57:34] become perfect someday Somewhere Out
[57:37] There it requires a bit of effort on our
[57:40] part but we have to have faith inside of
[57:43] us to mix with the word when it comes we
[57:46] know the children of Israel when they
[57:47] came out of bondage they were going
[57:49] towards the promise for their day but
[57:52] the word of God says they didn't have
[57:53] faith in their hearts to to mix with the
[57:55] word when it came and that was the
[57:58] downfall for
[57:59] them but what is the Holy Ghost is the
[58:01] first one who is the Holy Ghost Jesus
[58:03] Christ brother Bram he says that's what
[58:05] the Holy Ghost is it's a power it's a
[58:07] seal it's a comforter it's an advocate
[58:10] it's a sign oh my it's the assurance
[58:13] that God has received
[58:16] you I I've just got a few random ones
[58:19] brother Logan
[58:21] I'll I'll just pitch them and we'll see
[58:24] if you can hit him if not don't worry no
[58:27] pressure it's Christ brothers and
[58:29] sisters that's the Holy
[58:31] Ghost the very person of Jesus Christ
[58:35] and I think it can be so easy to put it
[58:37] off and and put it out there as
[58:38] something intangible and make it
[58:41] undefined it's the Holy Ghost and you
[58:43] know when it gets to that place then
[58:45] what happens is the devil can creep in
[58:46] and say well the Holy Ghost can be
[58:48] whatever you would like it to be the
[58:50] Holy Ghost can be your interpretation of
[58:52] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost can be
[58:54] my interpretation of the Holy Ghost and
[58:56] it could be their interpretation of the
[58:57] Holy Ghost we all have the Holy Ghost
[59:00] you know what one's going to be right
[59:03] the one that sticks with the word and
[59:06] not just the one that sticks with the
[59:07] word because many people will be
[59:09] Scholars of the word and reject the
[59:12] Vindicated Prophet for the day it's got
[59:15] to be according to that Vindication of a
[59:18] prophecy the prophet that God would
[59:20] choose to use to say hey there's a Time
[59:23] coming where we're going to turn the
[59:25] hearts of the children back to the faith
[59:27] of the Pentecostal fathers and everyone
[59:30] in the Christian world who are Scholars
[59:32] especially would be able to say amen
[59:33] that's a scripture that's going to
[59:35] happen sometime but when right what if
[59:38] we said it's already happened amen
[59:41] there's a group of people that are
[59:42] already back to the faith of the
[59:43] Pentecostal fathers we're not looking
[59:45] for for signs and wonders they just
[59:47] follow us but we've been in the upper
[59:50] room and we've been able to see that
[59:52] Pillar of Fire for ourselves and now
[59:55] that Pillar of Fire isn't just on a
[59:56] picture in a wall that Pillar of Fire is
[59:58] right
[1:00:00] here and the life Bears witness of it
[1:00:04] Amen brother bradam talks about it it's
[1:00:06] not it's not gossiping it's not going
[1:00:08] out and and doing all the things of the
[1:00:10] world it's not backbiting it's not all
[1:00:13] these different things that we used to
[1:00:14] do but somewhere somehow something
[1:00:18] happened to us we became a new creature
[1:00:20] in Christ Jesus when that Pillar of Fire
[1:00:22] came into our lives and burnt out all
[1:00:24] that
[1:00:27] stuff that's what the Holy Ghost is it's
[1:00:29] Christ the very person of Jesus Christ
[1:00:32] what was the Holy Ghost given for I want
[1:00:34] to say this who was the Holy Ghost given
[1:00:37] for for those people that have faith in
[1:00:39] their hearts am to mix with that word of
[1:00:42] a Vindicated Prophet that came in our
[1:00:44] day that's who the Holy Ghost was given
[1:00:46] for because who has the Holy Ghost today
[1:00:49] boy this could be a real maybe call it a
[1:00:51] rabbit hole of discussion and maybe a
[1:00:54] content ious issue like I said there's a
[1:00:56] lot of people that will say oh I've got
[1:00:57] the Holy Ghost I believe God sent a
[1:00:59] prophet maybe I've preached this message
[1:01:01] for for decades but do you live it do
[1:01:04] you live this message or do you just
[1:01:06] preach it brother bradam talks about the
[1:01:08] preachers they can be just as as mixed
[1:01:10] up as the as the as the leoty I say Lord
[1:01:14] help me I don't want to be bringing a
[1:01:15] false Doctrine I want to make sure it's
[1:01:17] true to the word amen but who is the
[1:01:20] Holy Ghost given for it's given for the
[1:01:21] Believers what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:01:23] for brother br he says that's what it is
[1:01:25] it's to make you you personally live a
[1:01:29] holy life not just say that I believe
[1:01:32] but then go out and destroy our brother
[1:01:34] or our sister in conversation or do a
[1:01:36] Shifty business deal and know that I'm
[1:01:38] going to come out on top maybe we go
[1:01:40] into a store and and we buy something
[1:01:42] for 99 cents and we put a dollar bill on
[1:01:45] the counter a and the person the clerk
[1:01:48] gives us change for a $10 bill and we
[1:01:51] say oh I could give them all this money
[1:01:54] back or I could say
[1:01:57] scored and actually go home and I could
[1:01:59] buy nine more of whatever it was that I
[1:02:01] just bought and the one that I just got
[1:02:02] was free isn't that nice that's not the
[1:02:05] life of a Believer the life of a
[1:02:07] Believer is going to say nope nope I I
[1:02:10] don't deserve that that's actually yours
[1:02:13] that's not mine right but you know the
[1:02:15] devil's watching and so is
[1:02:18] God that's a banana peel on our
[1:02:21] pathway bam says that's what it is to
[1:02:23] make you live holy life that's what the
[1:02:26] Holy Ghost is power for to set your
[1:02:31] affections on things
[1:02:32] above where God stands the the mind of
[1:02:36] Christ in you you can't help from seeing
[1:02:39] those things remember we were talking
[1:02:41] about this last Sunday and I didn't
[1:02:42] really want to harp on it today too hard
[1:02:45] but you know what we live in this world
[1:02:46] this world is is created in such a way
[1:02:49] that that the lust of the Flesh and the
[1:02:51] lust of the eyes and and the biggest one
[1:02:54] of all the pride of life is what we
[1:02:56] contend with in this world that's what
[1:02:58] brother bam was talking about we see
[1:02:59] these things everywhere we go he says
[1:03:01] when you look at them you turn your head
[1:03:03] that's right it's to make you you say oh
[1:03:06] I can't do it oh I just can't do it he
[1:03:10] says sure you can't and we know that
[1:03:13] this is the statement that most of call
[1:03:15] it the message believing young people
[1:03:17] that actually go out into the world they
[1:03:19] say it I just can't live it so why would
[1:03:21] I try you're 100% right even the prophet
[1:03:23] said you
[1:03:24] can't nobody can live it except for
[1:03:27] Christ and that's why we drill on this
[1:03:30] brothers and sisters get the Holy Ghost
[1:03:32] the only way you're going to be able to
[1:03:33] live it is for him to live it through
[1:03:36] you you say I can't do it oh I just
[1:03:39] can't do it sure you can't but the Holy
[1:03:41] Spirit came for that purpose amen that's
[1:03:44] what it did it come to take them out of
[1:03:47] you all them old habits and things that
[1:03:49] you're doing that old backbiting this
[1:03:53] one is I think probably the the most
[1:03:54] important brothers and sisters and
[1:03:56] forgive me for it but I think it's
[1:03:57] important we have to talk this way this
[1:03:59] is the age in which we live in it's not
[1:04:01] time to play church it's real easy to
[1:04:03] quit drinking and quit smoking
[1:04:05] figuratively to say these things that
[1:04:07] are such a big transition we can see a
[1:04:09] maybe a lightning bolt experience you no
[1:04:11] longer go and sit in the saloon you
[1:04:13] don't go to the bar you don't maybe go
[1:04:15] to the dances you don't go and do these
[1:04:17] worldly things but what about a
[1:04:19] religious spirit that loves to come and
[1:04:22] sit down in church in service and say my
[1:04:26] everything's good in my life brother
[1:04:28] bradam he says that old backbiting
[1:04:30] separating yourself saying bless God I'm
[1:04:32] a Methodist and I'm going to say this
[1:04:34] that old backbiting separating yourself
[1:04:36] saying bless God I'm a message believer
[1:04:39] it ain't enough you got to get Christ
[1:04:42] but the message believing the message
[1:04:45] will get you Christ
[1:04:48] amen and he says I I'll read the whole
[1:04:51] thing it just inspires me that old
[1:04:52] backbiting separating self saying bless
[1:04:55] God I'm a message believer he says
[1:04:57] Methodist here I won't have nothing to
[1:04:59] do with them Holy Rollers the Holy Ghost
[1:05:03] came to take that out of you that
[1:05:06] religious spirit that says you're an
[1:05:08] exclusive Christian you're not exclusive
[1:05:11] we're not
[1:05:12] exclusive the only thing that makes us
[1:05:14] exclusive is his grace in our
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:18] lives it's that old time Holy Spirit the
[1:05:22] devil won't go near it right amen but
[1:05:25] that's why people fear it because they
[1:05:28] got a little bit of the devil around
[1:05:29] them and the devil won't let them go
[1:05:32] near it but boy the more you come around
[1:05:35] it you'll either get in or you'll get
[1:05:37] out that's what's going to happen and we
[1:05:39] know that's the word to the church in
[1:05:40] the back there I'm not just making this
[1:05:42] up brother Bram said it but that old
[1:05:44] backbiting separating yourself saying
[1:05:46] bless God I'm a Methodist bless God I'm
[1:05:49] a message believer I'm a good person you
[1:05:51] know what there's way better people in
[1:05:52] the world than message believers
[1:05:56] and even people filled with the Holy
[1:05:57] Ghost brothers and sisters we fall flat
[1:05:59] on our face
[1:06:01] right there's better people than people
[1:06:04] filled with the Holy Ghost when you want
[1:06:05] to judge people by works but we're not
[1:06:07] judging by works
[1:06:10] am the letter kth but the spirit giveth
[1:06:15] life you don't want to be backbiting
[1:06:18] separating ourselves saying I'm
[1:06:20] exclusive that's a bunch of rubbish
[1:06:23] saying we're exclusive you know what
[1:06:25] when we when we recognize truly what God
[1:06:28] has done for us it causes a great
[1:06:30] humility in our lives because we
[1:06:33] recognize outside of Christ but for the
[1:06:35] grace of God there go
[1:06:37] I I could be outliving on the
[1:06:40] street addicted to
[1:06:44] something but it's God's grace to us
[1:06:48] Allelujah that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:06:50] came to take that out of you brothers
[1:06:52] and sisters to deliver us from this
[1:06:54] world to overcome sin the devil and
[1:06:58] death that's what the Holy Ghost came
[1:07:00] for and and you know we're we just can't
[1:07:03] get away from this thought most of all
[1:07:05] in the day in which we live brothers and
[1:07:06] sisters the Holy Ghost what did he come
[1:07:08] for he came to Deliver us from
[1:07:12] ourselves there's this whole narrative
[1:07:14] that certain people can just divorce
[1:07:18] people in the message even divorce was
[1:07:20] written a bill of divorce was given we
[1:07:22] know Jesus talked about this this is
[1:07:24] totally off notes now it's going into a
[1:07:26] different realm but we know this whole
[1:07:29] bill of divorcement was given to Moses
[1:07:31] in in the desert and and and the
[1:07:33] children of Israel when they had Jesus
[1:07:34] in their midst and they came and they
[1:07:36] tried to tempt him and said why could
[1:07:38] why could we have a Bill of divorcement
[1:07:40] that bill of divorcement wasn't so that
[1:07:42] we could actually separate ourselves
[1:07:44] from our wives or our wives from
[1:07:46] ourselves that's a trick of the devil
[1:07:48] because the word of God says what God
[1:07:50] brings together let no man put us under
[1:07:53] amen but it was wasn't so from the
[1:07:54] beginning that that bill of divorcement
[1:07:57] that bill of divorcement was there from
[1:07:59] before the foundation of the world for
[1:08:01] the people who come so that they could
[1:08:03] divorce themselves so that they could
[1:08:05] divorce their old nature if you ever
[1:08:06] listen to Invisible Union of the Bride
[1:08:08] of Jesus Christ you'll hear what he's
[1:08:10] talking about he's not talking about
[1:08:11] naturally separating from your husband
[1:08:13] or your wife and the whole world
[1:08:15] listening to that message took it that
[1:08:17] way and they had such tremendous
[1:08:19] outpouring of of condemnation because so
[1:08:21] many people were divorced and remarried
[1:08:23] and sure enough it's an important
[1:08:25] discussion you can't be a minister and
[1:08:27] be divorced and then and then be
[1:08:30] remarried while you're divorce that's
[1:08:32] not going to happen maybe if your your
[1:08:34] spouse passes away God takes your spouse
[1:08:36] home sure I don't want to get too far
[1:08:38] into this but brothers and sisters the
[1:08:40] Holy Ghost came to Deliver us from
[1:08:42] ourselves so that we could have a a a
[1:08:45] writing of divorcement for ourselves so
[1:08:47] it's once and and finished it's over we
[1:08:50] don't have to live with that old
[1:08:52] personality because remember brother
[1:08:53] Adam he said it very clearly God is not
[1:08:55] going to actually live with an an
[1:08:59] adulteress and unless your former
[1:09:02] husband is dead you are an adulteress so
[1:09:05] if we're trying to flirt with the word
[1:09:07] of God and pretend that we're Christians
[1:09:09] and Christianity but not willing to die
[1:09:11] out to ourselves to accept him then we
[1:09:14] are spiritually living as
[1:09:17] adulterers we've got to be willing to
[1:09:19] die out to ourselves that old man has to
[1:09:22] die
[1:09:24] so that we can observe the greatest
[1:09:25] Miracle ever amen not signs and wonders
[1:09:29] but although it is signs and wonders
[1:09:31] because it's not even normal it's not
[1:09:33] even natural the greatest Miracle of all
[1:09:35] remember brother bradam said it many
[1:09:36] times in the message and thy seed shall
[1:09:39] possess the gates of his enemies you
[1:09:40] don't have to look it up I'll just read
[1:09:41] it for time's sake um but brother bradam
[1:09:43] he says but that's what we are like we
[1:09:46] are now a wheat a grain of wheat in
[1:09:48] God's Garner how many wheat are here
[1:09:50] today in God's Garner we're all wheat
[1:09:52] here today
[1:09:54] but there was a time when we was a
[1:09:55] cucklebur brother Bram says when we was
[1:09:58] a cucklebur and God changed us from a
[1:10:00] cucklebur to a grain of wheat completely
[1:10:03] gave us a new DNA showed us that we're
[1:10:06] no longer a cucklebur we don't have to
[1:10:08] deal with all the things that we used to
[1:10:10] when we was a cucklebur and God changed
[1:10:12] us from a cucklebur to a grain of wheat
[1:10:14] he says makes the fruits
[1:10:16] different we don't just keep displaying
[1:10:19] the same examples of our life the same
[1:10:21] examples of our life it makes the fruits
[1:10:24] different changing your mind your ideas
[1:10:27] it's the greatest miracle that ever
[1:10:29] happened when a man or a woman is Born
[1:10:31] Again of the spirit of God and becomes a
[1:10:33] new creation in Christ
[1:10:36] Jesus
[1:10:40] amen great you know we've been focusing
[1:10:44] on the Holy Ghost a
[1:10:48] lot and I just can't get away from it
[1:10:50] because I know that we contend with
[1:10:52] spirits
[1:10:54] we contend with a lot of spirits we
[1:10:56] contend with a lot of people yes and
[1:10:59] they bring their history their their
[1:11:01] maybe culture maybe they're different
[1:11:03] things there's only one thing that's
[1:11:04] going to save us brothers and sisters
[1:11:06] and that's the Holy Ghost amen that's it
[1:11:10] a and as far as I'm concerned we could
[1:11:12] talk about the Mysteries we could talk
[1:11:13] about the seals we can talk about all
[1:11:16] the different things that there are to
[1:11:17] talk about in the message of the hour
[1:11:19] but all of it is for one purpose
[1:11:21] brothers and sisters that's to introduce
[1:11:23] the he bridegroom to his Earthly bride
[1:11:26] and the only way he's going to accept
[1:11:28] his Earthly bride is if she is he if she
[1:11:31] has his nature the only way she's going
[1:11:33] to be he and have his nature is for his
[1:11:35] Spirit to actually live inside of her
[1:11:39] amen we've been focusing on the Holy
[1:11:42] Ghost and you know it might sound like I
[1:11:44] I harp on it to the point where we just
[1:11:46] talk about the raptures being the only
[1:11:47] point I I want to just say today it's
[1:11:50] not all about that that's the
[1:11:52] culmination that's what's going to
[1:11:53] happen
[1:11:54] somewhere out there in the future it's
[1:11:55] definitely going to happen but it's also
[1:11:57] happening now we said that earlier but
[1:11:59] you know one of the reasons we focus on
[1:12:01] the Holy Ghost it's it's how we can
[1:12:03] overcome this world there is an
[1:12:04] overcoming power to every single
[1:12:06] situation in this world and we don't
[1:12:09] have to tolerate all of the devil's
[1:12:11] Antics we don't have to tolerate any of
[1:12:13] them we have to contend with them
[1:12:15] they'll come around he'll throw banana
[1:12:16] peels he'll have traps you'll have
[1:12:18] things that will try and stumble us all
[1:12:20] along the way that's going to happen but
[1:12:21] we're going to get back up and we're
[1:12:22] going to keep walking
[1:12:24] amen but as soon as we try and do it on
[1:12:26] our own without his spirit inside of us
[1:12:29] we're going to trip and fall and say man
[1:12:31] that hurt I I don't think I want to do
[1:12:32] that again I'm not going to subject
[1:12:34] myself to that kind of pain anymore but
[1:12:38] when we have his spirit inside of us
[1:12:40] there's something inside something keeps
[1:12:41] holding us isn't it doesn't something
[1:12:43] keep holding us what drags us to church
[1:12:45] on a Sunday sometimes we have so much
[1:12:48] pain and and anxiety in our lives but
[1:12:51] yet we still want to go to church right
[1:12:54] there's no way that any human could ever
[1:12:56] live this outside of Christ Living in
[1:12:57] our lives and you know brother bradam
[1:12:59] talks about it there's going to be a lot
[1:13:01] of impersonation of Christians millions
[1:13:03] and billions of impersonators of
[1:13:06] Christianity people that were never able
[1:13:08] to receive this word for their
[1:13:11] day but you know if we've been able to
[1:13:13] do it I just think it's all the more
[1:13:15] reason for us to Rejoice we have been
[1:13:17] given so much in our day if we're able
[1:13:19] to say Amen to the word for our day and
[1:13:22] you know if we're able to say say amen
[1:13:23] for the word for our day like I said
[1:13:25] near the beginning we're able to contend
[1:13:27] with our brother and our sister amen
[1:13:29] we're able to have Grace one for another
[1:13:32] am we don't actually become exclusive
[1:13:34] and say well I'm better than someone
[1:13:36] because none of us are better than
[1:13:37] anyone we're all Sinners saved by grace
[1:13:41] it's only what God has done for us amen
[1:13:44] oh my in fact I would have to say when I
[1:13:47] hear someone say that I would say I
[1:13:48] don't know if maybe there's been a real
[1:13:50] experience there because Grace hasn't
[1:13:52] really been expressed to the individual
[1:13:54] yet what true Grace really is through
[1:13:58] Christ Jesus brothers and sisters we are
[1:14:00] more than conquerors that's what the
[1:14:02] Holy Ghost is given
[1:14:03] for we need to understand it we can we
[1:14:06] can say it but do we understand it that
[1:14:09] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:14:14] is in this world because when that
[1:14:16] happens brothers and sisters doesn't
[1:14:18] matter how far down we fall we're always
[1:14:20] going to get back up because he that's
[1:14:22] inside me is greater than my problem in
[1:14:25] my
[1:14:28] life isn't it interesting because even
[1:14:30] though we talk about falling down
[1:14:32] brother Bram he says it I would say this
[1:14:34] God says it through brother Bram the way
[1:14:36] up is
[1:14:38] what that's the way up how do we
[1:14:41] actually humble ourselves in the sight
[1:14:43] of the lord we say it all the time I
[1:14:45] just can't get away from it we humble
[1:14:46] ourselves before our brother and our
[1:14:48] sister we don't puff ourselves up and
[1:14:50] say this that the other thing it's it's
[1:14:53] it's the greatest Miracle is
[1:14:54] understanding that God has called us and
[1:14:56] and and chosen Us in him before the
[1:14:58] foundation of the world to actually be
[1:15:00] his representation
[1:15:03] here you know if we ever get the Holy
[1:15:06] Ghost In Our Lives when we get the Holy
[1:15:08] Ghost the true markers of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:10] is that we just desire to line up with
[1:15:12] this word that's all we can never do it
[1:15:14] on our own but when he the spirit of
[1:15:16] truth comes around th this is sort of
[1:15:18] just a little brief summary of of the
[1:15:21] Holy Ghost series brothers and sisters
[1:15:23] just what's on my heart how important it
[1:15:24] is for us to get into Christ because
[1:15:26] when we get into Christ we're going to
[1:15:28] love our brothers we're going to love
[1:15:29] our sisters even if we can't agree with
[1:15:32] them we're still going to shake hands
[1:15:33] and say God bless you I love you and
[1:15:35] we'll still be able to fellowship and
[1:15:37] and still be able to Fellowship can you
[1:15:39] believe that what a thing that is my
[1:15:42] goodness 1959 what was the Holy Ghost
[1:15:45] given for now we're going to get into
[1:15:46] the the quotes that I sent paragraph 150
[1:15:49] brother brandham says one more scripture
[1:15:51] if you want to write it down John
[1:15:55] 12:24 let me quote it to you right quick
[1:15:58] what I want to do today is just wrap up
[1:16:01] sort of the end of that message and I
[1:16:02] want to get into the questions and
[1:16:03] answers into our scripture here of
[1:16:06] Hebrews chapter 6 Lord
[1:16:10] willing is it just about 11: now that
[1:16:13] time has
[1:16:15] changed just want to
[1:16:18] check if a corn of wheat falls into the
[1:16:20] ground except it die it cannot bring
[1:16:22] forth another life brother Bram he says
[1:16:24] now look one closing remark now and
[1:16:26] remember then it is absolutely now to
[1:16:30] you people it's absolutely essential and
[1:16:34] necessary and compelling and compulsory
[1:16:38] that you receive the Holy Ghost now amen
[1:16:42] I don't know how much more clear it
[1:16:44] could be said than that it's not just
[1:16:48] something Vogue that we're talking about
[1:16:49] saying yeah we'll be a better person
[1:16:52] yeah will be able to
[1:16:54] overcome as Believers of this word it is
[1:16:57] compelling it's absolutely essential
[1:17:00] that we get the Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:17:02] and necessary and compelling and
[1:17:05] compulsory that you receive the Holy
[1:17:06] Ghost now for if you don't you cannot
[1:17:09] come in the
[1:17:11] resurrection now watch God cannot break
[1:17:14] his laws we know that he follows his
[1:17:17] laws now I can't remember if I've got
[1:17:19] the quote in here but in this message
[1:17:20] brother bradam he says God he has a word
[1:17:23] and he sets the line and you tow up to
[1:17:24] that line and that's the way he does it
[1:17:27] when you want to serve him that's what
[1:17:28] we do we step up to the line that he
[1:17:30] positions for us and that's his word we
[1:17:33] don't make excuses for it and say well I
[1:17:36] I've been baptized in titles and and
[1:17:37] that's good enough what is a title you
[1:17:40] can't write a check in the name of a
[1:17:41] title you can't say I'm going to write a
[1:17:43] check in the name of my father if I did
[1:17:46] that it would mean nothing wouldn't it I
[1:17:49] would at least have to say in the name
[1:17:50] of Al Johnson for it to mean anything
[1:17:56] right I don't want to get into that sory
[1:17:59] what was the Holy Ghost given for
[1:18:00] brother Bram he goes on to say and I
[1:18:02] don't care what you look like or how
[1:18:05] things are or how
[1:18:08] unpopular or how popular you are how
[1:18:11] pretty or how ugly if you've got eternal
[1:18:15] life there you will live forever and
[1:18:18] ever and forever he says when the moon
[1:18:21] and stars is gone and the Earth has
[1:18:23] weeped itself into the mountains and the
[1:18:24] deserts and everything has hasn't it's
[1:18:26] no more and the world is toddling like a
[1:18:28] drunk man coming home at night and the
[1:18:31] Stars refuse to shine and fall from the
[1:18:34] heavens and the Moon Turns to blood and
[1:18:36] the sun blushes and hides its face when
[1:18:39] they see the son of man coming you'll
[1:18:41] shine in the righteousness of Jesus
[1:18:44] Christ to come forth from the grave as a
[1:18:47] young beautiful woman to take your mate
[1:18:50] and live forever and forever and forever
[1:18:53] and all Eternal ages you'll still be
[1:18:56] living that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:00] for if you feel the least tug don't turn
[1:19:04] it
[1:19:06] away what is the Holy Ghost God in you
[1:19:11] what's it for to continue his work
[1:19:15] amongst his people to bring his church
[1:19:18] together to bring the church to a place
[1:19:21] in this day far beyond the
[1:19:23] Lutheran Methodist Pentecostals I'm
[1:19:27] going to say message Believers beyond
[1:19:30] all of that into a place to an adoption
[1:19:33] and a rapturing
[1:19:35] Grace that when this part of the church
[1:19:38] when the spirit moves into this church
[1:19:41] here it'll just raise it'll bring forth
[1:19:44] bring forth all the redeemed that's
[1:19:46] touched the spirit now I just want to be
[1:19:48] clear I don't want to be a problem
[1:19:50] brothers and sisters we believe the
[1:19:51] message of the hour we believe in
[1:19:54] William Mary and brandom we believe the
[1:19:56] message that he brought we would be
[1:19:58] considered to be message Believers but
[1:20:00] if that's as far as it goes it ain't
[1:20:02] enough because even the messenger would
[1:20:05] say don't just be a message believer get
[1:20:07] into Christ amen because when he the
[1:20:10] spirit of truth comes will be able to
[1:20:11] recognize what the messenger brought to
[1:20:14] this age and that's what the messenger
[1:20:16] brought was Christ so when I throw off
[1:20:19] when you hear me saying that about
[1:20:21] message Believers I'm talking about
[1:20:22] people that just say I believe God sent
[1:20:24] a prophet and that's as far as it
[1:20:27] goes brothers and sisters that's not
[1:20:30] enough we've got to get into Christ
[1:20:32] we've got to be willing to sing the
[1:20:34] Praises of God we've got to be willing
[1:20:37] to have a personal relationship with
[1:20:39] Jesus Christ
[1:20:41] amen we're not willing to be
[1:20:43] fundamentalists that are just good
[1:20:45] people cled in Robes of righteousness we
[1:20:48] know that's what Adam and Eve did in the
[1:20:49] beginning they tried to hide themselves
[1:20:53] they tried to say we've got a religion
[1:20:55] our religion's good our religion's no
[1:20:58] good we know that what the word of God
[1:21:00] says that our our righteousness is what
[1:21:04] filthy rags before him all things are
[1:21:07] naked before him we can't hide nothing
[1:21:09] from
[1:21:11] him even though he stands on the outside
[1:21:13] and knocks on the door he won't let
[1:21:15] himself in he could he can see right
[1:21:18] through that door he can see right down
[1:21:20] underneath the stairs in that house he
[1:21:22] can see every single hidden room right
[1:21:25] through into the most secure locked safe
[1:21:28] those places that we don't even like to
[1:21:29] go in our minds and our hearts he looks
[1:21:31] right to it and he says I just want to
[1:21:33] come in and help you I'll help you deal
[1:21:35] with all of that just open the door to
[1:21:38] me and I'll come in and Su with
[1:21:42] you
[1:21:43] right so I'm not throwing off on the
[1:21:46] message of the hour I believe the
[1:21:48] message of the hour I preach the message
[1:21:50] of the hour the message of the hour is
[1:21:52] Christ in you the hope of
[1:21:55] glory the Heavenly bridegroom now in in
[1:21:59] in I want to say a visible Union with
[1:22:01] the bride of Jesus Christ here on Earth
[1:22:04] and how is it visible she lines up with
[1:22:06] every single word she doesn't have her
[1:22:08] own Creeds she doesn't have her own
[1:22:10] dogmas she doesn't take some funky Spin
[1:22:13] and says well this is what the prophet
[1:22:15] said and this is what someone said the
[1:22:16] prophet said so that's why we do it this
[1:22:19] way there's no other messenger there's
[1:22:21] only one messenger and that's William
[1:22:23] Mary and branam and and the message that
[1:22:25] he brought was Jesus Christ the same
[1:22:27] yesterday today and forever and get into
[1:22:29] Jesus Christ and when he gets into you
[1:22:31] the greatest miracle that could ever
[1:22:33] take place will take place you will no
[1:22:35] longer be a cucklebur you won't be a
[1:22:36] religious person you will be a humble
[1:22:39] Christian you'll just simply believe the
[1:22:41] word of God for your
[1:22:43] day what was the Holy Ghost given for
[1:22:45] paragraph 134 brother Bram he says here
[1:22:48] some time ago we had a fire down in the
[1:22:50] city here I just love this because this
[1:22:52] puts put me in check brothers and
[1:22:53] sisters as we read this I want you to
[1:22:55] know this is my heart this is what we
[1:22:57] need in the Life in in the day in which
[1:23:00] we live we need message preachers like
[1:23:03] this he says here some time ago we had a
[1:23:05] fire down in the city here the the foul
[1:23:07] Oil Company caught on fire they had the
[1:23:09] Jefferson fire department down there and
[1:23:11] a friend of mine a good man never used
[1:23:13] to big fires like that he was walking
[1:23:15] there saying spad a little water over
[1:23:16] here sprad a little water over here here

[1:23:26] little water there he says but across
[1:23:29] the river come a trained fireman from
[1:23:31] Louisville that big Hook and Ladder no
[1:23:33] more than stopped till the chief was at
[1:23:35] the end of the ladder when the ladder

[1:23:39] ax before he got there and knocked the
[1:23:41] window out said come on boys that's it
[1:23:44] the fire went out in a few minutes
[1:23:46] brother Bram says not spurt a little
[1:23:48] water here spurt a little water there
[1:23:50] puts you in mind some of these
[1:23:51] intellectual ual preachers come along
[1:23:54] let's go I know it's the truth I've
[1:23:57] tasted seen the glory the Holy Ghost is
[1:24:00] right God is good don't try here and try
[1:24:04] there let's walk into
[1:24:06] him he's here it's for you God gave his
[1:24:11] power to his church
[1:24:13] am not to spurt out this here and spurt
[1:24:17] out you'll never get nothing done he
[1:24:19] says lead on Amen woo can't even see
[1:24:23] through through them no more it just
[1:24:25] makes me think I I want to I want to not
[1:24:28] be that one that's just spurred a little
[1:24:29] here spur a little there be an
[1:24:31] intellectual message minister to know
[1:24:34] all the quotes and know all about what
[1:24:36] was talked about in the message of the
[1:24:38] hour maybe where it was preached and
[1:24:40] what the year was and all of the
[1:24:42] Nostalgia that surrounds it we need to
[1:24:44] know Christ brothers and sisters but
[1:24:47] then all of that will come to life for
[1:24:49] us then we'll see wow look at the power
[1:24:51] of God de dealing with people's lives
[1:24:53] who else could discern the heart of man
[1:24:56] right
[1:24:59] amen but that's what the Holy Ghost was
[1:25:01] given for so that we could become new
[1:25:04] creatures in Christ Jesus amen so that
[1:25:06] we don't have to just be intellectual
[1:25:09] message
[1:25:10] Believers you know what happens when you
[1:25:12] become an intellectual message believer
[1:25:14] you know all the quotes and you know the
[1:25:15] Nostalgia you know all of that what
[1:25:16] happens is there's room for
[1:25:19] error you become lukewarm formal and
[1:25:23] Powerless because what you're doing is
[1:25:25] resting in the message of the hour and
[1:25:27] you know I said it before in the past
[1:25:29] and maybe I'll say it again this morning
[1:25:30] and I don't mean to upset people if you
[1:25:33] feel uncomfortable and you don't
[1:25:34] understand I don't make it clear here
[1:25:35] this morning please come and talk to me
[1:25:37] but sometimes I believe we can mistake
[1:25:40] the message of the hour for the Holy
[1:25:42] Ghost for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:44] because I've got this understanding I've
[1:25:47] got an intellectual understanding of
[1:25:48] this message of the hour I'm saved
[1:25:51] you're not saved you're lost you've got
[1:25:53] to get into Christ but if you truly
[1:25:56] believe this message of the hour if you
[1:25:58] truly look at it and you truly have
[1:26:00] faith in your heart to mix with the word
[1:26:02] for our day brothers and sisters your
[1:26:04] heart will go right back to the faith of
[1:26:06] the Pentecostal
[1:26:09] fathers it's not good enough to say that
[1:26:12] I just believe the message of the hour
[1:26:14] it won't save us it won't even give us
[1:26:16] overcoming power we'll be able to live
[1:26:19] as a good Christian for a while but then
[1:26:22] eventually Satan's got that one punch
[1:26:24] remember he's going to come and he's
[1:26:26] going to give it to us and that'll be
[1:26:28] the the knock that gets us off our
[1:26:31] rocker you know I don't know if I'm
[1:26:32] going to get into it this morning I hope
[1:26:34] I will we still have lots of time praise
[1:26:37] the Lord Brother Bram he talks about a
[1:26:39] death blow for
[1:26:41] Satan who wants to know what the death
[1:26:44] blow for Satan
[1:26:45] is wouldn't we want to know he it's
[1:26:48] actually a stroke a death stroke for
[1:26:50] Satan not a death blow that was my
[1:26:52] interpretation it just does something
[1:26:55] for me to think that we have that kind
[1:26:56] of overcoming power when we got the Holy
[1:26:58] Ghost In Our Lives brothers and
[1:27:00] sisters just being church members won't
[1:27:03] do it just saying that we're Associated
[1:27:05] won't do it just saying that we know
[1:27:07] won't do it we have to become a new
[1:27:09] creature in Christ Jesus when he gets a
[1:27:12] hold of our lives and begins to live out
[1:27:14] through
[1:27:15] us we
[1:27:17] change out of what was the Holy Ghost
[1:27:19] given for brother bradam not paragraph
[1:27:20] 159 oh please pleas let me persuade you
[1:27:24] my Christian brother or sister don't let
[1:27:26] this revival pass you you must receive
[1:27:30] the Holy
[1:27:31] Ghost isn't it beautiful too when we can
[1:27:34] look at this and say this isn't just for
[1:27:38] 1959 this isn't just for
[1:27:40] 1969 or 79 right or
[1:27:44] 89 or
[1:27:46] 99 or
[1:27:48] 19 this is for us today brothers and
[1:27:51] sisters amen this is exactly what we
[1:27:54] need and and I just I can hear his voice
[1:27:57] not just in my ears when I listen to it
[1:27:59] I can hear the voice of Jesus Calling to
[1:28:03] the hearts of his children oh please let
[1:28:07] me persuade you my Christian brother or
[1:28:09] sister don't let this revival pass you
[1:28:12] you must receive the Holy Ghost what is
[1:28:15] it it's the spirit of God what was it
[1:28:18] for to lead you to guide you to fill you
[1:28:23] to sanctify you to call you out into the
[1:28:28] church amen now we know he's not talking
[1:28:30] about a church Association he's talking
[1:28:33] about the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:28:36] the church the the the firstborn the
[1:28:39] general assembly that's that's what he's
[1:28:41] talking about
[1:28:42] there but anyways um just going on here
[1:28:45] I just want to wrap up this message and
[1:28:47] hit these high points here before we
[1:28:48] move on paragraph 163 he says my brother
[1:28:52] my sister as your brother as your
[1:28:55] servant in Christ let me persuade you as
[1:28:58] all my heart don't let this go over your
[1:29:01] head or you go or go by you or under you
[1:29:05] receive it in your heart and you'll be a
[1:29:07] happy person on Earth amen it's not
[1:29:10] about changing and going over there it's
[1:29:12] having overcoming power here brothers
[1:29:14] and sisters recognizing that we don't
[1:29:16] have to deal with the things that we
[1:29:18] have to deal with what if you could you
[1:29:20] could just know right now in your heart
[1:29:21] that when you leave this building even
[1:29:23] in this moment right now if you've got
[1:29:25] that thing in your life that you just
[1:29:26] can't get over I I would want to say
[1:29:28] this but don't raise your hands how many
[1:29:30] people would be able to raise their hand
[1:29:31] and say there's just this thing in my
[1:29:33] life brother Barry I just can't seem to
[1:29:34] get over it in my life it's a cycle I
[1:29:37] just fighted and I hate it it's always
[1:29:39] there how many people would have that in
[1:29:41] their lives I'd be one to say Amen to
[1:29:44] that but you know there is a delivering
[1:29:45] power right now you could receive
[1:29:47] deliverance from that if you want it am
[1:29:52] yes but I want to tell you clearly and
[1:29:54] I'm going to shout it you've got to want
[1:29:57] it you got to want it with everything
[1:30:00] that's inside of your heart and if
[1:30:02] you're wishy-washy about it oh I just
[1:30:05] don't know I'm not going to go that far
[1:30:06] maybe not that far you're sounded like a
[1:30:08] Holy Roller now if that's the way it is
[1:30:10] then you're going to go from here and
[1:30:12] you're still going to have that
[1:30:14] cycle we're still going to
[1:30:16] battle but you've got that overcoming
[1:30:19] power the Dynamics is right here where
[1:30:21] two or three are gathered together in
[1:30:22] his name he's there in the midst if we
[1:30:24] didn't say it this morning we declare
[1:30:26] this meeting in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:30:29] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:30:31] he's here brothers and
[1:30:34] sisters we don't have to contend with
[1:30:36] these things that we contend with in our
[1:30:39] lives he says I'm not promising you get
[1:30:42] a million dollars no
[1:30:44] sir and for the people that think that
[1:30:46] there's a financial gain to get saved to
[1:30:49] get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's
[1:30:51] that's not the case at all I'm not I'm
[1:30:54] not promising you'll get a million
[1:30:56] dollars no sir brother Leo I think
[1:30:58] there's been too much of that promise
[1:31:00] now millions of dollars the things that
[1:31:02] different ones said if you'll be a
[1:31:04] Christian you'd get a million dollars
[1:31:06] and and you'd be a rich man I'm not
[1:31:08] promising you
[1:31:10] nothing I'm promising you this the only
[1:31:14] thing that I can promise you his
[1:31:16] salvation amen his grace is sufficient
[1:31:20] for every trial amen do you believe that
[1:31:23] this morning brothers and sisters am his
[1:31:26] grace is sufficient for every trial amen
[1:31:30] remember Paul he sought him Thrice for
[1:31:33] that one thorn in his flesh didn't he he
[1:31:36] sought him and earnestly wanted an
[1:31:38] answer for it and what did God say to
[1:31:41] him
[1:31:42] Paul so that you don't get so puffed up
[1:31:45] beyond all the Revelation that you've
[1:31:46] got about this message of the hour about
[1:31:48] being what it's like to be in Christ
[1:31:50] Jesus and to maybe have the the ability
[1:31:53] to be raised in a message home so you
[1:31:55] don't get so puffed up beyond all the
[1:31:57] Revelation that you've been given in
[1:31:58] your life you've got this thorn of your
[1:32:00] flesh and you know what it's there for a
[1:32:02] reason so that you recognize it's only
[1:32:04] by my grace that you are saved so if
[1:32:07] you've got Authority in your flesh
[1:32:08] brothers and sisters it's for a reason
[1:32:11] don't let it overcome you recognize why
[1:32:13] it's there but if you surrender it to
[1:32:16] God he'll give you the overcoming power
[1:32:18] for it amen hallelujah Lord
[1:32:22] now I want to start
[1:32:24] preaching want to get into Hebrews
[1:32:26] chapter 6 if we could go back to our
[1:32:28] scripture this morning brothers and
[1:32:30] sisters that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:32:31] Has Come For that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:32:33] is for that's who the Holy Ghost is
[1:32:35] Christ Jesus again on Earth living out
[1:32:37] through his bride body so that she
[1:32:39] doesn't have to be slapped around by the
[1:32:41] devil and and even more so so that she
[1:32:43] doesn't have to be deceived by the devil
[1:32:45] to think that everything is okay in her
[1:32:47] life when she's really not living her
[1:32:49] life according to the word for her day
[1:32:53] that we can actually truly be saved by
[1:32:55] grace that we can truly have the baptism
[1:32:57] of the Holy Ghost that's what the spirit
[1:32:59] of Jesus Christ Has Come For that's what
[1:33:01] the Holy Ghost is
[1:33:02] for Hebrews chapter
[1:33:05] 6 verse one therefore leaving the
[1:33:07] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[1:33:09] us go on to
[1:33:11] Perfection not laying again the
[1:33:13] foundation of repentance from dead works
[1:33:15] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[1:33:18] of baptisms and of laying on of hands
[1:33:21] and of the resurrection of the dead and
[1:33:23] eternal judgment and this will we do if
[1:33:27] God permit so he saying let's not focus
[1:33:30] on all of this because we've done that
[1:33:32] already the church has already done that
[1:33:34] the church has already set in order
[1:33:36] let's actually take a step further and
[1:33:38] move into Perfection and you know
[1:33:40] brothers and sisters there's only one
[1:33:42] thing that's going to be perfect in this
[1:33:44] world that's Jesus Christ that's his
[1:33:46] word and that's why we say we have to
[1:33:48] have the Holy Ghost that's why brother
[1:33:50] bradam the the dispensation Prophet said
[1:33:52] you have to it's a it's it's not even
[1:33:55] negotiable you've got to have the spirit
[1:33:57] of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost living
[1:33:59] out through you you have to have his
[1:34:01] spirit it's essential for us but once we
[1:34:04] have that then let's let's just take a
[1:34:06] step further let's move into Perfection
[1:34:08] shall we I think it's beautiful and he
[1:34:11] says and this will we do if God permit
[1:34:14] in in in verse three now verse four is
[1:34:16] where we want to get into and and this
[1:34:18] is about the questions and answers on
[1:34:19] the Holy Ghost verse four for it is
[1:34:21] impossible for those who were once
[1:34:24] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:34:26] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:34:28] the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good
[1:34:32] word of God and the powers of the world
[1:34:35] to come if they shall fall away to renew
[1:34:39] them again unto repentance seeing they
[1:34:42] crucify themselves the Son of God aresh
[1:34:45] and put him to an open
[1:34:47] shame for the Earth which drinketh in
[1:34:51] the rain that cometh of upon it and
[1:34:54] bringeth forth herbs meat for them by
[1:34:57] whom it is dressed receiveth blessing
[1:35:00] from God but that which beareth thorns
[1:35:04] and briers is rejected and is nigh unto
[1:35:07] cursing whose end is to be burned
[1:35:12] amen verse 9 says but beloved we are
[1:35:15] persuaded better things of you and
[1:35:18] things that accompany salvation though
[1:35:20] thus we
[1:35:23] speak for God is Not unrighteous to
[1:35:25] forget your work and labor of love which
[1:35:28] ye have showed toward his name and that
[1:35:31] ye have ministered to the Saints and do
[1:35:35] Minister where I'm going with this
[1:35:38] brothers and sisters is there's a
[1:35:41] question
[1:35:42] asked in this
[1:35:44] message bear with me for a
[1:35:48] second questions and answers on the the
[1:35:51] Holy
[1:35:52] Ghost preached after
[1:35:55] this these two
[1:36:00] sermons um bear with
[1:36:03] me here we
[1:36:07] go brother
[1:36:09] brandom please explain Hebrews 6:
[1:36:14] 4-6 so I read the scriptures before and
[1:36:17] after just to give us a little bit of a
[1:36:19] context just to zero it in verse four
[1:36:22] we'll just read it again for it is
[1:36:24] impossible for those who were once
[1:36:25] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:36:27] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:36:30] the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good
[1:36:33] word of God and the powers of the world
[1:36:36] to
[1:36:37] come if they shall fall away to renew
[1:36:41] them again unto repentance seeing they
[1:36:44] crucify to themselves the Son of God
[1:36:47] aresh and put him to an open shame
[1:36:52] we know back in
[1:36:54] 1957 brother bradam I think it was in 57
[1:36:58] or 58 one of the two he preached the
[1:37:00] indictment maybe it wasn't then uh it
[1:37:03] was later actually I think but what I'm
[1:37:06] getting at is he said in
[1:37:08] 57 they would reject they would choose
[1:37:10] to accept the word of God for their day
[1:37:13] America would or reject the word
[1:37:16] entirely and we know that that caused
[1:37:18] him to preach the indictment because
[1:37:20] what he said was indict this generation
[1:37:23] for the second crucifixion of the Lord
[1:37:25] Jesus Christ and it just Falls right in
[1:37:27] line with the word the that we've read
[1:37:29] here that they should crucify to
[1:37:32] themselves the Son of God aresh and put
[1:37:34] him to an open shame and and I just love
[1:37:37] the way brother bradam deals with this
[1:37:38] he he goes right into detail with it he
[1:37:42] goes on in paragraph 161 the the
[1:37:44] question is brother Bram please explain
[1:37:47] Hebrews
[1:37:49] 64-6 you have it there beautiful he says
[1:37:53] that's one time it really see now you'll
[1:37:56] have to watch here on our faith Grace
[1:38:00] security of the Believers perseverance
[1:38:02] of the Saints perseverance rather of the
[1:38:05] Saints Hebrews 6 chapter
[1:38:11] 4-6 now as soon as soon as it finished
[1:38:14] this and I hope that God will help me to
[1:38:16] make it real clear to you I'm sorry I
[1:38:18] got my message for tonight maybe I'll
[1:38:19] preach the same thing
[1:38:21] paragraph 162 he says now this is a real
[1:38:24] sticker see now you have to watch now we
[1:38:28] remember now remember we believe and
[1:38:31] teach at this
[1:38:34] church not that everything comes up and
[1:38:37] shouts everything that speaks in tongues
[1:38:41] everything that shake hands with the
[1:38:43] preacher has got eternal
[1:38:47] life but we believe if you've got
[1:38:50] eternal life
[1:38:52] if God has give you eternal life you've
[1:38:55] got it forever
[1:38:58] see because look if it didn't Jesus is
[1:39:03] found a false
[1:39:05] teacher isn't that beautiful brothers
[1:39:07] and sisters if you've been given eternal
[1:39:10] life you've got it
[1:39:12] forever it can't be taken away from you
[1:39:15] if it's been given to you that's right
[1:39:17] it's a free gift of
[1:39:20] God in St John 5:24 he said he that
[1:39:24] heareth my words and believeth on him
[1:39:27] that sent me has everlasting life and
[1:39:30] shall never come to the Judgment but has
[1:39:33] passed from Death unto life now argue
[1:39:36] with
[1:39:37] him isn't that beautiful it's just
[1:39:41] astounding that that he says it in this
[1:39:44] way just argue with him that's his word
[1:39:46] if you have passed from Death unto life
[1:39:49] you you you've got it until till the day
[1:39:51] of your Redemption it's forever nobody
[1:39:53] can change
[1:39:55] that and I would go so far as to say
[1:39:57] even ourselves even if we wanted to
[1:40:00] change it we
[1:40:01] couldn't and and maybe you would say how
[1:40:03] could that be you could look at the
[1:40:05] prophet he wanted to try and actually
[1:40:07] take his own life a couple times and
[1:40:08] somehow something wouldn't let him do
[1:40:11] that God has a way of dealing with us in
[1:40:13] our lives brothers and sisters he will
[1:40:15] always always see his will come to pass
[1:40:18] in our lives and we know those people
[1:40:21] people who maybe actually are believers
[1:40:23] and they try to fall away we know
[1:40:25] there's the story of of a Preacher I
[1:40:27] think it was brother bradam tells a
[1:40:29] story he wanted someone to go and get
[1:40:30] him a box of beer and he wouldn't do it
[1:40:32] he said no you're a preacher I will
[1:40:33] never do that that's not for you and the
[1:40:36] guy was found out doing it though
[1:40:38] drinking it brother bradam was disgusted
[1:40:40] by it by his life that he would even go
[1:40:41] and do that and what he said was that
[1:40:44] God will actually take you off the scene
[1:40:45] if you're not going to fulfill his word
[1:40:48] before you will be able to become an
[1:40:50] unbeliever amen you can't be lost
[1:40:53] brothers and sisters now I'm not saying
[1:40:55] because things get tough it is
[1:40:57] appropriate to go and take your own life
[1:40:59] don't do that a Believer won't want to
[1:41:02] do
[1:41:03] that some people might say well brother
[1:41:05] random did it I don't want to go down
[1:41:06] that rabbit hole today what I want to
[1:41:08] say is that God will never ever have his
[1:41:11] word not come to pass it will always
[1:41:12] come to pass and if you're a Believer
[1:41:14] today it's because of his grace in your
[1:41:16] life and if you're able to have that
[1:41:18] Grace it's forever amen it's not just
[1:41:21] one and done you're saved today and lost
[1:41:23] tomorrow it's not some kind of good
[1:41:25] works that you can
[1:41:26] do in St John 5:24 he said he that
[1:41:29] heareth my words and believeth on him
[1:41:31] that sent me has everlasting life and
[1:41:33] shall never come into the Judgment but
[1:41:35] has passed from Death unto life now
[1:41:37] argue with him all the father has given
[1:41:39] me no man can come to me except the
[1:41:41] father draws him I'm quoting scripture
[1:41:44] all that comes no man can come to
[1:41:47] me except my father draws him first and
[1:41:51] all that my father has given me will
[1:41:53] come to me see and all that comes to me
[1:41:56] I'll give them everlasting life St John
[1:41:59] 6 and I will raise him up at the last
[1:42:03] days he says that's his words I think
[1:42:06] it's so important for us to remember
[1:42:08] brothers and sisters when when he has
[1:42:10] said these words they mean something the
[1:42:13] devil wants us to say well they were
[1:42:14] said for disciples somewhere or they
[1:42:16] were said for some Minister somewhere or
[1:42:18] they were said for someone else
[1:42:20] somewhere some other time no no they
[1:42:22] were said for you we have been given the
[1:42:24] ability to open the word of God to read
[1:42:26] the word of God to actually speak the
[1:42:29] word of God there's a reason for it it's
[1:42:31] so that that word can be ours today he
[1:42:33] wants to be ours today he doesn't want
[1:42:35] to be somewhere out there in the future
[1:42:37] doesn't want us to ignore him
[1:42:39] today so therefore leaving the
[1:42:42] principles of the doctrine of Christ
[1:42:44] let's go on to Perfection how many want
[1:42:47] to go on to Perfection am there's no
[1:42:49] human being here on Earth that's ever
[1:42:51] going to be able to be perfect even
[1:42:53] though some think they are even so
[1:42:56] though some actually feel like they are
[1:42:58] and I'll say this even though some
[1:43:00] actually look like they are brothers and
[1:43:01] sisters they're not perfect there's no
[1:43:04] human being
[1:43:05] perfect we're all born in sin shaped in
[1:43:08] iniquity come into this world speaking
[1:43:10] lies because of the Fall In the Garden
[1:43:12] of Eden there is no perfection in
[1:43:14] mankind but oh blessed be the name of
[1:43:17] the Lord one of these days real soon
[1:43:19] this Revelation is going to take over in
[1:43:21] the lives of the he Heavenly
[1:43:22] bridegroom's bride here on Earth that
[1:43:24] Revelation is going to take over in her
[1:43:26] life and what's going to happen it's
[1:43:28] going to break Eternal bright and fair
[1:43:30] and when that happens brothers and
[1:43:31] sisters we're going to go into a
[1:43:33] Thousand-Year Millennium and that is
[1:43:36] where we will actually pick up where
[1:43:38] Adam and Eve left off where we will get
[1:43:40] a new body and we will live in this
[1:43:42] world and we won't be subject to sin
[1:43:44] because sin will still be around but for
[1:43:47] a thousand years sin will be bound the
[1:43:49] devil will be bound by ch chains of
[1:43:51] circumstance and brother brandham says
[1:43:52] not by big logging chains or the chains
[1:43:54] that hold anchors on ships but it will
[1:43:56] be bound by the chains of circumstance
[1:43:59] whereby you are now very perfect in the
[1:44:01] body in which you live can you imagine
[1:44:04] how comfortable we'll feel in our skin
[1:44:06] there how many people feel comfortable
[1:44:08] in your skin here you don't have to
[1:44:10] raise hands but many times I know as
[1:44:12] humans we have complexes we've got
[1:44:15] things in our lives where we just don't
[1:44:16] feel
[1:44:17] comfortable but we're coming to a day
[1:44:19] brothers and sisters where we're going
[1:44:21] to be the most comfortable we've ever
[1:44:23] been it's going to be absolute comfort
[1:44:26] and joy because we will display that
[1:44:29] thousand years of life where Adam and
[1:44:31] Eve messed up but that's the Perfection
[1:44:33] that we're talking about going to right
[1:44:36] now in our flesh we don't feel it but
[1:44:38] his word says that we already are how
[1:44:41] could we ever get there if his word
[1:44:43] didn't say that we
[1:44:45] will we're coming to a
[1:44:48] place which now already is brothers and
[1:44:51] sisters where you're perfect but you're
[1:44:53] only perfect in Christ Jesus our
[1:44:56] brothers and our sisters are perfect and
[1:44:58] they're perfect in Christ
[1:45:00] Jesus and when we can look at one
[1:45:02] another and see Christ Jesus and say no
[1:45:04] I don't see my brother I know that maybe
[1:45:06] he he does that thing all the time and
[1:45:08] it just it causes me such anxiety or or
[1:45:13] anger or fear whatever it is we can say
[1:45:16] you know what I know that's just that
[1:45:18] hybrid condition from the Garden of Eden
[1:45:19] that brother didn't desire to have any
[1:45:21] of those attributes even though he's
[1:45:24] prickly like a
[1:45:25] cactus you know what there's coming a
[1:45:28] time where he's going to actually lose
[1:45:30] those prickles and the more that we
[1:45:33] actually look at our brothers and
[1:45:35] sisters through the lens of the word of
[1:45:37] God through his Spirit brothers and
[1:45:39] sisters what happens I'll tell you what
[1:45:41] happens the way to deal with that in our
[1:45:43] brother and our sister is not to look at
[1:45:45] them is to look in the mirror amen go
[1:45:49] and stand in in the mirror a and sing
[1:45:52] that song just like we sang this morning
[1:45:54] why would we sing that song just so we
[1:45:56] could have the rapture we need to learn
[1:45:58] how to live with ourselves
[1:46:00] here change my heart oh
[1:46:03] God make it ever
[1:46:06] true you know what happens when we
[1:46:08] really do make that change in our lives
[1:46:11] where we start to think differently we
[1:46:13] start to speak differently we we become
[1:46:15] a new creature in Christ Jesus what
[1:46:17] happens is the brothers and sisters that
[1:46:19] used to offend they don't change maybe
[1:46:22] they do maybe they don't but what
[1:46:24] happens is we
[1:46:25] change and the more we change the more
[1:46:28] everyone can change amen but it starts
[1:46:32] right here brothers and sisters we
[1:46:34] cannot be saying Lord bring on a trial
[1:46:37] for my brother I know that he's got this
[1:46:39] problem and Oh my he needs to get over
[1:46:41] it no Lord help me get over me because
[1:46:45] when I can get over me I'll be able to
[1:46:48] be like that one to say not spur here
[1:46:50] not spurt there come on boys we're going
[1:46:53] to go put out that fire and I'm going to
[1:46:55] show you
[1:46:58] how get the Holy Ghost amen then we'll
[1:47:01] stop worrying about all of this this
[1:47:03] religious Behavior where we can have
[1:47:06] works and and and and tenure and all of
[1:47:09] this religious stuff we need to lay
[1:47:12] aside all of that and get into Christ
[1:47:14] Jesus brothers and sisters and recognize
[1:47:16] that we need the new birth Brother
[1:47:19] bradam Talks about the New Birth is a
[1:47:21] messy deal amen and if we've never had
[1:47:24] that in our lives how do we know we've
[1:47:26] had it he says that you don't just go
[1:47:28] and have a baby one day and forget that
[1:47:30] you had a
[1:47:32] baby don't worry about what other people
[1:47:34] think worry about what he thinks have I
[1:47:37] got the Holy Ghost have I truly died out
[1:47:40] to myself has he truly introduced
[1:47:42] himself to me because when that happens
[1:47:45] we're not the same person that we ever
[1:47:47] used to be we're
[1:47:49] not you know I heard someone say it
[1:47:51] recently and I thought it was really
[1:47:53] powerful and this is to the the children
[1:47:56] who are raised in a message home or or
[1:47:58] people who are raised around a message
[1:48:00] culture we can have the idea and the
[1:48:04] understanding of what it means to to to
[1:48:06] to live in a message world and and to
[1:48:10] know that God sent a prophet and we can
[1:48:12] have all the quotes and understandings
[1:48:13] in our lives but what can happen is we
[1:48:16] actually fear the punishment and we
[1:48:18] haven't actually really had a new birth
[1:48:21] with Jesus Christ the only thing we do
[1:48:23] is we live our lives afraid of the
[1:48:25] punishment so we live good lives because
[1:48:27] out of out of fear we're going to be
[1:48:28] punished one day and we're going to go
[1:48:30] to hell that's not what Christ is
[1:48:31] looking for Christ is looking for us to
[1:48:33] die out to ourselves and to actually
[1:48:35] Bear our entire selves to him so that we
[1:48:38] can have a personal relationship amen
[1:48:41] and when that happens there's a new
[1:48:43] birth that that thing that overshadows
[1:48:45] us the Holy Ghost the the power of the
[1:48:48] highest when he comes on the scene
[1:48:50] brothers and sisters and overshadows us
[1:48:52] there is a new creature that starts to
[1:48:53] grow inside our spiritual womb and boy
[1:48:56] oh boy what it does is it leaps it it
[1:48:59] comes to life it starts to express
[1:49:01] itself through us and as it does we show
[1:49:04] the world around us that we're no longer
[1:49:06] the same creatures that we used to
[1:49:10] be excuse me questions and answers on
[1:49:13] the Holy
[1:49:16] Ghost talking about
[1:49:19] this is it is it possible for someone
[1:49:22] who was once
[1:49:24] enlightened who has tasted of the
[1:49:25] Heavenly gift I'm not reading I'm just
[1:49:27] reading the scripture here brother Logan
[1:49:29] is it possible I'm just saying this for
[1:49:32] someone who was once enlightened who has
[1:49:34] tasted of the Heavenly gift and were
[1:49:36] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[1:49:38] tasted the good word of God and the
[1:49:39] powers of the world to come if they
[1:49:41] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[1:49:43] repentance is it possible to do that
[1:49:47] that's the trick the devil plays on us
[1:49:49] to make us wonder is it possible because
[1:49:52] it's impossible it says the word of God
[1:49:54] says it's impossible for them to
[1:49:56] actually be renewed so what brother Bram
[1:49:58] he says is it sounds like you can have
[1:50:01] the Holy Ghost and then fall away and
[1:50:04] then once you do that what happens
[1:50:05] basically you blaspheme right at that
[1:50:07] point that's what it sounds
[1:50:09] like because we know there's only one
[1:50:11] unpardonable sin and that's blaspheming
[1:50:14] the Holy Ghost but it sounds like that's
[1:50:17] what could happen I love the way brother
[1:50:18] bradam deals with this he says and like
[1:50:20] I said last night when the Holy Ghost
[1:50:23] fell at
[1:50:24] Pentecost excuse me when they went down
[1:50:26] to the Jews acts
[1:50:30] 195 they had to lay hands on them that
[1:50:33] they receive it and when they went down
[1:50:35] to the Samaritans they had to lay hands
[1:50:37] on them but when they come to the
[1:50:39] Gentiles at cornelius's house while
[1:50:43] Peter yet spake these
[1:50:45] words no laying on of
[1:50:48] hands when when the little girl died
[1:50:51] gyrus his daughter the priest said come
[1:50:53] lay your hands on her and she'll live
[1:50:56] but when the Roman Centurian the Gentile
[1:51:00] said I'm not worthy you come under my
[1:51:02] roof and speak the word that's it
[1:51:06] amen syrop phenician Woman Greek
[1:51:10] actually what she was when Jesus said to
[1:51:13] her it's not me for to to for me to take
[1:51:15] the children's bread and give it to the
[1:51:18] dogs she said that's true Lord Lord but
[1:51:20] the dogs eat the crumbs from under the
[1:51:22] master's
[1:51:24] table he said for this saying the
[1:51:26] devil's left your daughter brother
[1:51:29] branam he says what say good things
[1:51:32] then say good
[1:51:35] things say something good about
[1:51:39] somebody talk about Jesus say something
[1:51:44] loyal something
[1:51:46] real that's the way to get rid of devils
[1:51:50] amen so I want to say this brothers and
[1:51:53] sisters as long as we're talking about
[1:51:55] someone as long as we're saying it and
[1:51:58] we know that it's not good it's in a
[1:51:59] negative context and maybe we're saying
[1:52:01] well let so that we can pray for them we
[1:52:03] want to be able to you know we can just
[1:52:05] say you know I want to pray for brother
[1:52:07] Emanuel I want to pray for brother Toby
[1:52:08] I want to pray for brother Peter we can
[1:52:10] say hey I've got unspoken requests God
[1:52:12] knows our heart we don't have to go and
[1:52:15] talk about a brother or a sister and
[1:52:16] plant those seeds of doubt now in their
[1:52:18] heart so that they can go and have those
[1:52:20] seeds of Doubt begin to grow no we got
[1:52:24] the prophet saying a real key here I
[1:52:26] think it's so important for us that's
[1:52:28] the way to get rid of devils say
[1:52:30] something loyal say something nice speak
[1:52:33] nice about our brothers and our sisters
[1:52:35] CU you know even as parents if we can go
[1:52:37] behind the bedroom door and close the
[1:52:38] door and and Whisper we can have
[1:52:40] Whispering discussion about our brother
[1:52:42] and sister and maybe slay them with our
[1:52:43] words in a whisper you know what our
[1:52:46] children are still falling under the
[1:52:48] spiritual leadership of of the home and
[1:52:50] if those devils are swirling in the home
[1:52:53] brothers and sisters don't think for a
[1:52:54] second the children are actually
[1:52:56] excluded from
[1:52:57] that maybe they can't hear our voice
[1:53:00] they don't have to because we're dealing
[1:53:02] with Devils it's a spiritual battle that
[1:53:05] we're fighting it's not principality
[1:53:07] it's not flesh that we're fighting we're
[1:53:08] not fighting our brothers and our
[1:53:10] sisters we're fighting principalities
[1:53:11] and
[1:53:12] Powers but hey if you want to know say
[1:53:15] something real that's the way to get rid
[1:53:18] of devils he never said he he he never
[1:53:21] prayed for the girl he never said one
[1:53:23] thing about her being
[1:53:25] healed did he he just said for this
[1:53:29] saying for this saying the devil's gone
[1:53:33] I just think this is so good then he
[1:53:35] goes on to say hady right the other day
[1:53:37] she didn't ask for nothing she was just
[1:53:39] sitting
[1:53:40] there but she said the right thing which
[1:53:43] pleased the Holy Spirit and the Holy
[1:53:45] Spirit spoke back and said Hade ask
[1:53:48] anything that you will whatever whatever
[1:53:50] you got and you want find out whether
[1:53:52] this is real or not ask
[1:53:54] anything the healing of the crippled
[1:53:56] sister sitting there all draw up 10
[1:53:58] $110,000 to keep her from digging on the
[1:54:01] Hills over there youth restored to her
[1:54:03] well- rundown body whatever you want ask
[1:54:07] you ask it right now if it don't come
[1:54:09] true and give it to you right now then
[1:54:11] I'm a false prophet that's it that's
[1:54:14] something isn't it say something nice
[1:54:17] brothers and
[1:54:18] sisters know I'm going to tell you I'm a
[1:54:21] witness to it in multiple
[1:54:25] occasions as a
[1:54:27] Believer where I would you know be a
[1:54:30] believer come to church and believe and
[1:54:33] go home and believe and live my life as
[1:54:35] a Believer and try and do my very best
[1:54:36] as a Believer truly but still have this
[1:54:39] thing where I would just say smack talk
[1:54:41] about a brother you know this brother
[1:54:42] talked to me like
[1:54:43] that the sister or whatever like all
[1:54:46] these different things and and it's just
[1:54:49] there in the background you just drag it
[1:54:50] around like a ball and chain in your
[1:54:52] life and it's there it's a prickly
[1:54:54] nature brothers and sisters it's not
[1:54:57] Christ but you know what I found is God
[1:55:00] allowed me to get to a place where I
[1:55:01] couldn't stand the prickles
[1:55:03] anymore and this is why I'm preaching it
[1:55:05] because I've experienced it and what
[1:55:07] happened was I started to look in the
[1:55:09] mirror I didn't start looking at
[1:55:11] someone's picture and and I'll say it
[1:55:14] clearly this was a business deal and the
[1:55:16] more I talk bad about the person that we
[1:55:19] had as a customer the worst things
[1:55:22] got and it was bad and I had every right
[1:55:25] to be able to say it because it was
[1:55:27] truth this person was terrible to me
[1:55:31] this person was terrible to my wife how
[1:55:33] many husbands out there enjoy seeing
[1:55:36] someone terrible to your
[1:55:38] wife none not one hand went up
[1:55:43] amen but it makes it worse right so we
[1:55:47] have the discussion and it gets worse
[1:55:49] and we talk mad and it's truth this is
[1:55:52] the way they're
[1:55:54] behaving and one time the Lord I believe
[1:55:56] just spoke to me and said enough you
[1:55:59] want to change the
[1:56:00] situation speak
[1:56:03] nice talk like a Believer amen don't
[1:56:07] pretend don't be a false pretending
[1:56:10] believer demonstrate that you're a
[1:56:12] Believer yes sir hallu and my wife and I
[1:56:16] had a conversation and we changed our
[1:56:18] attitude
[1:56:21] and times would come we would have the
[1:56:23] regular conversations we had a business
[1:56:26] we had lots of
[1:56:28] conversations it was funny because we
[1:56:30] didn't have many marital conversations
[1:56:32] but we sure had lots of business
[1:56:34] conversations but you know what happened
[1:56:36] was we would still talk but then
[1:56:38] something would say oh remember you're
[1:56:41] not going to do this
[1:56:42] anymore and and maybe I would start
[1:56:45] talking and she would say remember we're
[1:56:47] not going to do this anymore Hallelujah
[1:56:50] it didn't just happen and everything was
[1:56:52] Rosy it took
[1:56:54] effort it took stumbling and falling and
[1:56:57] getting back up and stumbling and
[1:56:58] falling and getting back up but it
[1:57:00] became quicker and quicker between the
[1:57:01] Cycles to the place where suddenly this
[1:57:04] this person started to become friendly
[1:57:06] again in the midst of a storm in the
[1:57:09] midst of a tornado they started to
[1:57:11] actually become kind amen hallelujah and
[1:57:15] we had to have a conversation at home to
[1:57:17] say Look What the Lord Has Done
[1:57:20] say nice
[1:57:23] things I applied it in a situation in
[1:57:26] the
[1:57:27] church believe me brothers and sisters
[1:57:30] it
[1:57:31] works and you know you might not say
[1:57:34] things but you think things remember the
[1:57:36] prophet said how loud are your thoughts
[1:57:37] in
[1:57:38] heaven how loud are our thoughts in
[1:57:40] heaven he knows everyone's thought right
[1:57:42] here right now they're louder than my
[1:57:45] voice over the system brothers and
[1:57:47] sisters what do we think about our
[1:57:49] brothers and
[1:57:51] sisters what do we think about our
[1:57:53] spouses when our spouses just kick us
[1:57:56] where it hurts because nobody knows us
[1:57:58] like our
[1:58:00] spouse it's the
[1:58:02] devil it's just the
[1:58:04] devil and he knows our prickly nature
[1:58:07] we've all got
[1:58:08] him but you know what when we can take
[1:58:11] that thought into captivity after we've
[1:58:12] been prickled right in our heart right
[1:58:15] in our most innermost part where we feel
[1:58:17] like that was a low blow when when we
[1:58:20] can take that prickle into our heart and
[1:58:22] take that thought as a prickle and say
[1:58:24] you know what I'm taking that into
[1:58:25] captivity Lord and I'm going to trust
[1:58:27] you because that's what your word says
[1:58:28] now Lord I'm actually going to speak the
[1:58:30] word and trust that you'll come on the
[1:58:32] scene because I'm going to behave like
[1:58:33] that Christian I'm going to behave like
[1:58:35] a message believer I'm going to behave
[1:58:37] like someone who is filled with the Holy
[1:58:39] Ghost that Paul preached that's the
[1:58:41] person that I'm going to be and now I'm
[1:58:42] going to take that thought into
[1:58:44] captivity and I'm going to trust you
[1:58:45] Lord to change my heart in the situation
[1:58:49] and when that happens brothers and
[1:58:50] sisters I promise you that person will
[1:58:53] actually feel the impact of it the
[1:58:55] person that caused the impact that that
[1:58:57] inflicted the pain they will begin to
[1:58:59] feel it because now the person who would
[1:59:01] normally kick back who would normally
[1:59:03] punch back who would normally speak or
[1:59:05] yell back that person is actually
[1:59:08] changing it they're taking that and
[1:59:09] they're giving it to God and you know in
[1:59:12] in the case of a marriage we don't want
[1:59:13] to Heap coals fiery coals on the on the
[1:59:15] head of our spouse but that's what the
[1:59:17] word of God says if we're willing to
[1:59:18] give it over to God when our enemies
[1:59:19] come against us if we just follow the
[1:59:21] word of God what happens is they Heap
[1:59:24] coals of fire onto themselves right so
[1:59:27] when we take those thoughts from those
[1:59:29] words from those situations that happen
[1:59:30] in our lives and we just commit it to
[1:59:32] God and say Lord oh help me I love this
[1:59:36] person because we want to say I hate
[1:59:38] this person just be honest brothers and
[1:59:40] sisters there's times where we want to
[1:59:42] say that and that's the devil nature
[1:59:45] that's the hybrid condition from the
[1:59:47] Garden of Eden we all have it but when
[1:59:49] we stop saying that when we stop
[1:59:51] thinking that and we say no I don't want
[1:59:53] to do that anymore I want to have the
[1:59:55] mind of Christ Living out through me
[1:59:57] because I am a believer we can change
[2:00:00] that
[2:00:03] person we have the ability to make
[2:00:05] changes in our lives Hallelujah if you
[2:00:08] want to as Believers of this word
[2:00:11] remember we've all heard it before
[2:00:14] you've got the checkbook brother bradam
[2:00:16] he said it what is it the the the
[2:00:18] fundamentals the penny cost I'm going to
[2:00:19] get it mixed up one has the checkbook
[2:00:21] right and the other one has the bank
[2:00:23] account and one can say oh I've got all
[2:00:26] the money look at all the money that's
[2:00:27] here and the other one says yeah but
[2:00:29] I've got the checks look at the checks
[2:00:30] here but he says if you could ever get
[2:00:32] those two to come together if you could
[2:00:35] ever get that together what would happen
[2:00:37] you'd be able to write a check for
[2:00:39] whatever you want and know that you
[2:00:40] don't have to back it that he's already
[2:00:42] got it backed up brothers and
[2:00:44] sisters we have the ability to make
[2:00:46] change if we want it but remember what I
[2:00:49] I said earlier you got to want it and
[2:00:50] you really got to want it the devil
[2:00:53] knows when you're pretending the devil
[2:00:55] doesn't even know when you're serious
[2:00:57] because he's so used to our nature he
[2:00:58] thinks that it's so easy to manipulate
[2:01:00] us and slap us around spiritually but
[2:01:03] when we surrender Our Lives to
[2:01:05] Christ God
[2:01:07] knows and that's when he comes on the
[2:01:09] scene in our lives and that's where the
[2:01:12] devil starts to get a little bit
[2:01:13] shaky so don't think it strange when you
[2:01:16] start to see fiery trials in your lives
[2:01:19] when we see them in our lives our trials
[2:01:21] are worth more to us than precious gold
[2:01:24] tried in the
[2:01:25] fire so when we have a situation in our
[2:01:28] lives that we just can't overcome
[2:01:30] brothers and sisters There's an
[2:01:31] opportunity to just take that thought
[2:01:33] into captivity take that word into
[2:01:36] captivity we know there's Proverbs that
[2:01:38] speak about it as well right be be slow
[2:01:41] to speak and quick to think quick to
[2:01:44] hear rather that's the scripture be slow
[2:01:46] to speak and quick to hear you know a a
[2:01:49] soft answer does what it turns away
[2:01:53] wrath we have the ability to make an
[2:01:55] impact in our lives and it can be at
[2:01:57] work it can be at home it can be at
[2:01:59] church it can be anywhere we are we have
[2:02:01] the ability to change lives did you ever
[2:02:05] think that you could manipulate for lack
[2:02:07] of a better word you could manipulate
[2:02:08] someone else's
[2:02:10] life I I don't mean that in a negative
[2:02:12] way I mean that in a spiritually
[2:02:14] positive way you could manipulate
[2:02:16] someone unto
[2:02:17] Christ
[2:02:20] it's a stretch I know but you have the
[2:02:22] ability to do that but if we live our
[2:02:24] lives as as partial Believers where
[2:02:27] people see a half witness of Our Lives
[2:02:30] what are they going to think about us
[2:02:32] but if we always live the life of Jesus
[2:02:34] Christ even to a fault in front of our
[2:02:36] brothers and our sisters and the people
[2:02:38] that we work with the people we interact
[2:02:39] with in our lives if we always do that
[2:02:41] what's going to happen is they're going
[2:02:43] to see a witness they're going to see a
[2:02:45] real life being
[2:02:46] lived especially when we can admit that
[2:02:49] were're
[2:02:49] wrong amen totally went off Offroad here
[2:02:55] brother Ram says find out whether this
[2:02:57] is real or not ask anything the healing
[2:03:00] of her little crippled sister setting
[2:03:01] there all dra up $10,000 to keep her
[2:03:04] from digging on them Hills over there
[2:03:06] the youth restored to her rundown body
[2:03:08] whatever you want to ask you ask it now
[2:03:12] if it don't come and give you the right
[2:03:15] now then I'm a false prophet that's
[2:03:17] something isn't it
[2:03:20] Jesus said say to this
[2:03:23] mountain and you've heard about what's
[2:03:26] been taking
[2:03:27] place that's the ministry that we're
[2:03:30] entering into amen we're way up the road
[2:03:34] now soon the coming of the Lord Jesus
[2:03:37] and we've got to have rapturing faith in
[2:03:39] a church that can be changed in the
[2:03:42] moment in the twinkling of an
[2:03:45] eye to go out or will not go out
[2:03:50] but I just love how he underpins it he
[2:03:51] says don't but don't worry it'll be
[2:03:54] there don't worry brothers and sisters
[2:03:56] it'll be there it it'll be there and and
[2:03:58] when the power of this church Rises
[2:04:01] it'll bring its
[2:04:03] Brethren isn't that beautiful the power
[2:04:06] that that church Rises will bring its
[2:04:10] Brethren the power of that church will
[2:04:13] bring the other Brethren and there will
[2:04:15] be a general resurrection and we're
[2:04:18] looking forward to it am
[2:04:21] amen brothers and sisters I just think
[2:04:23] it's so beautiful because that
[2:04:25] resurrection and Rapture is happening
[2:04:27] right now what it is is the dynamic
[2:04:30] power of Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:04:33] today and forever coming into the
[2:04:35] mechanics of the church and outside of a
[2:04:37] dispensational prophet wrapping up all
[2:04:39] the Loose Ends and taking the faith of
[2:04:42] the children and restoring it back to
[2:04:44] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers
[2:04:46] outside of that happening it's it's
[2:04:48] probably not not going to happen but
[2:04:50] here we are it's already happened we can
[2:04:53] say praise the lord we already have that
[2:04:55] in our lives brother Bram please explain
[2:04:58] Hebrews
[2:05:01] 64-6 brother Bram in paragraph 162 he
[2:05:03] says now this is a real sticker see now
[2:05:06] you have to watch now remember we
[2:05:07] believe and teach at this church that
[2:05:10] not everything comes up and shouts
[2:05:11] everything that speaks in tongues
[2:05:12] everything that shake hands with the
[2:05:14] preacher has got eternal life but we got
[2:05:17] believe if you got eternal life if God
[2:05:20] has given you eternal life you've got it
[2:05:21] forever see because look if it didn't
[2:05:24] Jesus is found a false teacher in St
[2:05:26] John 5:24 he said he that heareth my
[2:05:29] words and believeth on him that sent me
[2:05:30] hath everlasting life and shall never
[2:05:32] come into the Judgment but has passed
[2:05:34] from Death unto life now argue with him
[2:05:36] all the father has given me no man can
[2:05:39] come to me except the father draws him
[2:05:41] I'm quoting scripture I'm quoting
[2:05:42] brother Bram all that comes no man can
[2:05:44] come to me except the father draws him
[2:05:46] first and all the father has given me
[2:05:49] will come to me see and all that comes
[2:05:51] to me I'll give them everlasting life St
[2:05:54] John 6 and will raise him up at the last
[2:05:57] days that's his words amen I know I read
[2:06:01] that twice I just wanted to emphasize it
[2:06:04] it's so important for us to recognize if
[2:06:06] he's called us he's made a provision for
[2:06:08] us and not one of his will be lost not
[2:06:11] one of his will be lost brothers and
[2:06:13] sisters amen and and you know I could
[2:06:16] just do the punchline right now if if
[2:06:18] you have tasted of the Heavenly gift if
[2:06:21] you have been once enlightened then you
[2:06:24] can't fall away it's impossible for you
[2:06:27] to fall away it's the people that
[2:06:31] actually were borderline Believers those
[2:06:34] are the ones that are being spoken about
[2:06:36] in this scripture here and there's a
[2:06:37] very clear distinction that I think I
[2:06:39] really want to drill down into and we're
[2:06:42] going to have to a lot next week or the
[2:06:44] next time we gather Lord willing we
[2:06:47] still have some time here so so we're
[2:06:48] going to carry on a little bit on
[2:06:50] questions and answers in the Holy Ghost
[2:06:52] paragraph 163 now look if I want to go
[2:06:55] back to Ephesians the first chapter Paul
[2:06:59] preaching now the
[2:07:02] Corinthians each one had a tongue and a
[2:07:05] Psalm you notice the other churches
[2:07:08] didn't have that trouble he never said
[2:07:11] nothing about it did he ever mention
[2:07:13] tongues anywhere in the Ephesian Church
[2:07:17] the Roman Church
[2:07:19] no I found this to be really
[2:07:22] interesting very interesting to think
[2:07:24] about it and and why is that it's
[2:07:27] because those churches were set in order
[2:07:30] they understood the word of God for
[2:07:32] their day it was the Corinthian Church
[2:07:34] that was mixed up and muddled up and had
[2:07:36] sin in the church and was busy doing
[2:07:39] their own things mixing mingling things
[2:07:41] with the word of God for their day but
[2:07:43] we know that Paul came to actually
[2:07:45] correct them and he wasn't shy about it
[2:07:48] he was pretty sharp he was pretty
[2:07:49] straight with the Corinthian Church
[2:07:51] setting them in order paragraph 164
[2:07:54] brother Brown goes on to say and you say
[2:07:55] well what about the Pentecostals with
[2:07:57] the tongues then brother
[2:07:59] brandom I think they got the Holy Ghost
[2:08:02] he says sure they did all right why look
[2:08:06] you believe he's a good man Thomas said
[2:08:09] one time you know
[2:08:11] Lord I'm not going to continue reading
[2:08:13] it I'm going to jump down another little
[2:08:15] bit there but we'll just talk about
[2:08:16] Thomas for a second we know that he was
[2:08:18] was one of the 12 he was numbered with
[2:08:20] the apostles he never really did
[2:08:22] anything too terrible he wasn't Judas he
[2:08:25] he wasn't the son of predition but we
[2:08:26] know Thomas he was a doubter and he said
[2:08:29] the only way that I'll believe is if I
[2:08:31] can see the proof if I can see the
[2:08:33] evidence but we know Jesus said to him
[2:08:36] you know Thomas here's my side here's my
[2:08:38] hands come feel touch you can actually
[2:08:42] be that witness that you need to be to
[2:08:43] be able to believe and now you're a
[2:08:45] Believer aren't you Thomas because what
[2:08:47] you spoke is what you need to believe
[2:08:49] now it's manifest in front of you and
[2:08:51] now you can believe with all your heart
[2:08:53] and sure enough he did because he did
[2:08:55] that and said my Lord my God he cried
[2:08:58] before Jesus once he recognized how
[2:08:59] wrong he was for having that attitude
[2:09:02] but you know what pushed that aside it's
[2:09:04] interesting because there's people who
[2:09:07] are that way today that say unless I see
[2:09:10] a sign or a Wonder then I'm not going to
[2:09:12] believe brothers and sisters you're not
[2:09:14] going to believe if that's all you're
[2:09:15] looking
[2:09:16] for it'll never happen sir what you need
[2:09:20] to do is look to Christ don't look for a
[2:09:24] sign or a Wonder get the Holy Ghost in
[2:09:27] your
[2:09:27] life paragraph 165 he said yes Thomas
[2:09:31] after you've seen me and felt me and put
[2:09:33] my hand in your side hands in my side
[2:09:35] you believe but how much greater is
[2:09:38] their reward who have never seen and yet
[2:09:43] believe how many of us were with William
[2:09:46] Mariam Bram in his message message uh
[2:09:49] messages the sermons that he preached I
[2:09:51] don't know if anybody was but something
[2:09:54] inside of us gives us the ability to
[2:09:56] believe amen and it's not because we can
[2:10:00] say he was a good man it's not because
[2:10:02] that we can say he had the gift of
[2:10:04] healing in his life that he had the gift
[2:10:06] of discernment in his life we recognize
[2:10:09] by faith that that was the appearing of
[2:10:12] Jesus Christ back on Earth again because
[2:10:15] no man could perform those things
[2:10:19] he says how much greater is their reward
[2:10:21] who never had seen and yet believe he's
[2:10:23] a good God he gives you the desire of
[2:10:25] your heart of course he says let's just
[2:10:28] believe him and that's the death stroke
[2:10:31] to Satan when a man takes God at his
[2:10:34] word brother when a man takes God at his
[2:10:38] word that'll kill Satan every
[2:10:40] time that's the hardest hitting that
[2:10:43] Satan can get when a man will take God
[2:10:47] at his word yes sir to me that is just
[2:10:51] powerful that is astounding that is
[2:10:53] amazing to think that there is a death
[2:10:56] stroke for Satan and that's really where
[2:10:59] it comes down to where he will just want
[2:11:01] nothing to do with you he he won't want
[2:11:03] to mess with you because he knows he's
[2:11:05] not messing with you brothers and
[2:11:07] sisters that's the key he's not going to
[2:11:08] be messing with you he's going to be
[2:11:09] messing with Christ when Christ the Holy
[2:11:12] Ghost is living out through you but if
[2:11:15] it's you and Christ right
[2:11:18] the devil's going to come around and
[2:11:20] harass you and God will allow it God
[2:11:23] will allow those trials to come your way
[2:11:25] until you will overcome
[2:11:27] them so here we have brother Bram he's
[2:11:30] going on he says leaving the principles
[2:11:31] of the doctrine of Christ let us go on
[2:11:33] to
[2:11:35] Perfection now he's been out talking to
[2:11:38] them about the doctrines let's go and
[2:11:42] talk about the perfected things
[2:11:45] now you are perfected in God when you're
[2:11:50] sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day
[2:11:53] of your
[2:11:54] Redemption he that's born of God first
[2:11:57] John does not commit sin for he cannot
[2:12:00] sin for the seed of God remains in
[2:12:03] him when you are sealed into the Holy
[2:12:07] Ghost the Holy Ghost is sealed into you
[2:12:09] you cannot sin brothers and
[2:12:11] sisters and you
[2:12:13] know I'm probably not going to go too
[2:12:16] much further with it today I just think
[2:12:18] it's so important for us to
[2:12:21] recognize where we are today
[2:12:26] amen it's such an important
[2:12:29] thing to recognize that when you've been
[2:12:32] sealed by the Holy Ghost brothers and
[2:12:34] sisters you can't actually be unsealed
[2:12:36] by the Holy Ghost it's the devil that
[2:12:38] comes around to try and make us believe
[2:12:40] that
[2:12:44] Amen brother bradam I'm just going to
[2:12:46] read in paragraph 168 for the next few
[2:12:49] minutes I'll call the
[2:12:50] musicians brother Bram he says a man
[2:12:52] that's filled with the Holy Ghost not
[2:12:55] thinks he's
[2:12:57] filled but that he's born with the
[2:12:59] spirit of God does not commit sin for
[2:13:02] the seed of God is in him and he cannot
[2:13:06] sin
[2:13:07] see that is a real difficult thing to
[2:13:10] think about but remember what is sin
[2:13:11] brothers and sisters it's
[2:13:14] unbelief it's not believing the word of
[2:13:17] God it's not believing all the way unto
[2:13:20] adoption it's not believing all the way
[2:13:22] unto Perfection recognizing that we have
[2:13:24] nothing on our own in this flesh in this
[2:13:27] world that we see all that we can
[2:13:29] perceive with our our five outer senses
[2:13:31] and our five inner senses there's
[2:13:33] there's nothing that we can perceive
[2:13:35] that's going to actually do it for us
[2:13:36] the only thing that's going to do it is
[2:13:38] Faith and we know brother Brown Andi
[2:13:40] calls that a six sense that's that's a
[2:13:42] god sense that's something that he gives
[2:13:44] us because it's only by faith that we're
[2:13:47] saved he says the spirit of God he
[2:13:49] that's born of the spirit of God does
[2:13:50] not commit sin for the seed of God is in
[2:13:52] him and he cannot sin see does the bible
[2:13:55] say that so there it is you are not what
[2:13:58] you
[2:13:59] do what is what not what the world
[2:14:02] thinks of you it's what God thinks of
[2:14:05] you see you cannot how can I have an
[2:14:10] order written by the mayor of the city
[2:14:12] that I can run 40 miles an hour through
[2:14:14] the city and any policeman arrest me I
[2:14:17] can't
[2:14:19] how can I sin when there's a blood
[2:14:21] offering before God constantly where he
[2:14:25] can't even see
[2:14:28] me he can't even see maybe stand with me
[2:14:32] as we close today he says when there's a
[2:14:37] bumper before me and God a shield of
[2:14:41] blood for we are dead and our life is
[2:14:44] hid in Christ through God sealed by the
[2:14:47] Holy
[2:14:48] Ghost how in the world can you do
[2:14:51] anything wrong in the sight of God if we
[2:14:55] sin willfully in Hebrews 10 after we
[2:14:58] receive the knowledge of the truth
[2:15:00] there's no more sacrifice for
[2:15:03] sin in here it's impossible see to sin
[2:15:08] willfully I'm going to stop there and we
[2:15:12] will continue
[2:15:14] on next
[2:15:16] time with 169 I hope this is okay I just
[2:15:20] think it's so important brothers and
[2:15:22] sisters we need to recognize what is the
[2:15:25] Holy Ghost what the Holy Ghost was given
[2:15:27] for and to recognize that if you've ever
[2:15:29] been sealed with the Holy Ghost you can
[2:15:30] never ever be
[2:15:32] unsealed because if you've been sealed
[2:15:34] by the Holy Ghost your gods and he has
[2:15:36] claimed you for his own and that's
[2:15:38] forever there's no getting away even if
[2:15:41] we want to let's just bow in prayer
[2:15:44] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we
[2:15:47] thank you
[2:15:48] for your goodness and your mercy to us
[2:15:50] today Lord we thank you Father that we
[2:15:52] can truly have the baptism of your Holy
[2:15:56] Spirit Lord and we can have the true
[2:15:58] markers to show us whether we do or we
[2:16:01] don't and father when we do we know that
[2:16:04] we will always always always line up
[2:16:08] with your
[2:16:09] word and when we don't we'll have an
[2:16:12] excuse but we know that your Prophet
[2:16:14] said there's no excuses there's no
[2:16:17] excuses allow there's no excuses there's
[2:16:19] no exclusions we all come the same exact
[2:16:23] way we have to die out to ourselves and
[2:16:26] father this morning I pray that we could
[2:16:27] all just di out to ourselves fresh once
[2:16:30] again father if there's anyone here that
[2:16:32] needs the baptism of your Holy Spirit
[2:16:34] that's never experienced the true New
[2:16:36] Birth then father I pray that Lord today
[2:16:39] would be the day and father if any of us
[2:16:41] need to have a refilling of your spirit
[2:16:43] in our lives Lord maybe we've let our
[2:16:46] our our lights go dim father maybe we've
[2:16:48] let the the the the the bars down and
[2:16:52] the goats of God in Lord Jesus father
[2:16:55] Lord I pray for each life Lord who would
[2:16:57] desire to consecrate themselves in a
