[30:06] like you
[30:12] know
[30:15] [Music]
[30:20] All right. Pray for us this morning.
[30:35] Let's bow our head for a word of prayer.
[30:39] Precious heavenly father,
[30:43] you are indeed
[30:45] deserving all the glory
[30:48] and all the honor, Father God, for there
[30:52] is no one else like you.
[30:55] We can look
[30:58] everywhere, Father God,
[31:00] not one thing.
[31:04] Even creation itself
[31:07] cannot
[31:08] compared to you
[31:10] &gt;&gt; because you are the master of creation.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Father Lord, this morning
[31:17] we've come to you today, Lord.
[31:22] As I was in my way coming to the church,
[31:27] I said, Lord, I'm coming today.
[31:31] I need a word.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; That is my expectation. I don't know
[31:37] what word you are going to send to me,
[31:39] but I I request it, Lord.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; I need a word.
[31:44] Maybe somebody here needs a word. Even
[31:48] the one that is coming for the God
[31:51] without expectation,
[31:54] you are the God that can meet the
[31:56] expectation.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, Father,
[32:01] sometime Lord, we do not understand
[32:07] Why we are coming?
[32:09] Because as the trials in this life
[32:12] coming our way, we ask so many questions
[32:16] and sometime your silence
[32:20] can be frustrating.
[32:23] Father, Lord,
[32:26] despise our s your silence, Father God,
[32:29] I believe you can still lead us, Lord.
[32:35] Despis in of our confusions, Father God,
[32:38] I believe, Lord, you can still teach us,
[32:42] Lord Jesus Christ.
[32:44] Father, thank you so much for the
[32:47] opportunity once again to see the day.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; It's a blessing to make a difference in
[32:53] your kingdom, Father God. As we are
[32:56] still breathing, Father God, we still
[32:58] have an opportunity regardless of what
[33:00] is happening over our lives Lord Jesus
[33:02] Christ to prove ourself that we love you
[33:06] beyond everything
[33:08] that this world can offer Lord. Father,
[33:12] there are so many things that the world
[33:13] offering to us Lord Jesus Christ,
[33:16] but we choose to love you
[33:19] &gt;&gt; beyond our knowledge, beyond
[33:23] certificate, beyond wealth, beyond goal
[33:27] because those cannot compare to what you
[33:30] have for us when we cross on the other
[33:32] side, Lord. Father, there is somebody
[33:35] here, Father God, that is expecting
[33:38] something from you. I don't know. Father
[33:40] God, may you meet that needs, Father
[33:42] God.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ, I believe we are
[33:48] coming here, Father God, because
[33:51] we want to offer our ourselves to you
[33:55] because that's all we have. We cannot
[33:58] offer something that is greater than
[34:00] ourselves, Lord Jesus Christ. Our soul
[34:04] must be rendered to you back, Lord Jesus
[34:07] Christ.
[34:08] Father I pray father God that you meet
[34:12] and touch somebody that is need healing
[34:15] to his body or her body lord Jesus
[34:17] Christ.
[34:19] Lord bless the service, Father God. The
[34:22] message that is going to preach, Father
[34:24] God, may it be a message that we've
[34:26] never heard before, Father God, that can
[34:28] transform and change the life that needs
[34:32] to be transformed. There are somebody
[34:34] that is about to backsliding, Father
[34:37] God, because of the trial, tribulations,
[34:40] and persecutions. Father God,
[34:43] may we say like Paul Jesus this morning.
[34:46] Father God, we take pleasure in
[34:49] tribulation, pleasure in pain, pleasure
[34:52] in suffering, pleasure in hardship
[34:56] because when we are weak, that's when we
[34:58] are strong.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Because your power is made perfect in
[35:04] the time of weaknesses, Lord Jesus
[35:06] Christ.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, bless the service. Bless the
[35:11] musician. Bless every single thing,
[35:13] every single aspect of this service.
[35:15] Father God, even those that are not here
[35:18] this morning, Father God, I believe you
[35:21] are not bound by time or space. Father
[35:23] God, go wherever they are and meet them
[35:27] and touch them because to your name
[35:30] belong all the glory, all the praises.
[35:33] Please forgive me, Father God, for
[35:34] anything that I should have said that I
[35:37] don't remember. and forgive everything
[35:41] Father God that I said that I should not
[35:43] have said Father God and may this prayer
[35:46] reach your throne and you answer it
[35:48] powerfully for in Jesus muchless name we
[35:51] pray somebody say
[35:57] &gt;&gt; thank you my brother maybe shake
[35:59] someone's hand as you're seated this
[36:00] morning might not be somebody you know

[46:58] God bless you saints. Uh before we take
[47:01] the offering we have few announcements
[47:03] here. I think we have two of them here.
[47:05] There was supposed to be a padlock 27th
[47:08] of July, but it's been moved to 31st
[47:11] August.
[47:24] So the next pock is happening, but the
[47:26] next one has been moved to uh Boness
[47:29] Park. And then we have also the youth
[47:33] gathering in the Clawson's house,
[47:35] brother uh brother Joe and sister uh
[47:37] Crystal's house on the 20th of July.
[47:41] Let's bow our heart for prayer.
[47:44] Our precious heavenly father, Lord, once
[47:47] again your children have gathered here
[47:50] together in your name. Father, we've
[47:52] come with our sacrifices. We've come
[47:55] with our praises this morning. Father
[47:58] coming here defying gravity raising our
[48:01] voices raising our hands to worship you.
[48:05] Father we've known what you have done.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; You are the best architect that we know
[48:12] when we did not know who we were. But
[48:16] here you are. This is what you have
[48:19] done. You call us from all walks of
[48:22] life. You call us all when we were doing
[48:26] our own thing and you have put us
[48:28] together in one room this morning. In
[48:31] all over the world, people have gathered
[48:34] in your name.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Father, we want to praise you this
[48:37] morning. We want to leave whatever we're
[48:40] going to do this afternoon aside and
[48:42] worship you this morning. Father, not
[48:45] everybody have this opportunity to come
[48:48] before you this morning. Here we are
[48:51] with the liberty
[48:54] to worship you this morning. People have
[48:57] traveled from many distances. They could
[49:00] have been at the Stampede Park. They
[49:02] would have been at any places that they
[49:04] chose. But this morning, they know the
[49:07] king is going to be here.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; And they have come to meet him. Lord,
[49:11] may you bless your children. Father, as
[49:14] we've come,
[49:16] we never meet without a problem. We
[49:18] never meet without a need. And this
[49:21] morning, may you move from person to
[49:24] person, from peel to pew and meet the
[49:27] needs that are not known. As our brother
[49:30] said, when he was coming, said, "Lord,
[49:33] speak to me." That should be our prayer
[49:36] this morning. Father, we don't want to
[49:38] come and have a church experience, but
[49:40] we want to come and meet our needs,
[49:43] Lord. We will be careful to come back
[49:46] and give you thanks, Lord. Once again,
[49:49] Father, our pastor has traveled. We pray
[49:52] for brother Barry that you be with him,
[49:54] Lord. Use him wherever he has he is at
[49:58] this moment, Lord. And the brother that
[50:00] is going to stand behind here, Lord,
[50:02] brother Dawn, would you help our brother
[50:05] as he prepares to bring your word?
[50:08] Father, this morning we are bringing our
[50:11] tithes and offering and we ask you to
[50:13] bless it for in Jesus name that we pray.
[50:16] Amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Just the first verse this morning. Great
[50:27] is thy faithfulness,
[50:31] oh God, my father.
[50:37] There is no shadow,
[50:40] no one turning with thee.
[50:46] Oh, thou changeest not
[50:50] thy compassions
[50:53] they fail not.
[50:56] As thou hast been, thou forever
[51:02] will be. Oh yes, great is thy
[51:08] faithfulness.
[51:10] Oh, great is thy faithfulness.
[51:15] Morning
[51:17] by morning,
[51:19] new mercies
[51:21] I see.
[51:25] All I have needed
[51:28] thy hand and proided.
[51:34] Great is thy faithfulness,
[51:39] Lord.
[51:43] We have your seats this morning. Got a
[51:45] couple of specials this morning. Sister
[51:47] Amy, I believe, wherever you're at. God
[51:49] bless you. Would you come? And then I
[51:51] don't know the other sister, Sister uh
[51:53] Whitmer.
[51:55] if you'd come right after that. We'll
[51:57] let these sisters bring a special this
[51:59] morning. Bless you.

[58:57] I'll praise when I'm sure,
[59:01] praise when I'm doubted.
[59:03] [Music]
[59:06] I'll praise when outnumbered.
[59:10] Praise when surrounded.
[59:15] Cuz praise is the waters
[59:18] my enemies drowning.
[59:24] As long as I'm breathing, I've got a
[59:28] reason to praise
[59:32] the Lord, oh my soul.
[59:37] Praise
[59:41] the Lord, oh my soul.
[59:46] I'll praise when I feel it.
[59:49] Praise when I don't.
[59:52] Oh,
[59:55] grace cuz I know
[59:58] you're still in control.
[1:00:03] My grace is awakened.
[1:00:07] It's more than a sound.
[1:00:12] My grace is the share
[1:00:16] it goes down.
[1:00:18] [Music]
[1:00:21] As long as I'm breathing, I've got a
[1:00:25] reason to praise
[1:00:29] the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:00:34] Praise
[1:00:38] the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:00:42] Oh, I won't be quiet. My God is alive.
[1:00:47] How could I keep it inside?
[1:00:51] Oh, I won't be crying. My God is alive.
[1:00:56] How could I keep it inside?
[1:00:59] I've got to praise
[1:01:04] the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:01:08] [Music]
[1:01:17] Praise cuz you saw it. I'll praise cuz
[1:01:20] you reign. I'll praise cuz you rose and
[1:01:24] defeated the grave. I'll praise cuz
[1:01:27] you're faithful. Praise cuz you're true.
[1:01:30] I'll praise cuz there's nobody greater
[1:01:33] than you. I'll praise cuz you're
[1:01:36] sovereign. Praise cuz you reign. Praise
[1:01:39] cuz you rose and defeated in the grave.
[1:01:43] I'll praise cuz you're faithful. Praise
[1:01:46] cuz you're true. Praise cuz there's
[1:01:49] nobody greater than you. Praise
[1:01:56] Lord. Oh my soul.
[1:02:00] Oh praise
[1:02:05] Lord. Oh my soul.
[1:02:08] I've got a praise.
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:14] Oh my soul.
[1:02:17] Oh, I won't be quiet. My God is alive.
[1:02:22] How could I keep it inside?
[1:02:26] I won't be quiet. My God is alive. How
[1:02:31] could I keep it inside?
[1:02:35] Praise
[1:02:38] the Lord. Oh my soul.
[1:02:43] Praise
[1:02:47] the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:02:53] [Applause]
[1:03:02] Amen. Thank you for both those specials
[1:03:04] this morning. Stand with me if you
[1:03:05] would. This wonderful reminders.
[1:03:08] It's wonderful to praise the Lord this
[1:03:10] morning. I'm just going to ask brother
[1:03:11] Don if he'd come at this time. Some of
[1:03:13] you may not know brother Don's
[1:03:15] testimony. It's a very wonderful
[1:03:17] testimony
[1:03:19] and just thank you the Lord for his life
[1:03:21] this this week is thinking about him
[1:03:23] coming and bringing a word of
[1:03:24] exhortation this morning. I don't know
[1:03:26] if he calls himself a preacher but he
[1:03:27] certainly has a gift of poetry. We've
[1:03:30] been blessed in this assembly by
[1:03:31] countless poems. I don't know how many
[1:03:33] that he's written and they're just all
[1:03:35] mini sermonets in themselves. So looking
[1:03:38] forward to what God has in store through
[1:03:39] our brother, but just want to invite him
[1:03:41] as we sing this this morning. Pass me
[1:03:43] not. I think that's our prayer this
[1:03:45] morning. Isn't it? We don't want the
[1:03:47] Lord to pass us by. As our brother
[1:03:49] prayed, what Mario prayed, each of us
[1:03:51] can get one little one little cell, one
[1:03:54] little word cell that that builds this
[1:03:56] holy this this this holy faith, just one
[1:03:58] more notch this morning. That's what
[1:04:00] we're after this morning. Let's sing it.
[1:04:02] Pass me not prayerfully to the Lord as
[1:04:04] brother Don comes.
[1:04:06] Oh pass
[1:04:09] we must. Oh gentle.
[1:04:19] Oh he
[1:04:22] my
[1:04:26] cry.
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:32] Oh my.
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:35] Oh,
[1:04:39] [Music]
[1:04:44] to do
[1:04:47] not pass.
[1:04:51] [Music]
[1:04:55] Oh,
[1:04:57] [Music]
[1:05:03] Heat. Heat.
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:20] Oh
[1:05:22] [Music]
[1:05:27] my god.
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:39] One more time. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:05:43] [Applause]
[1:05:44] [Music]
[1:05:51] Yeah.
[1:05:54] Heat.
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:06:06] Oh my
[1:06:09] god.
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Bless you all.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Preach in the name of the Lord. Let's
[1:06:36] just go to a word of prayer. If you have
[1:06:38] any needs in your life, your heart,
[1:06:40] whether they're personal or for someone
[1:06:42] else that you know, let's just lift them
[1:06:44] up before the Lord. And once again, God
[1:06:47] will prove himself.
[1:06:51] Gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; we've gathered, Father, in your name,
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; as you told us and taught us, Father,
[1:07:01] through your Bible, through the revealed
[1:07:03] word of this day, through the prophet,
[1:07:05] Father, Lord, and we believe, Father,
[1:07:09] we believe your way of doing things,
[1:07:10] Father.
[1:07:12] Father, sometimes it seems strange and
[1:07:14] Lord, why you would choose man and the
[1:07:16] foolishness of preaching, Father. Lord,
[1:07:19] but it's your chosen way, Father.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, as we stand here as a unified
[1:07:24] body, Father, we've sung the songs,
[1:07:26] Lord. We've tilled our hearts, Father.
[1:07:28] Lord, we've given you worship and open
[1:07:29] ourselves up, Father. And we just want
[1:07:32] to lay before you our needs, Father.
[1:07:35] Lord, not that you would just do them
[1:07:37] because we ask, but Father, we do lay
[1:07:39] them at your feet as an opportunity for
[1:07:42] you to manifest and prove your word in
[1:07:44] our lives and those around us. Father,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; truly that is why we're here. Father, so
[1:07:48] the world might know that you are not
[1:07:51] dead, that you're still alive and you're
[1:07:53] in the earth in bride form.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, I have need of you, Father.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Settle my nerves, Father. Lord, this is
[1:08:00] not common for me, Lord. I do have a
[1:08:03] family and I even struggle in that
[1:08:05] ministry, Lord. But we do know we're
[1:08:07] standing here today, Father, in your
[1:08:08] perfect will.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; We have nothing in ourselves that we
[1:08:11] want to add or bring, Father. Lord, let
[1:08:14] as the word goes forth, Lord, minister
[1:08:15] each need. I pray in the name of the
[1:08:17] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I guess let's just read a word of
[1:08:25] from the Bible first and then we'll take
[1:08:26] our seats and get settled in and get
[1:08:28] comfortable.
[1:08:31] Let's turn to uh Joshua 24. Thank you,
[1:08:34] musicians.
[1:08:36] Thank you for the specials today and
[1:08:38] your worship. Definitely makes it easier
[1:08:40] to walk out into this presence.
[1:08:44] Joshua 24 verses 14 down to 16.
[1:08:51] When you get there, just say, "Amen."
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Now therefore, fear the Lord
[1:09:01] and serve him in sincerity
[1:09:03] and in truth, and put away the gods
[1:09:07] which your fathers served on the other
[1:09:09] side of the flood, and in Egypt, and
[1:09:13] serve ye the Lord.
[1:09:15] And if it seem evil unto you to serve
[1:09:18] the Lord, choose you this day
[1:09:23] whom ye will serve.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Whether the gods which your fathers
[1:09:27] served that were on the other side of
[1:09:29] the flood, or the gods of the Amorites,
[1:09:32] in whose land ye dwell.
[1:09:35] But as for me
[1:09:38] and my house,
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; And the people answered and said, "God
[1:09:46] forbid that we should forsake the Lord
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; to serve other gods."
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add his blessing to
[1:09:52] his reading. You may take your seats.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Sure. Appreciate Brother Mario's prayer.
[1:10:04] Amen. I know that what's on my heart,
[1:10:06] it's common, but it come together in a
[1:10:08] different way than I've ever heard.
[1:10:12] And I just pray that we could be edified
[1:10:14] together in it. Amen. I'm not here to
[1:10:17] put on a show. This is not common for
[1:10:19] me. I'm a deacon of the assembly here,
[1:10:21] but this is a part of the office and
[1:10:23] I've had some tremendous victories in my
[1:10:26] life since five years ago joining this
[1:10:28] assembly. And I'm proud to say that I'm
[1:10:31] a member of this assembly.
[1:10:36] For a long time, I didn't truly
[1:10:37] understand what it meant to be a part of
[1:10:40] assembly and what church actually meant
[1:10:41] to be a part of a body and a family and
[1:10:44] the offices of different things in our
[1:10:46] lives and in our midst. But we'll look
[1:10:48] at some of them today. But the one in my
[1:10:51] life that stands out the most is the
[1:10:54] office of a husband.
[1:10:56] And we will look through that. with
[1:10:58] husband and wife and what's on my heart
[1:11:00] today and the way God put it is if I was
[1:11:03] to title it it's the attitude of love
[1:11:08] and we know that this is the capstone
[1:11:10] age and the capstone is love and we
[1:11:12] proclaim that you know the the marriage
[1:11:14] has happened
[1:11:17] and we can say that in a minute but
[1:11:18] there has to be a physical manifestation
[1:11:20] just like when Jonah said
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; yes sir
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; there's going to be a flood he had to
[1:11:25] build a boat there's always a physical
[1:11:28] manifestation that we do in reverence to
[1:11:31] prove God's word.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; We can't just stand here and say, "I
[1:11:36] believe God's word," and not apply it to
[1:11:38] our lives.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Like I said, I'm nothing special, but
[1:11:45] then again, I am special because I'm a
[1:11:47] son of God.
[1:11:50] So I do believe we need to start stop
[1:11:53] looking at ourselves through the eyes of
[1:11:55] what Satan wants us to do and looking at
[1:11:57] our faults and our failures. Start
[1:11:59] recognizing that seed gene of God in
[1:12:01] you.
[1:12:03] Apply the word and allow it to manifest.
[1:12:05] But also look for that same seed gene in
[1:12:08] your wife and your children and your and
[1:12:10] in your parents and everyone. And then
[1:12:11] we just have to reverence that word.
[1:12:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; I just want to my main context or my
[1:12:19] main text here Joshua and it's
[1:12:23] interesting because he's standing there
[1:12:24] and everyone seemed to be even though
[1:12:27] they were the chosen of God they were
[1:12:29] message believers
[1:12:31] they were mixing the word for the hour
[1:12:34] with old traditions that they learned
[1:12:36] from their parents
[1:12:38] and then they were also now making their
[1:12:40] own rituals and mixing it with the new
[1:12:42] understanding.
[1:12:44] And Joshua, I'm sure he represented many
[1:12:47] others, but he had to stand up and say,
[1:12:49] "Listen, this is not what we're here
[1:12:51] for."
[1:12:53] You have to drive down a stake and say,
[1:12:55] "Choose you this day and we're going to
[1:12:58] look at these things. There's many
[1:12:59] things that I was taught in the message
[1:13:01] and many things have been added and it's
[1:13:03] not necessarily the message,
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; And it's not conducive to the message
[1:13:08] and a lot of times it holds us back and
[1:13:10] gives us an excuse. We have to take the
[1:13:13] word that he gave it to us and apply it
[1:13:16] and then we'll see the the life come
[1:13:17] forth out of that. It's not even going
[1:13:20] to be us, but we have to lift up and be
[1:13:22] sincere and honor and reverence the
[1:13:23] truth, the word given to us today. Amen.
[1:13:26] So, I'm going to turn to first John
[1:13:31] 4.
[1:13:32] And this is where I've got my title
[1:13:34] from, and
[1:13:37] we'll go through it here together. 1
[1:13:39] John 4 verses 1 starting there. And I
[1:13:44] just want you to know when we read this
[1:13:48] just to kind of help shake us from maybe
[1:13:50] hearing the same thing over and over
[1:13:52] again, the Lord can open our ears. But
[1:13:55] maybe just so that you pause and think a
[1:13:57] little bit when we read this here. When
[1:13:59] it says every spirit, the word there in
[1:14:02] the Greek, there's eight different
[1:14:04] applications. But in this application
[1:14:06] here from one down to seven it actually
[1:14:08] means way of thinking.
[1:14:14] So I'm going to read it that way and
[1:14:16] forgive me if that offends you but it is
[1:14:18] one of the I guess you can say angles of
[1:14:21] this word here and maybe it'll help you
[1:14:23] understand it now more than you ever
[1:14:25] have. But it also means attitude or
[1:14:27] disposition or reflecting the way in
[1:14:30] which a person thinks about or deals
[1:14:32] with some matter. its disposition, its
[1:14:34] attitude, its point of view, its frame
[1:14:36] of mind, its way of thinking. And
[1:14:40] brother Brandham taught us a lot about
[1:14:42] attitudes and also he taught us about
[1:14:45] the right frame of mind and how to
[1:14:48] approach God.
[1:14:50] Even though we want to talk about the
[1:14:51] spirit, this mind and that here that
[1:14:53] we're going to talk about, it's not your
[1:14:54] gray matter. That's just a muscle. It's
[1:14:57] actually the thinking in the spirit in
[1:14:59] you and how it will actually manifest
[1:15:02] and approach certain situations.
[1:15:05] So it says beloved, are you his beloved?
[1:15:08] Amen.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; I love how John speaks. Believe not
[1:15:14] every way of thinking, but try and that
[1:15:18] means test and prove
[1:15:20] the way of thinking whether they are of
[1:15:22] God because many false prophets have
[1:15:25] gone out into the world.
[1:15:27] So many winds of doctrine. People have
[1:15:30] taken the word and maybe added to it or
[1:15:33] manipulated it and maybe it was sincere.
[1:15:36] Could have been their own imagination.
[1:15:37] Hereby ye know the way of thinking of
[1:15:42] God. Would you like to know the way of
[1:15:44] thinking of God?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; You even think back in Genesis, Adam,
[1:15:50] you know, for a long time I've read that
[1:15:52] wrong when God said he was going to, you
[1:15:55] know, it's not good for a man to dwell
[1:15:56] alone
[1:15:58] and he was going to make him a wife and
[1:15:59] then he brought him all the animals.
[1:16:01] It's like, why did he get sidetracked?
[1:16:02] We called it in our family squirreling.
[1:16:04] It's almost like he squirreled away. And
[1:16:06] I'm just going to be real with you
[1:16:08] today. Okay?
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; But he it was a word test.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; He needed to test the man's thinking.
[1:16:15] Does he this man think like I think so.
[1:16:17] So he brought all the animals to him and
[1:16:19] he named them. But it's not that he
[1:16:21] named them and go he named them exactly
[1:16:23] the way God thought they would be named
[1:16:26] before he even created them in the
[1:16:28] earth. That was the test.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; And this is what he's looking for in his
[1:16:33] sons and daughters today. Do we approach
[1:16:35] life
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; through his thinking and he gave us his
[1:16:37] mind? He sent us this message and we
[1:16:40] have to reverence it above all else.
[1:16:42] Even our own thoughts, we have to take
[1:16:43] it in subjection and put it through this
[1:16:45] message and then it becomes actually
[1:16:47] easier and easier. It becomes second
[1:16:48] nature. It's called the mind of Christ.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Hereby ye know the way of thinking of
[1:16:55] God. Every way of thinking that
[1:16:57] confessth that Jesus Christ is come in
[1:17:01] the flesh is of God. And here now John
[1:17:03] is talking about Jesus. But the prophet
[1:17:06] taught us that it's every time he comes
[1:17:09] in every church age.
[1:17:11] It's when he comes in flesh. He always
[1:17:13] comes in flesh. He always has a person
[1:17:15] or a people on the earth
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; that he manifests himself through.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; And he always seemed like the worst
[1:17:22] bunch of people. And it's a stumbling
[1:17:25] block for Satan. He's like, "Really?
[1:17:27] Those people? I know their grandparents.
[1:17:29] They're who knows how many generations."
[1:17:30] And he's like, and God's like, "Yep,
[1:17:33] those people."
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; And every way of thinking that confesses
[1:17:40] not
[1:17:41] that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
[1:17:43] is not of God. And this is that way of
[1:17:47] thinking of Antichrist. Whereof ye have
[1:17:49] heard that it should come and even now
[1:17:52] already is in the world. And we know
[1:17:54] that. But there's a lot of many people
[1:17:57] that are nominal Christians. They're
[1:17:59] still looking for that to come. They
[1:18:01] don't even realize they're worshiping
[1:18:02] Satan right in their churches. And I'm
[1:18:04] not knocking on them. God has an
[1:18:05] economy. I leave that in his hands.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; But thank God for a prophet.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; This is also around the message
[1:18:18] following. There's been many isms and
[1:18:21] false doctrines pop up and uh we just
[1:18:25] have to be able to identify them and and
[1:18:27] walk forward. God will protect us
[1:18:29] because he given us his mind and his
[1:18:30] thinking. Amen.
[1:18:33] Says, "Now ye are of God,
[1:18:38] little children."
[1:18:40] Are you puffed up today or do you still
[1:18:43] look at yourself as a little child?
[1:18:46] That's how he wants us to see ourselves
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; because then he can deal with us
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; and have overcome them. Because greater
[1:18:54] is he that is in you than he is that is
[1:18:56] in the world. Amen.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; So now John is teaching us that you have
[1:19:02] the Holy Spirit
[1:19:05] and then you also you could have the
[1:19:06] Holy Spirit and still not be discerning
[1:19:08] things correctly. So you need to be able
[1:19:11] to take everything by his way of
[1:19:13] thinking. So Lord help me. Lord help me
[1:19:15] understand your thinking. Please allow
[1:19:17] me to think your way.
[1:19:20] They are of the world. Therefore speak
[1:19:22] they of the world and the world hearth
[1:19:25] them.
[1:19:26] We are of God. He that knoweth God
[1:19:30] heareth us. He that is not of God
[1:19:33] heareth not us. Hereby we know the way
[1:19:36] of thinking of the truth and the way of
[1:19:38] thinking of error.
[1:19:41] Now he says approaches us again.
[1:19:43] Beloved, let us.
[1:19:46] Now every time you read let us in the
[1:19:48] Bible
[1:19:49] there has to be a willingness. He's not
[1:19:52] he's a gentleman. He's not going to
[1:19:54] force anything on you.
[1:19:56] This is where being a wife as a a
[1:20:00] surrendered wife comes is you have to
[1:20:02] choose and it's free moral agency.
[1:20:05] No one else can choose it for you.
[1:20:06] Whenever you read let us or let this
[1:20:08] mind or know that there's a there's that
[1:20:11] is a I guess you can say a showdown
[1:20:14] whether or not you're willing to accept
[1:20:16] it.
[1:20:18] Love one another
[1:20:20] for love is of God.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And everyone that loveth is born
[1:20:24] of God and knoweth God.
[1:20:28] So an identifier here of being filled
[1:20:30] with the Holy Ghost is that the way you
[1:20:34] love is actually an identifier.
[1:20:39] How you love your wife, how you love
[1:20:41] your brother and your sister, and even
[1:20:43] how you love your enemies. Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Also, the way you think, the way you
[1:20:48] move through this world,
[1:20:51] how you approach situations, whether
[1:20:52] it's sickness or circumstances in your
[1:20:54] life, how you approach it is an
[1:20:57] identifier of who you are.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not, that goes
[1:21:00] both ways, could be good or bad.
[1:21:07] He that loveth not knoweth not God, for
[1:21:10] God is love.
[1:21:12] In this was manifested the love of God
[1:21:14] towards us because that God sent his
[1:21:17] only begotten son in the world that we
[1:21:19] might live through him.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Herein is love
[1:21:27] that we that sorry here is love. Not
[1:21:30] that we loved God, but that he loved us
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; and sent his son to be the prop
[1:21:37] propation of our sins, which is the
[1:21:39] appeasement or dissolver.
[1:21:42] Beloved, if God so loved us,
[1:21:46] we ought also to love one another.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; If he's asking this of us, he has to
[1:21:55] show us and teach us in his word, how am
[1:21:58] I supposed to love? and we'll we'll get
[1:22:01] into that.
[1:22:03] But as I said earlier, we're actually
[1:22:05] called to love our spouses, our
[1:22:08] brothers, and our sisters,
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; and our enemies.
[1:22:13] And if you're able to do this in a
[1:22:15] certain way is an identifier whether or
[1:22:17] not you have the Holy Ghost. Is that
[1:22:18] fair to say based on what we've said?
[1:22:22] We're talking about the mind,
[1:22:25] the government.
[1:22:27] The mind is what makes contacts with all
[1:22:30] thoughts and influences.
[1:22:32] And we have to take that mind and
[1:22:35] discern, hold these certain things into
[1:22:37] cap, whether they're even our own
[1:22:38] thoughts or not. And they seem grand and
[1:22:40] they seem great. But do they line up
[1:22:42] with the word of God? And then a true
[1:22:45] son and daughter, a bride of God will
[1:22:47] say, "No, I can't find it in the word.
[1:22:49] Not interested." Whether we receive it
[1:22:51] from outside or inside. Amen.
[1:22:54] If we have the Holy Spirit, we will have
[1:22:56] discernment by his way of thinking and
[1:22:59] we will be able to love correctly and
[1:23:01] all. This is our victory and how we
[1:23:04] defeat pride.
[1:23:06] So the greatest enemy or the greatest
[1:23:08] tool that Satan has is pride. Many
[1:23:11] different forms of pride, but there's
[1:23:13] got to be a way to overcome pride. And a
[1:23:16] lot of times it's putting others before
[1:23:19] yourself, living for others. Amen.
[1:23:26] I know many of us know about the cloud
[1:23:30] and I just want to read a quote and it
[1:23:31] kind of goes along with what we're
[1:23:33] saying here. This is from 1965 0718 in
[1:23:38] the evening spiritual food and due
[1:23:40] season.
[1:23:43] Then when that went up the big OB
[1:23:45] observatories from way down in
[1:23:47] California plumbed down in Mexico over
[1:23:49] Tucson everywhere taking the picture of
[1:23:51] it. It was a mysterious sight.
[1:23:54] Brother Fred Sauman there sitting right
[1:23:57] back there and I, brother uh Gene Norman
[1:24:01] standing right there present when it
[1:24:03] went up. They took the picture still
[1:24:06] they don't know what it's about here.
[1:24:09] Some time ago everybody saying lookie
[1:24:11] here that looks like them this and them
[1:24:13] angels and wings and they're folded
[1:24:16] there. see right away. It's our our
[1:24:18] nature to try and poke and prod at
[1:24:20] things and try and give an
[1:24:21] interpretation. Even a simple thing like
[1:24:22] this picture, but this picture was a
[1:24:24] very significant thing, a very
[1:24:25] significant event. And even there, I
[1:24:28] wasn't alive or around back then. But I
[1:24:30] know
[1:24:32] human nature don't change much. And
[1:24:34] there's many times things come out and
[1:24:35] we're like, oh, this and that. We we
[1:24:37] should be careful on things that we give
[1:24:40] life to, whether it's a thought or a
[1:24:42] comment. Our words mean a lot. Amen.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; But we start to see here that even
[1:24:48] though God does something great, our
[1:24:50] imagination can run a little while.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; And we knew it was something specific
[1:24:55] and something tremendous. He said, "One
[1:24:57] day,
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; turning it to the right, looking, there
[1:25:01] was Jesus Christ just as perfect as
[1:25:02] Hosman ever did ever draw him." He was
[1:25:06] standing there with a white wig on,
[1:25:08] looking back down towards the earth,
[1:25:10] showing that he is supreme authority.
[1:25:13] The heavens declare it. The Bible
[1:25:15] declares it. The message declares it.
[1:25:18] All the same supreme authority with the
[1:25:21] white wig on. You see his black beard
[1:25:24] under.
[1:25:25] Many of you seen the picture. We got it
[1:25:28] back there and we got it back here.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Just turn it to the right. Even the
[1:25:33] prophet didn't truly understand this
[1:25:35] picture. The the angel of the Lord had
[1:25:37] to tell him.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Just turn it right sideways. Look at it.
[1:25:41] There he is. is just as perfect as it
[1:25:43] was if it had been photographed of him.
[1:25:47] They're looking at it from the wrong
[1:25:48] angle. Remember, we're talking about a
[1:25:50] way of thinking.
[1:25:53] You got to look at it in the right
[1:25:56] angle.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And only the Lord
[1:26:00] can reveal which is the right angle.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Turn it to your right
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; and look at it. There he is. Just as
[1:26:10] perfect if it had been photographed up
[1:26:13] there.
[1:26:15] I know this seems like a simple
[1:26:18] thing, but this turn it to the right
[1:26:20] means a lot to me
[1:26:22] because there's a lot of things in my
[1:26:24] life that I in this message I wasn't
[1:26:25] looking at correctly and God in his
[1:26:28] grace turned it to the right for me.
[1:26:31] Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; And my question for you today, brother,
[1:26:36] husband, father, sister, wife, mother,
[1:26:42] children, teens, young adults.
[1:26:47] What do you want or need to be turned to
[1:26:49] the right in your life
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; today? What do you need? What do you
[1:26:58] desire?
[1:27:00] What do you lack?
[1:27:02] He is here.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; And he can and will turn it to the
[1:27:07] right.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; And everybody will see Jesus Christ.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:16] As I said, there was certain things in
[1:27:18] my life and
[1:27:20] I talk openly about
[1:27:23] our life and many people here know, but
[1:27:26] we backslid for 15 years and I don't
[1:27:29] want to dwell on that. The biggest issue
[1:27:32] that I understand now was my lack of
[1:27:35] understanding and revelation of marriage
[1:27:38] and what it meant to be a husband.
[1:27:42] Most of my adult
[1:27:44] Christian walk was full of frustrations
[1:27:47] because I had a desire to serve the
[1:27:50] Lord. I had a desire to see the fruits
[1:27:52] of the word in my life, but I lacked the
[1:27:55] ability.
[1:27:58] And that's a big part of our walk.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; We see the word of God and we know it's
[1:28:04] true. and we want to jump through all
[1:28:07] the process and get to the end and try
[1:28:08] and enjoy the the fruit and the blessing
[1:28:10] of it. But the word is a circumciser.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; It has to cut away the flesh side
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; because God can't allow Satan to say,
[1:28:21] "I've done this because it was done
[1:28:23] through the flesh." It
[1:28:26] and I know we have a lot of young people
[1:28:29] here. Even when I was young, I'm like,
[1:28:31] "What's the point of life?
[1:28:34] What is the purpose of marriage or
[1:28:36] serving God?
[1:28:38] You might even be middle-aged or older
[1:28:40] and still asking those questions. I want
[1:28:43] to approach them today.
[1:28:48] We have to start with what is the
[1:28:49] enemy's flood today. Every age has its
[1:28:53] challenges, but it also has its
[1:28:55] standard.
[1:28:57] And the question is is water who is the
[1:28:59] standard that God has promised to raise
[1:29:01] up. How's it going to happen? and what's
[1:29:03] it going to look like? We have to ask
[1:29:06] these questions to be able to answer
[1:29:07] them. And when you do, I know in my own
[1:29:11] life,
[1:29:13] the question always, it always lays it
[1:29:15] at your feet. It's never pointing at
[1:29:17] anyone else because you're the master of
[1:29:19] your own experience. I can't control
[1:29:22] even me speaking today. Even though I
[1:29:23] have a certain intention in my heart,
[1:29:26] you could totally be missing it and be
[1:29:27] on a different page. I can't control
[1:29:29] that.
[1:29:32] I'm responsible for me and my house and
[1:29:34] my life.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; But I do know when a son of or daughter
[1:29:37] of God sees the word made manifest or
[1:29:39] spoken in truth, they gravitate it to.
[1:29:46] I've been fed time and time again
[1:29:49] while I was sitting here in this
[1:29:50] assembly. God is good because I have an
[1:29:53] expectation and I reverence the word.
[1:29:55] Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; So let's talk about marriage. Is that
[1:29:58] okay?
[1:30:00] It's the you fix marriages, you fix
[1:30:02] homes, you fix the church, you fix the
[1:30:04] city, you fix the world. Do you believe
[1:30:06] that?
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Seems rather pointless today in society.
[1:30:13] Almost everyone you talk to has a failed
[1:30:15] marriage or has no interest. And maybe
[1:30:17] even some of our young men and women
[1:30:18] here today, it's like, why would I ever
[1:30:19] get married? It seems pretty risky. And
[1:30:22] that is true. And I want you to think of
[1:30:24] it this way. Remember when Moses was
[1:30:27] supposed to come forth?
[1:30:30] What did Satan try and do? Kill all of
[1:30:33] the people that it could possibly
[1:30:35] happen.
[1:30:36] When Jesus come, what did Satan do? He
[1:30:40] tried to he tried again to destroy all
[1:30:42] the young children, the flesh that could
[1:30:44] possibly make it live.
[1:30:48] So maybe that's why he's attacking the
[1:30:50] family and the marriages today is
[1:30:52] because there's something that's
[1:30:53] supposed to come forth and manifest out
[1:30:55] of it.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; We got to stop making everything so
[1:30:59] super spiritual.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; The word requires flesh. It requires a
[1:31:05] lived out life.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; And the more we look at it, we
[1:31:09] understand that in this flesh man, we
[1:31:11] can't do it.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; And then we get desperate and we
[1:31:14] struggle and we try. But comes a time
[1:31:17] when God proves his word and he proves
[1:31:19] it through human beings, brothers and
[1:31:21] sisters like you and I.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God's way.
[1:31:26] And that was always Satan's problem is
[1:31:29] that he could never ever get over. Even
[1:31:30] Jesus like really that little man, he he
[1:31:33] can't get past that the flesh side of
[1:31:36] things that he corrupted it so much. But
[1:31:40] God left one little space. And once he
[1:31:42] steps into that,
[1:31:45] It throws all the rest subject.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; It's not immediate. It's a process.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; And it's because we desire to be
[1:31:52] changed. We desire to be molded and
[1:31:54] shaped. Why do you have that desire?
[1:31:56] It's not because your parents taught it
[1:31:58] to you. It's a genuine desire in your
[1:32:00] heart.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:04] And if Satan ever tries to tell you
[1:32:05] you're lost or you're done or you're not
[1:32:07] worthy, Brother Brandham taught us that
[1:32:08] as long as you have a desire in your
[1:32:10] heart to serve the Lord in whatever
[1:32:13] capacity that is, then you're still
[1:32:15] able. Satan is a liar. Amen.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; I was just fellowshipping with brother
[1:32:19] Joel yesterday and we got to talking
[1:32:21] about certain things. And even when
[1:32:24] Satan comes against you and says you're
[1:32:25] lost, why would your enemy ever tell you
[1:32:28] where you sit? The very fact he's
[1:32:31] telling he if you were lost and he had
[1:32:33] you, he would just leave you alone
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; and just let you carry on in darkness.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; But the very fact that he's trying to
[1:32:39] tell you that you're lost,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; if you just have the right mind, the
[1:32:44] right way of looking at things
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; and discern things, life will become a
[1:32:49] lot simpler. Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; So marriage
[1:33:02] What is the true revelation and purpose
[1:33:04] of marriage and family?
[1:33:06] Why has Satan attacked and tried to
[1:33:07] destroy the institution of marriage?
[1:33:09] Amen. It's almost like all over again.
[1:33:11] He's trying to kill the very avenue on
[1:33:16] what something great that God wants to
[1:33:18] do.
[1:33:20] So, I'm just going to read this quote
[1:33:21] here.
[1:33:23] This is from uh proving his word
[1:33:26] 6408:16.
[1:33:28] There will be a resurrection of the
[1:33:30] dead. He'll confirm it.
[1:33:33] That's right. He'll prove it. There will
[1:33:35] be a rapture of the church. How's it
[1:33:38] going to be? I don't know. But he'll
[1:33:40] prove it. His word's true. There will be
[1:33:44] a millennium. He'll prove it. It's his
[1:33:47] word. There will be a new heavens and a
[1:33:50] new earth. He'll prove it because his
[1:33:52] word said so. And only the righteous
[1:33:55] will be there. He'll prove it, too.
[1:33:58] That's right. Only the ones that's been
[1:34:00] made part of this word. See, see where
[1:34:03] see we will be their part and their
[1:34:06] position in this word for their age.
[1:34:09] Will be the only one will be there
[1:34:11] because that's just what he is. He is
[1:34:13] the word.
[1:34:15] Now what is a woman? The image of a man.
[1:34:22] We have to take this wholeheartedly. You
[1:34:24] have to understand that you as a
[1:34:27] husband, your wife is a reflection of
[1:34:30] your ministry.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Whether you like that or not, if there's
[1:34:38] issue, please understand that if there's
[1:34:40] issue in your marriage,
[1:34:42] if you look at it the right way and
[1:34:44] apply the word, God will be seen in it.
[1:34:48] We have many circumstances in that, but
[1:34:50] that's not that is actually there for us
[1:34:52] to apply the word. So God can be proved
[1:34:54] in the earth. It's not about, oh, I want
[1:34:57] to do this and I want to do that.
[1:35:01] A woman is the image of a man.
[1:35:05] And what is it? What is the church? The
[1:35:08] image of the word. See, that's exactly.
[1:35:11] See, so it'll be there just exactly.
[1:35:14] Only the true believers in his word know
[1:35:18] this and can believe it. And God helps
[1:35:22] them to prove it. That's right. That is
[1:35:25] true. So there's an amazing re
[1:35:29] relationship between God and his
[1:35:31] children.
[1:35:33] And yes, God proves his word by bringing
[1:35:36] it to pass.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; But he brings it to pass through flesh
[1:35:40] bodies,
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; yielded flesh bodies.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; And then we have to ask, well, what is
[1:35:46] the promise of today? The word of today
[1:35:48] says that Christ and his bride are
[1:35:50] married and are one.
[1:35:53] Our marriages should reflect the
[1:35:56] revelation and understanding that we
[1:35:58] receive through being a bride of Christ.
[1:36:00] No other age has got to live and
[1:36:03] experience the relationship that we have
[1:36:07] and it has to have a physical
[1:36:08] manifestation.
[1:36:10] Marriage is one of the greatest
[1:36:12] blessings available to the believer.
[1:36:15] We have a lot of married people here
[1:36:16] today. Do you still believe that?
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; It can also be one of the hardest, most
[1:36:24] difficult experiences, too. Is that
[1:36:26] true?
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; I say amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; But God has a purpose in it
[1:36:32] if it's not handled correctly and
[1:36:34] entered properly and in accordance with
[1:36:36] God's word. And even then, it can be
[1:36:38] hard. But God taught us that there's a
[1:36:41] process and there is a reason for it.
[1:36:44] And God wants glory from it.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; But we always have to remember we're
[1:36:48] triune human beings. And God wanted to
[1:36:50] reproduce himself.
[1:36:52] And Satan always also wanted to
[1:36:54] reproduce himself.
[1:36:57] When you enter marriage, you can either
[1:36:59] enterly enter it through the flesh by
[1:37:02] natural carnal desires.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; You can enter it by religious spirit and
[1:37:06] just, you know, it's the right thing to
[1:37:08] do and it's what believers do and what
[1:37:10] Christians do. Or you can do it based on
[1:37:13] a on your soul understanding of the word
[1:37:15] what it truly means to be married. Amen.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; When entered upon and performed daily in
[1:37:22] the right attitude intentions, it
[1:37:24] reflects perfectly the relationship
[1:37:25] between Christ and his wife.
[1:37:29] Also, the prophet taught that the
[1:37:31] believer and his church requires the
[1:37:33] same level of precision and effort.
[1:37:39] I think you'll come to understand that
[1:37:40] marriage is a pride killer.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; One of Satan's greatest tools. If you
[1:37:48] truly enter marriage correctly and you
[1:37:51] live for the other person like you ought
[1:37:52] to.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Where can pride stand?
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; This is the life that our children need
[1:38:00] to see.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Not just dos and don'ts and do what I
[1:38:03] tell you. The relationship between my
[1:38:06] wife and I,
[1:38:09] the joy in our home, the love and the
[1:38:11] peace and the safety, the comfort, the
[1:38:13] blessings, that has to be stronger than
[1:38:15] the influence and pull of the world.
[1:38:21] That hit me hard.
[1:38:25] You can shake your head at it or you can
[1:38:26] now all of a sudden get desperate and
[1:38:28] say, "Lord, help me."
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:35] choosing of a bride. That's where it all
[1:38:37] starts, right?
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Choosing of a bride. But in there, he
[1:38:44] mixed in choosing of a church. So, don't
[1:38:47] take it lightly. When you choose a
[1:38:48] church, you put the same effort into it
[1:38:51] as choosing a bride.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:54] When I first started coming here,
[1:38:57] my attitude was, I'll go for fellowship
[1:39:00] and for a place for my wife and my
[1:39:02] family, but I was still going to sit
[1:39:04] underneath another ministry and pay
[1:39:06] tithes and offerings. God fixed that
[1:39:09] real quick because it's not proper.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; It's actually adultery.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; You can only have one headship.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; And whether you like it or not, the
[1:39:18] local assembly and the pastor is above
[1:39:21] your family. And you as husbands need to
[1:39:23] submit to that ministry.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; And if you do, God will give you
[1:39:28] everything you need in your office
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; to feed your family and to lead them.
[1:39:37] I hope nobody's still guilty of that.
[1:39:41] Maybe our wives and our children aren't
[1:39:44] submissive to us because maybe we aren't
[1:39:45] submissive to God in all avenues. total
[1:39:49] obedience to the whole word of God.
[1:39:52] Anyway, I'll leave that alone.
[1:39:55] Now, if the spiritual or the natural,
[1:39:57] sorry, this is uh paragraph 46. Yep. The
[1:40:02] choosing the natural is a type of the
[1:40:04] spiritual, then the choosing of a bride
[1:40:06] in the natural is a type of choosing a
[1:40:09] bride, the bride in the spiritual. Amen.
[1:40:14] Now, it's a serious thing when we go to
[1:40:16] choose and I'm not attacking anyone.
[1:40:19] This is just what the Lord laid on my
[1:40:21] heart. I'm not trying to be if this word
[1:40:23] hurts you or that is not my my intention
[1:40:26] is to help people and lift them up and
[1:40:28] elevate them in their walk.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; This word circumcised me so hard.
[1:40:35] But the blessings that my family
[1:40:38] get to enjoy now are far beyond that I
[1:40:40] ever thought that I would receive as a
[1:40:42] believer in this word. This word is
[1:40:44] true.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Don't just quote it with your mouth.
[1:40:47] Apply it to your life.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Every avenue. You're here to manifest
[1:40:52] the word of God. We're here for a
[1:40:54] purpose.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to dillydally around
[1:40:57] and go get a paycheck. Every aspect of
[1:41:00] your life. Whenever something happens,
[1:41:03] you're here to prove the word of God.
[1:41:05] You apply the word to that situation and
[1:41:08] watch God prove his word through you.
[1:41:14] Does your boss have a different opinion
[1:41:15] and testimony of you than yourself?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Does your wife, does your children, does
[1:41:20] your pastor, do your brother and sister?
[1:41:21] Are you willing to take their testimony
[1:41:23] of your own? Because we can dilute
[1:41:24] ourselves.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; That is the worst lies we tell are the
[1:41:28] ones to ourselves.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Right? If you have a spouse
[1:41:33] that is crying out something in their
[1:41:34] marriage, can you be big enough to
[1:41:36] humble yourself and listen and then
[1:41:37] inflect inside and say, "Lord, is that
[1:41:40] truly how the world sees me?"
[1:41:44] That's why you have a wife, for her to
[1:41:46] help you see you and you her. Amen.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; We can't just walk through life and just
[1:41:52] say, "I believe God sent a prophet and
[1:41:54] the word is
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; the word is here to mold us and shape
[1:41:58] us."
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Even when it comes through from your
[1:42:00] spouse or even your children, I can't
[1:42:03] wait for the day when my child comes to
[1:42:04] me and corrects me with the word.
[1:42:06] That'll be one of the happiest days of
[1:42:08] my life. Do you understand what I'm
[1:42:10] saying
[1:42:15] now? It's a serious thing.
[1:42:18] When we go to choose a wife, a man, for
[1:42:21] the vows here is until death do we part.
[1:42:25] That's how we should keep it. And you
[1:42:27] take that bow before God that only death
[1:42:30] will separate you. And I think we should
[1:42:32] a man in his right mind,
[1:42:36] right way of thinking, turn it to the
[1:42:38] right. I know it might not, but I can't.
[1:42:41] That's just the train of thought that
[1:42:42] the Lord led me down. that's planning a
[1:42:45] future that he should choose that wife
[1:42:48] very carefully. Be careful what you're
[1:42:51] doing. And a woman choosing a husband or
[1:42:54] accepting the choice of a husband should
[1:42:56] be real careful what she's choosing,
[1:42:59] what she's doing. And especially in
[1:43:01] these days, how far are we down the
[1:43:03] road? What he saw being birthed in the
[1:43:06] earth, it's a thousandfold now. It's
[1:43:10] very risky for more financial reasons,
[1:43:13] spiritual reasons.
[1:43:16] A man should think and pray before he
[1:43:18] chooses a wife.
[1:43:21] Not just, oh, I want her feels right.
[1:43:25] I think today what's got so many divorce
[1:43:28] cases now that we lead the world in
[1:43:30] America in divorce cases, we lead the
[1:43:32] rest of the world. There's more divorces
[1:43:34] here than anywhere else than this nation
[1:43:37] and supposed to be and thought of a
[1:43:39] Christian nation. What a reproach are
[1:43:41] divorce courts. I think the reason is
[1:43:44] because that men has got away from God
[1:43:46] and women has got away from God. But you
[1:43:49] see, they're still claiming to be
[1:43:50] Christians.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; It's very easy now. Amen.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; And we find that if a man prayed and a
[1:44:00] woman prayed over the matter, this is
[1:44:02] God's way of thinking.
[1:44:05] Not just look at a pretty set of eyes or
[1:44:07] a big strong shoulders or such as that
[1:44:11] or some other worldly affection, but
[1:44:13] would just look first to God and say,
[1:44:16] "God, is this your plan?"
[1:44:21] If that's the grounds on a relationship
[1:44:23] and a marriage starts, how do you think
[1:44:25] it's supposed to progress all the way
[1:44:26] through? It doesn't just stop there.
[1:44:30] As we know, there's many stages to
[1:44:32] marriage and life
[1:44:37] paragraph. I'm going to skip down to 51.
[1:44:40] And if we
[1:44:42] would study what we're doing when we're
[1:44:45] going to get married, and I'm going to
[1:44:48] pause right here.
[1:44:51] We're amateur gods. Correct.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to hit it right here. Now,
[1:44:55] what true marriage and that is. You're
[1:44:58] an amateur god.
[1:45:00] We know. And we went through election.
[1:45:03] And we know that the segene of God is
[1:45:06] election.
[1:45:08] Brother Brandham also taught us that the
[1:45:09] dirt, the soil that it's placed in is
[1:45:12] elected.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham taught us that God even
[1:45:17] created the earth just so he had the
[1:45:19] materials to make you.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; God's royal seed isn't just placed
[1:45:24] anywhere.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; It's placed in a very specific place.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Good soil.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; I know there's a parable about the sewer
[1:45:34] went forth. That's actually a different
[1:45:35] parable than a a royal seed of Abraham.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; So if God was very specific and he
[1:45:43] created the earth, he even knew all the
[1:45:45] way coming down years and years and
[1:45:47] years and all of a sudden here's brother
[1:45:50] Paul, here's sister Amber,
[1:45:53] he knew exactly the mess that you would
[1:45:55] come from and that you would go through.
[1:45:58] But he knows his seed gene. It was his
[1:46:00] choice.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; His choice.
[1:46:05] So, we're amateur gods.
[1:46:08] Marriage
[1:46:10] is how we prove that we understand
[1:46:14] the message and revelation of election.
[1:46:16] You, as an amateur god, get to choose
[1:46:19] the soil that you're willing to plant
[1:46:22] your seed, but the word of the hour.
[1:46:25] This is why it's so important.
[1:46:27] Ultimately,
[1:46:29] you get to choose the one person in the
[1:46:31] entire earth to love and respect and
[1:46:34] honor as if it was Jesus himself in
[1:46:36] flesh.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; That is what it means.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; You have to choose good soil.
[1:46:47] And if you're the woman, you have to
[1:46:49] choose a man that's worthy,
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; that's willing to honor the word of God.
[1:46:56] That is what true marriage is about.
[1:47:01] When we choose our wife, our husband, if
[1:47:04] we study it over, a man should pray
[1:47:06] earnestly for he could ruin his entire
[1:47:09] life. Remember the vows is until death
[1:47:12] do us part. Or he could ruin his life by
[1:47:15] making the wrong choice. But if he knows
[1:47:18] what he making the wrong choice and he's
[1:47:20] marrying a woman that isn't fit to be
[1:47:22] his wife and he does it anyhow, then
[1:47:25] it's his fault. That's right.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; If the woman takes a husband and knows
[1:47:29] that it's not fit to be a husband to
[1:47:31] you, that's your own fault.
[1:47:35] Choices have consequences.
[1:47:39] After you know what's right and wrong,
[1:47:42] a husband knows that he's not fit for to
[1:47:44] be a husband to you. Sorry. And that's
[1:47:46] your own fault. After you know what's
[1:47:48] right and wrong, so you shouldn't do it
[1:47:50] until you thoroughly pray through.
[1:47:54] The same applies by choosing a church.
[1:47:58] Now, you must pray over the church that
[1:47:59] you are fellowshipping in. Remember,
[1:48:01] churches have spirits. Amen.
[1:48:04] It's the most So, we never choose God,
[1:48:09] but we get to choose who we marry. And
[1:48:13] it's of the same importance. And you do
[1:48:15] it
[1:48:16] not because they can serve you.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; It's so that you can serve them.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:24] It's very hard when you choose to love
[1:48:26] someone and they don't reciprocate it
[1:48:28] back. But here,
[1:48:32] even when you get married, there'll be
[1:48:34] times when it's 50/50,
[1:48:36] where it's 100, 100.
[1:48:39] Sometimes it's 500 to one.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; My wife actually had to live that way
[1:48:48] for a long time to my own shame. But
[1:48:50] here we are. I find it odd, but I guess
[1:48:54] it's according to the word of God that
[1:48:56] I'm the one who has gets to stand here
[1:48:58] and minister this because I made all the
[1:49:00] wrong choices
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; once I got married, but I married the
[1:49:05] right woman.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; It's probably one of the main reasons
[1:49:14] why I'm standing here today, because at
[1:49:15] least I got that right. Amen.
[1:49:20] I brag on my wife a lot because for a
[1:49:23] long time I did the opposite.
[1:49:29] When I went through the hardest trial of
[1:49:30] my faith just recently
[1:49:33] when I wanted to just curl up and die
[1:49:34] and fall off the face of the earth.
[1:49:38] God gave me a true testimony in my
[1:49:39] heart, a testimony in my heart that I
[1:49:42] was the most blessed man in the earth.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:47] That is the truth
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; because I understood if this is that
[1:49:52] great of a trial.
[1:49:54] What's waiting on the other side is far
[1:49:57] greater.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; When you feel that way, understand with
[1:50:02] God's way of thinking, God doesn't hate
[1:50:04] you.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; He's trying to bring something forth.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:12] You get to choose the one person in the
[1:50:14] world to love like they are Jesus in
[1:50:16] flesh. Reflect his word for the age,
[1:50:18] husband and wife.
[1:50:22] Okay, let's kind of dig that down into
[1:50:25] that a little bit. You don't have to go
[1:50:26] there, brothers, but or you can bring it
[1:50:28] up. I'm going to you don't have to go
[1:50:30] there. I'm going to go to Ephesians
[1:50:32] 5:21-33
[1:50:34] because he we're supposed to love
[1:50:37] and if we're called to love then God
[1:50:39] needs to teach us and show us the proper
[1:50:40] way of loving.
[1:50:43] Ephesians 5:21-33
[1:50:46] submitting yourselves
[1:50:48] one to another in the fear of God.
[1:50:53] I heard this so many times but only
[1:50:55] recently did I truly understand
[1:50:58] this is a very powerful scripture.
[1:51:02] It's actually Philippians 2 2:3. If
[1:51:08] this is actually seed and soil. When you
[1:51:10] ever think of husband, think of seed.
[1:51:12] And whenever you hear wife, think of
[1:51:15] soil. Elected seed and elected soil.
[1:51:21] Submitting yourselves. I can't make
[1:51:23] someone else submit. I can only control
[1:51:26] myself. I can't beat my wife into she
[1:51:28] can't beat me in the she can't
[1:51:30] manipulate me because it's you know a
[1:51:32] man convinced against his will is still
[1:51:34] of the same opinion still it'll go for a
[1:51:36] little while right
[1:51:40] submitting
[1:51:42] what does that mean
[1:51:46] Philippians
[1:51:49] 2 1-15 but I'm just going to read the
[1:51:51] first as I love this portion of script
[1:51:53] it's become so real to
[1:51:56] Fulfill ye my joy that ye be
[1:51:59] like-minded, same attitude,
[1:52:02] having the same love, being of one
[1:52:05] accord, which is united in spirit,
[1:52:06] harmonious,
[1:52:08] of one mind, which is holding one view.
[1:52:12] You have to marry someone that
[1:52:13] understands marriage like you do.
[1:52:17] If you don't, you can still you can till
[1:52:19] that ground. It'll be harder and longer,
[1:52:21] but you can still till that ground. And
[1:52:24] but you're probably going to live in
[1:52:25] some frustration for a while. But even
[1:52:26] if you do right, there's still that
[1:52:28] you're not used to living and serving
[1:52:30] someone else. So even that becomes
[1:52:33] difficult, but you'll get through it.
[1:52:36] But it says, "Let nothing be done
[1:52:39] through strife, which is selfish
[1:52:41] ambition, or vain glory, which is cheap
[1:52:44] pride, but in loneliness, which is
[1:52:47] humility of mind, let each esteem the
[1:52:50] other better than themselves, which is
[1:52:52] more valuable."
[1:52:54] See, if you understand that you have the
[1:52:56] Cene of God, you need the soil to be
[1:52:59] able to manifest what's in you. And
[1:53:02] you're going to lift it up higher than
[1:53:04] you because you need it. you desire it.
[1:53:07] And when you're the soil, you understand
[1:53:08] you can't fulfill your true purpose
[1:53:10] unless you receive a seed.
[1:53:16] That's why the other is more valuable
[1:53:18] because you can't come to your full
[1:53:20] maturity or your full purpose unless you
[1:53:23] have the other.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Now, these are really hard here. It's it
[1:53:30] says submitting. So what it means is
[1:53:32] don't be going into it with selfish
[1:53:34] motivation or ambition or cheap pride. I
[1:53:38] know all about cheap pride.
[1:53:42] But it's a it's a humbling once you
[1:53:44] truly understand that true authority
[1:53:47] comes through humility.
[1:53:49] It'll totally change how you walk
[1:53:51] through this world.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; And we'll get into the most powerful
[1:53:55] force in the world today. And you have
[1:53:57] complete access to it. It's actually
[1:53:59] your inheritance. It's your right. It's
[1:54:02] actually your job, your purpose to bring
[1:54:04] it forth in the earth.
[1:54:08] Wives, submit yourselves unto your own
[1:54:10] husbands as unto the Lord.
[1:54:15] For the husband is the head of the wife,
[1:54:17] even as Christ is the head of the
[1:54:19] church, and he is the savior of the
[1:54:21] body.
[1:54:23] Therefore, as the church is subject unto
[1:54:25] Christ, so let the wives be to their own
[1:54:27] husbands in everything.
[1:54:31] Now, we can make that
[1:54:33] easy or hard, but it does say
[1:54:36] everything, and there's no way around
[1:54:38] that. But if you pick the right husband
[1:54:40] and he's lifting you up above himself,
[1:54:42] and you're lifting him up above
[1:54:44] yourself, that becomes very easy.
[1:54:48] What I'm trying to get through here is
[1:54:50] this is a standard
[1:54:53] and this is the standard of the age
[1:54:55] because it's the age of the capstone of
[1:54:57] husband and wife.
[1:55:00] Husbands love your wives. So it's not
[1:55:02] just one way. We got something to do
[1:55:05] too. As Christ also loved the church and
[1:55:08] gave himself for it. And I know we all
[1:55:10] know that.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; But do we do it daily?
[1:55:18] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:55:20] with the washing of the water by the
[1:55:22] word that he might present it to himself
[1:55:24] a glorious church not having spot or
[1:55:26] wrinkle or any such thing but it should
[1:55:28] be holy and without blemish. So it's
[1:55:30] actually your sacrifice that's going to
[1:55:32] allow her to present yourself that bride
[1:55:34] that you always wanted.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; It's symbiotic. It's not just one way.
[1:55:39] If you chose correctly, this is the
[1:55:41] fruit that you will get. Amen.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; So what men to love their wives as their
[1:55:46] own bodies. He that loveth his wife
[1:55:48] loveth himself. For no man ever yet
[1:55:52] hated his own flesh, but nourish it and
[1:55:54] cherish it, even as the Lord the church.
[1:55:57] For we are members of his body, of his
[1:55:59] flesh, and of his bones. For this cause
[1:56:02] shall a man leave his father and mother,
[1:56:04] and shall be joined unto his wife, and
[1:56:06] they too shall be one flesh. Amen.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of times that I didn't
[1:56:12] feel like one flesh.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; I can honestly say today
[1:56:19] I can say I do. And I know my wife would
[1:56:23] amen that.
[1:56:26] You come to understand
[1:56:28] that as a spouse, as a husband or as a
[1:56:31] wife, your testimony of yourself is
[1:56:33] nowhere near as important as the
[1:56:36] testimony your spouse has of you.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; And then when you have children, their
[1:56:42] testimony,
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; When I overcome certain things in my
[1:56:48] life, it was by fleeing
[1:56:50] from it and running into the word.
[1:56:54] And when I tried to fix my marriage,
[1:56:57] I tried the same tactic. Thought, hey,
[1:56:59] it worked before, it should work again.
[1:57:01] So whenever my wife would try and
[1:57:04] express certain things about me,
[1:57:08] I would run and put on a tape and think
[1:57:10] that was going to solve.
[1:57:15] Different circumstances require
[1:57:18] different actions, but it's all still
[1:57:19] the word of God.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have sometimes marriage is a
[1:57:23] fiery furnace,
[1:57:27] but you have to be willing and big
[1:57:28] enough to sit and listen to your spouse
[1:57:32] and talk about your letdowns.
[1:57:37] Times we hurt each other because the
[1:57:39] only way we're going to grow from it,
[1:57:40] it's hard. It's difficult because you're
[1:57:43] a son and daughter of God and you want
[1:57:45] to be perfect. But sometimes, and we'll
[1:57:48] get into it, what it actually looks like
[1:57:50] is we can become a sounding brass and a
[1:57:52] tinkling symbol. It's a stumbling block.
[1:57:56] But we have to endure and listen to each
[1:57:58] other and apply the word that will
[1:58:00] actually bring you closer together.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; We have to be able to communicate.
[1:58:06] Don't you just love it when you talk to
[1:58:08] your father and he listens?
[1:58:13] This is a great mystery, but I speak
[1:58:15] concerning Christ and the church. And it
[1:58:17] says nevertheless. And that always kind
[1:58:20] of it seems weird like I don't
[1:58:21] understand why nevertheless. But the
[1:58:23] word also means however or but or yet or
[1:58:26] except. So you can say but let every one
[1:58:30] of you in particular so love his wife
[1:58:32] even as his himself. And the wife see
[1:58:35] that she reverence her husband. So now
[1:58:38] we have love and respect.
[1:58:40] And this actually means a lot. It's a
[1:58:42] very foundational point. And I find it
[1:58:45] interesting that we're supposed to love,
[1:58:48] but it doesn't say they have to love us.
[1:58:49] They have to respect us.
[1:58:52] But once you dig into it, respect is a
[1:58:54] type of love. It's a it's a
[1:58:56] manifestation of love. And I noticed,
[1:58:59] and I don't know how many people would
[1:59:00] be honest here, but in my 15 years of
[1:59:03] backsliding, if my wife and I would get
[1:59:04] in an argument, she would say, "You
[1:59:07] don't love me like you used to." or you
[1:59:09] don't love me.
[1:59:11] And my retort was always, you don't
[1:59:13] respect me. I don't feel respected. Now,
[1:59:16] isn't it amazing that that's what's
[1:59:18] sitting right in scripture?
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; You even talk to most men, they just
[1:59:23] want to be respected.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; That's our love language.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; But they're all they're supposed to
[1:59:30] respect the word in us.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; And yes, a part of that is the flesh
[1:59:35] side. Unfortunately, you married a
[1:59:36] triune being. So, that comes with it.
[1:59:38] Amen. So, we're going to look at this
[1:59:40] love and respect
[1:59:43] uh because it's going to be important.
[1:59:44] Brother Brandham preached the message
[1:59:46] called respects.
[1:59:48] And in it, when he first talks, he he
[1:59:50] talks about whenever the word comes in
[1:59:52] flesh and when a man is standing in his
[1:59:55] position and the Holy Ghost is using
[1:59:56] him, if you don't respect it,
[2:00:00] death lies at the door.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; And he lists it. Countless people that
[2:00:05] disrespected him as a prophet.
[2:00:08] And he even told them before you die
[2:00:10] you'll cry out my name countless c. But
[2:00:12] then he goes and he talks about the
[2:00:15] people that did respect. Respect means
[2:00:18] that you honor and understand and you
[2:00:20] reverence that word.
[2:00:24] A lot part of that goes back to husband
[2:00:25] and wife. The relationship there. So you
[2:00:28] could be a son of God or a daughter of
[2:00:29] God and claim the message and not loving
[2:00:32] your wife or her respecting you and
[2:00:34] you're totally wrong and you have to fix
[2:00:36] it. God can't bless it. You'll get some
[2:00:39] blessings, but not the blessing that
[2:00:40] you're meant to have.
[2:00:45] Respect means obey, pay attention,
[2:00:47] observe. Respects.
[2:00:49] I spent a lot of time in the message
[2:00:51] respects. I would encourage you to
[2:00:54] listen to it because I can't preach that
[2:00:56] whole thing even though I'd love to. But
[2:00:59] respects, what respect truly means.
[2:01:01] Amen.
[2:01:04] Okay. Okay, I'm going to go to uh first
[2:01:06] Corinthians because we're told to love
[2:01:10] and okay, Lord, you I'm supposed to
[2:01:12] love. How do I How am I supposed to
[2:01:14] love? Lord, teach me.
[2:01:17] Okay, 1 Corinthians
[2:01:19] 13 1-8. Though I speak with tongues of
[2:01:23] men and angels, and have not charity or
[2:01:26] love, and love is supposed to be our
[2:01:29] headship. That's the capstone, right?
[2:01:32] I am become as sounding brass or a
[2:01:34] tinkling symbol. And though I have the
[2:01:37] gift of prophecy and understand all
[2:01:38] mysteries and all knowledge, and though
[2:01:40] I have all faith so that I could remove
[2:01:42] mountains and have not charity, which is
[2:01:45] love, proper headship, I have nothing.
[2:01:49] And though I bestow all my goods to feed
[2:01:51] the poor, and though I give my body to
[2:01:53] be burned, and have not love, proper
[2:01:56] headship, it profitth me nothing. I
[2:01:58] accomplish nothing. I'm not useful.
[2:02:00] Although if we were to look at things
[2:02:02] according to our flesh, be like, "Wow,
[2:02:04] this this is amazing." In God's eyes,
[2:02:06] God's way of thinking,
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; pointless
[2:02:12] because it wasn't done
[2:02:14] in the right avenue or on the right
[2:02:16] inspiration, motive, and objective.
[2:02:18] Gifts and callings are without
[2:02:20] repentance.
[2:02:23] I was going to come back to this part
[2:02:24] later, but we're running out of time. I
[2:02:26] just want people to understand that this
[2:02:29] is very dangerous.
[2:02:31] When a wife becomes
[2:02:34] a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol or
[2:02:36] a husband to them, it means you're just
[2:02:39] echoing. There's no life there. You're
[2:02:41] just talking quotes and message, but
[2:02:43] there's no no life behind it. You're not
[2:02:46] loving me like you ought to.
[2:02:50] or when parents
[2:02:54] when the kids see that the parents are
[2:02:56] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol.
[2:02:58] It's very dangerous because people are
[2:02:59] like, "Well, why why why did I get
[2:03:01] married? What a terrible mistake I
[2:03:04] made."
[2:03:06] But it's not the end. You can't be saved
[2:03:07] from this. I was in my relationship. I
[2:03:11] was that to my wife.
[2:03:14] But yet here we stand today. So I just
[2:03:16] want to give you hope. And the question
[2:03:18] is, are you brave enough to ask your
[2:03:20] spouse
[2:03:22] what side of that coin you sit on or ask
[2:03:25] your children,
[2:03:27] do I live the life before you? What is
[2:03:29] your testimony? Please tell me
[2:03:33] because we're going to get to and he
[2:03:34] said, "All that you ever loved and all
[2:03:37] that ever loved you will be there."
[2:03:43] Are we giving them something to
[2:03:44] reverence and love and respect to hunger
[2:03:46] after?
[2:03:49] Okay. Husbands and wives, we're told to
[2:03:52] love. Here it is. Love, charity,
[2:03:54] suffereth long, which means it's
[2:03:56] patient.
[2:03:59] It is kind. In other words, it acts
[2:04:01] kind. This is how husbands are to love
[2:04:04] their wives and wives love their
[2:04:06] husbands or respect.
[2:04:09] Love envithth not. It doesn't get
[2:04:11] jealous.
[2:04:12] Love vaunteth not itself. It means that
[2:04:15] it doesn't brag or boast about itself.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; It's not puffed up,
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; which means it's not proud.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Does not behave itself unseemingly,
[2:04:28] which is indecently or disgracefully.
[2:04:32] Seekth not her own, which is means it's
[2:04:35] unselfish.
[2:04:36] Is not easily provoked, which means
[2:04:38] you're upset. Now, this was in my DNA
[2:04:41] that I inherited.
[2:04:44] I had a temper like a budsaw.
[2:04:49] I can honestly say it's gone.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; If my wife doesn't amen that, then I'm a
[2:04:54] liar. But I'll tell you right now, I
[2:04:57] and I'd get upset that I would put so
[2:05:00] much effort in being a good husband
[2:05:03] and I wouldn't get the fruit that I
[2:05:04] thought I deserved and then I would
[2:05:05] every I'd blow up not wanting to and
[2:05:08] hate myself for it.
[2:05:12] Thinkketh not thinkketh no evil, which
[2:05:15] means it doesn't keep count of
[2:05:17] transgressions.
[2:05:20] Right?
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; I know that's a lot of times
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; tit for tat. Well, you did this to me.
[2:05:29] Even in a marriage, even in a holy ghost
[2:05:30] filled marriage,
[2:05:33] rejoices not in iniquity. It means in
[2:05:35] unjust deeds, but rejoices in the truth,
[2:05:39] which is the word of the hour.
[2:05:41] Beareth all things, which which put
[2:05:44] which means puts up with annoyances or
[2:05:46] difficulties. This is love. True love,
[2:05:48] God's love.
[2:05:50] believeth all things which is Christian
[2:05:52] faith
[2:05:54] hopeeth all things which means you look
[2:05:56] for the good and the beneficial the
[2:05:58] positive
[2:06:01] endureth all things which mean you
[2:06:04] persevere
[2:06:05] but at the end of all these it says all
[2:06:07] things so that means in all
[2:06:09] circumstances whatever comes your way
[2:06:11] sickness health
[2:06:14] do we remember our vows
[2:06:17] now this is a big
[2:06:19] Love never faileth.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; It means become inadequate for some
[2:06:26] function. It means to fail or fall out
[2:06:29] of form.
[2:06:32] When we read this,
[2:06:34] I think at least the first thing that
[2:06:36] comes to mind, Lord, I'm not capable of
[2:06:38] this,
[2:06:42] but it's required of me.
[2:06:45] So then we're like, how
[2:06:49] We have to die to ourselves.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; This is why marriage is one of the
[2:06:54] greatest tools
[2:06:56] because it'll drive you into desperation
[2:06:58] especially if you know you married on
[2:07:00] the right circum and then these things
[2:07:02] come up. It's like, okay, Lord, remember
[2:07:05] you're planting a seed and it has to
[2:07:06] grow and it has a different different
[2:07:08] stages of it, but this is supposed to be
[2:07:10] the end result.
[2:07:13] And if we go and we talk to a coworker,
[2:07:15] God sent a prophet and that, but we
[2:07:16] don't have the fruits of this. Why would
[2:07:18] they ever believe or want what we have?
[2:07:20] Why would our children ever want what we
[2:07:22] have and serve the God we serve? We
[2:07:23] don't have this. What benefit is it?
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; This is what marriage is supposed to
[2:07:30] produce.
[2:07:31] This is what we should hunger and thirst
[2:07:32] after. This is what should we should
[2:07:34] strive for. This is what we should seek
[2:07:36] the Lord for.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; The circumstances that come around our
[2:07:44] marriage
[2:07:45] are meant to drive us closer together
[2:07:47] and into God as a one unit,
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; not drive us apart. So we if it's
[2:07:53] driving us apart, we're using the wrong
[2:07:55] way of thinking.
[2:07:57] It's an opportunity to apply and
[2:08:00] manifest the word of God.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; That we say we believe
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; in John 3:16 and that he says, you know,
[2:08:09] God sent his son, whoever believeth on
[2:08:10] him should ever have everlasting life.
[2:08:12] When you get down to the end, it says,
[2:08:15] "He that doeth the truth." There's an
[2:08:18] evolution. There's a growth.
[2:08:21] Belief is not just claiming it with your
[2:08:23] lips.
[2:08:25] It's living it out, applying it to your
[2:08:27] life. so God can honor and bless it. The
[2:08:28] blessing is already there. It's just we
[2:08:30] have to put ourselves in the position to
[2:08:31] receive it.
[2:08:36] It's to get us to call out to God
[2:08:38] together, call him on the scene,
[2:08:42] to apply the word and prove his
[2:08:43] promises.
[2:08:48] Not to beat each other with quotes and
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; manipulation.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Has to be free will.
[2:08:57] So, and I know we're since we just
[2:08:59] talked about this, but the question
[2:09:01] comes, what is the greatest most
[2:09:02] powerful force in the world? Does anyone
[2:09:05] know what our prophet taught us?
[2:09:09] Love.
[2:09:11] The attitude of love. My attitude
[2:09:13] towards you is my attitude towards
[2:09:16] Christ. I'm going to read a few quotes
[2:09:18] here, kind of bring this all together.
[2:09:23] This is from
[2:09:26] what was the Holy Ghost given for 1959
[2:09:31] 12:15.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to hurt anyone.
[2:09:38] I'm only preaching things that I've
[2:09:39] experienced and gone through myself and
[2:09:41] I know the value and I know the blessing
[2:09:43] that comes with it.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; It hurts,
[2:09:48] but it's meant to hurt because it's not
[2:09:50] hurting your soul or your spirit. It's
[2:09:52] hurting your flesh.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; We die daily
[2:10:01] and we know that we're taught by the
[2:10:02] Bible and the prophet that when a person
[2:10:05] dies, their soul, their spirit, and
[2:10:08] their flesh separates.
[2:10:10] So if we're to die daily to ourselves,
[2:10:13] would it not stand a reason
[2:10:16] that our soul, our spirit, and our flesh
[2:10:19] begins to separate and becomes easier
[2:10:21] and easier to discern between
[2:10:24] them so that we can actually give
[2:10:26] preeminence to the one that's meant to
[2:10:27] be? Is that a fair thought?
[2:10:31] That's how you're rapturing.
[2:10:33] And it's a daily dying to yourself,
[2:10:36] killing this flesh.
[2:10:39] I'm sick of this pesto house. I truly
[2:10:42] am. It's not just something I say. I
[2:10:43] hate it. I hate everything about it. But
[2:10:46] I know it's there
[2:10:48] so that God can get glory.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; So, I endure it. But I know it gets
[2:10:54] easier and easier to kill it the more
[2:10:56] and more I serve others. There's a
[2:10:57] blessing in serving others. I'm so
[2:10:59] thankful to be able to stand in the
[2:11:01] office of a deacon
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; because it helps me kill this flesh, but
[2:11:06] also bring a blessing to people. Amen.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Same Holy Spirit that saved the Lutheran
[2:11:13] and the sanctified the Methodists that
[2:11:15] baptized the Pentecostals is now setting
[2:11:17] in order the coming of the Lord Jesus
[2:11:20] when it'll be so powerful
[2:11:23] that that body will come into this
[2:11:25] group, a church that'll draw the rest of
[2:11:28] them from the grave that'll there will
[2:11:30] be a resurrection. That's what the Holy
[2:11:32] Ghost is for. This is what what is the
[2:11:35] Holy Ghost? Without us they cannot be
[2:11:37] made perfect. They lived in one day
[2:11:41] under that we live in another day. When
[2:11:44] the enemy comes in like a flood.
[2:11:48] So we know today he comes in to destroy
[2:11:50] homes and marriages. The spirit of God
[2:11:54] will raise a standard against it.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; And it's a life. It's actually a family
[2:11:59] masterpiece.
[2:12:02] Right there he said, "Husbands, if you
[2:12:04] love your wives, wives, if you respect
[2:12:07] your husbands, and the next one is
[2:12:09] children, if they're on the scene, obey
[2:12:12] and honor your parents." That is God's
[2:12:15] masterpiece today in flesh.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; And it's a nuclear I studied nuclear
[2:12:23] families and nuclear bombs. The amazing
[2:12:25] thing is today nuclear. So this is a
[2:12:27] nuclear family. It used to be years ago
[2:12:30] that I studied the the different types
[2:12:32] of families. I wasn't going to say this,
[2:12:34] but I feel led to go there. Nuclear
[2:12:36] family is a husband and a wife and kids.
[2:12:39] It's funny that they use the word
[2:12:41] nuclear.
[2:12:43] We know today the world's full, this is
[2:12:45] just a thought, take it or leave it,
[2:12:47] full of nuclear bombs. But God has a
[2:12:49] nuclear bomb and it's a fusion bomb.
[2:12:54] When nuclear bombs started first started
[2:12:57] becoming made, they were atom bombs
[2:12:59] which separated it. And we know the word
[2:13:01] of God does that. And then they
[2:13:03] developed into uh a fision bomb which is
[2:13:06] it separates and brings together. But
[2:13:08] the most powerful bombs today are fusion
[2:13:11] bombs.
[2:13:13] They bring things together. I don't
[2:13:16] understand all that, but I just like
[2:13:17] amen Lord. Thank you. Like all things
[2:13:20] speak of it.
[2:13:22] When the enemy comes in as a flood, the
[2:13:24] spirit of God will raise a standard
[2:13:25] against it. See, we're in that day now.
[2:13:28] I just got here. Broken homes
[2:13:30] versus the family masterpiece. Back
[2:13:33] there, they wasn't half as smart as
[2:13:34] today. They couldn't make an atomic bomb
[2:13:36] or in an automobile. They didn't have
[2:13:38] science and things that we have now, but
[2:13:40] in things and things of mysterious
[2:13:42] things to try to say man blowed
[2:13:45] together. some what he's talking about
[2:13:47] is the great, you know, uh, when the
[2:13:50] earth was created, the great, uh, what's
[2:13:53] it called again? Sorry.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Big.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Big bang. Yeah. The big bang theory. And
[2:13:57] take some analysis and prove it to make
[2:13:59] infidels out of people. Now they're
[2:14:02] trying to tell boys can be girls and
[2:14:03] girls can be boys and all this woke
[2:14:06] nonsense. It's it's the same spirit, but
[2:14:08] it's just coming out in a different way
[2:14:09] to attack God's promise and word for the
[2:14:12] day.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; So, why is he trying to do that? Why is
[2:14:14] he trying to break down what it means to
[2:14:16] be a man and a woman and a wife and a
[2:14:18] husband and
[2:14:20] But now when we need it, the spirit of
[2:14:23] God raises a standard. What is it? He is
[2:14:26] pouring in his spirit. Pouring in his
[2:14:29] spirit. Then those who are resting out
[2:14:31] yonder in the grave or under the altar
[2:14:33] of God as the scripture says are crying,
[2:14:35] "How long, Lord? How long? How much
[2:14:37] longer? God is waiting on me and you."
[2:14:40] Amen.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; So many times I'm waiting on the Lord.
[2:14:44] I'm waiting on the Lord. And here's the
[2:14:46] Lord waiting on me and you.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; The church is waiting on me and you.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; Adoption time.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; When God can pour into his into us his
[2:15:02] fullness, his power, his resurrection.
[2:15:05] And when the church and Christ become so
[2:15:08] close together till Christ becomes
[2:15:10] visible among us, I'm going to ask you,
[2:15:13] what is your interpretation or
[2:15:15] understanding of what it looks like for
[2:15:16] him to be visible amongst us?
[2:15:20] Is it just signs and wonders and powers
[2:15:22] or is it
[2:15:24] marriages built upon the word of God
[2:15:28] manifesting Christ that way? It's we all
[2:15:31] we know the age is about marriage and
[2:15:33] capstone and husband and wife. What
[2:15:36] would the physical manifestation of that
[2:15:38] look like if we're the flesh of it?
[2:15:41] That's just my question.
[2:15:45] Church in Christ, wife and husband.
[2:15:47] Here's the next one just to carry on the
[2:15:49] thought.
[2:15:52] From that time, 19610415b.
[2:15:58] This is from that time. There's so many
[2:16:00] you can punch in.
[2:16:03] We must love
[2:16:06] divinely. Love one another.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Then you don't see your brother's
[2:16:11] mistakes. I'm going to say your your
[2:16:14] spouses. If he does not if he does make
[2:16:17] a mistake, you never you never look at
[2:16:19] the top of it. You look over the top of
[2:16:21] it and you love him anyhow. See, that's
[2:16:23] it. Love those that love you.
[2:16:26] Then does not the sinner the same thing
[2:16:30] but love those who were does not sorry
[2:16:33] but love those who doesn't love you
[2:16:37] we have no way of escaping it we have no
[2:16:40] excuses all we can do is get desperate
[2:16:42] and Lord bring this forth in me what is
[2:16:44] it that I got to lose of myself
[2:16:48] that's what shows the spirit of God is
[2:16:50] in you
[2:16:53] loving my enemies shows the spirit
[2:16:58] There's many different ways of showing
[2:17:00] it, but the prophet said that
[2:17:03] it'll make you love your enemy as you do
[2:17:06] your friend.
[2:17:08] It's an identification.
[2:17:11] Total obedience to the complete word of
[2:17:13] God. Amen.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; This is a simple one from conferences
[2:17:18] 1982.
[2:17:21] The musicians will come. I'll start
[2:17:24] closing. I have a few minutes left.
[2:17:27] Love, God's love.
[2:17:29] Love is the most powerful thing that
[2:17:32] there is in the world.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; This is agapo love. It conquers anything
[2:17:38] is love.
[2:17:40] By this you shall conquer
[2:17:44] by love divine, loving one another,
[2:17:46] loving the cause of God, loving Christ,
[2:17:50] loving suffering humanity.
[2:17:53] That's how you conquer.
[2:17:57] Another one
[2:17:59] from uh
[2:18:02] the rejected king. And this is the one
[2:18:03] that I really want to get to. And I'll
[2:18:05] just read one more scripture and then
[2:18:06] we'll close. Thank you for bearing with
[2:18:08] me. I hope it's been a blessing.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; This is a And I looked and I could see
[2:18:13] the people just as far as I could see
[2:18:16] still coming, wanting to hug me,
[2:18:18] screaming, "Our precious brother."
[2:18:22] Just then a voice said, "All that you
[2:18:24] ever loved
[2:18:26] and all that ever love you, God has
[2:18:29] given you here." And I looked. You know,
[2:18:32] there's other places where he said, "Are
[2:18:33] they all Brandoms?" He's like, "No,
[2:18:35] they're your converts."
[2:18:37] You have to know we all have a ministry.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Every one of us. As insignificant as you
[2:18:43] might feel, you have a ministry. The
[2:18:45] world is caught on to that. They call
[2:18:46] them influencers.
[2:18:49] When are we going to rise up with our
[2:18:51] ministry?
[2:18:53] Not going out and it's just living this
[2:18:56] life. Your neighbors seeing the love of
[2:18:58] Christ.
[2:19:01] Just then a voice said, "All that you
[2:19:02] ever loved and all that ever loved you,
[2:19:04] God has given you here." And I looked
[2:19:06] and here come my old dog come walking
[2:19:09] up. Here is my come my horse and laid
[2:19:12] his head upon my shoulder and knickered
[2:19:14] said all that you ever loved and all
[2:19:16] that ever loved you God has given them
[2:19:18] into your hand through your ministry
[2:19:22] through your influence people that
[2:19:23] respected
[2:19:25] the word.
[2:19:29] Now I want to ask where is that in
[2:19:30] scripture? It's got to be found
[2:19:32] somewhere in the scripture. Have you
[2:19:33] ever had questions like that Lord? Where
[2:19:34] is it? Because I want to know if it
[2:19:36] applies to me or you.
[2:19:39] God can't do something outside of the
[2:19:40] word. It's actually John 3. God so loved
[2:19:44] the world that he gave his only begotten
[2:19:46] son that anyone that would believe.
[2:19:47] We're talking about whenever God comes
[2:19:49] in flesh.
[2:19:51] If anyone's able to reverence that word
[2:19:53] in whatever capacity,
[2:19:57] that's a type of love back and they can
[2:19:59] get eternal life for it. Jesus, if
[2:20:02] people even went into his shadow, could
[2:20:05] get healed. Today we're taught that even
[2:20:07] if someone is kind to you and gives you
[2:20:09] a glass of water, they can receive
[2:20:12] eternal life.
[2:20:15] [Music]
[2:20:17] And I'm felt myself move from that
[2:20:19] beautiful place. And I looked around and
[2:20:22] I said, "Are you awake, honey?" She was
[2:20:24] still asleep. And I thought, "Oh God, oh
[2:20:27] help me, oh God, never let me compromise
[2:20:29] with one word.
[2:20:34] Let me stay right straight on that word
[2:20:36] and preach it. Preach it isn't just
[2:20:38] standing here doing this. It's living
[2:20:40] your life. Brother Brandham said it's
[2:20:42] the most important.
[2:20:46] He said live it. Live the message.
[2:20:50] I don't care what comes or goes, what
[2:20:51] anybody else does, how many Sauls or
[2:20:54] sons of Kish rise, how many this that
[2:20:56] and the other. Let me Lord press to that
[2:20:59] place.
[2:21:01] all fear of death. I say this with my
[2:21:04] Bible before me this morning. I've got a
[2:21:07] little boy there, four years old, to be
[2:21:08] raised. I got a nine-year-old girl and a
[2:21:11] teenager and I'm thankful for that's
[2:21:14] turned the way of the Lord. God let me
[2:21:16] live to bring them up in the admonition
[2:21:18] of the Lord of God.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; And above that,
[2:21:23] above that, my own flesh and blood.
[2:21:26] The whole world seems to scream to me.
[2:21:29] 90 year old woman and men of all kinds.
[2:21:33] If you hadn't have went, we wouldn't
[2:21:35] have been here.
[2:21:41] And God, let me press the battle. But if
[2:21:44] it comes to dying,
[2:21:46] I'm no more morose, which means gloomy.
[2:21:48] A gloomy disposition.
[2:21:51] A disposition of love is what's
[2:21:52] required. It will be a joy. It would be
[2:21:55] a pleasure to enter from this corruption
[2:21:57] and disgrace.
[2:21:59] Amen.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my precious friends. 168.
[2:22:08] My beloved,
[2:22:10] John was calling us his beloved. My
[2:22:14] darlings of the gospel, my begotten
[2:22:16] children unto God. Listen to me, your
[2:22:18] pastor.
[2:22:20] You, I wish there was some way I could
[2:22:22] explain it to you. There's no words. I
[2:22:25] couldn't find it. It is not found
[2:22:27] anywhere. But just beyond this last
[2:22:29] breath is the most glorious thing
[2:22:33] you ever. There is no way to explain it.
[2:22:36] There's no way I can't just do it. But
[2:22:38] whatever you do, friend,
[2:22:41] lay aside everything else till you get
[2:22:44] perfect love.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; It starts at home.
[2:22:52] Marriage, I guess you can say, is your
[2:22:54] practice ground if you want to say. He
[2:22:56] allowed you to choose one person in the
[2:22:58] entire world to love and it becomes
[2:23:00] difficult but he allowed you to choose
[2:23:04] because then from there you can love
[2:23:07] your brother and your sister and you can
[2:23:09] love your enemies
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; because you can go home to a place where
[2:23:14] you know perfect love resides and you
[2:23:16] once you receive it you want to give it
[2:23:17] to anyone that you can.
[2:23:20] He said when so you know divine love is
[2:23:22] projected sovereign grace takes over.
[2:23:27] I'm going to press that battle. So he
[2:23:30] made uh he talks about the experience.
[2:23:32] He says
[2:23:34] that one visit there to me has made me a
[2:23:36] different man. I can never never never
[2:23:38] be the same brother Brandham that I was.
[2:23:41] Whether the planes are rocking, whether
[2:23:42] the lightning is flashing, whether the
[2:23:44] spy has a gun on me, whatever it is, it
[2:23:47] doesn't matter. I'm going to press the
[2:23:48] battle by the grace of God. For I preach
[2:23:50] the gospel to every creature and every
[2:23:52] person that I can persuading them to
[2:23:55] that beautiful land yonder.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; It may seem hard. It may take a lot of
[2:24:02] strength. I don't know how much longer.
[2:24:03] We don't know. Physically speaking, he
[2:24:05] just got a doctor's exam and he said,
[2:24:06] "You got 25 more years."
[2:24:09] He go, "That helped me." But oh, that
[2:24:11] wasn't it. That isn't it. It's something
[2:24:13] within here. This corruption has got to
[2:24:15] put on corruption. The mortal has to put
[2:24:18] on immortality. Amen.
[2:24:23] I just want to read one more scripture.
[2:24:26] You don't have to turn there. Maybe you
[2:24:29] were like me
[2:24:31] and you weren't able to love this way.
[2:24:34] Maybe you still can. And maybe your
[2:24:35] marriage is seems completely broken.
[2:24:39] My family is proof
[2:24:42] and it's right here in scripture. So
[2:24:45] don't get dismayed.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; There's a final word here. If you feel
[2:24:49] this word has kind of hurt you and you
[2:24:51] feel like all is lost and done, that's
[2:24:53] not the God we serve. Ezekiel 36:33-36.
[2:24:58] [Music]
[2:25:00] Now this was to the natural and royal
[2:25:02] seed of Abraham. Thank God a prophet
[2:25:04] taught us this.
[2:25:06] Thus saith the Lord God, in the day that
[2:25:08] I shall cleanse you from all your
[2:25:10] iniquities.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; I've had iniquities.
[2:25:16] I will also cause you to dwell in the
[2:25:18] cities, and the waste shall be builded,
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; and the desolate land shall be tilled.
[2:25:28] Whereas it lay desolate in the sight of
[2:25:31] all that passed by. This is how God
[2:25:33] works.
[2:25:37] I'm thinking on this scripture about
[2:25:39] marriages, relationships,
[2:25:42] and they shall say, "This land that was
[2:25:44] desolate
[2:25:46] has become like the Garden of Eden."
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; And the waste and the desolate and
[2:25:51] ruined cities are become fenced and are
[2:25:54] inhabited. Amen.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; Then the heathen that are left round
[2:25:59] about you shall know
[2:26:02] that I the Lord God Lord build the
[2:26:06] ruined places
[2:26:08] and plant that was desolate. I the Lord
[2:26:11] have spoken it and I will do it.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; What a promise.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Do you believe?
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; You willing to accept it?
[2:26:23] You willing to take the tilling process,
[2:26:25] the breaking of the soil, the flesh,
[2:26:29] allow God to bring his word to pass.
[2:26:31] Amen.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; In the scripture we read first,
[2:26:35] choose you this day.
[2:26:38] Whom will you serve?
[2:26:41] As for me and my house,
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; we shall serve the Lord.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. Amen.
[2:26:57] Just gonna let's just close in a word of
[2:26:59] prayer and I'll get brother Emanuel to
[2:27:00] come and close us with a few songs if
[2:27:02] that's okay. Amen.
[2:27:05] Heavenly Father, Lord,
[2:27:08] we thank you, Father, for your word.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; We thank you for prophet that brought us
[2:27:16] the word, the truths, Father, of this
[2:27:18] hour.
[2:27:20] Thank you for spouses, Father, that want
[2:27:23] the standard of the word in their homes.
[2:27:26] When one is weak, the other is strong.
[2:27:32] Father, for our children's sake in the
[2:27:35] future, Father, Lord,
[2:27:38] may we be able to just surrender all to
[2:27:40] you.
[2:27:41] May those around us, our neighbors,
[2:27:45] co-workers, our brothers and our
[2:27:46] sisters,
[2:27:48] especially our children, Lord, see the
[2:27:51] word made manifest, Father. Not just
[2:27:53] talked about, but reverenced in a lived
[2:27:56] life, applying it daily, dying to
[2:27:59] ourselves. Father,
[2:28:02] that is our desire. Lord, forgive us of
[2:28:03] our shortcomings and our failures.
[2:28:05] Father, Lord,
[2:28:07] take this word, Lord.
[2:28:09] [Music]
[2:28:11] May it bring fruit, Father, in this
[2:28:13] assembly.
[2:28:15] May it bring fruit in this city.
[2:28:17] May it bring fruit, Father, in the
[2:28:20] country. We can't do it, Lord, but we're
[2:28:22] relying on you and we're willing to
[2:28:23] surrender, Father. We accept your word
[2:28:26] of life and we walk forward in it. Thank
[2:28:29] you, Father, for this day and this
[2:28:30] opportunity, Lord. In Jesus Christ's
[2:28:32] name we pray. Amen.
[2:28:41] I don't see it.
[2:28:44] Jesus,
[2:28:48] make
[2:28:50] me more.
[2:28:54] Amen. Bless you, brother.
[2:28:57] [Applause]

[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; Did you come under expectation this
[2:30:16] morning?
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; Don't you love Brother Don's testimony?
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:23] Shall we put our hands together for
[2:30:32] you know I believe that everybody who
[2:30:35] went through that situation if you go
[2:30:38] through the lows you wouldn't be happy
[2:30:42] you wouldn't enjoy it but God was using
[2:30:46] that to talk to us today
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; praise the name of the Lord Amen.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; You remember brother Abraham speaks of
[2:30:53] Moses and his temper and he says God
[2:30:56] gave him a wife. Hallelujah.
[2:30:59] He gave him a wife that will help him.
[2:31:03] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; I thank you, brother Don. I think that
[2:31:08] there have been so many nuggets in this
[2:31:11] that I
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; I I sat there listening and thinking,
[2:31:14] wow, if we could just not miss this.
[2:31:19] It's simple,
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; but it's the truth.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; If we could just not miss it. It says,
[2:31:25] "As for me and my house,
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; as for me, it starts with me.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; It's me first
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; because I cannot give what I don't have.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; So, I have to stand somewhere
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; and then get there before my house." But
[2:31:45] you see that Joshua doesn't say, "Well,
[2:31:47] if my wife agrees, if my children agree,
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; yes, sir."
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; As much as he cannot save them, he still
[2:31:55] make the determination
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; counting on the strength of the Lord.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; We have to spend time on our knees,
[2:32:01] brothers and sisters.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Don't think, sister, that you are not
[2:32:04] part of it. You are part of it.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; If your husband is not in his position,
[2:32:09] stay on your knees.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; Believe in that. Ask for you and your
[2:32:14] house. Children, if your father and
[2:32:17] mother are not here, you have to believe
[2:32:20] and stay on your knees. Ask for you and
[2:32:23] your house.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God.
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; It's as for me and oh man, I
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; I just see that I'm going on and on, but
[2:32:36] I just can't go without saying this,
[2:32:39] brothers. I'm not repeating what he
[2:32:41] said, but just don't forget this. He
[2:32:43] said it
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; If I am lost, if I'm the devil's camp,
[2:32:48] why would he need to come and tell me?
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; So every time he comes to tell you that,
[2:32:54] praise the Lord.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; When he comes to tell you that, just get
[2:32:58] up and jubilate.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; Because that's what he used to distract
[2:33:01] us.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Thank you
[2:33:04] very much, Father.
[2:33:14] I think one of my favorite sites was if
[2:33:16] you hadn't went, we wouldn't be here.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; It's something we read it and we just
[2:33:22] cross over it. It's important. It's
[2:33:26] necessary.
[2:33:28] When somebody comes and tells, "Oh yeah,
[2:33:30] the pro prophet said this, but let's put
[2:33:32] it aside and take the Bible." You know
[2:33:34] what he's denying you? Life.
[2:33:37] The only thing to meet the conditions of
[2:33:39] today is what God prepared for the
[2:33:42] conditions of today.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; And that's the message.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; There's absolutely nothing else.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; If somebody, oh yeah, okay, where is
[2:33:48] that? But let's put it aside. Be careful
[2:33:52] out there. They doing the same thing.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; Go through all the denominations,
[2:33:56] they'll tell you, we believe the Bible,
[2:33:58] not any man. Actually, they will accuse
[2:34:00] you of believing a man.
[2:34:02] So if that precious thing that you have
[2:34:04] that sets you apart, you take it out, we
[2:34:07] are a denomination then
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; and a poor excuse at that.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; I just wanted to say this.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; Let's be on our feet.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:34:18] Um shall we say uh love lifted me if
[2:34:23] [Music]

[2:38:58] You are the precious one.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; You are the reason for our gathering.
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; You are the one we desire to please.
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; We love you. Father, thank you again, oh
[2:39:09] Lord, for gathering us here this
[2:39:10] morning. We know like everything else
[2:39:13] that you do, you had a purpose.
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; You called us to talk to us. You called
[2:39:18] us to reveal yourself to us like a
[2:39:20] husband to a wife. Father, we love you
[2:39:23] for that, oh Lord, for father not
[2:39:25] holding anything back, oh Lord, for
[2:39:27] declaring you the entirety of your
[2:39:29] purpose for this life to us. Oh Lord, we
[2:39:32] pray that you will help us, that will
[2:39:34] not take it lightly, oh Lord, that we'll
[2:39:36] go forward knowing what are your
[2:39:39] desires, what you love, but and what you
[2:39:42] have empowered us to do to please you,
[2:39:44] oh Lord, and just hold on to it, Father.
[2:39:47] Be completely sealed out of the world,
[2:39:49] oh God. Completely focused on you,
[2:39:51] Father. Because we have come this far
[2:39:53] believing in your precious promises,
[2:39:56] Lord. And father, you've always
[2:39:58] vindicated your word. And that is why we
[2:40:00] are who we are. We know you spoke from
[2:40:02] the foundation of the earth, oh Lord,
[2:40:04] and brought us to be, Father, to serve
[2:40:07] your purpose, oh God. Help us to please
[2:40:09] you every step of the way in everything
[2:40:11] that we do. Father, let our desire be to
[2:40:14] please you, Lord, because that is how
[2:40:16] you made us. That is how you called us,
[2:40:17] Father. And as we venture and consider
[2:40:20] the sacred institution of marriage, oh
[2:40:23] Lord,
[2:40:26] may we seek to uphold your word above
[2:40:29] our
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; desires.
[2:40:33] It's just frightening the way things are
[2:40:35] going, Father. But we know with your
[2:40:37] strength, we have already made it.
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; And so we say glory be to your name.
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray for my brother Dawn. May
[2:40:45] you continue to strengthen him. May you
[2:40:48] continue to make him an example of why
[2:40:50] you intended to the relationship between
[2:40:53] yourself and your bride to be
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; bless his family.
[2:40:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, Father, he's he's put himself out
[2:40:59] there. The devil will not leave him
[2:41:01] alone.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; But he knows already that victory is
[2:41:04] yours.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; And so, Father, have your way. Not just
[2:41:07] in the life of my brother, but every
[2:41:09] single soul in this congregation. Lord,
[2:41:11] help us all to be completely focused on
[2:41:13] you. not be distracted by the selfless
[2:41:17] selfishness that is going on in the
[2:41:18] world. Oh Lord, but to understand that
[2:41:21] every aspect of this institution is a
[2:41:24] sacrifice.
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; The father's sacrifice, the mother's
[2:41:27] sacrifice, that children's sacrifice.
[2:41:29] Help us, Lord, oh Lord, to be pleasing
[2:41:31] to you. We love and appreciate your
[2:41:34] precious savior. Even as we go out,
[2:41:36] Father, may you lead us. May you bless
[2:41:38] us throughout the week. Help us to
[2:41:40] reflect once more on why you've called
[2:41:42] us
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; and what the purpose for which you were
[2:41:45] called. Oh Lord, be with our pastor and
[2:41:47] those brethren in that bridge. Oh Lord,
[2:41:50] bless them, oh God. And at your
[2:41:51] appointed time, bring us all together
[2:41:53] again. In Jesus Christ's name do we
[2:41:55] pray.
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:42:04] blessed I have decided to follow Jesus.
