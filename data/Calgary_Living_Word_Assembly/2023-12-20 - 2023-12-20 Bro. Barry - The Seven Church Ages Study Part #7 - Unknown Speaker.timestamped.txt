[47:15] Lord to go from that oh
[47:18] my we have a tremendous testimony
[47:22] coming tomorrow is the uh first day of
[47:25] winter and that means that the days will
[47:28] now as the saying say is the days will
[47:31] be getting longer we know there's only
[47:32] 24 hours in a day but uh the daylight
[47:36] will actually start to get longer we'll
[47:39] have more and more Daylight right up
[47:41] until the 21st of June so we're uh we're
[47:45] enduring our our darkest day today and
[47:47] tomorrow and uh you know it's a bit like
[47:50] the scriptural thing spiritually
[47:53] speaking we're dealing with the darkest
[47:55] of days but we know the days will get
[47:57] longer and uh brighter are you happy
[48:01] tonight I just want to get into the
[48:04] exposition of the seven Church ages and
[48:06] carry on with it it's the I believe it's
[48:09] the eth eighth time that we have gotten
[48:12] into it and I'm thinking by the way this
[48:14] is going there'll probably be like
[48:16] 800 times that we'll talk about it but
[48:19] we'll just see what the Lord has in
[48:22] store um I really do want to try and
[48:25] actually start to make progress with it
[48:27] I don't want to just um cabbage down on
[48:30] individual statements but I think some
[48:32] of them are so important we really have
[48:34] to to make sure that we get the full
[48:36] value of it um I really do want to
[48:39] comment a little bit tonight about
[48:41] Sunday and Saturday the the weekend had
[48:44] so much to unpack and I really
[48:47] appreciated brother Cadre being here and
[48:49] you know many times an evangelist he
[48:51] does say things that a pastor maybe
[48:53] wants to say but can't say say or or
[48:56] won't say and uh you know if anyone was
[48:59] upset or offended by the things that
[49:01] were said on on on Sunday or even on
[49:05] Saturday then I I think we should
[49:08] probably have a conversation I would
[49:09] like to say I'm sorry because I don't
[49:12] want to see anybody get upset but um
[49:15] sometimes we need a spanking in our
[49:16] lives and spiritually speaking that's
[49:19] what we need that's what's going to keep
[49:21] us healthy that's what's going to keep
[49:22] us happy that's why the word of God says
[49:25] Des spare not the rod and if you do that
[49:29] if you try and actually do it a
[49:30] different way you're going to spoil the
[49:32] children children need to be corrected
[49:35] and and if we're Sons and Daughters of
[49:36] God then we need to be corrected and if
[49:38] we're not willing to receive that
[49:39] correction then we're not Sons and
[49:41] Daughters of God that's the way it works
[49:43] I I personally don't believe anything
[49:45] came over the weekend that wasn't
[49:46] according to the word of God in fact I
[49:48] think it went so good with the word of
[49:51] God and you know brothers and sisters
[49:53] when when the word of God comes on the
[49:56] scene when the spirit Falls in a service
[49:58] that's the time to reach out and touch
[50:00] the lord it's one thing to say Amen to
[50:03] the word as it's happening but when we
[50:06] have a need in our lives and the spirit
[50:07] of God Falls that's the time to get what
[50:10] you need and you can hear it said over
[50:13] and over and over again by the prophet
[50:16] you know that's the spirit that's that's
[50:18] the Holy Spirit get what you need he's
[50:21] here now stand to your feet and give him
[50:23] glory and we had the opportunity on on
[50:25] on Sunday it was just such a tremendous
[50:27] service I I think it was incredible
[50:30] because you know what was happening I
[50:32] just want to be real clear tonight to
[50:35] everyone there was discernment happening
[50:38] that was the word of God being quick and
[50:41] powerful and dividing the soul and the
[50:44] spirit brothers and sisters going well
[50:46] beyond what we think in our minds and
[50:49] our souls that was the word of God
[50:51] showing that there is something
[50:53] happening here now some people might say
[50:55] carnally speaking brother contre he was
[50:57] asking for money so how how spiritual
[50:59] was that you know the word of God the
[51:02] the the prophet for our day he said ask
[51:04] big and we know the word of God says to
[51:07] ask that our Joys might be
[51:09] full right so what I want to say tonight
[51:13] though is that it was tremendously
[51:15] powerful and it wasn't just an emotional
[51:17] workup for some people it might have
[51:19] been just an emotional workup and I I
[51:21] I'm sorry if that's all it was for you
[51:23] but you know for others it was the word
[51:26] of God it was God speaking directly to
[51:29] needs in people's lives and you know
[51:31] I'll say it again tonight maybe on
[51:33] record brothers and sisters I never had
[51:35] a conversation with brother Cadre and
[51:37] said please go and and preach on this
[51:39] and and and you know we have these needs
[51:41] over here there's there's this brother
[51:43] and this sister and this thing and that
[51:46] other problem and situation there's none
[51:48] of that and I want to be real clear and
[51:51] fact Saturday night I said to him you
[51:54] know there's these things and he said
[51:57] brother don't say a word let's talk
[51:59] after service on Sunday let's let God do
[52:02] the work yes so if we have any questions
[52:05] or concerns brothers and sisters I want
[52:07] to say it loud and proud and clear you
[52:10] heard from
[52:12] God now it's up to you with what you do
[52:15] with that word that God gave you I know
[52:18] I heard from
[52:19] him I could I could say this need that
[52:22] need this need that need this thing that
[52:24] thing the other thing but you
[52:26] know you know amen it was not a
[52:30] conversation it wasn't we need to deal
[52:32] with I just can't get over how how how
[52:36] brilliant and precise it was on Sunday
[52:39] like I said if anybody's got any
[52:40] questions or concerns let's let's talk
[52:42] about it but I want to I want to I want
[52:44] to just be real clear about the one
[52:45] thing that brother Cadre did talk about
[52:47] and that was the money thing you know we
[52:50] didn't send them home with $20,000 we
[52:52] just can't afford that um perhaps maybe
[52:54] if anybody feels led to we could take up
[52:56] an offering for the dear brother he he
[52:58] relies on evangelism that's his sole
[53:00] source of income he doesn't work in fact
[53:02] he's tried to work and he can't get a
[53:04] job God will not allow the man to work
[53:07] he's only doing
[53:09] evangelism so anyways um just wanted to
[53:12] bring a couple quotes just to be very
[53:14] clear about what you know he was talking
[53:16] about because some people who are stuck
[53:19] on money it could sound like it's super
[53:21] carnal and how could that ever be
[53:22] anything but you know let's let's just
[53:24] bring up the first quote Brothers if you
[53:27] if you got it did you get it it's 1955
[53:30] where I think Pentecost failed brother
[53:32] Bram says this and God will never you
[53:35] can never exhaust God's love and mercy
[53:37] to you you say well I hate to I hate I
[53:42] hate to bother you so much
[53:44] father he says he wants to be bothered
[53:48] that way he
[53:50] does don't never think that you could
[53:53] ever ask too much of God
[53:56] I believe the scripture said you have
[53:58] not because you ask not and you ask not
[54:01] because you believe
[54:04] not he wants us to ask and believe that
[54:07] our Joys would be
[54:09] full he wants you to ask
[54:13] abundantly ask for big
[54:16] things don't limit your faith to some
[54:19] little Mustard
[54:21] Seed get on out here to some other kind
[54:24] of faith and move out and big things ask
[54:28] big things is just as easy to receive as
[54:31] little
[54:33] things you just have to believe that's
[54:37] all and you got faith just know exactly
[54:40] how to use it and it'll all be right
[54:43] it'll be all right you can put it right
[54:45] to work and it'll be just
[54:49] fine I just want to say if we are asking
[54:52] for something why do we want
[54:54] it I'll be real clear brother Cadre told
[54:57] me a little bit and uh you know maybe
[54:59] it's too much to say it but just because
[55:01] of the money thing brother Cadre wants
[55:04] to be able to do things with his family
[55:06] he wants to be able to be a grandpa he
[55:09] wants to be able to to be a good daddy
[55:11] he wants to be able to do nice things
[55:13] for his family and he's just cutting it
[55:15] from Bill to Bill to Bill to Bill and
[55:17] many times in our lives that's the way
[55:19] we can be and if you've ever been there
[55:20] you know exactly how he feels it's not a
[55:24] fun place to be
[55:25] just when you think maybe you're going
[55:27] to get ahead there's another unexpected
[55:29] expense bill that has to be paid it's
[55:32] got to be dealt with and it's really
[55:34] frustrating and and it's been that way
[55:36] for a long time for brother Cadre and
[55:38] and you know what God's dealing with him
[55:40] the way he needs to but I I just want to
[55:42] be clear that you know he wasn't
[55:44] misquoting the scripture and he wasn't
[55:45] misquoting the message we need to be
[55:47] able to ask big and you know God will
[55:50] give it to us but why are we asking is
[55:53] the key that's what the prophet said
[55:55] says I'm not going to get into why
[55:56] tonight but you know in James it says
[55:58] that many times we ask a Miss because we
[56:01] want to consume it upon the lust of our
[56:03] flesh I I want a better job so so I can
[56:06] have a bigger house so I can have better
[56:09] clothes maybe I want better finer food
[56:12] in my fridge maybe I want to do this
[56:15] maybe I want that but you know we we
[56:18] were talking about faith over the
[56:19] weekend and I said to brother kadre on
[56:21] the way out of here Saturday night I
[56:23] said you know we can ask about those
[56:25] things and and if we're asking because
[56:27] we want to provide for our family the
[56:30] right things if we want to make sure
[56:31] that our family knows there's milk in
[56:33] the fridge that there's there's there's
[56:34] bread in the cupboard we're we're going
[56:36] to have lunch we're going to have supper
[56:37] we know we don't have to worry about
[56:39] those things that's that's one thing but
[56:41] if we're asking about other things just
[56:43] because we want to look good or or or or
[56:45] sound good or maybe just feel good we
[56:48] want to you know we can ask about things
[56:50] the wrong way but what I said to brother
[56:52] kadre when we when we start asking about
[56:54] the salvation of our children we start
[56:56] bringing those prayer requests before
[56:58] the Lord when we start asking about the
[57:01] things that really mean uh Eternal value
[57:04] the things that will will last forever
[57:06] when we start asking our heavenly father
[57:08] for things like that brothers and
[57:10] sisters that's when I believe we're
[57:12] going to see tremendous action happen
[57:14] because we're not asking about it for
[57:16] ourselves we're not looking to consume
[57:18] it upon the lust of our flesh who cares
[57:20] what kind of a house we have amen our
[57:23] children saved
[57:26] that's what we
[57:27] want the next one out of hear ye him
[57:30] brother Bram in 1956 12:15 he says and
[57:34] don't never be afraid to ask big things
[57:37] God wants you to ask big things he don't
[57:39] want you to be little petty and juvenile
[57:42] he wants you to ask big things that your
[57:44] Joys might be full amen could you
[57:47] imagine a little fish about that big way
[57:50] out yonder in the Atlantic Ocean say I
[57:52] better drink just a little bit of this
[57:54] water I might run run out he says
[57:57] nonsense and remember I'm just going to
[57:59] throw this in there this is just for
[58:01] free tonight from Brother Barry remember
[58:03] in the story of sister Hatty Wright
[58:06] operating the third
[58:07] poll brother bradam said the Holy Spirit
[58:11] told me to tell you you said the right
[58:13] thing you pleased the holy
[58:15] spirit so what do you want do you want
[58:18] some money do you want a a million
[58:20] dollars you could have a million dollars
[58:22] right
[58:23] now so money isn't off the table if you
[58:28] really want to talk about money he says
[58:31] could you imagine a little mouse about
[58:33] that big down there in the great Garners
[58:34] of Egypt saying I just better eat two
[58:37] grains a day because I might run out
[58:39] before summertime again well that's
[58:42] nonsense if they had 1000,000 rats that
[58:45] size they'd never eat it up and they had
[58:48] billions times billions of tons of them
[58:50] fish they'd never drink the water up and
[58:53] how many times
[58:55] could we
[58:56] multiply you could never exhaust God in
[58:59] his powers and his mercies to his
[59:02] children he's the inexhaustible Fountain
[59:05] of Life just drink and drink and drink
[59:08] and
[59:09] drink I just love
[59:12] that one more one more
[59:16] 1960 0729 what it takes to overcome all
[59:22] unbelief our faith
[59:25] he says now how are we planted we're
[59:28] planted in Christ Jesus amen now I
[59:31] believe just in my estimation of him
[59:34] he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[59:37] that you cannot exhaust his goodness
[59:40] some people think oh I hate to call on
[59:42] God so much that's what he wants you to
[59:45] do you have not because you ask not you
[59:49] ask not because you believe not ask
[59:53] abundantly
[59:55] that your joy your Joys might be full
[59:59] that's what God wants ask big
[1:00:02] things he says I'm asking for 100 souls
[1:00:04] in this meeting I'm asking that every
[1:00:07] sick person enters that door will go out
[1:00:10] of here well I'm believing it I'm
[1:00:13] believing that till we go that this
[1:00:16] won't be another gathering together but
[1:00:18] it'll be a Revival here in yaka here and
[1:00:21] I just want to say I'm I'm believing too
[1:00:24] I'm believing till that we go that this
[1:00:26] won't be another gathering together but
[1:00:29] it'll be a Revival here in Calgary here
[1:00:32] too let's ask big brothers and sisters
[1:00:36] amen we don't have to be cautious and
[1:00:40] careful let's ask big out of the
[1:00:43] abundance of that Spirit that's inside
[1:00:45] of
[1:00:46] us we don't have to be afraid but I know
[1:00:49] we get afraid when maybe we're not right
[1:00:51] with the Lord or something isn't right
[1:00:52] in our lives but we don't need to be be
[1:00:54] afraid just make sure that we know where
[1:00:57] we stand and just die out to ourselves
[1:01:00] we know we always have this other part
[1:01:02] too I'm going to throw this in there we
[1:01:04] we've got a March God can't bless us if
[1:01:06] we just sit down if we just sit in a
[1:01:08] chair and do nothing God's not going to
[1:01:11] just re our blessing Out of Heaven upon
[1:01:13] us we've got to get out of bed in the
[1:01:15] morning and we've got to March forwards
[1:01:16] brothers and sisters but it's when we're
[1:01:18] moving when we're doing when we're
[1:01:19] acting and up and doing is what brother
[1:01:22] brandham says that's where God will
[1:01:23] bless us
[1:01:27] amen getting into our scripture
[1:01:30] tonight behold I send you Elijah the
[1:01:33] prophet amen I just want to really
[1:01:36] emphasize that that's that's what we're
[1:01:38] talking about that's what this
[1:01:39] exposition of the seven Church ages is
[1:01:41] the beginning part of the Book of
[1:01:43] Revelation the the the book in the Bible
[1:01:46] the the first three chapters of
[1:01:48] Revelation talks about the church ages
[1:01:51] and uh God sends Elijah to the Earth
[1:01:56] before the great and terrible Dreadful
[1:01:58] day of the Lord and we know that he
[1:02:00] turns the hearts of the children back to
[1:02:02] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and
[1:02:05] and that's what's happened already it's
[1:02:06] not going to happen amen some people
[1:02:09] many people in this world you could show
[1:02:10] them that scripture in Malachi and say
[1:02:12] to them you know when is that going to
[1:02:14] happen and and they'll say well we don't
[1:02:15] know you know maybe sometime maybe in
[1:02:19] Palestine or something like that some
[1:02:21] sometime out in the future but we know
[1:02:23] that he's the not not the I was or the I
[1:02:26] will be he's the I am and the Believers
[1:02:29] see him that way we we don't want to put
[1:02:32] him off into the future sometime and say
[1:02:34] well sometime Elijah is going to come
[1:02:36] and we don't want to go back and say you
[1:02:38] know Elijah's already come so whatever's
[1:02:40] going to happen is going to happen
[1:02:42] there's nothing that can happen no no no
[1:02:44] we don't want to be ignoring what he's
[1:02:46] doing right now because he is he is
[1:02:49] alive and well
[1:02:51] Hallelujah today if you you will hear
[1:02:54] his voice hard and not your hearts
[1:02:57] brothers and sisters I think it's so
[1:02:59] beautiful because when we hear the word
[1:03:00] of God does it does it encourage us does
[1:03:03] it excite us does it give us the desire
[1:03:05] to press in to drink in and drink in and
[1:03:08] drink in or do we get a little bit
[1:03:10] uneasy with it you know the word of God
[1:03:12] is quick and and Powerful quick means
[1:03:16] alive the word of God is alive a and it
[1:03:20] is a living breathing person the word of
[1:03:23] God and I just was thinking about it how
[1:03:25] wonderful it is when we hear fantastic
[1:03:28] preaching like we did on the weekend
[1:03:29] when it's the word of God that's coming
[1:03:31] forward from the pulpit brothers and
[1:03:33] sisters that is God Discerning he's he's
[1:03:36] quick and he's powerful and he's
[1:03:38] Discerning he's sharper than any
[1:03:40] two-edged sword he's he's breaking down
[1:03:43] the soul and the spirit and getting past
[1:03:46] the joints in the M getting past all the
[1:03:48] fleshy thoughts getting past all of our
[1:03:50] spirits and and and our own ways our own
[1:03:53] traditions our own thinking and getting
[1:03:56] right down into the soul of the man and
[1:03:59] what it's doing is Discerning the
[1:04:01] thoughts and the intents of our hearts
[1:04:03] and and you know I think it's so
[1:04:05] beautiful because right now even right
[1:04:07] now it is Discerning the thoughts and
[1:04:09] the intents of every single human
[1:04:10] being's heart in this building right now
[1:04:13] he knows exactly what we're thinking he
[1:04:15] knows exactly why we're thinking it
[1:04:17] because the word of God is sharp it's
[1:04:20] quick and and alive and it's powerful
[1:04:22] and sharper able to to just get right
[1:04:25] down to the nitty-gritty in our lives
[1:04:27] like why are we here remember the
[1:04:29] prophet of God said our thoughts our
[1:04:31] thoughts are louder in heaven than our
[1:04:34] voice is here on Earth my goodness
[1:04:37] that's pretty powerful yes you know out
[1:04:40] of the Amplified Bible Hebrews 4:12 it
[1:04:43] says for the word of God speaks that for
[1:04:46] the word that God speaks is alive and
[1:04:50] full of power isn't that beautiful to
[1:04:53] think think about the word that God
[1:04:55] speaks and and we have the ability when
[1:04:58] we listen to the message of the hour to
[1:05:00] hear the word of God speak a and we have
[1:05:04] the ability to hear an evangelist preach
[1:05:08] we we are listening to the word that God
[1:05:10] speaks when we have a a teacher we are
[1:05:13] listening to the word that God speaks
[1:05:16] it's alive and full of
[1:05:18] power when a pastor is preaching it is
[1:05:21] the word of God that speaks speaking
[1:05:24] brothers and sisters it's not just a man
[1:05:26] Hallelujah and what is it doing it goes
[1:05:28] on to say making it active operative
[1:05:32] energizing and effective it's supposed
[1:05:35] to do something to us and I I know it's
[1:05:38] beautiful because even though I'll say
[1:05:40] it's supposed to it does every single
[1:05:44] time we hear the word of God preach
[1:05:45] brothers and sisters it changes us from
[1:05:48] glory to glory it it gives us the
[1:05:51] ability to actually see ourselves who
[1:05:54] who he sees us to be goes on to say it
[1:05:57] is sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:06:00] penetrating to the dividing line of the
[1:06:03] Breath of Life Soul and that Immortal
[1:06:08] spirit I think they've got this
[1:06:10] backwards myself that's my
[1:06:13] opinion because I believe the soul is
[1:06:16] what's Immortal the spirit isn't but
[1:06:20] maybe they're talking about the uh
[1:06:22] spirit of the Lord and we'll maybe take
[1:06:25] it that way it's sharper than any
[1:06:27] two-edged sword penetrating to the
[1:06:28] dividing line of the Breath of Life Soul
[1:06:32] in Brackets and the immortal spirit and
[1:06:35] of joints and Marrow of the deepest
[1:06:39] parts of our
[1:06:41] nature
[1:06:43] exposing and sifting and analyzing and
[1:06:48] judging the very thoughts and purposes
[1:06:52] of the heart
[1:06:55] personally I think that's just amazing
[1:06:57] because it takes us to a level the word
[1:06:59] of God takes us to a level that we can't
[1:07:02] even get to on our own amen yes maybe we
[1:07:05] can go on our knees and actually spend
[1:07:07] time in prayer a and the spirit will
[1:07:09] actually Quicken and speak through us
[1:07:11] but for us to just sit down with a book
[1:07:13] and a pen and maybe try and magnify our
[1:07:16] thoughts and try and get to a place
[1:07:18] where we can actually get to that that
[1:07:20] that Soul realm it's it's not it's not
[1:07:23] quite as easy as that it's not a human
[1:07:25] thing we can't do that on our own I just
[1:07:28] think it's beautiful brothers and
[1:07:30] sisters what happened here on Sunday was
[1:07:32] nothing short of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:35] walking passing not our Gentle Savior
[1:07:39] and hearing our cries and knowing
[1:07:41] exactly what we need I think it's just
[1:07:44] amazing if you have any questions about
[1:07:46] it come and see me we'll uh be happy to
[1:07:48] talk about
[1:07:50] it are you okay
[1:07:52] tonight I just like to pick up with h
[1:07:55] where we left off and that's why I just
[1:07:57] think it's so beautiful it's it's like a
[1:07:59] hand to a glove you know um I never told
[1:08:01] Brother kadre Where I Was preaching from
[1:08:03] I never told him we were talking about
[1:08:05] Hebrews chapter 12 and and 11 I mean and
[1:08:09] talking about faith and and how it's
[1:08:11] impossible to please God without faith
[1:08:14] and and we never talked about any of
[1:08:16] that paragraph 61 of the exposition of
[1:08:19] the seven Church ages in the revelation
[1:08:21] of Jes Jesus Christ where where we left
[1:08:24] off last week is the ability to discern
[1:08:26] the heart thoughts in men made the elect
[1:08:30] of God to understand that here was the
[1:08:34] Messiah the anointed word of God Amen
[1:08:38] the disciples were able to recognize
[1:08:41] this is not an ordinary man when Jesus
[1:08:44] Christ came on the scene a and for three
[1:08:46] and a half years began to minister the
[1:08:49] grace of God to human beings isn't it
[1:08:53] interesting that it really only was
[1:08:54] three and A2 years that he did that and
[1:08:57] Messiah was cut off it's pretty bizarre
[1:09:00] that a whole book would be written as
[1:09:02] big as it is about him in three and a
[1:09:04] half years but it's nothing but the
[1:09:07] truth Hebrews 4:12 in this book it says
[1:09:10] for the word of God is quick and
[1:09:11] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:09:13] sword piercing even to the defining
[1:09:15] aunder of Soul and Spirit and the joints
[1:09:18] and Marrow and it is a discerner of the
[1:09:21] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:09:25] next paragraph says when the woman at
[1:09:27] the well heard him discern the thoughts
[1:09:30] of her heart she acclaimed him a prophet
[1:09:35] declaring that Messiah would be known
[1:09:38] for that great
[1:09:40] ability now we'll go on and we'll read
[1:09:42] this story here and uh we've still got a
[1:09:44] bit of time but I just want to I want to
[1:09:47] dwell just on that I want to see where
[1:09:49] the rubber meets the road and I I just
[1:09:51] couldn't help but visualize it myself
[1:09:54] when we were in service and it's just me
[1:09:56] brothers and sisters maybe I have a a
[1:09:58] weird way but you know I just kept help
[1:10:01] kept thinking this is the rubber
[1:10:03] meetting the road and if anybody has
[1:10:05] ever driven in a car where you can
[1:10:07] actually spin the tires and squeal them
[1:10:09] you can hear that rubber hitting the
[1:10:11] road that's what I was thinking and
[1:10:13] feeling like this is acceleration in a
[1:10:16] spiritual level and this must be maybe
[1:10:18] something similar in a different way
[1:10:20] that this woman at the well was was
[1:10:22] feeling something is happen happening
[1:10:24] here there's a there's there's there's
[1:10:25] something I've never experienced before
[1:10:27] in my life this man is telling me all
[1:10:29] about my life but someone had taught her
[1:10:32] somewhere along the way that someone
[1:10:34] will come around and be able to do that
[1:10:37] and that will be the sign of the
[1:10:39] Messiah and I want to say this brothers
[1:10:42] and sisters if God spoke to you on
[1:10:44] Sunday that was the sign of the
[1:10:48] Messiah that was the sign of the Lord
[1:10:50] Jesus Christ yes don't dismiss it don't
[1:10:54] say it's carnal say be blessed be the
[1:10:58] name of the Lord be it unto me that that
[1:11:00] that that speaks to my soul that speaks
[1:11:02] to my nature I need to hear from the
[1:11:05] Lord I know he spoke to
[1:11:07] me the scripture here it says there
[1:11:10] cometh a woman out of Samaria to draw
[1:11:12] water Jesus saith unto her give me a
[1:11:14] drink for his disciples were gone away
[1:11:17] into the city to buy
[1:11:20] meat then saith the woman of Samaria
[1:11:22] unto him how is it that thou being a Jew
[1:11:25] ask askest a
[1:11:27] drink asked drink of me which am a woman
[1:11:32] of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings
[1:11:34] with the
[1:11:35] Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto
[1:11:37] her if thou knewest the gift of God and
[1:11:41] who it is that saith to thee give me to
[1:11:45] drink thou wouldst have asked of him and
[1:11:48] he would have given thee Living
[1:11:50] Water the woman saith unto him sir thou
[1:11:53] Hast nothing to draw with and the well
[1:11:55] is deep from whence then hast thou that
[1:11:59] Living
[1:12:00] Water art thou greater than our father
[1:12:03] Jacob which gave us the well and drank
[1:12:06] thereof himself and his children and his
[1:12:11] cattle Jesus answered and said unto
[1:12:14] her whosoever drinketh of this water
[1:12:17] shall thirst
[1:12:19] again but whosoever drinketh of the
[1:12:22] water that I shall give him shall never
[1:12:24] thirst but the water that I shall give
[1:12:27] him shall be in him a well of water
[1:12:31] springing up into everlasting
[1:12:35] life the woman saith unto him sir give
[1:12:38] me this water that I thirst not neither
[1:12:40] come hither to
[1:12:42] draw Jesus saith unto her go call thy
[1:12:45] husband and come hither the woman
[1:12:47] answered and said I have no husband
[1:12:49] Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said
[1:12:52] I have no husband hband for thou Hast
[1:12:54] had five husbands and and he whom thou
[1:12:59] now Hast is not thy husband in that
[1:13:03] saidst thou
[1:13:04] truly the woman saith unto him sir I
[1:13:07] perceive thou art a
[1:13:09] prophet our fathers worshiped in this
[1:13:12] mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is
[1:13:14] the place where men ought to worship
[1:13:17] Jesus saith unto her woman believe me
[1:13:20] the hour cometh when ye shall neither
[1:13:23] neither in this mountain nor yet at
[1:13:25] Jerusalem worship the father ye worship
[1:13:29] ye know not
[1:13:31] what we know what we worship for
[1:13:34] salvation is of the Jews amen but the
[1:13:38] hour cometh and now is when the true
[1:13:41] worshippers shall worship the father in
[1:13:43] spirit and in
[1:13:45] truth for the father seeketh such to
[1:13:47] worship him God is a spirit and they
[1:13:51] that worship Him must wor worship Him in
[1:13:54] spirit and in truth the woman saith unto
[1:13:58] him I know that Messiah cometh which is
[1:14:02] called Christ when he is come he will
[1:14:05] tell us all things see she was taught
[1:14:09] right Jesus saith unto
[1:14:12] her I that speak unto thee am he it's
[1:14:17] John
[1:14:18] 472 4: 7-26 isn't that amazing isn't
[1:14:22] that what every anybody wants to hear I
[1:14:25] that speak unto thee am
[1:14:28] he just
[1:14:30] tremendous Revelations
[1:14:32] 15:3 and they sang the song of Moses the
[1:14:36] servant of God the song of the lamb
[1:14:39] saying great and marvelous are thy Works
[1:14:42] Lord God Almighty just and true are thy
[1:14:46] ways Thou King of
[1:14:48] saints now brother Ram goes on to say do
[1:14:51] you see it the lamb the high high priest
[1:14:54] holding his blood as atonement on The
[1:14:56] Mercy Seat for our sins is the Lord God
[1:15:01] Almighty
[1:15:03] amen it's not a different person it's
[1:15:06] the Lord God
[1:15:09] Almighty that is his present office that
[1:15:12] is what he is doing now pleading his
[1:15:17] blood for our sins amen but one day that
[1:15:21] lamb will become the lion of the tribe
[1:15:24] of Judah and you know brothers and
[1:15:26] sisters that's exactly where we talk
[1:15:28] about Malachi
[1:15:31] 4:5 be I'll send you Elijah before the
[1:15:34] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[1:15:36] when he steps from that Throne Mercy's
[1:15:39] over and we know that there's doctrines
[1:15:42] that say well he's already done that and
[1:15:43] so anybody that's in the lineage of
[1:15:46] whatever the family is they're the only
[1:15:47] ones that are saved and everyone else is
[1:15:49] outed and that's not true he's still
[1:15:52] calling
[1:15:53] the blood's still on The Mercy Seat
[1:15:55] tonight brothers and sisters we know
[1:15:57] that that's a a doctrine of a devil but
[1:16:01] he's not going to come as a roaring lion
[1:16:04] into our Our Lives we know that the word
[1:16:06] of God says that it will be so close
[1:16:08] that it would deceive the very elected
[1:16:10] if it were possible so it's going to be
[1:16:11] just like this it's going to be right in
[1:16:14] mixed in around the truth the only way
[1:16:16] we're going to be able to tell the
[1:16:17] difference is to actually have the Holy
[1:16:18] Ghost In Our
[1:16:20] Lives that's why I'd say it so much
[1:16:24] goes on to say but one day that lamb
[1:16:26] will become the lion of the tribe of
[1:16:27] Judah he will come forth in power and
[1:16:30] glory and take his authority to reign as
[1:16:32] king he is the coming King of the
[1:16:36] earth of course that does not say he is
[1:16:40] not King now for he is our king king of
[1:16:44] saints right now is a spiritual
[1:16:49] Kingdom it's not of this world system
[1:16:52] even even as we are not of this world
[1:16:55] that's the reason we act different from
[1:16:57] the
[1:16:58] world love this our citizenship is in
[1:17:03] heaven we reflect the spirit of the
[1:17:07] world of our rebirth where Jesus is the
[1:17:11] king
[1:17:12] amen that's that is why our women do not
[1:17:16] dress in men's clothing because the word
[1:17:18] of God says it's an Abomination so they
[1:17:20] don't do
[1:17:21] it or cut their hair because we know
[1:17:25] that that's their covering according to
[1:17:27] the word of God so they don't do
[1:17:30] it or use all those cosmetics and other
[1:17:33] things that the world likes so much
[1:17:36] because we know that there's only one
[1:17:38] girl that wore those Cosmetics like that
[1:17:41] in the Bible and her name was Jezebel
[1:17:43] amen and if you read the story of
[1:17:44] Jezebel it's not a good one right so
[1:17:49] that's why our women do not dress in
[1:17:51] men's clothing or cut their hair or use
[1:17:52] all those cosmetics and other things
[1:17:54] like the world likes so much that's why
[1:17:56] our men don't drink and smoke and carry
[1:17:59] on in sin our Dominion is the dominion
[1:18:03] over sin and in
[1:18:07] its and it is in force through the power
[1:18:11] that is in the spirit of Christ that
[1:18:14] indwells us so I want to say tonight
[1:18:18] brothers and sisters we have that
[1:18:20] strength when his spirit indwells us
[1:18:24] amen now some might say well brother
[1:18:26] Barry you have the Holy Spirit until the
[1:18:29] day of your Redemption until your
[1:18:31] destination and truly indeed you do but
[1:18:33] there's times where we do things that
[1:18:36] doesn't please the father right and when
[1:18:39] we do things that doesn't encourage the
[1:18:41] spirit of Christ in our lives brother
[1:18:43] bradam says it I don't have it tonight
[1:18:45] but he says it that that Holy Spirit is
[1:18:47] like a dove and it'll just go and sit up
[1:18:49] in a tree and just wait until we're done
[1:18:51] our fit with whatever it is is we're
[1:18:53] doing that's not pleasing of the Lord
[1:18:56] and when that happens brothers and
[1:18:57] sisters that allows the devil to come
[1:19:00] around our lives and that devil is going
[1:19:03] to come around our lives and he's going
[1:19:05] to affect our families he's going to
[1:19:08] affect maybe our jobs maybe our
[1:19:11] education maybe our friends maybe our
[1:19:15] families maybe church services but the
[1:19:17] devil's going to come around he's going
[1:19:18] to have the opportunity to get in our
[1:19:20] lives and mess with us but you know when
[1:19:23] we don't give them that
[1:19:25] opportunity when we say you know we only
[1:19:28] we're only going to eat sheep food we're
[1:19:30] only going to feed on the things that
[1:19:32] pleases the
[1:19:34] Lord that he doesn't have that ability
[1:19:37] our Dominion is the dominion over sin we
[1:19:40] heard it on the weekend brothers and
[1:19:42] sisters if the devil is anywhere else
[1:19:44] other than under our feet he's out of
[1:19:46] his position and the only reason he can
[1:19:48] get out of his position in our lives is
[1:19:50] because God allows it but when we submit
[1:19:53] ourselves therefore unto God first then
[1:19:56] resist the devil he'll
[1:19:59] flee we can't just resist the devil and
[1:20:01] he'll flee no there's an order to it
[1:20:04] first we have to submit ourselves unto
[1:20:07] God submit ourselves unto the word
[1:20:09] because that's God for us in our day our
[1:20:13] Dominion is the dominion over sin and it
[1:20:17] is in force through the power that is in
[1:20:21] the spirit of Christ that indwells us
[1:20:25] every Kingdom on Earth is going to be
[1:20:27] tore down but ours will
[1:20:30] remain why can you imagine
[1:20:34] that it's not our kingdom we know it's
[1:20:37] his kingdom but wow to be a citizen of
[1:20:40] that Kingdom just because he chose to
[1:20:43] give us a passport you get a passport
[1:20:45] you get a free pass you get to be a
[1:20:48] member of this Kingdom what a tremendous
[1:20:51] thing you go goes on to say now we've
[1:20:53] been talking about the offices and
[1:20:55] manifestations of the one true God and
[1:20:57] beholding His glory in a scriptural
[1:20:59] study but he is not to be known
[1:21:03] intellectually our critical thinking
[1:21:05] from University will not get us there
[1:21:08] our critical thinking from our family
[1:21:10] traditions will not get us there our
[1:21:12] critical thinking from a religious
[1:21:14] standpoint will not get us there the
[1:21:16] only way we'll get there is to know him
[1:21:18] by his spirit amen goes on to say he is
[1:21:22] known spiritually by spiritual
[1:21:25] Revelation this same one who was known
[1:21:28] as Jesus after the flesh went back to
[1:21:31] the pillar of fire that's why brothers
[1:21:34] and sisters I'm going to emphasize this
[1:21:35] tonight really hard when we see the
[1:21:38] picture of William maryi and brano I
[1:21:40] don't know if you do you have it there
[1:21:41] brother Logan the the pillar of fire
[1:21:43] picture when we see that picture
[1:21:45] brothers and sisters don't look at it
[1:21:47] and think well that's just a man he's
[1:21:48] got a halo over his head don't don't
[1:21:50] look at it and think well it's just God
[1:21:52] identifying himself with a man what it
[1:21:55] is is God identifying himself with men
[1:21:59] it's God showing himself that he has
[1:22:01] gone back to that Pillar of Fire like
[1:22:02] we're reading here and he's making
[1:22:04] himself known to
[1:22:09] humankind I'll just keep on reading but
[1:22:11] if you've got it there just just bring
[1:22:13] it up if if not don't worry about it
[1:22:14] it's not a big deal that's really
[1:22:16] putting you on the spot I
[1:22:19] know goes on to say but he promised that
[1:22:22] he would would come again and dwell
[1:22:24] amongst his people by the
[1:22:26] spirit and isn't it so beautiful when
[1:22:28] you look at this brothers and sisters
[1:22:30] and on the day of Pentecost that Pillar
[1:22:32] of Fire came down and it separated its s
[1:22:35] in tongues of fire upon each one of them
[1:22:38] what was God doing he was separating
[1:22:40] himself into the church giving all those
[1:22:42] men and women a part of himself he
[1:22:44] divided himself amongst his church just
[1:22:46] as he said he would that's why I think
[1:22:49] that Pillar of Fire picture is so
[1:22:51] powerful if you don't have one in your
[1:22:54] house it might be good to get one just
[1:22:55] so you can actually look at it and say
[1:22:58] wow this is the same Jesus Christ that
[1:23:01] was back there on the road to Damascus
[1:23:03] that knocked Saul off of his horse and
[1:23:05] told him you're are not going to be
[1:23:07] called Saul anymore you're going to be a
[1:23:08] new creature in Christ Jesus you're
[1:23:12] going to have a new
[1:23:13] experience but it was the same Pillar of
[1:23:16] Fire he divided himself there he divided
[1:23:18] himself on the day of Pentecost and he's
[1:23:20] divided himself again in this last
[1:23:23] Gentile age to show that he is the same
[1:23:25] yesterday today and
[1:23:28] forever so going on reading here and I
[1:23:31] will pray the father and he shall give
[1:23:32] you another comforter that he may abide
[1:23:35] with you forever even the spirit of
[1:23:37] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:23:40] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[1:23:42] him not but ye know him for he dwelleth
[1:23:45] with you and shall be in you and I will
[1:23:49] not leave you comfortless I will come to
[1:23:51] you for yet a little while and the world
[1:23:53] seeth me no more but ye see me because I
[1:23:56] live ye shall live also and at that day
[1:24:01] ye shall know that I am in my father and
[1:24:03] ye in me and I in you why if you ever
[1:24:08] want to talk about a trinity I would say
[1:24:10] that's it right there
[1:24:12] hey I am in the father and ye in me and
[1:24:17] I in
[1:24:19] you he that hath known my Commandments
[1:24:21] and keep with
[1:24:25] them he it is that loveth me amen and he
[1:24:30] that loveth me shall be loved of my
[1:24:32] father and I will love him and will
[1:24:34] manifest myself to
[1:24:37] him Judas saith unto him not a scariot
[1:24:41] lord how is it that thou Wilt manifest
[1:24:43] thyself unto us and not unto the world
[1:24:47] Jesus answered and said unto him if a
[1:24:49] man love me he will keep my words and my
[1:24:53] father will love him and we will come
[1:24:56] unto him and make our Abode with him how
[1:25:00] many want him to make his Abode with you
[1:25:05] tonight goes on to say he said he would
[1:25:08] pray the father who would send another
[1:25:11] comforter who was with them the
[1:25:14] disciples already but not in them that
[1:25:17] was Christ then in verse 23 speaking of
[1:25:20] himself and the father he said said we
[1:25:23] will come there it is the spirit is
[1:25:27] coming the same spirit of God that
[1:25:30] manifested as the father and as the son
[1:25:35] and will yet manifest in the many one
[1:25:39] God who is
[1:25:42] Spirit that's why no man can ever come
[1:25:45] along and say the holy man is a pope or
[1:25:49] the holy man is a bishop or priest and I
[1:25:52] want to say this the holy man is maybe
[1:25:55] an evangelist with a gift of discernment
[1:25:58] brothers and sisters it's the same Jesus
[1:26:00] Christ in a regular service with any
[1:26:04] Ministry behind the pulpit it's up to
[1:26:06] the people and their
[1:26:09] expectations the spirit that is inside
[1:26:11] of us to pull Upon A gift there's no
[1:26:15] holy men there's no great ministry in
[1:26:17] this world there's Jesus Christ
[1:26:20] amenallah
[1:26:23] I I'm just going to say it I wasn't
[1:26:25] really going to get into it but I will
[1:26:27] just for fun you know I I think
[1:26:30] sometimes it's it's good just to touch
[1:26:32] on things I was listening to a message
[1:26:34] discernment of spirit and uh brother
[1:26:37] bradam was talking
[1:26:40] about the discernment of spirit and and
[1:26:43] how the spirit is what discerns and uh
[1:26:47] it it's so good because he says it in
[1:26:49] there that there's no holy men there's
[1:26:51] nobody that's actually the holy person
[1:26:54] it's just Jesus
[1:26:55] Christ a and the motive and objective of
[1:26:58] the Man shows the inspiration that's
[1:27:01] behind him amen it's not about just
[1:27:04] knowing the word of God and being able
[1:27:06] to quote the word of God and being able
[1:27:09] to demonstrate a a Christian walk to the
[1:27:12] world around us it's actually being able
[1:27:15] to live it and every once in a while you
[1:27:17] get to say a word or two because people
[1:27:19] want to hear it but it's the life that
[1:27:21] we live live that actually demonstrates
[1:27:24] it but the Bram says that's why no man
[1:27:27] can ever come along and say the holy man
[1:27:28] is a pope or the holy man is the bishop
[1:27:30] or priest the holy man is Christ the
[1:27:34] holy spirit in us how dare the hierarchy
[1:27:39] declare that the leoty has no word to
[1:27:42] say each one has something to say each
[1:27:46] has a work each has a
[1:27:49] Ministry the Holy Ghost came at
[1:27:51] Pentecost and separated himself on each
[1:27:54] that it might be fulfilled whereof
[1:27:56] Christ said at that day ye shall know
[1:27:59] that I am in my father and ye in me and
[1:28:03] I in you amen tonight brothers and
[1:28:06] sisters I want to say what day is
[1:28:10] that that day ye shall know that I am in
[1:28:13] the father and ye in me and I in you
[1:28:15] what I want to say is what day that is
[1:28:18] that's the day that you can say Amen
[1:28:20] praise the Lord I got the Holy Ghost in
[1:28:22] my life amen that day it's not someday
[1:28:25] in the future and it might be someday in
[1:28:27] the past but every single day is a walk
[1:28:30] with Jesus when you know that you are in
[1:28:32] him and he is in
[1:28:34] you it's a beautiful thing that's John
[1:28:38] 14:20 brother R goes on to say I am the
[1:28:42] sorry The Great I Am the almighty God
[1:28:44] has come as Spirit to fill his true
[1:28:47] church he has a right to move anywhere
[1:28:50] he wants to and upon on anybody he wants
[1:28:54] to I'm just going to pause and and let
[1:28:56] this soak a little bit I think it's so
[1:28:58] important brothers and sisters there's
[1:28:59] no great ones amongst us except for
[1:29:02] Jesus Christ amen and when you know that
[1:29:05] a man is pointing to Jesus Christ you
[1:29:08] know he has the right motive and
[1:29:09] objective but when the man starts to
[1:29:11] point at anything else you know there's
[1:29:13] something a Miss in Discerning of spirit
[1:29:16] brother bam talks about that the true
[1:29:18] Ministry is always going to point to
[1:29:20] Christ
[1:29:23] brother bam he goes on to say he wants
[1:29:25] to and upon anybody he wants to we don't
[1:29:28] make any holy men amongst us but the
[1:29:32] whole true Congregation of the Lord Is
[1:29:35] Holy because the presence of the Holy
[1:29:38] Spirit am I'm going to throw this in
[1:29:41] there too you know many times what it is
[1:29:43] is it's not even the men it's not even
[1:29:46] the men that get elevated they wind up
[1:29:48] getting elevated but it's not the men
[1:29:50] trying to draw people unto the what it
[1:29:52] is is a gift in their life that's
[1:29:54] actually manifesting and the people
[1:29:56] start to elevate that gift they start to
[1:29:59] increase that man because that man has
[1:30:01] the ability to have the gift that's not
[1:30:03] where it's at and a true man of God is
[1:30:06] going to say no I can't actually deal
[1:30:08] with people like that you you have to
[1:30:10] stop looking at me start looking at
[1:30:12] Christ
[1:30:14] amen it's only Christ he says it is he
[1:30:19] the holy spirit that is Holy not the
[1:30:22] Congregation of
[1:30:24] itself now that is the Revelation Jesus
[1:30:27] Christ is
[1:30:29] God the Jehovah of the Old Testament is
[1:30:32] Jesus of the new no matter how hard you
[1:30:35] try you can't prove there are three Gods
[1:30:39] but it also takes a revelation by the
[1:30:41] spirit to make you understand that the
[1:30:43] truth the truth that he is one it takes
[1:30:48] a revelation to see that Jehovah of the
[1:30:50] Old Testament is Jesus Jesus of the
[1:30:53] new now just going to pause and just say
[1:30:57] this here when we say the word one maybe
[1:30:59] there's some people that are going to be
[1:31:00] watching or even here now I don't know
[1:31:02] that'll be saying oh see I knew it's
[1:31:04] Oneness it's not Oneness that way it's
[1:31:07] not Oneness like your finger he says it
[1:31:09] in here in this book it's it's one in
[1:31:12] three manifestations in three offices
[1:31:16] yes that kind of
[1:31:19] one Satan crept into the church and
[1:31:22] blinded the people to this truth yes sir
[1:31:24] and when they were blinded to it it
[1:31:26] wasn't long until the Church of Rome
[1:31:28] stopped baptizing in the name of the
[1:31:31] Lord Jesus
[1:31:33] Christ and I'll say it where does it say
[1:31:35] in the Bible that they baptized in the
[1:31:37] name of the Father the Son and the Holy
[1:31:39] Ghost there's not one account in the
[1:31:40] Bible where they've done
[1:31:42] that he goes on to say I admit that it
[1:31:45] takes a real Revelation from the Holy
[1:31:47] Ghost to see the truth about the godhead
[1:31:50] in these days
[1:31:52] when we are in the midst of the
[1:31:54] perverting of so much
[1:31:57] scripture but the prevailing overcoming
[1:32:00] church is built on Revelation so we can
[1:32:03] expect God to reveal his truth to
[1:32:08] us so we can never take a part of the
[1:32:10] Bible out and say I just don't believe
[1:32:13] this for my day and I just don't believe
[1:32:15] that for my day because as soon as we do
[1:32:17] that we're actually adding to and taking
[1:32:20] from and we know that the word of God
[1:32:21] says that the the plagues that are in
[1:32:23] this book will be added to those people
[1:32:25] that add or delete from the word of
[1:32:28] God and we know this will be for free
[1:32:31] too that the word of God came to Malachi
[1:32:34] 4 in our day we believe that God sent a
[1:32:37] prophet and he gave him the ability to
[1:32:40] see the word of God he studied
[1:32:42] exclusively from the King James version
[1:32:45] Bible amen so why would we want to try
[1:32:47] and study from any other version some
[1:32:50] folks are are into to it they've got the
[1:32:52] new international version and there's
[1:32:54] the new King James version I think and
[1:32:57] all the different versions it's you know
[1:32:59] interesting to look at them once in a
[1:33:00] while and maybe cross reference and just
[1:33:02] see I know I do it with the Amplified
[1:33:04] but I don't have an amplified Bible at
[1:33:06] home by my chair where I study and and
[1:33:08] and examine the Amplified Bible I just
[1:33:11] sometimes get an inspiration for a word
[1:33:12] or something and think you know maybe
[1:33:14] what does it say about this verse we
[1:33:16] want to make sure that we follow the
[1:33:17] pattern that was set out for us brothers
[1:33:19] and sisters and sometimes it's a hard to
[1:33:22] say the King James version in Old
[1:33:24] English it's tough it is tough in some
[1:33:26] cases but be clear no no doubt about it
[1:33:30] that the Holy Spirit when he comes in
[1:33:31] our lives he's going to make that
[1:33:33] scripture come to life to us when we
[1:33:35] read it even though it's a hard read
[1:33:38] it's supposed to
[1:33:40] be because it's going to be sweet as
[1:33:42] honey in our mouths but boy it's going
[1:33:45] to make our bellies
[1:33:48] bitter brother bradam he says I hate to
[1:33:50] admit
[1:33:52] sorry that's that's me saying that let
[1:33:56] start over paragraph 71 I admit that it
[1:33:58] takes real Revelation from the Holy
[1:34:00] Ghost to see the truth about the godhead
[1:34:02] in these days but we are in the midst of
[1:34:06] the perverting of so much
[1:34:08] scripture but the prevailing overcoming
[1:34:11] church is built upon the Revelation on
[1:34:13] Revelation so we can expect God to
[1:34:16] reveal his truth to
[1:34:18] us paragraph 72 however you actually
[1:34:22] don't need Revelation on water baptism
[1:34:25] it's right there staring you in the face
[1:34:28] would it be possible for one minute for
[1:34:30] the apostles to be led astray from a
[1:34:33] direct command of the Lord to baptize in
[1:34:36] the name of the father and the Son and
[1:34:39] the Holy Ghost and then find them in
[1:34:42] willful
[1:34:45] Disobedience they knew what the name was
[1:34:49] and there is not one place in scripture
[1:34:50] where they BT baptized any other way
[1:34:53] than in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:55] Christ amen it's so beautiful the way he
[1:34:58] has this written here it says Common
[1:35:00] Sense would tell you the book of Acts is
[1:35:02] the church in action and if they baptize
[1:35:05] that way then that is the way to
[1:35:09] baptize now if you think that is strong
[1:35:12] what do you think of this anyone who was
[1:35:15] not baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:35:17] Jesus had to be baptized over again yes
[1:35:21] sir
[1:35:22] and I'm going to say this I'm going to
[1:35:23] throw this in there brothers and sisters
[1:35:25] if someone was baptized any other way
[1:35:29] and they can see a scriptural
[1:35:33] identification that they need to be
[1:35:35] baptized over again in order for this to
[1:35:37] work if they're a true son and daughter
[1:35:40] of God they're going to line up with
[1:35:41] that word right quick and they're going
[1:35:42] to say be it unto me according to Thy
[1:35:44] Word of course I want to be baptized
[1:35:46] correctly I want to do it right I want
[1:35:48] to be in line with the word of God Amen
[1:35:53] scripture out of Acts 19
[1:35:56] 1-6 and it came to pass that while
[1:35:58] Apollos was at Corinth Paul having
[1:36:01] passed through the upper Coast came to
[1:36:02] Ephesus and finding certain disciples he
[1:36:05] said unto them have ye received the Holy
[1:36:07] Ghost since ye
[1:36:09] believed and they said unto him we have
[1:36:12] not so much as heard whether there be
[1:36:14] any Holy
[1:36:15] Ghost and he said unto them unto what
[1:36:18] then were ye baptized and they said unto
[1:36:21] John's
[1:36:22] baptism then said Paul John verily
[1:36:25] baptized with the baptism of repentance
[1:36:27] saying unto the people that they should
[1:36:29] believe on him which should come after
[1:36:32] him that is on Christ Jesus and when
[1:36:35] they heard this they were baptized in
[1:36:37] the name of the Lord Jesus amen not in
[1:36:41] the name of the father and of the son
[1:36:42] and of the Holy Ghost even though they
[1:36:44] were it's about being able to read
[1:36:47] between the lines and understand how
[1:36:49] this happens goes on to say and when
[1:36:51] when Paul had laid his hands upon them
[1:36:53] the Holy Ghost came on them and they
[1:36:55] spake with tongues and
[1:36:59] prophesied paragraph 74 there it is
[1:37:02] these good people at Ephesus had heard
[1:37:04] about the coming Messiah John and
[1:37:07] preached on him they were baptized unto
[1:37:11] repentance of sins looking forward to
[1:37:13] Believing on Jesus but now it was time
[1:37:16] to look back to Jesus and be baptized
[1:37:19] unto remission of sin sins it was time
[1:37:23] to receive the Holy Ghost and when they
[1:37:26] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:37:27] Jesus Christ Paul laid his hands on them
[1:37:30] and the Holy Ghost Came Upon them oh
[1:37:32] those dear Folks at Ephesus were fine
[1:37:34] people and if anyone had a right to feel
[1:37:37] secure they did notice how far they'd
[1:37:40] come they had come all the way up to
[1:37:42] accepting the coming Messiah amen they
[1:37:45] were ready for him excuse me but don't
[1:37:49] you see that in spite of that that they
[1:37:52] had missed
[1:37:54] him they had come he had come and
[1:37:58] gone they needed to be baptized in the
[1:38:01] name of the Lord Jesus Christ yes they
[1:38:05] needed to be filled with the Holy
[1:38:07] Ghost if you have been baptized in the
[1:38:10] name of the Lord Jesus Christ God will
[1:38:12] fill you with his spirit that is the
[1:38:15] word acts
[1:38:17] 196 which we read was the fulfilling of
[1:38:22] Acts 238 repent and be baptized every
[1:38:24] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:38:27] for the remission of sins and ye shall
[1:38:30] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:38:33] and I think this is just so beautiful
[1:38:34] it's such a critical factor to all of
[1:38:37] this brothers and sisters we need to get
[1:38:39] the Holy Ghost to be able to understand
[1:38:41] the message of the hour we need to get
[1:38:42] the Holy Ghost to be able to get into
[1:38:44] the depths the mysterious things the
[1:38:46] Deep things of God we have to have the
[1:38:49] Holy Ghost to be able to do that
[1:38:50] otherwise we're just in an intellectual
[1:38:51] State and we can read it and we can say
[1:38:54] it we can remember it but it doesn't
[1:38:56] really do much for us because it's not
[1:38:58] quickened it doesn't become quick and
[1:39:00] Powerful in our lives it just becomes a
[1:39:02] tradition and we don't want it to be a
[1:39:05] tradition paragraph 77 see Paul by the
[1:39:09] Holy Ghost said exactly what Peter said
[1:39:11] by the Holy Ghost and what was said
[1:39:14] cannot be changed it has to be the same
[1:39:17] from Pentecost until the very last
[1:39:20] elected one has been
[1:39:22] baptized but though we or an angel from
[1:39:25] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[1:39:27] than that which we have preached unto
[1:39:28] you let him be a
[1:39:30] cursed I'm just going to read this
[1:39:32] paragraph I'm going to jump back to the
[1:39:34] other one and I'll call the musicians
[1:39:36] because we're already at
[1:39:40] time I just think it's so beautiful
[1:39:42] brothers and sisters I get a charge out
[1:39:44] of this I really do it just
[1:39:50] I
[1:39:53] where were we yeah I want to read this
[1:39:55] paragraph again see Paul by the Holy
[1:39:57] Ghost said exactly what Peter said by
[1:39:59] the Holy Ghost and what was said cannot
[1:40:02] be changed it has to be the same from
[1:40:04] Pentecost until the very last elected
[1:40:07] one has been baptized now remember we
[1:40:11] started out with paragraph 61 the
[1:40:13] ability to discern the heart thoughts in
[1:40:16] men made the elect of God to understand
[1:40:21] that here was the Messiah the anointed
[1:40:24] word of God only the elected can see it
[1:40:27] brothers and sisters other people will
[1:40:29] call it telepathy they'll call it mind
[1:40:32] reading they'll say It's Magic some kind
[1:40:35] of trickery maybe it's just a
[1:40:37] discussion when the word of God comes
[1:40:40] and and discerns the Very hearts of men
[1:40:43] that is the sign of the Messiah brothers
[1:40:47] and sisters we know that we have the
[1:40:49] ability to receive the word of God God
[1:40:51] but when we are in that place when we're
[1:40:53] in that state when we're in a position
[1:40:55] where we're calling on the name of the
[1:40:56] Lord and he comes on the scene it's not
[1:41:00] the devil right it's not men it's God I
[1:41:04] just can't get over I just want to
[1:41:07] celebrate the fact that we had the Lord
[1:41:09] here with us on Sunday I know it and we
[1:41:12] have him here right now with us even
[1:41:14] tonight in our service brothers and
[1:41:16] sisters the same one he's more than
[1:41:19] willing to help us in our our troubles
[1:41:21] in our trials to Grant to us the things
[1:41:23] that we ask big for because we won't ask
[1:41:27] a Miss if we've got his Spirit maybe
