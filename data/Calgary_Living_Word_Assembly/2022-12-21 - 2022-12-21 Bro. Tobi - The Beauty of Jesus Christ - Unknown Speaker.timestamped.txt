[32:55] so we're going to read from the book of
[32:56] Esther chapter one I'll start from the
[32:58] first verse and read up to verse 12.
[33:03] since now it came to pass in the days of
[33:06] hazarus
[33:07] these are zeros which reigned from India
[33:10] even onto Ethiopia
[33:13] over
[33:14] 107 and 20 provinces
[33:17] that in those days when the king hazarus
[33:20] sat on the throne of his kingdom
[33:23] which was in sushan the palace in the
[33:27] third year of his Reign he made a feast
[33:30] unto all the princes and his servants
[33:32] the power of
[33:33] Persia and media
[33:36] the Nobles and the princes of the
[33:38] provinces
[33:40] being before him
[33:42] when he showed the reaches of his
[33:44] glorious Kingdom and the honor of his
[33:47] excellent Majesty many days even a
[33:50] hundred and four score days
[33:53] and when these days were expired the
[33:55] king made a feast and to all the people
[33:57] that were present in shushan the palace
[34:00] both onto Great and Small
[34:04] seven days in the courts
[34:07] of the garden of the king's Palace
[34:11] where were white green and blue hangings
[34:14] fastened with cords of fine linen and
[34:16] purple
[34:17] to silver rings and pillars of marble
[34:20] the beds were of gold and silver upon a
[34:23] pavement of red and blue
[34:26] and white and black and marble
[34:30] and they gave them drink in vessels of
[34:32] gold the vessels been diverse one from
[34:35] another and Royal Wine in abundance
[34:38] according to the state of the king
[34:41] and the drinking was according to the
[34:43] law none did compelled for so the king
[34:47] had appointed to all the officers of his
[34:49] house
[34:50] that it shall do according to Every
[34:53] Man's pleasure
[34:55] also vashti the queen Made A Feast for
[34:59] the women in the Royal house which
[35:01] belonged to King hazarus
[35:04] on the seventh day when the heart of the
[35:06] King was married with wine he commanded
[35:09] mehuman
[35:12] [Music]
[35:19] and cash
[35:21] the seven chamberlains that served in
[35:23] the presence of hazarus the king to
[35:26] bring vashti the queen before the king
[35:28] with
[35:29] the Crown Royal to show the people
[35:34] and the prince is a beauty for she was
[35:37] fair to look on
[35:38] but the queen vashti refused to come at
[35:42] the king's Commandments by his
[35:44] chamberlains therefore was the king very
[35:47] rough and his anger burned in him let's
[35:51] just have a quick word of prayer there
[35:52] father
[35:54] we've read from the pages of the
[35:56] scripture this
[35:58] scripture that we have before us is
[36:00] inspired your Prophet told us that every
[36:03] portion of this Bible is inspired
[36:06] so father the inspiration that was upon
[36:09] the writer which we know that was the
[36:10] inspiration of the Holy Spirit we ask
[36:13] that that same inspiration we bring
[36:15] context to those words that we've read
[36:17] tonight that's loaded to be used
[36:20] speaking to us just something that we
[36:22] need to have Lord on a night like this
[36:24] Lord Jesus Christ to go ponder over when
[36:27] we go to our homes and the glory of the
[36:30] honor and the praise will be thine for
[36:32] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[36:36] God bless you you may have your sin
[36:38] I know it's Christmas time and I was
[36:41] wondering whether
[36:42] it will be appropriate to bring a
[36:45] Christmas message
[36:46] something like a Christmas message I
[36:48] know
[36:49] maybe the pastor will bring one on
[36:51] Christmas Day and Sunday
[36:52] but I was just thinking about you know
[36:55] whether this world fit
[36:58] um a Christmas message my title tonight
[37:00] is the beauty of Jesus Christ
[37:03] and that might you know sound very
[37:07] different from where we read
[37:08] the story of Esther
[37:10] um but as we go along you're going to
[37:12] see that this little story here
[37:14] shows us that the beauty of Jesus Christ
[37:18] is in a certain people
[37:21] and that's where we're going tonight so
[37:22] if I could jump ahead of myself a little
[37:25] bit
[37:26] is to let us know that the beauty of
[37:28] Jesus Christ is in certain people the
[37:31] world is looking for a baby Jesus
[37:34] and many times babies are very cute we
[37:37] look at them we want to spend time with
[37:38] them they smile it's different and
[37:42] that's what the world is looking for
[37:43] today but there is no baby Jesus today
[37:47] Jesus came in flesh God came in flesh
[37:51] for repurpose and that's the purpose is
[37:54] what we need to focus on today
[37:56] now where we read is the story of Esther
[37:58] but more of the story of part of the
[38:01] Journey of the children of Israel and we
[38:04] know that when Israel decided that they
[38:07] wanted a king over them God decided to
[38:10] give them a king it was Saul later on
[38:12] God gave them his own choice of a king
[38:14] which is David
[38:15] one of the things that God said to David
[38:18] is that if this people will serve me
[38:21] then I'll continue to bless them and you
[38:24] your seat will continue to sit on the
[38:27] throne which is my throne
[38:29] by God to a time when Israel decided to
[38:32] go away from the teachings of Moses the
[38:35] law that God had given to them and they
[38:37] went after all the gods and God punished
[38:41] them and the way God punished them was
[38:42] God made another country to come take
[38:45] over
[38:46] Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon took
[38:49] over Israel we know that he got to a
[38:52] time where Nebuchadnezzar himself
[38:54] started to feel some level of Pride and
[38:57] he felt that he placed himself there and
[39:00] God gave him a heart of an animal that
[39:03] made him go into
[39:05] the Wilderness for for a number of years
[39:09] but God showed a vision to Daniel
[39:12] and part of the vision that God showed
[39:14] to Daniel God showed Daniel several
[39:15] kingdoms a number of Kingdoms that were
[39:17] going to come and Daniel seen in the
[39:19] future could see that there was also
[39:21] going to be the the
[39:23] um the kingdom of the passions and the
[39:26] Maddies
[39:28] and when he saw that that was going to
[39:30] happen God made him understand that this
[39:33] kingdom was going to go on for a while
[39:35] and then that kingdom was also going to
[39:37] fail it was going to be destroyed
[39:40] now the first king of the past the
[39:43] Persia and the Maddies was Cyrus
[39:46] and one of the things that Cyrus did was
[39:49] he gave the children of Israel the
[39:51] opportunity to go back
[39:53] to Israel the book of Ezra told us about
[39:55] how they started to build Jerusalem
[39:58] again but this King that we are reading
[40:00] about here was after Cyrus and his name
[40:03] is arazerus and the Bible told us that
[40:06] he had a domain of
[40:09] 127 provinces
[40:12] and those provinces included Israel
[40:16] now in the third year of his Reign this
[40:20] King
[40:21] I mean historians talked about the fact
[40:23] that it was about the time he was going
[40:25] to have a war with Greece
[40:29] and he wanted to get the support of all
[40:33] of his you know the leaders of his
[40:35] provinces
[40:36] so he invited all the provinces the
[40:38] Bible tells us that it's from India to
[40:40] Ethiopia which was in the Bible days but
[40:43] if we look at you know modern day it's a
[40:46] lot of countries put together
[40:48] now we had all those leaders come and
[40:51] the intention he had was to show the
[40:54] reaches of his glorious Kingdom and the
[40:57] honor of his excellent Majesty
[41:00] and for his leaders one of the things he
[41:02] did was to show them this thing so they
[41:06] can get their support to be able to go
[41:08] to war with Greece
[41:11] now that's party
[41:13] was for six months I don't think any of
[41:16] us has been a party that lasted six
[41:18] months but it was six months of feasting
[41:21] it was six months of having you know an
[41:24] opportunity to see how powerful this
[41:27] King was
[41:28] and after I was done with this Francis
[41:31] then he had seven days
[41:35] where he said you know what bring
[41:38] everybody in my kingdom
[41:40] stories also feel that maybe he got the
[41:42] approval of his princes and he wanted to
[41:45] celebrate and seven days he opened it up
[41:47] to everybody come to the Palace come
[41:50] have some food come have wine and he
[41:53] gave them the best I could give them and
[41:55] the wine that was given was not the wine
[41:57] that they were buying you know from the
[41:59] outside it was the King's Wine
[42:02] and brother Brown would always tell us
[42:04] that the physical types of spiritual
[42:07] so I'm not here to really give us a
[42:08] story that we probably know or some part
[42:11] of it that we don't know but to start to
[42:13] bring us to the realization that God
[42:15] allowed this to happen so that we can
[42:18] look at those examples and start to see
[42:20] our lives because there's also a king of
[42:23] kings and a lot of Lords today that
[42:25] stepped out and it's going to be
[42:27] interesting some of the things we're
[42:28] going to find
[42:31] the god of Heaven came down in flesh and
[42:35] the entire world is celebrating it but
[42:38] it did not come down in flesh just for
[42:41] you know the fact that he wanted people
[42:43] to see that he could condescend to to
[42:46] our level as humans he came in flesh for
[42:49] a certain purpose the Bible told us that
[42:52] he was sent to his own
[42:56] and his own received him not but to them
[42:58] that received him he has given the power
[43:00] to be called the sons of God
[43:03] so this kingazarus if we could go back
[43:05] to that
[43:06] after you had spent seven days feeding
[43:10] everybody
[43:10] giving them all that it could to make
[43:14] their hearts merry was a time of Joy was
[43:16] a time of Celebration
[43:18] he himself had taken some wine and he
[43:21] was happy he was married
[43:23] and the next thing he wanted to do was
[43:26] to show the beauty of his Queen
[43:29] now what I want us to understand is that
[43:32] the Bible never told us anything about
[43:34] the beauty of that King
[43:37] and the Bible told us about Jesus he
[43:40] said that Jesus agreed before God
[43:44] in Isaiah 53 I'll just read the message
[43:46] version I think he's really quite uh
[43:49] explanatory he said the seventh gree up
[43:51] before God speaking about Jesus
[43:53] is Crown is seedling it's probably plant
[43:56] in the parched field there was nothing
[43:59] attractive about him
[44:03] King James said no beauty that we should
[44:06] Behold Him there's no beauty that we
[44:08] should desire him
[44:10] nothing to cause us to take a second
[44:13] look
[44:16] why didn't he have the beauty
[44:18] because the beauty was not meant to be
[44:21] expressed through him his beauty is to
[44:24] be expressed through his bride and Jesus
[44:27] told us he said I am the vine ye are the
[44:30] branches he said the why cannot bring
[44:32] forth fruit of itself the fruit of the
[44:36] vine has got to come through the
[44:38] branches
[44:40] so when the king sent the seven
[44:42] chamberlains there were seven
[44:43] chamberlins and it's quite interesting
[44:45] that there were seven chamberlains that
[44:47] were sent to vashti vashti being the
[44:50] first bride of this King
[44:54] she was told to come and show her beauty
[44:58] now one of the things that you realize
[45:00] is that the reason that vashti refused
[45:04] to come and show a beauty to the King
[45:06] was because she did not realize that the
[45:09] beauty that she had was not cars in the
[45:12] first place
[45:15] it wasn't ours in the first place
[45:17] that beauty and as we will you know go
[45:20] on to see how Esther became Queen you
[45:23] will realize that the provision was made
[45:26] when Esther was going to be Queen just
[45:29] to go a little bit ahead of myself what
[45:31] was said to to the people what was the
[45:34] advice that was given to the king as
[45:36] we'll get there was that go and look for
[45:38] a lady
[45:39] she has to be a virgin and she has to be
[45:41] fair
[45:42] that was all
[45:45] she could be a common lady on the
[45:46] streets
[45:48] but when she comes into the palace
[45:51] everything that she requires for her
[45:54] beauty was made available by the king
[45:59] it had nothing to do with what she
[46:02] brought as a matter of fact she was not
[46:04] expected to bring anything in so vashti
[46:07] had gotten to a point where she got
[46:10] comfortable in the palace and started
[46:13] feeling that you know what this beauty I
[46:16] made it up myself
[46:17] it was because of my own resources it
[46:21] was because of my own intellect it was
[46:23] because of I was the fact that was more
[46:25] beautiful than others that was why I was
[46:27] chosen
[46:29] and that was one of the places
[46:31] that will see that she got it wrong
[46:34] so the beauty that we have as the bride
[46:37] of Christ is not ours what is the beauty
[46:40] that we have is the righteousness of
[46:42] Christ and he told us that if we try to
[46:45] bring our own Beauty
[46:47] it's filthy racks before him
[46:51] so he expects us to realize that the
[46:54] beauty that we have is his own Beauty
[46:58] because he has no Beauty
[47:00] that we shall be that we shall desire
[47:02] him
[47:03] so we realized that you know the seven
[47:05] chamberlies were sent to to to to vashti
[47:08] she refused she thought that the beauty
[47:10] that she had was ours and another thing
[47:13] that she did was that she had her own
[47:15] agenda
[47:17] a desire was not to the king we keep
[47:20] reading you know in verse 9 and he tells
[47:22] us that she made
[47:24] A Feast for the women in the Royal house
[47:27] so she was having her own party she was
[47:30] having our own mini domain where she was
[47:34] impressing certain people within the
[47:36] kingdom
[47:38] she was almost running a parallel
[47:41] government within that Kingdom
[47:46] so when the king asked her to come
[47:48] she refused
[47:51] remember Brown will tell us
[47:54] you know that's
[47:57] what he was talking about Esther
[47:59] you know looking at how Esther became
[48:01] king uh became Queen I'll get to that
[48:03] later but let me just take you know us
[48:05] to to that place because that's
[48:07] something I want to bring out here
[48:10] everything that Esther required was
[48:12] provided by the king
[48:14] monaster was also given a king's
[48:17] Chamberlain
[48:19] and something that was remarkable about
[48:22] Esther is that she refused every other
[48:26] thing apart from what the Chamberlain
[48:29] gave to her
[48:32] she refused every other thing
[48:35] she wouldn't take anything other than
[48:37] what the King has provided
[48:40] she understood that the Chamberlain was
[48:42] the closest
[48:44] to the king
[48:47] if we go back he told us about those
[48:49] seven chamberlains and he ex explained
[48:51] to us that they were the ones that were
[48:53] always before the king they had an
[48:55] opportunity to always be before the king
[48:57] they knew what the king liked
[49:01] and brother Brahm
[49:04] was sent
[49:05] to bring us the desire of the king
[49:10] what does the king like
[49:12] you know many times we can find
[49:16] ourselves in a situation where the enemy
[49:17] wants us to be like vashti
[49:21] where we feel like there's something
[49:23] more that we can do by ourselves
[49:25] where we feel like somebody said
[49:27] something somewhere that's different
[49:29] from what the brand said and it sounds a
[49:31] little bit more aligned with the Bible
[49:34] where you read something the brother
[49:35] Brahm is given maybe an analogy and
[49:38] explaining from the Bible and it doesn't
[49:40] sound exactly correct
[49:44] yet is the closest
[49:46] to the king
[49:48] so you take what he has brought to dress
[49:51] you up
[49:52] and brother Braham told us when he was
[49:54] here he was recording those messages
[49:59] he said that God told him to do that so
[50:03] that he can put them in the storehouse
[50:05] for the bride
[50:08] now when he put those things in the
[50:09] storehouse he also like Paul would tell
[50:13] us
[50:13] selected it shows before the foundation
[50:17] of the world will explain because these
[50:19] are callings of the lives of men of
[50:21] fivefold ministry brotherbraham called
[50:24] them God's dress wear
[50:28] what is their duty to go and bring the
[50:32] things that the King has provided and
[50:35] dressed the bride with it
[50:37] nothing more nothing less
[50:40] but the brand said in the message
[50:42] putting out the whole armor of God said
[50:45] now God fortified his army
[50:47] he said with what himself
[50:51] I know we're talking about a queen but
[50:53] it's the same in the applies of the
[50:55] analogy of an army for a nation
[50:57] none of those soldiers will ever need to
[51:00] think about where will my uniform come
[51:02] from none of the soldiers we ever think
[51:05] of where will the animation come from
[51:07] none of the soldiers we ever think of
[51:09] where will my training come from
[51:11] is the responsibility of the country to
[51:15] make that provision for them
[51:17] and brother Brahm said that every
[51:19] country will equip his army with the
[51:22] best
[51:23] the best that they have
[51:26] there's a war going on with Russia and
[51:28] Ukraine
[51:29] and Ukraine is of course getting the
[51:33] um the sympathy of the western world and
[51:36] the Western world is supplying as much
[51:38] as they can without getting put into to
[51:41] to go crazy you know with us with what
[51:44] can help Ukraine to be more fortified
[51:48] the best that they can that they could
[51:51] have and Ukraine is giving that to their
[51:53] army
[51:55] to fight the battle so brother Brian
[51:57] said is the same with God God fortifies
[51:59] his army
[52:01] with himself
[52:04] now this is the one that might stumble
[52:06] you
[52:07] he said in the form of prophets
[52:12] apostles
[52:14] teachers pastors
[52:20] how did he fortify his army
[52:22] where do you find the ammunition
[52:25] in the fivefold
[52:29] they've got a calling in their life to
[52:33] do something
[52:34] many times we stumble at the vessel we
[52:37] stumble at the Badgers came
[52:40] but the Bible has taught us enough
[52:43] David has started running taught us
[52:45] enough to realize that when the
[52:47] anointing of God is upon the life of a
[52:50] man you've got to separate the man and
[52:52] the anointed
[52:55] the fault of Saul was not accounted to
[52:58] him by David because David recognized
[53:01] the anointing
[53:04] he said what did he do what was God
[53:06] doing he said listen did you ever think
[53:09] of that offices of the church is
[53:12] the Bible said is God's dress inside the
[53:15] dress an apostle the prophet a Seer for
[53:19] seeing it before Satan ever gets to it
[53:21] Don told it what is it God dressed up
[53:25] his church
[53:27] these offices is God's dress wear when
[53:31] you see those offices pastors teachers
[53:33] evangelists what is that that's God's
[53:36] dress wear God's presence
[53:40] God's spirits
[53:43] working through men
[53:48] then brother Birmingham gave us a
[53:49] caution here he said and if that offers
[53:51] denies any of this word
[53:55] then it's not God's dressing
[53:58] you see
[53:59] said no not that that's wolf in sheep's
[54:04] clothing
[54:05] what that fellow beware of him but when
[54:08] he takes what the word says remember
[54:11] that's God because he's speaking his
[54:14] word
[54:15] so but Abraham is explaining to us here
[54:18] that we as the bride of Christ God has
[54:21] also made provision for us
[54:23] for a certain set of men of God to bring
[54:27] what has already been stored remember
[54:30] it's got to be what is in the storehouse
[54:35] it's got to be that which has been kept
[54:37] in the storehouse being brought back to
[54:39] us and we've got to take it as was told
[54:42] John and eat it up
[54:46] vashti has no regard for the Lord
[54:50] because according to the law
[54:53] when the king gives a Commandments
[54:57] no one can change it
[54:59] it's quite interesting that when vashti
[55:02] refused to come as a call of the king of
[55:05] the Commandment of the king the king did
[55:08] not take the decision himself
[55:11] the king turned back to the princes the
[55:13] seventh princes it's chamberlings and I
[55:16] asked them what do I do in this
[55:17] situation
[55:19] and there were seven of them
[55:22] and it's interesting that it was the
[55:24] seventh that gave the council
[55:28] and I'm reminded by Brother Brown
[55:29] preached the message he said that the
[55:31] indicts mate
[55:32] and in preaching that message he said I
[55:35] indict this generation for the second
[55:38] crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:41] who was indicting the church
[55:45] the small Sea church
[55:49] the original Queen that refused the
[55:53] Commandment of the king
[55:57] so this man came
[56:00] and said this is the council
[56:02] we have to ensure that this Behavior
[56:05] does not Cascade down to everyone in
[56:08] this Kingdom
[56:09] because as she has refused the the
[56:12] Commandment of the king other women in
[56:14] the Kingdom imagine we are talking about
[56:16] 127 provinces
[56:19] I don't know what size of the entire
[56:20] world that was at that time but must be
[56:23] significant
[56:25] all the women in the Kingdom there was a
[56:27] potential that they would become
[56:29] disobedient and disrespectful to their
[56:32] husbands
[56:35] they are going to reject leadership
[56:38] they're going to reject headship
[56:41] and that is exactly what happened to the
[56:43] denominations when they refused the word
[56:46] they rejected headship
[56:51] and God's Own Chamberlain God's Own
[56:53] messenger the seventh messenger came and
[56:57] said I inject this generation
[56:59] for crucifying Jesus Christ a second
[57:03] time
[57:07] and because of that she was deposed
[57:10] to set an example
[57:13] I don't want to get into families
[57:15] because brother I take it you know uh um
[57:18] a huge chunk of time to to get into that
[57:21] and I have been blessed
[57:23] my testimony is that those messages you
[57:26] know when you say Amen to the word you
[57:29] don't realize what he does
[57:32] you don't know when changes happen but I
[57:34] know that my marriage has been better by
[57:36] the grace of God from all those messages
[57:39] that have been coming
[57:42] I believe every one of us should have
[57:43] that testimony as well
[57:45] because when we say Amen to the word
[57:48] the Holy Spirit goes in and by itself
[57:52] starts to make that word come to pass
[57:55] Jesus Christ said the words I speak unto
[57:57] you they are spirits and life
[58:01] there's a spirit behind the word but
[58:04] that Spirit takes the word and brings it
[58:06] to pass in your life you've got to
[58:09] accept that word before that will happen
[58:13] so I used to say to sisters
[58:15] I say when the word says that you should
[58:17] be subject to your husband
[58:20] I said You shall enjoy that submission
[58:25] and when the word of God tells us as
[58:27] husband as well to love our wives we
[58:30] should enjoy that process and and you
[58:32] know the interesting thing is is
[58:33] unconditional
[58:36] he didn't say when she's good to you
[58:38] when she's respectful
[58:40] when she gives you food no
[58:43] and brother Brown you know I believe the
[58:45] word also tells us because brother Paul
[58:48] what he told us in Ephesians is as
[58:51] Christ loved the church and the question
[58:54] is when did Christ love the church
[58:58] when she was
[59:00] the best that could be she could be no
[59:03] when she was the worst when she was the
[59:06] Bible said we're enemies
[59:08] to go that was when the love happened
[59:12] so vashti
[59:14] was you know taken away
[59:17] from a position
[59:19] because she refused her headship
[59:22] I'm not going to be long tonight but
[59:24] let's take a look at Esther
[59:28] Esther she was
[59:31] a Jewish lady
[59:32] that lost her parents a cousin are
[59:35] taking that responsibility of Parenthood
[59:39] and she was one of the fair ladies and
[59:42] virgin
[59:44] so she met the criteria
[59:46] because the Council of the seventh
[59:48] Chamberlain was that let's look for a
[59:51] lady
[59:52] who's a virgin and they were supposed to
[59:55] look from all of 127 provinces
[59:59] and all those Maids were brought into
[1:00:01] the palace and handed over to a
[1:00:04] Chamberlain
[1:00:06] verse 15 of Esther chapter 2 says now
[1:00:10] when the churn of Esther the daughter of
[1:00:11] Abby held the uncle of Mordecai who had
[1:00:15] taken out for his daughter was come to
[1:00:17] go in unto the king
[1:00:21] she required nothing
[1:00:23] but what a guy the king's Chamberlain
[1:00:26] The Keeper of the women appointed
[1:00:30] and Esther obtained favor in the sight
[1:00:33] of all them that looked upon her
[1:00:38] so Esther
[1:00:40] she had no desire what was different
[1:00:42] about her it looks very simple
[1:00:46] but very important
[1:00:48] all the other mates were virgins as well
[1:00:51] all the other mates were afraid to look
[1:00:53] upon
[1:00:55] sometimes you look at other people
[1:00:58] I know if I should get to this
[1:01:00] but many times we look at Pentecostals
[1:01:05] young people sometimes you ask the
[1:01:07] question what's different about them
[1:01:11] sometimes they even probably live Better
[1:01:14] Lives
[1:01:15] the way you will see it they have better
[1:01:18] music
[1:01:21] they pray more than we do
[1:01:24] they probably witnessed more than we do
[1:01:27] two women came knocking on our door in
[1:01:30] the cold couple days ago we probably
[1:01:33] don't do that
[1:01:34] I think they're Jehovah Witnesses
[1:01:38] But realize this
[1:01:41] that though all those other Maids seem
[1:01:43] to meet the criteria
[1:01:46] their desire was different
[1:01:50] they did not exclusively desire only
[1:01:54] what the king provided
[1:01:57] they did not exclusively desire only the
[1:02:00] word
[1:02:02] they looked for more
[1:02:08] because when you show them the words
[1:02:10] they're going to tell you that no but my
[1:02:13] pastor said
[1:02:14] our church said
[1:02:16] accredit said
[1:02:18] so no matter how much they look like
[1:02:20] virgins with they could be virgins
[1:02:22] because they're foolish virgins as well
[1:02:25] but something that made us a difference
[1:02:29] was that she desired nothing else
[1:02:33] other than what was provided to her by
[1:02:36] the king
[1:02:37] and that's why brother Brahms said that
[1:02:40] the bride in this last age she will be
[1:02:42] not just a virgin but a virgin of the
[1:02:46] word
[1:02:47] a virgin of the word she will take
[1:02:50] nothing else into our spiritual womb
[1:02:53] other than the word of God
[1:02:57] and if there's any time that Satan is
[1:02:59] subtly coming to deceive it is right now
[1:03:03] it will bring something that doesn't
[1:03:05] that looks so much like the word but
[1:03:08] just has a little bit just like it did
[1:03:10] to if thou shall not
[1:03:12] surely die
[1:03:16] so we found out that's something that
[1:03:19] made Esther outstanding
[1:03:21] she had that desire
[1:03:23] she did not drink anything into the
[1:03:25] king's Palace
[1:03:26] she just came just as she was
[1:03:30] she ensured that the clothing that was
[1:03:32] put upon her because she was listening
[1:03:34] to the king's Chamberlain was according
[1:03:36] to the king's instruction
[1:03:41] she had to be purified
[1:03:44] for six months
[1:03:47] and that time of purification she was
[1:03:49] like a lamb
[1:03:51] she was like a sheep
[1:03:53] willing to give our wool
[1:03:58] because she knew
[1:04:00] that if she can meet the requirements
[1:04:03] or the instruction of the Chamberlain
[1:04:06] then she would have fulfilled the desire
[1:04:08] of the king
[1:04:10] and we cannot be purified by anything
[1:04:12] else
[1:04:14] because this bride of Jesus
[1:04:17] in this last closing moments of time
[1:04:20] will not be purified by man's ideas will
[1:04:24] not be purified by our traditions
[1:04:28] we will not be purified by anything else
[1:04:30] other than the word of God that's been
[1:04:33] given to us
[1:04:36] so we've got to take the word
[1:04:38] Ram said in the message the marriage of
[1:04:40] the Lamb
[1:04:42] he said he's going to have a bride that
[1:04:44] hasn't got a wrinkle in her amen she's
[1:04:46] wholly Washed by the blood of his own
[1:04:49] self
[1:04:50] that's right so we see where we stand
[1:04:53] the wedding getting ready to come
[1:04:57] so now we find out she commits spiritual
[1:04:59] fornications going out with the world
[1:05:02] professing something living something
[1:05:04] different
[1:05:06] that won't never work I told us brother
[1:05:09] Brian indicted this generation and
[1:05:12] indicted the the religious organizations
[1:05:15] he said I have nothing against the
[1:05:17] people
[1:05:18] but there's a system that I'm against
[1:05:22] and he's saying that these people they
[1:05:25] have committed spiritual fornication
[1:05:27] so that will never work what the church
[1:05:30] ought to do is do like Esther deep
[1:05:34] Esther refused the adorning of the world
[1:05:39] so we know that little Book of Esther
[1:05:40] how that Mordecai his uncle other
[1:05:42] daughter
[1:05:44] and was down during the times of the
[1:05:46] Reigns of the Medics and Persians it's a
[1:05:49] very beautiful type there the king one
[1:05:51] of the greatest kings in the world that
[1:05:53] day he had a great feast and he called
[1:05:57] the queen to come said by him but she
[1:05:59] wouldn't do it
[1:06:01] she refused to do it
[1:06:03] so what did he do he was so humiliated
[1:06:07] they know what to do that his own wife
[1:06:09] wouldn't come
[1:06:11] I think that's a lot like Christ today
[1:06:16] Christ has invited us to set in Heavenly
[1:06:20] places with him
[1:06:22] and we are ashamed of it
[1:06:27] many people are ashamed to say that they
[1:06:30] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:34] Pentecostal people that's right they are
[1:06:37] ashamed to say it we are ashamed of him
[1:06:40] and so the queen wouldn't come she
[1:06:43] refused to come it humiliated him his
[1:06:46] face changed red everybody noticed
[1:06:50] the Bible said I wonder if Jesus's face
[1:06:52] don't turn a little red too
[1:06:55] when he calls on us for a work
[1:06:58] calls on the Pentecostal movement for
[1:07:01] fellowship and Brotherhood and we are so
[1:07:04] tightly organized
[1:07:06] into little groups till we won't Bend
[1:07:09] for the other
[1:07:11] and the time of the brand was the
[1:07:12] Pentecostal church is the head of
[1:07:14] divisions
[1:07:15] but the time will come where those that
[1:07:18] accepted the message of the prayer will
[1:07:20] also allow the Visions to come in their
[1:07:22] midst
[1:07:24] but I believe that time is over
[1:07:26] because there's a promise that there
[1:07:28] will be a uniting time of the Bride
[1:07:32] and brother Brian said that first will
[1:07:35] come a Unity of the spirit
[1:07:37] before we'll have the unity of the faith
[1:07:40] and we are beginning to see the unity of
[1:07:42] the spirit now
[1:07:44] we are beginning to see those walls
[1:07:46] break we are beginning to see what the
[1:07:48] Bible give us an analogy somewhere he
[1:07:50] talked about a kind of a field of corn
[1:07:53] and how they had fancies in it and he
[1:07:56] said when they are small when they are
[1:07:57] not yet mature you can see the fences
[1:08:00] and he said but when they start to grow
[1:08:02] and get mature they grow above the
[1:08:05] fences and when an aviator is going on
[1:08:09] top of it you don't see the fences
[1:08:11] the fences are still there but they have
[1:08:14] now started to come and fellowship
[1:08:16] together
[1:08:19] but this Pentecostal organizations
[1:08:22] they refuse the ram said some people is
[1:08:25] afraid to say
[1:08:27] say well I belong I'm a Christian but
[1:08:31] I'm glad I got a Pentecostal experience
[1:08:35] well the ram said they are afraid to say
[1:08:37] that they've got a Pentecostal
[1:08:38] experience said amen I'm glad to Bear
[1:08:41] the name of Jesus Christ is the greatest
[1:08:43] privilege I ever had to say I'm a part
[1:08:47] of him
[1:08:48] so the question tonight is Lord help us
[1:08:51] we don't want to be like vashti want to
[1:08:54] be like Esther we want to show the
[1:08:57] beauty of Jesus
[1:08:59] you know that song says who would be
[1:09:01] Jesus to her
[1:09:03] who will be Jesus to them
[1:09:06] who will show the word that restores
[1:09:09] them again
[1:09:10] they don't need a judge
[1:09:12] they need a friend
[1:09:17] his time will stop to look at people and
[1:09:21] judge them it's time to start to look at
[1:09:24] them and ask ourselves the question what
[1:09:26] can I do to represent Jesus to this
[1:09:28] person
[1:09:30] what can I do to be Jesus
[1:09:34] well the Peter told us in First Peter 5
[1:09:36] said likewise ye younger
[1:09:39] submit yourself unto the Elder yeah all
[1:09:42] of you be subject one to another and be
[1:09:44] clothed with humility
[1:09:47] for God resists said the proud and
[1:09:50] giveth grace to the humble
[1:09:52] so he's telling us we should be clothed
[1:09:54] with humility
[1:09:56] remember tonight we're talking about the
[1:09:58] beauty of Jesus
[1:09:59] and right from the start we said that
[1:10:01] Jesus would not show his Beauty he has
[1:10:03] no beauty that we should desire him
[1:10:06] but that beauty must be somewhere
[1:10:08] that beauty is in you and I
[1:10:12] that songwriter says let the beauty of
[1:10:14] Jesus be seen in me
[1:10:17] I want the beauty of Jesus to be sitting
[1:10:19] with the sweetness of Jesus
[1:10:22] that's fruit has anyone ever tried to
[1:10:24] eat the back of a tree
[1:10:28] no no it doesn't taste good back in
[1:10:30] Africa we use it for medicinal purposes
[1:10:34] you boil it in water boy
[1:10:37] you put it in your mouth it's beet
[1:10:40] but take the fruit
[1:10:42] of that same tree
[1:10:44] and try when it's ripe try to eat it you
[1:10:47] will enjoy it
[1:10:48] why because it's the vines fruit is the
[1:10:52] trees fruits but the beauty of that tree
[1:10:55] the sweetness of that tree is not in the
[1:10:57] tree itself
[1:10:59] is the tree's choice or the Maker's
[1:11:02] choice to express the sweetness of that
[1:11:05] tree in the fruits
[1:11:08] So when you say oh we've got a mango
[1:11:10] tree we've got an apple tree an apple
[1:11:13] tree is giving us Good Apples you're not
[1:11:15] talking about the tree being sweet
[1:11:17] you're talking about the fruits being
[1:11:19] sweet and juicy
[1:11:21] so he wants us to be clothed with
[1:11:22] humility Isaiah says I will greatly
[1:11:25] rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be
[1:11:27] joyfully my God for yet clothe me with
[1:11:30] the garments of salvation
[1:11:33] he had covered me with a rope of
[1:11:35] righteousness
[1:11:37] so how do we show the beauty of Jesus
[1:11:40] covet with the Robes of righteousness
[1:11:43] doing what is right
[1:11:46] regardless of the circumstances
[1:11:49] as a bridegroom decades herself with
[1:11:52] ornaments as a bride I don't like
[1:11:53] herself with her jewels
[1:11:55] Isaiah says again to appoint unto them
[1:11:57] that morning Zion
[1:11:59] to give them Beauty for Ashes
[1:12:03] that's what happens when you give your
[1:12:05] life to Christ
[1:12:07] you're coming from a life of Ashes but
[1:12:10] he's putting his Beauty on you
[1:12:12] give you beautiful ashes the oil of
[1:12:15] Joyful morning
[1:12:16] the Garment of Praise
[1:12:18] for the spirit of heaviness
[1:12:20] that they might be called the Trees of
[1:12:24] Righteousness
[1:12:26] the planting of the Lord that he might
[1:12:29] be glorified
[1:12:31] Romans 13 12 tells us the nicest fire
[1:12:34] spent the days at hand so let us
[1:12:36] therefore cast off the works of darkness
[1:12:38] and let us put on the armor of light
[1:12:42] and brother Paul told us in Ephesians
[1:12:44] that finally my brethren be strong in
[1:12:47] the Lord and in the power of His might
[1:12:49] put on the whole armor of God that ye
[1:12:52] may be able to stand against the walls
[1:12:54] of the devil
[1:12:56] he told us we don't wrestle against
[1:12:58] flesh and blood
[1:12:59] we're resting against principalities
[1:13:01] against Powers against the rulers of the
[1:13:04] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:13:06] wickedness in high places
[1:13:10] so he said for that reason we should
[1:13:11] take on the whole armor of God that we
[1:13:14] might be able to withstand in the evil
[1:13:16] day and having done all to stand
[1:13:22] now how do we
[1:13:24] equip ourselves with the armor of God
[1:13:28] he said stand therefore having your
[1:13:30] loins got about with truth
[1:13:33] truth Thy word is truth
[1:13:38] and having on the breastplate of
[1:13:39] righteousness
[1:13:41] the breastplate is always in the front
[1:13:43] the breastplate is what you see first
[1:13:47] let people see us and see the
[1:13:49] righteousness of Christ in US
[1:13:51] let people see us and see the beauty of
[1:13:54] Christ in us when we you know when we're
[1:13:56] in our workplaces when we are doing our
[1:13:57] businesses don't let's you know go with
[1:14:01] the world and tell White Lies
[1:14:04] right lies I don't know if we use that
[1:14:07] technology here or that saying here but
[1:14:09] yeah it's it's it's almost the truth but
[1:14:12] not exactly the truth
[1:14:15] but let's be sincere
[1:14:17] let's let them be able to say if you
[1:14:19] want to know the truth go and meet this
[1:14:21] person
[1:14:22] they're the ones in school let them be
[1:14:24] able to say if you want to know the
[1:14:26] truth go and meet this person because I
[1:14:28] know they will always tell the truth
[1:14:34] and your feet shot with the preparation
[1:14:35] of the gospel of peace above all taking
[1:14:37] the shield of Faith where we we are with
[1:14:40] ye shall be able to quench all the fairy
[1:14:42] darts of the wicked and take the
[1:14:45] elements of Salvation And The Sword of
[1:14:47] the spirits which is the word of God
[1:14:48] said praying always
[1:14:51] with all prayer and supplication in the
[1:14:53] spirit and watching there unto with all
[1:14:56] perseverance and supplication for all
[1:14:58] things
[1:15:00] and one of the things that we know
[1:15:03] is that the reason why we are here to be
[1:15:06] manifested is because it's preparing us
[1:15:08] for our home
[1:15:10] so it's clothing Us in his righteousness
[1:15:13] so that we might be acceptable before
[1:15:16] him that on the day when he will say oh
[1:15:18] I'm pulling up I'm pulling out your
[1:15:20] cards or he's saying that I'm taking you
[1:15:22] up in the rapture we might be acceptable
[1:15:25] and Paul told us he said for we know
[1:15:27] that if our Earthly House of this
[1:15:29] Tabernacle were dissolved
[1:15:32] and many times when we actually look at
[1:15:34] this Earthly body you
[1:15:36] you see how quickly it starts to
[1:15:38] to lose its strength
[1:15:41] right and uh you know when we're young
[1:15:45] it's
[1:15:45] you feel like you can carry the entire
[1:15:48] world on your shoulders and you start to
[1:15:50] get to that fourth floor and things
[1:15:53] start to change
[1:15:56] so it's telling us if this Earthly
[1:15:58] Tabernacle the Earthly House of this
[1:16:00] Tabernacle were dissolved
[1:16:03] we have a building of God
[1:16:06] and house not made with hands he
[1:16:08] channeled in the heavens he said for in
[1:16:11] this one we groan
[1:16:13] we are groaning because we fall sick
[1:16:15] we're groaning because we fail God
[1:16:17] because our flesh gets in the way
[1:16:21] but we are not just groaning we're
[1:16:24] earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon
[1:16:28] with a house which is from heaven
[1:16:32] so it gives us his righteousness I think
[1:16:34] what Barry was talking about that we
[1:16:36] have a down payment of our Redemption
[1:16:39] when you receive the Holy Ghost you have
[1:16:42] received a down payment
[1:16:44] what's a down payment a down payment is
[1:16:47] like a deposit
[1:16:49] you get the Redemption of your soul
[1:16:53] but there's still some more to do in the
[1:16:56] future
[1:16:58] in the future the full Redemption
[1:17:00] includes the Redemption of our body
[1:17:04] where we will never die
[1:17:06] I heard somebody say this but I never
[1:17:08] thought about it before that time do you
[1:17:10] know what is going to build I think but
[1:17:12] the very said it do you know what's
[1:17:13] going to be like to live for a thousand
[1:17:16] years
[1:17:18] on this Earth
[1:17:20] not heaven on this Earth
[1:17:22] but no school
[1:17:24] no work no getting old
[1:17:28] nor having to feel tired
[1:17:32] there is nothing to worry about no bad
[1:17:35] feelings towards anybody
[1:17:37] no evil
[1:17:39] for a thousand years
[1:17:44] I can't imagine it
[1:17:47] it will blow
[1:17:48] your mind to even think about it
[1:17:51] but that's the promise that we had
[1:17:55] that is the full payment of our
[1:17:58] Redemption
[1:17:59] that is where we are going
[1:18:01] that is why all the efforts were put in
[1:18:04] that's the reason we come to church
[1:18:06] that's the reason we listen to tapes at
[1:18:09] home that's the reason when we do
[1:18:11] something wrong we can't wait to repent
[1:18:13] of it
[1:18:14] and we go crying to God and say Lord I'm
[1:18:17] so sorry
[1:18:19] that's the reason when we hear the word
[1:18:21] of God something drops in our heart and
[1:18:24] we cannot just control our emotions
[1:18:26] anymore
[1:18:28] because there's a down payment there
[1:18:31] she said he saw that being clothed we
[1:18:33] shall not be found naked for we are in
[1:18:36] this for we that are in this Tabernacle
[1:18:39] do groan been burdened not for that
[1:18:44] we will be on clothed but clothed upon
[1:18:47] that mortality might be swallowed up of
[1:18:50] life
[1:18:51] Ram said in birth pains he said the
[1:18:53] Bible said his wife has made herself
[1:18:56] ready
[1:18:57] at the End of the Age
[1:19:00] do you notice he said his wife
[1:19:04] Revelation he's always talked about the
[1:19:06] bride in the first part you know the
[1:19:08] bride the bride the bride he gets to the
[1:19:10] last part and when he was going to
[1:19:12] introduce the school man he introduces r
[1:19:15] as the wife
[1:19:18] why because the marriage is happening
[1:19:20] right now
[1:19:23] that invisible Union is happening now
[1:19:27] but Abraham said at the end of the age
[1:19:29] the Bible said his wife has made herself
[1:19:32] ready how did she make herself ready
[1:19:37] to becoming his wife
[1:19:39] Remember by the time she's wife a
[1:19:42] relationship has happened
[1:19:43] the consummation has happened she has
[1:19:47] taken on his seed in our womb
[1:19:52] and what does and what does she what
[1:19:55] kind of a garment she had on but the RAM
[1:19:58] said she had on his own word
[1:20:00] she was dressed in his righteousness
[1:20:03] said that's what is it's his right and
[1:20:06] brother Brian gave us you know I was
[1:20:08] just close with this musicians maybe you
[1:20:09] can come
[1:20:11] was talking about a vision that he saw
[1:20:13] and he told us about this in recognizing
[1:20:15] your day and its message
[1:20:17] and I think this just kind of
[1:20:21] wraps up our thoughts tonight
[1:20:25] that God decided to show his prophet
[1:20:29] two different Brides
[1:20:32] he showed that the world bright
[1:20:35] and I want us to remember that
[1:20:38] when we talk about the fact that
[1:20:41] all through the church ages God had a
[1:20:44] bride
[1:20:46] but she kept organizing she kept leaving
[1:20:49] the word and God kept rejecting her we
[1:20:52] should always remember that at a point
[1:20:54] she was God's bride just like vashti was
[1:20:57] Queen
[1:21:00] at some point God's move was the
[1:21:03] Pentecostals
[1:21:04] Azusa Street was not a put on Azusa
[1:21:08] Street was the move of God
[1:21:11] and at that time if you wanted to find
[1:21:13] where God was you had to be in that
[1:21:16] group
[1:21:18] but from what I heard they said one of
[1:21:21] the most popular prophecies
[1:21:24] when that Revival was on is that God
[1:21:27] kept telling them if you organize I will
[1:21:30] leave you
[1:21:31] and I don't think it took up to three
[1:21:33] years or just about three years or three
[1:21:35] and a half years and they organized and
[1:21:37] he left them
[1:21:39] so but the brand saw a vision
[1:21:42] and in the vision he saw this people
[1:21:47] when they started out they were like us
[1:21:49] their women did not wear
[1:21:51] pants
[1:21:53] they had long hair they did the things
[1:21:56] that the word said they should do
[1:21:59] as a matter of fact I think if I'm not
[1:22:01] mistaking
[1:22:03] some of them probably baptized in the
[1:22:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:09] I mean I'm not 100 sure on that but what
[1:22:12] I'm sure about is I was seeing an
[1:22:14] interview of some of them and they
[1:22:15] talked about
[1:22:16] when they received the Holy Ghost and
[1:22:18] they started to speak in tongues and I
[1:22:20] was asking this woman
[1:22:22] what was it like
[1:22:24] I said oh we had people from different
[1:22:25] parts of the world
[1:22:27] they were hearing these people in their
[1:22:29] own local languages
[1:22:31] just like it was on the day of Pentecost
[1:22:35] not the one they are doing today that
[1:22:37] they out they have to teach you how to
[1:22:39] speak in tongues
[1:22:41] I don't want to share my experience
[1:22:42] those years when I was
[1:22:44] I was finding myself in that group
[1:22:47] but they'll push your head until you say
[1:22:49] something
[1:22:52] so what am I trying to say this bride
[1:22:54] started out right
[1:22:57] but she got to a point I'm going to
[1:22:59] quickly read what Abraham here
[1:23:01] where she became naked
[1:23:05] the Bible said that I remember that
[1:23:07] vision of last week
[1:23:08] that when the bride came
[1:23:11] to be preview of it there came up a
[1:23:14] little bright lovely in the vision and
[1:23:16] I'm not thinking about it just sitting
[1:23:18] there watching outside
[1:23:19] and there come the bride I had a voice
[1:23:22] by the side of me saying here is a
[1:23:25] preview of The Bride
[1:23:27] and she came by I noticed her the way
[1:23:30] she was very lovely pretty young she was
[1:23:34] working just the step as she could not a
[1:23:38] much just in the stride of a woman
[1:23:41] how the work gracefully ladylike
[1:23:46] that's the way she was walking coming to
[1:23:49] my left on this side and she went on my
[1:23:52] side
[1:23:53] and he turned me to the right side
[1:23:56] and he showed me each church as they've
[1:23:59] come up out of the ages
[1:24:03] and oh how vulgar
[1:24:06] and the last one was this last day
[1:24:09] Church age which was led by a witch
[1:24:14] and they were so immorally dressed
[1:24:17] so filthy looking and they were matching
[1:24:21] the time of twist and rock and roll
[1:24:26] and those women throwing themselves just
[1:24:29] in twists and holding just paper great
[1:24:33] hypocritical
[1:24:35] the gray is between a white and a black
[1:24:37] which is a deceiving color gray is
[1:24:40] neither white nor black
[1:24:42] it's a deceiving color
[1:24:43] and gray looking paper holding in front
[1:24:46] of them
[1:24:47] with less like hula skirts holding in
[1:24:50] front of them and completely nude from
[1:24:54] their waist up
[1:24:56] I was marching
[1:24:59] or type of twisting and carrying on with
[1:25:01] that music working up
[1:25:03] and said the voice told me the Bram said
[1:25:06] that's the church
[1:25:07] a small Sea church
[1:25:09] and when it passed by me my heart like
[1:25:11] fainted
[1:25:13] I thought if that's what is trying to be
[1:25:17] presented to Christ as a bride of all
[1:25:19] the efforts and the things that man has
[1:25:22] put forth to try to bring for the bride
[1:25:25] for Christ and a vulgar dirty filthy
[1:25:29] looking prostitute like that
[1:25:31] to be the bride of Christ
[1:25:34] Graham said it made me sick at my heart
[1:25:39] and as she passed coming before where we
[1:25:41] were standing she was all on the paper
[1:25:44] in front of our twisting and rocking and
[1:25:45] moving herself one side and then the
[1:25:47] other side as she went like the modern
[1:25:50] dances they have of this day using
[1:25:53] herself in an immoral act as she was
[1:25:56] marching on
[1:25:58] LeBron said I'm not responsible for
[1:26:00] these things I can only see what I seen
[1:26:03] and God has my judge but that was the
[1:26:06] church from USA
[1:26:09] now as she passed by the old back Parks
[1:26:12] had no covering at all
[1:26:15] and then as she passed by I felt faint
[1:26:19] and sickly
[1:26:22] then he said the bride will come into
[1:26:25] preview again
[1:26:27] and here the bride came behind her the
[1:26:30] very same looking bride that passed at
[1:26:33] the beginning then my heart jumped for
[1:26:36] joy
[1:26:37] to know that there will be a bride
[1:26:41] do we believe that tonight
[1:26:44] does that make us rejoice as well
[1:26:47] he said there will be a bride
[1:26:50] regardless of what's going on in the in
[1:26:53] the world today regardless of how people
[1:26:55] have denied Christ regardless of how
[1:26:58] more and more the church is embracing
[1:27:00] the world and the world has become the
[1:27:03] church and the church become the world
[1:27:04] but there will be a bride
[1:27:09] is a past age for the bride
[1:27:12] it's in the past we are not in the loud
[1:27:14] Asian age we are in the bright age
[1:27:18] but Ram said I know that there will be a
[1:27:20] bride and she will be made of the same
[1:27:23] thing
[1:27:24] and clothed in the same thing
[1:27:27] that the one
[1:27:29] was at the beginning
[1:27:32] we are going to be dressed
[1:27:34] just like the first church
[1:27:37] but first churches I'm not saying the
[1:27:38] the domination church but the first
[1:27:41] church age where the brand said that the
[1:27:43] the Pentecostal age is coming back again
[1:27:47] foreign
[1:27:51] he said there's going to be a time
[1:27:53] where it's going to be like the time of
[1:27:55] ananias and Safir
[1:27:57] that no man don't join himself till then
[1:28:00] because the power of God will be so much
[1:28:02] displayed the righteous the
[1:28:04] righteousness of God will be so much in
[1:28:06] her that no one will come near
[1:28:10] no John Lewis spirit is that what's
[1:28:14] will come near
[1:28:17] she'll be made of the same clean and
[1:28:18] clothing the same thing
[1:28:20] that the one was at the beginning she is
[1:28:23] to be called and I know that is the
[1:28:25] truth but the problem said if that isn't
[1:28:27] truth
[1:28:28] then every Vision that I've had in the
[1:28:31] back has been wrong
[1:28:36] and anyone knows
[1:28:39] not one thing as ever as he ever told us
[1:28:42] but was the truth
[1:28:44] so if every other Vision has come to
[1:28:46] pass
[1:28:47] if we've seen him shout about the lives
[1:28:51] of people and tell them they're going to
[1:28:52] be healed and they got healed then the
[1:28:56] promise
[1:28:57] the vision that there will be a bride
[1:29:00] we also come to pass
[1:29:02] let me just say in closing and
[1:29:04] brotherbraham saw the preview of that
[1:29:06] bride
[1:29:07] he said he saw that
[1:29:09] some of them started stepping out of
[1:29:12] line
[1:29:18] and that's always
[1:29:20] a check for me Lord help me
[1:29:22] so they started stepping out of line
[1:29:25] I said right in the vision he started to
[1:29:28] scream get back in line
[1:29:32] and that's what he was screaming until
[1:29:34] he came out of the vision
[1:29:36] so if I checked my life tonight
[1:29:38] if you check your life tonight and you
[1:29:40] see that you started to step out of the
[1:29:42] line
[1:29:43] hear the word of the messenger
[1:29:46] he had the one of the prophets what has
[1:29:48] he said to us get back in line

[1:33:46] in our little corners

[1:35:54] from you and we thank you Father for
[1:35:57] speaking to us

[1:36:01] Lord there's something that we desire

[1:36:07] father that's you living out through US
[1:36:10] Lord Jesus

[1:36:20] door Fathers as as your your wife will
[1:36:24] do Lord Jesus to everything else in this
[1:36:26] world father lord I can't help but think
[1:36:29] about the message that we heard tonight
[1:36:31] about how the king spoke to the queen
[1:36:34] father and we know the king didn't come
[1:36:36] to the queen himself he sent a messenger
[1:36:40] and that messenger's voice was the voice
[1:36:43] of the king
[1:36:45] father help us to receive that voice of
[1:36:48] the king tonight Lord we know that you
[1:36:50] are the same yesterday today and forever
[1:36:52] and we know that's what the messenger
[1:36:55] for this day said in the church H book
[1:36:57] lord Jesus that father you are just
[1:37:00] unchanging in your ways and that's the
[1:37:02] Keystone of the Bible is that you just
[1:37:04] never change
[1:37:06] father we know that Satan has crept in
[1:37:08] and and and taken this this silly women
[1:37:11] unaware father not knowing that father

[1:37:34] called your wife and father we recognize
[1:37:37] that time lord is today Lord there's
[1:37:40] many wives father but there's way more
[1:37:43] Brides out there father trying to make
[1:37:46] themselves ready but they're not willing
[1:37:47] to just simply close the door to all of
[1:37:50] the other words in this world father
[1:37:52] they want to have some of their perfume
[1:37:54] they want to have some other music some
[1:37:56] other way some other style but father
[1:37:59] those ones who will go from bride to
[1:38:01] wife they're only willing to take your
[1:38:03] word and to clothe herself in your word
[1:38:06] the way that you have ordained for your
[1:38:08] word in this day and we know that's
[1:38:10] through the fivefold ministry Lord help
[1:38:13] us not to stumble at the veil oh Father
