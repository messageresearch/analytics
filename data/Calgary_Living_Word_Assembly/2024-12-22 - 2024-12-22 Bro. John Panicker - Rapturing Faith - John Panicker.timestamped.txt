[1:00:17] Lord you are worthy of all honor all
[1:00:20] glory and all praise Lord I ask a small
[1:00:23] prayer in the name of our Lord and
[1:00:24] Savior Jesus Christ amen
[1:00:28] amen while we are standing we'll read
[1:00:31] from the book of
[1:00:34] Hebrews chapter
[1:00:41] 11 thank you musicians God bless you my
[1:00:44] brothers amen and
[1:00:50] sisters here we
[1:00:52] go we will read uh for the first five
[1:00:56] verses uh I will read here you have it
[1:00:59] up here yeah now Faith is the substance
[1:01:02] of things hoped for and the evidence of
[1:01:06] Things Not Seen for by it the elders
[1:01:10] obtained a good report through faith we
[1:01:13] understand that the worlds were framed
[1:01:16] by the word of God so that the things
[1:01:19] which are seen were were not made of
[1:01:23] things which do appear
[1:01:26] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:01:31] excellent sacrifice than
[1:01:33] Cain by which he obtained a witness that
[1:01:36] he was righteous God testifying of his
[1:01:39] gifts and by it he being dead yet
[1:01:44] speaketh now the last verse that we're
[1:01:46] going to read now by faith Enoch was
[1:01:50] translated that he should not see death
[1:01:53] and was not found because God had
[1:01:56] translated him for before his
[1:01:59] translation he had a testimony that he
[1:02:02] pleased God amen amen may the Lord add
[1:02:06] blessings to the word we'll have a small
[1:02:09] prayer uh thank you Lord for this word
[1:02:11] that you've given us today Lord we pray
[1:02:14] to you Lord anoint it to our hearts Lord
[1:02:17] and Lord teach us from your word we have
[1:02:20] come here to learn from you Lord we want
[1:02:23] to be changed oh all glory and all honor
[1:02:26] Belongs to You Lord in the name of Lord
[1:02:28] Jesus Christ we ask this prayer amen
[1:02:31] amen uh please be
[1:02:37] seated it is actually wonderful to be in
[1:02:40] the house of the Lord amen you know when
[1:02:42] we come inside this door the fact that
[1:02:46] we are able to come inside here Amen in
[1:02:49] itself is a big victory you know because
[1:02:53] said in the message that you know uh we
[1:02:55] We Are One in a Million you know the
[1:02:58] chair that you see that you're sitting
[1:02:59] in here about a million people were
[1:03:03] contending for this place but they
[1:03:06] couldn't make it right you know but for
[1:03:09] some reason how I don't know we can't
[1:03:12] say but God brought you
[1:03:15] here he left all of them
[1:03:18] outside and the fact is that there you
[1:03:21] you know we know that apart from or
[1:03:24] outside of this message there is going
[1:03:27] to be no
[1:03:28] Rapture you know uh Christianity I
[1:03:31] believe is still the largest religion in
[1:03:34] the world you know Islam comes second
[1:03:37] but in spite of being the largest
[1:03:40] religion the Salvation you know
[1:03:43] everybody's looking forward to a Rapture
[1:03:45] everybody is looking forward to the
[1:03:47] coming of the Lord everybody says that
[1:03:48] we'll meet him in the sky and you know
[1:03:50] in the cloud and you know we'll be taken
[1:03:52] up but the fact is
[1:03:57] that is not how Rapture is going to
[1:03:59] happen right because most of the people
[1:04:03] who are going in the Rapture are already
[1:04:07] in the
[1:04:08] Rapture right now Rapture okay I forgot
[1:04:13] to tell you the topic that I'm going to
[1:04:15] preach on is rapturing
[1:04:19] Faith right
[1:04:22] so coming back now
[1:04:26] this faith that we were talking about
[1:04:29] today that you know that we read here
[1:04:32] said faith is
[1:04:36] a that the Bible says faith is substance
[1:04:38] but brother said faith is a
[1:04:41] revelation right can you repeat faith is
[1:04:45] a revelation right it is a revelation
[1:04:48] from God yeah now what happens is there
[1:04:52] are different kinds of Faith different
[1:04:54] levels of Faith you know sometimes like
[1:04:56] for example uh when we look at the first
[1:04:58] pull the first pull uh you know in the
[1:05:02] Bible says that uh gifts and callings
[1:05:04] are without repentance you know uh
[1:05:07] healing of the sick and you know a lot
[1:05:09] of other things like you know casting
[1:05:12] out of demons and stuff this you don't
[1:05:15] need to be really saved to do this you
[1:05:17] know you don't need to have salvation of
[1:05:19] you know anybody can do it you know even
[1:05:21] a non-believer can do it right so you
[1:05:24] have to understand that there are
[1:05:25] different kinds of faith and the kind of
[1:05:27] faith that we are going to focus on
[1:05:29] today is the faith which will translate
[1:05:32] us the faith that translated Enoch amen
[1:05:37] okay now when we when we talk about
[1:05:40] faith
[1:05:41] here the first pull was healing of the
[1:05:45] sick okay now uh before I go further I
[1:05:49] want to also you know uh give a small uh
[1:05:52] this thing here Point here that the
[1:05:55] message that I'm going to preach today
[1:05:57] that I have here is going to be a little
[1:05:59] deep it's going to be slightly deep now
[1:06:02] when I say deep I don't mean like you
[1:06:04] know I'm going to preach from organic
[1:06:06] chemistry no it's not going to be that
[1:06:08] kind of deep the deep is like you know I
[1:06:10] will tell you when Jesus Christ was
[1:06:12] preaching he went to Israel and then he
[1:06:15] was saying like you know uh people uh
[1:06:17] there was a person who is coming who is
[1:06:19] sowing seeds you know and he sowed seeds
[1:06:21] and the seed fell in good ground seed
[1:06:24] fell by the side of the road and the
[1:06:26] seed fell uh you know in thorns in
[1:06:29] bushes okay and the people thought that
[1:06:34] Jesus is preaching
[1:06:37] agriculture yeah they everybody thought
[1:06:39] oh yeah this is too simple we already
[1:06:41] know you know we know where to se our
[1:06:43] seeds you know we know this is this is
[1:06:45] farming we've been doing it for
[1:06:46] centuries now you know right but what he
[1:06:50] was saying was something else right
[1:06:54] right now this is where the difference
[1:06:56] comes in between Revelation and
[1:06:59] information that's right okay we have a
[1:07:02] lot of information but when you see that
[1:07:04] you know you're in a house and you know
[1:07:06] the house is in Fire and everything is
[1:07:08] burning and you're still sitting there
[1:07:10] that means you have information but the
[1:07:13] moment you realize that you're going to
[1:07:14] burn you have to run you have to escape
[1:07:16] from there that is revelation right it
[1:07:19] puts you in
[1:07:21] action right information yeah I know the
[1:07:24] American dollar is right Rising it is
[1:07:26] falling I have information so what you
[1:07:28] know the Bitcoins are going high it's
[1:07:31] coming down I have information yeah good
[1:07:33] but the moment you realize that oh you
[1:07:35] know what I can do this and I can
[1:07:37] benefit from that you know that is a
[1:07:40] revelation that you get so this is the
[1:07:41] difference between Revelation and
[1:07:43] information okay now we are focusing on
[1:07:47] not just information there's a lot of
[1:07:49] information in the Bible amen there's a
[1:07:51] lot of information everywhere you know
[1:07:53] the denominations are talking about it
[1:07:55] the heathens are talking about it
[1:07:58] but there is something which only the
[1:08:02] Chosen and the elect know righten and
[1:08:06] like I said when we come inside this
[1:08:08] building you know actually this building
[1:08:10] means nothing I'm saying is that when we
[1:08:12] congregate okay when we become a part of
[1:08:14] the body of Christ okay now you have to
[1:08:17] understand that when this happens with
[1:08:20] us we are something really special amen
[1:08:24] special why special
[1:08:26] because each one of us okay when we come
[1:08:30] into this body of Christ we are directly
[1:08:33] connected to the lineage of Adam right
[1:08:37] okay otherwise we were all born in sin
[1:08:39] we were like you know going here there
[1:08:41] doing this that and all but then there
[1:08:44] was a secret that Adam knew yes he had a
[1:08:47] book inside of him amen okay which once
[1:08:50] because of whatever he misplaced or you
[1:08:53] know he went off and he doesn't have it
[1:08:55] anymore but then he had a
[1:08:59] descendant his name was Ino okay now
[1:09:04] Hano fellowshipped with Adam right okay
[1:09:09] because Adam died if you if you look at
[1:09:10] the geney uh Genesis 5 it tells you that
[1:09:14] you know uh Adam lived for almost a
[1:09:17] thousand he couldn't complete one day
[1:09:18] because you know they said that the day
[1:09:20] you eat of thereof you shall die so he
[1:09:22] could not complete that one day he he
[1:09:24] died before you know thousand years were
[1:09:26] over
[1:09:28] but thankfully Enoch got to fellowship
[1:09:31] with Adam yes okay so he could tell him
[1:09:35] that you know what this is where you're
[1:09:37] coming from ano this is where you're
[1:09:40] coming from am you know you were not
[1:09:42] always we were not always like this you
[1:09:45] know we were not always you know falling
[1:09:47] sick and hungry and all those things no
[1:09:50] this is only after a certain time this
[1:09:52] happened but we were not like this since
[1:09:54] the beginning right since the beginning
[1:09:56] we were different that's right okay so
[1:09:58] Adam used to you know tell and you know
[1:10:03] you understand now what happens is when
[1:10:06] I say that you know uh I have to speak
[1:10:09] on rapturing faith rapturing faith once
[1:10:13] again is a revelation Revelation which
[1:10:16] is handed down from your family to only
[1:10:21] your family okay it runs through a
[1:10:24] bloodline
[1:10:26] okay it does not you know it does not go
[1:10:29] outside the family you know why because
[1:10:33] Adam after Adam Sai and then you know
[1:10:36] lame matusa and all those people and you
[1:10:38] know the the secret or the seed you know
[1:10:40] travel like that like that like that
[1:10:42] came keep coming down in the same way
[1:10:45] now we from Jesus time we are the
[1:10:48] Seventh Generation once again okay why
[1:10:52] because we are the seventh Church age
[1:10:55] although we don't live in the sixth or
[1:10:57] seventh Church age anymore we are not in
[1:11:00] laia we've come out of laia we are in
[1:11:03] the bride age okay but still we are
[1:11:05] under the seventh messenger okay and it
[1:11:08] is the seventh from Adam that saw the
[1:11:11] translation of his body okay so you to
[1:11:15] understand that we are in a very
[1:11:16] interesting position right now we are in
[1:11:18] very interest interesting why
[1:11:20] interesting because we are in a place
[1:11:23] where most of the problem Prophets The
[1:11:26] you know Apostles all those people
[1:11:29] wanted to be they wanted to see this
[1:11:31] time they wanted to see how the king of
[1:11:33] glory comes in you know and how people
[1:11:36] are changed alive you know and we have
[1:11:40] all that for us am okay like it or not
[1:11:43] we didn't choose it we didn't we didn't
[1:11:45] even know about it but somehow amen you
[1:11:49] know God just called you out you know
[1:11:52] each one of you hey you you you you you
[1:11:54] you y you know I was born somewhere in
[1:11:56] south of India Kerala my parents they uh
[1:12:00] you know met in another Province and
[1:12:01] then you know they came to New Delhi for
[1:12:04] uh their work and stuff and you know our
[1:12:08] previous Pastor in Delhi you know he got
[1:12:10] the message in Bombay then he traveled
[1:12:12] to Delhi the church was established
[1:12:14] there and somehow all things worked in
[1:12:17] such a way that the message you know
[1:12:20] brought us here me here you from
[1:12:22] different parts of the world now we are
[1:12:24] join Point here and you know the Bible
[1:12:27] very categorically says that you know
[1:12:30] there are two people one you know in a
[1:12:33] bed and another you know in the field
[1:12:35] two in the bed and two in the field one
[1:12:37] will be taken one will be left have you
[1:12:39] have you read that scripture now uh I
[1:12:42] would want to ask you one thing when
[1:12:44] this one is taken up okay out of these
[1:12:47] two there are two of everything you know
[1:12:49] you want to read it it is uh in Luke 17
[1:12:51] I
[1:12:52] believe I have it right here
[1:12:55] Luke
[1:12:57] 1734 I think is the
[1:13:00] scripture I want you to read 34 35 and
[1:13:06] 36 okay uh brother Daniel can you help
[1:13:09] me reading the Bible you know it gives
[1:13:12] me a little bit more uh time probably
[1:13:16] yeah
[1:13:18] here it's kind of helpful yeah if you
[1:13:20] can read the
[1:13:23] verse yeah
[1:13:25] Luke 1734
[1:13:29] 3536 yeah I tell you in that night there
[1:13:33] shall be two men in one bed the one
[1:13:35] shall be taken and the other shall be
[1:13:37] left two women shall be grinding
[1:13:41] together the one shall be taken and the
[1:13:43] other left two men shall be in the field
[1:13:47] the one shall be taken and the other
[1:13:48] left now the one that is
[1:13:51] taken where is he taken
[1:14:00] anybody one is taken and one is left
[1:14:04] okay so the one who is taken where is he
[1:14:09] taken yeah I can't hear
[1:14:12] you yeah the Rapture somebody said the
[1:14:16] Rapture and I would say yes that is
[1:14:18] right okay so let us read the next verse
[1:14:25] and they answered and said unto him
[1:14:27] where Lord and he said unto them
[1:14:29] wheresoever the body is thither will the
[1:14:32] Eagles be gather together amen so you
[1:14:35] know that you know you said right they
[1:14:37] are captured in the Rapture but not in
[1:14:41] the
[1:14:42] clouds not in the
[1:14:45] clouds okay because Rapture is a
[1:14:48] three-step
[1:14:49] process what are the three steps of
[1:14:51] rapture okay I'll tell you huh does even
[1:14:56] shout voice and
[1:15:00] Trump okay shout okay repeat shout voice
[1:15:06] Trump yeah these are three steps of the
[1:15:08] Rapture okay it doesn't happen and you
[1:15:11] know just you know you're raptured no it
[1:15:14] it has got shout voice and Trump what
[1:15:17] does shout do shout gathers the living
[1:15:21] bride okay shout gathers the living
[1:15:24] bride
[1:15:25] so now what has happened here is that
[1:15:28] the shout goes out what is the shout the
[1:15:29] message the message came through the
[1:15:32] prophet it goes out throughout the world
[1:15:34] you know like person like me living in
[1:15:36] India in you know born somewhere and all
[1:15:39] no way I can meet the prophet in America
[1:15:42] I was born several years after he was
[1:15:45] gone off the sea you know no but it was
[1:15:48] not the prophet who searched for me it
[1:15:51] the message who came for me understand
[1:15:53] that same for all of us you know the
[1:15:57] prophet spoke it and the message came to
[1:16:01] life it is looking for its own right in
[1:16:05] every country in every village every
[1:16:08] corner of this world the message goes it
[1:16:10] picks its own doesn't matter what
[1:16:12] background you're from doesn't matter
[1:16:14] how holy or how Unholy you are doesn't
[1:16:17] matter because it's not about your
[1:16:18] Holiness whatsoever right so the message
[1:16:21] goes out it's it picks its own okay it
[1:16:24] takes takes one and it leaves the
[1:16:26] other okay it takes one and it leaves
[1:16:29] the other now this is the first step so
[1:16:32] the first step is shout now the second
[1:16:35] step is wise okay when the bride comes
[1:16:39] together now you you read this they are
[1:16:41] not all raptured and gone up in heaven
[1:16:43] they
[1:16:44] say wheresoever the body is thither will
[1:16:48] the Eagles be gathered together okay so
[1:16:53] where is the body
[1:16:55] this is the body amen body word yeah so
[1:16:59] we come here together every week twice
[1:17:04] in a week to eat from this
[1:17:08] body okay and when we do that we are
[1:17:11] changing okay we are in the process so
[1:17:14] if you believe that you know you are in
[1:17:17] the Rapture you might as well start
[1:17:20] eating that's right right right and you
[1:17:23] might as well start being here am
[1:17:27] because people who are raptured have an
[1:17:29] address Hallelujah yeah people who are
[1:17:32] raptured have an address they are not at
[1:17:34] home they are not here they are not
[1:17:37] there they're they are where the word
[1:17:41] is yeah they are where the word is right
[1:17:45] so it doesn't matter what you want to do
[1:17:49] how you are your back nothing matters it
[1:17:52] is the word that cleanses you okay this
[1:17:55] word no matter where you're coming from
[1:17:56] what your understanding is what your
[1:17:58] thoughts are nothing doing no problem
[1:18:01] just come to the word okay just come
[1:18:04] here and take life take eternal life
[1:18:08] okay so that is the reason what
[1:18:10] motivates us to be here because you know
[1:18:12] our names are here not in the church
[1:18:14] list but in the list for the
[1:18:17] Rapture okay so no matter where you are
[1:18:20] you know I'm again emphasizing on the
[1:18:22] fact that you know every empty chair
[1:18:25] here has got a million people who have
[1:18:29] lost this opportunity right okay they
[1:18:33] are still very religious more sincere
[1:18:36] than us okay more hardworking than us
[1:18:40] okay more dedicated than us okay but
[1:18:45] couldn't make it okay so you are the
[1:18:48] people who are right here right now are
[1:18:51] an elite group of people when I say
[1:18:54] Elite I really mean
[1:18:58] Elite like you know there is this you
[1:19:01] know when we go in Calgary you know in
[1:19:02] the downtown you have peace officers
[1:19:04] okay now peace officers you see them
[1:19:07] everywhere but there is another team
[1:19:09] that they said you know that is there
[1:19:11] you don't see them often but it is
[1:19:13] called s SW a t they are special weapons
[1:19:18] and tactics okay now these people don't
[1:19:22] the roam around the strees like that you
[1:19:23] know you can't find them but but you are
[1:19:26] the s sw8 in the message you know why
[1:19:30] I'll tell you the reason why because you
[1:19:32] have a need okay you go to the Bible you
[1:19:35] read it you have a need God will do
[1:19:40] anything for you
[1:19:42] anything okay once Joshua was fighting a
[1:19:46] battle okay and he said that you know I
[1:19:48] need more sunlight amen he he did not go
[1:19:51] through physics and you know all that
[1:19:53] things he just said Son stand still and
[1:19:57] you know what God obliged the sun had to
[1:20:02] stand even though it is not rotating we
[1:20:05] know it was not reol the Earth is
[1:20:06] revolving
[1:20:08] okay that's what but then he didn't have
[1:20:11] to go through you know the
[1:20:12] technicalities of how you know it will
[1:20:14] happen because science says that
[1:20:17] anything which is in rotation in an
[1:20:19] orbit you know when you ride a bicycle
[1:20:22] or when you ride a mono cycle or uh you
[1:20:25] know whatever as long as you're in
[1:20:27] motion you stay and straight okay when
[1:20:30] you stop you
[1:20:32] fall in the same way when the Earth is
[1:20:35] rotating it is in its place in its orbit
[1:20:38] if the Earth stops rotating okay it'll
[1:20:41] fall like a
[1:20:42] ball down into space so when Joshua said
[1:20:48] Son stand still you know the word of God
[1:20:52] swiftly came held the Earth in that
[1:20:54] place that's right so that he can have
[1:20:56] more
[1:20:57] sunlight right you have to understand
[1:21:00] and that is what you are capable of I am
[1:21:05] capable of you know what a magnificent
[1:21:07] God we serve the only problem is today
[1:21:10] we are living a lot below
[1:21:14] our yeah you know it yes yeah so the
[1:21:18] thing is I have come here today to tell
[1:21:22] you that Rapture is is going to happen
[1:21:26] yeah okay I can't set the date I don't
[1:21:28] know the date I don't know the time but
[1:21:30] I will tell you something the signs of
[1:21:33] the time okay will definitely tell you
[1:21:36] that we are in the cycle in the process
[1:21:39] the process is started okay many people
[1:21:42] think that you know oh we Christians you
[1:21:44] know you only you are the few people you
[1:21:47] know few people who are going to go in
[1:21:48] the Rapture what about the rest of the
[1:21:50] Christianity you know so many good
[1:21:51] people will God leave all of them I
[1:21:53] don't know about then maybe sometime
[1:21:55] later they come in the message I can't
[1:21:56] say but definitely one thing I can say
[1:21:59] is that if you don't have the word there
[1:22:03] is no way you're
[1:22:05] going absolutely no way you're going no
[1:22:08] matter how good how hardworking how
[1:22:10] dedicated I have to emphasize and
[1:22:12] emphasize it and the more I say the less
[1:22:15] it is because you have to understand
[1:22:16] that it is not possible we can't do it
[1:22:19] by ourselves the word is coming for the
[1:22:21] word amen okay the word is is coming for
[1:22:25] the world like you know in the Rapture
[1:22:26] will this Bible still be left or will
[1:22:28] God take it I don't know but whoever
[1:22:31] this Bible is inside God will definitely
[1:22:34] take them amen yeah if you have the word
[1:22:36] inside of you you are going okay because
[1:22:40] if you see uh the first coming of Christ
[1:22:43] is a example for the second coming okay
[1:22:46] in the first coming what happened Jesus
[1:22:48] didn't just come and go like this it
[1:22:51] took him a good 33 and A2 years he was
[1:22:53] born on one day then he you know grew
[1:22:58] for about 30 years then he came into the
[1:23:00] ministry for another three and a half
[1:23:02] years and that is when he died on the
[1:23:04] cross and he went up okay so the first
[1:23:06] coming like you said it is not going to
[1:23:09] happen it's not a twinkling of an eye
[1:23:11] our bodies will change in a twinkling of
[1:23:12] an eye but the coming of the Lord is a
[1:23:15] process it started on one day it will
[1:23:18] end one day it'll end with us
[1:23:21] translating okay so it's a process it's
[1:23:24] not one day event or a you know the
[1:23:26] Rapture is a process but changing of our
[1:23:29] bodies is yeah probably a twinkle of an
[1:23:31] eye you know and we'll be
[1:23:32] changed
[1:23:34] now when we talk about rapturing faith
[1:23:37] you also have to understand that
[1:23:40] rapturing faith and faith is a
[1:23:42] revelation right okay again faith is a
[1:23:46] revelation and this is you know you have
[1:23:48] to hold on to this because anybody who
[1:23:52] is going in the Rapture will definitely
[1:23:54] have
[1:23:56] Revelation okay revelation of his
[1:23:58] Rapture that's right okay and that is
[1:24:00] important because without that you know
[1:24:02] there's no going anywhere you know
[1:24:06] now a little bit more I want to speak on
[1:24:09] this but uh I I also want to tell you
[1:24:11] you know there are certain things which
[1:24:13] happened before I came here to Calgary
[1:24:16] you know uh it took me almost 2 years to
[1:24:21] actually you know get all the things
[1:24:23] done my brother
[1:24:25] applied for a Visa for us on the 1st of
[1:24:27] January
[1:24:29] 2022 okay he did that and then you know
[1:24:33] it was so slow so slow we forgot all
[1:24:36] about it you know and then year pass
[1:24:39] several months passed years passed and
[1:24:42] then you know no news so they were like
[1:24:44] okay it is not meant to be or whatever
[1:24:45] it is so and then in the process we had
[1:24:50] our youngest daughter jamaa was
[1:24:52] born and uh
[1:24:55] one fine day we get a mail from the
[1:24:58] Canadian embassy uh it's almost two
[1:25:00] years after this okay after applying now
[1:25:03] uh they say that you know what quickly
[1:25:05] you have to submit your passports
[1:25:07] because you're you know this thing is
[1:25:09] approved and your you know your Visa you
[1:25:11] have to get your stamped and then when
[1:25:14] that
[1:25:15] happened uh we were like you know we
[1:25:17] were in the middle of our lives
[1:25:19] basically I mean you
[1:25:20] know and uh they gave us almost 20 days
[1:25:23] time to you know wrap everything up
[1:25:25] because yeah you know they also said
[1:25:28] that you know uh you have 20 days
[1:25:29] because your uh medical is going to
[1:25:31] expire in 20 days and then we don't know
[1:25:34] what happens if it expires we didn't
[1:25:36] wait to check you know so somehow you
[1:25:39] know so we had that 2 Years Journey that
[1:25:42] we were in and then you know uh three of
[1:25:45] us me my mom and my wife were here with
[1:25:49] seven kids of course all of my children
[1:25:52] and uh please understand I I'm saying
[1:25:55] this because the you know this is also a
[1:25:57] part of the message okay because it has
[1:25:59] got something to do with all of us so
[1:26:01] you know uh the spiritual mind will
[1:26:03] catch it okay now what happened is that
[1:26:06] you know we're coming from East we
[1:26:07] coming from a far away country all right
[1:26:10] and somehow the message brought us here
[1:26:13] now you know and then suddenly you know
[1:26:15] they are like uh uh okay now about the
[1:26:17] date of coming uh I was supposed to book
[1:26:21] tickets for you know so many people and
[1:26:23] it was a multi ctor flight like you know
[1:26:25] I have to go from Delhi to Bombay Bombay
[1:26:27] to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to Calgary
[1:26:29] because there's no direct connection as
[1:26:30] such and every time you know we're
[1:26:32] trying to do it okay we find Bombay to
[1:26:35] Delhi or Frankfurt then Frankfurt to
[1:26:36] Calgary connection is full so you know
[1:26:38] they don't have enough space for so many
[1:26:40] people to travel at the same time so
[1:26:42] permutation combination permutation
[1:26:44] combination I said finally okay let's
[1:26:46] stop because you know what we forgot to
[1:26:49] you know apply for a Visa for jamaa if
[1:26:52] we can't leave jamaa and go here she's
[1:26:54] like she'll be really angry so we can't
[1:26:57] you
[1:26:58] know yeah she's too small so you know we
[1:27:01] can't leave her and go so you know what
[1:27:04] uh if it is from God uh you know
[1:27:07] everything will work smoothly we will
[1:27:08] get her visa and after getting
[1:27:10] everything in the clear only then we you
[1:27:12] know we go ahead with the tickets so
[1:27:15] okay up and down we submitted her
[1:27:16] passport and stuff and then it took us
[1:27:19] two years for jamama it took less than 2
[1:27:21] weeks and she got her no passport stamp
[1:27:25] and then you know I was like okay wow
[1:27:27] this is fast now uh also just before our
[1:27:33] visas came and you know before this was
[1:27:35] processed something really strange
[1:27:37] happened you know with
[1:27:39] us we found one pigeon okay we found one
[1:27:44] pigeon and uh it was in our house and it
[1:27:47] was a pigon so you know the pigeon is
[1:27:51] inside the house you know it is like
[1:27:53] kind of makes a lot of you know
[1:27:55] disturbance okay you're sitting there
[1:27:57] it'll come and sit on your head right
[1:27:58] here okay and then you know I've got a
[1:28:00] picture of that pigeon on the head okay
[1:28:03] now okay then we thought that why do we
[1:28:05] have a pigeon you know we should let it
[1:28:07] go he should not be you know in the
[1:28:09] house it's a bird and you know it's not
[1:28:11] a pet and we don't know this
[1:28:14] pigon yeah he just you know living with
[1:28:17] us you know I think you should go now so
[1:28:20] uh what happened uh my daughter she took
[1:28:23] the p Pig and like you know we make
[1:28:25] videos because you're sending off a
[1:28:26] pigeon so you know the pigeon will fly
[1:28:28] off and you make nice video so they took
[1:28:31] the pigeon and they let it off and the
[1:28:33] pigon went like this and turned and it
[1:28:36] turned and went right back in the
[1:28:39] house through a window and the window
[1:28:41] surprisingly was closed it was only only
[1:28:44] this much space was there in the window
[1:28:45] okay in spite of that the pigon of the
[1:28:47] entire he left everything else it went
[1:28:50] inside the window back in okay now when
[1:28:53] the Pon went back in and we were like
[1:28:57] okay it doesn't want to go now all right
[1:28:59] let it be so uh you know after sometime
[1:29:02] then we tried again this time it was
[1:29:04] Joseph he took the pigon again he flew
[1:29:07] it away and the pigon again it went and
[1:29:10] it sat on the wall of the building okay
[1:29:13] it sat on the wall of the building and
[1:29:16] then kids were like you know if it sits
[1:29:18] here some cat will come and eat the
[1:29:21] pigeon you know so we might as well just
[1:29:24] get her back in okay oh yeah so then you
[1:29:26] know they climbed and they got the
[1:29:27] pigeon they put it back in the house and
[1:29:30] then uh I don't know what happened to
[1:29:32] the pigon pigon you know uh escaped or
[1:29:35] you know I don't know what do you say
[1:29:37] for disappeared yeah you know somehow
[1:29:39] okay the pigeon thing is
[1:29:41] over now the ticketing came now you know
[1:29:44] if you want I have I have these two
[1:29:46] videos like I said they made the videos
[1:29:48] so brother if you can play you know oh
[1:29:51] yeah see that beautiful pigeon
[1:29:54] it went and sat on the wall this was the
[1:29:56] second time okay it didn't go it is
[1:29:58] sitting right there okay white uh a
[1:30:01] black pigion yeah
[1:30:03] right okay it is sitting right there now
[1:30:06] this is the second uh this is the first
[1:30:07] time that you know Joseph is letting it
[1:30:09] go you see that the pigeon went right
[1:30:12] into that window inside that
[1:30:15] house okay it's not flying away yeah I
[1:30:18] mean uh you know I found it really
[1:30:20] strange that you know why would this
[1:30:22] bird not go out
[1:30:24] so okay this happened so we were like
[1:30:26] okay fine we never connected with
[1:30:28] anything so you know I'm still learning
[1:30:30] I'm I you know we we still you know word
[1:30:33] is still revealing it's still opening so
[1:30:35] we don't know what the uh end is but
[1:30:38] then suddenly you know uh we got our
[1:30:40] tickets and lot of pushing and pulling
[1:30:43] and finally we got our tickets I have
[1:30:45] got a boarding pass there brother can
[1:30:47] you show the boarding pass on it on the
[1:30:49] boarding pass there is a date the date
[1:30:52] on the boarding pass is 23rd can you
[1:30:55] read yeah what does it
[1:30:58] say June 23rd
[1:31:02] 2024 okay now this is typically a Sunday
[1:31:07] and it is absolutely not possible
[1:31:10] because we being in Delhi you know we
[1:31:12] never ever ever never ever travel on
[1:31:16] Sundays never you know like for example
[1:31:19] we have got in a week we have got two
[1:31:20] meetings Sunday and Tuesday so we try to
[1:31:23] do all our you know stuff Wednesday to
[1:31:26] Saturday if at all we have to go for a
[1:31:28] vacation we go between Wednesday and be
[1:31:31] back by Saturday so that we're back in
[1:31:33] church on Sunday now this ticket it was
[1:31:37] really you know and I was just sitting
[1:31:39] there and I was like you know what we
[1:31:40] are going and at least the last service
[1:31:42] on Sunday we should be able to you know
[1:31:44] catch this but then somehow it doesn't I
[1:31:47] me you know there are so many
[1:31:48] connections this one was Delhi to Bombay
[1:31:50] now from bomb it was very difficult so
[1:31:52] finally somehow the travel was able to
[1:31:54] fix this so we were like okay fine this
[1:31:55] is the will of God Let's do let's go
[1:31:57] ahead with it and when this
[1:32:00] happened I was curious I was like why a
[1:32:03] Sunday Lord after all the days you know
[1:32:05] why a Sunday then I just on I went on
[1:32:08] the internet I just checked what happens
[1:32:10] on this day okay so then brother there's
[1:32:13] another photograph there of a screenshot
[1:32:16] that I have
[1:32:18] taken can you show that yeah this is the
[1:32:23] Sunday June 23rd 2004 okay this is the
[1:32:27] Jewish calendar which is Shabbat and
[1:32:30] stuff uh you know Jewish calendar on
[1:32:32] this day and then I checked what
[1:32:34] happened on this day when I checked it
[1:32:37] says on this day
[1:32:40] 2105 BC noa's Ark okay 7 months after
[1:32:46] being after the beginning of the great
[1:32:47] flood 17 days after the water covering
[1:32:50] the Earth began to subside and Ark
[1:32:52] Sheltering NOA his family and all these
[1:32:56] people they came and they you know they
[1:32:59] landed on Mount
[1:33:00] Ararat okay Mount Ararat is the new
[1:33:03] world basically okay so this
[1:33:07] day that was chosen was typically the
[1:33:10] day when NOA or no you know NOA we say
[1:33:14] in Hindi but no landed in the New World
[1:33:18] After the flood okay so somehow you know
[1:33:22] things started to match up
[1:33:24] because NOA left or the dve
[1:33:27] twice and he came coming back you know
[1:33:31] that scripture yeah he kept coming back
[1:33:35] and now the date I did not choose this
[1:33:38] date I don't know what happened you know
[1:33:40] this and you know this Monday when I was
[1:33:43] reading the scripture you know what
[1:33:45] happened you know uh chill ran through
[1:33:48] my spine I don't know this phrase but
[1:33:51] you know you know I was shocked yeah I
[1:33:54] shock because if you
[1:33:59] see NOA that is Genesis
[1:34:04] chapter 6 I believe yeah
[1:34:14] six let's take the days of
[1:34:19] Noah I'm not going to read through the
[1:34:21] whole thing but I just just want to show
[1:34:25] you a few highlights out of it
[1:34:27] okay yeah it is Genesis chapter 7
[1:34:33] actually Genesis chapter
[1:34:37] 7 yeah and Lord said unto NOA Come Thou
[1:34:41] and all thine house into the ark said
[1:34:45] that when somebody says come okay and
[1:34:48] somebody says come into the ark which
[1:34:50] means the person who is saying come is
[1:34:52] already in the ark
[1:34:55] okay when he says that that means he's
[1:34:57] already in the ark so it says that you
[1:34:59] know lord said unto NOA Come Thou and
[1:35:02] thy all thy house in the ARK for thee
[1:35:05] have I seen righteous before me in this
[1:35:07] generation and it goes on like that and
[1:35:09] then if you see uh you
[1:35:11] know slowly if you go ahead we will have
[1:35:15] the dates here
[1:35:17] okay uh we will go to 11th verse 11th
[1:35:22] verse 11th yeah in the 600 year of noa's
[1:35:25] life in the second month the 17th day of
[1:35:29] the month the same day where all the
[1:35:32] fountains of the great deep broken up
[1:35:35] and the windows of Heaven were opened
[1:35:37] okay so this is when the rain started
[1:35:40] okay flood started so if you see this
[1:35:43] this chapter it gives you a day by day
[1:35:48] detail of what happened okay there are
[1:35:52] other scriptures also in the Bible but
[1:35:54] this one gives you the
[1:35:56] dates gives you the dates dates for
[1:35:58] example on the first day when NOA
[1:36:00] entered the Ark and then you know after
[1:36:03] 7 Days the ark the door closed but the
[1:36:06] rain did not
[1:36:09] start and it was only after 7 days if
[1:36:13] you read you know I don't want to go
[1:36:15] because I have very little time I'm like
[1:36:17] you know another 40 minutes so I will be
[1:36:19] very concise but you know you can go
[1:36:21] home and read this chapter chapter 7 it
[1:36:24] gives you the date it gives you all the
[1:36:26] dates and details okay of when NOA
[1:36:29] entered the Ark and then what happened
[1:36:31] and then what happened and then what
[1:36:32] happened so you know these are the
[1:36:35] numbers uh you know where you can see
[1:36:39] the Bible gives categoric dates okay now
[1:36:43] again after this what happened you know
[1:36:45] after coming to Calgary I happened to
[1:36:47] visit a library and stuff and I saw
[1:36:51] that I saw a Jewish calendar
[1:36:54] a hard copy a physical
[1:36:57] calendar and to my surprise every
[1:37:00] calendar has got 12 months a year
[1:37:04] calendar but then this calendar that I
[1:37:07] saw had 16 months on it okay I have a
[1:37:11] picture of that I couldn't get grabb the
[1:37:13] calendar Because by the time I went back
[1:37:14] it was gone so this Jewish calendar has
[1:37:18] got 16th can you see it from there it
[1:37:21] says 16 months from September to to
[1:37:23] December 2025 September 24 to December
[1:37:28] 2025 now I was wondering why would
[1:37:30] anybody make a 16-month
[1:37:32] calendar you know it's supposed to be 12
[1:37:35] months but
[1:37:37] uh actually what happens with Judaism is
[1:37:40] that they have the Feast of the Trumpets
[1:37:44] on the first day of the sth
[1:37:46] month okay so that is their New
[1:37:50] Year okay and also when they were coming
[1:37:54] out of Egypt God gave them another new
[1:37:56] year that is the first of you know close
[1:38:00] to 1 of April you know during that times
[1:38:03] okay so they have two New Years actually
[1:38:06] so they start from the Feast of trumpets
[1:38:10] Raj hashana from there they go on until
[1:38:13] the next full
[1:38:14] year okay so that is why this calendar
[1:38:17] had 16 months now September for some
[1:38:20] reason was uh you know kind of
[1:38:22] interesting month for me because you
[1:38:25] know that is the month when my daughter
[1:38:27] jamaa the youngest one was born now with
[1:38:30] all our other kids okay with all our
[1:38:33] other
[1:38:34] kids my wife put their names uh probably
[1:38:38] uh Alia is the one whom I named but rest
[1:38:40] of the kids my wife now this time I
[1:38:42] thought you know what J when the last
[1:38:44] kid was born the youngest
[1:38:47] one I said you know what I think we will
[1:38:49] ask our pastor to name her because we've
[1:38:51] done it so many times now you know I
[1:38:53] think think I think our pastor should
[1:38:55] also get one chance now on this okay by
[1:38:58] the way my pastor in Delhi lovely person
[1:39:01] I mean you know he's very I I I can't
[1:39:03] just explain you know I I I there's not
[1:39:06] the single day that I don't think about
[1:39:08] you know Pastor there I mean awesome I
[1:39:11] can't just you know words fail me but
[1:39:14] yeah you know so yeah so what happened
[1:39:16] is I I told him that you know we have a
[1:39:18] daughter then you know brother in India
[1:39:20] we don't have uh you know uh this thing
[1:39:23] gender reveal because it is banned you
[1:39:26] know we don't know the gender of the
[1:39:27] child before it is born it is a criminal
[1:39:29] offense to even find out so we don't
[1:39:32] know so only after the child is born
[1:39:34] that we do the naming yeah yeah so we we
[1:39:37] don't do it before that so I called him
[1:39:39] up and I said that you know brother you
[1:39:41] know uh I please if you can just give us
[1:39:43] a name and then he gave us uh the next
[1:39:46] day I you know I was waiting for him the
[1:39:48] next day I called him back again you
[1:39:50] know I have to go for the birth
[1:39:51] certificate so if I get the name I can
[1:39:53] put it on the certificate and get the
[1:39:54] proper certificate and then he said
[1:39:56] brother John I know I think you know
[1:39:57] I've got two options jamaa and grace
[1:40:01] jamaa and grace so I said oh it's too
[1:40:04] hard for me to choose one of these so we
[1:40:06] will put both the names okay so she will
[1:40:08] be jamaa Grace John okay now what
[1:40:11] happened is when he came back home he
[1:40:12] was traveling somewhere so I spoke with
[1:40:14] him on the phone when he came back home
[1:40:17] his wife was like you know I have also
[1:40:20] you know uh kept a name for uh John's
[1:40:23] daughter and uh he said what is it and
[1:40:26] she said it is
[1:40:28] jamaa okay so now what happened is that
[1:40:31] yeah I mean they didn't consult with
[1:40:34] each other and then he told her that you
[1:40:35] know this is exactly the name I told him
[1:40:37] already and they've probably named her
[1:40:39] also now so and the best part is jamaa
[1:40:45] means
[1:40:47] Dove okay jamama means Dove now what
[1:40:50] Happ you know when these things started
[1:40:52] happening happening I absolutely
[1:40:55] understood that there is something major
[1:40:57] which is going to happen and something
[1:40:58] is fixing and something is waiting to
[1:41:00] happen you know when we reach there when
[1:41:02] we see that you know and today when I'm
[1:41:05] standing in front of you I am saying all
[1:41:08] these things and you would probably be
[1:41:10] thinking why brother John how does it
[1:41:12] matter you know how does it you know
[1:41:16] make any difference to us but like I
[1:41:19] said the message I'm going to preach or
[1:41:22] it's going to be deep okay many things
[1:41:25] you might not understand right away I
[1:41:27] also did not okay but eventually you
[1:41:31] will because it is important that you
[1:41:34] you know you you probably don't
[1:41:36] understand everything but it is
[1:41:38] important that you believe that this
[1:41:40] book okay is coming to life amen you
[1:41:45] know the scripture out of it is coming
[1:41:47] and is starting to
[1:41:49] manifest okay it is starting to manifest
[1:41:52] so when the scriptures manifests you
[1:41:54] will get to know I I want you to uh uh
[1:41:57] brother if you can show one message I
[1:42:00] will give you the name of the message
[1:42:03] also is right
[1:42:18] here
[1:42:21] adoption uh 196
[1:42:24] adoption part three it was preached on
[1:42:26] 22nd
[1:42:28] 5 okay and Par
[1:42:39] 85 I'll read it for you for example you
[1:42:42] know you can search it also adoption
[1:42:45] placing positionally yeah that's the one
[1:42:48] brother Daniel can you read this
[1:42:51] please yeah adoption
[1:42:53] placing positionally where they at show
[1:42:57] me where they at where they're at God
[1:43:00] calling his children aside by
[1:43:01] manifestation by
[1:43:03] manifestation okay so now we have to
[1:43:06] understand that in each of Our Lives
[1:43:09] this word will start
[1:43:11] manifesting okay now that is how you can
[1:43:14] make your calling an election
[1:43:16] sh because uh now we're not talking
[1:43:19] about a general manifestation like you
[1:43:21] know I prayed and he healed me and
[1:43:23] healing is a general thing you know by
[1:43:26] his stripes I'm Healed okay it's a
[1:43:28] generic thing it can apply you know to
[1:43:30] anybody and coming to that topic of
[1:43:32] healing okay I don't want to pass this
[1:43:34] but yeah I want to explain how healing
[1:43:36] Works in our body also because uh it is
[1:43:40] important that you know first pull
[1:43:42] second pull third pull okay we have
[1:43:45] these three pulls and third pull has got
[1:43:47] three folds in it the first fold
[1:43:51] is okay no problem
[1:43:54] yeah yeah I okay let's start with the
[1:43:57] first pull don't worry this
[1:44:00] is now I'm trying to explain to you how
[1:44:03] healing works okay because even though
[1:44:06] first pool doesn't assure anything else
[1:44:09] okay it is the earnest for our Salvation
[1:44:11] right okay so if you're going in the
[1:44:14] Rapture you you have to understand that
[1:44:16] you know like in the olden times when
[1:44:18] Peter was walking when his shadow fell
[1:44:21] on sick people they got healed
[1:44:23] he didn't have to pray for them and
[1:44:24] stuff okay so today when I say that you
[1:44:28] know you are very special people okay
[1:44:31] you're very special people who are
[1:44:33] sitting here called out you have got
[1:44:36] some special weapons and tactics which
[1:44:39] you know the other people perhaps do or
[1:44:41] don't I don't know but you know healing
[1:44:43] is something which is your bread it is
[1:44:46] meant for you it is children's bread
[1:44:50] okay the others are making use of it but
[1:44:53] that doesn't mean you should not have it
[1:44:55] you should have it
[1:44:56] first right so now what happens is when
[1:44:59] we talk about healing uh brother there
[1:45:01] is a uh there is a seven dimensions
[1:45:04] image that I've shared with you if you
[1:45:07] can just show me
[1:45:12] that I have given you the uh the par
[1:45:16] numbers you can go home and read it
[1:45:18] because you know we have very limited
[1:45:19] time and we to wrap everything up so you
[1:45:22] know I'm not reading the entire thing
[1:45:24] but you know you'll get an idea now
[1:45:27] these are the seven dimensions that
[1:45:29] brother bam spoke about okay the seven
[1:45:32] dimensions he said in the present stage
[1:45:34] of my Ministry if you go to uh I think
[1:45:36] all the dimensions are explained pretty
[1:45:38] much this uh it starts with light matter
[1:45:42] time these are the you know three
[1:45:44] dimensions that we are living in as
[1:45:46] Mortals okay we have we contact the
[1:45:49] light and matter and time and all this
[1:45:51] so we are in this Dimension and this is
[1:45:54] called a temporal Dimension you know
[1:45:56] it's not permanent and here you have the
[1:46:00] region of the Mortal beings this is
[1:46:01] where we are living right now okay and
[1:46:06] uh I probably should have used white
[1:46:08] here but can is it visible from there
[1:46:12] yeah this one is the region of the lost
[1:46:15] people who die
[1:46:17] unconverted okay who die unconverted go
[1:46:20] here is the fifth dimension okay and in
[1:46:24] The Fifth Dimension again there is the
[1:46:26] region of the
[1:46:28] Demons okay and this is where brother
[1:46:31] bam said every sickness and every
[1:46:33] illness is a demon okay we give it a
[1:46:36] name we call it cancer we call it
[1:46:38] epilepsy we call it XY Z you know cold
[1:46:41] flu influenza but it is actually a demon
[1:46:44] from
[1:46:45] here okay and then of course this is
[1:46:49] where their boss sits Satan the you know
[1:46:54] the underground yeah the underworld
[1:46:57] thing you know this is where he is okay
[1:46:59] so this is The Fifth Dimension earlier
[1:47:02] before Jesus Christ rose up The Fifth
[1:47:04] Dimension also had another partition
[1:47:06] which was called The Paradise okay the
[1:47:10] good people who died in faith because
[1:47:12] the blood of bulls and goats couldn't
[1:47:14] really redeem them it will only cover
[1:47:16] their sins okay so till the time
[1:47:18] original sacrifice did not come in there
[1:47:20] was a part here where the good Souls of
[1:47:23] the the saved people were and it was
[1:47:26] called paradise and uh when Jesus rose
[1:47:29] up he took them all up with him okay and
[1:47:33] then that place is lying open now so
[1:47:35] there is no more you know that is why
[1:47:37] says that you know uh The Witch of Endor
[1:47:40] was able to
[1:47:41] summon Samuel okay because he was still
[1:47:45] you know in the in this dimension in
[1:47:47] Paradise now if you see you know any
[1:47:50] believer you know or anybody you know
[1:47:52] they say saying that you know I saw my
[1:47:54] mom came and my dad passed away but then
[1:47:56] I saw him having tea and you know I he
[1:47:59] came and he met me and I shook hands you
[1:48:01] can know that you know people from this
[1:48:03] Dimension don't come back in this okay
[1:48:08] because they are resting there all right
[1:48:10] and now this is the uh sixth Dimension
[1:48:13] and the seventh Dimension seventh
[1:48:15] Dimension is where God is okay and this
[1:48:18] is where brother bham you know he this
[1:48:20] is where he went the region of the
[1:48:23] Blessed is the sixth Dimension this is
[1:48:25] where you know all the people who are
[1:48:27] saved who are believers and stuff you
[1:48:29] know who sleep in the Lord this is where
[1:48:31] they're resting this this this is the
[1:48:32] place here and yeah this is the place
[1:48:35] where you know the people whose names
[1:48:37] are in the Lamb's Book and the Book of
[1:48:40] Life okay this is where they go all
[1:48:44] right and people whose names are deleted
[1:48:46] from the book like Judas once it was
[1:48:48] there but it was deleted and the people
[1:48:50] whose names were never there they're all
[1:48:52] you know parting here yeah and uh so
[1:48:57] when you uh see sickness what happens is
[1:49:01] that we are in the Mortal realm we are
[1:49:03] here okay we are still alive so what
[1:49:06] happens a demon from here from this
[1:49:11] section okay comes around and you know
[1:49:16] gets attached to us not us but whoever
[1:49:18] is sick yeah get attached here and then
[1:49:23] this fella will start telling you you
[1:49:27] know what you have a slight headache I
[1:49:29] think okay
[1:49:31] and and you feel like oh yeah a little
[1:49:34] bit of headache yes yes slowly slowly
[1:49:36] yeah and then once you start believing
[1:49:39] it then it's like you know oh now I
[1:49:41] really have a headache now I think I
[1:49:43] should go to the doctor now I think you
[1:49:46] know so what happens is that uh the the
[1:49:51] demons from here come here influence you
[1:49:55] okay or whoever it is influence them and
[1:49:58] they start
[1:49:59] believing and once they start believing
[1:50:02] this sickness yeah
[1:50:04] manifests okay that is why if you've
[1:50:06] read in the message even before sister
[1:50:08] maida had tumor brother Venom once you
[1:50:11] know held her hand and you know he could
[1:50:13] see before any symptoms came in the
[1:50:16] demon was already there okay it was
[1:50:19] already there now what happens is this
[1:50:22] demon
[1:50:23] now slowly slowly he you know it doesn't
[1:50:24] happen like okay it doesn't happen all
[1:50:26] of a
[1:50:27] sudden it takes time it makes you it
[1:50:31] takes you into confidence okay it makes
[1:50:34] you believe that you know what you are
[1:50:37] sick yeah I think you should go to bed
[1:50:40] you know I think you should take rest
[1:50:43] yeah now what happens is that is why
[1:50:45] brother bam said in the meeting and the
[1:50:47] message he said that you know when the
[1:50:49] demon comes to you with a package okay
[1:50:52] okay just say
[1:50:55] sorry I don't want
[1:50:57] it yeah I don't want it yeah now this
[1:51:00] fellow will keep trying he will try as
[1:51:02] hard as he can okay he will try as hard
[1:51:04] as he can to get it so the first thing
[1:51:06] that you should do is
[1:51:09] deny by his stripes I am healed am okay
[1:51:13] I'm not sick in the first place headache
[1:51:16] I don't have headache okay because all
[1:51:19] these things are lying vanities even
[1:51:22] when in the whale's belly okay Jonah
[1:51:27] said this is
[1:51:28] lie okay he's sitting right there and
[1:51:31] there is all vomit all around him and
[1:51:33] the veil is moving at such a huge speed
[1:51:35] I don't know what is the speed but you
[1:51:37] know he has to cross the continent and
[1:51:39] go to the other side so Jonah have you
[1:51:42] heard of Jonah everybody yeah Jonah okay
[1:51:46] he was going to in he said I don't want
[1:51:48] to go so God said okay fine no I will
[1:51:51] take you there so you know so Jonah in
[1:51:55] the whales belly all dark all around and
[1:51:59] but he knew one thing he knew that when
[1:52:02] Solomon dedicated the temple he said
[1:52:05] whenever anybody falls off backslides
[1:52:08] comes back and you know looks towards
[1:52:11] this Temple and prays god here from
[1:52:14] Heaven amen and God did
[1:52:17] answer right so these things even if you
[1:52:20] do feel that they there is some kind of
[1:52:23] you know you have to tell the devil tell
[1:52:26] the demon sorry boss nothing
[1:52:29] doing no admission I don't want it I
[1:52:34] don't I don't have to okay you are a
[1:52:37] liar yeah you are a liar yeah the devil
[1:52:41] is a
[1:52:42] liar yeah so you say that and then uh
[1:52:46] this fellow has no other option but to
[1:52:49] leave okay that is the first step now
[1:52:51] next you would come across people who
[1:52:54] are sick okay so people who are sick or
[1:52:57] who have got some kind of uh problem and
[1:52:59] you know things like
[1:53:01] that you will know
[1:53:03] that sickness is a demon right right and
[1:53:08] you have power over
[1:53:12] demons why because you like I said are w
[1:53:16] a t you've got something extra that they
[1:53:20] don't have what do you have
[1:53:23] extra you have
[1:53:26] this yeah and you have this right the
[1:53:31] demons can use this to some extent you
[1:53:33] know because the Bible says that you
[1:53:35] know even the even the demons
[1:53:38] believe okay they believe what this that
[1:53:41] one day they're going to you know end up
[1:53:43] in the Lake of Fire they do believe okay
[1:53:45] so we have something extra all right now
[1:53:48] this extra what happens is so you see
[1:53:51] now
[1:53:53] uh this demon has got this body in
[1:53:57] complete control and then you know demon
[1:53:59] is basically you know you can read this
[1:54:01] in the message of demonology Physical
[1:54:03] Realm now this demon has attached to
[1:54:06] this body and it is drawing life from
[1:54:08] this body and in itself it is growing
[1:54:11] okay it grows in this body and this you
[1:54:13] know it makes this body weak and it
[1:54:15] takes life from this body okay now what
[1:54:19] happens is when it is taking life from
[1:54:20] this body
[1:54:23] you have got the power of the spoken
[1:54:26] word all right you have to understand
[1:54:30] that the battle is not here you know
[1:54:35] battle is not in flesh actually the
[1:54:37] battle is at a spiritual level in this
[1:54:41] region yes you have to fight the demons
[1:54:45] influences okay so what happens is it is
[1:54:49] real okay sickness is real and demons
[1:54:52] are real they do cause you know said
[1:54:55] that uh demons they what they do is they
[1:54:59] uh I forgot the word for it but
[1:55:01] nevertheless yeah they there to causes
[1:55:04] problems you know pain and you know I
[1:55:06] forgot the right word but yeah so
[1:55:07] they're coming from here so what you do
[1:55:10] is when you pray okay and even if you
[1:55:13] don't pray if you have the word okay you
[1:55:17] have to know that you are standing on
[1:55:19] the right ground you will have the conf
[1:55:22] confidence how will you have the
[1:55:24] confidence I have got 20 minutes I will
[1:55:29] absolutely touch on that also how will
[1:55:30] you have the confidence okay so once you
[1:55:32] have the
[1:55:34] confidence you can just tell the
[1:55:37] demon be
[1:55:40] gone and the demon will have to
[1:55:44] flee he'll have to run from there you
[1:55:48] know and you so filled with the Holy
[1:55:50] Ghost that you know at at certain point
[1:55:53] in time demon standing there will start
[1:55:55] screaming it starts screaming right okay
[1:56:00] and I I am actually explaining to you
[1:56:02] the first P but you know you have to
[1:56:04] understand this is real you have the
[1:56:06] power right okay you are not subject to
[1:56:10] anything that you see in this realm
[1:56:13] because this is just you know in is
[1:56:16] things that you can see is
[1:56:18] all not Eternal it's just temporal right
[1:56:21] okay so So when you say and what happens
[1:56:25] is further explain this okay when you
[1:56:28] say when you tell this demon go go back
[1:56:30] to hell where you came from and be bound
[1:56:33] there till the day of judgment okay and
[1:56:36] this demon has to obey when the demon
[1:56:39] obeys that extra life that was you know
[1:56:42] the demon that is there and was sucking
[1:56:44] life out of your body will leave this
[1:56:47] okay it has to leave it cannot stand
[1:56:49] there it has got no grounding okay so
[1:56:52] when this body leaves there oh this
[1:56:54] demon leaves this
[1:56:56] body this problem is still there okay
[1:56:59] the sickness that you know because like
[1:57:01] for example a cancer it's like you know
[1:57:03] uh some kind of you know all these weird
[1:57:05] shaped demons okay so the life goes out
[1:57:09] of it but the extra body is still
[1:57:12] hanging there it's still there okay so
[1:57:14] now what happens is slowly this body
[1:57:15] will die and it will Decay inside of you
[1:57:18] okay like for example cancer is a growth
[1:57:21] in the body so what happens in the body
[1:57:24] when this growth happens it is taking
[1:57:25] life out of you but this life when it
[1:57:28] dies this lump is still there okay now
[1:57:31] what happens this lump slowly
[1:57:33] disintegrates remember said that you
[1:57:35] know when a dog dies on the street if
[1:57:37] you see after 3 days you know it's it
[1:57:40] swells up okay so you get your healing
[1:57:43] because the demon has left but then the
[1:57:46] stuff that is left in there this will
[1:57:47] swell up you will start having fever or
[1:57:50] whatever okay and this is the time when
[1:57:52] you have to keep your faith that you
[1:57:54] were healed okay and then what happens
[1:57:57] this thing you know drains out of your
[1:57:59] body through your uh blood cells or you
[1:58:01] know however your body cleans it you
[1:58:03] know it goes out okay and you're
[1:58:04] completely healed all right this is the
[1:58:08] process of healing the first P this is
[1:58:09] how it happens this this is how it works
[1:58:12] okay now uh I also want to tell you one
[1:58:14] thing uh I had asked one of uh yeah to
[1:58:18] get a balloon do you have it now can I
[1:58:21] have it please yeah I I'll show you
[1:58:23] something here and a sketch pen very
[1:58:26] good
[1:58:27] yeah you know the balloon is just for
[1:58:30] shape okay now uh brother I have another
[1:58:34] image there which is the triangles okay
[1:58:38] yeah this
[1:58:39] one now anybody who knows basic
[1:58:42] mathematics you know you don't need to
[1:58:43] know all this this is just you but you
[1:58:45] still need to understand the concept
[1:58:47] that goes behind this
[1:58:49] okay the angle some property of a
[1:58:52] triangle states that angles of the
[1:58:54] triangle always add up to 180° the
[1:58:57] internal angles okay like this this
[1:59:00] angle plus this angle plus this angle is
[1:59:03] always going to be 180 doesn't matter
[1:59:05] which direction it is how wide or how
[1:59:07] whatever it is if this is bigger this
[1:59:08] will become small you
[1:59:10] see yeah any shape of triangle you take
[1:59:14] so people who are into construction and
[1:59:16] you know not just construction even
[1:59:18] small kids you know have you has anybody
[1:59:20] learned this in school you know about
[1:59:22] this yeah yeah so you know it's basic
[1:59:26] basic okay on top of this there is
[1:59:28] further a lot of these things but you
[1:59:30] have to understand that these rules and
[1:59:33] these laws only apply on a certain
[1:59:37] plane right now example what happens
[1:59:40] like you know for example this is this
[1:59:43] is a right angle triangle okay these are
[1:59:45] two perpendicular lines crossing each
[1:59:47] other so this is 90° okay if this is 90°
[1:59:52] these have to be less than 90 it could
[1:59:54] be 45 and 45 that makes it you know 180
[1:59:57] so now what happens is but this formula
[2:00:01] will not apply on a round
[2:00:04] shape yeah I show you that you know I
[2:00:07] draw one perpendicular line here uh it's
[2:00:10] not you know very bright but yeah I draw
[2:00:12] one perpendicular here one perpendicular
[2:00:15] here so essentially this is supposed to
[2:00:17] be 90° okay I draw one more here
[2:00:21] perpendicular to to it okay this is 90
[2:00:24] so how much is 90 + 90 180 now what
[2:00:28] happens is when this goes in here top
[2:00:31] and this goes up
[2:00:34] top it meets here okay because the
[2:00:38] surface is Round right so 90 + 90 180
[2:00:43] and whatever this is this formula fails
[2:00:46] it goes above
[2:00:48] 180° you understand so that is why you
[2:00:52] have to understand that is this clear it
[2:00:55] doesn't matter that you know you don't
[2:00:56] need to know trigonometry and stuff it's
[2:00:57] just that you know you have to go that
[2:00:59] this formula only applies here it does
[2:01:02] not apply on this plane know on a circle
[2:01:05] or you know on this Dimension so what I
[2:01:09] want to show you is that brother can we
[2:01:11] come back to the seven
[2:01:13] dimensions the the the the the laws of
[2:01:17] physics which apply here don't apply
[2:01:20] here
[2:01:22] you understand that the laws that you've
[2:01:24] been taught here that you know you had
[2:01:26] to
[2:01:27] work your way and you have to slog and
[2:01:30] you to do this you do that you know and
[2:01:32] if you fall sick go to the doctor and
[2:01:35] you know you have to take your medicine
[2:01:36] you to do this you to do that all that
[2:01:38] is good till that time you know the law
[2:01:41] was given till that time the you know
[2:01:44] the original did not come as a school
[2:01:45] teacher okay so all these things are
[2:01:48] there that we learn here in school you
[2:01:51] know that's why it's called the science
[2:01:53] thing okay science civilization yeah
[2:01:56] okay whatever we learn here from our
[2:01:59] peers from you know like you know
[2:02:01] gravity pulls you back right and you
[2:02:04] know all these things you have to
[2:02:06] understand that this is all temporal
[2:02:08] this this these rules don't apply
[2:02:11] here okay because uh with the spoken
[2:02:16] word you can
[2:02:18] heal right with the spoken word you can
[2:02:21] create yes now let me tell you if you
[2:02:24] need a
[2:02:25] refrigerator you have to know that you
[2:02:28] have the power of spoken
[2:02:30] word I'm telling you this is practical
[2:02:33] okay this is practical you just have to
[2:02:36] go there wherever you want in the corner
[2:02:39] you have to say let there be
[2:02:42] a
[2:02:44] refrigerator and guess what the
[2:02:48] refrigerator will be there amen it will
[2:02:51] be there
[2:02:53] no you don't sound
[2:02:56] convinced he said that he said that easy
[2:03:01] come on come on brother John now this is
[2:03:04] a little you know no but I'm telling you
[2:03:07] the fact that you know what you have the
[2:03:08] power of creation inside of you you can
[2:03:11] create you know you can create you can
[2:03:14] speak worlds into existence you have
[2:03:17] that power in you you know the devil
[2:03:19] wants to let you know that you know it
[2:03:21] is not possible but it is
[2:03:23] possible that is why that is why when we
[2:03:28] had the prophet standing there and he
[2:03:30] said let there be a
[2:03:32] squirrel on that branch and guess what
[2:03:37] there was a squirrel amen amen right so
[2:03:41] I am not saying something which uh you
[2:03:43] know is coming out of nowhere I am
[2:03:46] seeing is that whatever was done there
[2:03:49] is possible today amen and also if you
[2:03:53] would notice I am not preaching Jesus
[2:03:56] Christ 2,000 years back I'm not even
[2:03:59] preaching Jesus Christ in
[2:04:01] 1963 right I am preaching Jesus Christ
[2:04:07] 2024 yeah right and he is still the same
[2:04:12] yesterday today and forever okay you
[2:04:16] have to you know we just have to grow
[2:04:18] into that gown of Elijah amen Lord is
[2:04:22] the same right you know God is still the
[2:04:24] same he does not change he will never
[2:04:28] change okay we have to come out of this
[2:04:32] Dimension and get into a faith Dimension
[2:04:35] where we start doing things by Faith
[2:04:39] said that faith has got muscles right
[2:04:42] you know how do you grow your muscles
[2:04:43] you you know the small baby doesn't have
[2:04:45] muscles like this you grow your muscles
[2:04:48] by exercising your faith you increase
[2:04:51] your Faith by exercising your faith more
[2:04:55] and more and more and more and one day
[2:04:58] when you're doing that you know what
[2:05:00] will
[2:05:01] happen you're so full of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:05] that you will leave this body behind
[2:05:08] because it cannot contain any more Holy
[2:05:10] Ghost you understand that amen yeah I
[2:05:14] mean this is the time and you you know
[2:05:18] this this word is only and only and only
[2:05:21] for you
[2:05:22] it is not for the world you know they
[2:05:25] might be celebrating Christmas and you
[2:05:27] know New Year and all that and all that
[2:05:29] being very righteous you
[2:05:32] know but you have got the word
[2:05:35] hallelujah right and this is a family
[2:05:38] affair this is a family this is not
[2:05:41] meant for other people even if they want
[2:05:43] to they can't accept it because they're
[2:05:45] not made of the same stuff it is the DNA
[2:05:48] inside of you which calls out amen you
[2:05:52] know and it responds to the DNA which is
[2:05:54] in the message
[2:05:56] here and you will know that oh my God
[2:06:01] this can be done yes this can be done
[2:06:03] this is you know I I'm not talking about
[2:06:05] fables this is already been done and
[2:06:08] it's already 60 70 years
[2:06:10] past yeah and we are here right now and
[2:06:14] you know this is our bread and if you
[2:06:17] have to let me also tell you if you want
[2:06:19] to change if you think that you're going
[2:06:21] in the right Rapture it is important
[2:06:23] that you understand where you're
[2:06:25] standing now let me come to the point
[2:06:27] that you know yeah the important point
[2:06:28] that I was looking at that you know how
[2:06:30] do you make sure that you know you're
[2:06:32] saved how do you absolutely how you
[2:06:34] absolutely make sure that you know the
[2:06:36] first problem is that you know the devil
[2:06:38] does is that people who have the Holy
[2:06:39] Ghost he will make them feel like you
[2:06:41] don't have it and the ones who don't
[2:06:44] have it will feel like they the only
[2:06:46] ones who have it yeah so now you have to
[2:06:50] uh you know how do we make sure what is
[2:06:51] the you know full and final you know
[2:06:54] this thing that you know okay I am saved
[2:06:56] now the next step okay now when somebody
[2:07:00] asked John the Baptist who are you are
[2:07:03] you Elijah you know who are you are you
[2:07:06] somebody else then John the Baptist
[2:07:08] replied and he said that I am the voice
[2:07:11] of the one shouting in the
[2:07:13] wilderness okay what did he do he
[2:07:16] identified himself in the
[2:07:19] scripture amen right right he identified
[2:07:22] himself in the scripture now he knows
[2:07:26] where he is coming from right right so
[2:07:30] if you read John chapter
[2:07:32] 14 now I'm going to be really quick
[2:07:35] because we have very less
[2:07:39] time John chapter
[2:07:42] 14
[2:07:49] okay here we go
[2:07:56] go 26 verse
[2:08:05] 26 yeah God bless you my brother but the
[2:08:08] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[2:08:11] the father will send in my name he shall
[2:08:13] teach you all things and bring all
[2:08:15] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[2:08:17] have said unto you okay so whatsoever I
[2:08:20] have said unto you the the Holy Ghost
[2:08:21] will bring you into reme it'll bring
[2:08:24] remembrance it'll remind you that you
[2:08:25] know what what is happening with you has
[2:08:28] already happened there it'll
[2:08:30] positionally place you in the scripture
[2:08:32] when the word Holy Ghost places you in
[2:08:35] the scripture then you know where you're
[2:08:37] standing then you're not guessing then
[2:08:40] you're not thinking oh maybe I am saved
[2:08:42] but then I did that thing wrong
[2:08:43] yesterday am am I saved am I really
[2:08:45] saved am I not saved no if you find
[2:08:49] yourself in the scripture this is what
[2:08:51] the the Holy Ghost is given for Amen to
[2:08:53] positionally place you in the word yes
[2:08:56] okay now uh let us take one live example
[2:08:59] what happened in Acts chapter 2 okay
[2:09:04] quickly Acts chapter 2 verse 30 I think
[2:09:08] 32 yeah yeah here we go uh 38 I'm going
[2:09:13] to skip all that and let's come to the
[2:09:15] main point here Peter said unto them uh
[2:09:18] brother please read and then Peter said
[2:09:20] unto them repent and be baptized every
[2:09:23] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:09:25] for the remission of sins and you shall
[2:09:27] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen
[2:09:30] yeah now this is the baptism part okay
[2:09:32] now let me surprise it what happened was
[2:09:35] these people were standing there and
[2:09:37] they saw these uh Apostles they were
[2:09:39] speaking in foreign tongue okay foreign
[2:09:42] tongue in the sense somebody had come
[2:09:43] from a different country and from there
[2:09:46] you see this Galilean speaking French
[2:09:49] you know you know French was not one of
[2:09:51] the countries but yeah just to make it
[2:09:53] in a more context I'm telling they they
[2:09:55] how are they speaking French they are
[2:09:57] uneducated people how how did they learn
[2:09:59] all this language then somebody said no
[2:10:02] they're drunk they're drunk and then
[2:10:05] Peter got up and he said my dear friends
[2:10:09] they are not drunk like you
[2:10:11] think this is what has been prophesied
[2:10:14] by Prophet Joel amen so what that whole
[2:10:19] instance Peter took and placed in the
[2:10:22] scripture amen okay so that means that
[2:10:27] whenever you get the Holy Ghost the main
[2:10:29] you know purpose for the Holy Ghost
[2:10:31] right now is to positionally show you
[2:10:33] where you're standing in the scripture
[2:10:37] so that is why I again and again say
[2:10:39] that this book is not just a book right
[2:10:44] it might be for rest of the world but
[2:10:46] for you this is life amen this is your
[2:10:50] life
[2:10:52] you know uh when we see that seven
[2:10:54] dimensions chart you
[2:10:57] see your name here it says okay your
[2:11:02] name is in this book now if I explain it
[2:11:05] further like you know Lamb's Book of
[2:11:07] Life and Book of Life the names which
[2:11:09] are in here okay these are the ones who
[2:11:12] will recognize themselves in the word
[2:11:14] amen these ones don't have any portion
[2:11:16] there because their names are deleted
[2:11:17] and they're not there anymore right or
[2:11:19] maybe it was never written okay so these
[2:11:21] people here are the ones who find their
[2:11:24] names and in the Book of Revelations if
[2:11:25] you see it says that you know I will
[2:11:27] give you a new name so probably the name
[2:11:29] that you born with Joel or brother Barry
[2:11:32] or you know brother tabish so this is
[2:11:34] not the name that God recognizes he will
[2:11:36] give you a new name and the new name
[2:11:39] will be a name which is very special to
[2:11:42] you to you okay there's no impersonation
[2:11:45] of that there is no impersonation of the
[2:11:47] third pool first pool yeah they can copy
[2:11:50] okay demon and no demon they can say do
[2:11:52] all that but the third pole there is no
[2:11:54] impersonation your instance is your own
[2:11:57] okay the White Rock on which the name is
[2:12:00] written is yours and it is personal to
[2:12:02] you okay so you will know that you know
[2:12:05] positionally this is where my role is
[2:12:07] you know I I I I will give you a small
[2:12:09] example in very this thing short uh once
[2:12:13] what happened uh we were there staying
[2:12:15] in Delhi and there was a church meeting
[2:12:17] that we had to attend me and my mom we
[2:12:19] were staying on the first floor uh was
[2:12:21] our house and then uh I was going going
[2:12:24] down the stairs and I see that the
[2:12:26] person who's uh you know that there's a
[2:12:28] person who is living on the ground floor
[2:12:29] also so I see that you know the
[2:12:30] electricity cable which goes down to our
[2:12:32] meter was kind was spliced so I realized
[2:12:36] that somebody's stealing electricity
[2:12:38] from here now uh on the ground floor I
[2:12:40] asked him who's this what is what is
[2:12:42] going on he's said I don't know what is
[2:12:43] going on so you know I didn't have time
[2:12:46] and uh usually our electricity bills are
[2:12:49] like you know 2,000 3,000 rupees like
[2:12:52] that you know on a month but my
[2:12:54] electricity bill was coming to about
[2:12:56] 25,000 okay and that was too high
[2:13:00] then and and and then you know I was
[2:13:03] like you know of course we are not using
[2:13:05] this kind of you know usage all of a
[2:13:07] sudden I I went to the electric company
[2:13:10] and I complained to them they said you
[2:13:12] know boss what this till the you know we
[2:13:14] have got electricity poles okay so till
[2:13:17] your meter like you know your
[2:13:19] electricity meter if any anybody steals
[2:13:21] electricity before your meter that is
[2:13:23] our responsibility if somebody's
[2:13:25] stealing after your meter you know it's
[2:13:27] coming between your meter and your home
[2:13:29] it's your problem they're not stealing
[2:13:32] from us they're stealing from you so you
[2:13:34] deal with it and I was like how will I
[2:13:36] deal with it okay so I was like I went
[2:13:39] to the meeting now there our pastor was
[2:13:42] preaching that day and he was telling
[2:13:43] about job okay and the whole message was
[2:13:46] about job and I was 25,000 now what to
[2:13:49] do okay so you know I was just thinking
[2:13:52] about it thinking about it thinking
[2:13:53] about it and then you know in the
[2:13:55] afternoon the message got over we had
[2:13:57] food and I was just lying down and
[2:13:59] something just struck
[2:14:02] me
[2:14:03] that one
[2:14:06] minute it's already 12:00 okay yeah but
[2:14:09] then I will be very brief okay now it
[2:14:11] just struck me that job was being tested
[2:14:16] and some people came and you know stole
[2:14:19] his cattle and his sheep deep and stuff
[2:14:22] and eventually God rewarded him okay
[2:14:25] then I realized that you know I don't
[2:14:26] need to be worried because this probably
[2:14:28] is a test and another thing that you
[2:14:30] have to know have to understand is
[2:14:34] that the devil like I said the these
[2:14:38] folks here have no power over you
[2:14:42] whatsoever not even in their wildest
[2:14:44] dreams they can say or do anything okay
[2:14:48] so you have to understand that until
[2:14:50] unless there are only two chances that
[2:14:52] you know they
[2:14:54] can attack you or you know get on you
[2:14:58] there are only two ways of doing it one
[2:15:00] when God allows them that is for testing
[2:15:03] you like you know what happens when you
[2:15:06] know uh some problem comes in what will
[2:15:08] you know brother what will you do okay
[2:15:11] and then God already knows he has
[2:15:12] confidence he says go ahead try okay
[2:15:15] don't touch his life but rest you know
[2:15:17] you do and then God knows already that
[2:15:19] you know this is what is going to happen
[2:15:20] so when he has so much of confidence on
[2:15:22] you he will say okay go ahead now test
[2:15:25] all right that is one second is when you
[2:15:30] go out of the word okay this is where
[2:15:33] our young children have to young and old
[2:15:36] everybody for the matter have to be you
[2:15:38] know conscious that you know when you
[2:15:40] step outside the
[2:15:42] word okay Bible says that you know this
[2:15:45] is what you have to do this is what you
[2:15:46] should not do this is what okay when you
[2:15:48] step out and this is where the doctrine
[2:15:51] of balam comes into play okay balam knew
[2:15:55] that you know these people cannot do
[2:15:58] anything to Israel there is nobody on
[2:16:00] the face of this Earth who can do
[2:16:02] anything to Israel when I say Israel I
[2:16:05] mean you am okay there is nothing in the
[2:16:08] face of this Earth that can harm you
[2:16:09] hurt you or not just you the protection
[2:16:12] extends to your family and your goods
[2:16:15] also okay it extends to that also so you
[2:16:19] can be absolutely you know sure that
[2:16:21] nothing can touch you okay
[2:16:24] unless
[2:16:26] somehow I make them commit something
[2:16:29] against the
[2:16:30] word because when the god of Israel is
[2:16:34] protecting somebody nobody can do any
[2:16:37] harm to them but
[2:16:41] if they the ones who are in the
[2:16:45] protection do something against the word
[2:16:49] then their God will beat them
[2:16:51] you know your protector will start
[2:16:54] becoming your
[2:16:56] Punisher okay so that is why I don't
[2:16:59] have the time but you can go home and
[2:17:01] read a lot of scriptures in Second Kings
[2:17:05] okay there is this king who came up and
[2:17:07] he did what was wrong in the sight of
[2:17:09] the Lord and the go Lord sent him into
[2:17:11] whatever and you know gave him a
[2:17:13] punishment and the other king came and
[2:17:15] you know took his kingdom did this did
[2:17:18] that did this did that okay so you have
[2:17:21] to understand you are nothing
[2:17:25] less okay like for example let me say
[2:17:28] you know you see a monkey yeah when a
[2:17:31] monkey has a
[2:17:32] baby what is it
[2:17:35] called baby
[2:17:39] monkey yeah yeah right so so you know
[2:17:43] when when a horse has a baby okay it's a
[2:17:47] horse now let me ask you one thing
[2:17:51] when God has a
[2:17:53] baby what is that baby going to
[2:17:56] be he going
[2:17:58] God yeah so you are nothing less you
[2:18:02] know what I will tell you you see the
[2:18:04] water in the ocean so many you know
[2:18:07] minerals and whatever is there salt and
[2:18:09] everything is there you take one spoon
[2:18:11] out of it this spoon will contain
[2:18:14] everything that the ocean contains only
[2:18:17] in a smaller quantity you understand
[2:18:19] that that is very you are yeah okay
[2:18:23] whatever was there in God he poured into
[2:18:26] Christ whatever was there in Christ he
[2:18:30] poured into the bride you know now you
[2:18:33] have to understand these are the third
[2:18:35] fold you know three folds of have you
[2:18:37] heard the message Christ is the mystery
[2:18:39] of God revealed yeah so these are
[2:18:42] threefold so now you have to understand
[2:18:44] whatever is there in Christ okay you
[2:18:48] have a portion of all that amen he's a
[2:18:51] Healer you have it he's a redeemer you
[2:18:54] have it you know what you Angels can't
[2:18:57] do it Angels cannot preach salvation
[2:19:01] amen it has to be a bride of Christ who
[2:19:05] can preach salvation
[2:19:08] nobody these folks might be here but
[2:19:11] they are still you know they still not
[2:19:13] above us the Angels below us yeah
[2:19:18] they're below so that is why you will
[2:19:20] understand there's so many other things
[2:19:22] but you know I'm already over by 5
[2:19:25] minutes but you know you to understand
[2:19:28] that when this happens you have to be
[2:19:31] absolutely sure where you're standing
[2:19:33] once you're sure where you're standing
[2:19:36] you will never fail you have the power
[2:19:40] of spoken word creation is in your mouth
[2:19:44] yeah you have that word okay and you are
[2:19:47] not righteous because of anything that
[2:19:49] you have done you have the blood of
[2:19:51] Christ which is your
[2:19:53] righteousness and also I will summarize
[2:19:56] and I will end by saying that you know
[2:19:59] today this is what you know my previous
[2:20:01] Pastor taught us and I want to really
[2:20:03] you know tell you this that the blood of
[2:20:06] Christ today where will you find
[2:20:09] it where will you find the blood of
[2:20:13] Christ yeah I will tell you where you
[2:20:15] will find it see when Jesus died on the
[2:20:18] cross he bled okay okay his blood fell
[2:20:21] on the stones and everything in Calvary
[2:20:24] Calgary Calvary there right yeah and
[2:20:27] then uh 2,000 years back and then rains
[2:20:30] came it swept it away okay and it went
[2:20:33] mixed in the earth and stuff but then
[2:20:35] what happens is that before it became
[2:20:40] flesh okay where was the blood it was
[2:20:45] word okay and you see John 1:14 if you
[2:20:49] read you know in the beginning was the
[2:20:51] word word was with God and Word was God
[2:20:52] and then word became flesh and we beheld
[2:20:54] his glory okay so he was the word and
[2:20:59] today Peter John James they did not have
[2:21:02] the full word okay they did not have it
[2:21:05] but today you have the full word right
[2:21:08] amen this book was locked it was sealed
[2:21:11] but this is the key that Adam lost okay
[2:21:16] now when you have this key when you look
[2:21:18] at it through here all your problems are
[2:21:21] solved you are back to where Adam fell
[2:21:24] from only thing is the currency here is
[2:21:29] Faith it is not dollars it is not rupees
[2:21:32] it is not anything else the currency
[2:21:34] that you have to use is Faith amen okay

[2:26:21] are amen boy I got some notes
[2:26:24] here you know I just have to say this I
[2:26:27] have to read a scripture and I've got a
[2:26:28] little commentary I think it's wonderful
[2:26:30] just to remember out of second
[2:26:34] Peter out of second Peter chapter
[2:26:38] 1 he says Grace and peace be multiplied
[2:26:41] unto you through the knowledge of God
[2:26:44] and Jesus our lord and I think it's so
[2:26:47] wonderful the way brother John brought
[2:26:49] it today the way the Lord brought it
[2:26:50] through brother John rather that we're
[2:26:52] not talking about a historical knowledge
[2:26:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ many times it's
[2:26:58] put off that way that we're talking
[2:27:00] about a historical
[2:27:02] informational discussion but we're
[2:27:05] talking about the life of Jesus Christ
[2:27:06] right now The Great I Am present tense
[2:27:10] according as his divine power hath given
[2:27:13] us sorry according as his divine power
[2:27:16] hath given unto us all things that
[2:27:19] pertain unto life and godliness through
[2:27:22] the knowledge of him again present tense
[2:27:25] knowledge not not some knowledge from
[2:27:28] our parents or through a pastor but our
[2:27:29] own experience that hath called us to
[2:27:33] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[2:27:36] us exceeding great and precious promises
[2:27:38] that by these ye might ye might be
[2:27:42] partakers of the divine nature get the
[2:27:45] Holy Ghost having escaped the corruption
[2:27:47] that is in the world through lust and
[2:27:50] beside this giving all diligence add to
[2:27:52] your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge to
[2:27:54] knowledge Temperance to Temperance
[2:27:55] patience to patience godliness to
[2:27:57] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[2:27:59] brotherly kindness charity this is the
[2:28:02] verse I wanted to get to for if these
[2:28:04] things be in you and abound the Holy
[2:28:07] Ghost brothers and sisters you don't
[2:28:08] have to try and find all of the portions
[2:28:10] of those just get the Holy Ghost in your
[2:28:12] life and you automatically have all of
[2:28:15] those virtues in your life if these
[2:28:17] things be in you and abound they may
[2:28:20] make you that ye shall neither be Barren
[2:28:22] or unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[2:28:24] Lord Jesus Christ I think it's so
[2:28:27] beautiful he can go on and say but he
[2:28:29] that lackthe things is blind the one
[2:28:31] that gets puffed up and says I know it
[2:28:33] all I know been in the message is longer
[2:28:35] than you've been alive brother what you
[2:28:36] can't tell me nothing when we start
[2:28:38] doing that we forget he that lath these
[2:28:41] things is blind and cannot see a far off
[2:28:44] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[2:28:47] from his old sins wherefore the rather
[2:28:49] brethren give diligence be careful give
[2:28:52] diligence to make your calling an
[2:28:54] election sure don't look at anybody else
[2:28:57] for if you do these things ye shall
[2:28:59] never
[2:29:01] fall I just think it's so beautiful I
[2:29:03] could really start preaching right now I
[2:29:05] mean wow it's beautiful the regions of
[2:29:08] the Mortal beings is where we exist in
[2:29:10] that in that in that chart that brother
[2:29:13] John put up there it's so beautiful you
[2:29:15] know and we talk about how demons have
[2:29:17] the ability to come around and attach
[2:29:20] themselves to our lives and and cause
