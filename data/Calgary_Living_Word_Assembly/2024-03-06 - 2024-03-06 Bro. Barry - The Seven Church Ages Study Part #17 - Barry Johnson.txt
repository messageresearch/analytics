pray amen amen thank you musicians God bless you tonight thank you for the special it's a tremendous thing to have a special it really sets an atmosphere if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to read from Revelations chapter 2 as we continue our study in the exposition of the seven Church ages the Ephesian Church age Revelations chapter 2 unto the angel verse one of Revelations chapter 2 unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how then thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and Hast found them liars and Hast borne and Hast patience and for my name's sake Hast lab labored and Hast not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nians which I also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we have come to Feast on that tree of life Lord Jesus we know the two trees have to grow together and they have to feed on the same life but Lord Jesus there's only one tree that attracts us here tonight and we pray that father we could just feed upon that tree we love you and we thank you Father now we just ask that you would do something for us tonight Lord something special that you would just give us peace and rest in our hearts Lord that we would know that we have truly heard from you tonight amen we just commit the rest of this service into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated we have a special visitor here we wanted to welcome sister Donna snow brother Donald Snow's mother God bless you Sister welcome trust you feel right at home and uh look forward to some fellowship with you Lord willing are you happy tonight carrying on in the uh Ephesian Church age and you know last week in the book um the exposition of the seven Church ages brother brandom he he started to uh explain the city of Ephesus and how it was the third city of Christian faith um just behind Antioch as the second church and Jerusalem as the first one and Paul Paul was the messenger to this church to this city he was the one that pastored here and that was for about three years and then we know Timothy took over but you know he goes on to talk about the very name Ephesus has a strange compound meaning is aimed at and relaxed and you know that's what happened into this church this church age it it started to get relaxed and uh that's certainly not what we want to do in the day in which we live but you know brother bam he says that uh this church it it relaxed and in that unguarded moment Satan planted the seat the seed of complete ruination and you know he comes in very very subtly Satan always comes in very very subtly and it's always as a thought and then it comes out as a discussion just a really simple discussion nothing too big really easy and calm but then what happens is this discussion it plants seeds and then the seeds they start to actually grow and manifest and that's the way Satan does it it's the way he did it from the very beginning but that's the way he even does it today you know brother bradam he goes on to talk about this in uh the next few paragraphs about how the the the people there the the false prophet is what he calls them they they introduced a a magnificent Temple of Diana and and how initially they introduced a shapeless female figure that sunk into the block of wood from which it was carved and her two arms were formed of two simple bars of iron brother randam he says how perfectly this depicts the spirit of antichrist loosed in the first age there he was loosed in the midst of the people and yet took no shape as to alarm the people people Satan is an expert Master at doing this he'll creep in people unawares he does it so good it it's just unbelievable the way he does it and and he goes on to say that yet the two arms are iron bars showed that it was the intent to crush the work of God as he made inroads and no one seemed to notice him or what he was doing but I love how he says this but one day they would notice and it's the same thing today brothers and sisters we have the ability to recognize that Antichrist spirit and and you might wonder why I'm talking this way because brother bradam said it that the Antichrist Spirit would creep its way into the framework not of the denominational Church into the framework of the Christian church and what does that do it causes it to become lukewarm formal and Powerless why would we want to waste our time time coming to church to be lukewarm to be formal and to be powerless he goes on to talk about the the the order of Temple service and and there was different things you know there was there was a people who claimed to know God they were Unix and they were apart from everything else but we know that they actually became sterile to the word then he talks about the virgins and how they had the religious acts in the temple and and and they would do the ritual and the works and then the third one was the political power and public influence and and you know this the devil is never far away from politics in the church he loves politics and as soon as the church gets into politics brothers and sisters look out it's not going to work it has to be the leadership of the Holy Ghost that's the only way a church can flourish that's the only way the true church will flourish I I want to say that clearly that's the only way way that the true church will flourish is no Politics as soon as politics comes in because it does you can look outside and see all kinds of churches with politics and maybe they have great signs and wonders too but have they got the word that's the critical Factor you know he he he talks about how they they went on and speaking specifically about the the the Catholic church and and how they went in and they got ill-gotten wealth and they just built the people out of all of their riches training them to intercede for for their loved ones who have gone on and died and and saying that you can pay to get them out of purgatory what a tremendous lie that is to think that you could give money and get people out of hell there's no money that's going to get people out of hell the only thing that will do that is the word of God but anyways it just is a a tremendous thing and just a little bit of a recap from last week now we want to get get into Jesus his messenger and churches this is Page 84 of the exposition of the seven Church ages Revelations 2 verse1 these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and remember this is the Lord God Almighty this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever walking in the midst of his seven golden candlesticks those are the seven Church ages those seven churches those candlesticks and remember he he said in Revelations chapter 2 if you don't repent and get back to your first love if you don't go back to where you got off then he will remove the Candlestick brother BR goes on to say this is he of whom it is said this same Jesus both Lord and Christ there he is the one and only Lord God Almighty and beside him there is no other there he is the savior salvation is of the Lord Jonah 2: 9 walking in the midst of the churches throughout the Seven Ages what he was in the first age he is in all ages isn't that beautiful to every believer he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what he did once he's still doing and will keep doing am now you will notice that Jesus is walking alone in the midst of his churches there was no one else with him neither indeed can there be for he alone wrought her salvation and having purchased her with his own blood he owns her he owns you brothers and sisters he owns us we are his inheritance and he's not going to let go any part of it he is her Lord and Master she gives him all the glory and All That Glory he will not share with another love the way he says this this just oh man there's no Pope with him there's no Archbishop with him Mary the mother of his Earthly body is not with him this is such an important part brothers and sisters that we need to remember and I know we do I'm preaching to the choir here it just it does does something to me though he does not speak and then turn to the father for he is the father he does not turn to give orders to a holy spirit for he is God eternal spirit right and it is his life that's flowing and pulsating the church giving her life and without him there would be no life salvation is of the Lord amen we can't pray and intercede for dead loved ones their time on Earth was their time on Earth and they had the opportunity to hear the gospel yes sir and hopefully if they couldn't receive it maybe they did something good for that elected one that tried to explain it to them but there's no paying to get people out of purgatory salvation is of the Lord Brother BR goes on to say there was no one with him when he trod the fierceness of the Wrath of the fiery furnace yes it was not another but him who hung upon the cross and gave his blood he is the author and finisher of our faith he is the Alpha and Omega of our Salvation the beginning and the ending of our salvation but everything in between brothers and sisters it's not just the beginning and the ending or the ending and the beginning it's every single part of it from the beginning to the end amen the Alpha and Omega of our Salvation we are espoused to him and not another we don't belong to the church we belong to him amen his word is law Creeds dogmas bylaws and constitutions have no effect on us yet it is Jesus alone who walks in the midst of the churches yes it is God in her willing and doing of his good pleasure never forget that isn't that beautiful never forget that you have only one relationship to God and God has only one relationship to you that is Jesus and Jesus alone now later on brother Brandon really gets into it but I just think it's so important to say it you know as we talk about this how important it is to remember what the Ephesian Church age did they let their guard down and Satan crept in yes sir and it was a simple discussion it was a simple thought it was a simple change maybe in the way they worship to bring the figure of Diana back into the temple and and and just the representation of her being there it caused something to happen but the devil made it look like it was just so subtle nothing is going to change it won't be a problem it was a huge problem paragraph 52 he says there he is with the Seven Stars in his right hand the right hand or arm signifies the power and authority of God for they got this is Psalms 443 for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arms save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou Hast a favor unto them and we know this is talking about the children of Israel coming out of bondage going into the promised land and how many battles did they fight on their own they they fought every single battle as they surrendered unto the Lord because he fought the battles for them and he told them to go forwards and be strong and be very courageous and don't fear because all the days of your life no man shall be able to stand before you as long as you are in the promised land as long as you're following the instructions of the word for your day but it was the Lord that did it it was his right hand of power paragraph 53 in that right hand of Power are seven stars who according to Revelations 1:20 are the seven Church Messengers this signifies that the very power and authority of God are behind his Messengers to every age they go forth in the fire and power of the Holy Ghost with the word they are stars because they reflect light the light they reflect is his light they have no light of their own they Kindle not their own fires that men may walk in the light of their Sparks Isaiah 5011 it is night for that is when the stars come out it is the night of Blackness of sin for all even the whole world have sinned and are constantly falling short of the glory of God Romans 3:23 you know when speaking of that how how it's the Blackness of sin for the whole world have sinned and constantly falling short of the glory of God I I remember when I first came in to the message of the hour when I first heard about it and started coming to church and hearing about a prophet and hearing the word and and and hearing that Hollywood is the biggest influencer in the entire world how I thought man that's kind of crazy but the more I started to look at it the more I thought wow isn't it true the whole world looks at the United States of America a and follows the United States of America they became the pace Setter the trend Setter for the world and I don't think there's anything good that comes out of Hollywood is there we know that uh it was said I Believe by the prophet that that's actually the seed of Satan that's where he chose to seat himself because he could influence as many people as would watch his programs through television and the picture shows and so on and so forth and now we know it's the Internet isn't it interesting that that's where the internet came from I could be wrong with that is that true though is that where the internet came from Silicone Valley it might have come from other places brother John you say yeah I just thought of that now I I've never thought of that that's interesting the whole internet and and what is the internet for most of it is is not good paragraph 54 these seven Messengers are making God known to the people he that receiveth them receiveth him that sent them John 13:20 they speak and act upon his authority he stands behind them with all the power of godhead Matthew 28:18-20 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth could you imagine what it would have been like to be talking to a man that would say that all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am I Am With You Always even unto the end end of the world consummation of the ages I just was thinking about this today while I was meditating on this and and listening and and just studying and and I just thought man to baptize in the name of the father what's the name of the father we all know this I know it's so interesting though in the name of the son if we were to go and greet someone in the name of the father it would mean nothing it would mean nothing or or the name of the son or or the name of the Holy ghost I mean what's the name yes sir it's so obvious even brother bradam he says it that it's so glaringly obvious you don't need a revelation it just says it very clearly it's not names those are all titles positions the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's where the power lies paragraph 55 so there they are full of the Holy Ghost and faith on fire with the fire of God speaking of The Messengers holding forth the word of Truth and there he stands to back them up and think of it not one believer of any age need cry in his heart oh that I might have been back there in the first age when the apostles were first sent out there is no need to look back look up Behold Him who is even now walking in the midst of the churches through all ages Behold Him who is the same yesterday today and for yesterday today and forever and who never changes either in essence or in his ways I love how brother Bram he says this that you know there they are full of the Holy Ghost in faith on fire with the fire of God holding forth a word of Truth and there he stands to back them up just makes me think of the story of the maniac in in Oregon was it Oregon Oregon where that Maniac came up on the stage where brother Brandon was pre preaching and he said I'm going to kill you and all what happened when he came in all of the ministers who were on the stage they all ran but brother randam he stood there and what happened was he had compassion on the man he had love for the man he wasn't afraid of the man because it wasn't him standing there he was standing there at the commission of almighty God just like he described there knowing that he was in the word and it was the truth of the hour that he was bringing and he knew it wasn't up to him to back it up it was God that was doing it and it's so sad because we know that afterwards Billy Paul asked him daddy was that man delivered and he said no he wasn't we know that he told him you're you're going to kill me you're not going to kill me you're going to fall across my feet tonight and the man spit in his face and pulled his arm back and what did he say he just fell over but it wasn't him that did it it wasn't brother bradam that did it it's so important to recognize it's the paragraph that we just just read that was almighty God walking in the midst of his church he says Behold Him who was the same yesterday today and forever and who never changes either in essence or in his ways where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in their midst there's more than two people gathered here tonight in his name brothers and sisters he's here tonight walking up and down the roads going from seat to seat heart to heart mind to mind it's the same God here tonight and not only in their midst as a complacent onlooker or as a recording Angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is the life and sustainer and Giver of all good gifts to the church Hallelujah my 56 who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks how meaningful are these words when viewed in the light of the scripture which Des describes him as Christ who is our life for Christ indeed is the life of the church remember he said it I am the vine and ye are the branches she has no other life without him she is simply a religious Society a club a meaningless Gathering of people now brothers and sisters I just want to dwell on this for a moment it's important brother brandham says as a corpse a dead body be jeweled and dressed it is still a corpse that's a dead person with with with maybe jewels and and a beautiful clothing garments hair done just right it's still a corpse it's still a dead person he says so the church no matter what her programs and her Rel her gracious efforts might achieve without Christ she is a corpse also yes sir that's why we continually preach on the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters because it's only by his spirit that we actually are not a corpse right he says but with him in her midst with him motivating her she becomes to the wonderment of all his body the f fullness of him that filth all in all now brothers and sisters I just this does something for me because you know if we're looking for a body change we were talking about this brother dawn and I if we're looking for the body change this is the body change the washing of the Water by the word this is the body change now brother Don's probably going to preach on this one day and I'm sorry brother but I just I can't help it this is the body change it culminates changing Dimensions but we're not going to become a different person over there the character that we have here is what we're going to take there that's why the prophet said that that's why we have to be Washed by the Water of the word we can't hope that one day oh Lord I'll lay this body down and suddenly I'll become a new creature in Christ Jesus no you become a new creature in Christ Jesus right now while there's still time yes so his Spirit can live out through you so he the spirit of truth will take us to the other side my but with him in their in her midst with him motivating her she becomes to the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filth all in all and this very hour he is walking in the midst of the last ages golden Candlestick I love the way he says it it's not just about the Ephesian Church age way back there somewhere he brings it right up to today what he was as he walked in the what he was as he walked in in the first age he is even now in this last age Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Exodus 25:31 and thou shalt make a Candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the Candlestick be made his shaft his branches his bowls his knops his flowers shall be the same paragraph 57 seven golden candlesticks the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold amen her righteousness is his righteousness isn't that beautiful there's anything good in a Believer it's not us it's only him yes sir it's only him amen her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect now I just I started thinking about this brothers and sisters this is so powerful because this is Ephesians chapter 5 if we want to see what the man is alls we have to do is look at the wife if you want to see what the church is brother bradam says if you want to know what's going on in the church take a look at the women in the church are they running wild are they dressing crazy or or are they living like Christians if we want to see what the nature of the husband is look at the wife because the wife reflects the husband the bride reflects Christ amen her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of the Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God this is almost too much to comprehend how can one fathom it how how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for God hath spoken it and you know this just made me think about Hebrews 11: 6 if you want to turn with me there for a second Hebrews 11 verse 6 how can one understand it in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal Eternal wisdom and purpose of God he's not talking about someone else brothers and sisters he's talking about us tonight he's talking about you he's talking about me everyone who's able to believe this word everyone who has the Holy Ghost in their lives summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can understand understand it how could we ever understand it we accept it by faith for God hath spoken it and what does Hebrews 11:6 say but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him yes so if we don't diligently seek Him how are we ever going to have the faith we want to be able to please him we want want to have that Faith this is the life of a Christian of a believer in this day we have to accept it by faith paragraph 58 but not only is the Candlestick of gold it is of beaten gold handcrafted of beaten gold according to her blueprints which were spirit-given and we read that verse in Exodus 25:31 Spirit given remember revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word but it Bears manifest it it shows it manifests outside of her Lord and Master Jesus Christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the Bride of Jesus Christ surely she is filling up the sufferings of Christ has left behind her goods are despoiled her life is in Jeopardy she is accounted as a sheep for the slaughter she is killed all the day long brothers and sisters if you think that maybe that's not you take a look at the amount of pressure that we have to deal with in our lives what is the amount of Oppression that we have we know that there's all kinds of devils roaming around trying to torment each and every one of us he goes on to say she suffers much but in it all retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer because we know how does the suffering come com through other people the devil's getting other people and they go and start poking and prodding and saying things they'll slice and dice with their mouths but what does the bride do she doesn't retaliate she doesn't try to make anybody feel bad she doesn't want to do that because the you know the word says this he says here in this paragraph worthy of the Gospel is this lovely bride of Christ and we know those who are are are faithful in Christ Jesus will suffer a lot of persecution and and sadly it doesn't come from without he goes on to say and as the gold is malleable whereas brass will bre break with the beating this gold of God will bear her suffering for the Lord not bowed not broken not destroyed but forming as a thing of beauty and a joy Forever by the trials and testings of this life you know sometimes we can get a little bit brassy in our walk we can get a little bit brassy in our disposition in our thinking in our ways and you know what if the Lord can't actually mold us and bend us what will happen is we'll break we'll break under that pressure we're all going to suffer persecution Christ Praises his own Revelations 2: 2 to3 I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou CST not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and Hast found them like liars and Hast borne and Hast patience and for my name's sake has labored and Hast not fainted now brother bradam really digs in here this is where it starts getting good how beautifully the Savior praises and commends his children he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior you know I uh I was saying to the boys I don't know if I said it on Sunday or not I I meant to if I didn't but if I said it just forgive me and and go along with me you know what our attitude will dictate our altitude you've probably all heard that we've all heard it before but our attitude in any situation will dictate what our altitude is going to be if we have a terrible attitude we're going to stay right down here on the ground but if we've got an attitude saying Lord just be it unto me according to Thy word you have it all under control his attitude in us will take us into another dimension amen how beautifully the Savior praises and commends his children he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he knows that there is weakness amongst them but as yet he does not cry out against it isn't that just like the Lord great my I grew up in in a Pentecostal teaching thinking that today I I I'm saved but tomorrow I'm going to go out and probably fall down I sure would like to be saved tomorrow but as soon as I fall down I'm going to be slapped around by this Lord that I I serve or try to anyways and that's not the Lord that we serve that's the devil's teaching that's a denominational devil that's the one that's found to be a liar in this verse here that we read in Revelations 2 he knows how to encourage Us in the right matters and discourage Us in the wrong matters isn't that beautiful amen we could all learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families not slapping one another right not coming to one another in love and and actually destroying one another with hurtful words but to actually just simply encourage in the things that need to be encouraged and just simply discouraging in the things that discourage you know saying you know maybe we shouldn't do it that way maybe we should actually think about doing things differently I just love this we could all learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families and better still we could all learn a good lesson and that God deals with each one of us in exactly this way don't ever be discouraged saint of God for God is not ungracious to forget your labors of Love whatever we do even giving a cup of cold water to someone has a reward and blessing from the Lord amen I Know Thy Works thy labor thy patience as he walks in the midst of his church he is aware of the suffering of his people and he cares my as it was in the days of the Captivity in Egypt when he heard their cries he who never changes still hears the cries of the oppressed as he walks amongst them the very word labor signifies weariness through oppression God's people do not only work for him in a labor of love amen but they suffer for him with joy they are patient in bearing the Yoke this first age suffered great persecution it had to work hard to preach the gospel and shed forth truth their High Calling in life was to serve God and when their hopes in life were blighted as they were patient and and committed all to him who had promised a lasting recompense in heaven for what they had given up for him on Earth he says I think we ought to stop here and deal with the thought that God's people have always been and always will be persecuted you know that Genesis is the book of beginnings and what you find started there will carry right on through the revelation and never change there we see that Cain persecuted and killed Abel because the latter pleased God we know the story Cain was given instruction and he just couldn't ref he couldn't accept it he was given the opportunity to repent but he just refused it we know he goes on to say then we see a perfect picture in Abraham son of the flesh ishel who teased and fought the son of Promise Isaac and there was Esau who hated Jacob and would have killed him but we know that God said Esau have I hated and Jacob have I loved he says had not God intervened in the New Testament we find Judas betraying Jesus while religious orders of the first century attempted to destroy the early Believers the children of this world controlled by the devil hate the children of God who are controlled by the Spirit yes I just think that's so important brothers and sisters it's going to be something that we have to contend with but you know there's still going to be hate it doesn't matter if you're of the devil it's hate amen people hate one another all the time yes but if we're going to be hated we might as well be hated for the right thing my I just think it's so beautiful how we have this wonderful promise here um soy bear with me for a second here then we okay uh there we go paragraph 64 no matter how just and upright a Christian is before the public and how graci ious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the Holy Ghost in tongues prophecy healing and miracles and he will be condemned many people confess Christ as their savior but boy when you start talking about the spirit and the manifestation of the fruit of the spirit in your life then you're going to actually suffer that's when it comes on the spirit of of this world hates the spirit of God and because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells persecution and trials are a natural normal part of the Christian Life there is only one thing you can do about them commit them all to God judge not and leave their outworking and final judgment to him don't try and do it on your own we can't do it on our own we don't want to judge one another we don't want to judge the ranked Sinners the people that would persecute us even when our brother or our sister does it we don't want to judge them maybe they just got ill you know brothers and sisters we catch colds naturally sometimes we can catch a spiritual cold and we just need some time to heal we need some time to get over it we need some time to develop some spiritual antibodies as that's why it's important to pray for one another because when we do that we'll see overcoming power in our brothers and sisters lives right paragraph 66 thou cast not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars these Ephesians believed that God's people ought to be holy according to this verse they took steps to keep the body unleavened from sin most evidently the apostasy had already started sin had entered into the church but they were obedient to the words of Paul when he said to put away the wicked from amongst them they were a separated people they had come out of the world and now they weren't going to let the world enter amongst them now brothers and sisters I'm not talking about our brothers and sisters here I don't think brother Bram is talking about that either when we've had a real experience when we've been able to understand people in this world that don't believe this word they're evil and you know what they might not have malicious intent but you're either under the influence of the Holy Spirit or you're under the influence of the mark of the beast those are the only two Spirits at work in this world yes but once we've come into the church once we recognize the goodness the grace of God under the messenger of this age William Mary and Bram the prophet for our age once we recognize that just like Paul was the messenger to the Ephesian Church age then we push aside all of that worldly influence we don't want nothing to do with that you become a separated person when you recognize the grace of God you don't go and run with your your school friends who do worldly things that turn out to be sinful things you don't go and do that you actually separate yourself you don't take your families to sinful places and events we don't watch sinful things we don't listen to sinful things we're a separated people they had come out of the world and now they weren't going to let the world enter amongst them brothers and sisters that's why I preach the Holy Ghost that's why I preach it over and over and over again because I know that the world will not want one part of that Holy Ghost but the Saints do they would not put up with sin in the church Holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a figure of speech it was a way of life and we know brothers and sisters that the law kth doesn't it the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen and when you live under a a a a ministry that's dos and don'ts whether it's a man's idea or or whether it's according to the word of God and it's only taken you through justification all the way up to sanctification and you just live a legalistic perspective you're only ever going to go go that far right you'll never have the spirit the dynamic Holy Ghost living in your life right paragraph 67 thou Hast tried them that say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars it just really struck me that part of the verse brothers and sisters because if they truly were believers they would just be fellowshipping and their lives would manifest The Works of God wouldn't they they wouldn't have to say to anybody that I'm a Believer they wouldn't have to say they are an apostle brother bradam he says Thou H has tried them that say they are Apostles and are not and H has found them Liars he says my that is a blunt statement thou Hast tried them who call themselves Apostles and what is an apostle it's a sent one isn't that presumptuous what right has a people to try those who call themselves apostles and how do they try them oh I love this here it is isn't this beautiful the way he does it he's not saying that that we can just say oh my I I'm going to call someone a liar there's a benchmark there is a a a ruler there is a standard and he he says it Galatians 1:8 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have already preached unto you let him be accursed paragraph 68 it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change not even a DOT a dash of it or a dash of it Paul knew it was God who had spoken to him so he said even if I come and try and give a second Revelation try to make one little change in what I gave original let me be a cursed I think we heard it said I I remember brother Toby said it I think his dad said it someone said it brother Toby mentioned that you know if brother brandham came back and said you know what I got a different Revelation I'm so sorry if he came back from the dead and we saw him as a spirit or something I'm so sorry I've got another Revelation as Believers sorry buddy we believe what Paul preached and we're not going to accept anything else even if someone came back from the dead an angel yes even if come and try to give a second Revelation try to make one little change in what I gave originally let me be a cursed you see Paul knew that the first revelation was correct God couldn't give a first revelation then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind and we know brother bradam he preaches a message does God ever change his mind so important to hear that one paragraph 69 n he can give a revelation and then add to it he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated that seed had to come through Abraham and then later said it would come by the same Bloodlines in David but it was the same Revelation yes it only gave the people more information to help them receive an understand it but God's word can't change the seed came exactly as revealed Hallelujah and see what those false apostles were doing they came with their own word those Ephesians knew that word as Paul had taught it there were full of the Holy Ghost by laying on of Paul's hands they looked those false prophets in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you therefore are false I just love that because you know brothers and sisters we have the obligation as Spirit-filled Holy Ghost filled Believers the elected bride of Jesus Christ to know where we stand upon this word and if someone is preaching not what Paul preached it is Our obligation to be just like those True Believers in the Ephesian Church age to look at those men and say to them to their face in their eyes you are off the word you're not preaching what Paul preached and you know brother bradam he says it to stay with your pastor stick with your pastor he'll lead you through and now absolutely right but what happens when a pastor's off the word can you have a conversation with them can you say hey buddy I don't know I just want to talk to you and have a conversation and you know what happens right quick if that brother is truly of the spirit of the Lord he's going to say my please tell me I want to have a conversation about this I want to be on the word yes I know that I I have the spirit that Jesus Christ gave me and it's it's gold and it's designed to be beaten and molded but it's not brass it's not just going to snap and break as soon as something comes against it but we know that's the true definition of a false Apostle someone that actually brings something different and remember those people probably intend to be true intend to have the right motive but if they don't have the right Spirit they'll never be able to bring the right word that's why we have to know the word brothers and sisters we've got to have the spirit of Christ you don't have to memorize every single verse you don't have to know the whole entire message you have to know the author of both of those and if you know the author of both of those he the spirit of Truth when he comes on the scene when he comes in your life he will lead you and guide you into all truth and he'll give you the ability to have courage to go and say hey buddy you're preaching not what Paul preached and that brother if he is a true seed he'll say oh my forgive me that's right right amen you will but Bram says oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it's not that you re it's not it is not you that really tries the Apostle and the prophet and the teacher it is the word that tries them and that just sets my heart on fire brothers and sisters as I was going through this I thought you know when I first heard about the message of the hour I thought this guy and and and being able to discern the hearts of people and how I would never ever ever put myself in front of that man because of of all the terrible things that I did in my life and I knew who I was and I didn't want anybody else to know about and I'm sure that many people could say Amen to that but you don't have to but we know who we are on the innermost innermost of our lives and who would want someone to look through your heart and discern you and be able to say exactly where you've been what you've done and how much you've done it what a terrible thing that would be but my goodness when you truly get filled with the Holy Ghost you say hey I would love to sit with a man like that because I just want one word for him to say you're truly a Christian just like that testimony of sister Bruce in the private interview I've seen you under discernment and I know that you're a real Christian you're a real believer just like those Saints back at Ephesus amen it's not us that judges people it's not those people in Ephesus that judge the false Apostles it's the word that judges them and the True Believer will always get in line with the word but the one who is a false Apostle he'll say no no no you you're wrong you're off I've got the right Revelation and unless you follow me you're going to burn and you know I'm saying it that way I'm just just uh by I just get excited with this here brother ROM he says it if you don't get it if you don't follow the word then you're lost that's what he says paragraph 71 one of these days there's going to come a prophet to the leoan church age and you will know if he is the one sent from God or not yes you will I'm so glad that we can say we're one of them hey we were singing that on the weekend and it just made my heart so happy so much joy to say I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them because I never did it I never did it in the first place he's the one that did it and for me to be able to recognize that for us to be able to recognize that brothers and sisters there should not be a quiet person in a worship service if you know that you're one of them right amen my he says yes you will you'll recognize it for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul isn't that beautiful we've got a benchmark brothers and sisters and that this is what did it for me this is where I could I could preach man this is what gets me excited this sets my heart on fire because where else could we go but to the word of God Amen what other Plum line do we have in this world in this universe there's nothing else we can we were talking about on the weekend you know we got the Book of Mormon we could say you know we've got another book Jehovah's Witness we've got some other other other Amendment or addendum to the word of God now some people might say well brother Barry that that book that you got that that so-called Prophet wrote the the exposition of the seven Church ages but what is he saying in here continually over and over and over again by the spirit go back to the word get back to the word get in line with the word what other Plum line is there in this world I better call them musicians for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate it from that word for a moment not by one ioda now I'm like man I got to look that up what is Iota what is iota mean it's the ninth letter of the Greek alphabet an extremely small amount yes he won't deviate one extremely small amount he'll stay exactly on that word in the last age when where there will be many false prophets appearing watch and see how they will keep telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you will be lost the identification of a false prophet and will he accept correction by the word that's the identification of a true true seed of God right the false prophet will say wrong I've got the edge you're not going to teach me nothing you're not going to tell me nothing I've been in the message for however many years but a true seed of God if they are off if they are wrong they'll say Lord have mercy on my soul let me get right back in line with that word let me repent and go back to my first love but he said says watch and see how they keep telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you'll be lost and I I learned it early on when I started coming around the message of the of the hour I had no idea about this but you know what I call it I call it a a Ministry of fear it's a Ministry of fear because what those false Apostles do those false prophets they they scare people into following them if you don't follow me the way that I teach it my goodness you're going to be lost but you know what just follow the word of God and see if he won't lead you and guide you into all truth he says but when that last day Prophet comes on the scene if he is truly that prophet he will be crying out get back to the word or you are lost not follow me not follow my book not follow my teachings my Revelation my theories my traditions my ideas get back to the word or you're lost he won't build on a private Revelation or interpretation but on the word amen and amen I'm so sorry I just want to I want to preach now I'm going to I'm going to stop there we'll pick up on paragraph 72 and uh maybe do a little recap next week God richly bless you as we go forwards I just trust brothers and sisters that we could be encouraged by this that we will be able to have the identification of a false prophet in our lives that we'll understand there's only one Plum line and that is the word of God that's the only absolute that we've got that's our North Star and and if we take the compass in our lives of this word and just take a look at it it will always always point to the North Star there's no magnetic deviation let's just stand as we pray gracious Heavenly Father we thank you you for your word Lord father we thank you for the Revelation that you've given us Lord Jesus in our day to know that Lord you don't want to destroy us oh Father you want to discourage Us in the things that you don't want us to do oh Lord but you want to encourage Us in the things that you want father I pray that tonight we would just be encouraged father more by Your

commit each life into your hands Lord as we go forwards tonight Lord we pray that you would keep your hand upon us Lord we pray that as we go forwards and we suffer persecutions that we would remember
