love oh well this is my story this is my son I'm praising my savior all the day [Music] he sees my story this is my son praising my savior over day long praising My Savior all day long while praising my savior all the day long amen amen amen when he reached down his hands for me of that song [Music] [Music] [Applause] but myself gave me peace joy and love when he reached down his hands for me oh when he reached down his hands for me [Music] I was lost and I'm done without God or his son when he reached down he sends for me I was never in despair when he came to me there and he showed me that I could be free turn my feet and gave me Glory complete when he reached down his hands for me when he reached when he reached town is for me are you grateful for that when you reached down your hands for me the springboard to receive the message of the hour and to be able to receive the Revelation from that and and that that that that Revelation brothers and sisters will change our bodies one day one of these days our bodies won't be able to contain the the entirety of that Revelation because once the church recognizes what it is then the Rapture will go and that day has never been closer Brothers and Sisters Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Christ on Earth again in flesh you know we say that he came in 1963 and he opened the seals he came he descended from heaven with a shout with the voice and the Trump of God he had an open book when he descended he said his his right foot on the land and his left foot on the sea and and declared that there shall be time no more and opened open the word to us gave us the little book and told us to eat it up just like John that Revelation what that does to us is it gives us the ability to see now we're going from being in in the earth in an Earthly carnal state to a spiritual state that there is actually a revelation of a door open in heaven where John was called to come up hither not just stay here in the denominational teachings not just stay here in in all of the things that we thought we knew but to come up higher and that higher Revelation is the message of the our brothers and sisters in this message adoption brother Branham goes on to say you know after we talked about Revelation and the importance of it he talks about this here he says that you know about a dead man he says tell a Dead Man He's a hypocrite and see what happens and what he's talking about is getting that Revelation in our lives about who we are having the new birth in our lives truly having his Spirit within us when we have his Spirit within us we're new creatures in Christ Jesus we are not the same carnal men that we were he says tell a Dead Man He's a hypocrite and see what happens kick him on the side and say you old hypocrite you he won't say a word he says he will not say a word did you ever kick something that's dead it doesn't squirm usually stinks it just doesn't even move brother Bradham says and that's right he'll just lay there kick him in the side call him a hypocrite and a man that's dead in Christ you can call him a hypocrite call him anything you want to and he'll never rise up about it I just love this part this is the best part right here he says that man if anything he'll just slip off somewhere and pray for you he'll just slip off somewhere and pray for you how many of us could have someone come and call us a hypocrite and kick us in our side and not do something about it I believe we need to get to that place brothers and sisters we have to we have to brother Bradham says but oh some of them is very much alive and you know it there's some people you can't say anything to doesn't matter just even words you can't say anything to let alone if you've got a little prickly with them oh my you might even have a fight physical believers they're just not dead enough yet we need to get that Revelation into our souls not just in our minds and not just in our hearts brothers and sisters but all the way into our souls many people have still remained on the longest journey of their lives I heard this a little while ago and it's just gonna stick with me forever and the longest journey of many people's lives is the distance of that Revelation that's up in their head stuck in their head the distance to their heart to their soul the distance that that Revelation has to travel that 18 inches that it takes to get all the way down in there many people have had knowledge many people are Justified and Sanctified and even filled with the Holy Ghost on the carnal level on on the spirit level on the flesh level and and God has blessed them abundantly you can see it loud and clear in their lives but they still don't have that life inside them all the way down in their souls because if you were to accidentally kick them or even kick them on purpose but I don't believe a Christian would ever kick someone on purpose a true Christian a True Believer if somebody actually did get look out those people who don't have the Holy Ghost all the way down my goodness the power of God will manifest in in a life of a son and daughter of God brothers and sisters we don't have to try and drum up the works we don't have to try and drum anything up it just happens the signs and the Wonders they follow these signs shall follow those people who believe Mark 16 in action the only true church the only church that Christ claims as his own Mark 16 in action the power of God will manifest you know he goes in his message adoption in in in adoption uh I think it's the fourth one I could be wrong sorry about the the lack of transparency on which one it is but he's talking about uh Adam and and losing his sonship here he says and he lost oh his godship and he lost his sonship he lost his domain and Satan took it over and we know that Adam willfully did that Adam wasn't deceived the woman was the serpent deceived the woman and Out of Love Adam followed his wife because he loved her so much and you know the same thing happened to Christ in the church the church stepped out and and we didn't do it but it just happened that way we're now beneficiaries of that curse and and Christ our husband stepped out after us to bring us back brother Branham says Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again and I can say with authority I can say for sure here we are brothers and sisters every single one of us who has had that Revelation drop in our heart we can say here we are there has to be someone sometime that says be it unto me according to Thy word there's got to be someone that can recognize that they are a son and daughter of God but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again Satan thinks he's God at all and he thinks he's got the Dominion and he thinks he's just going to take us down but you know what all of his power has been robbed and as much as he thinks it he knows it he's the greatest liar there ever was everything that he says he believes but we know it's a lie brother Adam says waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested what's going to be the full sons of God brothers and sisters we just talked about it Mark 16 in action being the true church the one that Christ chooses as his own the only one that he calls his own the true church Mark 16 in action you know what waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested it's just having the word it's being so far into the word and having the word so far into us that we're in that hedge that we're in that that cleft of the rock that we're in that that rock of Revelation in our lives that rock of Revelation is in our lives so far that we are the full manifestation of the sons of God the world will look at us and say look that's brother Mervin that's brother Faron that's brother Toby that's brother Justice that's brother Joel that's brother miles they're all the same people flesh and blood but something on the inside's way different than what the world sees way different than what the world sees waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets to the top we know that we're at the top brothers and sisters we know that we're at the top and right at the top where that headstone comes down there's no mortar in between I remember brother Meadow saying that there's no mortar between The Headstone and the pyramid that Capstone Revelation is what it is brothers and sisters that Capstone Revelation about Christ in the true church is the manifestation of the sons of God and here we are when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out Hallelujah and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him yes sir it belongs to him he's not saying that it's being taken away God isn't taking that power away he's saying the manifested sons of God are taking that power away I'll just read it all again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top where the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out the power of God in the manifested sons of God and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him yes sir it belongs to him you know brothers and sisters the word says that now we are the sons of God it just it just we just don't know what it will be but we know that when we shall see him that we shall be like him when he shall appear well she will look just like him and you know what it'll be it'll be our character brothers and sisters where he prudent prunes that hedge and just lets that little bit change in our lives and that little other bit change in our lives where Satan just gets a little bit and and just pokes us a little bit and gets our attention and we come back and we say yes daddy forgive me I know that I've overstepped I just want to be right I don't want to be wrong I want to be in line with your word and then he'll just let that hedge grow back in over there because that part of the character is developed enough and then maybe just another little part over here will just get opened up just a little bit just to correct us a little bit where we'll come back and say I'm so sorry Daddy forgive me I don't want to upset you I want to be in your perfect will be it unto me according to Thy Word brothers and sisters now we are the sons of God that's what the word says we don't have to wait to say that someday out there we're going to become a sons of God I believe that's one of the biggest tricks of the devil to the church today is for us to think that someday somewhere it's going to happen you know what it's already happened all of it's already happened Christ has already died and rose again and took the keys of death and Hell from Satan that's already happened the prophet of Malachi 4 has already come he's already descended with a shout and the voice and the Trump of the Archangel he's already given an open book He's already placed the sword back in the hands of men all that Adam has lost has already been given back what are we waiting for brothers and sisters it's time to start to speak those words to speak the words into existence now we are the sons of God we don't have to wait until another day someone has to rise up and say be it unto me according to Thy word Lord I personally believe it this is this is my opinion and I'm just going to say it I personally believe it that he's just waiting for us to recognize it he's just waiting for us to start saying someone has to do it someone has to cross over Jordan someone has to be the one to go into the promised land and Conquer The Devil and take away all the powers that he's got and it's not going and taking all the powers away and and and rushing over to my brother's house and and laying on of hands and anointing with oil and praying a holy prayer on him because I'm going to take away all the powers of Satan in my brother's life no it's going and getting on our knees and saying no you have no more power over me Satan you have no more power over this flesh Satan you have no more power over my family Satan this sacrifice is fresh right now I drive down a stake right now in the name of Jesus Christ again so you have no power and the more we do that the more we demonstrate that we truly are sons of God that we truly are coming into our position that it truly is the manifestation of the Son of God in the children's lives brother Adam says that remember we are now his bride we're not going to be someday we are now you know when we say bride Sons and Daughters same thing might sound a little weird to say it that way but it's the same comparison I would say even even even more Dominion to be a bride than it is to be a child wouldn't you think Esther had half of the Kingdom if she wanted it all she had to do was identify with the word for her day she just had to reach out and touch that scepter he says and remember now as his bride pregnanted with his Spirit oh my the church bearing Children See pregnated by his spirit with this name bearing his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the preeminence as evidence of his resurrection showing that he is not dead but Alive forevermore Christ in you the hope of glory not just being associated with a church affiliated with a membership to something that's good that sounds wonderful that the the blessings fall and the people are nice no no no no no the living Jesus Christ in flesh again in our lives in our homes in our families in our church an Apostolic blessing in every one of our lives that we experience letting our children see a god with flesh on them not one of us wants to see our children grow up and become grossed out with the message of the hour none of us wants to see that and how is that going to not happen the children need to see God the children need to fear God the children need to have that revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ they have to go and and receive that rock of Revelation that we talked about earlier that place that's right beside God where they know it's the safest place because if they get out from under the blood you know what they've just stepped out from behind that hedge and you know there's no protection outside of that hedge unless God really wants you and you know if you are a son and daughter of God he might just let Satan Crush you but he can't touch your soul we don't want to get outside that hedge we want to stay right there right beside our trainer right beside the Lord Jesus Christ right there where that safest place is for us he says oh my the church bearing pregnated by his spirit with the name this name bearing his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the preeminances evidence of his resurrection showing that he is not dead but Alive forevermore god with skin on him alive today this is eternal life and vindicates to the world that we are alive in him I'm sorry I threw a couple of sentences of my own Christ with flesh on him today this is a quote out of Christ The Mystery of God revealed I did a little paraphrasing I injected a sentence forgive me for it but brothers and sisters that's what our families need to see that's what the world needs to see the world doesn't want to see another church passing around the offering plate getting together and being holy and then getting out into the world and just being whoever you are people want to see Jesus Christ people want to see the Life of Christ if you could show people the true sign of the true witness of the Lord Jesus Christ you would get their attention and you know what every single time that we go into this world and we talk to people and and we deal with people we interact with people they know it we've talked about it so many times they'll apologize for swearing without even understanding why they've apologized for swearing it's because they've come into the presence of the almighty God and don't even know it but something on the inside of the inside recognizes it remember when Jesus Christ was here the most religious just people of the day they couldn't understand that he was God but the Devils recognized them the Devils cried out and said oh what have we done that you've come to us before the time please don't send us all the way back just let us go into that herd of pigs over there can you imagine that the devil's recognized it but the most religious people just went right by them he was a heretic in their day same thing for us brothers and sisters that's why people can't recognize him but you know there's a few people that will as we live our lives every single one of us has a testimony somewhere along the way some how some person the Lord Jesus Christ in flesh he came and introduced himself and told us of his grace showed us that there was a better way showed us that we were actually not just called into an association but that we've been called from before the foundation of the world to come and actually partake at his table that there's actually a place marker with your name from before the foundation of the world at the marriage supper of the Lamb can you imagine that every one of us has to come every one of us has to learn it that there is something for us it's because of Revelation it's that rock of Revelation brothers and sisters and everyone has the opportunity to hear about it if we don't go and interact in this world if we don't deal with people in this world how will they ever know about our testimony how will they ever know who we are this is eternal life brother Branham says and vindicates to the world that we are alive in him in Christ The Mystery of God revealed you know there's another little thing here I'll just call the musicians as we start to wrap it up here we're going to have service again on Wednesday and then again on Sunday and I don't want to wear the people out but you know there comes a point in time brothers and sisters where I believe I trust that we're all feeling good these days with where things are at in terms of the church and the stability in the church you know we might not understand some of the things that are happening or or not happening maybe according to the way things were before or what we want to see things maybe be like in the future but you know just like in Jesus day there were things that were happening that were confusing for the people and the people didn't really understand it necessarily but you know what there was something in their hearts that just said amen when the word came and and I just I've just had this thought on my heart you know I apologize if I'm certainly not what maybe you anticipated as a pastor here because if we have an idea in our mind that something should be a certain way and and it doesn't turn out the way that we want it to be it can be a very difficult thing for us to actually just go forwards with joy to go forwards with happiness in our lives [Music] but you know even if we see things that maybe aren't the way that we would like them to be if I could just encourage one thing when you hear the word just say Amen to it just say Amen to it Mary might not have understood what was happening when Gabriel came to her and said hail thou highly favored among women but she said amen to the word brothers and sisters just say Amen to the word God will use even a donkey to speak to man and if he wants to call me a donkey hey I want to serve him with all my might I don't want to put myself anywhere the only thing I want to do is try and encourage everyone to come to that place where they see the fullness of Christ in them that they would be able to say this is eternal life and and that my life vindicates not me Barry Johnson but us individually Our Lives it indicates it vindicates to the world around us that we have him alive and well in US that's my desire brothers and sisters not not to try and promote my agenda or my ideas just to to maybe have the ball and try and run with all my might and see if we can get it a few more yards down the field and and if the Lord should tarry someone else will get the ball it's the way it works we don't want to try and take it from anyone we want to try and encourage what God's doing but brothers and sisters just say Amen even if you don't understand it just just say Amen Mary I don't think she necessarily understood it do you think she understood it what the angel was telling her maybe she had a teaching that that she understood that Isaiah said that you know there there would be a sign that that a virgin shall concede maybe she was taught that in her life but she could could she understand that it was her could she understand how there's no understanding of it did Hattie Wright understand to speak squirrels into existence something in her that eternal life from before the foundation of the world it just said it just said that ain't nothing but the truth and you know what was in her heart manifested in her mouth and came out and because she said amen to the word what did the prophet of God say God just told me to give you anything that you want in the name of Jesus Christ brothers and sisters if we're in Christ today just say Amen to the word just say Amen to the word don't get caught up in the flesh don't get caught up in the in the church don't get caught up in all the things of Life the time is short we're at the Finish Line it's time to keep pressing on more than ever encourage one another exhort one another even more so as you see the day approaching brothers and sisters we are here every one of these people Mary and sister Hattie you know they had one thing in common stand with me this morning you know what they had in common they believed and I believe the same thing brothers and sisters I I don't want to be standing here on my own Steam on my own my own idea I I only want to be serving the lord that's my desire is to see the Lord served and to see the brothers and the sisters in this church just grow to the fullness the full stature of a perfect man to see the Lord Jesus Christ vindicate himself personally to each and every life that the children would see God with flesh on that when the children are confronted with things in their lives they would have such an anointing of the spirit of God in their lives that the children around them would all not just have peer pressure but they would say oh no we need to leave them alone because they're special there's something special about them that the spirits that are within those kids trying to put peer pressure on everyone else would say no no no no no no oh no that's highly favored among God we need to leave that one alone that's what we need brothers and sisters that's my desire is to see the power of God live out through our lives in such a way that maybe we have never seen before let's just bow before him this morning gracious Lord Jesus one more time we're just so thankful for your grace and for your mercy to us Lord father we're thankful for that rock of Revelation that you have given us Lord Jesus not just about good old-fashioned Bible stories or or or the good old-fashioned [Music] without God [Music] [Applause] my heart doth Rejoice since I made it in my choice from The Tempest to him now I flee [Music] for me oh when he reached down his hands for me when he reached down his hands for me [Music] on when he reached down his hands for me since the Lord

people started to understand that there actually was a resurrection and that's why we gather Sunday mornings not because of tradition in honor of that Resurrection because we know one of these days Everything Will Change once again welcome to the house of the Lord God bless you musicians thank you so much if you have your Bibles today we have a couple of scriptures we'd like to get into Maybe look at things just a little bit differently today many times we have ideas and thoughts and trust that the Lord will lead us and guide us here I'd like to read from Matthew chapter 16. verses 13 to 18. Matthew chapter 16. verses 13. to 18. a very familiar scripture just trust the Lord will speak to us today when Jesus came into the coast of caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah's or one of the prophets and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock will I build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it verse 19 and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word we thank you Lord that it's not just a a word a page of History it's not a an encyclopedia or a theological study but it's truly a Living Word it's a Living Sacrifice it's a living person and every time we speak your word it brings you to life and father we pray that you would just take these words that are spoken today take this scripture that was just read and just reveal it to us further Lord according to your will today and will be careful to give you all the glory we just love you and we thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated this morning it's certainly nice to see some good weather some milder temperatures outside we've been very fortunate this year and we haven't had a a terrible winter so we're certainly not complaining but boy oh boy when we start to hear the birds change their songs they start to sing a different song when the weather gets nice isn't it an amazing sort of a type there's going to be a different song sung in heaven when that when that weather changes when the redeemed are there you know our brother I just asked the Lord I ask him every time to just confirm his word I talked to Lisa many times my wife about this and trying to get ready for a service and you know she'll ask what are you going to talk about and I say you know I have a few ideas a few thoughts and and and stuff and I say that you know I just don't want to go and speak just to speak you want to bring something fresh and and new something that will encourage God's children that will feed his sheep so it could be so easy to just come and and speak eloquently but boy we just sure love when he confirms his word and that's what I'm getting at this morning I ask him to confirm his word just to show me a little just a little sign something that will just make me feel good just give me that courage to know that this isn't just Barry's thoughts I don't want to bring you my thoughts I I don't have anything to bring you know just hearing brother Mervin pray you know all we need is one word from him if we could just hear him speak the word to us to just have that little confirmation that we need in our lives and when he was praying he just made me think about it when he said just speak the word the the Centurion you know he said I'm I'm not even worthy to come under your roof to have you come under my roof I'm I'm a gentile and you're a Jew but just speak the word if you could just speak one word to me you would actually bring all that I ever need in one word and and boy oh boy Jesus we know he said to his disciples there I haven't seen such faith not even in Israel and here is a gentile speaking this kind of thing to me my goodness we just want him to speak the word today amen I have a quote here that I'd like to start out with just as a little bit of encouragement maybe for someone somewhere somehow I don't know how this this happens all the time but it does the Lord just puts something there so you know what brothers and sisters some someday someday um isn't good for much if we tell ourselves someday if we tell our children someday even though someday there will be a rapture but someday there has to come a day where people recognize who they are we were sowed with the word someday I'll bring the life into the Earth and replenish it replenish the Earth what he failed to do Mary did she took the word just that one word she just took it and through Mary seed replenishes the Earth again through his bride through the word and will bring up the millennium out of the spoken word is the Original Seed I believe we're going to get into the seed discussion soon but just to think about how we're starting to see the milder temperatures you can hear a change in the songs that the birds sing we don't really have the new the the new birds back yet the birds that fly south that migrate to go to warmer temperatures but you know you can see the sun is getting taller in the sky the the sun is shining higher the days are getting longer the sun rises earlier it's it's a wonderful time because it just like Sunday morning is on honor of the Resurrection the springtime it just speaks of Resurrection it speaks of Life coming back out of the ground all the entire cycle is is happening and we know that that seed Gene of God is on Earth again just waiting for the the springtime the resurrection and Rapture to take place and it's never been closer out of the spoken word is the Original Seed is what we just read before we get too far we got a couple of announcements Monday March 22nd could be a real special day around here that could be the day that they change the restrictions if we keep on keeping on the trajectory that we are in Alberta the government might relax the restrictions um Monday March 22nd is the target date on the AHS website hopefully we can get there and begin to Fellowship together again here in church so I would say that if if it does change on the 22nd um I hope that we have some people that want to come to church on Wednesday night the 24th of March could be a real good service to see everyone here today I want to talk about a hidden life and uh that's really sort of the direction that I want to go with this service today that I felt impressed to talk about just understanding that as a believer we live a life that's strange but we live a life that's hidden in Christ and uh it's by revelation that's the only way we can do it we know that many people they they live a religious life because they're Associated to a church they they live a a special life because out of their tradition that their families give to them they're they're a part of a a traditional form of worship and and each one believes that they're living a hidden life but isn't it amazing to know that God wouldn't leave us in the dark groping in darkness gross Darkness upon the land he would take the darkest of Ages and actually give us the fullest of word give us the entirety of the word so that we can get the maximum Revelation for our day so talking about Revelation I just I'm going to step back and and do a little um I guess just read a quote from the church age book The Seven the the the uh the revelations of the seven Church ages it's out of the introduction brother Branham says the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be over emphasized Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation Revelation the book of symbols the last book of the Bible he's not talking about that he's talking about the understanding that God gives to the individual it's it's the new birth is what brother Branham calls it God revealing himself personally to the individual the revelation of who God is revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation and you I'm talking about all Revelation it's tremendously important to the church now we get into the scripture that we read in this quote here he says do you remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the disciples this question whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias others jeremius or one of the prophets but then he narrows it down and he says that's fine for all them that's what they say but who do you say that I am brings it to the personal level and that's brothers and sisters where we are today associations are fine and good but they're not going to save you it's the personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you individually that will make you eligible to be saved I don't even want to talk necessarily right now at this point about the resurrection and Rapture just understanding that salvation is revelation the only way that we can be saved is by a revelation that Jesus Christ died 2 000 years ago and rose again but you know brother Branham says somewhere in the message what good is that for me that he died back there if he's not alive in my life right now what good is it to us to know a Christ that died 2 000 years ago and you know there's millions and billions of people out there worshiping under that Banner that Christ died 2 000 years ago but they're not living a life like he's alive in them today and that really is the true Revelation is Christ needs to be alive in us today if he's not alive in us today brothers and sisters we are not Christians we are not Christians because Christian means christ-like and it doesn't mean cloaking myself in a in a religious garment we went and bought some uh we bought some uh utensils some trays and some cups for doing communion up in Edmonton at a at a at a supply store up there for churches and it says it's an uh interdenominational I think is what it said or multi-denominational but I'll tell you uh I was with brother Curtis and and it's mostly uh Catholic incredible but uh while we were up there I I had a look at a couple of garments I was you know we had talked about it so much in the past about having Robes of his righteousness and and having a clean white garment and and how people they wear these garments and and they actually sell them there and I thought wouldn't that be funny to to get one of those robes I don't even know what they call them but you know what good would that do me to put on a robe it wouldn't do me anything I would have just put on a row but I'd still be the filthy me underneath and that's what everyone does if they don't accept the word for their hour they're still wearing just a robe but it's filthy it's as filthy rags before God that's what the word says our righteousness is but filthy rags before him we need to come according to the word for our day the only way we can do that is by revelation he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed it unto thee how did that happen it was a revelation it was you know we'll just speak plainly as human beings it was a fresh thought call it a thought that came into the heart of Simon but suddenly he had an understanding that was beyond his wreck recognition as a human being Beyond his thinking he had something that just spoke to him that just gave him the understanding of who Jesus was and that's what happens to us when we get saved something tells us more about who we are something tells us that we're more than just people we're more than just associate members we're more than just message believers were more than conquerors not because we can read the Bible and I can skillfully pull up a scripture faster than anyone else can if you say the word and I'll just go and find it no it's because we've got revelation we've got the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ Living in US the word says take no thought for what you shall say in that day because of Revelation because he will give it to us he'll give us the words to speak that we need when we need them blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it the Roman Catholics say the church is built upon Peter imagine that not just the Catholic Church many churches I believe that I haven't listened to many denominational teachings as of late for probably the last decade but I doubt they're preaching Revelation I doubt that they're preaching this this level of discussion the message of the hour brother Branham says now that's really carnal that they would say the church is built upon Peter but wait a second didn't Jesus say thou art Peter upon thee will build this church Upon This Rock we'll build a church calling Peter a rock brother Branham says now that's really carnal how could God build a church Upon A man that's so unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus and he cursed while doing it God can't build his church upon any man born in sin remember this is a church without spot or wrinkle this is a church dressed in his garments his righteousness this is a church that's willing to say be it unto me Lord according to thy will be it unto me according to Thy word I I I have nothing to bring on my own Lord on our knees in the morning saying to him Lord just forgive me for every sin in my life not if I've sinned forgive me for every sin because I'm a man of unclean lips I am a man that's not worthy there's something in us that recognizes this robe is not of righteousness this robe has to perish but you know brothers and sisters when we come to that level that we make that sacrifice fresh every single day in our lives because of that Revelation that we have about who we are and who Jesus really is you know what happens is we start to speak out to our new bodies our new bodies our new theophany bodies are just right right there just just calling out to us saying amen preach it brother amen just keep praying amen just keep sacrificing don't give up just keep pressing on because there's a tremendous prize waiting for you at the end he says God can't build his church upon any man born in sin and it wasn't some rock lying there as though God had hallowed the ground at that spot even though they have a place I believe I could be wrong but I think they have a place where they say that that's what happened and the first thing that happened the Catholic Church went in and built up a church and made an altar and we know that in Rome they've got the same thing they've got Saint Peter's Cathedral and and it's a tremendous thing and they say that Saint Peter's actually buried there under the altar that they've got that church is tremendous God can't build his church upon any man born in sin and it wasn't some rock lying there as though God hallowed the spot that that ground but many times people will do that they'll look at the carnal and they'll just grab onto it will celebrate the things that are tangible in our lives but that's what makes Revelation so special it's God revealing himself personally to us that makes it so special because nobody can take that away from you it's kind of like going and getting a University degree I would think you can go and go to school and go to school and go to school and you do all the learning and you might not remember all the learning but eventually you wind up with something with your name on it it doesn't matter you don't have the diploma anymore you could see it disappear but you have that training you've met the requirements nobody can ever take away that degree from you you understand you've studied you've learned that Revelation is inside you now and you know that's what happens when we get the the word we get salvation in our lives it's a revelation to us it's not something that somebody gives us not to compare it to the University degree somebody can't say that you have now you have now graduated come up and and receive your degree in the message of the hour no no no no no it's God revealing himself personally to us and there isn't a special place even now many people you know back in in brother branham's day in in the Cod books if you want to go back and look at it in the Cod books I find it astounding actually these are people that were around when God's Prophet was here isn't it amazing to see that you know brother Bradham he brought it out so clear God's Prophet for our day that he said you know many times we say if we were there in Jesus day we would have been there in all the meetings if we were there in Jesus day we we would have supported with everything that we had in us if we were there in Jesus day you know brother Bradham says he says whatever you are today that's what you would have been there then you wouldn't be any different because this is your day this is the day the Lord has made are you going to rejoice and be glad in it or are you going to say oh if I was at another day then I could serve God better brothers and sisters there's no better day for you to serve God it's right now right here according to the revelation of the message of the hour God didn't hallow the ground at that spot God didn't hallow the ground on Sunset Mountain God didn't hallow the ground in Jeffersonville Indiana God didn't hallow the ground in Calgary Alberta well maybe he did a little bit but he still gives us cold weather he didn't hallow any ground on this Earth what he did do was he hallowed the ground that he wants to Tabernacle in the Tabernacle of the Saints the hearts of the children but the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus it was the revelation brother Branham says read it the way it's written Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but my father hath revealed it and Upon This Rock he says in Brackets revelation will I build my church the church is built on Revelation on thus saith the Lord It's not built on a man and it's not built in a location because the ground is hallowed that's man's doing that's that's Satan's doing you know we've talked many times about Cain and Abel and and that's just a direct example that brother Bradham goes into later on in the church age book right after I think it's the very next paragraph of what I've just read um he goes into the the story of Cain and Abel and and Cain and Abel they both brought sacrifices they both brought their sacrifice to the house of the Lord they wanted to worship they were both raised by their parents by by Adam and Eve they were both given the teachings the instructions I'm not saying that Cain is of Adam I'm just for the record but they're raised by their their carnal parents they both instructed them they taught them how to eat and and how to live their lives but both of them had an idea a revelation from somewhere of how they should worship and one of them brought a a a a fruit of the field Revelation and that one wasn't accepted and the other one brought a revelation of a sacrifice of a bloody lamb and we talked about them and I don't really want to spend a whole lot of time but what I do want to say is that perhaps there well not perhaps there was a time for sure and according to the Old Testament law Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever the mighty Jehovah the same one it's not two or three it's the same one there is a time for an offering from the field there is a time for a heave offering there is a time to bring in the sheaves and and offer them before the Lord to have the showbread to to offer of the fruit of the field but that wasn't the requirement for that sacrifice for that worship service the requirement for that worship service the atonement was blood and that's why it wasn't accepted and you know what happens today brothers and sisters we can be guilty if we're not careful of trying to bring a different type of sacrifice than what's required for our day today and you know what's required for our day today is the acceptance of the full word the entirety of the word for us today being able to say I might not understand the message of the hour but you know what be it unto me according to Thy word remember the Revelation if we get it we can check it we don't have to just say just because Barry Johnson said this I have to accept it just because a great Minister said that just because even William Branham said that every one of the brothers who do believe the word who have that Revelation they will say take it to the word give it the word test for yourself don't take my words take the word remember brother Bradham we've been saying it over and over and over it's got to be revealed revealed by the spirit when it's revealed by the spirit then we can confirm it by the word and when we confirm it by the word guess what we can go forwards with confidence and just sit back and trust that if it's been revealed by the spirit it's been confirmed by the word that it's going to bring forth fruits and whatever those fruits are will prove what it is but if the first two requirements have been met you can just about guarantee that it's going to bring forth fruit unto righteousness it's going to match the word Upon This Rock revelation will I build my church the church is built on Revelation not on on on on on on a man not on a a place you know going back to the Cod book The reason I was mentioning that sorry I just got excited and went off on a tangent the reason I said that if you look at the Cod book see how many times people who were right there with the prophet of God who understood praise the Lord You're the prophet of God you're the Vindicated messenger of the day but should we go out west should we come to Arizona should we move and what did he say to them every single time no I mean by all means if you want to move and change your location by all means but don't move to follow me the Rapture is not going to happen out there don't come because of me I don't know how many times it's in that book but just to look at the carnality of men not relying upon their own Revelation not allowing God to reveal the word to them themselves relying on another person's revelation we have to be careful brothers and sisters amen but as much as we have to be careful when we can get that Revelation into our heart this is what I want to try and do I don't want to try and discourage us and make us feel bad because we could be going off on the wrong direction or we just don't have the right Revelation I don't want to do that what I want to do is speak to the Bride of Jesus Christ there's people that maybe ha are new to the message of the hour who could be turning in you know what this word will change your body one day if you just sit and let it wash you just get Washed by the washing of the water of the word and see what happens you know what there's a place that we can come to brothers and sisters where the devil won't even know what to do with us we've read that quote many times and I'm not going to read that one but there's coming a place in our lives by Revelation about who we are and about how we can just submit ourselves unto the word Just Surrender ourselves unto the word and say I might not understand it completely but there's just something about it I just want to let it wash me I just want to let it feed me I just want to let it nourish me and you know what will happen it will put us in a position where Satan just won't even know what to do with us because we'll have so much Revelation about the word not just about the word but about who we are with that word in US but there's another quote that I I heard and I found and I know I'd heard it before but it was just so good to hear it again you know what there's coming a place where the devil you just won't even be able to find you amen not that he won't know what to do with you but he won't even be able to find you can you imagine that and so here we go right back into adoption again Ephesians paralleling Joshua oh my brothers and sisters we're talking about a hidden life today brother Branham says remember I said God does not condemn a sinner for sinning he's a sinner to begin with he condemns a Christian for sinning and then because he has condemned him Christ took our condemnation Christ took our condemnation so there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit I have been just churning on this scripture for for about a year now or more I'm sure longer than that but to think about that brothers and sisters what does it mean to be in the spirit and we've talked about it being in the spirit overcoming in the spirit the only way we're going to overcome by the spirit is to have Revelation in our lives to have the Revelation that we are more than conquerors that we don't need to walk around beaten down and downtrodden we're Sons and Daughters of God of of the most high God God Almighty Elohim the same one that talked to all of the Saints all of the the sages all of the prophets throughout all of the Bible that same one he condemns a Christian for sinning and then because he has condemned him he sent a sacrifice he sent Christ took our condemnation now I I say that that he sent Christ but Christ was him Christ had to be him or the sacrifice wasn't valid right so there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that just have such a longing in their heart to be together with brothers and sisters of like Precious faith they sigh and they cry for the Abominations in the land we can see all of the trouble and all of the problems and all of the heartaches and all of the broken marriages and all of the different things that go on in this world and all the children who will never ever know what it means to have a dad in the home they never had a dad to start with they'll never have that Revelation they'll never understand what it means to have a mom to raise them and nourish them and encourage them what they're getting now is Two Dads or two moms I saw just recently even three dads sigh and cry for the abomination in the land this is a this is an amazing time to look around as a Christian believer we have we have been given such an honor to be here to understand the word to represent the Lord Jesus Christ there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit just live in the spirit always singing in the spirit praying in the spirit thinking in the spirit taking every every single thought that comes into our minds into captivity and subduing them taking them to the mat and saying are you of God because if you're not of God then you're not coming out of my mouth because the words that come out of my mouth by the Revelation that I've got about who is inside of me those are creative words those words have power and if I just let fly with my mouth all the time if I think with my mouth and just few spew spew who knows how much damage I'm doing to those people around me no we need to take every single thought into captivity we know that a word is a thought expressed but if we're Sons and Daughters of God and we don't walk after this flesh we don't desire to do the things that the world desires to do go the places the world desires to go to see the things the world desires to see if we live in the spirit then you know what there's no condemnation to us then all of this this sin that that that so easily besets us in our lives it has no power over us no power over us brother Branham says if you do anything wrong it isn't willfully if you're walking in the spirit and not after the flesh if you do anything wrong it isn't willfully you don't sin willfully a man that sins willfully goes out and willfully sins never come into the body yet that's why you see people come in and round the message of the Hour come in around church and and sometimes most times they seem like the most religious people the most righteous ones but somehow some way somewhere along the way they just vaporize they just go out into the world and sadly they usually don't go alone we know that's the devil but brother Bradham says it right here the reason for that is they just never made it all the way in they just never had that full Revelation they just never had a true conversion but a man that's once in there I love how brother Branham says this and man that's once in there he's dead and his life is hid in God through Christ remember we're talking about being hid in Christ today a man that's Once Dead once there he's dead and his life is hidden God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost and the devil can't even find him he's so far back in there he would have to come out of there before the devil can ever get in for you're dead now in this quote here I've talked about this many times I'll I'll um I have it here I'll read it remember brothers and sisters in the Bible in job the story of of God and Satan and how how God and Satan had a conversation one day and he said what's up Satan what you been up to where you been he said I've been walking to and fro up and down in the Earth seeking whom I may devour and he said have you have you considered my servant job and he said yeah you know probably have but you've got a hedge around him he's all protected so I can't do anything to him and I have never been able to you know brother Brown I'm in this message he brings it out um I can't even remember what one it was I've been through so many recently but you know what he says about it is that there was actually a hedge around job job was so far in there so far Sanctified unto God by the Revelation that he had Satan couldn't even get to him and you know brothers and sisters that's no different for us many times I think it can be worded in such a way that it seems so Elusive and so out there you know all it takes is a greater sacrifice in our lives and I say that Loosely all it takes is a greater sacrifice in my life and I don't feel like I've attained it and I don't know if I ever will but I sure want to try I sure want to try to get to that place where I know that when I speak it's God speaking many times it doesn't feel like it and you know I'm so thankful that the prophet said our feelings have nothing to do with it we live in this contamination in this flesh we can't live in this world and not get filthy I remember I can't remember who it was a brother said it years ago you know back in the in the in the New Testament days when they would walk there's a reason why they had foot washing and and that was because they couldn't walk down the street in their sandals and and not get dirty their feet would sweat and the dust that would kick up would get on their feet and stick to the sweat and maybe as they're walking they would step in a wet spot or a really super squishy spot and I'm sure you know what I'm talking about there and and maybe some of that would dry out and the dust particles would get into their sweat and stick to their feet their feet were filthy you know what it's a type of walking in this world we can't walk in this world and not become filthy this flesh has to perish but if we can just understand that and accept that then we can understand the devil and his tactics and we can understand our enemies tactics we can have success over him and then we can actually just understand that you know what this flesh is gonna fail this flesh does fail every single day that's why Paul died out to himself every single day that's why we have to do it I heard a brother say it recently that sacrifice has to be fresh every day on the altar in order for us to be fathers in our homes in order for us to be Pastors in our churches in order for us to be strong Christians we have got to have a fresh sacrifice in our life if it's one and done if we say man I was at a Revival before you were even born son and I got saved there and it's all good I fixed it up with God there and that's it there's nothing you can teach me I'm not interested in trying to teach anybody anything I just want to speak the word I just want to see that sacrifice fresh in my life every time that I hear the word every time that I speak the word that's that leading bloody lamb of Jesus Christ that's the same lamb that that Abel slew in the garden and that's the same thing that happened to Abel he became a sacrifice too Christ became our ultimate sacrifice brothers and sisters so that we could live today but you know there's a time there's a place where God will put a hedge around us and many times I think that God has a hedge around us and we can't even tell many times we can get caught up in the moment and say look at this problem in my life and it must be the devil coming at me you know what God's got a hedge around you because if the devil had free reign in your life you would be crushed we would be destroyed he doesn't want to see us live and have any breath in our lungs he doesn't want to see us have any Revelation in our hearts Satan wants to kill and destroy if we've got problems in our lives and we have breath in our lungs it's because God has a hedge around us and we're just like job we need to get on our our heap of ashes and rejoice what did job do well well yet the people came and told him the servants came and told him well they yet spoke and other people came and told him and while they yet spoke more people came and told him and while they yet spoke there was another Calamity coming towards him they spoke to him and told him your life is over everything that you have is gone what did he do he didn't lament he got on his Ash Heap and he rejoiced he started to praise the Lord that's what we need to do brothers and sisters in the midst of our trials is just start to Rejoice start to praise the Lord maybe we have children who are Wayward start to praise the Lord because as they're his children and he will do what he wants with them he will save them he will bring them up the word says to train him up in the way they shall go and it won't they won't depart from it you know what that seed Gene of God is in them just keep praying just keep watering it just keep rejoicing and Watching God do the work because it's his work we can't save our children many times if we try and do it we just get in the way and make a mess but when he comes around if he could just speak the word everything would be fine let's turn over in our Bibles to Exodus chapter 34. Hallelujah Exodus chapter 34 we're talking about having a hidden life in Christ Jesus today understanding that there's a hedge around us many times we can see problems come into our life you know what it is it's because God might just allow the the gardeners to go down there and just cut a little tiny hole in that hedge because there's just that one little part in our life that's just distracting us a little bit from this word just distracting us from that little that little extra bit that we could be giving to the Lord It's consuming us it's becoming an idol in our life and God will say to the gardeners just go down there and trim a little hole over there in that little part right there and just let Satan have a little bit of access to that that that part of that person and we start to get a trial in our lives you know what we need to Rejoice because God's allowing that so that we can actually grow not so that we can be consumed remember if Satan had free access he would destroy us just like that just like that he would take our lives in Exodus chapter 34 verse 17. I trust the Lord will Stitch this together because I I myself I struggled I wondered verse 17 he says and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou Hast spoken for thou Hast found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name and he said I beseech thee show me thy Glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy on whom I will show Mercy remember election brothers and sisters and he said thou cast not see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the Lord said behold oh my there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while I my Glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cleft of The Rock and we'll cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen you know the word says that we knew in part we prophesied in part but when that which is perfect is come we look through a glass Darkly but then we shall see him face to face brothers and sisters this scripture here and the Lord said behold there is a place by me we were talking about some teachings from a camp Lisa was telling me about the teaching from Brother Eugene Braun trains horses for those people who don't know and you know one of the things that stuck with Lisa she said the safest place for a horse when they've been broken and trained the idea is to get it into a horse we know how powerful they are but that horse has to come to the place where it realizes the safest place is right beside the trainer not running around anywhere else and to think about it brothers and sisters that's our place right beside our trainer right beside our God and the Lord said behold there is a place by me that thou shalt stand upon a rock and we know in this story here he got to stand in a rock and the Lord's Glory passed by him you know I just can't help but tie this together with the scripture we read earlier where Jesus said Thou Art Peter Simon barjona Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto thee but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed this unto thee and Upon This Rock I will build my Revelation Brothers and Sisters Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever you know there's a place on a rock that's right beside him the safest place for us to ever be in our lives is right beside him and you know as we're right beside him we want to take that and apply it to our lives today when we come to that place of real Revelation in our lives about us being saved not just being saved but filled with the Holy Ghost not just filled with the Holy Ghost but actually the living Tabernacle of the Lord Jesus Christ his flesh on Earth again when we come to that place you know what Satan can't even touch you you're so far into the Lord You're so far into the word he's got such a hedge around you he can't even touch you he can't even find you this just spoke to me so much and I will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back parts once upon a time we'll look through a glass Darkly but then when that which is perfect is come we shall look at him face to face we don't have to look at his back parts we can look at him in the face and if you want to see where he's at today brothers and sisters go look in the mirror don't look in the mirror of the word I'm not saying don't look in the mirror of the word what I'm saying is look into your eyes look into your brother or your sister's eyes that's the Lord Jesus Christ today it's not your brother or your sister if they're saved if they're Justified and they're Sanctified and they're filled with the Holy Ghost that's the Lord Jesus Christ right there and to get caught up in thinking about something some ISM or something they did or didn't do think about it that's the Lord Jesus Christ you're speaking about goodness we don't want to do that an adoption brother Branham says but the purpose of this the purpose of all of this brothers and sisters is seeing your position in Christ seeing that it's not something that you just stumbled into it's not something we just happened across in our lives we didn't just stumble into it or something that might have have merited something you merited something somewhere along the way but it's what God did for you himself according to predestination from before the foundation of the world he chose us to be able to have ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church was it Isaiah was it the prophet Isaiah that was in a vision and and God said to Isaiah can these bones these Dry Bones can they hear do they have ears to hear you know brothers and sisters it was a prophecy of a day and and for the Jews but you know what's also for the Gentiles to have ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church it's not something that we might have merited somewhere but it's what God did for you himself not that you were so good that you went to a church one night and some poor brother LED you up to the altar it wasn't that and you know many times we can all stop and and say well you know I did have someone that actually talked to me about a prophet I did have someone that said God sent a prophet and it captured my attention and you know what it was brothers and sisters it was God using that person it wasn't that person it was totally God using that person just like God used that bush to not be consumed so that Abraham could look upon it or Moses sorry could look upon it and say wow why isn't that bush burning it caught his attention and when God saw that he caught his attention then he spoke to him brothers and sisters if he can see that he's got our attention how will he know that he's got our attention how will he know that he's got Barry Johnson's attention when he's got that sacrifice fresh every day not just too busy not just too too too too into my life and doing things I can honestly say I have made so many Idols in my life since I've been messaged believer since I've been saved I have created so many Idols in my life I say Lord forgive me I have had a prayer meeting and said Lord forgive me because there have been things in my life that have been more important than me getting on my knees and having that daily sacrifice Lord help us we don't want to do that when we do that we teach our children that it's okay to say that we believe the word but it's also okay to have an idol we don't want to have an idol we don't want to put anything before the word of God in our lives in our homes and you know God just wants us to actually tear it down to get that Revelation and tear it down and if we can do that brothers and sisters it's not too late if you've got an idol in your life I don't know why I'm speaking about it but I'm telling you if you got an idol in your life it's not too late if you can see that you've got it tear it down Smash It Up kick it out and you know what it might be frightening you might say well that's my way of making a living how could you dare say that about me I can say it because God who is rich in Mercy our brother prayed it today ask him you know what we're doing we're creating an idol brothers and sisters we're robbing him of our tithes and our offerings and you know what the word says where wherefore have we robbed you of our tithes and our offerings you know what he says another part you've robbed me of time you've taken your time and you've given it to other things you've given it to other idols brothers and sisters we don't want to do that we do not want to have an idol in our lives and Satan is so slick he'll get us running to and fro and up and down in the earth I'm moving and shaking I've got a business I've got this I've got a job I've got a career I've got school I've got all these different things I'm so busy you don't know what it means to be me no I don't but I do know this if any of that stuff is coming before God in your life then you're an idolater and you need to repent and if you do he will restore he'll restore every single thing that you thought you had and greater I'd rather pray to see if he won't pour out a blessing on you that you can't even contain see if he won't open the windows of heaven and just pour it out upon you you know many times we talk about tithing and we talk about money it's not about money it's about that sacrifice it's about understanding that God has given you ten percent more than you deserve he's overpaid every one of us and are we willing to say that hey I'm just going to make sure that he gets what's his because he's given me 90 percent if I give him 10. man I don't even know why I'm not even I don't want to talk about this but it's interesting because it's not about money it's not even about money the true true offering is where it's at the true tithe is in the offering offering is is above and beyond it's the sacrifice that we give to him and it can be in many different ways helping Brothers helping sisters helping the church helping giving extra money whatever it is is doing more than what you normally would going further giving of that which you actually that other ninety percent of your life whatever it is time resources skills money whether Bradham says that it was God before the foundation of the world predestinated you to eternal life that's what it was when you get there that day on the other side Before the Throne not before the throne in the throne when you get there that day no wonder the four the 40 24 Elders laid off their crowns everybody laid down their Crown everybody fell on their faces they didn't have one thing they could say no preacher no Elder no nothing all praise to the lamb God will gather in him all things at that day to think that Revelation in our lives is nothing that we've ever done nothing we could ever do nothing we have ever done it's just what he's done and recognizing that I the the Lord said behold there is a place by me that thou shalt stand upon a rock a rock of Revelation brothers and sisters about who we are not just that Peter was Revelation was was given to Peter and that he understood who Jesus Christ was that's fine and good it's very important to understand that that we're talking about all Revelation and not just the Book of Revelation but what that's doing is giving message of the hour but Lord Jesus that rock of Revelation about who we are and that there is a place of perfect rest and it's right beside you Lord Jesus father I pray that we could just take these words today and just meditate upon them in our hearts that we could just look for that place closer to you that we could just draw our our lives so close to you Lord Jesus that Satan wouldn't even be able to find us Lord we thank you for your word we thank you for your message we thank you for your encouragement to us today Lord I pray that more than anything your children would be encouraged to know that if they have that Revelation in their lives that Satan can no longer touch them he can't touch them until you say go ahead and if you do say it that it's going to be for our Perfection it's going to be to help us it's going to be so that we will grow father you're such a a wonderful father we just love you and we thank you and we bless your name we pray that you would just be glorified in our lives be glorified in our homes Lord help us to tear down the Groves help us to tear down the high places to kick out the idols and smash them before you Lord that you would see that we are serious about serving you in our lives that there is nothing in our lives that's more important than you are and then we know you will pour out a blessing on our lives that we just can't even contain and it's not necessarily a financial blessing it's a revelation blessing where we can stand before Satan and go toe-to-toe with him just like David did with Goliath that Revelation that as long as this circumcised Phyllis uncircumcised Philistine is standing in the promised land he is as defeated as anyone is because when we're in our own Promised Land we have full Authority and power Lord we just love you and we thank you and we pray that you would just bless your children today keep your hand upon each one we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen
