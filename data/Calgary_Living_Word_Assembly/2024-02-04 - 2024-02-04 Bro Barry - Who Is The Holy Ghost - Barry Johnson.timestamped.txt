[16:21] right and returneth not fether but WTH
[16:24] the Earth and maketh it bring forth and
[16:26] B that it may give seed to the SE and
[16:29] bread to the eater so shall my word be
[16:33] that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[16:35] shall not R return unto me void but it
[16:38] shall accomplish the purpose that which
[16:41] I please and it shall prosper in the
[16:43] thing where too I sent it numbers 23:19
[16:47] says God is not a man that he should lie
[16:49] neither the son of man that he should
[16:50] repent as he said and shall he not do it
[16:54] as he spoken and shall he not make it

[1:03:23] to the house of the Lord
[1:03:25] you know every time I hear that song
[1:03:27] every time we sing that song I think of
[1:03:29] that
[1:03:30] story where brother bradam talks about
[1:03:32] that that young
[1:03:34] sister that was playing the
[1:03:37] piano for that
[1:03:39] song what a tremendous Story how she
[1:03:43] just got inspired by the Holy Ghost yes
[1:03:46] and what happened was she Rose her up
[1:03:48] and she raised her hands to the Lord and
[1:03:51] just started worshiping spontaneously
[1:03:53] while she shouldn't be playing she
[1:03:54] should have been at her post of Duty but
[1:03:57] something overcame her and she started
[1:03:58] playing and isn't it interesting that
[1:04:00] the Lord took over that
[1:04:03] worship and you know brothers and
[1:04:04] sisters that same Lord that was there

[1:08:01] home this morning in our scripture
[1:08:04] reading just like to read from acts 7
[1:08:08] verse
[1:08:14] 1 acts 7 verse
[1:08:21] 1 then said the high priest
[1:08:24] are these things
[1:08:26] so and he said men Brethren and fathers
[1:08:32] hearken the god of Glory appeared unto
[1:08:35] our Father Abraham when he was in
[1:08:38] Mesopotamia before he dwelt in
[1:08:42] cheron we know this is the story of
[1:08:45] stevenh he's preaching up a sermon here
[1:08:49] verse three and they said unto him get
[1:08:51] thee out of thy country and from thy
[1:08:53] King Kindred and come into the land
[1:08:56] which I shall show thee then came he out
[1:09:00] of the land of the
[1:09:02] Chalan and dwelt in
[1:09:05] cheran and from then when his father was
[1:09:09] dead he removed him into this land
[1:09:12] wherein ye now dwell and he gave them
[1:09:16] him none inheritance in it no not so
[1:09:21] much as to set his foot on
[1:09:24] yet he promised that he would give it to
[1:09:27] him for a
[1:09:29] possession and to his seed after him as
[1:09:33] yet he had no
[1:09:35] child and God spake on this wise that
[1:09:39] his seed should sojourn in a Strange
[1:09:43] Land and that they should bring them
[1:09:47] into bondage and ENT treat them evil 400
[1:09:52] years and the nation to whom they shall
[1:09:55] be in bondage will I judge said God and
[1:09:59] after that shall they come forth and
[1:10:01] serve me in this place and he gave him
[1:10:07] the Covenant of circumcision and so
[1:10:10] Abraham begat Isaac and circumcised him
[1:10:13] the Eighth Day and Isaac begat Jacob and
[1:10:16] Jacob begat the 12
[1:10:19] Patriarchs let's just bow one more time
[1:10:22] in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we
[1:10:24] thank you for the story of Steven the
[1:10:27] testimony of his life Lord and right to
[1:10:30] the very end how he could just stand
[1:10:32] upon your word and Lord Jesus not bring
[1:10:35] his own opinion but to just simply bring
[1:10:37] your word to bring the truth of the
[1:10:39] history of this gospel father that it
[1:10:42] was so alive not just out of the pages
[1:10:44] of a book that it was so alive in the
[1:10:46] heart of our brother we know that he saw
[1:10:49] you seated on the right hand of glory
[1:10:52] and father we know that as the world
[1:10:54] hated him as as the people stoned him
[1:10:57] and took his life we know that you just
[1:11:00] you allowed it father For Your Glory now
[1:11:03] Lord as we go forwards this morning we
[1:11:05] just want to commit this service all
[1:11:06] that's said and done into your hands For
[1:11:08] Your Glory bless the reading of your
[1:11:09] word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:11:12] amen amen God bless you this morning you
[1:11:14] may be
[1:11:17] seated I don't know if somebody is
[1:11:19] missing this little brooch it was found
[1:11:23] I I think in the uh in the back room
[1:11:25] there the nursing room um the deacons
[1:11:28] found it and then put it in the office
[1:11:30] and I was supposed to mention it quite
[1:11:31] some time ago I apologize but um better
[1:11:34] late than never I guess if you're
[1:11:36] missing that brooch it's kind of
[1:11:38] beautiful I'm sure uh you could get it
[1:11:40] back if you desire are you happy this
[1:11:45] morning just a couple of announcements
[1:11:48] as we get going today we'll have a
[1:11:49] prayer meeting on the 15th at
[1:11:51] 7:30 we have a Youth Event coming up up
[1:11:53] at the 25th we've confirmed the date
[1:11:57] um there's an annual General men's
[1:11:59] meeting at the church February 29th at
[1:12:01] 7:30 p.m. we'll have all of this coming
[1:12:04] up in the very near future we are
[1:12:08] working on going away and uh we're going
[1:12:11] to go to Saskatchewan for a few days and
[1:12:15] so we'll have a couple of the brothers
[1:12:16] take two of the services here it'll be a
[1:12:18] Wednesday and a Sunday Lord willing and
[1:12:22] uh I don't know what happen on that side
[1:12:24] and I'm honestly not looking to preach I
[1:12:26] would just like to go and say Amen that
[1:12:29] would be fine with me so um this morning
[1:12:32] the direction that I would like to take
[1:12:34] uh from the scripture that we've read
[1:12:36] out of Acts chapter 7 is exactly the
[1:12:38] scripture that brother Bram took in the
[1:12:40] message what is the holy ghost in
[1:12:44] 1958 and and this is out of the Holy
[1:12:47] Ghost study out of the exposition sorry
[1:12:51] out of the table it's it's out of the
[1:12:53] table app I was going to say the
[1:12:55] exposition of seven Church ages just
[1:12:56] because it's top of mine for me it's
[1:12:58] really where I'm at these days but out
[1:13:01] of the table app if you were to look up
[1:13:03] the holy ghost in the different like the
[1:13:05] volume section of that search app you
[1:13:08] would see uh two sermons Under The
[1:13:10] Heading the Holy Ghost and uh I just
[1:13:14] think it's really important for us
[1:13:15] sometimes to never assume that everyone
[1:13:18] is on the same page that everyone just
[1:13:20] understands exactly what we're talking
[1:13:22] about sometimes we can be talking about
[1:13:24] some things and just assume that
[1:13:26] everyone is on the same page and and
[1:13:28] it's not the case sometimes the children
[1:13:30] don't know and and you know specifically
[1:13:33] to the Holy Ghost I remember when I was
[1:13:34] a child I I remember unfortunately we
[1:13:37] did see TV it was we had a television in
[1:13:39] our house when I was growing up it's not
[1:13:40] something I'm proud of but it's just the
[1:13:42] way life was and uh many people still
[1:13:45] have TV in their house and they're
[1:13:46] plugged in and they just watch whatever
[1:13:48] but you know when I was a child I think
[1:13:49] I saw too many things too many programs
[1:13:52] because I thought the Holy Ghost G was
[1:13:54] you would hear about the blood and you
[1:13:55] would hear about the ghost and all all
[1:13:57] of this different depictive terms and as
[1:13:59] a child the only reference point I had
[1:14:01] was what I was exposed to with
[1:14:03] television so I would look at the movies
[1:14:05] and see all of the advertisements and
[1:14:08] and begin to try and put it together
[1:14:09] that way as as a tangibility something
[1:14:11] that I could really understand but
[1:14:13] brothers and sisters the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:16] not something from a horror movie The
[1:14:19] Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ
[1:14:21] himself the Holy Ghost is that Pillar of
[1:14:24] Fire that we see over top of William
[1:14:25] Mary and Bram that's not just a
[1:14:27] fantastic picture of a man sent from God
[1:14:30] that is a picture of the Holy Ghost and
[1:14:33] you know when we gather together
[1:14:35] brothers and sisters we have pillars of
[1:14:37] fire also they're they're on a different
[1:14:39] Spectrum though we just don't have the
[1:14:41] ability to see that with our eyes now
[1:14:43] some people would say well brother Barry
[1:14:45] if if they could see that Pillar of Fire
[1:14:47] over top of the Prophet why can't we see
[1:14:49] it over top of each one of us because
[1:14:52] that's the way God made us
[1:14:53] yes Satan can't tell who we are Satan is
[1:14:57] only going to assume who we are and he's
[1:15:00] going to try and take every single one
[1:15:02] of our faults and failures all of our
[1:15:03] genetics he knows who our great great
[1:15:05] great great grandparents were um maybe
[1:15:07] some of them with dark pasts uh
[1:15:10] histories maybe they weren't very good
[1:15:11] people at all maybe they were under the
[1:15:13] influence of devils and we know that
[1:15:15] that spirits will travel through
[1:15:17] generations through generations through
[1:15:19] generations but you know brothers and
[1:15:20] sisters in our day and age where we live
[1:15:23] today we have been given a completely
[1:15:25] open book we have been given the
[1:15:27] complete Pillar of Fire we have been
[1:15:28] given complete deliverance from any one
[1:15:30] of those generational curses that could
[1:15:32] be over top of a family so to say that's
[1:15:35] the way my dad was that's no longer an
[1:15:38] excuse It's only because we want it to
[1:15:40] be that way we have the ability to
[1:15:42] overcome these things in our lives and
[1:15:45] it's not easy I'm not saying it's easy
[1:15:47] don't get me wrong it ain't easy it's
[1:15:49] hard but you know we've been chosen to
[1:15:52] take the harder way we've been chosen to
[1:15:54] walk the harder path how how easy was it
[1:15:58] for Jesus to take that cross and carry
[1:16:00] it up that hill as far as he could how
[1:16:03] easy was it for Jesus to go to Calvary
[1:16:05] how easy was it for Jesus to overcome
[1:16:07] his own will as a man that wanted to get
[1:16:09] married that wanted to have children
[1:16:12] that wanted to actually live as a human
[1:16:14] being to have his friends and
[1:16:16] fellowship but to lay all of that aside
[1:16:18] and say alas not my will but let thy
[1:16:22] will be done
[1:16:23] even though he was asking the Lord in
[1:16:25] one sentence earlier can I just let this
[1:16:27] cup pass from me my something changed in
[1:16:31] him he had the ability to overcome it
[1:16:33] and we know that Jesus was different
[1:16:35] than every other man although he was
[1:16:36] human he was God every wit but he still
[1:16:39] had to overcome amen he still had to
[1:16:42] have that battle yes amen but I just
[1:16:44] thought it'd be really good brothers and
[1:16:45] sisters you know we're talking on
[1:16:47] Wednesdays about the exposition of the
[1:16:48] seven Church ages and and and the Holy
[1:16:50] Ghost getting in the spirit on the Lord
[1:16:53] day getting in the spirit many times we
[1:16:55] can talk about that and say getting in
[1:16:57] the spirit is so important but what is
[1:16:58] getting in the spirit brothers and
[1:16:59] sisters it's entering in of course but
[1:17:02] we want to make sure that we're talking
[1:17:03] about the right thing we want to make
[1:17:04] sure that we're we're speaking the same
[1:17:06] language we don't want to assume
[1:17:08] anything about anyone we want to make
[1:17:10] sure when we say getting in the spirit
[1:17:11] it means getting into the Holy Spirit
[1:17:14] getting the Holy Spirit into us when
[1:17:16] that happens we will be like those
[1:17:18] people that were in the upper room 120
[1:17:20] people they got in one mind one Accord
[1:17:23] not their mind not their ideas not
[1:17:26] their stuff history all of that they
[1:17:30] weren't busy looking at themselves in
[1:17:31] the mirror they weren't busy looking at
[1:17:33] each other saying look at what you've
[1:17:34] done look at what you haven't done they
[1:17:36] finally got all of that out of the way
[1:17:39] and that's why they were told to go wait
[1:17:41] until you're endured from Power with
[1:17:44] power from on high and when that time
[1:17:46] came when they stopped looking each
[1:17:47] other when they just got in unison and
[1:17:48] one mind and one Accord what happened
[1:17:50] the Holy Ghost came sweeping through
[1:17:51] their place and what happened we know
[1:17:53] there's identifiers we can see that
[1:17:56] there's identifiers and that's one of
[1:17:58] the things that brother bradam says over
[1:17:59] and over and over again the message of
[1:18:00] the hour it ain't no different today but
[1:18:03] somehow sometimes I think I I can see it
[1:18:07] I can perceive it that somehow some way
[1:18:09] it's almost demonstrated that it is
[1:18:12] different today than it was then they
[1:18:14] stumbled like they were drunk
[1:18:17] people Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:18:20] today and forever amen I'm not saying go
[1:18:23] and roll around in the aisles and do
[1:18:25] somersaults just to prove that you can
[1:18:27] be silly and act like a drunk person but
[1:18:29] what I am saying is if the Holy Spirit
[1:18:31] overwhelms you brothers and sisters
[1:18:33] don't resist
[1:18:35] them let it
[1:18:37] go because if it's the Holy Spirit it
[1:18:40] will actually Bear record of
[1:18:43] himself so you know as we go forwards
[1:18:45] with this study the Holy Ghost the first
[1:18:49] message is what is the holy ghost in
[1:18:51] 1958 it's 12 16 the second one is that's
[1:18:55] in the morning and the next one I
[1:18:57] believe is in the evening I I could have
[1:18:59] it wrong actually I think they're two
[1:19:00] days sorry um the next one is what was
[1:19:04] the Holy Ghost given
[1:19:05] for I I would like to just maybe see if
[1:19:08] when we talk about this if by the end of
[1:19:11] it we could actually change it from what
[1:19:13] is the Holy Ghost to who is the Holy
[1:19:16] Ghost not that I want to put words in
[1:19:18] and say this is what the prophet said
[1:19:20] this is what he meant I'm not doing that
[1:19:21] what I want to do is make it present
[1:19:23] tense I am I want to make it our Holy
[1:19:25] Ghost I want to say who is the Holy
[1:19:27] Ghost it's you brothers and sisters he's
[1:19:30] chosen a temple that's not made with
[1:19:33] hands and that's really where we're
[1:19:35] going with all this but what was the
[1:19:36] Holy Ghost given for I want to change
[1:19:38] that as well to say who was the Holy
[1:19:40] Ghost given for because the Holy Ghost
[1:19:42] wasn't given for
[1:19:43] everyone not everyone has the ability to
[1:19:46] get oil in their
[1:19:48] lamps there was five wise and five
[1:19:50] unwise virgins but then there was a
[1:19:53] whole bunch of other people brothers and
[1:19:54] sisters wasn't there isn't there a lot
[1:19:58] of people that will never ever ever be
[1:20:01] able to receive anything that we say
[1:20:02] here they'll say ah it's a bunch of
[1:20:03] nonsense it's a cult you guys are
[1:20:05] fanatical crazies following a man just
[1:20:08] like everyone else without even taking a
[1:20:10] look at it and they would say the same
[1:20:11] thing to any other religion because
[1:20:13] really it's just been spun to be some
[1:20:15] kind of a business for the pastor to get
[1:20:17] up and say you know what God's given me
[1:20:18] a revelation that I need to go out and
[1:20:20] buy a jet I need a Gulf Stream
[1:20:23] I need a golf stream six and God told me
[1:20:26] to get it because I can't fly in a tube
[1:20:28] of
[1:20:30] devils so we're going to take up an
[1:20:32] offering over the next six months and
[1:20:34] and we're going to get a jet because
[1:20:35] that's what God wants that's what people
[1:20:37] see and it grosses them out or they're
[1:20:39] on there calling for money just give and
[1:20:42] God will bless you it's true but they're
[1:20:46] not interested in seeing people get
[1:20:48] blessed there's been stories of of of
[1:20:51] people sending in envelopes with checks
[1:20:55] and money orders and even cash and what
[1:20:58] what what happens the reporters go and
[1:21:01] find all of the notes without the money
[1:21:04] without the money orders without the
[1:21:06] checks just dumped in the dumpster in
[1:21:08] the back thrown out in the garbage but
[1:21:11] all the money's gone how does that make
[1:21:13] people feel it grosses people out who
[1:21:15] could blame those people but you know
[1:21:17] they've never been given ears to hear
[1:21:19] they've never been given eyes to see
[1:21:20] there was never ever a desire in their
[1:21:22] heart to receive the word like it is in
[1:21:27] us who is the Holy Ghost I want to say
[1:21:30] today brothers and sisters if you've got
[1:21:32] the Holy Ghost then you're actually the
[1:21:34] representation of the Holy
[1:21:37] Ghost it makes it pretty heavy but it's
[1:21:40] true brothers and
[1:21:41] sisters because he's not interested in
[1:21:44] dwelling in a building he's not
[1:21:45] interested in dwelling in a church or or
[1:21:48] an assembly or a group it's not about
[1:21:51] that at all it's about having having a
[1:21:53] consecrated life before the Lord Jesus
[1:21:56] Christ getting in the spirit is getting
[1:21:58] in the Holy Ghost getting the Holy Ghost
[1:22:01] in
[1:22:02] us who is the Holy
[1:22:05] Ghost we're going to study from what is
[1:22:07] the Holy Ghost today though from 1958
[1:22:10] it's message
[1:22:11] 1216 Lord willing will move on and we'll
[1:22:14] study from what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:22:17] for I I think that there's some really
[1:22:20] important lessons in here really
[1:22:22] significant things because you know
[1:22:23] brother Bram says it over and over again
[1:22:25] he says it in here in this message
[1:22:26] without the Holy Ghost it ain't going to
[1:22:28] matter what we do our works mean nothing
[1:22:32] our works will not get us in a Rapture
[1:22:34] our works will get us in a
[1:22:36] graveyard the Holy Ghost will get us out
[1:22:38] of that graveyard the Holy Ghost will
[1:22:41] get us in the
[1:22:42] Rapture so I just think it's really
[1:22:44] important for us to just stop and take a
[1:22:46] look at this you know many times we want
[1:22:48] to talk about the Mysteries and the
[1:22:49] seals and and the great healings and
[1:22:52] discern ments and how revelated we are
[1:22:55] in the message of the hour you know I I
[1:22:58] heard someone say it recently and I just
[1:23:00] thought it was astounding I I'm going to
[1:23:02] say it For Better or For Worse he said
[1:23:05] you get around some message Believers
[1:23:06] and they want to talk about the the
[1:23:08] quotes and they want to talk about the
[1:23:10] revelations that are given they want to
[1:23:12] talk about all of the deep things and
[1:23:14] the Mysteries and the prophet and all
[1:23:16] that stuff and it's good stuff but then
[1:23:19] you say to them what about Jesus Christ
[1:23:21] and they just sit there and they look at
[1:23:22] you like who's that brothers and sisters
[1:23:25] if that's what's going on we've missed
[1:23:27] the
[1:23:29] Mark we got to get him to Christ Christ
[1:23:32] is the one that died for our
[1:23:34] sins he's our
[1:23:37] savior amen hallelujah but he's come
[1:23:40] down in this age and anointed a man's
[1:23:43] lips just like every other major prophet
[1:23:45] in the
[1:23:46] Bible so that he could call himself a
[1:23:49] bride of his own
[1:23:51] choosing
[1:23:54] so we don't want want to worship the man
[1:23:56] we don't want to be busy focusing on
[1:23:59] trying to execute algebraic
[1:24:02] equations when we can't even spell
[1:24:06] properly so it just it just kind of made
[1:24:08] me think you know we should go back and
[1:24:10] talk about some of the
[1:24:11] ABCs let's talk about the Holy Ghost
[1:24:13] what about the Holy Ghost got me into it
[1:24:15] so here we go out of 1959 1216 I
[1:24:19] actually added one brother Logan I
[1:24:21] apologize this one is paragraph 12 from
[1:24:23] the app upon this place it's right at
[1:24:27] the very beginning brother bradam says
[1:24:29] upon this
[1:24:30] place this is Brother bram's heart as
[1:24:33] he's getting into this as he's opening
[1:24:35] the service upon this
[1:24:37] place we wish to approach the
[1:24:41] subject which I think is the outstanding
[1:24:44] subject of
[1:24:46] today and that's not just yesterday
[1:24:48] brothers and sisters is it I think is
[1:24:51] the out standing subject of today of the
[1:24:55] what is the Holy Spirit what is
[1:24:59] it and now the reason I have taken these
[1:25:02] subject in line like this you cannot
[1:25:06] come and receive the Holy Spirit unless
[1:25:10] you know what it
[1:25:14] is that one got
[1:25:16] me we can't come and expect to receive
[1:25:19] the Holy Spirit unless we know what it
[1:25:21] is amen
[1:25:23] and you cannot receive it if you if you
[1:25:27] know what it is unless you believe it's
[1:25:30] given to you and it's for
[1:25:34] you and then you cannot know whether
[1:25:37] you've got it or not unless you know
[1:25:40] what results it
[1:25:44] brings remember we talked about this and
[1:25:46] I'm going to keep harping on it brothers
[1:25:48] and sisters brother Bram in in in in the
[1:25:51] revelation of Jesus Christ I want to
[1:25:53] make sure that we get that part figured
[1:25:55] out rock solid as we go forwards with
[1:25:57] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:25:59] because it's not just a theological
[1:26:01] study of the message of the hour what
[1:26:03] the prophet gave us even though it can
[1:26:05] be interpreted that way brothers and
[1:26:06] sisters that book is actually directing
[1:26:08] people to Christ so they can actually
[1:26:11] understand the historical value of what
[1:26:13] really took place in the
[1:26:16] world but you know if we get a great
[1:26:19] Revelation it's revealed by the spirit
[1:26:21] sometimes I think it's revealed by a
[1:26:23] spirit but if it's revealed by the Holy
[1:26:26] Spirit brothers and sisters it's going
[1:26:28] to actually be identified in the word
[1:26:31] amen and that's exactly what the prophet
[1:26:33] for our day said if it's revealed by the
[1:26:36] spirit it will be identified in the word
[1:26:40] and I'd say it today it'll also be
[1:26:42] identified in the message of the
[1:26:44] hour and the word amen the word of God
[1:26:48] the message of the hour as a whole the
[1:26:50] two actually are one right we won't get
[1:26:52] into that too far today but the message
[1:26:54] just points to Christ just points to the
[1:26:56] word the unfailing body word of Jesus
[1:26:59] Christ but brothers and sisters if we
[1:27:02] get a revelation it's going to be
[1:27:03] revealed by the spirit it's going to be
[1:27:05] identified by the word and then you want
[1:27:07] the rubber meets the road it's going to
[1:27:08] be manifest it's going to actually show
[1:27:11] the results that it bears by what it
[1:27:14] manifests and if it's not manifesting
[1:27:17] something according to the word if it's
[1:27:19] manifesting something outside of the
[1:27:21] word it's the wrong
[1:27:24] Revelation and if it's manifesting
[1:27:27] something that's outside of the word I
[1:27:28] guarantee you you're not going to be
[1:27:30] able to take it back to the word and say
[1:27:31] God gave me this Revelation I can behave
[1:27:33] this way it's okay if it's not in the
[1:27:36] word brothers and sisters it's
[1:27:38] wrong it's
[1:27:41] wrong he says if you know what it is
[1:27:44] unless you believe it's given to you and
[1:27:47] it's for you and then you cannot know
[1:27:49] whether you've got it or not unless you
[1:27:51] know what results it
[1:27:53] brings and this is where it's so
[1:27:56] treacherous we can have a pastor that
[1:27:58] would say oh my I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:28:02] yes
[1:28:03] sir but I go and do this and I go and do
[1:28:07] that and I go and do the other thing and
[1:28:09] those things maybe most of them are
[1:28:11] completely in line with the word of God
[1:28:13] except for one thing I say Lord help me
[1:28:15] brothers and sisters cuz I don't ever
[1:28:16] want to actually behave that way but if
[1:28:19] I do I send the wrong message to someone
[1:28:22] someone's going to say look that's what
[1:28:23] the Holy Ghost
[1:28:25] is and how many people have done that
[1:28:28] how many people have actually been spun
[1:28:30] as charlatans because that's what they
[1:28:32] do they misrepresent the word of God and
[1:28:35] that's why I just go back to what my
[1:28:37] fundamental teaching was from my pastor
[1:28:39] when I grew up in the message of the
[1:28:41] hour he said you have to take it back to
[1:28:43] the word it's your responsibility to
[1:28:46] know what the word of God says because
[1:28:48] if a pastor if an angel or any other
[1:28:50] creature says anything outside of what's
[1:28:53] already been said then let them be a
[1:28:54] cursed but how will you ever know if you
[1:28:56] don't know the
[1:29:00] word that's why get the Holy Ghost
[1:29:03] because he the spirit of Truth Jesus
[1:29:06] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:29:07] forever he will lead you and guide you
[1:29:09] into all
[1:29:10] truth and then brothers and sisters when
[1:29:13] brother Barry or any other minister
[1:29:15] comes and bring something wrong then
[1:29:18] you're obligated to go to
[1:29:20] him not to kick
[1:29:23] him not to kick him but to say brother
[1:29:27] this is what I see and this is what the
[1:29:28] word says it just I'm having trouble
[1:29:31] lining it up can you help me but you
[1:29:34] know it's not just with the pastor it's
[1:29:35] with anyone amen with
[1:29:38] anyone we need to be our Brother's
[1:29:40] Keeper in fact we don't just need to be
[1:29:42] we are our Brother's Keeper we went over
[1:29:45] that a little while ago brothers and
[1:29:46] sisters Cain Cain nature says NOP I
[1:29:50] Ain't My Brother's Keeper my brother
[1:29:51] it's not my problem I've got enough
[1:29:53] problems in my life let him figure it
[1:29:55] out on his
[1:29:57] own that's not the nature of our
[1:30:00] daddy amen so if you know what it is and
[1:30:05] who it's to and what action it brings
[1:30:08] when it comes then you'll know what
[1:30:11] you've got when you get it
[1:30:14] see that would just settle it I think
[1:30:18] it's so beautiful when I heard these
[1:30:20] words when I saw that I was like yes
[1:30:22] amen thank you Lord I love when he gives
[1:30:25] me a direction to go cuz many times you
[1:30:28] have to wonder but I just think it's
[1:30:30] beautiful you know brother bradam he
[1:30:32] goes on to say talking about the
[1:30:34] circumcision this is verse eight of Acts
[1:30:38] chapter
[1:30:40] 7 the circumcision is a type of the Holy
[1:30:45] Ghost it's a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:48] verse eight of Acts chapter 7 I'll just
[1:30:50] read it again and he gave him the
[1:30:52] Covenant of circumcision so Abraham
[1:30:55] begat Isaac and circumcised him the
[1:30:57] Eighth Day and Isaac begat Jacob and
[1:31:00] Jacob begat the 12 Patriarchs all of
[1:31:03] them followed the instruction that was
[1:31:06] given to Abraham by the
[1:31:08] Lord Brother Brad I'm reading here this
[1:31:10] in in this message uh what is the Holy
[1:31:13] Ghost the circumcision is a type of the
[1:31:15] Holy Ghost and God gave Abraham the
[1:31:18] circumcision sign after he had accepted
[1:31:22] God on his promise and walked out into a
[1:31:25] strange country see it was a
[1:31:30] sign and all his children and his seed
[1:31:33] after him should have this sign in their
[1:31:36] flesh because it was a
[1:31:38] distinction it was to separate them from
[1:31:41] all other people's this sign of
[1:31:46] circumcision that's the
[1:31:48] natural now brother Bram he steps into
[1:31:51] the next Realm and he says and that's
[1:31:53] what God uses
[1:31:55] today he's not talking about natural now
[1:31:58] he's going spiritual and that's what God
[1:32:01] uses today it's the sign of circumcision
[1:32:05] of the heart the Holy Spirit cutting
[1:32:09] away all of the old dead flesh getting
[1:32:12] rid of all of the old man getting rid of
[1:32:16] all of the old tradition getting rid of
[1:32:18] all of the old thinking getting rid of
[1:32:20] all of that
[1:32:22] so that you can just have a clean pure
[1:32:24] heart before
[1:32:26] God it's the sign of circumcision of the
[1:32:29] heart the holy spirit that makes God's
[1:32:32] Church a separated Church from all other
[1:32:36] Creeds faiths and
[1:32:40] denominations they're in all kinds of
[1:32:42] denominations but yet they are a
[1:32:44] separated
[1:32:46] people isn't that beautiful when you
[1:32:48] hear them say that you don't want to
[1:32:50] look at someone in the Alliance Church
[1:32:51] church and say that you're Canon
[1:32:54] F prophet of God said there's Believers
[1:32:57] in every denomination brothers and
[1:32:59] sisters this is God's program and you
[1:33:02] know there's the we talked about it the
[1:33:04] 10 virgins they're all virgins they all
[1:33:07] had oil they all slept and slumbered
[1:33:10] they all were together weren't they but
[1:33:13] only one of them had oil enough oil to
[1:33:16] see them through and we've said it and
[1:33:17] said it and said it that's why we keep
[1:33:19] coming to church so that we can lift our
[1:33:21] cup and say Lord fill me up not just
[1:33:23] according to a denominational Creed
[1:33:25] according to the message of the hour
[1:33:26] that was delivered by a Vindicated
[1:33:28] Prophet to this age just like he sent
[1:33:32] the Vindicated prophets to the people in
[1:33:34] the other ages amen get back in line
[1:33:36] with the word of God get back in line
[1:33:39] with the word of God just repent and get
[1:33:40] back in line with the word of God and
[1:33:42] God will bless you and the blessing that
[1:33:44] we're looking for today brothers and
[1:33:46] sisters is not only just a provision for
[1:33:47] our families and a place to worship God
[1:33:50] but to get a body ch change that's our
[1:33:53] ultimate goal it's not to get comfy
[1:33:57] here there are all kinds of
[1:33:59] denominations but yet they are a
[1:34:01] separated people you let me talk to a
[1:34:04] man two minutes I can tell you whether
[1:34:07] he's received the Holy Ghost or not so
[1:34:10] can
[1:34:12] you so can you it separates them it's a
[1:34:16] Mark it's a sign and the Holy Spirit is
[1:34:19] a sign
[1:34:25] remember it's revealed by the spirit
[1:34:28] revealed by a spirit I trust that it's
[1:34:30] the spirit is going to be confirmed by
[1:34:33] the
[1:34:34] word we can have the revelation we can
[1:34:37] confirm it by the word everyone can do
[1:34:39] that that's not exclusive to anyone but
[1:34:42] can we live the life can it make
[1:34:45] manifest in our lives do our families
[1:34:48] see it do they experience it being
[1:34:50] manifest in our lives does the church
[1:34:52] body collectively see it manifest in our
[1:34:55] lives do our co-workers see it manifest
[1:34:57] in our lives do our bosses see it
[1:35:00] manifest in our lives do our school Pals
[1:35:05] see it manifest in our lives you know
[1:35:08] brothers and sisters I think if there's
[1:35:09] ever something that we need to do today
[1:35:11] it's remember the children Amen in our
[1:35:14] congregation remember the children of
[1:35:16] Believers around the world in this age
[1:35:18] that we live in I don't think it's ever
[1:35:20] been so treacherous I don't think it's
[1:35:22] ever had so much pressure I don't think
[1:35:24] it's ever been so demonic where where we
[1:35:27] don't even have a say for the teachers
[1:35:29] to be able to be instructing our
[1:35:30] children that they can have a different
[1:35:32] gender what kind of a Satan's Eden is
[1:35:36] this we need to pray for our children
[1:35:39] and we are our brothers and sisters
[1:35:41] children's
[1:35:44] Keepers it's not just us exclusive
[1:35:46] brothers and sisters our family's
[1:35:48] perfect we pray for our family what
[1:35:51] about the other
[1:35:53] families you know there's many gifts in
[1:35:55] the body some are Prayer Warriors and
[1:35:57] some aren't some people have the ability
[1:36:00] to earn a lot of money and to be able to
[1:36:03] help people financially some people have
[1:36:05] the ability to perceive things to see
[1:36:07] things that other people can't see right
[1:36:10] there's many gifts in the body
[1:36:13] right I think it's so beautiful we've
[1:36:15] been given the ability to have this sign
[1:36:17] in our lives you know the children of
[1:36:20] Israel brothers and sisters we studyed
[1:36:21] with the Book of Joshua when we went
[1:36:22] over that how the children of Israel
[1:36:25] they had been delivered out of bondage
[1:36:27] there was this promise that was given to
[1:36:29] Abraham and to his seed and this is what
[1:36:31] we read out of the book of Acts how
[1:36:32] Abram when his name wasn't even changed
[1:36:34] to Abraham yet he was Abram and he lived
[1:36:37] in the land of the Chaldeans and what
[1:36:39] did he do he heard the voice of God as
[1:36:41] someone who was a gentile he wasn't even
[1:36:44] a Jew he wasn't
[1:36:45] Hebrew he was a gentile but he was
[1:36:48] called out from his Kindred and God
[1:36:51] spoke to him and said you know what
[1:36:52] you're going to be the father of many
[1:36:54] nations I want you to follow my
[1:36:57] instruction and we know that he had a
[1:36:59] journey that he went on he got away from
[1:37:01] all of his teachings his family his
[1:37:03] Traditions all of that stuff God called
[1:37:05] him out away from everything that he was
[1:37:08] used to and even though when he went he
[1:37:11] brought his nephew with him God didn't
[1:37:13] want his nephew to come with him but his
[1:37:15] nephew came with him anyways and we know
[1:37:17] that as long as his nephew was with him
[1:37:19] there was Strife in the camp wasn't
[1:37:20] there there there was problems there was
[1:37:22] issues there was politics in the church
[1:37:25] wasn't there there was all these
[1:37:27] different things going on and what
[1:37:28] happened was they had to go their
[1:37:30] separate ways and we know that Abraham
[1:37:33] being the the Son of God in his position
[1:37:36] he knew where he stood God D dealt with
[1:37:38] him he heard the the voice of God God
[1:37:40] dwelt with him as a
[1:37:42] friend what did he say he said you know
[1:37:44] what lot just go and pick whatever
[1:37:46] Direction you want to go just pick
[1:37:47] whatever you want in the L wherever you
[1:37:49] want to go you can take all of the
[1:37:51] pastures you can have it all wherever
[1:37:53] you go we'll just go the opposite
[1:37:55] direction and we'll be brothers it's
[1:37:57] okay don't worry about it I know that
[1:37:59] God's going to look after both of us
[1:38:01] just pick whatever way you want and we
[1:38:03] know that lot he couldn't help himself
[1:38:06] he was attracted to the worldly riches
[1:38:08] he was attracted to Sodom he was
[1:38:10] attracted to the nature of things and we
[1:38:11] know the Bible doesn't say that he ran
[1:38:13] right down into Sodom and bought a house
[1:38:15] and actually pitched out his flag put
[1:38:17] out a shingle and said the mayor is here
[1:38:19] that's not what happened he pitched his
[1:38:21] tent toward Sodom brothers and sisters
[1:38:24] watch what you look at because he looked
[1:38:27] at Sodom he began to desire it that's he
[1:38:31] pitched his tent towards Sodom don't
[1:38:34] pitch your tent towards Sodom pitch it
[1:38:36] towards
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:40] Christ but he was on his journey
[1:38:43] Abraham and we know that he went out and
[1:38:46] as he was on his
[1:38:48] journey he actually came came to a place
[1:38:52] where God met him and dwelt with him in
[1:38:55] the plains of
[1:38:56] mamry and we know that he had the
[1:38:58] ability to see God he was able to call
[1:39:01] him Lord this is all stuff I know we're
[1:39:05] familiar with but this this man was the
[1:39:08] the father of many nations and we know
[1:39:10] this promise that was given to him it
[1:39:12] was to his seed it wasn't his seed it
[1:39:16] wasn't all the difference in Allin
[1:39:17] Nations it was his seed and we know that
[1:39:19] there is the Hebrew seed there is the
[1:39:21] Hebrew seed but there's also the Gentile
[1:39:23] seed there is the natural and there is
[1:39:25] the spiritual there's the Royal Seed of
[1:39:28] Abraham which I'm speaking to today I
[1:39:31] think it's so beautiful brothers and
[1:39:32] sisters and that's really where we want
[1:39:34] to get to as the children of Israel they
[1:39:36] went into bondage according to the
[1:39:37] scripture according to the Judgment of
[1:39:39] the Lord they went into bondage hard
[1:39:41] bondage in Egypt 430 years of bondage
[1:39:44] then they came out God LED them out he
[1:39:46] sent them a deliverer because they began
[1:39:48] to cry and when they began to cry the
[1:39:50] deliverer came brought them out many
[1:39:52] signs Miracles and wonders happened in
[1:39:55] Egypt we're very familiar with that what
[1:39:57] I want to get to though brothers and
[1:39:58] sisters there came a day where they went
[1:40:00] through the camp and they said get ready
[1:40:02] because the priests the Levites are
[1:40:04] going to take the word they're going to
[1:40:05] take that Ark and they're going to cross
[1:40:07] over
[1:40:09] Jordan and we know that they did they
[1:40:13] crossed over Jordan they died out to
[1:40:15] themselves Crossing Jordan is death it's
[1:40:18] a type of death and they crossed over
[1:40:21] from their old selves into their new
[1:40:23] selves and even though some of their
[1:40:25] selves wanted to stay back in the old
[1:40:28] land they were pretty content there and
[1:40:30] that's the way it's going to be it just
[1:40:31] is some people are just going to be
[1:40:33] content with the life they've got and
[1:40:35] and you know what there's nothing we can
[1:40:36] do about that we can pray for people and
[1:40:38] encourage people but keep marching
[1:40:40] brothers and sisters don't keep your
[1:40:41] eyes on the people keep your eyes on
[1:40:44] that Ark because you have to keep at a
[1:40:46] certain distance in front of you because
[1:40:48] where we're at today nobody has gone
[1:40:49] this way before but what happened
[1:40:51] brothers and sisters what I want to get
[1:40:52] to what happened when they got to the
[1:40:54] other side there was many great
[1:40:56] victories that had to happen wasn't
[1:40:57] there tremendous victories but God said
[1:41:00] you know what Joshua things have got a
[1:41:01] little slack around here things have
[1:41:03] gotten down just a little bit off the
[1:41:06] Mark we're not quite living to the bar
[1:41:08] that I set long ago according to the
[1:41:10] laws and what I want you to do is go
[1:41:13] through the camp and circumcise every
[1:41:15] single male that is not circumcised they
[1:41:18] have got to get in line with this word
[1:41:20] if you want go forwards and see success
[1:41:22] in your life you have to follow the word
[1:41:24] of God to the letter and if you're not
[1:41:26] willing to do that you're not going to
[1:41:28] have
[1:41:30] success so everyone followed the word of
[1:41:33] the Lord that day we know that happened
[1:41:36] they went through and they got
[1:41:37] circumcised all of them now maybe this
[1:41:39] is a weird conversation and I don't mean
[1:41:41] it to be it's the word of God brothers
[1:41:43] and sisters we're talking about
[1:41:45] spiritual circumcision here circumcising
[1:41:47] the heart getting rid of all the
[1:41:48] traditions and saying this is the way of
[1:41:50] always done it if that's what you've
[1:41:52] always done then look what you've got
[1:41:53] right now because that's all you're
[1:41:55] going to get if you keep doing that but
[1:41:57] if you want to look at the Ark of the
[1:41:58] Lord if you want to pitch your tent
[1:42:00] towards heaven you will see different
[1:42:04] results but if you're just content on
[1:42:06] this side then hey that's fine it's okay
[1:42:10] there's no
[1:42:12] pressure we just want to see everyone go
[1:42:14] brother bradam said I want to take as
[1:42:16] many people with me as I can don't
[1:42:19] you amen amen
[1:42:23] amen they had to follow the word of the
[1:42:25] Lord they had to brush up on everything
[1:42:27] that was going on they had to go through
[1:42:29] their camp and their lives and take
[1:42:31] inventory they had to get right with God
[1:42:34] and it's the same thing for us today
[1:42:35] brothers and sisters I believe he's
[1:42:37] calling us to a higher walk with him
[1:42:39] every one of us and as we go forwards as
[1:42:42] we're willing to take him at his word
[1:42:44] that's why we gather that's why we come
[1:42:46] to church so that we can get Washed by
[1:42:48] the Water of the word amen sometimes our
[1:42:51] lives get a little cloudy sometimes our
[1:42:53] lamps get a little smoky on the inside
[1:42:54] we just need to polish the inside trim
[1:42:57] our lamps get some oil make sure that
[1:42:59] flame is burning bright and
[1:43:02] clear show the world we've got the Holy
[1:43:06] Ghost someone spits in our face we can
[1:43:09] just simply say you know what don't
[1:43:11] worry about it God told him to do that
[1:43:14] because God wanted to prove that I
[1:43:16] wouldn't do anything to them I wouldn't
[1:43:18] retaliate I would be just like Jesus
[1:43:20] Jesus when the high priest smoked me on
[1:43:22] the
[1:43:24] face just like Micaiah was when the high
[1:43:28] priest SME him on the face the god
[1:43:31] Prophet hit him in the face and said
[1:43:34] which way did the spirit of God go
[1:43:37] now sometimes we need those in our lives
[1:43:40] that's right because what they do is
[1:43:42] they prove not just to everyone else but
[1:43:44] they prove to
[1:43:46] us did I just do that how could I have
[1:43:49] behaved that way that's not me I would
[1:43:51] never do that man that guy would have a
[1:43:54] fat nose and a and a and a busted eye he
[1:43:58] might even be spitting out a tooth or
[1:44:02] something you know what I mean human
[1:44:05] nature yes we're talking way past human
[1:44:08] nature brothers and sisters we're not
[1:44:10] talking circumcision In the Flesh we're
[1:44:11] talking circumcision in the mind
[1:44:13] circumcision in the heart circumcision
[1:44:17] of of the the life of of the Our Lives
[1:44:19] that we have not having any of the old
[1:44:22] man alive out of what is the Holy Ghost
[1:44:24] paragraph 47 I'm going to have to get a
[1:44:28] little bit hard on this now lay
[1:44:32] down he says now you legalist Brethren
[1:44:35] just hold quiet for a little bit
[1:44:38] see did you notice how long that seal
[1:44:43] lasts the Seal of the Holy
[1:44:46] Ghost not till next Revival until next
[1:44:49] time something goes wrong until the day
[1:44:51] of your
[1:44:54] Redemption that's how long you're sealed
[1:44:57] brothers and sisters as someone who
[1:44:59] finds himself in this office of a pastor
[1:45:02] that's my desire is that we could get
[1:45:04] ourselves into that position where we
[1:45:06] recognize that we're sealed until the
[1:45:09] day of our Redemption and that if other
[1:45:11] people get to that place in their
[1:45:13] spiritual walk they are sealed until the
[1:45:15] day of their
[1:45:16] Redemption we're not up and down in and
[1:45:19] out all around that's works that's the
[1:45:23] legalistic Brethren that he said just
[1:45:24] sit back for a second and let me speak
[1:45:27] as a dispensational prophet I've got
[1:45:28] some words for you to hear you know some
[1:45:31] people might say now brother Barry this
[1:45:32] is only 1957 or whenever this is it's
[1:45:35] before the seals so it couldn't be
[1:45:37] completely anointed I want to say this
[1:45:39] brothers and sisters if you ever get the
[1:45:40] Holy Ghost in your life and you go back
[1:45:42] and you start listening to those old
[1:45:44] messages you can see very clearly this
[1:45:46] dispensational Prophet was preaching the
[1:45:48] same message from the very beginning
[1:45:50] beginning all the way up to the end
[1:45:52] there's only a couple things that
[1:45:53] changed but it wasn't his Doctrine he's
[1:45:56] preaching the message of the hour right
[1:45:58] from the very beginning you're sealed
[1:46:01] until the day of your Redemption when
[1:46:03] you are redeemed up to be with God
[1:46:07] that's how long the Holy Spirit seals
[1:46:10] you not from revival to Revival not from
[1:46:14] camp meeting to camp meeting not from
[1:46:16] service to service till your day of
[1:46:19] redemption amen
[1:46:21] amen but from eternity to Eternity oh
[1:46:25] my you are sealed by the Holy
[1:46:29] Spirit that's what the holy spirit is
[1:46:33] the Seal of God that he's found you
[1:46:37] found Grace in his
[1:46:40] sight and you know brothers and sisters
[1:46:42] we're going to drill down on this one
[1:46:44] for a little bit we're going to hit on
[1:46:46] this for a little bit isn't it beautiful
[1:46:48] that's what the holy spirit is it's the
[1:46:50] the Seal of God that he's found you
[1:46:52] found Grace in his
[1:46:55] sight when did you find Grace in his
[1:46:58] sight now we're not talking about sister
[1:47:00] Grace
[1:47:02] here we're talking about Grace in
[1:47:04] general when did you find Grace in his
[1:47:05] sight brothers and
[1:47:07] sisters was it when you got
[1:47:10] saved was it some place when maybe you
[1:47:14] shouldn't have
[1:47:16] been before the foundation of the
[1:47:18] world that's what you found Grace amen
[1:47:22] that's when he chose you that's when he
[1:47:25] sealed
[1:47:26] you there just comes a point in time
[1:47:29] where we recognize it brothers and
[1:47:31] sisters and when we recognize it we do
[1:47:35] exactly what Jesus said when he went to
[1:47:36] John that day in the river and he said
[1:47:38] you
[1:47:39] know it behooves us to fulfill all
[1:47:41] scripture doesn't it and John says hey
[1:47:43] man I I'm just a mortal I know who you
[1:47:46] are I want you to baptize me and he said
[1:47:49] John no we need to wash the sacrifice
[1:47:51] has to be washed before it can go up you
[1:47:53] know the scripture when we recognize who
[1:47:57] we are brothers and sisters we come
[1:47:58] subject to this word right now just so
[1:48:01] quick nothing wants to change in our
[1:48:03] life we just want to say whatever it is
[1:48:04] the Lord wants from from out of my life
[1:48:07] that's what I want to do I just want to
[1:48:08] do anything that he wants me to do and
[1:48:10] you know when we get to that place
[1:48:11] brothers and sisters it gets a bit crazy
[1:48:13] that's where it gets to be fundamental
[1:48:15] but I want to say if you've ever gone
[1:48:17] there you know exactly what I'm talking
[1:48:19] about if you've never gone there I want
[1:48:22] to challenge you to go there say Lord
[1:48:24] what do you want for me in my
[1:48:26] life what would you
[1:48:28] change what is the inventory in my life
[1:48:31] o open up all the cupboard doors open up
[1:48:34] all the doors Under the Stairs open up
[1:48:36] all of the hidey spots that we've got go
[1:48:39] into the safe dig into that safe open
[1:48:42] that big heavy safe door the place that
[1:48:44] nobody goes into except for you and then
[1:48:46] go into that other secret little
[1:48:48] compartment inside the safe that nobody
[1:48:50] sees you open nobody take him there and
[1:48:54] ask him Lord is there anything in here
[1:48:57] that you want changed in my life because
[1:48:59] if there is I want you to do it I want
[1:49:02] you to give me the strength to do it and
[1:49:04] I know brothers and sisters if you could
[1:49:05] ever say those words I promise you one
[1:49:07] thing he's already given you the
[1:49:09] strength to do it or you would never say
[1:49:11] those
[1:49:13] words that's what the holy spirit is
[1:49:15] it's the Seal of God that he's found you
[1:49:18] found Grace in his sight
[1:49:20] and he loves you and he believes you and
[1:49:24] he put his seal upon
[1:49:26] you what is a seal anyone why a seal
[1:49:29] designates or means a finished work amen
[1:49:33] God has saved you Sanctified you cleaned
[1:49:35] you up you found cleaned you up found
[1:49:38] favor with you and sealed you he's
[1:49:41] finished you're his product until the
[1:49:44] day of your
[1:49:45] Redemption a seal is a finished
[1:49:48] thing remember a servant or two ago we
[1:49:51] talked about the Box Car how the
[1:49:53] inspector comes around and Shakes the
[1:49:55] Box Car opens the door and takes a look
[1:49:58] inside to see what's going on those are
[1:50:00] all Goods that have to make it to their
[1:50:02] destination and they will make it to
[1:50:04] their destination and if the person who
[1:50:05] is in charge of that box car at that
[1:50:07] time doesn't do their job they'll be
[1:50:09] removed and someone else will be put
[1:50:10] there because that box car is going to
[1:50:12] make it to its destination it's going to
[1:50:15] happen and you know that that inspector
[1:50:18] can't put his seal on that door
[1:50:20] until that box car is actually packed
[1:50:23] properly right once that seal is on it
[1:50:26] ain't coming off until that box car
[1:50:28] makes it to its destination and you know
[1:50:31] spiritually speaking there's no man that
[1:50:34] can remove that seal there's no devil
[1:50:37] that can remove that seal I would throw
[1:50:40] this out there and I maybe I don't know
[1:50:43] sometimes maybe I wonder but you know
[1:50:45] you got to go with the anointing I want
[1:50:46] to say it this way brothers and sisters
[1:50:48] how many of us could be offended so
[1:50:49] offended that we would just leave this
[1:50:52] church any one of us I want to say if
[1:50:56] that's the case then I wonder if you got
[1:50:57] that seal yet right because you've been
[1:51:00] sealed till the day of your Redemption
[1:51:01] haven't you what could any man do that
[1:51:04] would stop you from coming to
[1:51:09] church now I know it's going a bit
[1:51:14] far you know brothers and sisters we're
[1:51:16] in an age where we need to go far right
[1:51:19] cuz no no's ever been here before right
[1:51:22] right no one has and Satan is doing
[1:51:25] everything that he can to try and
[1:51:26] discount the word of God trying to
[1:51:29] discredit the word of God and he'll take
[1:51:31] every single tool that he has in his
[1:51:33] toolbox which are human beings and try
[1:51:35] and get someone offended try and get him
[1:51:37] in a flap try and say that this happened
[1:51:39] or that happened or this didn't and that
[1:51:41] didn't whatever whatever whatever
[1:51:43] whatever just to upset people and you
[1:51:45] know it's
[1:51:46] Devils it's Devils if we're all sealed
[1:51:49] until the day of our Redemption then
[1:51:51] what have we got to worry about what do
[1:51:53] we have to fuss about brothers and
[1:51:57] sisters maybe I'm a bit crazy but uhuh
[1:52:00] leave me alone I like it this
[1:52:02] way brother bam out of what is the Holy
[1:52:04] Ghost he says what is the Holy Ghost and
[1:52:08] as we go forwards I got lots of quotes
[1:52:10] this morning I'm sure that you will see
[1:52:12] the theme what is the Holy Ghost is what
[1:52:15] I typed in what is the Holy Ghost you
[1:52:17] could go and look for yourself and some
[1:52:19] of them I didn't bring because I just
[1:52:20] for time sake I knew it was so many I've
[1:52:22] got probably 20 and I think I'm three in
[1:52:25] and I can't believe the time what is the
[1:52:28] Holy Ghost he says it's a sign we're
[1:52:31] going to get on that a little later on
[1:52:34] in another message the sign that Paul
[1:52:37] spoke of tongues was a sign to Believers
[1:52:40] or
[1:52:41] unbelievers now brothers and sisters
[1:52:43] speaking about that specifically tongues
[1:52:46] turn with me over to 1 Corinthians
[1:52:47] chapter
[1:52:48] 12
[1:52:54] I just want
[1:52:56] to really not rush this I I really want
[1:53:00] to just take some time and talk about
[1:53:02] what is the Holy Ghost because many
[1:53:04] times we can have an idea of what the
[1:53:06] Holy Ghost is a and what the Holy Ghost
[1:53:08] should be potentially and what the Holy
[1:53:11] Ghost
[1:53:12] was but who is the Holy Ghost remember
[1:53:15] that's where I want to go with this who
[1:53:17] is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[1:53:18] Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is Jesus
[1:53:21] Christ Spirit back in the
[1:53:24] unbeliever because we know that there's
[1:53:26] spirits but you can't just see a spirit
[1:53:27] in the air can you can you see a spirit
[1:53:31] sometimes people see ghosts but we don't
[1:53:32] just see the Holy Spirit what we see is
[1:53:35] the spirit inside of a human being
[1:53:38] that's where the holy Bo Holy Ghost
[1:53:41] manifests but remember revealed by the
[1:53:45] spirit confirmed by the
[1:53:48] word made manifest by the results that
[1:53:50] it
[1:53:51] Bears that's exactly out of the
[1:53:53] exposition of the seven Church ages 1
[1:53:55] Corinthians
[1:54:01] 12:7 but the manifestation of the spirit
[1:54:05] not just the spirit this is the holy
[1:54:08] spirit we're talking about the
[1:54:09] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[1:54:12] every man to profit with all for one is
[1:54:15] given by the spirit the word of wisdom
[1:54:21] to
[1:54:22] another the word of
[1:54:26] knowledge by the same spirit
[1:54:29] amen as we talk about this remember I am
[1:54:32] the vine ye are the
[1:54:36] branches and the branches that put forth
[1:54:39] fruit are the ones that he
[1:54:43] purges for to one is given by the spirit
[1:54:46] the word of wisdom to another the word
[1:54:48] of knowledge by the The Same Spirit to
[1:54:50] another Faith by The Same Spirit to
[1:54:54] another Gifts of healing by The Same
[1:54:57] Spirit to another the working of
[1:55:01] Miracles to another prophecy to another
[1:55:06] Discerning of spirits to another diverse
[1:55:10] kinds of tongues to another the
[1:55:13] interpretation of
[1:55:15] tongues this brothers and sisters is the
[1:55:17] manifestation of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:20] in his
[1:55:21] church it's not just a speaking in
[1:55:23] tongues it's not just
[1:55:27] healing right so because you don't speak
[1:55:30] in tongues doesn't mean you don't have
[1:55:31] the Holy Ghost in your life because you
[1:55:34] can't lay hands on someone and see them
[1:55:36] get healed at your whim doesn't mean you
[1:55:38] don't have the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:55:40] you might have the gift of discernment
[1:55:42] that's right you might have the gift of
[1:55:46] wisdom you might have the gift of
[1:55:48] working miracles
[1:55:51] now let's just pause there for a second
[1:55:53] this one really was getting me excited
[1:55:55] when I was thinking about it I I don't
[1:55:56] think that I'm there but I just couldn't
[1:55:58] help but think about brothers and
[1:55:59] sisters sometimes the manifestation of
[1:56:02] the spoken word takes place doesn't it
[1:56:05] right did you ever say something and
[1:56:07] then see it come to
[1:56:09] pass did you ever wish something for
[1:56:12] someone and then watch it actually take
[1:56:15] place and I'm talking good not bad
[1:56:18] that's the carnal nature that's the old
[1:56:20] man that's already circumcised he's gone
[1:56:22] dead don't even go there what I'm
[1:56:24] talking about is wishing good upon
[1:56:26] someone and actually seeing something
[1:56:28] happen some people have the gift of
[1:56:31] working miracles and that's not just
[1:56:33] healing maybe it's for someone to
[1:56:36] actually get a mortgage on a house when
[1:56:37] they should never get a mortgage they
[1:56:38] should never be able to qualify to get a
[1:56:40] mortgage maybe it's for someone to
[1:56:42] actually immigrate when all of the odds
[1:56:44] are actually stacked against them maybe
[1:56:46] it's for someone to have a baby when the
[1:56:48] doctors say you're just never going to
[1:56:49] have a baby but you know what when
[1:56:52] there's the gift of working
[1:56:53] miracles speak the word brothers and
[1:56:55] sisters and just watch God back it up is
[1:56:58] what the prophet said but to another the
[1:57:00] working of Miracles to another prophecy
[1:57:03] to another Discerning of spirits the
[1:57:05] word of God says to discern the Spirits
[1:57:07] by the way try the spirits and see if
[1:57:10] they're of God how do you know it'll be
[1:57:12] revealed by the
[1:57:14] spirit right confirmed by the word and
[1:57:18] the life that's lived will bear
[1:57:20] representation of what Spirit it is that
[1:57:22] actually gave that so we have wisdom
[1:57:24] knowledge Faith healing Miracles
[1:57:26] prophecy Discerning of spirits and
[1:57:31] tongues I think it's a beautiful thing
[1:57:34] the gifts of the Spirit excuse
[1:57:36] me we have the ability to see these
[1:57:39] things in our
[1:57:41] lives not because we want to show God's
[1:57:44] not going to clown for
[1:57:46] nobody this is a very special thing
[1:57:50] for a very special
[1:57:51] lady the truly elected bride of Jesus
[1:57:55] Christ she's going to say I can't do any
[1:57:58] of this I can't do none of it but he
[1:58:03] can and as soon as she does that and
[1:58:06] gets out of the way then he'll say oh my
[1:58:09] my darling H I'm here for you baby I'm
[1:58:12] going to get you you speak the word and
[1:58:14] I'll make it happen because my desire is
[1:58:17] to make you happy Hallelujah just like
[1:58:19] it is for a husband on Earth for his
[1:58:26] wife it's no different we know that in
[1:58:29] Ephesians Paul said it I speak
[1:58:30] concerning the husband and the wife but
[1:58:32] you know what I'm actually speaking a
[1:58:33] great mystery between Christ and his
[1:58:36] church so the relationship we have with
[1:58:38] our wives husbands is a direct
[1:58:40] reflection I'm going to keep saying this
[1:58:41] over and over because it's that
[1:58:42] important it's a direct reflection of
[1:58:44] our relationship with our heavenly
[1:58:46] father amen don't think for a second
[1:58:48] that we can be out of life with our
[1:58:50] marriage with our lives with our wives
[1:58:52] and yet be completely revelated and in
[1:58:55] in perfect standing with God and the
[1:58:57] Holy Spirit In Our Lives if we think
[1:58:59] that's the case what's happening is
[1:59:01] there is a spirit that's revealing
[1:59:03] things to us but it ain't the right
[1:59:05] spirit because the right spirit's going
[1:59:07] to be completely in line with the word
[1:59:09] of
[1:59:10] godall doesn't matter how many quotes we
[1:59:13] know about the message of the hour
[1:59:14] doesn't matter how well we pray doesn't
[1:59:17] matter how much we know the scripture
[1:59:19] Our Lives bear manifestation of the
[1:59:22] fruits of the
[1:59:23] spirit and I'm going to say this I'm
[1:59:25] going to correct myself the fruit of the
[1:59:28] spirit but doesn't it sound familiar
[1:59:30] while I was studying this I was thinking
[1:59:32] doesn't it sound like Faith virtue
[1:59:33] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[1:59:35] brotherly kindness and what charity the
[1:59:39] Holy Ghost yes kind of
[1:59:44] similar 1 Peter 1:5 says and beside this
[1:59:48] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:59:50] virtue and virtue knowledge and
[1:59:52] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[1:59:54] patience and to patience godliness and
[1:59:56] to Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:59:58] brotherly kindness
[2:00:01] charity need to make sure that we see
[2:00:03] these things in our lives brothers and
[2:00:05] sisters there's a reason for it if we
[2:00:08] read a little bit further verse 8 says
[2:00:09] for if these things be in you and abound
[2:00:12] they make you that ye shall neither be
[2:00:15] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[2:00:18] of Our Lord Jesus
[2:00:20] Christ and it's not just about knowledge
[2:00:23] it's not just about knowing the word of
[2:00:25] God and knowing the quotes of the
[2:00:26] message of the hour and knowing having
[2:00:29] this knowledge in our heads it's about
[2:00:31] actually having it in our hearts
[2:00:32] brothers and sisters making that longest
[2:00:34] journey of Our Lives going the 18 inches
[2:00:36] down into our very beings what it will
[2:00:38] do is cause us to live it now as we live
[2:00:42] it we will see these things and that
[2:00:45] knowledge is of our Lord Jesus Christ he
[2:00:48] the spirit of Truth manifesting through
[2:00:50] our
[2:00:51] lives verse n says but he that lath
[2:00:54] these things is
[2:00:56] blind and cannot see a far off and hath
[2:01:00] forgotten that he was purged from his
[2:01:02] old sins a perfect identification of the
[2:01:05] legalist right remember brother bradam
[2:01:08] said he told those guys just hold on a
[2:01:09] second just take a seat and just relax
[2:01:12] we're going to talk about this for a
[2:01:13] little bit the the Holy Ghost but
[2:01:15] sometimes we can get so caught up in how
[2:01:16] good we are we forget about our old sins
[2:01:19] goodness sakes but for the grace of God
[2:01:21] brothers and sisters there go I we'd be
[2:01:23] right out there with those rank Sinners
[2:01:25] or we'd be right up there with those
[2:01:27] religious ones right you know what we
[2:01:30] want to do is be right down the middle
[2:01:32] we want to have that Holy Ghost living
[2:01:33] out through us and he's not going to say
[2:01:35] anything out of turn with the word of
[2:01:37] God but he that lath these things is
[2:01:39] blind and cannot see a far off and hath
[2:01:41] forgotten that he was purged from his
[2:01:42] old sins wherefore rather Brethren give
[2:01:46] diligence to make your calling an
[2:01:48] election
[2:01:51] sure we say that many times we need to
[2:01:53] give diligence to make our calling
[2:01:54] election sure why for if you do these
[2:01:57] things ye shall never
[2:02:00] fall why because you're
[2:02:03] sealed you're sealed brothers and
[2:02:05] sisters by the Holy Spirit of
[2:02:08] Promise he does the work he seals us
[2:02:13] he's the one that takes us from our old
[2:02:15] life our old sins our old transgressions
[2:02:18] and brings us into the congregation of
[2:02:21] the
[2:02:22] firstborn but our lives speak it
[2:02:24] brothers and sisters we've said it I'm
[2:02:26] going to keep saying it it's got to be
[2:02:27] revealed by the spirit it's got to be
[2:02:28] confirmed by the word but it's got to be
[2:02:30] manifest by the results that it
[2:02:33] bears and you know there's something
[2:02:35] wrong if it can't manifest according to
[2:02:37] the first two if it's manifesting
[2:02:40] something that's different than those
[2:02:41] then we just need to get back to Calvary
[2:02:43] we just need to get back to Christ maybe
[2:02:45] we've just forgotten that we had old
[2:02:46] sins sometimes it happens sometimes we
[2:02:48] get an illness sometimes we'll say
[2:02:50] something about someone sometimes we'll
[2:02:52] start to look at someone a certain way
[2:02:54] sometimes we'll just start to act a
[2:02:55] certain way alls we need to do is just
[2:02:58] conduct ourselves according to the word
[2:02:59] of God Amen Our Lives speak volumes
[2:03:03] brothers and sisters we can say all we
[2:03:04] want but the life that we live says it
[2:03:08] all you know he goes on in uh in our
[2:03:11] scripture this morning out of Acts
[2:03:13] chapter
[2:03:14] 7 if we still have a few minutes left
[2:03:18] we'll probably come back to this in time
[2:03:21] I I don't know we'll
[2:03:24] see in Acts
[2:03:28] 7 if you go jump down brother Bram does
[2:03:31] this in this message he jumps down to to
[2:03:36] verse 51 but I just want to go back a
[2:03:38] little bit to verse 48 just to set the
[2:03:40] background this is Peter's sory this is
[2:03:43] Steven's sermon that he gives to the
[2:03:47] Pharisees and the Sadducees
[2:03:49] to Saul of Tarsus to everyone who is
[2:03:52] there he just hammers out this sermon he
[2:03:55] lays it down right from the beginning to
[2:03:56] where he's at you know in verse 48 it
[2:03:59] says how be it the most high dwelleth
[2:04:01] not in temples made with hands as saith
[2:04:05] the prophet Heaven is my throne and
[2:04:08] Earth is my foot stol what house will ye
[2:04:12] build me saith the Lord or what is the
[2:04:15] place of my rest you know brothers and
[2:04:18] sisters we are talking about our rest
[2:04:20] our Sabbath day we've got a rest but are
[2:04:22] we giving him a place of rest in our
[2:04:24] lives are we cleaning out all the trash
[2:04:28] and saying no as the dove the Heavenly
[2:04:30] Dove you don't have to continue flying
[2:04:32] and and hovering and looking for a place
[2:04:34] to land you can come down here and
[2:04:36] actually land right here where you want
[2:04:37] to be in this heart you can actually
[2:04:39] take your rest in your resting place the
[2:04:41] place the house that I have chosen to
[2:04:44] build for you once I recognized that I
[2:04:47] found Grace in your sight before the
[2:04:49] foundation of the world I want to clean
[2:04:50] out all the trash I want to get in line
[2:04:52] with your word I don't want to mess
[2:04:54] around anymore I want to push out all
[2:04:56] the nonsense in my life and I just want
[2:04:58] to give you the preeminence but you know
[2:05:00] he says hath not my hand made all these
[2:05:03] things verse 51 ye stiff necked and
[2:05:06] uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do
[2:05:11] always resist the Holy Ghost as your
[2:05:13] fathers did so did
[2:05:16] ye I want to say Lord help me I don't
[2:05:19] want to resist you now brothers and
[2:05:21] sisters I'm just going to talk plainly
[2:05:23] here I know he leads me I know he speaks
[2:05:26] to my heart he speaks to my mind and
[2:05:29] many times I want to say no I want to do
[2:05:31] it this way he says all right go ahead
[2:05:34] see how that works for you he doesn't
[2:05:37] zap me with lightning but what happens
[2:05:39] is you wind up in a prickly situation
[2:05:42] and you come right back to him and you
[2:05:43] say Lord I know you spoke to me forgive
[2:05:45] me Lord let me get back in line with
[2:05:47] your word
[2:05:49] don't resist the Holy
[2:05:53] Ghost but how do they resist how do the
[2:05:56] people
[2:05:58] resist I want to quote from the
[2:06:00] exposition of the seven Church ages I
[2:06:02] love how this all goes together brothers
[2:06:03] and sisters the revelation of Jesus
[2:06:05] Christ recognizing who he truly is who
[2:06:08] the Holy Ghost is that's the revelation
[2:06:11] of Jesus Christ he is our Jesus Christ
[2:06:13] today the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ
[2:06:16] today alive and well in the people who
[2:06:19] actually create a house for him but how
[2:06:22] do they resist him brother bramy says
[2:06:24] this in the exposition of the seven
[2:06:26] Church ages this one's for free brother
[2:06:27] Logan don't worry about trying to find
[2:06:29] it he says he's coming he's coming in
[2:06:31] clouds Clouds Of Glory as when he was
[2:06:33] seen upon the Mount of transfiguration
[2:06:35] and his garments were shining as the
[2:06:37] power of God enfolded him and every eye
[2:06:41] shall see him that means this is not the
[2:06:44] Rapture this is when he comes to take
[2:06:46] over his rightful place as World ruler
[2:06:49] and we know this is Revelations chapter
[2:06:50] 19 and we'll all be coming back with him
[2:06:53] this is when those who have pierced him
[2:06:56] with their Creeds and denominational
[2:06:58] doctrines shall mourn it's not just the
[2:07:01] Jews it's not just the ones that he says
[2:07:04] you they ask him you know friend how did
[2:07:06] you get those those scars and he says I
[2:07:08] got at the house of my friends that's
[2:07:10] not what's going to be it's going to be
[2:07:11] everyone that chose not to accept the
[2:07:13] message of the hour in their day out of
[2:07:16] every single age not just this age but
[2:07:18] every age the ones that said no no no no
[2:07:20] no I I've done it this way my whole
[2:07:22] entire life I've been in the message of
[2:07:23] the hour for decades and what are you
[2:07:25] going to tell
[2:07:26] me I'm only going to tell you what the
[2:07:28] prophet of God said and we have the
[2:07:30] opportunity to accept that and say Amen
[2:07:33] to it or we can say nope I'm just going
[2:07:35] to take what I've always done because
[2:07:36] I've got what I've always got I'm just
[2:07:38] going to do that because I know it's
[2:07:39] safe if we do that brothers and sisters
[2:07:42] and God's calling us to go further then
[2:07:44] what's going to happen is we're going to
[2:07:45] be piercing him with our Creeds our den
[2:07:49] ination I remember brother Ken saying it
[2:07:52] over and over again we can have a
[2:07:53] denomination of
[2:07:55] one I can have my own values in my own
[2:07:58] belief system I I could even take out a
[2:08:01] book and I could write out all the
[2:08:02] things that I believe and why I believe
[2:08:04] them and I can just read it every single
[2:08:06] day and say this is what I believe and
[2:08:09] that's good to do I remember brother Ken
[2:08:11] saying we should do that write out 10
[2:08:13] things of what you believe but then take
[2:08:16] them back to the word and prove that
[2:08:17] they line up with the word and if they
[2:08:19] don't line up with the word get rid of
[2:08:21] it take it out of there
[2:08:26] amen this is when he comes to take over
[2:08:28] his rightful place as World ruler this
[2:08:30] is when those who have pierced him with
[2:08:32] their Creeds and denominational
[2:08:34] doctrines shall mourn and all the people
[2:08:37] shall wail in Terror because of him who
[2:08:40] is the word and remember the the five
[2:08:44] unwise virgins they went out to try and
[2:08:46] find oil they came knock on the doors of
[2:08:49] the wise virgin saying come on give us
[2:08:50] some oil man this is important this is
[2:08:52] really important like really really
[2:08:54] really important the bridegroom is
[2:08:55] actually here now come on man share some
[2:08:58] oil with us and what did the the wise
[2:09:00] virgins say they said hey look we can't
[2:09:02] give you the oil that we've got we've
[2:09:03] only got enough for ourselves you got to
[2:09:05] go and do what you got to go buy your
[2:09:07] own you got to go get your own go tithe
[2:09:11] to some of those Ministries that say Hey
[2:09:12] just name it and claim it send your
[2:09:14] money in and God will bless you go get
[2:09:16] your own oil and what did they do they
[2:09:19] came
[2:09:20] back and they knocked on the door no
[2:09:23] doubt they had some prayer meetings they
[2:09:25] had some tears they had some some
[2:09:27] wailing and nashing of teeth saying Lord
[2:09:29] open the door to us and what did he say
[2:09:31] to them you know what it's too late the
[2:09:34] bridegrooms come he warned you Prophet
[2:09:37] after Prophet preacher after preacher
[2:09:39] message after message you heard it you
[2:09:42] heard it you heard it but you still
[2:09:43] chose to resist it because of your place
[2:09:46] of comfort now the door is closed
[2:09:49] closed remember brother bradam was asked
[2:09:51] the question what are they going to
[2:09:52] preach after the
[2:09:53] Rapture what are they going to preach
[2:09:55] after the Rapture I find this just so
[2:09:56] fascinating he said the very same thing
[2:09:58] they preach all the way along they'll
[2:10:00] just keep preaching it they'll keep
[2:10:02] seeing people get baptized they'll think
[2:10:04] they're getting saved and the Rapture
[2:10:06] will done already be gone we don't want
[2:10:08] to be there seeing that brothers and
[2:10:09] sisters that's why I can only say get
[2:10:11] into Christ understand who the Holy
[2:10:13] Ghost is understand that's the seal that
[2:10:15] we need understand that's the only thing
[2:10:17] that we need in our lives and he the
[2:10:20] spirit of Truth when he comes into our
[2:10:22] lives he'll lead us and guide us through
[2:10:24] every single thing that we need he'll
[2:10:27] lead us and guide us in finances if
[2:10:28] we're willing to lay them open before
[2:10:30] him he'll lead us and guide us in
[2:10:32] relationships if we're willing to lead
[2:10:34] them out in front of him and say Lord
[2:10:36] help me with it he'll lead us and guide
[2:10:38] us in our education if we're looking for
[2:10:40] a job posting somewhere he'll lead us
[2:10:42] and guide us in all of that if we're
[2:10:43] looking to buy a house he'll lead us and
[2:10:45] guide us into all of that if we're
[2:10:46] looking to find a church where we can be
[2:10:47] fed he'll lead us and guide us into all
[2:10:49] that he'll lead us and guide us wherever
[2:10:51] we allow him to but he's a gentleman
[2:10:53] he's just going to stand back and say
[2:10:54] you know whatever you want honey
[2:10:56] whenever you say the word I'll actually
[2:10:58] be there to back it up but I'm not going
[2:11:00] to come and usurp Authority and just
[2:11:01] drag you through the non hole sideways
[2:11:03] that's not going to happen you have to
[2:11:05] be the one to be willing to surrender
[2:11:07] unto me you have to be willing to be
[2:11:09] submissive unto me that's why it's so
[2:11:12] incredible when we look at husbands that
[2:11:13] would just say she should submit to me
[2:11:16] because that's what the word of God says
[2:11:18] but where is his relationship to God is
[2:11:21] he submitted to God is he surrendered to
[2:11:23] God no I'll tell you right now he's not
[2:11:27] because if he was he wouldn't behave
[2:11:28] that way to his
[2:11:30] bride because that's not how God behaves
[2:11:32] to his
[2:11:34] bride so how could a human being a man a
[2:11:36] mere mortal think that he could behave
[2:11:38] that way to his bride to his Queen to
[2:11:40] his princess it doesn't add up does it
[2:11:44] it's just another spirit it's a
[2:11:46] denominational Creed it's a dog it's
[2:11:48] something we've learned somewhere along
[2:11:50] the way that gives us the liberty to
[2:11:51] behave to misbehave actually because
[2:11:55] it's not
[2:11:55] behaving what is the Holy Ghost that's
[2:11:59] what the holy spirit is we're only going
[2:12:01] to get this quote I think and then we'll
[2:12:03] uh probably have to wind it up here he
[2:12:06] says that's what the holy spirit is it's
[2:12:09] your
[2:12:10] Assurance it's your Assurance brothers
[2:12:13] and sisters that's what the Holy Ghost
[2:12:15] is when we have the Holy Ghost In Our
[2:12:17] Lives when we're sealed in when that box
[2:12:19] car of our life has been shaken and
[2:12:21] rattled and all the loose places filled
[2:12:23] unpacked and repacked and everything in
[2:12:25] our life has gone through and we've
[2:12:27] asked the Lord what can I do to make my
[2:12:29] life solid for you he becomes our
[2:12:32] Assurance it's your protection it's your
[2:12:36] witness it's your seal remember until
[2:12:40] the Rapture happens Satan has access to
[2:12:43] the throne of God and what does he do he
[2:12:47] goes and he accuses is the Brethren and
[2:12:49] you're the
[2:12:50] Brethren he says do you know what that
[2:12:53] brother did to the
[2:12:55] Lord do you know what that brother said
[2:12:58] do you know what that brother
[2:13:00] thought and who knows maybe there's a
[2:13:02] giant Jumbotron they call him video
[2:13:04] walls now and it'll just be the
[2:13:08] words that's what brother Barry thought
[2:13:11] nobody else knows it but now you do
[2:13:13] father do you know that that's what he
[2:13:15] thought do you know that's what he done
[2:13:17] did you you see he's the accuser of the
[2:13:20] Brethren but there's coming a day where
[2:13:22] he ain't going to be able to do a thing
[2:13:23] and as Sons and Daughters of the most
[2:13:25] high God even though we do things we
[2:13:29] have an attorney we have an attorney
[2:13:31] there saying yes but look at this Blood
[2:13:35] this blood stain here it represents the
[2:13:38] protection it represents the Assurance
[2:13:41] it represents my life that was given for
[2:13:44] him and you know the beautiful thing
[2:13:45] brothers and sisters this is where it's
[2:13:47] just not fair
[2:13:48] really when we get this Revelation it's
[2:13:50] just not fair our attorney is our
[2:13:55] judge I'd say there's a major conflict
[2:13:57] of interest there but you know what
[2:14:00] there's no way that you can ever be
[2:14:02] accused if you have the Holy
[2:14:05] Spirit the accuser of the Brethren is
[2:14:07] going to try all he wants but he's going
[2:14:09] to say NOP there's a blood stain nope
[2:14:11] nope NOP no no no there's a bumper of
[2:14:13] blood and I've already covered it all so
[2:14:15] just move on talk about someone
[2:14:18] else that's why brothers and sisters we
[2:14:21] need to be that vigilant for one another
[2:14:23] when someone comes around and starts
[2:14:24] wanting to talk trash about someone else
[2:14:27] if it's the spirit of Christ he's going
[2:14:28] to say nope there's actually blood
[2:14:30] covering that brother amen there's
[2:14:32] actually blood covering that sister I
[2:14:35] don't even want to hear it that's an
[2:14:37] accuser of the Brethren just move along
[2:14:39] because that same blood stain for them
[2:14:42] is there for me and I recognize that and
[2:14:44] I'm not willing to entertain that
[2:14:46] garbage amen the accuser of the Brethren
[2:14:49] when he can't get attention in heaven
[2:14:51] he's going to come to Earth and see if
[2:14:52] he can actually work up the brothers and
[2:14:54] the sisters and we know the legalist
[2:14:56] ones they're the ones that will say oh
[2:14:58] really wow I would never have done that
[2:15:01] really what's your
[2:15:04] seal he says it's your witness it's your
[2:15:06] seal it's your sign that I'm heavenbound
[2:15:09] don't care what the devil says I'm
[2:15:12] heavenbound why he sealed me amen he
[2:15:16] sealed me
[2:15:18] I can't seal myself and I can't seal you
[2:15:20] and that's why there's preachers that's
[2:15:22] why there's a five-fold Ministry we're
[2:15:23] saying get in the boat right now while
[2:15:25] there's time brothers and sisters get
[2:15:28] the Seal of Christ in your life I I I'm
[2:15:31] sorry I'll call the musicians I feel
[2:15:33] like we're just getting about halfway
[2:15:35] into this message today the devil says
[2:15:38] it but you know what I'm heavenbound why
[2:15:40] he he sealed me he gave it to me he
[2:15:42] sealed me into his kingdom and I'm
[2:15:45] glorybound are you glory bound today he
[2:15:48] says let the winds blow let Satan do
[2:15:50] what he wants to God has done sealed me
[2:15:53] till the day of my Redemption amen amen
[2:15:56] that's what the Holy Ghost is oh you
[2:16:00] should want
[2:16:02] it brothers and sisters you should want
[2:16:05] it I couldn't go on without
[2:16:08] it so much could be said there but I'm
[2:16:10] sure you know what I'm speaking of I'll
[2:16:14] ask you to stand with me today as we
[2:16:17] close
[2:16:19] I feel like if we go further it'll be a
[2:16:21] lot
[2:16:25] longer I just want to encourage us
[2:16:27] brothers and sisters let's take a look
[2:16:28] at the Holy Ghost and see what the Holy
[2:16:30] Ghost is and I think in time we'll look
[2:16:33] at what the Holy Ghost isn't as
[2:16:36] well because you know there is a
[2:16:39] religious spirit and that religious
[2:16:41] spirit loves to go to
[2:16:44] church that religious spirit loves to go
[2:16:46] to church with with the message
[2:16:49] Believers but you know what it's not our
[2:16:51] job to do the cleansing amen it's his
[2:16:54] job to do the
[2:16:55] cleansing and I'll be honest with you
[2:16:58] 100% transparent honest that's the
[2:16:59] reason why brother Barry keeps preaching
[2:17:01] the Holy Ghost because those religious
[2:17:03] ones they can't stand
[2:17:05] it but the Believers say Amen to it
[2:17:08] because they know that's the only way
[2:17:10] we're going to get out of
[2:17:12] here maybe it sounds Elementary but I
[2:17:15] want to say this brothers and sisters if
[2:17:17] we want to
[2:17:18] God in our midst then let's get our ABCs
[2:17:20] down pat you know children they do flash
[2:17:23] cards they learn the flash cards 2 * 2 2
[2:17:26] * 4 2 * 6 2 * 8 on and on and on and on
[2:17:30] and they need to be able to answer them
[2:17:32] we need to be that way with the word of
[2:17:33] God that's our flash card when we can
[2:17:36] get that way with the word of God the
[2:17:37] message of the hour you know what's
[2:17:38] going to happen we're going to have it
[2:17:41] we're going to be ready we're not going
[2:17:43] to be needing to be trained we're going
[2:17:44] to have our ABCs down we're going to
[2:17:47] understand and the
[2:17:49] fundamentals and once we do brothers and
[2:17:51] sisters we'll see God move in our midst
[2:17:53] but we want to put him first we want to
[2:17:55] put him in the highest most prominent
[2:17:57] place in our church the highest most
[2:18:00] prominent place in our lives in our
[2:18:01] homes in our families in our marriages
[2:18:03] and our relationships if we do that
[2:18:05] brothers and sisters you will see signs
[2:18:07] and wonders trailing you all the way
[2:18:08] along and the whole world's going to say
[2:18:10] what's that God's name that you serve
[2:18:12] because something's different about you
[2:18:14] than anybody else that I've ever met in
[2:18:16] my life
[2:18:20] you should want it brothers and sisters
[2:18:22] I know I want it let's just bow in
[2:18:24] prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[2:18:27] Jesus we just love you and we thank you
[2:18:29] for your goodness and your mercy we are
[2:18:31] so thankful Lord that we can say that we
[2:18:33] found Grace in your sight Lord Jesus
[2:18:36] before the foundation of the
[2:18:39] world father we just are so thankful for
[2:18:41] what you've done for us and what you're
[2:18:43] doing even right now Lord if there's
[2:18:45] anybody here that questions whether
[2:18:46] they've got your home Holy Spirit or not
[2:18:48] in their lives father I just want to
[2:18:50] pray for them right now because I know
[2:18:52] that even right now in this very moment

[2:18:58] that person if they really want you than
[2:19:01] Jes so father I pray that you would
[2:19:02] grant that that opportunity for those
[2:19:04] people who have taken the desire and and
[2:19:07] Lord recognized it in their heart that
[2:19:09] that promise is unto you and to your
[2:19:12] children and to as many as a far off
[2:19:14] even as many as the Lord Our God should
[2:19:16] call we have the AB ility to receive
[2:19:18] this free gift from you oh Lord there's
[2:19:21] no greater gift than to receive that
[2:19:23] holy spirit because that seals us until
[2:19:25] the day of our Redemption we heard it
[2:19:27] today oh Lord that gives us the
[2:19:29] assurance that gives us the protection
[2:19:31] it gives us the witness before your very
[2:19:33] Throne Lord Jesus that we're not our own
[2:19:36] father we're so thankful for your
[2:19:38] goodness and your mercy that you're our
[2:19:40] attorney and you're our judge that
[2:19:42] you're the author and the finisher of
[2:19:44] our faith Lord Jesus father we pray that
[2:19:46] if we have a offended anyone Lord that
[2:19:48] you would forgive us for it that you
[2:19:50] would just allow us Lord Jesus to make
[2:19:52] it right if we need to if we have ought
[2:19:54] Lord help us to follow your word amen
[2:19:58] hallelujah Lord we'll be careful to give
[2:20:00] you all the praise when we're
[2:20:02] done father we just ask now that you
[2:20:04] would go with us as we go our separate
[2:20:06] ways bring those away father home safely
[2:20:09] at the appointed time we pray we love
