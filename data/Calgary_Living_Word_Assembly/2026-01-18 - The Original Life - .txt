Description:
God's attributes were manifested
To His Bride in this last age
We have caught the revelation
By the last prophet's message
And we know who we are
And what we are raised up for
Praise the Lord for the original life

CHORUS
The original life, the original seed
The original Word is what I believe
The Son of Man is revealed
The seventh seal is unveiled
The original life, the original seed

We are the Word made flesh today
This is what the Scriptures say
And our names are seen within
Redeemed and perfect without sin
Yes we are anointed and inspired
By our God, who's the original life

Our eyes of understanding
He has opened up at last
And sweet victory is ours
Who were chained down in the past
True Jubilee has sounded
And we have responded
To our God, who's the original life

We are called unto adoption
Full authority and power
Sleeping saints will wake and join us
For translation in this hour
Gentiles' days will soon be over
Glory, hallelujah
To our God, who's the original life
