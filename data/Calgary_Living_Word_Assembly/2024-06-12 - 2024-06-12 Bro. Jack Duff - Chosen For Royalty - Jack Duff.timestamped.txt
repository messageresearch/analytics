[14:50] absolute father we've got not just any
[14:52] word today we've got the word to our age

[14:57] we've got the promise of Ephesians for
[14:59] Lord that you would bring us to
[15:01] Perfection by the preaching and the
[15:03] hearing of that word it's such a paradox

[43:54] Florida on the East Coast uh come by and
[43:57] see us amen we'd love to have you I just
[44:00] want to read a a scripture here from
[44:02] first Peter uh chapter
[44:10] two 1 Peter chapter 2 we'll start at
[44:14] verse
[44:20] one says uh wherefore laying
[44:25] aside all malice and all Gile and
[44:28] hypocrisies and envies and all evil
[44:32] speakings I like reading the scripture
[44:34] and one of the things I like pointing
[44:36] out here is um the scripture says we
[44:39] have to lay these things aside it
[44:42] doesn't say that God has to take them
[44:44] from us but we actually have to give
[44:45] them up right laying aside uh all malice
[44:49] and all G and hypocrisies and envies and
[44:52] all evil speakings as newborn babes
[44:56] desire the sin your milk of the word
[44:58] that ye may grow thereby if so be ye
[45:01] have tasted that the Lord is gracious to
[45:04] whom coming as unto a living Stone
[45:06] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[45:08] God and precious says ye also as Lively
[45:11] stones are built built up a spiritual
[45:13] house and holy priesthood to offer up
[45:16] spiritual sacrifice acceptable to God by
[45:19] Jesus Christ wherefore also uh it it is
[45:23] contained in the scripture behold I lay
[45:26] in Zion a CH
[45:27] Cornerstone elect precious and he that
[45:30] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[45:33] unto you therefore which believe he is
[45:35] precious but unto them which be
[45:38] disobedient the stone which the builders
[45:40] disallowed the same is made the head of
[45:42] the corner and a stone of stumbling and
[45:46] a rock of offense even to them which
[45:49] stumble at the word being disobedient
[45:52] whereinto also they were appointed and
[45:55] I'm glad the scripture doesn't stop
[45:57] there the next verse says but ye are a
[46:01] chosen generation a royal priesthood and
[46:05] holy nation A peculiar people that ye
[46:09] should show forth the Praises of him who
[46:11] have called you out of Darkness Into His
[46:14] Marvelous Light amen the Lord had a
[46:17] blessing to the reading of his word
[46:18] shall we just bow in a word of prayer
[46:20] dear God we are grateful for the
[46:22] privilege and the opportunity we have to
[46:24] come and fellowship around the word of
[46:26] the the Lord uh God we ask you blessings
[46:30] upon what we have read but we know it
[46:31] takes the Holy Spirit to make the word
[46:34] live in the day in which we live and
[46:37] father we ask that you would just come
[46:39] now and take control over every thought
[46:41] uh the thoughts that are being presented
[46:43] as well as the thoughts that are being
[46:44] received Lord may you just have the
[46:46] preeminence uh in this portion of the
[46:49] service we thank you that your presence
[46:50] your Mighty presence is already here
[46:52] help us to enter and receive all that
[46:54] you have in store for us tonight in
[46:56] Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless
[47:00] you you can be seated uh want to take
[47:02] for a uh subject tonight uh chosen for
[47:07] royalty amen chosen for
[47:11] royalty brother brandom tells us a
[47:14] story um and a couple different sermons
[47:18] and um one sermon I think he says this
[47:22] boy went to his grandmother's house
[47:23] another sermon I think he says he went
[47:25] to his aunt's house and uh and I and I
[47:28] know that there are people out there
[47:29] looking for little things like that in
[47:32] the message to try to find something to
[47:34] say that uh that's why I can't follow
[47:37] the message he doesn't have his stories
[47:38] right uh it's not about whose house the
[47:41] boy went to it's really about what
[47:44] happened when he got to the house and
[47:46] that's the focus that we want to bring
[47:48] our attention to uh tonight brother
[47:50] brandom tells us that this boy was
[47:52] coming from the country and then he
[47:54] walks into this house and I he's there
[47:57] for you know a little bit and just
[47:59] observing all the things there in that
[48:01] house that they don't have out in the
[48:03] country and uh one day this boy finds
[48:05] himself walking up the steps in this
[48:08] house and as he's coming up the steps he
[48:10] gets to the top step and uh when he when
[48:13] he when he looks he uh sees something on
[48:15] the wall that he's never seen before and
[48:19] uh and and you know he just kind of
[48:20] starts making little movements maybe he
[48:22] takes this right hand and he does like
[48:24] this and he sees there this image doing
[48:26] the exact same thing that he's doing
[48:28] then maybe he takes the left hand he
[48:30] does like this and he sees that image
[48:32] doing the exact same thing he's doing
[48:34] and he's he's he's he's in awe of what
[48:36] is going on and finally looks at his mom
[48:39] with a startling amen uh Revelation and
[48:43] it says mama that's
[48:46] me praise the Lord and and I think amen
[48:50] as the bride of Christ hallelujah amen
[48:53] there comes a time where we look into
[48:55] the scripture
[48:57] amen and we can look into the mirror of
[48:59] God's word we say mama that's me
[49:04] hallelujah it's one thing to identify
[49:06] the prophet amen it's another it's one
[49:09] thing to identify all the other you know
[49:11] uh ones that have come on the scene and
[49:13] I mean John the Baptist and he was
[49:14] promised in the scripture we can
[49:16] identify the different ones but when we
[49:18] identify ourselves in the scripture
[49:20] praise God it's a different story amen
[49:24] uh when we talk about this subject of
[49:26] chosen
[49:27] for royalty we we look there at the
[49:29] Scripture it says ye are a chosen
[49:32] generation and uh as I meditated on on
[49:36] on just those words there you know I
[49:39] thought about various Generations that
[49:41] have walked this Earth people that have
[49:43] gone on before us but yet in their time
[49:46] they would have probably thought they
[49:48] were the chosen generation I thought
[49:51] about amen the children of Israel uh
[49:54] certainly would have thought that they
[49:55] were chosen in their day
[49:57] they were uh about 400 years amen
[50:01] waiting to uh come out of bondage and
[50:03] here I mean 10 Generations um uh and and
[50:07] and and this 10th Generation finally had
[50:09] the opportunity to be released from the
[50:11] the bondage of the Egyptians and and I
[50:13] would think that when they come out and
[50:16] they're released from uh years and years
[50:18] of bondage maybe this group would say
[50:20] you know what we are the chosen
[50:23] generation right but uh but when when we
[50:25] look at it you know I said what a
[50:27] generation to live in to see the plague
[50:29] strike Egypt and to see the death angel
[50:32] pass through the land and strike the
[50:33] homes of those who had not followed the
[50:37] words of the Prophet Moses hallelujah
[50:40] amen and and they they experienced the
[50:42] Deliverance departing of the Red Sea
[50:45] death to the Egyptians but but they died
[50:47] wandering in the wilderness rather than
[50:49] enjoying the Bliss of the land flowing
[50:51] with milk and honey that generation
[50:53] failed to enter the promised land but
[50:55] they gave birth to to a new
[50:58] generation Hallelujah after entering the
[51:01] promised land the Next Generation
[51:02] experienced Sons stand still Moon hang
[51:06] over adelon uh they they they they
[51:08] experienced The Parting of the Waters of
[51:11] the Jordan just like their fathers that
[51:12] experienc The Parting of the Red Sea it
[51:15] says and and and after letting out a
[51:16] great shout after walking around the
[51:19] walls of Jericho they saw the walls come
[51:21] down hallelujah what a generation to be
[51:25] living in but and maybe for their day
[51:27] they would consider themselves We Are
[51:30] The Chosen generation hallelujah amen I
[51:34] thought about the the generation that
[51:36] lived during the amen the the the the
[51:38] the time of the first king of Israel
[51:40] Saul uh they saw his rejection by God
[51:44] they saw the uplifting amen of David to
[51:46] become king and and slay Goliath and and
[51:49] eventually become the second king of
[51:51] Israel David was chosen David lived to
[51:53] anoint his son Solomon to be the next
[51:55] king and that generation enjoyed the
[51:57] wisdom of God like no other generation
[52:00] maybe they would have thought we are a
[52:03] chosen
[52:04] generation Hallelujah I think about the
[52:07] generation that lived during the time of
[52:09] the Lord Jesus his first coming my God
[52:12] what a time to live on the earth during
[52:15] the first coming of our Lord and Savior
[52:18] Jesus Christ amen one would have thought
[52:21] amen that many would have been under
[52:23] expectation to see Christ however there
[52:26] were only a few like Simeon and Anna and
[52:30] and the wise men and some Shepherds that
[52:32] were blessed to welcome him though many
[52:34] experienced his power and his wisdom and
[52:38] when I think about his wisdom I think
[52:40] about the woman caught in adultery and
[52:43] and and and here you know they they they
[52:44] bring this woman into the presence of
[52:46] the Lord Jesus and and they say uh you
[52:49] know we caught her in the act of
[52:51] adultery and we want to know what is it
[52:53] that you suggest that we do what
[52:55] judgment do you think we should bring on
[52:57] to this lady and and the scripture tells
[52:59] us that Jesus just began to write in the
[53:01] sand ignoring every accusation that they
[53:05] were bringing towards this woman I I
[53:07] like this because the the same God that
[53:09] ignored every accusation against her is
[53:12] the same God that ignores every
[53:13] accusation that's brought against us
[53:16] hallelujah he knows that his blood has
[53:18] covered everything amen that the devil
[53:20] can accuse us of Amen so he ignores
[53:23] every accusation and and as as as uh as
[53:27] he's writing there in the sand he
[53:29] finally looks up and he asks these these
[53:32] uh religious leaders that that brought
[53:33] this lady into his presence it says he
[53:36] that's without sin Let Him cast the
[53:38] first stone and and and I love the
[53:40] wisdom of the Lord because if they
[53:43] caught this lady in
[53:46] adultery you can't catch her committing
[53:48] adultery by herself you must bring the
[53:52] other guilty party if you caught her in
[53:55] adultery so I love the way his wisdom
[53:57] just kicked in and handled this
[53:59] situation and when when he says you know
[54:01] woman where are your accusers say I have
[54:03] none he said neither do I accuse you but
[54:05] go and sin no more amen amen hallelujah
[54:11] we thank God for the wisdom that was
[54:13] expressed during the time that Jesus was
[54:16] on the earth we we we we we so many
[54:19] situations the woman at the well the the
[54:22] woman washed his feet and and was she
[54:24] wasn't invited Amen to the party there
[54:26] Simeon but she washed his feed and and
[54:29] had her sins forgiven the feeding of the
[54:31] 5,000 the feeding of the 4,000 Watching
[54:33] The Dead be raised blind giving it sight
[54:37] death uh having their tongues loose and
[54:39] yet the majority of these people wanted
[54:43] to see him
[54:45] crucified what a generation to live in
[54:49] and you know in that generation to be
[54:50] identified with Christ meant to be
[54:54] excommunicated from everything else am
[54:57] what a generation I think of generation
[55:01] that lived to see the soua Street
[55:03] Revival the generation that Liv to see
[55:05] the wealth Revival glory to God some
[55:08] some some wonderful uh people have some
[55:10] wonderful experiences in their time uh
[55:12] here on this Earth and what a mighty
[55:14] move of the spirit of God during the the
[55:17] W Revival and the soua Street Revival
[55:19] those revivals gave birth to another
[55:21] generation that saw people move from
[55:23] tent to 10 and experience the presence
[55:25] of God there were great healing Revival
[55:27] sweeping the Nations right jack Cole or
[55:30] Roberts Billy Graham Tommy Hicks TL
[55:33] Osborne are just some of the Min that
[55:35] were ministers that were used during
[55:36] that time but we also know that uh uh
[55:39] even God's Prophet amen was on the scene
[55:43] during this generation of Mighty temp
[55:45] revivals and many and in brother
[55:48] brandom's day many experienced the
[55:50] presence of Christ amen in his meetings
[55:53] I mean you go to a meeting he he here
[55:55] he's coming from the us and maybe coming
[55:57] here to Alberta and and and calling out
[55:59] names of people and telling their
[56:01] addresses he doesn't even know their
[56:03] address he's never been here before I
[56:05] mean but wherever he went God used the
[56:08] prophet in this way I mean this message
[56:10] that we follow has been thoroughly
[56:12] Vindicated by the Holy Ghost amen it's
[56:15] it's it was not a man it was God in the
[56:18] man it was God in the man and we we and
[56:20] we and like like Paul said follow me as
[56:23] I follow Christ we're following the
[56:25] prophet as he followed
[56:27] Christ I thought about that generation
[56:30] and what a time it would have been to
[56:32] live during the days where you walk into
[56:34] a meeting and and hear the prophet go
[56:36] through you know some of the things that
[56:37] he went through and and just share some
[56:39] of the sermons that he shared and and
[56:41] just to see the supernatural you know
[56:43] just on the scene it would just just
[56:45] bless you to live in a generation like
[56:48] that I I I I know that we still have
[56:51] eyewitnesses amen that are still living
[56:53] and telling us testimonies of things
[56:55] that happen and than that they've seen
[56:57] and the testimonies we enjoy hearing we
[57:00] really do enjoy hearing but I want to
[57:02] just uh I want to make mention of some
[57:04] things some even saw the angel of the
[57:07] Lord some amen experienced a blast that
[57:10] shook the rocks in sunset Mountain Seven
[57:13] Angels come down to commission the
[57:15] prophet while he was in Tucson Arizona
[57:17] and told him to go back east and preach
[57:19] the
[57:20] seals what testimonies we were blessed
[57:23] to hear but I want to say something
[57:25] tonight that generation that lived
[57:27] during the time while the prophet was
[57:29] here on the earth some of them have gone
[57:31] on with the Lord and and some are still
[57:33] living but I want to say that generation
[57:35] was not the
[57:37] climax Oh My My My hallelujah hallelujah
[57:42] God had another
[57:44] generation that was coming along to
[57:47] experience the greatest event that will
[57:50] ever happened on the
[57:52] earth glory to God and what is the
[57:54] greatest event that will ever happened
[57:56] on the Earth Earth it will be the second
[57:58] coming of the Lord amen and only the
[58:02] predestinate will see it and that group
[58:05] that is living during that time is who
[58:07] we call the
[58:09] chosen
[58:11] generation that's right oh my God I'm so
[58:15] glad that I can say I'm one of
[58:20] them brother random makes a statement
[58:22] here in the message Ephesians Church H
[58:25] he says the these seven Messengers are
[58:28] making God known to the
[58:31] people he says he that receiveth them
[58:34] receiveth him yes that sent them amen
[58:38] let's just make it really clear if you
[58:41] can't receive the messengers you can't
[58:43] receive
[58:46] Christ glory to God he that receiveth
[58:50] them receiveth him that sent them they
[58:53] were seven stars in the hand of the Lord
[58:57] Jesus glory to God they didn't come with
[58:59] their own Ministry they came with his
[59:01] ministry he says this he says John 1320
[59:04] they speak and act upon his authority he
[59:07] stands behind them with the power of the
[59:09] godhead Matthew 28:18-20 and Jesus came
[59:12] and spake to him all power is given unto
[59:15] me in heaven and in Earth go ye
[59:17] therefore and teach All Nations
[59:19] baptizing them in the name of the father
[59:20] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[59:22] teaching them to observe all things
[59:24] whatsoever whato I have commanded you
[59:27] and lo I'm with you always even until
[59:30] the end of the consummation of the ages
[59:32] it says so there they are full of the
[59:36] Holy Ghost and faith on fire with the
[59:39] fire of God holding forth the word of
[59:41] Truth and here he stands to back them
[59:45] upall we we we we recognize it was
[59:48] Christ backing up the
[59:50] prophet and if his Doctrine was wrong
[59:53] why would Christ back him up like that
[59:55] amen
[59:56] no no his Doctrine wasn't wrong that's
[59:58] not the problem it's it's the people
[1:00:00] that have gone wrong hallelujah amen but
[1:00:03] here here he says this he says um uh and
[1:00:06] he stands there stands to back them up
[1:00:09] and think of it not one believer of any
[1:00:13] age need cry in his heart oh that I

[1:04:01] told us when we come to church if you
[1:04:03] would bring your little liquor fire and
[1:04:06] then this other person bring their
[1:04:08] little liquor fire and everybody bring
[1:04:10] their little liquor fire said before you

[1:04:13] fire but a little liquor fire is in
[1:04:16] everybody every Born Again believer
[1:04:19] hallelujah holy ghost feel Christian
[1:04:22] amen amen also in John 18:12 it says
[1:04:26] then spake Jesus again unto them saying
[1:04:28] I am the light of the world he that
[1:04:31] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[1:04:35] but shall have the light of Life are we
[1:04:41] following him the light is inside of us
[1:04:45] hear the scripture in 1 Peter 2:9 it
[1:04:47] says but ye are a chosen
[1:04:50] generation a royal priesthood and holy
[1:04:54] nation A peculiar people people that ye
[1:04:57] should show forth the Praises of him who
[1:04:58] have called you out of Darkness Into His
[1:05:00] Marvelous Light and I was just looking
[1:05:03] at that uh scripture from the emphatic
[1:05:06] diaglot uh it it reads a little
[1:05:08] different it says but ye are a chosen
[1:05:11] race I I like those words ye are chosen
[1:05:14] race and that means something to us as
[1:05:17] message Believers I'll read a quote
[1:05:18] about that in a little bit but you are a
[1:05:20] chosen race it says a royal priesthood a
[1:05:23] holy nation then it says this a people
[1:05:26] for a purpose amen glory that you may
[1:05:30] declare the Perfections of him who
[1:05:34] called you from Darkness into his
[1:05:36] wonderful
[1:05:39] light I love that I love that see um
[1:05:43] when when when when when they said that
[1:05:45] we are chosen race and that that's the
[1:05:48] original amen uh translation of the uh
[1:05:52] of the Bible into the English language
[1:05:53] the emphatic dagot brings us to original
[1:05:56] translation and and you are a chosen
[1:05:58] race now that that that that that that
[1:06:00] connects to something that the angel
[1:06:02] lord said when he told the prophet pick
[1:06:04] up your pen and
[1:06:07] write I I love I love how the Holy
[1:06:10] Spirit does that and and I'mma tell you
[1:06:12] in in spoken words The Original Seed you
[1:06:14] you'll see it where the first time
[1:06:15] brother brandham releases that but this
[1:06:18] was not even brother bram's words he was
[1:06:20] simply the Scribe that was writing down
[1:06:23] what the angel said and the Ang was
[1:06:25] speaking that to a generation that was
[1:06:27] to come he was speaking it to you he
[1:06:30] speaking it to me and the angel said in
[1:06:32] the Ephesian Church AG it says in the LA
[1:06:35] in these last days the true bride Church
[1:06:40] Christ seed will come to The Headstone
[1:06:44] and she
[1:06:46] will be the Super Church a super
[1:06:50] race as she nears him brother is thus
[1:06:56] sayith the Lord I don't care how we feel
[1:07:00] I don't care you know how the devil
[1:07:02] might make us uh make it seem like we're
[1:07:04] not uh conquerors or not Victorious here
[1:07:07] the the the prophet tells us by an
[1:07:10] Angel an angel says amen that as we say
[1:07:15] we will be the Super Church a super race
[1:07:19] as she nears him they in the bride will
[1:07:22] be so much like him that they will even
[1:07:24] be in his very
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:26] [Applause]
[1:07:28] image hey we're being changed right now
[1:07:30] every time we come into the house of the
[1:07:33] Lord we're being transformed and changed
[1:07:35] into His Image it's not based on how we
[1:07:38] feel Saints it's based on what is what
[1:07:40] is thus sayith the Lord sir and all we
[1:07:42] do is yield ourselves to what the word
[1:07:44] of God says we act we we act just like
[1:07:47] Mary be it unto me according to Thy
[1:07:52] Word a yielded vessel yes
[1:07:56] Peter writes
[1:07:59] this but you are chosen generation the
[1:08:02] Royal priest of the holy nation peculiar
[1:08:04] people that you should show forth the
[1:08:05] Praises of him who has called you out of
[1:08:07] Darkness into Marvelous Light it's Peter
[1:08:09] that writes this and as I was just doing
[1:08:12] a little research I found out that this
[1:08:15] was written in ad. 60 60 years after the
[1:08:20] death of our death and resurrection of
[1:08:22] our Lord and savior 60 years pet would
[1:08:25] write first Peter here and and and and
[1:08:28] and you know for me as I'm sitting there
[1:08:30] and I'm looking at that and I'm going
[1:08:32] through the life of Peter so why would
[1:08:35] Peter write ye are our chosen generation
[1:08:40] if I was Peter and I was doing right in
[1:08:43] this I don't think I would have put
[1:08:45] ye I think I would have put I I am a
[1:08:50] chosen generation and I think Peter his
[1:08:54] resume amen uh there's enough things in
[1:08:57] resume where he could say that and we
[1:08:59] probably all agree but he doesn't say I
[1:09:02] he says ye oh my think about some of the
[1:09:06] things that Peter went through the the
[1:09:08] very first time he meets the Lord
[1:09:11] Jesus Peter is is is is is coming in
[1:09:15] from work his his his Fe his his um uh
[1:09:19] uh his profession is fishing and Peter's
[1:09:22] coming in from work and brother brandham
[1:09:25] gives us a little insight Amen to what
[1:09:27] was going on Peter amen docks his boat
[1:09:31] and he gets out the boat he's a little
[1:09:33] discouraged because they haven't caught
[1:09:35] any fish amen and and he and he and and
[1:09:38] and it just so happened where he docks
[1:09:40] the boat amen Jesus decides to have a
[1:09:43] service in that spot that that day so so
[1:09:46] so brother Ram said that when Peter got
[1:09:49] out of the boat he come up on the shore
[1:09:51] and he maybe sat down on a stump and he
[1:09:53] says let's see what this fella has got
[1:09:57] to say Amen sometimes we come to church
[1:10:00] with the same type of approach let's see
[1:10:04] what this fell has got to say hallelujah
[1:10:08] glory to God so Peter approaches amen
[1:10:10] the service with this type of uh amen uh
[1:10:14] attitude if I could put it that way but
[1:10:16] but as he's sitting there the crowds get
[1:10:18] larger and larger and uh and brother
[1:10:21] brandom tells us amen that that Jesus
[1:10:23] looks to P said could I could I get into
[1:10:25] your boat and preach from your boat to
[1:10:28] these people so so Peter said well sure
[1:10:30] you know I mean the people are pushing
[1:10:32] you back into the water why don't you
[1:10:34] step up here in my boat and and and just
[1:10:36] go ahead and finish out your sermon
[1:10:38] Jesus finishes the sermon maybe closes
[1:10:40] in prayer and says amen and and then he
[1:10:42] tells Peter launch out into the
[1:10:45] deep and I can imagine Peter start
[1:10:48] having a conversation with say now look
[1:10:51] it was a really good sermon and I
[1:10:53] enjoyed the words that you had to say
[1:10:56] but I've been out into the deep and
[1:10:58] there were no fish out there and I'm a
[1:10:59] fisherman I know when the tide moves a
[1:11:02] certain way we can get fish but right
[1:11:04] now there would be no fish so there's no
[1:11:06] need for us to go out into the deep amen
[1:11:09] and I can see him having his
[1:11:11] conversation with the Lord Jesus and
[1:11:12] then he finally realizes that you know
[1:11:15] what let me just yield to what he's
[1:11:16] saying so so so so so Peter says
[1:11:20] nevertheless at Thy word I'll launch out
[1:11:24] into the deep Hallelujah we need to stop
[1:11:27] wrestling with God Amen Let's Take God
[1:11:30] at his word
[1:11:31] nevertheless at Thy word I launch out
[1:11:35] into the
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:37] deep they launch out into the deep and
[1:11:40] then Jesus said why don't you just drop
[1:11:41] your net on this side and when he said
[1:11:44] nah all right I'm out here I might as
[1:11:46] well just drop the net on that side
[1:11:48] throws the net out and and when they
[1:11:50] went to pull the net in it almost
[1:11:51] brought the boat
[1:11:53] down it pays to be
[1:11:59] obedient that was his first encounter
[1:12:01] with the Lord Peter was a man that saw
[1:12:04] his mother-in-law healed in the
[1:12:07] very uh hour that Jesus prayed for Peter
[1:12:12] was a man that that did something that
[1:12:14] only the Lord Jesus did and I like this
[1:12:18] you know
[1:12:19] because uh Jesus that told the disciples
[1:12:22] go on over to the other side I I now
[1:12:25] don't know how Jesus going to get to the
[1:12:26] other side they're in a boat and they're
[1:12:28] headed to the other side but how's he
[1:12:29] going to come and before you know it
[1:12:31] here comes Jesus and I and here's the
[1:12:34] thing that I want you to get sometimes
[1:12:35] we miss this in scripture Jesus did not
[1:12:38] come walking on the water while it was
[1:12:41] calm it was it was a boisterous wind it
[1:12:44] was a it was a storm happening at the
[1:12:46] time and here Jesus comes walking on the
[1:12:49] water as if the storm had could not do
[1:12:51] anything to him my God but here's here's
[1:12:54] the beauty of it it wasn't Peter walking
[1:12:56] on the water without a storm it was
[1:12:59] Peter walking on the water in a
[1:13:03] storm at the most difficult time this is
[1:13:06] when Peter walks on the water he's the
[1:13:08] only man that shares that experience
[1:13:10] with the Lord
[1:13:12] Jesus he says if it Be You Lord if it
[1:13:14] really be you then bid me to come to you
[1:13:17] and and I like it cuz Jesus did not give
[1:13:19] Peter a quote Jesus did not give him a
[1:13:22] scripture Jesus gave him one word he
[1:13:24] gave him
[1:13:28] come you want to hear me say come then
[1:13:30] you going to have to take a step of
[1:13:31] faith and you're going to have to come
[1:13:33] and here comes Peter out the boat I can
[1:13:35] see him taking his time like one foot
[1:13:37] out and one foot in and just making sure
[1:13:40] that the water is going to hold him up
[1:13:42] and he I mean he's probably getting wet
[1:13:44] and everything like I don't I can't
[1:13:45] believe what I'm doing right now but he
[1:13:49] takes a step of faith and begins to walk
[1:13:51] on that water right to Jesus the only
[1:13:54] reason he sunk is because he took his
[1:13:56] eyes off the Lord Jesus and even when he
[1:14:00] cried Lord help me and God and Jesus was
[1:14:03] right there to save him I don't believe
[1:14:06] that Jesus picked Peter up put him on
[1:14:08] their shoulders and carried him back to
[1:14:09] the boat right I believe Jesus said now
[1:14:11] if you walked out here you can walk
[1:14:15] back Keep On Walking Peter and keep your
[1:14:18] eyes on
[1:14:20] me Hallelujah if I would have
[1:14:23] experienced that I'm talking about me if
[1:14:26] it was me walking on water and I can
[1:14:28] claim amen now I'm the only man that's
[1:14:31] ever done the same thing the Lord Jesus
[1:14:33] did in this I'm going to
[1:14:36] write I'm the chosen
[1:14:40] generation that's right yeah
[1:14:43] y the same Peter that walked on water
[1:14:46] and caught all these fish and saw his
[1:14:49] mother-in-law healed and saw some
[1:14:51] Miracles and he was there feeding the
[1:14:53] 5,000 4,000 I mean Peter was there he he
[1:14:55] did he did it all but the same Peter was
[1:14:59] told that before the crows you'll
[1:15:03] deny me three times before it throw it
[1:15:06] crows twice you'll deny me three times
[1:15:08] and people oh not me but just exactly
[1:15:11] what Jesus said happened to Peter and
[1:15:13] you can imagine the same man that walked
[1:15:15] on water same man that saw his mother uh
[1:15:19] mother mother-in-law heel the same man
[1:15:22] that that that caught all these fish is
[1:15:23] the same man that got so discouraged
[1:15:26] that he He Turned and wanted to walk
[1:15:28] away from the
[1:15:29] Lord wanted to walk away from everything
[1:15:31] that he
[1:15:35] experienced but when Jesus rose again
[1:15:37] Jesus said something very specific he
[1:15:39] says go tell my
[1:15:42] disciples and I love
[1:15:44] it and
[1:15:47] Peter go tell my
[1:15:49] disciples and Peter because he knew what
[1:15:54] Peter was going through he knew where
[1:15:56] his mindset was he knew how defeated he
[1:15:59] might have felt but go tell my disciples
[1:16:02] and Peter I'm going to meet him in
[1:16:05] Galilee I like to say it like this I
[1:16:08] don't care how much Peter
[1:16:10] fail and I don't care how much you fail
[1:16:14] your failures cannot disqualify you from
[1:16:18] sunship Hallelujah I want to say that
[1:16:21] again your failures cannot disqualify
[1:16:23] you from son
[1:16:30] shipl Peter was commanded to feed the
[1:16:33] sheep and feed the
[1:16:35] Lambs he was part of a generation that
[1:16:38] experienced the outpouring of the Holy
[1:16:39] Ghost at
[1:16:43] Pentecost but Peter writes ye are a
[1:16:45] chosen generation and I I want you to
[1:16:48] understand why Peter writes that it's
[1:16:50] because Peter Not only was he there
[1:16:53] experiencing the first coming of the
[1:16:56] Lord Jesus but Peter got a glimpse of
[1:16:59] the second coming of the Lord amen and
[1:17:02] the greatest event that will ever happen
[1:17:03] on the face of the Earth is the second
[1:17:05] coming of the Lord sir and and and and
[1:17:09] and and don't get me wrong I I I do
[1:17:11] believe in the broad coming of Christ
[1:17:13] and I believe in the word coming I
[1:17:14] believe in all of that but at the first
[1:17:16] coming of the Lord it was a literal
[1:17:19] person and we're looking for that
[1:17:20] literal person to come again praise the
[1:17:23] Lord amen here um uh Peter I want to
[1:17:27] just uh make mention that he um he was
[1:17:30] there and got a glimpse of the second
[1:17:32] coming as well as the you know he he he
[1:17:35] heard this from the Lord Jesus he also
[1:17:37] heard heard it from the angel of the
[1:17:38] Lord Matthew 17: 10-13 is what I want to
[1:17:42] refer to really
[1:17:48] quick this to me is a a very important
[1:17:51] scripture especially for uh this time in
[1:17:53] which we live
[1:17:57] um here the second coming of the Lord
[1:17:59] there's going to be a great Fallen away
[1:18:02] and uh we're seeing that right in our
[1:18:04] ranks there there are people falling
[1:18:06] away but as some are Falling Away God is
[1:18:08] restoring
[1:18:11] others so we don't keep our our
[1:18:13] attention on the ones that's falling
[1:18:15] away and and and and I'll be the first
[1:18:16] one to admit I'm going to say this amen
[1:18:18] I don't believe everybody that has
[1:18:20] fallen away are going to be lost amen I
[1:18:23] believe some of them are going to be
[1:18:26] restored I believe I believe the
[1:18:28] scripture says that they they really
[1:18:30] they're they're just they they've aired
[1:18:32] in
[1:18:33] spirit right but God say he'll bring
[1:18:36] them to an understanding so I trust that
[1:18:38] God will do that amen it says it in the
[1:18:40] book of Isaiah I believe they a those
[1:18:42] that air in spirit will be brought to an
[1:18:44] understanding so don't put everybody out
[1:18:46] don't put them all down just pray for
[1:18:48] the
[1:18:49] people amen but Matthew 17 uh this is um
[1:18:53] their on Mount transash figer
[1:18:55] and um and and you know after this great
[1:18:57] experience of s Moses and Elijah verse
[1:18:59] 10 says and his disciples asked him
[1:19:01] saying why then say the scribes that
[1:19:06] Elias must first come and look at this
[1:19:09] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:19:12] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[1:19:17] all things then he goes on to say but I
[1:19:20] say unto you that Elias is come already
[1:19:24] and they knew him not but have done unto
[1:19:28] him whatsoever they listed likewise
[1:19:30] shall also the son of man suffer at them
[1:19:33] then the disciples understood that he
[1:19:36] spake unto them of John the Baptist amen
[1:19:41] now um when when when when we look at
[1:19:43] that scripture you know we have to ask
[1:19:46] well which coming of Elias did the
[1:19:48] disciples understand was John the
[1:19:50] Baptist because I believe the one the
[1:19:53] coming that Jesus was talking about was
[1:19:55] when he said but I say unto you say unto
[1:19:57] you Elias has come already that's the
[1:20:00] Elias that they understood that it was
[1:20:03] John the Baptist but when Jesus said
[1:20:05] Elias shall truly first come and restore
[1:20:08] all things that was a different coming
[1:20:10] of
[1:20:12] Elijah if I can just be bold enough to
[1:20:15] say Jesus himself prophesied of brother
[1:20:18] Brandon's
[1:20:21] Ministry Jesus spoke of it so I asked
[1:20:25] the young man one time he you know he he
[1:20:27] he he wanted to straighten me up on the
[1:20:29] scripture because he was leaving the
[1:20:30] message you know and he wanted to prove
[1:20:32] this scripture it says you know even the
[1:20:34] Bible says they understood it was John
[1:20:36] the Baptist I said okay well you got an
[1:20:39] answer to who this the Jesus said
[1:20:41] elishah truly first come and restore all
[1:20:42] things you got an answer you think
[1:20:44] that's John the Baptist I think it's
[1:20:46] William Brandon but you think it's John
[1:20:47] the Baptist I said that's fine I said
[1:20:49] okay at least you got an answer cuz
[1:20:50] there's many people in denomination
[1:20:52] world would not even have an answer for
[1:20:53] that right I said but at least you got
[1:20:55] an answer I just think your answer is
[1:20:57] wrong but but it's okay you got an
[1:20:58] answer I said but now since you have an
[1:21:00] answer and you said and Jesus said that
[1:21:03] Elijah was going to come and
[1:21:05] restore all things then you have to tell
[1:21:08] me what did John the Baptist
[1:21:12] restore if John the Baptist is your
[1:21:14] answer you have to share with me what
[1:21:16] did he restore and here's the other
[1:21:18] thing you cannot tell me John the
[1:21:20] Baptist restore one thing because Jesus
[1:21:22] said that he was going to restore all
[1:21:26] things so the brother told me he says
[1:21:29] well I haven't studied that one I said
[1:21:31] okay I got it nothing no need to study
[1:21:33] it because John the Baptist didn't
[1:21:34] restore anything not even his baptism
[1:21:38] lasted beyond the book of
[1:21:42] Acts so this has got to be speaking of
[1:21:44] somebody else and then even in the book
[1:21:46] of Acts it says to the restitution of
[1:21:48] all things this is after John the
[1:21:50] Baptist ministry so this is another
[1:21:53] Elias that's supposed to come
[1:21:55] right this is the ministry of William
[1:21:58] Mari and
[1:21:59] brandom well I asked you the question
[1:22:01] what did John the Baptist restor and you
[1:22:03] have no answer well you should ask me
[1:22:05] the same question if I say that brother
[1:22:07] Brandon was the one that restore all
[1:22:09] things according to what Jesus said then
[1:22:11] you need to have that question what did
[1:22:14] he restore I got a couple answers for
[1:22:17] you the mystery of water baptism that
[1:22:20] was restored what really happened in the
[1:22:23] garden of
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:26] the original sin that truth was restored
[1:22:29] the serpent seed that was restored the
[1:22:31] godhead
[1:22:32] Jehova of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[1:22:37] the new that truth was
[1:22:40] restored the truth of marriage and
[1:22:43] divorce the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:46] without sensation no eternal hell the
[1:22:50] mystery of the Rapture the shout The
[1:22:52] Voice the Trump and we're in it right
[1:22:54] right now these things were restored by
[1:22:57] our
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:23:00] prophet he fulfilled exactly what Jesus
[1:23:04] said elijas would become would come and
[1:23:07] restore all
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:10] things and and there's so many more out
[1:23:14] there John the Baptist touched none of
[1:23:17] that joh he never preached any of these
[1:23:19] things but we know brother brandham did
[1:23:22] that's how we know that he is
[1:23:25] that the
[1:23:26] messenger oh my God as as John foran my
[1:23:31] first coming your message will forerun
[1:23:33] my second coming we know that's nothing
[1:23:36] but William Mary and
[1:23:38] Brandon and we're not saying that to
[1:23:40] worship him we say that to worship God
[1:23:43] it's just that we recognize how God has
[1:23:45] done things in this hour there's an
[1:23:48] order they had to recognize John in
[1:23:50] their day to get be prepared for the
[1:23:52] first coming we going have to recognize
[1:23:54] that Elijah for this day in order to be
[1:23:56] ready for the second
[1:23:59] coming Peter was there when these words
[1:24:02] were
[1:24:04] spoken Peter also was there in Acts 1:
[1:24:10] 8-11 says but ye shall receive
[1:24:13] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[1:24:16] upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto
[1:24:18] me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and
[1:24:21] in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts
[1:24:23] of the Earth and when he had spoken
[1:24:25] these things while while they beheld he
[1:24:27] was taken up and a
[1:24:30] cloud a
[1:24:34] cloud received him out of their
[1:24:37] sight a cloud did
[1:24:41] it it just kind
[1:24:44] of
[1:24:47] ironic that there's a cloud coming
[1:24:50] 1963 that actually formed the face of
[1:24:53] Christ with seven angels
[1:24:56] right and and and and and and and when
[1:24:58] science had no idea what it was oh my
[1:25:01] they they got it printed in in in in
[1:25:03] Life magazine and and and and they just
[1:25:06] they're just oh this mysterious Cloud
[1:25:07] mysterious Cloud but a prophet oh my a
[1:25:11] prophet comes to the church he does not
[1:25:12] go to the
[1:25:14] television station or to the radio
[1:25:17] station he doesn't go to any he goes to
[1:25:19] church and he reveals a secret to the
[1:25:22] people he says if you want to know what
[1:25:24] it is is they don't need to know but if
[1:25:25] you would just turn the picture to the
[1:25:28] right you'll see it's
[1:25:32] Christ it's Christ well look at what the
[1:25:35] what here here here's what the angel
[1:25:36] told Peter here in Acts one he says and
[1:25:38] when he had spoken these things which
[1:25:40] while they beheld and he was taken up
[1:25:41] and a clout received him out of his
[1:25:43] sight and while they looked steadfastly
[1:25:45] toward Heaven as as he went up behold
[1:25:47] two men stood by them in white apparel
[1:25:49] which also say ye men of
[1:25:51] Galilee why stand ye gazing up into to
[1:25:54] Heaven this same Jesus which is taken up
[1:25:57] from you into heaven shall so come and
[1:26:00] like man as you have seen him go into
[1:26:02] heaven Peter gets a gets a
[1:26:05] glimpse of the second coming of the Lord
[1:26:08] and some events that will take place at
[1:26:10] the second coming of the Lord and
[1:26:12] because of what Peter
[1:26:14] sees Peter
[1:26:16] writes ye
[1:26:20] amen woo because of what Peter sees
[1:26:24] Peter writes ye are a chosen generation
[1:26:29] that generation that's living during the
[1:26:31] time of the second coming of the Lord
[1:26:33] Jesus that generation is chosen
[1:26:37] hallu chosen for
[1:26:40] royalty brother
[1:26:42] brandom he uh uh makes a a statement
[1:26:45] here in the
[1:26:47] message the pma's vision excuse me one
[1:26:49] second
[1:27:02] um patma Vision he says
[1:27:05] this now notice before Jesus returns to
[1:27:10] earth now this is a little ahead of time
[1:27:12] but the spirit of Elijah will return
[1:27:14] back to the Earth and turn the hearts of
[1:27:16] the children back to the fathers I I
[1:27:17] just love that I love that the spirit of
[1:27:20] Elijah will return to Earth and is gonna
[1:27:23] do one thing turn the hearts of the
[1:27:25] children back to the fathers that mean
[1:27:27] our hearts go back to the
[1:27:29] word anybody anybody that tells you that
[1:27:32] you well I'm going have to leave the
[1:27:33] message and go back to the word oh my I
[1:27:36] don't know if you understood what you
[1:27:38] were following in the first place right
[1:27:40] the message is the word amen the the
[1:27:44] very the very purpose of the Prophet was
[1:27:46] to turn our
[1:27:47] hearts back to the
[1:27:50] word
[1:27:52] amen my how how can you miss it right I
[1:27:56] mean you you and and and as I read
[1:27:58] earlier if you if you reject one the
[1:28:01] messenger you rejecting Christ that's
[1:28:04] right amen it's just that simple this is
[1:28:07] how Christ did it this is this is how he
[1:28:09] operates amen look at what he says this
[1:28:12] it says the spirit of will return back
[1:28:13] to Earth and turn the hearts of the
[1:28:14] children back to the fathers the Bible
[1:28:17] said so Jesus saw him here the apostles
[1:28:19] saw him here the order of the coming of
[1:28:22] the son of man glorified he's be
[1:28:24] glorified and coming back the first
[1:28:26] thing before they saw him was what
[1:28:29] Elijah then what Moses Israel return y
[1:28:32] the lawkeepers and the glorified son of
[1:28:35] man Hallelujah do you see the order of
[1:28:36] his coming the spirit of Elijah or it or
[1:28:40] or the witness of the last Church age
[1:28:42] see coming in power to manifest
[1:28:47] him we talk about chosen for
[1:28:51] royalty and
[1:28:54] my mind and my heart goes back to one in
[1:28:56] the
[1:28:59] scripture certainly chosen for
[1:29:03] royalty but when he was uh
[1:29:07] chosen no
[1:29:09] one in his household believed that there
[1:29:13] was any royalty about him at all none
[1:29:16] whatsoever
[1:29:19] right a prophet has been told by God
[1:29:22] that Saul has been rejected is King and
[1:29:25] I got myself another king and you're
[1:29:27] going to find him in the house of Jesse
[1:29:30] and I want you to take your your oil and
[1:29:33] go down and anoint this next king God
[1:29:35] doesn't tell him when he's going to
[1:29:36] become king he just says he's the next
[1:29:39] king and I just need you to be obedient
[1:29:41] go down and anoint this this this this
[1:29:44] one of Jesse's Sons to be king now
[1:29:45] here's my thing if God could tell him
[1:29:49] what house to go to couldn't God also
[1:29:52] tell him which boy it was going to be
[1:29:53] right
[1:29:55] but God didn't do it that way he even
[1:29:57] the prophet has to walk by faith amen
[1:30:01] right so here he goes down there Amen to
[1:30:04] Jesse's house and and when he tells
[1:30:06] Jesse why he's there Jesse says oh my uh
[1:30:10] a king is coming out of my house oh
[1:30:14] Prophet look at this son right here the
[1:30:16] firstborn look at this boy I know he's
[1:30:18] the one come on pull your oil out on him
[1:30:21] and brings them before the prophet
[1:30:24] no
[1:30:25] oil the prophet looks say well even the
[1:30:28] prophet was so excited said this has got
[1:30:29] to be him he looks almost like Saul and
[1:30:32] God has a Tong say no no no no no no no
[1:30:35] don't look on the outward
[1:30:37] appearance I look at the
[1:30:39] heart I look at the heart not the
[1:30:41] outward appear but I look at the heart
[1:30:43] amen says okay well you next son number
[1:30:47] two number three number four and no oil
[1:30:50] no oil no oil I think they get all the
[1:30:52] way to seven no oil
[1:30:55] and do you realize that it was the
[1:30:59] prophet that had to suggest to the
[1:31:03] father now now isn't that something
[1:31:05] Daddy has has paraded all the boys
[1:31:08] before the prophet almost all of them
[1:31:10] and the prophet has to say do you
[1:31:14] have yeah that's right the prophet has
[1:31:17] to ask the question do you have any
[1:31:19] other sons and I can imagine maybe Jesse
[1:31:22] saying look now I know God told you to
[1:31:26] go to Jesse's house but there is another
[1:31:28] Jessie down the street and he does have
[1:31:31] some Sons it's it's possible that you
[1:31:33] got the wrong house because if none of
[1:31:35] these boys got any oil I can
[1:31:37] guarantee that the last boy that I go
[1:31:40] get there would be no oil on that
[1:31:44] boy we won't eat until you go get
[1:31:47] [Applause]
[1:31:49] them we're not going to eat till you go
[1:31:51] get them you go get them and I can see
[1:31:53] his brother go out to the field and
[1:31:55] David's there and doing his job watching
[1:31:57] over the sheep and and here comes one of
[1:32:00] his brothers and say daddy said come
[1:32:02] home he says come home no I'm watching
[1:32:04] the sheep and you know it's a it's a
[1:32:06] it's a shame for a Shepherd to lose
[1:32:07] sheep so I'm not going to leave these
[1:32:09] sheep he says boy just come home daddy
[1:32:12] wants you home now well why what's the
[1:32:14] hurry what's the rush why I'm out here
[1:32:16] taking care of the sheep why why am I
[1:32:18] Rush
[1:32:20] look the prophet said that God told him
[1:32:23] to come to Daddy's house and the next
[1:32:26] king was going to be in our house now
[1:32:28] all of your brothers have gone before
[1:32:29] this prophet and no oil has come out on
[1:32:31] anybody but daddy said to appease the
[1:32:34] prophet he wants you to come
[1:32:38] home okay and by the time David gets to
[1:32:41] the
[1:32:43] door I I can imagine that little oil
[1:32:46] container just
[1:32:49] started and everybody in the house was
[1:32:52] Witnesses of what was going on with that
[1:32:54] oil and they knew all of them coming
[1:32:56] nothing happened with that oil but all
[1:32:58] of a sudden David comes and the oil is
[1:33:00] just just my God like an eruption about
[1:33:04] to happen and and the prophet looks like
[1:33:06] this is the boy yeah this is the boy
[1:33:08] pour the oil down right on him everybody
[1:33:10] knew David had been chosen for
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:17] royalty
[1:33:19] hallu the anointing sits on us as the
[1:33:21] bride of Christ
[1:33:24] we've been chosen just like David was
[1:33:27] chosen the blood of Jesus Christ puts us
[1:33:30] in a certain position
[1:33:32] tonight it's not based on how we feel
[1:33:34] it's not based on our mistakes it's not
[1:33:36] based on our failures it's based on what
[1:33:38] God has already
[1:33:41] done and here's the beautiful thing I
[1:33:43] like about David you know when David
[1:33:44] went out to fight
[1:33:46] Goliath David was the only man in the
[1:33:50] Kingdom of Israel that could fight
[1:33:53] Goliath
[1:33:54] and not
[1:33:59] die had David died on the battlefield
[1:34:02] fighting Goliath God would have had to
[1:34:05] raise him back up because he was already
[1:34:13] [Applause]
[1:34:22] pre-anoxic had ordained for him to come
[1:34:26] and if nothing can stop David I'm here
[1:34:27] to tell you nothing can stop
[1:34:30] you my brother my sister nothing
[1:34:35] everything the devil threw at you could
[1:34:37] not stop you until you come into the
[1:34:40] place that God has for
[1:34:45] you Ephesians 1:4 through
[1:34:48] 7 according as he hath chosen Us in him
[1:34:55] before the foundation of the world that
[1:34:58] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:35:00] before him in love having predestinated
[1:35:03] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:35:06] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[1:35:08] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[1:35:12] of the glory of his grace wherein he ha
[1:35:16] made us accepted in the Beloved Amen in

[1:35:24] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:35:27] to the riches amen of his grace

[1:35:51] holy nation of peculiar people that ye
[1:35:54] should show forth the Praises of him who
[1:35:55] have called you out of Darkness Into His

[1:35:59] Royal means to be kingly royal means to
[1:36:02] be kingly or belonging to a King as his
[1:36:06] children yes Royal means to be
[1:36:10] kingly or belonging to a King as his

[1:36:26] The King as his children amen
[1:36:31] hallelujah let me just read just
[1:36:33] something
[1:36:34] here oh my my my brother Brandon makes a
[1:36:38] statement and I want to pick this up in
[1:36:41] Revelation
[1:36:43] 1 Revelation 1 15 and
[1:36:50] 6 and from Jesus Christ who is the faith
[1:36:54] witness the first begotten of the Dead
[1:36:57] the prince of the kings of the earth
[1:37:00] unto him that loved us and washed us
[1:37:02] from our
[1:37:03] sins in his own
[1:37:07] blood and the next
[1:37:10] verse and hath made us
[1:37:12] Kings Hallelujah and Priests unto God
[1:37:16] Amen and his father to him be glory and
[1:37:18] Dominion forever and ever amen Amen
[1:37:22] brother random makes reference to this
[1:37:24] scripture as he's explained it in the
[1:37:25] church age
[1:37:27] book um it says he hath made
[1:37:32] us he says oh there are certain
[1:37:36] truths we need to
[1:37:40] emphasize amen it says this is one of
[1:37:45] them
[1:37:47] he he hath made us salvation is his
[1:37:52] doing salvation is of the Lord all of
[1:37:55] Grace he redeemed us for a purpose see a
[1:37:58] people for a purpose he redeemed us for
[1:38:01] a purpose he bought us for a purpose we
[1:38:05] are
[1:38:06] Kings spiritual Kings oh we are going to
[1:38:10] be Kings upon the Earth with him when he
[1:38:13] sits on his throne but now we are
[1:38:15] spiritual Kings and we Reign Over
[1:38:17] spiritual Kingdom it says in Romans 5:17
[1:38:20] for If by one man's offense death Reign
[1:38:22] by one much more they which receive
[1:38:25] abundance of grace and the gift of
[1:38:27] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:38:31] Jesus Christ and I I like when he says
[1:38:34] that you know the scripture says that
[1:38:36] we're we're we're we we're Kings we're
[1:38:38] we're Kings he has made us Kings and and
[1:38:40] sisters I know sometimes that might be a
[1:38:42] little hard for the Sisters just walk
[1:38:45] into that because it's a masculine term
[1:38:47] but but but understand sisters we are
[1:38:49] brothers and we have to walk into a
[1:38:51] feminine term and we have no problem
[1:38:54] accepting it we are the bride of Christ

[1:39:39] quotes that I don't like to read by
[1:39:40] myself I like to have the church just
[1:39:42] repeat after me because this is
[1:39:44] something that you need to it's a it's a

[1:40:50] unto him worshiping him in spirit and in
[1:40:52] truth interceding and petitioning
[1:40:54] priests and Kings unto our God no wonder
[1:40:57] the world does not appeal to us and we
[1:40:59] are peculiar people zealous unto good
[1:41:02] works we have been recreated in him to
[1:41:06] be children like unto our father a
[1:41:10] couple other scriptures to solidify our
[1:41:13] place as
[1:41:15] kings Revelations 5:9 and 10 says and
[1:41:18] they sung a new
[1:41:20] song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the
[1:41:23] book and to open the seals thereof for
[1:41:25] thou thou was slain and H has redeemed
[1:41:27] us to God by thy blood out of every
[1:41:30] Kindred in tongues and people and nation
[1:41:35] and as made us as made us unto our
[1:41:39] God Kings and Priests and we shall
[1:41:44] reign on the earth Revelation 17:14 says
[1:41:48] this the shall make war with the lamb
[1:41:51] and the lamb Shall Overcome come them
[1:41:54] for he is Lord of
[1:41:56] lords and King of Kings if he's King of
[1:42:01] Kings who is who are these other kings
[1:42:04] that he's king of I think I see some of
[1:42:07] them here in Alberta
[1:42:11] tonight amen he's King of Kings Lord of
[1:42:14] lords and king of kings and they that
[1:42:17] are with him are called and chosen
[1:42:20] Hallelujah and faithful amen
[1:42:28] since we know that you are a king the
[1:42:30] scripture proves it the prophet has said
[1:42:32] it this is the place that God has called
[1:42:34] us to this is the place that the blood
[1:42:37] has brought us
[1:42:39] to I want to just mention these things
[1:42:42] as I bring my thought to a close
[1:42:44] tonight the conduct of a
[1:42:49] king even though a king is a a great man
[1:42:52] or great woman
[1:42:55] they make others feel
[1:42:58] greater
[1:42:59] am cuz Jesus the Creator he was the one
[1:43:02] that washed the the feet of the
[1:43:04] disciples him being king of kings and
[1:43:06] Lord of lords he still made them feel
[1:43:08] Greater by him taking the towel and ging
[1:43:11] himself and washing their
[1:43:15] feet other thing about a king is that he
[1:43:19] or she they look
[1:43:21] good even when they feel feel
[1:43:25] bad brother brandom told us about the
[1:43:27] king of England that passed through the
[1:43:29] land of Canada and how he was man he was
[1:43:31] so sick but he could not get into that
[1:43:35] Chariot and allow the people to see how
[1:43:37] ill he was so even when he felt ill he
[1:43:40] felt really bad somehow he still brought
[1:43:43] himself into that when he got into that
[1:43:45] Chariot he made himself look look like
[1:43:47] he was well and I want to tell you
[1:43:49] something you know um in the book of
[1:43:52] Nehemiah it was they could not come
[1:43:55] before the king with a sad countenance
[1:43:58] that's
[1:44:00] right so before you walk through the
[1:44:02] doors of the church I don't care what
[1:44:03] you've gone through somehow you got to
[1:44:05] shift your
[1:44:07] attitude cuz I cannot come into the
[1:44:09] presence of
[1:44:11] Kings with a sad
[1:44:16] countenance you got to look good even
[1:44:19] when you're feeling
[1:44:21] bad a King is the final
[1:44:31] Authority they sought to kill Jesus and
[1:44:33] they sought to kill Moses because of the
[1:44:35] king's
[1:44:38] edict in the days of Daniel he was not
[1:44:40] allowed to pray because the king had
[1:44:42] signed a
[1:44:43] decree saying that no one could pray out
[1:44:46] uh uh unless they were praying to Darius
[1:44:48] they couldn't pray to anybody else for
[1:44:49] 30 days and and and and the King was all
[1:44:52] he Oh my he was just so happy to to put
[1:44:55] this thing in writing and and then he
[1:44:57] forgot oh I got a friend of mine that I
[1:45:02] know will not obey this
[1:45:04] law and and and and and all the
[1:45:06] counselors they they went and after the
[1:45:08] king signed they went immediately to
[1:45:10] Daniel's
[1:45:11] house that's right we got the paperwork
[1:45:14] signed by the king now let's see what
[1:45:15] he's going to do and and Daniel here's
[1:45:17] what Daniel does he opens the
[1:45:21] windows brother he doesn't close
[1:45:24] I want you to see who I'm praying to and
[1:45:26] he gets down on his knees and he has the
[1:45:28] same prayer that he all we caught him we
[1:45:30] caught him we caught him we got him
[1:45:32] we'll take him right here to the king
[1:45:33] and when they get down to the king king
[1:45:35] you sign this EDI and you know um we
[1:45:38] caught Daniel praying to his God and you
[1:45:41] know your edict says if anybody get
[1:45:43] caught they got to get thrown into the
[1:45:44] lion's den and the King said oh no I
[1:45:46] can't believe I did this to Daniel but
[1:45:48] they told him said King remember that
[1:45:51] once a king signs it
[1:45:55] it's final and I want you to know that
[1:45:58] God has signed whatever promise that
[1:46:01] he's put in the scripture and it is
[1:46:03] final it cannot be changed it cannot be
[1:46:06] erased it cannot be removed what God
[1:46:09] spoke it must come to
[1:46:12] pass because the King has signed it in
[1:46:17] blood Darius went through the night
[1:46:19] fasting and praying for for Daniel and
[1:46:21] and my God delivered Daniel down there
[1:46:23] in that Lion's Den and Darius was the
[1:46:25] first one to meet him as the sun was
[1:46:27] Rising I don't know if it was like the
[1:46:29] sun here cuz sun go down at at like
[1:46:31] midnight and then come up at 5:00 in the
[1:46:33] morning if if Daniel had one of them
[1:46:35] Sons he didn't have to stay there that
[1:46:37] long but uh but but nonetheless here
[1:46:40] Darius gets down there says uh did your
[1:46:42] God deliver you say oh yeah don't worry
[1:46:44] God delivered me and put these Lions to
[1:46:47] sleep he couldn't
[1:46:50] believe God had done that for for his
[1:46:52] for for his buddy but he he realized
[1:46:54] that what he signed it was it was in
[1:46:56] writing another king uh that put
[1:46:58] something writing and and and um um just
[1:47:01] through his words oh hmon couldn't sleep
[1:47:05] one night and he says you know what I'm
[1:47:06] going to go in here and see the king
[1:47:07] because I'm kind of tired of this guy
[1:47:10] Mori I I I I I need something to be done
[1:47:13] about
[1:47:16] Mori here he comes into the king's
[1:47:18] chamber and and says who's that that's
[1:47:20] hymon oh hmon before you have a word let
[1:47:22] me say something
[1:47:23] okay says what would you do
[1:47:26] Hyman
[1:47:28] for someone that's done something for
[1:47:30] the king but they never
[1:47:32] got acknowledged what would you do well
[1:47:37] um if it were
[1:47:40] me um I would get the king's horse as
[1:47:44] nice as horse and I get the some really
[1:47:46] nice apparel and then I have a man you
[1:47:49] know one of one of the greatest men in
[1:47:51] in the Kingdom go before this man and
[1:47:53] and say this is how the king honors
[1:47:55] those that honors The King and I just
[1:47:58] have them walking through the city
[1:47:59] saying that and and that's what I would
[1:48:01] do cuz you know who else would be worthy
[1:48:04] of this honor than
[1:48:07] me he says I like that
[1:48:10] idea do that for
[1:48:14] Mory
[1:48:17] Amen brother you know I mean when the
[1:48:20] scripture says he knows how to make your
[1:48:21] enemies
[1:48:23] your foot
[1:48:25] stol Mori was not even expecting that
[1:48:27] but here comes hmon walking him through
[1:48:30] the city just this is how the king
[1:48:31] honors those that honor him I mean it's
[1:48:36] embarrassing but when the king spoke it
[1:48:39] there was nothing that anybody could
[1:48:41] do to stop it from coming to
[1:48:46] pass oh my my my my my my another thing
[1:48:50] about a king
[1:48:54] he keeps his head
[1:48:56] up in dire
[1:48:59] situations brother brandom tells us
[1:49:01] about
[1:49:02] this this this young man that came from
[1:49:05] Africa it was in the states right not on
[1:49:09] his own accord brought there to be a
[1:49:12] slave but when he came there even though
[1:49:15] he was slave away from his homeland he
[1:49:17] still conducted himself a certain way
[1:49:20] when all the buyers and Brokers would
[1:49:22] come by and they said well we want to
[1:49:24] buy that slave right there said no no no
[1:49:26] no no no no he's not for sale he's not
[1:49:28] for sale said well wow you feed him
[1:49:30] something different what's what's the
[1:49:31] matter with him put him up we want to
[1:49:33] buy him no no he's not for sale don't he
[1:49:35] will never be for sale well what is it
[1:49:38] about him say you know I used to have
[1:49:39] the exact same question that you had
[1:49:41] that's why I'm never selling
[1:49:44] him they told me said in the in his
[1:49:48] homeland the country that he's from his
[1:49:51] father is the king amen and he realizes
[1:49:55] he's the son of that father and he has
[1:49:56] to conduct himself even in a Land
[1:49:59] Unknown like the son of a king he'll
[1:50:02] probably never see his father again but
[1:50:04] he still conducts himself like the son
[1:50:06] of a
[1:50:08] king see a king has to keep his head up
[1:50:13] in dire
[1:50:15] situations brother random says this this
[1:50:18] is my last quote and we'll close
[1:50:20] here oh my my my my my my
[1:50:24] my in the message Jehovah jar brother
[1:50:27] brandom says what
[1:50:28] ought all our conduct to
[1:50:31] be not like the world but we should act
[1:50:34] like Sons and Daughters of God conduct
[1:50:36] ourselves like King's
[1:50:38] children not like slaves of
[1:50:41] fashion slaves of Fashions and slaves of
[1:50:44] passion and slaves of Pride we should be
[1:50:48] Sons and Daughters of God and act like
[1:50:50] it and conduct ourselves that way let
[1:50:54] our conversations and everything be
[1:50:56] seasoned with God's
