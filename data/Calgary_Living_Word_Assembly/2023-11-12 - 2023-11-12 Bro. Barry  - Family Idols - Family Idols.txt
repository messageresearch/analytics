traveling welcome home we just have a couple of requests we want to remember before the Lord as we go to him in prayer this morning I want to remember those who are still traveling the Elis and certainly thankful for the traveling Mercies in each one of our lives having the Downs returned from being in Ontario I trust it was a wonderful time away and uh sister Michelle Livy has a request she's had a pain in her side since yesterday and we know that the Lord can heal all of our diseases let's just go to him in prayer this morning if you have a need maybe just make it known with an uplift hand gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your goodness and your Tender Mercies towards each and every one of us Lord father this morning as we approach you we just want to thank you for the many many times in our life father that you have met the needs because we know that you have said that you would meet our needs Lord Jesus you wouldn't you wouldn't meet our wants father but we know that through meeting our needs many times our wants are looked after and we're so thankful father because you're that Mindful and Lord Jesus this morning we just ask that you would meet each and every need made known unto you this morning with an uplift hand father we pray that you would just meet those maybe who are meeting in their living rooms father or potentially watching this later and those people who are currently present we know that you're not bound by time or space and father we we thank you for that Lord and we just thank you for meeting each and every need this

pray amen amen God bless you musicians and each one thank you you have your Bibles this morning I would just like to read from Genesis chapter 2 we're certainly thankful for the the visitors in our midst sister Cheryl from Philippines where's sister Cheryl from Philippines right there God bless you [Applause] Sister Sister Cheryl pH me last night and asked if we were having service and if she was able to attend and she's visiting in Calgary for a couple of weeks and uh you want to be in service she didn't want to get away and go to a different country and a different place so that she could get away from service it's tremendous God bless you Sister we'd like to welcome the acuan family Navar family as well from Toronto uh they've moved here to Calgary and uh they want to call Calgary Living Word assembly their home we certainly want to say thank you and welcome brother celiz God bless you brother it's good to see you again amen Le will take a service or two coming up here uh we'll just work out the details and uh we're glad to see him back so just pray for him as the Lord moves on his heart and uh we just want to do everything we can to make our our new family welcome here God richly bless you Genesis chapter 2 we'll start reading with Verse 18 very very familiar scripture once again but uh we'll just maybe take a little bit of a different look at it this morning Genesis 2:8 says in the Lord God said it's not good that man should be alone I will make him and help meet for him many times we'll say a helpmate that's not what the word says that's right it's important to make sure that we understand that sometimes we can say something over and over and over again a certain way and we begin to create a narrative in our mind mind that doesn't line up with the word of God right the wife is not just a helpmate she's a help meat that means able to look after and out of the ground verse 19 out of the ground the Lord for Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof amen hallelujah and Adam gave names to all the cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found and help meet for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman amen because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked and the man and his wife and were not ashamed let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we thank you for the Revelation that you've given to your church Lord in this age regarding your word father we just ask that this morning once again father you would help us to not just read between the lines but Lord open our hearts to receive Revelation further about your word Lord that Lord Jesus we would recognize that it's a living word that it's a breathing word that it's actually a person and father that we're not praying to a second person or a third person we're praying to the person the Lord Jesus Christ this morning we ask you we invite you father to take your rightful position in our lives and in this service now father as we walk with you along the way speak to us father we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated certainly excited to be here once again thankful for the goodness of God in our lives Hallelujah I just love that song I speak Jesus amen because as a minister I'm sure that's what everyone who ever gets behind the the pulpit that's what we want is to speak Jesus we don't want to bring some new Fantastic some other idea we don't want to bring a revelation that God has given us that doesn't line up with the word of God we want to encourage the people towards Jesus Christ amen hallelujah just a few announcements before we get going today we have the communion service tonight and we have a prayer meeting on Thursday we have the youth meeting Sunday the 19th from 1: to 5 we have brother kre digs confirmed he's locked and loaded for December the 16th at 6 pm and December the 17th at 10:00 a.m. that's a Saturday evening and a Sunday morning we also have it confirmed with brother Andrew Glover and it sounds maybe a little bit crazy I don't really think I've ever done this before but we have him confirmed for August 16th August 17th and August 18th 2024 so if you want to put those dates in your calendar we actually have it noted on the website calendar as well and if there's any changes we'll certainly let you know um certainly excited to see what the Lord will do it's almost as though um you can see the evolution of of things at least I can anyways uh some of the people who were evangelists on the field for many many years have changed their positions and are not evangelizing So Much Anymore as pastoring um I know three or four evangelists many many years on the road evangelizing have become now pastors and uh that's their position a full-time pastor and I think I think it would be a tremendous uh tremendous schooling to be an evangelist for many many years and to step into the role of a pastor and and to know a lot of the things the issues the problems that you encounter with people and churches and pastors and and and co-pastors and deacons and all the stuff but you know what the Lord knows what we all need and uh I think it's just amazing to see those Brothers step into those roles because the the amount of experience they would have to be able to do their jobs and uh what I'm getting at is brother Wayne Lawson is no longer on the field uh traveling all over the world he does travel a little bit and he said he will still come and see us but probably not nearly as much as he did and uh the Lord's raised up new evangelists and we have you know brother Andrew Glover who is very similar in terms of ministry style and fully willing to put his shoulder to the wheel and come and and fellowship and I just think it's wonderful to see how the Lord moves in his body amen same thing happens with pastors and uh so one more thing that I want to mention before we get into the word is uh we have moved to an online uh directory for the church and we will send out details for that but it's a pretty uh tremendous uh little thing if you will uh some people are really adverse to change I know uh some people just like the paper copy they like the PDF copy and if that's your thing then we can certainly accommodate that it's very easy to do but for those who are interested it's an app and uh you'll be able to access all of the information for everyone in terms of what they want you to know um in the the church directory it's an app so uh it's online it's very easy to update and uh it'll be accessible to anyone who is a part of the assembly who signs in you have to sign in with your email and you have to actually create uh and register with it but we'll send out all the details I'll send it via WhatsApp for everyone who is interested and if you're not um please just let us know and we can get you a PDF copy as we have said so we'll have instructions for it and if you don't have a valid email address and you want to be a part of it please just let us know and we will make arrangements to get that to you sister Shelley Boer or uh my wife Lisa Johnson um can look after that are you happy this morning amen um I just got an inspiration on Wednesday and I just love it how the Lord does that today I want to talk about a little bit out of the exposition of the seven Church ages just to start with and uh I sent the quotes did you get them brother excellent excellent so you got the slides too or the pictures beautiful so we have uh I have two pictures that I'm going to show today just so in case you're wondering I don't have a formal slideshow PDF thing I'm I'm not there PowerPoint yet maybe one day but uh out of the exposition of the seven Church ages uh the saman church age we read this on Wednesday I believe um or maybe even last Sunday it all kind of Blends together after a while according to Romans 4:16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed amen and Paul puts himself and all believers under that designation because he says Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on to not only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promise as having to do with election or the choosing of God that's exactly what we have been saying these who are of the royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated forn of God and were in the mind of God and in his thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride Hallelujah and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ and so I just want to take from our scripture this morning we can see that the Lord God said it's not good that man should be alone and that was I would say uh uh maybe a shadow and a type of God wanting to manifest himself as well he didn't want to be alone either it wasn't good for God to be alone because we know in in John chapter 17 there was only one thing that we heard the prophet say that Jesus prayed for the one thing that he asked for the father all the rest of the prayer was a blessing on the on the Saints in the world but the one thing he asked for was Fellowship Jesus Christ asked for fellowship and God didn't want to be alone but here we have man now who is formed form Med Out of the Dust of the earth he still was masculine and feminine but where did the woman come from it came she came directly from the man she didn't come as a secondary product he didn't create her from the dust of the ground God took her directly from him and it's the same thing for the Bride of Jesus Christ today amen but looking at this this scripture here the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam it's verse 21 of Genesis 2 and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man he didn't just make her and then they just bumped into each other while they were doing their stuff in the garden they just fell in love one time God actually presented her to him amen and it just made me think brothers and sisters Paul said it but I believe it was God through Paul that said I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy and I want to present you as a chaste virgin unto God isn't that exactly like the same scripture that we saw manifest in man but that's the ending of it it goes from the beginning of the Bible right to the very end in 2 Corinthians where he says that he wants to present Who as a Chase virgin he's jealous with a Godly jealousy it's beautiful to think about you know in the quote that we just read he spoke about Galatians 3 I think it's important maybe just to touch on this Galatians 3:16 Says now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made so he made the promises to Adam and to all of the seed that Adam Abraham had sorry he he said saith Not andto seeds as of many but as of one and to th th seed which is Christ I think it's just a beautiful statement when we can see this I kind of messed it up I'll read it again now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made and he saith Not andto seeds not plural just like the fruits of the spirit it's not plural it's fruit and Seed Not seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ but many would say well brother Barry you're talking about how that seed is Christ Christ and sure enough it is but don't forget every scripture has a compound meaning and Revelation that seed is one body one bride he's not looking for a many membered bride he's only looking for one bride amen amen one body one mind one Accord one spirit and that Spirit can't be hers it's got to be his God bless you brother Cherry Sister Mary you know we're talking about this bride of Jesus Christ and we hit it on on on Wednesday and I just want to get into it today I think it's real important for us to recognize um I know we do but maybe sometimes it can it can just go through the wash I don't know what we get and what we don't get so I just want to try I just felt led to go back this way is what I'm trying to say you know we talked about how the the word of God through the spirit brother bam talks about Revelation to the Bride of Jesus Christ Revelation to the believer has to come by the Spirit by the Holy Ghost amen Revelation to the True Believer can never ever be overestimated overemphasized we can never ever talk about having too much Revelation according to the word through the spirit it can never happen and you know brother Bradon talks about how it will be a prophetic people someone with prophetic insight to be able to understand this word there's only one way we're going to have that prophetic insight and that is to have the Holy Ghost him himself it's not going to be being close to a prophet of our age it's not going to be being close to someone who claims to be prophetic and sometimes maybe they can hit it right and sometimes maybe they don't hit it right that's not going to be what does it for us it's got to be he the spirit of truth that comes to us and gives us this Revelation that gives us this insight into his Spirit but you know what happens is just before that like I said we can say the scripture we quote the scripture many times and the Lord God said it's not good that man should be alone and I will make for him an helpmate no it's a help meet someone who is able to meet the needs in that person's life not just a doormat not just a servant and here we have this talking about in the seven Church age book the exposition of the seven Church ages brother brandham says that this word will only be revealed to a special class of people and that's very true brothers and sisters I won't dispute that for a second but who is that special class of people many people would say it's the Bride of Jesus Christ and you're 100% correct about that are you the Bride of Jesus Christ because if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ then you will have his spirit in you it won't be his Spirit Plus you that's right you will die out we will decrease so he can increase it's not going to be I'm retaining parts of me so that we can just go together he's he's he's he's jealous over us with a Godly jealousy and what is it it's it's Satan and God Waring for our soul that's right and whoever we're willing to surrender to whoever we're willing to submit Our Lives to that's the one that's going to win he's a gentleman he's not going to come and break down our door and say I'm just going to storm the castle and I'm going to take you and put you over my shoulder and take you back to my castle because you're now my wife I've conquered you no he sends an invitation like a gentleman and we have the opportunity to come to that invitation yes or say no I'm you know I've got this I've got that you know maybe one day when I see uh the two prophets happen in Israel or I see uh a female president or maybe there's an American Pope I start to see all these different things happen then maybe I'll get right and do no it's all going to be happening and we're going to be missing it because we're trying to put something before the word of God that special class of people will be only amen for him amen they will only be interested in him and I know maybe some people might say brother Barry you're preaching to the choir what I want to do is encourage us brothers and sisters we're at the very edge the very ending of all time this is the culmination of all the ages this is what the prophet looked for we know that in Daniel the the the the the the word of God says that you know Daniel you got to shut it up you you got to seal it up it's not for you to know it's for a different people a certain class of people not someone that actually Puffs themselves up and says I I'm so glad I can say I'm a a message believer I've been in the message all my life everything good in my life I've never sinned maybe but do you have the Holy Ghost since you believe that's the critical Factor brothers and sisters if we're a special class of people then we're going to have the Holy Ghost that's it that's the differentiating factor doesn't matter where we come from doesn't matter who our parents are doesn't matter who our pastor was doesn't matter who our pastor is have you got the Holy Ghost what makes this people special it's got to be this Spirit of Christ Living in them amen it's got to be Christ in us our hope of glory amen we know that Christ the bride's husband he was willing to lay aside all of his glory all of his pride all of his rights and come down and just submit himself completely amen as a husband not as the Bride As the husband now I want to say this morning how many of us husbands are willing to set aside all of our pride all of our Glory all of our rights for our families and for our bride how many of us are willing to do that or or is our wife a help meet for us what makes this people a special class of people is is having humility in their lives truly having the spirit of Christ in their lives he's not going to share his glory with nobody Christ the husband is willing to lay aside all of his first estate to be mistreated and killed for who for his creation for everyone for all of the people in the Earth but only a special class of people is able to say wow I get that and even a more special class of people is able to say my he did that for me I'm willing to accept him at his word whatever that means if he says lay down your life that I'll lay down my life if he says quit your job and sell everything you've got in this country and move to another country because I'm leading you then I'll do that if he says do whatever I I'll do it I'm willing to do what he wants because that's what he did he followed his leadership the leadership that he was given but to be this special class of people I think it's beautiful do our lives show show to the world around us that that we are the special class of people I think that song is Beautiful once again I just love how the music happens I got tied up in the back there just a little distracted and I wound up not coming out when the song leader said and the last song that he sang he's changing me is he changing us today brothers and sisters the love of God shown to the world what is that song saying the love of God shown to the world is that Jesus came and died at Calvary no I want to say that that song is saying the love of God shown to the world is Christ in you the hope of glory amen as we live our lives we're showing Christ the hope of of Glory to this world around us but he's got to be changing us we cannot be who we were yesterday we might not be who we going to be tomorrow but who are we right now is he doing something for us now our lives have got to show that he's changing us and I say this brothers and sisters it's pretty easy to put on the Polish and go to church and show our brothers and sisters and say yeah man he's changing me I've got this and I've got that I got the other revelation but what's happening at home what's our home life like is is our spouses saying that we are changing that God is changing us or or are we saying wow man I just can't believe it we we still aren't having a congruent message there's still something just a little bit funny it's just not lining up you know I would say if that's what we're seeing don't give up take courage because the devil's fighting you know we heard from the prophet we're going to have to fight for every single inch of ground that we get we're not going to get it freely character that we're going to have to cross over into Glory with to have these bodies changed here it's a victory it's not a gift we have to overcome all of this life to be able to get there but what do we do brothers and sisters I want to give us a key a secret brother bradam calls it and that secret is simple alls we've got to do is dial to ourselves and let him live in us and when he lives in us there's identifiable markers amen and until we see those living out through us just keep pressing on and I think once we get to the place where we can see them it's going to just be easy for us to actually live them but you know we all struggle we all struggle yes I'm not saying we don't it's a battle and God allowed it to happen this way so that he could manifest his power through a certain class of people through a special class of people that would be able to say I believe that word and I'm willing to allow him to live it out through me amen you know the troubling part is and this really is is when people try to live it out themselves yes cuz you can live it out for days and weeks and months and years maybe even decades but eventually if you're doing it God will allow it to come to the surface to show that it's just you and that's the way it is but when it's him he will do it in such a way that nobody will ever be able to say anything about it because the word of God says take no thought for what you should say in that hour when they will revile you when they will come and persecute you for my name's sake the devil will do it through people like we've said over and over again you know when we get into The Squeeze In Our Lives it's just going to show who's on the inside that's what's going to squeeze out what's going on in our lives we're going to show it we can't hide it but you know if if we're not seeing the right person come out when the squeeze happens just take courage I want to encourage us this morning I don't want to beat us up and make us feel bad I'm saying all of this to say brothers and sisters keep pressing on because there is a delivering power for every single disease that we have in our lives he took 39 stripes for all of our diseases God formed the man out of the ground and caused a deep sleep to fall upon Him upon man so that he could take a bride out of his side right out of him a part of him you know one of the things that uh I just think is amazing when we look at this this whole entire discussion is to recognize that the only reason we we would be ever classified as a special class of people is because he did it all Hallelujah yes sir and when we recognize that brothers and sisters there's no way there's no way if we truly recognize it that we could ever be puffed up ever because we recognize what he's done for us right some people have to go and seek it some people seek out the the life they seek out a better life and they go to church and they have good works and they do all the things but they'll never be able to just be freely given the invitation that you've been given that we've been given to call be called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb that's why when we read that scripture in Revelations let us rejoice and be very glad for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife not bride anymore his wife that means there's already been a consummation there's already been a relationship there's already been an intimate relationship that's happened his wife hath made herself ready we've got every single reason to Rejoice brothers and sisters you know we've been talking about possessing our enemies Gates and and we know that it only comes to Revelation that's we've gone on and on about it and and I think that we could just continue to do so but I don't really want to so far this morning I just want to touch on it for a second because I think it's so important to just remember how this can all sort of maybe stitch together we we know that it only comes through Revelation and the revelation of God's word and that revelation we talked about earlier it only comes by the Holy Ghost In Our Lives there's no way that we're ever going to study our way into it there's no way that we're going to ever tenure our way into it I was born in the message I had a tremendous message Pastor you know what happens when that happens is Ty Al we can wind up seeing that Pastor have uh human parts they have human fail abilities God will allow that to happen to cause us to stop looking at a man and to start looking at him but you know I heard it said the other day I was shocked I'd never really thought of it this way and I say Lord help me I mean I know where I stand in my heart don't get me wrong but just for the record I want it to be said you know how we hear it said there's three kinds of Believers in every church and I'm sure that we could all say Amen to that I don't want everyone to start looking at everyone and saying who's who in the zoo don't do that just say everyone's a Believer that's all because that's really the way it is but I heard a brother say it that you know that doesn't just apply to the congregation to the Ley that applies to the preachers I thought my goodness shocked me I know where I stand I'm not afraid because I know God called me and I trust nobody here is afraid but you know that's what happens sometimes people find themselves in a position that they shouldn't really be in and when they're in a position that they shouldn't be in they can cause a lot of hurt they can cause a lot of Shame they can cause a lot of tragedy that doesn't need to happen I thought my goodness the pastors the preachers i' never thought of that before even right but I can I can see where it would be true right but what happens when that happens sometimes we can get something in our life that will cause us to stop growing to stop changing because what happened was a minister hurt us a minister hurt my family a Ministry caused this or didn't do that stop looking at Ministries brothers and sisters don't look at Ministries they won't save you that's right they'll take you down right look to christu look away to Jesus right amen yes you know brothers and sisters I said it earlier I always do it but you know when we get a revelation about the word when God speaks to us I trust that everyone here has had a revelation about the word where you can sit down and read the word and and something just doesn't make sense to you and you just ask the Lord what does that mean and he reveals it to you personally I trust that's happened if it has never happened just ask him and and it will happen but you know when we get Revelation like that brothers and sisters there there's there's a reason for it it's not just a personal idea that we get it's not something that we just learn or or study and and someone speaks to us sometimes God will use that but more times than not it's going to be in the heart he's going to talk directly to the heart and we're going to be able to catch a revelation about it it's not just a personal idea yet it's it's not just a thought that's expressed by a word right where somebody preaches and then suddenly we get this Revelation this Mighty Revelation you know was a prophet that used a bunch of words which were thoughts expressed he said it that that a word is a thought expressed and works are Faith expressed and and you know we can take and go a long ways with that but I just want to say it this way a a word is a thought expressed and that is not a revelation and and having a word expressed because we've had the thought doesn't mean that we've truly got a revelation because a lot of people can quote quotes a lot of people can say jesus' name a lot of people can claim the word of God and the blood of Jesus but how many people live the word of God and live the life of Jesus Christ that is the identifiable marker it's the lital life of Jesus Christ brothers and sisters it's not some some polyana doctrinal thing that we're talking about here we're talking about Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever where they'll write a book of Acts behind you not just some Minister not just behind brother Andrew Glover or Wayne Lawson behind you behind your children because they saw you lay down a Godly example the life that you live in church is the life you live at home and the life you live at home as a life you live at work as parents children are watching you you can say all you want but what do you say around the dinner table what life example do you give them do you come to a communion do you take them to communion do you go to church on Wednesday nights are they seeing the Gospel of Jesus Christ according to our day live before their very eyes because if they are they're going to say my goodness there's Believers and when they hear their friends say there's no such thing as God Jesus is just like bunny rabbits Jesus is just like Santa Claus the children will say no he's not how do you know cuz he's alive and he's alive right here in my heart I know him personally I've repented I've been baptized in jesus' name and I know I don't have sin I know I fall all the time I fail all the time but that doesn't matter because he's jealous over me with a Godly jealousy and he's gonna present me one day as a chased virgin to his father it's not just about expressing words it's about living life the literal life of Jesus Christ yes out of 1961 0416 Abraham and his seed after him Amen brother brandom says justification is what you believe sanctification is what the blood did for you you're Sanctified by believing but when you're filled with the Holy Ghost it's the person of the Holy Ghost himself oh the person not imagination not some kind of psychology but the person of the Holy Ghost amen and to you my Christian Science brother and you that don't believe that the Holy Ghost is a person he is a personal pronoun in a day and age where we need to make sure that we are clarifying we're bringing into Focus we're sharpening the lines and making sure that we're crossing the te's and dotting the eyes we want to make sure this is very clearly documented here he is a personal pronoun Hallelujah a person the man Jesus Christ and it's important for us to recognize brothers and sisters we're not talking about the Nazarene the Nazarene was a part of the godhead who is seated at the right hand of the father right now but his Spirit when he died and went up to sit down he set back upon men and and manifested in in the upper room where the 120 were gathered together following his instruction wait in jerus Jerusalem T ye there until you are endued with power from where from on high from that seat right beside the father Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is a person he's a personal pronoun the Bible said when he the Holy Ghost has come he will testify of me he is a person not a thought so we're not going to actually say I believe Jesus I believe the message of the hour and then run home and live a certainly different life life than what we live in the church that's not going to work because that's not Jesus but you know brothers and sisters I'm here this morning to try and encourage us find that life if you haven't found that life find that life and you know the way you find it is Just Surrender yourself to him maybe for many years we've had an intellectual understanding of this message of the hour and we know the quotes and we know the message but maybe just not an actual living person breathing in our lives where we can say I am so glad I can say I'm one of them when we are it changes us when we are this book becomes a new book I'm so thankful for this book you know I I I have this book here I just thought I would take a moment to to mention it's pretty neat uh I saw a brother who had a Bible a family bible one time and uh I thought my goodness that's pretty cool I'd love to get one of those one day and you know I just uh I find myself in this position here as pastor and my family finds myself here in this position as pastor and my family is watching and and and and wondering you know scratching their heads thinking what happened to him like how did that ever happen and and some of my family might think well a girl came along and Drug him to church and you know he just is after the girl but I think if anyone has ever in my family listened to me long enough via YouTube they would understand that it's it's probably a little bit more than just a girl but anyways in my heart I wished you know I thought Lord I think that' be so neat to have a family bible my aunts they live in the the Lower Mainland um of course through my mom who's streaming probably right now uh she told them my family knows that I'm a pastor and uh one of the ants said you know what I've got a Bible that he might want maybe I should give it to him my mom said well I don't know why don't you ask him so we're at my mom's 80th birthday party recently and I got to see both of my aunts which I don't see very often and both of them said we each have a Bible we'd like to give you if you'd want them one of them is from 1891 from from my mom's mom's side of the family and this Bible here is from my mom's dad's side of the family and this Bible was actually presented to the the I think it's the United Church in Scandia Alberta because he moved a church from Saskatchewan this is my mom's grandfather by the way he moved a church from Saskatchewan to Scandia Alberta and the church presented this Bible to him as a as a token of appreciation and I thought that was pretty amazing so anyways I I just I'm so thankful for the word of God and sometimes to look back at our heritage it's it's a wonderful thing you know and and to be able to look at it and see that you know you know he he will always have a representation in in his season in his time and and to just take the word of God you know many people I'm sure have looked at this word of God and and said you know yeah it's the word of God but some people look at it and say it's it's it's more than life to me it's not just a book it's not just something we put on the shelf and I'm not going to belittle the fact that maybe other people didn't see the significance of it what I want to say is thank you to the people that were willing to actually give it to me because I truly value this and really appreciate it I love to look at the other Bible which is just about worn out it's it's a smaller one and it's just about worn out to look at it and think about how many nights of of pleading prayer for needs that were in their lives some of the the there's notes inside of it that are folded up they're handwritten in cursive talking about end during the hard Winters and some of the things that they had to go through because they are all in the same area in that town Scandia you know as Pioneers in in this country in like the early 1900s to hear about that and and to have that same Bible that they packed back in that day that's where women dress like women and and men dress like men and and they behave just a little bit differently and to still have that Bible and think my goodness it's the same word of God it's the King James version and that's what they studied even in the United Church my goodness amen I thought it was wonderful so now I'm going to get into something that I want to be clear I'm not trying to make anything an an idol so don't get me wrong I just think it's wonderful to see the the book and it's just got a real significant value to me and you know what the end of the day if something happened if we had a fire at our house and this Bible was lost it wouldn't turn me away from the word of God one bit because I've already eaten the book I've already eaten this entire book I got every word squished down in there and you know it was bitter sometimes in my belly but but it it was sure sweet in my mouth and and I just love it so thank you to anyone who had parted given me this Bible I really appreciate it it's a wonderful thing you know I want to talk this morning a little bit about uh family Idols as well I want to talk about Idols that we can raise up in our lives and uh you know something even like this Bible could become like a family Idol to say that I worship it and you know we want to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ but we want to worship the life that's inside this Bible we don't want to worship ship the Bible and say I have to cherish it and set up a shrine for it because that's actually going to be idolatry we're looking to a book instead of looking to the author and that's what we want to do brothers and sisters is look to the author and I just want to say this morning that that it's possible for us to actually create an image in our lives we can erect an image in our lives that will get in the way from us being able to see the truth in our day and you know many different ways of doing this we can we can idolize our parents we can idolize our grandparents parents can idolize their children you know what Satan doesn't care what we idolize so long as it's actually being just put before God because we know that's what the word of God says in the book of of Leviticus I think it is maybe it's Deuteronomy uh you know what Thou shalt have no other gods no graven image before me you one of the Ten Commandments we're very familiar with it we we should put nothing before the word of God if we do ever put anything before God in our lives it's idolatry it's actually making it idolatry brothers and sisters we could take the message of the hour and make it idolatry because we're not here to study and learn about a messenger we're here to study and learn about the one who sent that messenger the god of William Maryam brandham that's the one who died on Calvary for us we've got to be very careful the devil doesn't care what ditch we go into one way or the other so long as we're not right down in the middle we know that we talked about it there is a way there's a highway and there is a way brothers and sisters if we miss that way we're going to miss where we want to get off of this highway that way is a way of Holiness that's what the word of God says we preached about that a while ago but we can idolize things in our lives that will actually get us away from being able to see the true life the person that we just talked about in that quote of Jesus Christ Living out through US amen you know many times as a parent we can say I I'll say this by experience you know that's the way I was raised and I turned out fine so it must be just fine for my children I I must be able to do that it'll work and I turned out fine didn't I and we can do that right we can do it to our spouse we can do it to our children we can do it to ourselves in the mirror don't I look great oh yeah I turned out perfect knowing full well that we haven't that we're actually quite messed up but we're just afraid to look at that in the mirror and really admit that not that our parents mess us up I'm not saying that but what I'm saying is just because our parents did something a certain way it doesn't mean that we should and if we're willing to say that I'm going to do what my parents did before I'll do what the word of God says that becomes idolatry in our lives and if we do that brothers and sisters if we have idolatry in our lives that's where we stop the power of God from coming through and living out through us right and and our children will see it our spouses will see it as long as that image is there it'll get in the way I got into this this thinking about idolatry and I thought maybe I was going on a tangent on a crazy tangent here and I never want to do that but I just got thinking about it you know it's okay to have a an image it's okay to have an idea it's okay to have something in our lives I'm not saying that we shouldn't have family tradition that we shouldn't have things in our lives but sometimes like I said it can get in the way of the word of God as long as whatever that image is or that idea is that we have in our lives maybe it's a tradition as long as it doesn't supersede the word of God it's all right amen but like I said many times we can say it's worked all good for my parents it's worked all good for their parents it's worked all good for the brothers and sisters everybody's doing it it's just fine is it does it match up with the word of God I remember brother Ken teaching it many times take whatever is we think we know or that we believe according to the message of the hour and run it back to the word of God if it doesn't line up with the word of God brothers and sisters put it on the Shelf leave it alone because it's not right it's got to be according to the word of God just as we said this morning sometimes we can say helpmate right we can begin to say I've got a helpmate that's what my wife is she's my helpmate and maybe she is but is that what the word of God says I help meet someone able to help you specifically and I would go so far as to say she should come directly from your side she should literally be a part of you and I'll say it this way also brothers and sisters if you do consummate the marriage then she has then she is the Two Become One amen and how does that manifest it's simple born in sin shaped in iniquity comes into the world speaking lies if you and your wife your your wife and your husband you come together to become one flesh how does that happen you have a baby now the Two Become One You're creators power of creation is in your hands you're not just a normal being on this Earth you're the highest level of Life the highest form of life in the universe a human being the only thing is you've been given the ability to create the wrong way that's why a baby is born in sin shaped in iniquity comes into the world speaking Lies We we were we were created to have the spoken word birth but I think it's beautiful because we can say there's some people in this world today that are having that spoken word birth they hear the Vindicated prophets speak they hear the voice of a Vindicated prophet and they recognize that's a man's voice but there's something about that voice there's something behind that voice there's something different about what this man is saying brothers and sisters that's a spoken word birth when you can say a Amen to that word and take it into your womb you become a spoken word seed Bride As we talked about earlier in the message this morning you know sometimes we can we can take these ideas and and these these Idols that can pop up in our lives and and and sometimes it's hurts we can make an image out of a hurt we can say that I've been hurt so bad that I could never go back to that thing or that way or that place or that person or whatever it is we can have those hurts and they go very very deep and they become an image in our lives if we're not careful can we go and see that brother or that sister ever again can we go and fellowship with them and just have lunch or supper or whatever and everything will be fine can we go and fellowship with them because we're going to do that in eternity we're not going to be in separate places with a big wall fixed between us there's nothing in the word of God that talks about that the word of God talks about how there's going to be no need of light in the city because the light of the Lamb will light the entire city there's going to be streets of transparent gold the prophet talks about it in future home that the houses are going to be made out of transparent gold we're not going to have fences and walls and camps and and groups we're going to fellowship with one another because why because we're going to be of one body of one mind of one Accord one Spirit one bride it's not going to be multi- multi Brides but sometimes we can take these hurts that happen in our lives and make images out of them and you know one of the biggest ones is to see our parents hurt as children and to let that hurt take over and we create an image in our lives of this hurt and we'll say we'll never let that happen in our lives and we'll lead a guarded life and everything that we do will always be according to that image that we have set up in our lives you know sometimes it's just an individual thing someone hurts me and I'll never you can put in whatever it is that goes with that because that person hurt me I'll never whatever that is that's not the spirit of Christ that's an idol that pops up in our lives and we know it's fear because we don't want to get hurt nobody wants to get hurt but you know the spirit of Jesus Christ that person that we were talking about not the Nazarene the Holy Ghost himself when he comes to town he changes everything in our lives and you know if you look back in in the Old Testament there was times where kings were raised up and they raised up Groves and they created high places if you think about those Brothers and sisters nowadays shadows and types of the Old Testament towards the New Testament shadows and types of of Our Lives we can set up Groves and and Groves what's a Grove a Grove is an area with trees to protect where they're going to be doing something inside a nice Grove of trees so that you can set up a high place and that high place can have that image or that hurt or that thing that will keep you and every single time something comes up in your life you'll say you know maybe we should do this or an invitation to do that but you'll say but what about that thing and you'll always run everything through that thing because that thing is there but you know God allowed for Kings to be raised up in the Old Testament also when those Groves were created and those high places to be there where they would come in and tear down the Groves and they would knock down the high places and they would say there's one king of kings and Lord of lords and that's the mighty Jehovah that's the God I serve I'm not willing to tolerate these Idol even though they're my fathers I we know there's testimony in the Bible of Kings doing that taking Daddy's Idols smashing them down right and boy oh boy Daddy doesn't like that none too much don't do that you can do whatever you want but don't smash the idol don't smash the family Idols right yes you know what they are brothers and sisters they're stumbling blocks that's right they're stumbling blocks and the devil is not afraid to get us looking at stumbling blocks and the worst part is the devil wants us to make stumbling blocks if he can get us looking at them he can get us making them because we start to see a stumbling block what what's a stumbling block we can look at anything but you know we we just want to go back to the word of God we talk about that we know the story of bam and baac we know it very clearly we're not going to preach the whole thing but we know that that's what happened with with it and and and baac could not get balum to sin he couldn't get balum to go and actually curse the children of Israel even though he paid them and and he he he appreciated him and and he did all these wonderful things to try and exalt him and and every time this Prophet would actually he was a backslid prophet every time he would go and ask God how can I curse these people I want to do something I've got a great opportunity God can't you see it brother bradam says don't try and change God's mind when you pray brothers and sister he says ask God to change my mind when we see a person with a problem problem and we pray God change that person we're doing it wrong we need to say God change my heart and when he does that person will automatically become different to us but balam and baac that whole story if Satan can't get you to look at and fall a at the front of a a situation or a person he'll get you to look at the backside because every person and situation has got a backside everyone that's the way this world is created every single one and he loves loves to get people looking at the backside of people and you know what if you want to see negative you're going to see it if that's what you're looking for that's what you're going to find but I want to encourage you to look for the Lord Jesus Christ look away to Jesus brothers and sisters if you can look away to Jesus all the rest of this is just going to be static we're going to hear our brother say something and we'll say he didn't mean that we'll hear our spouse say something we'll say she didn't mean that well we'll hear our children do something and well no they didn't mean that they're just children they just need to be picked up and dusted off it's up to us as parents to do that not to kick them out and say they're they're not our children anymore yes amen if you want to see the bad that's all you're going to see brothers and sisters if you're always critical it will always get in your way yes criticism will always be your stumbling block and the troubling part is when you have a critical spirit because that's what it is it's going to cause stumbling blocks for other people yes because the critical spirit can never shut up right and you know it just made me think about it there's a time in our life where we need to remember brother Cadre Dig's Doctrine and brother Cadre Dig's Dogma call it forgive me brother but he said it very clearly that there is a shut your mouth Ministry and we need to get a hold of that sometimes and recognize that that's the best thing that we could ever say is nothing and just go away on our knees and pray and ask the Lord to deal with the situation because I can't do it I can't make it better there's no way that I could make it better especially if I'm carrying around dragging around a critical spirit criticizing everything that's going on Lord have mercy you know turn with me over into Genesis 31 I just want to point something out here amen sometimes we don't even have mistakes sometimes we can actually deliberately do things and as children if we're not careful if we don't get the Holy Ghost on our own then we are liable to wind up doing what Rebecca did here I'm just going to read one verse here uh for the sake of time I'd recommend if you want to go and read the whole story but in Genesis chapter 31 verse 30 we have the story of laan Rebecca Leah all their children and Jacob jaob Jacob finally left he got fed up and and left and went on his way and his wife did something verse 30 says and now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou SAR longest after thy father's house yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods yeah so what I want to just point out here brothers and sisters is that Rebecca she loved Jacob a and she wanted to be with him they had a conversation about it when he told her his revelation God actually called him back to the the the Homeland he didn't just get up and go and say I'm fed up with Laban even though he was fed up with his father-in-law in the whole story but God called him back deliberately and in doing so his wives loved him and and wanted him to love them and and as they went what was this that we're talking what are we talking about here is that Rebecca took Daddy's Idols Rebecca brought with her her parents' gods and you know brothers and sisters if we're not careful we can take our parents God's and make them our own and we'll take them into our marriage and it will become a part of our marriage it will become a part of the fight that we fight when we get into stuff at our marriage because one thing is for sure for those people who who are married you probably don't know already I'm just being factious but but you know know that it's always there's going to be problems there's going to be conflict it's the way it works we're human beings I I don't know some people might say we've never had a conflict before in our lives but I would want to dispute that and say really ever because unfortunately when Rachel I said Rebeca I apologize I meant Rachel forgive me you're 100% right I'm wrong Rachel but we can actually take idols and make them our own when they're not she didn't even give her husband the opportunity to create his own Idols did she and look at what was happening this reproach he was searching all of their camp and he was hot not only did he take off which was you know the way that he did it but God called him but he actually wound up by vicariously taking his gods and and and his idols and and so what I want to get to is that that she stole her father's gods and as the husband he was responsible for her and he had no idea that's right so if we have one of our parents gods in our lives brothers and sisters we could be bringing that into a marriage which will cause conflict and one of the other spouses might not know it but what we'll do is we'll be contending with this image for years sometimes decades and not even know it but I want to say it today if you've got an image other than Jesus Christ in your marriage Smash It Down get rid of it don't take any of your parents' gods and I would say it here I would invite any parent here that would disagree with me I'm not trying to make a challenge but I want to make sure that we're all on the same page here that I'm not preaching something false what parent would want to say that we want to set up an idol for our children to carry around we want our children to get to Jesus Christ don't look at me even as a parent there comes a point in time children where you have the the the the point of accountability where you have to know Jesus Christ yourself yes cuz one time in my life in my family's life Daddy might not be here you're going to have to make it on your own you're going to have to trust in the Lord with all of your heart and lean not unto your own understanding when you've got difficult decisions to make oh but in all of your ways acknowledge Him and what will happen he'll direct your Pathways he'll show you the way as children we can desire to keep a family Idol and make it supersede the word and I I just had that word keep coming back to me it's not out of the scripture and I don't even think it's in the message but I got into beekeeping this year and some things the natural they they kind of go along with the spiritual and if anybody understands what what happens in a beehive is sometimes the queen excuse me the queen bee doesn't do what she's supposed to do and God has created these bees to understand that if that queen bee isn't performing then they will actually go and hatch out another bee and actually feed it what they call Royal gel B and they will create a superseding cell and and what that is is another queen bee they're raising up to supersede the queen that's not performing if we have something in our lives that's superseding the word of God brothers and sisters we need to make sure that we get rid of it amen nothing should supersede the word of God the word of God should supersede everything else in our lives and the meaning of supersede so you understand what my heart is is to take place of a person or thing previously in Authority or in use we don't want an idol to start superseding in our lives start superseding the word of God start superseding what we know we should do we want it to be the word of God yes amen but we know it that God will not be in a relationship with someone who is not completely true to him he just won't he knows when we're bluffing right he knows knows when we're willing to hold on to an idol he knows when we're willing to say you know what I believe but I only go so far he knows that and so does Satan and Satan loves it when we stay there when we stay there that's where we become the most miserable people in the world but when we're so glad that we can say we're one of them I'm sold out you know brother Ram tells that story about how he asked that sister sister how long have you had the Holy Ghost how how many people get uneasy if somebody says that to you how long you had the Holy Ghost for he says that sister she said oh Lord she gets excited and says I remember I've had the Holy Ghost for 75 years she's 80 plus years old I've had the Holy Ghost for so long in my life I remember exactly where and when and I remember when my life changed when God revealed that to me it should cause excitement it shouldn't cause uneasiness it shouldn't make us un unsure it shouldn't make us weary it should give us the ability to say Amen I know I know I might not know exactly where or when but I know I got it and how do I know I got it because I say Amen to the word and that amen doesn't mean that I just go to church it means that I live it we will say we know him but not necessarily able to say it intimately we read it earlier you know 2 Corinthians 11:2 for I'm jealous over you with a Godly jealousy can you imagine a Godly jealousy that's not religious jealousy by the way that's not saying that the pope is going to send one of the guards the Swiss guards to our door and that's not saying the deacons are coming around that's not godly jealousy Godly jealousy is a supernatural jealousy and and he will not allow us to go certain ways he will not allow us to do certain things and I would say this Godly jealousy would get in the way of a prophet's mad Madness who wants to go and actually curse the children of Israel and and actually have a donkey speak to him Godly jealousy will get in the way of another prophet and his Madness and how a group of boys what did they do they thrashed him they smashed in his face because he walked home a girl one day carried her books for her and they called him a Kentucky squab and what did that Prophet do he ran home and got the 22 long rifle down and he ran and he made an amb Bush and he put what was it 16 shots into that gun and he pulled the trigger on every single one of them and not one of them fired Godly jealousy will get in the way of our Madness in our lives Godly jealousy will save us from getting into car accidents that will destroy us Godly jealousy will get us to the place where we can actually have the word of God supersede all of the idols that would be raised up in our lives every one of us has them smash them them down brothers and sisters don't create a high place for them don't don't create a comfortable spot for an idol to get in the way of the word of God examine Our Lives get rid of them I just was thinking about this the the chased virgin what does that word mean chased chased virgin I believe it's a a a virgin is is clean that's innocent modest and perfect amen chased clean and pure I just think it's so beautiful to look at the the word of God and to just see how how the wording actually is for us it was stored up for a season brothers and sisters we've been given this word of God and and we know that there is such a tremendous Revelation that's Unleashed to this world in the day in which we live sometimes it's almost hard to even bear it's difficult to even comprehend how God would choose us to be able to comprehend but we know that it says it in the word of God that we would be able to comprehend what is the height and the depth and the length and the breadth of it that we would be able to understand the the fullness of the word in our day you know brothers and sisters true Revelation is identifiable it's not just something that we say we can say it many times I know I've been guilty of saying it many times I know I've been guilty of when people start to bring out quotes and talk about things that I want to be able to bring out quotes and talk about things too but you know what are we living that is the critical factor in our lives it's important to be able to pour from vessel to vessel we have to be able to do that but not just say it live it amen true Revelation in our lives brothers and sisters is identifiable if we're not observing the virtues in our lives then we need to get back to the altar turn with me over to Corinthians let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 13 when we have true Revelation about the word for our day it's not just that God sent a prophet it's that God sent a prophet and I've met the god that that Prophet actually brought the god that that Prophet was actually sending the invitation to I have received that invitation and I know that God he is my God why is it not because of something I say not because of somewhere that I go because I see these virtues living out in my life in 1 Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse one says though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol I just want to bring up that first slide there brother the picture just want to point this out this is what we are in in in my visualization if we actually are just talking about the word but we're not living it out little monkey with some tinkling symbols this is what we are this is what the word of God says though I speak with the tongues of men and angels maybe I actually speak in tongues maybe I see the gifts of God manifesting in my lives but if I don't have charity what's charity charity is God charity is the Lord Jesus Christ that person that we were talking about a few minutes ago living out through our lives though I speak with the tongues of men and angels I and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol now I want to just press pause there and I want to go to the next slide and I want to say this this is where we're supposed to be brothers and sisters not just that one little monkey making a little bit of sound over in the corner he's quoting the quotes and he knows the Bible and he goes to church and everything else does it all just right but he doesn't actually live it he does something else that's where we're supposed to be brothers and sisters every one of us as an instrument with our position looking at the conductor knowing that when we play we play together and we make one sound we play the song the conductor is leading us to play brother Bram talks about Peter and the Wolf in that great Symphony and he calls it sympathy but you know it's a symphony and we know that we all are looking for our queue that that conductor is going to point at us and we need to know what our time is we need to know how to read the sheet music the only way we're going to be able to read his sheet music is to have the Holy Ghost Inside of us to interpret that amen but that's where we're supposed to be not that little monkey making sound with a tinkling symbol brothers and sisters with all the quotes and notes and all the stuff tenure in the message that ain't going to do it we're that tinkling symbol verse two says and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all the Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing now remember we're not talking about charity to say oh we've got the poor people we need to feed the poor people we're talking about charity as the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost in our life amen if I don't have Jesus in my life if I don't have the Lord for today according to the word for today in my life I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing it makes the most miserable Christian doesn't it it makes the most miserable person in the world Amen when we're almost there but we're not quite there for some reason there's something stopping us from going all the way and usually it's an idol usually it's something that we're just not willing to smash we're not willing to say whoa I'm just going to let go of everything that I know and let the Lord Jesus Christ drive my life but that's truly by Li living by faith brothers and sisters is where we do that verse three and though I bestow my go verse four charity suffereth long and is kind these are are the attributes that we want to look for charity suffereth long we know the Lord is longsuffering isn't he amen and he's patient and he's gentle charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily Prov provoked thinketh no evil amen rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth we know we've read that I just want to point that out the statue of the perfect man if all these things be in you you shall not fall charity never fail if you've got God inside of you if you've got the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters you'll never fail you'll never fall you'll fall down you'll trip and fall sure but you'll get right back up and you'll go amen we'll trip and fall we'll stumble we're in this flesh this flesh isn't what was redeemed remember this flesh is the pest house that we're trapped in we have a new body already waiting for us hallelujah and if we're willing to get the token in our lives we will go on to that body amen charity never fails but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away I just can't help but think you know when we look back on our lives someday if the Lord should T if we find ourselves in a place where where we're just alone in a bed or in a chair and we look back on our lives are we going to be satisfied ified that we gave our all to the Lord Jesus Christ that we actually did everything that we should according to the word of God or are we going to think that I should have treated my wife better or I should have done something more for my children or I could have done more for the body of Jesus Christ I I could have actually done this but I chose to selfishly do that are we going to look back and say those words or are we going to say wow praise God he chose me to do these things and I just wish I could have done more I know that I did did some but I really wish I did more where are we going to be because all the rest of it we just read about is going to vanish away everything is going to disappear brothers and sisters all of our money all of our investments all the portfolios all of our business everything that we've got all of our even our images all of it will disappear the only thing that will remain is the word of God if we got the word of God in us then we will remain for we know in part and we prophesy in part but that when that which is perfect has come and I can tell you brothers and sisters that which is perfect is come Hallelujah he's here the prophet was here to declare he's here and he said that for when we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away so when I was a child I spake as a child maybe I didn't quite understand all these things but I don't have to understand these things because I know that he understands those things and he the spirit of truth will lead me and guide me into all truth I I was a child I spake as a child they understood as a child they thought as a child oh but when I became a man when I became mature according to the word of God when I became the stature of a perfect man when that's this life of Jesus Christ this one started Living out through me I put away the childish things the only thing I wanted to do was lay down my life for my family the only thing I wanted to do was lay down my life for the Gospel of Jesus Christ I wasn't interested in chasing the childish things anymore I wanted to be a man I wanted to serve the Lord with all my heart for we know now we see through a glass Darkly this is Paul speaking here right now in their time while he's saying this they were speaking through a glass Darkly but then face to face brothers and sisters when right now the prophet said he's here we know that cloud was for a purpose but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am know even as you are known amen amen the Lord Jesus Christ Living out through you I think it's just so beautiful and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity the Lord Jesus Christ Living out through US amen you know brothers and sisters we have we have to be seeing these virtues in our lives and if if we don't see them in our lives I'm here to say today not you scoundrel you you need to do something different and I want to judge you what I want to say is get back to the altar it's not too late the Rapture isn't gone brothers and sisters we've got a communion service tonight you can come and wash yourself out you can come and wash the Lord Jesus Christ's feet tonight you can surrender yourself unto him like maybe never before you have the ability to get to the altar Before Time has run out before the foolish ver virgins are left here on Earth you can ask God to remove all the stumbling blocks you can say if I have I got an altar have I got a an image in my life Lord take it from me if I do right because who wants to keep an image who wants to have something there in the way of God sometimes our image can just be ourselves don't pray God change their heart change their life change this situation move that that's talking to him like he's a vending machine say Lord change my heart create in me a new heart and renew a right spirit in me and he will amen hallelujah 1959 1223 questions and answers I'll try not to keep us too long here today we've got the service tonight I want to be respectful to everyone in our time for the bradam says now if the spirit of Elijah upon John would make John act like Elijah the spirit of God upon you will make you act like Jesus amen now there's where you find the Holy Spirit see that's what the Holy Spirit does it makes you Meek it makes you humble makes you forgiving we're not constantly thinking about the past and how that person did that and I'm going to bring it up and use it as a club and as leverage because every time we get into a discussion I'm just can't get past that thing you know what that thing is thing's an idol smash it down don't keep it in your life brothers and sisters he says that's what the Holy Spirit does it makes you Meek it makes you humble makes you forgiving could they pull down could they pull whiskers from your face if you had them out there jerk them out and spit in your face when you had the power to call Legions of angels could you do that for the love of the people that was spitting in your face could you do it if somebody just walked up to you and said hey you hypocrite and smacked you on the side of the face could you pray for their forgiveness now that's where trust test whether you got the Holy Spirit or not yes we could say Amen to the word all day long but let's talk about the real world now let's talk about when we get into the pressures of life and someone cuts us off and someone does this and someone does that because the devil's going to come brother Bram says he's got one punch he's enti to one punch to every single person every believer he's got one punch now what's going to happen to us when he takes that punch now that's where trust test whether you got the Holy Spirit or not see when somebody says something evil against someone sometimes that claims to have the Holy Spirit I'll get even with her if it takes my last day see now that's where you check about your Holy Spirit see blessed are you when man shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake but you go get even with them no rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you see when someone says evil about you say something good amen if you can't say something good about them then don't say nothing just let it go see and then when you get to yourself pray for them pray for them you know sometimes brothers and sisters that's not just brothers and sisters sometimes that's parents to children sometimes that's children to parents sometimes that's wife to husband and husband to wife brother to sister sometimes it's that way but we need to do that and you know when you get the Holy Ghost it's not something we need to do you're just going to do it how does the Sheep grow wool it just does how does the dove stay white well it just does because that's what's on the inside of it how do we behave like Christ well we just actually let him live out through us and we're willing to Smash down all of these Idols that we have in our lives so that he can live and you know what he's just waiting to see us do it he's not going to come and send a bulldozer like they have going into Gaza now he's not going to send an armored armored piercing covered personnel carrier to come in and Smash down all of our Idols he's going to wait for us to do it but brothers and sisters why wait till whenever I want to encourage us do it now amen he's here it wasn't just something that the prophet said if we've come to church believing in a living God believing in Hebrews 138 brothers and sisters he's here to meet all of our needs if we just need a little top up of the Holy Ghost he's here if we need forgiveness he's here if we need to see something change in our lives he's here we don't have to go searching for him he's here right now do you believe do you now believe 1955 talking about love here but the BAM says now I'd just like to tell you what my secret of the greatest what are you you'd how how you'd like me to tell you tonight what I think is the greatest most powerful vo Force there is on Earth if you want to see him move on a situation brothers and sisters it's not going to be by force not by our force is not going to be by jumping up and down and screaming and shouting and dumping oil and and having everybody lay hands on and do all of the mighty wonderful religious acts all the religious motion David did it and still a man's life was taken right he wasn't following the word of God but if we follow the word of God we will see him move in our lives brothers and sisters and what's going to take to conquer all of this stuff is love he says would you like me to tell you about it a few minutes you might not love me so well after this cuz I will just tell you all the mightiest for on there is is on Earth is love that's exactly there's nothing will break down love no matter what it is isn't that wonderful 1 Corinthians 13 we just read about it if you want to see all of those things smashed down all of the problems in our lives not erased but smoothed out so that we can get through them so that we can maybe grow closer together with one another as brothers and sisters or as husbands and wives or as parents and children if you want to see that happen if you want to see relationships grow then pour on love brothers and sisters iron fisted tough love that's for I would say other people not the Bride of Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ is going to exude the life of Jesus Christ the people that were the most ridiculous Sinners are the ones that he went to and did he condemn them and smash them and belittle them no he said the one that you're talking with if you asked him for a drink oh my the five husbands that you've got are not they're not yours and the one you're with Now isn't yours either an adulteress caught in the act thrown at his feet 56 0426 Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever amen if you love him you know love is the greatest force that we have the most powerful force do you believe that love will just do things that nothing else will do nothing else will do he said it how will the world know that you love me that you go to a message church that you claim that God sent a prophet that you know the quotes that you go and you witness on the streets it's that you have love one for another but when we've got something in our life where we just can't can't stand to see another brother we can't be close to them there's something wrong with our experience because we don't truly love him we know that John talks about it and it's pretty hard I'm not going to get into it but he says if we claim that we love him but we hate our brother we're a liar I think love is the most powerful force that the world has because God is love did I give you this one 57 0519 yeah sorry I jumped ahead this one is called love this is the message love in 1957 guess what he's talking about I think love is the most powerful force that the world has because God is love and there's no more power more powerful force than God and love is one of the greatest things that I could speak of and I'll say it today I think it's one of the greatest things that I could speak of it's one of the greatest things that you could speak ofen is love and not just love as we know it not not ailio love not love in our feelings and our emotions and oh I love this person and I love this thing no agapo love the the love that transcends all of this emotional state all of this spiritual state that goes right into the heart of the believer right to the word of God right to the throne of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the love we're talking about brothers and sisters where it's Jesus Christ himself living out through us the spirit the Holy Ghost 5708 6 God projecting his love and I just think it's so beautiful because this quote was already in there when you were singing that song the love of God shown to this world yeah the Believers the life of Jesus Christ Living out through each one of our Lives as we go forwards as we treat our spouses as we treat our children as we treat our brothers and sisters this love is what identifies the Holy Ghost In Our Lives it'll run a woman mother right into the flames of fire after her baby if she knows she's plunging herself to death amen there's nothing more strong than love love will make you trust you might go and and know that you belong to the greatest Church in all the provinces of Canada you might know that you're the charter member of the greatest Church in the nation and then you would do the things that you would not do if you belong to a little Mission somewhere some corner and and had the love of God in your heart he says love has no fear love casts out fear and I notice in my meetings so much that when I come into the people one of the greatest things I find among them is fear brothers and sisters don't be afraid because love casts out fear I'll call the musicians we don't have any reason to be afraid brothers and sisters o other than we know the word of God is here and we have an idol in our life we have something that's getting in the way of this word of God taking the full effect in our lives I want to challenge just this morning if you got something don't don't be embarrassed say Lord help me and Smash It To The Ground take it and throw it down we know that brother brandham talked about those those blanket natives that they had the situation where they were presented with the word of God through the Vindicated prophet and he said if God will do this Mighty miracle if you will see that this is the god that I bring to you will you smash down those Idols they were packing and they all smashed them down because they saw the life of Jesus Christ through that man and I want to say if he is the same yesterday today and forever then brothers and sisters don't pack it another day don't pack it another hour if you got something in your life smash it down let him live out through you take the challenge see if God won't manifest in your life in such a way like maybe he never has before love has no fear brothers and sisters don't be afraid love casts out fear we have the ability to recognize that if we're afraid then maybe we just don't have this love that we're talking about in our lives maybe stand with me as we close brother brandom says that what makes fear is a lack of confidence if you lack confidence it'll make you fear sometimes we can have confidence in the wrong places and if we do that then we're going to be afraid and I would say if you do have confidence in the wrong place you should be afraid H but I want to say take your confidence and put it from wherever that is if it's in your idol and in something that you know and you're just not willing to let go of it's the way I was raised and I know that I know okay if it lines up with the word of God that's great keep on with it if you love the way that we've read about love today then keep on with it but if it's not according to the word that we talked about then there's something wrong with it I want to say smash it down it shouldn't make us afraid put your confidence in Christ if you lack confidence it'll make you fear but if you love it casts away that fear and that's the way God wants his church not so many as charter members F upstanding citizens he wants members that's loyal and loves and believes and has confidence in who not the pastor has confidence in who not the deacons has confidence in him yes him and him alone brothers and sisters one more quote 1959 1223 you know what an idol is in our lives ultimately it's a devil it's a Tormentor and he's going to do everything he can to get in the way of that life living out through US brother bradam says it in 1959 1223 questions and answers you never cast Out cast a devil out by the wrong attitude we know that he says it in the message of the hour the right mental attitude towards any one of the promises of God will bring them to pass the only right mental attitude we're ever going to have is the Holy Ghost mental attitude in our lives which is going to equate to love which is going to exude the attributes that we've already spoke about today it takes love to do that and love is the most powerful force that there is in the world now if you notice a devil is always hate hate is of the devil and when people hate someone remember it is a terrible devil to despise or dislike you mustn't do that amen love is the only thing that's going to conquer in our lives brothers and sisters and he is the same yesterday today and forever and he is here if you want to see a change in your life it's not too late the Rapture hasn't gone just ask him invite him and see if he won't let's go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness to us Lord thank you for your word Lord we pray Lord Jesus that we would see your life live out through US Lord father that we could take and tear down the Groves that have been created in
