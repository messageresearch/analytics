would you Rebecca I'm from uh the Detroit area in Michigan I go to brother Paul off I think straight to 100 Pastor said that earlier but uh I have a I've been enjoying my fellowship here since I came here I appreciate with a barrier and uh his wife Mr Ellen right am I correct yeah I can say that right yeah so is that I get in trouble well it's so beautiful good to be here and just Fellowship because children you know even though I'm on vacation but there's nothing greater than major girls children and just enjoying the the bountifulness of God in them so I really appreciate that and I appreciate my family here John and Esther was taking me in and I think I have more than five star till in the house I still feeding me fat and so I appreciate you guys for taking those hand in my family my wife see Jennifer and my kids Phoebe and Dasa thank you for coming with me and all of the family members I have a lot of family members here it's the Sharon number that you did um brother Toby who grew up together was my big brother you know one house uh I remember when he uh got into into college I was still in high school and then I remember he used to like you know talk to us and everything and we also had some good time playing music I was not as good so he was the one I had to play the piano and I play the other lower piano kind of thing so yeah but I really appreciate God in his life and as today has not changed from who he used to be um thank you thank everybody here Pharaoh my brother we would do music together in Africa and sing together it's better than me though but I really really appreciate um girl's goodness and we've been having Great Fellowship since I've been here my voice is just getting back because I took a day break they won't let us have groups just worshiping and worshiping on us October the Barry I said hey you have a terrific judge members I don't know where you got him from but man they got some fire in them so but it's so good to see those children pressing on the battle not giving up you know we have trials on this world but despite that we have God as our our father who's giving us strength amen praise the Lord I want all those down tonight um make sure that I don't uh spend two more time spreading towards because I could go two hours so but now I'll do that tonight so I'll just try to set my alarm here so that I didn't um go ahead of time you know I just one thing but the brand said Don't wear the people out as much if they want to receive the word it's okay if keep going it keeps keep receiving that's all right but don't worry people out I don't want to worry people out I think you've gotten enough I think I'll just stop right there amen praise the Lord so I'm just uh quickly set my alarm and if you don't mind um all right if it will stand together we made this uh evening as we approach the word tonight The Book of Matthew Matthew chapter 10 verse 1. because Matthew um look up Matthew chapter 10 always from verse one but let's pray one more time lord Jesus we thank you for this word have given us you have the Revelation in this word we don't have nothing Lord please Lord open this word to us Lord and blessed children father in Jesus name amen because Matthew chapter 10 from verse one I read and he said when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sicknesses and all man of diseases and if you skip to verse 16 and said behold I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves be a therefore wise as serpents on harmless as those you may be seated while I read the book of Romans 12. Romans chapter 12 verse 1. and it says I beseech you from verse 1 12 verse 1 I said I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye presents your brothers a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and being unconformed to this word but be ye transformed by the renew of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen before I go ahead I just want to say if you open a remarks about you know what it means to have a pastor a great pastor um a pastor is one that represent the Lord Jesus Christ as a Good Shepherd amen and he asked a great great role as the father of the house that we all go to for support and strength amen and Bertram said a few things about what a pastor is and he said a few things that I like I said the um um he said um and the sermon Moses 1950 said that that's the reason you're passing sometimes when your pastor comes to you the reason he can't help is you've got to have faith in your pastor you have to believe that he's a man of God so that what I'm trying to say there is that God cannot help you if you don't have trust in your pastor so because see I know he's a man it's fallible but you're going to trust the gift on him especially if he's fitting you with the word and also said in uh uh Believers down me uh paragraph 7-1 I said right there so I noticed you've got to have confidence in the man you you're dealing with or it won't do you any good to do any dealing you've got to believe your pastor he's a good god-saved preaching to go on the gospel and stand behind him with everything you got if he isn't go somewhere else that's the only reason it's given but if he is stay right there that's right now that clears up both sides now remember if you purchase the gospel stay with him help him cause his man sent from God ordained of God to feed your soul so I'm I've I had I've been under the uh um my dad been a passenger and I've been in different churches and you know I just I was talking about the Barrett back there I said the Pastor submission is very important now when you choose the pastor like a church it's like what Abraham said like you can choose another bride it choosing like a junior bride so you got to pray about it when you go to church just go out you like to pass out the way he dresses it's cute or whatever or he's eloquent or it's not a thing it's not like an extra minor minor things the main thing is that it's fitting you with the word of God wholesomely and that's what's going to help you and help your family so if he's not doing that then you can go somewhere else but I say but the battery I love his spirit I met him on Sunday and then I've heard about good things about my brother and my dad and I just met him I just humble man of God and on Sunday all he did was just open the word of God to us and just feed us with it and you know we went we are still in the strength of that going from Sunday and that's what I want you to appreciate that man so much you might not agree with him some things it's all right we're we're all human we have our opinions we respect that position amen give him all the support the needs give him all the respect needs all the prayer that I need sometimes it needs your prayers don't need you an argument oh Pastor I like I know this you might know the ministry is more than him but that doesn't matter pray for him for us to bring him to that position where you are bird brown said when you get the point where you are feeling bigger than a pastor it's time to leave so I want to just want to encourage you to support the Barry and listening to strenu you'll be surprised how much God will bless you I've been a blessing of that everywhere I go I don't I don't know I don't hide myself I support the pastor I give all I can and God has really blessed me for that so please do that my brothers and sisters amen praise the Lord amen so I'm gonna go ahead right quickly and just um to our um um title today uh we're reading from The Book of Matthew 10 verse 1 and verse 16. also Romans 12 verse 1 and 2 and I have a little title that God gave me um a couple weeks ago that and I've been you know thinking about on uh Sun On Sunday when Brother Bear asked me I was thinking I had two titles I'm working on and God has been my heart and I was singing God for some science and then he just showed me exactly what he wanted me to do so I I just stay with this right here so I hope it's a blessing to you I was just helping preach everybody okay don't don't be quiet on me just say Amen if you can amen if I'm saying a word just say Amen to thou help me along amen praise the Lord so the little title I have the tonight is Believers interacting with the word Believers interacting with the world and you know we're nowhere in this world we are now of this world but we have to interact with them every day we interact with them at our jobs and our neighbors and even family members that are not Believers and all that stuff but what's important here that I really want to get to First is with the believer who is a Believer that's a question that you can you know ask anybody and it was the real believer like a True Believer and the first thing I you know put down there and I was just you know thinking about is that a Believer is one that accepts receive the goodness which is the word of boy's age you receive that thing first that word first it does not question it it might not understand it but he knows that this is true something down his heart says this is God speaking to me and it goes there and just grab all of it it must start to understand over the years later but at that point in time it's connecting to that word amen and that's remind me of fervation 3 20 when when um John was talking you know in the Book of Revelations three and it was you know the last 10 Church all towards the in and out Los Angeles a church that's miserable blind and think they have it all and they're poor and Jesus said in verse 20 it said how even with all these conditions even all this what's going around I said I was standing at the door and knock it said If any man listen if any man will hear my voice and remember that that man's not he does not hear God's voice by his own power or might or how good it is or how much money he has or how much Acumen intelligence he has that man is able to hear the voice of God because God is inside of him so like the Bible says a deep call into deep God has the power to stimulate your heart your thirst and hunger for God where when it is like I can hear God there's various voices out there the verse voices and they know even women of our own voices but when God's voice come it's different it might not be big it comes the verse till Small Voice and he can differentiate that voice from other voices and like my masses calling me and Jesus said he said if that man hears my voice it didn't stop right there and opens the door when that my whole point of the story said I will come in myself so what makes a Believer is not our big address so how much career you have I have more PhD emeritance that you have or how much wealth you have in this world that's not what makes it believable how much message you know how much you know uh uh uh uh intellectual part of the message that you understand that's not what it's one that accept God's word accept goodness and after I accept it it doesn't stop right there it retracts from some Godly ways and that's most of us have ish you know I've been in that position where some of us are safe from denominations from somewhere Muslims and my dad was with Muslim way back somewhere in the Catholic church and some of us were even born in the message but we're born in Mexico we didn't receive God yet and I'll tell you this if you're a young person right here today we're born in the message I'm invite you your life will never be the same until you meet God and accept him you might strive you might pray you might do whatever you might saying so nice to have good voice player instrument or the more unto you accept God in your life you will never you will never be able to overcome day to day amen so some of us also as young young young children born a message we still were there we are stubbornness to disappear their parents we stole me from the pot we did various things but guess what when God touch Our lives our life changed that we didn't have to tell us no more because we accepted God Amen so you try from Young early ways and then go back to what Paul Peter said in Acts 2 38 and then you repent the word depends means that you're going this way and all of a sudden change direction to another way it's not that you're going this way and say maybe I'll just you know I can do a little bit of the things I used to know the Bible said he said all things that pass away it's all things that become new so there's a repentance axis 38 and the Paul said Peter told him I said repent dear if I'm baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and then you shall be filled with the gift of the Holy Spirit now when you see the holy spirit it's not just receiving you can receive and transmit so when you receive not just oh I have to understand just so enjoy it no that believer receives the Holy Spirit and then ability to transmit to another person amen and then like I said repentance means that there's a chain of Direction now that believer we're talking about who's a Believer right now so don't forget about that that believer has a benchmark The Benchmark is that the believer follows only the Master's command you can have other other ideas and I know philosophies all all around him but he follows the Master's command now when I use the world's command people think it's a military term like oh man he's forced to do it he's not forced to do it it's not coerced to do it it's a man in love with the Lord have you seen a man and woman young young lady you know in the church and a young assistant you will fall in love with each other they can't do without each other and Brahma was saying that if you're going to marry a girl make sure that you can make sure you get to a point where you can live a day without her if you still can survive without her you're not in love it but the moment you start like I don't know before I met my wife Jennifer you know we're friends and all of a sudden we just you know keep talking to them and then there's a point out I was like man I just can't do my day without her I would do 12 hours on the phone and because I was in love with a girl and that's how that's how it is in the fiscal time spiritual if you love God so much it wouldn't force you to do nothing you're just out of the love you I said Lord I just want to please you I said please don't let me pleasing to you let everything that I I you know I I have not owned I just want to please you what do you want me to do next amen that's what that happens that believer he has a benchmarks he's not force to it it's a love I fear between a believer in the Lord where he wants to please the Lord and whatever he does for Romans 8 14 said for us may not live by the spirit of God they are the sons of God Amen and that is guess what it doesn't stop there and say you know I'm safe right now I just stop right there it starts to examine itself daily that's a believer I'm just giving up you know what what when I'm looking like that like that the believer she'll be he said exams of daily with God's word he immerses himself in God's word and the better he does that the Better Lives becomes amen the better you immerse yourself into God's word every day your life just just you just find out your life is changing you're just surrendering like brother I saw him this morning you're just surrendering Just Surrender that's all he asks for he didn't said to ask Just Surrender says that word and immerse in it and then before you know it please ask them oh no that you were trying to fight to the struggling with slowly just fall out amen and you know you know what you're trying to do is doing one thing with Matthew 5 48 said Is it true he's striving for Perfection he said be a death of perfect I see heavenly father is perfect and they strive for profession sometimes it's going to make mistake as a believer but a bouncer will make mistakes every day sometimes you know even has been a wife as much as you love it sometimes you you know you just don't go on same page I'm telling from experience so I mean the other ones can tell I have a short life of marriage but I can't tell a little life I live so far sometimes not even good but even with the mistakes one thing stressing down in his heart that brings him back to repentance I said Lord I messed up this on this part I messed the Lord please forgive me and the Bible said it's just unable to forgive all of our sins not just part of it it's a whole of it he knows that you're gonna even have those mistakes before he even made them and the ultimate sacrifice for for your correction so that's amazing that God is a god that is not it doesn't love you based on what you do in the next moment or what you're gonna do tomorrow or what you're gonna do you know next week no he didn't love you based on that it love you unconditionally amen hallelujah so you know it's so amazing how the life of Believers you know it makes me mistake but God is the word of God is so powerful to cleanse him and bring him back on his feet again amen so we're talking about uh believer another thing about Believers is inspiration where is this inspiration coming from from above amen it states of music from above it's conversations from above it's association's kind of friends he has from above the kind of dressy he you know dressing he puts on the fashion style from above so it's not him no more it's Christ leaving in him the hope of Glory Hallelujah now I want to just I'm enjoying this so much but I just just go quickly so I don't I'm wasting my time so the unbeliever if you look on the opposite look at all believer uh but Brown was saying about um unbelievers and I have like three categories that kind of you know break them out a little bit to what I'm Believers are and I have one the fourth one is the one that never heard the word Abraham said that he has traveled all over the world in the sermon um uh in this summer right here I'm trying to see but I'm saying something right here and I was saying provided way of worship uh fellowship and but Obama saying they said he's traveled the world over and I've seen all kinds of people and some of them don't even know which is right or left so I've seen people that did not even know which was right and left and know this word never heard the word of the Lord Jesus in their lives so there are believers out there who have never encountered God's word amen that's one category I know the category is one who have heard it but did not receive it we have around as well family friends you know good people they're nice to us they want to be there for us and but they just don't they don't see it but they don't reject it but to me I'm looking at that as an indirect rejection it can't be on the fence he said they accept it or you reject it so they don't they don't say anything against it but they just don't see the way it says and they they respect it then the third um the third group is one that totally rejected they received the word they see it and like you know what I'm not for it I'm out they even talk it some even blast them against it so what happened is that that man does not it could be a believer let's get to the we'll get to that in a minute it could be a believer but he has not seen it yet oh he's not a Believer as a doesn't have sin of God anymore I just rejected right like like that so they never come to repentance like the believer always come to the Panthers amen there's no repentance dictionary of a non-believer Anything Goes it does anything there's no there's no restraint it follows the new trend it follows the new challenge and all that stuff it does everything that's just new it doesn't have a set goal for himself no battery no barricade it's got to be filled with the spirit so there's no fans but so I don't have the spirit of God but I can't you know I can I can be somewhere no he can't he said you have the spirit of God or you have the devil in you right so you gotta choose one so you're going to sleep with the spirit Soul was saying that did they have been the God of this evil age yes he goes he fills in so we have now I've gotten you even if you have a pen and you're that place is cleansed and God doesn't come in right away the devil's gonna take his place amen is this person comes from the myth health and that's why you look at the music that we have in the world today look at the conversations that's in war today look at the the style the fashion that just turning people to be naked instead of covering them covering themselves or perceptually the female gender and that's what if you notice that that's not from God is Holy so with that happening the inspiration that is that unbeliever that it's not from from God but from from Benin now the unbeliever is a soccer boy everybody knows a soccer ball right here have you ever played soccer before I play soccer I know in America I mean it's spelled in the U.S it's football um um they play football but in Africa and some part of Canada so I can I can align with Canada Canadians right yeah I see a lot of soccer stadium like well I need to play some soccer but if you say something to talk about before an unbeliever to soccer ball in the legs of the enemy I'm gonna explain that so when you play soccer if you haven't played soccer before when you hit it wherever you hit it to is where it goes it has no direction of its own if you leave it's gonna stay right there but if you go out go go to it and kick it out of your foot or with the toe it goes wherever you you know direct it to an unbeliever is a soccer ball in the end of the devil because that's his God it's in his heart it does whatever he wants with it but guess what he can't do anything with a believer a Believer is Lost Child it's so it's so strong like God doesn't play with any of his children but Brown said he said God will destroy no multiple of this word for just one child so he doesn't play with God's children are so powerful you don't know let me tell you brothers and sisters you're a powerful you might be sitting here so humbly but you're powerful that meant multiple of this war because of you God can born can just destroy things just for you so the devil cannot do nothing you know cannot touch you unless God allows them to look at job was try God try him say have you seen myself and James oh yeah I know my because he's covering him all the time that's why yes it's Rich he's has everything he wants he'll say okay go check him out but don't touch his soul touch his body so there's nothing that can happen to you I'm gonna try that's gonna happen to you without God allowing it to happen amen praise the Lord now we have uh the next one we're talking about which is uh the uh make-believer if you want to um you know find more about this song about the brown push about three kinds of Believers I mean just a refresher I'm not telling anything new it's just to remind us of all things that we've already known you know just a reminder for the word that God has and stuff for us make believer it's uh a fabricated uh believer make believe is manufactured it's believe it's manufactured you just try to follow it just try to you know see what's going on try to you know wear a garment that looks like it it's made up not real it's hypocritical is that man in the church that is skeptical about what whatever has been done it's kept about the gift of God of whatever the moon of God it finds false all the time remember I'm safe gonna find Falls in God's house going to find a lot of fault for me you're gonna see a lot you get from Brother Barry maybe a million a million but guess what that's not what we're here for we're not here to find faults we have to make ourselves right this is an hospital where we come with all our diseases on sickness in the Lord Here I Am Here I Am Lord this is what I've been struggling all week this is what I want to get better and he's here to all cleanse us all so we're not here to look for faults amen but they make believe that's what it does and you know it stays longer but Brian was saying that in the in the message on the three kinds of Believers said you know it stays longer than short than to be unbeliever they only was like oh I don't like this that I'm out but maybe stays and you can't even think he may be replaced music in the church he might even be a song leader he might even be a preacher but it's not accepted the word yet amen faith has no roots in that make believer it says long on the church now but I'm saying something right here and I really like that I would love to uh to read and um in uh three kinds of Believers uh was saying right here said it's supernatural produces three kinds of believer so when God moves what happens Sith and also moves and every time that that move is you know according three kinds of Believers are produced now saying three kind of Believers are saying it said c said when it's supernatural is displayed it produces three different types he did it down in Egypt and I've looked through the scriptures it's always like that when God moves it's always that that you know set of Believers produced it's produced the unbeliever the believer and make believer he did all the classes and just were down to we just go go uh to just go on and on through the night spend nowadays everywhere you find it you see you see them three and always that way you see and you find them everywhere that's what's just trying to say that they're always everywhere that's what Obama's trying to say but the thing is it's still now separate them how do you know it's a Believer how do you know who is an unbeliever how do you remember we're talking about in interaction Believers interacting in the world so we have to understand we're Believers was an unbeliever who is the make-believer dam and I don't know we we interacting with amen Matthew Matthew Chapter 13 24 to 30 if you go in there talk about power of the soul I won't read it because of our time but I want to just quickly go ahead and basically talk about how a good man came to plant seeds you know and then in the night after I left the enemy came and planned tears in it and then when they came when they came back and things were the wheat and the tears of corn they're like wow we're planning all this and and the lord of the of the the swords as he said said the enemy Planet it was like oh let's just put them about I said no don't pull him out and because that's natural for you just want to go there and just pick it up I said don't pull them out I said leave him let them grow together I love them said verse 30 said let them both grow until Harvest this just tells us that the Believers True Believers and non-believers and make believe as they co-exist and the water where either in the church or out there we live together there you know this so much so much going on with that and say but how do you identify that how do you you know separate that scripture said buy their fruits amen Genesis 8 22 if you want to write it down he said why did Earth remain see time on the Harvest cold and heat no tea time and harvest cold and heat summer and winter day and night shall never cease so when there's a seat Zone once later later 20 years later it could be 40 years even 50 years later the Harvard is going to come amen and Matthew 7 was saying right there also Master Matthew 7 was saying you know what Jesus was saying about you know buy their fruits you know them verse 20 I was talking about how you know you have false prophets coming in and they you know hide where uh shifts clothing but they are wolves and said Beware of them and said how will you know them by their fruits so that's how we know the difference between all those Believers and another thing I know I will let you know if a man or a woman is a Believer a True Believer in time the fruits of their life will depict what's on the inside you said but how it's going to be I was going to just push them or no I've ever heard the word pressure before pressure is a tool of God pressure will fall out what's on the inside pressure can come from trials can come from from the trials in the marriage it could come in different various forms but you can you can you can pretend for a long time after a while you're gonna give in amen pressure means squeezing crushing just like when they have a order not with the wine that we have today you have grapes and then of course the grapes and they squeeze them to get them out and you know I know that word for but she's that word is tension Act of stretching like in music when if you all this pianos uh instruments that they have strings they have tension and the more you stretch them the acute the sound comes like you can hear it distinctly so pressure will bring out what is on the inside of you whether you're a seat of God or not whatever seed God or you just either pretending to bring it out and Barbara was saying something here today you know people were thinking oh now you're Christian now you're saved you don't have any more pressure you just have it to be easy you pray and go just answer the prayer and then everything just goes smooth but that's something but Brian was saying United time I signed 1963 for uh program 17 it was saying that some people try to introduce Christianity that you are free from war no you're not you are free from tension they say that I said no your attention when you become a Christian like my grandma said another place said the moment you're saved this is all the artillers of the enemy just come at you because now you have you have you drew a line and say hey I'm not serving you no more I'm serving God at that point say hey get him so the extension right there it said your attention when you come a Christian because he was he was kind of I mean sloppy Abigail Loki whatever it was out there and not caring what it did and that's what I believe it is it's just you know do whatever nobody who's him but instead but when you become a real Christian paragraph 18 every moment you're wondering am I pleasing my Lord amen if I could hear from him you know something happened a couple weeks ago where you know I assuming she's my boss and unbeliever and then I was trying to use my Approach as a human and you know just to fight it and God told me you can't do that it said just find God in every situation that you find you you find yourself in so when I went back to work the next I told my wife about it I was not looking at my boss anymore I was trying to see God in him and you know what all the tension just seized because I was not looking at you know this is a this is a non-believer I was looking at him as okay where can I see God on him amen so you know I wasn't looking at you know that man I was looking at how do I please God when I'm dealing with this man and that's what the believer said my pleasing my Lord if I could hear from announce so much I I was I'll I'll talk to girl when I leave there I said Lord I just want to hear it I just want to walk with you even in distress of work and pressure and you know you know situation that my boss is putting me in but I really want to just just see you and then it puts your attention you're always on guard that's what makes you who you are but after all know this after all tension is a blessing it's just the way you're looking at it it's just the way you're looking at it he said now if you just look to the other side no matter how things you slice anything you used to go two sides to it and listen about uh paragraph 19 says so tension what is tension if I could if I could be born without this tension well if I couldn't have this tension if I only be what I am then I will not be the Christian perhaps it was this tension that drove me to Christ it's been a blessing to me amen so pressure will push out the real you just like a tea bag tea bag you might not it might look like a certain color but most of the time the colors know what it really is when you get our teeth back get a very hot water maybe 100 I don't know I use uh I used to use a centigrade in Nigeria and then I got to us and I got all messed up and confused and I'm back here I'm thinking we see miles or kilometers and I'm just confused but you know that's 100 degrees am I right Fair am I right on a degree Centigrade yeah for for water to boil so if you put um that tea bag in that cup and drop in that very hot water you see the color coming out you can even if you can hear I'm just hypothetically you can hear the tea bag is screaming like oh this water is still hot but guess what it's bringing on the real color or for that tea bag ass and that's what it is about Christian when you know you might not even know what they have but when that trial comes that that that that's the situation that pressure comes it just makes it more beautiful amen hallelujah so pressure will determine exactly where you are amen I'm gonna go ahead right quick so remember we're talking about interactions with unbelievers um Believers and and make believe us and we've established by the scriptures done by the word by the mess of the hour that we have to kind of Believers and coexist now now that we know that the coexists do we now say Believers have to be in a bubble so you don't want to understand you don't want to attack to them just stay in your house or wear it a level a suit puts gas Max on I just want to touch them and just talk to them so they won't make you say do we do that no we're not gonna do that because the co-az is as close family members they might be your dad might be your mom might be your brother or sister it might be a cousins people that you really love so much and because I saw as friends great friends who are good to us even as good neighbors neighbors who would do anything to to help colleagues that work in a career uh business partners you know they even in the church do we say we're gonna you know just being above or no we can't and that's why we need the Holy Ghost the world is going to give us discernment as a Believer when you get the Holy Ghost in your life the next thing that comes is discernment to be able to discern not by face value either Luke are nice there how good they are how given they are but determined to help you to separate the people like oh something you might even understand why see German is very strong second time I mess with certain people and I see them and then after my wife I said I don't know but I just feel funny on this person it's like don't judge them you know I say I'm not judging them I'm just telling how I feel and then down the line of down the years and certain things come up like oh you were right but guess what I couldn't Express I couldn't explain what happened but you know the sermon is just better I see my children God because now you already know exactly what's coming so as mature God God's gonna start speaking to you from mild to ear but you have to imagine saving the word for you to grow spiritually where discernments go bigger but a brownie didn't get that position the way it was where it could discern you have to walk with God onto a point in time where it was my trust spiritually and you know what you can't be there too where God put Branham in in a position as a prophet we know as a prophet but God has so much is tough for us it's a Greater Works that you do now it's not Greater Works in in quality it's in quantity I'll maybe if I have time I'll share that uh that uh um quote the girl was talking about it that you do more of this but we need to walk with God God does not dwell in investors that's dirty God wants invest that's preserved for him and he can step into that and work amen so Germans have important for a believer um Hebrews 5 14 if you want to read that say about strong meat belonged to them that are full of age even those who by original views have their senses senses not of not the same not the physical sense not spiritual sense exercise to discern but good and evil amen and I remember now not all all believers are unbelievers or make Believers no unbelievers and make Believers are sins of enemies some of them are still God's children who have never seen that green light yet there are some of them we have God said in them they've never just encountered God but guess what the moment they encounter God the story changes you'll be shocked at how much you know Zeal they have for God how much um sacrifice to give in because you know God has you know touch their lives watch Muslims am I mean I've been around a lot most I can tell you they're very very zealous they don't play whatever they believe in they are indoctrinated so much and then watch I've watched those Muslims that God saved with the word over the message devour oh my God they just blow out was in them and later it's just catching them boom they're up there and then you meet them a year or two years later you think they've lived for like 10 years because they're saying Mars what they're believing so when God touches your life it's a different ballgame hey man so not all those unbelievers I believe and and make Believers are sisters of enemy some of them are God said amen as long as I've got sitting them they will never be lost and that's why I cannot give up on your family members your friends your people that you love don't give up on them don't say you know it's hey you know he's now he's in prison right now oh now he's doing this and that now he's doing drugs don't give up on your own your people keep praying unto God answer your prayer because you never know a preacher Nigeria preacher I was saying one time and said he said give for example you're walking through the street anybody's in the hood before I bring the hood very bad bad neighborhood Detroit eyes and Chicago has it you know this person doesn't look like that it's so beautiful [Laughter] everything's just cleaned so but if you've been to the hood before you see you know really bad guys that you know they've been through it and then that preacher said if you see see let's say you know sitting on your own by your Windows 10 you're looking out and God said Hey to that guy with a roster in there within his hand that guy's my my son Let's assume that I was just saying that that guy's my son he said the moment you know that because you're a Christian you do everything to please that man because you know for sure God has told you that man is God's son so and that's where we treat everybody I've made don't we should not have you know um no categorize people and say you know I can't talk to these people I can't be around these people wherever God leads you go put your opens your mouth to evangelize speak to them just talk to them share your testimony do whatever I can do to help them hold your faith though don't say because oh because I'm going to be around them and now I want to don't be like them hold your faith but at the same time still reach out to them amen amen don't give up on your loved ones because you never know keep pressing keep praying keep believing amen I'm gonna go farther uh so now we're talking about you know you know um interactions with the ward and basically one thing I go put in my heart here is that you cannot interact with the devil or the rest of the vessel vessel of devil out there if you don't have something inside of you you have to have something you've done something you're gonna struggle I mean audio just pull it over to the other side and now the thing about scripture and ask people came to me about foundations and Psalm 11 verse 3 if you want to write it down say something said if the foundation be destroyed what can the righteous do you really said in in strict words verbatim he said what can a good man do now I was like so who's the good man I was just in the wondering just sometimes you go to have answers from the scriptures the answers are there you've got to open your eyes you see right there so and I was just thinking about it and then I go to Matthew 19 verse 16 and 17 where that man came to Jesus said oh good master and Jesus said there's no one that's good no one but God so I said oh I'm not understand what this means so if the foundation will be destroyed what can be righteous which is God is righteous do basically so that means that if you really you want to interact in this world as a Believer you got to have something to you to combat the tactics or the artilleries or the weapons or the strategies of the enemy if don't have it if you have a great Foundation it's going to affect you and I was thinking of the word foundation you know I took a sermon sometimes like my church a couple months ago about Foundation which is really important for everybody foundation and now you know um I'm looking at definition right here and saying financial means establishing yourself in the present day truth of God's word having your two feet on the ground and it's not something bogus something big somewhere where you have to have some vocabulary and have to go to school on College do Masters or a PhD for it no it's not gospel is simple read listen meditate and pray it's as simple as that God didn't see God made salvation so easy that he said If any man will open the door no matter how Wars it is it's leave even Paul of uh became Paul later he killed he he was part of mother he was he was part of the model even though he didn't kill directly part of it but God saved him so it's it's just they're establishing yourself in God's word when you're after you're saved establish yourself in that word if you are saved that you don't understand that word you will lose that that salvation now when I mean salvation you will lose your as the city of God God Will Take It Go do anything to save you but at that point in time you lose that person that you are because you're not establishing them in that word amen so after you're saved you have to keep reading that word until it makes you better and better and better and better hey man read listen meditative and and pray what does that do it's what your prayer Waters the seed of God's word in you daily amen because someone talks about but but no you know one of the um question answers said I cannot grow to the Easter storm read the Bible and pray every day it's as simple as that God wants to take him as simple as word is and then he can do great wonders in our lives amen this Foundation puts in place a framework of Godly principle and guidance which is built on Christ himself the Chief Cornerstone amen and you know what what happens like he helps a God's word Bridge your that inner man now it's not you trying to interact a fight with all that tillage of enemy right now it is the inner man in you the the older goes in you doesn't combat combat the enemy on his vessels and that's what that's what we need we're Foundation First number two is builds I was thinking about after you as you read you know listen medicine I pray on the review word it builds faith in you so that's the foundation of function of faith and then that brings it brings me to Romans 10 10 17 where it says faith comes back here and here by the word of God now I have some people in the message now that say oh I'm just gonna sit on the house and just you know read my Bible or read the message play the tape and say that and no and they feel feel spiritual about it but then that scripture said that we should not forsake the Assembly of the Saints as a manner of some so we're gonna put a balance to that as much as you want to be oh I don't want to be in a drama I don't want to be anything I don't want to do they sell a lot going on the church right now you still want to make sure if you're obeying every part of God's word we go to Walmart and we see crazy people there we never stop going to do we still keep going every day we see crazy I mean during Kobe that sounds some crazy people wearing different attires but we should go there I'll jump out of some crazy people different Jenners and we'll see go there but not one completely complain about the house of the Lord because we feel like we can't do it you need to come here to strengthen yourself that's what we are you threatening me out threatening you sometimes I come to church and I'm just so tired and I just don't feel like going on it happens there are times like that and then but the bear says the sermon like oh thank you Lord and that's the word for the day so please don't stop coming to church if if you're out of town I understand but if you're in town brother sister come back to church this is where God is going to strengthen you amen amen so first time by hearing and hearing by the word of God and this kind of brings them back to I'm just dying a few things together brings it back to the Statue of a perfect man you know how you know you know but Abraham talk about that statue and they know it goes up and on the pyramid and if you have that uh if you have that that image can never bring it up so I can um go through that hey man I'll be enjoying it brothers and sisters hey man praise the Lord so if you look at what I have here um I'm just uh quickly running through it and um I think we're doing good so far amen so um if you look at this uh I'm sure you've read this statue for everyone several times but I'm just going to remind us and if you look at I thought I was talking about Foundation to come back this the the award and interacting this world you have to have a great Foundation inside of you but after you're saved this Foundation of Fate number one was talking about that right there faith is the foundation that is it is the key I remember when when when uh Jesus was asking them in the in the book in the gospels I was saying oh uh would you say I am I sell something oh yeah your Johnny this and that then look at John Peter said would you say I am I see your your Christ the son of living God and said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you and basically if you notice Peter was not he got a breath of God at that point in time it wasn't even saved because if you were saved he wouldn't run away when Jesus was crucified but it was it was it was a seat of God but he had not gotten that power yet excuse me so when he said those words there were two words they're powerful words but they were not in him yet it can be around the presence of God he can have a breath of God sometimes you remember in the Old Testament when Saul went among them the prophet saw the prophet and they were prophesying and he also prophesied not because he was a prophet but he was taking that breath so that's different between taking a breath of words around and having to give her yourself so Peter didn't have it but after acts acts acts in Acts 2 chapter 1 when that when that that thing came to when those people came to him it was the one item from people he couldn't hide no more yesterday whatever I can do because what that boldness had been in him that Foundation of faith has been established a name in no way he was and what what it was raised up for he didn't hide no more they took him to prison you think that I would stop him no the Holy Ghost in you you know gives you boldness and confidence in the in the midst in the midst of Trials and in the midst of no no no no no no the enemy out there I mean unbelievers and whatever goes on there little girls gives you confidence to walk and say yeah I'm here I have government my side what else and that's why you know you you see a lot of happening the message around us and now you see people have been messaged for 30 40 years and they've been great ministers and they just leave I pray if they're going to bring them back but the question is do they meet God ever because remember that Peter D in in Matthew 10 I read he did Miracles there but he was not he didn't accept that word yet so like I said the pressure will bring out what is in you when the pressure came out there before the cross he couldn't stand it because there's nothing inside of him but what it said was a true word it said but I said this and Jesus said right there he told him said on this foundation on this Revelation I'll be my church that relation is nobody but Christ himself someone receive Christ it gives you that revelation of Faith now now Faith starting like it's it's a key it's an opening opens the door now you believe in every word that comes to you you have faith in them I'm saying somewhere said you know that Faith starts as a little faith and it goes to Marble faith and it goes to a mountain fate that's the way he put it and before you know it because if you don't have faith for the little word of God right now how are you gonna have faith for that for for the rapture you want because it's gonna grow over time you have it right now for you know for for your sicknesses for diseases for the prayer request something you're praying for a family member and that fit grows you know as you go no what what is that Faith you're believing God's word even if you don't understand what it's saying you believe it and then it becomes to you or no according to what you what you believe amen so we have faith right here but if you look at it this is right it's such a perfect man look on the other side what happens the fourth one day can you see it says doubt unbelief if you notice it's inverted the reason why I invited it this is just my my imagination I hope God uses for you this one right here if you go to Egypt it just add the the technology of the pyramid and I was reading through that that you know why they have pyramids that's right side up why it's as a Capstone I'm gonna tell you the reason so because I was like this is really deep because we we believe these things and we don't nonsense some things but it's really true god is perfect so it was saying that if a parameters is right side up with the Pinnacle off like that it means the inspiration is from heaven I was like wow that's amazing and it's it's also said it said it shows if the way it's going upwards is standing now but it goes up it turns out it said it means that that that person from God's coming down to earth and then he's trying whoever whatever vessel who is traveling towards Perfection I was like wow that's amazing that and that's what we are doing Matthew 5 48 who is driving onto perfection we're not trying to do anything and as it goes out all the extra Flex extra Surplus things things that go we don't want is cutting them out as we're going Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience and it goes all the way and guess what it doesn't stop there because it's not complete if the Capstone don't seal it up amen and then I'm looking right here Faith doubt virtue but said virtue strength strength and I was saying earlier if you have strength in you you have it and can transmit it you remember that woman not to use your blood when she when she uh went and held the government if Jesus said virtue get out one of me what was that that was strength amen son and you know we're talking about the beauty of Faith the beauty of of a Believer the stats of a Believer where he can combat what's going on there what's going to come out you're gonna say a lot of doubts out there to help you now what you're going to see again from virtue you see weaknesses out there similar weaknesses oh I can't do this I can't do that like everybody's just relying on the system relying on whatever you know but as a Believer no you know you have strength inside of you next thing is knowledge no it's not knowledge of here on the other side is knowledge of man how I can do it how can I get this done what's the approach what's the intelligence behind it that what how can intellectually approach it that's not the way the knowledge of this knowing I have knowledge of God you can't know who you really are until you know God because there's a purpose for every man every believer right here every brother every sister every child and adult there's a purpose that God created you for and guess what if you look at if you look at the Book of Revelations after you know angel came in and all that stuff it went down to what's the purpose after the seven angel came in this voice of sending Joe you know it's one purpose what are you here for and John said eat that eat the book it's bitter but it's for you so you have a purpose while you're here and then that purpose if you don't have knowledge of who God is you never know who you are amen I hope you're enjoying this basically and then so basically we're looking at what God who God is and knowing who I am so how many who is even God what is his purpose then I find myself in in God's plan like oh I found myself under where am I this is what God plan you're playing this and that and then that he wants to worship him oh that that's that's my purpose so that overrides every of my agendas every other things I Aspire for that I know what God has me to be he wants me to be amen now if you notice that as it's going up that's an aspirations to go to desire you know aspiring for the better thing and then next thing is uh Temperance remember I'm saying that's that's restrained restrained like you know you have control you're not just doing anything anywhere you're not just following anything but if you look on the other side there's no restraint it's anger and wrath and so many things going on but that's what's out there but you need temperance to combat that if you don't have Temperance of God in your you if that allowed the world to subdue those fleshy manifestations in you it's you you was just getting angry for nothing amen and it goes off the patience patience pronounce these patients with God patience with the word of God every promise is given it might not be manifested yet you know it's for you but your patient will go until it does what he has planned for you but out there is a lot of impatience oh I can't do that oh this can happen oh I don't believe in God's word the days of Miracles are passed that's what's out there today but as a Believer if you're getting built in this in this spiritual realm if he's a patient in you so you can combat in patients out there in the world amen nursing is godliness out there is some godliness can you imagine how much and goodness is out here today especially in America that where we live at so much that you can't even stand some but guess what we need to combat it is godliness you want to be like God amen wow the Bible say yeah God's Psalm 82 verse 6 said I said about um David said I said yeah gods next thing is uh brother Candace if you look at the opposite right there is self-love even if there's so much motivation motivational speaking today that's about oh just to love yourself don't care about whatever your parents or your mama say and they it comes to selfishness where even the families are broken apart and everybody's independent and we're not even looking out for ourselves no more but God has God didn't bring that well God brought his brother Candace that I should love your brother tolerate your brother forgive your brother you mess up he will he's human he will step on your shoes you're nice you just bought yesterday he would step on it but guess what you have the heart in you God has so subdue that personal Pride like he probably is okay I'll take care of it even if if it's raining I'll take care of it that's what God has given us combat self-loveness God has done himself love because if you had self-love you wouldn't come down to earth to you and me but because he didn't have self-love he came down and say you know what I'm gonna sacrifice myself you know what I'm gonna call myself so if yeah oh my God hallelujah I feel good about this right now John John said he said beloved let us love one another for the love is of God and everyone that love it is born of God I know what God either love it not know it not God for God is love amen and you know what that kind of ties into the Capstone because that's who God is it's perfect love now if you look through the up to seven churches you see how the devil came you know with different tactics and then the four-star second and third uh um Church agency came with the the White House writer then it came up um with uh the writers writer and then came with the uh the black horse ride and the last one it came with was the pillars write a combination of all the colors together and that's what it's doing right now he's combining his tactics but you know what he can't do nothing in the presence of perfect love because I have a scripture here that's perfect love cast it out all fear so I'm so excited that even even if that would come with all these combined taxes against me against my brother against my sister I have something that has given me if I can just connect to it it's perfect love amen praise the Lord I'm really feeling good right here I feel like jumping amen praise the Lord perfect love is so strong but Abraham said in in the sermon love uh uh when love is projected paragraph nice and love is the greatest weapon that God has ever given us so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna interact with some Believers out there I just I need perfect love that's all I need to win this battle I don't need any extra without any any independent uh way of Mind intellectual artillery or tactic I shouldn't have that perfect love in me to to win that that that but that's the greatest weapon so far perfect love is the greatest tool God has given every belief every believer to interact with unbelievers and make believe us in the present world perfect love combines the wisdom of a serpent listen with the armlessness of a dove Matthew 10 can open it right with me I'm I've done a few minutes Matthew 10 I'm 10 16. let's read that quickly because that's what perfect love does Matthew 10 16. said behold I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves unbelievers make-believers wolves be ye therefore wise as what and armless as what I know you know suffering don't mean anything good let's be honest if you see a Snicker right here now we're gonna jump out in Africa maybe not over here we're gonna jump out so but the thing is it doesn't have anything good if you go back to Genesis 3 and 2 instead of the servant was soft subtle so basically he doesn't have any characters but what Jesus was saying right here is deeper than just the the cast I guess the characteristics of that animal what he was trying to say is that that it was talking about assuredness not Sly Communists because the Sovereign is cunning but that's not what it was when it was talking about the scripture because I'm saying perfect love combines the uh the the wisdom of is a serpent and the homelessness of a dove now the sureness is not slight condensed but Swift discernment it can be read like oh I know where that's coming from but you know what you can't have that you don't even can you bring that picture back up again please my brother thank you you can't have that you don't have knowledge of God in you because but Obama said the knowledge about the U.S no make sure to know what is good and what is not you're able to judge right now people will say you know unbelievers I said oh um but Jesus said in Matthew 7 don't judge no man y'all know that and they bring that scripture to you and they must go to scripture but Paul also said he said it's spiritual man does what so it's not with him judge no more it's the knowledge of God in him that's judging that man so it's not it's not trying to no condemn any man it's still you know you know it's absorbent it's tolerant but is it kind of the word the guy said the word says you're wrong brother you're wrong amen hallelujah so you know it's just amazing how you know we just uh let the world do the to their own things bro I believe in in the Judgment of the holy spirit amen it's perfect amen like let's go back to what we're talking about shooting us up you know Street discernment whether it is of god or not now at the same time it's bringing about perfect love is bringing about um homelessness of a dove so as much as he's standing for the truth it's not losing its innocence amen is still serving the law blamelessly I can see that in scriptures remember I I maybe I would just I'll leave that um some other time but when Jesus uh went into the temple and whip them out and say this is my father's house it's like oh he he doesn't believe it's an unbeliever but he was doing the right work but at the same time it's not losing his innocence as as a man of God they could not say anything against them it was blameless so this this scripture uh Matthew 10 6 16 just talking about those combining those two together it's a paradox it's like a it's a like a simile it's just it's really two different characters all those characters coming together but that's what prophetler does in this age you know the devil is not kind of smarter than his creator for you perfect love gives you the boldness to take a firm step firm stand not missing words with respect to what you believe and express the love of Christ at the same time that's what prophet does perfect love calls for a total separation from the world even though we live in the world we are not of this world Hallelujah Exodus 19 if you want to write it down when God came down to the to the Israelites there he wanted to speak to them and said go separated said we'll clean yourself up what did he have for them perfect love he wanted to communicate with them it was not successful but in our age successful now because God came down himself he tried to do it you know he wanted to he just wanted to fellowship with his people but there were two um it was so too strong for them to take at that point in time but right now God doesn't send it again and it's here amen perfect love course separation Lexus 19 and also second Corinthians 6 14 to 18 foreign romance 12 for verse 1 to 2. basically I already Amplified version and this is what it says it says therefore I urge you brothers and sisters by the mercy of God to present to your bodies dedicating all of yourself set apart as a Living Sacrifice holy and well pleasing to God which is a rational logical intelligent act of worship and listen to verse two now do not be confirmed like I said a perfect love calls for total what separation do not be confirmed to this word any longer with the superficial values and Customs there is all over the place superficial but be transformed I love I love this part I'm progressively changed so the changes is Gradle it's a process it doesn't it's not it's an instance it's not overnight God is just giving you strength and then you just you just see your life just change like wow you see the way you act react to you to your wife you just oh God this is me you see the way you're acting your husband that's not the way you were when you got married to her it's not you no more it's a progressive change as if my choice spiritually amen by the renewing of your mind focusing on Godly values and ethical attitude so so now your focus is not on oh let me try to please my wife please my husband please my pastor your focus is ongoing values I said focusing on that things are happening behind you Hallelujah by the renewable mind focus on God's only violence and ethical attitudes so that he may prove for yourself what the will of God is that which is good and acceptable and perfect in his plan purpose for you amen am I'm almost done Brethren I hope you're enjoying it I really feel good about this and it's just you know my heart soul is just so blessed perfect love says that the environment counts the environment that it you find yourself perfect love says it counts amen I'm a Roundup for this I'll save everything else we have been causing some something very higher let's support our column we're closer Home than ever don't let the pattern of the war there's so much distraction in the world right now good distraction I'm there very enticing like like Bible said if it was possible the electricity but you know what you never received but before the financial of the world before this water was even was even made we had the seat of God in us so don't let us focus on where we're headed at focus on The Godly battle on the word of God on what has given on that perfect love and ignore everything else no no forget about the associations the modern ways the trends the distractors and focus on our goal let me let me read this prescription while I end this you know perfect love say something right here he said there's no fear first John 4 18 there's no fear in love but perfect love casted out what so the Devil comes with combine taxes to cause fear and you know how they're in the war right now there's so much fear Everybody's scared of Russia is Captain America America is scared of China that's what the devil brought all the taxes bring about fear but this one what does what it cast out that fear and that's that's all we need to to to to to equip ourselves in this world to interact with this world that we are because we know of this world we have a home we're headed to Romans 8 15 said but ye have not received the spirit of bonded to what to fear but you have received the spirit of what when you step into this this position right here in perfect love what is welcome you become adopted sons and daughters amen praise the Lord and say you have no you have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry I have a father so that's where production makes you cry into father daily non-stop that's not you no more the last scripture I'm going to read right here it's the second Timothy 1 verse 7 said for God I've not given us the spirit of fear but of what power I love that you're gonna have power to do to be whatever way you want to be on the God's will and I guess perfect will and of love I love it sound mind we have a we have so much uh so many God has given us on this age we don't need any extra thing not nothing extra it's as simple as the prophet brought it if we're just lay on it and just let it just seep in we'll be just fine amen praise the Lord let's buy us everybody Lord we thank you tonight Lord for your word it's real lord Jesus it's from you and we know Lord that you have a plan and we are part of your plan Lord Jesus because we know we have to interact in this world and you know fix different trials on this world and you know just because whenever I'm here we have surrendered Our Lives to you they have given all to you but we still have to go to these trials around us Lord they give us strength in our hearts Lord is not to be distracted by any not to the character about whatever is going around us or are we how good it looks but just focus on you Lord Jesus Christ and just live our life for you and just follow let that word take his full curse yes in our life that's what we ask for Lord we have don't ask for anything special we're gonna ask for something no no out there that's that looks so low so ambiguous Lord reaction just for you to living our life daily suppress our flesh and let this it lets your spirit take perfect control kill us if you don't have that perfect love feel us with that perfect love it's very important Lord that we can conquer the Fearless in the world today the devil has put out there and the unbelievers and make beliefs I just one Elder Scouts about but we want to have rest in you enough because even your brother said he said nothing enters out there and that's what we ask for the Lord give us strength as we go day by day
