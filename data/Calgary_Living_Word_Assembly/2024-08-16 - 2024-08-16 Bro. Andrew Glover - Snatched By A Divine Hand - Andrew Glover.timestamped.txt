[11:24] Amen.
[11:26] Amen.
[11:28] Amen.
[11:30] [Music]
[11:34] Can we voice the second last song? I
[11:38] know the mash of the wind.
[11:41] Amen.
[11:41] Glory. Hallelujah.
[11:46] I hear a story for this.
[11:49] There was a man. He was a diplomat and
[11:52] he had a journey he would actually he
[11:53] had to go on sometime soon. He'd be
[11:55] traveling around the country around the
[11:57] world and he had a small daughter and he
[11:59] decided that I'm going to take my
[12:00] daughter with me and on this journey
[12:03] they met countless people. So this
[12:04] little girl felt like they met millions
[12:05] of people. They went to different homes
[12:07] and different breakfastes, different
[12:09] lunches. Met some people and all these
[12:11] people felt they knew they knew her
[12:13] father so well. They had a story to tell
[12:16] about her father. Finally, they had some
[12:18] time for themselves. The father asked
[12:20] his daughter, "How do you like it so
[12:22] far? How do you like the journey?" With
[12:24] a little sarcastic grin on her face, she
[12:25] says, "Daddy, it seems like you know
[12:27] everyone but God." And sometime I
[12:30] thought about that sometimes it's like
[12:31] that with us as believers. You have all
[12:34] these relationships, all these stories
[12:36] with other people,
[12:37] but then the one savior who saved us
[12:40] and this myself sometimes
[12:43] whether at work, school, that one
[12:45] relationship that matters the most. Do
[12:47] we know him well? What stories do we
[12:49] have? What testimony did our God do for
[12:51] us?
[12:52] Amen.
[12:53] I know the master of the wind.
[12:55] Amen.
[12:55] Amen.
[12:58] Oh, my boat of life
[13:02] sails on a troubled sea
[13:06] whenever there's a wind in my sail.
[13:13] But I have a friend who watches over me
[13:21] when the breeze turns into
[13:24] [Music]
[13:26] know.
[13:27] Oh, I know.
[13:36] I know.
[13:41] Oh, he can come and make the sun shine
[13:47] again.
[13:48] Oh, I know the master of the wind.
[13:53] Sometimes,
[13:56] sometimes I
[13:59] like an eagle through the sky.
[14:02] Among the beats, my soul can be found.
[14:09] A unexpected slow
[14:14] from the high
[14:16] brings me.
[14:22] Oh,
[14:24] I know the master.
[14:27] It's personal.
[14:29] Oh, I know. I know the one that healed
[14:33] me.
[14:35] I know the one that changed my life. He
[14:37] can
[14:39] make the sun shine again.
[14:43] Oh, I know the master of I know.
[14:49] Oh,
[14:51] I know the master.
[14:55] You know him. What has he done for you?
[14:58] I know
[15:00] the way.
[15:04] He can fall or make the sun shine again.
[15:12] I know the master of just our voices.
[15:18] Oh, I know the master of the wind.
[15:24] [Music]
[15:26] I know the maker of the rain.
[15:31] Oh, and he can fall. Oh, make the sun
[15:37] shine as brother Barry comes.
[15:41] I know the master of
[15:44] one more time.
[15:47] Oh, I know the master of the wings.
[15:56] I know the
[16:00] rain.
[16:03] He can calm the storm,
[16:07] make the sun to shine again.
[16:12] I know the master of the wind. Sometimes
[16:16] I soar all together.
[16:19] Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the
[16:25] sky.
[16:26] [Music]
[16:30] can be bound.
[16:34] An unexpected storm
[16:38] may drive me from life.
[16:42] Brings me low, but it'll never break me
[16:45] down.
[16:47] The same one is here tonight. I know the
[16:51] master of the wind.
[16:57] I know the maker of the rain.
[17:03] He can call the stor
[17:08] again.
[17:11] I know the master of the wind.
[17:17] Hallelujah. Do you know him tonight?
[17:20] Hallelujah.
[17:20] If you have a need, maybe make it known
[17:22] unto him by way of an uplift hand. Amen.
[17:25] We just want to remember the the sister
[17:28] that's having a baby tonight. Gracious
[17:30] heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[17:32] you for your presence, Lord.
[17:34] Amen.
[17:34] We thank you that we don't have to call
[17:36] upon you and invite you to come here.
[17:38] Lord Jesus, we know that you're already
[17:40] here because your word declares where
[17:42] two or three are gathered together in
[17:44] your name that you're there. And Father,
[17:47] we take you at your word and we're so
[17:48] thankful that you're here. We know that
[17:50] you're not here to give us a good
[17:52] feeling, Lord Jesus. Lord, just to give
[17:55] us a good appearance, Father. But Lord,
[17:57] you're here to change us, Father, from
[17:59] glory to glory, word cell upon word
[18:02] cell, Father. Lord, tonight, if there's
[18:04] anything in our lives that might hinder
[18:07] your spirit from moving inside our
[18:09] gates, we just, Father, ask that you
[18:11] would forgive us for it, Lord. If
[18:12] there's any iniquity in our hearts,
[18:14] Lord, Father, remove it from us. We ask,
[18:17] Lord Jesus, just like David said, that
[18:20] one that was, Lord, a man after your own
[18:22] heart, Father, create in me a clean
[18:25] heart tonight, Lord Jesus. Father, let
[18:27] me examine myself tonight, Father. Let
[18:30] me lay on my face before you tonight,
[18:32] Lord, that you would speak to me, Lord
[18:34] Jesus. Father, we just ask that you
[18:37] would minister unto us, Father, the
[18:39] words of life that we need. Thank you
[18:41] for bringing brother Andrew here safely.
[18:43] Lord, we know that you've put a burden
[18:45] on him for this body of believers here
[18:47] in Calgary. And tonight, Father, we're
[18:49] so thankful and we're willing to accept
[18:51] that word tonight, Lord. Father, we pray
[18:54] for each and every need that was made
[18:55] known unto you by way of an uplift hand.
[18:58] Father, the defiance of gravity to say,
[19:01] "Be it unto me according to thy word."
[19:03] Lord, one more time, we just invite you,
[19:06] Father, to meet the needs. Father, we
[19:08] pray that you would be with Sharon Rose
[19:10] Stone, the the niece of Brother Jerry
[19:13] and Sister Mary, Lord, as she delivers
[19:15] her first baby, Father. Lord, we pray
[19:18] that you would be with Brother Bosch in
[19:19] New Zealand, Lord Jesus, dealing with
[19:21] the most painful affliction known to
[19:23] mankind. Oh, Father, we know that you're
[19:26] more than able, Father, we pray that,
[19:28] Lord Jesus, you would come on the scene
[19:30] in a mighty way for these needs, Lord,
[19:32] that you would receive all the glory.
[19:35] Father, tonight we just ask now that
[19:37] Lord, as we begin the the most important
[19:40] part of the service, Father, that Lord,
[19:42] you would just be glorified in in all
[19:44] that's said and done, Father, we we love
[19:46] you and we thank you tonight, Lord. We
[19:48] commit each life into your hands,
[19:50] Father. Each word that's spoken for your
[19:52] glory, Lord Jesus. And Father, we'll be
[19:54] careful to give you the praise. We just
[19:57] ask all these things now in the name of
[19:59] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[20:03] Amen.
[20:05] I just want to make a couple of quick
[20:08] announcements before we sing All Is
[20:10] Well. We'll sing that chorus as we
[20:12] invite Brother Andrew to come. All is
[20:15] well. We've heard the message shalom. We
[20:19] have the breakfast tomorrow morning and
[20:22] uh we'll have service tomorrow night at
[20:24] 6:00 p.m. and then a regular service
[20:26] Sunday morning with a potluck to follow
[20:29] at our place. and we'll be aiming to uh
[20:32] begin at 2:00 on uh on Sunday after the
[20:36] service. God richly bless you. I just
[20:38] don't want to get in the way of the
[20:39] spirit tonight. All is well.
[20:47] All
[20:48] is well. Is it well with you tonight?
[20:54] We have heard the message.
[21:00] [Music]
[21:14] I'm perfect
[21:17] behind
[21:19] the
[21:23] [Music]
[21:25] rest.
[21:27] [Applause]
[21:33] One more time if it's well with you
[21:35] tonight.
[21:43] Oh, all
[21:45] is well.
[21:51] We have heard the message.
[21:58] All is well.
[22:02] [Music]
[22:06] There is a place
[22:09] perfect
[22:11] rest behind
[22:14] the
[22:16] veil.
[22:18] So
[22:19] rest little bride
[22:23] rest for all
[22:26] is well.
[22:30] Amen. God bless you this evening. Amen.
[22:33] How many that's your testimony tonight?
[22:36] Amen. You may be facing a lot of
[22:37] situations and things going on, but
[22:40] Amen. There is a rest in the heart of
[22:41] the believer tonight.
[22:43] Amen. We have an assurance that that
[22:44] rest goes beyond just a church or beyond
[22:47] just a preacher. Amen. But we have hope
[22:50] which is an anchor. Amen. And our anchor
[22:52] is within the veil. And
[22:53] you know, I love how the prophet of God
[22:55] talked about it one time. He said there
[22:56] was a boy out there flying a kite. Amen.
[22:59] And he said sometimes that
[23:01] he said sometimes that kite he said he
[23:04] would wonder if it was still up there
[23:05] when he would get on the other side of
[23:06] the clouds. He said but then all of a
[23:09] sudden he'd feel a little tug and he
[23:11] said he knew it was still on the other
[23:12] side.
[23:13] You know sometimes you look at the
[23:14] situations of life and the pressures and
[23:16] things going on and maybe you wonder
[23:19] sometimes the devil puts pressure upon
[23:20] you. Is there really a future? Are you
[23:22] really going to make it? But then all of
[23:24] a sudden you feel that little tug. Amen.
[23:26] You know there's a theophony somewhere
[23:28] pulling on you and there's a anchor
[23:30] within the veil. And you know I believe
[23:31] that's what we've come here for tonight
[23:33] is Amen. to receive something from him.
[23:35] Don't you? Amen. Maybe we just bow our
[23:37] hearts together tonight for a word of
[23:39] prayer as we open these meetings. Let's
[23:41] just invite the angel of the Lord to
[23:42] come among us in a special way this
[23:44] weekend. I know there's many needs and
[23:46] many situations, but we are well able
[23:49] tonight to take the land and we believe
[23:52] the promises of God.
[23:53] Heavenly Father, Lord, as your believers
[23:56] have come here this afternoon, Lord, on
[23:58] the first night of these meetings, Lord,
[24:00] gathering here on this Friday afternoon,
[24:04] Father, we've not come here for just
[24:06] another service, Lord. We've not come
[24:08] here just for a gathering or a
[24:10] protractive meeting. But Lord, we've
[24:12] come here because there is a deep
[24:14] calling to the deep.
[24:16] And Lord, at the noise of thy water
[24:17] spouts, you said you would answer. Oh
[24:19] God. Lord, our hearts are hungry. Lord,
[24:22] we're thirsty, Lord. Lord, we're not
[24:24] hungry for an idea. Lord, we're not
[24:26] thirsty for just another church service,
[24:28] but Lord, we're longing for the reality
[24:30] of the living God. Yes,
[24:32] Lord. The living God that moves among us
[24:34] and does living works and many signs and
[24:37] wonders follow after the manifestation
[24:39] of your presence, Lord. Father, as we
[24:42] open our hearts to you tonight, God,
[24:43] we're inviting you, Lord. Father, may
[24:46] you come among us in a special way.
[24:48] Lord, you see the needs of your children
[24:50] here, Lord. Father, you know what
[24:52] they're facing, what they're going
[24:53] through, Lord. Father, I as a man, I do
[24:56] not have the ability to minister to the
[24:58] needs of each one. But Lord, your
[25:00] prophet has taught us if we can get
[25:02] ourselves out of the way that Lord, the
[25:04] gift that you placed in the life of the
[25:06] minister can begin to operate. And Lord,
[25:08] you can begin to deal with the needs of
[25:10] your children. So, Father, we invite
[25:12] you, be the speaker here this weekend,
[25:14] oh God. Lord, may your anointing that
[25:16] destroys the yoke of the enemy, oh God.
[25:19] Father, may it come among us in a
[25:21] special way. Lord, may healings take
[25:23] place in bodies, Lord. Father, may
[25:25] deliverances take take place in minds,
[25:28] oh God. Lord, may empty vessels be
[25:30] filled with the Holy Ghost, Father.
[25:32] Lord, if there be one growing cold upon
[25:34] you tonight, I ask, oh God, there would
[25:37] be a cold of fire come up off the altar.
[25:39] And Lord, may it touch the lips of your
[25:41] servant, Lord. Father, we ask you to
[25:43] forgive us of our failures, Lord.
[25:45] Forgive us of our shortcomings, oh God.
[25:48] Lord, draw us closer to thyself, Lord,
[25:50] and we'll be sure to give thee all the
[25:52] praise, all the honor, and all the
[25:53] glory. In the wonderful name of our Lord
[25:56] and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. And
[25:59] all the believers says,
[26:00] "Amen."
[26:01] Amen.
[26:02] And amen. God richly bless you this
[26:04] evening. If you have your Bibles, while
[26:05] you're standing with us, we will invite
[26:08] you in the scripture. We want to go to
[26:09] the book of Isaiah, the book of Isaiah,
[26:11] the 59th chapter. Amen. And then also,
[26:14] we're going to go to the book of
[26:14] Matthew, the 14th chapter. Amen. Amen.
[26:17] And while you're turning there tonight,
[26:18] we do want to greet you all in the name
[26:19] of the Lord Jesus Christ. We sure do
[26:22] count it an honor and a privilege to be
[26:23] here once again with you in in Calgary
[26:25] and to have this opportunity to come and
[26:27] minister to you again. We thank brother
[26:29] Mary for the invitation and the
[26:30] confidence to stand here and amen. We
[26:33] sure thank the Lord for allowing our
[26:34] pastor to cross and the friendship the
[26:36] Lord has given us. And we just pray the
[26:38] Lord will come by this weekend and do
[26:39] something special for you.
[26:41] Amen. Isaiah chapter 59
[26:44] and verse number one. The Bible here
[26:47] says, "Behold,
[26:49] the Lord's hand is not shortened."
[26:52] Amen.
[26:53] "That it cannot save."
[26:54] Hallelujah.
[26:55] "And neither his ear heavy,
[26:57] Amen.
[26:58] that it cannot hear."
[26:59] Hallelujah.
[27:00] His hand is not shortened that it cannot
[27:03] save.
[27:03] Amen.
[27:04] And neither is his ear heavy that it
[27:07] cannot hear. So there is a direct
[27:08] connection between the hand of God being
[27:11] able to reach out and the ear of God
[27:14] being able to hear the need of the hand
[27:16] that it's reaching to.
[27:18] Now in the book of Matthew the 14th
[27:20] chapter, St. Matthew chapter 14, it's a
[27:23] very very familiar reading. In Matthew
[27:26] chapter 14 and beginning in the 25th
[27:29] verse, Jesus here has just come out on
[27:33] the water and he's calmed the storm. And
[27:36] in the 25th verse, and in the fourth
[27:37] watch of the night, Jesus went unto them
[27:40] walking on the sea. And when the
[27:43] disciples saw him walking on the sea,
[27:46] they were troubled, saying, "It is a
[27:48] spirit." And they cried out for fear.
[27:51] But straightway Jesus spake of them,
[27:53] saying, "Be of good cheer. It is I. Be
[27:58] not afraid."
[28:00] Amen.
[28:00] Now, I love what Brother Bram says. He
[28:02] says the very thing that could help him
[28:04] the devil was trying to make him afraid
[28:06] of it.
[28:07] Now here in the in the 28th verse and
[28:10] Peter answered him and said Lord if it
[28:13] be thou then bid me come unto thee on
[28:16] the water and he said come. And when
[28:18] Peter was down out of the ship he walked
[28:21] on the water to go to Jesus. But when he
[28:23] saw the wind was boisterous he was
[28:25] afraid and beginning to sink. Now watch.
[28:28] He cried saying Lord save me. And
[28:32] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[28:34] hand and called him and said unto him,
[28:37] "Oh, thou of little faith, wherefore
[28:39] didest thou doubt?" And when they were
[28:41] come into the ship, the wind ceased.
[28:44] Then they that were in the ship came and
[28:46] worshiped him, saying, "Of a truth, thou
[28:49] art the son of God."
[28:52] Amen. We ask the Lord this evening to
[28:53] add the blessing to the reading of his
[28:55] word. As you can have your seats here
[28:56] this evening, I want to Amen. by the
[28:58] help of the Lord for just a few moments
[29:00] to speak to you tonight. And if I would
[29:02] title this, I want to talk to you for a
[29:04] few moments on snatched by the divine
[29:06] hand.
[29:08] Amen. Snatched by the divine hand. And
[29:11] you know, amen, as I read this here,
[29:13] I'll say this. I do not believe that
[29:15] God, amen, is interested in replacing
[29:18] us. Ra rather, I believe he is
[29:20] interested in rescuing us. No matter
[29:23] what you're going through, no matter
[29:24] what you're facing, no matter what the
[29:26] problems or situations may be, Amen. I
[29:29] am a firm believer that God, amen, sees
[29:32] that there's more victory, amen, in
[29:34] rescuing you than there is replacing
[29:36] you. Now, when you look here at this
[29:38] word snatch, the meaning of the word
[29:40] snatch, it means to quickly see
[29:42] something, amen, in a rude or eager way.
[29:46] It means to quickly secure or obtain
[29:48] something when a chance presents itself.
[29:51] It means to eagerly take or to accept an
[29:54] opportunity. Amen. Or an offer. So I got
[29:57] to thinking about that how that anytime,
[30:00] Amen. the Lord would snatch something,
[30:02] Amen. to the devil, the way he does it
[30:04] is a very rude way. Amen. But God is a
[30:07] gentleman. Amen. He's only taking what
[30:10] rightfully belongs to him. Now in the
[30:12] book of Matthew the 14th chapter the
[30:14] 31st verse he says immediately that
[30:17] Jesus stretched forth his hand and he
[30:20] caught him and said unto him oh thou of
[30:22] little faith. Amen. Wherefore didest
[30:24] thou doubt? Now when you look here at
[30:26] this word caught, it means to lay a hold
[30:28] of. It means to take possession of. It
[30:31] means to overtake. It means to attain,
[30:33] to lay hold of or to seize upon anything
[30:36] with a hand. It means to take a hold of.
[30:39] Amen. To rescue one from peril. It means
[30:42] to help or to secure. So here Peter is
[30:45] actually coming out on the water. Amen.
[30:48] And he's doing something. Amen. That
[30:50] it's going to take a God to do. A a a a
[30:52] more a natural mortal man. Amen. He
[30:55] cannot just walk out up on the water.
[30:57] Amen. Unless he is accompanied by a
[30:59] supernatural power. So Peter steps out
[31:02] on the water and he begins to walk,
[31:04] Amen. But as he's walking, he begins to
[31:06] take his eyes, amen, off of the Lord
[31:08] Jesus Christ. And he begins to put him
[31:10] on the wind, amen, and upon the waves.
[31:12] And Peter begins to sink. And the
[31:14] prophet of God said, when he started
[31:16] walking on the water, he thought he was
[31:18] getting along. All right. See how big
[31:20] I'm doing. But he started sinking. He
[31:22] didn't say, "Amen. Well, I guess it fell
[31:24] on down to the bottom." Amen. A few
[31:26] bubbles come up and that was all of it.
[31:28] See? Amen. No, he cried out. Amen. So
[31:31] here Peter is walking on the water.
[31:33] Amen. But he begins to sink. Amen. But
[31:36] he does not accept the fact that he's
[31:38] sinking. Amen. But he begins to cry out
[31:40] and say, "Lord, save me." Re said,
[31:43] "Amen." And that eternal hand, amen,
[31:45] reached down and picked him up again.
[31:48] Amen. As he's walking on the water, he
[31:50] is not accepting. Amen. That I'm
[31:52] sinking, but he begins to remember,
[31:55] amen, there's a God who can come on the
[31:57] scene, amen, and can save me from the
[31:59] condition I'm in. So, we begin to cry
[32:02] out. Remember said, "What did he do?" He
[32:04] cried out. Now, I love this. He said,
[32:05] "Peter, Amen, was in the line of duty."
[32:09] Amen. Peter was in the line of duty. He
[32:11] said, "Now, you Christians tonight,
[32:12] you're in the line of duty." Amen. And
[32:14] you're trying to follow the leading of
[32:16] the Holy Spirit. Amen. And maybe a
[32:18] cancer grabs you or a death grabs you.
[32:21] Amen. A tuberculosis grabs you. Whatever
[32:23] it is, amen. But in the line of duty,
[32:25] you have the same right. Amen. That
[32:28] Peter had. Listen. Amen. Peter had a
[32:30] right to call out to God. Amen. In the
[32:33] middle of a condition where he was
[32:35] sinking and he said, "Lord, save me or
[32:37] I'll perish." In desperation, he called
[32:40] out. Amen. And a hand reached and picked
[32:43] him up. He said, "Now, you have the same
[32:45] thing." Amen. But I want you to catch
[32:47] something. Amen. It was not just up to
[32:50] the hand, amen, to reach out, but it was
[32:52] up to Peter, Amen, to recognize the
[32:55] condition I'm in. Amen. I can't get
[32:57] myself out of it. Amen. Amen. in the
[32:59] condition I'm in. I'm going down. Amen.
[33:02] But there's a God who has the ability,
[33:04] amen, to save me from the condition I'm
[33:06] in. And Peter began to scream out,
[33:08] "Lord, save me." He said, "Then we find
[33:11] out in the sinking, amen, that God heard
[33:13] him." Amen. I want you to catch
[33:15] something about that. Amen. That the
[33:17] sinking of Peter did not shut the ears,
[33:19] amen, off of our Lord Jesus Christ. He
[33:22] could still hear Peter's desperate cry.
[33:24] Amen.
[33:26] And the prophet of God said in the line
[33:27] of duty, he started to sink. Now, he
[33:30] failed. He said, "No matter if you
[33:31] fail," Amen. That don't have nothing to
[33:34] do with it. We all fail now. Amen.
[33:36] That's a powerful point to me. Amen. We
[33:38] all fail. He said, "We are a failure to
[33:41] begin with." Amen. But we got somebody
[33:43] standing now. Amen. With a strong hand.
[33:47] Amen. We're all a failure to begin with.
[33:50] Amen. But we got somebody standing now.
[33:53] Amen. with a strong hand who can reach
[33:56] us and take us. Amen. Above the water.
[33:59] Listen, Peter was not to be underneath
[34:01] the water. Amen. But Peter was to be
[34:04] above the water. Amen. But when he
[34:06] changed his focus from the Lord, amen,
[34:08] to the wind and the rain, he be to sink
[34:11] underneath the water. Amen. But he
[34:13] didn't belong underneath it. He belonged
[34:15] above it. Amen. So he did not just
[34:18] settle down and say, "Well, I guess this
[34:20] is the way it'll be." Amen. And
[34:22] sometimes I think that's what we do.
[34:24] Amen. Is maybe after a good meeting or
[34:26] after a good service. Amen. We're
[34:28] walking on the water. We got victory. We
[34:30] got joy. We got a song in our heart. We
[34:32] got a amen in our lips. And all of a
[34:34] sudden something happens and we begin to
[34:37] fall. We begin to sink. Amen. But can I
[34:39] say this? Do not settle. Amen. For
[34:42] failure and sinking. Amen. You are not
[34:44] to be underneath Leosa. Amen. You are to
[34:47] be above Leosa. You are not to be
[34:50] underneath sickness. Amen. But you are
[34:52] to be above it. And there is a hand that
[34:55] can reach down.
[34:56] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[34:57] And can pick you up. Now, I love some of
[34:59] these quotes just lay a foundation here
[35:01] on the hand of God. 1953, brother says
[35:04] this. He said, "His hand can do all
[35:06] things." Again, in 1957, the greatest
[35:09] gift in the Bible, he said, "It takes
[35:11] the hand of God to do something for
[35:14] man." 1964 he said God delivers by his
[35:18] hand. Amen. So the hand of God can do
[35:21] all things. Amen. It takes the hand of
[35:23] God to do something for a man. Amen. But
[35:26] God also can deliver by his hand. He
[35:29] said, "No man come to me except my
[35:31] father draws him first." See, it's God
[35:33] seeking man.
[35:36] You have nothing to do with it. If you
[35:39] ever felt the hand of God, Amen. knock
[35:42] at your heart. Amen. You are a
[35:45] privileged person. If you ever felt the
[35:48] hand of God knock at your heart, you are
[35:51] a privileged person. Now, in the book of
[35:53] First Peter chapter 5, Peter actually
[35:55] instructs us, amen, to humble ourselves,
[35:58] amen, underneath the mighty hand of God.
[36:01] Yes.
[36:01] Now, watch this. That he may exalt you
[36:04] in due time. Look at this word hand. It
[36:06] is by the help or the agency of anyone.
[36:09] Amen. By means of anyone. Figuratively
[36:12] it is applied to God and symbolizing his
[36:15] might, his activity and his power in
[36:18] creating the universe and upholding the
[36:21] preserving amen. God is present amen and
[36:24] he is protecting and he is aiding one in
[36:27] punishing and in determining controlling
[36:30] amen the destinies of men. So the hand
[36:32] of God has the ability, amen, to not
[36:35] only create, amen, but it also has the
[36:38] ability to sustain what has been
[36:40] created. That's why the prophet said in
[36:42] the church age book, he said, not only
[36:44] is he the creator, amen, but he is also
[36:46] the sustainer. Now I say this, the hand
[36:49] of God, amen, actually has the ability,
[36:52] amen, to control the destiny of a man or
[36:55] a situation. Now look what Peter says.
[36:57] He said, "Humble yourself under the
[37:00] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[37:02] in due time." That word due time, it is
[37:04] a fixed and definite time. It is the
[37:07] time when things, amen, are brought to a
[37:10] cross, to a crisis. It is an opportune,
[37:13] amen, or seasonable time, amen, it is
[37:15] the right time. Now, you all know that
[37:17] the same hand, Amen, that has the
[37:20] ability to humble, amen, is the same
[37:22] hand that has the ability to exalt. In
[37:25] other words, the hand of God can bring
[37:27] low and the hand of God can bring high.
[37:30] Now listen, we see that manifested,
[37:32] brother, I'm talking about on the
[37:33] Titanic. He said there they built that
[37:35] big ship. Remember?
[37:37] He said they built that big ship. He
[37:39] said the Americans jealous of their
[37:40] sister England. Amen. They built a ship
[37:42] and they call it the Titanic. And they
[37:44] said not even God could sink this ship.
[37:46] He said but God with his mighty hand,
[37:49] Amen, showed the world that it cannot
[37:51] stand. He said, "Now listen, if you
[37:53] won't listen to the voice of a preacher,
[37:55] Amen. then you'll listen to the hand of
[37:57] God in judgment someday." He said, "The
[38:00] rock and roll all stopped on the
[38:02] Titanic." Amen. And the bands begin to
[38:04] play near my God, to thee. He said,
[38:06] "See, because someday, amen, you're
[38:09] going to change your tomb." Let me say
[38:11] this. The hand of God has the ability,
[38:14] amen, to cause an individual, amen, to
[38:16] change the tomb that they're walking to.
[38:19] Amen. the hand of Satan. Amen. Had them
[38:21] walking to the tune of rock and roll
[38:24] underneath a halty arrogant spirit.
[38:26] Amen. That not even God himself, Amen.
[38:29] can sink can sink the ship. Amen. But
[38:31] God with his mighty hand. Amen. Changed
[38:34] the tune from rock and roll. Amen. Unto
[38:36] near my God to thee and showed them that
[38:39] he is a God and there's no man can raise
[38:42] above him and there's no man can
[38:44] withstand him. Listen, humanity must
[38:47] remember, amen, that we are not the
[38:49] potter. Amen. We are the clay. Amen. And
[38:52] the clay doesn't say to the potter.
[38:55] Amen. But the potter says to the clay. I
[38:57] love Jeremiah 18. It says, "Oh house of
[39:00] Israel, cannot I do with you." Amen. As
[39:02] this potter, Amen, sayeth the Lord,
[39:05] behold, Amen. as the clay is in the
[39:08] potter's hand. Amen. So are ye in my
[39:10] hand, oh house of Israel. Re said, "You
[39:14] have to be born sons and daughters of
[39:16] God. If you want to give yourself to
[39:18] drink or the world or any kind of
[39:20] divination, things like that, that's up
[39:22] to you." See, amen. Using it for the
[39:24] devil. Sure. It's the devil got a hold
[39:26] of you.
[39:28] When God born you here for a certain
[39:30] thing, amen, to do a certain thing and
[39:33] you let the devil get a hold of you.
[39:34] Now, you all can agree that you was born
[39:37] to be sons and daughters of God. See,
[39:40] but you let the devil get a hold of you
[39:42] and you want to become glamour girls and
[39:44] populars and everything else like that.
[39:46] Amen. Humble yourself. Amen. Before the
[39:49] hand of God, amen, so God can make sons
[39:53] and daughters of God out of you. Listen,
[39:55] friends, I believe it's time, amen, that
[39:57] we welcome, Amen, the divine hand of God
[40:00] into our churches, amen, into our homes,
[40:03] into our families, among our young
[40:05] people. See, oh, brother says, "Heavenly
[40:07] Father, Amen. want you tonight, Lord,
[40:09] take each one, Amen, into your hands."
[40:12] See, grant it, Lord, and open faith to
[40:14] their heart, and may the Holy Spirit do
[40:16] exceedingly and abundantly tonight,
[40:18] Lord, as they're waiting. Another place,
[40:21] he said, God takes something that's
[40:22] nothing. Amen. Something that's been
[40:24] cast out. He said, "See, that's what
[40:26] makes me love God's people." Amen. See,
[40:29] now watch. Amen. may cast them out as
[40:31] holy rollers or illegitimate people, but
[40:34] that's when God's ready to pick them up.
[40:37] God's ready to pick them up and do
[40:40] something with them. See, it pleases him
[40:42] that shows that he's God. Amen. He can
[40:45] take nothing and make something out of
[40:47] it. He can take a sinner like me and
[40:50] make a Christian the hand of God.
[40:52] Listen, we underestimate, Amen, the
[40:55] power and the ability of the divine hand
[40:58] of God. He can take a sinner and make a
[41:01] Christian out of him. He can take a
[41:02] drunk and make a preacher out of him. He
[41:05] can take a prostitute and make a mama
[41:07] out of her. He can take a broken
[41:09] situation and take it to the potter's
[41:12] house and let the hand of God come upon
[41:14] it. He has the ability, amen, to change
[41:17] the destiny. Listen, I don't think
[41:19] psychology can do it. I don't think a
[41:22] creed can do it. But I think Jesus
[41:24] Christ who is the same yesterday, today,
[41:27] and forever has all power in his hand.
[41:29] And he's able to change. He's able to
[41:32] transform. He's able to deliver. He's
[41:34] able to snatch. Amen. When we speak of
[41:37] this divine hand. Of course, you know,
[41:39] amen. We are speaking of the hand of
[41:43] God. When you read through the message,
[41:44] you will find brother Brandham. Amen.
[41:46] Refer to the hand of God. He will call
[41:48] it the divine hand.
[41:50] Amen. He will call it the unseen hand.
[41:53] He'll call it the supernatural hand. One
[41:55] place he'll say it's the creative hand.
[41:58] He'll say it's the master's hand. It's
[42:00] the mighty hand. Listen, it's the tender
[42:03] hand of Jehovah.
[42:05] He said, "Watch, it's an eternal hand."
[42:08] Amen. It's an unchanging hand. Now, I
[42:10] got to wondering what is Amen. his
[42:12] unchanging hand. How many's heard that?
[42:14] Amen. God's hand is unchanging. Rem
[42:17] comes along. He says, "Hold." Amen. to
[42:19] God's unchanging hand. He said that's
[42:22] his word. Oh my. Amen. So his word,
[42:25] Amen. his unchanging hand. Then whatever
[42:29] the word can do, it can never change.
[42:32] Whatever the word can create, it can
[42:34] never change. Amen. See, it's not a
[42:36] man's hand. Amen. It's the unchanging,
[42:39] eternal, creative, Amen. powerful hand
[42:42] of almighty God. Now, as you read to the
[42:44] Bible, just some scriptures here, amen,
[42:46] of the divine hand. In Deuteronomy 5:15,
[42:49] it says, "Remember that thou was to
[42:51] serve it in the land of Egypt, and that
[42:53] the Lord thy God, Amen, brought thee out
[42:56] fence, amen, through a mighty hand and
[42:59] by a stretched out arm." In Joshua 4:24,
[43:03] he said, "That all the people of the
[43:04] earth, Amen, might know that the hand of
[43:07] the Lord, it is mighty." Amen. That you
[43:09] may fear the Lord your God forever. I
[43:12] love in Psalms 98:1, David says, "Oh,
[43:15] sing unto the Lord a new song, for he
[43:18] hath done marvelous things." Now, watch
[43:20] this. His right hand and his holy arm
[43:24] hath gotten him the victory. So, there
[43:26] is now a direct connection between the
[43:29] hand of God and the arm of God and
[43:31] victory coming in the church.
[43:34] My goodness. Amen. Sometimes I think
[43:37] that we forget how powerful the hand of
[43:40] God is. Now in Revelation chapter 1,
[43:43] Amen. John there on the aisle of Patmas,
[43:45] you all know that he has a vision and
[43:47] it's actually called, Amen, the Patmas
[43:49] vision. And he actually saw the
[43:51] sevenfold personage of Jesus Christ. Re
[43:54] said, see what he saw was he was
[43:56] watching Jesus Christ unfolding. Now,
[43:58] brother Brand begins to break those down
[44:00] and he comes down to the fifth fold of
[44:02] the revealing and he said, now see right
[44:04] there, he had seven stars in his right
[44:07] hand. Revelation 1:16, he had in his
[44:10] right hand seven stars, and out of his
[44:12] mouth went a sharp two-edged sword. And
[44:14] his countenance was as the sun, amen,
[44:16] that shineth in his strength. And when I
[44:18] saw him, he says, I fell at his feet as
[44:21] dead. Amen. I love this. And he laid his
[44:24] right hand upon me. Amen. He laid his
[44:28] right hand upon me, saying unto me, fear
[44:30] not. Amen. For I am the first. Amen. And
[44:34] I am the last. Amen. I don't mean to
[44:36] stop and start preaching here, but it's
[44:37] just on me. Amen. Do you remember when
[44:39] Jesus come walking on the water and the
[44:42] devil got in the ship and begin to
[44:44] interpret to the disciples that it was a
[44:46] spirit and the father of God said they
[44:48] become afraid of the only thing that
[44:50] could help them. You remember what Jesus
[44:52] said? He said, "Be not afraid. It is I."
[44:56] Amen. What he done was he rebuked the
[44:58] fear by identifying his presence among
[45:01] them. He said, "Listen, do not be
[45:03] afraid. It is not a spooky spirit. It is
[45:06] I, the Lord. And when John fell at his
[45:08] feet as dead. Amen. And the fear come
[45:11] upon him, he laid his right hand upon
[45:13] him and said, "Do not fear, John. I am
[45:16] the first and I am the last. I am he
[45:18] that was dead, but I am alive forever
[45:21] more." I tell you what the devil's
[45:23] trying to do. He's trying to grip our
[45:25] churches with fear. He's trying to grip
[45:27] our young people with fear. He's trying
[45:29] to grip our worship with fear. But I say
[45:31] the same Lord Jesus. Amen. That walked
[45:33] on the water to Peter has come right
[45:35] among the church. And he's rebuking the
[45:38] fear by identifying who he is among the
[45:41] church.
[45:42] Fear not. I am the first. I am the last.
[45:46] I am he that liveth and was dead. And
[45:48] behold, I am alive of I forever more.
[45:51] And I have the keys of death and of
[45:54] hell. Re said those seven stars in his
[45:58] right hand. Amen. They are the angels or
[46:00] the messengers. Amen. Said, "See, what
[46:03] does the hand of the Lord represent
[46:04] then? It represents the strength." Amen.
[46:07] And the power of the Lord. In the church
[46:09] age book, he said their strength was
[46:11] from the Lord. Or they could have never
[46:13] stemmed the tide. They were safe in his
[46:16] care. Amen. For nothing, somebody shout
[46:18] nothing. Amen. Nothing could pluck them,
[46:21] Amen. out of his hand. Neither can
[46:23] anything separate them from the love of
[46:26] God. Let it be sickness, peril,
[46:28] nakedness, famine, sword, life, or
[46:30] death. Amen. They were truly yielded to
[46:33] him and they were kept by his
[46:35] omnipotence. Friends, that's a shouting
[46:37] point. Amen. You're not keeping
[46:39] yourself. Amen. But the omnipotence of
[46:42] almighty God is keeping you from the
[46:44] dangers. It's keeping you from the
[46:46] sicknesses. It's keeping you from the
[46:48] troubles. We are not here by ourselves,
[46:51] but we are accompanied by the hand of
[46:53] God. It's a powerful hand. It's a
[46:56] creative hand. It's the tender hand of
[46:58] Jehovah.
[47:01] It's not a man's hand. It's the hand of
[47:03] God. That's why Jesus come along and
[47:05] said, "My father which gave them me is
[47:08] greater than all." Amen. And no man,
[47:10] somebody shout, "No man
[47:12] is able to pluck them, Amen. out of my
[47:15] father's hand." Amen. No man is able to
[47:18] pluck them out of my father's hand. Now,
[47:21] heavenly father, they are yours. See,
[47:23] they are trophies of the message. They
[47:25] are trophies of the word, the trophies
[47:27] of Jesus Christ. And you said, "No man,
[47:31] Glory to God. No man can pluck them out
[47:34] of my father's hand." He gave them to
[47:36] me. Amen. No man is great enough to do
[47:38] that.
[47:39] Come on, church. No man is great enough
[47:42] to do that. He said, "So keep them,
[47:44] Father, and send them forth as fire
[47:47] brands." Amen. Send them forth not as
[47:50] icicles but as fire brands that have
[47:52] been snatched from the fire and make
[47:55] them burning for your kingdom. I commit
[47:57] them to you in Jesus Christ's name. Now
[47:59] you all heard that phrase before. Amen.
[48:02] Fire brands. Amen. Snatch from the fire.
[48:04] Do you know where that actually come
[48:06] from? It came from John Wesley. Amen.
[48:08] Who actually said, "I am a fire brand
[48:10] who has been snatched from the fire."
[48:13] What happened was is a four-year-old
[48:14] boy, John Wesley's house caught on fire.
[48:17] And the and the history tells us that
[48:19] there was a hand that snatched him,
[48:21] amen, out of the flames to safety. Then
[48:24] again later, he began to pick that up
[48:26] and he connects that to his salvation.
[48:28] And he says he was snatched from the
[48:30] flames of hell when he was headed
[48:32] towards a loss, amen, of both body and
[48:34] soul. Amen. So the first time he was
[48:37] snatched, he was headed for a loss of
[48:39] body. Amen. But when he was snatched a
[48:41] second time, amen, the flames of hell
[48:44] was trying to destroy his soul. But
[48:47] there was a hand that saw an
[48:49] opportunity, amen, to snatch John Wesley
[48:52] and it pulled him from the devil's grip.
[48:54] Church of the living God. Amen. We were
[48:56] born in sin. We were shaping iniquity.
[48:58] We come in the world speaking lies. But
[49:01] there was a hand that was bigger than a
[49:03] man's hand. It was bigger than a
[49:05] preacher's hand. And it came down upon
[49:07] the sea in our soul. And it snatched us
[49:10] from the flames of Leodysa. It snatched
[49:12] us from the creeds and the ideas of a
[49:14] man.
[49:15] Yes sir. Heavenly Father, may the Holy
[49:17] Spirit come and shake every person in
[49:19] here
[49:21] and fill them with the Holy Ghost right
[49:23] now and snatch them as fire brands.
[49:26] Snatch them as fire brands out of the
[49:29] fire. Amen. Just before the coming of
[49:32] the Lord Jesus, catch them, Father.
[49:34] Listen, before the devil traps them
[49:36] somewhere and they be carried away.
[49:38] Listen, I believe we were snatched,
[49:40] Amen. by the divine hand. Amen. To be
[49:43] believers.
[49:44] Amen. I believe that. I believe we were
[49:46] snatched by the divine hand to be
[49:49] believers. Brother said, "Every true
[49:51] believer is in the hand of God and can
[49:54] draw from his love and his power and
[49:57] receive the full benefit of all that God
[50:00] is to the believer."
[50:02] My goodness. Amen. Every believer is in
[50:05] the hand of God and can draw from God
[50:09] all his power, his love, and receive the
[50:12] full benefit of all that God is. Can I
[50:15] say this? We were not snatched, amen,
[50:18] just to be church members.
[50:21] We were not snatched just to be
[50:23] religious people. But according to 1
[50:25] Peter 2:9, ye are a chosen generation.
[50:28] You are a royal priesthood. You are a
[50:31] holy nation. You are a peculiar people.
[50:33] That you should show forth the praises
[50:36] of him who called you out of darkness.
[50:38] Amen. Into his marvelous light. Listen,
[50:42] you didn't find your way in this light.
[50:44] You were snatched by this light. You
[50:46] didn't find your way in this message,
[50:48] but the hand of God snatched you. Amen.
[50:50] Some of us were in creeds. We were in
[50:52] dogmas. We were in tradition. Amen. On
[50:54] the streets or wherever. Amen. But the
[50:57] hand of God, Amen, reached down and
[50:59] snatched us.
[51:02] Pull us out, brother.
[51:04] The Bible said a chosen generation. Now,
[51:06] can I say this to you? A chosen
[51:09] generation is a blessed generation. You
[51:12] know why we are blessed? According to
[51:13] the Bible, the Bible, Reverend picks
[51:15] this up in the church age book. He says,
[51:17] "Another glorious revelation is in this
[51:19] typing of Joseph. Joseph while in Egypt,
[51:22] Amen, was given a gentile bride. And
[51:24] through her he received a family of two
[51:27] sons which was Ephraim and Manasseh. Now
[51:30] Joseph asked his father to bless the two
[51:32] boys. Remember that?
[51:34] And he placed them in front of Jacob.
[51:36] Amen. So that Manasseh, the firstborn,
[51:38] would be on Jacob's right. Amen. And
[51:40] Ephraim was to the left. But as Jacob
[51:43] was about to bless them, he crossed his
[51:45] hands. Amen. So that the right hand fell
[51:48] on the younger. And Joseph cried out,
[51:50] "Not so, father." Amen. For the
[51:53] firstborn to your right. But Jacob said,
[51:55] "God, Amen. cross my hands." So this was
[51:59] more than just Jacob's hands. Amen. But
[52:01] this was God, the divine hand, had
[52:04] crossed Jacob's hand. He said, "Now here
[52:06] in type, we see that the blessing which
[52:09] belonged to the firstborn, the Jew, was
[52:11] given over to the younger, the Gentile."
[52:14] He said, "Through the cross, the crossed
[52:16] hands of our Lord Jesus Christ." Amen.
[52:19] The blessing comes through the cross.
[52:22] Listen friends, don't you ever forget
[52:24] the reason that Gentiles are blessed.
[52:26] Amen. Is because of the cross of
[52:28] Calvary. The Bible said Christ hath
[52:31] redeemed us. Amen. From the curse of the
[52:33] law, being made a curse for us. For it
[52:35] is written, cursed is everyone that
[52:37] hangeth on a tree that the blessing of
[52:40] Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[52:42] through Jesus Christ. That in order that
[52:45] we might receive, Amen. the promise of
[52:47] the spirit through faith. Listen, the
[52:50] blessing of Abraham came to the cross.
[52:52] Amen. To the Jews or to the Gentiles
[52:54] rather because the Jews rejected the
[52:56] cross.
[52:58] Remember the Jews, they rejected the
[53:01] cross. Amen. Therefore, Jesus got the
[53:03] Gentile bride. So by the Jews rejecting
[53:06] the cross, Jesus got a gentile bride.
[53:09] Reverend said this transpired in order
[53:12] that the spirit might become available
[53:14] to the Gentiles. So without the cross,
[53:17] amen, the crossed hands of our Lord
[53:19] Jesus, there is no way that we as
[53:21] Gentiles, amen, could receive the
[53:23] blessing of Abraham. But because of the
[53:26] cross, amen, because of the crossed
[53:28] hands, Amen, we are Gentile people who
[53:32] was alienated and without the
[53:33] commonwealth of God has been made nigh
[53:36] by the blood of Jesus Christ. Listen
[53:38] friends, I don't care if you're broke. I
[53:40] don't care if your car don't work. I
[53:42] don't care if your house is falling
[53:44] apart. If you got the Holy Ghost in your
[53:46] soul, there is a blessing of Abraham
[53:49] resting upon your life.
[53:52] Yes, sir. The Holy Spirit was poured out
[53:54] and the Jews rejected it. Amen. Jews
[53:56] rejected it and the Gentiles received it
[53:59] which was a type of this bride. See, now
[54:01] watch. And the bride of Jesus Christ,
[54:03] she will be miserous Jesus Christ.
[54:06] Hallelujah. She will be baptized in his
[54:09] name. She will be filled with his power
[54:12] and she will be robed in his
[54:14] righteousness. Hallelujah. There she is.
[54:18] Listen, the blessing of Abraham has come
[54:20] upon the Gentiles and has made you a
[54:23] gentile bride and you're not robed in
[54:25] churchity. You're not clothed in creeds.
[54:28] You're not wearing dogmas and
[54:29] traditions. Hey, but the hand of God has
[54:32] come upon your life and has filled you
[54:34] with the power of God. He said, "The
[54:37] same power, Amen, that spoke the world
[54:39] into existence is in those people."
[54:41] Yes. Amen.
[54:43] The same power that spoke the world into
[54:46] existence is in those people that's got
[54:50] the Holy Ghost.
[54:54] Well, glory to God. How many's got the
[54:56] Holy Ghost? Then the same power that was
[55:00] in the world speaking in existence is in
[55:02] you. Can I say this? This is bride time.
[55:06] Amen. We are the gentile bride. So this
[55:09] is your time said the time has come for
[55:11] God Jehovah to rise on the scene and
[55:15] show himself. He always does it just at
[55:18] the junctions of time and that time is
[55:21] now. Amen. The light is shining. Can I
[55:24] say this? Light has come unto Gentiles.
[55:27] Amen. We were born in sin. We were
[55:29] shapen in iniquity. Hey, but we are a
[55:32] chosen generation. We are a royal
[55:34] priesthood. We are a peculiar people. We
[55:37] have been snatched.
[55:40] We have been snatched out of darkness
[55:43] into this marvelous line. So listen,
[55:46] we're not walking in confusion. We're
[55:48] not walking in misunderstandings. We're
[55:50] not walking in questions. We are walking
[55:52] in the glorious light of revelation.
[55:56] Can I say this? We are walking in a
[55:59] revelation. And it's a glorious
[56:01] revelation. And here it is. the Jehovah
[56:03] of the old
[56:05] is the Jesus of the new
[56:08] and he's manifested himself
[56:12] in you,
[56:15] brother Isaac. When that revelation sits
[56:17] on the heart of a believer that the
[56:19] Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the
[56:22] new and he's veiled himself in you by
[56:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Listen,
[56:28] the Holy Spirit is not dead. He's alive
[56:32] again in the redeemed flesh of the bride
[56:35] of Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit, he
[56:38] said, must be alive in the church
[56:40] always.
[56:41] Amen.
[56:42] The Holy Spirit must be alive in the
[56:45] church always. Amen. Leading the church
[56:47] for the age that it's living in.
[56:50] See, to confirm the word that's promised
[56:53] for that age.
[56:55] Now, watch. God spoke the word
[56:58] from the beginning. So much for this
[57:00] age, so much for that age, certain for
[57:03] them age. It always happens just that
[57:06] way. See, and the Holy Spirit, he says
[57:09] it again, must be alive in the church to
[57:13] make this church live its day.
[57:16] So the Holy Spirit in the church is
[57:19] making the church live the word
[57:22] concerning the day that the church is
[57:24] living in. Can I say then the message of
[57:26] the hour has come to us by the hand of
[57:30] God. It did not come from commentators.
[57:33] It did not come from theologians. The
[57:35] prophet of God said, "These messages are
[57:37] all kept until this earthly vessel,
[57:40] until the time of God's appointed time,
[57:42] the last messenger at the earth." All
[57:44] these people has judged at it and said,
[57:46] "I know it's there. I believe it's
[57:48] there." They fought at it. They brought
[57:50] it forth. They produced the things by
[57:52] faith. They believed it. But now, oh,
[57:55] but now it's going to be brought to us
[57:58] in revelation and from the hand of God
[58:02] by vindication. Listen, we are not
[58:05] feeding from the hands of a man. We are
[58:08] not feeding from the hands of a church.
[58:10] But the hand of God has delivered a
[58:13] message into this generation which has
[58:15] pulled you from the darkness of Leosa.
[58:18] It has caused you from the confusion of
[58:20] religion and you're now standing
[58:21] underneath a spout where the shakina
[58:24] glory is coming out. We're not walking
[58:26] by feelings. We're not walking by
[58:28] emotion. We're not walking by sensation.
[58:31] There is an unseen hand and it's the
[58:33] unchanging hand and it's leading the
[58:36] church. It's guiding the church. It's
[58:38] preserving the church. It's sustaining
[58:40] the church. It's the hand of God.
[58:45] Amen.
[58:46] Yes, sir. He said it's pure and clean
[58:50] unadulterated word of God coming from
[58:54] the hand of God.
[58:57] Brother Bear, it's coming from the hand
[58:59] of God. Easter Seal, you who were once
[59:02] dead in sin and trespasses has now been
[59:06] quickened together.
[59:08] To set in heavenly places with Christ
[59:11] Jesus. Woo. He says, "You are feasting
[59:15] on mana from above. You are seeing the
[59:18] hand of God made manifest which is
[59:21] proving the promise of this day."
[59:24] Amen.
[59:25] You are seeing the hand of God made
[59:28] manifest. Now we find then that the hand
[59:31] of God is associated with the favor of
[59:34] God.
[59:35] Amen.
[59:36] In Psalms 102:12, David says, "Thou, oh
[59:39] Lord, shall endure forever, and thy
[59:42] remembrance unto all generation. Thou
[59:44] shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion,
[59:47] for the time to favor her. Yay, the set
[59:51] time is come.
[59:53] Humble yourself underneath the mighty
[59:56] hand of God, that he may exalt you at
[1:00:00] due time." What is due time? It's the
[1:00:03] right time. It's an opportune time. It's
[1:00:06] a seasonable time. Listen friends, Zion
[1:00:09] is a type of the bride. So if this is
[1:00:12] the time, oh God, if this is the time to
[1:00:15] favor Zion, it's the time to favor the
[1:00:18] bride. So God has favored his bride with
[1:00:20] signs, with wonders, with revelation,
[1:00:23] with healing, with miracles, with
[1:00:26] deliverance. He said the old formal
[1:00:27] church ages is gone. And the time that
[1:00:30] God is doing a new thing and he's not
[1:00:32] only doing it here, but he's swept
[1:00:34] around the world everywhere. Yes, sir.
[1:00:36] Amen. Can I say this? The message of the
[1:00:38] hour is the hand of God upon the church
[1:00:42] of God. And it is the favor of God upon
[1:00:45] this generation. Let me say this. God
[1:00:47] doesn't do anything without raising up a
[1:00:50] witness.
[1:00:53] Without raising up a witness of what he
[1:00:55] has done. In Isaiah 43:18, he says,
[1:00:58] "Remember ye not the former things,
[1:01:00] neither consider the things of old. For
[1:01:02] behold, I will do a new thing. Behold, I
[1:01:06] will do a new thing. Now it shall spring
[1:01:08] forth. Shall ye not know it? I will even
[1:01:11] make a way in the wilderness." Amen. And
[1:01:14] rivers in the desert. Listen. I will do
[1:01:17] a new thing. Amen. I will make a way in
[1:01:19] the wilderness. Amen. And I will make
[1:01:22] rivers in the desert. Now, come on,
[1:01:24] church. If you was out in the wilderness
[1:01:26] and you was lost, amen, and a hand come
[1:01:28] down out of the sky, amen, and created a
[1:01:31] way right there and called you into it,
[1:01:34] amen, would you be able to miss it?
[1:01:36] Would you be able to say, "Oh, I don't
[1:01:37] know how I got out of here." No, you
[1:01:39] would testify that there was a hand came
[1:01:42] on the scene and in the middle of
[1:01:44] confusion made a way of escape. Well,
[1:01:47] can I say this? Amen. Denomination
[1:01:49] couldn't do it. Education couldn't do
[1:01:51] it. But the hand of God descended out of
[1:01:54] the skies and it was veiled in the
[1:01:57] pillar of fire and a voice said as John
[1:01:59] the Baptist was sent to forrun the first
[1:02:01] coming of Christ. Your message will
[1:02:04] forrun the second coming. Listen and
[1:02:06] around the world that message has went
[1:02:08] and the prophet said revival fires are
[1:02:11] burning on every hill. Let me say what
[1:02:13] this message is. It is the hand of God
[1:02:16] making a way in the wilderness of
[1:02:18] Leotaa.
[1:02:19] [Music]
[1:02:21] Glory to God. It's the hand of God
[1:02:23] making a way in the middle of confusion.
[1:02:26] They don't know how to baptize. They
[1:02:28] don't know how to have communion. They
[1:02:29] don't know how to pray. They don't know
[1:02:31] how to preach. They don't know how to
[1:02:32] have church order. But a hand come in
[1:02:35] the form of the message of the hour and
[1:02:37] said, "I will make a way in the
[1:02:39] wilderness.
[1:02:41] Your days of wondering will be over.
[1:02:46] Your days of questioning will be over. I
[1:02:49] will bring to you a revelation from the
[1:02:52] hand of God by vindication. Will you
[1:02:55] know it? Oh, you will know it because
[1:02:57] you will walk in it.
[1:02:59] Well, glory to God. I'm walking in the
[1:03:02] way in the wilderness. Yeah, I'm walking
[1:03:04] in the wilderness. It's called Leosa,
[1:03:06] but I'm walking a way out of here.
[1:03:10] Yes, sir. It's a way in the wilderness.
[1:03:13] Now, watch what else he says. He says,
[1:03:15] "And rivers,
[1:03:18] rivers in the desert."
[1:03:21] Now you're out in the desert walking
[1:03:22] around. It's real hot, real dusty, real
[1:03:26] dry. You're real thirsty. No water,
[1:03:29] nowhere. And then out of nowhere comes a
[1:03:32] river.
[1:03:33] Amen.
[1:03:35] Will you be able to ignore it?
[1:03:38] Will you be able to second guess it?
[1:03:41] No. You will see it and you will testify
[1:03:44] of it. Oh church.
[1:03:46] Are you hearing me? So in this
[1:03:48] wilderness it would get so thirsty that
[1:03:51] they would begin to hew out sistns.
[1:03:54] And they would be broken sistns. And
[1:03:56] because they're in a wilderness, they
[1:03:58] don't have a way and they need something
[1:04:00] to drink. So they start hewing out
[1:04:02] sistns which are full of stagnation. But
[1:04:05] a way in the wilderness. Amen. And a
[1:04:07] whale of art teaching water will spring
[1:04:10] up in the desert. Oh church of the
[1:04:12] living God. If anybody got a right to
[1:04:15] shout is the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:18] She's walking in the way in the
[1:04:20] wilderness and she's drinking from the
[1:04:22] artisian well. She's not dying. She's
[1:04:25] living on the hand of God that has
[1:04:28] brought revelation in this generation.
[1:04:30] Yes sir. Can I say this? Man's hands
[1:04:32] came up on Luther's message and man's
[1:04:35] hands came up on Wesley's message and
[1:04:37] man's hands came up on Pentecost. But
[1:04:39] this is the full word.
[1:04:44] He says, "Now it's seed time
[1:04:46] or bride time." Yes, sir. God's church
[1:04:49] is not touched by denomination. There
[1:04:53] will be no denominational manhandling in
[1:04:56] the virgin birth of the bride. No sir.
[1:04:59] Now, I'll say this. God has always and
[1:05:02] then I'll just slow down a little bit
[1:05:03] here. God has always had a witness on
[1:05:06] the earth.
[1:05:07] That's right. Somebody say, "Always
[1:05:09] always
[1:05:09] had a witness."
[1:05:10] Witness.
[1:05:11] Although it got down to one person.
[1:05:13] Sometimes Re said God always had
[1:05:16] somebody he can lay his hand on.
[1:05:20] He said Noah was a witness in his
[1:05:21] generation. How that God by a vision
[1:05:25] revealed to Noah, Amen, how to build the
[1:05:27] ark, brother Barry, and what to use to
[1:05:30] build the ark. So Noah was in the middle
[1:05:32] of a coming destruction. And the hand of
[1:05:35] God brought a vision and said, "Prepare
[1:05:38] an ark to these dimensions to the
[1:05:40] preparing." Amen. And the saving of your
[1:05:43] household. Listen. And he even said
[1:05:45] this. He said, "I want you to make it
[1:05:46] out of a specific type of wood." Not
[1:05:48] just any woodwork. We got to have a
[1:05:50] certain type. See, it must be gopher
[1:05:53] wood. Why gopher wood? It was a soft
[1:05:55] wood which was pliable. And that's what
[1:05:57] makes up the ark was a wood that could
[1:06:00] be easily applied, a pliable wood. B
[1:06:03] said, "That's the believer. That's the
[1:06:05] believer." Amen. Once in the hands of
[1:06:08] God, he is cut down from his own
[1:06:10] self-righteousness of the tree, and he
[1:06:13] becomes pliable in the hands of the
[1:06:15] builder. He's not tossed about with
[1:06:16] every wind of doctrine, but a piable
[1:06:19] that fits right into the word of God to
[1:06:21] be used easily.
[1:06:26] Now, just as Noah was given a vision, I
[1:06:28] believe we are given a vision. The Bible
[1:06:30] said where there is no vision the people
[1:06:32] perish. Let me say this a vision
[1:06:34] actually means prophetic insight or it
[1:06:37] means divine communication. So there
[1:06:40] would actually be two dimensions. They
[1:06:42] would be communicating amen by a vision.
[1:06:45] Re said we must have a vision. See the
[1:06:47] vision comes to the prophets and it's
[1:06:50] the word of the Lord spoken to them. Re
[1:06:53] said, "See, if anything the church needs
[1:06:55] tonight, and what we're trying to do,
[1:06:57] Amen, is bring a fresh vision from the
[1:07:00] presence of God to let the people of God
[1:07:03] see that God still lives and reigns and
[1:07:06] is moving with his church and he will
[1:07:09] until Jesus comes to receive it." See,
[1:07:12] so a vision is the direct word of the
[1:07:16] Lord. It's not an impression.
[1:07:19] Amen.
[1:07:20] Come on now. It's not a man feeling
[1:07:23] impressed to say something.
[1:07:24] Yeah,
[1:07:25] that's good.
[1:07:26] Hallelujah.
[1:07:26] Is that okay?
[1:07:28] It's not a man feeling impressed to tell
[1:07:30] somebody something from the word and say
[1:07:32] that's thus sayith the Lord. No, it's
[1:07:34] actually a vision. The part of God said,
[1:07:36] I'm asked when you call these things
[1:07:37] out. Amen. Do you actually feel
[1:07:39] impressed or do you actually see it? He
[1:07:42] said, oh no, I see it. Now, let me say
[1:07:44] this. We cannot afford to lose our
[1:07:47] vision.
[1:07:48] Can you agree with me? We cannot afford
[1:07:51] to lose our vision. See, because our
[1:07:53] vision is what takes us beyond the
[1:07:56] scene.
[1:07:58] It takes us beyond the scene into the
[1:08:01] unseen. Remember said, "What is a
[1:08:02] vision?" It's another dimension.
[1:08:06] All right? A vision is outside of the
[1:08:09] five senses. It's a six sense. He said,
[1:08:12] "Now see, there's five outer senses.
[1:08:13] See, taste, feel, smell, and hear. Then
[1:08:15] there's five inner senses which is
[1:08:17] conscience, imagination, memories,
[1:08:18] passions, affection. But then there is a
[1:08:21] sixth sense.
[1:08:23] Amen.
[1:08:24] And it is faith.
[1:08:26] So a true believer does not work under
[1:08:29] see.
[1:08:31] He does not work under feel.
[1:08:33] He does not work under taste. He works
[1:08:36] underneath faith. Remember said, see now
[1:08:38] I believe that a man is saved when he
[1:08:40] believes on the Lord Jesus Christ with
[1:08:42] all of his heart and from his heart.
[1:08:43] See, not from his outside conscious.
[1:08:46] See, you are a dual person. You are
[1:08:48] three people in one. You are a soul, a
[1:08:51] body, and a spirit. I believe your
[1:08:53] outward senses, your outward conscious,
[1:08:55] your senses when you're awake. In other
[1:08:57] words, you operate by five senses. Them
[1:08:59] were only given to you to contact your
[1:09:02] earthly home.
[1:09:04] They were not given to you to contact
[1:09:06] your heavenly home. There's actually six
[1:09:09] senses in a human body because he is
[1:09:12] number six in the Bible. He was created
[1:09:14] on the sixth day. He is number six. A
[1:09:17] man is he's got see, taste, feel, smell,
[1:09:19] hear, and faith. See, his faith is what
[1:09:22] sets his destination where he's headed
[1:09:25] for.
[1:09:26] So friends, you cannot lose your vision
[1:09:29] because the vision takes you beyond the
[1:09:31] scene into the unseen. and you actually
[1:09:34] have the ability to see things before
[1:09:37] you even become reality with him. In
[1:09:39] other words, Christopher Columbus said
[1:09:42] that the world is round. So he set out
[1:09:44] as a man of vision. Amen. To prove the
[1:09:47] world was round. He said he could see
[1:09:49] the mass before he could see the ship.
[1:09:51] What was he? He was a man of vision.
[1:09:53] Verse said, "See, now faith is the
[1:09:55] substance of things hoped for. It's the
[1:09:58] evidence of things not seen, tasted,
[1:10:00] felt, smell, or heard. But by faith,
[1:10:03] when he catches the word, now watch
[1:10:05] this. When he catches the word, it sends
[1:10:08] him, oh God, it sends him into a
[1:10:12] dimension that makes it so real to him,
[1:10:15] but he's just as good as he's got it in
[1:10:17] his hand.
[1:10:19] Hallelujah.
[1:10:21] He knows
[1:10:23] something is going to happen.
[1:10:26] Now, watch this. What is faith? It's a
[1:10:28] revelation. Faith is a vision. Somebody
[1:10:32] say, "Well, we need a new vision." No,
[1:10:34] what we need is a revelation
[1:10:38] of the vision we've got. What is a
[1:10:41] vision? He says, "A vision is the
[1:10:43] forecast of future events." See, it
[1:10:46] foretells the thing before it happens. A
[1:10:49] vision is seeing something that is not
[1:10:52] as though it was until it materializes.
[1:10:55] Can I say this? A vision is not looking
[1:10:59] at what is but a vision is what looking
[1:11:02] at will be. See, so what faith does is
[1:11:05] faith catches the vision. And when a man
[1:11:07] once catches the vision of the invisible
[1:11:10] God and knows that he's always present,
[1:11:13] there's something that stabilizes that
[1:11:15] man's thinking. It stabilizes his
[1:11:17] action. And in the time of distress and
[1:11:19] trouble, it'll still make him look
[1:11:21] upward and above the things that are
[1:11:23] happening around him because he's
[1:11:25] looking at the unseen. Amen. Yet by a
[1:11:28] promise. So no matter what happens
[1:11:31] between the time he receives the vision,
[1:11:34] he does not lose sight of the reality of
[1:11:36] the vision he's been given. Oh God, no
[1:11:39] matter how many bad days, no matter how
[1:11:41] many tiring days, no matter how many
[1:11:44] mountain tops or valley lows, he never
[1:11:46] loses the vision because he knows it's
[1:11:50] going to come into reality. Oh church of
[1:11:52] the living God, don't you see? God had a
[1:11:55] vision of a bride and for seven gentile
[1:11:58] ages, they took away and added to the
[1:12:00] word. But in the end time, there would
[1:12:02] be a way.
[1:12:05] Hallelujah. in the wilderness there
[1:12:07] would be a vision come to the church.
[1:12:09] See, can I can I now? Now, let me just
[1:12:11] slow down and say this. Y'all remember
[1:12:12] Michelangelo, right? Michelangelo had a
[1:12:15] vision of what he thought Moses looked
[1:12:18] like. Remember remember he had that
[1:12:19] vision and when he had that vision,
[1:12:21] remember said he worked away at it for
[1:12:23] years. He said with his hand, he took a
[1:12:27] hammer in his sculptor's hand and he be
[1:12:29] to hack away. He began to cut away. He
[1:12:32] began to chop away. He said, "See what
[1:12:34] happened was it become so real to him
[1:12:36] that he seen it and he cried, "Speak."
[1:12:40] Now, let me say this. Michelangelo
[1:12:43] with his hand by vision produced a
[1:12:46] masterpiece.
[1:12:48] Michelangelo with his hand by vision
[1:12:52] produced a masterpiece. You know, we
[1:12:54] find in Mark 16, the great commission.
[1:12:56] Brother Barry, I find it amazing. There
[1:12:58] is a connection between the hand of God
[1:13:01] and the hand of man. And Mark Mark
[1:13:03] 16:18, they shall take up serpents and
[1:13:05] they shall drink any deadly thing. It
[1:13:07] shall not hurt them. They shall lay
[1:13:10] hands on the sick and they shall
[1:13:14] recover.
[1:13:15] They shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:13:18] they shall recover. I want you to look
[1:13:20] at this word lay. The word lay means to
[1:13:22] attack one or to make an assault on one.
[1:13:26] Oh God. So when you come up for prayer
[1:13:29] and a man of God by vision of the word
[1:13:32] lays his hand upon you, Brother said
[1:13:34] like this, what's happening now? He said
[1:13:36] there's a light that's coming from one
[1:13:38] into the other. Now let me just ask you
[1:13:40] this question. How does an evil spirit
[1:13:43] take control of a human vessel and then
[1:13:46] another human vessel lay hands upon that
[1:13:49] vessel and cast that spirit out? You've
[1:13:52] got two human vessels that are meeting,
[1:13:56] one with a possession of a demonic
[1:13:57] spirit and the other with an authority
[1:13:59] to cast that spirit out, but they're
[1:14:01] still humans. Well, the product of God
[1:14:03] said, readers digest picked it up. He
[1:14:05] said they took a brother that prayed for
[1:14:06] the sick and had a sick man praying for
[1:14:08] the man. He said, put a piece of lead
[1:14:10] full, amen, between the man and the man
[1:14:12] that was praying his hand and laid it
[1:14:14] down like this and shot the picture of
[1:14:16] X-ray. And from the man's hand,
[1:14:20] from the man's hand, it showed a visible
[1:14:23] reflection of a ray coming out of his
[1:14:26] hand and going to the other man. God
[1:14:29] have mercy. So from this man who was
[1:14:32] under a vision, believe in Mark 16, was
[1:14:35] an authoritative word. He laid his hand
[1:14:38] upon the sick man. I said, "God knows
[1:14:40] what he meant when he said they shall
[1:14:42] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:14:44] recover." He was laying on of hands of
[1:14:46] this man upon a sick man. And the
[1:14:48] mechanical X-ray, oh God, amen, showing
[1:14:51] the light. Amen. Showing the light that
[1:14:55] was coming from the man's hand and was
[1:14:57] going upon the sick man. Can I say what
[1:14:59] a prophet of God said? He said, "We are
[1:15:01] the lightbearers of this age." So in an
[1:15:05] age of confusion, in an age of
[1:15:07] religiousness, in an age of churchanity,
[1:15:10] you would be snatched by the divine hand
[1:15:12] of God, that you would show forth the
[1:15:15] praises of him, Lord,
[1:15:17] Amen,
[1:15:18] who has called you out of darkness into
[1:15:22] his marvelous light. Can I say what the
[1:15:24] Bible says? It shall be one day which
[1:15:26] shall be known of the Lord, not day or
[1:15:28] night, but it shall come to pass that at
[1:15:30] the evening time it shall be light.
[1:15:35] At the evening time it shall be light.
[1:15:38] Listen, men and women, it's time that we
[1:15:41] found out who you are. The devil's
[1:15:43] trying to hide you back, tell you that
[1:15:45] you're some little tro down something.
[1:15:47] You are not. You are sons and daughters
[1:15:50] of God. The deity is not in heaven. It's
[1:15:54] in you.
[1:15:57] The deity of God is not in heaven. Deity
[1:16:00] is in you. Listen friends, we are not
[1:16:03] church members. We are children of the
[1:16:06] evening light.
[1:16:07] The power of God said the evening times
[1:16:09] come. The church now that was once
[1:16:11] dressed like that little major
[1:16:12] experience we've been through has come
[1:16:14] to a place now. Hallelujah. that the
[1:16:17] people are realizing that the deity and
[1:16:20] the power of the almighty God is living
[1:16:24] in the human being.
[1:16:27] My goodness, the deity of God, the power
[1:16:30] of God, the authority of God, the
[1:16:33] reality of Jesus Christ is not in
[1:16:36] heaven, it's in humanity.
[1:16:39] Can I say this? The divine hand is now
[1:16:42] veiled in the human hand.
[1:16:46] Hallelujah.
[1:16:47] Hallelujah.
[1:16:48] The divine hand
[1:16:50] is now veiled in the human hand. The
[1:16:54] hand that snatched you out of sin.
[1:16:57] Amen.
[1:16:58] The hand that snatched you out of
[1:17:00] sickness. The hand that snatched you out
[1:17:03] of the world is now veiled in human
[1:17:07] hands.
[1:17:08] Amen.
[1:17:09] The Bible tells us we are the members,
[1:17:12] Amen,
[1:17:13] of the mystical body of Christ on the
[1:17:15] earth. I am the vine.
[1:17:19] Ye are the branches.
[1:17:22] Now watch this. He says, "He that
[1:17:24] abideth in me and I in him, the same
[1:17:25] bringeth forth much fruit. For without
[1:17:27] me you can do nothing." He says, "Now
[1:17:31] see, he has no hands but ours."
[1:17:33] He's here,
[1:17:34] right? That's good. That's
[1:17:36] amen. He has no hands but ours. Now he
[1:17:40] said he's here in spirit form.
[1:17:43] No eyes but ours, no ears but ours, no
[1:17:47] tongue but ours. So let's let him have
[1:17:50] everything.
[1:17:51] The secret of this is submitting
[1:17:54] yourself with godly love into the hands
[1:17:57] of a loving father and letting him take
[1:18:00] you over.
[1:18:01] Amen.
[1:18:02] Come on, Clay. Submit yourself into the
[1:18:05] potter's hands and let the potter take
[1:18:08] you over. See, your hands is his hands
[1:18:12] when you're energized from the vine. So
[1:18:15] Jesus is the vine. We are the branches.
[1:18:17] So what is it? It's the revealing of the
[1:18:20] mystery of human instrumentality.
[1:18:23] Remember said, "God don't come down and
[1:18:25] speak it literally with his voice out of
[1:18:27] the heavens, but he wrote it on paper
[1:18:29] and he's expecting me and you to receive
[1:18:31] the Holy Spirit to believe that word."
[1:18:33] And then when we speak that word, if
[1:18:36] it's God's true word, God stands behind
[1:18:39] it.
[1:18:40] Hallelujah.
[1:18:41] If you're saying the true word, God
[1:18:45] stands behind it. That's right. Amen. I
[1:18:47] love this quote. He said, "God performs
[1:18:50] the miracles through the hands of his
[1:18:53] children."
[1:18:54] Hallelujah. God performs the miracles
[1:18:58] through the hands of his children. He's
[1:19:00] the vine. We're the branches. See, Jesus
[1:19:03] Christ, the Holy Spirit, comes into the
[1:19:07] human body and takes a hold of his own
[1:19:10] word and moves. It shows vision, speaks
[1:19:12] in tongues, prophesies. He does all
[1:19:14] kinds of works to confirm his word
[1:19:18] through human instrumentality. You say
[1:19:20] what is an instrument? It is a tool
[1:19:24] or an implement especially one for
[1:19:26] delicate work. It is a person who is
[1:19:29] made use of. Do you realize Moses was
[1:19:32] born to be God's instrument said Daniel
[1:19:34] become an instrument in the hand of God
[1:19:36] while he was away from his own people
[1:19:38] out of his own city away from his own
[1:19:40] church in a strange land. God used him.
[1:19:43] Now you can listen be away from whatever
[1:19:45] you may be. You can be away from all
[1:19:47] your loved ones, be away from your
[1:19:49] church, but you can still be an
[1:19:52] instrument.
[1:19:55] You can still be an instrument in the
[1:19:58] hands of God. Listen, in this age, God
[1:20:01] sent a vindicated prophet, which was
[1:20:03] more than just a prophet. He was more
[1:20:06] than just a pastor. He was more than
[1:20:08] just an evangelist. Amen. He was an
[1:20:10] angel messenger
[1:20:12] unto the angel. Let's put a name to
[1:20:14] that, can we? William, Mary, and Brandon
[1:20:16] of the church of the Leon sins. Write
[1:20:18] these things, Sephi. Amen. The faithful
[1:20:21] and the true witness. The beginning of
[1:20:23] the creation of God. Can I say this? I
[1:20:26] want you to watch how that God chose to
[1:20:29] use Moses to deliver Israel. He said,
[1:20:32] "Now listen, God could have told him
[1:20:33] before he went out, I'll sit my I'll sit
[1:20:35] I'll sit sit I'll sit send my angel
[1:20:38] before thee." Now, God could have sent
[1:20:40] the angel come down, couldn't he? He
[1:20:42] could have let the angel come himself,
[1:20:44] but instead of that, he sent the angel
[1:20:46] to speak through the voice of a man,
[1:20:50] church of the living God. He could have
[1:20:51] sent the angel himself, but he chose
[1:20:54] Moses to veil
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:20:58] to veil the angel in. He said, "God
[1:21:00] always uses man for his work." So, the
[1:21:03] Holy Spirit fell up on men. That's God's
[1:21:06] instrument here on the earth. Now watch
[1:21:08] a prophet turn from how God used Moses
[1:21:11] to deliver Israel from the Egyptian
[1:21:13] bondage to how God was using the seventh
[1:21:16] angel to deliver the children of God
[1:21:17] from the hand of the enemy. He said,
[1:21:19] "Now he is the son of God and I'm just a
[1:21:22] man. This microphone is a perfect mute.
[1:21:25] It can only speak when something speaks
[1:21:27] through it. And so is a man just an
[1:21:30] instrument. He's just a clay. Amen.
[1:21:33] But if Jesus Christ
[1:21:35] can take that person in full control and
[1:21:38] you'll obey his cause, he can preach the
[1:21:41] gospel through him. He can speak with
[1:21:43] tongues through him. He can show visions
[1:21:45] through him because Jesus Christ is the
[1:21:47] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:21:51] Listen friends, the hand of God is in
[1:21:54] this building tonight. But listen, if
[1:21:56] you're looking for a literal physical
[1:21:58] hand to come into the air, you will not
[1:22:01] see it. But he has veiled himself in the
[1:22:04] form of humanity by the baptism of the
[1:22:07] Holy Ghost. Listen, when brother Barry
[1:22:09] stands behind this pull pit, it's not
[1:22:11] just Brother Barry. It's not just
[1:22:13] another sermon. Listen, it's the hand of
[1:22:16] God.
[1:22:19] Come on, I might as well preach. I flew
[1:22:20] all the way out here. It's the hand of
[1:22:23] God. Listen, it's not just a preacher
[1:22:25] who got with somebody and found out
[1:22:27] about your secrets. The hand of God has
[1:22:30] the ability to do a delicate work.
[1:22:34] Are you hearing me? Amen. Amen. Come on,
[1:22:36] church. Amen. Some of you come in here
[1:22:38] on Wednesday night and you're lower than
[1:22:39] a snake's belly and you've convinced
[1:22:41] yourself you're not going to make it and
[1:22:43] you're serpent scene and you're going to
[1:22:45] miss the rapture. And then the man of
[1:22:47] God begins to stand here and say,
[1:22:49] "You're an invincible army. You're a
[1:22:51] powerful church. You're an overcomer.
[1:22:53] You're underneath a blood atonement."
[1:22:55] That's more than a sermon. That's the
[1:22:57] hand of God in human instrumentality
[1:23:01] snatching you.
[1:23:03] Snatching you. He's pulling you from the
[1:23:05] hand of discouragement. He's pulling you
[1:23:07] from the hand of depression. Come on.
[1:23:09] Amen. Some of you get stooped in false
[1:23:11] doctrines and the man of God stands here
[1:23:13] and says, "That's not how it is. This is
[1:23:16] how a prophet taught it." That's the
[1:23:17] hand of God snatching you out of
[1:23:20] confusion.
[1:23:23] Well, glory to God.
[1:23:24] Hallelujah.
[1:23:25] Are you hearing me? It's more than a
[1:23:27] man. It's the hand of God.
[1:23:30] It's more than a preacher. It's the
[1:23:32] snatching of the divine hand.
[1:23:35] Yes, sir. He stood as an instrument. A
[1:23:38] prophet of God stood there. Remember
[1:23:40] said, "God loves to take his children."
[1:23:43] God loves to take his children out of
[1:23:46] the hands of the enemy. I want you to
[1:23:48] watch something. Y'all remember in Ezra
[1:23:50] chapter 8, it actually begins. I just
[1:23:54] want to share this with you. In Ezra
[1:23:56] chapter 8, it begins with the outlining
[1:23:59] the heads of families and the geology of
[1:24:02] those returning from with Ezra from
[1:24:04] Babylon to Jerusalem. So they're going
[1:24:07] from confusion
[1:24:10] Babylon
[1:24:12] unto Jerusalem which was the city of
[1:24:15] peace. Now catch this. There was a total
[1:24:17] of 1,496
[1:24:21] men in that are listed. See, all are
[1:24:23] descendants of prominent Israelite
[1:24:26] families. Let me say what the what what
[1:24:28] I read about this. They were guided and
[1:24:31] protected by God.
[1:24:32] Amen.
[1:24:33] That's right.
[1:24:34] 1,496
[1:24:38] heads of families was guided and
[1:24:42] protected by God. Are y'all ready for
[1:24:44] this? I about shouted when I read this.
[1:24:46] The group successfully completes their
[1:24:49] journey from Babylon to Jerusalem guided
[1:24:53] by the divine hand.
[1:24:58] Glory, glory, glory.
[1:25:00] Listen what he says in Ezra 8:31. He
[1:25:03] said, "The hand of our God was upon us,
[1:25:06] and he delivered us from the hand of the
[1:25:08] enemy and of such that lay and wait by
[1:25:11] the way."
[1:25:12] Come on now. You're in the way in a
[1:25:14] wilderness, but that does not mean
[1:25:16] you're not exempt from devils that are
[1:25:18] trying to snatch you away from the way
[1:25:20] of God. But the same hand,
[1:25:24] the same hand that called you into the
[1:25:27] way will keep you in the way.
[1:25:30] Come on, church. The same hand that made
[1:25:33] the way has the ability to keep you. In
[1:25:36] other words, the same hand that sent the
[1:25:38] message has the ability to keep you in
[1:25:41] the message.
[1:25:44] It ain't you keeping yourself. It's the
[1:25:47] hand of God. You are the creation of the
[1:25:50] creative hand. And that hand has the
[1:25:52] ability to keep you. Now watch this. So
[1:25:54] the divine hand had the ability to take
[1:25:57] them from confusion to peace.
[1:26:01] From confusion to peace. Everyone said
[1:26:04] God loves to take his children out of
[1:26:05] the hands of the enemy. Yes, sir. They
[1:26:07] came out of the wilderness, a 40-year
[1:26:08] journey. Are you ready for this? with
[1:26:11] not a feeble one
[1:26:13] among them.
[1:26:14] Amen.
[1:26:15] You know what the prophet God said? He
[1:26:17] said, "Oh Jesus," in a prayer line, now
[1:26:19] can I just slow down and read this to
[1:26:20] you?
[1:26:22] Is that okay?
[1:26:23] Amen.
[1:26:24] Just as Moses was a delivering angel to
[1:26:27] Israel. I believe we've had a delivering
[1:26:30] angel come among us today. In a prayer
[1:26:33] line, he says, "Now, sister, I want you
[1:26:34] to look this away so I can kind of get
[1:26:36] it talking just a little to you." Now
[1:26:38] sometimes it depends on how long you
[1:26:39] talk to the person how it reveals. I
[1:26:42] have to come in contact with you. See
[1:26:44] sometimes I look around people with
[1:26:46] great faith and just speak what's wrong
[1:26:48] with them and quickly they get healed.
[1:26:50] But I'm trying to fight that off now.
[1:26:52] You see to see just what is going to
[1:26:54] take place. Now do you believe me as
[1:26:57] God's servant? Do you believe with all
[1:26:59] your heart that Jesus Christ God
[1:27:04] has sent me to pray for the sick? And if
[1:27:06] I would or should lay my hands upon you,
[1:27:10] you believe that which you're now
[1:27:11] feeling coming, this between you and I
[1:27:13] now is the spirit of God.
[1:27:15] Amen.
[1:27:17] Here's a woman who's sick. Here's a
[1:27:19] delivering angel. And he says, "There's
[1:27:22] something between us now. It's the
[1:27:24] spirit of God." All right, sister.
[1:27:26] You've suffered quite a while, had you?
[1:27:28] What's wrong with you? You've been
[1:27:30] prayed for before. You've been in lines
[1:27:32] and had prayer. You had prayer at home.
[1:27:34] You're suffering with a heart trouble.
[1:27:36] Is that right? Yes, sir. It's a nervous
[1:27:38] heart. Do you believe that God will make
[1:27:40] you well if I ask him? Come here. Oh,
[1:27:43] Jesus. Now realizing this number one
[1:27:45] enemy takes more people than anything
[1:27:47] else. You sent your delivering angel to
[1:27:51] deliver the people in the name of Jesus
[1:27:53] Christ. May our sister be healed.
[1:27:56] Brother Bam laid his hands. What does
[1:27:59] that word lay mean? It means to lay a
[1:28:01] salt or to attack upon one. So when he
[1:28:05] lay Oh God, when he laid his hand,
[1:28:07] listen, it'd be like if I was praying
[1:28:09] for brother Christopher here and I lay
[1:28:10] my hands on him. Amen. I don't take my
[1:28:12] hand and just punch him and I'm not
[1:28:15] going to punch you. Relax. Okay? If he's
[1:28:17] sick and he says, "Brother Andrew, I got
[1:28:18] a headache." Amen. I need prayer. I
[1:28:21] don't take my hand and say, "Headache,
[1:28:23] come out."
[1:28:25] Amen. But I lay my hand
[1:28:28] and there's a light of God. There's a
[1:28:31] deity on the inside of that hand. And
[1:28:33] when that hand lays upon his head, there
[1:28:36] is an attack that is laid upon that
[1:28:38] spirit that's trying to control this
[1:28:40] young boy's life.
[1:28:43] Are you hearing me, church? I think it's
[1:28:45] time to come back to the reality that
[1:28:48] the hand of God is among this church.
[1:28:51] I think it's time to lay hands on the
[1:28:53] sick and attack the devils. I think it's
[1:28:55] time to lay hands on depression and
[1:28:57] attack the depression spirits. I think
[1:28:59] it's time to lay hands on our babies and
[1:29:01] attack the devils of hell that's trying
[1:29:04] to destroy them.
[1:29:06] Yes, sir. You say, "What are you
[1:29:07] saying?" The church today is God's
[1:29:09] instrument of the earth. He says, "To
[1:29:12] liberate the sick and the afflicted."
[1:29:16] The church today
[1:29:18] is God's instrument of the earth to
[1:29:20] liberate the sick and afflicted. Can I
[1:29:22] say what else he says? Amen.
[1:29:23] He just needs one believer.
[1:29:25] Yeah.
[1:29:26] Amen.
[1:29:29] What he can do if he can ever get one
[1:29:31] person in his grip just so he can hold
[1:29:33] that one person. Are you ready for this?
[1:29:36] If he can get one person in his grip, he
[1:29:39] can put 10,000 to flight.
[1:29:45] One can put 10,000. So two could put
[1:29:49] 20,000. three.
[1:29:51] Oh God,
[1:29:52] could put 30,000. So if there was 50
[1:29:55] believers here, they could put 50.
[1:29:58] [Applause]
[1:30:00] They could put 50,000 spirits to fight.
[1:30:03] Yes, sir. With one person with genuine
[1:30:05] faith, he can put 10,000 devils running
[1:30:09] as hard as they can go.
[1:30:12] Amen.
[1:30:13] What are you saying? I'm saying what a
[1:30:14] prophet said right now. The world is
[1:30:16] gripped. Now look at this word grip. It
[1:30:18] means to take it. It means to take and
[1:30:20] keep a firm hold of. It means to grasp
[1:30:23] tightly. It is of a feeling or emotion.
[1:30:26] It is to deeply affect someone. Now
[1:30:28] listen, a grip is an effective form of
[1:30:32] control over something.
[1:30:35] Amen.
[1:30:36] So when something grips you, it begins
[1:30:39] to control you.
[1:30:40] And if it can get deep enough hold,
[1:30:44] my goodness.
[1:30:45] Amen.
[1:30:46] It will begin to control the way you
[1:30:48] feel.
[1:30:50] That's right.
[1:30:51] It'll begin to control your emotion.
[1:30:54] Now, come on, friends.
[1:30:55] Rever said, "Right now, the world is
[1:30:57] gripped by two great grips." The world
[1:30:59] is gripped by these two things right
[1:31:01] now. The mark of the beast
[1:31:04] or the seal of God.
[1:31:08] Now, watch somebody gripped by the mark
[1:31:09] of the beast. Start talking to them
[1:31:11] about the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:31:13] watch their emotions change. Watch their
[1:31:15] countenance change. Watch their approach
[1:31:18] change because the mark of the beast has
[1:31:20] a grip. Brother said, "Now look, a mark
[1:31:23] is a distinction." I'm going to close on
[1:31:24] this point. It makes a difference. See,
[1:31:27] it separates something.
[1:31:30] A mark is a distinction. It makes a
[1:31:33] difference. It separates something. He
[1:31:35] said, "Now you say you got one mark
[1:31:38] against you, a mark. But you never said
[1:31:41] you had one seal against you."
[1:31:44] Amen.
[1:31:45] Oh, you got one mark against you, but a
[1:31:48] seal is a sign of ownership.
[1:31:51] A mark is a distinction. And the church
[1:31:54] is sealed by the Holy Spirit showing as
[1:31:58] ownership. God owns the church.
[1:32:03] Come on, church. You're not marked by
[1:32:05] God. You're sealed by God. Come on. Some
[1:32:08] of y'all right now say, "Well, I got
[1:32:10] this mark against me, and I got that
[1:32:12] mark against me, and I got that mark
[1:32:14] against me, and I got this mark against
[1:32:16] me, and you got all your marks lined up
[1:32:18] against you." But can I tell you
[1:32:20] something? Not a one of those marks owns
[1:32:22] you.
[1:32:23] That's right.
[1:32:24] If you got the Holy Ghost in your soul,
[1:32:27] the mark against you don't own you. But
[1:32:29] the seal upon your soul is a sign of
[1:32:33] divine ownership. Listen, denomination
[1:32:35] and false doctrine grip humanity. But
[1:32:38] then God sent the message of grace and
[1:32:41] rever you see that now the fifth seal by
[1:32:43] the open of these seals now what you
[1:32:45] have did what God has did for you. Now
[1:32:47] watch by the opening of these seals that
[1:32:50] what you have did and what God has did
[1:32:52] for you and you're ready to surrender
[1:32:54] your life to God. And if he will snatch
[1:32:57] you out of the hands of the antichrist
[1:33:00] that you're now in, would you accept his
[1:33:02] offer?
[1:33:03] Amen.
[1:33:04] Amen.
[1:33:05] You say, "What is that third pull?" It's
[1:33:07] the opening of the word.
[1:33:08] Yes, sir.
[1:33:09] It's Christ
[1:33:12] snatching you from the Antichrist.
[1:33:16] Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:18] It's Christ seizing you
[1:33:21] by quickening power.
[1:33:23] Remember said he is the one who opened
[1:33:24] those seals. He is the seals. For the
[1:33:26] word of God is Christ, and Christ is the
[1:33:28] seals that was open. What is the opening
[1:33:30] the seals then? Revealing Christ. The
[1:33:33] very seven angels which represented the
[1:33:36] seven churches all completed and we
[1:33:38] couldn't even see it. They did. They
[1:33:39] took the picture, not us. And here he is
[1:33:43] standing there. Supreme judge showing
[1:33:46] what he is. Alpha and Omega, the
[1:33:49] beginning and the end. What
[1:33:51] identification? Quickening power did
[1:33:54] that to us.
[1:33:56] Amen.
[1:33:57] Quickening power snatched us from death
[1:33:59] to life. Quickening power gives
[1:34:01] discernment to know what's wrong with
[1:34:03] you and what to do and what you have
[1:34:04] done and what you ought to not done,
[1:34:05] what you should have done and what you
[1:34:07] will be. Quickening power all these
[1:34:11] things.
[1:34:11] Hallelujah.
[1:34:12] See, can I say this to you tonight?
[1:34:15] Amen.
[1:34:15] We are in the hands of God.
[1:34:20] Can I say this to you?
[1:34:22] Spirits that grip you have to turn loose
[1:34:26] when the hand of God comes upon you.
[1:34:28] Amen.
[1:34:29] Amen.
[1:34:30] Can I say this tonight? I lay assault
[1:34:34] against every hand of the enemy.
[1:34:36] Amen.
[1:34:36] Against every spirit trying to grip
[1:34:38] lives and grip homes and grip hearts.
[1:34:40] Amen.
[1:34:41] I lay assault against every sickness and
[1:34:44] disease.
[1:34:44] Amen.
[1:34:45] I lay a salt against every every
[1:34:47] depression and oppression.
[1:34:49] I lay an assault against every
[1:34:51] condemnation spirit.
[1:34:53] You say, "Brother Andrew, how can you do
[1:34:54] that?" I'm preaching the word
[1:34:57] and his word is his unchanging hand.
[1:35:01] Who brought Georgia Carter out of that
[1:35:02] bed? The hand of God.
[1:35:06] Amen.
[1:35:06] But did the hand of God go floating
[1:35:08] through the Carter's house or did a
[1:35:09] prophet walk in there?
[1:35:12] Say, Georgia, get up out of that bed.
[1:35:14] Right.
[1:35:15] The deity of God. Who brought
[1:35:17] Congressman up out of that wheelchair?
[1:35:19] Did a hand of God floating through the
[1:35:20] building and touch him? Or did a prophet
[1:35:22] stand there and say, "I see you in a
[1:35:23] suit and you fell out of a barn loft and
[1:35:25] you've been crippled and you ran for
[1:35:26] senator Congress."
[1:35:28] Yeah. Oh, that's good.
[1:35:30] Amen.
[1:35:30] Listen, somebody say, "What are you
[1:35:31] talking about?" Can I Can I just close
[1:35:33] by saying this? The prophet of God said,
[1:35:35] "The hand of God has brought the word to
[1:35:37] us in Revelation."
[1:35:38] He said, "It's clean, pure,
[1:35:40] unadulterated word coming from the hand
[1:35:42] of God." He said, "We are now in
[1:35:43] heavenly places eating on heavenly mana,
[1:35:46] seeing the hand of God manifested.
[1:35:50] That's good.
[1:35:51] Let me say, how do you know the hand of
[1:35:53] God is among the church? Well, it's a
[1:35:55] real simple illustration. Okay, you went
[1:35:57] outside this morning. Okay. Now, when
[1:35:59] you went outside, it was raining, right?
[1:36:02] Okay. Now, how do you know it's raining?
[1:36:04] Do you get on your phone and look it up
[1:36:06] on the forecast? Do you get on your on
[1:36:08] your computer and look it up? What's the
[1:36:10] best way to find the evidence of the
[1:36:12] rain?
[1:36:14] Get up. Go outside. And when you see the
[1:36:17] grass is wet and the trees are wet and
[1:36:18] your car is wet and the road is wet and
[1:36:20] the and everything's wet, it don't take
[1:36:22] a genius to realize it's rained.
[1:36:25] How do you know? You see the evidence?
[1:36:29] You see that evidence of the rain has
[1:36:31] been among the earth,
[1:36:32] church of the living God. You say, then
[1:36:34] how can you say that you're seeing the
[1:36:37] hand of God manifest when you don't see
[1:36:39] a literal physical hand fall through the
[1:36:41] building? I don't have to. I see the
[1:36:44] evidence.
[1:36:46] I see the evidence of the hand of God. I
[1:36:48] see believers who believe that Jesus
[1:36:51] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:36:54] forever. I see the hand of God who's
[1:36:56] healed the sick, who's saved the lost,
[1:36:59] who's filled with the Holy Ghost, who's
[1:37:01] redeemed for the Listen, I don't have to
[1:37:03] see a physical hand to know the hand of
[1:37:05] God has been upon Calvary Living Word. I
[1:37:08] see the evidence of it. I see it up on
[1:37:10] your homes. I see it up on your church.
[1:37:13] I see it up on your life.
[1:37:15] I see the hand of God. Won't you stand
[1:37:17] to your feet with us tonight as the
[1:37:18] musicians come?
[1:37:19] Amen.
[1:37:20] Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:21] What do you see? I see the eternal hand.
[1:37:25] Listen, you ain't got to lay down and
[1:37:26] get buried underneath all the water.
[1:37:29] You were born to walk on it.
[1:37:32] That's right.
[1:37:32] You ain't got to lay down underneath all
[1:37:33] them problems. You were born to walk
[1:37:36] over top of it.
[1:37:36] Amen.
[1:37:38] You ain't got to become subject to
[1:37:39] confusion and depression and negativity.
[1:37:42] You ain't got to become subject to all
[1:37:44] those things.
[1:37:45] You were born and ordained of God.
[1:37:48] Hallelujah.
[1:37:49] To stand as a witness.
[1:37:52] Hallelujah.
[1:37:53] Of the divine hand
[1:37:55] of almighty God.
[1:37:57] Listen, I believe it tonight, friends. I
[1:37:59] believe the hand of God is among the
[1:38:00] church.
[1:38:01] Amen.
[1:38:02] Yes.
[1:38:03] I believe that hand of God is here.
[1:38:05] Can I say this? I believe we are God's
[1:38:07] property. Amen.
[1:38:09] Said, "Don't you on God's
[1:38:12] property."
[1:38:13] That's right.
[1:38:14] He said, "Oh, brother, stop looking at
[1:38:15] yourself and look at your sacrifice."
[1:38:17] Amen.
[1:38:18] Somebody said, "Well, brother Andrew,
[1:38:19] you you opened up with with failures and
[1:38:21] faults." So, Brother said this. He said,
[1:38:23] "If you can find any fault in that, all
[1:38:25] right, but if you find no fault in that,
[1:38:28] then you're perfect."
[1:38:34] Glory to God. Some of you all are laying
[1:38:36] down underneath things that there's no
[1:38:38] need to lay down underneath.
[1:38:40] And you know what's putting you down
[1:38:42] underneath them is the idea that I made
[1:38:44] a mistake.
[1:38:45] I failed God.
[1:38:47] I was a failure.
[1:38:50] Amen.
[1:38:51] But a prophet of God said, "If you find
[1:38:53] a fault in your sacrifice, then okay.
[1:38:57] But if you find no fault in that, then
[1:38:59] you're perfect."
[1:39:00] Amen.
[1:39:00] Cuz it's not you that God accepts.
[1:39:03] He accepted Christ. and Christ accepted
[1:39:06] you and you are dead and your life is
[1:39:09] hid in God through Christ. You are
[1:39:12] sealed by the Holy Ghost and all the
[1:39:15] devils in hell can't turn you out of
[1:39:17] there for you are God's property.
[1:39:24] You're God's possession.
[1:39:27] You don't belong to the mark against
[1:39:28] you. You belong to the seal in your
[1:39:31] soul.
[1:39:32] You don't belong to the trouble that's
[1:39:33] before you. You belong to the God that's
[1:39:36] behind you.
[1:39:38] The said, "God never looks at you. He
[1:39:40] looks at Christ." Another place he said,
[1:39:42] "Have you often heard me say in prayer,
[1:39:44] take your hands off of God's property."
[1:39:48] Have faith to claim your own. That's
[1:39:49] your right. See, take your hands off of
[1:39:52] her. Take your hands off of him. See,
[1:39:55] faith will do it.
[1:39:57] I love what the prophet of God says in
[1:39:58] this prayer. He says, "Heavenly Father,
[1:40:01] we bring to you this audience and we
[1:40:03] snatch them right out of the hand of the
[1:40:05] devil. Satan, you are defeated and the
[1:40:09] Holy Ghost has exposed you and declared
[1:40:12] that in this generation of the
[1:40:14] wickedness of this nation, yet there is
[1:40:16] a people who's gathered here tonight
[1:40:20] who believes on the Lord God. They have
[1:40:23] seen his presence knowing that it could
[1:40:25] not be a man do that that it is to
[1:40:27] vindicate this Bible and the
[1:40:29] resurrection. Oh Lord God, I pray that
[1:40:32] you'll send the shower of the Holy
[1:40:34] Spirit and power over this audience that
[1:40:37] you'll shake everyone in their senses to
[1:40:40] realize the Holy Ghost is here and has
[1:40:42] made them well.
[1:40:44] [Music]
[1:40:47] Can I read the rest of it? Amen.
[1:40:49] Satan, I defeat you through the blood of
[1:40:53] the Lord Jesus.
[1:40:55] And his vicarious suffering at Calvary.
[1:40:58] You are defeated.
[1:41:02] Satan,
[1:41:03] come out of them.
[1:41:05] Amen.
[1:41:06] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:41:08] I love what David goes on to say. He
[1:41:11] says, "I will be glad and rejoice in thy
[1:41:13] mercy."
[1:41:14] He says, "For thou has considered my
[1:41:16] trouble.
[1:41:18] Hallelujah.
[1:41:19] Hallelujah.
[1:41:19] Thou has known my soul in adversities
[1:41:22] and has not shut me up in the hand of
[1:41:24] the enemy. Thou has set my feet in a
[1:41:28] large room.
[1:41:30] Woo, brother.
[1:41:32] I think it's amazing that Paul God said
[1:41:33] when Moses and Aaron as a type brought
[1:41:35] Israel across Jordan, think of it, there
[1:41:37] wasn't one lost.
[1:41:39] Every one of them crossed Jordan by the
[1:41:41] hand of God.
[1:41:42] Amen.
[1:41:42] Are you ready for this?
[1:41:43] Amen.
[1:41:44] Through Moses. Yes,
[1:41:48] they crossed Jordan by the hand of God
[1:41:51] through Moses.
[1:41:53] Then how much more will we cross through
[1:41:55] death chilly seas by the hand of God
[1:41:58] through Jesus?
[1:41:59] Amen.
[1:42:00] As he extends it to you tonight
[1:42:03] his nail scarred hands.
[1:42:05] Hallelujah.
[1:42:06] How many can say tonight, Lord, I want
[1:42:08] to rise above it.
[1:42:10] I don't want to sink. I want to walk.
[1:42:12] Amen.
[1:42:13] I wasn't born to sink.
[1:42:14] That's right. I wasn't born to be a
[1:42:16] failure.
[1:42:17] That's right.
[1:42:18] I was born to walk on the water.
[1:42:21] I was born to walk in power.
[1:42:23] I was born to walk in reality.
[1:42:26] I was born to walk in authority.
[1:42:28] Amen.
[1:42:28] I was born to walk in faith.
[1:42:31] How many says, "Lord, lay your hand upon
[1:42:34] the situation tonight."
[1:42:35] Amen.
[1:42:37] Amen. Maybe you're Peter here tonight.
[1:42:39] Amen.
[1:42:40] And you're looking at the winds and
[1:42:42] you're looking at the waves and you're
[1:42:43] looking at the water and you're looking
[1:42:45] at everything but what you should be
[1:42:47] looking at.
[1:42:49] How many can say tonight, Lord, I want
[1:42:51] to rise above it.
[1:42:53] How many can say, "Lord, save me."
[1:42:56] If you don't save me, I'll perish.
[1:42:58] Amen. But if you'll reach down your
[1:43:00] eternal hand
[1:43:02] to me,
[1:43:03] if you'll extend your hand to me,
[1:43:08] let's bow our hearts together tonight.
[1:43:12] Maybe you're in a situation tonight.
[1:43:14] Maybe you're sick in your body or facing
[1:43:17] a problem. The devil's telling you it's
[1:43:22] impossible.
[1:43:23] You can't come out of it.
[1:43:25] You can't rise above it.
[1:43:28] Maybe the devil's telling you you got to
[1:43:30] die underneath it.
[1:43:32] But I wonder tonight as a assembly here
[1:43:35] with your heads bowed and your eyes
[1:43:36] closed. I wonder if there be one tonight
[1:43:39] could say, "Lord, save me.
[1:43:43] Your hand is eternal.
[1:43:46] Your hand is not shortened.
[1:43:48] Neither
[1:43:50] is your ear heavy
[1:43:52] that you cannot hear." Amen.
[1:43:55] Lord, I read Isaiah 59. I read Matthew
[1:43:58] 14.
[1:44:00] And what you said in Isaiah 59, you done
[1:44:03] in Matthew 14.
[1:44:05] When Peter screamed out, "Lord,
[1:44:08] save me or I'll perish."
[1:44:11] And your hand wasn't shortened by
[1:44:13] Peter's doubt.
[1:44:15] Your hand wasn't shortened by Peter's
[1:44:17] change of focus.
[1:44:20] But Lord, you extended your hand to
[1:44:21] Peter in that situation.
[1:44:24] You snatched him.
[1:44:26] Thank you,
[1:44:27] Lord. I heard your prophet say that that
[1:44:28] hand is eternal.
[1:44:30] Amen.
[1:44:31] Which means it had no beginning.
[1:44:34] It has no end.
[1:44:36] Which means what it's done before,
[1:44:38] it can do again.
[1:44:40] Lord, I'm Peter tonight.
[1:44:43] You see this situation?
[1:44:45] Yes.
[1:44:45] You see this problem?
[1:44:48] It looks like it's going to sink us.
[1:44:49] Lord, Lord,
[1:44:52] save me.
[1:44:54] Lord Jesus,
[1:44:56] you see this situation in our home. Save
[1:44:58] us, Lord.
[1:44:59] Yes,
[1:44:59] Lord.
[1:45:00] Lord, you see this situation in our
[1:45:02] church, Lord.
[1:45:03] Yes.
[1:45:04] Save us, oh God.
[1:45:06] And his hand will come right down to
[1:45:08] where you are.
[1:45:12] Hallelujah.
[1:45:13] Hallelujah.
[1:45:14] Heavenly Father, we love you tonight.
[1:45:15] Amen.
[1:45:17] Lord, we thank you for the anointing
[1:45:18] that we feel among us here tonight.
[1:45:21] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:45:22] Lord, we thank you for the reality of
[1:45:23] your presence.
[1:45:25] Lord, we thank you for the authority of
[1:45:27] your word, Lord.
[1:45:29] Father, we stand here tonight upon the
[1:45:31] authority of your spoken word.
[1:45:33] And Lord, your prophet said is human
[1:45:35] instrumentality.
[1:45:37] Lord, as long as we're speaking that
[1:45:39] word, you're here to back up that word
[1:45:42] and to confirm that word. Now Lord, I
[1:45:45] don't know what giant is out in front of
[1:45:46] these Davids tonight. I don't know what
[1:45:49] Goliath is out in front of them. But
[1:45:51] Lord, I know there's a David on the
[1:45:53] inside of them.
[1:45:55] And Lord, your prophet said that David
[1:45:56] took his hand. He reached down and
[1:45:59] picked up a slingshot. Lord, your
[1:46:01] prophet said we have a slingshot.
[1:46:04] He said it's the Old and the New
[1:46:05] Testament.
[1:46:06] Amen.
[1:46:06] He said it's held together by Jesus
[1:46:08] Christ.
[1:46:10] He said, "When we pick it up and put a
[1:46:11] rock in it and sling it at that devil,"
[1:46:14] he said, "It takes a strong hand of
[1:46:15] faith.
[1:46:18] It takes a strong arm of faith."
[1:46:21] Lord, I know your word is true tonight.
[1:46:24] And I know every Goliath before this
[1:46:26] congregation has to fall.
[1:46:30] Lord, may you reach down your hand
[1:46:31] tonight. Amen.
[1:46:33] Lord, if there be a young person here,
[1:46:34] Lord, Father, maybe they're drowning,
[1:46:37] sinking underneath the problems of life,
[1:46:40] the pressures of the teenage years.
[1:46:43] May you reach your head down to them,
[1:46:44] Lord.
[1:46:46] Maybe there's a home here tonight, Lord.
[1:46:48] They're seeking beneath pressures. The
[1:46:51] devil's reminding them of their failures
[1:46:53] and their faults.
[1:46:55] May you reach down your hand
[1:46:58] in Jesus name.
[1:47:00] Reach down your hand here tonight.
[1:47:03] Maybe a sickness has grabbed one of
[1:47:05] these believers.
[1:47:07] That sickness is trying to sink them.
[1:47:09] Reach down your hand tonight, Lord.
[1:47:12] Maybe an old spirit of depression has
[1:47:15] reached out and got a hold of them. It's
[1:47:18] got a grip. It's got a grip in their
[1:47:21] spirit, Lord.
[1:47:23] It's affecting their emotions.
[1:47:25] It's affecting the way they worship.
[1:47:28] It's affecting the way they praise. It's
[1:47:30] affecting the way they serve you.
[1:47:33] Lord, I pray you would reach down your
[1:47:34] hand. Oh God,
[1:47:37] may you snatch them out of that
[1:47:38] depression. Lord,
[1:47:41] maybe an anxiety spirit has come up on
[1:47:43] them.
[1:47:44] It's controlling the places they go.
[1:47:46] Lord, controlling their fellowship, oh
[1:47:49] God. Father, may you snatch them out of
[1:47:51] it
[1:47:54] in Jesus name.
[1:47:57] Hallelujah.
[1:47:58] Every head bowed, every eye closed,
[1:48:00] maybe you just raise your hands tonight
[1:48:02] and say, "Lord,
[1:48:03] Lord, save me.
[1:48:06] You know where I'm at.
[1:48:08] You know what I need.
[1:48:11] Lord, save me.
[1:48:13] Hallelujah.
[1:48:15] Hallelujah.
[1:48:16] You love the Lord tonight.
[1:48:19] Lord, save me."
[1:48:21] Hallelujah.
[1:48:24] We thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:48:26] our pastor would come tonight.
[1:48:30] May we just sing this? You know that
[1:48:32] song when he reached down his hand
[1:48:34] when he reached down his hand for me.
[1:48:37] He had to reach way down.
[1:48:38] Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:40] Amen.
[1:48:41] Amen.
[1:48:44] Maybe try this.
[1:48:48] And he reached
[1:48:50] down his hand
[1:48:53] for me.
[1:48:59] Then he reached
[1:49:01] way down
[1:49:05] for me.
[1:49:09] Oh, I was lost
[1:49:12] and undone
[1:49:15] without God.
[1:49:18] for his son
[1:49:20] when he reached
[1:49:23] down his hand
[1:49:26] for me. One more time.
[1:49:31] Oh, when he reaches
[1:49:35] God bless you, friend.

[1:51:38] but I just want to invite anybody
[1:51:41] tonight that wants to have a hand laid
[1:51:44] upon them. If they're afflicted in any
[1:51:47] way, shape, or form tonight, if God has
[1:51:51] spoken to you,
[1:51:53] I want to open this up. I don't do this
[1:51:55] often, but I feel extremely led tonight.
[1:51:57] If you want a touch from God, if you
[1:51:59] want to feel that ray of light come into
[1:52:02] your life, if you want that devil God

[2:12:29] those who might be listening somewhere
[2:12:30] else, Father, even to those who might
[2:12:33] listen later, Lord, even to this entire
[2:12:37] world, Father, through the messenger of
[2:12:40] this age, Lord, that message that you
[2:12:42] gave to him, Lord Jesus, Father, you
[2:12:45] reached out your hand to each and every

[2:13:35] you and we thank you for your goodness
[2:13:37] and your tender mercies." Lord, we pray
[2:13:39] that you would just go with each one,

[2:13:58] and every need so sovereignly that they
[2:14:01] would see that evidence in their lives,

[2:14:09] your faith. We thank you for each life
[2:14:12] here tonight, Lord. We thank you for
[2:14:14] each life that's traveling, Lord, each
[2:14:16] member of this body here. We pray that
[2:14:18] you would sovereignly keep your hand
[2:14:19] upon them, Lord Jesus. That you would
[2:14:22] bless their times away. That you would
[2:14:24] keep them safe while they travel and
[2:14:26] Lord bring them home safely at the
[2:14:28] appointed time.

[2:14:31] would just restore Brother Andrew's
[2:14:33] strength, Father.
[2:14:35] Lord, that you would just allow him,
[2:14:37] Father, to be used by you again
[2:14:39] tomorrow, Father. That we would be able
[2:14:41] to pull on you through our brother,
[2:14:44] Father. Lord Jesus, we just ask that you
