[54:45] wife sister Sabina and brother Paul from
[54:48] Lethbridge this morning
[54:50] [Applause]
[54:53] certainly in an effort to travel that
[54:56] kind of distance to be in service so I
[54:58] trust the Lord richly blesses you
[55:02] now as we uh
[55:04] we prepare to move forward we just have
[55:06] a couple of announcements I wanted to
[55:08] make we have the special meetings that
[55:10] we've been invited to at the end time
[55:12] message Tabernacle July 27th to 30th I
[55:16] believe it'll be a wonderful time of
[55:18] fellowship and uh just feeding at the
[55:21] table of the lord we have brother Ron
[55:23] Spencer will be coming and I believe
[55:26] Brother Ray Erickson or brother Nathan
[55:28] Erickson will be there as well so it
[55:30] would be a wonderful time just to
[55:31] fellowship with the Saints it's always a
[55:34] good time to get together with the bride
[55:35] of Jesus Christ
[55:37] and so that's July 27th to 30th if you
[55:40] need more any more information by all
[55:42] means just reach out or you can even
[55:44] look at the end time message Tabernacle
[55:45] website and we'll have it there as well
[55:48] one last thing I want to mention is that
[55:51] we had requested a little while ago if
[55:54] anybody has the desire in their heart to
[55:56] serve in the body of Christ here in
[55:58] Calgary to put their name forward and we
[56:00] had two names come forward uh one
[56:03] brother said that he would he would do
[56:04] whatever he we needed help with in the
[56:07] body and we're still working on that and
[56:09] one of the other brothers said that he
[56:11] wanted to position himself in the office
[56:13] of a deacon and so I had said that's a
[56:17] wonderful desire according to the word
[56:19] of God we certainly need another Deacon
[56:21] in our body brother Phil mcgowby he was
[56:25] a deacon until he decided to move and so
[56:28] we have a hole that he has left so
[56:31] Brother Don snow has put his name
[56:32] forward for the office of a deacon and
[56:36] so we've prayed about this for many
[56:37] months it's not a new discussion and
[56:40] we've talked it over with the deacons
[56:41] and everyone is in uh in one mind about
[56:45] it that it would be a good thing for the
[56:47] body here so I just want to read in the
[56:49] scripture First Timothy chapter 3 verse
[56:52] 8. you don't have to turn there just for
[56:54] time's sake I don't want to take too
[56:55] much time here but it says likewise must
[56:58] deacons be grave
[57:00] not double tongued not given to much
[57:03] wine not greedy of filthy looker
[57:07] holding the mystery of the faith in a
[57:10] pure conscience
[57:12] and let these also first be proved
[57:15] then let them use the office of a deacon
[57:18] being found blameless
[57:20] even so must their wives be grave not
[57:23] slanderers
[57:25] sober faithful in all things
[57:28] let the deacons be the husbands of one
[57:30] wife
[57:31] ruling their children and their own
[57:34] houses well
[57:35] for they that
[57:37] have used the office of a deacon well
[57:40] purchased to themselves a good degree
[57:43] and great boldness in the faith which is
[57:46] in Christ Jesus
[57:48] but I believe I have witnessed as I'm
[57:51] sure many others if not everyone has
[57:53] seen these attributes in our brother Don
[57:56] and we know that this is not something
[57:58] that's taken lightly the deacons are to
[58:02] assist the pastor and everybody in the
[58:05] body when there's a need so we're
[58:07] certainly uh we're certainly excited to
[58:09] see someone put their name forward it's
[58:11] a it's a major step and it's an
[58:14] obligation and you know brother Branham
[58:17] says it that God will hold us
[58:18] accountable for those positions that we
[58:20] put ourselves in
[58:22] so we certainly want to thank Brother
[58:24] Don and sister Rebecca because it's not
[58:27] just a a one-person thing even the word
[58:30] of God says it's about the man and the
[58:32] wife and uh we're certainly thankful for
[58:36] a body of Believers people who are
[58:38] willing to put their lives ahead of
[58:40] others to serve the body
[58:43] so what we've determined is we will
[58:46] we will initiate this office with
[58:48] Brother Don for six months and uh after
[58:52] the six months we'll actually take a
[58:53] vote with the regular votes for the
[58:55] church which will likely be in February
[58:58] of next year so early in the year we
[59:01] will take a vote to verify that he feels
[59:05] good in the office of a deacon and that
[59:07] the body of Christ here in Calgary
[59:09] receives him in the office
[59:12] so please take the time to shake brother
[59:15] Don's hand
[59:17] and just encourage him as he steps out
[59:19] by faith
[59:28] and without any further delay I would
[59:31] like to call on brother Ben
[59:34] if we could just sing this song again
[59:35] Almighty infinite father as we invite
[59:38] our brother to come and just take his
[59:40] Liberty
[59:42] know how it goes
[59:44] the way it works
[59:45] is when he comes up here we can just go
[59:48] with his notes and the thoughts that he
[59:50] has in his mind as a human or we can say
[59:53] Amen to the word and we can pull on the
[59:55] word and we can have God discern the
[59:57] needs in our very midst right at every
[59:59] one of our lives in every one of our
[1:00:01] homes and every one of our hearts
[1:00:04] take our brother right off of his notes
[1:00:06] where he'll say I don't even know where
[1:00:07] that came from then he'll remember right
[1:00:11] away

[1:04:56] Lord will bless us I know we are
[1:04:58] standing
[1:05:00] I want us to read from the scripture
[1:05:02] before you see that let's quickly turn
[1:05:04] our Bibles to
[1:05:05] ask the book of Acts chapter 27.
[1:05:09] reading from Verse 18 to verse
[1:05:13] 25 Acts
[1:05:23] acts 27 verse 18.
[1:05:26] oh
[1:05:31] are we being exceedingly tasked
[1:05:35] with agree with a tempest
[1:05:38] the next day the Latin the ship
[1:05:42] and the third day we cast out with our
[1:05:46] own hands
[1:05:47] the tackling of the ship
[1:05:50] and when neither son no stars in many
[1:05:54] days appeared
[1:05:56] and no small temples lay on us
[1:05:59] our hope that we should be saved was
[1:06:03] taken away
[1:06:04] but after a long abstinence
[1:06:07] Paul stood forth in the midst of them
[1:06:10] and said sounds
[1:06:13] we should have hearkened unto me
[1:06:16] and not have lose from crit
[1:06:19] and to have gained this harm and loss
[1:06:25] and now I exalt you to be of Gucci
[1:06:30] foreign
[1:06:32] of any man's life among you bought the
[1:06:36] ship
[1:06:37] for they are stood by me this night
[1:06:41] the angel of God
[1:06:43] whose I am are whom I serve
[1:06:47] saying fear no Paul
[1:06:50] that must be brought before Caesar and
[1:06:53] Lord God are giving thee all them
[1:06:57] that say with thee
[1:06:59] we are forces
[1:07:01] be of Gucci
[1:07:04] for
[1:07:05] I believe God that it shall be even as
[1:07:10] it was told me
[1:07:12] may the Lord Jesus add His blessings to
[1:07:14] read of his word
[1:07:16] God bless you every seated praise he the
[1:07:19] Lord
[1:07:19] once again I welcome us back to church
[1:07:21] this morning
[1:07:25] I quickly want to go through this
[1:07:27] someone
[1:07:28] amen
[1:07:29] [Music]
[1:07:34] the password last Sunday told me
[1:07:37] to preach today whatever the Lord puts
[1:07:41] in my mind
[1:07:42] and that is why I'm here
[1:07:45] and this is what you put in my mind
[1:07:48] well however on the
[1:07:50] on on Wednesday he started the preaching
[1:07:54] so I want to continue from where I
[1:07:56] stopped
[1:07:57] blessed be the neighborhood
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:02] we are living in such a
[1:08:06] a dangerous world
[1:08:08] the world we live in is filled with
[1:08:11] crisis
[1:08:12] uncertainties
[1:08:14] problems everywhere
[1:08:18] uh but the people of the world don't
[1:08:20] seem to know
[1:08:22] that they are in trouble
[1:08:26] we talk about
[1:08:29] Dark Ages
[1:08:32] to me I don't think there's any age
[1:08:36] that is as dark as a solution Church age
[1:08:43] if you remember the you know discuss
[1:08:45] that the prophet Drew about the ages the
[1:08:48] darkest of the old ages acceleration
[1:08:50] Church age
[1:08:53] but it doesn't seem so
[1:08:57] and that is where the problem lies
[1:09:00] that is why the deceit lies
[1:09:02] and that is where we have to be very
[1:09:04] very careful
[1:09:07] the people are in problem but they don't
[1:09:11] know
[1:09:13] the Bible said
[1:09:15] that they are poor
[1:09:18] they are blind
[1:09:20] they are miserable
[1:09:22] but they don't know
[1:09:24] but thanks be to God
[1:09:27] that has another set of people upon the
[1:09:30] face of the Earth
[1:09:31] that knows the condition of the age
[1:09:35] and I pray that God will help us
[1:09:38] so this morning
[1:09:39] I I want to tell you to be a gutier
[1:09:44] amen
[1:09:46] in in in John I think John 16
[1:09:50] that the Lord spoke to the disciples
[1:09:54] as a popular scripture
[1:09:56] John 16 let me quickly read it I think
[1:10:00] for 32
[1:10:01] he said uh
[1:10:04] behold they are coming
[1:10:06] yeah it's not come that you shall be
[1:10:09] scattered every man to his own
[1:10:12] I shall leave me alone
[1:10:15] and yet I'm not alone because the father
[1:10:18] is with me
[1:10:20] these things I have spoken unto you
[1:10:24] that in me you might have peace
[1:10:29] is only in Christ that we can have peace
[1:10:34] in the world you shall have tribulation
[1:10:38] but be a good chair
[1:10:40] I have overcome the world
[1:10:43] blessed be the name of the Lord so I
[1:10:45] want to accept you all this morning
[1:10:47] no matter the trouble we are going
[1:10:50] through as we assisted here I know we
[1:10:52] have challenges
[1:10:54] if you have it could be Financial or
[1:10:57] whatever it is I want to tell you that
[1:10:59] it should be a good year somebody has
[1:11:02] overcome for us
[1:11:05] amen he came after us he overcame and
[1:11:09] has given the victory unto us and
[1:11:12] because he came and overcame that is why
[1:11:16] we should be of good cheer
[1:11:18] it's not because of fears are happening
[1:11:20] if you look at this thing that happened
[1:11:22] it is hopeless
[1:11:24] miserable
[1:11:28] if you think about the conditions of the
[1:11:30] world well brethren we should be a good
[1:11:33] chair because Jesus went ahead of us
[1:11:37] overcome for us blessed be the name of
[1:11:39] the Lord this morning
[1:11:42] I'm not going to talk about heaven
[1:11:45] you know we talk so much about heaven
[1:11:49] I'm not going to talk about heaven this
[1:11:51] morning
[1:11:52] because that's no need to talk about
[1:11:54] heaven
[1:11:55] Heaven is a prepared place for a
[1:11:58] prepared people
[1:11:59] Heaven is a place that God has made for
[1:12:02] his children
[1:12:03] and if a child of God you will be in
[1:12:05] heaven
[1:12:07] because you have no place in hell
[1:12:10] there's no space for your health
[1:12:13] your place is heaven so if you are saved
[1:12:16] fill the Holy Ghost you are going to
[1:12:18] heaven
[1:12:19] so that is not a problem
[1:12:22] go to heaven is not a problem
[1:12:25] the problem
[1:12:27] is
[1:12:29] the space between here and Heaven
[1:12:33] and if you notice in the ministry of the
[1:12:35] Lord Jesus Christ he spoke more about
[1:12:37] this face you know in heaven
[1:12:40] there's no Satan in heaven
[1:12:43] no sickness no trouble no trust no
[1:12:48] temptation it's just rest
[1:12:52] but here that's where the problem is he
[1:12:54] wants to talk about the present time
[1:12:58] that is what the problem is
[1:13:00] the Bible said I think it is
[1:13:03] I can't remember now uh somewhere and I
[1:13:06] said my people perish
[1:13:08] for lack of knowledge
[1:13:13] and the knowledge
[1:13:15] is the work of God
[1:13:18] and the way we need to apply the word of
[1:13:21] God now
[1:13:24] for our lives
[1:13:26] here we are this morning
[1:13:28] he left her home
[1:13:31] you left your businesses
[1:13:33] you left everything and you you you just
[1:13:37] you got out here why why are you here
[1:13:39] where are we seated
[1:13:41] what is he needs for us
[1:13:46] do you know someone other questions
[1:13:47] sometime in the scriptures I think it
[1:13:50] was Peter
[1:13:52] he said Lord we have left our houses we
[1:13:54] left everything I follow you so what is
[1:13:58] the news for us
[1:14:00] I thought it's good we did we did that
[1:14:01] let me if I can quickly get it now uh I
[1:14:05] think it was better said in in Mark The
[1:14:08] Book of Mark that means if I can get it
[1:14:10] now
[1:14:11] he said what is in it for us Mark 10
[1:14:15] somewhere there
[1:14:17] uh Mark 10 Mark 10 I think 28. the Peter
[1:14:22] began to say unto his law we have left
[1:14:25] all I have followed thee
[1:14:30] but I'm actually put in a better way
[1:14:33] especially ask what is the need there
[1:14:35] for us and Jesus answered and said
[1:14:38] verily I said unto you
[1:14:42] there's no man as I have left
[1:14:45] house
[1:14:47] or brethren
[1:14:49] or sisters
[1:14:51] or father
[1:14:53] or mother
[1:14:55] or wife
[1:14:56] or children
[1:14:58] or Lance
[1:15:01] for my sake
[1:15:03] at the Gospels
[1:15:05] listen but he shall receive
[1:15:08] a hundred fold
[1:15:11] now in this time
[1:15:16] are you following me now now now
[1:15:20] houses
[1:15:22] and brethren
[1:15:24] and sisters and mothers
[1:15:27] and children
[1:15:29] and lands with persecution
[1:15:33] and in the world to come eternal life
[1:15:37] did you get your graduate so there is
[1:15:40] something for us they are now there is a
[1:15:43] privilege that's that's something for
[1:15:46] the source and Daughters of God right
[1:15:49] now
[1:15:52] sometimes
[1:15:54] we believe us we shy away from
[1:15:58] our challenges
[1:16:02] and we need to face it
[1:16:05] here we are this morning
[1:16:08] people from different parts of the world
[1:16:10] my brothers from Africa Africa is far
[1:16:13] from Canada
[1:16:18] yeah
[1:16:19] I don't think they are here because of
[1:16:21] to see the snow
[1:16:25] I don't think so
[1:16:27] I I think they are here
[1:16:29] to make a living
[1:16:32] maybe in a better environment
[1:16:36] is that true
[1:16:38] that is true
[1:16:40] that is the truth
[1:16:42] money
[1:16:48] uh
[1:16:49] but we shy away from it
[1:16:54] we don't have to talk about it
[1:16:57] sometimes we fight difficult God please
[1:16:59] give me money
[1:17:01] it's just maybe it's a worldly thing
[1:17:04] it's sinful but we live off because of
[1:17:08] that
[1:17:10] we go to work because of that sometimes
[1:17:13] we live service because of that
[1:17:15] it is the truth
[1:17:20] well that is a right way to approach it
[1:17:24] there's a way
[1:17:26] God has made for the source and for his
[1:17:28] sons and daughters to approach it
[1:17:32] amen
[1:17:33] I don't care what you are going through
[1:17:35] this morning
[1:17:36] whether you are sick
[1:17:39] or you have some challenges Financial
[1:17:41] whatever God has made a way for you
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:48] the problem is to follow God's provided
[1:17:52] way
[1:17:54] and that is what we want to look at this
[1:17:57] morning
[1:17:58] here let's talk a little bit about
[1:18:00] brother Paul before we move on
[1:18:03] but our Paul was in that ship
[1:18:06] in that ship
[1:18:10] he represented the kingdom of God
[1:18:13] two kingdoms were represented in that
[1:18:17] ship
[1:18:18] the kingdom of God and the kingdom of
[1:18:21] the devil
[1:18:22] there are just two kingdoms
[1:18:25] he had a kingdom of Satan the kingdom of
[1:18:27] the prince of this world
[1:18:29] and then he had the kingdom of God
[1:18:33] you are working for one of those two
[1:18:36] kingdoms
[1:18:37] consciously unconsciously whatever we do
[1:18:41] in life you are doing for one or two or
[1:18:43] two kingdoms
[1:18:44] I will must remember that we as Sons and
[1:18:49] Daughters of God and God put us here to
[1:18:52] work for his kingdom no matter what
[1:18:55] comes
[1:18:57] amen
[1:18:59] and the kingdom will work for influences
[1:19:02] Us in all that we do
[1:19:04] now if you read this scripture carefully
[1:19:07] for the beginning of chapter 27
[1:19:10] but Paul
[1:19:12] won them
[1:19:14] that look this journey is not going to
[1:19:16] be saved
[1:19:17] let us stop here
[1:19:19] but the people he was a prisoner I hope
[1:19:23] you remember that
[1:19:24] he was a prisoner and he appealed his
[1:19:28] case to to Caesar they were taking it to
[1:19:31] Rome
[1:19:32] but the journey between where he was at
[1:19:35] room
[1:19:37] was
[1:19:38] very rough
[1:19:41] they almost lost everything
[1:19:44] for lack of knowledge
[1:19:47] they almost perish
[1:19:49] for lack of knowledge
[1:19:51] what was the knowledge report to them
[1:19:54] you will have listened to me
[1:19:57] but Paul because it came from his part
[1:20:02] of that Kingdom the kingdom of God look
[1:20:05] in the kingdom of God if a member of
[1:20:08] that Kingdom you have certain privileges
[1:20:12] you have access to the almighty God
[1:20:16] we don't have all that is all that is
[1:20:19] God in us
[1:20:20] but the little
[1:20:22] portion of God we have in US
[1:20:25] is directly connected to all of God
[1:20:30] in other words at any point in time that
[1:20:34] we have a need that little portion will
[1:20:36] have in us we connect to God and provide
[1:20:40] that need
[1:20:43] being part of that Kingdom warned them
[1:20:46] that we should not proceed
[1:20:48] but they did not listen to him because
[1:20:50] uh he was a prisoner I mean they saw him
[1:20:54] they looked at him as an ordinary man
[1:20:55] say this guy and also they were deceived
[1:20:58] if he followed the reading if you look
[1:21:00] at the reading they were deceived if you
[1:21:02] look at um verse 13 He said I went the
[1:21:06] sad wind blew Softly
[1:21:09] supposing that they had obtained their
[1:21:12] purpose losing theirs they sailed close
[1:21:15] to Great you know that was the software
[1:21:18] that came they said oh the weather is
[1:21:20] okay they don't mind this man you know
[1:21:21] he's a fanatic that's what she's talking
[1:21:23] about
[1:21:24] but I learned the line
[1:21:27] the problem came
[1:21:28] it is not the beginning it is the end
[1:21:32] that matters sometimes the beginning can
[1:21:35] be deceitful in everything it could be
[1:21:37] rough and you want to quit
[1:21:39] you know many people some people have
[1:21:42] left this message
[1:21:44] I'm sure we all know that even they took
[1:21:47] it to a point they said to speak a bad
[1:21:49] thing they don't know about
[1:21:51] you know the reason why they are leaving
[1:21:54] the message is because
[1:21:56] they don't have what it takes to live
[1:22:01] for the message
[1:22:02] and they want the privileges in the
[1:22:04] message
[1:22:06] they read through the sermon books and
[1:22:08] see the signs and wonders that God did
[1:22:10] through a servant
[1:22:12] and they want to put into practice but
[1:22:15] it's not working it's all this thing is
[1:22:17] all working we are just wasting our time
[1:22:19] but they don't live the life of the
[1:22:21] message
[1:22:22] [Music]
[1:22:24] they want to get the benefit of the
[1:22:27] message without living the life of the
[1:22:29] message it's not possible you cannot
[1:22:32] separate the two
[1:22:35] brother Paul
[1:22:38] he was able to have that privilege
[1:22:40] because
[1:22:41] something happened to him
[1:22:43] I think it's better we're talking about
[1:22:45] that
[1:22:46] it was not always like that that was a
[1:22:48] time but Paul persecuted that way
[1:22:53] if we truly it's a book of Acts chapter
[1:22:55] 9 I believe
[1:22:57] sorry I
[1:22:59] I like to read scripture just bear with
[1:23:01] me it's just I I think the word of God
[1:23:05] will start my own words we failed but
[1:23:08] the word of God will never fail
[1:23:12] because there's a secret behind uh
[1:23:15] Rapport that's a secret what happened to
[1:23:18] him
[1:23:22] oh it's going to be a Landing reading
[1:23:23] let me just read it I'll be fast if I
[1:23:25] can and that verse chapter 9 from verse
[1:23:28] 1 and Paul
[1:23:30] yet breathing abstractness
[1:23:34] and Slaughter against the Disciples of
[1:23:37] the Lord went onto the high priest and
[1:23:40] inside of him led us to Damascus
[1:23:44] to the synagogues that if he found any
[1:23:47] or this way whether they were men or
[1:23:50] women he might bring them back unto
[1:23:53] Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came
[1:23:57] near the Damascus and suddenly they are
[1:24:00] shared around about him a light from
[1:24:02] heaven and he fell to the Earth
[1:24:05] and had a voice saying unto him so so
[1:24:08] why pass scooted out me
[1:24:12] and he said who are thou Lord
[1:24:17] and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou
[1:24:20] persecuted
[1:24:22] it is hard for you to kick against the
[1:24:24] prick
[1:24:25] and as he trembled and astonished said
[1:24:28] Lord what would thou have me to do
[1:24:32] and the Lord said unto him arise and go
[1:24:35] into the City and he shall be told thee
[1:24:38] what thou must do
[1:24:40] and the man will join it with him stood
[1:24:43] speechless
[1:24:45] he had a voice was seen no man
[1:24:48] and saw a rose
[1:24:50] from the earth and where his eyes were
[1:24:53] opened he saw no man but that but they
[1:24:56] led him by the hand and brought him
[1:24:59] into the Damascus
[1:25:01] and it was three days without sight and
[1:25:05] neither did eat nor drink and there was
[1:25:09] a certain disciple at Damascus named
[1:25:12] ananias
[1:25:14] and to him said the Lord in a vision
[1:25:17] ananias and he said behold I am here
[1:25:21] Lord
[1:25:22] and the Lord said unto him arise and go
[1:25:25] into the street which is called straight
[1:25:28] inquire in the house of Judas for one
[1:25:32] called Saul of tacos for behold he
[1:25:36] prayed
[1:25:36] and has seen in a vision a man named
[1:25:40] ananias coming in and putting his hand
[1:25:43] on him that he might receive his sight
[1:25:45] then the last answer Lord I have heard
[1:25:49] by many of this man how much evil he had
[1:25:52] done to thy sins at Jerusalem
[1:25:56] um here
[1:25:58] he had Authority from the chief priests
[1:26:01] to bind all that called on thy name but
[1:26:05] they lost it unto him go thy way for he
[1:26:08] is a choosing vessel
[1:26:10] unto me to Bear my name before the
[1:26:14] Gentiles
[1:26:15] and kings
[1:26:17] are the children of Israel for I will
[1:26:21] show him how great things he must suffer
[1:26:25] for my namesake
[1:26:26] and ananias went his way and entered
[1:26:30] into the house and put his hand on him
[1:26:33] said Brother song can you imagine that
[1:26:37] brought us all the Lord even Jesus that
[1:26:40] appeared unto thee in the way as thou
[1:26:43] cometh has sent me that thou might
[1:26:46] receive that sight and be filled
[1:26:50] with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:52] and immediately there fell from his eyes
[1:26:56] as there being skills
[1:26:58] I received
[1:27:01] fat forfeit and a rose I was baptized
[1:27:05] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:27:08] that was where the change started
[1:27:11] but of course something happened to him
[1:27:15] he was conver it was filled with the
[1:27:18] Holy Ghost
[1:27:19] and that brought a transformation
[1:27:23] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:27:25] the Holy Ghost put him into the kingdom
[1:27:28] of God
[1:27:30] he sees from being in the Kingdom of
[1:27:33] Satan he was transformed
[1:27:36] to be in the kingdom of God and because
[1:27:39] he's in that Kingdom he had the
[1:27:41] Privileges that followed those that are
[1:27:44] in the kingdom of God blessed be the
[1:27:47] name of the Lord many times we'll read
[1:27:50] the Bible we read the messages we say
[1:27:53] Great and Mighty promises that God has
[1:27:57] promised his children but sometimes we
[1:27:59] struggle with those sins the secret is
[1:28:03] that you must be in the Kingdom before
[1:28:06] you can have access to the Privileges
[1:28:09] and that is the conversion of our souls
[1:28:13] blessed be the name of the Lord and the
[1:28:16] Lord said unless
[1:28:19] you are born again
[1:28:23] unless you are born again
[1:28:26] they were born into the kingdom
[1:28:30] amen
[1:28:32] not joining the kingdom
[1:28:35] here I am I'm in Canada
[1:28:38] you know
[1:28:39] I wasn't born in Canada
[1:28:42] I just came to Canada
[1:28:44] so by coming here don't make me a
[1:28:46] Canadian
[1:28:47] I'm in Nigerian
[1:28:50] I want Nigerian passport
[1:28:52] you Canadians you have some privileges
[1:28:55] that I don't have
[1:28:58] not because I'm a bad person no simply
[1:29:02] because I was not born here
[1:29:04] it's all right so also is the kingdom of
[1:29:07] God
[1:29:08] we can talk about it
[1:29:11] we can think about it
[1:29:14] unless you are born into it
[1:29:17] the Privileges that follow believer will
[1:29:20] not follow you
[1:29:21] and it brings frustrations
[1:29:29] it brings frustrations along the way
[1:29:32] you will not be able to stand
[1:29:36] sometimes to read the Bible be difficult
[1:29:38] for you
[1:29:40] so I'm trying to come to church well let
[1:29:42] me go
[1:29:46] it's not supposed to be so
[1:29:49] and that is why
[1:29:52] there must be a definite change
[1:29:54] amen
[1:29:56] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:29:58] that was why the prophet came
[1:30:01] to introduce Christ to us
[1:30:04] to take us from our denominations
[1:30:07] our Chris our dogmas and bring us into
[1:30:11] the body of Christ
[1:30:14] that was the peace
[1:30:16] that Paul had
[1:30:19] although in the midst of trouble
[1:30:23] he had peace
[1:30:25] because he had the Prince of Peace
[1:30:29] the Holy Ghost brings peace
[1:30:33] it stabilizes Us in the times of trouble
[1:30:38] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:30:40] but Paul has so much peace in him
[1:30:43] that he could even give it to those
[1:30:46] around him blessed be the enemy of the
[1:30:48] Lord amen
[1:30:50] can read these creatures the angels I
[1:30:52] give them to you
[1:30:57] these people's lives I give them I give
[1:30:59] their life to you
[1:31:01] their lives were in the handsome brother
[1:31:03] Paul
[1:31:06] and the Apostle gave you a good chair
[1:31:09] amen and he just spoke to me
[1:31:12] and I believe God
[1:31:15] that it shall be even as he has said
[1:31:19] they have time to listen to him
[1:31:22] remember they did not listen to him
[1:31:24] before
[1:31:26] now they have time to listen to him
[1:31:29] it wasn't an easy thing
[1:31:32] no sun no stars
[1:31:34] for 14 days
[1:31:38] the ship was they were not in control of
[1:31:41] the ship anymore
[1:31:43] you are not in control that's why they
[1:31:45] could not eat
[1:31:48] for 14 days
[1:31:49] they have saved from food
[1:31:51] waiting for death
[1:31:53] and that is where this world we live in
[1:31:55] is this was the way it's going it is it
[1:31:59] seemed that is act of control
[1:32:02] people don't think rightly anymore
[1:32:06] they have so much so-called freedom
[1:32:10] that can do almost anything they want to
[1:32:14] do and Satan because they are not in
[1:32:18] Christ Satan has seized that opportunity
[1:32:20] to enter into them and begin to suggest
[1:32:24] evil things to their heart and they call
[1:32:27] it Freedom there's no true Freedom
[1:32:29] outside of the word of God
[1:32:33] the only Freedom we have is to serve God
[1:32:36] according to his world
[1:32:39] and that is the true freedom is not to
[1:32:41] do anything we want to do
[1:32:44] in Canada you have a constitution
[1:32:47] you cannot go beyond your Constitution
[1:32:49] they will put into jail
[1:32:52] the word of God the Earth the world we
[1:32:55] live in there's a constitution and that
[1:32:57] Constitution is the Bible if you go
[1:33:00] against it it will be touching to hell
[1:33:04] because God will not be justified
[1:33:08] to create us to create human beings
[1:33:11] without giving them
[1:33:14] Constitution how to live on Earth
[1:33:20] and that is the scripture
[1:33:22] that is the Bible
[1:33:24] is the Constitution that we have we have
[1:33:27] to live by it blessed be the name of the
[1:33:30] Lord
[1:33:31] and when we live by it will become good
[1:33:34] citizens
[1:33:37] and if a good citizens we have the
[1:33:40] Privileges
[1:33:43] that follow good citizens
[1:33:46] that is why we are called Christians
[1:33:48] amen
[1:33:49] christ-like blessed be the name of the
[1:33:52] Lord therefore brother Paul derived his
[1:33:56] power from the infinite of the Holy
[1:34:00] Ghost
[1:34:01] and we must be filled with the Holy
[1:34:05] Ghost
[1:34:06] amen sometime when we talk about it some
[1:34:09] people feel somehow but that is
[1:34:13] fundamental Foundation of our faith
[1:34:16] is the holy ghost that is what brings us
[1:34:19] into the body of Christ who cannot over
[1:34:22] stress the importance of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:25] no
[1:34:27] the Bible says if we don't have the Holy
[1:34:29] Ghost you are none of his
[1:34:31] that's a very strong statement
[1:34:37] the evidence that your sins are forgiven
[1:34:40] you is the Holy Ghost
[1:34:43] when you are giving the Holy Ghost is a
[1:34:47] confirmation that God has accepted your
[1:34:49] faith
[1:34:51] amen
[1:34:54] and that was the first thing
[1:34:57] but that Peter preached on
[1:35:01] I know many of us have feel the Holy
[1:35:03] Ghost
[1:35:04] but maybe some are not fill the Holy
[1:35:06] Ghost
[1:35:09] I know most of our little ones they gave
[1:35:11] up touching water they've come to church
[1:35:16] but they need to exceed with the Holy
[1:35:18] Ghost
[1:35:19] coming to church
[1:35:22] doesn't mean that you're a Christian
[1:35:29] sometimes people say well I believe the
[1:35:31] message therefore I feel the Holy Ghost
[1:35:36] no around
[1:35:37] wrong some clear
[1:35:42] Ed and you cannot be filled with the
[1:35:44] Holy Ghost and live
[1:35:48] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:35:52] the Holy Ghost is a definite Act
[1:35:55] in the life of a man a woman
[1:36:00] it brings a change he said we baptize
[1:36:04] in water
[1:36:06] for the remission of your sins
[1:36:08] I receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:12] it must come to us we must we must ask
[1:36:17] God to fill us with the Holy Ghost
[1:36:22] who must intentionally ask God to fill
[1:36:25] us with the Holy Ghost and when we ask
[1:36:27] who must believe that you have received
[1:36:31] because the verse said God is willing to
[1:36:34] fill us with the Holy Ghost more than we
[1:36:37] are
[1:36:38] Desiring to receive it what a great
[1:36:40] thing that's a wonderful statement so we
[1:36:43] must everything about Christianity is by
[1:36:46] faith
[1:36:48] we receive it
[1:36:50] God is not giving the Holy Ghost now we
[1:36:52] all know that they have been given over
[1:36:55] 2000 years ago now what you do is to
[1:36:58] receive it amen it's not difficult it's
[1:37:01] to receive it but why would you save it
[1:37:03] we believe when we pray we believe but
[1:37:06] we must see the action in our lives our
[1:37:09] lives will begin to change
[1:37:11] you know the all things will pass away
[1:37:14] and All Things become new
[1:37:17] you become a better brother a better
[1:37:21] sister a better husband a better wife
[1:37:25] that will be a definite change in our
[1:37:28] lives and you will be the first one to
[1:37:30] know that you have changed and that
[1:37:33] those around you we know that this guy
[1:37:35] is no longer the same something that
[1:37:38] happened to him blessed be the name of
[1:37:40] the Lord amen amen
[1:37:45] that happened to Paul and he knew
[1:37:50] he knew that he was a child of God
[1:37:54] amen and we must know that we are we are
[1:37:58] Sons and Daughters of God we will be
[1:38:00] conscious of that
[1:38:02] whatever we do wherever we go we must
[1:38:05] know we are the sons and daughters of
[1:38:07] God blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[1:38:11] see if if we if we if we don't have that
[1:38:14] confidence
[1:38:15] you know that we are children of God
[1:38:18] then our coming to church even our
[1:38:20] existence will not be meaningful
[1:38:24] once had our confidence in us we must
[1:38:27] believe
[1:38:27] that we are children of God
[1:38:30] and why are you a children of God you
[1:38:32] belong to the kingdom of God Amen and
[1:38:36] then those privileges in the scriptures
[1:38:38] the promises and what have you then they
[1:38:41] belong to us
[1:38:43] we have access unto them
[1:38:46] because these are the things that God
[1:38:48] has freely given to us
[1:38:51] because we are his sons and daughters
[1:38:54] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[1:38:57] sometimes we live and underprivileged
[1:39:00] life because of the lack of knowledge I
[1:39:04] said we I'm part of you
[1:39:08] are not just talking to you also talking
[1:39:10] to myself
[1:39:11] sometimes we live under privileged lives
[1:39:16] physically and spiritually
[1:39:19] because we are not conscious
[1:39:22] of who God has made us what God has made
[1:39:26] us to be
[1:39:29] amen
[1:39:31] we are not like other human beings
[1:39:36] that is the truth
[1:39:40] that is why we cannot compare ourselves
[1:39:42] with others you cannot compare yourself
[1:39:43] to a neighbor
[1:39:46] we don't live under the the the the the
[1:39:49] budget of Canada
[1:39:52] or the economy of this world
[1:39:58] do you know that
[1:40:00] because we belong to another kingdom
[1:40:06] we belong to a separate Kingdom this
[1:40:09] Kingdom of the Earth this world is of
[1:40:12] Satan
[1:40:14] we cannot live
[1:40:15] by that
[1:40:17] will be disappointed
[1:40:20] we live
[1:40:23] by the word of God by what God says
[1:40:27] about the time we are living in that is
[1:40:30] what is important to us is not what the
[1:40:34] the prime minister or the governor
[1:40:36] anybody says is What God Says
[1:40:39] what God's God's mind about this time
[1:40:44] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:40:48] amen
[1:40:49] amen
[1:40:53] when we
[1:40:54] live by diet
[1:40:56] when you are members we use our thinking
[1:41:01] our heart will be filled
[1:41:04] with the word of God
[1:41:06] who think about it we dream about it we
[1:41:10] live in it and it works in our lives it
[1:41:14] most are the most us day by day who
[1:41:18] become more like him
[1:41:20] blessed be the name of the Lord the
[1:41:23] Bible said the kingdom of God is within
[1:41:26] us
[1:41:27] amen the kingdom of God is the will of
[1:41:32] God
[1:41:34] is that correct yeah is the will of God
[1:41:38] let that will be done as it is in heaven
[1:41:42] the kingdom of God is the will of God
[1:41:45] therefore we members of this Kingdom
[1:41:49] will live
[1:41:50] to do the will of God
[1:41:54] bless me the name of the Lord and that's
[1:41:56] what the Bible said me and you should
[1:41:59] seek fast
[1:42:00] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:42:05] then all other things whatever it is
[1:42:07] will be added unto us
[1:42:11] amen
[1:42:12] wow that is a great statement
[1:42:15] I think we should dwell on that a little
[1:42:17] bit
[1:42:21] how do we see the kingdom of God
[1:42:27] do we stop walking
[1:42:29] and go to the mountain somewhere
[1:42:32] be fasting and praying read the Bible
[1:42:35] you know sleep and wake up seeking for
[1:42:38] the kingdom of God
[1:42:41] no
[1:42:44] no
[1:42:46] as a matter of fact we are seeking for
[1:42:49] the kingdom of God that is why we are
[1:42:51] seated here this morning
[1:42:53] amen we must seek
[1:42:56] for the will of God to be done in
[1:42:59] everything we do
[1:43:01] God has a kingdom
[1:43:04] and we are his children let's go back to
[1:43:07] the Bible if you look at Genesis
[1:43:10] 1 I think 28 they are God's commission
[1:43:14] Adam
[1:43:16] to replenish the Earth
[1:43:19] he said be fruitful
[1:43:23] is that correct let's read it I think I
[1:43:26] thought
[1:43:31] and God bless them and said unto them be
[1:43:34] fruitful and multiply okay
[1:43:38] be fruitful
[1:43:40] multiply
[1:43:43] replenish the Earth
[1:43:45] and subdue it
[1:43:48] amen
[1:43:51] we are supposed to subdue the ACT
[1:43:57] subdue minister to conquer
[1:44:02] I have control over
[1:44:07] well he will tell me that where that was
[1:44:11] then
[1:44:13] it cannot be done now
[1:44:17] but brothers and sisters
[1:44:20] that is our mission
[1:44:22] that is what we must do between this
[1:44:24] space from between us and Glory we must
[1:44:28] submit the Africa they are where we live
[1:44:30] in
[1:44:31] God has given us the authority to subdue
[1:44:35] the Earth
[1:44:37] and every man every woman on Earth are
[1:44:40] going to read from the prophet
[1:44:43] because we are we are created of God
[1:44:46] look at what is happening look at that
[1:44:48] electricity
[1:44:51] look at people going even they want to
[1:44:53] subdue the space
[1:44:58] or we as Christians we expected to
[1:45:01] survive the Earth
[1:45:03] your Earth is your own little space
[1:45:08] if you're a carpenter it will subdue
[1:45:11] that little space it must be the best
[1:45:13] Carpenter
[1:45:16] because we are working for the kingdom
[1:45:18] of God
[1:45:22] and we depend on God
[1:45:24] as I used to tell people if you are the
[1:45:27] best capital in town
[1:45:29] I do the best job
[1:45:31] at a very good price
[1:45:34] people will come to you
[1:45:38] is that correct
[1:45:40] people will come to you Christian the
[1:45:43] Bible said we should not he said we
[1:45:44] should we should seek to do the will of
[1:45:48] God then these things will be added to
[1:45:50] us
[1:45:51] when we do the will of God money will
[1:45:54] come to us
[1:45:57] whether it's house life whatever is
[1:45:59] money is that correct money will come to
[1:46:01] us when we do the will of God but
[1:46:04] sometimes we don't do the will of God
[1:46:07] we cannot walk like unbelievers
[1:46:11] who cannot live like unbelievers
[1:46:14] we are believers starting from our own
[1:46:16] our our own life our personal life
[1:46:21] must bring our body our everything under
[1:46:25] the subject under the subjection of the
[1:46:27] word of God
[1:46:28] even the way we sleep
[1:46:31] it's true
[1:46:32] because we are we are Christian Soldiers
[1:46:35] you know we need to talk about these
[1:46:37] things it may look Elementary but these
[1:46:40] are the things that affect us
[1:46:43] the way we live
[1:46:45] it doesn't mean that if we don't do this
[1:46:49] thing will not will not go to heaven no
[1:46:53] let me read the scripture to you uh
[1:46:56] Corinthians chapter 3. maybe that that
[1:46:59] will help us understand what I'm trying
[1:47:01] to say First Corinthians chapter 3
[1:47:13] foreign
[1:47:20] [Music]
[1:47:22] according to the grace of God which is
[1:47:24] given unto me as a wise master builder I
[1:47:28] have led the foundation and another
[1:47:30] buildered their own but let every man
[1:47:33] take him how he builded there upon
[1:47:37] the prophet has brought a message to us
[1:47:42] we have the message now we are the
[1:47:45] people who told manifest the message
[1:47:48] we have to walk on this way alone
[1:47:52] it is you and God
[1:47:54] we have to manifest it
[1:47:57] for other Foundation can no man lay it
[1:48:01] and that is there which is Christ now if
[1:48:03] any man
[1:48:04] build upon this Foundation gold silver
[1:48:07] precious stones wood hairs trouble Every
[1:48:10] Man's work shall be made manifest for
[1:48:14] the day shall declare it because it
[1:48:17] shall be revealed by fire and the fire
[1:48:19] shall try every man's work or what such
[1:48:22] it is if any man's work abide which he
[1:48:27] has beat there upon he shall receive a
[1:48:30] reward
[1:48:32] is that correct are you following me
[1:48:34] if you do the will of God you will
[1:48:37] receive a reward
[1:48:39] okay
[1:48:41] if animals walk shall be burned it shall
[1:48:44] suffer loss
[1:48:46] but he himself shall be saved yes sir as
[1:48:50] by fire
[1:48:51] your soul will be saved but you have no
[1:48:54] reward
[1:48:55] because you have not obeyed this world
[1:49:00] you have not
[1:49:02] manifested the word of God for your age
[1:49:06] you have not lived by those things you
[1:49:09] have been taught those things we have
[1:49:11] read in the Bible in the message we have
[1:49:14] not lived by them who have not lived
[1:49:16] according to the will of God because we
[1:49:20] live for the fortrans of the kingdom of
[1:49:23] God
[1:49:24] blessed be the name of the Lord remember
[1:49:27] those three people that were given
[1:49:29] talents
[1:49:30] one was given five talents and he
[1:49:34] produce another five
[1:49:36] is that correct that is 100 gain another
[1:49:40] was given to and he produced another two
[1:49:44] that is also 100 gain that guy was given
[1:49:49] one and he produced zero
[1:49:53] it doesn't mean that he will go to hell
[1:49:56] are you following me but there'll be no
[1:49:59] Rewards
[1:50:01] he has not put into use the talent that
[1:50:05] was given to him
[1:50:07] in the body of Christ
[1:50:10] every member of that body is important
[1:50:14] you have a role to play
[1:50:17] amen and we should never ignore that
[1:50:20] that is why we are here
[1:50:26] I asked somebody that I said how many uh
[1:50:29] how many
[1:50:30] people will go in Rapture in Calgary
[1:50:33] do you have an idea
[1:50:38] only God knows
[1:50:40] what we can guess
[1:50:42] we can guess
[1:50:44] I'm guessing
[1:50:46] if I say 500 would that be a good number
[1:50:51] so we say ah that is too high you cannot
[1:50:53] get 500.
[1:50:54] out of me but I don't know what is the
[1:50:56] population of Calgary
[1:50:58] it'll be one million
[1:51:01] I don't know
[1:51:02] now let's do 500. okay
[1:51:07] I have one million people
[1:51:09] so here in Calgary
[1:51:12] we have 500
[1:51:15] representatives of God 500 people
[1:51:18] standing for God
[1:51:20] and those one million they are depending
[1:51:22] on you
[1:51:24] whether you agree with me or not
[1:51:27] but that is the way God sees us
[1:51:31] they're looking up to you
[1:51:33] and God is saying ye are my Witnesses
[1:51:41] so if we are in that Kingdom we must
[1:51:44] walk for that Kingdom
[1:51:46] it affects all that we are
[1:51:49] from The Young
[1:51:51] to the old
[1:51:53] The Young Ones
[1:51:55] they must live by the word of God
[1:51:58] the word of God must obey your parents
[1:52:00] in the Lord
[1:52:02] I know it's all fashioned
[1:52:05] but the word of God is not all fashioned
[1:52:07] is never out of fashion
[1:52:10] you must obey your parents
[1:52:12] listen to them
[1:52:15] if you have anything to say talk to them
[1:52:18] with all respects and if they say no
[1:52:21] they'll follow them if they are wrong
[1:52:23] God will hold it as possible
[1:52:25] but you must first of all to obey your
[1:52:27] parents
[1:52:29] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:52:32] amen
[1:52:35] the wife will be subject with your
[1:52:37] husband I don't care what anybody says
[1:52:40] that is what the word of God says
[1:52:42] and the husband must love the wife as
[1:52:44] his own body amen
[1:52:48] if you follow the law of God who will
[1:52:51] reap the fruit yeah while we are here if
[1:52:55] the wife is subject to the husband and
[1:52:58] the husband loves the wife and his own
[1:53:00] body you have heaven in the home
[1:53:03] and the children they asserted their
[1:53:05] parents and the parents brings up their
[1:53:08] children according to the word of God
[1:53:10] you have Heaven on Earth
[1:53:14] we have problem because we don't obey
[1:53:16] the word of God
[1:53:19] amen
[1:53:21] you can you can read books have to make
[1:53:23] marriage work even the author is the
[1:53:26] divorcee to start with so so what do you
[1:53:29] want to get from so it doesn't the word
[1:53:31] of God look look look
[1:53:34] the word of God
[1:53:36] has power in itself to reproduce himself
[1:53:39] again
[1:53:40] I can give you an example
[1:53:43] look at Noah
[1:53:45] go to Noah
[1:53:47] Noah
[1:53:49] I'm going to bring water upon the face
[1:53:52] of the Earth
[1:53:53] the water will be so much that because
[1:53:55] flood and the flood with someone that
[1:53:57] will wipe off every living thing but you
[1:54:01] have to build an ark
[1:54:03] this Dimension this Dimension this
[1:54:06] Dimension listen to me Brethren Noah had
[1:54:10] the word of God
[1:54:13] the word of God worked in him
[1:54:16] comparative
[1:54:19] to be the ark
[1:54:21] the ark is the manifestation or the word
[1:54:24] of God to Noah
[1:54:28] is that correct
[1:54:30] when you believe the word of God
[1:54:33] we have to manifest it
[1:54:39] we have to bring it to pass
[1:54:44] do you think no one knew how
[1:54:47] it will build the ark he didn't know
[1:54:49] what he started from somewhere God said
[1:54:52] I should build the ark should get gopher
[1:54:54] wood then he got to go forward
[1:54:57] I don't know if he was a carpenter I
[1:55:00] don't know maybe he was a farmer
[1:55:02] because that was a common trait among
[1:55:05] the Believers then
[1:55:09] but
[1:55:10] because God said build the ark God must
[1:55:14] show him how to build the ark
[1:55:21] you preach
[1:55:26] God
[1:55:27] more sure you have to preach
[1:55:30] yeah this morning
[1:55:33] and depending on God
[1:55:35] it's not very easy to be here
[1:55:37] don't think it is easy
[1:55:40] I have to give myself to God
[1:55:42] if he has called me to preach then he
[1:55:45] will speak through me
[1:55:46] he will be the one doing the preaching
[1:55:49] so when we believe the word of God and
[1:55:52] accept it
[1:55:54] without any doubts and if the design
[1:55:58] that I know I believe the word of God is
[1:56:01] that he went to the bush to cut wood to
[1:56:03] build to cut off our wood to be that to
[1:56:05] be the ark that is the sign
[1:56:08] no I could repeat it over and over oh oh
[1:56:11] I bet God is how should be the ark I
[1:56:14] should be the ark that's just
[1:56:15] storytelling go and build Ark if you
[1:56:19] believe
[1:56:21] and he built the ark
[1:56:24] and the Ark saved himself and his family
[1:56:28] why because you obeyed the word of God
[1:56:30] when we receive the word of God
[1:56:32] sometimes it'll be difficult I wish you
[1:56:35] I will read it we are going to read it
[1:56:37] from the psalm for his own book
[1:56:38] sometimes will be difficult the reason
[1:56:40] is that our sisters have been clogged up
[1:56:43] by the things of the world
[1:56:46] and that's very difficult for us to even
[1:56:49] believe God
[1:56:51] and sometimes when when certain things
[1:56:53] happened
[1:56:55] as long as a testimony he said can it be
[1:56:57] so that the pastor gave a testimony
[1:56:59] about his dog do you believe it
[1:57:05] do you believe God can still work today
[1:57:09] maybe I should give you one testimony
[1:57:14] if you don't believe the pastor
[1:57:15] testimony surely will not believe my
[1:57:17] testimony
[1:57:20] we had a brother in our church we went
[1:57:22] for we went for an event and we have a
[1:57:25] voice of God building in Lagos all the
[1:57:28] churches in Nigeria came together built
[1:57:31] a very very nice
[1:57:32] uh building there we have
[1:57:36] all the materials from the voice of God
[1:57:38] so we went there for an event I
[1:57:40] forgotten what you went for actually
[1:57:43] um and just to call the story short one
[1:57:46] of the brothers the boss you are
[1:57:48] traveling with had a problem they packed
[1:57:50] by the roadside they were trying to fix
[1:57:52] it by the roadside a truck came you know
[1:57:55] this 30-ton truck that carries Granite
[1:57:59] is that what you call that stool
[1:58:02] and ran over him
[1:58:05] turkey tones
[1:58:07] and threw him to the bush
[1:58:10] and
[1:58:12] of course he was dead
[1:58:16] I was in my own private car I wasn't in
[1:58:19] the bus they call me that's what happens
[1:58:21] they pass a puzzle conquer you know
[1:58:22] everything is come
[1:58:26] this has happened
[1:58:28] well I told the brother my going there
[1:58:30] will not
[1:58:31] my Rashida will not make a difference
[1:58:33] let us pray right from here so by the
[1:58:36] head we prayed and then I drove to the
[1:58:38] place when I got I took him to the
[1:58:39] hospital and when I got there I called
[1:58:43] his name he opened his eyes
[1:58:46] and I pray for him again
[1:58:48] even me
[1:58:52] I was surprised amen I was pitching
[1:58:55] myself
[1:58:57] because it became difficult for me to
[1:59:00] believe
[1:59:04] and we took India from there to and to
[1:59:07] especially hospital for a proper express
[1:59:11] car when they did that I said please do
[1:59:13] this candle they bring everything and
[1:59:15] there's nothing as I called the doctor a
[1:59:18] brother doctor said look this guy
[1:59:21] 30 ton trailer ran over him he said
[1:59:24] there's nothing
[1:59:34] all the bones everything perfectly fixed
[1:59:38] up
[1:59:40] I was lucky
[1:59:43] the brother is alive today
[1:59:47] what am I trying to say
[1:59:51] I said I pitted myself because uh if I
[1:59:54] truly believed
[1:59:55] I would have told him to go home there's
[1:59:57] no need to go to the hospital
[1:59:59] you know because of unbelief
[2:00:02] but he wants me to go and check and
[2:00:04] check again and check again you know but
[2:00:08] we we the prophet said because of the
[2:00:12] situation we find ourselves on half
[2:00:15] today our system that channel between us
[2:00:18] and God has been locked up
[2:00:22] to the point that we have forgotten what
[2:00:25] we used to be
[2:00:30] but Jesus Christ came to bring us back
[2:00:34] to what we used to be to clean off to
[2:00:38] clear the system
[2:00:39] so we can believe and Brethren this is
[2:00:42] the only life we have on Earth for now
[2:00:45] we must live this life to its fullness
[2:00:48] and that is during the will of God
[2:00:51] whatever
[2:00:52] we find our hands doing we must do with
[2:00:56] all our might with all our heart and the
[2:00:59] prophet told us that if I Carpenter it
[2:01:02] will be the best if you're a farmer you
[2:01:04] must be the best if you cannot produce
[2:01:07] the best don't do it
[2:01:09] because we are created to subdue the
[2:01:12] Earth around us we must subdue our space
[2:01:15] whatever we are called to to do we must
[2:01:18] be the best in it
[2:01:27] that is what God expect from us
[2:01:32] we don't you know Christians don't run
[2:01:34] after money
[2:01:36] we don't run after money no no no no no
[2:01:38] no
[2:01:39] money comes to us
[2:01:43] because we work for the kingdom
[2:01:46] whatever you are doing
[2:01:49] please listen to me
[2:01:51] are key to our existence on Earth
[2:01:55] because we
[2:01:57] we are
[2:01:59] in a battle we're in a battle as Satan
[2:02:02] is is is is a very Wicked guy
[2:02:06] he watches
[2:02:10] and his accuser or the brethren
[2:02:13] whatever we're off the line we accuse us
[2:02:16] hey but he cannot do this
[2:02:18] and the Bible studies while some are
[2:02:20] sick
[2:02:21] some are are weak some even die
[2:02:25] because they failed to desire the body
[2:02:28] of Christ
[2:02:30] the body of Christ is the kingdom of God
[2:02:34] where members of that Kingdom
[2:02:37] we must have the right examine for that
[2:02:40] membership
[2:02:42] amen who must conduct ourselves in that
[2:02:46] way
[2:02:48] and that is the only way God can walk
[2:02:50] through us
[2:02:53] we we all need God
[2:02:58] we need God brethren
[2:03:00] and let me tell you it says become more
[2:03:03] difficult
[2:03:04] if you get to a point that only the just
[2:03:06] only the deposit the joy shall live by
[2:03:09] faith is only those that are living by
[2:03:12] faith can be successful
[2:03:15] amen
[2:03:18] to live at what God says no matter what
[2:03:21] any man or any woman says
[2:03:24] books
[2:03:28] as somebody said he said
[2:03:31] um
[2:03:31] say we cannot we can we can we can
[2:03:34] repeat
[2:03:35] we can repeat this but we cannot say it
[2:03:41] you know how we should be able to say it
[2:03:43] you know what I mean maybe you don't
[2:03:45] understand what I'm trying to say I
[2:03:46] carry these scriptures and say well uh
[2:03:49] whether Paul I mean brother Peter and
[2:03:52] brother John they were they were the
[2:03:54] gate called beautiful and they told the
[2:03:58] you know to rise up and walk is
[2:04:01] that correct
[2:04:04] they told it they said rise up our work
[2:04:08] I can repeat that
[2:04:09] but can I say it
[2:04:16] can I say it
[2:04:18] huh
[2:04:20] can I say it can you say it
[2:04:24] is a different ball game
[2:04:27] to say it rise up and walk
[2:04:31] and we can repeat it
[2:04:34] but we are not supposed to be repeaters
[2:04:41] well I don't think we are created to be
[2:04:43] repeated we are created to see it
[2:04:47] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:04:50] we must we must think about those days
[2:04:53] we should never limit ourselves
[2:04:56] brethren we should not limit ourselves
[2:04:58] you are is you are more than a super
[2:05:00] human being
[2:05:03] it's not because of your righteousness
[2:05:05] it's not because of anything we have
[2:05:07] done but if you cause Jesus Christ came
[2:05:11] to make a way for us
[2:05:12] Bless That Be The Name Of The Lord
[2:05:16] and he has made a way for us already
[2:05:18] he's not making it he has made it
[2:05:21] already amen
[2:05:23] amen the Holy Ghost will give you to us
[2:05:26] to Quicken the word of God in us in
[2:05:30] order to reproduce it
[2:05:34] is not just to say it I mean it's not
[2:05:36] just to repeat it
[2:05:38] but to bring it to pass
[2:05:42] and that's the time we are living in we
[2:05:45] are expecting the second coming of the
[2:05:46] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:05:48] now we are received the full word of God
[2:05:51] for our age therefore we must manifest
[2:05:53] the full word of God not half of the
[2:05:56] world but the full word of God we must
[2:05:58] manifest blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:06:00] amen
[2:06:03] and that is why whatever we do
[2:06:06] whatever we claim to be
[2:06:09] we might be conscious of that that
[2:06:11] should drive us that I'm representing a
[2:06:14] kingdom
[2:06:16] amen
[2:06:18] today you have problems everywhere you
[2:06:21] know in in countries like India that
[2:06:25] they understand they are they are
[2:06:26] burning churches and what have you
[2:06:28] people suffers persecutions
[2:06:31] because of Christ
[2:06:34] in India you have many religions have
[2:06:37] Muslim mother why Christian
[2:06:39] the same thing in Nigeria
[2:06:41] the kid pastors they burn their churches
[2:06:44] they bought Christians just because
[2:06:46] you're a Christian why Christianity that
[2:06:49] will be something about Christianity
[2:06:51] that Satan hates
[2:06:58] you know I used to tell my people look
[2:07:00] look at the look at look at uh
[2:07:04] uh some Christian preachers and pastors
[2:07:07] so they have a lot of money so have
[2:07:10] private jet in Nigeria
[2:07:13] some of them I think one of the biggest
[2:07:15] church in the world is in Nigeria very
[2:07:17] religious accommodate
[2:07:19] 100 000 people
[2:07:21] yeah
[2:07:22] they have private yes some one two three
[2:07:25] private jets preachers
[2:07:28] you can't find people of other religion
[2:07:31] to do that
[2:07:33] cannot find a Muslim Imam with private
[2:07:36] jets
[2:07:37] a Hindu priest with a private jets
[2:07:40] why
[2:07:42] is because Christ
[2:07:47] Christ is marketable
[2:07:53] that is the reason
[2:07:56] but they will pay for it because it was
[2:07:58] not given for that
[2:08:00] but they are using it for that they will
[2:08:01] pay for that
[2:08:03] so watch I want to try to say that what
[2:08:06] you have
[2:08:07] is marketable
[2:08:09] is a good product
[2:08:16] you can afford to sell other things and
[2:08:19] buy it
[2:08:20] it will never offend you hey man
[2:08:24] is a good product it's a pearl
[2:08:28] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:08:33] and we are the Believers at this end of
[2:08:35] time what a privilege
[2:08:41] we should be happy

[2:08:56] amen because God has given unto us what
[2:09:01] it takes to do it well and because we
[2:09:04] are living for the kingdom we must
[2:09:07] gladly do it blessed with the name of
[2:09:09] the Lord amen because God has given us
[2:09:12] the Commandment if God says do this then
[2:09:16] he has already deposited in you what it
[2:09:20] takes to do it all you need to do is to

[2:12:54] Fellowship play please please all right
[2:12:57] all right right please has already
[2:12:59] helped me I I I want to I want to read
[2:13:02] from the prophet
[2:13:04] and that is uh
[2:13:07] the
[2:13:08] fundamental foundation for faith
[2:13:12] if you can be projected okay all right
[2:13:15] okay let's leave it there let's start
[2:13:18] from ah so we're there
[2:13:22] then now God when he made man in the
[2:13:25] beginning
[2:13:27] that is
[2:13:28] okay it's not here
[2:13:31] now God listen please now God why he
[2:13:34] made mine in the beginning he made him
[2:13:37] Superior to anything on Earth
[2:13:41] he gave him the jurisdiction of
[2:13:44] everything on Earth
[2:13:46] to control everything
[2:13:49] you see I was not speaking my words I
[2:13:52] was
[2:13:53] saying what the prophet said he
[2:13:55] controlled the animal life he control
[2:13:59] the foul life the fishes of the sea he
[2:14:03] controlled the winds
[2:14:06] he controlled the plant life
[2:14:09] he controlled everything
[2:14:12] now to us
[2:14:15] as human
[2:14:17] we may find difficult to comprehend
[2:14:20] but
[2:14:22] God sent the prophet
[2:14:25] to show to prove to us
[2:14:28] at those things
[2:14:31] are true
[2:14:34] that's right he control the wind
[2:14:36] did he do that
[2:14:39] he did not say sorry the Lord
[2:14:42] wind he spoke to the wind
[2:14:48] he spoke life into existence
[2:14:52] said this this career should go from
[2:14:53] here to here to here and stay here
[2:14:55] and it happened do you believe it
[2:15:00] it's a little fishy I give you a life
[2:15:05] the finishes
[2:15:09] so
[2:15:10] those things can be done now
[2:15:14] in our own time
[2:15:16] I'm not saying we should go ahead
[2:15:18] whatever I say hey I created no no I
[2:15:20] mean you can't just say anything the
[2:15:23] problem you know just say anything he
[2:15:24] wanted to say
[2:15:27] he had a mind of Christ
[2:15:31] we should have the mind of Christ
[2:15:34] when we have the mind of Christ we will
[2:15:36] do the will of Christ it was the will of
[2:15:39] God for that little fish to have his
[2:15:41] life
[2:15:42] are you following me and then he used
[2:15:45] that body to bring it to pass
[2:15:48] if he's the will of God if today you get
[2:15:52] an inspiration to say this turn that in
[2:15:55] your mind don't say it is not possible
[2:15:58] God sent the prophet to us to assure all
[2:16:01] that those things are possible
[2:16:04] amen
[2:16:06] it's not only the word
[2:16:09] it's not only the world
[2:16:11] but also the action
[2:16:17] okay
[2:16:21] man was made
[2:16:24] as a secondary God on Earth
[2:16:27] it was given the power to control all
[2:16:30] things all elements of the earth that
[2:16:32] was man Adam was given this great power
[2:16:35] but when the power that he was given to
[2:16:39] make himself
[2:16:41] where
[2:16:43] to make himself is where he failed he
[2:16:46] fell
[2:16:47] and Adam could speak to the winds and it
[2:16:52] will stop he could speak to the trees
[2:16:54] and they will bear him he could speak to
[2:16:57] the wildlife he should obey him he could
[2:17:00] speak to the waters
[2:17:02] ever what it was everything obeyed him
[2:17:05] now that is the beginning of man
[2:17:10] that was the original intention
[2:17:15] that was why God created man
[2:17:19] before the fall
[2:17:22] that's what God gave him in power for uh
[2:17:25] power over everything on earth now
[2:17:28] through the fall he lost that power
[2:17:31] then he becomes unconscious
[2:17:35] of the fact after losing his
[2:17:39] relationship and friendship fellowship
[2:17:41] with the father
[2:17:45] those things either could not do them
[2:17:47] anymore
[2:17:49] because he lost his fellowship with God
[2:17:51] because sin came between man and God
[2:17:56] then he lost that and all of his great
[2:17:59] channels became clogged up
[2:18:02] he could not even imagine ever doing
[2:18:05] that
[2:18:08] their man began to run from lions
[2:18:12] you heard from snakes all those things
[2:18:15] run away from them you know who could
[2:18:17] not control them anymore
[2:18:20] because something happened in the Garden
[2:18:23] of Eden
[2:18:25] now what Adam was in God cry
[2:18:31] back to that
[2:18:33] [Applause]
[2:18:35] don't let it be too difficult for you to
[2:18:38] believe
[2:18:48] now a redeemer to redeem anything is to
[2:18:52] bring it back to his original again
[2:18:58] and the prophet demonstrated that or
[2:19:00] rather God demonstrated that through the
[2:19:03] prophets
[2:19:07] do you believe it
[2:19:10] it is part of the message that we
[2:19:13] believe
[2:19:14] the message was not given to Earth I was
[2:19:18] only
[2:19:20] but by power
[2:19:22] and the action of the Holy Ghost
[2:19:27] when we are born again we are born into
[2:19:30] the kingdom of God
[2:19:33] to have access to the power of God
[2:19:39] amen
[2:19:41] you know here
[2:19:43] you know um
[2:19:45] this place is not like Africa
[2:19:50] maybe in Africa we have more demons I
[2:19:52] don't know or maybe we have black demons
[2:19:56] maybe here I have white demons I'm sorry
[2:20:02] you know
[2:20:03] um
[2:20:04] sometimes you have to prove that you're
[2:20:06] a Christian
[2:20:11] I will tell you certain things that
[2:20:14] you will not believe
[2:20:17] that happens I mean I'm sure how African
[2:20:19] Brothers here
[2:20:22] in fact people do certain things with
[2:20:24] the power of the devil
[2:20:26] I'm telling you
[2:20:28] in Nigeria you can be in Nigeria and
[2:20:31] kiss somebody in Canada
[2:20:33] you bring a bowl of water
[2:20:36] call his name and it will appear and
[2:20:39] then there you kill him you see blood in
[2:20:42] the water
[2:20:44] I'm sure you can't believe that
[2:20:47] it's wild
[2:20:50] but it happens
[2:20:54] you can take a gun and find somebody you
[2:20:57] get the bullet and throw it at you
[2:21:04] Brahma is that correct
[2:21:08] in Ghana
[2:21:10] they don't have Juju in Ghana
[2:21:12] they do
[2:21:15] no I'm I'm just tell you what's the time
[2:21:18] does
[2:21:19] well
[2:21:21] we talk about don't think it is
[2:21:23] impossible that's the point I'm trying
[2:21:25] to make any Satan can do that God will
[2:21:28] do more
[2:21:30] amen
[2:21:32] God we do more you don't think it's
[2:21:35] impossible
[2:21:36] because having that feeling oh oh
[2:21:40] no we're talking of now
[2:21:43] that is time we are living we are
[2:21:45] getting the the the the the more we get
[2:21:48] closer to the coming of the Lord the
[2:21:50] more we are like him not just in words
[2:21:53] but in action in our ways of life in
[2:21:57] power amen
[2:21:59] we demonstrate him it is here on Earth
[2:22:02] because over there we don't we have no
[2:22:05] work to do there all that we need to do
[2:22:07] if we have to accept but it is now
[2:22:12] amen
[2:22:13] [Music]
[2:22:16] so don't say don't begin to think oh can
[2:22:19] it be done no don't say that
[2:22:21] can be done
[2:22:23] and it's being done
[2:22:25] amen I remember we went to somewhere to
[2:22:29] preach before I came here very remote
[2:22:31] area very very remote area and
[2:22:36] the road was very bad that was his dream
[2:22:40] we have to literally drive through the
[2:22:43] stream he said well you are lucky
[2:22:46] because it has no rain if it rain you
[2:22:48] cannot do it
[2:22:50] so we drove and we got there
[2:22:53] so brother we witnessed a long time ago
[2:22:55] you know uh well let me start from there
[2:22:58] I'm sorry please are you are you are you
[2:23:01] happy with me
[2:23:02] yeah
[2:23:04] well I'm taking your time
[2:23:08] you know I may not see you anymore
[2:23:12] no it's true
[2:23:13] we will not see a game just bear with me
[2:23:17] those brethren
[2:23:20] we preached today about three years ago
[2:23:22] the very much area
[2:23:24] and he said look is this church maybe
[2:23:27] about 100 or 120 church members so I
[2:23:30] will preach to them
[2:23:33] about 80 percent of them believed
[2:23:36] so because what they have they have to
[2:23:38] live
[2:23:39] it was a denomination
[2:23:41] they have to leave the church so the 20
[2:23:44] they were claiming ownership of the
[2:23:46] church building
[2:23:49] and this will say no we are more a
[2:23:51] number so we have to own the church
[2:23:52] building you have to go
[2:23:54] and it was like you know it was I told
[2:23:57] the brand they called me what must we
[2:23:59] say brother leave the place for them go
[2:24:01] and fellowship under a tree or a
[2:24:03] classroom it's not the building it is
[2:24:06] God in your midst God will give you
[2:24:08] another another
[2:24:10] building and within I don't know
[2:24:15] that was lightning turned out from
[2:24:17] heaven and removed the building
[2:24:20] completely destroyed
[2:24:24] Asus as you cannot fight against God
[2:24:28] so they call me
[2:24:30] to visit them so when they are and they
[2:24:33] had a problem they didn't have rain
[2:24:36] they are farmers they planted they plant
[2:24:38] rice he played their rice brother were
[2:24:40] in trouble because there's no rain
[2:24:43] this year you know to be I think don't
[2:24:46] worry I think God is able to make cream
[2:24:48] and we pray together it was around maybe
[2:24:52] two o'clock in the afternoon
[2:24:55] and so we left starting was telling me
[2:24:58] move fast because if it rains
[2:25:01] you will not get back home
[2:25:04] and then we moved when we go to our
[2:25:07] destination within two hours they called
[2:25:09] us that is raining heavily
[2:25:11] God sent rain

[2:25:38] are talking to the creator of Heaven
[2:25:43] amen
[2:25:46] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:25:49] sorry I was reading something
[2:25:51] uh he said now one man fell he lost
[2:25:55] this and now what he lost in the fall
[2:25:58] Christ came as a redeemer did you ever
[2:26:01] stop to think one crowd within us for
[2:26:07] what did he redeem us for
[2:26:10] in the Kingdom
[2:26:13] oh don't we stand the power of this
[2:26:17] world that they gave our heart that we
[2:26:20] must live for him
[2:26:25] that is what he did not to be nice well
[2:26:27] it's good to be a good brother God bless
[2:26:31] you God bless you we eat we sleep come
[2:26:34] to church clap our hands and go home and
[2:26:36] come again next Sunday no we have
[2:26:39] something to do right
[2:26:40] unless you are not in the body of Christ
[2:26:43] amen he has sometimes we Overlook it
[2:26:47] the small small things if a housewife be
[2:26:51] a wonderful housewife
[2:26:53] that is your postal Duty be the best
[2:26:57] that is why he redeemed you
[2:27:01] because you have a neighbor
[2:27:03] I did your judgment
[2:27:05] did not say about that you see I didn't
[2:27:07] say no wait a minute hey come here my
[2:27:09] daughter do you know this person yes
[2:27:12] that's my neighbor this is the way she
[2:27:14] lives so he may not have preached it but
[2:27:16] you saw his life you saw her life why
[2:27:19] didn't you do like that
[2:27:21] that's what what got to the king
[2:27:24] it's a kid I just was able to go and do
[2:27:27] likewise I will accept you now there's
[2:27:29] no need to fight just do what you did
[2:27:31] but it was not a hymn to do it
[2:27:37] right so let us do
[2:27:39] eBay when he was doing it
[2:27:41] he himself you understand
[2:27:43] so why should I just kill this innocent
[2:27:46] lamb why
[2:27:48] because whatever you do it just do it
[2:27:51] doing it he couldn't get away from it so
[2:27:54] he had to do but that was the will of
[2:27:56] God by Revelation he did it by faith
[2:28:00] believing that it is the will of God but
[2:28:03] Cain uses
[2:28:05] intellect say oh he's a nice God he's a
[2:28:08] wonderful god let's prepare some flowers
[2:28:11] and some good tomatoes apple and saying
[2:28:15] the best
[2:28:16] that guy he did not give God rotting
[2:28:18] things he gave the best
[2:28:23] but it was not according to the word of
[2:28:25] God
[2:28:26] so God rejected it so what God is
[2:28:29] looking for is what you do I according
[2:28:32] to his word
[2:28:33] and that is why he redeemed us
[2:28:37] amen amen
[2:28:40] now we are okay uh now the thing of this
[2:28:45] is the sincere restaurant man back that
[2:28:47] is paragraph 11 now now the thing of it

[2:29:20] channels that he made
[2:29:22] a man fall
[2:29:24] do you understand
[2:29:27] those channels had to be cleansed
[2:29:31] the way we do our business we should not

[2:36:37] he came from Satan he came by the law of
[2:36:40] Satan but there is also the law of God
[2:36:44] who must hold on to that if this can
[2:36:47] work this will work better blessed be
[2:36:50] the name of the Lord
[2:36:53] don't see they belong to us our sons and
[2:36:56] daughters of God
[2:36:58] I was literally
[2:37:00] see those things in our life
[2:37:03] you can
[2:37:05] truly claim to believe in Divine Healing
[2:37:09] when
[2:37:10] you are sick and you hold on to the hand
[2:37:13] of God and you see healing then it shows
[2:37:16] that you believe
[2:37:18] it's not by saying it
[2:37:21] but when you are feeling that pain
[2:37:25] when this doctor says sorry we can't
[2:37:27] help you anymore
[2:37:29] then you say I appeal my case
[2:37:33] and you hold on that is when you believe
[2:37:35] the Divine Healing
[2:37:40] you know the promise that will be tested
[2:37:42] on the thing to have claimed to believe
[2:37:47] you'll be sick
[2:37:49] I'm not causing you I'm just telling you
[2:37:51] the truth
[2:37:53] you'll be sick
[2:37:54] and you'll be made to prove
[2:37:57] that you believe in Nevada
[2:38:00] by your attitude towards that sickness
[2:38:06] when you're running up and down as as
[2:38:08] hopeless and helpless human being just
[2:38:11] ensure that we believe
[2:38:13] we believe we go to the hospital is fine
[2:38:15] but healing comes from God the daughters
[2:38:19] cannot heal
[2:38:21] they can't heal
[2:38:24] because they're to die
[2:38:27] that is he cannot heal
[2:38:29] pharmacists die
[2:38:31] so
[2:38:33] so we cannot have absolute confidence in
[2:38:37] them
[2:38:39] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:38:41] this war we are living in
[2:38:44] we need God
[2:38:46] in every aspect of our life
[2:38:53] let's read this
[2:38:56] as I've said Faith doesn't come by
[2:38:59] fasting
[2:39:01] say those who come by praying
[2:39:04] reading a book
[2:39:06] although that is good fasting praying
[2:39:08] and reading those are wonderful
[2:39:11] but Faith Comes by a settled
[2:39:16] something
[2:39:18] that is in the human heart
[2:39:22] that tells you just assure as you come
[2:39:26] to this church this afternoon when you
[2:39:29] came when you uh when you come home you
[2:39:33] told your wife you'll be home after the
[2:39:35] service was over and you do that
[2:39:38] unconsciously
[2:39:41] you just go out and get into your car
[2:39:44] and go home now you could not do it
[2:39:47] unless you have faith you could do it
[2:39:50] you've never moved from where you are
[2:39:54] sitting if you didn't have faith you
[2:39:57] could raise up but you you've done it so
[2:40:00] much and just become so accustomed to
[2:40:04] those laws till it's become natural to
[2:40:09] you
[2:40:11] and that is what happens in the kingdom
[2:40:14] of God to members of the kingdom of God
[2:40:17] is as simple as my brother standing up
[2:40:22] or sitting down
[2:40:24] you don't you have faith on the on the
[2:40:27] on the seat
[2:40:29] you believe it you carry your weight you
[2:40:31] have done it several times over and over
[2:40:33] so you now do it unconsciously you gotta
[2:40:37] I'm going home you're getting to your
[2:40:39] car say my darling I'll be there in five
[2:40:41] minutes and five minutes he was here
[2:40:43] that was an Act of Faith
[2:40:45] you have done it over and over that you
[2:40:49] got used to eat therefore you don't
[2:40:52] struggle to do it
[2:40:55] and that is the way faith is sometimes
[2:41:00] when we talk about things oh when will I
[2:41:03] have faith in my life you already have
[2:41:05] faith but you are not putting this into
[2:41:08] use
[2:41:09] the same thing when you feel headache
[2:41:13] you lay a hand on this I rebuke that
[2:41:15] demon or headache and it will go when
[2:41:18] you rebook it you don't expect it to
[2:41:22] stay and increase you're expecting a
[2:41:25] relief
[2:41:27] and you insist on it until it goes
[2:41:31] when you do that today tomorrow
[2:41:34] every day you get used to it
[2:41:38] are you following me if his leg he will
[2:41:41] not be bothered say Satan you are coming
[2:41:42] again that is my leg okay I rebuke you
[2:41:44] in Jesus Christ's name are you still
[2:41:46] there it must go because listen to me
[2:41:51] Satan has God's command
[2:42:00] human beings are the only ones that
[2:42:02] disobey God
[2:42:04] cannot disobey God
[2:42:06] so that is better than some people
[2:42:12] Satan cannot disobey God
[2:42:15] he knows
[2:42:18] he has a command
[2:42:20] that when we resist him
[2:42:23] it was flee from us
[2:42:27] who resists until he flees
[2:42:32] are you follow me
[2:42:34] he will come to you and then you resist
[2:42:38] he will say ah is he serious
[2:42:41] is he serious
[2:42:43] I do resist ah
[2:42:46] because the more you resist
[2:42:49] the more painful it is for him because
[2:42:52] he cannot continue because of the word
[2:42:56] of God God said we must leave that guy
[2:43:00] I must have that at the back of our mind
[2:43:04] in any way Satan shows himself we must
[2:43:07] resist him to the end he will fleeing
[2:43:10] don't worry it may take time if we may
[2:43:13] take a month
[2:43:14] well he was go don't confess negatively
[2:43:19] be positive stand on what you believe
[2:43:21] and you see he take his life
[2:43:24] that is what God put us here to do so
[2:43:28] who must be a good chance
[2:43:31] which always Satan comes God has given
[2:43:33] us Victory already
[2:43:35] all we need to do put our houses in
[2:43:37] order live the life
[2:43:40] amen of the people around you we see
[2:43:43] that you are a different human being
[2:43:46] and then you put the word into action
[2:43:49] and you stay by the world then you are
[2:43:52] doing the will of God you are working
[2:43:53] for the kingdom yeah
[2:43:55] and when you make your money your friend
[2:43:58] said you put yourself last God fast
[2:44:02] yeah we must follow those principles God
[2:44:05] Falls you take care of what belongs to
[2:44:08] God you're tired and offering it's true
[2:44:12] we take care of your family
[2:44:14] you take care of others the brethren
[2:44:18] and then take care of yourself last
[2:44:21] that is the principle
[2:44:23] uh where you do that we are working for
[2:44:26] the kingdom
[2:44:28] God will take care of your business
[2:44:31] because you are working for the kingdom
[2:44:36] if you don't give you cannot get
[2:44:39] we should not deceive ourselves
[2:44:43] it's a law
[2:44:44] it's a spiritual law
[2:44:46] you must give
[2:44:49] amen have one another
[2:44:54] by this people we know
[2:44:58] that were his followers because when he
[2:45:01] was here he did not live for himself
[2:45:04] he live for others
[2:45:06] we also must live for others we must get
[2:45:10] used to it
[2:45:11] so it will not struggle because part of
[2:45:14] our life
[2:45:16] God understands blessed be the name of
[2:45:19] the Lord
[2:45:21] because here
[2:45:23] we need him
[2:45:24] and the prophet said if you want to get
[2:45:29] a help from somebody then he must please
[2:45:33] the person
[2:45:35] you want Christ to help you then live by
[2:45:37] his word
[2:45:40] please him
[2:45:43] and then he will show his power he will
[2:45:47] manifest his presence
[2:45:49] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:45:51] I'm really sorry I know I've taken our
[2:45:53] time
[2:45:54] but I I want to close
[2:45:57] by saying this that we have been
[2:46:01] redeemed
[2:46:02] we have been brought back to what God
[2:46:06] made us originally
[2:46:09] situations may arise in our lives
[2:46:12] to put those things into manifestation
[2:46:15] who should not be afraid
[2:46:18] and we are not living by the law of of
[2:46:21] Satan here no we are living by the law
[2:46:24] of God because we belong to another
[2:46:25] kingdom no matter what happens we should
[2:46:28] be a good chance
[2:46:30] according to the word of God
[2:46:33] because the Bible said he will never
[2:46:37] leave us
[2:46:39] not forsake us
[2:46:42] those are two different things
[2:46:45] he will never leave you as a Believer if
[2:46:48] you are doing the right thing
[2:46:49] he will stay with you but if you are
[2:46:52] doing something wrong he will not
[2:46:54] forsake you he will wait for you to
[2:46:56] repent and come back to him
[2:46:58] blessed be the name of the Lord so we
[2:47:01] should be a good chance because he has
[2:47:03] made a way for us he has brought us back
[2:47:06] to what we should be blessed with the
[2:47:09] name of the Lord shall we stand on our
[2:47:12] feet as we pray together
[2:47:13] [Applause]
[2:47:16] they are Heavenly Father
[2:47:19] we thank you this afternoon
[2:47:23] for these few things that have been said
[2:47:26] though maybe I did not put them
[2:47:28] correctly but Lord you know the thoughts
[2:47:30] of my heart I mean you in your own way
[2:47:32] conveyed my brothers and sisters Grant
[2:47:36] unto them the revelation of what I have
[2:47:38] in my mind that which you want to convey
[2:47:41] to them may you help us Lord to overcome
[2:47:45] all these unbelieving spirits of the
[2:47:48] world that our assistant that will clock
