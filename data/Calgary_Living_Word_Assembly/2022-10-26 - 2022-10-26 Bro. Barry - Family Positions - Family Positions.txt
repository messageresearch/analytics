from them if you have a need tonight maybe just make it known unto him with an uplift hand gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight one more time we truly counted an honor to come before your throne Lord we know that your prophets said that there's no greater honor for man to be able to close his eyes and to open up his heart and to open up his voice and to speak directly unto you Lord Jesus there's no greater privilege in man that has ever been given than to be able to speak to the Great I Am and father tonight we just want to ask Lord Jesus as we approach your throne father that you would forgive us for any sin in our lives Lord father that you would Purge us of any iniquity Lord Jesus father that we could come before your very Throne tonight Lord Jesus just as Esther did one time father and look look for that scepter to be moved towards us and father we know that even before we step towards your throne we know that you've already positioned the scepter for us to touch Lord Jesus and tonight we just want to come forward and touch that scepter Lord we want to accept what you've done for us Lord Jesus we want to accept the word that you've given to us in the day in which we live father and Lord we just want to also bring all of these requests to you tonight father we ask that you would remember these little boys father RJ and Brock Lord Jesus that need a touch from you father Lord we pray that you would just touch their bodies tonight in the name of Jesus Christ father we pray for brother Mike you'll take Lord Jesus your servant you know him Lord you know the beginning and the end father you know every single situation that's going on in his life father and we know that you're in complete control and we trust you that way and father we just ask that you would touch our brother in the name of Jesus Christ that you would be with his wife Lord be with his family in his congregation as well Lord Jesus father we know that Lord many times the situations and the circumstances can seem to be more than we can bear just completely out of control but there's not one thing that's out of your control Lord Jesus and we thank you for that we just pray that your will would be done in that situation father Lord we ask that you would be with brother Aiden while he's at home father that you would just touch his body that you would raise him up

father Lord we would never want to gather and and just hear a man but father we have gathered together tonight to hear from you and father we know that Lord you always come according to our

one Lord Jesus father that we could just allow you to minister to us the words of Life father we just ask all these things now and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight thank you musicians if you have your Bibles I'd like to read from Ephesians chapter 5. certainly like to welcome our visitor tonight Brother Don Snow's mother God bless you Sister ly a pleasure to have you here forward to maybe some fellowship sometime if possible amen Ephesians chapter 5 we'll start with verse 21. I believe we're getting very familiar with this now but there's still so much more verse 21 of Ephesians chapter 5 says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God why submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word amen that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband chapter 6 verse 1 children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the Earth and ye fathers provoke not your children to Wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord let's just bow in prayer one more time our heavenly father Lord we thank you for your word thank you for your oh Lord Jesus for your grace and your mercy to each one of us Lord we just pray that you would bless the reading of your word now father that you would just break the bread of life open to us fresh once again we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ made me pray amen bless you tonight you may be seated for a few minutes certainly hope that we can not keep us long here tonight I'd like to continue on with our discussion about the families maybe from a little bit of a different perspective tonight I trust it's okay if you could turn over into the book of Titus I'd like to read Titus Chapter 2. as we get going certainly uh wonderful to be in the house of the Lord maybe before I get going too far I'll just have a couple of announcements here we've got the Men's breakfast coming up on Saturday we have four brothers uh that are going with me and uh so that's a total of five people should be a wonderful time um we have a communion service Sunday evening and we have a fellowship planned for Monday evening as well but as we've been saying all along there's no pressure for any of it you have to do what you feel led to do just because we're getting together doesn't mean that you have to be there and we certainly would love to have you but if you're busy or you feel too much pressure then by all means don't don't feel too much pressure we just want everyone to be comfortable that's our desire so if anybody else desires to go to Edmonton for the breakfast we certainly have room for more it will be a bit of a tight ride but I think the fellowship would be wonderful and I think we could probably squeeze one or two more in our vehicle and if you desire to go by all means let me know we're going to leave early Saturday morning and come back Saturday afternoon so um Titus Chapter 2. but speak thou the things which become sound Doctrine that the Aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity in patience the Aged woman likewise that they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accusers not given too much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed young men likewise exhort to be sober minded in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works in Doctrine showing uncorruptness gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again not per loining but showing all good fidelity that they may Adorn the doctrine of God our savior in all things for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee I just thought it would be good to take a step back maybe and talk about marriages talk about the the importance of marriages as believers we've been talking about the family roles and and it's such a a wonderful Direction I think it's really been uh a learning experience for me it's opened my eyes to much about the message and and about the Bible and how much there really is in there um the key to it all though I'll say it at the beginning of the service tonight is just simply get the Holy Ghost and and I say it simply get the Holy Ghost it's not a simple thing the Holy Ghost is the deepest mystery that there is because we read in Ephesians tonight at the end of Ephesians chapter five Paul says I speak concerning a mystery I'm talking about the mystery of Christ and his church I'm outlining that the roles in the family the wife to the husband the husband to the wife is a natural occurrence and that's the way that we are given instruction to live our lives according to the word in our families but I'm also speaking about the bride and Christ that mystery the deepest mystery that we could ever get is the Christ in you the hope of glory thought having that god-consciousness in every situation of our lives in every conversation of Our Lives the Holy Ghost will lead us into all truth um you know I've got some quotes that I want to read tonight and and just some thoughts that I want to bring out um just maybe a little bit of a correction from last week I was speaking and and talking about the book of Titus and I know last week I did say that the word says to instruct the young men but it doesn't say it verbatim to instruct the young men it's kind of part of the whole picture to instruct the young man but it doesn't say it verbatim I I understand that and I just like to correct that it doesn't say it that way it says to teach the young women that's what the book of Titus says and it says to exhort the young man that's what it says and and that word exhort is an encouragement it's it's a direction it's it's a leading out of out of Strong's I I just wanted to look it up and make sure that I'm heading the right way with this I would never want to go the wrong way I would never want to say something out of order that might um cause strange thoughts like I'm bringing a strange Doctrine or anything like that I would just like to make sure that I'm on the word and and when we talk about these things that it actually gives us the right direction because if I get off on the word and I bring something that's not correct then it's not going to do the right thing and the right thing is to encourage us to exhort us so that we can actually have that Supernatural effect of the word so I just wanted to look it up you know to exhort out of Strong's g3870 the exhort word is to call near that is to invite invoke by imploration hortation or consolation beseech call for be of good Comfort desire give exhort and treat pray that's the Strong's definition of the word exhort and and I think it's just it's a beautiful thing when we can look at it because the the scripture here is is it's about encouraging it's not about discouraging it's not even though it says at the very end of it don't don't be worried don't be afraid to to teach all things to be sound Doctrine and and don't be worried about what men say if you speak this word according to the way it's written and let no man despise thee but but exhort and rebuke with all authority so I just think it's important to to make sure that if I'm going to speak I want to make sure that I'm speaking correctly according to the word so I think last week I might have implied that it says something that it doesn't say and I just want to make sure that I get that and you know I apologize for that um so we want to exhort the young men we want to teach the young women and personally I believe that it's it's it's kind of both we want to exhort the young women to teach them and we want to teach the young men by exhorting them it's kind of the same thing now I don't want to upset anybody by saying it that way but I I just feel like it's kind of the same thing we want to teach the young men we have to teach our children the word of God says to train up our children in the way they should go so that it will not depart from them so they won't depart from it we have to make sure that we're training and teaching but what better way to do it than to exhort than to encourage than to reward for good behavior and and maybe not reward for bad behavior but sometimes it can be easy to exhort or to teach with an Iron Fist and what that does is it repels and it pushes people away it doesn't encourage um we can come to a place where people can speak if we don't do it correctly we can speak a husband can actually speak to the wife and the wife will just completely tune the husband out doesn't even hear the husband's voice it's just maybe static maybe at best in the background same thing with a wife to a husband she can speak and and the husband won't even hear her it'll just be like a static noise it'll just be her again talking you'll hear something in the background and the reason I'm saying that brothers and sisters and I apologize to my wife but we got to that place in our marriage there was a point in time where it was the strangest thing we were sitting at the table and we had friends over we were having dinner and and I had a friend say to me Barry didn't you hear your wife ask you two or three times for it to pass please pass the butter and I was no completely out to lunch with it but you know what it was it was an illness that I was suffering and and I'm sorry to say that that's the way it was for us in our marriage and and the reason for it I'll I'll say it openly is because I was out of my position wasn't because she was out of her position I was out of my spot anyways um yeah we can actually if we're not doing things correctly if we're not doing things kindly if we're not doing things with love then we're not going to get the results that we want if we're not according to First Corinthians chapter 13 the statue of a perfect man in our lives then we're not going to get the results that we're looking for we can actually be applying all of the word but not have First Corinthians chapter 13 functioning in our actions and even though we've got all the word we've got all the Cure everything is right there it's just going to be maybe not encouraged and it might not be received you know in Titus Chapter 2 Verse 6 in the Amplified Bible we'll read it first in in it just got me thinking about this I'm not trying to bring a correction or trying to argue my point or anything like that it just made me look at this and think about it you know in in Titus Chapter 2 Verse 6 it says young man likewise exhort to be sober minded I I just found it interesting the word exhort and and so I looked at this sort of the Amplified Bible it says in a similar way urge the younger men to be self-restrained and to behave prudently taking life seriously but in a similar way is what it says here in the Amplified Bible after the instruction teaching the woman to behave a certain way in a similar way urge the younger men to be self-restrained and to behave prudently taking life seriously but you know in all of these things we want to speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority and let no man despisely because why it says verse 1 that's verse 15 the end of it but verse 1 says speak thou the things which become sound Doctrine we have to do that in our our church and we have to do that in our homes in our families in our relationships we have to do that we want to make sure that we're speaking the word of God that's the only thing that's going to bring results that we want to see as Believers the word of God is the only thing that's going to do it if we get into some self-help thing some marital counseling from maybe a denominational perspective there might be things that will be helpful but there might be things that will be detrimental to our marriage as well I believe personally with all of my heart there's enough information in the message of the hour and there's enough information in the word of God and if you take those two and you bring them before the Lord Jesus Christ and you say reveal unto me what needs to happen he's not going to leave us out to pasture he's not going to leave us wondering and guessing he's actually going to tell us very clearly because that's the God we serve that's how he operates If we're honest if we're genuine if we're completely surrendered unto him you know marriage is God's masterpiece that's what brother Branham said out of the Masterpiece in 1964 brother Branham says notice the Great Masterpiece of the family the husband and the wife cannot truly be a family unless they are one they have to be if they're not they're not a good family a wife pulling one way and the husband pulling another he says that would make an awful family but in agreement with love one to the other that's a family I love how he says that love one to another because in the word of God we can say husbands love your wives wives reverence your husband's end of the end of discussion children obey your parents have a nice day go home right here we have the prophet of God saying we need to love one another and the word of God in Ephesians before you get into the family roles the husbands the wives the children it says submit yourselves one to the other in the fear of God understanding that God he's the ultimate Authority he says that would make an awful family but in agreement with love one to the other that's a family now that was God's masterpiece and now all the true family here portrays that see and I just look at the congregation I go to the pr the Lord in prayer and I start to list off all of the families I list off all the people here all the children here and I think about the families and how many there are there's so many families here that's what the church is made up of is families and potential families there's brothers that have the desire to get married they're sisters that have the desire to get married it's it's in the heart of a Believer because that's the great mystery that that Paul was talking about that was God's plan from the very beginning was to have a bride of his own choosing we know brother Branham says that in the in the in the spoken word is the original seed that was one of the things that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world you know I just can't help but think about this this this we were even talking about it but you know the roles that we have laid out in the word of God here in in Ephesians and and we've talked about the husbands and we've talked about the wives and we've talked about the children sometimes it's really good just to stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance and and to recognize that we have a job description we have a role description you know brothers and sisters thinking about the families and and the family situations in this world Satan has his guns trained on the families if you wonder why we're talking about the family so strongly and so muchly even if that's a word so continuously it's because Satan wants to get our families Satan wants to ruin the marriages and because we're in a message Church we're not exclusive to that we don't have some invisible barrier around us that says that our marriages can never be affected by Satan's tactics we are all subject to it it's the world in which we live in and and if he can get in our minds and get us thinking something that's incorrect according to the word then what's going to happen is we're going to have troubles in our marriage and just because we say we believe the message of of the hour and and God sent a prophet that don't mean nothing to Satan that's why the only way we're going to succeed in our marriage or as a husband or as a wife or as a mother or as a father is to have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives then we can actually have the Holy Ghost water this word and help us understand what our job description is because every one of us have parameters we all have instructions but if we don't get our minds stirred up our our remembrance about these descriptions then maybe we we could forget a little bit you know we all have jobs in our lives we all have jobs that we need to do sometimes it's just doing chores at home as children sometimes it's going to school and being on time and doing our homework and and just being quiet and listening in class sometimes it's it's being a husband and going to work and having a job and providing because if we don't provide for our family then we're worse than an infidel we all have jobs in our lives wives look after the homes they look after the children they look after their husbands the children obey their parents all of those are descriptions call them job descriptions and and you know in life we all need clear job descriptions imagine what it was like I was thinking about this imagine what it was like if if we simply assumed that everybody just knew their jobs and nobody ever said you know what we need to do this this way and we need to do that that way and and if we don't do it the other way that we're going to get this result if we didn't have discussions about about our jobs and and the requirements for them it could be really confusing but there needs to be a discussion an understanding for employees as a job and the same thing from employers so the employers know what to expect from the employee right and and both of those need to happen so that the customers can understand what what what to expect from the product that they're going to get but if everyone is just assuming that everybody understands everything there's probably going to be problems there's probably going to be confusion and assumptions and and it becomes frustrating and and and it makes people angry and maybe upset you know when when you're looking for a job employers they post a job description for the job they say what the job entails these are the things that we're looking for in an employee for this job and they say this is the remuneration the number of dollars they're going to give for that position so there's a clear expectation this is the job this is the pay it's pretty clearly laid out and and it's for the employers so that the employees come into it with eyes open they understand what's going on the employees have a clear understanding of what that job description is and sometimes when we get into a job we find ourselves doing just a little bit more than what was on that description it's just the way it works and you know when we can take the scripture here in in Titus if anybody ever wonders I don't know why I guess it's just the way it goes if you ever wonder about is there any instruction about being an employee in the Bible take a look at what it says about servants because we don't have slaves we don't have servants now that's not the life that we live in but it's speaking to something greater when we're a servant we're an employee we're going to work for somebody so take a look at what this job description is in verse verse 9 of Titus Chapter 2 exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters employees be obedient unto your employer and to please them well in all things not answering again not chirping off not talking about it behind their back to other employees and the worst thing is as Believers is to have other employees chirping off about the employer because you have to stand up and say I'm not interested I don't want to hear it he's the boss he's the owner he's the one that put everything on the line so that we could have a job we don't do that we just take our money and we go exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again not perlointing but showing all good Fidelity that they may Adorn the doctrine of God our savior in all things to be able to show the grace of God that he bringeth salvation he that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men that there's actually a God in flesh again employers need to show employees what needs to happen and when employees understand what that description is when they have a clear understanding of the job then they can actually do the job well and they don't need to worry about what else somebody else's job description is right If an employer or somebody else in the company were to say you need to do this and you need to do that well hold on a second you can say look my my job description says this you know I I understand that you want more and I could probably do more but maybe we should have a conversation about that maybe there's a need maybe an employee had to be let go maybe times are tough and we just need everybody to to batten down the hatches as it were and and just dig in and and everybody pitches in and does that extra job but sometimes an employer can actually just add things a little bit by a little bit by little bit and eventually that employee is overwhelmed and they don't know what way to turn but there needs to be a communication there needs to be a conversation to say hold on a second I'm actually overwhelmed in this position my job description says this but you're asking me to do that it's wonderful to look at it because the job descriptions that I'm referring to Loosely calling them job descriptions God gives us he'll never give us more than we can bear and the remuneration is eternal it's Eternal it's not just getting a reward here it's actually Eternal it's getting our children to see the life of Jesus Christ in us because when the children see the life of Jesus Christ in us then they're going to want a part of it they're going to want to get that life inside of themselves but if it's just something we talk about as lip service we say we go to church we believe God said a prophet we know the message of the hour We're Christians but then we live a life that's different and the children see it it's not a congruent message is what I've been saying that's kind of my word I guess congruent it has to be congruent got to be the same people outside that we are inside same people in the church that we are at home were at work sometimes we wind up doing more than our job descriptions show and it can be helpful just to reflect on our description so that we understand what's expected of us and that's kind of what I I feel like we're doing here is just sort of reflecting on our our job descriptions when we understand what the parameters are what the word of God expects it gives us all an understanding that the husbands are supposed to love the wives we're supposed to First submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God and I believe that lines up directly with what we read already out of the Masterpiece where brother Branham said to love one another if we can love one another then we've got the basis to go forwards but there's all to all all of these types are in our relationships but I'll just say this here just just for the sake of it for the record if anybody is maybe taking it out of proportion or has it out of proportion there's no employees in a marriage none no husbands no wives none and if that's the case someone needs to maybe stop and and take a step backwards and just maybe think about it and see if it lines up with the word of God but I'm not saying there's an employee in a marriage and there better not be an employee in a marriage if there is it's not scriptural everyone is to love one another and to submit themselves one to another firstly in the fear of God to understand that when we're doing this this isn't a game that we're playing this isn't something that we're just hoping is going to turn out right and we know that it's going to turn out right it has to turn out right because it's according to God's word you know if we need to have the fear of the Lord in our lives and the Strong's word fear g5401 to be put in fear alarm or fright be afraid exceedingly fear or Terror remember Abraham he fell into a deep sleep one night and he had a deep Terror a fear a fright he had the fear of the Lord it was in a thick darkness that he fell into in his dream and we know that's where God gave him the Covenant that's where the Covenant came to him but you know we're talking about marriages we're talking about relationships tonight I feel impressed just to talk about marriages uh together in general um the families but more so the marriage we had uh marriage um banquet this summer it was it was a wonderful event and you know brother Wayne covered some things and and one of the things that just it resounds in in my heart is that in a marriage there's only a certain amount of love and and if you can Envision a vial of Love Inside the heart if if we don't treat that heart correctly that vial can break it can get broken and and the love that's inside that vial can leak out slowly over time and and if we're not careful we can find out that there's no more love in that vial and and then what is there left over you know what's interesting brother Wayne he said this that there was a counseling session between a brother and a wife and and there was a situation where she was upset because he did this and he did that and he did the other thing and then the the husband he turned and said I never did anything brother Wayne said that's your problem a marriage is just like a bank account if you're not going to put anything into it how do you ever expect to take anything out how could you ever expect to take any money out of the bank if you've never deposited anything into it and sometimes you can put a whole bunch into it at one point but then stop depositing and just withdrawing continually withdrawing eventually that bank account goes to empty and then you go into your overdraft and and you have a problem you know the greatest thing that God gave man out of thirsting for life in 1960 brother Branham says this is this is just it's so interesting because it speaks to the time in which we live in but this is even in 1960. you can imagine how far it's gone to where we're at now he says and then when we stopped upstairs and and where my room I got off he's on an elevator my you could hear up and down through here all the cigarette smoke and boiling and the dirty jokes everywhere and I started to walk up through the hall and I I heard somebody around the corner and it was too young American women both of them wearing wedding bands with just their underneath garment on here they come with a bottle of whiskey staggering over one another having a little clean fun hubby home babysitting he says that's where you get it just a little clean fun that's what we call it that's what all this is here a popular television screens and all this advertisement out here of whiskey and beer and smoking and stuff think about the advertising they had back then brother Branham says it's the Gate of Hell think about the advertising we have right now every one of us has a television in our pocket with way more information coming to it way more advertising coming to it he says it's the Gate of Hell I may sound old-fashioned but my young sister my young brother remember that is the Gate of Hell I'll tell you honestly when you start to read this and you really take it in it makes me want to just not have a phone really the prophet's saying it's the Gate of Hell you could say brother Barry he says it's a television but you know what that Vision has gone to our pockets we all know that right even televisions if you buy a television it's just like a phone it's the same technology all through it he that loves that thing shall die eternally that's true the soul that sinneth shall die the woman that lives in pleasure is dead yet while she's alive says the Bible that's the truth how the Womanhood that's sweet greatest thing God gave men outside of Salvation was a wife she was to comfort him to help him to bless him and to console him and to be a real companion to him and today it's so degraded and demoralized 1960 so degraded and demoralized till it's why the hot and thoughts of Africa could come here and teach our women how to live moral that's right goes on to say in the Africa there's a tribe of them back there that if a woman isn't married by a certain time she has to get out of the tribe and if she is married and before she is married she has to be a test for her virginity if she be found guilty she has to tell the man that's done it and they kill them both together brother Branham in 1960 here saying be a lot of killing around the United States if that took place wouldn't it think of it Heathen it's a disgrace it's a stain on that flag that our forefathers fought for they fought for the freedom of religion the the freedom to be able to go on worship according to the the way they felt led to by the Revelation that was given to them Heathen it's a disgrace it's a stain on the flag that our forefathers fought for it's a disgrace to our nation and when the Womanhood is broke and motherhood in any Nation the backbones broke God give us old-fashioned mothers again that's one of the probably the main reason the biggest reason brothers and sisters that I want to do this on Wednesday nights is to talk about this if our marriages get upset if the devil gets in and gets in our marriages and gets them all upset then then we've got a problem brother Branham says it right here if Womanhood is broke and motherhood in any Nation the backbone's broken mother give us good Lord give us good mothers you know um when motherhood's broken brother Brown I'm out of the flashing red light taking that thought motherhood's broken motherhood's broke nations are breaking now if you want to see where Jesus said that read Matthew 5 28 that's where it was at let's let's go and read Matthew 5 28. it's interesting when we look at this I'm fascinated by it myself because he's talking about Womanhood Womanhood start with verse 27. you have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you that whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her have committed adultery with her already in his heart how is motherhood being broken the women presenting themselves in such a way but also men looking upon them and you know it's it's it's a it's a frightening thing Matthew 24 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved it's an endurance race brothers and sisters we're running a marathon Race and it's all about making sure that we Pace ourselves properly that we make sure we have the right nutrients that we breathe right that we do everything that we're supposed to do because quitting is not an option but Satan wants to make it as convenient as possible for us to quit for us to just simply say you know I just can't stand that person anymore I don't know what's going on but I just can't live with that person anymore I want to say this very clearly because I've experienced it myself Satan wants to take the marriages even of Believers he wants to get in the marriages and he wants to destroy the marriages and why does he want to do it he wants to do it so he can devour your children he wants to get your children that's what Satan's after if he can split the parents up especially the ones who are message Believers the ones who claim to believe that God sent a prophet if he can get in there and split those up then he's actually got trophies on his wall right there because the children are going to say they never believed anything it's not real what are they doing brothers and sisters think about it Satan's coming for your children and you can choose to get together and be strong husbands and strong wives according to the word according to the job description that we've been given or we can actually become weak in the knees and say I don't know if I can do it but I guarantee you if you get the Holy Ghost in your life if you get the Holy Ghost in your marriage that you can do it and I'm not doubting for a second that nobody does somebody doesn't have the Holy Ghost in their marriage and that somebody is at the place where maybe it's a terrible situation I'm not saying that at all but what I am saying is I know that the devil is roaming back and forth like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and he loves to get his hands on children I come from a broken home brothers and sisters if my parents would have believed this message of the hour I probably never would have ever accepted it I ran from the Pentecostal church that we were a part of because of it because I could see that it was false it was fake how could I ever follow something that would be that way where marriage it was acceptable first of all to be divorced second of all divorce happened again it was terrible I thought there's no no goodness there's no truth in in life one of these days I'll give my full testimony but you know what I want to say this because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold and and you know when we get into looking at iniquity it's doing something that we know we shouldn't do and it's not doing something that we know we should do it's it's maybe getting on our phones brothers and looking at things that we shouldn't look at and and instead of going on our knees and praying like we should do we waste our time looking at things that we shouldn't and and maybe it's not on our phones maybe it's in other avenues doing things that we probably shouldn't do that aren't edifying to the spirit in our lives which is taking our lives away from our families taking our lives away from our prayer lives causing us to have iniquity in our hearts and when we have iniquity in our hearts guess what you might think nobody else can tell but I promise you that your family knows it they might not know what it is but they know something's wrong and when they know something's wrong that's when things start to stir up that's when the devil gets in that's when he gets in our heads that's when he makes us think she's thinking that or she said that she said something that she would say normally every single time but because she said it today and I've got iniquity in my heart I'm going to say she said it in a way that's not right and because I'm the husband she should submit to me then we go and try and pull out the job descriptions and we actually make a mess of things the only way we're going to be able to do it brothers and sisters is to make sure that we're in our positions and you know Brothers I'm just going to say it plainly Redemption only comes through the mail only gosh God didn't come down in the Garden of Eden and say Eve where are you came down and said Adam what's your problem Adam you know what your problem is but remember brothers that Adam he knew full well Eve was deceived Adam knew full well that his wife was out of order Adam knew full well that she cheated on him with another animal Adam nufo well what the implications was to redeem her but Adam still said I'm willing to give it all for my wife because she's my wife I don't care what she's done I'm going to redeem her myself to have the attitude and I'm saying this because I've heard it said Brothers say that they want to put their wives away because their wives have cheated on them maybe you've got all the Liberty in the in the world to do it according to the word but would you would you really do it what about the grace that God has bestowed upon you goodness sakes it's shocking I know in the Scripture it says somewhere that we've just forgotten about the grace for of God in our lives we've just forgotten about the the love that God has for us out of the flashing red light brother Branham goes on to say female life has been the cause and form of falling upon that sexual power that has been the ruin if you want to trace back there's some Nations that I trace back to their fall one was Egypt Assyria Rome and what more fell by the power of woman and what is it it's it's the degradation of morals that's what it is when all morality just goes out the window and it turns into sexual sin that's what the nation is as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man right that's where we live today he goes on to say notice there is nothing that God could do could there was notice there is nothing that God could give a man outside of Salvation better than a nice wife better than a nice wife there's no man can console no person can console a person when they're tired they they won't confide in anyone like they do their own wife and what a fortunate thing you brothers are when you've got a nice little wife that's clean and upright and moral and you can come in when you're tired and weary and set down and she can talk to you she can do more with you than anybody else that's right she's a jewel she's a queen you know brothers and sisters as Believers of this message of the hour I want to say this if we're not treating our wives exactly like the prophet said here then we're out of order there's something wrong something's wrong with our experience if we're not treating her like she's a jewel and we're not treating her like a queen I say Lord help me what this is for me what I'm looking at tonight brothers and sisters it seems like I'm coming heavy on the on the husbands and I don't mean to be but you know we need to look at our job descriptions we need to make sure that we understand the parameters of of where our jobs are and you know the husband's parameters are over all of it because God's not going to come and ask the wife why did your family mess up why is there a problem in your home he's gonna come and ask the husband husband what's going on just like he did with Adam but Redemption comes to the man if we've got problems in our homes Brothers It's Time to Get On Our Knees and find out what that problem is we need to be the ones doing the work to find that problem we can't be pointing the finger and saying the children or the wife or the neighbor or whatever else it's got to be ourselves looking at ourselves in the mirror saying what's going on what's the problem because clearly there's a problem someone needs to find the solution Redemption comes through the mail out of the world is falling apart brother Branham says it's just a shame that the enemy has taken our American woman and stripped them down out there on the streets and why it's a disgrace no wonder the little boys and little girls and things are in such a shape as they are today they're always trying to pattern after some woman out here in Hollywood married four or five times and what year is this 1963 oh did they even have a computer then I think the Saturn V program was well underway they had what they called a super computer didn't they and it would be a room probably as big as this they would be all computers and and real tapes and all of that but now brothers and sisters we've got all of that information on a teeny little microscopic chip that fits in our pockets that's already in our phones that already influences our children that already influences the husbands that already influences the wives and it's through social media is probably the biggest opportunity for that and and through social media through news through the advertisements all of that that brother Branham just talked about is just streaming it's no wonder they call it streaming it's streaming right into our minds and if we're not careful we can pattern ourselves we can begin to pattern ourselves brothers and sisters what we need to be doing is streaming the word of God streaming the message of the hour into our lives into our homes and continually doing that making sure that that's what we're streaming and what we're doing brother Branham goes on to say and she'll come out with some sort of a nude clothes on and all the little girls in the country will pattern after that what a Pity that's too bad yes sir it's too bad and it's got into the church I just want to say this you know we look at it and he's talking about Hollywood and the picture show that you would have to go and spend money and go down and buy a ticket and go and sit there and watch and then actually maybe a television two or three channels in your house but here we are now with what they call influencers Right YouTube influencers Facebook influencers Tick Tock is probably the biggest one all of that is influence of the devil that wants to get into your children's Minds get into your husband's Minds get into your wives mind it's the devil it's not something good and wholesome brothers and sisters she'll come out with some sort of new clothes on and all the little girls in the country will pattern after that once upon a time it was a movie star now it's influencers now it's it's all of this that we just talked about he goes on to say the beautiful virtue that God gave a woman to be a mother has been marred and that's the backbone of the nation you break the motherhood and you've broke the nation right then that's the one thing that helps hold it together real genuine Parenthood and how do you get Parenthood he doesn't say real genuine motherhood he says real genuine Parenthood anybody can just almost anybody could be a father but to be to be a dad someone could actually have a child but to be able to actually be a father to be that influence to be that parent it's a totally different thing it's not something that's just for the faint of heart it's a lifelong commitment and and as Sons and Daughters of God we've been given all the tools I think that we need to be able to succeed in the position but I I just think it's amazing to look at it the devil is coming for us he wants our children but I'm just so glad that we can all just Rejoice that he can't have him he can't have them because the prophet said we can apply the token to our families not just to our homes not just to our own lives and say that we're okay we can apply the token to our very families and because the word of God it says it in in a is it Ephesians yeah even while we were yet dead in sins and trespasses right he hath quickened us so he doesn't come for us when we're the most polished cleaned up individuals that have been going to church for a few weeks and that's when we can actually be saved no no he doesn't Quicken us then we have the ability to apply that token to our children to our homes and Satan can't have them I I just think it's beautiful thought to recognize that we have a job description we have parameters for our lives we've gone over them and over them and I know I could be saying more about that I think it's probably a discussion maybe for a later time just for the sake of time I don't want to go too far into it but we we know that the husbands are supposed to love their wives and the wives are supposed to reverence their husbands and the children are supposed to obey the parents because that's right in the Lord but if the devil can get into our lives and mix us up then he can cause us to maybe doubt and maybe question and that's exactly what he did from the very beginning Satan got in the Garden of Eden and he said to Eve everything was built this way God created you this way Eve so that you could actually bring to pass the word of God and and she was truly deceived into it but remember we've said it Adam wasn't she was deceived to believe that she was doing good when she actually was sinning and that's what deceit is is thinking that we're doing things right but we're still not quite doing it a hundred percent right and one percent not right is it's wrong one word off is Satan's kingdom we've heard that said so many times we can have the whole word of God we can have the Cure we can have the entire word of God we can have all the message of the hour we can say that God sent a prophet we can go to church all the time we can tithe we can be faithful in every single thing but if we're off in the way that we treat our families brothers and sisters we're not going to see the results we're looking for we're not going to have the the marriage that we're after I'm not trying to give us the self-help thing other than there's a possibility that if like brother Wayne said if we're going to be married brothers and sisters why not be happily married why not have the joy of the Lord in our marriage why not be happy to come home and to see our wives why not be happy that our husbands are coming home to see them if we're not in that position if that's not the way it's going on then something is out of kilter and I want to say there's a cure for that in the word of God it's not in some psychological realm some doctor somewhere that's going to prescribe something so he's going to give you the the checklist of things that you need to do to have a better life it's actually the word of God it's understanding what his job description is for us in our positions you know I'm fixing to close here just like brother Branham says out of the masterpiece in just about five minutes or ten and I'd say probably 12. I'm fixing to close here he says notice the Great Masterpiece of the family the husband and the wife cannot truly be a family unless they're one they have to be if they're not they're not a good family and I would say this I'm not saying this is what the prophet said this is what I'm said I'm sad that's not good English but you know what I mean right um they're not a good family I want to say this they're not a healthy family they're a sick family and you know what there's a cure for it and it has to be applied the right way we can go and get a medication from a doctor for an illness and we can have the Cure right in our very hands there's the Cure maybe it's a bottle of pills whatever you want to call it it's a vial of something we can drink we have the whole cure right here but if we drink it all at one time it could kill us if we don't drink it at the right time or or don't do it according to what the prescription says it's going to hurt us it's not going to help us we can take the word of God and do the same things brothers and sisters it's got to be the way it's prescribed to us we've got to apply it the way that the word says to brother Bradham says they have to be if they're not they're not a good family wife pulling One Way husband the other that'll make an awful family but in agreement with love one to the other that's a family he goes on to say and now that was God's Masterpiece and all the true family here portrays that see and now the Masterpiece family has come again this is where we live brothers and sisters Christ and his bride ready to come second Adam second Eve ready now to return back to their home the whole picture has been Redemption from where it was bringing it back see just exactly bringing it back again and this is the part that Thrills me with this whole study because we can look at it naturally and talk about the husband and the wife and the children but we all fit those descriptions because we're all the Bride of Jesus Christ and we're all Sons and Daughters of the most high God maybe we're not all husbands but that's okay we don't all have to be husbands but this is what we're talking about this great mystery that Paul was talking about in Ephesians is is Christ in you the hope of glory it's really understanding that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and we have been given a very specific role description in the word of God and even according to the message of the hour the one who is actually the jewel the one who is actually the queen imagine that that's the way God sees us even in the midst of all of our Humanity what a tremendous thing remember that Redemption always comes from the male even when maybe this flesh just doesn't feel like it maybe even just when our spirit doesn't feel like it remember the word of God says to not let a root of bitterness husbands to get in there if a root of bitterness gets in that Redemption isn't going to come and it takes I want to say this and maybe it sounds crazy but it takes a lot of courage to set aside all of your humanity and all of your feelings and emotions and Wade through and say I know that even though maybe I feel like I'm right and I know that I'm right and she's wrong I'm gonna be Redemption for her I'm gonna be Redemption for my children I'm going to be Redemption for my entire family because that's the way God set things up imagine if he said oh I can't believe that they were going to behave that way I knew they were going to behave that way so I'll just strike them all off the Record forget about them imagine if Jesus spoke when they put the bag over his head and they smote him on the head and said speak and prophesy and say who it was that hit you or imagine if he actually shouted out and said this is just more than I can bear forget about all those people that live in the age of laodicea forget about them you're not putting that crown of thorns on my head imagine if he just didn't actually after he stumbled and fell bearing the cross walking up the street with bloody Footprints thinking that I'm just going to pick up that cross and go all the way with it because nobody else in this world is ever going to be able to imagine if he didn't do that imagine if he just snapped his fingers and called the legions of angels when he was tied to that whipping post imagine back in the garden he said oh the disciples all they do is sleep why on Earth would I be the Redemption for them because that was his plan all along and you know I just think it's so beautiful it's so fascinating to recognize that the Redemption comes to the husband the Redemption comes through the Dead the Redemption comes from the Lord Adam brought Redemption to Eve and he knew the full cost of it he knew what was going to happen he knew that meant death because that's what God said because remember God didn't tell Eve that if you eat off that tree that you shall surely die he said it to Adam when she was in him when they were still one he said it to Adam Abraham brought Redemption to Sarah she tried to do it her own way she tried to say take Hagar we'll make this promise come to pass don't worry God's probably did sleep and he's not going to make it happen we'll just make this happen don't worry about it and what happened made a mess we can still see it today Boaz brought Redemption to Ruth the male brings Redemption to the female Brothers ahazirus brought Redemption to Esther the female doesn't bring Redemption to the man the female stands and loves her husband reverences her husband submits herself to her husband waiting for the husband to bring Redemption to the wife David brought Redemption to Abigail Jesus Christ he brought Redemption to his bride how much more brothers and sisters do we ought to bring Redemption to our homes when we can see things going wrong do we get upset and point the fingers or do we get on our knees and pray do we embrace our family and love them do we display First Corinthians chapter 13 charity Divine love the Capstone Ministry that we so love the message of the hour do we live it or do we just preach it it's got to be lived brothers and sisters if we're just preaching it Satan knows it and he's going to come around he's going to get in your marriage and he's going to try and get your children but you know we have the opportunity to be the Shepherds of our own flocks to be the Shepherds of our homes and what does brother Bradham say when he describes the shepherd the shepherd all of the animals all the animals can go out and live in the field but those sheep they're the ones that come back at night and they go into the Sheepfold and what happens the shepherd lays down in the doorway of that Sheepfold the shepherd smells like those sheep the shepherd is the one that guards those sheep to make sure ain't no wolves getting in here ain't no thieves breaking through to try and steal these sheep and ain't no devil getting in to steal my children no way brothers and sisters we have that responsibility to make sure that we're guarding our families that way that regarding our wives our Jewels our queens that way we've got to be doing that how much more now than 1960 when brother Branham was talking about that the picture shows the movies and the and and the TV when there's maybe two channels to watch how much more with the information Super Highway you know what Satan's not going to come to our houses brothers and sisters as a roaring lion knocking on the door or or pawing at the door scratching our screen door to bits he's not going to do that he's going to come through the devices into our homes he's going to come and and get into our wives Minds through the things that she watches to the people that she listens to he's going to try and do everything that he can to upset the families he's going to try and do everything that he can to upset the church but you know one thing I can say on a Wednesday evening we can look at this and we can say praise be to God because he's coming he's tried to upset the church but we've stuck together we have to endure brothers and sisters the same thing in our marriage we've got to be willing to fight for our children we've got to fight for our our marriage it's not something that it's just given to us for free even though God did give it to us it's up to us what we do with it because one day Brothers we're going to answer for it we're going to stand before God and he's going to say Well done thou good and faithful servant enter ye into the joys of the Lord or he's going to say why did you do that I gave you all those talents I gave you so many warnings I gave you so many encouragements all these things we gave you over and over and over again all these things to help you and you just rejected it we're gonna answer devil wants to get inside your marriage if there's one marriage he wants to upset he wants to mess with every single marriage we know that he's trying to redefine the definition of marriage but if there's one marriage he wants to get inside brothers and sisters it's the people who claim to believe the word of God for their day because I promise you he doesn't believe that you believe Satan does not believe that you believe Satan did not believe that Jesus believed because if he believed that Jesus believed he never would have put him on a cross and that's why you have pressure in your marriage brothers and sisters because Satan wants to get you he doesn't believe that you're a Believer he doesn't believe that you're a son or daughter of God but you know what when you actually take this word and apply it then you will be able to prove that you are a son and daughter of God you will be able to prove that Satan has no power over you or your wife or your children there will be no way for him to get in and mess with you and even if he does because he will even if he does you're going to be able to take the word and apply the word you're going to be able to come together in love and and reason together and say let's just let's just get together and reason around the word and go on our knees together and pray and you know what we'll cast Satan out we'll get him out because he's not allowed to stay he can't stay the word of God says to submit yourselves therefore unto God then resist the devil and he will flee from you Redemption comes

to work we've got to display love love is the only thing brother Branham says it very clearly for a purpose brothers and sisters love is the strongest force in the universe if we want to see our marriages fixed if we need to there's only one thing that's going to do it it's not it's not saying the word of God says you need to do this and you better get in line that's going to be that static we were talking about earlier our wives are just going to be like tune us out right but if we come to her and we grab her by the hand and we tell her honey I love you and I love you and I love you and I want to keep you and I want to encourage you I want to see you as my queen maybe I haven't treated you that well maybe I haven't been that way I know how God has been to me I know he's taken my hand when I've been a sinner when I was yet dead in sin and trespass and he came around and told me that you are not who you think you are you are my sinless spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ you're the one that I want to take for eternity to be my bride so honey I love you and I want you to be my bride and whatever I need to do to fix it I want to do that I want to fix it brothers and sisters There's Hope if we need hope and that hope is only going to come through Divine love that's all no other way by trying to take the word and slam it down is only going to push it farther apart I can promise you maybe stand with me tonight I'll call the musicians you know what brothers and sisters what is redemption it's love love love covers a multitude of sin First Corinthians chapter 13. Satan wants to destroy us Satan's coming for our marriages Satan's coming for our children and we have the opportunity to actually gather together and surround batten down the hatches as it were or maybe straighten up our ties and and and and flick our lapels and say that we're just a little bit self-righteous and we can just take the word and stand in our position and say you know what it's just going to be the way it's going to be we don't I don't think any one of us wants to be that way I I'm sorry I I don't even know what I'm talking the way I am I just know that Satan's coming for marriages brothers and sisters and I want to plead with us tonight to just take the word and apply the word the way the word says to the way the prophet says to not according to some tradition or or something that makes us feel like we're in a position that puts us somewhere that we're not all of us are sinners saved by grace it's only by grace that we're saved through faith lest any man should boast oh my let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father tonight Lord we just thank you for your goodness unto us Lord father I pray Lord Jesus for a special measure of Grace father for our families Lord Jesus for our marriages Lord I know that Satan is roaming about like a roaring lion he wants to devour our children and he wants to devour our marriages Lord he wants us as Believers of this message to redefine the the definition of marriage but Lord Jesus tonight I pray that we could just go right back to the very beginning and recognize that you put us together from before the foundation of the world Lord Jesus and Lord you can yourself to make sure that when when it was going to happen Lord Jesus that it would be you doing it and father you took us from your side just like you took Eve from Adam's side you took us from your side at Calvary and you said oh just rest little bride rest all is well you don't have to worry about a thing because I've done it all and then you went right down to Hell and you took the keys of death and Hell from Satan right off of his belt oh Lord Jesus and then you took and you led mankind oh father from the regions of the lost from Paradise father from everywhere they were locked up Lord Jesus you took them and you led them oh Father when you gave gifts unto men father we pray that we could just see that that happen in our lives Lord Jesus that we wouldn't look to the Rapture as an event Lord Jesus but that we would look at it as a as An Occurrence every single day in our lives father that we would see it as An Occurrence every day in our marriages Lord Jesus father with our children and our husbands and wives we would see the Rapture happening every day father as we go closer unto you father we just love you and we thank you we pray Lord Jesus that you would help us Lord to draw closer unto you father Lord to not think that any one of us has a special position Lord Jesus father help us all to recognize that each one of us is a sinner saved by grace father we love you we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and Lord you have said that if we call upon your name that we and our families could be saved so we cry [Music] cry out your name El shaddam foreign God of Grace Lord most high Jesus Christ [Music] we realize on your grace ground in Praise [Music] Jesus Christ father of Love Never failing to forgive each he told me it is a gift from you to live we're only here to tell the world about your grace until the day you take us all away so we cry have your name and tonight God of Grace [Music] oh Lord knows time Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Applause] Jesus Jesus Christ father of Life Seated on your throne of grace it's only by your mercy we are saved Lord you've said that if we call upon your needs that we and our families would be saved so we come without your name [Music] [Applause] Jesus Christ we [Music] on your grace [Music] Jesus Christ father of Love Never failing to forgive each moment is a gift from you to live we're only here to tell the world about your grace until the day you take us all the way so we cry I have your name God of Grace [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] God bless you tonight see you on Sunday Lord willing trust it everyone will come back safely until we meet again can we sing that song until we meet again [Music] till we meet till we meet at Jesus [Music] God be with me till we meet again till we meet till we believe [Music] me [Music] ant foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music]
