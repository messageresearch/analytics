[0:00] Lord,
[0:03] &gt;&gt; for your mercy never fails me.
[0:08] All my days
[0:11] I'm in hell in your hands.
[0:16] From the moment that I wake up
[0:21] until I lay my hands.
[0:25] Oh, I will sing
[0:27] of the goodness
[0:30] of God.
[0:31] Oh yes.
[0:35] All my life you have been faithful.
[0:39] Yes, you have, Lord. Oh,
[0:43] all my life you have been so so good.
[0:50] With every breath that I have made,
[0:56] oh I will sing
[0:59] of the goodness of God.
[1:04] I love your voice.
[1:07] Oh, you have led me through the fire.
[1:13] In darkest night, you were close like no
[1:19] other. So true, Lord. I've known you as
[1:22] my father,
[1:26] known you as my friend,
[1:29] and I have been
[1:32] in the goodness
[1:34] of God. Oh yes.

[2:03] of the goodness
[2:05] of God. Oh yes your
[2:10] goodness is running after. It's running
[2:14] after me.
[2:18] Your goodness is running after running
[2:21] after me
[2:24] with my life laying down. I surrender
[2:27] now. I give you everything.
[2:33] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:36] running after me. Your goodness, your
[2:43] goodness is running after. It's running
[2:46] after me.
[2:50] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:53] running after me.

[3:05] Your goodness is running after. It's
[3:09] running after me.
[3:15] All my life you have been.
[3:22] Oh, all my life you have been so so
[3:27] good.
[3:30] With every breath that I have made,
[3:36] I will sing

[3:41] of God. I love to sing. All my life once
[3:43] more as brother dawn comes. All my life
