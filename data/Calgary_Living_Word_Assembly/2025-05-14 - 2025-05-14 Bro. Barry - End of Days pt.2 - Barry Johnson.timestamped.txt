[40:56] Amen. The elected Amen. the fork known
[41:00] before the foundation of the world.
[41:01] Hallelujah. God bless you, brother Seth.
[41:04] Certainly good to see you, brother.
[41:07] Brother Seth is going to be sojouring
[41:08] here with us for a few weeks while he
[41:11] does some schooling here in the city.
[41:14] Um, if you have a need tonight, we know
[41:17] who is listening and who is more than
[41:19] able to meet your needs. Before we bring
[41:22] our needs to the Lord tonight, we just
[41:25] have one request that was brought
[41:28] forward. And that request is that we
[41:31] bring a praise
[41:32] report. My favorite kind of request.
[41:35] Amen. It's from Sister Amy. and she
[41:38] says, "I'm excited and humbled to share
[41:40] a praise report. I've officially
[41:43] accepted a new role. This opportunity is
[41:46] a true blessing and a testimony of God's
[41:50] faithfulness, provision, and perfect
[41:54] timing. I'm so grateful for how he
[41:57] opened doors and guided each step of the
[42:01] process. Also, I thank the church for
[42:04] the support and prayers. I kindly ask
[42:07] for your prayers as I navigate new
[42:11] responsibilities. Thank you for standing
[42:14] with me in faith. I'm trusting God to go
[42:18] before me in every detail of this
[42:22] journey. All glory to him, Sister Amy.
[42:26] What a wonderful thing it is to be able
[42:30] to give him praise.
[42:39] All he's looking for is a complete
[42:41] surrender in our lives. Amen. If you
[42:44] have a need tonight, maybe just make it
[42:45] known to him as we go on to him in
[42:47] prayer. Amen. Gracious heavenly father,
[42:50] we're so thankful that we can come unto
[42:52] you, Lord, to know you as our father,
[42:55] Lord, to know you personally, not
[42:58] because we sought you, but you sought
[43:00] us. Father, and you bought us with a
[43:03] price, Lord Jesus. You You proclaimed us
[43:07] to be your inheritance. And Father, we
[43:10] recognize that. And here we are tonight.
[43:12] We stand in awe of you, Father. We're so
[43:16] thankful for all the provision, all of
[43:19] the many opportunities that you provide
[43:22] us in our lives, Lord. Father, we know
[43:24] there's not one opportunity that we have
[43:26] in our life that you didn't bring to us,
[43:29] that you didn't allow to happen. Yes.
[43:31] Amen. And Father, we recognize that and
[43:33] we give you the praise for it, Lord
[43:35] Jesus. Tonight, Father, we just want to
[43:38] thank you for this wonderful praise
[43:40] report from Sister Amy. Lord, yes. Amen.
[43:43] It's so amazing to be able to just come
[43:46] unto you and give you praise. We know
[43:48] that once upon a time there were 10
[43:50] lepers that were healed of their
[43:51] leprosy, Lord.
[43:54] Nine of them ran
[43:55] away, but one of them stopped and turned
[43:59] and worshiped you and thanked you. And
[44:03] Father, we're so privileged to be able
[44:05] to do that tonight, to be able to
[44:07] worship you and to thank you for
[44:09] cleansing us, Lord, for healing us of
[44:11] our leprosy, of our unbelief. Lord,
[44:15] Father, tonight we pray that you would
[44:16] just be glorified with this praise
[44:18] report. that you would continue to bless
[44:20] Sister Amy, Lord, that you would lead
[44:22] her and guide her, Father. Navigate each
[44:24] and every step, each thought, each
[44:26] decision that she makes, Lord. Yes.
[44:28] Amen. And I know that she'll be careful
[44:30] to give you the praise. Lord, and Lord,
[44:33] we'll gladly stand with her. And
[44:35] tonight, we just want to remember each
[44:36] and every request made known unto you by
[44:39] the way of an uplift hand. Father, maybe
[44:40] just even an uplift heart. Father, we
[44:43] know there's many needs in our midst,
[44:45] Lord. Even unspoken requests. We know
[44:47] that you are more than able, Father. We
[44:49] know that the more complex the problem,
[44:53] the more you are able to deliver us. So,
[44:58] Father, we just thank you for meeting
[44:59] each and every need according to your
[45:01] riches and glory in Christ Jesus. We
[45:03] just ask now as we turn to the word, the
[45:06] highest order of the service, that you
[45:08] would have the preeminence, Lord, that
[45:10] you would speak to us, Father. Lord,
[45:12] that there would be something of
[45:13] encouragement for your children tonight.
[45:16] We just ask all these things in Jesus
[45:18] Christ's name we pray.
[45:20] Amen. Amen. Thank you, musicians. Thank
[45:24] you, brother Daniel, for taking the song
[45:26] service tonight. Certainly wonderful to
[45:30] be in his presence. Amen. God bless you,
[45:32] brother Olu and Sister FY. It's good to
[45:34] see you back after contending with
[45:37] illness. And we're certainly thankful
[45:39] for the healing touch of the Lord. You
[45:41] turn with me in your Bibles again
[45:42] tonight over to Second Peter. We'll
[45:44] continue on with our discussion on
[45:47] election and how some can be chosen and
[45:51] some can be uh not chosen. Some chosen
[45:55] to be uh to be with Christ in in glory.
[46:00] Some chosen to be blessed and some
[46:02] chosen to be destroyed and to be
[46:06] damned. It's beyond our human
[46:08] comprehension as we have read. But you
[46:11] know tonight I'm just for time's sake
[46:14] I'm just going to read one verse out of
[46:17] second
[46:18] Peter. Second Peter chapter 1 verse
[46:23] 10 says wherefore the rather brethren
[46:27] give diligence to make your calling and
[46:31] election sure. Amen. For if you do these
[46:34] things ye shall never fall. Amen. Let's
[46:37] just bow one more time. Heavenly Father,
[46:39] we're just desiring tonight, Lord, to
[46:42] diligently make our own calling and
[46:44] election sure. And that's why we've
[46:47] gathered together tonight in your name,
[46:49] Lord. Amen. Many tired from working.
[46:52] Many tired from the the trials and
[46:55] tribulations of this life, Lord Jesus.
[46:57] But, Father, we've come to sit at your
[46:59] feet tonight one more time to hear the
[47:02] words of life. Amen. So, Father, we just
[47:04] invite you to speak to us, Lord Jesus.
[47:08] In the name of Jesus we ask. Amen. God
[47:11] bless you tonight. You may be seated.
[47:15] We are certainly thankful for this uh
[47:17] opportunity again to talk about election
[47:23] knowing that it is beyond our human
[47:25] comprehension. But we simply have to
[47:28] trust by faith that this is our calling.
[47:32] And uh you know for someone that might
[47:34] be wondering how do I know whether I'm
[47:37] elected of God or not? I would say do
[47:41] you love the word of God? Are you
[47:44] willing to surrender your life entirely
[47:47] to the word of God? And not just to the
[47:49] word of God per se in in a book form,
[47:51] you know, and maybe the King James
[47:53] version or the the New King James
[47:55] Version or the New International Version
[47:57] of Not just in the Bible, but and I'm
[47:59] not trying to belittle the Bible. But
[48:01] what I am saying is the magnification of
[48:03] the Bible through the message of the
[48:05] hour. Are we willing to humble ourselves
[48:08] in the sight of the Lord to that word?
[48:11] Are we willing to listen to the
[48:13] prophetic utterance that was given to
[48:15] this age? And you know if we are willing
[48:18] to humble ourselves in the sight of the
[48:20] Lord to the word and we are willing to
[48:23] submit ourselves and subject ourselves
[48:25] to this word then it shows in the life
[48:28] that we live. But if we live a life
[48:31] whereby we say that we claim the message
[48:34] of the hour and we say that we claim the
[48:36] entirety of the Bible, but yet we don't
[48:38] live a congruent life outside of our
[48:41] testimony, there's something wrong. And
[48:44] I think it's amazing because the truly
[48:46] elected will always always correct to
[48:50] the word of God. They will not deviate.
[48:53] They will not try and make excuses. They
[48:56] won't say, "This is the way we've been
[48:58] taught. this is the tradition. It's just
[49:00] where I find myself so I can't do
[49:02] anything about it. No, we will always
[49:05] humble ourselves in the sight of the
[49:07] Lord and that is to the word for our
[49:10] day. And we know that brother Brandham
[49:11] said that is truly the evidence of the
[49:12] Holy Ghost. He said at one time he had a
[49:14] conversation with brother Lee Vale the
[49:17] teacher and we know he was a tremendous
[49:19] teacher. He was probably the teacher for
[49:22] the age but the teacher does not usurp
[49:25] the authority of the vindicated prophet.
[49:27] Amen. That's not the way it works. The
[49:30] prophet is the highest order of the age.
[49:32] But brother Brandham said that he was
[49:34] having the conversation with brother
[49:35] Vale who was a theologian and he he
[49:37] said, "You know, brother Veil, what did
[49:39] you think? What do you think the the
[49:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost is? What what
[49:42] do you think that really is?" And they
[49:45] sort of talked back and forth. And
[49:46] Brother Brandham said, "Once upon a
[49:48] time," I said, "Well, it's it's true
[49:50] love. It it's it's the capstone
[49:52] ministry. It's love." And he said, you
[49:55] know, we went with that and we talked
[49:56] about it that way and we went forwards.
[49:58] But he said, it wasn't very long after
[49:59] that that God came and corrected that in
[50:02] my life. God came and corrected me, the
[50:05] vindicated prophet, and told me that
[50:07] it's not just love, that it's truly the
[50:10] ability to receive the word for your
[50:13] day.
[50:15] So, I I want to say this. I think it's
[50:17] so important. We can get a medication in
[50:20] a bottle. We can be given a prescription
[50:23] and uh prescribed by the doctor and and
[50:26] have an illness in our life and we can
[50:28] get that prescription but if we don't
[50:29] actually take it, if we don't take it
[50:32] and then consume
[50:34] it, what good is that medication going
[50:37] to do us? We can say all day long, I got
[50:40] the medication. It's right here. Look at
[50:42] my medication. You need some, too. You
[50:45] should get some medication. Right? But
[50:47] if we're not willing to drink it
[50:48] ourselves, what good is it? People don't
[50:51] want to actually take medication that
[50:53] we're not going to take
[50:55] ourselves. My but we know that the
[50:58] elected will. And I think this this
[51:00] scripture is so good. You know,
[51:02] wherefore the rather brethren give
[51:04] diligence to make your calling in
[51:06] election sure. When we can make our
[51:08] calling in election sure, then we can
[51:10] help others. It's kind of like in the
[51:12] airplane, you know, they say before you
[51:14] try and help other people, should the
[51:16] masks, in the unlikely event the oxygen
[51:18] masks fall from the ceiling, don't try
[51:21] and deal with other people, put your
[51:23] mask on first because if you can't
[51:25] breathe, you're not going to be able to
[51:27] help anybody. We need to make sure that
[51:29] we're taking this and making our own
[51:32] diligently making our own calling and
[51:35] election sure. Because if we do these
[51:37] things that were preceded in this
[51:40] scripture, uh we didn't read them
[51:41] tonight for the sake of time because I
[51:43] feel like I want to talk tonight, but um
[51:45] if you're not sure, just go back and
[51:47] read them maybe later on. Uh it's
[51:49] wonderful thing. We know it's the
[51:50] stature of the perfect man. And I want
[51:52] to say this that I think it's important
[51:54] to remember that we're not just going to
[51:56] take steps of faith. We're going to get
[51:57] one and then we're going to get the
[51:58] other. We're going to get the other.
[51:59] We're going to get the other. It's not
[52:00] the way it works. Even though we see it
[52:02] in a pyramid and it looks like stairs,
[52:04] steps. We're going to step our way up to
[52:07] perfection. What's going to happen is
[52:09] we're going to think that we're doing
[52:10] some kind of works and someday we're
[52:13] going to achieve something. We're not
[52:15] going to achieve nothing. The only thing
[52:17] that we're going to do is be able to
[52:18] receive the word for our day and that
[52:20] will be get the Holy Ghost in our life.
[52:22] And when that happens, we're going to
[52:23] have all the fruit of the spirit and
[52:25] we'll have all of these virtues in our
[52:27] life. And if we are willing to
[52:29] diligently make sure that we're checking
[52:31] that up with the word for our day, then
[52:33] we will truly make sure that we will
[52:36] never fall. And that's a beautiful thing
[52:38] because the truly elected can never
[52:40] fall. God cannot lose a part of himself
[52:43] and remain God. It just won't work. you
[52:47] know, uh, talking about this this
[52:49] election, I think it's so beautiful and
[52:51] and the power of election, the power of
[52:54] predestination, the power of really
[52:57] being able to truly get the baptism of
[52:59] the Holy Ghost in our life. You know,
[53:01] brother Bradom in uh, Broken Sistns in
[53:04] 1964, this is just sort of for fun, but
[53:07] I just felt so impressed today as I was
[53:09] listening to it and and just meditating
[53:11] on the things of the Lord. You know,
[53:12] Brother Brand, I he talks about this one
[53:14] thing in there. you that the man he
[53:17] talks to the man who is a smoker who
[53:19] just cannot seem to shake this smoking
[53:21] thing and I just couldn't help by the
[53:23] way brother Bradom goes through this and
[53:24] if you know the story you know what I'm
[53:26] talking about but if you don't know the
[53:28] story it's well worth listening to
[53:29] brother Brandham he he says that the man
[53:33] who says I I want to get the Holy Ghost
[53:35] and I want to take the steps for God but
[53:37] I just have to shake this smoking I just
[53:39] can't do it until I get past this
[53:42] smoking brother Brandham says Stop
[53:45] thinking about smoking and think about
[53:48] God. Think about the baptism of the Holy
[53:51] Ghost. And I want to say this tonight,
[53:53] brothers and sisters, whatever that
[53:55] thing is, stop thinking about it because
[53:58] it doesn't matter what it is. It's a
[54:00] trap of the devil to try and distract us
[54:02] from who we really
[54:04] are. But he says in that message, "Stop
[54:07] thinking about that thing." And and he
[54:09] goes on and has more conversation with
[54:10] him. and and and the guy says, "But but
[54:13] but but the smoking." And brother
[54:15] Brandham says, "There you go. You're
[54:16] mentioning it again. Stop talking about
[54:18] that
[54:19] smoking." And he says, "You know, it
[54:21] wasn't very long after he he actually
[54:23] listened to me. He stopped talking about
[54:25] it and he truly got the baptism of the
[54:27] Holy Ghost." And he said, "To prove that
[54:29] he's truly got the baptism of the Holy
[54:31] Ghost, I'm going to buy him a carton of
[54:33] cigarettes." Brother Brham, the prophet
[54:35] for our day said that. I'm going to buy
[54:37] him a carton of cigarettes and I'm going
[54:38] to take them and give them to him. and
[54:40] you watch. He will not want one of
[54:43] them. Truly get the baptism of the Holy
[54:46] Ghost. Brothers and sisters, it doesn't
[54:47] matter what it is in our life. It has to
[54:49] go. It has to go.
[54:53] We've been talking about the uh election
[54:56] out of the exposition of the seven
[54:58] church ages of the Samriian church age.
[55:01] For the sake of time tonight, I am just
[55:04] going to jump ahead. I'm not going to go
[55:07] all the way ahead,
[55:09] but I'm just going to start with this
[55:11] part here. He may commit you to death as
[55:14] he did Paul. You know, if he commits us
[55:17] to death, it's only this flesh that he's
[55:20] committing to death, right? The truly
[55:22] elected can never
[55:24] die. If we actually in this flesh, if
[55:27] this tabernacle be dissolved, then we
[55:30] already have a body waiting for us. So
[55:33] when he says this, if he he might commit
[55:35] you to death as he did Paul, he's only
[55:36] going to change our dwelling place.
[55:38] That's the only thing he's going to do.
[55:39] He's going to move us. We're going to
[55:40] change locations. And there's so many
[55:42] people in here that know all about
[55:44] changing locations, about going from one
[55:47] country to another country, having a
[55:48] totally different culture shock. Imagine
[55:51] what the culture shock is like in
[55:53] heaven, in paradise, to come from this
[55:56] pig pen that we live in with all these
[55:58] different pestous to go to absolute
[56:00] perfection. It's just amazing to think.
[56:03] But that's the only thing that's going
[56:04] to happen, brothers and sisters. If he
[56:06] commits us to death, as he did Paul, he
[56:09] commit he may commit you to suffering as
[56:12] he did Job. That's his prerogative.
[56:15] That's God's
[56:16] prerogative. He's
[56:18] sovereign, but it is all with a purpose
[56:22] and and it's his purpose. If he did not
[56:25] have a purpose, then he would be the
[56:27] author of frustration and not of peace.
[56:31] But we know the word says that he is our
[56:33] peace and he hath broken down the middle
[56:36] wall of partition. Right? His purpose is
[56:39] that after we have suffered a while, we
[56:42] would be made perfect, be established,
[56:44] strengthened, and settled. And remember,
[56:46] it's not very long ago we were talking
[56:47] about how he's looking for his image in
[56:50] the masterpiece. And there's coming a
[56:52] time where he will see his image.
[56:55] There's no two ways about that. In the
[56:57] truly elected, he will see his image.
[57:00] And I I just want to say it again. I
[57:02] think we have to over and over again to
[57:04] remind ourselves he's not going to see
[57:06] our his image in this flesh. We're not
[57:08] going to grow a beard and and all of a
[57:10] sudden he'll see himself in our beard.
[57:13] We're not going to grow taller. We're
[57:14] not going to get skinnier. We're not
[57:16] going to become different in this flesh.
[57:18] What we're going to do is have a
[57:19] different character. We're going to have
[57:20] a Christlike character. Where we once
[57:22] had a buzzsaw temper, we're going to be
[57:25] kind and soft.
[57:28] where we once had the desire to come out
[57:30] on top in every single business deal and
[57:32] it didn't matter who I step on and how I
[57:34] get there. We'll say, "You know what?
[57:37] It's God's money. I'm not worried about
[57:39] it. He is the one that provides all my
[57:42] needs."
[57:45] the ones who maybe are jealous or
[57:47] insecure or whatever it is in our life
[57:50] in this flesh that we deal with. It's
[57:52] our spirits that are going to change,
[57:53] brothers and sisters, that are going to
[57:55] come subject to his spirit. That's
[57:58] what's going to happen. That's the
[57:59] character that he's looking for. Not for
[58:02] us to be, you know, partly us and partly
[58:05] him. It's going to be all him.
[58:10] I just I just thought of this, you know,
[58:11] as we were studying this. Just think of
[58:13] this. If his love is
[58:15] elective, we have been chosen to
[58:18] salvation. We haven't actually just
[58:20] stumbled into salvation. We weren't just
[58:23] led to salvation even by our parents,
[58:25] even though we were many times. We we we
[58:29] don't just happen across salvation one
[58:32] day. We've been chosen. We have been
[58:35] chosen unto salvation. We have been
[58:38] given this position before the
[58:40] foundation of the world. So, it just
[58:41] makes me think, you know, we ought to
[58:43] probably forget about all the struggles
[58:44] that are in our minds. Whatever it is
[58:47] that we're contending with because we
[58:48] all are contending with something. And
[58:49] if you're not, brace yourself because
[58:51] you will be. The devil has a punch
[58:54] coming to every single person,
[58:56] especially the elected. But it's not to
[58:58] destroy us. It's so that we can overcome
[59:00] it. So that we can have something to
[59:02] overcome. Because only those who
[59:04] overcome will sit with him in his throne
[59:06] of judgment. Not those who claim to be
[59:09] elected and a part of the message. No,
[59:11] the life that's lived in those people
[59:14] are the ones who will actually display
[59:17] that image. But to forget all the
[59:19] struggles in our minds and just be able
[59:22] to get into Christ to have the peace
[59:24] that passes all understanding and and to
[59:27] remember that his love is elective.
[59:29] We're dealing with elective love here.
[59:31] It's not love the way that we think it.
[59:33] It's not it's not felioial love. It's
[59:35] not the feelings that we have. It's not
[59:37] because somebody did something for me. I
[59:39] just love them more. They're so kind and
[59:42] I just love that person. I just love my
[59:44] wife more. I just love the child more. I
[59:47] love the parents more. It's not like
[59:49] that. He loved us before he even created
[59:52] us.
[59:54] And you know, I just can't help but
[59:56] think this goes right back. This is so
[59:57] good. It goes right back to Ephesians
[59:59] chapter 5, doesn't it? No man ever yet
[1:00:03] hated his flesh, did he? God doesn't
[1:00:07] hate a part of him. And we know that,
[1:00:10] Brother Bam said it one time, you can't
[1:00:11] tell your pinky finger, I just don't
[1:00:12] like you. You stink. You need to go.
[1:00:15] Every single part of the body is
[1:00:17] required. And every single part of the
[1:00:19] body will be there. It won't be someone
[1:00:22] in and and suddenly tragically someone
[1:00:25] will be out. These are all things that
[1:00:27] will happen according to according to
[1:00:30] election.
[1:00:31] But his love is elective and it doesn't
[1:00:34] give us the liberty or the opportunity
[1:00:36] to make grace a disgrace and say that
[1:00:37] because he chose me in him before the
[1:00:39] foundation of the world. I can just go
[1:00:40] out and get liquored and still come to
[1:00:41] church and everything will be just fine.
[1:00:43] I can mistreat my wife and everything
[1:00:45] will be just fine. I can do this, I can
[1:00:47] do that, I can do the other and
[1:00:48] everything will be just fine. Well, it
[1:00:49] won't be just fine because if you're
[1:00:52] truly elected, you won't do that. You
[1:00:55] won't do that.
[1:00:58] But I'll say this also. There comes a
[1:01:00] time in our life where we
[1:01:02] mature. You know, Paul said it. When I
[1:01:05] was a child, I spake as a child and I
[1:01:08] acted as a child. So, spiritually
[1:01:11] speaking, if we're still doing those
[1:01:13] things, we're still maybe juvenile in
[1:01:16] our scriptural spiritual walks. But that
[1:01:20] doesn't mean that we're not elected.
[1:01:22] That doesn't mean that we're not
[1:01:23] forordained or predestinated to be
[1:01:26] exactly who God called us to be. And it
[1:01:29] doesn't actually give us a license,
[1:01:31] excuse me, a license to go and judge
[1:01:33] people. Sometimes we can do that. We can
[1:01:36] get our noses so high when we walk down
[1:01:38] the street that we'll drown in a
[1:01:40] rainstorm. Brother Brandham says it's
[1:01:42] important to remember that we're all
[1:01:44] called and saved by God. It's it's only
[1:01:47] by his grace that we're saved. Amen.
[1:01:51] But when we we begin to realize this, it
[1:01:53] gives us a clearer view of our
[1:01:57] victories. Our victories in the love
[1:02:00] divine.
[1:02:02] And you know that speaking in tongues,
[1:02:03] that whole script, I'm not going to read
[1:02:06] it tonight. I just mentioned that one
[1:02:07] part in in the service that brother
[1:02:10] Bradom was at. There is a tremendous
[1:02:13] victory in the love divine, brothers and
[1:02:15] sisters. And that is what brother Bradom
[1:02:16] was talking about. The Holy Ghost is
[1:02:18] love. We definitely have love. How will
[1:02:21] the world know that you h have love for
[1:02:22] me is what Jesus said. It's a valid
[1:02:25] statement. I'm not going to dismiss it
[1:02:27] and say, "Nope, there won't be love
[1:02:29] there. We're not going to have the Holy
[1:02:31] Ghost and have hate." That's not the way
[1:02:33] it works. The only thing we'll have
[1:02:35] maybe is hate for sin, but we'll love
[1:02:37] our brother and we'll love our sister.
[1:02:42] Going on and reading here, he says, "As
[1:02:44] Job said, he put strength in us, his
[1:02:47] strength in us." Job
[1:02:50] 23:6b. You see, he himself suffered. He
[1:02:55] learned obedience by the things that he
[1:02:59] suffered. Now, all of this, as I read
[1:03:01] this and talk about it, it sounds pretty
[1:03:03] harsh, and I'm not trying to make anyone
[1:03:06] afraid. What I am hoping that we can do
[1:03:09] is maybe after we stop talking about
[1:03:11] this election is just maybe have a
[1:03:12] little bit of peace to recognize if
[1:03:14] we're elected, he's called us to
[1:03:16] election and he will make sure that we
[1:03:19] make it all the way. We don't have to
[1:03:22] worry about trying to figure it out. We
[1:03:23] just need to surrender unto him. That's
[1:03:26] all we need to
[1:03:28] do. He was actually made perfect by the
[1:03:31] things that he suffered. Hebrews 5:8-9.
[1:03:34] Though he were a son, yet he learned
[1:03:36] obedience by the things which he
[1:03:37] suffered. And being made perfect, he
[1:03:39] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:03:41] unto all them that obey him. In plain
[1:03:45] language, the very character of Jesus
[1:03:48] was perfected by
[1:03:51] suffering. And according to Paul, he has
[1:03:53] left his church a measure of suffering
[1:03:55] that they too by their faith in God
[1:03:59] while suffering for him would come to a
[1:04:02] place of
[1:04:05] perfection. Why did he want this? In
[1:04:08] James 1:24, "My brethren, count it all
[1:04:10] joy when you fall into diverse
[1:04:11] temptation, knowing this, that the
[1:04:14] trying of your faith workketh
[1:04:16] patience, but let patience have her
[1:04:19] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and
[1:04:23] entire, wanting nothing." How many of us
[1:04:26] are patient here
[1:04:32] tonight? How many of us are impatient
[1:04:34] here tonight?
[1:04:37] A lot more people laughed. I didn't look
[1:04:39] up. I don't want to see hands. But I
[1:04:41] heard a lot more laughter with
[1:04:42] impatience tonight. You know what that
[1:04:44] means is that there's going to be some
[1:04:47] teaching. There's going to be some
[1:04:48] lessons to create patience in our lives.
[1:04:52] Until we get to that place where we have
[1:04:54] patience, we're going to have struggles.
[1:04:57] And that's why we have them, brothers
[1:04:58] and sisters. It's not because we're bad.
[1:05:01] It's not because we need to be slapped
[1:05:03] around to come to the place of love
[1:05:06] where we say, "I love you now because
[1:05:08] you've slapped me enough." There's
[1:05:10] ministries in this world that teach that
[1:05:13] fire and brimstone preaching. Sure
[1:05:15] enough, there is a hell. There is a hell
[1:05:17] to go to. I was having a conversation
[1:05:19] with a brother today and I thought it
[1:05:20] was so good on the on the morning Bible
[1:05:22] study. We were talking about it. brother
[1:05:24] brought up the the story about Paul and
[1:05:25] Barnabas and how the the transition went
[1:05:28] from the teaching to the Jews. The word
[1:05:31] came to the Jews. But then there was a
[1:05:33] time where the word stopped going down
[1:05:36] the line of a wall and turned a corner.
[1:05:39] And that time was when Paul and Barnabas
[1:05:41] waxed bold and said, "You know what?
[1:05:44] Since you judge yourselves unworthily of
[1:05:48] this word, this word now is leaving the
[1:05:51] Jews and going to the Gentiles.
[1:05:54] But not because we judge you unworthy.
[1:05:56] Your actions demonstrate that you judge
[1:05:59] yourself unworthy. And it got me
[1:06:01] thinking in the in the conversation, the
[1:06:03] way it was going, you know, we live in
[1:06:05] an age where the the spirit of revival
[1:06:08] has lifted off the gentile church now
[1:06:11] and it's going back to Israel. Whether
[1:06:14] we want it or not, whether we can see it
[1:06:15] or not, whether we understand that or
[1:06:17] not, it's happening.
[1:06:19] And I can't help but think, should we
[1:06:22] are we is that is that the way we're
[1:06:24] preaching now? that you know what since
[1:06:27] certain people in this message judge
[1:06:30] themselves unworthy of this
[1:06:33] gospel now this word is going back to
[1:06:36] the
[1:06:37] Jews. What a time we live
[1:06:40] in. Let us not judge ourselves to be
[1:06:42] unworthy of this gospel is what I'm
[1:06:44] getting at. I think it's so amazing
[1:06:46] where we are. The day in which we
[1:06:51] live. Why does he stand by? The reason
[1:06:53] is in Romans 8:17 to18. And if children,
[1:06:56] then heirs, heirs of God and joint hes
[1:06:58] with
[1:06:59] Christ. If so be that we suffer with
[1:07:02] him, that we may be also glorified
[1:07:04] together. For I reckon that the
[1:07:07] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:07:09] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:07:12] which shall be revealed in
[1:07:14] us. And to think about how people
[1:07:16] suffer. We suffer in this world.
[1:07:21] We
[1:07:22] suffer. It is not easy. But fortunately,
[1:07:26] the word says that he will not give us
[1:07:28] more than we can
[1:07:31] bear. But he says here, unless we suffer
[1:07:33] with him, we cannot reign with him. You
[1:07:36] have to suffer to reign. I say Lord have
[1:07:40] mercy. Help us, Lord Jesus, to have that
[1:07:44] Garden of Gethsemane experience where
[1:07:47] even though our friends won't pray with
[1:07:49] us, where we can just take a few steps
[1:07:52] further and fall on our knees and say,
[1:07:55] "Lord, not my will, but let thy will be
[1:07:58] done in my life and push aside as we
[1:08:01] sang that song, all of my hopes, all of
[1:08:05] my dreams. Lay an ashes at my feet. be
[1:08:10] willing to just let it all go so that we
[1:08:13] can show him where we
[1:08:16] stand. Now, I would never say that we
[1:08:18] should do that and sacrifice our
[1:08:20] families. I remember hearing a brother
[1:08:22] say that that I wouldn't be afraid to
[1:08:24] live in my car again. Well, I I don't
[1:08:26] know. I would be afraid to take my
[1:08:28] family and go and live in a car. They
[1:08:29] don't deserve
[1:08:30] that. We know that. that brother
[1:08:32] Brandham even when he preached here in
[1:08:34] Calgary the he the people here heard
[1:08:36] that they were living in a clapboard
[1:08:37] shingled house that was leaking air and
[1:08:40] so they bought him a house because it's
[1:08:42] not right. We don't want to do that to
[1:08:44] our families. We need to look after our
[1:08:46] families. In fact, the word of God says
[1:08:48] that if we don't look after our
[1:08:49] families, we're worse than an infidel.
[1:08:51] That means we don't even believe this
[1:08:52] message.
[1:08:54] But unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[1:08:56] reign with him. You have to suffer to
[1:08:59] reign. The reason for this is that
[1:09:01] character simply is never made without
[1:09:05] suffering. And you know that's how it
[1:09:07] is. If you talk to entitled people today
[1:09:09] that have never gone through anything in
[1:09:11] their life, they've never experienced
[1:09:12] any hardships. My goodness, the level of
[1:09:15] character is about that deep, right? But
[1:09:18] you talk to someone who's gone through
[1:09:20] it, who's lost people. People's lives
[1:09:23] have been lost. They've gone through
[1:09:25] tremendous sicknesses. Maybe they're an
[1:09:28] amputee. Maybe they've had terrible
[1:09:31] accidents. They've seen some stuff in
[1:09:33] their life,
[1:09:35] tragedy. Their character is beyond
[1:09:39] compare. There's something about them
[1:09:41] how they take the time to relate to
[1:09:44] people in this world. Character is a
[1:09:47] victory. It is not a gift. I'm so
[1:09:50] thankful for that.
[1:09:53] It's not something that's easy. It's not
[1:09:55] something that's pleasing to think,
[1:09:57] "Lord, could I please have a trial? I
[1:10:00] need a trial because I need some more
[1:10:01] character. I I want some more victory in
[1:10:04] my life." I don't think anybody prays,
[1:10:05] "Lord, pour out the
[1:10:07] trial." They already come.
[1:10:12] But when we're in the midst of the
[1:10:14] trial, you know, brothers and sisters,
[1:10:15] we can have the ability, which I believe
[1:10:18] other people don't
[1:10:19] have, to close our eyes and open our
[1:10:23] hearts and open our souls and give
[1:10:26] praise like no other people in this
[1:10:29] world. The truly elected know how to
[1:10:33] worship. And worshiping isn't when we're
[1:10:35] on top of the mountains, when we're at
[1:10:38] our very best, when everything is
[1:10:40] happening so good. It's when we're in
[1:10:42] the deepest, darkest valleys that we can
[1:10:45] come to church still and thank the Lord
[1:10:48] for calling us by name.
[1:10:51] That is worship, brothers and sisters.
[1:10:54] Character is a victory, not a gift. A
[1:10:59] man without character can't
[1:11:01] reign because power apart from character
[1:11:04] is
[1:11:05] satanic. And if we think about that
[1:11:07] phrase for a second there, look at the
[1:11:09] devil. Look at Lucifer. He has power,
[1:11:13] but he ain't got character. He's got no
[1:11:14] character.
[1:11:16] He has so little character. There's a
[1:11:18] scripture that pertains to him that I
[1:11:20] think he just hates to hear. And I love
[1:11:21] to say there's coming a time where we're
[1:11:23] going to walk past him and look upon him
[1:11:26] narrowly and say, "That's you. You're
[1:11:29] the one that troubled the
[1:11:31] nations. You look at you."
[1:11:36] H no
[1:11:39] character. But unfortunately, this is
[1:11:41] his world and he is declared officially
[1:11:44] the god of this evil age.
[1:11:47] But that's why we're not of this world
[1:11:49] even though we're in this world.
[1:11:54] Goes on to say, "But power with
[1:11:57] character is fit to rule." And since he
[1:12:00] wants us to share even his
[1:12:03] throne on the same basis that he
[1:12:06] overcame and is sat down in his father's
[1:12:08] throne, then we have to overcome to sit
[1:12:11] with him. And you know, brothers and
[1:12:13] sisters, don't think that we're going to
[1:12:15] necessarily go and have a special place
[1:12:19] created in the throne of God to sit with
[1:12:22] him and look down on everyone as
[1:12:25] rulers. But we will sit with him in
[1:12:28] authority and power. And the word says
[1:12:31] in his throne and that is in his
[1:12:34] stature. That is in his power, in his
[1:12:37] authority. That's where we'll be. It's
[1:12:39] not a geographical location per se, even
[1:12:42] though it could be. We might all be
[1:12:44] there in our soul and and and the new
[1:12:47] theophony body. I I'm not really too
[1:12:50] interested to try and say that. But what
[1:12:51] I am interested in is to recognize the
[1:12:54] authority and the power by that
[1:12:57] character. Even as he is sat down in his
[1:12:59] father's throne, then we have to
[1:13:01] overcome to sit with him. And the
[1:13:04] little, thank goodness, temporary
[1:13:07] suffering that we go through now. Many
[1:13:09] of the suffering that we go through now,
[1:13:11] it is not little. It is tremendous. And
[1:13:16] I know
[1:13:17] that. But it's temporary. Fortunately,
[1:13:20] it's temporary. And I think personally
[1:13:22] when we look at this stuff, we have to
[1:13:24] remember that it's temporary. It's only
[1:13:26] going to be temporary until we change
[1:13:28] our dwelling place one way or the other.
[1:13:31] The little temporary suffering we go
[1:13:32] through now is not worthy to be compared
[1:13:35] to the tremendous glory that will be
[1:13:37] revealed in us when he comes. Oh, what
[1:13:41] treasures are laid up for those who are
[1:13:42] willing to enter into his kingdom
[1:13:44] through much
[1:13:46] tribulation.
[1:13:49] My, think it not strange concerning the
[1:13:52] fiery trials that are to try you.
[1:13:57] Because those fiery trials, brothers and
[1:13:59] sisters, are not to give us a flat tire
[1:14:01] on the side of the road. They're not to
[1:14:03] drain our bank account because someone
[1:14:05] ripped us off. They're not to lose our
[1:14:08] job. It's not about the struggles of
[1:14:10] this life. They're about stealing our
[1:14:13] faith. Can our faith be rocked? Can our
[1:14:16] faith be taken and shaken? And you know,
[1:14:21] the further we go and the more trials we
[1:14:23] have, the stronger we get. As they say
[1:14:25] in the world, no pain, no gain.
[1:14:30] We're not going to get strong without
[1:14:32] exercise. We're not going to get
[1:14:34] character without pain.
[1:14:36] Think it not strange concerning the fire
[1:14:38] trials that are to try you. That is what
[1:14:40] Peter said. It is. Is it strange that
[1:14:43] God wants us to develop a Christlike
[1:14:45] character that comes through suffering?
[1:14:47] No, sir. And we all have trials. We are
[1:14:50] all tried and chasened as sons.
[1:14:54] Not one but goes through that. The
[1:14:57] church that is not suffering and is not
[1:15:01] being
[1:15:02] tried hasn't got
[1:15:05] it. It isn't of
[1:15:08] God. That to me is a shocking
[1:15:12] statement. Hebrews 12 6 and 8. For whom
[1:15:17] the Lord loveth, he chastineth and
[1:15:19] scorgeth every son whom he receiveth.
[1:15:24] But if ye be without chastisement,
[1:15:26] whereof all are partakers, then are ye
[1:15:30] bastards and not sons. They have no
[1:15:33] father, have no
[1:15:35] character. Now this special condition in
[1:15:38] Smyrna must be applied to every
[1:15:41] age. That is profound when we hear
[1:15:47] that it must be applied to every age.
[1:15:50] There is no age free from it. There is
[1:15:52] no true believer free from it. This is
[1:15:55] of God. This is the will of God. It is
[1:15:58] needful. We need the Lord to teach us
[1:16:01] the truth that we are to suffer and be
[1:16:05] Christlike in doing it. Who wants to be
[1:16:09] Christlike in
[1:16:11] suffering? Humanly speaking, that is
[1:16:14] hard. That is not
[1:16:17] easy. Love suffereth long and is kind.
[1:16:20] Matthew 5:11-12, "Blessed are ye when
[1:16:24] men shall revile you, and persecute you,
[1:16:28] and shall say all manner of evil against
[1:16:30] you falsely for my
[1:16:32] sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for
[1:16:36] great is your reward in heaven, for so
[1:16:38] persecuted they the prophets, which were
[1:16:40] before you."
[1:16:43] The cloudy skies and storms of
[1:16:46] life are no signs of God's
[1:16:50] disapproval. I'm so thankful for that
[1:16:53] because the cloudy skies, they really
[1:16:55] affect me in my mind, in my spirit. The
[1:16:59] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[1:17:01] signs of God's disapproval. Neither are
[1:17:04] bright skies and still waters, big fat
[1:17:07] bank accounts, great tremendous jobs and
[1:17:09] contracts. Neither are bright skies and
[1:17:12] still waters signs of his love and
[1:17:14] approval. His approval of any of us is
[1:17:18] only in the beloved.
[1:17:21] Look at the
[1:17:23] sacrifice, not our shortcomings. Stop
[1:17:26] talking about that smoking. Stop talking
[1:17:29] about that drinking. Stop talking about
[1:17:31] that temper. Stop talking about that
[1:17:33] generational sin. Stop talking about all
[1:17:35] the different things that could be
[1:17:37] coming up in our lives and we just make
[1:17:39] excuses for. Stop talking about it and
[1:17:42] start looking at the sacrifice, not our
[1:17:44] shortcomings. His love is elective which
[1:17:48] he had for us before the foundation of
[1:17:50] the world. Isn't that beautiful? When
[1:17:52] the devil comes around and tries to trip
[1:17:53] us up, read that to him. Say that to
[1:17:56] him. His love is elective. He chose me
[1:17:58] in him before the foundation of the
[1:18:00] world to be at his side as his bride.
[1:18:03] that position that you wanted Satan, you
[1:18:05] can never have it because he never chose
[1:18:07] you to have it. But he chose a few
[1:18:10] individuals to have it out of every
[1:18:12] single church age. And those ones that
[1:18:14] say amen to that, they're the ones. His
[1:18:17] love is elective, which he had for us
[1:18:19] before the foundation of the world. Does
[1:18:21] he love us? Ah, yes. But how shall we
[1:18:24] know? We shall know because he said so
[1:18:28] and manifested that he did love us. For
[1:18:30] he brought us to
[1:18:32] himself. We never found him. We never
[1:18:35] just groped in darkness and stumbled
[1:18:36] into the little mission on the corner
[1:18:38] and got saved. No way. He brought us to
[1:18:42] himself and gave us of his spirit,
[1:18:45] placing us as
[1:18:47] sons. What a tremendous thought that
[1:18:50] is. Man, when we get together and have
[1:18:53] church here, what are we doing?
[1:18:56] One day we're going to look back and
[1:18:58] think, did we really realize these
[1:19:00] words? What it meant to be chosen, to be
[1:19:04] placed as a son, brothers and sisters,
[1:19:07] we're already seated in heavenly places.
[1:19:10] Already there. The devil's going to do
[1:19:12] everything to say, "No, no, you're
[1:19:14] not. Can't you tell? You're still in
[1:19:17] human flesh. You've got bad breath, man.
[1:19:20] Your feet stink. You've got bad manners.
[1:19:23] Look at all the shortcomings in your
[1:19:24] life." Remember he just said stop
[1:19:25] looking at the shortcomings and look at
[1:19:28] the sacrifice. Look at what Jesus did.
[1:19:30] How he suffered so that we don't have
[1:19:32] to. We have to suffer to live in this
[1:19:35] world but not like he did. Nobody is
[1:19:37] going to suffer like he
[1:19:39] did.
[1:19:41] My I love how he says this a after he
[1:19:44] says that he brought us to himself and
[1:19:46] gave us of his spirit. Just gave it to
[1:19:49] us. We didn't have to buy it. We didn't
[1:19:51] have to work for it. We didn't have to
[1:19:52] do anything except for can I have it
[1:19:54] Lord I just want it please can I have it
[1:19:57] he gave us of his spirit and then placed
[1:19:59] us as sons adopted us took us out and
[1:20:02] said I want all the spirits in this
[1:20:05] universal realm to notice this is my son
[1:20:10] of course you can go and try and tempt
[1:20:12] him he won't fall you'll never get him
[1:20:14] to curse to my face never perfect
[1:20:18] example of it with Job and how shall I
[1:20:21] prove my love to him. I think this is
[1:20:24] beautiful. This is where the rubber
[1:20:25] meets the road, the brass tax as it
[1:20:27] were, by believing what he said and
[1:20:31] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[1:20:33] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[1:20:37] come to pass. When we have a trial, it's
[1:20:40] not because we just stumbled and fell.
[1:20:43] It's because he saw it fit for some
[1:20:47] spirit, some thing to happen and bring
[1:20:50] this situation to pass so that that
[1:20:53] character would be worked out in our
[1:20:55] lives. How shall I prove my love to him?
[1:20:58] By conducting myself with joy amidst the
[1:21:01] trials. My, that's beautiful. I think
[1:21:04] that's beautiful. You know, brothers and
[1:21:06] sisters, if you've never done it, when
[1:21:07] you have a big fat trial, when you have
[1:21:09] something that's broken your heart and
[1:21:10] you're really hurting and you're
[1:21:11] frustrated and you're just don't know
[1:21:13] what to do, you're confused, everything
[1:21:14] is upside down in your life, just
[1:21:16] worship. Just that song that we sing,
[1:21:19] just worship. Just try and change the
[1:21:21] situation. See if it doesn't change. I
[1:21:24] guarantee you, you will take the
[1:21:26] situation and turn it upside down right
[1:21:28] on its head if you start worshiping. But
[1:21:31] if we get caught up in the moment and
[1:21:32] start slandering that person and talking
[1:21:35] bad about it and moaning and groaning
[1:21:37] and lamenting, he's going to say, "My,
[1:21:40] that box car is a little bit loose.
[1:21:42] Unpack it. It's got to be packed again."
[1:21:46] And we'll give it 6 months or a year and
[1:21:48] come back again before we shake it. But
[1:21:51] when we can shake it and show that that
[1:21:53] box car is solid, that it's been packed
[1:21:56] in there properly, guess what happens?
[1:21:58] That token gets applied on the door and
[1:22:01] that box car is sealed till the day of
[1:22:03] its redemption.
[1:22:06] That's where we're living, brothers and
[1:22:08] sisters. That's what we're talking about
[1:22:09] here. Being elected. What it means to be
[1:22:12] elected. Elected means that Satan can't
[1:22:14] even touch you. Satan cannot harm you.
[1:22:18] Nothing can harm you. Not even death
[1:22:21] because you can't die.
[1:22:23] But it's a totally different way to look
[1:22:25] at the world, to look at life. The world
[1:22:27] is set up to think that we have to
[1:22:29] preserve our lives and we should
[1:22:30] preserve our lives. We don't want to act
[1:22:32] out and tempt the Lord. The word says
[1:22:34] not to tempt the Lord thy God. But to be
[1:22:37] able to worship in the midst of our
[1:22:39] darkest trials, that is next level. That
[1:22:43] is totally
[1:22:45] elite. We heard about the SWAT team and
[1:22:49] and how we have the special weapons and
[1:22:51] training. You know, we have the elite
[1:22:54] elected spiritual sons and daughters of
[1:22:56] God in this age, and the spirits don't
[1:22:59] even know how to contend with them
[1:23:00] because they just worship. Remember,
[1:23:03] there's coming a day where that's all
[1:23:05] we're going to have. Heaven's going to
[1:23:06] be quiet so the redeemed can worship.
[1:23:10] So, so the the elected can have their
[1:23:12] time before the throne to bring the
[1:23:14] praise and honor and glory to the Lord.
[1:23:16] I think that's just amazing, astounding.
[1:23:19] You know, brother Ratom, he talks about
[1:23:20] predestination. Maybe turn over to
[1:23:22] Ephesians 1. Let's turn over to
[1:23:25] Ephesians 1. We got a few minutes here.
[1:23:27] Let's preach. I think this is beautiful.
[1:23:30] Gets me excited talking about this here.
[1:23:33] There's nothing quite like
[1:23:35] it. Nothing quite like the word of
[1:23:40] God. Now, if I could just find
[1:23:44] it. There it is. Ephesians chapter 1
[1:23:48] says it all, brothers and sisters.
[1:23:51] If you were to go through and to read
[1:23:54] Ephesians chapter
[1:23:56] 1, we'll just start with verse four for
[1:23:58] time sake. According as he hath chosen
[1:24:00] us in him, this is Ephesians chapter 1
[1:24:03] verse4. Before the foundation of the
[1:24:06] world, he chose us in him before the
[1:24:09] foundation of the world that we should
[1:24:11] be holy and without blame before him in
[1:24:15] love. So when this word is written, I
[1:24:18] just want to say this tonight as we read
[1:24:20] it. He didn't choose us in him that one
[1:24:23] day we would suddenly stumble into
[1:24:27] holiness and suddenly become without
[1:24:30] blame. He chose us in him to be that.
[1:24:35] That is our description. That's a
[1:24:37] description of us. That is our name. If
[1:24:40] we were to look up the definition of our
[1:24:42] name in heaven, this is what we could
[1:24:44] find. I can't help but think that that
[1:24:46] we should be we're we're before him holy
[1:24:49] and without blame before him in love
[1:24:53] having predestinated us unto the
[1:24:55] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:24:59] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:25:01] of his
[1:25:03] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:25:06] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:25:08] in the beloved. We never made ourselves
[1:25:10] accepted in the beloved. He made us
[1:25:12] acceptable in the beloved, in whom we
[1:25:14] have redemption through his blood, the
[1:25:16] forgiveness of sins. So all of our sins
[1:25:18] are forgiven, brothers and sisters,
[1:25:20] past, present, and
[1:25:21] future. It's not even fair to the devil,
[1:25:24] is it? He chose us to be before him
[1:25:28] blameless. Amen. The forgiveness of sins
[1:25:32] according to the riches of his grace,
[1:25:34] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[1:25:36] all wisdom and prudence, giving us an
[1:25:38] open book in the seventh age in which we
[1:25:41] live and just telling us to eat it
[1:25:44] up, having made known unto us the
[1:25:46] mystery of his will. We're not wondering
[1:25:49] what his will is. We know what his will
[1:25:50] is. according to his good pleasure which
[1:25:53] he hath purposed in himself that in the
[1:25:55] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[1:25:57] might gather together in one all things
[1:26:00] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[1:26:02] which are on the earth even in him that
[1:26:04] is the day in which we live brothers and
[1:26:06] sisters right there in whom we have
[1:26:09] obtained an
[1:26:11] inheritance just
[1:26:15] given every time we open it up the will
[1:26:18] is
[1:26:19] read there's a reading reading of the
[1:26:21] will. And those who are present are able
[1:26:24] to partake of that reading of the will.
[1:26:28] I think it's so beautiful. It's just
[1:26:30] amazing. In whom also we have obtained
[1:26:32] an inheritance, being predestinated
[1:26:34] according to the purpose of him who
[1:26:37] workketh all things after the counsel of
[1:26:41] his own
[1:26:43] will. Predestination looks back to
[1:26:46] fornowledge. For knowledge looks on to
[1:26:50] destiny. I remember hearing of someone
[1:26:53] once upon a time. I probably have said
[1:26:54] this in the past, but it shocked me.
[1:26:57] They believe the Bible and they they
[1:26:59] believe that Jesus died for them and
[1:27:02] they want to serve in the church and so
[1:27:04] on and so forth, but they just don't
[1:27:06] believe in
[1:27:07] predestination. And I thought, how sad.
[1:27:10] How sad. How terribly sad because you're
[1:27:13] missing the entire point of it.
[1:27:17] is not by works of
[1:27:18] righteousness but by his grace
[1:27:21] alone. I think Ephesians chapter 1 when
[1:27:24] we get down brothers and sisters that's
[1:27:26] all we need to do is read that and and
[1:27:29] oh my even get into Ephesians chapter 2
[1:27:32] you hath he quickened who were dead in
[1:27:34] trespasses and sins not not when we were
[1:27:37] in the perfect realms of church when we
[1:27:39] were fully saved and sanctified
[1:27:41] justified sanctified filled with the
[1:27:43] Holy Ghost. No, he came and got us when
[1:27:45] we were dead in sins and
[1:27:47] trespasses. Let's go over to Romans
[1:27:49] chapter nine quickly while we still have
[1:27:52] a few
[1:27:53] minutes. Just a few
[1:28:00] minutes talking about
[1:28:05] election. I say the truth in Christ I
[1:28:07] lie not. my conscience also bearing me
[1:28:10] witness in the Holy
[1:28:11] Ghost that I have great heaviness and
[1:28:14] continual sorrow in my heart. For I
[1:28:17] could wish that myself were a curse from
[1:28:20] Christ for my brethren and kinsmen
[1:28:22] according to the flesh, who are
[1:28:24] Israelites to whom pertainth the
[1:28:27] adoption, and the glory and the
[1:28:29] covenants and the giving of the law and
[1:28:32] the service of God and the
[1:28:35] promises. Whose are the fathers and of
[1:28:38] whom as concerning the flesh Christ came
[1:28:42] who is over all God blessed forever.
[1:28:46] Amen. Not as though the word of God hath
[1:28:50] taken none effect. For they are are not
[1:28:54] all Israel which are of Israel. Neither
[1:28:59] because they are the seed of Abraham are
[1:29:03] they all children. But in Isaac shall
[1:29:08] thy seed be
[1:29:09] called. That is, they which are the
[1:29:12] children of the flesh, these are not the
[1:29:16] children of
[1:29:17] God. But the children of the promise are
[1:29:20] counted for the
[1:29:22] seed. Remember that if we walk not after
[1:29:27] the
[1:29:27] flesh, but after the spirit, we won't be
[1:29:31] tempted.
[1:29:33] But if we walk after the flesh and not
[1:29:35] after the spirit, we're going to have
[1:29:37] problems in our
[1:29:38] life. For this is the word of promise.
[1:29:41] Verse nine, at this time will I come and
[1:29:44] Sarah shall have a
[1:29:47] son. And not only this, but when Rebecca
[1:29:51] also had conceived by one, even our
[1:29:54] father
[1:29:55] Isaac, for the children not being for
[1:29:59] the children being not yet born, neither
[1:30:01] having done any good or evil, that the
[1:30:04] purpose of God according to election
[1:30:06] might
[1:30:07] stand, not of works, but of him that
[1:30:11] calleth. It was said unto her, the elder
[1:30:14] shall serve the younger. As it is
[1:30:15] written,
[1:30:16] Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I
[1:30:21] hated. What shall we say then? Is there
[1:30:24] unrighteousness with
[1:30:27] God? God forbid. For he saith to Moses,
[1:30:31] I will have mercy on whom I will have
[1:30:33] mercy, and I will have compassion on
[1:30:35] whom I will have
[1:30:37] compassion. So then, it is not of him
[1:30:41] that willth, nor of him that runth, but
[1:30:44] of God that showeth
[1:30:48] mercy. If we have been called here
[1:30:50] tonight, it is because God hath shown us
[1:30:54] mercy.
[1:30:58] Excuse me. We have been given every
[1:31:01] single reason to
[1:31:05] worship out of the faith of Abraham in
[1:31:10] 1955. I'm sorry, brother. I don't think
[1:31:12] I sent this to
[1:31:14] you. He
[1:31:16] says,"Abraham, what was it
[1:31:19] now?" God called Abraham because he was
[1:31:22] a good
[1:31:24] man. God called Abraham by election.
[1:31:27] Amen.
[1:31:29] God elects people. And over in the book
[1:31:32] of Ephesians, the first chapter and
[1:31:34] about the fifth verse, Paul states, "The
[1:31:36] word predestinated us to the adoption of
[1:31:41] sons." Now, that doesn't mean that God
[1:31:43] just puts you in a little channel and
[1:31:46] runs you
[1:31:47] through. I think this is so amazing. And
[1:31:50] you can't help it if you how you go when
[1:31:54] you would be no
[1:31:57] reward. But God gives you the free moral
[1:32:01] agency to make your
[1:32:04] choice. But God will keep his
[1:32:09] believer. And predestination is a hard
[1:32:12] word among the congregation of people
[1:32:15] because
[1:32:16] predestination really fornowledge is a
[1:32:19] better word. And predestination looks
[1:32:20] back to fornowledge. And fornowledge
[1:32:22] looks on to destiny. That God being
[1:32:25] infinite in the beginning knew the end
[1:32:28] from the beginning. Therefore, he knew
[1:32:30] what people would do so he could
[1:32:34] foretell what would take place for he
[1:32:37] knew what would be.
[1:32:42] Therefore, before Esau or Jacob, either
[1:32:45] one was born, God could say, "Esau, I've
[1:32:49] hated, and Jacob I've loved." Because he
[1:32:54] forneew what they could
[1:32:57] be. He never made Esau the way he
[1:33:00] was. He wasn't willing that Esau would
[1:33:04] be that way. But Esau by
[1:33:09] choice, God knew would take that
[1:33:13] way. So that's how he knows us today.
[1:33:16] Isn't that beautiful when you think
[1:33:18] about this? He knows who the sinner is
[1:33:20] and and how they're going to go and do
[1:33:22] that. But he also knows who the elected
[1:33:25] are.
[1:33:26] And he creates environments so the
[1:33:29] elected don't get destroyed. so that the
[1:33:31] elected shine, that the elected rise,
[1:33:35] that they grow, so that he can take them
[1:33:37] out and adopt them. He never made Esau
[1:33:40] the way he was. He wasn't willing that
[1:33:41] Esau would be that way. But Esau by
[1:33:44] choice, God knew, would take that way.
[1:33:47] So that's how he knows us today. He
[1:33:49] knows your heart. And you might be able
[1:33:53] to fool your neighbor.
[1:33:55] You might be able to fool your pastor,
[1:34:00] but you'll never fool God
[1:34:04] because he knows your heart.
[1:34:07] I think it's
[1:34:08] beautiful. And you know, I I don't I
[1:34:10] don't jump in there and say, "Yeah,
[1:34:11] you'll never you might be able to fool
[1:34:13] me." No, I I say, "Let that be about
[1:34:15] me."
[1:34:17] I know that there was times where I
[1:34:18] probably tried to fool my
[1:34:21] pastor,
[1:34:23] but I can see that there's a gift of
[1:34:25] discernment there. And you see a whole
[1:34:28] lot more than people think you see. And
[1:34:30] it's just the way it is. But I don't
[1:34:33] want to fool my neighbor. I want my
[1:34:35] neighbor to know that I'm an elected son
[1:34:37] of God. I want them to know that I have
[1:34:41] been predestinated before the foundation
[1:34:42] of the world to be called out and
[1:34:48] adopted. Therefore, he by election, he
[1:34:52] chose Abraham for he knew what Abraham
[1:34:55] would do.
[1:34:57] You remember when he called him out
[1:34:59] there and said he'd not keep the thing a
[1:35:03] secret from
[1:35:04] him when he was going down to destroy
[1:35:07] Sodom and Gomorrah. He said, "For I know
[1:35:09] that Abraham will teach his children. I
[1:35:12] know it. God himself. I know that
[1:35:16] Abraham will send this message on down
[1:35:20] from one to the other generation."
[1:35:23] And isn't it beautiful, brothers and
[1:35:25] sisters, when we read that to think that
[1:35:27] that generation has jumped all the way
[1:35:29] down the generations to where we are
[1:35:31] today because God could trust Abraham.
[1:35:35] We truly are the elected royal seed of
[1:35:38] Abraham
[1:35:40] in the line with Isaac.
[1:35:43] But God for knowing that and knowing
[1:35:46] that Abraham would do it, then he told
[1:35:49] Abraham in the
[1:35:51] beginning that he would save him and
[1:35:55] save his seed after
[1:35:56] him and would give him the unconditional
[1:36:00] covenant that he made with
[1:36:03] Abraham. Not because Abraham was good,
[1:36:06] but because God was
[1:36:10] good. Excuse me.
[1:36:13] because God was good. And remember
[1:36:16] brothers and sisters, he had Abraham had
[1:36:18] such an amazing opportunity to know God
[1:36:23] face to face. How many meetings did he
[1:36:26] have with God? Did God have with him
[1:36:28] rather? How many times did he get to
[1:36:31] have fellowship with God?
[1:36:36] even to the place where God came on the
[1:36:38] plains of memory to his house and and
[1:36:42] entertained him to wash his feet and and
[1:36:45] gave him the opportunity to kill a
[1:36:47] fatted calf. Think about how long that
[1:36:49] would take to go and kill a a fatted
[1:36:50] calf even with all of today's technology
[1:36:53] to kill a fatted calf to butcher it up
[1:36:56] to cook it to knead the bread to bake it
[1:36:59] and to prepare a meal and bring it. How
[1:37:02] much time did he get to spend with
[1:37:04] Elohim? God himself in the flesh. How
[1:37:08] much time did he actually have? How many
[1:37:10] words were spoken? What a tremendous
[1:37:13] thing it is. He had so many
[1:37:15] opportunities with God as as a friend.
[1:37:18] But you know, there came a time after he
[1:37:20] had the promise where God said, "Now,
[1:37:23] you know what, Abraham? I know that that
[1:37:25] that everything has been good and you
[1:37:27] follow me. You've been such a good
[1:37:28] servant and I know that you love me.
[1:37:29] Now, what I want you to do is to bring
[1:37:31] your son up to the mountain and I want
[1:37:33] you to sacrifice him. I want you to kill
[1:37:35] him. I want you to burn him on an altar
[1:37:38] after you slit his throat and let his
[1:37:40] blood run out all over the the rocks and
[1:37:42] the sticks. A and bring me a sacrifice
[1:37:44] just like you would do with a lamb. I
[1:37:46] want you to do with that promised son
[1:37:48] that I gave you. Now, imagine the
[1:37:51] turmoil that must have been in that man
[1:37:53] to think that all the highs he was on
[1:37:55] the mountaintop when he had his son. He
[1:37:58] had the promised son, but yet now God is
[1:38:01] telling him to come and kill it.
[1:38:05] And the beautiful thing about this is
[1:38:07] the point that I want to get to is what
[1:38:09] I always talk about with this is not
[1:38:10] that God said to him, Abraham, when he
[1:38:13] was already, he was fully engaged, his
[1:38:15] son was bound on the
[1:38:18] altar, pulls a knife back, goes to do
[1:38:20] it, God stops him. Abraham, stop.
[1:38:25] Abraham, now I know that you love me.
[1:38:28] But did God suddenly know now that
[1:38:30] Abraham loved him?
[1:38:32] God truly knew that he loved him and
[1:38:34] truly knew that he would listen and he
[1:38:37] truly knew that Abraham needed to know
[1:38:39] how much he really loved God.
[1:38:43] And when we're going through the fiery
[1:38:44] trials, brothers and sisters, don't
[1:38:46] think it's strange because he knows that
[1:38:49] we love him, but he wants us to know how
[1:38:51] much we love him.
[1:38:55] I think it's amazing when we think about
[1:38:57] this. I'll call the musicians as we wind
[1:38:59] down tonight. He told Abraham in the
[1:39:01] beginning that he would save him and
[1:39:03] save his seed after
[1:39:06] him. We know brother Bradom says that he
[1:39:08] knew that God said, "Hey, you would save
[1:39:11] my seed. So if I kill him, you're
[1:39:13] obligated to bring them back up because
[1:39:15] it's your word." What a tremendous thing
[1:39:18] that is. What courage that would take to
[1:39:21] take the natural circumstances and go
[1:39:23] right against the grain. But remember
[1:39:26] that you heard his word. Oh my. You
[1:39:28] heard his word and you know that he
[1:39:30] can't go against his
[1:39:33] word. The unconditional covenant that he
[1:39:36] made with
[1:39:38] Abraham. Excuse
[1:39:41] me. Not because Abraham was good, but
[1:39:45] because God was good. And every believer
[1:39:48] in here is a Christian tonight because
[1:39:52] not that you're
[1:39:54] good, but because God was good to call
[1:39:57] you.
[1:39:59] What a tremendous blessing it is,
[1:40:00] brothers and sisters. I just think it's
[1:40:03] amazing. I've got more, but I'm not
[1:40:06] going to do it. I'm just going to sign
[1:40:08] off and maybe ask you to stand with me
[1:40:11] as we close in prayer
[1:40:15] [Music]
[1:40:21] tonight. Let's just bow in prayer.
[1:40:24] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank
[1:40:26] you for your word. Thank you, Lord
[1:40:28] Jesus, that we can recognize that you've
[1:40:31] called
[1:40:32] us to be adopted sons and daughters.
[1:40:35] Lord, you haven't called us to be a part
[1:40:38] of an
[1:40:39] association. You haven't called us to be
[1:40:41] a part of a family or an
[1:40:44] assembly, but Lord, you've called us to
[1:40:46] be your son, to be your daughter. And
[1:40:50] what a tremendous privilege that is,
[1:40:51] Lord, to know that that's your choice
[1:40:55] and we're just recognizing it. We're
[1:40:58] just starting to realize it. We're just
[1:41:01] starting to grasp it with our finite
[1:41:04] minds here on earth. And Lord Jesus,
[1:41:06] we're so thankful that your word said
[1:41:08] that there comes a point in time where
[1:41:10] we need to stop doing that on our own
[1:41:13] and allow the mind that was in Christ
[1:41:16] Jesus be also in you. And that takes us
[1:41:20] to another realm to another plane.
[1:41:23] Father, we know that takes us and seats
[1:41:26] us with you in heavenly places. I pray
[1:41:28] that Lord tonight your word would
[1:41:31] resound in our heart. Father, that Lord,
[1:41:33] as we go our separate ways, that we
[1:41:35] would recognize, Father, what you've
[1:41:37] done for us and how you've called us,
[1:41:39] Lord Jesus, how you've done it all,
[1:41:41] Father, and we are just the recipients
[1:41:44] of what you've given to us freely.
[1:41:47] Father, we pray that you would just give
[1:41:49] us the strength, Lord, to endure the
[1:41:51] trials as they come up in our lives. We
[1:41:53] know they're many and we know they're
[1:41:55] hard, Lord Jesus.
[1:41:57] We know that, Father, you love us, but
[1:42:01] help us, Lord Jesus, to know how much we
[1:42:04] truly love
[1:42:05] you. We just ask now that you would keep
[1:42:08] your hand upon us as we go our separate
[1:42:10] ways. Be with brother Joe as he takes
[1:42:13] the service on Sunday here, Lord. We
[1:42:15] pray that you would grant to him a fresh
[1:42:17] coal off the altar. And Lord, be with us
[1:42:19] as we're away in Edmonton, Lord,
[1:42:21] ministering also. We love you and we
[1:42:24] thank you. We just ask all these things
[1:42:26] in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:42:30] Amen. Though he knew me, he loved
[1:42:36] me. Oh, he knew
[1:42:41] [Music]
[1:42:43] me yet he
[1:42:46] loved thee.
[1:42:53] He whose
[1:42:56] glory makes the
[1:42:59] heaven
[1:43:05] shine on our own. So
[1:43:13] unworthy of such mercy.
[1:43:23] when
[1:43:24] he was on the
[1:43:30] cross. Oh,
[1:43:32] I was on his
[1:43:38] life. Amen. Sing that verse.
[1:43:44] I'm not
[1:43:46] on an
[1:43:48] ego trip. I'm
[1:43:52] nothing on my own.
[1:43:58] I
[1:43:59] make
[1:44:01] mistakes and often disl
[1:44:06] just call it flesh and
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:12] bone. But I'll prove
[1:44:16] someday just what I
[1:44:21] say.
[1:44:24] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:44:28] when he was on the
[1:44:35] cross. Oh,
[1:44:37] I was on his
[1:44:40] mind. Though he knew me, he still loved
[1:44:44] me.
[1:44:46] Though he
[1:44:48] knew
[1:44:54] me, he
[1:44:56] loved
[1:44:57] [Music]
[1:45:01] me. Oh, he whose
[1:45:05] glory
[1:45:07] makes the
[1:45:09] heaven shine.
[1:45:16] So
[1:45:23] unworthy
[1:45:24] of such mercy.
[1:45:33] When
[1:45:34] he was on the
[1:45:40] cross, I was on his
[1:45:47] mind.
[1:45:51] Amen. A
[1:45:53] look of love was on his face. The thorns
[1:46:01] were on his
[1:46:06] head. The
[1:46:08] blood wrapped down his
[1:46:12] darling
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:23] gold were
[1:46:25] a crowd that day.
[1:46:30] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord
[1:46:33] Jesus. Blessed be your name,
[1:46:37] Lord. You were on the
[1:46:44] cross. Oh,
[1:46:46] I was on your
[1:46:51] mind. Oh, hallelujah. Though you knew
[1:46:54] me, Lord, though you
[1:46:58] knew
[1:47:01] me,
[1:47:03] still you
[1:47:05] love me.
[1:47:13] He whose
[1:47:15] glory makes the
[1:47:19] heaven
[1:47:25] shine. So
[1:47:33] unworthy of such mercy.
[1:47:44] He was on the
[1:47:50] cross. I was on his
[1:47:56] mind. Amen.
[1:47:59] Hallelujah. Blessed be his
[1:48:02] name. Can we sing 1062?
[1:48:06] New
[1:48:12] mercy. Lord, you make your mercy new
[1:48:16] every
[1:48:19] day. You change my life in so many
[1:48:26] ways. You cradle me in your sweet
[1:48:31] grace.
[1:48:33] Lord, you fill
[1:48:39] me
[1:48:42] yesterday, today,
[1:48:44] forever
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:48] more. There's one thing that I know for
[1:48:53] sure.
[1:48:57] Fresh as the
[1:48:59] morning
[1:49:01] dune, you make your mercy
[1:49:06] [Music]
[1:49:10] new every morning.
[1:49:18] Oh,
[1:49:21] I I thought that I had crossed the
[1:49:29] line. Walked away from love one
[1:49:36] time. Too
[1:49:39] many. Too many.
[1:49:42] [Music]
[1:49:50] I thought I'd used up all the
[1:49:58] grace set aside for my mistakes.
[1:50:04] [Music]
[1:50:09] So
[1:50:15] many on my knees.
[1:50:19] I
[1:50:21] found to my
[1:50:30] surprise that your
[1:50:34] mercy
[1:50:35] renews with
[1:50:37] us
[1:50:43] arise. Lord, you make your mercy new
[1:50:49] every
[1:50:50] [Music]
[1:50:52] day. You change my life in so many
[1:51:00] ways. Cradle me in your sweet
[1:51:06] grace. Lord, you fill me.
[1:51:12] [Music]
[1:51:23] There's one thing that I know for
[1:51:30] sure. Fresh as the
[1:51:35] morning, you make your mercy new.
[1:51:45] every
[1:51:51] morning.
[1:51:55] Oh, the wasted times that I have
[1:52:02] known. A prodigal away from home.
[1:52:08] [Music]
[1:52:13] Not
[1:52:20] knowing your
[1:52:24] mercy and grace was
[1:52:28] [Music]
[1:52:35] multiplied with
[1:52:37] for
[1:52:39] his
[1:52:41] will to
[1:52:45] supply. God bless you
[1:53:00] tonight. Heat. Heat.
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:10] [Applause]
[1:53:35] Heat.
[1:53:46] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:56:03] Heat. Heat.
[1:56:06] [Music]
[1:56:25] Heat. Heat.
[1:56:26] [Music]
[1:57:11] Praise you.
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:51] Heat. Heat.
[1:57:54] [Music]
[1:58:26] Thanks to you.
[1:58:32] [Music]
[1:59:29] Hallelujah.
[1:59:34] [Music]
[1:59:45] Heat. Heat.
[1:59:49] [Music]
[2:00:14] Oh, the Lord.
