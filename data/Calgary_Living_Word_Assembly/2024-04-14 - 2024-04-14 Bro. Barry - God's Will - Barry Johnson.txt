and by his strikes we are he that has escaped all the Corruptions of this world having Liv 33 years years and a half not committed one sin that is the one that pictured that cross this morning and then you know according to the Roman Empire woman Lord that time they said you can never be a curse until you are crucified on the cross because of that he carried all my sin all your sin up to a PR that he felt alone and he said father why thou Hast forsaken me that at that point you know why he said this one because there was complete separation between him and his father right now because he was full of sin at that point but to make it complete he said forgive them because they don't know what they do and then can you imagine that cross the the Bible says he was beaten with still it peel with still with still peel it and then can you imagine the blood that was staying on that cross and he was laying down and then they had to nail him by nailing him I can me how the blood poured out

wouldn't leave this building the same way that we came in here father or the way that we tuned into this meeting Lord but father that something would happen today father that your word would change us word cell by word cell father Lord that we would see more of you and less of us yes Lord father this morning we just want to remember these requests that were made known father the the peace in Israel Lord Jesus we know there's great turmoil right now father the the devils are swarming around that country Lord the world is surrounding your people father and we know there is a predestinated 144,000 there oh Lord Jesus even now father we pray that you would just be with them that you would give them strength father that you would give them Supernatural encouragement Lord Jesus we know that your grace is pulling away from the Gentile Church Lord and we know that when it lifts off the Gentile church will leave father oh father but then you will return to your people through the two witnesses

this morning thank you musicians you have your Bibles today I would just like to read from second Timothy chapter 3 two verses verse 11 and 12 second Timothy chapter 3 start with verse 11 persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch and laconium and lestra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me amen yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus Jesus shall suffer persecution let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word maybe just a few words this morning Lord but we know that your word is the same yesterday today and forever that heavens and earth will pass away but these words are the only thing that will remain and father we just ask that you would anoint this word to our hearts Lord father that we would not leave this building the same way that we came but father you would change us Lord Jesus that we would just have a god Consciousness with us everywhere that we go we thank you for the thought today we thank you for your love and your mercy to each and every one of us we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated even though it seems I get emotional I'm certainly happy to be here in the house of the Lord with everyone and I can tell you the reason I get emotional is I just know him and he's here just a few announcements before we get into the word today we have brother Nestor ESP penia uh next weekend April the 20th at 6:00 p.m. and the 21st at 10:00 a.m. that's a Saturday evening service and a sun Monday morning service we have the Men's breakfast scheduled for May 18th it will be at our house and we're trusting it will be a time of encouragement for the Brethren Sunday June the 2nd we have brother Dela ad delodon he's the pastor from Nigeria he's coming here and we're certainly excited to hear what the Lord has placed on his heart I'm certainly thankful to have been a part of the Lethbridge Revival the brothers put together this weekend and we know uh they're in service right now brother Jerry Fury is preaching and then he'll be going back to Spruce Grove and I was there for Friday night uh Brother Don and I drove down and we did the service and then we came home and there was three services yesterday brother Jerry took the morning service brother mvin took the midday service and then brother Jerry took the evening service again as I understand and I thought it was uh just an interesting time to go and fellowship we uh weren't able to have the same facility for all of the services um the first four Services Friday and Saturday Services were in that Alliance Church was it the alliance I think it was the oh the United Okay United Church and uh certainly was an interesting building to see it's definitely a historic site I think it was uh built in about 1912 and uh they say that the left Bridge philarmonic Orchestra plays in that building because of the Acoustics and they got a big big old pipe organ in there and just a really neat building to see just a it's like a it's like a museum but uh they had the services there and Friday night we had the gymnasium Saturday they were able to have the sanctuary which was probably a really B real blessing for everyone I'm sure um I thought it was interesting though we had I think it must have been a Zumba class or something going on in the basement of the gymnasium they had Bas and music it was just obnoxious and you know we prayed while we opened the service and it was what five minutes and that music was off it was over and we were able to go forwards and just bring a word of encouragement to the people in Lethbridge and I just think it's a wonderful thing to see what the Lord is doing there in Lethbridge you know some people have come and some people have gone but there's still a group of people that want to keep their shoulder to the wheel and have church and we know that God is still calling he's bringing people in there's new people there new faces new excitement and you know I just tried to encourage them a little bit with what brother mvin had said last week about how you know sometimes the blessing that happens it's not all about a financial blessing in our lives and it's not all about maybe getting Health in our lives it's not all about having good things necessarily happen for us in our lives but what sometimes happens is the blessing comes to our children and our children's children because we're willing to continue to put our shoulder to the wheel when times get tough when things get sticky we know the God we serve and we're not interested in compromising not one iota for our feelings and what happens is the blessing comes upon our family and comes upon our family's friends and our family's children it's amazing what can happen so I just Tred to encourage the Saints there to just keep the word first and to keep pressing on not not give one bit of compromise not one iota just keep praying for a pastor keep paying a tithe keep giving God something to honor and see if God won't come and actually honor their prayers if he won't honor their faithfulness and that's what I I basically told them we need to have faithfulness in order for God to actually bless us but you know sometimes we can get used to actually coming to God and treating him like he's a vending machine and we can put our tithe in the offering and say I put my tithe there now I expect to see some results there should be something that happens you know that might not happen in your generation it might not even happen in your children's generation but it might be your grandchildren's generation that it happens it's God's timing it was wonderful to be there though and just see the Saints and just encourage them um this morning I want to take a little bit of a different turn we've talked about the Holy Ghost for a long time and I know some people are fed up with it probably and just have heard enough about it and you know I I know that it can seem to be long and and I'll tell you honestly there was a time when I was coming to church I was a a relatively new Christian we were in the upper room still and brother Ken was preaching on Feast of Tabernacles the Feast of booths and I think he did it for about a year just about a year and I remember thinking I can't believe he's still talking about this how much more is there to talk about the Feast of the Tabernacles goodness sakes but you know what the word of God it's never going to pass away amen there's coming a time where we're going to be in the Feast of Tabernacles for eternity so what else is there to talk about we have the word of God and and you know it's an open book and it's just a tremendous thing that we have that opportunity but today I'm not going to go too far into the Holy Ghost you know where I stand with it and uh you know outside of it it there's no hope we can pretend all we want to be Christians but if you don't have the Holy Ghost then you're truly not a Christian because you will not be Christlike without his Spirit living out through you that's just the way it works you know uh in our scripture today verse 11 just just persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch at ionium at Lisa what persecutions I Endure this is Paul speaking here actually Timothy but he's speaking here what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution and it goes on to say in verse 13 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived and you know brothers and sisters just remember that this isn't going to be out there in the in the world in the denominations this is going to be right intertwined with the truth there's people that are ever learning ever learning smart educated people but never ever able to come to the knowledge of the truth why is that because they come right up to that point we've talked about it so many times right there and they're able to taste of that Heavenly gift they're able to be enlightened by by the word of God but they don't ever want to get the Holy Ghost don't ever let me get the Holy Ghost no I can't go that far that's getting crazy I I might get out of control I might actually get out of order but you know what the Lord wants us to do is get out of order he doesn't want us to have a form of godliness and deny his power he wants us to be free in the holy spirit because where the spirit of God is there's what Freedom brothers and sisters to Worship in spirit and in truth not be bound in Chains and say well this is my culture this is the way I was taught this is my tradition all of that stuff that's not anything to do with God the Holy Spirit has no boundaries he's got no country of origin he he's not cultural he has one one behavior and that's his word his attributes are in the word of God but you know all all who live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution thinking about our our study on uh you know the exposition of the seven Church ages on Wednesday and it just really struck my heart as I'm sure it did everyone just thinking about the the request and I apologize because I did forget to mention the local assembly in London this morning and brother Chandler the passing of him a pastor in London it really resonated with me it struck a chord with me it made me remember what it was like to lose our pastor here and and to recognize that God he he will allow us to go through trials and tribulations to shake us up he's not going to let us actually just have a flowery bed of ease walk into heaven that's not going to happen that's not the life of a Believer the life of a Believer is strong and robust and you know one thing I I just am going to say this I probably will regret it later but sometimes you just have to say what the Lord puts on your heart and I think it's an amazing thing and I'm probably going to preach on it someday my wife wife probably knows where I'm going with this but I I since I've come to the message of the hour I have never heard of so many people who have been offended the word offended I I've met many people in the world many many people in many different situations but only around the Church of the Living God have I heard people say they're offended offended offended yeah yeah I get it but that ain't what the prophet of God taught no the prophet of God taught that we're not hot house plants right we're not raised up under protection where if we get one little Cool Breeze or one little bug comes our way it's going to put us out and kill us but yet you hear some of the most vibrant maybe some of the most elder Christian people around the message of the hour get offended help and of what because somebody didn't wear a tie because somebody didn't do something the way that they thought it should be done is it according to the spirit of God according to the word of God or is it according to our thoughts or our theories that's where it is brothers and sisters brother bradam says that Christians should be robust and strong and not easily moved we know that's the word of God we sing that song I shall not be moved amen do we mean it or is something going to come along and just step on our toes and oh man I'm offended now I've got to stay home but I could just stream because I've got a favorite Ministry anyway somewhere they can actually minister to me brothers and sisters that's outside the word of God and what's his will his will is his word and we're going to get into that today but we read this on on Wednesday and I just thought my as we heard about brother Chandler passing and you know it sounds like he he took a heart attack he had a heart attack I had mentioned that he took a fall but they they saw the video inside the church and I think he grabbed his chest and fell over and gave up the G and you know we all have a time appointed of the father where he will actually prune us he will pull our flower from his garden and say it's time for you to go into my bouquet and you know we certainly want to remember the church we want to remember the families all of the church families who will be affected now by the losing of a pastor and how much that will shake things up we know what that will do but you know in the in the in the exposition of the seven Church ages out of the saman church age we read this on Wednesday the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval we can't be looking at the natural circumstances and thinking we're in God's will or we're out of God's Will and today just in case you haven't figured it out or I didn't say it I want to talk about God's will God's will concerning you God's will concerning me the Cloudy sky and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval his love his approval sorry of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so am but how many people here today in this room heard Jesus say I said so I love you I bet not very many people heard a man's voice say I love you but his word said it amen but how shall we know he said so how shall we know because he said so and manifested that that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as Sons gave us of his spirit and placing us as sons and we know that as adoption not just coming to church and actually having a good sermon and going home and having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof but actually going all the way into Christ getting right into the Promised Land looking around and seeing Giants and saying our God is more than able it doesn't matter what I see what I think or what I feel God's word Reigns Supreme how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass oh yes brothers and sisters we're not exempt from trials right Trials of Life are coming around and they're going to prove who we are when times get tough do we scram do we run away or do we actually lean into the problem and say we need to deal with this situation God's word is going to be done in this situation and I guarantee you brothers and sisters whatever our situation today God's will will be done in that situation there's not one of us that can operate outside of his will I think it's such a beautiful thing that excites me because that's the only place I want to be brothers and sisters and I'm sure that's the only place you want to be is in the will of God Amen because when you're in the will of God you know Satan can't touch you you know when I was young I've probably mentioned this in the past but it's just the way I felt led to go today I remember my dad teaching me and I'm so thankful for a dad that took me to church that raised me up in in in the word of God and he did it to the best of his ability and I'm certainly thankful and my dad he taught me one thing that uh two things two things that I I think are really important and and maybe I'll just mention both of them quickly here the first one is about finding the will of God for your life I I heard him tell me that the other thing that he taught me which I think is real important is to be accountable for your actions when you actually do something you've got to be willing to actually say yes indeed I did that and if you can't do that afterwards don't do it but two things that were just sort of life lessons for me and you know I I kind of secretly took this one about the the will of God in my life and I I tried to find the will of God I I wanted to know what that meant for me in my life and and had no way to find out no nowhere to go with it I went to the the church and said if if there's a will for God in my life then maybe the the baptism of the Holy Ghost is it and I went and a got baptized in titles and recognized very quickly that there was really no power there um they had great Services there was a great anointing there and and there was signs and wonders there was stuff that happened but I I still never really experienced it for myself and and there came a time where I thought you know there's really nothing to this and so I went out in the world and I'm not here to give my testimony this morning pertaining to all of that but I I just really kind of secretly once I was in the world had this desire for God's will but had no way to know to find it I had no clue how to get it where where would I find it my whole family kind of fell away from going to church and everything that I knew as a child kind of shifted just slightly a little bit and uh I found myself out in the world just like everyone else but you know it was about junior high when I had this desire and and I I always secretly wanted to know the will of God where would I find that and you know later on in life much later in life I I had the testimony of my wife ministering to me through work we were co-workers and and she said in the end just to make it a short story today because I really want to preach she invited me to church and when I came to church I said I don't understand this but I know something about it is true what I'm hearing brother Ken preach something about this is real and true and I never heard this before and and I'm just going to keep going and as I kept going and and just keeping my shoulder to the wheel trusting that the the Lord was leading me and guiding me because I believed this was truth what I heard when I started to really get ears to hear what the spirit was saying to the church was that God's will is his word and for me I thought my that's similar to what my dad was teaching me when I was younger find God's will for your life and now I have a pastor saying God's will for your life is his word so I'm think my how does that work so time goes on through the process of time I start to encounter problems as normal believers do the the trials of Life come our way and we go to the pastor and say Pastor how how can I deal with this circumstance and this situation what should I do what's the will of God in this situation and he would say brother Barry his will is his word and I'd be like come on brother Ken there's got to be another way you got to be able to help me as a pastor surely to goodness God could give you a word that would actually help me expedite through this problem but he said no God's will is his word amen and you have to trust God yourself for him to give you the Revelation about what you're looking for and you know what that takes is patience and now I'm just going to be real honest there was a time where where I was coming to church and I was probably just about like a walking zombie I was coming to church because it's just what we did it was just a tradition and you know I I'm just going to be transparent about it I was married with Children we were coming to church I was a deacon I was struggling in my life in my walk and I'm so thankful that I had a pastor that I know discerned me in my station but he did not come and crush me amen what he did was he encouraged me I saw a thing online and I thought it was real good maybe I shouldn't say it but I'm going to a woman is getting an interview and she was probably some author or someone that knows a lot about men but what she uh was asked by the interviewer if you've got a a husband that just misbehaves and and doesn't treat his wife nice or his family nice how do you address that and the woman who was being interviewed she gave such a simple answer but I think it's so good and I I'm sure it was a scriptural uh sort of perspective but I'm not condoning women Ministry don't go off the wrong direction with this I'm just saying there was an interview ER and an interview e and one person was asked a question and she gave this answer she said inside of every man there is a king and a fool and whichever one you speak to is the one that's going to to respond and to me I thought my goodness that's so good you know I I I had a pastor here we all did the people who were here with brother Ken who had a man with a supernatural gift and he was able to actually bring out the best spiritually in every one of us and I'm certainly thankful for that man and his ministry and his willingness to lay down his life and sister Shelly too because she was just as much of the ministry as brother Ken you know you don't know what goes on behind the scenes brothers and sisters the pulpit is only one part of the ministry so God bless you Sister Shelly for all that you've done but brother Ken he never ever lashed out at me and got angry with me and and I'm so thankful that he didn't because it was exactly what I needed he spoke to the king in me he didn't speak to the fool inside of me and let me tell you there was a fool standing at the door cuz I got resentful with God I went through all manner of stuff I don't need to go and dump out the garbage can across the pulpit here to you but what I do want to say is that God is always with us and his will will come to pass in our lives and sometimes even if we can't see night from Day Day from night if if everything is going wrong in our lives brothers and sisters keep coming to church it's a trick of the devil to get you to stay away from the body of believers amen you know what I told the people in Lethbridge on Friday night one of the greatest blessings that can ever happen in a church is when you are willing to put aside your emotions and your feelings and present yourselves with the Brothers and Sisters in Christ in a service yes sir because everyone's going through stuff and when we get together and we see one another we can say wow there's others that believe and it just feels good to get together with the brothers and sisters but you know we might not get anything out of it we might just drag our carcass in and drag our carcass out not hear anything from the preaching of the word etc etc etc but another brother another sister might be absolutely encouraged because they can look and they can see that brother came again and I know what that brother's going through or that sister she's got the courage to keep coming to church and not give up Satan wants us to give up Satan would love nothing more than to destroy a church remember we read it the church that's not under persecution isn't of God so we thank God for the persecutions unfortunately we all have to go through them but one of the best encouragements we can ever do is actually just come to church and show the brothers and sisters whose side we're on when you're if you've ever played on a team sport that's been sort of volunteering and and you you get together and you're going to play a game and you got a bunch of people at the beginning of the Season they're gung-ho yeah we're going to play together and then when the season comes and you actually start to play games and you're no longer practicing and you go to a game and you have four people show up and and you need seven or eight people to play the game and the other team has 15 or 20 people and you all can look at each other and go oh my what going to happen here we're going to have to give double time we're going to have to really put our shoulders to the wheel and try hard to make this work and usually what happens in that situation is one team beats the other team because they can't really overcome that kind of power but brothers and sisters we know the natural types the spiritual and and maybe I'm getting a little carnal talking that way but when we have brothers and sisters show up it brings courage to us it shows us that we're on the same team I was certainly thankful to have a pastor that told me the truth his will is his word so I took and I ate the book like we've all been instructed to every single one of us the latter part of Revelations 10 we know there's more verses past Revelations 10 veres 1 to7 don't we we know those other verses there take the book and eat it up that's our commission brothers and sisters that's the bride's commission take that book and eat it up but you know honestly after I did that after I talked to my pastor about some of this stuff the struggles that were going on it was many years later that I caught the Revelation about what I'm getting into today it was many years later and you know it was a very plain conversation that I had with God if you've ever had one you'll know exactly what I'm talking about if you haven't had one I pray that you will because he wants to have those conversations with us and you know brother Bram says that maybe only one time in a person's life God will speak speak to you maybe only one time ever and that'll be it and that will be enough won't it to hear the voice of God for you in your own life we know that we've all actually had an experience that's why we're here today but it goes further than that excuse me he wants to take us and adopt us as his son and that doesn't mean just take you from not being his son to making you his son that means taking us and and showing an open declaration to everyone around this is my beloved son or daughter this is the one that I chose in me before the foundation of the world that's the kind of adoption we're talking about but you know for me in my life in my walk it took me a little bit of time and and what happened was a conversation happened just ordinary while I was driving to work and I was in that state where I didn't feel good about myself I didn't feel good about my marriage I didn't feel good about going to church I didn't feel good about my job I I was in a really rough spot Satan knows exactly how to get us exactly where we need to be how does he do that is because he knows our parents and he knows our parents parents and he knows the DNA that's inside of us and he's going to play upon all of that and you know it might sound naturally that's unfair that's unfair but what's unfair is that he believes the word of God maybe more so than most of the theologians brother Bram said Satan knows the word of God and he fears it it makes him tremble but we know that fools will walk with hob nail shoes over the word of God Where Angels Fear To Tread but I had this conversation with god I know he said to me just one time real plain real plain so that question about my will you want an answer for it and and I said yeah I do yeah kind of chuckled like Abraham I guess kind of chuckled I was just having this thought coming to me while I was driving and you want an answer yeah I do and so he said you know what my will is my word and I said yeah I know that I I've heard it before but I'd really like to understand it and he said you know there's a scriptural answer for a scriptural question and I thought my goodness he said you know what it's not an achievement and it's not a destination it's not even an action on our part we can't say that it's God's will for us to to go and get a degree it's God's will for us to go here or go there and it's God's will for us to do do this or do that but you know it's a paradox because it is so every one of those things so this is where it gets confusing and I know just try and bear with me as we go today I'm going to do my best to try and explain it I can only tell you the way God's told me and I I trust that it will be a blessing but you know many times we can look at it and I did myself to try and find God's will for my life does that mean that I'm going to be an airline pilot or a mechanic or an engineer or a mathematician a school teacher what am I going to be in my life is that what it's going to be and that's what I thought God's will was for for me to find that position in life and I think it is absolutely true we all have a calling and a commission from God and it doesn't matter whether we're we're the least of the Christians or the strongest of the Christians we've got the greatest of positions or the least of positions if we've got a position in the economy of God then that's all we need brothers and sisters that is it but it is truly a paradox because it's not an achievement even though it is an achievement it's not a destination but it but it truly is a destination is God's will for our life because many people could say brother Barry I moved here from another country knowing that it was the will of God and I acknowledge that and recognize that and say Amen it truly is I'm just explaining the way God revealed this to me it is a paradox because the truth of the question came to me so clearly and it was simply this that if your word my word abides in you you abide in me and my word abides in you then what ask what you will and it will be done to you it doesn't say where you're at it doesn't say where you're going it doesn't say with what you've achieved just if ye abide in me and my words abiding in you then ask what you will if you're going to get a degree and you feel led to go that way then simply have his word inside of you abide in him and have his word abiding in you then when you go and you do that degree you're going to be able to ask what you will and he'll help you through every single exam every single lab every single thing you got to do every paper you got to write you will do well because it's his will but his will is having him in every moment of whatever it is we're doing brothers and sisters that's the critical factor and that's what I needed to understand it's not some place that I'm going to go to and discover his will like a treasure chest and open up and say yahooo I found his will look it I found it I found it no his will is inside of the believer but we've got to have him inside of us that that that that question became so clearly answered and you know I I said in my heart I said I understand that I can see the the connecting of the dots but I need a little more than that and and I I'm only going to touch on one part of it today and I can can see time is flying but you know the one thing that the Lord said to me in that moment he said you want a scriptural answer for it don't you and this is how I knew it was the Lord because the devil's not going to go and do that and give us truth the devil's going to try and give us something else some kind of alternative and what he did was he said take a look at Joseph's life look at Joseph every single step of the way in his life what did he do he kept the word first he believed the Lord he created him to believe him he created him to be able to just manifest the life of Jesus Christ the life of God to everyone around him and he didn't care what their opinions were he didn't care what they thought he simply did it but I said you know I I do in fact I do need a scriptural answer for this and he said look at Joseph and take a look at Joseph's life and so we're going to do that today we're going to take a look at some of the aspects of Joseph's life but we'll get into it a little bit later one of the other things he said was look at Daniel's life two Believers in the scripture and both of them had tremendously strong circumstances against them but both of them kept the word before everything in their lives and what did God do even in the midst of their trials even in the midst of their calamities God blessed them and he made them both blessings to the people all around them and we know Joseph was a type of Jesus Christ that's what brother bradam said and I'm not going to dispute that for a second but I just want to bring the aspect of what like I said the Lord showed me clearly that you know what our our destination isn't necessarily the will of God because if that was the case how did he get th why did he get thrown into a pit and then drug out of the pit and then sold into slavery is that God's will for us my sometimes there's some tough circumstances out of one in a million brother Bram I just want to sort of lay down the foundations for this his will is his word he in one of a million he says let me give you shocking something see not all that's says unto me Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father I love that and he just says it plainly his will is his word amen we can be ever so religious have great times shouting jumping in these meetings which were he says I don't want to be critical but I've got a duty to God and that duty is to be sincere and to say what he wants me to say and you know brothers and sisters many people claim Jesus today and they also say that his word is for another time or it was for another culture it was for another season isn't that exactly what the devil did with Eve God told Eve when she was inside of Adam that the day you eat of that tree is the day you will surely die but Satan comes along and says you shall not surely die just go ahead taste of that fruit it won't kill you but we know they were supposed to live a thousand years and they never did did they we know death entered in at that place and that's truly Satan's trick is to try and put off God's word into some other day or back in the in the past to look back at what God's done my goodness we had such good time such good meetings brother Bram had prayer lines etc etc etc You Know Not much bothers Satan about religion brothers and sisters why is that because Satan is the most religious he is the most religious and you know if you question that there's a scriptural answer you can look back to when Jesus was in the temple and he would talk to the Pharisees in the Sadducees and what did he call them he said you're not of your father Adam or your father God he said you're of your father the devil Satan is the most religious and Satan believes that word and he trembles but he doesn't tremble when people don't believe the word he says yeah I've got them I've got them right where I want them in a straight where they think they're good and they're actually not they think they're saved and they're actually not they're in a position where they they say they believe the word and they they act like they believe the word but deep down inside they don't believe the word because if they did they would say Amen to it and not just in a church service but in their very life in their homes their children their neighbors everyone would say that's a real believer right there but you know when the devil devil does tremble brothers and sisters and this is where I think it gets real good it's when the word of God that word of God is actually in our hearts and as not just in our hearts if ye abide in me and my word abides in you remember that scripture then ask what you will then speak what you will we live under the third pole anointing in the day in which we live when that word of God is no longer just something that's spoken and and just acted but when it's actually lived then when it's on the lips of a son and daughter of God it's then that Satan trembles and what happens at that point is Satan becomes powerless before us and we know that that's what's in the word of God that's what's in in the message of the hour a and I think it's important for us to find the will of God the true will of God for our lives according to the message of the hour according to the day in which we live brothers and sisters and you know what it means it means not making compromises with this message of the hour and saying you know what I see it this way so I'm just going to live it this way and and you know you might believe it that way but I'm going to believe it another way brothers and sisters there's only one way only one truth and one life and it's the word of God God and if we're willing to make excuses and concessions for it we're giving Satan a day off but when we can believe that word and actually live that word and actually speak that word and when that word comes around and brings correction to our doorsteps we say thank you Lord thank you Lord because it means you love me I know that you're my father but when we say I resent that you know what you're not resenting brother Barry you're not resenting the minister that says it if it's the word word of God you're resenting God and it means that there's another nature inside of you and we need to get rid of that nature but you know Psalms 138 he esteems his word greater than his name Psalms 138:2 I will worship toward thy Holy Temple and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy truth for thou Hast magnified Thy word above all thy name in the day when I cried thou answerest me and strengthen me with strength with strength in my soul I think that's such a beautiful scripture I remember brother Ken bringing that and it just it's never left we've we've just kept that real close to our heart because it's so important for us to recognize the word of God is what the prophet pointed to the word of God is what every single Prophet pointed to I I've been doing a little study of the five anointings of Elijah and it's just so beautiful because every single one of them pointed back to scripture every one of those prophets pointed right back to scripture it's such a beautiful thing out of 1960 the Queen of Sheba brother Bram he says I I said I can't help how much Goliath it is God is still God the god of David still lives the god of Abraham still lives the god of Jacob lives the God that was in Christ is living tonight he's raised and I know he's real amen amen he says there's something that no matter what the difficult is you want to go anyhow because there's you've got an objective and if you'll take the right motive towards that objective you'll get there now he's talking about his will finding his will you'll have you've got to have the right motive towards your objective that's the way I always find the will of God first think if it's the will of God then my motive and my objective to it if it's the right motive then the objective I have and we know brother bham says it in the message that the right mental attitude to any one of the promises of God will bring it to pass in our lives what is our motive towards the actions in our lives brothers and sisters what is the objective for the actions that we're actually dealing with in our lives why are we doing it what's the purpose for it is it to glorify God is it according to the word of God isn't it a beautiful thing to think that the prophet in our day he said that our thoughts are louder in heaven than our voices are and even right now this morning brothers and sisters he knows exactly what we're thinking it's just so beautiful if we could truly have the right mental attitude I we've said this before youve probably all heard it before and it's not in the message I'm not saying that uh Brother Brad might say it I've never looked it up but our attitude it will dictate our altitude the attitude in which we choose to have in life it will determine how high we're going to fly as Eagles it's possible to be an eagle and just sit on the ground it's possible to be an eagle and be scratching around in a chicken yard not realizing that we're Eagles it's possible to be an eagle and to have your Eagle Eye filmed over amen brothers and sisters the Lord is Our Shepherd and he will lead us and guide us in every single stage of our walk in every single stage of Our Lives first Thessalonians chapter 5 if you want to turn there with me 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 14 now we exhort you Brethren warn them that are unruly Comfort the feeble minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks why for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning youall concerning me in everything give thanks amen because that's the will of God not get upset not go and talk about a brother or sister but to Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing it's tough It's Not Easy I'm not saying it's easy I'm saying it's tough it definitely is tough but what is our attitude today brothers and sisters in First Peter chapter 2 I'll just read it for the sake of time submit yourselves to every Ord of man for the Lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme or unto Governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well for so is the will of God that with well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men so when you read a scripture like that it becomes real difficult to tolerate when you hear people say well I don't believe it that way or I don't like doing it that way or I want to try and pinch a corner and not pay taxes and you know the government will never know about that and this and that and every single time we want to actually try and contravene the law and I say Lord help me because I know sometimes I get a little heavy in the foot especially when I'm on the phone or a good song is playing you know speeding is against the law right that's not actually following the ordinance of the king we have laws of the land we're supposed to Render unto Caesar what's Caesar's but give God what's God's brothers and sisters SS but here we have the instruction of the word of God for us to not be trying to to to find loopholes and to find Solutions but to actually do the right thing because people are watching our lives and once again I'll say this you know what if we're doing that continually God has a way of sorting us out and it might not be tomorrow and it might not be next week but it might be in the life of our children it might be in a situation that we're like how can that possibly be but God will allow things to happen we're dealing with God's timing God's economy we need to know exactly where we stand not for our sake sometimes for our children's sake for our wi sake for our husband's sake for our church sake we need to make sure that we do the will of God verse 16 as free and not using your Liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the Servants of God and you know when we do when people know that we're a Christian and we beat our chest and say I'm a Christian I go to church I believe the message of the hour but then we go and we do things that are underhanded what does that do that completely undermines Our Testimony it completely erodes the faith that people have in the god in which we serve amen amen they say why would I do that because that's just like I expected the religious covering it says honor all men verse 17 love the Brotherhood fear God honor the king servants be subject to your masters with all fear and not only to the good and gentle but also to the forward how many servants do we have here we can take that word out I'm not going to add to or take away I just want to try and bring a little bit of light to the situation employees let's put that word in there employees employees be subject to your Masters your bosses with all fear and not only to the good and gentle but also to the forward the ones that are real tough to deal with those hard task Masters be gentle and good to them for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it if you be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God why not always needing to be right not always needing to be on top not always needing to get the last word in but to say hey you know what if this is what the Lord wants then that's okay blessed be the name of the Lord to endure with patience a and to Rejoice is what we heard in verse 16 Rejoice ever more and pray without ceasing thanking the lord verse 21 says for even here unto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us a what an example that ye should follow in his steps [Music] amen he do who did not sin neither was guile found in his mouth I say Lord help me who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not now we know the story all too well he could have gone like that he could have just batted his eye and had 12 Legions of angels destroying everyone but he didn't for our sake so that he could die and and redeem all those that were his but also to give us an example a Godly example of how to live our lives even when we're persecuted who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes ye were healed past tense already done for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and the bishop of your souls brothers and sisters what a wonderful thought that is he has already corrected us and brought us in he's already paid the reproach for our sins and all we need to do is follow his word because his word is his will amen it doesn't matter where we're at doesn't matter what job we're at doesn't matter where we're living doesn't matter what pit we're in what jail we're in doesn't matter maybe what palace we're living in or or how high we're flying it doesn't matter how much money we've got we just need to remember God's will his word every step of the way there's no shortcuts you know we all have to learn obedience is what we read about on Wednesday the saman church age for those maybe weren't here if you're curious about it the saman church age under the exposition of the seven Church ages we all have to learn obedience just like Jesus did through the things that we suffer because that's how he learned obedience was the things that he suffered how could we actually circumvent that how could we have a shortcut I think it's so amazing though brothers and sisters going back to kind of where we started is we want to feel find sorry God's word for our lives we want to to see his word fulfilled in our lives and you know like I said I had that conversation with the Lord and I believe he showed me this it's just amazing when you look at it because you can see clearly that his will is his word and it doesn't matter where you're at or what you're going through if we're willing to actually put his word first in our situation we will see him with us am so you know this question about looking into the scripture about his will a a scriptural question brothers and sisters it has to equal a scriptural answer where there's a deep calling what there has to be a deep to respond right that's the way we believe so look back to the Old Testament if if you want to maybe just turn with me to Genesis Chapter 30 we're just sort of getting started with this I think it's beautiful even though we're getting close to running out of time I'm not going to try and hold us late today but I just really want to take a look a good look at the life of Joseph there's so many different things that happened in his life that are just so relevant to us in our day and and as an example understanding that Joseph was a type of Christ knowing that full well Genesis chapter 23 just just looking at where did Joseph come from just to sort of set a background as a study you know what what happened here he came from we know Rachel and and the and the union of Jacob the the Shyer and and Rachel Genesis CH 30 verse 23 and she conceived and bear a son and said God hath taken away my reproach and she called his name Joseph and said the Lord shall add to me another son I just just wanted to mention that because we can see in the scripture here where Joseph came from his beginning and I had never really seen this before I started really looking at this and it's just uh a really neat thing to see we know that Jacob was his father and Rachel was his mother and his brother was Benjamin and Jacob he had four wives and you know he made the deal with his father father-in-law for the sake of time I'm just going to mention it you can go and read the story it's a real good one if you haven't read it recently but he made a deal with his father-in-law who actually was his uncle his mother's brother for his daughter and we know that he had two daughters at the time Leah and Rachel and Leah was tendere eyed but Rachel she was beautiful and we know that he fell in love with her immediately when he met her he immediately fell in love with her Rachel and and the father-in-law when he did the right thing and asked the father-in-law you know can I have your daughter in marriage and and he said sure you can but you know I can't let her go that easy because she means a lot to me and you know if you are to take her I think it would be real good for you to earn your stripes and show that you can provide for her while providing for me secretly but provide for her as a husband and actually just stick around for seven years and then you can have her and we know that so he said hey if that's all it takes no problem s years of Labor I'm in so he stuck around for S years worked for his father-in-law and we know that he was duped at the wedding when it was time to consummate the marriage the father quickly swapped the daughters and sent in Leah instead of Rachel the one that he made the deal for and in the morning when he recognized whoa this is different than what I anticipated this ain't the deal we made and he said it to his father-in-law he said yeah well we've got you know there's one little little uh little fine print here that we didn't mention before and that's we can't let the the the younger one go before the older one gets married so we've got to actually just do it that way and he said you know what give me my wife I want her and he said well if that's the case you can do it but unfortunately we've got this rule about the seven-year labor thing so stick around another seven years and you can have her so he said okay if that's all it's going to take seven more years I'm in cuz I love her but you know it's interesting the thing that I never saw before is that the word of God says that he hated Leah but he loved Rachel what kind of children do you think would be conceived with someone in a union where there's hatred I wondered why these brothers hated them so much but it becomes crystal clear in the scriptures oh yeah right so here we have zilpa who was the maid servant to Leah and baa who was the maid servant to Rachel they were also given to him with the wives it was a package deal so instead of just him getting two wives he got four for the price of two 14 years of Labor he gets four wives but it was through these four wives that Jacob had the 12 Patriarchs of the tribes of of Israel and it says in the word of God there was only one that he loved and it's interesting because he only had two boys with that one that he loved and and the one is Joseph and the other one is Benjamin and we know Benjamin was a real special Brother Joseph at 17 years old in Genesis 37 maybe turn over there quickly while we still have amen a couple minutes amen Genesis chapter 37 this is where this story really starts to pick up pace and where I really wanted to get to and it's just in time to close so I guess we'll maybe try and pick up some next week Lord willing Genesis CH 37 verse 1 and Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan these are the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his Brethren and the lad was with the sons of bilah and with the sons of zilpa his father's wives and Joseph brought unto his father what their evil report these weren't the the the sons these weren't the brothers of the one whom his father loved these were the ones that were just sort of of the package deal verse three now Israel loved Joseph Jacob Israel we know that Jacob's name was changed God changed his walk we skipped over that part but we know that his dad Joseph's dad Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and we know this is a very popular very famous Bible story excuse me a very popular Bible story the cat of Many Colors I remember it when I was going to Sunday school as a kid but the Brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him can imagine they always had a chip on their shoulder because daddy loved him more every single time they interacted with him it was abrasive it was it was it was with something they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him and the footnote in my Bible says friendly they just couldn't be friendly to him because they they were jealous they knew their dad loved him more verse 5 says and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his Brethren and they hated him yet the more as I read this I keep thinking how how much could they really hate him it's his they're Brothers and he said unto them here I pray you this dream verse six which I have dreamed for behold we were binding sheep in the field and lo my sheath arose and also stood upright and behold your sheathes stood round about and made obedience to my sheath can you imagine that no fear knowing that they don't speak friendly to him but he's going to tell them the dream in his heart anyways because he's a Believer he's a genuine believer who was conceived in love the other ones weren't that's right but isn't it wild when you think about it you take one step back and you say wow those are the Patriarchs of the tribes of the children of Israel isn't it interesting that there was only two children from the marriage that was loved and and and the rest of them the other 10 were from other relations from the same Daddy isn't it interesting the children of Israel when they sent the spies into the land two of them only were able to say Amen we're more than able but 10 of them said no way there's no way that we can go over there where did they come from those other 10 Valiant men from those tribes brothers and sisters right that seed Gene carries on and Carries On and Carries On but isn't it wild to think that even though Naturally Speaking we can say I've got those things that try to carry on in my life we know there is a chain breaker we know there is a way maker we know there is a living God he has given us the ability to Step Beyond all of that generational garbage that we would otherwise be contending with and that's what causes the human being outside of having the Holy Ghost to be a brute Beast because a loving human being wouldn't want to sell their brother into slavery a loving human being wouldn't want to kill him wouldn't want to throw him in a pit wouldn't want to just take a the coat that their dad made for him and dip it in Blood and take it back to their dad and kill their dad and say oh your poor precious Golden Child he's dead a wild animal must have caught him we know that story all too well but remember they killed their dad for some reason they might have thought maybe that can urge inside of us will actually get Daddy to love us more and all they had to do was actually love the one that he loved and daddy would have loved them more but it was exactly opposite because he didn't have they didn't have the right nature they couldn't they were conceived wrong Israel loved Joseph more than all of his children what an amazing thing verse eight and his Brethren said unto him shalt thou indeed Reign Over Us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us you could just imagine maybe a bunch of teenagers or young adults and then a child like brother Isaiah saying you know I had a dream that my sheave actually watched your sheaves bow down to my she could you imagine how the young adult brothers would be they'd probably be tripping him every chance they got they'd probably be pushing them around and mocking him making it very difficult for him because of jealousy because of Pride the original sin that Satan had in his life iniquity was found in his heart right verse eight and his Brethren said unto him shalt thou indeed Reign Over Us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words and it just compounds verse 9 and he dreamed yet another dream that's where you have to say oh my and told it his Brethren and said behold I have dreamed a dream more and behold the Sun and the Moon and the 11 stars made obedience to me and he told it to his father and to his Brethren and we know that his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou Hast dreamed what you talking about boy shall I and thy mother and th Brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the Earth and that's exactly what happened isn't it amen the sun moon and the stars we know that he was so highly exalted that he was above everything and he still is and he always will be and we just have the ability to recognize that just by his grace we are saved through faith in this word amen it's just such an amazing thing verse 11 and his Brethren envied him oh but his father observed the saying someone somewhere along the way said hey there's something about this we've got to actually just take note of it and you know it is 12:00 I don't want to hold us long I I'm just going to press pause there I'll call the musicians I I just want to say brothers and sisters it's really impressed on my heart to recognize God's will for our lives and his will is his word it's not a denominational teaching it's not some sort of mess message oity it it's none of that it's the will of God is his word for us in our day it is truly the entirety of the message of the hour and when we have his word when he abides in us when we abide in him and he abides in us we can ask what we will and we'll have it we don't have to be afraid brothers and sisters and and really where I'm going with this is I want to say if we've got something on our heart to do if we've got something on our heart that the Lord has been leading us to that just keeps coming how do you know it's the Lord maybe stand with me as we close or I won't close I'll keep preaching it's just so much on my heart with this how do we know it's God speaking to us because many times we'll have an idea keep coming to us an idea keeps coming to us if it's in line with the word then it's God if it's not contravening the word of God then it's God but if it's one iota stepping outside of the bounds of the word of God brothers and sisters leave it Al alone because it will lead you astray it'll take you right into the unpromised land and and you know we'll get into this it's the permissive will of God because if you're a son and daughter of God you're gods and you're going to go all the way but you can get into the permissive will of God and that's where life gets really prickly that's where life gets really difficult and all we need to do is just go back and repent brother bradam says it just go back to where you got off and just get straight with God allow him to fix the problem the way he wants to and everything will be all right it's not going to be without trials or tribulations though remember his will is his word and he wants every one of us to be in good health and prosper he doesn't want to see any one of us downtrodden and Destroy none of his children will be begging bread brothers and sisters amen serving God is not a vow of poverty but it's not about actually being rich and famous either it's that Paradox of understanding that will meet every single need in my life let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word Lord Jesus we thank you for your will father we thank you for your message that you've given to us through a Vindicated prophet in the day in which we live father and we thank you for giving us ears to hear what your spirit said through that man father we know that that is the way that's the way that was chosen for you to speak to man through to a prophet and father we just receive the prophet in the name of a prophet looking to that prophet's reward and we know that that's life eternal we know that that's overcoming power here father because Lord until you take us out of the way father we have to fight the battle we've got to live in this world and how could we ever do it without your spirit living out through us and we know that the message of the hour came so that we could get your spirit truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost father we love you and we thank you I pray father for each family Lord Jesus each each person represented here today maybe those who are streaming or watching later those who aren't here father maybe in Lethbridge oh Father each and every one Lord Jesus let us discover your true will for us in our lives Lord father that we could see the power of you living out through US Lord not for a show but Lord Jesus so that we can overcome that we can overcome ourselves father we love you and we thank you we just pray that you would keep your hand upon us today as we go our separate ways that you would just continue revealing yourself father to us and through US Lord Jesus and help us father we pray that if we're going through a trial that we would not actually become seared with a hot iron but that we would actually receive what it is you want for us to get out of it Lord we love you and we thank you we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen just made me think about it I remember a brother saying it and for those people who know him you might know the saying don't waste the pain we all get pain and it's for a reason don't waste it the reason we have it is so that we can learn and grow from it amen God bless you this morning can we sing can you hear the sound from Heaven it's like the sound of many [Music] Waters can hear the
