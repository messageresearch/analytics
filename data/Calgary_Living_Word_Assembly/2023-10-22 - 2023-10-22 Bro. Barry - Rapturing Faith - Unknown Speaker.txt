just want to thank you for your goodness to each and every one of us now father as we go forwards we just want to commit this service into your hands Lord pray that you would be with brother mvin

morning that you would just anoint them Father that you would help us Lord to recognize our position just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians you have your Bibles this morning I'd just like to read from Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesians chap 1 verse 10 Ephesians chapter 1 verse 10 but in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even to him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also that ye believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord we just want to commit this service into your hands this morning we pray that this word that we've spoken Lord J Jesus that it would just resonate in the hearts of your children that we would begin to recognize father who we are that this spiritual Amnesia would begin to peel away from our lives Lord that we would see that we have an inheritance already waiting for us in heaven undefiled Lord something that's reserved for each and every one of us who are able to believe your word we just Commit This service now into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just want to remember brother fiston boka he'll be heading back to Congo on Thursday it's brother Jose's brother I believe your brother-in-law sorry brother sister Becky's brother he'll be heading back to Congo on Thursday just want to remember him in prayer that the Lord will grant unto him traveling mercies amen a happy this morning amen just a few announcements before we get too far we canel the potluck this afternoon due to the weather the temperatures we're just not equipped yet in the hall for colder temperatures one of these days we'll get a heater I'm sure um so the potluck is canceled please don't uh don't come anticipating the potluck it's not happening so we have uh a gym night on the 31st it's uh Halloween night the rest of the world's going to go and celebrate all of the evil and everything that this world consists of and uh we have an opportunity just to get together and fellowship with brothers and sisters of like Precious faith and just have a little fun maybe toss around a ball or two and uh so we'll definitely look forward to that and we have uh the first Saturday in November coming up very soon and that means we will be turning back the clocks we will gain an extra hour in our day and uh uh we know we've heard people say that it's just like clipping off the bottom of a blanket and then sewing it to the top of the blanket you still have the same blanket but I guess for a few months we will have a a little bit of a difference in the way we operate we'll have some more Daylight and that's the purpose of it so uh time change is coming up Saturday uh November 5th please uh just take note of that and uh you know if you if you don't uh you'll wind up coming to church an hour early and that's not a bad thing that's right can set an atmosphere for the service and you know do you believe that you have the ability to change the entire atmosphere of the service one person can do that for Better or For Worse it just depends on where we are where where we stand and we come to church to be Washed by the Water of the word and I I believe we all have the same desire and if we don't I pray that we will have very soon that we'll have the same desire because as we read this morning you know that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one not two not three not many different churches not many different sects of the message of the hour not many different ideas and and and teachings and traditions but he wants to gather everything together in one and the only way we're going to get there is to let his mind be in us and the only way we're going to get that is to actually get the Holy Ghost the only way we're going to get that is to come according to his word for our day we have the ability to come we have the ability to get that but we just need to surrender to it I'm sure many people have heard um I hope it's okay I'm just going to take a couple minutes and just talk about brother Billy Paul he passed away this week on October the 19th at 3:33 a.m. and uh I just think it's interesting how that was what was documented the exact time of death and I know that's the same way for every human officially there has to be a record of it but just specifically in our brother's life there's no accident that moment that second when he took his very last breath was actually ordained in heaven before the foundation of the world for him to come across it was no accident there was no Changing of the Guard there was no situational thing that happened this this wasn't an accident he died of natural causes but it was the time for him to come home that's when God said now it's time for him to cross over that River and we know uh I'm sure most of us if not all of us have have seen the write up about this about the dream that uh brother Billy Paul told about seeing his daddy on the other side of a river just before he passed away he had this dream he he dreamt of seeing his daddy on the other side of the river and his daddy said to him this is Brother Bram he said to him brother Billy son you look tired and he said Oh Daddy I am am and he said come walk with me can you imagine that and just shortly after that he actually did cross over that River and we know there's a write up about it but uh he passed away at 88 years of age and uh I just think it's it's it's neat to to look at the situation because we can see that he was an old man and we know that there's an an oral tradition there's a discussion about how Billy Paul talked about his dad and him standing in Los Angeles once upon a time that was after the service where brother branam he under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit he said capernium capernium thou who Hast exalted yourself into heaven and he speaking about Los Angeles the City of Angels you've exalted yourself into heaven but you shall be brought down into hell we know that was the same thing that Jesus said about capernium in the New Testament and we know that happened very well capernium went under the ocean but many times people have taken that and and and and actually blended it together with the discussion about Los Angeles and California specifically slipping into the ocean where brother bradam said that will happen he said California's doomed that's right he said that's going to happen thus saith the Lord that's going to happen and when a prophet says thus sayith the Lord that's time to perk up your ears when you're a Believer we know this I know it but what I do want to say this morning is that we know brother Billy Paul heard his dad say standing in Los Angeles after the services that where he prophesied that he said that one day you're going to be standing uh here where you're standing right now there's going to be sharks swimming in around this building the May building in Los Angeles before before year and old man and now we have brother Brandon passing away at age 88 how many people in and around the message of the hour were looking for the Great Earthquake of California to slip into to the ocean to see that that prophecy would be fulfilled but we know I'm sure that we know brother Juma God bless you brother it's good to see you again everybody knows that brother Juma is married I didn't see you there brother congratulations brother Juma we look forward to talking to you and meeting your bride soon brother but we know that this this this prophecy went forward about uh shark swimming brother brother Billy Paul said that his daddy told him that sharks would be swimming at this building or in this building before you're an old man and at what age do you become an old man is really the discussion I think it's important to have the discussion because like I said some people had actually taken and potentially Blended the Prophecies of California sliding into the ocean to Billy Paul being an old man but at age 88 years old here he passes over into glory and California's still there even right now this morning we know it's still there it's important for us to recognize that we can't take and make it what we want it to be and it's even more important I believe and I'm sure we would all say Amen to it to Simply take what's on the tapes we can hear a lot of different discussions in and around the message well brother brandham said this and and and he did that and and all of the other things and they can be absolutely 100% true but they were not recorded as thus saith the Lord like the tapes were right right so it's important for us to remember that uh just because we didn't see California slip into the ocean that doesn't change any part of the message of the hour that doesn't change at one iota and I just love what brother Toby said a little while ago and I'll probably just dwell on it for a little while as we go forwards in the coming days weeks and months you know if brother bradam were even come back from the dead and say you know I made a mistake I made an error in the message of the hour a Believer today of the message of of the hour is going to say you know what it's too late I already believe you can't change my mind because why because I've met him I've met the Lord Jesus Christ for myself I've had a real experience with him and that was the purpose of the Prophet for our day was to introduce us to Christ not to get us to follow his family I just want to quote Brother Joseph because I think it's so true oh this is going to oh my my my bear with me today ah the microphones are giving me grief um Brother Joseph he quotes this this is his words here friends we know the coming of the Lord is so very near this is Brother Joseph bradam and for the record we having a discussion the other night with the deacons and I just want to say it too I think it's important for everybody to know exactly where I stand I don't know where you stand that's up to you it's between you and God where you stand with the message of the hour Brother Joseph Bram and all of that Brother Joseph bradam in my opinion he's our brother 100% our brother he has done so much for the Bride of Jesus Christ he's the reason why we have it on all of the digital media that we have there's no reason to get hung up on trying to judge him and say that this should be that and all you know what brothers and sisters if we're doing that it's a critical spirit and we better pray that the Lord would take it away from us because how will the world know that we love him that we've got love for one another that we can take a wooden spoon and spank someone correct them and and tell them that we love them no so that we can actually truly genuinely love them from our hearts Joseph is quoted saying friends we know the coming of the Lord is so very near we pray that brother Billy's call home will not discourage you right but may it encourage us all today as we reflect on the life of a true and faithful servant of God tremendous words if you go to the voice of God website you can see that on there you can read the whole article but I just wanted to bring that one one part just to underline and and and and highlight and Bolden and just really excuse me impress this that you know we don't want to look for a natural event right to say that we need to change change something in our lives or get right what we need to do is say right now we have the opportunity to get right because when we leave this building today it might be over for us and you know what I I I don't want to be really scary I don't want to scare anybody but two two times recently we've had accidents right outside our door here one of these times one of our Lives could be called home and what we call an auto accident won't be an accident that will be God saying it's time for my my dear dear son or my dear daughter to come home but have we got it fixed up we're probably going to get into this a little bit later in the service this morning but brothers and sisters death is not going to change who we are who you are right now is who you're going to be there so if you're filled with the Holy Ghost and you just have the the the the ability to worship freely and just say Amen to the word of God and you're not worried about criticizing people and criticizing min and looking at all these different things around husbands and wives criticizing one another brothers and sisters siblings forget about it all it's a critical spirit knocking on your door saying will you let me in I want to come in it's a critical spirit it's the same thing as being afraid what do we have to be afraid of do we believe that God's in control you know why we get afraid brothers and sisters is because we know something ain't right inside our soul that's why we get scared that's what causes us to have a fear in our lives but you know when we actually can take that fear and say hey I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ I'm not supposed to be afraid that's the devil trying to make me afraid I want to encourage everyone go and listen to the Future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride and listen to what brother brandham says in there and you know it'll take a little while it's a long message is not as long as Christ is the mystery of God revealed it's half as long but maybe just try and break it up into three parts part one part two part three first hour second hour third hour and when you get into the second and third hour brother bradam God through brother bradam really starts to express what we're heading for brothers and sisters we're going to a world that is just like we have but perfect Amen to think about it no storm clouds he says no typhoons nor tornado es no hurricanes no sickness no germs no sin and no death that's where we're headed for and he's already come to redeem this world he's already spilled his blood on this Earth so it could be redeemed but it's not going to be Redeemed by water that was Noah's message this time it's going to be Redeemed by fire amen and this whole entire world is set up just like a a a room full of mouse traps everybody knows what a mouse trap looks like a picture a room full of mous traps and somebody just takes a pingpong ball and just throws it into that room full of mous traps this world is set up now with all of the countries that have nuclear arms just set up ready to go and if you listen to this message brother bham talks about how this world's going to be baptized with Holy Fire this world is going to be completely cleansed it's gonna it's going to it's going to be washed thoroughly before he can come back and we'll get into all those quotes but I just think it's beautiful how how Joseph Bram he says this friends we know the coming of the Lord is so very near and we know as Believers that it's never been closer that's my words but he says we pray that brother Billy's call home will not discourage you don't look for a natural circumstance don't assume that it should be a certain way if someone has taught us that it's incorrect if somebody has said that Billy PA is going to be an old man before the coming of the Lord or or whatever we want to put it as don't look at it that way just get your heart right make sure that we know where we're going to go when we die because there are some people who are here that will not taste of death but in a moment in the twinkling of an eye they'll be changed in an instant into that new glorious body amise we're not going to get there if like I said said we're busy criticizing if we're busy criticizing we've got a critical spirit if we're afraid we've got a spirit of fear if we're angry we've got a spirit of anger these are all spirits and and just we need to make sure that we understand that the Bride of Jesus Christ that elect lady the one that he's coming back for whose bodies will be changed in the moment of twinkling eye all hell is is bombarding her at this very moment even right now in the service I can feel it myself but you know what greater is he that is in me than he that is in this world because this world is built on Satan's technology this this whole entire world civilization is of the devil is what brother brandham says those are sharp words I know some people won't like that but that's the truth according to the word of God but if you don't believe in the word of God then I guess we don't have a whole lot to talk about right you know brother bradam and Billy Paul they were there and La after that prophecy and and and brother Ram he said that and they were standing in front of the May building in Downtown Los Angeles and you know it was quoted there's a a a YouTube video where where brother Tim puit he's he's he's mentioning it that someone was listening to the Paul Harvey Show in the US Once Upon a Time and they talked about how there was an earthquake in Los Angeles and how there was a flood subsequent flood that came in and actually washed sharks into this may building and they were swimming there I don't know if they lived or they died or what else happened from there but that was back in the 70s and how old was brother Billy Paul then I was going to do the math I was thinking about it but I got sidetracked and I didn't do it but you know if it was 1975 or anywhere in the 70s in that decade if you were to just deduct that from 88 years old where he is today how old was he you know brother bradam said he was old at age 50 so I guess I'm an old man but you know he was quoted as saying that you won't be an old man but there'll be sharks swimming here and that prophecy if if it's true I don't know if it is I tried to look it up honestly I tried to fact check myself here with this I wanted to see if you could find anything on the May building it it's a Sabin building now it's renamed but I wanted to see if there was actually anything in Wikipedia or online that I could find I know I saw an article at one point that's the reason I was looking for it I saw an article at one point and and maybe somewhere I'll have it if I do I'll share it with you I think I might have saved it but I'm not sure where anyways whether whether it was fulfilled or not is that going to change our opinion of the message of the hour because I would say this brothers and sisters if that's the case then we have got the wrong message of the hour the right message of the hour is going to say Christ Christ in you Christ in me the hope of glory anything else is false right you know prophecies can be fulfilled without us even knowing about it just like where where we read the book of Revelation and we say that you know there's the the the mother of harlots and and all of the harlots all the daughters that are underneath her all we know brother Ram said very clearly that that's Rome out and say that all the denominational churches are now Roman Catholic they're not but it's interesting because if you look at it most of them believe the apostles Creed where did that come from how does that work most of them believe in trinitarian Doctrine trinitarian baptism where does that come from if you go back and you look at the history you can see it but what I'm saying is all of the daughters have already paid homage homage to Rome amen they're already signed up it's already happened it's not something we're looking for to happen they're already there that's right and you know brothers and sisters without the Holy Ghost in our lives I've said it so many times without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we've already accepted the mark of the beast by not accepting the Holy Ghost In Our Lives because we're born in sin shaped in iniquity we come to this world speaking lies you've got the mark of the beast when you come out of your mother's womb that's the way it is that's really harsh too but it's true because we didn't come into this world The Way We were supposed to right at the end of that message future home of the Heavenly Bride of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride brother bradam he Ted talks about serpent seed very clearly he really spells it out in that last hour of that message and we're not going there I'm not going to read that quote but just need to be careful where we put our faith brothers and sisters we can put our faith in in oral tradition we can put our faith in family tradition we can say well that's not the message that I believe that's not the message that my parents taught me you know I would say take the message that that is is printed in the books and and played on the tapes make that the message message that you believe because that message points to the word of God every other message brothers and sisters any other interpretation is going to leave us in a tribulation and that time has never been closer like I said we're we're we're we're actually living on a powder cake right now the way this world is set up we know there's a time where the whole world is going to be surrounding Israel who knows if this is the time now but when has there ever been two carrier strike groups groups right beside Israel the US how how how many countries are actually pro Israel today not very many and it looks like there's probably going to be less in the very near future and we know there's a time where the whole world turns on Israel we have to make sure we know where we're put in our faith and this is what I'm getting at today brothers and sisters this this verse 10 of Ephesians chapter 1 that in the dispensation of the full of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him who is him Christ Jesus the Holy Ghost the earnest of our inheritance we have to make sure we know where we stand we have to make sure we know where we put our faith and and that it's in the one who sent the prophet and it's not based on the prophet's family and it's not based on maybe something that the prophet did but it's based in very specifically on the one who sent the prophet because we know this Prophet was an elaser he was he was sent to call a bride that the Lord wanted to choose himself and we know that that's exactly why he came and we know that's exactly what he's done I'm so sorry I can hear this thing it bugs me when I hear puffing puffing puffing continually sorry um so we have a quote here that I definitely want to read oh my actually I don't think I gave it to you brother so I'll just read it bear with me for a second instead of Look Away to Jesus 19 63 brother Bram says it's so sacred that I mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning said this say nothing of it you remember that years ago speaks for itself see I just read that and I thought man this is so true isn't it speaks for itself that life that's inside of every believer it speaks for itself see but I've I've tried to explain the others and made aist mistake can you believe that Prophet said it he made a mistake it's true though he was a human and he knew it he says this will be the thing that to my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me this this will be a thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away see and it I must lay quiet for just a little while now remember and who is listening to this tape you might see such a change in my ministry right away dropping back not going up dropping back we're right at the age now and it can't be can't go any further we have to wait just a minute until this happens over here to catch up then the time comes but it's thoroughly identified he's speaking cryptically but I'm sure when we have ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church we can recognize what he's saying there he had to back away he had to decrease brother bradam had to decrease he even said so so that he could increase but where was he going to increase brothers and sisters in you in the bride body the mystical body of Jesus Christ that's where he's going to increase yes brother bam says we have to wait just a minute until this happens over here then the time comes but it's thoroughly identified and it was in his ministry but nowadays I just want to say it this way I'm sure that it's thoroughly identified in each and every one of our Lives Hallelujah as we heard as we heard we have this Blessed Assurance why cry speak the word and I'm sure that every one of us has experienced that in our lives if we speak the word many times things just happen in our lives and we're like how did that happen but else we have have to do is just say thank you Lord because every good gift comes from above it comes from the Lord everything that happens in our lives is because he's chosen for it to happen Amen brother bradam oh my I don't know how I did this and countdown paragraph 175 he says now look I've said some pretty rough things about airplane automobile remember they are horsepower too all of it is horsepower amen the church is just moving up holy ghost power is the holy ghost that we're justified by yes says you ministers know that don't you the Holy Ghost sanctifies us the Holy Ghost fills us amen the Holy Ghost gives us rapturing faith see as we move up and I'll just be completely honest with you I was looking for the quote where brother brandham says rapturing faith lies on those tapes but I believe this with all my heart we can say that we need the prophet to actually have a Rapture but I I I'll say it with all my heart brothers and sisters you can have the message all you want books and tapes but until you get the Holy Ghost in your life you will not have a Rapture there will not be a change of our bodies without the rapture without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives I mean we will not have a Rapture but the way we get the Rapture the way we get the Holy Ghost is through the message of the hour but it can't just be books and tapes it can't just be an association or a membership it's got to be the life of Jesus Christ Living out through us because when we eat the book the message of the hour we become the book the message of the hour and the message of the hour is literally Christ Jesus himself to this world Hallelujah the prophet said I must decrease John the Baptist said I must decrease so that Jesus Christ can increase amen William brandham said it too there won't be two of us standing here at the same time if what's happening is what I think is happening there won't be two of us standing here at the same time and we know sure sure enough he preached the seals he preached a few couple years later and the Lord took them off the scene but why so that we could come to know him ourselves Hallelujah the way that the prophet of God got to know him himself we can't put it off on anybody else it's got to be ourselves doing the harder work it's got to be ourselves dying out to ourselves every single day we have got to be willing to decrease so that he can increase it can't be me plus him he won't share his glory with nobody right it's got to be him and him alone talking a little bit about rapturing Faith this morning it's a little bit maybe of a sideline just to get us maybe setting the background for where I want to get to maybe pick up from where we left off last week brothers and sisters it's going home time amen all of the signs around demonstrate that this is not a place fit for the Bride of Jesus Christ right amen there's so many things that are going on in this world that we don't even know about that are already taking place they're already happening they're already being instigated all the these discussions the envoys going to the Middle East and talking about things all of that stuff that's happening what are they really talking about who knows I don't want to get into conspiracy things but what I do want to say is this world is coming together in one and so are the Bride of Jesus Christ so are all of the things in heaven that we read from that scripture this morning in Ephesians 1 chap 1:1 in dispensation of the fullness of times we have seen the dispensation of the fullness of times all of the church ages have happened brother bradam in the future home even says that the leoan church age is over it's gone it's done but we know that there's a blending there's some people that are still in the lean Church age if you are this morning brothers and sisters I want to say come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins the leoan church age is going to go through it's going to go through not good but the Bride of Jesus Christ she's given the word he's given the entire mystery having made known unto us the mystery of his will what's his will it's his word amen his will is his word amen and we know that he esteems his word greater than his name and it's beautiful when we can look at that as the Bride of Jesus Christ because we know that that's the truth and when he's really made himself known to us personally that is really our desire is his word not just his name we want his word could you imagine a wife marrying a husband and saying and it happens in this world we know it some people will get married and say oh I've got his name that's all in jesus' name the whole entire denominational world is saying in jesus' name in jesus' name and sure enough there's power in jesus' name we know brother brandham talked about the witch doctors levitating the table and and they said you know in the name of the president or all these different things and he just let them know that there was only one name that had the ability to over power those spirits that were levitating that table in jesus' name that table Came Crashing Down many people want Jesus to be their God but they don't want him to be their lord in order for him to have full preeminence we esteem his word above his name amen and we recognize that's where the power is many people will say oh my that's Old Testament Customs that's another tradition from some other time but is it brother brandham said it very clearly the Garment that pertains to a man shouldn't be worn by a woman there's a reason why we don't cut our hair because the word of God says that's the female's covering amen amen out of 56 raising Gus's daughter brother bam says now our lord Jesus was a very busy man when he was here on Earth he was in greatly in demand he never stayed in one place but just a little bit at a time then he would go somewhere else they persuaded him to stay in the city different places stay with us you could only imagine that we would want to do the same stay with us Fellowship excuse me spend some time they persuaded him to stay in the city different places stay with us but he said I've got to go to this other city for that's what I've been sent for he didn't stay in one city but just a day or maybe an hour or two at a time and performed a miracle leaving the rest of his meeting for his disciples that was to follow him now we find him a few days before this he had before this great things he had done and just a few hours before the instant that were speaking of he'd been crossing a sea tired weary virtue had gone out of him people had been healed he'd been preaching the gospel and on his road across the sea over to the land of gadera he got so tired and we till he laid down in the back end of the boat some of them had fixed a little pillow back there because they loved him and when they was rowing and the sails going and all the apostles moving with their oares he'd gotten so sleepy so tired and War see he was a man in one sense he was God in another sense amen he was man in flesh in spirit he was God he says we just went through that so we know the story very well he's on the ocean and we know Satan was saying now I've got you now I'm going to put you under brother bam goes on to say the Dove came on the lamb and they two became one the lamb was one creature the dove was another creature and when the Dove and the man the Dove and the lamb United together God was manifested in the flesh that's right you can see where this is going and now he's manifested in your flesh by being adopted Sons and Daughters to the kingdom of God Amen not just by association not because I was born into a family that believes the message of the hour not just because my family did great things for the prophit of God not just because we we we attend and we're H H fundamental members of a church that believes this message of the hour he says he's manifested in your flesh by being adopted Sons and Daughters to the kingdom of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's right and you become joint HS with the Lord Jesus Christ oh Church you got the power if you got the faith to use it with that's right yes so I want to say this morning brothers and sisters the prophet of God God through the prophet said you've got the power to use it amen if you got the faith amen so of course that just poses the question how do I get that Faith how does faith come Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God Amen we can't stay away from service and expect the faith to be activated we cannot not feed on the word throughout the week and expect the word to not actually be activated to not get that level of faith if we want that level of Faith we've got to be in constant communion with the Lorden I thought it was so good we were talking about this and brother Emanuel he made a point he said you know we should have such a prayer life such a life of prayer that our daily lives get in the way of our conversation with god and I thought isn't that true isn't that exactly the way it should be in the life of a Believer because the word of God says that we should pray without ceasing how can we be on our knees 24/7 we can't do it but what we do have is a consciousness of God and we have a a conversation we're always fellowshipping with the Lord saying oh Lord see the situation see the circumstances oh Lord watch that brother watch that sister oh look at this person they have no idea that you even exist Lord make yourself real to that person we're always constantly in prayer and then every once in a while we have to pick up the phone and answer a call for work or maybe we have to get behind the the steering wheel of a 737 and go fly somewhere or or maybe we just have to deal with our children Our Lives get in the way of our natural life gets in the way of our prayers brothers and sisters but it doesn't mean that we can't have that relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ let's turn over to Ephesians chapter 3 Ephesians chapter 3 it's talking about our age the day in which we live in recognizing our position not just our position maybe in the church and in the body and maybe in our families but our position in Christ our position in the church ages our position in in the dispensation of the times of the ages in Ephesians 3:1 says for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Jesus Christ for you Gentiles so now we know he's speaking directly to us if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to your word how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery now that's where it gets a little bit funny because only Revelation only comes by the Spirit by the holy spirit in our lives and we're going to get into this on Wednesday in in the introduction it's actually chapter one of the exposition of the seven Church ages brother Bram you could go ahead and read on I stopped purposely last Wednesday because it's such an important topic brother bradam says Revelation true Revelation to the True Believer can never ever be underestimated we've got to recognize we have got to have Revelation every single one of us it's not just for our parents it's not just for the deacons or the trustees or the the song leader or grandma or Grandpa it's got to be our own Revelation it's got to be Christ in us the hope of glory verse three how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery what mystery he says as I wrote a four in few words whereby when ye read he's talking about you now when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit amen now we might stop there and say well that's given to the Holy Apostles and the prophets and sure enough it was but for why for the perfecting of the Saints so that they could be perfected so that we could catch the true Revelation by bringing a pure word we could get a pure revelation of our own verse six says that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel I think it's just wonderful brothers and sisters and I I want to say that we have been given the ability through the message of the hour to be able to understand what Paul's knowledge in the mystery of Christ was amen because brother Bram who preached the same thing that Paul preached brought the message that Christ gave to him through Revelation through inspiration Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ being God not not the Oneness where we're regenerated by water baptism and not the trinitarian doctrine father son Holy Ghost titles but right down the middle is what brother bradam says right in the middle of both of those is what he's bringing that's what he brought to the world out of 1960 as the eagle stirreth paragraph 258 he says that woman sitting there rubbing her eyes with a red hat on sitting right there do you believe Jesus heard you when you asked him to heal them sinus headache Brothers and sisters this is the story about the prophet of God but what I want to say today and we all know this but sometimes we need our our Pure Minds to be stirred up by way of remembrance sometimes we need to recognize that the same God that was there in that meeting that we're reading about is the same God that's right here this morning and he has every single intention of meeting every single need that you have a desire of in your heart but the only way it's going to come is through the Revelation that what I'm speaking to you is actually true that's right that woman sitting there rubbing her eyes with a red hat on sitting right there do you believe Jesus heard you when you asked him to heal them sinus headache do you believe he heard you I just want to say that again do you believe he heard you amen because brothers and sisters he will meet the need in your heart supernaturally whereby you will say the same thing that the king of Assyria said how does he know the words that are being spoken in my bed chamber how does he know the secret desires of my heart I'll tell you what I don't but he does and if you want to hear an answer from him all you've got to do is pull on the word and he will answer you it's the same God do you believe he heard you you was praying about it wasn't you if that's right stand up on your feet if that's the truth put up your hand if I don't know you you don't know me put up the other hand both hands sister says I seen you before ma'am I've been in revivals before you've been in my revivals before but I mean I don't know you no all right all right now they have ceased you can go home and be well right here in this building brothers and sisters we witnessed a woman do the same thing but it wasn't someone saying those words it was in the midst of a song service right in the middle of of a song service on a regular boring Wednesday night when everyone is weary and tired while some people were still straggling in this sister got the desire in her heart to stand up and receive her healing for the breast cancer that she was battling in the name of Jesus Christ what did she do everyone else was sitting there worshiping nice and calm and quiet but what did she do she rose up and said amen be it unto me according to thy words and guess what happened she was healed she didn't have breast cancer anymore and if anybody wants her phone number I can give it to you and she'll tell you right she loves to tell about what the Lord has done for her in her life when you hear that voice brothers and sisters that just says stand up and rejoice don't hesitate jump up in the name of Jesus Christ he'll grant you your desires it's the same one am it's not a different God amen it's a different building it's a different year it's a different maybe maybe maybe environment in the world but it's the same God and it's the same word Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Satan wants us to believe that it's oh it's some old Dodie Grandpa he's up in heaven and he can't hear you you got to come according to the the catechism or whatever it is according to the church the Traditions you've got to do all these different things he doesn't even listen he doesn't hear you how many people have prayed and you haven't had the prayer answered the way that you want God will God will answer the prayer but Satan will say no he doesn't love you he didn't hear your prayer he's not going to answer your prayer he's already answered your prayer remember Daniel Prayed and it was 21 days before the the the the angel came to him but he said I had to fight through Devils to get to you the Prince of Persia he didn't want me coming to see you don't don't don't get disheartened don't get discouraged brothers and sisters when When you pray pray in the spirit get in the spirit brother brandham says and then pray don't just go on your knees and push the vending machine buttons and say I've paid my ties now I need this this this this and this because it's not going to happen the way that you think but if you can get in the spirit amen and come to him and tell him thank you Lord thank you for what you've done for me thank you for your goodness thank you for your your love and your understanding your compassion thank you for giving me salvation thank you for a word that never changes thank you Lord begin to worship him get in the spirit and then talk to him and you know what will happen brothers and sisters it won't be you talking it'll be his spirit that starts to express himself through you and when that happens look out because you're going to see results this is not about trying to activate God to do something for us he doesn't clown for nobody but if you want to see results in your life if you want to really see the third pull come to pass just get in the spirit just remain in the spirit and when Satan comes around and tries to throw a distraction in front of you just rebuke him when he comes around and tries to remind you about that pain in the past that that person did to you or your family just rebuke them Satan wants to give us any distraction that we'll grab on to he'll hang up a shiny thing and he'll say see that remember that don't you see that doesn't that make you mad doesn't it make you angry doesn't it make you afraid doesn't it make you upset doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it no it doesn't in the name of Jesus Christ we've got to be willing to be that strong brothers and sisters say I rebuke you in Jesus name amen it's the same Jesus it's the same word he goes on to say I want to ask you people something what did that woman touch here's my hand I never remember of she's been in meetings now would you say how about somebody up there in the balcony down here maybe in a meeting sometime before I would never know who you were only thing I know that you just you was just here at the meeting and there she is she touched something and what did I said a while ago that Pillar of Fire don't you you see it how many has got that picture of it now brother do you have the picture can you pop it up here on the screen I meant to actually talk about this and sometimes we just get so many distractions I apologize hallu this is what he's talking about the pillar of fire uh no no the pillar of fire over top of brother Bram do we have that one if not it's okay I just thought it would go good with this quote but just it's okay sometimes the visual is good I would say if anybody's interested maybe just look it up or I could send it out I'll probably just send it out anyway it'll be good to see I said a while ago that Pillar of Fire don't you see it how many has got the picture of it now they got it here at the meeting now it looks like the pillar of Fire doesn't it and now the life of it what does it produce the same that Pillar of Fire produces the same that same life that was actually healing people in that meeting that's what brother Bram was talking about here the life in that Pillar of Fire that Pillar of Fire and you know if we had the ability to with our own eyes we would see that Pillar of Fire here right now in this building right now but we're not looking for a pillar of fire we're looking for the word that's what we've been instructed to look for otherwise we would have been instructed to look for that Pillar of Fire everywhere you go examine every room you enter every vehicle you go into every place that you encounter in this world look for that Pillar of Fire but we were not brother bradam was given the ability to see it right we know that Saul of Tarsus he was given the ability to see it and even the people that were around him they never saw it Supernatural light that Pillar of Fire Brothers you don't have to worry about it it's it's not a big deal but it looks like you've already got it anyway so I'll just linger here and we'll we'll bring it up you know I I thought for the longest time this just looked like a Halo and maybe it some people would call it that but you know the prophet for our day for our age he called it the pillar of fire and we know that it was a pillar of fire that got right between the children of Israel when they had left Egypt and it was a pillar of Fire by night and it was a cloud by day and we've been given the ability I don't know if it came up earlier um but he brought up the picture of the cloud we've been given a cloud and we've been given a pillar of fire he's the same yesterday today and forever but that Pillar of Fire the only supernatural being that was ever recorded by the camera l amen verified by Mr Lacy in the United States and even today in 2023 it hangs in Washington Hall of Fame of Supernatural photos I think that's what it's called brother bam says what did it produce the same you can just leave it up there Brothers don't take it down what did it produce the same he says not me now it it what what does it produce the same works that it did when it was in the son of God now it's in adopted Sons and Daughters of God Hallelujah by the grace of the true Son of God what I'm trying to bring this morning brothers and sisters is even though we look at that picture and think that's wonderful it's magnificent that that there was that Supernatural event think about this what about your Supernatural event what about that Pillar of Fire in your life amen it's for a purpose and the purpose of it is it's doing something for us yes and and I'm going to get into the quote a little bit but I'm just going to get ahead of myself just because I feel it coming on what does it do it burns out all the sin in our lives it burns out all of our old nasty nature all of the old man it burns it out that Pillar of Fire is the life of Jesus Christ it's the way that he's chosen to portray himself to this world otherwise that picture would never have been taken and recorded it would never have been something that we can look at at now we don't look at that picture and say oh yeah that's who we worship that's you know what no way that's not at all what it is I remember the first time that I came into the upper room building I saw that picture on the wall there that picture and I said ah there it is they're worshiping a man I know it I knew it until I sat down and started to listen to the word that was being spoken the quotes that were being quoted this life of Jesus Christ that was being expressed by this man right here he was saying don't look at me look at him I've got to decrease so that he can increase yes so we know it very clearly that if we see someone that's esteeming this man to be equal with Christ there's something wrong if there's any other man that's esteemed to be equal with Christ there's something wrong because this man was sent to introduce Christ that's why he has that Supernatural photo it's good brother you can take it down but you got to see it if anybody has any questions I'm sure you could find it online very easy I'm happy to share it with you too it's so important for us to recognize even though we can look back and say that was fantastic it's such a beautiful picture to see God expressing himself with the man on Earth we've got that documented Supernatural photo what about your Supernatural brothers and sisters don't look for signs and wonders that's all going to follow it will follow there will be Vindication it will follow you all the days of your life because we have that Blessed assurance that if we put him first seek ye first the kingdom of God Amen then all of the other things they'll just follow the supernatural will follow you'll speak the word and it will come to pass because you won't speak a word that's going to be vain you won't speak a word that's according to the lust of your flesh right James said it very clearly many times we ask but we ask a Miss because we ask upon the lust of of our flesh our fleshly desires I want more money I want a bigger house I want a nicer car maybe I want a bigger church maybe I want better clothes maybe I want a better job maybe I want a better degree maybe maybe maybe I want I want I want what about the word of God put the word of God first brothers and sisters children when you're going to school put the word of God first and see if he won't bless you in your studies brothers and sisters put the word of God first in your homes and see if he won't bless your marriages see if he won't take that Pillar of Fire and burn out all of that nasty old Badger nature in our lives and allow us to submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God and then say oh yeah I'm the husband or oh yeah I'm the wife many times we want to be the husband I'm the husband or or I'm the wife I've got my position but not willing to submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God because brothers and sisters if we've got the Holy Ghost in our lives if my wife has the holy ghost in her life and I treat her nasty who am I treating nasty sometimes it can even be in a joke form we know that many a justest many a truth sory is spoken in justest right we can really hurt people's feelings by joking in our family we don't subscribe to that it's not good joking is fine it's fine to make jokes but not at other people's expense I would say this I don't believe that's the Holy Spirit am the holy spirit is going to edify the holy spirit is going to encourag I don't know why we went there sorry about the puff again 1961 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Bram says somebody in the audience something happened in the audience I have to just follow it I I See the Light it's a vision it just moves out there's no doubt in my mind brothers and sisters I'm sure you could visualize it too that while this prophet of God was preaching he would see that Pillar of Fire just go out over the audience and we know that he even said so but could you just visualize it could you imagine it that Pillar of Fire seeing it he says I do not know you as I have said and Jesus met a woman in a little panoramic like this and he spoke to her a few minutes to her to find the secret of her heart and he told her what her trouble was and she said quickly sir I perceive that you're a prophet we know that when Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things Jesus said I am he that speaks I'm just going to pause there I want to say this brothers and sisters when you hear when you hear the words speaking directly to your heart directly to your thoughts directly to your conversation directly to maybe whatever it is and you can see that God is moving it is truly God it's the same God that he's talking about here it's the same one that went and sat down by the the well and waited for that ill-famed woman it's the very same God that very same Pillar of Fire that we saw in the picture the very same one that went out over this audience is the very same one that wants to speak to our needs we have the ability to be delivered from our situations amen he says and she ran into the City and and said come see a man who's told me what's wrong what the things that she did said isn't that the very Messiah I just want to say it brothers and sisters it's not about any Minister it's not about any Ministry it's about Jesus Christ yes it is because we know that he'll speak through a mule he'll speak through a donkey it's not about a great one the only one that's great is Christ and he will use any Minister anywhere if we have a genuine desire in our heart because really what is the beauty of the church it's not the pastor no clearly it's not the pastor the beauty of the church is the character of the people and if you've got a beautiful church you've got the character of Jesus Christ Living out through the people he says now lady this afternoon me not knowing you you not knowing me or then if the Holy Spirit Remains the Same that was in Jesus is in us because God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself see he was a Son of God and we're adopted Sons and Daughters of God and if he will tell me something that you have done something that you have planned on doing something that you're here for a sickness or somebody you want to be prayed for or something would it make you believe and have faith amen yes would the rest of the audience believe you know the woman anybody all right I just think it's amazing now there's no climax to that I'm going to bring the climax because I want to say this and I know it for sure because I've experienced it when you have the minister ministering when you have someone preaching and suddenly he starts to touch on things that you've been talking about stuff that you've been dealing with conversations that you've had in private that is the same God talking to you amen we don't need him to come and do great signs and wonders have a healing campaign what more do we need than to have the Lord Jesus come and speak to you directly about your situation my we know that for brother bradam to say it that hey you know what would it do to you if if I could tell you something that the Lord has told me about you but brothers and sisters what does it do for you when God speaks to you individually amen Psalms 138 verse 2 says I will worship toward thy Holy Temple and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy Truth for thou has has magnified Thy word above all thy name and if he has magnified his word above his name what do we do brothers and sisters we were having a conversation about this the other night I thought it was so beautiful and I I even so much has said it I've got to hit on this because it's so important brothers and sisters what do we do that's what David said that he does and we know that Christ was speaking through David but that's what he did what do we do what do we do are we willing to subdue our flesh for his word or or do we say no no no no no no no I I I I just can't in this circumstance in this situation I've got my thing and I've Got My Flesh and I'm stuck in this body now I just have to let myself fly a little bit and then I'll come back and make it all better again or do we say no enough I'm going to stop this I'm going to allow his word to be esteemed greater in my life than the desires of My Flesh than the way I've lived my entire life are we subduing our flesh brothers and sisters are we willing to esteem his word greater than my opinion greater than my opinion oh my I know we all have opinions and some of them are very strong opinions but does that opinion line up with the word of God cuz if it doesn't he's saying Let It Go amen right line up with his word we know that when brother brownon went across the the the the the curtain of time went beyond the curtain of time what did he hear he heard them saying keep pressing on and he at the end of it in in beyond the curtain of time message he said I'm more convinced than ever that I want to stay straight on that word and he says stay straight on that word am uphold his word brothers and sisters greater than any of our circumstances and I want to say it this way I I don't want to but I I felt led to if we don't uphold his word greater than our circumstances then what spirit is influencing us what Spirit are we under is it a spirit of fear is it a spirit of Doubt yeah there's so many different Spirits in this world that we're contending with and be be sure that the the all The Guns of hell are trained on the Bride of Jesus Christ we're going to have an onslaught a Siege if it were possible but it's not possible for the Bride of Jesus Christ but what Spirit do we have in our lives what what spiritual influence are we under is it the Holy Spirit the same Pillar of Fire that we saw in that picture it has to be yes because that spirit that spirit that Pillar of Fire will burn out all of the sin in the old man I don't even know if we're going to have time to get into the quotes are we okay for a few minutes it on we have to become a new creature in Christ Jesus or do we have a desire just to do our will you know one of the things that can actually manifest in our lives is we just become critical of everything we can become that way we can become judgmental of everyone amen but think about how Christ was I just want to underscore this one and highlight this one how is Christ he he ran with the Sinners and the publicans his disciples ate with unwashed hands they were not the mainstream Christian people that that most of the world thought that maybe he should be with and who was it that that got him upset was it the woman that was thrown at him that was caught in the act of adultery he said to her woman where are thy accusers because I've already dealt with them whoever's got no sin in your life go ahead throw the first Stone right and they all recognized whoa wait a second we're righteous people we can't do that so they dropped their stones and left he said woman where's your accusers just go and sin no more that's what he told her didn't judge her didn't try to put her out didn't didn't do all the nasty things that that the badger skinn humans try and do sometimes but the Christ that was there in that flesh is the Christ that's here today in our flesh brothers and sisters yes and he doesn't judge everyone on Amen Let the word judge let the word do the Sorting let the word be the judge amen but the only people that he got mad at was the most Pious people the most religious ones the most I could go on and on you know what I mean yes it was the most religious people of the day those are the ones that he got mad at those are the ones that he actually told them who they were and boy they didn't like it but you know why because he didn't have the spirit of love and compassion and it was that that time that era that age where he said how will the world know that you love me you have love one for another you're willing to forgive right we've got to have Grace in our lives so I just couldn't help but think you know as we're as we're getting ready to cross over because one way or the other we're going to cross over we're either going to go by the way of the Grave or we're going to go by the way of the sky it's inevitable what character do we have in our lives today whose life are we representing is it truly the Holy Ghost in our lives or is it just the Holy Ghost sometimes and us the rest of the time when we're truly surrendered to the Holy Ghost in our lives to Jesus Christ himself the message of the hour then we're going to live that life we're going to demonstrate that life people are going to say what is it about you there's something different about you and I'm not talking about people in the grocery store I'm going to say your husband I'm going to say your wife Hallelujah your children your family members the ones that know you the most the closest they're going to see a change in your life Hallelujah you're not going to be the same person you're going to be a new creature in Christ Jesus cuz remember brothers and sisters who we are right now here today if we were to die leaving this building that's exactly who we would be right over there we'll step from one dimension to the next we're not going to become different people because we died now suddenly the message of the hour is going to take and transform my character and I'm going to be this great glorious person if you were all critical down there you're going to be all critical over there right if you're a secret sinner here you're going to be a secret sinner there amen but if you're dying to yourself every single day he's going to say come home my child well done thou good and faithful servant because you have done all that you need to do now enter ye into the joys of the Lord welcome death doesn't change our nature brothers and sisters it only changes our dwelling place it's only going to change our our address our our postal code that's the only thing that's going to happen we need to make sure that we know whose Spirit we are under the influence of whose spirit is actually living out through US brother bradam he he talks about this is where I really wanted to get to today at a f future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride paragraph 237 he says if you've got eternal life there is only one form that's God and you are an expressed attribute see I know we read this last week but I just want to underscore it and highlight it I want to remind us stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance if you've got eternal life you always were yes you didn't just get it one day no you were always Eternal amen if you've got eternal life there's only one form and that's God and you are an expressed attribute and I'm going to put my words in there you're an expressed attribute of God every single age had an expression of his attributes we can look back at every single age and say yeah that was a man of God that was a man of God all those men of God but what about today where's the man of God today it's those ones that recognize they've got eternal life he says see if you you're not you're not going to be there anyhow I think it's pretty strong but it's true he said it if you're not an attribute of God you're not going to be there amen it's not going to happen no if you're not you're not going to be there anyhow no man can come except my father has drawn him see which pass passes away all these old things but these things don't so it speaks of Eternity the Holy Ghost is eternal then you are in eternity where you was all the time amen but you've just recognized what's happened Hallelujah there has to be a recognition of what's happened brothers and sisters not that you became Eternal not that you just got eternal life that you recognize you are always had eternal life so if you've always had eternal life who can steal it from you Hallelujah this is the other side of it now I I've been maybe a little bit hard in the beginning of the service but now I want to say brothers and sisters you can't be lost if you have eternal life you cannot be lost if you have eternal life Satan can't come and take it away from you because he never gave it to you he can't have a part of God he can't touch you then you are in eternity where you was all the time but you've just recognized what happened he says see you were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you thank you Lord it's no accident that you have the grandparents you have it's no accident that you've got the great grandparents that you have it's no accident that you live where you live it's no accident that you are where you are you're an expressed attribute of [Music] God he says and he made made an earth to take you out of and to make you a human being and this is just so beautiful I just hope this brings us rest today brothers and sisters it did for me when I was studying it he says and sin come along and perverted his way but you come anyhow amen but you was lost with the world so he come and redeemed you thank you Lord the expressed attribute and just for the record this is going to be my words the expressed attribute is not this flesh no it's not this body that we live in it's not this pest house brother brandham called it many times I live my life thinking that one of these days I'm just going to pray enough and I'm going to read enough and I'm going to listen enough and this past house will stop being a past house this past house is going to be a past house until we lay it down but what's your desire what's our desire today amen is it to make it right with the Lord is it to allow his Spirit to live out through us he says but you was lost with the world so he come and redeemed you the expressed attribute and also redeems this Earth by the same way did you ever think about it in in the Garden of Gethsemane I never did I always thought that the blood that that came the very first drop of blood that was redeeming blood was for me in my sin and maybe it was but just reading this studying this it made me think maybe that drop of blood that fell like sweat from jesus' brow when he was praying when the disciples abandoned him and were sleeping they couldn't stay awake long enough to pray that blood that dropped could potentially have been there redeeming this Earth changing the world shaking the the foundations of hell and of death and of the Grave those first drops I've always just maybe it's just me being a little crazy but I just thought that it was it was it was it was the blood was always just there to redeem the Bride of Jesus Christ and that's all but brother bradam says very clearly that God says through the prophet that this was to redeem the Earth also this was Redeeming the Earth by the same way he says then his purpose rolls on see oh hallelujah oh that does me so much good just to think what lays ahead if you listen to this message like I recommended 1964 802 brothers and sisters he really explains what we're heading for how we're going to a place where there's going to be no storms there's going to be no death there's going to be no germs there's going to be no fear or anger or frustrations he goes through and lists and labels all of it there's going to be no little Mounds he talks about where we have Graves of people that have died amen there's going to be no death there it's just going to be life paragraph 239 getting into our scripture now today right at the end of the service he says now in Ephesians 1:10 it's called now if you're putting it down Ephesians 1:10 it's called not a dispensation not the seventh day it's called the fullness of time and brother bam talks about it he calls it the end of the week or the eighth day but he says there can't be an eighth day Eighth Day is eternity there can only be seven days in a week and when you hit the seventh day you go back to the first day and that's what happens but to the Bride of Jesus Christ to the truly elected she goes on to the eighth day she goes into eternity that's what happens to us and that's what he's saying here he says it's called the fullness of time and when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulfilled and I just think it's important for us to remember brothers and sisters the fullness of time has come God sent a prophet to call a bride of his own choosing and that bride has been called of his own choosing he took the prophet off the scene and now here she is here she stands waiting at the altar for him waiting to go away and you know what's going to happen one of these moments he says when there's no more time than you go into eternity after the seventh Church age is over and it is Luther's age is over Methodist age is over Pentecostal age is over and now you go into what eternity no more sevens no more threes no more other they're in eternity where where there is no such time as numbers and times and things amen oh my you see it now maybe it sounds a little bit confusing brothers and sisters but he gets into it here what he's talking about is that you're already seated in Heavenly places you're already in eternity the blending of the ages is happening as you recognize where you are when you have his Spirit he says or after time has been fulfilled all sin is gone taken away at the Millennium at the great white Throne judgment a type by by the Holy Ghost after the world is on fire and baptized it's baptism of holy fire from heaven all sin is gone all germs is gone all Devils is gone all Temptations is gone all evil is gone type now then what does God do he can sit upon the Earth see because all sin is gone that's the same thing he does when he gives you the Holy Ghost baptism with [Music] fire he can come and dwell with you and we can sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but how does that work because I'm sure that everyone would be saying brother Barry my my butt's getting a little sore here I'm seated right here in this church just be glad we don't have wooden pews right but here we find ourselves stuck in this in this place in this pest house in this building yes but if you believe this word brothers and sisters the word says you're already seated in Heavenly places amen in Christ Jesus amen and that's what he's saying here today that's the same thing he does when he gives you the Holy Ghost baptism with fire he can come and dwell with you and we can sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus because we are already in him not we will be we are now sitting in Christ Jesus how do we get into it by one Holy Ghost baptism brothers and sisters there's no other way no other truth and no other life we can't say that I believe the message of the hour therefore I get the Holy Ghost no you have to repent you have to repent for the remission of your sins then you have to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of those sins and then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and so long as you're willing to come the way the word lays out you will get this Holy Ghost then you're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus brother bradam says how do we get into it by one Holy Ghost baptism by one Spirit we're all baptized into Christ which we are now won't be in Christ we are he is the great spiritual King over the spirit that's in us because we were in him at the beginning amen my I'll call the musicians I have one more quote that I want to read I could say so much brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us to get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives amen when we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives it's not some intangible being being some other spiritual manifestation it's Jesus Christ himself the literal Life of Christ will begin to live out through Us and how will we know the old man will die we'll have a new nature we will actually Express his attributes to us why will that happen because you are an attribute of Christ maybe stand with me this morning as we close brother brandom says the fullness of time has come after time has been fulfilled it's out of the same message future home says sin is gone after the world's baptism after the world's baptism makes it a fit place yes no sickness no germs no Thorns no thistles no death no sorrow no heartaches no old age nothing to right represent death nothing wrong all right nothing natural Eternal then his attribute is expressed because it was there first to begin with that's what he thought and brother Bram he he illustrates it on the Blackboard I just want to say it this morning brothers and sisters one of these days this world is going to be burned over by fire and I'm not saying that to make us afraid I'm saying that to encourage us because somewhere else in the message of the hour brother Bram says before one of those bombs goes off the bride goes home in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen but don't look for an Earthly manifestation I think this should happen before that can take place because if you do that you're going to get it wrong just work on getting the holy ghost in your life and if you've got the holy ghost in your life just keep feeding him don't starve him feed him keep feeding him we can get hungry in our our bodies and we become a little bit of a different person and you know how do we go when we starve the Holy Ghost In Our Lives he'll always remain the same but can you imagine this flesh will rise up and this flesh will give way to that that other spirit that other nature the old man won't die and we've got to feed the Holy Ghost in our lives so long as we do that the devil won't have any Victory the old man won't be able to rise up there'll come a place brothers and sisters where you will break the spiritual sound barrier and you will just go and all of the old man will just stay behind you it won't be able to catch you the Devils won't even be able to find you brother bradam said it in about three different places that Satan he won't even be able to find you you'll be so hid away in Christ and even if he does find you he won't want any part of you because he'll know that you truly are a manifested expression of the Lord Jesus Christ a manifested attribute and Satan won't want no part of you God bless you today sorry for going over a little bit let's just about gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your word so thankful for the message of the hour so thankful that we can be Sons and Daughters Lord that you have called a bride that you have called of your own choosing father Lord we just want to commit each life represented here today into your hands as we go our separate ways father this morning I pray Lord that you
