[31:43] of it all, we shall not forget to thank
[31:45] you, Father. Bless the musicians and the
[31:48] singing goes forth. Bless the preaching
[31:50] of the word and the listening, Father.
[31:52] Every aspect of this service, Father,
[31:54] may it be pleasing to you. We love and
[31:55] appreciate you, Father, in Jesus
[31:57] Christ's name. Father, even as the Titan

[35:27] Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah.

[35:49] trumpet.

[35:57] heart
[35:59] salvation.
[36:01] Behold, behold he
[36:06] [Music]
[36:08] shining like the sun. I have to trump
[36:12] before
[36:14] your voice
[36:17] to believe. For out of hill salvation
[36:23] comes.
[36:27] Amen. You may have receipts. Brother
[36:30] Don, if you can bring your special
[36:43] Amen. Lord bless you all.
[36:46] I pray this blesses someone else as much
[36:48] as it blessed me when it came to me
[36:50] earlier this week. It's called sweet
[36:53] communion.
[36:55] I wake to the sunlight, but brighter
[36:58] still
[36:59] are the thoughts that the spirit begins
[37:01] to fill. Not just in my study or
[37:05] kneeling in prayer, but all through the
[37:08] morning, his voice is there. I'm washing
[37:12] the dishes. I'm walking the street. Yet
[37:15] heaven is whispering, gentle and sweet.
[37:18] A verse from the Bible, a line from the
[37:21] word becomes so alive like a song I've
[37:25] heard. The message I read just the night
[37:28] before opens again as I walk through the
[37:32] door.
[37:33] The seed that he planted now becomes
[37:36] blooms in my heart with colors and truth
[37:40] of the heavenly part.
[37:42] I'm driving to work and my heart takes
[37:44] flight on thoughts of his mercy, his
[37:48] power, his light. The traffic may slow,
[37:52] but his spirit flows free and feeds me
[37:55] with things that no eye can see.
[38:00] The way he weaves it is perfect and true
[38:03] and sure. Each thought is a promise,
[38:06] comforting and pure. They anchor my
[38:09] steps. They brighten my tone. They make
[38:12] even strangers feel like my own.
[38:16] The day's little trials don't trouble me
[38:18] long. For my heart haunts a steady,
[38:21] unending song. Not made by the world,
[38:25] nor fading away, but born of the spirit
[38:29] and fresh every day. So walking or
[38:32] working at rest or at pace, I'm living
[38:35] each moment in his embrace. The word is
[38:38] my bread and his thoughts are my wine
[38:42] and they turn common hours into moments
[38:44] divine.
[38:47] And when night has come and the stars
[38:50] fill the skies, the thoughts still are
[38:52] blooming where his seed lies. For this
[38:55] is the life the bride loves to live,
[38:58] receiving each thought that our Lord
[39:01] longs to give. Lord bless you all.
[39:05] [Applause]
[39:15] Amen. What a blessing. If you please
[39:18] please stand with me as we change the
[39:19] order of the service,
[39:26] just the the course.
[39:29] Amen. We've all been there where that
[39:32] one anchor is all that holds us. Amen.
[39:35] The songs I believe this the writer was
[39:37] so inspired when he wrote the song. It
[39:38] always it's always a powerful meaning, a
[39:39] powerful feeling every time we sing it.
[39:41] Amen.
[39:43] We've all been there.
[39:45] Oh, the anchor
[39:48] hold.
[39:52] Though the ship
[39:55] is battered,
[39:58] [Music]
[40:00] the anger
[40:02] holds.
[40:07] Though the sails
[40:09] are to
[40:14] I have fallen
[40:19] on my knees
[40:22] as I
[40:25] life's raging seas
[40:28] the anger
[40:31] in spite
[40:35] in spite of The storm.
[40:39] The anchor holds.
[40:41] The anchor
[40:43] holds.
[40:48] Though the ship is bashful. That's our
[40:51] testimony this morning. Holy anor
[40:57] [Music]
[40:59] sails.
[41:01] Though the sails.
[41:03] Aren't we a blessed people this morning?
[41:07] Oh, I have fallen
[41:12] all night high.
[41:15] Oh, as I face
[41:18] life's rage,
[41:21] the anor
[41:27] in spite of the storm.
[41:31] One more time.
[41:33] Holy anchor.
[41:36] [Music]

[45:19] of my heavenly
[45:23] home.
[45:24] Praise God.
[45:27] I am going
[45:30] home.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. Welcome each
[45:37] and everyone to the house of the Lord.
[45:39] My goodness, what an honor and a
[45:41] privilege it is to gather together in
[45:43] his name freely knowing that we don't
[45:45] have to suffer persecution as some do.
[45:49] This morning we just have some prayer
[45:51] requests that uh I wanted to bring.
[45:54] Firstly, we wanted to bring a praise
[45:56] report to the body. Brother Peter uh
[46:00] wanted to bring a praise report. He
[46:01] says, "I'm thanking the Lord for healing
[46:03] me of malaria."
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:12] [Applause]
[46:15] He says, "I also want to thank the
[46:17] church for your prayers and for your
[46:19] encouraging words." He was just in Ghana
[46:22] and uh a mosquito must have got him. I
[46:26] guess we can say now, Brother Peter,
[46:28] you're truly Canadian.
[46:33] We're certainly thankful that we can
[46:34] bring praise reports instead of just a
[46:37] laundry list of needs to the Lord. I'd
[46:41] just like to continue to remember my
[46:43] mom, Sharon Clark, who's in the Peter
[46:46] Law Heath Center. She needs a touch from
[46:47] the Lord. want to pray for the Hebington
[46:50] family. Uh this young man, 37 years old,
[46:54] Jesse Hebington, has uh has uh a very
[46:58] grim prognosis, naturally speaking. I'm
[47:00] going to go and visit him after service,
[47:03] Lord willing, and uh hopefully have some
[47:05] words of encouragement for him.
[47:08] But uh
[47:10] if something doesn't change, he'll be
[47:12] going home in a matter of days. We
[47:15] certainly want to I just want to ask
[47:17] that we could remember these two
[47:18] requests and uh all those who are
[47:20] traveling. If you have a need this
[47:21] morning, maybe just defy gravity and
[47:23] make it known unto him by the way of an
[47:25] uplift hand as we go to him in prayer.
[47:28] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we are
[47:30] so thankful that we can gather together
[47:32] in your name according to your word.
[47:34] Where two or three are gathered, we know
[47:36] that you're there. So, Father, we
[47:38] welcome you here because we already
[47:40] declared this meeting to be in your name
[47:42] and there's many. Father, we're so
[47:45] thankful that we can come to you with
[47:47] our needs. But Lord, more than anything,
[47:49] we're so thankful that you are God, that
[47:52] we know you as our God. Father, we just
[47:55] want to thank you for the needs that you
[47:57] allow to happen in our lives, Lord.
[47:59] They're the the reason that we
[48:01] understand that you you have many
[48:04] attributes because of the needs that we
[48:06] have, Lord. the complex problems and
[48:08] situations that we just as humans can't
[48:11] figure out. We know that you're more
[48:13] than able to. So, Father, we just pray
[48:16] that you would meet each and every need
[48:17] that was made known unto you today by
[48:19] the way of an uplift hand. Father, we
[48:22] thank you for meeting those needs. Lord
[48:24] Jesus, we just want to remember my mom
[48:27] one more time, Sharon Clark. We thank
[48:29] you for touching her body. Thank you,
[48:32] Lord Jesus, that she is so willing to
[48:36] speak to you, Father. What an
[48:37] encouragement it is. We pray that you
[48:39] would just bring her comfort even now in
[48:42] that hospital. And Father, we just want
[48:45] to remember the Hebington family, Jesse
[48:47] Hebington. Lord, without a touch from
[48:50] you, he will be changing his location.
[48:52] Lord, we know that, Father, we can
[48:55] really never die, but we just change our
[48:57] location.
[48:59] Death is just a buggy, Lord. that's
[49:02] designed to take us from one dimension
[49:04] to another. And Father, we pray that you
[49:07] would just be with the Hebington family,
[49:08] be with Michelle and her children, Lord.
[49:11] And even Jesse as he prepares, Lord.
[49:14] Father, we just love you and we thank
[49:16] you, Lord. We pray for those who are
[49:19] traveling today. There's many from our
[49:21] midst who are gone. And it's amazing
[49:24] because you just bring more into our
[49:26] midst, Lord. Father, we thank you for
[49:29] the lives represented here. We pray that
[49:31] you would just watch over our travelers
[49:33] that are here, Lord, and be with those
[49:35] who are away. That you would just bless
[49:37] each one's time, Lord. And Father, now
[49:40] as we turn to your word, we pray that
[49:42] you would just be glorified in all
[49:43] that's said and done. Lord, we just ask
[49:46] all these things in Jesus Christ's name
[49:48] we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you,
[49:52] musicians.
[49:54] God bless you all. Well, if you have
[49:55] your Bibles, I would just like to read
[49:57] from Genesis and uh carry on in our our
[50:00] discussion
[50:02] around the uh covenant.
[50:05] I just cannot get away from the thought
[50:09] of the covenant. and uh we'll just I
[50:12] guess get into it. But out of Genesis
[50:15] chapter 17,
[50:20] this is when Abram,
[50:22] he still had not received a name change.
[50:26] He was still the old man.
[50:31] It's just beautiful how the Lord does
[50:32] things, isn't it?
[50:34] When we were yet dead in sins and
[50:37] trespasses,
[50:39] that's when he came and made himself
[50:41] known to us.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Not when we were perfect saints sitting
[50:45] in the church, saved and sanctified and
[50:48] filled with the Holy Ghost. It's no
[50:51] different. But I love the way that the
[50:52] Bible is written because it it starts
[50:54] the covenant back when he was the old
[50:57] man. In verse seven of Genesis chapter
[51:01] 17, God speaking here. He says, "And I
[51:04] will establish my covenant between me
[51:08] and thee, and thy seed after thee in
[51:12] their generations,
[51:14] for an everlasting covenant,
[51:17] to be a god unto thee, and to thy seed
[51:21] after thee. And I will give unto thee,
[51:24] and to thy seed after thee, the land
[51:28] wherein thou art a stranger,
[51:31] all the land of Canaan, for an
[51:34] everlasting possession,
[51:36] and I will be their God.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[51:42] Father, Lord Jesus, just the way that we
[51:45] read this scripture here, Father, we
[51:47] invite you to be our God. Lord, we just
[51:51] invite you to come by our way and
[51:53] Father, open this this word to us. Lord,
[51:56] we know that the only way we're ever
[51:58] going to be able to understand this word
[52:00] is by revelation from you. And we know
[52:02] that no school of theology could ever
[52:05] teach that revelation. And we know
[52:07] that's what you told your disciple.
[52:08] Father, we just ask that you would break
[52:11] this open to us fresh once again. That
[52:13] you would minister to our souls. that
[52:15] when we leave here today, we would say
[52:17] truly that you spoke to us as you walked
[52:20] with us along the way.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; We just love you and we thank you. We
[52:23] ask all these things in Jesus Christ's
[52:25] name we pray. Amen.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be
[52:29] seated.
[52:32] We just like to welcome all of our
[52:33] visitors. I probably will miss someone
[52:37] but the ables's
[52:39] my
[52:42] brother John Perazark. God bless you
[52:45] and your family.
[52:48] Certainly wonderful to have the
[52:52] uh hoofers here with us. Sister Pamela,
[52:55] God bless you. Did you bring your
[52:58] husband today? He's working. Yeah,
[53:01] certainly wonderful to see everyone. uh
[53:04] brother Marco,
[53:06] the Carpan family, and we have the
[53:08] Hinkles with us, some special guests.
[53:11] And uh for those people that might
[53:14] recall, we had prayer once upon a time
[53:16] for my cousin Troy Hinkle. And uh here
[53:21] he is.
[53:23] Certainly wonderful to see what the Lord
[53:25] can do.
[53:29] You know, brother brother Marco has been
[53:32] a a strong witness in Fort McMurray and
[53:35] and the area up there. And it's just
[53:37] incredible to see how the Lord does
[53:39] things. But when he first mentioned that
[53:42] he was witnessing to these people, I was
[53:44] just fellowshipping over at Brother
[53:45] Mvin's house and I heard this name
[53:47] Hinkle and I said, "Man, I haven't heard
[53:51] that name for years." And I don't know
[53:53] if that's the same person or not even.
[53:56] And uh so we began talking and and uh
[53:59] through the process of time come to find
[54:01] out that back and forth yes indeed it's
[54:04] uh he's from my my home in Claris home
[54:07] Alberta and uh we went on vacation
[54:10] together. I'll never forget it. Car
[54:12] broke down and we had an extended stay
[54:14] down in uh down in the Crestston area.
[54:17] Just a wonderful wonderful time. But
[54:19] we're certainly thankful to have you
[54:20] here with us and I trust you feel right
[54:22] at home today. I'll stop talking about
[54:24] you because I don't want you to make you
[54:25] any more uncomfortable. we can get into
[54:28] the word today and uh certainly thankful
[54:31] for this word and the thought about the
[54:33] covenant and you know we have been
[54:35] taking the the discussion about the
[54:37] covenant that God gave to Abram and uh
[54:41] we know that he gave him this covenant
[54:42] in a few different places and told him
[54:45] that if he would just follow him that he
[54:48] would grant him a possession that there
[54:50] would be an inheritance and it would be
[54:52] an everlasting covenant. And we know
[54:54] that that covenant that was mentioned
[54:56] here in Genesis 17 so many thousands of
[55:01] years ago is still in force today.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; That very same covenant is still in
[55:07] force today. We know it's an everlasting
[55:10] covenant. So it's not in force forever
[55:13] because it's not eternal. There's only
[55:15] one thing that's eternal and that is
[55:17] God's own life, Zoey, God's life. But
[55:21] this is an everlasting covenant that as
[55:23] long as there is time, there is a
[55:25] covenant.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; And I think it's so beautiful when we
[55:28] talk about how we we did in the past and
[55:30] maybe we'll get into it a little bit and
[55:32] and how God refers to how strong this
[55:35] covenant is. I believe in Jeremiah.
[55:38] We'll get into that just a little bit
[55:39] further. But you know, we're talking
[55:41] about this word covenant in uh in the
[55:43] concordance in in it's the Hebrew 1285.
[55:47] It's bareth and it's from 1262 in the
[55:51] sense of cutting a compact
[55:55] because made by passing between pieces
[55:58] of flesh confederacy covenant league.
[56:02] This is the definition of this word from
[56:04] the Hebrew uh lexicon. And I just think
[56:08] it's it's wonderful to look at this
[56:10] because we know that there is a time
[56:12] further back in Genesis when God was
[56:15] making himself known to Abraham. He told
[56:18] him that if he would just simply follow
[56:20] him that he would actually make him a
[56:23] leader of a great nation. And he gave
[56:27] him the description of it of how they
[56:29] would be able to take over the land. And
[56:31] I'm not going to go back over it like we
[56:33] did so many times in the past here
[56:35] recently for time sake. I'm just going
[56:37] to try and press forward a little bit.
[56:39] But speaking about this covenant,
[56:41] Abraham fell into a dark sleep, a deep
[56:45] sleep. And he said, you know, he he he
[56:47] beheld a a smoking furnace and a and a
[56:50] really dark place and a a frightful
[56:53] scene. And we know that brother Brandham
[56:55] said that was actually a description of
[56:56] death, how humans have to die. This
[56:59] flesh has to perish. And I just going to
[57:02] put this in here today. I think it's so
[57:04] important for us to remember that this
[57:05] flesh still has to perish. This flesh
[57:08] will never ever inherit in corruption.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; This flesh will never ever see God and
[57:16] live
[57:17] &gt;&gt; ever.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; So, we might as well stop trying to act
[57:21] like this flesh should be perfect
[57:23] because it never will be perfect.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; The only thing that's perfect is God's
[57:27] word. And that word we have got to hide
[57:30] in our heart that we might not sin
[57:32] against him. That's the word of God.
[57:35] It's the only thing that will change us
[57:37] into a new body is his word.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; That's it. But I so appreciate how we
[57:45] can look at it and and think, you know,
[57:46] someday maybe if I keep in going to
[57:48] church and I keep reading my Bible and I
[57:51] keep praying that one day I'll become
[57:53] like an angel. I'll become an angel. You
[57:55] know what? We'll never be an angel.
[57:57] Sometimes you hear about people when
[57:58] they pass away that they they're now an
[58:01] angel, an angelic being. They are never
[58:03] going to be an angelic being. They are a
[58:05] human being. They were created in the
[58:08] image of God. Angels were not created in
[58:11] the image of God. But brothers and
[58:13] sisters, why not stop trying to be an
[58:16] angel here on this side of eternity and
[58:19] just live in the image of God?
[58:24] Maybe it's just for the kids here today,
[58:27] but maybe there's some big kids in our
[58:29] midst, is there?
[58:30] &gt;&gt; I know I am. The first time I heard
[58:32] that, I thought, man, that's a that's
[58:34] amazing. Why would I want to try and act
[58:35] like an angel because I'm not one?
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Why would we want to act like another
[58:40] creature than what we are? Let's just be
[58:43] humans in the image of God and recognize
[58:46] what redemption is. When we truly
[58:47] recognize the revelation of redemption,
[58:50] brothers and sisters, my I think there's
[58:52] a series right there, the revelation of
[58:54] redemption. All heaven's going to be
[58:56] quiet to hear our song special.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Right? Isn't that the word of God?
[59:00] &gt;&gt; So, we might as well get busy practicing
[59:02] right here, right now.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Who cares what's going on in the world?
[59:06] Who cares who is sitting beside us, in
[59:08] front of us, or behind us? We're only
[59:11] here for one purpose, aren't we?
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; That's to worship the King of Kings.
[59:17] And remember,
[59:19] &gt;&gt; we're kings and priests according to the
[59:20] word of God.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful to think that he's
[59:23] the king of these kings
[59:26] &gt;&gt; and the Lord of Lords? My goodness. You
[59:29] know, I just want to welcome our friends
[59:31] also up in Tunnel Mountain this morning.
[59:33] God bless you and each one who is tuning
[59:36] in. Oh my. You know, we uh we picked up
[59:39] this this thought from Jeremiah chapter
[59:42] 31 the last couple of services. And just
[59:45] for time sake, I'm going to quickly go
[59:46] over it here. Jeremiah 31:33,
[59:51] God speaking through his prophet. But
[59:53] this this shall be the covenant that I
[59:57] will make with the house of Israel.
[1:00:00] After those days, sayaeth the Lord, I
[1:00:02] will put my law in their inward parts,
[1:00:04] and write it in their hearts, and will
[1:00:06] be their God, and they shall be my
[1:00:09] people. and they shall teach no more
[1:00:11] every man his neighbor and every man his
[1:00:14] brother, saying, "Know the Lord."
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; There's coming a time where we aren't
[1:00:19] going to do the same either. We're not
[1:00:21] going to go up into heaven and have
[1:00:22] prayer meetings.
[1:00:24] We're not going to go up into heaven and
[1:00:26] be preaching to the lost because we're
[1:00:29] all going to be saved.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; It's going to be different. We're going
[1:00:33] to be in glory. But it's interesting if
[1:00:35] you look at what's going on in the world
[1:00:37] today, you can see the spirit of God
[1:00:40] lifting off of the gentile church and
[1:00:42] moving back to Israel. Why is it that
[1:00:45] the whole world now is rallying to cry
[1:00:48] out against the Jews?
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because there is an
[1:00:52] anointing that's coming on the Jews,
[1:00:55] brothers and sisters. It's this message
[1:00:58] of Jesus Christ. Verse 34 says, "And
[1:01:01] they shall teach no more, every man his
[1:01:02] neighbor, and every man his brother,
[1:01:04] saying, Know the Lord, for they shall
[1:01:06] know me, from the least of them unto the
[1:01:09] greatest of them, saith the Lord, for I
[1:01:13] will forgive their iniquity, and I will
[1:01:15] remember their sin no more." Now, now,
[1:01:18] let's not take this and put this off to
[1:01:20] them quite yet, because the spirit of
[1:01:21] the Lord hasn't completely lifted off of
[1:01:24] the Gentile church yet. And how do we
[1:01:26] know that? Because the rapture hasn't
[1:01:27] taken place. Once that happens, then
[1:01:30] look out.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; But we're not there yet. Praise the
[1:01:34] Lord. He's still calling. It's a
[1:01:36] wonderful thing to know that. But we we
[1:01:39] really kind of tried to drill down on
[1:01:40] this last time, and I think it's so
[1:01:42] important, and I just want to set the
[1:01:44] background, maybe lay a little bit of
[1:01:46] foundation here. He says that I will
[1:01:48] forgive their iniquity and will remember
[1:01:51] their sin no more. Remember that every
[1:01:54] single verse has a a compound meaning
[1:01:57] and revelation. And we know that we
[1:02:00] should see ourselves from Genesis to
[1:02:02] Revelation. We know the prophet says
[1:02:04] that we should see Jesus Christ from
[1:02:05] Genesis to Revelation. Absolutely. But
[1:02:08] guess what? I believe it goes even a
[1:02:10] little bit further. We've got to be able
[1:02:12] to see ourselves in this scripture,
[1:02:14] brothers and sisters.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; It's not just going to be for the Jews.
[1:02:19] It's going to be for the Gentiles as
[1:02:20] well. Hebrews chapter 8:10. For this is
[1:02:23] the covenant that I will make with the
[1:02:25] house of Israel. After those days,
[1:02:27] sayaeth the Lord, I will put my laws
[1:02:29] into their mind. Write them in their
[1:02:32] hearts, and I will be to them a God, and
[1:02:35] they shall be to me a people.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that?
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; What a tremendous blessing that is.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 10 11. And every priest standeth
[1:02:48] daily ministering and offering
[1:02:52] oftentimes the same sacrifices which can
[1:02:55] never take away sins. God bless you
[1:02:58] brother. Safe travels.
[1:03:02] Every priest standeth daily ministering
[1:03:04] and offering oftent times the same
[1:03:07] sacrifices which can never take away
[1:03:11] sins. Remember, the Jews are still
[1:03:13] living under this exact same covenant
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; under the the blood of bulls and goats.
[1:03:20] And why is that? Not because something
[1:03:22] changed. It's because they chose to stay
[1:03:24] there. They decided to accept the law
[1:03:28] instead of grace. And why is that? That
[1:03:30] was so that we could be saved.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Boy, I heard it recently this week. I I
[1:03:35] was shocked about it. Some
[1:03:36] denominational Christians were throwing
[1:03:38] off on the Jews because of what they did
[1:03:41] to Christ. They've got a an attitude
[1:03:43] problem about what the Jewish people did
[1:03:45] to Christ. Don't they know the word says
[1:03:47] they were blinded for our sake?
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; But what it is, somebody has taught them
[1:03:54] that they're wrong. Somebody taught them
[1:03:56] that they were bad. Somebody taught them
[1:03:58] they were erroneous. And sure enough,
[1:04:01] maybe the the most religious people, we
[1:04:03] know brother Bradom preached that
[1:04:05] message and he says it very clearly
[1:04:07] there the most religious place they the
[1:04:10] most religious people crucified the
[1:04:14] greatest one. Those people they did it
[1:04:17] sure enough but we know that they were
[1:04:18] influenced by spirits and the reason
[1:04:20] they did it was so that we could
[1:04:22] actually have this grace.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Outside of them doing that we would
[1:04:26] never have this grace. How could anybody
[1:04:28] ever throw off on the Jewish race?
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; We got a prophet in our day that says
[1:04:34] they're our brothers
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; and our sisters.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And you know, just like we're elected,
[1:04:39] they are also elected.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; They are also elected.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; They're not the bride. Don't get me
[1:04:46] wrong. I'm not saying that. But uh I
[1:04:49] just think, you know, this is where they
[1:04:51] live in Hebrews 10:11. And every priest
[1:04:53] standeth daily ministering and offering
[1:04:55] oftentimes the same sacrifices which can
[1:04:58] never take away sins. It'll never change
[1:05:00] their desire. And you know brothers and
[1:05:02] sisters it's progressed so far now the
[1:05:05] building of the third temple. They
[1:05:06] actually have the red heer genetically
[1:05:09] sound in Israel and they're planning to
[1:05:12] offer one as a sacrifice according to
[1:05:14] the Levitical priesthood. It's coming up
[1:05:17] real soon.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; But it's not going to take away their
[1:05:20] desire.
[1:05:22] Amen.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Verse 12 says, "But this man, wow, one
[1:05:26] man, this man after he had offered one
[1:05:30] sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on
[1:05:34] the right hand of God."
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; And we know that is resting. And not
[1:05:38] just resting, but resting in power in
[1:05:40] his position from henceforth expecting
[1:05:43] till his enemies be made his foottool.
[1:05:45] It doesn't matter how long it takes
[1:05:47] because the triumph has already
[1:05:49] happened. The victory is already won. He
[1:05:52] already descended down into hell,
[1:05:54] knocked on that door and said, "Open up.
[1:05:58] I'm the one." He preached to those
[1:06:00] people who were lost and said, "You know
[1:06:03] what? That one that Noah was preaching
[1:06:05] about, that one that Jeremiah was
[1:06:08] preaching about, that one that Adam
[1:06:10] spoke of, that one that all of the
[1:06:13] prophets and sages spoke about, I am
[1:06:16] him."
[1:06:19] and Satan, you have to hand over those
[1:06:21] keys of death and hell.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; That victory was won. So he went and sat
[1:06:26] down in his position. He took his
[1:06:28] position. For by one offering he hath
[1:06:32] what? Perfected forever them that are
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; sanctified.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; My
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; So we're going to get into that in a
[1:06:45] little bit, but we'll just carry on
[1:06:46] here. Verse 15 says, "Whereof the Holy
[1:06:48] Ghost also is a witness to us, for after
[1:06:54] that he had said before, this is the
[1:06:58] covenant that I will make with them
[1:07:00] after those days." I just love how the
[1:07:03] word of God ties this together. As much
[1:07:05] as brother Barry wants to try and tie
[1:07:06] this covenant together with the Holy
[1:07:08] Ghost, this is the word of God.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Wherefore the Holy Ghost also is a
[1:07:12] witness to us. Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; He's preaching to the Hebrews, but we
[1:07:17] know this is to the Gentiles also.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; This is the covenant that I will make
[1:07:21] with them after those days, sayeth the
[1:07:23] Lord. What does he say? He says exactly
[1:07:25] what was said. He goes back to the
[1:07:26] prophet Jeremiah. And that's exactly
[1:07:29] what brother Brham did. He went right
[1:07:31] back to this as well. I will put my laws
[1:07:34] into their hearts and in their minds
[1:07:37] will I write them,
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; and their sins and iniquities will I
[1:07:41] remember no more.
[1:07:43] Isn't it beautiful to think, brothers
[1:07:44] and sisters, that is our covenant right
[1:07:46] there.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; That's our covenant right there. That he
[1:07:50] will put his laws into our hearts and
[1:07:52] into their minds. Will I write them?
[1:07:54] That's why legalism is a waste of time.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Some people might say, "Brother Barry,
[1:08:00] how could you ever say that?" You know
[1:08:01] what? He said he'll write his laws in
[1:08:03] our hearts and in our minds. So why do
[1:08:06] we need to be taught? You have to dress
[1:08:08] like this. You have to act like this.
[1:08:10] You have to do the other. How about we
[1:08:12] just get the Holy Ghost and him, the
[1:08:14] spirit of truth, when he comes, he will
[1:08:17] lead us and guide us into all truth.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; How about enough of of the measuring
[1:08:23] stick? Brother Brandham says enough away
[1:08:25] with the plum line of works. Let's get
[1:08:28] into grace. That grace is him writing
[1:08:31] those in our hearts, writing his laws in
[1:08:34] our hearts and and bringing it to our
[1:08:36] mind. When we do something wrong,
[1:08:38] something is going to come from our
[1:08:39] heart to our mind back up and say, "I
[1:08:41] didn't like that. You need to go make
[1:08:43] that right."
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; We talked about it last time. And I'll
[1:08:48] tr I I I can only tell you the truth. I
[1:08:51] I don't I don't feel led to go that way
[1:08:53] today, but last time we talked about
[1:08:55] unforgiveness
[1:08:57] and and and that idea of resentment that
[1:08:59] we can hold on to things and just carry
[1:09:01] things around from people that have
[1:09:03] stepped on our toes and hurt us and it's
[1:09:05] okay. and and and it just hurts so much.
[1:09:07] And you know, Brother Barry, as you're
[1:09:09] preaching, here we go. I guess maybe you
[1:09:11] don't know how much it hurt. How hurt I
[1:09:13] am. You don't know what I went through.
[1:09:14] I don't. But he does.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; And by the way, do you know what he went
[1:09:18] through?
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; We want to talk about hurt.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; The whole world against you.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Everybody turning on you. All of your
[1:09:28] disciples, the followers just completely
[1:09:31] turning their backs on you.
[1:09:34] And one one thing will happen in our
[1:09:36] life and we'll say, "My, I'm hurt. I've
[1:09:38] got the right. I I'm entitled to carry
[1:09:41] around this hurt or this anger or this
[1:09:43] this this sadness or what whatever it
[1:09:46] is."
[1:09:48] I just think it's amazing though. This
[1:09:51] scripture here says that I will put my
[1:09:52] laws into their hearts and in their
[1:09:54] minds will I write them. And when he
[1:09:56] does that, you know, brothers and
[1:09:57] sisters, we don't have to teach people
[1:09:59] that your skirt is too short, that your
[1:10:01] skirt is too tight, that that your top
[1:10:04] is too tight, that that you shouldn't
[1:10:06] look at this, that brother, you
[1:10:08] shouldn't act like that, you you
[1:10:10] shouldn't go to that other place. Why,
[1:10:11] brothers, would you want to try and talk
[1:10:13] gangster? Brothers, why would you want
[1:10:16] to go and watch this? Why would you want
[1:10:18] to do that? Why do we have to teach
[1:10:19] everyone that? Of course, we have to
[1:10:21] teach certain things in our lives, but
[1:10:24] there comes a point in time of
[1:10:25] accountability where we have to become
[1:10:27] mature sons and daughters. And when we
[1:10:29] are mature sons and daughters, then his
[1:10:31] laws are written in our hearts.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; He will show us that he doesn't like
[1:10:37] things. And you know what? We'll change
[1:10:38] our ways because he speaks to us and we
[1:10:41] answer. And you know, that is the truest
[1:10:43] part of the covenant, brothers and
[1:10:44] sisters. It's one thing to have someone
[1:10:46] tell you over and over, over and over,
[1:10:48] over and over, you got to do this, you
[1:10:50] got to do that, you got right to be
[1:10:52] continually taught. It's one thing to
[1:10:54] have that, but it's another thing
[1:10:56] altogether. This is where it gets shaky
[1:10:58] ground, where people get uneasy because,
[1:11:00] you know, we've got to go to the place
[1:11:02] where we know what the minister is
[1:11:04] preaching and we can say amen to it
[1:11:06] because we've had a real experience
[1:11:08] ourselves. And it's not just a
[1:11:09] 40year-old experience that happened 40
[1:11:12] years ago somewhere. It happens every
[1:11:14] single day. He speaks to me and I
[1:11:16] respond. I speak to him and he speaks
[1:11:19] back. There's actually a relationship.
[1:11:21] And when he says, "I don't want you to
[1:11:23] do that." You don't do it.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; But many times we do in our flesh.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Many times we do. But what happens when
[1:11:33] that happens? Is he surprised?
[1:11:36] We talked about this in the past.
[1:11:38] Sometimes we surprise ourselves. You
[1:11:40] ever surprise yourself?
[1:11:42] Maybe not. But I know I've surprised
[1:11:44] myself. I've come to the place where I
[1:11:45] can't even look at myself in the mirror.
[1:11:47] I think, who are you? Why would you do
[1:11:50] that?
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; But I never surprised him. Not for a
[1:11:54] second.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; He knew that I would be that way. He
[1:11:57] knew that that's exactly the way his
[1:11:58] flesh would be. He knew that's how I
[1:11:59] would be created and all the environment
[1:12:01] around me would shape me and mold me and
[1:12:04] cause me to become this creature.
[1:12:08] But we got to become a new creature.
[1:12:11] We've got to be born again.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; We cannot remain the same person and
[1:12:15] say, you know, I know that it's okay. I
[1:12:18] I don't have to have an experience. I
[1:12:19] don't have to shout. I don't have to
[1:12:21] sing. I don't have to clap. Why would we
[1:12:23] not want to shout and sing and clap when
[1:12:25] we know what he's done for us?
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Especially when we read verse 17 here of
[1:12:31] of this this scripture that we're
[1:12:33] reading in Hebrews chapter 10.
[1:12:37] He says, "And their sins and iniquities
[1:12:40] will I remember no more."
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; That's why I say, brothers and sisters,
[1:12:46] how dare we ever hold on to anything
[1:12:48] against anyone when he won't hold it
[1:12:50] against us?
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; And remember, that's why he told
[1:12:56] his disciples, the way that you judge
[1:12:58] people, caution, that's the way that
[1:13:01] you're going to be judged.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; I just think it's so beautiful. And and
[1:13:05] you know I I'll I'll tell you as we
[1:13:07] preach those people who do minister, you
[1:13:09] know what I'm talking about. Sometimes
[1:13:10] we preach to ourselves and I'll say this
[1:13:13] is one of them. I want to say this
[1:13:14] today, brothers and sisters. I want to
[1:13:16] look at my brothers and sisters and not
[1:13:18] remember their iniquities,
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; not remember their sins, not remember
[1:13:22] how maybe they said something behind my
[1:13:25] back and thought that the pastor never
[1:13:26] heard it. But guess what? He hears it.
[1:13:30] But I don't want to remember it because
[1:13:32] I want to say exactly what brother
[1:13:33] Brandham said. You know, I don't think
[1:13:35] they meant it. I just don't.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. James talks
[1:13:41] about it. You know, how you can have the
[1:13:43] the big huge ships and they have just a
[1:13:45] little tiny rudder and that'll move the
[1:13:47] ship around. Oh my, how great a fire
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; can one of these little tongues kindle.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; It's not what goes into the human being.
[1:13:55] We, you know, Jesus said that, right?
[1:13:57] That what we eat doesn't defile us. It's
[1:13:59] what comes out of us that does. Yes,
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; I just feel so so impressed about it. I
[1:14:06] can never get away from it. You know,
[1:14:07] parents, it wasn't actually the
[1:14:10] preaching of the word. It wasn't a
[1:14:12] minister that caused those 42 kids to
[1:14:16] get killed by the she bears. Was it?
[1:14:18] Brother Bradom said it was those
[1:14:19] dinnertime conversations that the
[1:14:22] parents were having amongst themselves
[1:14:24] and their children were listening. And
[1:14:26] that's why they went out and started to
[1:14:28] mock God's prophet, the man for the day.
[1:14:31] And what happened? The children died.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; But you know, today we don't have to
[1:14:38] worry about death naturally
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; because we'll live. We'll thrive.
[1:14:42] Everything is good. We're living in the
[1:14:43] Leodysian church age for some people.
[1:14:46] Other people are living in the bride
[1:14:47] age. But there's always a blet of the
[1:14:49] ages and it becomes a revelation to us.
[1:14:52] But you know, we don't have to worry
[1:14:54] about our children actually being
[1:14:56] consumed by she bears. Maybe unless they
[1:14:58] go out and hang out in Tunnel Mountain
[1:15:00] without bear spray for long. But you
[1:15:02] know what we can do is worry about
[1:15:04] another thing. And that is that that
[1:15:06] devil that's going about as a roaring
[1:15:09] lion
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; seeking whom he may devour. And who's he
[1:15:13] going to devour? He's going for the
[1:15:14] elderly and the young. He's going to go
[1:15:17] for the sick and the afflicted. He's
[1:15:18] going to go for all of the what we would
[1:15:20] call the lowhanging fruit.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; He's going to take the easy way because
[1:15:25] he's a coward.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; He knows he can't get through the strong
[1:15:29] ones. He knows he can't get through
[1:15:31] those who recognize that they're
[1:15:33] sanctified, that they're already
[1:15:35] justified, that they're already seated
[1:15:37] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. So
[1:15:39] what does he do? He goes for the weaker
[1:15:40] ones.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; That's why, you know, he doesn't change
[1:15:44] his tactics.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; That's what he did. the very first
[1:15:47] thing, his very first order of business
[1:15:49] in the garden of Eden. After we talked
[1:15:51] about the iniquity after iniquity was
[1:15:54] found in his heart and he was cast down,
[1:15:56] he found himself in the garden of God.
[1:15:58] We know it was Satan, the devil. That's
[1:16:01] where he found himself. And what
[1:16:02] happened when he was there? He tried to
[1:16:04] hand that iniquity off to Eve. And what
[1:16:07] did he do? He succeeded. The only reason
[1:16:10] he succeeded is because she was not
[1:16:12] behind her husband.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. if she would have got behind her
[1:16:15] husband in her position and said, "I
[1:16:18] think that we should go back to my
[1:16:19] husband and have a conversation about
[1:16:21] what your proposal is here. Let's see
[1:16:23] what he has to say about things." But
[1:16:26] she took things into her own hands and
[1:16:28] tried to manage. And guess what? She was
[1:16:30] deceived.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; And it's beautiful because it's a type
[1:16:33] of Christ in his church. We know it had
[1:16:35] to happen. The fall had to happen so he
[1:16:37] could express his attributes to us and
[1:16:39] through us.
[1:16:41] A true husband isn't just going to let
[1:16:43] his wife fall, let her go. No way. Adam
[1:16:46] wasn't in the transgression. That's what
[1:16:47] the word of God says. Adam knew she was
[1:16:50] a part of him. And he was not about to
[1:16:52] let her go. Not for a second.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; But I think this scripture is so
[1:16:56] beautiful here.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Their sins and iniquities will I
[1:17:00] remember no more. I I say, Lord, help me
[1:17:03] live my life where I look at my brothers
[1:17:05] and my sisters through those eyes. Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Let those eyes be the ones that look out
[1:17:11] and around in this world. I I believe we
[1:17:14] would have a different world if we could
[1:17:16] do that ourselves. Recognize that he's
[1:17:19] not recognizing our sins and iniquities.
[1:17:22] So, how could we recognize theirs?
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; We know that Jesus disciples asked him,
[1:17:28] you know, how many times should I
[1:17:30] forgive my brother who just continually
[1:17:32] steps on my toe, continually sins
[1:17:35] against me? What did Jesus say? 70
[1:17:38] times. Seven times.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Not just seven times. According to the
[1:17:42] Old Testament law. No, no. According to
[1:17:45] the magnified law that I bring in my
[1:17:48] flesh, 70* 7. Because the way that you
[1:17:52] judge is how you're going to be judged.
[1:17:55] We need to make sure that we're looking
[1:17:56] through these eyes.
[1:17:59] We know probably preaching to the choir
[1:18:02] here, but true prophets, they only say
[1:18:04] what has been said. They don't bring a
[1:18:07] new message. They only point back to the
[1:18:10] original message. And on Wednesday, we
[1:18:12] had such a tremendous service. If
[1:18:13] anybody is interested, I highly
[1:18:15] recommend streaming it. Listen to it.
[1:18:16] It's on YouTube. I'm not trying to
[1:18:18] promote YouTube. And us, it's Brother
[1:18:20] Timothy Ashang from Ghana. He's a
[1:18:22] general in this word. He's been
[1:18:24] preaching this gospel for 40 years. And
[1:18:26] he just simply said, "Listen, shake
[1:18:28] yourself. Check up your experience and
[1:18:31] make sure that it still fits the
[1:18:33] original pattern. And if it doesn't, why
[1:18:36] doesn't it?
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. I want to
[1:18:40] shake myself. The way that he preached
[1:18:42] that was so glorious. Let me shake
[1:18:44] myself and check myself." This isn't a
[1:18:47] time to be playing church and thinking
[1:18:49] that everything is okay. We can just
[1:18:51] make excuses and do what we want. This
[1:18:53] is no time for playing. One of these
[1:18:56] days there's going to be two witnesses
[1:18:58] in Israel.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And when those witnesses are in Israel,
[1:19:01] the bride's already gone. So if we
[1:19:03] witness those Israel witnesses, it's too
[1:19:06] late.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; The only way that we're going to make it
[1:19:09] is to give our lives.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; But we don't have to do that. I think
[1:19:15] it's so amazing how we're here today and
[1:19:18] he's not remembering our sins and
[1:19:20] iniquities
[1:19:22] no more. They're in the sea of his
[1:19:24] forgetfulness. And this is what we
[1:19:25] really talked about last time. When we
[1:19:26] have something in our heart, we got
[1:19:27] something that just we can't get rid of.
[1:19:30] Let's just take it and give it to God so
[1:19:31] that he can put it in the sea of his
[1:19:33] forgetfulness. We'll never be able to
[1:19:35] forget, but we can actually choose to
[1:19:37] dig up those memories. And we can choose
[1:19:40] to entertain them. And we can choose to
[1:19:42] open up the volumes and go through line
[1:19:44] by line. They said this, they did this,
[1:19:46] they went there, did that. Blah blah
[1:19:48] blah blah. Or we can close the book and
[1:19:51] throw it into the sea of God's
[1:19:52] forgetfulness and say, "Nope, that's my
[1:19:54] brother or my sister, and I don't
[1:19:55] remember their sin or their iniquity
[1:19:57] anymore, just like he doesn't remember
[1:19:58] my sin or my iniquity anymore." We have
[1:20:01] a choice. We can choose, brothers and
[1:20:03] sisters.
[1:20:05] True prophets only say what's been said.
[1:20:08] Paul preached what Jeremiah preached and
[1:20:10] brother Brham, he preached what Paul
[1:20:12] preached. So setting that as a
[1:20:15] background, I just would like to move
[1:20:17] forward out of Hebrews 10. I'd like to
[1:20:21] just go a little bit further if we can.
[1:20:24] Let's jump down to verse 18 in Hebrews
[1:20:27] chapter 10.
[1:20:30] We know that they lived under the old
[1:20:33] old law. The Jews lived under the Old
[1:20:36] Testament covenant where there was there
[1:20:39] was sacrifices that were made
[1:20:41] continually every year and they can do
[1:20:44] everything exactly right according to
[1:20:46] the law and and when they did it was it
[1:20:50] was accepted. Their sacrifice was
[1:20:52] accepted but it didn't change their
[1:20:53] behavior. It didn't change their desire.
[1:20:56] They still desired to sin.
[1:21:00] But in Hebrews 10 verse 18 and we know
[1:21:04] that this is the transition. This is the
[1:21:06] changing of the dispensation going from
[1:21:08] the Jews to the Gentiles. Verse 18 says,
[1:21:12] "Now where remission of these is, there
[1:21:15] is no more offering of sin. This is what
[1:21:19] happened at Calvary, the cross between
[1:21:21] the Jews and the Gentiles." Verse 19
[1:21:25] says, "Having therefore, brethren,
[1:21:28] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[1:21:31] the blood of Jesus." This is such a
[1:21:34] foreign word to those people who were on
[1:21:36] the ground in the day. Remember, they
[1:21:39] had the Levitical priesthood, the Old
[1:21:42] Testament law, they had the temple. A
[1:21:45] and can you imagine what happened? Many
[1:21:47] times I think we we we preach about how
[1:21:50] when Jesus his very first order of
[1:21:52] business God in flesh when his flesh was
[1:21:54] torn when he bowed his head and said
[1:21:57] it's finished and we know the word says
[1:21:59] that he gave up the ghost when that
[1:22:01] ghost would was given up what did it do
[1:22:04] it didn't shoot up into heaven it shot
[1:22:05] into the temple and it tore that veil
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; from the top to the bottom
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; to make an example that there's no more
[1:22:13] veil between God and man
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; there's No more cherubams guarding that
[1:22:19] tree of life.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; I think it's amazing that that was his
[1:22:30] first order of business. I've preached
[1:22:31] that many times. But I just can't help
[1:22:33] but think, you know, the the religiosity
[1:22:37] of man, what would they have done in
[1:22:39] that day? You can only imagine because
[1:22:41] they didn't believe Jesus at all.
[1:22:44] So much so they actually said to the
[1:22:47] disciples, you better to the guards, I
[1:22:50] mean, you better shut your mouths about
[1:22:52] him actually coming out of the grave and
[1:22:54] we're going to pay you large is what the
[1:22:56] word says that you will shut your mouth
[1:22:58] and if you do say anything to anyone,
[1:23:00] we're going to actually hold you
[1:23:02] accountable for letting him escape.
[1:23:05] They didn't want to accept Jesus at all
[1:23:07] in any way.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; So what did they do? You can only
[1:23:10] imagine. They got everyone together and
[1:23:13] they got out the needles and the thread
[1:23:15] and they mended that curtain, that veil,
[1:23:17] put it right back to its religious
[1:23:19] beauty.
[1:23:21] And let's not do that today, brothers
[1:23:22] and sisters.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; I think it can be so easy to to want to
[1:23:27] actually stitch that veil up and and
[1:23:29] create a holy place that maybe only a
[1:23:32] few people can get through. Maybe a a a
[1:23:34] great ministry or or maybe an evangelist
[1:23:36] or or maybe just the parents or or maybe
[1:23:39] just a husband or maybe just a wife. No,
[1:23:42] no, that veil was torn. The word of God
[1:23:44] says that was the first thing that he
[1:23:46] did. Let's keep it torn. Let's recognize
[1:23:48] that now it is actually death to stay
[1:23:51] outside of that holy place.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; But talking about this verse here in in
[1:23:57] Hebrews 19 here now, uh I believe this
[1:24:00] is Hebrews 10:1 19. Having therefore,
[1:24:02] brethren, boldness, enter in to the
[1:24:05] holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new
[1:24:09] and living way. Back in that day, this
[1:24:12] was completely foreign to them. They
[1:24:15] were used to the religiosity, the the
[1:24:17] most religious people, the the the
[1:24:20] animal sacrifice, the blood of bulls and
[1:24:23] goats, the old covenant. They were used
[1:24:25] to that. And they even called themselves
[1:24:28] the seed of Abraham, didn't they? They
[1:24:30] said, "We have Abraham as our father,
[1:24:33] and and you say that in three days
[1:24:35] you're going to raise this temple back
[1:24:38] up."
[1:24:39] not recognizing who he truly was. And he
[1:24:42] wasn't talking about the stones. He was
[1:24:44] talking about this temple
[1:24:46] in three days. Indeed, he will raise it
[1:24:49] back up again. But because of that, now
[1:24:52] he's saying, Paul is saying to the
[1:24:54] Hebrews, he's saying to the Gentiles,
[1:24:56] he's saying to everyone, having,
[1:24:57] brethren, boldness, enter into the
[1:25:00] holiest by the blood of Jesus. recognize
[1:25:03] now by the blood of this one sacrifice,
[1:25:05] we can go in to the holy place by a new
[1:25:09] and living way, not an old dead way. Not
[1:25:13] because an animal was killed and our
[1:25:16] desires haven't changed. When we accept
[1:25:18] this one sacrifice that was offered on
[1:25:21] our behalf, it changes our ways.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; It changes our desires.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; That's the difference between the old
[1:25:28] covenant and the new covenant.
[1:25:32] Having therefore, brethren, boldness,
[1:25:34] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[1:25:38] Jesus. What is the holiest that we can
[1:25:42] enter into, brothers and sisters? Some
[1:25:44] people might say, well, it's it's a
[1:25:46] church building. Maybe it's Calgary
[1:25:48] Living Word Assembly. And others here
[1:25:50] maybe from Saskatoon would say, "No, no,
[1:25:52] it's Saskatoon Tabernacle." And others
[1:25:54] here might say, "No, no, no. It's Ed end
[1:25:56] time message tabernacle." And and there
[1:25:58] could be all manner of different
[1:26:00] descriptions of what that holy place
[1:26:01] could be. But we know we had a prophet,
[1:26:04] a vindicated prophet, one that had a
[1:26:06] ministry that showed around the world
[1:26:08] seven times that God is with him. He
[1:26:12] said the only place that God has chosen
[1:26:14] to put his name is in Jesus Christ. The
[1:26:17] only place that God has chosen for us to
[1:26:20] worship is in Jesus Christ. How do we
[1:26:23] get into Jesus Christ today, brothers
[1:26:25] and sisters? It's by a new and living
[1:26:27] way and that is by getting the baptism
[1:26:29] of the Holy Ghost. He is the one that
[1:26:32] gives witness that we have actually
[1:26:34] entered into that place. Anything else
[1:26:37] is false. We know brother Bradom said it
[1:26:38] that all else is false.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Mark 16 in action. The Holy Ghost, the
[1:26:43] acts of the Holy Ghost working in and
[1:26:46] through the body is the only church that
[1:26:48] he calls his own in the day in which we
[1:26:50] live. All else is false. And we know
[1:26:53] there's a lot of false in this world in
[1:26:54] which we live in. My goodness. But you
[1:26:57] know, we have been given a boldness
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; because we understand this that there is
[1:27:03] a new covenant. Verse 20 says, "By a new
[1:27:06] and living way which he hath consecrated
[1:27:09] for us."
[1:27:11] This is where I think it's so beautiful
[1:27:12] when we talk to the legalists and we try
[1:27:15] to consecrate. We do want to consecrate,
[1:27:18] but we can only consecrate so far
[1:27:21] because he's done it all. The only thing
[1:27:23] we can do is surrender to his
[1:27:25] consecration
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; and say, "Be it unto me according to thy
[1:27:29] word, Lord." That's all. Come and and
[1:27:31] and fill me. Come by my way. Here's my
[1:27:34] cup, Lord. I lift it up.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Maybe I got the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:38] Ghost once upon a time, but I just need
[1:27:40] a little more oil today. That's why we
[1:27:42] come to church, brothers and sisters.
[1:27:44] Not just to hear some good preaching,
[1:27:46] not just to hear some good anointed
[1:27:48] preaching. Even though we do, I trust
[1:27:50] that we come to church so that we can
[1:27:52] top up our experience of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:54] in our life. We all need to have that
[1:27:57] oil. We know that the shout has already
[1:27:59] gone forward.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; The shout, the voice, the trumpet, the
[1:28:04] rapture being an experience. That shout
[1:28:06] has already taken place. And now there's
[1:28:09] a voice. Where's that voice? Some people
[1:28:10] would say in Jeffersonville, Indiana.
[1:28:12] Some people would say just in the
[1:28:13] vindicated prophets. Some people would
[1:28:14] say only in the ministry. I'll tell you
[1:28:17] the voice is inside the bride of Jesus
[1:28:19] Christ. The ones who have that new and
[1:28:22] living way inside of them. The true
[1:28:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost is that voice.
[1:28:27] And that voice is going to be just like
[1:28:29] Lazarus coming forth from the grave.
[1:28:32] There was one man that some people want
[1:28:34] to argue that he was man. And some
[1:28:36] people want to say that he is God. He
[1:28:37] was all God. an all man is what the
[1:28:39] prophet said in our day. And he was all
[1:28:41] man when he cried for his friend that
[1:28:43] died. But he was all God when he put his
[1:28:45] shoulders back and stood at that tomb
[1:28:47] and said, "Lazarus, come forth." It's
[1:28:49] going to be the same voice that was in
[1:28:51] that man that is in the bride of Jesus
[1:28:54] Christ that actually brings the trump of
[1:28:56] God. And it's not going to be a moment
[1:28:58] sooner or a moment later than what God
[1:29:00] has for ordained before the foundation
[1:29:02] of the world. It's just up to her to be
[1:29:05] in step with his word. We know the
[1:29:08] prophet of God gave that vision of the
[1:29:10] bride, right? The true bride, the church
[1:29:14] was given two previews. The first one,
[1:29:16] she was all over the place. And we know
[1:29:18] there was a bunch in the middle of
[1:29:20] impostors, impersonators, and it grossed
[1:29:23] the prophet out. He was so sad and sick
[1:29:25] to say that is this really what all of
[1:29:28] this preaching has come to, Lord? And he
[1:29:30] said, you know, there was one more
[1:29:31] vision and it was the bride
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; marching to onward Christian soldiers,
[1:29:37] right? But he said, even that preview,
[1:29:39] there was still a couple getting out of
[1:29:41] step. And what did he come out of that
[1:29:43] vision? Screaming, "Stay in line.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Check the pattern.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Shake yourself. Make sure that we fit
[1:29:51] the pattern."
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; We don't want to check and make sure the
[1:29:54] pattern fits us. And I think many times
[1:29:56] that's the problem in the Christian
[1:29:58] experience.
[1:30:00] we could just go church shopping. I
[1:30:02] could just find a church that'll just
[1:30:03] fit my pattern and and you know it'll be
[1:30:05] okay. Sure enough, they'll tell you
[1:30:07] it'll be just fine. But I think it's
[1:30:09] wonderful if you've heard that God sent
[1:30:10] a prophet. What did the prophet say? I
[1:30:14] think it's wow. It's so inspiring to
[1:30:16] think that we can change ourselves.
[1:30:18] Better yet, he can change us. He has to
[1:30:21] change us, brothers and sisters, to fit
[1:30:23] that pattern. We know we're hearing that
[1:30:25] on Wednesday night. I don't know if
[1:30:26] anybody else kind of went there in their
[1:30:28] own mind, but thinking about it, when we
[1:30:30] go and get on an airline, if you're
[1:30:31] going to carry on a bag, everybody here
[1:30:34] has flown, I'm sure you know that your
[1:30:36] bag has to fit that little rack. And if
[1:30:39] it doesn't fit that little rack, why
[1:30:41] would you try and carry it on? Even
[1:30:42] though there's still people that try and
[1:30:44] do it, and it causes delays and problems
[1:30:47] and upsets and so on and so forth, but
[1:30:49] they've got a pattern, don't they? It's
[1:30:52] got to fit that that rack. And if it
[1:30:55] doesn't fit, it doesn't fly.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; I just can't help but think the same
[1:30:59] thing for us, brothers and sisters. They
[1:31:01] don't take that rack and make it fit our
[1:31:03] bag. Even though sometimes we would like
[1:31:05] it if they could,
[1:31:08] but they never will.
[1:31:11] But we've been given the ability in the
[1:31:12] day in which we live to have boldness to
[1:31:14] enter into the holiest. Not by our
[1:31:17] blood, not by any other sacrifice, but
[1:31:21] by the blood of Jesus.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:24] That's how we get in there. It's by a
[1:31:26] new and living way which he hath
[1:31:28] consecrated for us. He did it, brothers
[1:31:30] and sisters, through the veil, that is
[1:31:32] to say, his flesh.
[1:31:35] Don't stumble at the veil. We know the
[1:31:37] word of God says to know no man after
[1:31:39] the flesh. Just just look at that man
[1:31:43] and say that's an attribute of God
[1:31:45] there.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful to think that brother
[1:31:48] Brandham said it that you don't see the
[1:31:50] real me? I I'm so glad that you don't
[1:31:53] see the real me.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to say I'm so glad
[1:31:56] that I don't see the real you because
[1:31:57] that could be taken wrong. But you know,
[1:31:59] brothers and sisters, we don't see each
[1:32:01] other.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; We don't see the true real us the way
[1:32:06] that he created us. But it's beautiful
[1:32:07] because that's the only way he sees us.
[1:32:10] He doesn't see us the way we see
[1:32:11] ourselves.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; And that's the trick the devil has.
[1:32:14] That's the trick that he does. He tries
[1:32:16] to say that he sees you. Brother Bradam
[1:32:18] said it that he doesn't see you. He only
[1:32:20] hears you. He sees your theophony body
[1:32:22] the way that he created us before the
[1:32:23] foundation of the world.
[1:32:26] My
[1:32:29] by a new and living way which he hath
[1:32:30] consecrated for us through the veil that
[1:32:33] is to say his flesh. and having an high
[1:32:36] priest over the house of God,
[1:32:40] let us draw near with a true heart in
[1:32:44] full assurance of faith, having our
[1:32:47] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience
[1:32:50] and our bodies washed with pure water.
[1:32:55] And what is that water, brothers and
[1:32:56] sisters? The water of the word.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Let that word wash over us.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Let that word change us. When it does,
[1:33:04] we can draw near with a true heart in
[1:33:08] full assurance of faith. Alls we have to
[1:33:11] do is die out to oursel daily. I think
[1:33:13] that's the critical key. That's all we
[1:33:15] have to do is die daily. Recognize
[1:33:17] there. We cannot walk in this world
[1:33:20] without this flesh stumbling us without
[1:33:22] this flesh tripping us up. But it
[1:33:24] doesn't matter whether it stumbles or
[1:33:26] triple trips this flesh up. It will
[1:33:28] never stumble or trip our soul. If we
[1:33:31] ever truly get the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:33] Ghost, we will never be able to walk
[1:33:35] away from this word. Why is that?
[1:33:37] Because we will never grieve the Holy
[1:33:39] Spirit to the place where we are not
[1:33:41] sealed till the day of our redemption.
[1:33:42] We will be sealed until the day of our
[1:33:44] redemption. We know many different
[1:33:46] religious organizations around the world
[1:33:48] teach that that you know you can be
[1:33:50] saved today, but if you sin, then you'll
[1:33:52] have to come and repent tomorrow because
[1:33:53] you'll be lost. No, no, no. You won't be
[1:33:55] lost. If you get saved today, you are
[1:33:57] saved until the day of your redemption,
[1:33:59] until you cross over. And you know, alls
[1:34:01] we do is we recognize that we sin. We
[1:34:03] recognize that we fall. And we recognize
[1:34:06] that there's only one way that we can
[1:34:08] make sure that we can draw near with a
[1:34:10] true heart with full assurance. That's
[1:34:13] recognizing that we've been washed by
[1:34:15] the water of the word, that it's his
[1:34:16] blood that sanctifies us. Verse 23 says,
[1:34:19] "Let us hold fast the profession of our
[1:34:22] faith without wavering.
[1:34:25] Isn't that beautiful? Let us do it,
[1:34:27] brothers and sisters. And I know we do,
[1:34:30] but I just hope that maybe we can just
[1:34:31] encourage one another today with these
[1:34:33] words. We know that Abraham staggered
[1:34:36] not at the promise of God through
[1:34:38] unbelief, right?
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; But what did he do? He was strong in
[1:34:43] faith, giving glory to God. He was
[1:34:45] willing to praise the Lord even when he
[1:34:46] didn't feel like it. Even when he did
[1:34:48] stumble, he did stagger at the word. He
[1:34:52] was a backslider. Remember when he went
[1:34:53] down into Egypt? Remember that? And he
[1:34:56] said, "You know what, Sarah, my
[1:34:58] beautiful wife, now that you've had a
[1:34:59] body change, you you got to tell them
[1:35:02] that you're my sister, because if you
[1:35:03] tell them, if if if we say that you're
[1:35:06] my wife, they're going to kill me
[1:35:07] because you're so beautiful, they're
[1:35:09] going to want to take you and make you
[1:35:11] one of theirs."
[1:35:12] This is God's prophet.
[1:35:15] Even though he did that, the word of God
[1:35:17] says that he staggered not at the
[1:35:19] promise of God through unbelief.
[1:35:22] I think it's beautiful because when uh
[1:35:24] she went down there, when he went down
[1:35:25] there, Brother Brandham brings that out.
[1:35:27] I don't think anybody else ever preached
[1:35:28] this, but they had a body change, didn't
[1:35:30] they?
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Someone met them on the plains of
[1:35:33] memory. And he identified who it was.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; He said it was God, Elohim.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; And we know that his nephew, he couldn't
[1:35:40] recognize it. He said two lords, two
[1:35:42] Lord doctrine started way back there.
[1:35:44] But we had this one who visited them,
[1:35:47] told them that I'm going to visit you
[1:35:49] according to the time of I promised you
[1:35:50] that you were going to have a promised
[1:35:52] seat. He had already tried to make it
[1:35:54] happen by getting with Hagar and and
[1:35:56] having Ishmamail and all of that. But
[1:35:58] here we have him actually going down the
[1:36:01] road with this one and and he met him
[1:36:04] and changed his body and changed her
[1:36:07] body. And this is so beautiful for me. I
[1:36:10] didn't understand this until I heard
[1:36:11] brother Brandham say it. Why would a
[1:36:13] king of another land desire Sarah, his
[1:36:18] wife, an old grandma? No offense to the
[1:36:22] grandmas here.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; But why would he?
[1:36:26] It's because her body was changed back.
[1:36:28] She was a young girl again.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; How did she give birth from her womb?
[1:36:34] It's because she had a body change.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; How do we give birth in our womb,
[1:36:39] brothers and sisters? We have a body
[1:36:41] change. We become a new creature in
[1:36:44] Christ Jesus. There's a new birth that
[1:36:46] takes place. It's not about saying that
[1:36:48] I just I I'll accept whatever the church
[1:36:50] believes and put my name on the page and
[1:36:52] call her good and go home. Bless God,
[1:36:55] I'm saved. We know that there's millions
[1:36:56] and billions of those impersonators in
[1:36:59] this world. But there's a few people
[1:37:02] that are actually willing to go all the
[1:37:04] way to a body change. Not not
[1:37:06] necessarily over there, but right here.
[1:37:08] How does the body change happen? I'll
[1:37:10] tell you how it happens. We get a new
[1:37:12] character inside of us. When the new
[1:37:14] birth happens in our life, this body no
[1:37:17] longer desires to do the things that it
[1:37:19] once did.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Our desires completely change. It
[1:37:24] becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Verse 22 says, "Let us draw near with a
[1:37:32] true heart in full assurance of faith,
[1:37:34] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:37:36] conscience." We don't have to come to
[1:37:37] church thinking that I'm an evil man. We
[1:37:40] don't have to live in the world thinking
[1:37:41] that I'm an evil person and I just need
[1:37:43] to do some sort of pentance pentance to
[1:37:46] to make it better. I I need to
[1:37:47] continually stagger at the promise
[1:37:50] because I just don't see it in my flesh.
[1:37:52] As long as we do that, we will never see
[1:37:54] it. But when we look away to Jesus,
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; when we stop looking at the problems in
[1:38:00] our lives,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; when we stop looking at the waves and
[1:38:03] the sea, remember the disciples were in
[1:38:05] the boat and the sea was contrary and
[1:38:07] and and Jesus drew near. And and they
[1:38:10] thought, "Oh, it's a spirit. Oh no,
[1:38:12] look." But then they recognized him.
[1:38:15] Peter said, "If it's you, Lord, bid me
[1:38:17] to come." And what did Jesus say? "Come
[1:38:19] on.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Come on."
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; And what did he do? He stepped out of
[1:38:23] the boat. The word of God says that he
[1:38:25] stepped down out of the boat and he
[1:38:27] began to step on the water.
[1:38:30] Peter even walked on water.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; But what did he do? Instead of looking
[1:38:37] at Jesus, he started to look at the sea.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; As soon as he started to look at the
[1:38:41] circumstances, down he went.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; And what did Jesus do? He didn't let him
[1:38:46] fall. He grabbed him and said, "Oh man,
[1:38:48] ye of little faith. Goodness, I say,
[1:38:52] Lord, increase our faith. Help us to
[1:38:53] look away to Jesus today and not look at
[1:38:56] the circumstances or situations. And and
[1:38:59] I take that to my own heart and soul,
[1:39:01] brothers and sisters. My Let's hold fast
[1:39:05] the profession of our faith without
[1:39:07] wavering. Let's hold on to that and
[1:39:09] stagger. Not at the promise of God
[1:39:10] through unbelief. We're going to
[1:39:11] stagger, but not at the promise of God
[1:39:14] through unbelief. What is unbelief?
[1:39:16] Unbelief is sin. Unbelief is what's
[1:39:19] going to take us away. If we've truly
[1:39:20] been baptized with the Holy Ghost,
[1:39:22] there's no unbelief that can take root
[1:39:23] in our lives.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Verse 24, I think it's so beautiful. And
[1:39:28] let us consider one another to provoke
[1:39:31] unto love and to good works.
[1:39:35] What a tremendous scripture. I I think
[1:39:37] it speaks for itself. Are we doing that?
[1:39:39] Are we applying that in our lives? Verse
[1:39:41] 25, not forsaking the assembling of
[1:39:44] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:39:46] is. Let's not forget this middle part in
[1:39:48] here, but exhorting one another. Many
[1:39:51] times that's left out and it's just, you
[1:39:54] know, not forsaking the assembling of
[1:39:55] ourselves together. Even more so as you
[1:39:57] see the day approaching. What it is is a
[1:39:59] legalistic interpretation of this
[1:40:01] scripture. There's people that don't
[1:40:03] have the revelation yet of what it means
[1:40:04] to come to church to get your oil topped
[1:40:07] up. It's not coming to church so that I
[1:40:09] can actually just say I'm a good church
[1:40:11] member. What we do is we come to church
[1:40:12] so that we can get our oil topped up.
[1:40:14] And sometimes, brothers and sisters,
[1:40:16] when we come to church, we've said it
[1:40:17] before in the past, it's not even for
[1:40:18] ourselves. We come to church so that we
[1:40:20] can be an encouragement to the brothers
[1:40:21] and sisters who are really going through
[1:40:23] a struggle.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; And they look around and see, wow,
[1:40:27] there's more people that are struggling,
[1:40:28] too. There's more people that believe
[1:40:30] this thing that is is compelling me to
[1:40:32] come to church.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Not forsaking the assembling of
[1:40:36] ourselves together, as the manner of
[1:40:38] some is, but exhorting one another.
[1:40:40] Didn't that just say that there? Let's
[1:40:43] consider one another to provoke unto
[1:40:46] love and to good works. My isn't it
[1:40:49] interesting how this scripture here
[1:40:50] could just be taken and spun in just a
[1:40:53] little tiny bit. Leave out just one or
[1:40:55] two word. We know that's what Satan
[1:40:56] does, isn't it?
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; We don't want to take this and apply it
[1:40:59] the way that it's not intended. We want
[1:41:02] to take the whole word of God because
[1:41:03] that's what's going to change our
[1:41:05] bodies. Verse 26 says, "For if we sin
[1:41:08] willfully after that we have received
[1:41:10] the knowledge of the truth, there
[1:41:12] remainth no more sacrifice for sins."
[1:41:15] And we can go back to Hebrews 6 and know
[1:41:17] that Brother Brandham preaches on that.
[1:41:19] He talks about the the sewer of the
[1:41:21] seed. We know the the man in white going
[1:41:24] around the earth that's dissed up and
[1:41:25] he's throwing his seed out. And right
[1:41:27] after that, he goes around the curvature
[1:41:29] of the earth. There's another one that's
[1:41:31] sinister man coming in black and he's
[1:41:34] sewing seeds as well as he goes around
[1:41:36] behind the one in the white and and
[1:41:39] brother Bradam talks about it. Those
[1:41:41] people who are once enlightened and have
[1:41:42] tasted of this heavenly gift it's
[1:41:44] impossible for them to come back and
[1:41:46] renew themselves. Once we have truly
[1:41:48] tasted of this heavenly gift, brothers
[1:41:50] and sisters, there ain't no going back.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; We sing that song, I'm going home
[1:41:54] because we know that's where we're
[1:41:55] going. And it doesn't matter what comes
[1:41:57] our way. Whether it's life or whether
[1:41:59] it's death, it doesn't matter. We
[1:42:01] recognize that death is simply a buggy
[1:42:04] that is hooked up to take us from the
[1:42:06] presence of this world into the presence
[1:42:08] of God. Because we know as believers to
[1:42:10] be absent in the body is to be present
[1:42:14] with the Lord.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; What a tremendous blessing that is.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; But if we sin willfully after we have
[1:42:20] received the knowledge of the truth,
[1:42:22] there remainth no more sacrifice for
[1:42:24] sins. That's why I think it's so
[1:42:26] treacherous when we look at the the word
[1:42:29] of God and the message of the hour from
[1:42:31] a a legalistic perspective. We we
[1:42:34] actually I believe we actually skirt
[1:42:37] with this scripture here. Because what's
[1:42:39] happening is we're judging others. The
[1:42:42] word of God says to judge not lest ye be
[1:42:44] judged also. Look away to Jesus. That's
[1:42:47] all we got to do is look away to Jesus.
[1:42:50] get the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:52] and we'll have grace because that's what
[1:42:54] saves us. It's grace. It's the grace of
[1:42:57] God. And and the only reason we are able
[1:42:59] to know that God sent a prophet. The
[1:43:01] only reason we're able to receive this
[1:43:03] message of the hour is because of his
[1:43:05] grace.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; It's not because our parents taught it
[1:43:09] to us, even though it is. It's not
[1:43:11] because we stumbled into a mission on
[1:43:13] the corner, even though it is.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; It's neither one of those. Brother
[1:43:18] Brandham talks about it. We're going to
[1:43:19] get into it with the last few minutes
[1:43:20] we've got here. I think it's so
[1:43:22] beautiful. But if we willfully sin after
[1:43:26] we've received the knowledge of the
[1:43:27] truth, what is the knowledge of the
[1:43:28] truth in a day in which we live? It's
[1:43:30] grace.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; It's the grace of God.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; It's not legalism.
[1:43:38] It's not my I've done this so I'm
[1:43:41] entitled or or or I've done that or I
[1:43:44] tithe or I I come to church and I do
[1:43:46] this in service and whatever whatever.
[1:43:48] None of that. It's a stench in the
[1:43:49] nostril of God's nose.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; If we don't have grace,
[1:43:55] if we have grace,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; then I believe he receives it as a sweet
[1:43:59] sacrifice.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; But you know, brothers and sisters,
[1:44:03] there is an absolute and that's the word
[1:44:05] of God. And and that word is first
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; and above all else.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; The word first above
[1:44:15] all else.
[1:44:17] You know, I sent the brothers some
[1:44:19] quotes here that I wanted to bring up,
[1:44:21] and I I just got them backwards today.
[1:44:23] So, we'll start with number three. I
[1:44:26] numbered them out of why we are not a
[1:44:29] denomination in 1958
[1:44:32] 0927.
[1:44:34] The message I believe Brother Brandham
[1:44:36] preaches for the most part in in almost
[1:44:38] every single sermon that he preaches,
[1:44:41] just about the entirety of the message,
[1:44:42] if you really listen, it's so beautiful
[1:44:44] the way he brings it. But in in this
[1:44:47] message, he says this here. He says,
[1:44:49] "Now look
[1:44:51] way back way back before this world
[1:44:55] started in them Adam's back yonder when
[1:44:58] God seen what was going to take place
[1:45:01] right there, he saw you."
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; This this this message, this kind of
[1:45:09] talking, this kind of description takes
[1:45:12] the word of God to a whole new level.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Way back before this world started in
[1:45:18] them, Adam's back yonder, when God seen
[1:45:20] what was going to take place right
[1:45:23] there, he saw you.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; He saw me.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; He saw every flea, every fly, every
[1:45:31] frog, every gnat. I I think about this
[1:45:35] myself and I think really that mosquito
[1:45:38] that I saw this morning.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; All of them.
[1:45:46] All of them. He's God.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; His ways are are beyond our
[1:45:51] comprehension.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; But he saw us.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; He saw us before there was even a speck
[1:45:57] of stardust. He says in another place in
[1:46:00] the message everything would ever be on
[1:46:04] earth. He saw it right then. Sure he
[1:46:07] did. He says now he never said I'll send
[1:46:09] my son down and let him die and maybe
[1:46:12] somebody will have pity on him and it'll
[1:46:15] be such a pitiful case perhaps maybe
[1:46:18] somebody might get saved. We were having
[1:46:20] a conversation about funerals
[1:46:23] and uh you know it's interesting because
[1:46:26] I had heard it said before. I I I was
[1:46:28] shocked to hear it even that it's a
[1:46:30] thing, but actually it's a real thing
[1:46:31] that you know, you can have a funeral
[1:46:33] and you can actually have paid mourers
[1:46:35] that will attend the funeral.
[1:46:39] I was talking to brother Timothy about
[1:46:40] it actually and uh he said, you know,
[1:46:42] sometimes they won't even know whether
[1:46:44] it's a man or a woman. They'll be
[1:46:46] mourning and then someone will say, did
[1:46:47] you know them? And and and and they'll
[1:46:49] say, you know, they'll just start crying
[1:46:52] again because they don't know whether
[1:46:53] it's a man or a woman. There's no
[1:46:54] description other than they're there to
[1:46:57] mourn. But isn't it an interesting
[1:46:59] thing, brothers and sisters, that that
[1:47:01] this is not the way it is with Jesus.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; This is not the way it is because Jesus
[1:47:07] was God coming down in flesh to express
[1:47:09] himself to this world and more than
[1:47:11] anything to be the perfect sacrifice to
[1:47:14] redeem his brethren as a kinsman
[1:47:16] redeemer. The only way that he could do
[1:47:19] it himself. But I just love how he says
[1:47:21] this here. Now, he never said, "I'll
[1:47:23] send my son and let him die, and maybe
[1:47:25] somebody will have pity on him, and
[1:47:26] it'll be such a pitiful case. Perhaps
[1:47:28] somebody might get saved." Why not?
[1:47:34] He forneew who would be saved.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; And this gets some people uncomfortable.
[1:47:39] I I I I pray that it won't hear today.
[1:47:43] To be fornown is actually a beautiful
[1:47:45] thing.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing. And that's
[1:47:48] really the only thing for a believer. In
[1:47:50] fact, we're not a believer if we're not
[1:47:52] fornown. That's the way it is. He
[1:47:55] forneew who would be saved. Yes, sir. Oh
[1:47:59] my, this is hard. He said, "Esau I hate
[1:48:03] and Jacob I love." And we know the word
[1:48:06] of God says, "Neither one of them having
[1:48:09] either one doing good or evil yet."
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; That's what the word of God says.
[1:48:15] Neither one even had a chance to express
[1:48:17] themselves. But that's the way he saw
[1:48:19] them
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; before either one ever had a chance to
[1:48:26] prove what they was because he knowed
[1:48:28] what they was. He knew. He knows
[1:48:32] everything. He knew what you would do
[1:48:34] before you were born or when the world
[1:48:36] began. Amen.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; So, I want to say this, brothers and
[1:48:40] sisters.
[1:48:42] When we fall down,
[1:48:46] remember, we're surprised, but he ain't.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; He is never surprised.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what we'll do about it.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we'll fall down and it'll go
[1:49:00] for days where we just know what we need
[1:49:03] to do, but this thing inside of us just
[1:49:05] wants to hold on. Remember, it's an evil
[1:49:07] spirit. The longer you hold on to it,
[1:49:09] the more you're entertaining the devil.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Tell the devil to beat it. Tell him
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; that you rebuke him in the name of
[1:49:15] Jesus.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; You don't have to scream and shout. You
[1:49:18] don't have to have a prayer meeting. You
[1:49:19] don't even need to come to the front of
[1:49:20] the church. You could just say it
[1:49:21] yourself.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; And remember, that's the bride's
[1:49:24] commission is to speak the word, the
[1:49:25] spoken word condition.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; That's the world in which we live in.
[1:49:29] The whole world is tapping into that
[1:49:30] through AI technology and so on and so
[1:49:33] forth. But here we have the bride of
[1:49:35] Jesus Christ. She has been given up to
[1:49:37] half of the kingdom. She's been given
[1:49:39] the king's ring. And the king said, "I'm
[1:49:41] not going to speak. You speak."
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Hmon wants to put you on the gallows.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; We can't rewrite the law. But you can
[1:49:50] say something.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; You can say something about it.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; The devil wants to take us and put us on
[1:49:56] the gallows. He wants to try and make us
[1:49:58] all upset and think that I I I just
[1:50:00] can't do it. You're 100% right if you
[1:50:02] think you can't do it because you never
[1:50:04] can. The only way we have success is
[1:50:07] because he lives in us.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; We sing that song. Because he lives.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; I can face tomorrow. Where does he live,
[1:50:15] brothers and sisters?
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; We're not looking to heaven.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; We don't need him in heaven. Even though
[1:50:21] we're going to be with him in heaven, we
[1:50:23] need him right here.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Where does he live? He lives in our
[1:50:26] hearts.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Now remember, the devil, he can't
[1:50:32] create. He can only pervert.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; The only thing that he can do is
[1:50:37] pervert. And that's exactly what he did
[1:50:39] at the very beginning was he perverted
[1:50:41] the word of God in the garden of God. He
[1:50:44] said one word off. And what did that do?
[1:50:47] That unleashed Satan's kingdom. It
[1:50:50] changed the world forever.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; But the devil can't create. And as I was
[1:50:56] preparing these notes, I I had a a
[1:50:58] thought and I just I'm so glad when the
[1:51:00] Lord inspires us. I I think it's
[1:51:02] important to say this, too. The devil
[1:51:03] can't read our thoughts.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; For the longest time, I thought he could
[1:51:08] because suddenly there would be this
[1:51:09] temptation that maybe I'm thinking
[1:51:11] about. But you know what that is? That's
[1:51:13] the devil trying to put his thoughts in
[1:51:15] our mind.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Those aren't our thoughts.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; But he's going to say, "Oh, I know what
[1:51:20] you were thinking." No, you don't know
[1:51:23] what I was thinking.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Because if you did, you wouldn't have
[1:51:25] been putting that thought there in my
[1:51:27] mind.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; But here's the thing. When those
[1:51:30] thoughts come, do we act on them?
[1:51:32] Because if we act on them, then what we
[1:51:34] do is we show him that we actually
[1:51:36] receive them.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Then we receive those thoughts. And the
[1:51:40] more we receive those thoughts, the more
[1:51:41] he's going to pour them out. He's going
[1:51:43] to call us boys and say, "Look, look,
[1:51:44] look, we're getting success with this
[1:51:46] over here. Let's bolster this. Call in
[1:51:48] the the reinforcements. We got to make
[1:51:49] sure we're getting through to this
[1:51:51] believer
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; because we want to trick him. We know
[1:51:54] he's a believer, but we want to trick
[1:51:56] him into thinking that he's not a
[1:51:58] believer.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; And that's the way he works. He can't
[1:52:01] create. He can't read our minds.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; The only thing he can do is take and
[1:52:07] twist the word of God, try and pervert
[1:52:09] it in our minds, try and make us think
[1:52:11] that there's some holy act that we can
[1:52:13] do to make ourselves good Christian
[1:52:15] people. The only thing that we can do is
[1:52:17] die to ourselves.
[1:52:20] and give him the full preeminence that
[1:52:22] he desires in our life.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; But he's going to take and twist the
[1:52:26] word. And you know, it's the reason why
[1:52:30] so many people are tossed about.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; So many people are tossed about. It's
[1:52:36] the reason why so many Christians find
[1:52:39] it hard to live the Christian life
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; because they're busy trying to do it
[1:52:45] themselves.
[1:52:47] They're not giving him the preeminence
[1:52:49] that he desires.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; And and how does that work, brothers and
[1:52:52] sisters? I'll tell you how it works.
[1:52:54] It's not easy. But it's why some people
[1:52:58] cannot keep the victory.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; And if you're wondering, these are all
[1:53:03] messages that Brother Brandham preached.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Why some people cannot keep the victory.
[1:53:09] Why so many Christians find it hard to
[1:53:12] live the Christian life. why so many
[1:53:14] people are tossed about.
[1:53:17] You have to go and listen to them and
[1:53:18] see what Brother Brandham has to say
[1:53:20] about it. But I'll just try and put it
[1:53:21] in a nutshell here for us. It's because
[1:53:23] people are not dying out to themselves
[1:53:25] entirely.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; They're still holding on to some
[1:53:28] tradition.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Back there where we had that church,
[1:53:32] that time that that day in which we
[1:53:34] lived, we did it this way. Or or or
[1:53:36] maybe even my parents taught it that
[1:53:38] way. You know what? If either one of
[1:53:40] those don't line up with this word for
[1:53:42] our day, let it go.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Because as long as we hold on to those
[1:53:46] things, we're not allowing him to
[1:53:48] actually hold us.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; We're busy holding on to the thing that
[1:53:52] we think is right. But what happens is
[1:53:54] it makes it impossible for a Christian
[1:53:56] to live the life. And I think it's
[1:53:58] beautiful because of the way God has it
[1:54:00] set up. It is impossible for us to live
[1:54:02] it. It has to be him. That's the only
[1:54:05] way that we will ever be able to measure
[1:54:07] up with this word is for him to live it
[1:54:10] through us.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; But what happens is the devil comes and
[1:54:14] gives some kind of perverted version of
[1:54:16] the word. And I'm not talking about a
[1:54:18] sexual perversion. I'm talking about
[1:54:20] just simply twisting one word, getting
[1:54:22] one word off. We know that he did it
[1:54:24] with Eve. Thou shalt not surely die.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; But that one word put the whole human
[1:54:30] race into chaos. Brothers and sisters,
[1:54:33] don't allow a perverted teaching of the
[1:54:35] word of God throw us off.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; We just have to die to our thinkings, to
[1:54:41] our traditions. Even unfortunately,
[1:54:45] I think it's so true. We have to die to
[1:54:47] our religion.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; We've got to die to our religion.
[1:54:52] Sometimes we have a religion. Even in
[1:54:54] the message, we'll say, "I I I'm a
[1:54:56] message believer, but I say this, that's
[1:55:00] nice.
[1:55:02] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:55:04] you believe?
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Is that what's happened? Or have we just
[1:55:09] received the message? Have we just got
[1:55:11] the head knowledge that God sent a
[1:55:13] prophet and and we know all about the
[1:55:15] quotes and we know all about the books
[1:55:17] and the tapes and the history and all
[1:55:19] the different people that had time spent
[1:55:21] with the prophet of God.
[1:55:24] That ain't going to save us because he
[1:55:25] never died for our sins. That's right.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; He brought us a message and that message
[1:55:30] was get into Christ.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Better yet, get Christ into you.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; And I I just love that message that we
[1:55:38] heard on Wednesday. Let's check our
[1:55:40] experience. Let's check up and make sure
[1:55:43] that we fit the pattern. We've been
[1:55:45] given the pattern. Let's shake
[1:55:47] ourselves. Let's die out to all those
[1:55:49] things and allow the peace of God to
[1:55:52] prevail in our lives.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:55] Because when we stop trying to do it
[1:55:56] ourselves and he does it, then we get a
[1:55:59] peace that passes all understanding.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; It goes beyond our comprehension. It
[1:56:04] goes way beyond anything we could ever
[1:56:06] imagine. People that once knew us will
[1:56:08] say, "Who are you and what have you done
[1:56:11] with my brother or my sister? Why are
[1:56:13] you such a different thing?" You can
[1:56:15] tell them, "Because I am a new creature
[1:56:17] in Christ Jesus."
[1:56:21] Amen.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful. We just need to
[1:56:24] allow the perfect peace of God to
[1:56:27] prevail in our lives when he, the spirit
[1:56:30] of truth, comes into our life, brothers
[1:56:31] and sisters. He, the personal pronoun,
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; so beautiful how the prophet back in the
[1:56:38] day was already using that lingo. Isn't
[1:56:41] it good? What's your pronoun?
[1:56:45] I think about it today. If somebody ever
[1:56:46] asked me that question, I'm going to
[1:56:48] tell them I am.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; I am. Because it's not me you're talking
[1:56:53] to.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; It's the Christ that lives inside of me.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's right here.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; But he, the personal pronoun, the spirit
[1:57:02] of truth, he will lead us and guide us
[1:57:05] into all truth. Our wisdom and
[1:57:07] understanding will lead us astray,
[1:57:09] brothers and sisters. We'll make a wrong
[1:57:11] turn. We'll go off the edge. We'll hit a
[1:57:14] guardrail and spin out. There's no way
[1:57:16] that we'll be able to manage on our own
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; out of why are we not a denomination?
[1:57:21] This is number two.
[1:57:23] Says, see where the Jehovah Witnesses
[1:57:25] would be so far wrong there to think
[1:57:28] that the new birth is the resurrection
[1:57:32] of the body.
[1:57:34] You see, it couldn't be. It's got to be
[1:57:37] something. And he he doesn't say exactly
[1:57:39] what it is there. I think it's so
[1:57:41] beautiful because he does go on to say a
[1:57:44] little more here. He says you you're in
[1:57:46] a time space
[1:57:49] and the only thing that's eternal is
[1:57:52] something that had no beginning or no
[1:57:55] end.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; So even talking about the eternal is
[1:57:59] something that we just have as a a a
[1:58:02] concept that we try to talk about and
[1:58:04] and explain. But unless we actually can
[1:58:08] be eternal, we can't really understand
[1:58:10] this on our own in in a human sense.
[1:58:15] with a faith sense we can. Faith is the
[1:58:18] substance.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; It's the evidence.
[1:58:23] Oh my. I don't want to go too far. He
[1:58:25] says you're in a time space and you're
[1:58:28] and the only thing that's eternal is
[1:58:30] something that had no beginning or no
[1:58:32] end. Anything eternal never had a
[1:58:35] beginning or it never will have an end.
[1:58:37] See, so if you're a part of God,
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; the spirit that's in you never had a
[1:58:43] beginning or it never will have an end.
[1:58:47] And you're eternal with the spirit
[1:58:50] that's in you. See,
[1:58:52] isn't that beautiful? It's like we just
[1:58:55] are able to become to know ourselves. We
[1:58:59] get introduced to ourselves when we hear
[1:59:01] a teaching like this to think that I I'm
[1:59:04] not even my own. I I'm I don't even know
[1:59:06] who I am. But we have a description of
[1:59:10] the character of ourselves when we look
[1:59:11] at ourselves like this by the character
[1:59:14] and description of Jesus Christ.
[1:59:17] He says like the agapo love when it
[1:59:19] comes down to the felio love and then
[1:59:23] down to lust love the digression of this
[1:59:26] life.
[1:59:28] It just keeps going on down and on down,
[1:59:33] perverting on down till it's become just
[1:59:37] a conglomeration to one mess. And you
[1:59:40] know, we don't have to look very far and
[1:59:42] we can say that's exactly where we are
[1:59:44] today. We were in B on Friday and I had
[1:59:48] to apologize to my son sitting in the
[1:59:51] front of of the vehicle as we watched
[1:59:54] I'll say a human being walk in front of
[1:59:57] the vehicle. Right? He was there. He saw
[2:00:00] it. I I had to apologize that this is
[2:00:02] the condition of life that we live in.
[2:00:05] This is how far down it's digressed.
[2:00:08] It's gone down that ladder. It's beyond
[2:00:10] just human lust. It's it's it's crazy is
[2:00:14] what it is naturally speaking. But it
[2:00:17] has to be that way in the day in which
[2:00:19] we live.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; But he says this like like the agapo
[2:00:22] love when it comes down to filio love.
[2:00:24] Agapo love is the love of Christ when it
[2:00:26] comes down to from the Christ to human
[2:00:29] love and and and that's the filio love
[2:00:31] and then it goes down to lust love and
[2:00:33] it gets down to I'll say maybe an animal
[2:00:35] thing and and it just keeps going down
[2:00:37] and down perverting until it's become
[2:00:39] just a conglomeration to one mess and I
[2:00:42] can't help but think that's where we
[2:00:43] live today brothers and sisters exactly
[2:00:45] that description
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; in that mess
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; well the only way Jesus came down that
[2:00:52] same ladder down here to pick up and
[2:00:55] take back up to the highest form, from
[2:00:58] the lowest form, from death unto life,
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; from sickness unto health,
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; from unrighteousness to righteousness.
[2:01:07] See,
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; the perversion to the perfect.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; First, it went from the perfect to the
[2:01:13] perversion. But he came down himself. He
[2:01:16] didn't send another angel, did he? He
[2:01:18] came himself to take it and bring it
[2:01:21] back to where it's supposed to be to its
[2:01:23] original estate. And we know in 1963
[2:01:25] something happened. It wasn't God's
[2:01:27] prophet that happened.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; He came himself to actually take it back
[2:01:31] to that perfection.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; He come from the highest to the lowest
[2:01:36] that he might bring the lowest to the
[2:01:38] highest. He become me that I might
[2:01:42] through his what? his grace become him
[2:01:46] an heir of the throne in glory. See what
[2:01:49] I mean? These things. Oh my, I think
[2:01:52] this is just so beautiful. You know, in
[2:01:55] the book of Acts talking about the
[2:01:57] promise, Acts 2:38 and 39. We know
[2:02:01] that's some of the most famous
[2:02:03] scriptures that we talk about. We know
[2:02:04] that that this is the the baptism in the
[2:02:07] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. But I
[2:02:08] want to talk about verse 39 here in Acts
[2:02:10] chapter 2. It says, "For the promise is
[2:02:12] unto you and to your children and to all
[2:02:15] that are a far off, even as many as not
[2:02:18] some ministry will call."
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Even as many as the Lord our God shall
[2:02:24] call. Why would he call them? Because
[2:02:26] they were fornown in him.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Let's turn over to Romans
[2:02:30] chapter 8. Now, I want to preach Romans
[2:02:34] chapter 8.
[2:02:36] I think it's absolutely beautiful. This
[2:02:38] is really where we live, brothers and
[2:02:40] sisters. I I hope it's where we live
[2:02:42] because it's the story of our lives when
[2:02:45] we can see that this is the word for our
[2:02:48] day. Some people are stuck in Romans
[2:02:51] chapter 7. And I know that and I live
[2:02:53] there myself, but I just say it over and
[2:02:56] over again. You know, there's there's
[2:02:58] there's going to be emnity between this
[2:03:00] flesh and the spirit. That's the way it
[2:03:02] is. This flesh is against the spirit.
[2:03:04] The spirit is against the flesh. It will
[2:03:07] be that way until our bodies change. But
[2:03:09] we can continually feed upon this word
[2:03:11] to the place where this flesh has very
[2:03:14] little strength. Not our spirit, but our
[2:03:17] our our flesh can have very little power
[2:03:19] over the creature. But just for the sake
[2:03:22] of time, I want to say this. Maybe if
[2:03:24] you want to see where I'm coming from,
[2:03:25] just go home and read Romans chapter 8.
[2:03:27] We we look at Romans chapter 7. It says,
[2:03:29] "Oh Lord, who can deliver me from this
[2:03:31] vile body?" We know I'm just
[2:03:32] paraphrasing there, but in verse one, it
[2:03:35] says of chapter 8, there is therefore
[2:03:37] now no condemnation to them which are in
[2:03:39] Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
[2:03:42] flesh, but after the spirit. That's why
[2:03:44] I say, brothers and sisters, let's not
[2:03:46] look around at brothers and sisters.
[2:03:48] Let's look away to Jesus. Let's look
[2:03:50] away to the word of God. Because if
[2:03:52] we're following the word of God, we're
[2:03:54] not going to be looking at our brothers
[2:03:55] and sisters according to their natural
[2:03:58] lives. But in Romans 8 verse 28, brother
[2:04:02] Brandham in this message, why are we not
[2:04:04] a denomination? He takes this scripture
[2:04:06] here. It's just so beautiful. Verse 28,
[2:04:08] he says, "And we know that all things
[2:04:11] work together for the good."
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Now, we need to make sure that we
[2:04:16] remember there's more to this scripture.
[2:04:19] All things work together for the good.
[2:04:21] Not just period, but to those who those
[2:04:26] who love God. to them who are the called
[2:04:30] according to his purpose.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Not everyone is called according to his
[2:04:35] purpose.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; So all things don't always work together
[2:04:39] for the good. But if we're called
[2:04:41] according to his purpose, if we're given
[2:04:43] a trial, we know that he's working out
[2:04:46] that character, that gold that he
[2:04:48] counseledled us to buy of him that's
[2:04:50] tried in the fire of fiery afflictions.
[2:04:53] Woo. It's terrible when we look at it as
[2:04:55] a human, but it's glorious when we look
[2:04:57] at it as a believer. We know that all
[2:04:59] things work together for good to them
[2:05:01] that are called, them, sorry, them that
[2:05:03] love God, to them who are the called
[2:05:05] according to his purpose. For whom he
[2:05:08] did forno, he also did predestinate to
[2:05:12] be conformed to the image of his son,
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; not to the image of a church. And I'll
[2:05:18] say this, not even to the image of a
[2:05:19] prophet,
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; the image of his son. Amen.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; The image of his son that he might be
[2:05:26] the firstborn among many brethren.
[2:05:29] Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them
[2:05:33] he also called. Whom he called, them he
[2:05:36] also justified, and whom he also
[2:05:39] justified them, he also glorified.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Now, don't get me wrong. I ain't
[2:05:44] throwing off on brother Brandham,
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; but I know if I I if he was sitting here
[2:05:48] right today, he'd be saying, "Amen. Look
[2:05:50] away to Jesus. Don't look at me. He even
[2:05:53] said it when he was here in his flesh. I
[2:05:55] must decrease so that he must increase.
[2:05:57] And you know, brothers and sisters,
[2:05:58] spirits don't die. There's spirits alive
[2:06:00] today where people still follow John the
[2:06:03] Baptist.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Some people want to follow Eleazar.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Others want to follow Christ.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; If we truly follow the teachings of
[2:06:13] William, Miriam, Brandham, he said,
[2:06:15] "Follow Christ."
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Behold the bridegroom.
[2:06:22] It's beautiful.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; But you know brothers and sisters, verse
[2:06:27] 31 says, "What shall we say? What shall
[2:06:29] we then say to these things? Oh my, if
[2:06:32] God be for us, who can be against us?
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; What can be against us? If God is for
[2:06:39] us, brothers and sisters, if we already
[2:06:41] have the fornowledge to know that he has
[2:06:44] called us unto adoption, who could be
[2:06:47] against us? It doesn't matter what comes
[2:06:49] our way. It doesn't matter what devil
[2:06:50] starts boasting down in the valley. We
[2:06:52] know that we can pick up a stone and go
[2:06:54] down there and kill him.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; He's a squatter. He's got no rights.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Out of why we are not a denomination.
[2:07:02] This is quote number one. Brother
[2:07:04] Brandham, he says, "Now, how what kind
[2:07:07] of people ought we to be?" Notice how
[2:07:10] these things take place. Now, those who
[2:07:14] he forneew, he called. Those who he
[2:07:16] called, he justified those when
[2:07:20] Was it when we went to church the first
[2:07:21] time? The first time our parents taught
[2:07:23] us. First time we picked up a Bible? No.
[2:07:26] When was it? When was it? Now, those who
[2:07:30] he forneew, he called, those who he
[2:07:32] called, he justified those when before
[2:07:34] the foundation of the world. Before the
[2:07:36] world ever began, he says, "Now, if we
[2:07:39] could take this scripture and really
[2:07:42] justify it, we'd take hours on it."
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; But we don't want to do that. But all
[2:07:48] this unrighteousness here is
[2:07:51] righteousness perverted.
[2:07:55] Isn't that interesting to think about?
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; This world that we live in, brothers and
[2:08:00] sisters, he says that's what the devil
[2:08:02] does.
[2:08:04] Now, when you come to the age of
[2:08:05] accountability and you know what's right
[2:08:08] and wrong and right, you're supposed to
[2:08:10] turn from your wrong because you're born
[2:08:12] in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the
[2:08:13] world speaking lies, then you're
[2:08:16] actually born as a sexual desire, and
[2:08:19] then you must be born again
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; as a human being. We don't have a
[2:08:23] choice. The way we come into this world,
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; we're born in sin, shaped iniquity. We
[2:08:28] come into this world speaking lies.
[2:08:29] Period.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Nothing we can do about that. We need to
[2:08:32] come to the place where we're able to
[2:08:34] say amen to that. And that's the first
[2:08:36] step. When we can recognize that, then
[2:08:38] we can realize we need to be born again.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; That's what being born again is, is
[2:08:43] having a new spirit placed within us.
[2:08:45] But not just a new spirit. Because we
[2:08:47] know, brother Bradom said, you could be
[2:08:48] mistaken. Because before his holy spirit
[2:08:50] comes, you get a new spirit. Why do you
[2:08:52] get a new spirit? Because your spirit
[2:08:54] can't even get along with your own
[2:08:56] spirit. We can't even get along with
[2:08:57] ourselves many times. That's why we need
[2:09:00] a new spirit to be able to behold the
[2:09:03] lamb of God when he comes into our life
[2:09:05] as the Holy Ghost. But he says in order
[2:09:07] to receive a new birth to enter into
[2:09:10] heaven because this kind of a birth you
[2:09:12] have here. It's the way that we're born
[2:09:14] here. But I love this scripture in
[2:09:17] Romans chapter 8:31. What shall we say
[2:09:19] then to these things? If God be for us,
[2:09:21] who can be against us?
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; You know, brothers and sisters, two
[2:09:26] halves make the whole. And we know the
[2:09:28] very beginning of all this teaching
[2:09:29] about the covenant was about how how
[2:09:31] Abraham he he was given the instruction.
[2:09:33] God said to him, I want you to lay out
[2:09:34] the sacrifice in array. And when you do,
[2:09:37] everything is going to be in place. I'm
[2:09:39] going to come down and visit you upon
[2:09:41] it. And we know that he he had to wait.
[2:09:43] We talked about it how the devils came
[2:09:45] around the birds and tried to mess with
[2:09:46] his sacrifice and what he shued them
[2:09:49] away. He had to wait upon the Lord.
[2:09:52] Those who wait upon the Lord shall renew
[2:09:53] their strength. But with all of this,
[2:09:55] there came a time where there was a lamp
[2:09:57] that came down and investigated all of
[2:10:00] that sacrifice that came between the two
[2:10:02] halves. And I can't help but think
[2:10:04] today, there is a pillar of fire. The
[2:10:06] exact same pattern that comes down and
[2:10:09] gets right between the two halves,
[2:10:11] between the soul and the spirit. The
[2:10:13] word of God is quicker and more
[2:10:14] powerful, sharper than any two-edged
[2:10:17] sword, and it gets right in between all
[2:10:20] of the joints in the marrow, even to the
[2:10:22] discerning of the hearts of men. He
[2:10:24] knows our thoughts. Right now, our
[2:10:26] thoughts are louder in heaven than
[2:10:28] voices that we could actually throw here
[2:10:30] on earth.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; But you know, the two halves always make
[2:10:34] the hole. There has to come a time where
[2:10:36] we can see and say that this covenant is
[2:10:39] not for some people in a foreign land
[2:10:42] somewhere else.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; This covenant is my covenant. This is
[2:10:46] what I want to preach today, brothers
[2:10:48] and sisters. This is my covenant. I
[2:10:51] can't help but think about how Caleb got
[2:10:53] to the place after they had crossed
[2:10:55] over. They were already in the promised
[2:10:57] land. What did Caleb do? He actually had
[2:11:00] eternal life. Well, he was there in the
[2:11:01] promised land, didn't he? The prophet of
[2:11:03] God said what eternal life is.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; It's living for others.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; And what what did he do? Caleb, a type
[2:11:12] of the bride. He followed the teachings
[2:11:15] of Joshua, a type of the Holy Ghost. He
[2:11:19] followed him. And what did he do? He
[2:11:21] helped positionally place all of his
[2:11:23] brethren and sisters in the land.
[2:11:25] Everybody got their place. But there
[2:11:26] came a time where he recognized, "Wait a
[2:11:28] second. Wait a second. and there's a
[2:11:30] covenant for me. And I just want to try
[2:11:33] and encourage us, brothers and sisters.
[2:11:34] Let's be like Caleb. And let's say, you
[2:11:36] know what, even though I know that I was
[2:11:38] 40 years younger when I came into this
[2:11:40] promised land, I I've labored a long
[2:11:42] time, but you know, there's still a
[2:11:44] mountain with my name on it, and I know
[2:11:46] the giants are there, but I know by the
[2:11:48] spirit of God that's living in me that
[2:11:50] I'm more than able to take that covenant
[2:11:52] because it's my covenant.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; He has given it to me. Amen.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; And even though in my flesh I might be
[2:11:58] 80 and four years old, I'm just as
[2:12:00] strong as the first day that I went
[2:12:02] across Jordan and got the baptism of the
[2:12:04] Holy Ghost.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Now give me my mountain.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Just beautiful to think about this. I'll
[2:12:12] call the musicians as we end here in
[2:12:15] Joshua 14 10. And now, behold, the Lord
[2:12:18] hath kept me alive. A as he said these
[2:12:22] 40 and five years, even since the Lord
[2:12:24] spake this word unto Moses, while the
[2:12:27] children of Israel wandered in the
[2:12:28] wilderness, and now, lo, I am this day
[2:12:31] four score and five years old. I'm
[2:12:33] sorry, he was 85.
[2:12:35] My
[2:12:38] I just can't help but think, if you're
[2:12:40] listening, Dad, you feel like you could
[2:12:42] climb a mountain and slay giants? My
[2:12:45] dad's 85 years old.
[2:12:47] As yet I am as strong this day as I was
[2:12:51] in the day that Moses sent me. As my
[2:12:53] strength was then, even so is my
[2:12:56] strength now for war, both to go out and
[2:12:59] to come in. Now therefore give me this
[2:13:03] mountain.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me as we close here
[2:13:06] today. Wherefore the Lord spake in that
[2:13:08] day, for thou heardest in that day how
[2:13:11] the Anakims were the giants, and that
[2:13:13] the cities were great and fenced. If so
[2:13:15] be the Lord be with me, then shall I
[2:13:19] shall be able to drive them out as the
[2:13:21] Lord said.
[2:13:24] And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto
[2:13:27] Caleb,
[2:13:29] the son of Japuna, Hebron, for an
[2:13:31] inheritance. Hebron therefore became the
[2:13:33] inheritance of Caleb, the son of
[2:13:35] Jeffuna, the Kennesite, unto this day,
[2:13:38] because that he followed that he wholly
[2:13:42] followed the Lord God of Israel. But we
[2:13:44] know, brothers and sisters, this was
[2:13:46] exactly what happened at Kadesh Barnea,
[2:13:49] isn't it?
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; There was a deciding time. I either have
[2:13:53] to believe that this true baptism of the
[2:13:56] Holy Ghost is for me or or I just can't
[2:13:58] do it. Even though God said I could do
[2:14:00] it, maybe I want to substitute it with
[2:14:03] something else. He's he's the same
[2:14:05] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; And I want to encourage us, brothers and
[2:14:09] sisters. Even if we don't understand it,
[2:14:11] don't don't talk about bad about it.
[2:14:13] just ask God to reveal it to us,
[2:14:19] you know. And Hebrews 11, boy, I' I've
[2:14:22] got so many notes. I just I'm going to
[2:14:24] end. Hebrews 11, brothers and sisters,
[2:14:27] faith is the substance of things hoped
[2:14:29] for.
[2:14:31] It's the evidence of things not seen.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; For by it, the elders obtained a good
[2:14:38] report.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; I I want to encourage us to obtain a
[2:14:41] good report. I I have Ephesians 1,
[2:14:44] Ephesians chapter 1. Go and read
[2:14:46] Ephesians chapter 1 and think about the
[2:14:48] covenant. Ephesians chapter 4. Uh my
[2:14:52] it's so amazing. You know, brothers and
[2:14:55] sisters, I might sound like a fanatic
[2:14:57] when I get into it like this, but I I
[2:15:00] don't know much. I'm not theologically
[2:15:02] trained, but I can tell you exactly how
[2:15:04] it got lit. And how it got lit was by
[2:15:07] full surrender. by saying that I don't
[2:15:09] understand it and I I can't even
[2:15:10] comprehend it, but I know the word of
[2:15:12] God says that he will lead me and guide
[2:15:14] me into all truth. And so, I'm going to
[2:15:17] put it on him to lead me and guide me
[2:15:19] into all this truth that we're talking
[2:15:20] about today. And I guarantee you, he
[2:15:23] certainly will.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; God, richly bless you today. Let's just
[2:15:26] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank
[2:15:29] you for your word. We thank you, Lord
[2:15:32] Jesus, that you are the same yesterday,
[2:15:35] today, and forever. that you never
[2:15:37] change, Lord. That heavens and earth
[2:15:39] will pass away, but your word will
[2:15:41] remain. So, Father, help us to take the
[2:15:43] book and eat it up just like we read in
[2:15:46] the book of Revelation chapter 10. Help
[2:15:49] us, Lord Jesus, to recognize that's the
[2:15:51] only thing that's going to separate us
[2:15:53] from the rest of this world is to have a
[2:15:55] new birth. Oh, Father, that that word,
[2:15:58] oh Lord, living out through us your very
[2:16:01] life,
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Zoe, God's own life,
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; through the baptism of our Holy Spirit.
[2:16:08] Father, we pray that you would just be
[2:16:10] with those who are away today, Father,
[2:16:12] wherever they are, those who might be
[2:16:14] tuning in. We know that you're more than
[2:16:16] able. You You fill all time and space,
[2:16:18] Lord. You're not bound by anything. And
[2:16:20] we just ask, Lord, that you would be
[2:16:22] with them and and comfort them, Lord.
[2:16:24] that you'd keep your hand upon them and
[2:16:26] bless their time away. And oh, Father,
[2:16:28] at the appointed time that you would
[2:16:30] bring them back safely. And Father, for
[2:16:32] our visitors here today, we pray that
[2:16:34] Lord, something of eternal value was
[2:16:37] ministered, Lord, that would encourage
[2:16:39] them. That Lord, they would just go with
[2:16:42] a a spring in their step, Lord, saying
[2:16:44] that they heard from you today.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would grant
[2:16:48] them traveling mercies as they go and
[2:16:50] have their time away as well, Father.
[2:16:53] Lord, we just want to ask that you would
[2:16:54] keep your hand upon each one of us,
[2:16:56] Father, as we go our separate ways
[2:16:58] today. Give us strength and
[2:17:00] encouragement, Lord. Help us, Lord, to
[2:17:02] draw from that inexhaustible fountain of
[2:17:05] the life that you have given us. Lord,
[2:17:09] help us, Lord Jesus, to recognize full
[2:17:11] surrender. Oh Lord, full obedience to
[2:17:15] the complete word of God entitles us to
[2:17:17] that token to be sealed until the day of
[2:17:20] our redemption. We love you and we thank
[2:17:22] you. We just commit each life into your
[2:17:24] hands now for your glory. In Jesus
[2:17:26] Christ's name we pray.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:31] Amen.
[2:17:35] Marvelous grace,
[2:17:37] marvelous
[2:17:39] grace of our loving
[2:17:44] Lord.
[2:17:46] grace that exceeds
[2:17:49] our sin and our guilt.
[2:17:54] Yonder on Calaryies
[2:17:58] Mount
[2:18:00] poured
[2:18:02] there where the blood of the lamb
[2:18:08] was split.
[2:18:10] Grace,
[2:18:12] grace.
[2:18:15] God's
[2:18:17] grace.
[2:18:19] Grace that will pardon and cleanse
[2:18:25] with him.
[2:18:27] Grace,
[2:18:29] grace.
[2:18:32] God's
[2:18:34] grace,
[2:18:36] grace that is greater than all
[2:18:42] our sin.
[2:18:44] Sin and despair like the sea waves cold
[2:18:53] threaten the soul
[2:18:57] with infinite
[2:18:59] loss.
[2:19:00] [Music]
[2:19:05] Yes, grace
[2:19:07] untold
[2:19:09] points to the refuge the mighty
[2:19:16] cross.
[2:19:18] Grace,
[2:19:20] grace
[2:19:22] God's
[2:19:24] grace,
[2:19:26] grace that
[2:19:29] pardon and cleanse.
[2:19:33] Amen.
[2:19:36] Praise
[2:19:39] God's
[2:19:41] grace.
[2:19:43] Grace that is greater than all my sin.
[2:19:51] [Music]
[2:19:52] Dark is the stain that we cannot
[2:19:58] hide.
[2:20:00] What can a veil
[2:20:04] to wash it away?
[2:20:08] Look, there is flowing
[2:20:12] a crimson
[2:20:15] tide,
[2:20:17] whiter than snow you make me
[2:20:23] today.
[2:20:25] Grace,
[2:20:27] grace.
[2:20:29] God's
[2:20:32] grace.
[2:20:36] Pardon
[2:20:38] plans within
[2:20:42] grace.
[2:20:44] grace.
[2:20:46] God's
[2:20:48] grace.
[2:20:50] Grace that is greater than all our sin.
[2:21:00] Marvelous,
[2:21:01] infinite,
[2:21:03] matchless
[2:21:05] grace
[2:21:07] freely
[2:21:09] bestowed.
[2:21:11] [Music]
[2:21:17] that are longing to see
[2:21:22] his face.
[2:21:25] Will you this moment his grace
[2:21:30] receive
[2:21:33] grace
[2:21:35] grace
[2:21:37] God's
[2:21:39] grace
[2:21:41] grace that will pardon and cleanse
[2:21:47] within
[2:21:50] grace.
[2:21:52] grace.
[2:21:54] God's
[2:21:56] grace.
[2:21:58] Grace that is greater than all
[2:22:04] our sin.
[2:22:07] Isn't it beautiful that that grace will
[2:22:10] wash us white? It won't whitewash us.
[2:22:13] It'll wash us from the inside out.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Because of that grace, we can sing this
[2:22:19] song by Revelation. I'll fly away.
[2:22:22] Some glad morning
[2:22:25] when this life is over.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, some glad morning
[2:22:32] when this life is over, I
[2:22:36] I'll fly away
[2:22:40] to a home on God's celestial shore.
[2:22:46] I fly away. Are you going to fly?
[2:22:50] Hallelujah.
[2:22:52] I'll fly away. Oh, glory. I'll
[2:22:58] fly away.
[2:23:02] I'll never die. Halleluah. By and by,
[2:23:07] high.
[2:23:09] I'll fly away.
[2:23:13] And the shadows of this life have thrown
[2:23:20] up my way.
[2:23:22] Hallelujah.
[2:23:23] Like a bird from prison bars has flown.
[2:23:29] I
[2:23:30] fly away.
[2:23:34] I
[2:23:36] fly away. Oh glory.
[2:23:39] I'll
[2:23:41] fly away.
[2:23:45] I'll never die. Hallelujah. By and by,
[2:23:50] I'll
[2:23:52] fly away.
[2:23:54] Just a few.
[2:23:57] [Music]
[2:23:58] Weary days and day
[2:24:01] I'll
[2:24:03] fly my fly away
[2:24:06] to a land where joys will never end.
[2:24:11] I'll
[2:24:13] fly away.
[2:24:15] [Music]
[2:24:16] I'll
[2:24:18] fly away. Oh glory. I'll
[2:24:24] fly away.
[2:24:25] [Music]
[2:24:27] I'll never die. Hallelujah. By and by I
[2:24:34] fly away.
[2:24:37] Hallelujah.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Do you ever think about that? That time
[2:24:41] where we recognize it's happening. This
[2:24:45] is it, brothers and sisters. It's going
[2:24:47] to happen. And the only reason it can
[2:24:50] happen is because of the original life.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that song today. It sounds
[2:24:56] like we want to sing.
[2:24:59] God's attributes. God's attributes were
[2:25:03] manifested to his bride. In this last
[2:25:06] age, we have caught the revelation by
[2:25:10] the last prophet's message. And we know
[2:25:14] who we are and what we're raised up for.
[2:25:18] Praise the Lord. It's the original life.
[2:25:22] Hallelujah.
[2:25:26] The original seed, Abraham's royal seed,
[2:25:30] glory.
[2:25:34] The son of man is revealed. The seventh
[2:25:37] seal is unveiled. The original life,
[2:25:42] the original sea.
[2:25:45] We are the word made flesh today. Book
[2:25:48] of Ephesians.
[2:25:50] Our names are seen within. Hallelujah.
[2:25:55] Yes, we are anointed
[2:25:59] and we are inspired by our God who's the
[2:26:03] original life,
[2:26:06] the original life,
[2:26:08] the original seed.
[2:26:11] The original word,
[2:26:14] it's what I believe.
[2:26:16] The son of man is revealed. The seventh
[2:26:20] seal is unveiled. The original light,
[2:26:24] the original seed.
[2:26:31] [Music]
[2:26:33] Saints will wake and join us for
[2:26:35] translation in this hour. Gentile days
[2:26:39] soon will be over. Glory hallelujah to
[2:26:43] our God.
[2:26:45] The original life.
[2:26:48] The original life.
[2:26:50] The original seed,
[2:26:53] the original word. It's what I believe.
[2:26:58] The son of man is revealed. The seventh
[2:27:02] seal is unveiled. The original life,
[2:27:06] the original seed.
[2:27:09] Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[2:27:15] Maybe as we close today, we'll just sing
[2:27:17] that song. You deserve the glory.
