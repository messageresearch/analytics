Description:
Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic hosts proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem

CHORUS
Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

Christ by highest heav'n adored
Christ, the everlasting Lord
Late in time behold Him come
Off-spring of a virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail th' incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with men to appear
Jesus our Immanuel here

Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace
Hail the Son of righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Ris'n with healing in His wings
Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth

Come, Desire of nations, come
Fix in us Thy humble home
Rise, the woman's conqu'ring seed
Bruise in us the serpent's head
Adam's likeness now efface
Stamp Thine image in its place
Second Adam from above
Reinstate us in Thy love
