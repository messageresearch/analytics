[59:50] fullness of times he might gather
[59:53] together in one
[59:55] all things in Christ both which are in
[59:57] heaven and which are on earth even to
[1:00:01] him in whom also we have obtained an
[1:00:05] inheritance being predestinated
[1:00:06] according to the purpose of him who
[1:00:09] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:00:11] his own
[1:00:13] will that we should be to the praise of

[1:00:45] time Heavenly Father Lord we just want
[1:00:47] to commit this service into your hands

[1:00:53] we've spoken Lord J Jesus that it would
[1:00:56] just resonate in the hearts of your
[1:00:57] children that we would begin to
[1:00:59] recognize father who we are that this
[1:01:02] spiritual Amnesia would begin to peel
[1:01:04] away from our lives Lord that we would
[1:01:07] see that we have an inheritance already
[1:01:10] waiting for us in heaven undefiled Lord
[1:01:14] something that's reserved for each and
[1:01:15] every one of us who are able to believe

[1:01:40] believe your brother-in-law sorry
[1:01:43] brother sister Becky's brother he'll be
[1:01:46] heading back to Congo on Thursday just
[1:01:48] want to remember him in prayer that the
[1:01:50] Lord will grant unto him traveling
[1:01:51] mercies amen a happy this morning
[1:01:55] amen just a few announcements before we
[1:01:57] get too far we canel the potluck this
[1:02:00] afternoon due to the weather the
[1:02:02] temperatures we're just not equipped yet
[1:02:04] in the hall for colder temperatures one
[1:02:07] of these days we'll get a heater I'm
[1:02:09] sure um so the potluck is canceled
[1:02:12] please don't uh don't come anticipating
[1:02:14] the potluck it's not happening so we
[1:02:18] have uh a gym night on the
[1:02:21] 31st it's uh Halloween night the rest of
[1:02:23] the world's going to go and celebrate
[1:02:25] all of the evil and everything that this
[1:02:27] world consists of and uh we have an
[1:02:30] opportunity just to get together and
[1:02:32] fellowship with brothers and sisters of
[1:02:34] like Precious faith and just have a
[1:02:36] little fun maybe toss around a ball or
[1:02:38] two and uh so we'll definitely look
[1:02:41] forward to
[1:02:43] that and we have uh the first Saturday
[1:02:46] in November coming up very soon and that
[1:02:48] means we will be turning back the clocks
[1:02:50] we will gain an extra hour in our day
[1:02:53] and uh uh we know we've heard people say
[1:02:56] that it's just like clipping off the
[1:02:58] bottom of a blanket and then sewing it
[1:03:00] to the top of the blanket you still have
[1:03:02] the same blanket but I guess for a few
[1:03:05] months we will have a a little bit of a
[1:03:07] difference in the way we operate we'll
[1:03:09] have some more Daylight and that's the
[1:03:10] purpose of it so uh time change is
[1:03:13] coming up Saturday uh November 5th
[1:03:16] please uh just take note of that and uh
[1:03:20] you know if you if you don't uh you'll
[1:03:22] wind up coming to church an hour early
[1:03:24] and that's not a bad thing that's right
[1:03:27] can set an atmosphere for the service
[1:03:29] and you know do you believe that you
[1:03:31] have the ability to change the entire
[1:03:33] atmosphere of the service one person can
[1:03:36] do that for Better or For Worse it just
[1:03:40] depends on where we are where where we
[1:03:42] stand and we come to church to be Washed
[1:03:46] by the Water of the word and I I believe
[1:03:48] we all have the same desire and if we
[1:03:50] don't I pray that we will have very soon
[1:03:54] that we'll have the same desire because
[1:03:56] as we read this morning you know that in
[1:03:58] the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:04:00] times he might gather together in one
[1:04:04] not two not three not many different
[1:04:06] churches not many different sects of the
[1:04:09] message of the hour not many different
[1:04:11] ideas and and and teachings and
[1:04:13] traditions but he wants to gather
[1:04:15] everything together in one and the only
[1:04:17] way we're going to get there is to let
[1:04:19] his mind be in us and the only way we're
[1:04:22] going to get that is to actually get the
[1:04:23] Holy Ghost
[1:04:24] the only way we're going to get that is
[1:04:26] to come according to his word for our
[1:04:28] day we have the ability to come we have
[1:04:30] the ability to get that but we just need
[1:04:33] to surrender to it I'm sure many people
[1:04:36] have heard um I hope it's okay I'm just
[1:04:39] going to take a couple minutes and just
[1:04:41] talk about brother Billy Paul he passed
[1:04:44] away this week on October the 19th at
[1:04:47] 3:33
[1:04:49] a.m. and uh I just think it's
[1:04:51] interesting how that was what was
[1:04:54] documented the exact time of death and I
[1:04:56] know that's the same way for every human
[1:04:58] officially there has to be a record of
[1:05:00] it but just specifically in our
[1:05:01] brother's life there's no accident that
[1:05:05] moment that second when he took his very
[1:05:08] last breath was actually ordained in
[1:05:10] heaven before the foundation of the
[1:05:11] world for him to come across it was no
[1:05:15] accident there was no Changing of the
[1:05:17] Guard there was no situational thing
[1:05:19] that happened this this wasn't an
[1:05:21] accident he died of natural causes but
[1:05:23] it was the time for him to come home
[1:05:25] that's when God said now it's time for
[1:05:27] him to cross over that River and we know
[1:05:31] uh I'm sure most of us if not all of us
[1:05:33] have have seen the write up about this
[1:05:35] about the dream that uh brother Billy
[1:05:38] Paul told about seeing his daddy on the
[1:05:40] other side of a river just before he
[1:05:42] passed away he had this dream he he
[1:05:44] dreamt of seeing his daddy on the other
[1:05:45] side of the river and his daddy said to
[1:05:47] him this is Brother Bram he said to him
[1:05:50] brother Billy son you look tired and he
[1:05:53] said Oh Daddy I am am and he said come
[1:05:55] walk with
[1:05:57] me can you imagine that and just shortly
[1:06:00] after that he actually did cross over
[1:06:02] that River and we know there's a write
[1:06:04] up about it but uh he passed away at 88
[1:06:07] years of
[1:06:08] age and uh I just think it's it's it's
[1:06:12] neat to to look at the situation because
[1:06:15] we can see that he was an old
[1:06:17] man and we know that there's an an oral
[1:06:20] tradition there's a discussion about how
[1:06:22] Billy Paul talked about his dad and him
[1:06:25] standing in Los Angeles once upon a time
[1:06:28] that was after the service where brother
[1:06:29] branam he under the inspiration of the
[1:06:32] Holy Spirit he said capernium capernium
[1:06:35] thou who Hast exalted yourself into
[1:06:38] heaven and he speaking about Los Angeles
[1:06:40] the City of Angels you've exalted
[1:06:43] yourself into heaven but you shall be
[1:06:44] brought down into hell we know that was
[1:06:46] the same thing that Jesus said about
[1:06:48] capernium in the New Testament and we
[1:06:51] know that happened very well capernium
[1:06:54] went under the
[1:06:56] ocean but many times people have taken
[1:06:59] that and and and and actually blended it
[1:07:02] together with the discussion about Los
[1:07:05] Angeles and California specifically
[1:07:07] slipping into the ocean where brother
[1:07:09] bradam said that will happen he said
[1:07:11] California's doomed that's right he said
[1:07:13] that's going to happen thus saith the
[1:07:15] Lord that's going to happen and when a
[1:07:17] prophet says thus sayith the Lord that's
[1:07:18] time to perk up your ears when you're a
[1:07:20] Believer we know this I know it but what
[1:07:22] I do want to say this morning is that we
[1:07:25] know brother Billy Paul heard his dad
[1:07:28] say standing in Los Angeles after the
[1:07:30] services that where he prophesied that
[1:07:32] he said that one day you're going to be
[1:07:34] standing uh here where you're standing
[1:07:36] right now there's going to be sharks
[1:07:38] swimming in around this building the May
[1:07:41] building in Los Angeles before before
[1:07:43] year and old man and now we have brother
[1:07:46] Brandon passing away at age 88 how many
[1:07:48] people in and around the message of the
[1:07:50] hour were looking for the Great
[1:07:51] Earthquake of California to slip into to
[1:07:54] the ocean to see that that prophecy
[1:07:56] would be
[1:07:57] fulfilled but we know I'm sure that we
[1:08:00] know brother Juma God bless you brother
[1:08:02] it's good to see you again everybody
[1:08:04] knows that brother Juma is married I
[1:08:05] didn't see you there brother
[1:08:07] congratulations brother
[1:08:14] Juma we look forward to talking to you
[1:08:16] and meeting your bride soon
[1:08:18] brother but we know that this this this
[1:08:21] prophecy went forward about uh shark
[1:08:24] swimming brother brother Billy Paul said
[1:08:26] that his daddy told him that sharks
[1:08:27] would be swimming at this building or in
[1:08:30] this building before you're an old man
[1:08:32] and at what age do you become an old man
[1:08:35] is really the discussion I think it's
[1:08:37] important to have the discussion because
[1:08:39] like I said some people had actually
[1:08:41] taken and potentially Blended the
[1:08:43] Prophecies of California sliding into
[1:08:46] the ocean to Billy Paul being an old man
[1:08:49] but at age 88 years old here he passes
[1:08:51] over into glory and California's still
[1:08:54] there even right now this morning we
[1:08:56] know it's still there it's important for
[1:08:58] us to recognize that we can't take and
[1:09:01] make it what we want it to be and it's
[1:09:04] even more important I believe and I'm
[1:09:06] sure we would all say Amen to it to
[1:09:08] Simply take what's on the tapes we can
[1:09:11] hear a lot of different discussions in
[1:09:12] and around the message well brother
[1:09:14] brandham said this and and and he did
[1:09:16] that and and all of the other things and
[1:09:18] they can be absolutely 100% true but
[1:09:21] they were not recorded as thus saith the
[1:09:23] Lord like the tapes were right right so
[1:09:27] it's important for us to remember that
[1:09:30] uh just because we didn't see California
[1:09:31] slip into the ocean that doesn't change
[1:09:33] any part of the message of the hour that
[1:09:35] doesn't change at one iota and I just
[1:09:38] love what brother Toby said a little
[1:09:39] while ago and I'll probably just dwell
[1:09:41] on it for a little while as we go
[1:09:42] forwards in the coming days weeks and
[1:09:44] months you know if brother bradam were
[1:09:46] even come back from the dead and say you
[1:09:48] know I made a mistake I made an error in
[1:09:50] the message of the hour a Believer today
[1:09:53] of the message of of the hour is going
[1:09:54] to say you know what it's too late I
[1:09:56] already believe you can't change my mind
[1:09:59] because why because I've met him I've
[1:10:03] met the Lord Jesus Christ for myself
[1:10:05] I've had a real experience with him and
[1:10:07] that was the purpose of the Prophet for
[1:10:09] our day was to introduce us to
[1:10:11] Christ not to get us to follow his
[1:10:18] family I just want to quote Brother
[1:10:20] Joseph because I think it's so true
[1:10:25] oh this is going
[1:10:27] to oh my my my bear with me
[1:10:32] today ah the microphones are giving me
[1:10:35] grief um Brother Joseph he quotes this
[1:10:39] this is his words here friends we know
[1:10:41] the coming of the Lord is so very near
[1:10:44] this is Brother Joseph bradam and for
[1:10:46] the record we having a discussion the
[1:10:47] other night with the deacons and I just
[1:10:48] want to say it too I think it's
[1:10:50] important for everybody to know exactly
[1:10:51] where I stand I don't know where you
[1:10:53] stand that's up to you it's between you
[1:10:55] and God where you stand with the message
[1:10:57] of the hour Brother Joseph Bram and all
[1:10:59] of that Brother Joseph bradam in my
[1:11:00] opinion he's our brother 100% our
[1:11:03] brother he has done so much for the
[1:11:05] Bride of Jesus Christ he's the reason
[1:11:07] why we have it on all of the digital
[1:11:09] media that we
[1:11:11] have there's no reason to get hung up on
[1:11:13] trying to judge him and say that this
[1:11:16] should be that and all you know what
[1:11:18] brothers and sisters if we're doing that
[1:11:19] it's a critical spirit and we better
[1:11:21] pray that the Lord would take it away
[1:11:22] from us because how will the world know
[1:11:25] that we love
[1:11:28] him that we've got love for one another
[1:11:30] that we can take a wooden spoon and
[1:11:32] spank someone correct them and and tell
[1:11:34] them that we love them no so that we can
[1:11:37] actually truly genuinely love them from
[1:11:39] our
[1:11:42] hearts Joseph is quoted saying friends
[1:11:45] we know the coming of the Lord is so
[1:11:46] very near we pray that brother Billy's
[1:11:49] call home will not discourage you right
[1:11:54] but may it encourage us all today as we
[1:11:57] reflect on the life of a true and
[1:12:00] faithful servant of
[1:12:02] God tremendous words if you go to the
[1:12:06] voice of God website you can see that on
[1:12:08] there you can read the whole article but
[1:12:09] I just wanted to bring that one one part
[1:12:11] just to underline and and and and
[1:12:14] highlight and Bolden and just really
[1:12:16] excuse me impress this that you know we
[1:12:19] don't want to look for a natural event
[1:12:22] right to say that we need to change
[1:12:23] change something in our lives or get
[1:12:25] right what we need to do is say right
[1:12:28] now we have the opportunity to get right
[1:12:30] because when we leave this building
[1:12:31] today it might be over for us and you
[1:12:33] know what I I I don't want to be really
[1:12:35] scary I don't want to scare anybody but
[1:12:37] two two times recently we've had
[1:12:40] accidents right outside our door
[1:12:43] here one of these times one of our Lives
[1:12:46] could be called home and what we call an
[1:12:49] auto accident won't be an accident that
[1:12:51] will be God saying it's time for my my
[1:12:53] dear dear son or my dear daughter to
[1:12:54] come home but have we got it fixed up
[1:12:58] we're probably going to get into this a
[1:12:59] little bit later in the service this
[1:13:01] morning but brothers and sisters death
[1:13:02] is not going to change who we
[1:13:05] are who you are right now is who you're
[1:13:08] going to be
[1:13:10] there so if you're filled with the Holy
[1:13:13] Ghost and you just have the the the the
[1:13:15] ability to worship freely and just say
[1:13:17] Amen to the word of God and you're not
[1:13:19] worried about criticizing people and
[1:13:22] criticizing min
[1:13:24] and looking at all these different
[1:13:25] things
[1:13:26] around husbands and wives criticizing
[1:13:29] one another brothers and sisters
[1:13:31] siblings forget about it
[1:13:34] all it's a critical spirit knocking on
[1:13:36] your door saying will you let me in I
[1:13:38] want to come in it's a critical spirit
[1:13:40] it's the same thing as being afraid what
[1:13:42] do we have to be afraid
[1:13:44] of do we believe that God's in
[1:13:47] control you know why we get afraid
[1:13:49] brothers and sisters is because we know
[1:13:51] something ain't right inside our soul
[1:13:53] that's why we get scared that's what
[1:13:56] causes us to have a fear in our lives
[1:13:59] but you know when we actually can take
[1:14:01] that fear and say hey I rebuke you in
[1:14:03] the name of Jesus Christ I'm not
[1:14:04] supposed to be afraid that's the devil
[1:14:06] trying to make me
[1:14:09] afraid I want to encourage everyone go
[1:14:11] and listen to the Future
[1:14:13] home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:14:15] Earthly bride and listen to what brother
[1:14:18] brandham says in there and you know
[1:14:20] it'll take a little while it's a long
[1:14:21] message is not as long as Christ is the
[1:14:24] mystery of God revealed it's half as
[1:14:25] long but maybe just try and break it up
[1:14:27] into three parts part one part two part
[1:14:30] three first hour second hour third hour
[1:14:32] and when you get into the second and
[1:14:33] third hour brother bradam God through
[1:14:35] brother bradam really starts to
[1:14:38] express what we're heading for brothers
[1:14:40] and sisters we're going to a world that
[1:14:43] is just like we have but perfect Amen to
[1:14:47] think about it no storm clouds he says
[1:14:50] no typhoons nor tornado es no hurricanes
[1:14:55] no sickness no
[1:14:57] germs no
[1:14:59] sin and no death that's where we're
[1:15:03] headed
[1:15:04] for and he's already come to redeem this
[1:15:07] world he's already spilled his blood on
[1:15:11] this Earth so it could be redeemed but
[1:15:14] it's not going to be Redeemed by water
[1:15:17] that was Noah's message this time it's
[1:15:19] going to be Redeemed by fire amen and
[1:15:22] this whole entire world is set up just
[1:15:24] like a a a room full of mouse traps
[1:15:28] everybody knows what a mouse trap looks
[1:15:29] like a picture a room full of mous traps
[1:15:33] and somebody just takes a pingpong ball
[1:15:35] and just throws it into that room full
[1:15:37] of mous traps this world is set up now
[1:15:39] with all of the countries that have
[1:15:41] nuclear arms just set up ready to go and
[1:15:44] if you listen to this message brother
[1:15:45] bham talks about how this world's going
[1:15:47] to be baptized with Holy Fire this world
[1:15:50] is going to be completely cleansed it's
[1:15:52] gonna it's going to it's going to be
[1:15:54] washed thoroughly before he can come
[1:15:56] back and we'll get into all those quotes
[1:15:58] but I just think it's beautiful how how
[1:16:00] Joseph Bram he says this friends we know
[1:16:02] the coming of the Lord is so very near
[1:16:04] and we know as Believers that it's never
[1:16:06] been closer that's my words but he says
[1:16:09] we pray that brother Billy's call home
[1:16:11] will not discourage you don't look for a
[1:16:14] natural circumstance don't assume that
[1:16:16] it should be a certain way if someone
[1:16:18] has taught us that it's incorrect if
[1:16:21] somebody has said that Billy PA is going
[1:16:23] to be an old man before the coming of
[1:16:25] the Lord or or whatever we want to put
[1:16:27] it as don't look at it that way just get
[1:16:30] your heart right make sure that we know
[1:16:32] where we're going to go when we
[1:16:34] die because there are some people who
[1:16:37] are here that will not taste of death
[1:16:40] but in a moment in the twinkling of an
[1:16:42] eye they'll be changed in an instant
[1:16:45] into that new glorious body
[1:16:49] amise we're not going to get there if
[1:16:52] like I said said we're busy
[1:16:54] criticizing if we're busy criticizing
[1:16:56] we've got a critical spirit if we're
[1:16:59] afraid we've got a spirit of
[1:17:02] fear if we're angry we've got a spirit
[1:17:05] of anger these are all spirits and and
[1:17:09] just we need to make sure that we
[1:17:11] understand that the Bride of Jesus
[1:17:13] Christ that elect lady the one that he's
[1:17:16] coming back for whose bodies will be
[1:17:17] changed in the moment of twinkling eye
[1:17:19] all hell is is bombarding her at this
[1:17:22] very moment even right now in the
[1:17:24] service I can feel it myself but you
[1:17:26] know what greater is he that is in me
[1:17:28] than he that is in this world because
[1:17:30] this world is built on Satan's
[1:17:33] technology this this whole entire world
[1:17:35] civilization is of the devil is what
[1:17:37] brother brandham says those are sharp
[1:17:40] words I know some people won't like that
[1:17:41] but that's the truth according to the
[1:17:43] word of God but if you don't believe in
[1:17:46] the word of God then I guess we don't
[1:17:47] have a whole lot to talk about
[1:17:50] right you know brother bradam and Billy
[1:17:52] Paul they were there and La after that
[1:17:53] prophecy and and and brother Ram he said
[1:17:57] that and they were standing in front of
[1:17:58] the May building in Downtown Los Angeles
[1:18:00] and you know it was quoted there's a a a
[1:18:02] YouTube video where where brother Tim
[1:18:04] puit he's he's he's mentioning it that
[1:18:07] someone was listening to the Paul Harvey
[1:18:08] Show in the US Once Upon a Time and they
[1:18:11] talked about how there was an earthquake
[1:18:13] in Los Angeles and how there was a flood
[1:18:16] subsequent flood that came in and
[1:18:18] actually washed sharks into this may
[1:18:20] building and they were swimming there
[1:18:23] I don't know if they lived or they died
[1:18:25] or what else happened from there but
[1:18:27] that was back in the
[1:18:28] 70s and how old was brother Billy Paul
[1:18:30] then I was going to do the math I was
[1:18:32] thinking about it but I got sidetracked
[1:18:33] and I didn't do it but you know if it
[1:18:35] was 1975 or anywhere in the 70s in that
[1:18:38] decade if you were to just deduct that
[1:18:39] from 88 years old where he is today how
[1:18:42] old was he you know brother bradam said
[1:18:43] he was old at age 50 so I guess I'm an
[1:18:45] old
[1:18:46] man but you know he was quoted as saying
[1:18:50] that you won't be an old man but
[1:18:52] there'll be sharks swimming
[1:18:53] here and that prophecy if if it's true I
[1:18:57] don't know if it is I tried to look it
[1:18:59] up honestly I tried to fact check myself
[1:19:01] here with this I wanted to see if you
[1:19:03] could find anything on the May building
[1:19:05] it it's a Sabin building now it's
[1:19:07] renamed but I wanted to see if there was
[1:19:09] actually anything in Wikipedia or online
[1:19:12] that I could find I know I saw an
[1:19:13] article at one point that's the reason I
[1:19:15] was looking for it I saw an article at
[1:19:17] one point and and maybe somewhere I'll
[1:19:19] have it if I do I'll share it with you I
[1:19:21] think I might have saved it but I'm not
[1:19:23] sure where anyways whether whether it
[1:19:26] was fulfilled or not is that going to
[1:19:28] change our opinion of the message of the
[1:19:30] hour because I would say this brothers
[1:19:32] and sisters if that's the case then we
[1:19:34] have got the wrong message of the
[1:19:37] hour the right message of the hour is
[1:19:39] going to say Christ Christ in you Christ
[1:19:43] in me the hope of glory anything else is
[1:19:49] false right you know prophecies can be
[1:19:54] fulfilled without us even knowing about
[1:19:57] it just like where where we read the
[1:20:00] book of Revelation and we say that you
[1:20:02] know there's the the the mother of
[1:20:04] harlots and and all of the harlots all
[1:20:06] the daughters that are underneath her
[1:20:08] all we know brother Ram said very
[1:20:09] clearly that that's Rome out and say
[1:20:12] that all the denominational churches are
[1:20:14] now Roman
[1:20:16] Catholic they're not but it's
[1:20:19] interesting because if you look at it
[1:20:21] most of them believe the apostles Creed
[1:20:23] where did that come
[1:20:25] from how does that work most of them
[1:20:27] believe in trinitarian Doctrine
[1:20:30] trinitarian baptism where does that come
[1:20:32] from if you go back and you look at the
[1:20:34] history you can see it but what I'm
[1:20:36] saying is all of the daughters have
[1:20:39] already paid homage homage to Rome amen
[1:20:44] they're already signed up it's already
[1:20:46] happened it's not something we're
[1:20:47] looking for to happen they're already
[1:20:49] there that's right and you know brothers
[1:20:51] and sisters without the Holy Ghost in
[1:20:52] our lives I've said it so many times
[1:20:54] without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:20:56] we've already accepted the mark of the
[1:20:57] beast by not accepting the Holy Ghost In
[1:21:00] Our Lives because we're born in sin
[1:21:02] shaped in iniquity we come to this world
[1:21:03] speaking lies you've got the mark of the
[1:21:04] beast when you come out of your mother's
[1:21:06] womb that's the way it is that's really
[1:21:10] harsh too but it's true because we
[1:21:12] didn't come into this world The Way We
[1:21:13] were supposed to right at the end of
[1:21:16] that message future home of the Heavenly
[1:21:18] Bride of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:21:21] Earthly bride brother bradam he Ted
[1:21:22] talks about serpent seed very clearly he
[1:21:24] really spells it out in that last hour
[1:21:27] of that message and we're not going
[1:21:29] there I'm not going to read that quote
[1:21:31] but just need to be careful where we put
[1:21:33] our faith brothers and sisters we can
[1:21:36] put our faith in in oral tradition we
[1:21:38] can put our faith in family tradition we
[1:21:41] can say well that's not the message that
[1:21:43] I believe that's not the message that my
[1:21:45] parents taught me you know I would say
[1:21:47] take the message that that is is printed
[1:21:49] in the books and and played on the tapes
[1:21:51] make that the message message that you
[1:21:53] believe because that message points to
[1:21:55] the word of God every other message
[1:21:58] brothers and sisters any other
[1:21:59] interpretation is going to leave us in a
[1:22:02] tribulation and that time has never been
[1:22:05] closer like I said we're we're we're
[1:22:08] we're actually living on a powder cake
[1:22:10] right now the way this world is set up
[1:22:13] we know there's a time where the whole
[1:22:14] world is going to be surrounding Israel
[1:22:17] who knows if this is the time now but
[1:22:19] when has there ever been two carrier
[1:22:21] strike groups groups right beside
[1:22:24] Israel the
[1:22:26] US how how how many countries are
[1:22:29] actually pro Israel today not very
[1:22:33] many and it looks like there's probably
[1:22:35] going to be less in the very near future
[1:22:38] and we know there's a time where the
[1:22:39] whole world turns on
[1:22:43] Israel we have to make sure we know
[1:22:45] where we're put in our faith and this is
[1:22:47] what I'm getting at today brothers and
[1:22:48] sisters this this verse 10 of Ephesians
[1:22:50] chapter 1 that in the dispensation of
[1:22:52] the full of times he might gather
[1:22:55] together in one all things in Christ
[1:22:57] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:22:58] in Earth even in
[1:23:00] him who is him Christ Jesus the Holy
[1:23:05] Ghost the earnest of our
[1:23:09] inheritance we have to make sure we know
[1:23:11] where we stand we have to make sure we
[1:23:13] know where we put our faith and and that
[1:23:16] it's in the one who sent the prophet and
[1:23:18] it's not based on the prophet's family
[1:23:21] and it's not based on maybe something
[1:23:23] that the prophet did but it's based in
[1:23:25] very specifically on the one who sent
[1:23:28] the
[1:23:29] prophet because we know this Prophet was
[1:23:32] an elaser he was he was sent to call a
[1:23:36] bride that the Lord wanted to choose
[1:23:40] himself and we know that that's exactly
[1:23:42] why he came and we know that's exactly
[1:23:43] what he's
[1:23:44] done I'm so sorry I can hear this
[1:23:50] thing it bugs me when I hear puffing
[1:23:54] puffing puffing continually
[1:23:57] sorry
[1:24:01] um so we have a quote here that I
[1:24:04] definitely want to
[1:24:06] read oh
[1:24:09] my actually I don't think I gave it to
[1:24:11] you brother so I'll just read
[1:24:16] it bear with me for a
[1:24:19] second instead of Look Away to Jesus 19
[1:24:25] 63 brother Bram says it's so sacred that
[1:24:28] I mustn't say much about it as he told
[1:24:30] me in the beginning said this say
[1:24:33] nothing of it you remember that years
[1:24:35] ago speaks for itself
[1:24:38] see I just read that and I thought man
[1:24:40] this is so true isn't it speaks for
[1:24:42] itself that life that's inside of every
[1:24:46] believer it speaks for itself see but
[1:24:49] I've I've tried to explain the others
[1:24:51] and made aist mistake can you believe
[1:24:54] that Prophet said it he made a
[1:24:57] mistake it's true though he was a human
[1:25:00] and he knew it he says this will be the
[1:25:03] thing that to my opinion I don't say the
[1:25:06] Lord tells me this this will be a thing
[1:25:09] that will start the rapturing faith for
[1:25:11] the going away see and it I must lay
[1:25:15] quiet for just a little while now
[1:25:19] remember and who is listening to this
[1:25:21] tape you might see such a change in my
[1:25:25] ministry right away dropping back not
[1:25:27] going up dropping back we're right at
[1:25:31] the age now and it can't be can't go any
[1:25:34] further we have to wait just a minute
[1:25:37] until this happens over here to catch up
[1:25:41] then the time
[1:25:42] comes but it's thoroughly
[1:25:46] identified he's speaking cryptically but
[1:25:49] I'm sure when we have ears to hear what
[1:25:51] the spirit saith unto the church we can
[1:25:53] recognize what he's saying there he had
[1:25:56] to back away he had to decrease brother
[1:25:59] bradam had to decrease he even said so
[1:26:01] so that he could increase but where was
[1:26:04] he going to increase brothers and
[1:26:06] sisters in
[1:26:08] you in the bride body the mystical body
[1:26:12] of Jesus Christ that's where he's going
[1:26:14] to
[1:26:15] increase yes brother bam says we have to
[1:26:18] wait just a minute until this happens
[1:26:19] over here then the time comes but it's
[1:26:22] thoroughly identified and it was in his
[1:26:24] ministry but nowadays I just want to say
[1:26:27] it this way I'm sure that it's
[1:26:29] thoroughly identified in each and every
[1:26:31] one of our Lives Hallelujah as we heard
[1:26:34] as we heard we have this Blessed
[1:26:37] Assurance why cry speak the word and I'm
[1:26:41] sure that every one of us has
[1:26:42] experienced that in our lives if we
[1:26:45] speak the word many times things just
[1:26:48] happen in our lives and we're like how
[1:26:49] did that
[1:26:50] happen but else we have have to do is
[1:26:52] just say thank you Lord because every
[1:26:54] good gift comes from
[1:26:56] above it comes from the Lord everything
[1:26:59] that happens in our lives is because
[1:27:01] he's chosen for it to happen
[1:27:06] Amen brother bradam oh my I don't know
[1:27:09] how I did this and
[1:27:13] countdown paragraph 175 he says now look
[1:27:18] I've said some pretty rough
[1:27:19] things about airplane
[1:27:23] automobile remember they are horsepower
[1:27:26] too all of it is horsepower amen the
[1:27:30] church is just moving up holy ghost
[1:27:35] power is the holy ghost that we're
[1:27:38] justified by yes says you ministers know
[1:27:42] that don't you the Holy Ghost sanctifies
[1:27:45] us the Holy Ghost fills us amen the Holy
[1:27:49] Ghost gives us rapturing faith see as we
[1:27:53] move up and I'll just be completely
[1:27:56] honest with you I was looking for the
[1:27:57] quote where brother brandham says
[1:27:59] rapturing faith lies on those
[1:28:02] tapes but I believe this with all my
[1:28:04] heart we can say that we need the
[1:28:07] prophet to actually have a Rapture but I
[1:28:10] I I'll say it with all my heart brothers
[1:28:12] and sisters you can have the message all
[1:28:13] you want books and tapes but until you
[1:28:15] get the Holy Ghost in your life you will
[1:28:18] not have a Rapture there will not be a
[1:28:20] change of our bodies without the rapture
[1:28:22] without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives I
[1:28:23] mean we will not have a Rapture but the
[1:28:26] way we get the Rapture the way we get
[1:28:28] the Holy Ghost is through the message of
[1:28:30] the hour but it can't just be books and
[1:28:32] tapes it can't just be an association or
[1:28:35] a membership it's got to be the life of
[1:28:37] Jesus Christ Living out through us
[1:28:39] because when we eat the book the message
[1:28:42] of the hour we become the book the
[1:28:44] message of the hour and the message of
[1:28:46] the hour is literally Christ Jesus
[1:28:48] himself to this world Hallelujah the
[1:28:52] prophet said I must decrease John the
[1:28:54] Baptist said I must decrease so that
[1:28:57] Jesus Christ can increase amen William
[1:28:59] brandham said it too there won't be two
[1:29:01] of us standing here at the same time if
[1:29:03] what's happening is what I think is
[1:29:05] happening there won't be two of us
[1:29:06] standing here at the same time and we
[1:29:08] know sure sure enough he preached the
[1:29:10] seals he preached a few couple years
[1:29:13] later and the Lord took them off the
[1:29:15] scene but why so that we could come to
[1:29:19] know him ourselves Hallelujah the way
[1:29:21] that the prophet of God got to know him
[1:29:24] himself we can't put it off on anybody
[1:29:27] else it's got to be ourselves doing the
[1:29:29] harder work it's got to be ourselves
[1:29:31] dying out to ourselves every single day
[1:29:34] we have got to be willing to decrease so
[1:29:37] that he can increase it can't be me plus
[1:29:41] him he won't share his glory with
[1:29:44] nobody right it's got to be him and him
[1:29:49] alone talking a little bit about
[1:29:51] rapturing Faith this morning it's a
[1:29:52] little bit maybe of a sideline just to
[1:29:54] get us maybe setting the background for
[1:29:57] where I want to get to maybe pick up
[1:29:58] from where we left off last
[1:30:01] week brothers and sisters it's going
[1:30:03] home time amen all of the signs around
[1:30:07] demonstrate that this is not a place fit
[1:30:10] for the Bride of Jesus Christ right amen
[1:30:12] there's so many things that are going on
[1:30:14] in this world that we don't even know
[1:30:16] about that are already taking place
[1:30:18] they're already happening they're
[1:30:20] already being instigated all the these
[1:30:22] discussions the envoys going to the
[1:30:24] Middle East and talking about things all
[1:30:26] of that stuff that's happening what are
[1:30:27] they really talking about who knows I
[1:30:29] don't want to get into conspiracy things
[1:30:31] but what I do want to say is this world
[1:30:33] is coming together in one and so are the
[1:30:37] Bride of Jesus Christ so are all of the
[1:30:39] things in heaven that we read from that
[1:30:40] scripture this morning in Ephesians 1
[1:30:43] chap 1:1 in dispensation of the fullness
[1:30:46] of times we have seen the dispensation
[1:30:48] of the fullness of times all of the
[1:30:50] church ages have happened brother bradam
[1:30:52] in the future home even says that the
[1:30:54] leoan church age is over it's gone it's
[1:30:59] done but we know that there's a blending
[1:31:02] there's some people that are still in
[1:31:03] the lean Church age if you are this
[1:31:05] morning brothers and sisters I want to
[1:31:06] say come out of her my people and be not
[1:31:09] partakers of her sins the leoan church
[1:31:12] age is going to go
[1:31:14] through it's going to go through not
[1:31:18] good but the Bride of Jesus Christ she's
[1:31:20] given the word he's given the entire
[1:31:23] mystery having made known unto us the
[1:31:25] mystery of his will what's his will it's
[1:31:28] his word amen his will is his word amen
[1:31:32] and we know that he esteems his word
[1:31:34] greater than his
[1:31:35] name and it's beautiful when we can look
[1:31:38] at that as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:31:39] because we know that that's the truth
[1:31:42] and when he's really made himself known
[1:31:44] to us
[1:31:45] personally that is really our desire is
[1:31:48] his word not just his name we want his
[1:31:52] word could you imagine a wife marrying a
[1:31:55] husband and saying and it happens in
[1:31:57] this world we know it some people will
[1:31:59] get married and say oh I've got his
[1:32:01] name that's all in jesus' name the whole
[1:32:05] entire denominational world is saying in
[1:32:07] jesus' name in jesus' name and sure
[1:32:09] enough there's power in jesus' name we
[1:32:10] know brother brandham talked about the
[1:32:12] witch doctors levitating the table and
[1:32:14] and they said you know in the name of
[1:32:16] the president or all these different
[1:32:17] things and he just let them know that
[1:32:19] there was only one name that had the
[1:32:20] ability to over power those spirits that
[1:32:22] were levitating that table in jesus'
[1:32:24] name that table Came Crashing Down many
[1:32:28] people want Jesus to be their God but
[1:32:31] they don't want him to be their lord in
[1:32:33] order for him to have full preeminence
[1:32:36] we esteem his word above his name amen
[1:32:39] and we recognize that's where the power
[1:32:41] is many people will say oh my that's Old
[1:32:44] Testament Customs that's another
[1:32:46] tradition from some other time but is it
[1:32:48] brother brandham said it very clearly
[1:32:50] the Garment that pertains to a man
[1:32:52] shouldn't be worn by a woman there's a
[1:32:54] reason why we don't cut our hair because
[1:32:57] the word of God says that's the female's
[1:32:58] covering amen
[1:33:02] amen out of 56 raising Gus's daughter
[1:33:05] brother bam says now our lord Jesus was
[1:33:08] a very busy man when he was here on
[1:33:11] Earth he was in greatly in demand he
[1:33:16] never stayed in one place but just a
[1:33:19] little bit at a time then he would go
[1:33:21] somewhere
[1:33:22] else they persuaded him to stay in the
[1:33:25] city different places stay with us you
[1:33:28] could only imagine that we would want to
[1:33:29] do the same stay with us Fellowship
[1:33:33] excuse me spend some
[1:33:35] time they persuaded him to stay in the
[1:33:37] city different places stay with us but
[1:33:39] he said I've got to go to this other
[1:33:41] city for that's what I've been sent for
[1:33:45] he didn't stay in one city but just a
[1:33:46] day or maybe an hour or two at a time
[1:33:49] and performed a miracle leaving the rest
[1:33:52] of his meeting for his disciples that
[1:33:54] was to follow
[1:33:56] him now we find him a few days before
[1:33:59] this he had before this great things he
[1:34:03] had done and just a few hours before the
[1:34:06] instant that were speaking of he'd been
[1:34:10] crossing a sea tired
[1:34:13] weary virtue had gone out of him people
[1:34:17] had been
[1:34:18] healed he'd been preaching the gospel
[1:34:21] and on his road across the sea over to
[1:34:24] the land of
[1:34:26] gadera he got so tired and we till he
[1:34:29] laid down in the back end of the
[1:34:32] boat some of them had fixed a little
[1:34:35] pillow back there because they loved him
[1:34:38] and when they was rowing and the sails
[1:34:39] going and all the apostles moving with
[1:34:41] their oares he'd gotten so sleepy so
[1:34:44] tired and War see he was a man in one
[1:34:47] sense he was God in another sense amen
[1:34:51] he was man in flesh in spirit he was God
[1:34:55] he says we just went through that so we
[1:34:58] know the story very well he's on the
[1:35:00] ocean and we know Satan was saying now
[1:35:02] I've got you now I'm going to put you
[1:35:04] under brother bam goes on to say the
[1:35:06] Dove came on the lamb and they two
[1:35:08] became one the lamb was one creature the
[1:35:11] dove was another creature and when the
[1:35:13] Dove and the man the Dove and the lamb
[1:35:17] United together God was manifested in
[1:35:20] the flesh that's
[1:35:22] right you can see where this is going
[1:35:24] and now he's manifested in your flesh by
[1:35:29] being adopted Sons and Daughters to the
[1:35:31] kingdom of God Amen not just by
[1:35:35] association not because I was born into
[1:35:38] a family that believes the message of
[1:35:40] the hour not just because my family did
[1:35:43] great things for the prophit of God not
[1:35:46] just because we we we attend and we're H
[1:35:49] H fundamental members of a church that
[1:35:52] believes this message of the hour he
[1:35:54] says he's manifested in your flesh by
[1:35:57] being adopted Sons and Daughters to the
[1:35:59] kingdom of God through the baptism of
[1:36:01] the Holy
[1:36:02] Spirit that's right and you become joint
[1:36:05] HS with the Lord Jesus Christ oh Church
[1:36:10] you got the power if you got the faith
[1:36:13] to use it with that's right yes so I
[1:36:17] want to say this morning brothers and
[1:36:19] sisters the prophet of God God through
[1:36:23] the prophet said you've got the power to
[1:36:26] use it amen if you got the
[1:36:29] faith amen so of course that just poses
[1:36:33] the question how do I get that Faith how
[1:36:35] does faith
[1:36:37] come Faith cometh by hearing hearing of
[1:36:40] the word of God Amen we can't stay away
[1:36:43] from service and expect the faith to be
[1:36:45] activated we cannot not feed on the word
[1:36:48] throughout the week and expect the word
[1:36:51] to not actually be activated to not get
[1:36:53] that level of faith if we want that
[1:36:55] level of Faith we've got to be in
[1:36:56] constant communion with the
[1:37:00] Lorden I thought it was so good we were
[1:37:02] talking about this and brother Emanuel
[1:37:04] he made a point he said you know we
[1:37:06] should have such a prayer life such a
[1:37:09] life of prayer that our daily lives get
[1:37:13] in the way of our conversation with god
[1:37:16] and I thought isn't that true isn't that
[1:37:18] exactly the way it should be in the life
[1:37:19] of a Believer because the word of God
[1:37:21] says that we should pray without ceasing
[1:37:22] how can we be on our knees 24/7 we can't
[1:37:25] do it but what we do have is a
[1:37:26] consciousness of God and we have a a
[1:37:29] conversation we're always fellowshipping
[1:37:31] with the Lord saying oh Lord see the
[1:37:34] situation see the circumstances oh Lord
[1:37:36] watch that brother watch that sister oh
[1:37:39] look at this person they have no idea
[1:37:40] that you even exist Lord make yourself
[1:37:43] real to that person we're always
[1:37:45] constantly in prayer and then every once
[1:37:47] in a while we have to pick up the phone
[1:37:48] and answer a call for work or maybe we
[1:37:50] have to get behind the the steering
[1:37:52] wheel of a 737 and go fly somewhere or
[1:37:55] or maybe we just have to deal with our
[1:37:57] children Our Lives get in the way of our
[1:38:00] natural life gets in the way of our
[1:38:02] prayers brothers and sisters but it
[1:38:04] doesn't mean that we can't have that
[1:38:06] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:09] let's turn over to Ephesians chapter
[1:38:11] 3 Ephesians chapter
[1:38:20] 3
[1:38:24] it's talking about our age the day in
[1:38:27] which we live in recognizing our
[1:38:30] position not just our position maybe in
[1:38:32] the church and in the body and maybe in
[1:38:34] our families but our position in Christ
[1:38:37] our position in the church ages our
[1:38:40] position in in the dispensation of the
[1:38:43] times of the
[1:38:45] ages in Ephesians 3:1 says for this
[1:38:48] cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Jesus
[1:38:51] Christ for you Gentiles so now we know
[1:38:54] he's speaking directly to us if ye have
[1:38:56] heard of the dispensation of the grace
[1:38:58] of God which is given me to your word
[1:39:00] how that by
[1:39:02] Revelation he made known unto me the
[1:39:05] mystery now that's where it gets a
[1:39:07] little bit funny because only Revelation
[1:39:11] only comes by the Spirit by the holy
[1:39:13] spirit in our lives and we're going to
[1:39:15] get into this on Wednesday in in the
[1:39:17] introduction it's actually chapter one
[1:39:19] of the exposition of the seven Church
[1:39:21] ages brother Bram you could go ahead and
[1:39:23] read on I stopped purposely last
[1:39:24] Wednesday because it's such an important
[1:39:27] topic brother bradam says Revelation
[1:39:29] true Revelation to the True Believer can
[1:39:32] never ever be underestimated we've got
[1:39:34] to recognize we have got to have
[1:39:36] Revelation every single one of us it's
[1:39:38] not just for our parents it's not just
[1:39:40] for the deacons or the trustees or the
[1:39:42] the song leader or grandma or Grandpa
[1:39:45] it's got to be our own Revelation it's
[1:39:47] got to be Christ in us the hope of glory
[1:39:51] verse three how that by Revelation he
[1:39:53] made known unto me the mystery what
[1:39:56] mystery he says as I wrote a four in few
[1:39:59] words whereby when ye read he's talking
[1:40:02] about you now when ye read ye may
[1:40:05] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[1:40:07] of Christ which in other Ages was not
[1:40:10] made known Unto the Sons of men as it is
[1:40:13] now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and
[1:40:17] Prophets by the spirit amen now we might
[1:40:20] stop there and say well that's given to
[1:40:22] the Holy Apostles and the prophets and
[1:40:23] sure enough it was but for why for the
[1:40:27] perfecting of the Saints so that they
[1:40:29] could be perfected so that we could
[1:40:30] catch the true Revelation by bringing a
[1:40:33] pure word we could get a pure revelation
[1:40:36] of our own verse six says that the
[1:40:38] Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of
[1:40:41] the same body and partakers of his
[1:40:43] promise in Christ by the
[1:40:47] gospel I think it's just wonderful
[1:40:49] brothers and sisters and I I want to say
[1:40:51] that we have been given the ability
[1:40:53] through the message of the hour to be
[1:40:55] able to understand what Paul's knowledge
[1:40:57] in the mystery of Christ was amen
[1:41:00] because brother Bram who preached the
[1:41:01] same thing that Paul preached brought
[1:41:04] the message that Christ gave to him
[1:41:07] through Revelation through
[1:41:08] inspiration Christ is the mystery of God
[1:41:13] revealed Christ being God not not the
[1:41:17] Oneness where we're regenerated by water
[1:41:20] baptism
[1:41:21] and not the trinitarian doctrine father
[1:41:23] son Holy Ghost titles but right down the
[1:41:26] middle is what brother bradam says right
[1:41:27] in the middle of both of those is what
[1:41:29] he's bringing that's what he brought to
[1:41:32] the world out of 1960 as the eagle
[1:41:35] stirreth paragraph
[1:41:37] 258 he says that woman sitting there
[1:41:40] rubbing her eyes with a red hat on
[1:41:43] sitting right there do you believe Jesus
[1:41:45] heard you when you asked him to heal
[1:41:48] them sinus headache Brothers and sisters
[1:41:51] this is the story about the prophet of
[1:41:53] God but what I want to say today and we
[1:41:56] all know this but sometimes we need our
[1:41:58] our Pure Minds to be stirred up by way
[1:42:00] of remembrance sometimes we need to
[1:42:02] recognize that the same God that was
[1:42:04] there in that meeting that we're reading
[1:42:06] about is the same God that's right here
[1:42:08] this morning and he has every single
[1:42:11] intention of meeting every single need
[1:42:13] that you have a desire of in your heart
[1:42:16] but the only way it's going to come is
[1:42:17] through the Revelation that what I'm
[1:42:19] speaking to you is actually true that's
[1:42:23] right that woman sitting there rubbing
[1:42:25] her eyes with a red hat on sitting right
[1:42:27] there do you believe Jesus heard you
[1:42:30] when you asked him to heal them sinus
[1:42:32] headache do you believe he heard
[1:42:36] you I just want to say that again do you
[1:42:38] believe he heard you amen because
[1:42:41] brothers and sisters he will meet the
[1:42:43] need in your heart supernaturally
[1:42:46] whereby you will say the same thing that
[1:42:47] the king of Assyria said how does he
[1:42:50] know the words that are being spoken in
[1:42:52] my bed chamber how does he know the
[1:42:54] secret desires of my heart I'll tell you
[1:42:56] what I don't but he does and if you want
[1:43:00] to hear an answer from him all you've
[1:43:01] got to do is pull on the word and he
[1:43:03] will answer you it's the same God do you
[1:43:07] believe he heard you you was praying
[1:43:09] about it wasn't you if that's right
[1:43:12] stand up on your feet if that's the
[1:43:14] truth put up your hand if I don't know
[1:43:17] you you don't know me put up the other
[1:43:19] hand both hands sister says I seen you
[1:43:22] before ma'am I've been in revivals
[1:43:25] before you've been in my revivals before
[1:43:28] but I mean I don't know you no all right
[1:43:31] all right now they have ceased you can
[1:43:33] go home and be
[1:43:36] well right here in this building
[1:43:38] brothers and sisters we witnessed a
[1:43:41] woman do the same thing but it wasn't
[1:43:45] someone saying those words it was in the
[1:43:48] midst of a song service right in the
[1:43:50] middle of of a song service on a regular
[1:43:52] boring Wednesday night when everyone is
[1:43:54] weary and tired while some people were
[1:43:56] still straggling in this sister got the
[1:43:58] desire in her heart to stand up and
[1:44:00] receive her healing for the breast
[1:44:02] cancer that she was battling in the name
[1:44:04] of Jesus Christ what did she do everyone
[1:44:06] else was sitting there worshiping nice
[1:44:08] and calm and quiet but what did she do
[1:44:10] she rose up and said amen be it unto me
[1:44:13] according to thy words and guess what
[1:44:17] happened she was
[1:44:19] healed she didn't have breast cancer
[1:44:24] anymore and if anybody wants her phone
[1:44:26] number I can give it to you and she'll
[1:44:28] tell you right she loves to tell about
[1:44:31] what the Lord has done for her in her
[1:44:33] life when you hear that voice brothers
[1:44:36] and sisters that just says stand up and
[1:44:39] rejoice don't hesitate jump up in the
[1:44:42] name of Jesus Christ he'll grant you
[1:44:44] your
[1:44:46] desires it's the same one am it's not a
[1:44:49] different God amen it's a different
[1:44:52] building it's a different
[1:44:54] year it's a different maybe maybe maybe
[1:44:58] environment in the
[1:44:59] world but it's the same God and it's the
[1:45:03] same word Jesus Christ the same
[1:45:05] yesterday today and forever Satan wants
[1:45:08] us to believe that it's oh it's some old
[1:45:10] Dodie Grandpa he's up in heaven and he
[1:45:12] can't hear you you got to come according
[1:45:14] to the the catechism or whatever it is
[1:45:16] according to the church the Traditions
[1:45:18] you've got to do all these different
[1:45:19] things he doesn't even listen he doesn't
[1:45:21] hear you how many people have prayed and
[1:45:22] you haven't had the prayer answered the
[1:45:24] way that you want God will God will
[1:45:26] answer the prayer but Satan will say no
[1:45:28] he doesn't love you he didn't hear your
[1:45:29] prayer he's not going to answer your
[1:45:31] prayer he's already answered your prayer
[1:45:33] remember Daniel Prayed and it was 21
[1:45:35] days before the the the the angel came
[1:45:39] to him but he said I had to fight
[1:45:40] through Devils to get to you the Prince
[1:45:43] of Persia he didn't want me coming to
[1:45:44] see
[1:45:46] you don't don't don't get disheartened
[1:45:48] don't get discouraged brothers and
[1:45:49] sisters when When you pray pray in the
[1:45:52] spirit get in the spirit brother
[1:45:54] brandham says and then pray don't just
[1:45:56] go on your knees and push the vending
[1:45:58] machine buttons and say I've paid my
[1:46:00] ties now I need this this this this and
[1:46:02] this because it's not going to happen
[1:46:04] the way that you
[1:46:05] think but if you can get in the spirit
[1:46:08] amen and come to him and tell him thank
[1:46:11] you Lord thank you for what you've done
[1:46:13] for me thank you for your goodness thank
[1:46:15] you for your your love and your
[1:46:17] understanding your compassion thank you
[1:46:19] for giving me salvation

[1:46:37] to express himself through you and when
[1:46:40] that happens look out because you're
[1:46:42] going to see results this is not about
[1:46:45] trying to activate God to do something
[1:46:47] for us he doesn't clown for nobody but
[1:46:50] if you want to see results in your life
[1:46:51] if you want to really see the third pull
[1:46:54] come to pass just get in the spirit just
[1:46:58] remain in the spirit and when Satan
[1:47:00] comes around and tries to throw a
[1:47:01] distraction in front of you just rebuke
[1:47:04] him when he comes around and tries to
[1:47:07] remind you about that pain in the past
[1:47:09] that that person did to you or your
[1:47:11] family just rebuke
[1:47:12] them Satan wants to give us any

[1:47:31] be willing to be that strong brothers
[1:47:32] and sisters say I rebuke you in Jesus
[1:47:36] name amen it's the same Jesus it's the
[1:47:41] same

[1:47:54] been in meetings now would you say how
[1:47:57] about somebody up there in the balcony

[1:48:08] was just here at the meeting and there
[1:48:11] she is she touched
[1:48:14] something and what did I said a while

[1:48:26] picture can you pop it up here on the
[1:48:30] screen I meant to actually talk about
[1:48:33] this and sometimes we just get so many
[1:48:35] distractions I
[1:48:39] apologize
[1:48:42] hallu this is what he's talking about
[1:48:44] the pillar of
[1:48:48] fire uh
[1:48:51] no no the pillar of fire over top of
[1:48:54] brother Bram do we have that
[1:48:59] one if not it's
[1:49:02] okay I just thought it would go good
[1:49:04] with this quote but just it's okay
[1:49:07] sometimes the visual is good I would say
[1:49:09] if anybody's interested maybe just look
[1:49:10] it up or I could send it out I'll
[1:49:12] probably just send it out anyway it'll
[1:49:14] be good to see I said a while ago that
[1:49:17] Pillar of Fire don't you see it how many
[1:49:20] has got the picture of it now they got
[1:49:22] it here at the meeting now it looks like
[1:49:25] the pillar of Fire doesn't
[1:49:27] it and now the life of it what does it
[1:49:31] produce the
[1:49:33] same that Pillar of Fire produces the
[1:49:36] same that same life that was actually
[1:49:40] healing people in that meeting that's
[1:49:42] what brother Bram was talking about here
[1:49:44] the life in that Pillar of Fire that
[1:49:47] Pillar of Fire and you know if we had
[1:49:49] the ability to with our own eyes we
[1:49:51] would see that Pillar of Fire here right
[1:49:53] now in this building right now but we're
[1:49:56] not looking for a pillar of fire we're
[1:49:57] looking for the word that's what we've
[1:49:59] been instructed to look for otherwise we
[1:50:02] would have been instructed to look for
[1:50:03] that Pillar of Fire everywhere you go
[1:50:06] examine every room you enter every
[1:50:08] vehicle you go into every place that you
[1:50:11] encounter in this world look for that
[1:50:13] Pillar of Fire but we were
[1:50:14] not brother bradam was given the ability
[1:50:17] to see it right we know that Saul of
[1:50:21] Tarsus he was given the ability to see
[1:50:23] it and even the people that were around
[1:50:26] him they never saw
[1:50:27] it Supernatural light that Pillar of
[1:50:30] Fire Brothers you don't have to worry
[1:50:32] about it it's it's not a big
[1:50:35] deal but it looks like you've already
[1:50:37] got it anyway so I'll just linger here
[1:50:39] and we'll we'll bring it up you know I I
[1:50:42] thought for the longest time this just
[1:50:43] looked like a Halo and maybe it some
[1:50:46] people would call it that but you know
[1:50:48] the prophet for our day for our age he
[1:50:50] called it the pillar of fire and we know
[1:50:52] that it was a pillar of fire that got
[1:50:54] right between the children of Israel
[1:50:56] when they had left Egypt and it was a
[1:50:59] pillar of Fire by night and it was a
[1:51:00] cloud by day and we've been given the
[1:51:02] ability I don't know if it came up
[1:51:04] earlier um but he brought up the picture
[1:51:06] of the cloud we've been given a cloud
[1:51:10] and we've been given a pillar of fire
[1:51:11] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:51:13] forever but that Pillar of Fire the only
[1:51:16] supernatural being that was ever
[1:51:18] recorded by the camera l
[1:51:20] amen verified by Mr Lacy in the United
[1:51:23] States and even today in 2023 it hangs
[1:51:27] in Washington Hall of Fame of
[1:51:29] Supernatural photos I think that's what
[1:51:31] it's called brother bam says what did it
[1:51:34] produce the same you can just leave it
[1:51:36] up there Brothers don't take it down
[1:51:38] what did it produce the same he says not
[1:51:40] me now it it what what does it produce
[1:51:44] the same works that it did when it was
[1:51:47] in the son of God now it's in adopted
[1:51:51] Sons and Daughters of God Hallelujah by
[1:51:54] the grace of the true Son of
[1:51:56] God what I'm trying to bring this
[1:51:58] morning brothers and sisters is even
[1:52:00] though we look at that picture and think
[1:52:02] that's wonderful it's magnificent that
[1:52:05] that there was that Supernatural event
[1:52:07] think about this what about your
[1:52:09] Supernatural event what about that
[1:52:11] Pillar of Fire in your
[1:52:14] life amen it's for a purpose and the
[1:52:17] purpose of it is it's doing something
[1:52:20] for us yes and and I'm going to get into
[1:52:22] the quote a little bit but I'm just
[1:52:23] going to get ahead of myself just
[1:52:24] because I feel it coming on what does it
[1:52:26] do it burns out all the sin in our lives
[1:52:30] it burns out all of our old nasty nature
[1:52:33] all of the old man it burns it out that
[1:52:36] Pillar of Fire is the life of Jesus
[1:52:38] Christ it's the way that he's chosen to
[1:52:41] portray himself to this
[1:52:43] world otherwise that picture would never
[1:52:45] have been taken and recorded it would
[1:52:48] never have been something that we can
[1:52:49] look at at now we don't look at that
[1:52:51] picture and say oh yeah that's who we
[1:52:53] worship that's you know what no way
[1:52:56] that's not at all what it is I remember
[1:52:58] the first time that I came into the
[1:52:59] upper room building I saw that picture
[1:53:00] on the wall there that picture and I
[1:53:03] said ah there it is they're worshiping a
[1:53:05] man I know it I knew it until I sat down
[1:53:10] and started to listen to the word that
[1:53:12] was being spoken the quotes that were
[1:53:14] being quoted this life of Jesus Christ
[1:53:17] that was being expressed by this man
[1:53:19] right here he was saying don't look at
[1:53:21] me look at him I've got to decrease so
[1:53:25] that he can
[1:53:27] increase yes so we know it very clearly
[1:53:30] that if we see someone that's esteeming
[1:53:32] this man to be equal with Christ there's
[1:53:34] something
[1:53:36] wrong if there's any other man that's
[1:53:39] esteemed to be equal with Christ there's
[1:53:41] something wrong because this man was
[1:53:44] sent to introduce Christ that's why he
[1:53:46] has that Supernatural photo it's good
[1:53:48] brother you can take it down but you got
[1:53:51] to see it if anybody has any questions
[1:53:53] I'm sure you could find it online very
[1:53:55] easy I'm happy to share it with you too
[1:53:57] it's so important for us to recognize
[1:53:59] even though we can look back and say
[1:54:01] that was fantastic it's such a beautiful
[1:54:04] picture to see God expressing himself
[1:54:06] with the man on Earth we've got that
[1:54:07] documented Supernatural photo what about
[1:54:10] your Supernatural brothers and sisters
[1:54:12] don't look for signs and wonders that's
[1:54:14] all going to follow it will follow there
[1:54:17] will be Vindication it will follow you
[1:54:19] all the days of your
[1:54:21] life because we have that Blessed
[1:54:23] assurance that if we put him first seek
[1:54:27] ye first the kingdom of God Amen then
[1:54:30] all of the other things they'll just
[1:54:32] follow the supernatural will follow
[1:54:34] you'll speak the word and it will come
[1:54:36] to pass because you won't speak a word
[1:54:38] that's going to be vain you won't speak
[1:54:40] a word that's according to the lust of
[1:54:42] your flesh right James said it very
[1:54:45] clearly many times we ask but we ask a
[1:54:47] Miss because we ask upon the lust of of
[1:54:49] our flesh our fleshly desires I want
[1:54:52] more money I want a bigger house I want
[1:54:54] a nicer car maybe I want a bigger church
[1:54:56] maybe I want better clothes maybe I want
[1:54:58] a better job maybe I want a better
[1:54:59] degree maybe maybe maybe I want I want I
[1:55:02] want what about the word of God put the
[1:55:05] word of God first brothers and sisters
[1:55:07] children when you're going to school put
[1:55:09] the word of God first and see if he
[1:55:10] won't bless you in your studies brothers
[1:55:13] and sisters put the word of God first in
[1:55:15] your homes and see if he won't bless
[1:55:17] your marriages see if he won't take that
[1:55:19] Pillar of Fire and burn out all of that
[1:55:21] nasty old Badger nature in our
[1:55:24] lives and allow us to submit ourselves
[1:55:28] one to another in the fear of God and
[1:55:31] then say oh yeah I'm the husband or oh
[1:55:35] yeah I'm the wife many times we want to
[1:55:37] be the husband I'm the husband or or I'm
[1:55:39] the wife I've got my position but not
[1:55:42] willing to submit ourselves one to
[1:55:44] another in the fear of God because
[1:55:47] brothers and sisters if we've got the
[1:55:48] Holy Ghost in our lives if my wife has
[1:55:51] the holy ghost in her life and I treat
[1:55:52] her nasty who am I treating
[1:55:56] nasty sometimes it can even be in a joke
[1:56:01] form we know that many a justest many a
[1:56:05] truth sory is spoken in justest right we
[1:56:07] can really hurt people's feelings by
[1:56:11] joking in our family we don't subscribe
[1:56:13] to
[1:56:15] that it's not
[1:56:17] good joking is fine it's fine to make
[1:56:20] jokes but not at other people's expense
[1:56:23] I would say this I don't believe that's
[1:56:24] the Holy
[1:56:25] Spirit am the holy spirit is going to
[1:56:29] edify the holy spirit is going to
[1:56:32] encourag I don't know why we went
[1:56:35] there sorry about the puff
[1:56:38] again 1961 Jesus Christ the same
[1:56:41] yesterday today and forever brother Bram
[1:56:43] says somebody in the audience something
[1:56:45] happened in the audience I have to just
[1:56:48] follow it I I See the Light it's a
[1:56:52] vision it just moves out there's no
[1:56:54] doubt in my mind brothers and sisters
[1:56:55] I'm sure you could visualize it too that
[1:56:57] while this prophet of God was preaching
[1:56:58] he would see that Pillar of Fire just go
[1:57:00] out over the audience and we know that
[1:57:02] he even said so but could you just
[1:57:03] visualize it could you imagine it that
[1:57:05] Pillar of Fire seeing it he says I do
[1:57:07] not know you as I have said and Jesus
[1:57:10] met a woman in a little panoramic like
[1:57:14] this and he spoke to her a few minutes
[1:57:16] to her to find the secret of her heart
[1:57:19] and he told her what her trouble was and
[1:57:23] she said quickly sir I perceive that
[1:57:25] you're a prophet we know that when
[1:57:28] Messiah cometh he'll tell us these
[1:57:31] things Jesus said I am he that
[1:57:34] speaks I'm just going to pause there I
[1:57:37] want to say this brothers and sisters
[1:57:38] when you hear when you
[1:57:41] hear the words speaking directly to your
[1:57:44] heart directly to your thoughts directly
[1:57:47] to your conversation directly to maybe
[1:57:50] whatever it is and you can see that God
[1:57:53] is moving it is truly God it's the same
[1:57:57] God that he's talking about here it's
[1:57:59] the same one that went and sat down by
[1:58:01] the the well and waited for that
[1:58:03] ill-famed woman it's the very same God
[1:58:05] that very same Pillar of Fire that we
[1:58:07] saw in the picture the very same one
[1:58:09] that went out over this audience is the
[1:58:11] very same one that wants to speak to our
[1:58:14] needs we have the ability to be
[1:58:17] delivered from our situations amen he
[1:58:20] says and she ran into the City and and
[1:58:22] said come see a man who's told me what's
[1:58:25] wrong what the things that she did said
[1:58:28] isn't that the very
[1:58:30] Messiah I just want to say it brothers
[1:58:32] and sisters it's not about any Minister
[1:58:35] it's not about any Ministry it's about
[1:58:36] Jesus
[1:58:38] Christ yes it is because we know that
[1:58:40] he'll speak through a mule he'll speak
[1:58:42] through a donkey it's not about a great
[1:58:45] one the only one that's great is
[1:58:48] Christ and he will use any Minister
[1:58:50] anywhere if we have a genuine desire in
[1:58:53] our heart because really what is the
[1:58:55] beauty of the church it's not the pastor
[1:58:57] no clearly it's not the pastor the
[1:59:00] beauty of the church is the character of
[1:59:02] the people and if you've got a beautiful
[1:59:04] church you've got the character of Jesus
[1:59:06] Christ Living out through the
[1:59:11] people he says now lady this afternoon
[1:59:16] me not knowing you you not knowing me or
[1:59:20] then if the Holy Spirit Remains the Same
[1:59:22] that was in Jesus is in us because God
[1:59:25] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:59:27] himself see he was a Son of God and
[1:59:29] we're adopted Sons and Daughters of God
[1:59:32] and if he will tell me something that
[1:59:34] you have done something that you have
[1:59:36] planned on doing something that you're
[1:59:38] here for a sickness or somebody you want
[1:59:40] to be prayed for or something would it
[1:59:43] make you believe and have faith amen yes
[1:59:47] would the rest of the audience believe
[1:59:51] you know the woman anybody all
[1:59:53] right I just think it's amazing now
[1:59:56] there's no climax to
[1:59:58] that I'm going to bring the climax
[2:00:01] because I want to say this and I know it
[2:00:03] for sure because I've experienced it
[2:00:05] when you have the minister ministering
[2:00:06] when you have someone preaching and
[2:00:08] suddenly he starts to touch on things
[2:00:11] that you've been talking about stuff
[2:00:12] that you've been dealing with
[2:00:14] conversations that you've had in private
[2:00:16] that is the same God talking to you
[2:00:22] amen we don't need him to come and do
[2:00:25] great signs and wonders have a healing
[2:00:28] campaign what more do we need than to
[2:00:31] have the Lord Jesus come and speak to
[2:00:33] you directly about your
[2:00:35] situation my we know that for brother
[2:00:38] bradam to say it that hey you know what
[2:00:41] would it do to you if if I could tell
[2:00:43] you something that the Lord has told me
[2:00:45] about you but brothers and sisters what
[2:00:47] does it do for you when God speaks to
[2:00:49] you individually
[2:00:52] amen Psalms
[2:00:54] 138 verse 2 says I will worship toward
[2:00:57] thy Holy Temple and praise thy name for
[2:01:01] thy loving kindness and for thy Truth
[2:01:04] for thou has has magnified Thy word
[2:01:07] above all thy
[2:01:10] name and if he has magnified his word
[2:01:14] above his name what do we do brothers
[2:01:17] and sisters we were having a
[2:01:19] conversation about this the other night
[2:01:20] I thought it was so beautiful and I I
[2:01:22] even so much has said it I've got to hit
[2:01:24] on this because it's so important
[2:01:26] brothers and sisters what do we do
[2:01:29] that's what David said that he does and
[2:01:31] we know that Christ was speaking through
[2:01:34] David but that's what he did what do we
[2:01:36] do what do we do are we willing to
[2:01:39] subdue our flesh for his word or or do
[2:01:41] we say no no no no no no no I I I I just
[2:01:44] can't in this circumstance in this
[2:01:45] situation I've got my thing and I've Got
[2:01:47] My Flesh and I'm stuck in this body now
[2:01:49] I just have to let myself fly a little
[2:01:51] bit and then I'll come back and make it
[2:01:53] all better again or do we say no enough
[2:01:57] I'm going to stop this I'm going to
[2:01:59] allow his word to be esteemed greater in
[2:02:01] my life than the desires of My Flesh
[2:02:05] than the way I've lived my entire life
[2:02:07] are we subduing our flesh brothers and
[2:02:08] sisters are we willing to esteem his
[2:02:10] word greater than my opinion greater
[2:02:13] than my opinion oh my I know we all have
[2:02:18] opinions and some of them are very
[2:02:20] strong
[2:02:21] opinions but does that opinion line up
[2:02:23] with the word of God cuz if it doesn't
[2:02:26] he's saying Let It Go amen right line up
[2:02:30] with his word we know that when brother
[2:02:32] brownon went across the the the the the
[2:02:35] curtain of time went beyond the curtain
[2:02:36] of time what did he hear he heard them
[2:02:38] saying keep pressing on and he at the
[2:02:40] end of it in in beyond the curtain of
[2:02:42] time message he said I'm more convinced
[2:02:44] than ever that I want to stay straight
[2:02:46] on that word and he says stay straight
[2:02:49] on that word am uphold his word brothers
[2:02:52] and sisters greater than any of our
[2:02:56] circumstances and I want to say it this
[2:02:58] way I I don't want to but I I felt led
[2:03:01] to if we don't uphold his word greater
[2:03:04] than our circumstances then what spirit
[2:03:06] is influencing us what Spirit are we
[2:03:09] under is it a spirit of fear is it a
[2:03:11] spirit of Doubt yeah there's so many
[2:03:14] different Spirits in this world that
[2:03:15] we're contending with and be be sure
[2:03:17] that the the all The Guns of hell are
[2:03:19] trained on the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:03:21] we're going to have an onslaught a Siege
[2:03:24] if it were
[2:03:26] possible but it's not possible for the
[2:03:28] Bride of Jesus Christ but what Spirit do
[2:03:31] we have in our lives what what spiritual
[2:03:33] influence are we under is it the Holy
[2:03:36] Spirit the same Pillar of Fire that we
[2:03:37] saw in that picture it has to be yes
[2:03:42] because that spirit that spirit that
[2:03:44] Pillar of Fire will burn out all of the
[2:03:46] sin in the old
[2:03:47] man I don't even know if we're going to
[2:03:49] have time to get into the quotes are we
[2:03:51] okay for a few minutes it on we have to
[2:03:54] become a new creature in Christ
[2:03:56] Jesus or do we have a desire just to do
[2:03:59] our
[2:04:00] will you know one of the things that can
[2:04:02] actually manifest in our lives is we
[2:04:04] just become critical of
[2:04:06] everything we can become that way we can
[2:04:09] become judgmental of everyone
[2:04:12] amen but think about how Christ was I
[2:04:16] just want to underscore this one and
[2:04:18] highlight this one how is Christ he he
[2:04:20] ran with the Sinners and the
[2:04:23] publicans his disciples ate with
[2:04:25] unwashed hands they were not the
[2:04:27] mainstream Christian people that that
[2:04:30] most of the world thought that maybe he
[2:04:31] should be with and who was it that that
[2:04:34] got him upset was it the woman that was
[2:04:36] thrown at him that was caught in the act
[2:04:39] of
[2:04:41] adultery he said to her woman where are
[2:04:43] thy accusers because I've already dealt
[2:04:45] with them whoever's got no sin in your
[2:04:47] life go ahead throw the first Stone
[2:04:49] right and they all recognized whoa wait
[2:04:51] a second we're righteous people we can't
[2:04:53] do that so they dropped their stones and
[2:04:55] left he said woman where's your
[2:04:57] accusers just go and sin no more that's
[2:04:59] what he told her didn't judge her didn't
[2:05:02] try to put her out didn't didn't do all
[2:05:04] the nasty things that that the badger
[2:05:06] skinn humans try and do
[2:05:09] sometimes but the Christ that was there
[2:05:11] in that flesh is the Christ that's here
[2:05:13] today in our flesh brothers and sisters
[2:05:16] yes and he doesn't judge everyone on
[2:05:19] Amen Let the word judge let the word do
[2:05:22] the Sorting let the word be the judge
[2:05:26] amen but the only people that he got mad
[2:05:29] at was the most Pious people the most
[2:05:32] religious ones the
[2:05:35] most I could go on and on you know what
[2:05:37] I mean yes it was the most religious
[2:05:40] people of the day those are the ones
[2:05:41] that he got mad at those are the ones
[2:05:43] that he actually told them who they were
[2:05:46] and boy they didn't like it but you know
[2:05:48] why
[2:05:49] because he didn't have the spirit of
[2:05:50] love and
[2:05:53] compassion and it was that that time
[2:05:56] that era that age where he said how will
[2:05:58] the world know that you love
[2:06:01] me you have love one for another you're
[2:06:03] willing to forgive
[2:06:08] right we've got to have Grace in our
[2:06:13] lives so I just couldn't help but think
[2:06:15] you know as we're as we're getting ready
[2:06:17] to cross over
[2:06:19] because one way or the other we're going
[2:06:20] to cross
[2:06:22] over we're either going to go by the way
[2:06:24] of the Grave or we're going to go by the
[2:06:26] way of the sky it's inevitable what
[2:06:30] character do we have in our lives
[2:06:32] today whose life are we
[2:06:35] representing is it truly the Holy Ghost
[2:06:38] in our lives or is it just the Holy
[2:06:41] Ghost
[2:06:42] sometimes and us the rest of the
[2:06:45] time when we're truly surrendered to the
[2:06:48] Holy Ghost in our lives to Jesus Christ
[2:06:50] himself the message of the hour then
[2:06:53] we're going to live that life we're
[2:06:55] going to demonstrate that life people
[2:06:57] are going to say what is it about you
[2:07:00] there's something different about you
[2:07:02] and I'm not talking about people in the
[2:07:03] grocery store I'm going to say your
[2:07:05] husband I'm going to say your wife
[2:07:08] Hallelujah your
[2:07:09] children your family members the ones
[2:07:12] that know you the most the closest
[2:07:14] they're going to see a change in your
[2:07:15] life Hallelujah you're not going to be
[2:07:17] the same person you're going to be a new
[2:07:19] creature in Christ Jesus cuz remember
[2:07:22] brothers and sisters who we are right
[2:07:24] now here today if we were to die leaving
[2:07:28] this building that's exactly who we
[2:07:30] would be right over there we'll step
[2:07:33] from one dimension to the next we're not
[2:07:35] going to become different people because
[2:07:37] we died now suddenly the message of the
[2:07:38] hour is going to take and transform my
[2:07:40] character and I'm going to be this great
[2:07:41] glorious
[2:07:43] person if you were all critical down
[2:07:45] there you're going to be all critical
[2:07:47] over there right
[2:07:49] if you're a secret sinner here you're
[2:07:51] going to be a secret sinner there amen
[2:07:54] but if you're dying to yourself every
[2:07:55] single day he's going to say come home
[2:07:58] my child well done thou good and
[2:08:01] faithful servant because you have done
[2:08:04] all that you need to do now enter ye
[2:08:06] into the joys of the
[2:08:08] Lord welcome death doesn't change our
[2:08:11] nature brothers and sisters it only
[2:08:13] changes our dwelling place it's only
[2:08:15] going to change our our address our our
[2:08:17] postal code that's the only thing that's
[2:08:19] going to happen we need to make sure
[2:08:20] that we know whose Spirit we are under
[2:08:22] the influence of whose spirit is
[2:08:24] actually living out through
[2:08:26] US brother bradam he he talks about this
[2:08:29] is where I really wanted to get to today
[2:08:31] at a f future home of the Heavenly
[2:08:32] bridegroom and the Earthly bride
[2:08:34] paragraph 237 he says if you've got
[2:08:36] eternal life there is only one form
[2:08:38] that's God and you are an expressed
[2:08:41] attribute see I know we read this last
[2:08:43] week but I just want to underscore it
[2:08:44] and highlight it I want to remind us
[2:08:46] stir up our Pure Minds by way of
[2:08:47] remembrance if you've got eternal life
[2:08:49] you always were yes you didn't just get
[2:08:52] it one day no you were always Eternal
[2:08:56] amen if you've got eternal life there's
[2:08:58] only one form and that's God and you are
[2:09:00] an expressed attribute and I'm going to
[2:09:02] put my words in there you're an
[2:09:03] expressed attribute of
[2:09:06] God every single age had an expression
[2:09:09] of his attributes we can look back at
[2:09:11] every single age and say yeah that was a
[2:09:13] man of God that was a man of God all
[2:09:15] those men of God but what about today
[2:09:18] where's the man of God
[2:09:20] today it's those ones that recognize
[2:09:22] they've got eternal life he says see if
[2:09:26] you you're not you're not going to be
[2:09:28] there
[2:09:30] anyhow I think it's pretty strong but
[2:09:32] it's true he said it if you're not an
[2:09:35] attribute of God you're not going to be
[2:09:36] there amen it's not going to happen no
[2:09:41] if you're not you're not going to be
[2:09:42] there anyhow no man can come except my
[2:09:44] father has drawn him
[2:09:47] see which pass passes away all these old
[2:09:50] things but these things don't so it
[2:09:53] speaks of
[2:09:54] Eternity the Holy Ghost is eternal then
[2:09:57] you are in eternity where you was all
[2:10:01] the time amen but you've just recognized
[2:10:03] what's happened
[2:10:05] Hallelujah there has to be a recognition
[2:10:08] of what's happened brothers and
[2:10:11] sisters not that you became Eternal not
[2:10:14] that you just got eternal life that you
[2:10:17] recognize you are always had eternal
[2:10:19] life so if you've always had eternal
[2:10:21] life who can steal it from you
[2:10:23] Hallelujah this is the other side of it
[2:10:26] now I I've been maybe a little bit hard
[2:10:28] in the beginning of the service but now
[2:10:29] I want to say brothers and sisters you
[2:10:31] can't be lost if you have eternal life
[2:10:35] you cannot be lost if you have eternal
[2:10:37] life Satan can't come and take it away
[2:10:40] from you because he never gave it to
[2:10:43] you he can't have a part of God he can't
[2:10:45] touch
[2:10:47] you then you are in eternity where you
[2:10:50] was all the time but you've just
[2:10:52] recognized what happened he says see you
[2:10:55] were made for an eternal
[2:10:57] purpose because you was the
[2:11:00] manifestation of an attribute that was
[2:11:03] in God that thought of you and expressed
[2:11:06] you thank you Lord it's no accident that
[2:11:08] you have the grandparents you have it's
[2:11:11] no accident that you've got the great
[2:11:13] grandparents that you have it's no
[2:11:15] accident that you live where you live
[2:11:17] it's no accident that you are where you
[2:11:19] are you're an expressed attribute of
[2:11:23] [Music]
[2:11:26] God he says and he made made an earth to
[2:11:30] take you out of and to make you a human
[2:11:34] being and this is just so beautiful I
[2:11:37] just hope this brings us rest today
[2:11:38] brothers and sisters it did for me when
[2:11:40] I was studying it he says and sin come
[2:11:42] along and perverted his way but you come
[2:11:45] anyhow amen but you was lost with the
[2:11:49] world so he come and redeemed you thank
[2:11:52] you Lord the expressed
[2:11:54] attribute and just for the
[2:11:57] record this is going to be my words the
[2:12:00] expressed attribute is not this flesh no
[2:12:03] it's not this body that we live in it's
[2:12:04] not this pest house brother brandham
[2:12:06] called it many times I live my life
[2:12:09] thinking that one of these days I'm just
[2:12:10] going to pray enough and I'm going to
[2:12:12] read enough and I'm going to listen
[2:12:13] enough and this past house will stop
[2:12:15] being a past house this past house is
[2:12:17] going to be a past house until we lay it
[2:12:21] down but what's your
[2:12:23] desire what's our desire today amen is
[2:12:26] it to make it right with the Lord is it
[2:12:29] to allow his Spirit to live out through
[2:12:31] us he says but you was lost with the
[2:12:33] world so he come and redeemed you the
[2:12:35] expressed attribute and also redeems
[2:12:38] this Earth by the same
[2:12:41] way did you ever think about it in in
[2:12:44] the Garden of Gethsemane I never did I
[2:12:46] always thought that the blood that that
[2:12:48] came the very first drop of blood that
[2:12:50] was redeeming blood was for me in my sin
[2:12:54] and maybe it was but just reading this
[2:12:57] studying this it made me think maybe
[2:12:59] that drop of blood that fell like sweat
[2:13:01] from jesus' brow when he was praying
[2:13:03] when the disciples abandoned him and
[2:13:05] were sleeping they couldn't stay awake
[2:13:07] long enough to pray that blood that
[2:13:10] dropped could potentially have been
[2:13:12] there redeeming this Earth changing the
[2:13:16] world shaking the the foundations of
[2:13:19] hell and of death and of the Grave those
[2:13:22] first drops I've always just maybe it's
[2:13:24] just me being a little crazy but I just
[2:13:26] thought that it was it was it was it was
[2:13:28] the blood was always just there to
[2:13:30] redeem the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[2:13:32] that's all but brother bradam says very
[2:13:34] clearly that God says through the
[2:13:35] prophet that this was to redeem the
[2:13:37] Earth also this was Redeeming the Earth
[2:13:39] by the same way he says then his purpose
[2:13:42] rolls on see oh hallelujah oh that does
[2:13:44] me so much good just to think what lays
[2:13:47] ahead if you listen to this message like
[2:13:49] I recommended 1964 802 brothers and
[2:13:52] sisters he really explains what we're
[2:13:55] heading for how we're going to a place
[2:13:57] where there's going to be no storms
[2:13:59] there's going to be no death there's
[2:14:01] going to be no germs there's going to be
[2:14:03] no fear or anger or frustrations he goes
[2:14:06] through and lists and labels all of it
[2:14:08] there's going to be no little Mounds he
[2:14:10] talks about where we have Graves of
[2:14:13] people that have died amen there's going
[2:14:15] to be no death there it's just going to
[2:14:17] be
[2:14:20] life paragraph
[2:14:22] 239 getting into our scripture now today
[2:14:25] right at the end of the service he says
[2:14:27] now in Ephesians 1:10 it's called now if
[2:14:29] you're putting it down Ephesians 1:10
[2:14:31] it's called not a dispensation not the
[2:14:34] seventh day it's called the fullness of
[2:14:38] time and brother bam talks about it he
[2:14:40] calls it the end of the week or the
[2:14:41] eighth day but he says there can't be an
[2:14:43] eighth day Eighth Day is eternity there
[2:14:46] can only be seven days in a week and
[2:14:48] when you hit the seventh day you go back
[2:14:50] to the first day and that's what happens
[2:14:52] but to the Bride of Jesus Christ to the
[2:14:54] truly elected she goes on to the eighth
[2:14:56] day she goes into eternity that's what
[2:14:59] happens to us and that's what he's
[2:15:00] saying here he says it's called the
[2:15:01] fullness of time and when the fullness
[2:15:03] of time has come that's when time has
[2:15:06] been
[2:15:07] fulfilled and I just think it's
[2:15:09] important for us to remember brothers
[2:15:11] and sisters the fullness of time has
[2:15:12] come God sent a prophet to call a bride
[2:15:15] of his own choosing and that bride has
[2:15:17] been called of his own choosing he took
[2:15:19] the prophet off the scene and now here
[2:15:21] she is here she stands waiting at the
[2:15:23] altar for him waiting to go away and you
[2:15:27] know what's going to happen one of these
[2:15:28] moments he says when there's no more
[2:15:30] time than you go into eternity after the
[2:15:32] seventh Church age is over and it is
[2:15:36] Luther's age is over Methodist age is
[2:15:38] over Pentecostal age is over and now you
[2:15:41] go into what eternity no more sevens no
[2:15:44] more threes no more other they're in
[2:15:46] eternity where where there is no such
[2:15:48] time as numbers and times and things
[2:15:51] amen oh my you see it now maybe it
[2:15:54] sounds a little bit confusing brothers
[2:15:55] and sisters but he gets into it here
[2:15:57] what he's talking about is that you're
[2:15:59] already seated in Heavenly places you're
[2:16:01] already in eternity the blending of the
[2:16:04] ages is happening as you recognize where
[2:16:07] you are when you have his
[2:16:09] Spirit he says or after time has been
[2:16:12] fulfilled all sin is gone taken away at
[2:16:14] the Millennium at the great white Throne
[2:16:16] judgment a type by by the Holy Ghost
[2:16:18] after the world is on fire and baptized
[2:16:20] it's baptism of holy fire from heaven
[2:16:23] all sin is gone all germs is gone all
[2:16:26] Devils is gone all Temptations is gone
[2:16:29] all evil is gone type now then what does
[2:16:32] God do he can sit upon the Earth see
[2:16:34] because all sin is gone that's the same
[2:16:37] thing he does when he gives you the Holy
[2:16:39] Ghost baptism with
[2:16:41] [Music]
[2:16:42] fire he can come and dwell with you and
[2:16:46] we can sit in Heavenly places in Christ
[2:16:51] Jesus but how does that work because I'm
[2:16:54] sure that everyone would be saying
[2:16:55] brother Barry my my butt's getting a
[2:16:57] little sore here I'm seated right here
[2:17:00] in this church just be glad we don't
[2:17:02] have wooden
[2:17:03] pews
[2:17:05] right but here we find ourselves stuck
[2:17:08] in this in this place in this pest house
[2:17:10] in this building yes but if you believe
[2:17:13] this word brothers and sisters the word
[2:17:15] says you're already seated in Heavenly
[2:17:16] places amen in Christ Jesus amen and
[2:17:20] that's what he's saying here today
[2:17:22] that's the same thing he does when he
[2:17:23] gives you the Holy Ghost baptism with
[2:17:24] fire he can come and dwell with you and
[2:17:27] we can sit in Heavenly places in Christ
[2:17:28] Jesus because we are already in him not
[2:17:31] we will be we are now sitting in Christ
[2:17:34] Jesus how do we get into it by one Holy
[2:17:38] Ghost
[2:17:39] baptism brothers and sisters there's no
[2:17:41] other way no other truth and no other
[2:17:43] life we can't say that I believe the
[2:17:45] message of the hour therefore I get the
[2:17:47] Holy Ghost no you have to
[2:17:50] repent you have to repent for the
[2:17:52] remission of your sins then you have to
[2:17:54] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:17:56] Jesus Christ for the remission of those
[2:17:58] sins and then you shall receive the gift
[2:18:01] of the Holy Ghost and so long as you're
[2:18:03] willing to come the way the word lays
[2:18:05] out you will get this Holy Ghost then
[2:18:08] you're seated in Heavenly places in
[2:18:10] Christ Jesus brother bradam says how do
[2:18:12] we get into it by one Holy Ghost baptism
[2:18:15] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[2:18:17] Christ which we are now won't be in
[2:18:21] Christ we
[2:18:23] are he is the great spiritual King over
[2:18:25] the spirit that's in us because we were
[2:18:28] in him at the beginning amen my I'll
[2:18:31] call the musicians I have one more quote
[2:18:34] that I want to
[2:18:36] read I could say so much brothers and
[2:18:39] sisters I just want to encourage us to
[2:18:41] get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives amen
[2:18:43] when we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[2:18:45] it's not some intangible being being
[2:18:47] some other spiritual manifestation it's
[2:18:50] Jesus Christ himself the literal Life of
[2:18:53] Christ will begin to live out through Us
[2:18:55] and how will we know the old man will
[2:18:58] die we'll have a new nature we will
[2:19:02] actually Express his attributes to us
[2:19:06] why will that happen because you are an
[2:19:09] attribute of Christ maybe stand with me
[2:19:11] this
[2:19:14] morning as we
[2:19:16] close brother brandom says the fullness
[2:19:18] of time has come after time has been
[2:19:22] fulfilled it's out of the same message
[2:19:26] future home says sin is gone after the
[2:19:30] world's
[2:19:31] baptism after the world's baptism makes
[2:19:35] it a fit place yes no sickness no germs
[2:19:40] no Thorns no thistles no death no sorrow
[2:19:45] no heartaches no old age nothing to
[2:19:47] right represent death nothing wrong all
[2:19:50] right nothing natural
[2:19:54] Eternal then his attribute is expressed
[2:19:58] because it was there first to begin
[2:20:01] with that's what he
[2:20:04] thought and brother Bram he he
[2:20:06] illustrates it on the
[2:20:08] Blackboard I just want to say it this
[2:20:10] morning brothers and sisters one of
[2:20:11] these days this world is going to be
[2:20:14] burned over by fire and I'm not saying
[2:20:16] that to
[2:20:17] make us afraid I'm saying that to
[2:20:20] encourage us because somewhere else in
[2:20:23] the message of the hour brother Bram
[2:20:24] says before one of those bombs goes off
[2:20:26] the bride goes home in the moment in the
[2:20:29] twinkling of an eye amen but don't look
[2:20:31] for an Earthly manifestation I think
[2:20:33] this should happen before that can take
[2:20:34] place because if you do that you're
[2:20:35] going to get it wrong just work on
[2:20:38] getting the holy ghost in your life and
[2:20:39] if you've got the holy ghost in your
[2:20:41] life just keep feeding him don't starve
[2:20:43] him feed him keep feeding him we can get
