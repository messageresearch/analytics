[57:42] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[57:45] gave unto him
[57:47] to show unto his servants things which
[57:49] must shortly come to pass
[57:52] and he sent and signified it by his
[57:54] Angel unto his servant John
[57:57] who bear record of the word of God and
[57:59] the testimony of Jesus Christ
[58:01] and of all things that he saw
[58:04] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[58:07] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[58:09] those things which are written therein
[58:12] for the time is at hand
[58:15] John to the seven churches which are in
[58:18] Asia Grace be unto you and peace
[58:21] from him which is
[58:23] and which was and which is to come
[58:27] and from the seven spirits which are
[58:29] before his throne
[58:31] and from Jesus Christ who was the
[58:33] faithful witness and the first begotten
[58:35] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[58:37] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[58:40] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[58:43] and hath made us Kings and Priests unto
[58:46] God and his father
[58:49] to him be glory and Dominion forever and
[58:52] ever amen let's just bow in prayer one
[58:55] more time
[58:56] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[58:58] word
[58:59] we know that it is the same yesterday
[59:01] today and forever
[59:04] father we're so thankful that we can
[59:05] have the Revelation today in our hearts
[59:08] that the Lord just as powerful as it was
[59:10] that day that you stood before the tomb
[59:13] of Lazarus and you you wept as a man but
[59:17] you squared up your shoulders as God and
[59:19] you spoke the word and you said Lazarus
[59:22] come forth father we know that it's the
[59:25] same word today and father that same
[59:28] word will be there tomorrow as well
[59:30] father even if there isn't a tomorrow in
[59:32] time that word will be there father and
[59:35] Lord It's my prayer this morning that
[59:37] that word that very same word would be
[59:40] in every single individual that hears
[59:43] this message this morning Father Lord
[59:45] Jesus that even if there isn't a
[59:47] tomorrow in time oh father that each one
[59:49] of us would be as Eternal as that word
[59:52] is
[59:52] father be it unto us according to Thy
[59:55] word is our prayer we just ask all these
[59:58] things now in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:00:00] pray amen amen God bless you this
[1:00:03] morning you may be seated
[1:00:06] for a few minutes I'll try not to keep
[1:00:08] us too long today
[1:00:10] you happy this morning
[1:00:14] you know if I could be anything
[1:00:17] I do believe that's exactly right just
[1:00:19] let me be an offering
[1:00:22] let me be a sacrifice unto the Lord
[1:00:26] let me not be a hindrance to the body
[1:00:29] let me not be a false witness of this
[1:00:31] word oh my
[1:00:34] you know sometimes we live in our lives
[1:00:37] and and our lives some people would say
[1:00:40] can bear false witness but you know what
[1:00:42] we're all humans we're all learning and
[1:00:46] growing and we're living our lives and
[1:00:49] God is working with each and every one
[1:00:51] of us we're all on a journey and I just
[1:00:53] love what uh brother Tom Ernest said
[1:00:56] once upon a time it just made perfect
[1:00:58] sense to me we are in a one-room
[1:01:01] schoolhouse
[1:01:02] there's people that are preschoolers and
[1:01:05] there's people that are University PHD
[1:01:08] graduates people who are super smart and
[1:01:11] and people who maybe just aren't as
[1:01:13] educated and I wouldn't say that someone
[1:01:15] isn't smart
[1:01:16] I would say the word will actually do
[1:01:18] the dividing there and we'll get into
[1:01:20] that a little bit later we're having a
[1:01:21] conversation in in in our truck on the
[1:01:24] way to church today I do apologize I'm
[1:01:26] going to fiddle with this it's poking me
[1:01:27] again I think I need a new one
[1:01:30] it's just like a needle going in my skin
[1:01:34] so forgive me if I get a little fidgety
[1:01:37] we're having a conversation today about
[1:01:39] being educated and you know what nobody
[1:01:43] is not smart I would say that
[1:01:46] some people just aren't as educated as
[1:01:48] other people
[1:01:49] now there's some people that would say
[1:01:51] well you have an IQ test and brother
[1:01:53] bear you can say some people are very
[1:01:54] intelligent and some people aren't
[1:01:55] intelligent well how do people get
[1:01:57] intelligent they usually get trained
[1:01:59] don't they they usually get taught it's
[1:02:01] not something that you just actually in
[1:02:03] kindergarten you understand all the
[1:02:05] things that you would when you're in
[1:02:06] grade 12 it's not the way it works
[1:02:08] but I caught myself speaking to
[1:02:10] Christopher on the way in today
[1:02:12] you know maybe you're not as smart when
[1:02:14] you're young and I I just felt so
[1:02:17] checked and corrected to say no that's
[1:02:19] not true that's not a true statement
[1:02:20] because you are just as smart
[1:02:24] you have intelligence
[1:02:26] you're just not grown yet you're just
[1:02:27] not mature yet and I thought how much
[1:02:29] more in the spiritual realm does that
[1:02:31] apply in our lives
[1:02:33] sometimes we can be very intelligent but
[1:02:35] spiritually speaking we're still growing
[1:02:38] and every one of us are and I'll say it
[1:02:41] this way brothers and sisters if we're
[1:02:42] not growing we're dying
[1:02:45] That's the Law of the universe
[1:02:48] if we're not growing then we're dying I
[1:02:51] heard a brother say it one time you know
[1:02:52] God is only interested in one thing
[1:02:55] and I thought wow that's fascinating
[1:02:57] only one thing and he said yeah
[1:02:59] spiritual growth
[1:03:01] he's not concerned about your house
[1:03:03] he's not concerned about your car he's
[1:03:05] not concerned about your bank accounts
[1:03:07] he's not concerned about your
[1:03:09] Investments he's not concerned about any
[1:03:11] of the the trivial things that we
[1:03:13] contend with in this world that are
[1:03:15] frivolous it's all going to burn the
[1:03:17] only thing he's interested in is that
[1:03:18] character that matches his word his life
[1:03:22] being lived out through us
[1:03:25] and so long as we are willing to
[1:03:26] actually subject ourselves to that
[1:03:27] that's where the intelligence comes in
[1:03:29] that's where the true spiritual growth
[1:03:32] happens
[1:03:34] it's just beautiful I don't know I got
[1:03:36] so inspired when I was thinking about it
[1:03:37] but
[1:03:39] you know I I just thought I would take a
[1:03:40] little bit of a different direction
[1:03:41] today as we're going to start in October
[1:03:45] it's hard to believe
[1:03:47] that uh you know we're already 17 days
[1:03:49] into September
[1:03:53] there's been times in Calgary I'm sure
[1:03:55] some of us can remember where we've had
[1:03:57] a foot of snow at this time already in
[1:04:00] Calgary but thanks be to God we've got
[1:04:03] some nice warm weather here and we'll
[1:04:05] just trust that the Lord will allow us
[1:04:07] to do what needs to be done before that
[1:04:09] winter time condition sets in
[1:04:12] I just wanted to take a little bit a
[1:04:14] look at at the Book of Revelation as we
[1:04:16] as we begin our study into uh the
[1:04:20] exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:04:22] in October
[1:04:24] I just wanted to do a little bit of
[1:04:25] background a little bit of foundational
[1:04:27] work a little bit of discussion about
[1:04:29] this and and we'll just see what the
[1:04:31] Lord will do before we go too far with
[1:04:33] it though we have some announcements
[1:04:34] we've got the Sunday communion happening
[1:04:37] tonight at six o'clock all is welcome
[1:04:39] all are welcome however you want to say
[1:04:42] that
[1:04:43] um we do have brother James Nevada Bandy
[1:04:45] here on Sunday October the 1st that was
[1:04:47] changed from September the 28th so if
[1:04:51] you haven't changed your calendar maybe
[1:04:52] just mark it down those are
[1:04:54] circumstances Beyond My Control if that
[1:04:56] becomes a bit of a frustration I I can't
[1:04:59] help it it's just the way it worked out
[1:05:00] so we are looking forward to seeing
[1:05:03] brother James here again
[1:05:05] um and again as I mentioned we will be
[1:05:07] doing the uh the study of the seven
[1:05:09] Church ages if anybody's interested in
[1:05:11] getting their hands on a book please let
[1:05:14] me know we have some in the back
[1:05:16] um they're dwindling now though but I
[1:05:18] ordered a whole bunch more because I
[1:05:20] think it's really important for us even
[1:05:22] if you just misplaced yours and and you
[1:05:24] want to have another one that you can
[1:05:25] maybe underline and highlight by all
[1:05:27] means just let me know I really want to
[1:05:29] take some time and study this I think
[1:05:31] there's so much in there that uh really
[1:05:32] will help us
[1:05:34] um we also just want to make a note that
[1:05:36] uh sister Rosie who's just been a
[1:05:39] wonderful addition to our congregation
[1:05:41] every single time she comes
[1:05:43] today will be her last service with us
[1:05:45] she's going back to India this week
[1:05:47] so please take the time to greet sister
[1:05:49] Rosie she's just a fine example of a
[1:05:52] real believer and it's wonderful to see
[1:05:54] that you know even in India this message
[1:05:56] of the hour has has definitely taken
[1:05:59] hold
[1:06:01] we had a wonderful time Thursday night
[1:06:03] at the prayer meeting just a wonderful
[1:06:05] time together and I just would like to
[1:06:07] encourage everyone you know if in our
[1:06:09] lives we have circumstances and
[1:06:12] situations if we want to see change in
[1:06:15] our lives
[1:06:16] then we've got to make a change in our
[1:06:18] lives
[1:06:19] and you know I'll just leave it there
[1:06:22] we cannot do what we always do and
[1:06:25] expect to see something different
[1:06:27] I've heard it said if you do what you've
[1:06:29] always done you're going to get what
[1:06:30] you've always got
[1:06:32] I say Lord help me
[1:06:34] we had a wonderful time though and uh I
[1:06:37] just would like to encourage anyone if
[1:06:38] you have the desire to see change in
[1:06:41] your life then maybe take a step of
[1:06:43] faith and just see if God won't do
[1:06:45] something for you
[1:06:47] um The Book of Revelation
[1:06:49] just a wonderful book in my life I was
[1:06:52] always drawn to it and uh I know that I
[1:06:56] actually got in trouble at one point I
[1:06:59] was given the opportunity to and I'd say
[1:07:01] it that way to go to a Christian School
[1:07:03] for a while and uh I remember there was
[1:07:06] a class they called religion and I'll
[1:07:09] never forget clearly how they explained
[1:07:11] the godhead in that class and even then
[1:07:14] I couldn't really understand it how can
[1:07:16] you take God and make him a triangle of
[1:07:19] three circles it just it just didn't add
[1:07:21] up to me I could never understand it it
[1:07:23] just didn't settle right with me and I
[1:07:25] would read this book of Revelation and
[1:07:28] and while they would be talking about
[1:07:29] this godhead Theory I would be reading
[1:07:31] this book of Revelation and and and with
[1:07:34] John as he was looking at the open door
[1:07:36] that was given to him when he was called
[1:07:38] to come up a little higher into heaven
[1:07:40] you know and I would just be thinking
[1:07:42] about that in the picture that was there
[1:07:44] how he saw one on the throne but yet
[1:07:47] here they are talking about three if
[1:07:49] that was the case why wouldn't he have
[1:07:51] seen three on the throne if it was three
[1:07:54] separate persons as the doctrine of the
[1:07:56] Trinity says but I just find it
[1:07:59] fascinating we could we could just start
[1:08:00] with the very first verse the revelation
[1:08:03] of Jesus Christ
[1:08:05] and that's all we need to say that's
[1:08:07] what we're doing that's what this is
[1:08:09] that's what the message of the hour is
[1:08:10] the revelation of Jesus Christ and what
[1:08:14] is the Revelation it's God himself
[1:08:16] revealing himself personally to the
[1:08:19] individual and we know that that's what
[1:08:20] the new birth is it's not some great
[1:08:22] theological debate or discussion which
[1:08:25] is what some folks want to make it it's
[1:08:27] not that at all it's a new birth it's
[1:08:30] dying out to the old self and allowing
[1:08:32] some other life to come and live inside
[1:08:35] of us
[1:08:36] but my goodness that takes a lot of
[1:08:39] humility to be able to do that
[1:08:41] but it's wonderful with this God that we
[1:08:43] serve we spoke about at the very
[1:08:45] beginning the same yesterday today and
[1:08:47] forever the same one that was there with
[1:08:50] Lazarus at the grave is the same one
[1:08:51] that's here with us right now
[1:08:53] I just think it's beautiful you know
[1:08:55] when we talked about it a little while
[1:08:57] ago how we have the opportunity we've
[1:09:00] invited him just like Simon the Pharisee
[1:09:03] but brother Brown talks about the
[1:09:05] Pharisee and how how much they were
[1:09:07] enemies of Jesus they did not like Jesus
[1:09:10] at all they had disdain for Jesus but
[1:09:12] yet he invited Jesus to his celebration
[1:09:15] but wasn't it interesting that it was a
[1:09:17] prostitute one who was ill-famed that
[1:09:20] actually took the money that she got
[1:09:22] from her business
[1:09:23] and bought that ointment that spikenard
[1:09:26] and anointed him before he was to be
[1:09:28] sacrificed it took a prostitute someone
[1:09:31] who was that filthy to come and actually
[1:09:33] anoint him even when the most religious
[1:09:35] folks of the day
[1:09:36] stood there saying why don't you show us
[1:09:39] a miracle and then we'll believe
[1:09:41] why don't you turn this water to wine
[1:09:43] why don't you do something fantastic for
[1:09:45] us here today give us a show
[1:09:48] and then laughing at him
[1:09:50] but it took this prostitute this one who
[1:09:53] wasn't worthy and something inside of
[1:09:56] her though
[1:09:58] it gave her the ability to understand
[1:10:00] what needed to happen
[1:10:02] and you know what that is that's
[1:10:03] revelation
[1:10:04] that was God making himself real to her
[1:10:08] because everyone else said no way don't
[1:10:09] do it why would you allow this woman
[1:10:14] just like when Jesus said you know he
[1:10:16] had the needs to go by the way of
[1:10:17] Samaria
[1:10:19] he went and sat down on Jacob's Well
[1:10:21] didn't he
[1:10:22] he sent the disciples away to go and get
[1:10:24] some vittles they needed some food
[1:10:27] and they knew what time of day it was
[1:10:29] and they thought Master why do you want
[1:10:30] to sit here now don't you know what time
[1:10:32] of day it is don't you know what's gonna
[1:10:34] happen here you got the potential to be
[1:10:36] connecting yourself with ill-famed women
[1:10:40] but here he goes and sits down and they
[1:10:42] leave him
[1:10:43] and what happens the ill-famed woman
[1:10:45] comes out and it took an ill-famed woman
[1:10:48] to run into the city to say hey come and
[1:10:50] take a look at a man who's told me the
[1:10:52] things that I've done
[1:10:53] and what happened we know the whole city
[1:10:55] believed her but she was the ill-famed
[1:10:58] woman she was The Prostitute once again
[1:11:00] isn't it interesting to think brothers
[1:11:02] and sisters God doesn't do things the
[1:11:04] way the most religious people think that
[1:11:07] he should do it God does things the way
[1:11:10] God does things and we know for sure
[1:11:12] that if you trace the lineage of Jesus
[1:11:15] Christ when he came into the world he
[1:11:17] didn't come through the purebred
[1:11:19] bloodline of all of the Saints did he
[1:11:24] you can trace it right back to the
[1:11:26] Scarlet thread the woman who actually
[1:11:28] was cut the deal with the spies who was
[1:11:31] that woman
[1:11:33] that woman was an ill-famed woman too
[1:11:36] wasn't she in Jericho
[1:11:40] but they said just take this cord this
[1:11:42] chord let it be a an accord between us
[1:11:46] and thee and you make sure that you put
[1:11:48] that cord on display that Scarlet
[1:11:50] colored cord I remember brother Harold
[1:11:53] Hildebrandt preaching on that one time
[1:11:54] it just struck me so significantly the
[1:11:57] Scarlet thread and how it just goes
[1:12:00] through all the Bible all the way along
[1:12:02] just so you preached a masterpiece on
[1:12:04] that but isn't it interest testing it
[1:12:06] was the ill-famed woman again but that
[1:12:09] was the lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:12:11] take it back to the Bible and see if
[1:12:13] it's not true
[1:12:15] Jesus chose to come that way
[1:12:20] that's where we have to say brothers and
[1:12:22] sisters
[1:12:24] it wasn't Mary
[1:12:26] and it wasn't Joseph it was God
[1:12:30] it wasn't it wasn't God plus Mary
[1:12:35] it was God plus God
[1:12:37] in Mary
[1:12:40] and even Mary she had to have her own
[1:12:41] Upper Room experience
[1:12:44] but I just think this is beautiful this
[1:12:45] this is This Book of Revelation is the
[1:12:48] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:12:50] gave unto him
[1:12:53] God gave unto who
[1:12:55] God gave unto Jesus
[1:12:57] God wanted to reveal himself so he gave
[1:13:01] this Revelation to Jesus Jesus gave this
[1:13:03] Revelation unto John
[1:13:06] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:13:08] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[1:13:12] things which must shortly come to pass
[1:13:16] and I just think it's beautiful we could
[1:13:17] stop there and talk for a little bit
[1:13:19] because we know as Believers of the
[1:13:21] message of the hour that this is
[1:13:22] something that somewhere somehow
[1:13:24] sometime along the way this had to be
[1:13:27] revealed didn't it
[1:13:29] it has to Somewhere in Time and I'm sure
[1:13:31] that maybe theologians would say sure it
[1:13:34] has to happen Somewhere in Time there
[1:13:36] has to be an event a place a time where
[1:13:40] something becomes revealed to the people
[1:13:43] but the word says it must shortly come
[1:13:45] to pass
[1:13:46] now some people would say well it's
[1:13:48] already happened years and years ago and
[1:13:50] we're already in the Millennium and
[1:13:52] there's other people that will say well
[1:13:53] it's it's got to happen somewhere out
[1:13:55] there in the future
[1:13:58] but we had a prophet of God a messenger
[1:14:00] from God a man that God chose to use as
[1:14:04] his messenger his voice box as a major
[1:14:06] prophet to deliver a message unto the
[1:14:08] people that this is actually happening
[1:14:10] every single time you read this book
[1:14:13] it's unveiling it's revealing because if
[1:14:17] you go on further verse 3 says blessed
[1:14:19] is he that readeth and I think it's
[1:14:21] beautiful because you don't even have to
[1:14:22] read this book
[1:14:24] because it says and they that heareth
[1:14:27] this book
[1:14:29] so if we just listen to the Book of
[1:14:31] Revelation
[1:14:32] we're blessed for it
[1:14:34] but I think it's wonderful because it
[1:14:35] doesn't apply just to the Book of
[1:14:37] Revelation
[1:14:38] we don't want to take God and put them
[1:14:39] in a box and say that these words are
[1:14:41] only applicable to the Book of
[1:14:42] Revelation even though it's written in
[1:14:44] the Book of Revelation I'm not going to
[1:14:45] take it and try and spin it into
[1:14:46] something that it's not but I would say
[1:14:48] if you listen to this word of God you're
[1:14:50] blessed
[1:14:51] doesn't matter whether it's Genesis
[1:14:53] Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy
[1:14:55] Joshua Judges Ruth whatever it is all
[1:14:58] the way through any Scripture you're
[1:15:00] blessed by it
[1:15:01] just don't add to it or try and take
[1:15:03] away from it
[1:15:04] that's the key but I want to get to this
[1:15:07] part today you know
[1:15:09] um the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[1:15:11] God gave unto him to show unto his
[1:15:14] servants things which must shortly come
[1:15:16] to pass and he sent and signified it
[1:15:20] by his angel
[1:15:22] unto his servant John
[1:15:24] I just want to take that and I'm
[1:15:26] probably going to stop there we'll maybe
[1:15:27] bounce around a little bit but I just
[1:15:29] think that's so rich it's so packed
[1:15:32] we'll take some time and try and unpack
[1:15:34] it a little bit but isn't it wonderful
[1:15:35] to think that he is the same yesterday
[1:15:37] today and forever and he did send and
[1:15:40] signify this message to a group of
[1:15:43] people isn't it wonderful to think that
[1:15:45] John is a type of the Bride so if we
[1:15:47] could just take John's name out of there
[1:15:49] just put your name in there he he sent
[1:15:51] and signified it what does the word
[1:15:53] signified mean it means to explain it
[1:15:57] means to show it means to declare it
[1:16:00] means to reveal he signified it himself
[1:16:03] by his angel
[1:16:06] unto John
[1:16:08] I think it's just amazing to think that
[1:16:10] we have been given the ability to see it
[1:16:13] we've been given the ability to
[1:16:15] recognize it who we are where we are at
[1:16:18] that he himself has come
[1:16:22] and signified it he sent it but then he
[1:16:25] came to signify it by his Angel and you
[1:16:28] know what what am I saying by that I'll
[1:16:30] say it plainly his Angel messenger we
[1:16:33] know that we can talk in the Bible and
[1:16:35] and angels are are called men
[1:16:38] it's not just that there was an angel
[1:16:40] that came to visit many times the the
[1:16:43] the the description in the scripture
[1:16:46] will say a man came to me I turned and I
[1:16:48] saw a man it's a description of a man a
[1:16:51] man a man and why would that be any
[1:16:53] different today why would it be any
[1:16:55] different today that it would be an
[1:16:57] angel we could say angel or a man the
[1:16:59] word of God says that many people
[1:17:00] entertain angels unawares we need to
[1:17:03] make sure that we understand where we
[1:17:04] stand that who we're talking to and I
[1:17:07] think it's wonderful because we could
[1:17:08] say you know if we saw an Angel Today
[1:17:10] wow we would have reverence for him
[1:17:12] wouldn't we we know that John tried to
[1:17:14] bow down twice in the Book of Revelation
[1:17:16] and worship that angel
[1:17:18] but what happened that angel said see
[1:17:20] don't do it not I'm I'm a fellow servant
[1:17:22] don't do that get up and worship God
[1:17:24] he's the one that we worship we don't
[1:17:26] worship men we don't worship angels we
[1:17:29] don't worship other men even prophets we
[1:17:31] don't worship them we worship God that's
[1:17:33] all
[1:17:37] and you know there's uh there's another
[1:17:38] story in the Bible I think it's even
[1:17:40] with Cornelius I could be wrong he
[1:17:43] desired to worship when Peter went to
[1:17:45] him and he got the Holy Ghost he got so
[1:17:47] inspired he got a little Pentecostal he
[1:17:49] wanted to worship Peter said don't do it
[1:17:51] no way the Same Spirit don't worship a
[1:17:55] man worship God
[1:17:58] I want to say that today brothers and
[1:17:59] sisters don't worship a man
[1:18:01] Calgary Living Word assembly ain't about
[1:18:03] Worship in men the message of the hour
[1:18:06] is not about Worship in men the message
[1:18:08] of the hour is about worshiping God and
[1:18:11] if anybody brings another message
[1:18:12] anything besides what Paul preached let
[1:18:15] him be accursed
[1:18:20] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:18:23] which God sent and signified it by his
[1:18:26] Angel unto his servant John
[1:18:30] so I just want to say it today you know
[1:18:31] what he has sent and signified it by his
[1:18:34] Angel I'll say it this way I'll say it
[1:18:36] plainly by his Angel William Miriam
[1:18:38] Branham to this generation
[1:18:41] because this is a type of John the Bride
[1:18:44] of Jesus Christ
[1:18:45] we have such an absolute privilege
[1:18:48] I can't even express it this morning
[1:18:50] what I feel
[1:18:51] have you ever thought about that how
[1:18:53] incredible is it that we're able to hear
[1:18:56] these words that we're able to receive
[1:18:58] these words that were able to be a part
[1:19:01] of this and and maybe not in a great way
[1:19:03] in terms of doing great things for the
[1:19:05] message of the hour you know what we
[1:19:07] don't have to do great things for the
[1:19:08] message of the hour the message of the
[1:19:10] hour will do great things for itself
[1:19:12] just like we don't have to make excuses
[1:19:14] for the word of God the word of God will
[1:19:17] actually defend itself
[1:19:19] so if we get caught up trying to defend
[1:19:21] the word of God you know what there's
[1:19:23] something maybe a little bit Askew I
[1:19:24] would say God will deal with it himself
[1:19:28] but you know looking at this this this
[1:19:30] revelation of Jesus Christ I trust that
[1:19:33] that's what's happened to every single
[1:19:35] one of us today we have to have the
[1:19:37] revelation of Jesus Christ and we know
[1:19:40] that William Branham he preached a
[1:19:42] message titled Christ is the mystery of
[1:19:47] God revealed
[1:19:50] not Christ is the mystery of three
[1:19:53] persons revealed
[1:19:56] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:20:00] God decided to come in flesh and he used
[1:20:02] the word and morphe and that means just
[1:20:05] changing of a mask to go from one to the
[1:20:08] other how could we as human beings how
[1:20:11] could we say
[1:20:13] how God should do
[1:20:14] doesn't it say in the word that you know
[1:20:17] how can the pot say to the Potter how I
[1:20:20] should be
[1:20:21] how can we do that how could we say that
[1:20:24] God cannot change masks that God cannot
[1:20:27] operate through three
[1:20:30] positions
[1:20:31] three offices
[1:20:33] one God
[1:20:36] it's so important for us to know this
[1:20:38] I think it's wonderful and the reason
[1:20:40] I'm going this way I I had a
[1:20:42] conversation with someone who was very
[1:20:44] much trinitarian and very much wanted to
[1:20:46] express to me how important it was for
[1:20:49] me to understand that this trinitarian
[1:20:52] Doctrine is actually correct and when
[1:20:54] you start to get into Oneness Doctrine
[1:20:57] which is what he called me because of
[1:20:58] what he he just sort of slung on me you
[1:21:00] know what do you believe and I kind of
[1:21:02] told him a little bit I didn't tell him
[1:21:03] a lot but he said all your Oneness your
[1:21:05] Oneness and so he's trying to pigeonhole
[1:21:07] me in that position and I'm like hold on
[1:21:09] a second just relax but he said it's
[1:21:11] really important that you understand
[1:21:12] this Doctrine and I say why is that
[1:21:16] why are we having such a a discussion
[1:21:18] here what's the problem man aren't we
[1:21:21] believers
[1:21:22] I'm not looking to see what you believe
[1:21:24] I'm not pushing my agenda you're the one
[1:21:26] coming after me
[1:21:28] but hey if you want to talk about it
[1:21:29] let's talk about it
[1:21:33] one God three offices
[1:21:37] now I would step back and say well why
[1:21:39] couldn't it be God who would say that's
[1:21:41] three persons let's just be the advocate
[1:21:44] for a moment
[1:21:45] because it's possible it's God right
[1:21:49] but it's not God's that's the problem as
[1:21:53] soon as you put the plural on it you
[1:21:54] make it three individuals three persons
[1:21:58] is three individuals and that is exactly
[1:22:00] what the message of the hour said you
[1:22:02] can't take God and cut them into three
[1:22:04] pieces and give them to a believer
[1:22:07] you know that brother Bradham said you
[1:22:08] can't cut God in three pieces and give
[1:22:09] them to a Jew but I would say you can't
[1:22:11] give them to a Believer either
[1:22:13] it's not three persons it's one person
[1:22:17] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:21] the mystery of God revealed
[1:22:24] and you know once you see it it's so
[1:22:26] simple
[1:22:27] but it can be so difficult to get Beyond
[1:22:29] those teachings you know the Catholic
[1:22:31] Church says give me a child till the age
[1:22:33] of five and we'll have them for life
[1:22:36] how much of the Catholic Doctrine is
[1:22:39] taken and actually preached to people in
[1:22:43] different churches different
[1:22:44] denominations different schools
[1:22:47] I think if we were to take a close look
[1:22:49] at it we would see it's quite prevalent
[1:22:53] but you know I'm not here to slam the
[1:22:54] Catholic church I'm not here to slam
[1:22:56] anyone the only thing I want to do is is
[1:22:59] represent this word of God and the
[1:23:01] revelation of Jesus Christ to the church
[1:23:04] today it's got to be a Living Word
[1:23:07] brothers and sisters not not some word
[1:23:09] from the past that some man had some
[1:23:11] great ministry and I'm sure that people
[1:23:14] would be getting upset with me right now
[1:23:15] because I may be saying something slight
[1:23:18] against the prophet I'm not saying
[1:23:19] anything slight against the prophet but
[1:23:20] I'll tell you what the prophet said the
[1:23:22] moment you try and make me anything more
[1:23:25] than what I am you make me Antichrist
[1:23:27] I'm your brother
[1:23:33] so I just want to present Jesus Christ
[1:23:35] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:23:38] out of 1960 1204m the revelation of
[1:23:43] Jesus Christ
[1:23:44] if you want to see where some of my
[1:23:46] Inspirations coming from for all of the
[1:23:49] discussion now as we head into this uh
[1:23:51] study of the exposition of the seven
[1:23:54] Church ages
[1:23:57] this message here is a real good place
[1:23:58] to start
[1:24:00] the radam says now we're holding the
[1:24:02] fourth and sixth verse in view both of
[1:24:05] them are the same
[1:24:07] let's just pause there for a second and
[1:24:09] just read them the first verse
[1:24:11] in Revelations chapter 1 it says the
[1:24:13] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:24:15] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[1:24:17] things which must shortly come to pass
[1:24:21] and he has sent and signified it by his
[1:24:24] Angel unto his servant John jump down to
[1:24:28] verse six and hath made us Kings and
[1:24:31] Priests unto God and his father to him
[1:24:34] be glory and Dominion forever and ever
[1:24:39] they don't sound the same to me
[1:24:42] do they sound the same to you
[1:24:44] but here we have brother Brad I'm saying
[1:24:45] now we're holding the fourth and sixth
[1:24:47] verse in view both of them are the same
[1:24:49] one says to he which was which is which
[1:24:54] is to come what's he trying to put
[1:24:56] before the church
[1:24:58] his deity
[1:25:00] today
[1:25:02] people try to make him a prophet he's
[1:25:05] more than a prophet and some people try
[1:25:07] to make him three Gods he's not three
[1:25:09] gods
[1:25:10] he's one God that live in three offices
[1:25:13] three manifestations of the same God
[1:25:17] I don't know where that becomes so
[1:25:19] complicated other than the schooling
[1:25:22] maybe where we get a degree and and we
[1:25:24] pass the test based on the answers that
[1:25:26] are asked the questions that are asked
[1:25:28] for the excuse me the answers that we
[1:25:30] give
[1:25:31] and all it is is studying the
[1:25:33] theological
[1:25:34] program
[1:25:36] this is what they're teaching this is
[1:25:38] what we need to actually explain
[1:25:41] it's not three Gods he's one God that
[1:25:43] lived in three offices
[1:25:45] three manifestations of the same God now
[1:25:48] remember this is the revelation
[1:25:51] and whosoever heareth it and don't keep
[1:25:53] the sayings of this book his part will
[1:25:55] be taken from The Book of Life Jesus is
[1:25:57] not revealing himself as three gods
[1:26:01] but one God in three offices
[1:26:05] oh it's going to get rich after a while
[1:26:08] when we get into those Church ages and
[1:26:11] see where they lost that
[1:26:14] it caused a great split at the niacin
[1:26:17] Council
[1:26:18] both of them went off on deep ends and
[1:26:22] this is where I think it's absolutely
[1:26:23] beautiful if we just take a breath and
[1:26:25] we just take a look and we're willing to
[1:26:28] just examine what's being said here it's
[1:26:31] so beautiful because he's not putting it
[1:26:33] off on one and saying one is terrible
[1:26:35] and putting it off on the other and
[1:26:37] saying the other one is terrible he's
[1:26:38] saying they're both just off they're
[1:26:41] just wrong
[1:26:42] but if you just look at the middle come
[1:26:44] back to the middle of it you can
[1:26:46] actually see the truth of the matter
[1:26:49] says they both went off on deep ends at
[1:26:51] the Nicene Council and they'd done the
[1:26:53] same thing in this last days again just
[1:26:55] like
[1:26:56] a pre-nicene council again because there
[1:27:00] will be another one and I'll bring it
[1:27:02] later on brothers and sisters there is a
[1:27:04] modern Nicene Council that's actually
[1:27:06] happened
[1:27:07] I'll bring it and and we'll talk about
[1:27:09] it but he says it here as a prophet it
[1:27:13] the same thing in this last days again
[1:27:15] just like a pre-nician council again
[1:27:17] because there will be another one just
[1:27:20] as certain as I'm standing here the
[1:27:22] Catholic and Protestant churches will
[1:27:25] unite something together or agree with
[1:27:27] one another does anybody remember the
[1:27:30] the the the the video that brother Ken
[1:27:33] presented of Tony Palmer
[1:27:35] in the states with uh with The
[1:27:39] ecumenical council
[1:27:40] boy oh boy and it explained exactly what
[1:27:44] brother Brown was talking about here
[1:27:46] he said you know what Luther's protest
[1:27:49] was then
[1:27:50] but the protest is over
[1:27:53] he said that there was an amends made
[1:27:55] between I think it's the Lutheran Church
[1:27:57] and the Catholic church and he brought
[1:27:59] it himself he went and made amends and
[1:28:02] they signed the document this is in the
[1:28:05] last decade in our world that we live in
[1:28:08] here we have a Prophet this is in 1960 I
[1:28:11] believe
[1:28:12] saying that they will happen again and
[1:28:14] now we have that the protest is over and
[1:28:17] he said so being that the protest is
[1:28:19] over and that the the name Catholic
[1:28:21] means Universal
[1:28:24] what's what's your protest
[1:28:27] and you know the interesting thing is
[1:28:29] that brother Branham brought was that
[1:28:31] you know it's the Harlot the great
[1:28:33] Harlot and then her daughters
[1:28:35] whether we understand it or not all of
[1:28:38] the denominational churches are falling
[1:28:40] under the headship of Rome
[1:28:43] all of them
[1:28:45] and it will come to the place we have
[1:28:47] the prophecy and people would say well
[1:28:48] now you're getting crazy talking about
[1:28:49] prophecy but we've got the prophecy that
[1:28:52] says there will come a time where you
[1:28:54] will either Kiss the Ring you'll say
[1:28:57] that I will just say you know it's going
[1:28:59] to be the best for the church to
[1:29:00] actually keep the doors open we don't
[1:29:03] want to actually have to close the doors
[1:29:04] and maybe have home church and be a
[1:29:06] bunch of weirdos on the street that are
[1:29:08] are singing the Praises of Jesus what we
[1:29:10] want to do is actually keep it calm and
[1:29:12] cool so we'll just say okay I'll sign
[1:29:14] the document and we'll fall under that
[1:29:16] headship and we'll keep the doors open
[1:29:18] there's churches that will do that
[1:29:19] there's others that will say I need a
[1:29:21] job I need a meal ticket I've got to
[1:29:24] stay in a position so long as I can feed
[1:29:27] my family
[1:29:29] but we got a prophet that said you know
[1:29:30] what when that happens watch the third
[1:29:32] poll then
[1:29:33] watch what happens then when they really
[1:29:35] try to put the squeeze on people and
[1:29:37] they really try to shut the churches of
[1:29:39] the Living God down
[1:29:42] then you'll see a short powerful
[1:29:44] demonstration of the life of Jesus
[1:29:46] Christ
[1:29:47] if you want to take away our food go
[1:29:49] ahead God will provide
[1:29:52] because we're going to live on every
[1:29:54] single word that proceeds out of the
[1:29:56] mouth of God we're not going to actually
[1:29:57] rely on natural bread
[1:30:02] brother Bradham says and they've done
[1:30:03] the same thing in this last days again
[1:30:05] just like a pre-nicene council again
[1:30:07] because there will be another one just
[1:30:08] as certain as I'm standing here the
[1:30:10] Catholic and Protestant churches will
[1:30:13] unite something together or agree with
[1:30:16] one another
[1:30:18] look at the Archbishop of Canterbury
[1:30:19] over there now all of it's heaping right
[1:30:21] up together and there's not a Triune God
[1:30:25] teaching in the Bible there's one God
[1:30:29] as true even the trinitarians will say
[1:30:31] that there's not a Triune teaching in
[1:30:34] the Bible
[1:30:35] but they'll say the Great Commission was
[1:30:37] you know to go into the world and
[1:30:39] baptized in the name of the father name
[1:30:40] of the son and the name of the Holy
[1:30:42] Ghost
[1:30:43] but if you listen to that statement it
[1:30:46] says names so who's the names we've gone
[1:30:49] over and over and over with this but I
[1:30:51] think it's just so important brothers
[1:30:52] and sisters we need to understand it we
[1:30:54] need to recognize it maybe somebody here
[1:30:55] today just doesn't really get it and
[1:30:57] that's the reason why we're going this
[1:30:59] way I don't know but we we just need to
[1:31:01] keep talking about it stirring up our
[1:31:03] Pure Minds by way of remembrance
[1:31:05] he says and it's revealed here in the
[1:31:07] Book of Revelation that the whole Canon
[1:31:09] of scriptures might be proven here and
[1:31:11] Christ set his seal upon it that's it
[1:31:14] if anyone takes away or adds to it the
[1:31:17] same will be taken out of the book of
[1:31:18] life for him so approach this not
[1:31:20] selfishly approach this with an open
[1:31:23] heart
[1:31:24] and an open mind
[1:31:26] I think that's so beautiful if we could
[1:31:28] just do that if if we could just look at
[1:31:31] it with an open heart and an open mind I
[1:31:34] believe God would reveal himself further
[1:31:37] to us
[1:31:38] we all want to go further with Christ we
[1:31:40] all want a greater Revelation I don't
[1:31:42] think any one of us wants to stay in the
[1:31:44] same position that we're at and and you
[1:31:46] know maybe some of this is is just just
[1:31:48] Elementary for the veteran Believers but
[1:31:51] maybe there's someone here in this
[1:31:52] one-room schoolhouse that's never really
[1:31:54] understood what this means
[1:31:59] I think it's beautiful because I'll say
[1:32:01] it this way if we have an open mind and
[1:32:04] an open heart
[1:32:05] we're not looking for a fight
[1:32:08] in fact when we believe this truth this
[1:32:11] message of the hour we're not looking
[1:32:12] for a fight
[1:32:14] we're not looking to go and get in our
[1:32:16] our our co-workers faces and our friends
[1:32:19] faces and our neighbors faces and put
[1:32:21] our finger in their nose and try and
[1:32:23] ramrod some Doctrine about this this
[1:32:26] this Oneness of God down their throat
[1:32:28] about the message of the hour we're not
[1:32:30] doing that and you know brothers and
[1:32:31] sisters when we see that when we see
[1:32:33] people claiming the message of the hour
[1:32:35] but looking to fight about it I want to
[1:32:37] say this there's something wrong
[1:32:40] it's not the right Spirit of Christ
[1:32:42] never went and fought against anyone the
[1:32:45] only thing that he did was he called out
[1:32:47] the most religious people of the day
[1:32:50] because he knew exactly where who they
[1:32:52] were and what they needed to do
[1:32:55] but that doesn't give us license to go
[1:32:57] and behave that way
[1:32:59] we need to live the life of Jesus Christ
[1:33:00] and that life is of love
[1:33:03] and of understanding
[1:33:05] and of forgiveness
[1:33:07] we talked about forgiveness last week
[1:33:10] are you your brother's keeper
[1:33:12] the week before are you your brother's
[1:33:15] keeper if we've got the attitude that
[1:33:17] we're not our Brother's Keeper then
[1:33:19] whose Spirit are we displaying
[1:33:24] but the battle says no the Nicene
[1:33:25] Council
[1:33:27] they come to two great decisions
[1:33:29] oh many of them in that day of the early
[1:33:32] church fathers they had two extreme
[1:33:34] views one of them was a Triune God a
[1:33:37] trinitarian and the other was a one God
[1:33:40] and they both come into existence and
[1:33:43] went out on two straight limbs out like
[1:33:45] that
[1:33:46] the tri-unity became a place of a three
[1:33:49] God person
[1:33:51] the Oneness became a Unitarian just as
[1:33:55] far wrong as the other one was
[1:33:59] so they both went out on limbs but right
[1:34:01] here reveals the truth
[1:34:04] right in the middle reveals the truth
[1:34:07] Jesus could not be his own father
[1:34:10] neither if he had a father outside of
[1:34:12] the Holy Spirit then he is an
[1:34:15] illegitimate child
[1:34:19] it's Joseph's child he's illegitimate
[1:34:23] and not the Holy Ghost conceived them
[1:34:26] and he said God was his father so the
[1:34:30] Holy Ghost and God
[1:34:32] that's Matthew 1 18 if the Holy Ghost
[1:34:35] and God has to be the same person or he
[1:34:39] had two daddies
[1:34:42] he just explains it so good doesn't he
[1:34:45] how could he have two daddies
[1:34:48] he can't
[1:34:49] so how can you say three persons
[1:34:54] especially when Jesus he told his
[1:34:56] disciples and he told everyone that was
[1:34:58] around him that day when they picked up
[1:35:00] stones to Stone him he didn't say I and
[1:35:02] my father are three
[1:35:04] or I and my father are too because
[1:35:06] that's really what it would have been
[1:35:07] the other two
[1:35:10] I and my father are one
[1:35:14] I and my father are why would he say
[1:35:16] that
[1:35:17] if it was three persons
[1:35:20] he says that's Matthew 1 18. it's the
[1:35:22] Holy Ghost and God has to be the same
[1:35:24] person or he's two daddies
[1:35:27] and he was called Emmanuel which is God
[1:35:29] With Us
[1:35:33] how could Jesus be God if it's three
[1:35:35] persons
[1:35:37] I just I was so fascinated with that a
[1:35:39] little while ago Emmanuel God With Us it
[1:35:41] just makes it so plain you just start to
[1:35:43] see it everywhere in the scripture it's
[1:35:46] not something that's a great mystery
[1:35:48] even though it is a mystery until God
[1:35:50] reveals it
[1:35:51] because we can talk about it till we're
[1:35:53] blue on the face but until God removes
[1:35:55] that Veil
[1:35:56] we're going to be blinded to it
[1:35:58] you know brothers and sisters it's only
[1:36:00] because he's removed that Veil from our
[1:36:02] eyes from our spiritual eyes from our
[1:36:04] hearts from our minds that we're able to
[1:36:06] see this truth
[1:36:08] there's no nothing in us that Puffs us
[1:36:11] up to say oh I was born into the message
[1:36:13] so I've got some special seating at the
[1:36:15] table you're a sinner saved by grace
[1:36:18] it's only through faith that we're saved
[1:36:20] lest any man should boast my goodness
[1:36:23] we're all the same that way we're all
[1:36:26] Sinners saved by grace
[1:36:30] but Emmanuel
[1:36:32] it's God With Us
[1:36:34] he he claimed when he was here on Earth
[1:36:36] that he was
[1:36:38] that he and the father was one
[1:36:41] says I got all the scriptures written
[1:36:43] out here
[1:36:45] so that if you could find if we had this
[1:36:46] this question or something
[1:36:49] strongly recommend just looking at this
[1:36:51] message if there's any questions he does
[1:36:53] have it all listed out and perhaps we'll
[1:36:55] get into it a little bit further
[1:36:57] I was having a conversation with myself
[1:37:00] this week I'm pretty good at doing it
[1:37:03] you know
[1:37:04] just thinking about the word
[1:37:08] I think about how the Devil comes around
[1:37:09] and tempts us and
[1:37:11] just tries to hang a number on all of us
[1:37:14] and he knows exactly where our
[1:37:16] weaknesses lie
[1:37:18] he knows exactly what our our parents
[1:37:22] maybe genetic strains are he knows all
[1:37:25] about it
[1:37:26] sometimes better than we do
[1:37:29] and he's always trying to get us always
[1:37:31] throwing banana peels in our path but I
[1:37:33] was having a conversation with myself
[1:37:35] about this topic and you know it just
[1:37:37] occurred to me that Satan really doesn't
[1:37:40] believe
[1:37:42] that we will believe
[1:37:45] Satan believes the word of God
[1:37:49] better than anyone
[1:37:51] because remember we talked about it I
[1:37:52] believe last time we were here Satan
[1:37:55] used to be the right-hand man of God
[1:37:58] he was his right hand agent he was the
[1:38:01] one who was there he was the Archangel
[1:38:04] created co-equal with God Sans the
[1:38:07] ability to create
[1:38:09] so he's got all of the ability but the
[1:38:11] only thing that he can do now is pervert
[1:38:13] since the fall
[1:38:15] but I was thinking about it you know he
[1:38:17] believes the word of God he knows that
[1:38:19] his time is short and that's why he has
[1:38:21] his guns trained on the Bride of Jesus
[1:38:23] Christ
[1:38:24] so while I was having this conversation
[1:38:25] with myself I thought man I I struggle
[1:38:29] sometimes it feels like I just can never
[1:38:31] overcome
[1:38:32] certain things they just continually
[1:38:34] come back and continually come up and
[1:38:36] continually come back constantly in my
[1:38:39] life
[1:38:40] but you know what it ain't gonna stop me
[1:38:43] I'm not looking at that
[1:38:45] I'm looking at the word
[1:38:47] I'm looking at the promise
[1:38:49] we're going to be with him
[1:38:52] we're gonna actually be with him we're
[1:38:54] gonna actually be able to touch him
[1:38:56] we're gonna actually be able to talk to
[1:38:59] him face to face
[1:39:01] there's coming a time where he's going
[1:39:02] to wipe away all the tears and I want to
[1:39:05] say this brothers and sisters when that
[1:39:06] time comes those aren't going to be just
[1:39:08] tears of Sadness and Sorrow those are
[1:39:11] going to be tears of joy recognizing
[1:39:13] that we're Sinners saved by grace
[1:39:17] that we've made it all the struggles
[1:39:20] that we went through were worth it
[1:39:22] every single Mountain that we had to
[1:39:25] climb
[1:39:27] it was worth every minute
[1:39:30] so I just wanted to say today brothers
[1:39:32] and sisters we could probably end the
[1:39:34] service right here but we're not gonna
[1:39:37] but you know what if you believe you
[1:39:39] have already gone beyond what Satan has
[1:39:42] the capacity to believe he doesn't even
[1:39:44] have the capacity to understand that you
[1:39:46] can believe the word of God that you can
[1:39:48] take this book and eat it up and that it
[1:39:51] will be bitter in your belly sweet as
[1:39:54] honey in your mouth my goodness
[1:39:56] we've been keeping bees in the honey
[1:39:58] that you get from bees is pretty sweet
[1:40:00] it's wonderful but you know what
[1:40:03] sometimes our bellies get a little bit
[1:40:05] bitter don't they
[1:40:08] Satan doesn't even have the ability to
[1:40:10] believe
[1:40:11] that we believe
[1:40:13] that's why he comes around and tempts us
[1:40:15] over and over and over and over and you
[1:40:20] know brothers and sisters there has been
[1:40:21] Believers throughout all of the ages and
[1:40:24] they've only been able to live under the
[1:40:26] light that they've been shown throughout
[1:40:28] all of those ages but I want to say this
[1:40:30] to us this morning take courage brothers
[1:40:32] and sisters because we have been given
[1:40:34] something that other ages haven't been
[1:40:36] given and that is the ability to
[1:40:38] overcome all of the devil
[1:40:41] but even though we have these
[1:40:43] Temptations in our lives and we
[1:40:44] continually fall down just remember this
[1:40:47] what's the desire in your heart do you
[1:40:49] still desire to serve God because if you
[1:40:51] still desire to serve God you've already
[1:40:53] got Satan beat he's all ready to
[1:40:55] defeated being in your life
[1:40:59] but he's not going to believe that and
[1:41:01] he's not going to let you believe that
[1:41:03] but I just want to say believe it
[1:41:04] brothers and sisters
[1:41:07] I got to do a little uh a little
[1:41:09] devotional it's strange but true I've
[1:41:12] had a couple opportunities to do it at a
[1:41:14] place called Trinity retirement Lodge
[1:41:16] and it's a place for old folks and old
[1:41:19] folks home and Lord willing I would like
[1:41:21] to get some musicians and some people
[1:41:23] that can sing maybe around Christmas
[1:41:25] time and go there and and maybe just
[1:41:27] witness to them through song I've got
[1:41:30] the door open for that and I'm just
[1:41:32] cultivating that but I've been asked to
[1:41:34] go and take some morning devotionals to
[1:41:36] these people and uh I'll tell you it's
[1:41:39] interesting because they're very much
[1:41:40] trinitarian and very much of of the
[1:41:45] the belief that they have and I don't
[1:41:47] even know what their beliefs are I just
[1:41:49] know that they they're they're in the
[1:41:51] Trinity Lodge but you know it's
[1:41:52] wonderful because I'm like Lord what can
[1:41:55] I say to them I don't want to go and
[1:41:56] talk about this heavy Doctrine and try
[1:41:59] and change their thinking that way I
[1:42:01] want to go and show them your life so
[1:42:03] how do I do that I just show them your
[1:42:05] love
[1:42:06] I believe that's what he showed me so I
[1:42:08] went there on Thursday and I just said
[1:42:09] to them you know what take courage
[1:42:11] brothers and sisters there was maybe
[1:42:12] eight people or ten people there just
[1:42:14] the word of God says he that believeth
[1:42:17] on me shall not come into the
[1:42:19] condemnation but shall have everlasting
[1:42:21] life
[1:42:22] these are people the The Pianist that
[1:42:25] was playing she said you know I I I just
[1:42:28] hope that by the next time you come here
[1:42:30] I'll be already gone
[1:42:33] this is the position of these people I
[1:42:35] shook her hand and I said take courage
[1:42:37] sister just believe
[1:42:39] just believe that's all you got to do
[1:42:41] there's no form of godliness that you
[1:42:43] can try and display try and work
[1:42:45] anything up just believe
[1:42:47] if you can believe then all things are
[1:42:49] possible
[1:42:52] I think it's wonderful God's moving in a
[1:42:55] certain way and uh I'm just going to
[1:42:56] keep going as long as those doors are
[1:42:58] open I'll keep going to do the morning
[1:43:00] devotionals for them it's certainly
[1:43:01] wonderful to just see the Lord move
[1:43:04] but remember Satan doesn't believe that
[1:43:06] we will believe but as long as you can
[1:43:09] believe as long as you can say I believe
[1:43:11] you got them beat Satan is already beat
[1:43:13] right there because the word of God says
[1:43:15] that you're already seated in Heavenly
[1:43:17] places don't get stuck in Revelation or
[1:43:19] in Romans chapter 7 where Paul
[1:43:22] recognizes when I want to do good evil
[1:43:24] as president and every time that I I try
[1:43:26] and fix it I just stumble and fall down
[1:43:28] again and I do evil and over and over
[1:43:31] again I just can't get past myself and
[1:43:33] in the end of that chapter we know that
[1:43:35] he says oh what a Wretched Man I am
[1:43:38] who's going to deliver me of this body
[1:43:40] don't get stuck there brothers and
[1:43:42] sisters it can happen just go flip the
[1:43:44] page go to rev go go to Romans chapter
[1:43:47] 8. there is therefore now no
[1:43:50] condemnation to those who are in Christ
[1:43:53] Jesus if you believe you're in Christ
[1:43:56] Jesus
[1:43:57] Satan wants you to stay stuck there he
[1:43:59] wants you to believe you're defeated
[1:44:00] he's defeated
[1:44:02] you're an overcomer
[1:44:09] I think it's wonderful to look at this
[1:44:11] scripture here you know Revelations
[1:44:13] chapter 1 verse one and I just thought
[1:44:16] about it I said it already the
[1:44:17] definition of signified and if you look
[1:44:19] it up you can you can see that it it is
[1:44:21] sealing it's it's revealing it's
[1:44:25] explaining it's exposing there's a bunch
[1:44:27] of different
[1:44:29] um Jewish descriptions that will go
[1:44:31] along with it or Hebrew descriptions
[1:44:32] that will go along with it out of the
[1:44:34] Strong's Concordance I don't want to
[1:44:36] really go too far into it but I think
[1:44:38] it's just worth talking about he sent
[1:44:40] and signified he sent and explained it
[1:44:42] he sent and revealed it by his Angel
[1:44:45] unto his servant John I just want to say
[1:44:49] it you know what he sent it and signify
[1:44:51] it by his Angel unto his servant the
[1:44:54] bride
[1:44:55] his wife the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:44:57] because the word says blessed are they
[1:44:59] that read if you ever read this word
[1:45:01] brothers and sisters you are blessed
[1:45:03] already Satan hates that he hates the
[1:45:06] fact that you are blessed and remember
[1:45:08] we know the prophet said it and we know
[1:45:10] all of us know it that he hates two
[1:45:12] books in the Bible more than any books
[1:45:14] one of them is the Book of Genesis that
[1:45:17] shows where he first was exposed where
[1:45:19] he first was shown where the fall came
[1:45:22] in and what really happened in the
[1:45:24] Garden of Eden and the Book of
[1:45:25] Revelation one shows his beginning and
[1:45:27] one shows his ending and you know what
[1:45:29] happens this word of God doesn't show
[1:45:31] your beginning and ending this word of
[1:45:34] God shows your beginning and your
[1:45:36] Eternal destination
[1:45:38] there's no Eternal health
[1:45:40] Satan isn't going to burn for eternity
[1:45:42] all the Sinners that get cast into the
[1:45:45] Lake of Fire aren't going to burn for
[1:45:46] eternity they're going to burn forever
[1:45:48] and ever but that's still a space of
[1:45:49] time and we don't know how long that is
[1:45:52] but they're going to actually be there
[1:45:54] for a while
[1:45:56] but they that read
[1:45:58] are blessed
[1:46:00] I just think it's so beautiful because
[1:46:01] even if we don't read it even if we
[1:46:05] believe it but we don't read it and we
[1:46:07] just maybe we don't have that much
[1:46:09] strength maybe we're just busy in our
[1:46:11] lives maybe we're just fussed with our
[1:46:13] jobs and we've got all these pressures
[1:46:14] in our lives because we're busy people
[1:46:16] as long as you hear it you're still
[1:46:19] blessed
[1:46:20] you know I'm talking that way because
[1:46:22] I've been there I've done it I know what
[1:46:24] it's like to be so busy that I can't
[1:46:25] take the time out for God
[1:46:27] but that doesn't change the fact that
[1:46:29] you're still blessed
[1:46:31] as long as you hear it so if you're
[1:46:33] coming to church brothers and sisters
[1:46:34] you're hearing it there's a blessing in
[1:46:37] store
[1:46:40] you know
[1:46:43] talking about this scripture the
[1:46:45] Revelation or or apocalypse the
[1:46:48] revealing
[1:46:49] the unveiling
[1:46:51] the explanation of of the word of God
[1:46:57] what does it mean what does it really
[1:46:59] mean and I just think it's so beautiful
[1:47:01] it just goes back to a revelation is is
[1:47:04] an explanation it's an unveiling it's
[1:47:07] it's it's an exposing of of an idea or a
[1:47:10] thought right it's it's showing the idea
[1:47:13] or the thought and and Jesus to his
[1:47:16] disciples they said to Jesus Once Upon a
[1:47:19] Time what what might this mean
[1:47:21] talking about a parable
[1:47:23] and it's no wonder that Jesus wrote the
[1:47:26] Book of Revelation as a book of symbols
[1:47:29] is it because he didn't send his word
[1:47:31] for everyone
[1:47:33] he would that everyone would repent and
[1:47:35] be saved he would that everyone would
[1:47:37] prosper and be in good health but not
[1:47:39] everyone is given the ability to
[1:47:41] actually receive the word of God
[1:47:43] we know that Jacob he loved and he saw
[1:47:46] he hated but what did Esau do
[1:47:49] Esau didn't do anything according to the
[1:47:51] word of God Esau was the perfect child
[1:47:53] wasn't he
[1:47:55] he was always tending to the father's
[1:47:57] wish he was always doing what the father
[1:47:58] wanted Jacob was a troublemaker Jacob
[1:48:02] loved to bug his brothers and sisters he
[1:48:04] liked to poke fun at them all the time
[1:48:06] he liked to do things that were maybe
[1:48:08] just a little bit different a little bit
[1:48:09] uh off color for what maybe was right in
[1:48:13] the tradition of the family but God
[1:48:15] chose him over the one who was the the
[1:48:17] most well-behaved
[1:48:19] why is that
[1:48:21] it's God's choice it's election
[1:48:25] that's where I think it just becomes so
[1:48:26] incredibly humbling if we have the
[1:48:28] ability to receive this word if we
[1:48:29] really truly believe the message of the
[1:48:31] hour goodness sakes brothers and sisters
[1:48:33] we've got more than probably we could
[1:48:35] even comprehend we've got way more than
[1:48:38] we could comprehend and I think Lord
[1:48:40] help me because I don't even comprehend
[1:48:42] it but to know that we are given the
[1:48:44] ability to have eternal life
[1:48:47] I was having this other conversation
[1:48:49] with myself the other day
[1:48:52] what what are you going to be thinking
[1:48:53] about what are you going to be talking
[1:48:55] about brothers and sisters the moment
[1:48:57] the Rapture takes place where are you
[1:48:58] going to be
[1:48:59] what are you going to be experiencing
[1:49:01] who are you going to be talking to
[1:49:03] just like I've been thinking many times
[1:49:05] about you know how how certain people
[1:49:07] are where they're at I was fishing with
[1:49:10] my fishing buddy brother Larry Halverson
[1:49:12] a week ago and and he asked me to take
[1:49:14] his mother's funeral and I was so
[1:49:16] humbled by that I was just a new pastor
[1:49:19] and I went out to inform here and I did
[1:49:21] that for him it was such an honor and a
[1:49:23] privilege but we got talking about his
[1:49:25] mother and and he said how much of an
[1:49:27] honor it was to have me there and I
[1:49:28] thought my goodness how many other
[1:49:30] ministers would there be that would be
[1:49:31] real ministers to do that but he chose
[1:49:34] me
[1:49:35] his family did and I just thought it was
[1:49:37] so humbling and so we had a bit of a
[1:49:38] conversation you know I was just
[1:49:39] thinking brother Larry who's your mama
[1:49:41] talking to right now and what's she
[1:49:43] saying
[1:49:45] go catch that other fish keep going
[1:49:47] don't give up keep pressing on the same
[1:49:50] words the prophet of God heard you know
[1:49:52] but where are you going to be you
[1:49:55] what are you going to be doing
[1:49:57] when that happens because there's going
[1:49:59] to be a secret sudden going away of the
[1:50:02] Bride of Jesus Christ it's going to
[1:50:03] happen any day Nobody Knows the day or
[1:50:06] the hour many people have poked at it
[1:50:08] and prodded at it and tried to
[1:50:10] mathematically understand it and explain
[1:50:12] it and reveal it but we know that no man
[1:50:15] knows a day or the hour not even the
[1:50:17] angels in heaven not even the son Jesus
[1:50:20] Christ
[1:50:21] but the father himself he knows the time
[1:50:24] Hallelujah
[1:50:25] you know it takes a revelation to really
[1:50:28] understand the word of God the only way
[1:50:30] we can understand the word of God is
[1:50:31] through Revelation and that's through
[1:50:33] God's spirit making it known unto us and
[1:50:37] that's why brothers and sisters I'll say
[1:50:38] it today this will be my plug for it get
[1:50:40] the Holy Ghost
[1:50:41] get the Holy Ghost in your life if you
[1:50:43] don't have the Holy Ghost you're not
[1:50:44] going to understand the word of God we
[1:50:46] will not truly get the understanding of
[1:50:49] the word of God outside of him revealing
[1:50:51] it to us individually but when he does
[1:50:54] that we'll have the ability to say Amen
[1:50:56] to the word because we'll get the fact
[1:50:58] that there's a blessing in store every
[1:51:00] time we hear the word of God spoken
[1:51:02] there's a blessing there but in Luke
[1:51:04] chapter 8 verse 5 brother or Jesus he
[1:51:07] says A sower went out to sow his seed
[1:51:09] maybe turn there with me to Luke chapter
[1:51:11] eight sorry I get excited and ahead of
[1:51:12] myself Luke chapter 8 verse 5.
[1:51:20] we'll just talk a little bit about
[1:51:21] Revelation here
[1:51:23] I think Branham says in the church age
[1:51:25] book the exposition
[1:51:28] of the seven Church ages
[1:51:30] that Revelation means more to the
[1:51:32] believer than we think
[1:51:35] revelation
[1:51:37] to the believer it means a lot more than
[1:51:40] we can actually realize
[1:51:43] here we have Jesus saying to his
[1:51:45] disciples A sower went out this is verse
[1:51:47] 5 of Luke chapter 8 to sow his seed and
[1:51:50] as he sowed some fell by the wayside and
[1:51:52] it was trodden down and the fowls of the
[1:51:54] air devoured it and some fell upon a
[1:51:56] rock as soon as it was sprung up it
[1:51:58] withered away because it lacked moisture
[1:52:00] and some fell among thorns and the
[1:52:03] Thorns sprang up with it choked it and
[1:52:05] the other fell on good ground and sprang
[1:52:07] up and bear fruit on hundredfold
[1:52:10] and when he had said these things he
[1:52:12] cried he that hath ears to hear Let Him
[1:52:15] hear
[1:52:17] I just want to stop there for a second
[1:52:18] and just explain this we all know it but
[1:52:21] for those who don't when we hear about
[1:52:24] the seven churches
[1:52:27] we know that there is actually a
[1:52:29] description John has given the
[1:52:31] invitation to make an explanation to the
[1:52:33] seven churches which are in Asia at the
[1:52:37] ending of each one of those exhortations
[1:52:39] for the churches the same words are said
[1:52:42] he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:52:47] have you ever heard his voice before
[1:52:50] if you have you'll know what I mean when
[1:52:53] you can hear his voice yourself I'm not
[1:52:55] saying an audio voice booming in the
[1:52:57] airwaves coming to you but it's inside
[1:52:59] the heart when you've heard his voice
[1:53:01] before you'll recognize it because he
[1:53:04] doesn't change
[1:53:05] and isn't it interesting that he would
[1:53:07] have the same words that he spoke to his
[1:53:09] disciples and Luke
[1:53:11] that he spoke to John on the Isle of
[1:53:14] Patmos
[1:53:15] the same voice
[1:53:17] the same words
[1:53:19] he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:53:22] verse 9 says and his disciples asked him
[1:53:24] saying what might this Parable be and he
[1:53:26] said unto you it is given to know the
[1:53:28] mysteries of the kingdom of God
[1:53:31] but to others in parables
[1:53:33] that seeing they might not see and
[1:53:36] hearing they might not understand
[1:53:40] how could we have the ability to
[1:53:42] understand because God chose you
[1:53:45] he chose you to believe he chose you to
[1:53:48] be triumphant over Satan
[1:53:50] not because of Any works that you've
[1:53:52] done not because of Any display you
[1:53:54] could display not because of any words
[1:53:56] you could speak just because you could
[1:53:58] say Amen to the word of God you believe
[1:54:00] the word of God that's what does it for
[1:54:02] you and when you believe the word of God
[1:54:04] then you'll line up with the word of God
[1:54:05] you won't just say that I believe the
[1:54:07] word of God and go and live another life
[1:54:09] that's impossible
[1:54:11] let's turn over to Matthew chapter 13.
[1:54:13] while we're at it
[1:54:16] well we've got some scriptures here I
[1:54:19] think there's some real important
[1:54:21] points that I just want to bring out
[1:54:23] with this talking about revelation
[1:54:25] same story
[1:54:27] different perspective a different man's
[1:54:30] view of it
[1:54:31] we'll start with verse 1 of Matthew
[1:54:33] chapter 13.
[1:54:42] the same day Jesus went out of the house
[1:54:45] and sat by the seaside
[1:54:47] and great multitudes were gathered
[1:54:48] together unto him so that he went into a
[1:54:52] ship and sat and the whole multitude
[1:54:54] stood on the shore
[1:54:56] and he spake many things unto them in
[1:54:59] Parables saying behold A sower went
[1:55:02] forth to sow
[1:55:03] and when he sowed
[1:55:05] some seeds fell by the wayside and the
[1:55:08] fowls came and devoured them up
[1:55:10] some fell upon Stony places where they
[1:55:12] had not much Earth and forth with they
[1:55:15] sprung up because they had no deepness
[1:55:18] of Earth
[1:55:19] and when the sun was up they were
[1:55:21] scorched and because they had no root
[1:55:23] they withered away
[1:55:25] and some fell among thorns and the
[1:55:27] Thorns sprung up and choked them out but
[1:55:30] other fell into good ground and brought
[1:55:32] forth fruit some hundredfold and 60-fold
[1:55:34] some 30-fold
[1:55:36] who hath ears to hear
[1:55:38] let him hear
[1:55:40] we know the word of God goes on to
[1:55:42] explain this and Lord willing we'll get
[1:55:44] into that a little bit this morning but
[1:55:46] I just think it's wonderful when we look
[1:55:47] at this how we could say
[1:55:50] that we would fit that description in
[1:55:52] verse 8 but other fell into good ground
[1:55:54] the seed that the sower was sowing fell
[1:55:58] into good ground
[1:56:01] and what happened
[1:56:04] it brought forth fruit
[1:56:05] some 100 fold some 60 fold some 30-fold
[1:56:08] and some might even be one-fold
[1:56:11] but so long as you brought forth fruit
[1:56:13] so long as you actually were able to
[1:56:15] spring up and have life because there's
[1:56:17] a description in here just before that
[1:56:19] about how some seeds were sown in
[1:56:21] different places and you know some were
[1:56:23] on Stony ground and those seeds were
[1:56:25] there and they still were able to spring
[1:56:27] up but what happened once they sprung up
[1:56:29] brother Branham talks about the message
[1:56:31] of the hour in different places someone
[1:56:33] came and stepped on their toes said
[1:56:36] something that was offensive to them oh
[1:56:37] my they said that to me first I thought
[1:56:40] I was amongst Angels now I think I'm
[1:56:42] amongst Devils I can't go to church
[1:56:43] anymore because this happened
[1:56:46] you know brother Ken used to say it
[1:56:47] often any excuse is good enough when you
[1:56:49] really don't want to do something but
[1:56:51] what happens is people don't have the
[1:56:54] ability sometimes to have a root that
[1:56:56] actually goes down into good ground
[1:57:00] aren't you thankful for someone that
[1:57:02] would give the description that when the
[1:57:03] roots can go down into the ground the
[1:57:05] wind blows and causes the tree to sway
[1:57:08] to bend back and forth and the reason
[1:57:10] for that brothers and sisters so that
[1:57:12] those roots holding it into the ground
[1:57:13] they stretch and hold and oh they
[1:57:16] struggle sometimes they can't hold on
[1:57:18] and the whole tree will fall over but
[1:57:19] the ones that don't fall over those
[1:57:21] roots stretch and they caused holes
[1:57:24] looseness in the soil and what happens
[1:57:26] is those roots grow deeper and deeper
[1:57:28] and deeper it doesn't stop the winds
[1:57:30] from blowing
[1:57:33] but those trees they're in good ground
[1:57:34] and I want to say today if you have the
[1:57:37] ability to stay holding on You've Got
[1:57:39] Roots in the ground brothers and sisters
[1:57:41] you got reason to Rejoice we have every
[1:57:43] reason to just rejoice and thank God for
[1:57:46] the ability to have those roots that
[1:57:48] haven't just been been popped out and
[1:57:50] and so shallow that there's no
[1:57:52] experience to hold you there and as soon
[1:57:54] as the sun s-o-n of the word of God
[1:57:57] comes on the scene it doesn't cause us
[1:57:59] to wither up and die
[1:58:03] the preacher gives a spanking from the
[1:58:04] pulpit
[1:58:05] spiritually speaking we don't get all
[1:58:07] offended and upset and say oh I can't go
[1:58:09] back to see that brother he just always
[1:58:11] talks about this one thing a certain way
[1:58:13] I just can't do that no we say you know
[1:58:15] what Lord have mercy maybe that brother
[1:58:18] needs to have his own Revelation maybe
[1:58:20] his roots need to grow a little deeper
[1:58:21] we have the ability to pray for one
[1:58:23] another
[1:58:25] not get upset
[1:58:28] but let's go on to read here verse 10 of
[1:58:31] of Matthew chapter 13.
[1:58:34] remember Jesus said in verse 9 he who
[1:58:37] hath ears to hear Let Him hear the same
[1:58:39] one that we just read about over in Luke
[1:58:41] the same one that we know is in the Book
[1:58:43] of Revelation he that hath ears to hear
[1:58:46] Let Him hear and the disciples came and
[1:58:48] said unto him why speak as though unto
[1:58:50] them in parables and what does he say
[1:58:54] verse 11 he answered and said unto them
[1:58:56] because it's given unto you to know the
[1:59:00] mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:59:02] but to them it's not given
[1:59:05] so I think we could just pause there and
[1:59:07] we will and and I just want to take some
[1:59:09] time with this so you know I'm not going
[1:59:11] to keep us here long I can see time is
[1:59:13] running out but brothers and sisters we
[1:59:15] can read this verse here by Revelation
[1:59:18] because it's given unto you to know the
[1:59:20] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[1:59:23] to them it's not given someone is going
[1:59:26] to be given the ability to understand
[1:59:28] the mysteries of Heaven the Kingdom of
[1:59:31] Heaven not everyone is going to be able
[1:59:34] to understand it and that's okay that's
[1:59:36] God's choice
[1:59:38] I want to say it this way from a
[1:59:39] believer's perspective we have the
[1:59:41] ability to potentially potentially
[1:59:43] impart eternal life to those people who
[1:59:46] haven't been given the ability to
[1:59:47] understand it not the ability to judge
[1:59:50] them and say oh you deserve Eternal
[1:59:52] condemnation or or damnation we know
[1:59:55] brother Bradham said it and I believe
[1:59:57] it's the spirit of Christ very clearly
[1:59:58] we wouldn't wish it on our worst enemy
[2:00:01] what's on the other side
[2:00:04] that's why I think when we come to
[2:00:05] church brothers and sisters we've got
[2:00:07] the every reason to Rejoice this is the
[2:00:09] place where we can literally make the
[2:00:11] window blinds rattle from the worship
[2:00:13] that we've got here because we
[2:00:14] understand what it means to be Believers
[2:00:16] we understand what it means to be
[2:00:18] redeemed now some people would say oh I
[2:00:20] don't have the ability to worship that
[2:00:22] way and that's okay you don't if you
[2:00:24] don't have that ability to worship that
[2:00:25] way that's just fine but don't judge
[2:00:27] those that do just like those that do
[2:00:29] don't judge those that don't but if it
[2:00:31] gets a little bit loud in here brothers
[2:00:33] and sisters this is the quietest place
[2:00:35] we're ever going to be
[2:00:37] in the church age book the one that
[2:00:39] we're talking about here brother Branham
[2:00:40] he says we have every reason to get loud
[2:00:44] every reason to Rejoice the whole entire
[2:00:47] world can jump up and down at their ball
[2:00:49] games you ever go to a game a hockey
[2:00:51] game a football game you ever go to one
[2:00:53] of those
[2:00:54] they'll be sitting there and they'll be
[2:00:56] watching the play and it'll just be
[2:00:58] happening but all of a sudden they'll
[2:00:59] jump up and they'll start screaming and
[2:01:01] yelling because the stupid piece of
[2:01:03] rubber is getting
[2:01:05] broken away down the ice and gonna be in
[2:01:08] a net are you kidding me
[2:01:10] have you ever seen people express it
[2:01:12] that way there's a touchdown made in
[2:01:14] football people get right excited over
[2:01:16] sports but what about the word of God
[2:01:19] what about the Mysteries being revealed
[2:01:22] to you
[2:01:26] it's not given to everyone to know the
[2:01:28] mystery
[2:01:30] but when we've been given the ability to
[2:01:31] understand the mystery of the Kingdom of
[2:01:33] Heaven
[2:01:34] Heaven Christ is the mystery of God
[2:01:36] revealed wow
[2:01:38] maybe it's just simply this today
[2:01:40] brothers and sisters let's not take it
[2:01:41] for granted
[2:01:42] let's not take for granted this
[2:01:44] tremendous gift that we've been given
[2:01:47] let's go on to read here
[2:01:49] verse 12.
[2:01:51] it says for whosoever hath
[2:01:54] to him shall be given
[2:01:56] and he shall have more abundance
[2:01:59] but whosoever shall have not from him
[2:02:01] shall be taken away even that he hath
[2:02:05] I just want to say it's not money
[2:02:07] I'm not talking about money here some
[2:02:10] people will try and monetize this and
[2:02:11] you can sure God will bless you for sure
[2:02:14] and he'll give you more but if it's as
[2:02:16] shallow as money I I don't know I think
[2:02:19] we should have a prayer meeting
[2:02:21] verse 13 says therefore speak I to them
[2:02:24] in Parables because they seeing see not
[2:02:29] and hearing they hear not neither do
[2:02:32] they understand
[2:02:33] they can see the word of God standing
[2:02:36] there right before them they can hear
[2:02:38] his voice speaking he that hath an ear
[2:02:41] let them hear what the spirit saith unto
[2:02:43] the church but they don't have the
[2:02:45] ability to hear it
[2:02:47] because they're not hearing with their
[2:02:48] ears he's talking about hearing with
[2:02:51] your heart
[2:02:53] therefore speak I to them in Parables
[2:02:55] because seeing they see not hearing they
[2:02:57] hear not neither do they understand and
[2:02:59] in them it's fulfilled the prophecy of
[2:03:01] isaiahs which saith by hearing ye shall
[2:03:03] hear and shall not understand and seeing
[2:03:07] ye shall see and not perceive for this
[2:03:09] people's heart is wax gross and their
[2:03:12] ears are dull of hearing and their eyes
[2:03:14] they have closed
[2:03:17] that just jumped out at me today when I
[2:03:20] was studying this real early today their
[2:03:21] eyes they have closed so they can't hear
[2:03:24] it they can't see it but they see it and
[2:03:27] and they hear it but they can't
[2:03:29] understand it so what do they do they
[2:03:31] close their eyes they don't want
[2:03:32] anything to do with it Lord have mercy
[2:03:35] lest at any time they should see with
[2:03:37] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[2:03:39] should understand with their heart and
[2:03:41] should be converted and I should heal
[2:03:43] them
[2:03:48] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[2:03:52] and your ears for they hear
[2:03:55] for verily I say unto you that many
[2:03:58] prophets and righteous men have desired
[2:04:00] to see those things which ye see
[2:04:04] and have not seen them we know that John
[2:04:06] he wanted to see a little further
[2:04:10] and and and talk about the mysteries of
[2:04:12] what was spoken in the Thunders
[2:04:16] but he was told you know what seal up
[2:04:18] those things John
[2:04:19] and and write them not because they're
[2:04:22] not for your day they're not for your
[2:04:23] time
[2:04:25] but there is a time and there is a day
[2:04:27] and there is a people that will have the
[2:04:29] ability to receive what was
[2:04:31] hidden what was sealed up in those
[2:04:33] Thunders and I want to say it today
[2:04:35] brothers and sisters that's you
[2:04:38] that's us
[2:04:39] that's our day we've been given the
[2:04:41] ability to understand those Thunders and
[2:04:44] Lord willing we'll get into them in time
[2:04:47] but you know here we have Jesus
[2:04:49] instructing them that these people's
[2:04:52] heart is waxed gross
[2:04:54] boy oh boy we can look around this world
[2:04:56] and say that this world's heart is wax
[2:04:58] gross
[2:05:00] we're rich and we're increased with
[2:05:02] goods and we have need of nothing we
[2:05:04] don't have the need to go to church why
[2:05:06] would you go to church on a Sunday I
[2:05:08] remember living in that world anybody
[2:05:10] else here remember that in their lives
[2:05:12] why would you go to church on a Sunday I
[2:05:14] remember in Calgary when I was a kid
[2:05:16] everything was closed on a Sunday there
[2:05:18] might be a gas station open in case you
[2:05:20] had an emergency and you needed some gas
[2:05:23] but everything was closed how much has
[2:05:25] this world changed everything is open on
[2:05:28] a Sunday now even more stuff sometimes
[2:05:32] it's the world we live in this this
[2:05:34] people's heart is wax gross and their
[2:05:36] ears are dull of here and they don't
[2:05:37] want to hear Christianity you know what
[2:05:39] maybe the Christian church at best maybe
[2:05:42] Catholic Behavior at best but when you
[2:05:45] start to talk about Mysteries and and
[2:05:47] Prophets and the message of the hour
[2:05:48] their hearts of wax gross their ears are
[2:05:51] dull of hearing and their eyes they've
[2:05:52] closed don't talk to me about a prophet
[2:05:54] oh my that's crazy talk why would you be
[2:05:57] doing that
[2:05:58] because that's where the truth lies
[2:06:00] that's why I'd be doing it that's why we
[2:06:02] do it that's why we talk about it is
[2:06:04] because that's the truth for our day
[2:06:07] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[2:06:09] in your ears for they hear for verily I
[2:06:11] say unto you that many prophets and
[2:06:13] righteous men have desired to see the
[2:06:15] things which ye see and have not seen
[2:06:17] them and to hear the things which ye
[2:06:19] hear
[2:06:20] have not heard them
[2:06:22] and he goes on to say here ye therefore
[2:06:24] the parable of the sower now I'm going
[2:06:26] to explain it to you
[2:06:28] when anyone heareth the word of the
[2:06:30] kingdom and understandeth it not then
[2:06:33] cometh the wicked one and catcheth away
[2:06:36] that which was sown in his heart
[2:06:38] this is he which receive a seed by the
[2:06:41] wayside
[2:06:42] they hear the message of the hour and
[2:06:44] they think oh William Miriam Branham
[2:06:46] interesting man but you know there's a
[2:06:48] lot of interesting men in this world
[2:06:49] God's used a lot of men in this world
[2:06:51] and and the days of of Prophecy prophets
[2:06:55] that was over in the apostolic age with
[2:06:57] the disciples there's no such thing as
[2:06:59] that you know what he says it right here
[2:07:02] we go out to verse 20 but he that
[2:07:05] received the seed into Stony places the
[2:07:07] same as he that heareth the word and
[2:07:10] Anon with joy receive it oh just love it
[2:07:13] it's wonderful to hear the message of
[2:07:15] the hour
[2:07:16] goes on to say yet he yet hath he no
[2:07:20] root in himself but Dura for a while
[2:07:24] for when tribulation or persecution
[2:07:25] ariseth because of the word
[2:07:28] by and by he's offended
[2:07:31] something trips him up he just can't do
[2:07:33] it nope can't go on anymore that brother
[2:07:36] said that thing that brother didn't say
[2:07:37] that thing maybe somebody else did
[2:07:40] another thing and we said it earlier any
[2:07:43] excuse is good enough when you don't
[2:07:44] want to do it
[2:07:47] yet he hath no root in himself but
[2:07:50] dearth for a while
[2:07:51] for when tribulation or persecution
[2:07:53] ariseth because of the word by and by He
[2:07:57] Is offended
[2:07:59] he also that received seed among the
[2:08:02] Thorns as he that heareth the word
[2:08:06] and the care of this world
[2:08:09] and the deceitfulness of riches
[2:08:12] choke the word
[2:08:14] and he becometh unfruitful
[2:08:18] I just want to say I hope nobody is
[2:08:21] becoming unfruitful
[2:08:22] because of riches
[2:08:27] riches are fine
[2:08:29] God will bless us but we need to be
[2:08:31] careful that we're not actually deceived
[2:08:34] by the riches because we can get so many
[2:08:37] riches and so busy with all of our
[2:08:39] riches managing all of our riches that
[2:08:41] it will choke out the word of God it'll
[2:08:43] cause us to not be able to come to
[2:08:44] church it'll cause us to be so busy that
[2:08:47] we can't take time in prayer we'll be so
[2:08:49] fussed with the riches in this world
[2:08:51] that we will choke out the word of God
[2:08:53] in our lives
[2:08:54] but I want to say I'm believed that I'm
[2:08:56] talking to Believers here and verse 23
[2:08:59] says but he that received seed into the
[2:09:02] good ground is he that heareth my word
[2:09:04] and understandeth it which also beareth
[2:09:07] fruit and bringeth forth some 100-fold
[2:09:09] and another some 60 and some 30. I just
[2:09:14] think this is so beautiful brother and
[2:09:16] sisters because there's some people that
[2:09:18] will not be able to receive the word but
[2:09:20] some people are able to receive the word
[2:09:22] and if we're able to receive the word in
[2:09:25] our day the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:09:27] then we have every single reason to
[2:09:29] Rejoice every single reason to give God
[2:09:32] praise every single reason to serve him
[2:09:34] with all of our heart because we
[2:09:36] recognize that we're already seated in
[2:09:38] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus maybe we
[2:09:40] don't feel like it has anybody ever felt
[2:09:42] like you're sitting in Heavenly places
[2:09:44] maybe sometimes when we come to church
[2:09:46] and we have a great service but when I
[2:09:48] go and sit in my truck and start driving
[2:09:50] no I don't feel like I'm seeing heavily
[2:09:52] places I look around and I see road rage
[2:09:54] I look around and I see wickedness
[2:09:56] pictures and things that I just would
[2:09:59] rather not see it's the world we live in
[2:10:02] but the word of God says that I'm
[2:10:03] already seated in Heavenly places and I
[2:10:05] choose to believe that over top of every
[2:10:07] single thing that I see with my eyes or
[2:10:09] here with my ears
[2:10:12] because it's the word of God that makes
[2:10:13] all the difference
[2:10:16] remember we were talking about this I'll
[2:10:19] touch on this as we call the musicians
[2:10:20] you know what who whosoever sends ye
[2:10:23] remit they are remitted unto them
[2:10:25] we have been given a responsibility in
[2:10:27] our day as the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[2:10:30] have the ability to go to the father on
[2:10:33] behalf of our brother on behalf of our
[2:10:35] sister and the word of God says that
[2:10:37] whosoever sins ye remit they are
[2:10:38] remitted unto them and whosoever sins
[2:10:40] you retain they are retained we said
[2:10:43] this before I just want to say it again
[2:10:44] where are they retained brothers and
[2:10:45] sisters it might be easy to say that
[2:10:47] they're retained up in heaven but I
[2:10:49] personally my view is that we are
[2:10:51] retaining we are holding on to those
[2:10:53] sins and I don't think we want to do
[2:10:55] that
[2:10:56] you know over in Proverbs 26 if you want
[2:10:59] to turn over there quickly with me I
[2:11:01] just think it's beautiful how the Lord
[2:11:02] does this
[2:11:04] um I often wondered how would I ever
[2:11:06] have enough enough to say in in an hour
[2:11:08] an hour and a half and there's never
[2:11:10] enough time and I just want to be
[2:11:12] respectful you know I I don't want to
[2:11:14] try and keep us long
[2:11:17] but in Proverbs 26 verse 9
[2:11:21] talking about parables this really
[2:11:24] caught my attention today
[2:11:26] as a thorn the Proverbs 26 verse 9 is a
[2:11:29] pro as a thorn goeth up into the hand of
[2:11:33] a drunkard
[2:11:35] so is a parable in the mouth of fools
[2:11:39] now I don't know if anybody here has
[2:11:41] ever been drunk and I'm not looking for
[2:11:42] a show of hands
[2:11:45] but unfortunately I can say to you that
[2:11:47] I've experienced this very thing
[2:11:50] and you know when it happens you don't
[2:11:51] feel it
[2:11:53] you don't
[2:11:54] you hear about people that fall down
[2:11:56] in the winter time
[2:11:58] when they're drinking they usually don't
[2:12:00] get hurt
[2:12:01] people who are drinking who are in
[2:12:03] severe car accidents usually don't get
[2:12:05] hurt
[2:12:06] not nearly as bad as the people who
[2:12:08] weren't expecting things to happen the
[2:12:10] people who actually weren't drinking
[2:12:12] they actually really feel the effects
[2:12:14] really painfully but unfortunately with
[2:12:17] a fool someone who is drunk they don't
[2:12:20] feel it until afterwards until the
[2:12:22] alcohol wears off
[2:12:24] and then suddenly their thorn in their
[2:12:26] flesh in their hand where they fell
[2:12:28] they're thinking my goodness what is
[2:12:30] that why do I feel that there oh no but
[2:12:33] if they weren't drinking they wouldn't
[2:12:34] have fallen and that thorn wouldn't have
[2:12:35] went in
[2:12:37] and if you don't ever if you've never
[2:12:39] experienced this God bless you but I
[2:12:40] want to just take a moment to explain it
[2:12:43] a parable
[2:12:45] of the word of God in the mouth of a
[2:12:47] fool is just like that
[2:12:49] because they don't even understand what
[2:12:51] happened to them it just happened so
[2:12:53] fast the parable is just in one ear or
[2:12:55] not the other well you know maybe we
[2:12:57] just went and had a good church service
[2:12:58] and that's it you know what we don't
[2:13:00] want to be fools with the word of God
[2:13:03] verse 10 says the great God that formed
[2:13:06] all things both rewardeth the fool and
[2:13:09] rewardeth the transgressors as a dog
[2:13:12] returneth to his vomit so a fool
[2:13:15] returneth to his folly
[2:13:21] it's amazing because if we look at this
[2:13:24] we can just keep on doing the same thing
[2:13:26] over and over again
[2:13:28] and and if you go on and you read down
[2:13:30] in this verse in this chapter it talks
[2:13:33] about a fool being like the hinge of a
[2:13:35] door
[2:13:36] and how the fool How could a fool be
[2:13:38] like the hinge of a door I really
[2:13:40] wondered about this I started to think
[2:13:42] about it I see what a door does if you
[2:13:43] ever wonder go look at a door and see
[2:13:45] what it does it only goes one way and
[2:13:48] the other way and one way and the other
[2:13:50] way and one way and the other way that's
[2:13:52] all a door does
[2:13:54] and sometimes it slabs but it only does
[2:13:56] the same thing over and over and over
[2:13:59] and over and sometimes it just gets
[2:14:01] squeaky when it does it
[2:14:03] and you know what that's what the word
[2:14:04] of God says a fool is like it just keeps
[2:14:07] doing the same thing over and over and
[2:14:09] over and over there's no correction
[2:14:11] there's no ability to change their ways
[2:14:14] but Sons and Daughters of God we've got
[2:14:16] the ability to change our ways
[2:14:18] verse 12 of Proverbs chapter 26 maybe
[2:14:23] stand with me as we close it says see us
[2:14:26] thou a man wise in his own conceit
[2:14:30] says there's more hope of a fool than of
[2:14:34] him
[2:14:36] that's where I say brothers and sisters
[2:14:38] we have no conceit
[2:14:41] the only conceit that we've got is that
[2:14:43] God chose us from before the foundation
[2:14:45] of the world to be able to believe his
[2:14:46] word to recognize Revelations chapter 1
[2:14:48] verse 1 says
[2:14:50] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:14:52] and that doesn't mean the revelation of
[2:14:55] Jesus Christ some far way off place out
[2:14:57] there that means me myself going to the
[2:15:00] Isle of Patmos and recognizing the
[2:15:02] revelation of Jesus Christ to me
[2:15:04] personally that's what that means
[2:15:07] we don't have conceit except for Jesus
[2:15:09] Christ in our lives and what he's done
[2:15:12] for us I have more but I'll just pause
[2:15:14] there remember the communion service
[2:15:16] tonight brothers and sisters the
[2:15:18] revelation of Jesus Christ really is
[2:15:21] what separates us from anybody else and
[2:15:24] that doesn't make us better people it
[2:15:25] makes us humble people it makes us
[2:15:27] recognize that we had no way no ability
[2:15:29] on our own to ever be able to recognize
[2:15:32] our position it's just what he's done
[2:15:34] for us entirely God bless you this
[2:15:36] morning
[2:15:37] let's just bow Heavenly Father we're so
[2:15:40] thankful for your word we're so thankful
[2:15:43] Lord that you've given us the ability to
[2:15:46] take that seed father that you have
[2:15:48] placed inside of us Lord and and not
[2:15:50] just to go and find a good ground but to
[2:15:52] recognize that we are that good ground
[2:15:55] and father as your word comes forward
[2:15:57] and we hear your word it's your spirit
[2:16:00] that Waters that seed and causes that
[2:16:03] seed to crack open in the heart of your
[2:16:05] children and come to life and father as
[2:16:08] that seed comes to life it causes us to
[2:16:10] to change our lives Lord it causes us to
