Description:
Songwriter: Paul LaFontaine

Let Your Word be born
In the manger of my heart
Let It live in me,
Let it start.
Live inside this house of clay,
And mold me everyday.
Let Your Word be born,
In the manger of my heart.

Well outwardly I'm nothing,
Not much to behold,
Unlikely the place for His Word to unfold.
But if I'll just yield this vessel,
And let Him have His way,
From glory unto glory
He'll change me day by day.
