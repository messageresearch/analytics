rest of this service into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight thank you musicians do you have your Bibles i' just like to read a couple of scriptures uh Revelations 2: 8- 11 as we continue our study with the exposition of the seven Church ages the Church age and then I'd like to turn over to First John chap 3 and I'll apologize in advance I'm probably going to have a lot of coughs here tonight but it's just the devil trying to get in the way and the more he tries the more we're GNA push excuse me Revelations chapter 2 verse 8 sman Church age and unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive I Know Thy works and thy tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of them them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and ye may have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death tremendous tremendous scripture now if you turn over to 1 John chapter 3 I don't know if we'll get this far tonight in the book Lord willing we will but I want to read the next few paragraphs uh probably towards the latter part of the service with this scripture in mind 1 John chapter 3 verse one it says behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon who that we should be called the sons of God Amen therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not verse two is just enough goodness beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father tonight Lord I pray that you would just break this scripture open to us father Lord not through theological teaching but through Revelation by your spirit Lord Jesus father that when we leave this building tonight perhaps we could look at one another we could look at ourselves even father and begin to see you Lord we love you and we thank you we just Commit This service in its entirety into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated is that brother Callahan there at the back God bless you brother I had the honor of meeting you I think about 10 years ago at brother Paul and sister Elaine's house it's good to see you again brother I'll shake your hand after service just a couple of announcements before we get going tonight we have the men's recast at our house uh Saturday at 10:00 a.m. we got the youth service this Sunday after service at the Clon residence um on the 26th we have a communion service at 5:30 p.m. I was looking at the calendar and it is filling up um my goodness Sunday June the 2nd we've got brother Del adelon he's a pastor here from Nigeria and uh he may be here the following Wednesday as well we'll see how the Lord leads um we have brother Mario Chua he'll be here June the 9th and that will be a Sunday and uh you know I just think that we're overdue we're going to have a worship service June 23rd at 6: p.m. so if you want to come and just Worship the Lord by all means come on out we're going to get into the the study of worship in the near future Lord willing and uh you know what we've got every single reason to Shout to the Lord every single reason and uh so anyways we're going to do that Lord willing on June 23rd we've got brother Cadre Diggs coming June 26th on the Wednesday I love it we've got brother Jack Duff coming Wednesday July the 12th and uh you know we'll just see what the Lord will do I know uh some folks maybe don't like it or get a little uneasy when there's too much Ministry coming through but you know when we're preaching the word for our day I think it's a real encouragement right God gave us a five-fold Ministry and that five-fold Ministry is what's supposed to perfect the Saints that's how God is going to create a Rapture in the people it's not going to be one Ministry and it's not going to be one tradition or one teaching or one Theory it's just going to be the the way God has out outlined so um I do believe though just for the record so in case anybody's wondering I'm going to pump the brakes if somebody else calls and says they are going to be in town I'm going to say common Fellowship but I think we're full we're not going to be having another Minister um now best laid plans right we'll see and we haven't talked about July July is already booking up in I think there's going to be a real good month in there we've got a real good old friend coming in the middle of July and I'm real excited about that so uh we'll see what happens you know uh I just think it's beautiful where we're picking up is paragraph 145 in uh in the red book here the exposition of the seven Church age talking about the saman church age you know uh where we left off last week I'll just pick up this paragraph here brother bradam says now before we leave this subject I want to make myself very clear on what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is according to the word Now isn't that good we wouldn't want to have it according to any other thought any other Theory any other tradition we would only want it to be exactly according to the word wouldn't we it is not according to me and it's not according to you it's got to be according to thus sayith the Lord or we are falsely LED amen and we know that there's been many many false leaders that have gone out and tried to create a theory or an idea on what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is and I'm not even talking about denominations I'm just going to say around the message try to spin the message into a denominational teaching if you don't believe it the way we believe it then you're out that's not the spirit of Christ not at all it has to be thus saith the Lord and how is it thus sayith the lord it's exactly according to his word because we know that the prophet God in the prophet said that she has thus sayeth the Lord and the mind of Christ to know what to do with it and that's exactly in line with the word the word says let this mind that was in Christ be in who we don't have to fear paragraph 146 it says to begin with you will notice that in my meetings when I have finished preaching an Evangelistic service or some teaching message I cast The Net to invite a response from the people I ask them to come forward and receive the Holy Spirit my Pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that I am inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the Holy Ghost because they are already born again so when I invite those who are Spirit-filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear ones surge forward and deal with the people in such a manner as to encourage them to yield to God and believe to speak in tongues this has caused a great deal of confusion and I want to tell you exactly what I mean now let's put it in the second gear and drop the clutch I mean for The Sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost this is where it gets contentious for some because they want to have some kind of work some kind of ladder that they can climb some kind of Stairway or road map you can do and follow the leadership with prayers and and it's teaching of men teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men that's what that is this is what the prophet said this is what God Said through the prophet it is one and the same if we don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters I want to say this tonight we're not going to go in the Rapture that's the way it's going to work that's exactly according to the word of God without the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're not sealed but if we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost then we're sealed until the day of our Redemption paragraph 147 now I realize that this is going to be confusing for a moment here as most people know that I was ordained a Baptist preacher and I have steadfastly declared that Baptists have missed it for saying you received the Holy Ghost when you believe it's so treacherous because it's so close so close so close they've missed it for saying you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe for that is not so you receive him since you believe and just as usual once again we're going to go right back to the scripture to find the identification in that not just what brother brandham dreamt up not something that floated down out of Heaven some sort of teaching that he got out of a book somewhere from some other author this is the only author the only inspiration that drove this man and that's what captured my attention it just drew me in Acts 19: 2-6 and he said unto them have ye received the Holy Ghost since you believed not when you believed not because you believed since you believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto John's baptism then said Paul John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Jesus Christ when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they spake with tongues and prophesied excuse me note they did not get baptized in water yet but because they were baptized with the Holy Ghost they actually came in accordance with the word of God and were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ paragraph 148 he says there it is Paul asked have you received since not when you believed and there is a great difference there for it is after we believe that we receive Ephesians 1:13 is an exact word repeat of what happened in Ephesus according to Acts 19 Ephesians 1:13 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed not when ye believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise now here is my point too many of our modernists and even our fundamentalists so-called believe unto salvation at a certain specific time which in many cases is called making a decision and that has been called receiving Christ or being born again now to receive Christ is to receive his Spirit not just say I receive Christ and you know what the identification is you're going to go out and you're going to live the the word that's it's that simple we're going to say I'm going to live the word and and if we were to say that on our own no one would ever do it and in fact that's what causes a great Falling Away amongst the young people let's be honest that's what they do they say I'm going to I'm going to accept Christ I'm going to make a stand for him and I'm going to go and live and and they know the scriptures because they've heard them at home but for some reason they can't go and live those scriptures and the only reason is there's no human that's going to live this scripture No human at all the only person the only way you could ever live this scripture is to let him live it through you and when he comes to town look out brothers and sisters that's when this flesh gets in line that's when we become subject to it that's when we can pray Lord you know what if you're going to preach tonight and you're going to take the hide office if you're going to bring correction to us then amen because I want to be corrected I don't want to be corrected according to what brother Barry would bring I don't want to be corrected Accord to what some other Theologian might try and bring I want to be corrected according to the word of God I want the word of God to reign supreme in my life and when that happens look out Satan doesn't know what to do with us so let's carry on here now here is my point he says too many of our modernists even our fundamentalists so-called believe on a Salvation at a certain specific time in which many cases it's called making a decision and that has been called receiving Christ or being born again now to receive Christ is to receive his Spirit to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen these folks believe that is wonderful but they stop there brothers and sisters don't stop keep going say Lord be it unto me if I need correction then correct me as a little child I want to be subject to your correction amen he says you receive the Holy Ghost after you believe it has always been that way and always will be the very first word of direction to the people was by Peter at Pentecost and he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promis is unto you and to your children and all that are AAR off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call acts 23839 these directions came as a direct answer from Peter relative to what had actually happened at Pentecost it's the same pattern the same direction it's nothing different what came to pass was that God according to Joel was SP pouring out the promised Holy Spirit upon All Flesh and it's so beautiful because that Spirit poured out on All Flesh causes All Flesh to manifest what life is inside of it he was not poured out before that time or given before that time that was it but this was to come from now on by repenting being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then God was Duty bound to fill the ones who came isn't it interesting that we can cause God to be Duty bound Hallelujah the only way that we can do that is by his word if we're willing to come according to his word then he's willing to say whoa they've actually pushed aside everything they' for Aken all and taken me this was it but this was to come from now on by repenting being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that God was Duty bound to fill the ones who came Peter or any of the Apostles never said he must be born again and then filled with the spirit that this is the pattern of experience relative to receiving the Holy Spirit note carefully the very next time that the Spirit fell upon the people excuse me then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them and the people with one Accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with a loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and and that were lame were healed and there was great joy in that City but there was a certain man called Simon which Before Time in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of God and to him they had regard because of that long time he had Bewitched them with sorceries but but when they believed Phillip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and in the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women it's beautiful it doesn't say they were baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost In The Name of Jesus Christ why wouldn't it say that why wouldn't it say titles there I wonder then Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with Phillip and wondered beholding the Miracles and signs which were done now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John who when they C were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus then they laid hands on them and they Reed received the Holy Ghost that's acts 85-1 17 according to verse 12 they believed the word they were then baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus but according to verse 16 in spite of all that they had still not received the Holy Spirit it was only after believing and being baptized correctly that they received the Holy Ghost that is the exact pattern set forth by Peter in Acts 23839 another scripture that cast a wondrous light on this is found in Galatians 3: 13- 14 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that in order that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith Now by no means can it be said the blessing of Abraham is the rebirth and that the promise of the spirit is the baptism with the Holy Ghost as two separate events I love this for the scripture reads thus Jesus died on the cross and by means of that death and Resurrection The Blessing of Abraham came on the Gentiles leaving the Jews this transpired in order that the spirit might become available to the Gentiles to understand what I have just said is to clear up Why students have never found Paul saying at any time be born again and then be spirit filled they have inferred it is there many times I think there's a lot of inferences around the word of God isn't there they have inferred it is there and they have put their own meanings to make it say it but scripture does not say that that's in capitals isn't it yeah scripture does not say that Jesus never said it either look at John 7:37 to39 and read it now with understanding in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and said If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow flow rivers of Living Water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified now it says here distinctly and emphatically that the believer upon drinking by coming unto Jesus in faith would have rivers of Living Waters pouring out of him and it places this experience at Pentecost now keep this thought in mind we read keep sorry now keeping this thought in mind we read in John four if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou would have asked him and he would have given thee living water but who so drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life isn't it interesting how brother bradam talks about the artisian in Wells and if you've ever seen one before it's just an amazing thing to witness how it just continually bubbles out of the ground it just bubbles bubbles bubbles and it's the sweetest cleanest water that you'll ever see paragraph 156 the same living water is mentioned but this time it is not called a river it's called an artisian well there is where the people make their mistake because it's called a well and a river they think that in one place it is eternal life given by the spirit and in the next place where it is called a river implying a great dynamism it has to be the spirit now given as an enduement of power not so it is one and the same it is the spirit that gives life and power and that came at Pentecost what is it that caused this misunderstanding the answer is experience amen this is so good and Rich Brothers and Sisters I think it's so important especially when it's weaved in and through the message of the hour because we can have prayers we can have situations where people have needs great needs in their lives and we pray for them and God answers those prayers every single time God answers prayers sometimes he doesn't answer the prayers the way we want them to be answered naturally speaking and that can cause great confusion because we're not experiencing according to the word of God maybe what we think we should because we believe but that doesn't change whether people believe or not and that's the evidence of having the Holy Ghost in our lives but we cannot base our experience in the word our experience with the Holy Ghost in our lives on whether we have experience or not the experience will follow brother Ram says what is it the cause the misunderstanding the the answer is experience we have gone by experience and not the word away with experience as your measuring line amen there is only one Plum line one rod and that is the word now watch carefully and get this Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Paul said have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed this is the whole of our problem right here people repent of their sins and they get baptized in water but they don't go on and and but they don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost you believe unto receiving the spirit believe on Jesus Believing on Jesus is the step in the right direction which is toward the Holy Ghost but the people stop there they go as far as water and then stop they believe and then stop the Bible does not say that you receive when you believe it is have received the Holy Ghost since you believed the exact and literal translation is did ye having previously believed received the Holy Ghost I love this I want to say Amen the people believe and then stop you don't receive the Holy Ghost when you believe unto him having repented you go on and receive the Holy Ghost do you see it that is what is wrong with our fundamentalists they have no power for they stop short of Pentecost now brothers and sisters this is where I think it gets real good and Rich and I saying I keep saying it I just can't help it but you know uh maybe on Sunday we'll bring some quotes that speak to this Pentecost is not a denomination we all would say Amen to that it's an experience now I want to say this how many people are not afraid to get Pentecostal because they've had an experience how many people are not afraid to grab the tambourine and go up and down the banks of the sea knowing that God has destroyed their enemy behind them the enemy has no more power over that person because they believed unto receiving and since they've received the Holy Ghost in their life there's nothing going to stop them doesn't matter what anybody says doesn't matter what anybody preaches they have a personal relationship with the king of kings and Lord of Lords brothers and sisters don't be afraid Pentecost is an experience and because you have an experience it doesn't mean that you are in a denomination in fact it's the other way when you get denominationally cold look out brother bradam says if you got no emotion in your religion you better bury it don't be afraid to shout amen blessed be the name of the Lord the devil's going to come around and say no don't stand up no you're going to stand out if you stand up don't do that no don't raise your hands no don't shout don't do it they're going to think you're crazy they're going to think you're a fundamentalist don't do that take a look at Pentecost the day of Pentecost they stumbled out of the building that they were hiding in because they were afraid like drunk people like drunks how many of us behave like drunks hey he's the same yesterday today and forever brothers and sisters he's not going to be different today than he was then we're different today we've been taught that we need to sit still we have to have church order but when God's speaking to us say amen and the more you say Amen the more he's going to speak this just gets me going this just gets me excited because it's the truth I I just believe it with all my heart brothers and sisters don't just go as far as water and stop keep going Amen brother he goes on to say oh I wonder if I'll have a voice at the end of this I just want to pour it out I just want to lose it whatever that's fine they'll give me something for Sunday they are like the children of Israel who came out of Egypt and stop short of the promised land oh no help us there's Giants over there yeah I can taste that honey it's so sweet but I'll never get to it because there's Giants there and and those pomegranates are so so sweet and so big and so juicy oh but the the Giants own those and the figs have you ever seen such good figs you could smell them blocks away those figs are so good but we can never do it but there was two there was two that were of another Spirit brothers and sisters and those two were the only ones and remember the ones that were SA and we can't do it we're the Valiant ones they were the teachers and the preachers of the bunch they were the ones that should have been saying it and it should have been the other two saying no I don't know it's a little bit weird maybe we won't be able to do it but there was only two that were able to say you know what it doesn't matter what we see with our eyes it doesn't matter what we hear with our ears doesn't matter what we feel with our feelings those those they're grasshoppers in our sight because we've got God with us they are like the children of Israel who came out of Egypt and stopped short of the promised land now those children of Israel left Egypt about two million strong they all journeyed together all saw same miracles of god all partook of the same mana and water from the smitten Rock and followed the same Cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night but were only two reached the promised land only two were true or real believers my goodness while I was studying this out I was thinking you know what was the difference between those two and and all the rest of them and we know it was the spirit but how did it manifest that's what I want to get to and you know what came to my mind immediately I believe it was the Lord speaking to me it was the murmurings murmur murmurings murmuring against God murmuring against Moses murmuring about the conditions murmuring murmuring murmuring problems issues blah blah blah blah blah murmurings are we murmuring brothers and and sisters because if we are it's the same spirit that was afflicting those people yes sir because if God's in control God's in control no if he's not in control even just a little bit he's not God the devil gets in our way he wants us to murmur he wants us to start murmuring and remember we're not murmuring about our brother and our sister and our pastor and our deacons and whatever we're not murmuring about them when we're murmuring we're murmuring about God we need to be very cautious that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief and because of unbelief they could not enter into Hebrews 3:19 then since that is so and only to entered then the rest were not true believers what made the difference two stayed with the word we're talking about this today on the phone and I thought it was so good people say oh you're just parting the prophet I say amen hallelujah if there's anything to say brothers and sisters say what the prophet said stay with what he said and actually apply that in our homes and our lives because that's what Joshua and Caleb did isn't it stayed with the word when the hearts of the 10 spies failed at kades barnea Joshua and Caleb did not stagger for they believed the word and said we are more than able to take the land they saw the same circumstances they saw the same Giants they saw all the pitfalls they saw all the problems and weapons but they were willing to take the word over top of the circumstances over top of the situations brothers and sisters look at the word keep your eyes on Jesus they knew that they could because God had said so I have given you the land after all those Israelites saw all the power and goodness and deliverance of God they did not enter into rest which is a type of Holy Ghost so you can see right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the spirit of God I think brothers and sisters if we have been able to receive the spirit of God I I really believe this with all my heart there should be no problem just worshiping God just I mean really worshiping God not caring about who's around not caring about what's happening after words I'm going to really go off on worship in the future here but I'm serious there should be nothing inhibiting us from worshiping him because we're coming to a day we've said it before where that's all we've got that's all we're going to do we're going to go worship God forever now the devil's going to say oh man that's going to be boring sitting on a cloud just worshiping God just going to church every single minute of every single day that's what the devil's going to teach us but you know what there was a time where the morning Stars sang together right and the sons of God they shouted for joy and I think as we get closer and closer those sons of God are beginning to manifest as we read tonight behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us brothers and sisters that we should be called what the sons of God oh my like Adam we should be called the same category as Adam was when he was created and placed in the garden remember what the prophet said remember God said to you the prophet all that Adam lost right has been restored for those people that have this spirit that we're talking about tonight I think it's so beautiful they knew that they could because God had said I have given you the land after all those Israelites saw the power and goodness and deliverance of God they did not enter into rest which is a type of the Holy Ghost so you can see right now that very few people will believe all the way to receiving of the spirit of God all right we have come this far now I want to go further so do I and when I do I know I'm going to cause some emotions to rise but but that is something I am not responsible for I am responsible to God and his word and the people of God has sent me to I have to be faithful in all he gives me to say John 637 and44 all the father hath given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I shall in no wise cast out no man can come unto me come to me except the father draw him and I will raise him up at the last day John 1:12 to13 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor of the will of man oh my but of God Ephesians 1 14 to 5 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love if that's the way we are brothers and sisters then what have we got to fear having destinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will beautiful now without getting too involved in the subject of sovereignty of God for that would take a book in itself let me point out here that according to these verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men chose their Brides today the bride today does not simply decide she's going to take a certain man for a husband no sir it is the groom whom decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you John 1516 now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself Ephesians 1:9 and in Romans 9911 it says the purpose that the purpose of God according to election might stand and you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God God is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God and he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind Hallelujah we sing that song when he was on the cross I was on his mind I want to say there's probably a whole bunch of unwise virgins that sing that song and that's as far back as they go because they can't go any further back but there's a bunch of people also that can say Amen to this to recognize that before the world ever was before there even was a speck of Stardust we were in his mind my he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not the Eternal thoughts of God now I just can't help but stop here for a second and just throw off a little bit on the devil did you ever think not not in terms of how powerful he is and how he's created coequal with God and how he was the the the morning the son H I'm going to say it wrong how he was there at the right hand of God in God's glory how even has access to the throne right now to accuse the Brethren this one Satan who every one of us are going to look upon by the way on the side of the pit and say you're the one that troubled the Nations you he was not Eternal he's not an eternal being and he desires to be an eternal being but he will never ever have the position that you have tonight brothers and sisters that's why he's howling because he can't touch it he cannot touch you if you are Eternal if you are in God's thoughts before there was ever start us oh my Satan doesn't even have a chance it's not even fair what our position is the Eternal thoughts of God look at that in the mirror in the morning and say that the Eternal thoughts of God right there the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his inabilities and so therefore he as God must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best way we could say that is sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all of his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real and the Bride of Jesus Christ is his real Eternal thoughts being manifest to this age they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of God see how this works God always had his thoughts for Adam Adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed Psalms 139:15 to16 will give you a little idea of this my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book were all my members written which in continuance were fashion when as yet there was none of them that as I said was not written about Adam but it gives you the idea a knowledge that the thought was there in his mind and that thought was eternal and he had and had to be expressed so when Adam was formed in the dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by God then Adam became God's thought expressed those Eternal thoughts were now manifested just want to pause there it's so beautiful we are those Eternal thoughts of God being manifested brothers and sisters don't ever discount who you are when the devil tries to make you feel like you messed up because you did mess up you said that you did that you went there you looked at whatever it is it doesn't matter because you are an eternal thought of God and the devil can't change that and he only he was an eternal thought of God but he was a thought of God that was to be destroyed and I'll say it this way I said was but is a thought of God to be destroyed my goodness isn't this Rich all right down through the centuries we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah a John the Baptist and each one of these were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in its season then we come to Jesus the logos he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be now it says that he hath chosen in him chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that Hallelujah why it just causes such a humility man doesn't make us say I've got better thoughts I've got better thinking I've got better reasoning I've got better better better anything what I've got is nothing because it's all him he's done it all from the very beginning let me inject a here even our natural birth is based upon election the female ovaries produce many many eggs but why is it that a certain time a certain eggs come down egg comes down and not another one and then amongst the male sperm down and not another sorry and then yeah okay sorry and then amongst the male sperm for no known reason a certain germ attaches itself to the egg while the others that could have just as easily attached themselves or had better opport opportunity to do so did not do so and perished there is an intelligence behind all this otherwise what determines whether the baby is a boy girl blonde brunette light or dark type of eyes Etc with these thoughts in mind think about Joshua and Caleb did not Jesus say in John 4 6:49 your fathers did eat Manor in the wilderness and are dead those parents that died were necessary as the forefathers of the people to whom Jesus was speaking they perished yet they were in the election of God naturally as Joshua and Caleb were spiritually there's people that are naturally in election to not be saved that's why brothers and sisters if we were to look around and see the people and be able to identify which ones are and which ones aren't and and we as human beings we don't have that ability by the way that is not our ability that's not our job that's God's job and that's his ability amen it's our job and our ability to treat everyone as though they are to show everyone Christ in this age so that all that are his will come they will be able to witness Jesus Christ alive on Earth it's amazing when you think about this they perished yet they were in the election of God naturally as Joshua and Caleb were spiritually but go on these elect were not only Eternal thoughts of God which were ex were to be expressed in the flesh in their due season but these same elect are called by another name Romans 4:16 therefore it is a faith that it might be of grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed remember we talked about this not seeds it's not plural not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all now how many of us could say Abraham is our father none of us we're not talking about natural we're talking spiritual here brothers and sisters now this is Romans 9:7 to13 neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called because we know that Abraham he had two sons didn't he now we're going to get into it that's it that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God remember those who live after the flesh do what they die after the Flesh and if we walk not after the flesh but of the spirit right but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall also have a son and not only this but when Rebecca had also conceived by one even our father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil this eliminates Works brothers and sisters right here in this one scripture neither having done good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and remember when Brother D David Dean har was here he said that that older one's got to die that old man has got to die so that the younger can actually rise up and live out through us that younger one being the spirit of Christ of course Galatians 3:16 to 29 16 and 29 sorry now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to the seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and if ye be Christ then ye are Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise my we made it this is where I wanted to get to tonight the cresendo is that how you say it you know brothers and sisters I just got a little quote I'm going to throw in here if we want to know that we know that we know some of the stuff that we've talked about tonight it can sound really almost frightening because some people are called and some people aren't and and all of the talk about you get the Holy Ghost since you believed and and is there a time between when you believe that you actually get the Holy Ghost in your life you know brothers and sisters if you don't know whether you got the holy ghost in your life and you want the holy ghost in your life all you got to do is ask God but he's not just going to say you can just have the Holy Ghost just no problem willy-nilly have the Holy Ghost and everyone can just have the Holy Ghost you want the Holy Ghost we'll just give the Holy Ghost even though that's what he does but he doesn't do it willy-nilly he only gives it to the elect but the elect brothers and sisters are going to behave like buddy Robinson remember the story of Buddy Robinson brother Bram tells a story this is out a spiritual Amnesia you don't have to look it up I'm just going to read it for time sake he says like buddy Robinson said one time in a cornfield he said Lord if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when you come back you'll find a pile of bones laying right here he was dead Earnest and you're not going to get anything from God until you get desperate enough brothers and sisters this is not a DAT to play Church we have got to know where we stand paragraph 173 according to Romans 4:16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed Paul puts himself and all the Believers under that designation because he says Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on not to not only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it I love that for in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promise as having to do with election or the choosing of God and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are the Royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated forn of God and were in the mind of God and his thoughts I just love this in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride this bride this one right here tonight is the bride this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ I just think that's so beautiful I've got this underlined highlighted it's very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and as is now manifesting God can you believe that not manifesting the church not manifesting Mom and Dad's religion not manifesting what I've just learned or went to a theological School manifesting God that to me is just about more than one can bear my oh my it's very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source yes was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ now then here we are coming to a conclusion and even tonight brothers and sisters as the Eternal logos God was manifested in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily let's turn over to Colossians 2:9 we still have a couple minutes here I think it's real important to just preach the word Colossians 2:9 not what the prophet said not what some Minister said what God Said Colossians 2 verse 9 for in him in who dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily amen let's just go back to verse eight beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit the teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ and remember one word off one word off is exactly what he's talking about here one word for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and what and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power my goodness now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and Jesus dwelt in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained amen and thereby gained the title of son even so brothers and sisters even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh I'll call the musicians as we close remember when Jesus was on Earth Satan came to him and tempted him and tried him but what did Jesus do he stuck with the word the devil said isn't it written and he said get behind me Satan for it's also written amen he did it three times and after he actually stood is ground according to the word Satan fled Jesus never fled we don't need to flee alls we need to do is submit ourselves therefore unto God and resist the devil brothers and sisters sometimes submitting ourselves therefore unto God isn't just going on our knees in prayer and submitting ourselves therefore unto God maybe it's actually coming according to the word of God and making that thing right that's wrong submitting ourselves therefore unto God then we can resist the devil and he's got to flee but if we've got that thing the devil knows it and so does God and the the Lord can't even help us he's going to say you know what I gave you my direction my word but if you're not willing to do it then uh the Tormentor come in your way I just love this though he goes on to say and those Eternal thoughts now manifest In the Flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called behold what manner of love Brothers and sisters maybe stand with me as we close tonight what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn Hallelujah for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken now we'll pick up from here next time he says hold this carefully in mind but brothers and sisters I want to say this I think it's important and I might cause some stir but maybe we need some stir remember what he says here because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened the word quickened means life we've got life there's something that's bubbling up inside of us when we're little kids in Sunday school we sing that song it's bubbling it's bubbling it's bubbling in my soul can we do that as adults or are we too shy to say that oh no I can't do that oh and maybe do the actions now brother Barry's getting a little crazy I know I'm getting some funny looks it's late on a Wednesday but brothers and sisters is it bubbling in our souls if we are Sons and Daughters it ought to be amen if it's not is it his spirit because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened now some people will say brother Barry I've been Quicken to the word I can say amen God sent a prophet sure enough but is the life that the prophet brought to represent living now in you and through you because if it's not then you've missed the point of the message of the hour the message of the hour was to call out that elect seed to God to take a bride of his own choosing because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken hold this in mind hold this carefully in mind he says hold this carefully in mind that in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken so if we come to church and it's just yeah whatever I want to say brothers and sisters are we seed that might be really sharp but I think this is the day and age in which we need to be sharp I can only imagine that just before it was time to get into the ark Noah wasn't saying oh please can we write handwritten notes to everyone and say would you please come to the invitation to the ark because it's going to rain and God is actually going to destroy all flesh All Flesh is full of violence in the world the whole entire world everything that's breathing in his lungs is going to die it's going to perish he wasn't doing that he was crying out he was saying get in the boat brothers and sisters it's just about to rain fire and it's going to be one way or the other either it's going to be an atomic b or it's going to be an antichrist Spirit that's going to crush the world one way or another just get in the boat but I recognize it that not everyone can let's just pray for those those ones that are just waiting to get in the boat because there's still some elected seed or we wouldn't be here right now let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we love you and we thank you for your word thank you Lord Jesus that there are seed on the Earth today that can be quickened father by by your word and we know it doesn't mean to just simply say that you sent a prophet and to say that we know the the words the prophet said oh Father it's because we've got that life that the prophet represented inside of us Lord Jesus we followed the instructions and it made the way for the introduction of the bridegroom the Heavenly bridegroom to the Earthly bride and father we know that Lord we have the opportunity to rejoice and be very glad not just a little glad but very glad because oh Lord Jesus your bride hath made herself ready the wife no longer the bride the wife ha made herself ready father we love you and we thank you for your word thank you for sending us ears to hear in the day in which we live father Lord that your spirit could Quicken our very Souls father if there's anyone who desires to have your spirit living in their lives that they just don't know father Lord tonight I pray that somehow some way you would just minister to that person Lord that father when they wake up tomorrow morning that they would know exactly where they stand father that you would just begin to pour yourself out to and through all of your children Lord Jesus we love you and we thank you we pray now that you would be with those who are traveling father that you would give them traveling mercies father those who will travel this weekend Lord father we pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us keep your angels encamped about those who fear you Lord Jesus and father we'll be careful to give you all the praise when we come back lord we love you we thank you we just commit each life into your hands For Your Glory now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen can we sing to God be the glory to God be the glory believe it's an old fatty Crosby song [Music] to God be the glory to God he
