[48:55] Lord
[48:58] Lord lead us on my heart and once again
[49:02] comes out as a poem yesterday morning I
[49:05] was just having a real good time in the
[49:07] Lord
[49:09] just the thought of
[49:12] honoring the Living Word
[49:13] [Music]
[49:15] the word in our brothers and sisters the
[49:17] word Made Alive in this day
[49:21] and it went to Matthew 22 and where he
[49:23] gave the great Commandments
[49:25] and just the lurk started looking at
[49:27] that word neighbor
[49:29] and it has a compound meeting there is
[49:32] our neighbor geographically
[49:34] but I've asked you to look around here
[49:36] today
[49:37] and consider your neighbor
[49:40] those sealed into Heavenly places
[49:43] those that make a stand for this word
[49:47] there's no one else in this earth that
[49:49] deserves more reverence and more honor
[49:51] than the Bride of Jesus Christ
[49:53] so this is titled the great commandment
[49:58] in the bosom of our being
[50:01] growing Within
[50:03] the love that was promised to return
[50:06] again
[50:10] to love the Lord our god with heart soul
[50:13] and mind
[50:15] the first and great commandment truly
[50:17] defined
[50:19] with all our soul declaring Let It Be
[50:23] a love that believes what our hearts can
[50:26] see
[50:28] to acknowledge his presence in every
[50:30] situation
[50:32] and send surrender our souls to his
[50:35] Heavenly communication
[50:37] with all our mind with wisdom profound
[50:42] meditating on his truth in thoughts that
[50:45] astound
[50:46] seek understanding to know him deep
[50:50] and letting his revelations in our
[50:52] hearts steep
[50:54] and loving Our God with all our might
[50:57] our souls manifest glowing with his
[51:01] light
[51:02] his presence consumes
[51:05] filling every part
[51:06] bringing fulfillment purpose of Revival
[51:10] to start
[51:12] but the Commandment does not end there
[51:14] another connection a truth we must share
[51:19] to love our fellow being
[51:21] like ourselves
[51:23] Pride Must Die
[51:25] on these two Commandments the entirety
[51:28] relies
[51:30] to extend love
[51:32] as we have received
[51:34] care and uplift
[51:36] our siblings in need
[51:39] to show kindness compassion and Grace
[51:43] for our fellow people
[51:45] no matter the place
[51:49] when we love our Kindred as ourselves
[51:53] a Unity forms binding hearts and souls
[51:57] the Prophecies of prophets find their
[52:00] rightful place
[52:01] by these two Commandments
[52:04] loves true embrace
[52:06] let your love for God be fierce and pure
[52:10] but heart and Minds in all we endure
[52:14] let your love for others be the same
[52:18] a reflection of his love the ultimate
[52:21] aim
[52:22] and these two Commandments we find
[52:24] happily
[52:26] a Divine love that unites God's
[52:29] spiritual family
[52:31] so let us hold this mystical body close
[52:35] each and every day
[52:37] and walk in love's path
[52:39] in every possible way
[52:41] Lord bless you all
[52:44] [Applause]

[53:00] wonderful
[53:02] exhortation I believe to the people this
[53:04] morning
[53:06] recognizing God and each one of us is
[53:09] remarkable hearing
[53:11] a prophet on me I think it was the
[53:13] breach between the seals this morning
[53:14] talking much along that same lining
[53:17] talked about after the blood before the
[53:19] blood after Calvary and he said how much
[53:20] more now after Calvary how that
[53:23] connection between all of our souls
[53:24] exists and how we ought to love each
[53:26] other
[53:27] God is manifested flesh once again each
[53:30] one of you God bless you
[53:33] it's wonderful
[53:34] but feeling that gift is certainly
[53:37] encouraging to us

[1:00:28] thank you musicians
[1:00:31] bless you this morning certainly good to
[1:00:34] be back if you have your Bibles
[1:00:36] standing I just like to read from
[1:00:38] Genesis chapter 4 this morning
[1:00:41] maybe a little bit of a different
[1:00:42] thought a different topic
[1:00:46] trust the Lord will
[1:00:48] bless it
[1:00:51] Genesis chapter 4
[1:00:55] very familiar scripture
[1:00:57] start with verse one
[1:01:00] an atom
[1:01:02] knew Eve his wife
[1:01:04] she conceived in Bear Cain and said I
[1:01:07] have gotten a man from the Lord
[1:01:11] and she again bear his brother Abel
[1:01:14] and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but
[1:01:16] Cain was a tiller of the ground
[1:01:20] and in the process of time it came to
[1:01:22] pass that Cain brought of the fruit of
[1:01:24] the ground
[1:01:25] an offering unto the Lord
[1:01:28] and Abel he also brought of the first
[1:01:30] Links of his flock
[1:01:32] and of the fat thereof and the Lord had
[1:01:35] respect unto Abel and to his offering
[1:01:38] but unto Cain
[1:01:40] and to his offering he had not respect
[1:01:44] and Cain was very rough
[1:01:47] and his countenance fell
[1:01:50] the Lord said unto Cain
[1:01:52] why art thou Wrath why is thy
[1:01:55] countenance Fallen
[1:01:57] if thou doest well Thou shalt not be
[1:01:59] accepted shalt thou not be accepted and
[1:02:02] if thou doest not will sin lieth at the
[1:02:05] door
[1:02:06] and unto thee shall be his desire and
[1:02:09] thou shalt rule over him
[1:02:13] verse 8 and Cain talked with Abel his
[1:02:15] brother
[1:02:16] and it came to pass when they were in
[1:02:18] the field
[1:02:19] the cane rose up against Abel his
[1:02:21] brother
[1:02:22] and slew him
[1:02:25] and the Lord said unto Cain where is
[1:02:27] Abel thy brother
[1:02:29] and he said I know not
[1:02:31] am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:02:34] and he said what hast thou done
[1:02:37] the voice of thy brother's blood crieth
[1:02:40] unto me from the ground
[1:02:43] and now Thou Art cursed from the Earth
[1:02:47] which hath opened her mouth to receive
[1:02:49] thy brother's blood from thy hand
[1:02:52] when thou tillest the ground it shall
[1:02:54] not henceforth yield unto thee her
[1:02:57] strength
[1:02:58] a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be
[1:03:00] in the Earth
[1:03:02] and Cade said unto the Lord my
[1:03:04] punishment is greater than I can bear
[1:03:07] behold thou has driven me out this day
[1:03:10] from the face of the Earth and from thy
[1:03:13] face shall I be hid and I shall be a
[1:03:15] fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and
[1:03:17] it shall come to pass that everyone that
[1:03:20] findeth me shall slay me
[1:03:23] and the Lord saith unto him
[1:03:25] therefore whosoever slayeth Cain
[1:03:28] Vengeance shall be taken on him
[1:03:30] Sevenfold
[1:03:31] and the Lord set a mark upon Cain
[1:03:35] lest any finding him should kill him
[1:03:39] and Cain went out from the presence of
[1:03:41] the Lord and dwelt in the Land of Nod on
[1:03:44] the East of Eden
[1:03:46] let's just bow one more time
[1:03:49] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[1:03:51] word we thank you for the the ability
[1:03:54] Lord Jesus to understand through a
[1:03:56] Vindicated Prophet Lord
[1:03:59] what you say in your word
[1:04:01] we know that you have
[1:04:03] written this word Lord that it's no
[1:04:05] accident that it says it exactly the way
[1:04:07] it does
[1:04:09] it's so that certain things can be
[1:04:10] eliminated if we are willing to allow
[1:04:13] your spirit father to eliminate it to us
[1:04:17] father we pray that one more time you
[1:04:19] would just eliminate the scripture to us
[1:04:21] father
[1:04:22] that you would just change us father one
[1:04:24] more time from glory to glory
[1:04:27] we just ask all these things now in
[1:04:28] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I bless
[1:04:31] you this morning you may be seated
[1:04:38] this morning I really wanted to just set
[1:04:40] the background for the story about Cain
[1:04:42] and Abel
[1:04:44] we're very familiar with it I'm sure
[1:04:47] um
[1:04:48] before we get into it we just have a few
[1:04:51] announcements I wanted to make
[1:04:53] sure that we
[1:04:55] brought them
[1:05:01] one of the uh one of the happy ones is
[1:05:04] that brother Juma
[1:05:05] has traveled and taken himself a bride
[1:05:09] and he is now married
[1:05:11] amen so God bless you brother Juma
[1:05:19] [Applause]
[1:05:20] I will share some pictures on WhatsApp I
[1:05:23] was going to try and bring them up here
[1:05:24] but I got sidetracked this morning so
[1:05:27] um we'll put them on WhatsApp I'm sure
[1:05:29] he won't mind
[1:05:30] and as well brother tabiso and sister
[1:05:32] Marion have traveled to Kenya to go and
[1:05:35] visit the families so they can deal with
[1:05:38] the Dowry because they are now
[1:05:40] officially engaged
[1:05:42] [Applause]
[1:05:48] they have been they have been courting
[1:05:52] for a long time and the Lord has just
[1:05:54] been wonderful he's really opened up
[1:05:56] doors for them and helped each one of
[1:05:58] them as they've gone along the way and
[1:06:00] it's just been wonderful to see them
[1:06:02] operate under the the influence of the
[1:06:05] Holy Spirit
[1:06:07] so if you can just remember them all in
[1:06:10] prayer for the Juma I know would like to
[1:06:13] have his wife immigrate so that's going
[1:06:16] to be a bit of a process but we know the
[1:06:17] Lord can do wonderful Mighty things
[1:06:22] um just a few more announcements we have
[1:06:23] a Youth Event coming up and decided to
[1:06:27] change it from the Friday to a Sunday
[1:06:30] and that's in hopes that the parents
[1:06:33] would be able to help facilitate the
[1:06:36] children actually being able to get to
[1:06:38] the youth events on a Sunday that way
[1:06:41] it's not during the work week it's after
[1:06:42] service and uh you know we're just going
[1:06:45] to try it and see what happens so uh
[1:06:47] brother Joel and Sister Crystal have
[1:06:49] moved it to Sunday uh September the 10th
[1:06:52] and it will start from two o'clock it
[1:06:54] end at five and lunch will be served at
[1:06:57] their house and uh so if you want to
[1:06:59] pick up your children come by five
[1:07:01] o'clock that would be wonderful it will
[1:07:03] be over then for those who are older
[1:07:05] that have the ability to travel on their
[1:07:07] own they've said you can stay that's
[1:07:09] fine but it is a work night and a school
[1:07:11] night so they request that you would
[1:07:13] leave by 11.
[1:07:16] sometimes the fellowship is actually so
[1:07:18] good personally I would say it would be
[1:07:21] best in my opinion to leave much sooner
[1:07:23] than that but I'm not going to get
[1:07:25] involved that's just my opinion it's not
[1:07:27] worth a lot but
[1:07:29] um if you have any questions by all
[1:07:31] means just reach out and uh either
[1:07:33] myself or brother Joel could answer the
[1:07:35] questions
[1:07:37] um just pray for them we know that when
[1:07:39] you do events on a Sunday it's a very
[1:07:42] difficult thing it's not easy so they're
[1:07:44] really trying to put their best foot
[1:07:46] forward here to facilitate as many young
[1:07:49] people being able to be involved as
[1:07:50] possible so if you can come it certainly
[1:07:53] will be a blessing I'm sure for everyone
[1:07:56] uh September is here we will be getting
[1:08:00] back to the regular uh service program
[1:08:04] if you will I know that could be a bad
[1:08:06] word around the message and maybe I
[1:08:07] shouldn't say that but I'm sure you
[1:08:09] understand what I mean uh we're going to
[1:08:12] have a community service on Sunday
[1:08:13] September the 17th at 6 PM we're going
[1:08:16] to have a prayer meeting Thursday
[1:08:18] September the 14th at 7 30 pm
[1:08:21] and we have brother James Nevada Bandy
[1:08:23] here on Wednesday September the 28th
[1:08:26] so I think we're going to have uh just a
[1:08:29] wonderful month
[1:08:31] it's always nice to get into September
[1:08:32] we can see the leaves changing the the
[1:08:35] seasons are changing and children are
[1:08:39] going back to school for some it's good
[1:08:40] for some it's bad but we know that it
[1:08:44] has to be that way it's just the world
[1:08:47] that we live in and certainly thankful
[1:08:49] for the goodness of God in our lives
[1:08:52] I definitely want to pray with the
[1:08:54] children
[1:08:55] um
[1:08:55] you know what maybe we could do that now
[1:08:58] would you mind maybe we could just
[1:09:00] invite all the children up to the front
[1:09:02] of the church here those who are going
[1:09:03] to be going to school
[1:09:05] old and young if you're going to school
[1:09:07] by all means come up the school system
[1:09:09] today is not designed for Sons and
[1:09:12] Daughters of God and I believe as a body
[1:09:15] of Believers we have the opportunity to
[1:09:17] actually pray God's blessing over the
[1:09:20] children
[1:09:21] so if you don't mind children just come
[1:09:24] on up let's ask the blessing
[1:09:31] it might sound like a
[1:09:34] silly thing some might say it's some
[1:09:36] kind of a tradition
[1:09:38] but I believe is a body of believers
[1:09:41] to our point this morning
[1:09:43] you know we are our Brother's Keeper
[1:09:46] and if we're not our Brother's Keeper
[1:09:48] then I think we need to take a look at
[1:09:50] our experience
[1:09:51] because we know whose spirit that Cain
[1:09:53] was of
[1:09:55] look at this amazing group here
[1:09:58] just give them a hand amen
[1:10:02] [Applause]

[1:10:10] come on up buddy it's okay it's really
[1:10:11] nice yeah you want to come over here
[1:10:13] you're okay buddy

[1:10:32] through the Vindicated prophet in our
[1:10:34] age this is our heritage Lord
[1:10:37] and father it behooves us as a body of
[1:10:39] Believers to stand in the gap for our
[1:10:41] children Lord Jesus father it's not oh

[1:10:47] with their children it's our problem as
[1:10:49] a body of Believers and father this
[1:10:51] morning we pray that we could just unite
[1:10:53] together father and just apply the token
[1:10:55] to each one of these children Lord as a
[1:10:57] body of Believers father help us to
[1:11:00] recognize our position Lord and help us
[1:11:02] father to stand in the Gap as we've said
[1:11:04] for each one Lord help us to remember
[1:11:06] each one by Name Lord Jesus father that
[1:11:09] we could just learn our brothers and our
[1:11:11] sisters burdens Lord and that we could

[1:11:18] these children into your hands father as
[1:11:20] they go forwards into school another
[1:11:21] school year Lord dealing with all of the
[1:11:24] all of the the knowledge of of the tree
[1:11:27] of good and evil Lord Jesus we know that
[1:11:29] father you said to this generation that
[1:11:31] education is of the devil and father we
[1:11:34] know that even now it's even worse than
[1:11:37] it was 60 years ago father how far have
[1:11:41] we gone how how full does the cup of the
[1:11:43] amorites have to get but we know that

[1:11:47] this morning we just want to commit each
[1:11:49] child fresh into your hands as they have
[1:11:52] to go and bear all of the stuff that
[1:11:54] they have to deal with in school Lord
[1:11:56] all of that that scientific teaching

[1:12:03] cover them with your blood that you
[1:12:05] would just allow them to go forwards

[1:12:55] certainly thankful to have the ministry
[1:12:57] in the body
[1:13:00] um
[1:13:02] I just enjoyed watching the services
[1:13:04] catching up
[1:13:06] certainly incredible to see the the Lord
[1:13:08] moving in our midst and uh
[1:13:11] really enjoyed brother Meadow
[1:13:13] coming here sister Shelley's birthday
[1:13:17] um
[1:13:18] yeah just a wonderful time to be with
[1:13:20] brother Meadow anytime you know brother
[1:13:22] Branham we were talking about brother
[1:13:24] Meadow and brother Branham said that you
[1:13:26] know the real big man
[1:13:30] tries to make you feel that way
[1:13:32] the bigger man always tries to make you
[1:13:35] feel that way and I have never met a
[1:13:36] time where I have come face to face with
[1:13:39] brother Mena where he has not exactly
[1:13:41] done that
[1:13:42] every single time you speak to him he
[1:13:44] just makes you feel good
[1:13:46] he just appreciates you and what what an
[1:13:49] honor it was to have brother meno here
[1:13:51] so
[1:13:52] anyways
[1:13:54] um I just love his approach and his
[1:13:56] encouragement is I would say just about
[1:13:58] Second To None he's been a real
[1:14:00] encouragement to me
[1:14:03] I uh certainly thankful for all the
[1:14:05] brothers brother Gilbert and brother
[1:14:07] Emmanuel alike just wonderful time in
[1:14:10] the word and uh just pray that God
[1:14:13] richly blesses you all for your efforts
[1:14:16] you know in our scripture this morning
[1:14:18] I want to talk about
[1:14:20] uh Genesis chapter 4 verse 9 and the
[1:14:23] Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy
[1:14:26] brother
[1:14:27] and he said I know not
[1:14:30] am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:14:32] and we know full well that Cain knew
[1:14:34] exactly where his brother was
[1:14:36] that he killed him in the field
[1:14:39] and maybe he would say scientifically
[1:14:41] technically I don't know where he went
[1:14:43] to after he died did his Spirit go up or
[1:14:45] did it go down or did it fly to another
[1:14:47] planet I can only imagine that Cain
[1:14:49] would start down that road to say
[1:14:51] technically speaking I don't know
[1:14:54] but we know that he knew he slayed him
[1:14:56] he killed his brother and and we know
[1:14:59] that that was the answer that God was
[1:15:01] looking for but of course because he
[1:15:04] wasn't of Adam
[1:15:06] he was of Satan what did he do he lied
[1:15:09] he started with a lie
[1:15:11] and we know that that's Satan's way is
[1:15:14] to lie but then what does he do he
[1:15:17] questions God he says am I My Brother's
[1:15:20] Keeper
[1:15:21] and you know this has really been on my
[1:15:23] heart when we were fishing
[1:15:25] we were up north
[1:15:26] we were having a conversation and it
[1:15:28] just became part of our fellowship and
[1:15:30] it just resounded with me and I just
[1:15:32] love it when the Lord speaks to me
[1:15:34] individually I'm sure we all understand
[1:15:36] what that's like but just resounded with
[1:15:39] me I am My Brother's Keeper and you know
[1:15:42] brothers and sisters I'm going to say it
[1:15:44] again if we don't have the spirit of
[1:15:48] being our Brother's Keeper
[1:15:50] if we say what Cain said
[1:15:54] with our words
[1:15:55] or think it with our thoughts my house
[1:15:58] is fine my children are fine my Affairs
[1:16:01] are fine my church is fine everything in
[1:16:04] my business my schooling everything is
[1:16:05] fine
[1:16:08] who are we talking for
[1:16:10] whose voice is that speaking to us and
[1:16:12] through us
[1:16:14] that's not God's voice
[1:16:17] it's interesting because that's Satan's
[1:16:20] voice
[1:16:21] and we know full well that this is this
[1:16:24] is the characteristics of of Satan and
[1:16:28] and people might say well this is just
[1:16:31] Cain and he just maybe made the wrong
[1:16:33] choice and as human beings we can make
[1:16:35] the wrong choice and before we get too
[1:16:37] far into this I I feel like this is
[1:16:39] going to be a really long topic and I'm
[1:16:41] not going to try and drag it out for us
[1:16:42] today I'm probably just going to hit
[1:16:44] some highlights but I think it's going
[1:16:45] to be really important to just lay a
[1:16:48] foundation for it to really drill into
[1:16:50] this and just make sure that we're we're
[1:16:52] catching all of the sort of the
[1:16:54] Revelation in this one verse and the
[1:16:57] Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy
[1:16:59] brother and he said I know not am I My
[1:17:01] Brother's Keeper
[1:17:02] I have heard it said many times I'm not
[1:17:05] my brother's keeper and and I've thought
[1:17:07] it many times you know I've heard
[1:17:09] someone would ask something about
[1:17:10] someone and and I'd say I don't know is
[1:17:13] it my problem it's not my problem I've
[1:17:15] got everything in order it's I don't
[1:17:16] know where is he how is he it is our
[1:17:19] responsibility it is up to us
[1:17:22] because anything other
[1:17:25] than the spirit of looking after our
[1:17:28] brothers I don't know I think it's
[1:17:30] pretty close to this year
[1:17:31] you know we've heard it said many times
[1:17:33] when when we see the characteristics of
[1:17:36] children we can look at them and say you
[1:17:39] know that's just like their daddy
[1:17:41] can't we say that
[1:17:42] that's just the chip off the old block
[1:17:45] you look at the way that boy is he's
[1:17:46] just exactly like his daddy maybe he
[1:17:49] talks like his daddy maybe he sings like
[1:17:51] his daddy maybe he walks like his daddy
[1:17:53] he might chew like his daddy he might
[1:17:55] comb his hair like his daddy or dress
[1:17:57] like his daddy but there's
[1:17:58] characteristics that come out and we
[1:18:01] can't hide them
[1:18:02] we are
[1:18:05] the same as our dads
[1:18:07] I just think it's interesting because we
[1:18:09] have all these characteristics just in
[1:18:11] that one verse we can say that he was a
[1:18:13] liar and he was a murderer in one verse
[1:18:16] we can look at that and we know the
[1:18:17] verses it goes further into into Genesis
[1:18:20] we talked about it there but I'm just
[1:18:22] saying it for the sake of time in one
[1:18:24] verse we can see how he just wants to
[1:18:26] cover it up
[1:18:27] and that's not the spirit of Christ at
[1:18:29] all in any way so today I want to talk
[1:18:31] about
[1:18:32] My Brother's Keeper
[1:18:36] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:18:39] uh you can look up this phrase before
[1:18:41] Adam ever
[1:18:43] and I'll just wait so we can bring that
[1:18:45] up
[1:18:46] before Adam ever
[1:18:48] I know that it's very helpful to bring
[1:18:50] it up on the overhead so we're working
[1:18:52] to to integrate that together all be
[1:18:55] slower they'll be faster and
[1:18:58] excuse me we'll get there
[1:19:00] as for being able to upload all of the
[1:19:02] quotes initially I don't know if I'm
[1:19:04] going to get there I'm not going to
[1:19:05] promise anything but you know we're just
[1:19:07] here to to Fellowship around the word of
[1:19:10] God and there's no pressure we don't
[1:19:11] need to get nervous you don't need to
[1:19:13] have any stress
[1:19:14] before Adam ever are we able to find
[1:19:17] that in the exposition of the seven
[1:19:18] Church ages
[1:19:20] before Adam ever
[1:19:26] it's in the Ephesian Church age just
[1:19:28] yeah you got it there it is
[1:19:31] before Adam ever had carnal knowledge of
[1:19:36] Eve
[1:19:37] the serpent had that knowledge ahead of
[1:19:39] him
[1:19:41] and that one born of it was Cain
[1:19:45] was of
[1:19:47] born of begotten of that Wicked one
[1:19:52] First John 3 12.
[1:19:55] clear identification in the word of God
[1:19:58] about who Cain was
[1:20:01] the holy spirit in John could not in one
[1:20:04] place call Adam
[1:20:06] the wicked one
[1:20:07] for that is what he would be if he
[1:20:10] fathered Cain
[1:20:13] and in another place called Adam the Son
[1:20:16] of God which he was by creation
[1:20:20] in Luke 3 38.
[1:20:23] Cain turned out in character like his
[1:20:27] father
[1:20:29] a bringer of death
[1:20:31] a murderer
[1:20:34] this is really what I want to get into
[1:20:36] here I don't know if I've ever seen this
[1:20:37] before maybe so vivid but sometimes it's
[1:20:40] just the way the Lord does stuff Candor
[1:20:42] turned out in character like his father
[1:20:44] a bringer of death a murderer his utter
[1:20:47] Defiance of God when faced by the
[1:20:51] almighty in Genesis 4 5 9 13-14 showed
[1:20:56] him to be absolutely unhumanlike in
[1:21:00] characteristics
[1:21:02] seeming even to surpass any account we
[1:21:05] have in scripture concerning a
[1:21:08] confrontation of Satan by God
[1:21:12] isn't that interesting
[1:21:14] it makes me think of the statement that
[1:21:16] brother Bradham would say that fools
[1:21:17] will tread in hob-nailed shoes Where
[1:21:20] Angels won't even go
[1:21:23] fools would dare
[1:21:25] make accusations
[1:21:28] but the characteristics
[1:21:30] it's amazing going on it says but unto
[1:21:33] Cain and his offering he had not
[1:21:35] respected and Cain was very Roth and his
[1:21:37] countenance fell and the Lord said unto
[1:21:40] Cain where is Abel thy brother and he
[1:21:43] said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:21:47] and Cain said unto the Lord
[1:21:49] My Punishment is greater than I can bear
[1:21:52] behold thou has driven me out this day
[1:21:54] from the face of the Earth
[1:21:56] and from thy face shall I be hid and I
[1:22:00] shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in
[1:22:01] the earth and it shall come to pass that
[1:22:03] everyone that findeth me shall slay me
[1:22:08] notice the exact way the record of God
[1:22:11] sets forth the account of the births of
[1:22:15] Cain
[1:22:16] Abel and Seth
[1:22:18] I think it's beautiful how he spells
[1:22:21] this out and you know for most of us we
[1:22:23] understand this we get it we preaching
[1:22:24] to the choir and I would just invite you
[1:22:26] to say Amen to it and just come along
[1:22:28] for the ride because I know there's
[1:22:30] people that don't know this and it's
[1:22:32] probably important for them to hear it
[1:22:35] because if we can understand what
[1:22:37] happened in the Garden of Eden it
[1:22:39] unlocks the message of the hour it gives
[1:22:43] us the ability to recognize who we truly
[1:22:46] are
[1:22:46] and you know we we heard the poem this
[1:22:49] morning we talk about being the Bride of
[1:22:51] Jesus Christ it's not an exclusive Club
[1:22:52] brothers and sisters
[1:22:54] for anybody who might be listening when
[1:22:56] we say that we're not saying that oh my
[1:22:59] word that that group I'm so glad that I
[1:23:02] can say I'm one of them and I'm not one
[1:23:04] of them although that's what a True
[1:23:06] Believer does know in their heart
[1:23:07] because it's only by the grace of God
[1:23:10] that we're saved through faith and not
[1:23:12] of Works lest any man should boast it's
[1:23:15] only the grace of God that we're saved
[1:23:17] it's only the grace of God that we can
[1:23:19] dare say that I am the Bride of Jesus
[1:23:22] Christ
[1:23:23] that's the only way
[1:23:26] but if we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:23:28] then we're going to Bear different
[1:23:29] characteristics like we're talking about
[1:23:31] this morning and those characteristics
[1:23:33] are going to be right in line with the
[1:23:35] word of God they're not going to be
[1:23:37] mixed with some idea they're not going
[1:23:39] to be changed and adapted to fit our
[1:23:42] personality types or maybe the scars and
[1:23:45] wounds that we have in our life we're
[1:23:47] going to say Amen to every single word
[1:23:49] and not just say Amen by saying amen
[1:23:51] we're going to show it by living it
[1:23:53] living the am in our Amen in our lives
[1:23:57] he says notice the exact way the record
[1:23:59] of God sets forth the account of the
[1:24:01] births of Cain Abel and Seth
[1:24:06] Genesis 4 1-2 and Adam knew Eve his wife
[1:24:12] and she conceived and bear Cain and said
[1:24:15] I have gotten a man from the Lord
[1:24:19] and she again bear his brother Abel
[1:24:25] just pause in there for a second just on
[1:24:27] purpose
[1:24:28] Genesis 4 25 and Adam knew his wife
[1:24:32] again
[1:24:33] and she bear a son and called his name
[1:24:36] Seth
[1:24:37] I'm just going to read it the way
[1:24:39] brother Branham reads it I feel really
[1:24:40] inspired and want to say it but I'm just
[1:24:42] going to continue reading he says there
[1:24:45] are three sons born from two acts of
[1:24:49] carnal knowledge by Adam
[1:24:52] and if we didn't catch that it's
[1:24:54] important to go back into the Bible and
[1:24:56] read it maybe I'll just read it again
[1:24:59] and Adam knew his wife and she conceived
[1:25:02] and bear Cain and said I have gotten a
[1:25:05] man from the Lord and she again bear his
[1:25:07] brother Abel
[1:25:09] act Genesis 4 25 and Adam knew his wife
[1:25:13] again and she bear a son and called his
[1:25:15] name Seth
[1:25:17] two carnal Acts
[1:25:19] three children
[1:25:21] how does that work
[1:25:23] we know that in the modern world there's
[1:25:24] a term for that and we'll get to that
[1:25:27] so brother Branham goes on to say there
[1:25:28] are three sons born from two acts of
[1:25:31] carnal knowledge by Adam
[1:25:33] since the Bible is the exact and perfect
[1:25:36] word of God this is no mistake but a
[1:25:38] record for our illumination
[1:25:40] so I think it just Bears record or or
[1:25:43] maybe it's worthwhile to just pause
[1:25:45] there and say do we believe the word of
[1:25:47] God to be the infallible word is it the
[1:25:50] absolute for us
[1:25:51] because if it's not then we really don't
[1:25:53] have a whole lot more to talk about but
[1:25:56] if it is then I believe it causes
[1:25:57] something inside of us to say well tell
[1:26:00] me more let me see what you're talking
[1:26:01] about I have a curiosity about what
[1:26:04] you're saying here
[1:26:06] are three sons born from two acts of
[1:26:08] cardinal knowledge by Adam since the
[1:26:10] Bible is the exact and perfect word of
[1:26:12] God this is no mistake but a record for
[1:26:15] our elimination since three sons were
[1:26:18] born from two acts by Adam you know
[1:26:21] positively that one of those three was
[1:26:25] not the son of Adam
[1:26:27] otherwise Adam would be the wicked one
[1:26:30] we read that earlier is that correct
[1:26:33] Adam would have to be called The Wicked
[1:26:35] one
[1:26:36] and we know that there's a an account of
[1:26:38] this further in the Bible we're not
[1:26:40] going to get into that this morning
[1:26:41] because I don't really want to try and
[1:26:43] do that what I do want to do is talk
[1:26:44] about his characteristics but along the
[1:26:46] way I want to try and spell this out a
[1:26:48] little bit God has recorded in this
[1:26:50] exact manner to show us something the
[1:26:53] word of God is no accident
[1:26:55] it's not just a happen chance there was
[1:26:57] there was the authors the sorry the
[1:27:00] scribes there's one author of The Bible
[1:27:02] and that's God himself with many
[1:27:04] different scribes over many different
[1:27:06] years we know that but God recorded this
[1:27:08] in this exact manner to show us
[1:27:10] something
[1:27:11] but we know that it's only going to
[1:27:13] happen by Revelation right that's the
[1:27:15] only way it's going to happen
[1:27:17] the truth of the matter is that Eve had
[1:27:20] in her womb two sons twins from separate
[1:27:23] impregnations
[1:27:26] I believe it's called super fundication
[1:27:31] yeah there's actually a scientific term
[1:27:33] for it you can look it up on Google for
[1:27:36] anyone that's interested it's actually a
[1:27:38] real thing
[1:27:39] she was carrying twins with Kane's
[1:27:42] conception sometime previous to that of
[1:27:45] Abel's see those twins again perfect
[1:27:47] type as always to those who think that
[1:27:51] this is not possible let it be known
[1:27:52] that medical records are complete with
[1:27:54] replete with cases where women have
[1:27:57] carried twins who are of separate OVA
[1:27:59] and separate insemination with the
[1:28:01] fertilization of the eggs being days
[1:28:03] apart and not only so but some of the
[1:28:07] records show that the twins were
[1:28:09] fathered by separate males
[1:28:12] that's exactly what happened in the
[1:28:14] Garden of Eden
[1:28:15] and this is where the denominational
[1:28:18] World said that William Mary and Bradham
[1:28:20] went off the rails
[1:28:22] right yeah he got into his own crazy
[1:28:25] Doctrine
[1:28:26] but how could the serpent be cursed to
[1:28:29] be the serpent
[1:28:32] how could you go from being a snake when
[1:28:34] the curses were being handed out to
[1:28:35] being a snake
[1:28:39] it just doesn't work
[1:28:41] you just can't even
[1:28:43] yeah
[1:28:45] we're not going to go too far with it
[1:28:46] today but I just wanted to lay this out
[1:28:48] to say you know what something
[1:28:49] significant happened in the Garden of
[1:28:51] Eden Cain was not of Adam
[1:28:54] there's a reason why he has the
[1:28:56] characteristics that he does some people
[1:28:58] in the denominational world will say Do
[1:29:00] you believe that that Eve had sex with
[1:29:02] with the Devil
[1:29:03] well maybe not directly no
[1:29:06] but indirectly yes
[1:29:08] exactly according to what we've just
[1:29:10] read
[1:29:17] I just want to say it again I think it's
[1:29:19] so important for us
[1:29:23] we have to be our Brother's Keeper
[1:29:26] we have to be our Sister's Keeper
[1:29:29] we have to be our children's keeper
[1:29:32] when something happens in the body
[1:29:35] it's not us saying oh look at that pinky
[1:29:38] finger oh it's terrible oh look at that
[1:29:40] injury no the body grabs that and and
[1:29:43] works on it and heals it brother Bradham
[1:29:46] says that healing comes through the body
[1:29:49] brother Branham says that salvation
[1:29:51] comes through the body
[1:29:54] and if we don't like our left hand we
[1:29:57] can't get mad at it and say I no longer
[1:29:59] want you because you're not a right hand
[1:30:01] we need our left hand just like we need
[1:30:04] our right hand if we're if we're
[1:30:06] right-handed we still need our left hand
[1:30:08] if we're left-handed we still need our
[1:30:09] right hand we need our our feet our toes
[1:30:11] we need the hinder parts we need the
[1:30:13] four parts we need every part of the
[1:30:15] body
[1:30:18] we are our Brother's Keeper
[1:30:21] and this is just something that's so
[1:30:23] impressed upon me and and I just
[1:30:26] I felt led to go here today so we'll
[1:30:28] just see what the Lord has in store I
[1:30:30] trust it's all right
[1:30:33] you know when we think about our lives
[1:30:35] and and where we stand in our lives
[1:30:39] harboring unforgiveness in our lives
[1:30:42] isn't going to do us any good
[1:30:45] if we're harboring unforgiveness in our
[1:30:46] lives
[1:30:48] then I would say that's not the spirit
[1:30:50] of Christ
[1:30:52] because in Luke 17
[1:30:55] Jesus said then he said unto the
[1:30:58] disciples
[1:30:59] it is impossible but that offenses will
[1:31:02] come
[1:31:03] but woe unto him
[1:31:05] through through whom they come
[1:31:09] it were better for him than a millstone
[1:31:11] were hanging about his neck and cast
[1:31:12] into the sea
[1:31:14] then he should then that he should
[1:31:16] offend one of these little ones
[1:31:20] he said take heed to this yourselves If
[1:31:22] thy brother trespass against thee rebuke
[1:31:25] him bring it to him tell him you stepped
[1:31:28] on my toes man
[1:31:31] if I'd rather trespass against thee
[1:31:33] rebuke him
[1:31:36] and if he repent forgive him
[1:31:40] the word of God says if he doesn't
[1:31:41] repent
[1:31:43] then take a witness
[1:31:45] I'm not going to get too far into that
[1:31:47] but I just want to talk about the
[1:31:48] natures about the characteristics of the
[1:31:51] two spirits
[1:31:53] Cain has characteristics and a spirit
[1:31:55] yeah
[1:31:57] but so does Seth and Abel
[1:32:01] because they're of their father Adam
[1:32:03] but we know Cain isn't
[1:32:07] it verse 3 take heed to yourselves If
[1:32:08] thy brother trespass against thee rebuke
[1:32:11] him and if he repent forgive him
[1:32:13] and if he trespasses against thee seven
[1:32:16] times in a day and seven times in a day
[1:32:20] turn again to thee saying I repent
[1:32:24] what does the word say
[1:32:26] oh man you did it one too many times I
[1:32:29] can't do it
[1:32:30] no we just went a little too far
[1:32:33] no that's not what the word says right
[1:32:35] the word of God here
[1:32:37] I'm just going to dwell on some
[1:32:38] scripture for a bit I hope it's okay
[1:32:41] if he trespassed against these seven
[1:32:43] times in a day and seven times in a day
[1:32:45] turn again to thee saying I Repent thou
[1:32:47] shall forgive him
[1:32:49] and the Apostle said unto him Lord
[1:32:51] increase our faith and I just think you
[1:32:53] know I want to say to us
[1:32:55] I say those words myself I believe that
[1:32:58] that is the bride's Revival Lord
[1:33:01] increase my faith
[1:33:03] because outside of his faith we're never
[1:33:06] going to get it
[1:33:08] we need more faith today than any other
[1:33:10] age brother Branham said because we're
[1:33:12] looking for rapturing faith in this age
[1:33:14] we're not looking to be church members
[1:33:17] and just be Association associate
[1:33:20] members I belong to a good church so I
[1:33:23] could get a letter for employment if
[1:33:24] that's what I want or maybe to enter a
[1:33:26] school or to immigrate to a different
[1:33:28] country I belong to Calvary Living Word
[1:33:30] assembly brothers and sisters that'll
[1:33:32] put you in Tribulation
[1:33:35] one of these days the bride's going to
[1:33:37] be gone
[1:33:39] and I trust that we'll all be there and
[1:33:42] nobody will come to church
[1:33:47] one of the things that can be a real
[1:33:49] problem is forgiveness
[1:33:51] the real problem
[1:33:55] Matthew 18 verse 21.
[1:33:59] then came Peter to him and said Lord how
[1:34:02] oft
[1:34:03] en shall my brother sin against me and I
[1:34:05] forgive him till seven times
[1:34:09] Jesus saith unto him
[1:34:11] I say not unto thee
[1:34:13] until seven times
[1:34:16] but until Seventy Times Seven
[1:34:20] how many times is that brother Mervin do
[1:34:23] you know that
[1:34:24] 490
[1:34:26] I remember brother Ken he talked about
[1:34:28] this he taught this and he said that so
[1:34:31] many times
[1:34:33] that you just couldn't even actually sin
[1:34:35] that many times in a day
[1:34:38] there's no possible way that you would
[1:34:39] be able to do that kind of offense to
[1:34:42] another human being on Earth and go to
[1:34:44] him and say forgive me for it in a day
[1:34:46] it's just not possible but that's what
[1:34:49] Jesus is pointing out it doesn't matter
[1:34:51] how many times somebody offends you or
[1:34:54] steps on your toes or trespasses against
[1:34:56] you forgiveness is free for the Bride of
[1:34:59] Jesus Christ she offers it willingly
[1:35:01] because she recognizes that she has free
[1:35:03] forgiveness
[1:35:06] and I think I'll probably get into it as
[1:35:07] one of the scriptures but we know the
[1:35:09] story the story about the man who had
[1:35:12] someone that owed him money
[1:35:14] and and and he went to him and said you
[1:35:16] know I need you to pay the debt and the
[1:35:18] guy said I don't get the money I can't
[1:35:19] pay you sorry man and what did the guy
[1:35:21] do he said oh throw him in jail this
[1:35:23] guy's terrible
[1:35:25] and what happened the king found out
[1:35:27] about it and he said you know no no no
[1:35:29] that's okay I'll pay his debt don't
[1:35:31] worry about it I'll look after his debt
[1:35:34] get him out of jail we'll bring him out
[1:35:36] I'm probably quoting it wrong but you
[1:35:37] understand the scripture I'm talking
[1:35:39] about
[1:35:40] bring him out of prison and I'll cover
[1:35:41] his debt
[1:35:43] and then what happened the guy that got
[1:35:45] saved he went to one of his friends he
[1:35:48] got a little puffed up he got a little
[1:35:49] bit of Revelation
[1:35:52] something happened maybe he heard
[1:35:53] something and he just got a little bit
[1:35:55] jazzed up and he went to one of his
[1:35:57] buddies and said now pay me my debt
[1:36:00] and you're not going to do it and he
[1:36:01] took him and threw him in jail and the
[1:36:03] King found out about that and he said
[1:36:05] you know what
[1:36:06] that's not gonna fly
[1:36:08] and that was for an example brothers and
[1:36:10] sisters if we've been given Grace freely
[1:36:15] how could we Harbor anything
[1:36:21] because the word of God says to go to
[1:36:22] your brother
[1:36:23] go to your sister
[1:36:25] and you know I want to say this I think
[1:36:28] it's such a beautiful thing because you
[1:36:30] know what you're doing when you're
[1:36:31] harboring something you're hindering
[1:36:32] both you and that other person
[1:36:35] but you can set that other person free
[1:36:39] and you can look at it selfishly and say
[1:36:41] you know what this isn't for them it's
[1:36:43] for me and in some cases that's exactly
[1:36:45] the way it's got to be sometimes people
[1:36:47] will hurt people in ways that there's no
[1:36:50] way that you could ever make it right
[1:36:53] you could never fix it on this side of
[1:36:55] Eternity
[1:36:56] sometimes people do that sometimes it's
[1:36:58] willingly sometimes it's by accident
[1:37:01] so I'm not going to pretend here we're
[1:37:03] living in a real world
[1:37:05] I don't want you to think that I'm
[1:37:06] trying to talk about something from a a
[1:37:09] pie in the sky perspective we live in a
[1:37:11] real world here things happen
[1:37:14] but you know what happens when things
[1:37:16] happen is what makes the difference
[1:37:20] things are going to happen offenses are
[1:37:21] going to come we read that already but
[1:37:24] what do we do when they do
[1:37:26] that shows Who We Are
[1:37:31] Jesus saith unto him
[1:37:34] I say not unto thee until seven times
[1:37:37] but until Seventy Times Seven until you
[1:37:39] can't forgive anymore
[1:37:41] because he can't actually tell you the
[1:37:43] offenses there's no way that you will
[1:37:46] ever be able to not forgive
[1:37:49] and you know
[1:37:50] in Romans 14.
[1:37:53] verse 7.
[1:37:56] none of us
[1:37:57] liveth to himself
[1:38:00] and no man dieth to himself
[1:38:04] I could just pause there for a little
[1:38:05] bit
[1:38:06] do you ever think about that
[1:38:09] none of us live to ourselves and none of
[1:38:11] us die to ourselves
[1:38:13] something is causing us to live
[1:38:16] and when we die something causes us to
[1:38:18] die
[1:38:19] there's no accidental living
[1:38:22] and there's no accidental dying in this
[1:38:24] world
[1:38:25] some people might say oh now you're
[1:38:26] getting a little bit out there brother
[1:38:28] Barry because sometimes there are
[1:38:31] accidental births but I want to say this
[1:38:33] Arthur
[1:38:37] God knows every single thing that's
[1:38:39] happening
[1:38:40] he knows exactly when it's going to
[1:38:42] happen and how it's going to happen he's
[1:38:43] not surprised by nothing
[1:38:45] not surprised by nothing
[1:38:49] for none of us live to himself and no
[1:38:51] man dieth to himself for whether we live
[1:38:54] we live unto the Lord and whether we die
[1:38:57] we die unto the Lord
[1:38:59] whether we live therefore or die we are
[1:39:03] the Lords
[1:39:05] for to this end Christ both died and
[1:39:08] Rose and revived that he might be both
[1:39:11] Lord might be lowered both of the living
[1:39:14] and the dead
[1:39:16] but verse 10 is what I want to get to
[1:39:18] brothers and sisters recognizing that we
[1:39:20] live and we die because God chooses us
[1:39:22] to but then we get to verse 10 but why
[1:39:24] Dost thou judge thy brother
[1:39:29] well our Brother's Keeper
[1:39:32] why do thou judge our brother or why
[1:39:34] Dost thou set at not thy brother
[1:39:38] for we shall all stand before the
[1:39:39] Judgment seat of Christ
[1:39:43] for it is written as I
[1:39:45] live saith the Lord every knee shall bow
[1:39:49] to me and every tongue shall confess to
[1:39:51] God
[1:39:52] so that every one of us shall give an
[1:39:55] account of himself to God
[1:39:57] let us not therefore judge one another
[1:39:59] anymore
[1:40:03] but judge this rather
[1:40:05] that no man put a stumbling block
[1:40:08] or an occasion to fall in his brother's
[1:40:10] way
[1:40:11] this is the word of God we are a
[1:40:14] Brother's Keeper
[1:40:16] we are interceding for our brothers we
[1:40:19] are interceding for our sisters we are
[1:40:22] interceding for our brothers and sisters
[1:40:25] children
[1:40:27] we are a body of Believers here
[1:40:30] we are our Brother's Keeper
[1:40:34] and I just want to say it again as soon
[1:40:36] as we start to not be our brother our
[1:40:37] Sister's Keeper there's another spirit
[1:40:39] is there and you know brothers and
[1:40:41] sisters it's always going to be there
[1:40:43] trying to needle at us trying to get in
[1:40:46] our way trying to stumble us
[1:40:48] but are we still throwing a stumbling
[1:40:50] block in our brother or sister's way or
[1:40:52] are we actually clearing a stumbling
[1:40:53] block out of the way and you know what
[1:40:55] maybe they won't even know it do we need
[1:40:57] to go and tell them oh I saved you from
[1:40:59] this oh I prevented you from that
[1:41:04] what good is that maybe it will help
[1:41:06] them but are we looking for a pat on the
[1:41:07] back is that what we're doing
[1:41:09] that's not the word of God
[1:41:15] I made a note here let's just turn over
[1:41:17] to Romans
[1:41:19] chapter 14 for a second
[1:41:30] Romans chapter 14.
[1:41:33] we just read verse 7.
[1:41:37] 7 to 13.
[1:41:42] this read 13 let us not therefore judge
[1:41:44] one another anymore but judge this
[1:41:46] rather that no man put a stumbling block
[1:41:48] or an occasion to fall in his brother's
[1:41:51] way
[1:41:51] let's jump down to verse 21.
[1:41:57] it is good neither to eat flesh nor to
[1:42:00] drink wine nor anything whereby thy
[1:42:03] brother stumbleth or is offended
[1:42:06] or is made weak
[1:42:09] and what might seem like a stretch and a
[1:42:11] little bit out there but I believe
[1:42:13] there's a real important point with that
[1:42:15] if somebody comes to us and and says you
[1:42:19] know what I saw you do this certain
[1:42:20] thing and I'm wondering about it
[1:42:23] is it necessary for us to do it
[1:42:27] it could be we know that Paul said all
[1:42:29] things are lawful even though they're
[1:42:31] all lawful they might not be expedient
[1:42:34] and you know if we can take whatever a
[1:42:36] brother or sister brings to us and then
[1:42:37] go back to the prophet and the message
[1:42:39] and see what he said about it
[1:42:41] if it is truly according to the word of
[1:42:43] God likely it's going to be in the
[1:42:44] message of the hour and and if it is an
[1:42:47] offense
[1:42:48] then why would we want to do it I
[1:42:50] believe we wouldn't want to do it as a
[1:42:53] believer
[1:42:54] and you know what I'll say this I'll
[1:42:56] just say it openly
[1:42:58] people might mock me forward or judge me
[1:43:00] for it but it's okay we all have our own
[1:43:03] Revelation to live by
[1:43:04] I had somebody come and say to me
[1:43:07] somebody saw a picture of you wearing
[1:43:09] shorts
[1:43:11] and they were offended by it
[1:43:13] and I I actually kind of scratched my
[1:43:16] head about it because the word of God
[1:43:17] says to go to your brother not go to
[1:43:19] another brother and have that brother go
[1:43:21] but that's okay
[1:43:23] I took it to heart immediately I got a
[1:43:25] little bit offended myself and thought
[1:43:26] why would this be why what's the big
[1:43:28] deal what's you know what
[1:43:30] go and look it up check it out in the
[1:43:32] message of the hour
[1:43:34] seek the face of God and see what he has
[1:43:36] to say about it
[1:43:39] does it line up with the word of God
[1:43:40] does it line up with the message of the
[1:43:42] hour that's up to you to decide I won't
[1:43:45] say it I just know what it meant to me
[1:43:47] as a Believer and to have someone
[1:43:50] actually say it obviously God wanted me
[1:43:53] to see something about it and you know
[1:43:55] what it did was it gave me the ability
[1:43:57] to say really I don't care whether I
[1:44:00] wear shorts or not really is that going
[1:44:03] to be something that I'm willing to
[1:44:04] fight over and have a an issue about and
[1:44:08] struggle and say you know what I I come
[1:44:11] out of the world I come from a different
[1:44:13] world than the message of the hour and I
[1:44:15] took so many things in my life and just
[1:44:17] laid them down and threw it away and
[1:44:19] said I don't care I want to follow the
[1:44:21] word of God I want to follow all that
[1:44:23] God has for me in my life whatever he
[1:44:25] says do I want to do that
[1:44:28] how many people have heard the voice of
[1:44:30] God Echo from the clouds down through
[1:44:33] the air to them specifically a message
[1:44:37] has anybody
[1:44:39] nobody
[1:44:40] I haven't either
[1:44:42] but I'll tell you what I've heard God
[1:44:43] speak to me do you a brother or a sister
[1:44:46] have you
[1:44:49] he uses man
[1:44:51] he doesn't have a voice on earth except
[1:44:54] for human beings and you know what if
[1:44:57] the human beings won't cry out he said
[1:45:00] the rocks will immediately cry out
[1:45:03] but if we won't cry out
[1:45:05] he could just use a donkey
[1:45:09] I wouldn't say that any human being is
[1:45:11] I'm not saying that don't get me wrong
[1:45:12] what I am saying is we know a scriptural
[1:45:14] account Balaam and balak in the Bible
[1:45:17] The Madness of a prophet God spoke he
[1:45:21] had a donkey speak
[1:45:24] but none of us have heard the voice of
[1:45:26] God where he he Thunders from the clouds
[1:45:28] and we get the message but if somebody
[1:45:31] says something to us what's our reaction
[1:45:33] and this is my point brothers and
[1:45:35] sisters tying it back to the scripture
[1:45:37] this morning what spirit is inside of us
[1:45:40] is it one to say am I My Brother's
[1:45:42] Keeper I don't care who came and told me
[1:45:45] that that's their problem they should
[1:45:46] come and tell me themselves if they're a
[1:45:48] real mature believer is that what I said
[1:45:50] no I said Lord are you speaking to me I
[1:45:53] want to get right with the Lord I'm not
[1:45:55] so worried about a brother or a sister
[1:45:57] although I am because I don't want to
[1:45:58] cast a stumbling block
[1:46:00] and you know what it might not affect a
[1:46:02] brother or a sister but what about their
[1:46:04] children
[1:46:06] we are our Brother's Keeper
[1:46:10] we are
[1:46:16] let us therefore
[1:46:18] let us not therefore judge one another
[1:46:21] anymore
[1:46:22] I'm judging with one another anymore
[1:46:25] let's judge ourselves
[1:46:27] let's judge ourselves according to the
[1:46:29] word of God and just see whether we line
[1:46:31] up with the word of God
[1:46:35] but I love how he says this but judge
[1:46:37] this rather if you want to judge
[1:46:38] something judge this rather
[1:46:40] that no man put a stumbling block or an
[1:46:43] occasion to fall in his brother's way
[1:46:46] how easy it could be for us
[1:46:48] to cast a stumbling block in front of a
[1:46:51] brother or a sister
[1:46:52] by our Behavior
[1:46:54] we've talked about it before I'll say it
[1:46:56] again I just feel that too I guess but
[1:46:58] we could just have a little wine for the
[1:47:00] stomach's sake and it's just fine isn't
[1:47:02] it
[1:47:03] it is some people cook with it I'm not
[1:47:06] going to judge anyone for it but if
[1:47:09] somebody comes to your house and opens
[1:47:10] your fridge and sees a bottle of wine
[1:47:11] what message does that send
[1:47:13] what's the signal that you're showing
[1:47:17] some people might even be bold enough to
[1:47:19] sit back after a a a week of work and
[1:47:22] just unwind with a glass of wine I'm not
[1:47:25] here to judge you but what are your kids
[1:47:27] seeing
[1:47:28] and then if your kids go and start doing
[1:47:30] something else maybe we'll scratch our
[1:47:32] head and say why are they doing that
[1:47:34] well we maybe gave them an occasion for
[1:47:36] a stumbling block in their way
[1:47:41] I think we just
[1:47:42] I don't know I I I I I I
[1:47:45] feel like I want to say I'm sorry but I
[1:47:48] I just felt so led to go this way we are
[1:47:51] our Brother's Keeper brothers and
[1:47:52] sisters and I believe as the Bride of
[1:47:55] Jesus Christ it behooves us
[1:47:57] to make sure that we're not casting
[1:47:59] stumbling blocks that we are encouraging
[1:48:02] that we're not judging
[1:48:05] if we're judging what spirit is that
[1:48:09] if someone's doing wrong then you go to
[1:48:11] your brother and say hey you're doing
[1:48:13] wrong
[1:48:14] according to the word of God
[1:48:17] and I I'm so thankful that I had a
[1:48:19] pastor that said if you do it
[1:48:21] as a mature Christian you're going to do
[1:48:24] it in love
[1:48:25] right you're not going to come and say
[1:48:29] you're a sinner
[1:48:32] I see this in you
[1:48:33] and you and and right you're not going
[1:48:35] to do that you're going to come and love
[1:48:37] and say brother sister there's this
[1:48:39] thing and I just don't know how to get
[1:48:40] around it and I just I just want to come
[1:48:42] according to the word of God and I pray
[1:48:44] that you you and I could just get
[1:48:46] together and have a coffee and maybe a
[1:48:47] word of prayer and just talk about this
[1:48:49] thing
[1:48:51] and you know what sometimes the things
[1:48:52] that we see with our eyes aren't
[1:48:54] actually what's happening
[1:48:56] and that's why the word of God says we
[1:48:58] need to go to our brother because we can
[1:49:00] be judging under the surface of not
[1:49:02] knowing what's going on
[1:49:07] we know the disciples in Matthew chapter
[1:49:08] 6 they said to Jesus
[1:49:10] teach us to pray
[1:49:12] how do we pray how should we pray Lord
[1:49:16] and we know this is very familiar very
[1:49:18] familiar scripture here
[1:49:20] Jesus said after this manner therefore
[1:49:22] praying
[1:49:23] Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed
[1:49:25] be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:49:27] done on Earth as it is in heaven give us
[1:49:28] this day our daily bread and forgive us
[1:49:31] our debts
[1:49:32] as what as we forgive
[1:49:36] our debtors
[1:49:38] amen not saying that we don't need to
[1:49:40] pair that's brothers and sisters what
[1:49:42] I'm saying is Jesus is setting an
[1:49:44] example here to say look
[1:49:46] don't hold on to money so tightly or
[1:49:49] good so tightly that you can't actually
[1:49:51] just forgive a debt
[1:49:53] because there's times in our lives
[1:49:55] that's going to be the best thing for us
[1:49:57] because what that could be is simply the
[1:49:59] devil just at our door waiting to see
[1:50:02] our reaction to the situation if a
[1:50:04] brother or sister just doesn't pay their
[1:50:05] debt if they're not good for it
[1:50:07] then what happens what spirit is going
[1:50:10] to come out of us in that moment right
[1:50:11] we need to be able to forgive our debts
[1:50:15] to our our brothers and our sisters
[1:50:17] verse 13 says and lead us not into
[1:50:19] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[1:50:20] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[1:50:23] the glory forever amen
[1:50:25] verse 14 for if ye forgive men their
[1:50:28] trespasses
[1:50:30] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:50:32] you
[1:50:35] who doesn't want forgiveness this
[1:50:36] morning
[1:50:37] every one of us do
[1:50:40] but verse 15 I think is the is is the
[1:50:43] Crux of it all
[1:50:45] but if ye forgive not men their
[1:50:46] trespasses
[1:50:48] neither will your father forgive your
[1:50:51] trespasses
[1:50:54] it's heavy
[1:50:57] I can tell you by experience sometimes
[1:50:59] people do things to us
[1:51:01] that can't be fixed on this side of
[1:51:03] Eternity
[1:51:05] they can say sorry however many times
[1:51:07] they want
[1:51:08] they can maybe repent with dust and
[1:51:11] Ashes
[1:51:13] all they want
[1:51:15] and they will never be able to actually
[1:51:17] fix the situation
[1:51:19] I can give you an example I know a young
[1:51:21] man we prayed for him he made a terrible
[1:51:23] mistake driving out of a golf course
[1:51:25] having a few drinks while he was playing
[1:51:27] and what happened accidentally
[1:51:31] while he was in the moment people will
[1:51:33] say it wasn't an accident because he
[1:51:35] chose to do that and that's where I'll
[1:51:36] stand with it we make decisions
[1:51:39] and if we make bad decisions to get
[1:51:40] behind the wheel while we're drinking he
[1:51:43] actually killed a man
[1:51:44] accidentally
[1:51:46] he didn't mean to kill a man
[1:51:48] but he chose to get in the vehicle with
[1:51:50] alcohol on him
[1:51:52] and we know that brother Branham said
[1:51:54] that should be capital murder
[1:51:56] it's not an easy thing how can you ever
[1:51:59] fix that situation how could you ever
[1:52:01] bring Comfort to that Widow how could
[1:52:03] you ever bring Comfort to the children
[1:52:04] it was one week before that he gave his
[1:52:07] daughter away in a wedding
[1:52:11] I could go on and on about it and I
[1:52:13] don't want to belabor the fact my point
[1:52:15] is things can happen that you cannot
[1:52:17] undo
[1:52:19] but the word of God says that you need
[1:52:21] to forgive their trespasses
[1:52:24] that's all doesn't say whether they're
[1:52:27] big ones whether they're small ones
[1:52:30] whether they're terrible ones whether
[1:52:32] they're minor ones whether they're
[1:52:34] fixable or unfixable or forgive their
[1:52:36] trespasses that's it
[1:52:38] and if you don't do that he won't
[1:52:40] forgive yours
[1:52:43] so whose characteristics are we
[1:52:45] displaying
[1:52:49] you know we're having a conversation and
[1:52:51] I think it's so good so amazing to look
[1:52:55] at
[1:52:56] many times we can look at the scripture
[1:52:58] that says you know you can talk about me
[1:53:01] Jesus talking to the disciples and the
[1:53:03] Pharisees and the Sadducees you could
[1:53:05] talk about me all you want you can
[1:53:07] slander me all you want but one of these
[1:53:09] days the Holy Ghost is coming and you
[1:53:11] say one word against him and that will
[1:53:14] never be forgiven you
[1:53:16] so I want to say this this morning this
[1:53:18] was our conversation we were having
[1:53:20] if our brother our sister has the Holy
[1:53:22] Ghost in their life
[1:53:24] and we say one word against our brother
[1:53:25] or sister
[1:53:27] what are we saying
[1:53:30] I would say we're venturing into very
[1:53:32] dangerous Waters
[1:53:34] very dangerous Waters
[1:53:36] many times I thought for the longest
[1:53:38] time well if we say something about
[1:53:40] maybe the the prophet for our day that
[1:53:43] could be blaspheming or maybe we say
[1:53:45] something about the word of God I just
[1:53:47] don't see it that way or or maybe uh
[1:53:49] something about the scripture or Jesus I
[1:53:52] or even the holy ghost in the day of
[1:53:55] Pentecost maybe sort of nebulous out
[1:53:57] there if someone's baptized and filled
[1:53:59] with the Holy Ghost and we say something
[1:54:00] against them brothers and sisters beware
[1:54:02] you could potentially be saying
[1:54:04] something against the Holy Ghost in that
[1:54:06] brother or that sister's life
[1:54:09] and that will never be forgiven is what
[1:54:10] the word of God says
[1:54:13] that to me is powerful that's amazing
[1:54:15] that that is sobering to think I say
[1:54:19] Lord forgive me because I know brothers
[1:54:20] and sisters I'm not going to pretend for
[1:54:22] a second I've said things about brothers
[1:54:23] and sisters that I know today have been
[1:54:26] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:54:29] but I believe I've got a quote for it
[1:54:31] brother Branham says there's forgiveness
[1:54:32] for it
[1:54:34] if you're willing to get forgiven if
[1:54:37] you're willing to do it
[1:54:39] but you got to do the harder work man
[1:54:41] you got to go and see someone and say
[1:54:43] look I don't know I'm
[1:54:45] I'm kind of sorry about what I said or
[1:54:47] did or thought you know I I maybe went
[1:54:50] too far and you know when that person
[1:54:52] does have the Holy Ghost they're going
[1:54:53] to say you know don't even worry about
[1:54:55] it Matt don't think about it it's cool
[1:54:56] we're good are we good fist bump can we
[1:54:59] just go forwards and not have to worry
[1:55:01] about it it's not going to be well
[1:55:02] really you said that about me oh my
[1:55:05] let's have an inquisition I want to call
[1:55:07] another brother witness here to hear
[1:55:09] that you said that about me and make a
[1:55:11] big deal that's not the Bride of Jesus
[1:55:12] Christ
[1:55:14] right of Jesus Christ has endless Grace
[1:55:16] just like God has for his bride it's
[1:55:20] exactly the way it is it's not judgment
[1:55:23] Grace that's Mercy just like many of the
[1:55:27] scriptures many of the gospels while
[1:55:28] while Paul was in prison how he started
[1:55:31] them was Grace and peace unto you from
[1:55:35] God our Father which art in Heaven Grace
[1:55:38] and peace unto you not judgment and
[1:55:41] Scorn
[1:55:44] Mark 11 25 and when you stand praying
[1:55:46] forgive if ye have ought against any
[1:55:48] that your father also which is in heaven
[1:55:51] May forgive you your trespasses but if
[1:55:54] you do not forgive neither will your
[1:55:55] father which is in heaven forgive your
[1:55:56] trespasses
[1:55:58] sometimes it can be very difficult for
[1:56:00] us to do but I promise you brothers and
[1:56:02] sisters just like getting saved if you
[1:56:05] truly want to be saved and you genuinely
[1:56:07] come to the Lord and you say Lord I'm
[1:56:09] ready I'm willing and I'm able and I
[1:56:12] believe you with all my heart I want you
[1:56:13] to save me I want I want to pray maybe
[1:56:16] the sinner's prayer and have you come
[1:56:18] into my heart and be my savior
[1:56:20] what's he gonna do
[1:56:22] he's gonna save you
[1:56:24] and once that happens it's the
[1:56:26] justification sanctification then the
[1:56:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost you go and you
[1:56:30] get cleansed out you get set aside you
[1:56:31] go and you get baptized in water is the
[1:56:33] outward expression of the inward work
[1:56:35] whether you get the Holy Ghost after
[1:56:36] whether you get the Holy Ghost before
[1:56:38] the desire in your heart is what he
[1:56:40] knows and he will give you the comforter
[1:56:42] if that's truly what you desire
[1:56:46] and when that happens
[1:56:48] you can't have another spirit
[1:56:51] and and if there is another Spirit the
[1:56:53] word of God says to take every thought
[1:56:55] into captivity
[1:56:56] and control those thoughts control that
[1:56:59] other spirit that wants to get a hold of
[1:57:01] us and cause us to act out and behave in
[1:57:03] certain ways
[1:57:05] the blood speaks brothers and sisters
[1:57:09] out of 1963 the token
[1:57:12] it's zero nine zero one m
[1:57:17] Paul tells us
[1:57:19] that the blood speaks
[1:57:23] and we know that we read that in the
[1:57:25] scripture this morning that the blood
[1:57:27] speaks
[1:57:29] when Cain
[1:57:30] slew Abel
[1:57:32] he was in the field his blood spilled on
[1:57:35] the ground
[1:57:36] his blood is what called out to God
[1:57:41] I'm I'm pretty sure the prophet of God
[1:57:43] said that his blood is what caught God
[1:57:45] called called God on the scene
[1:57:48] his blood was calling out
[1:57:50] and it's interesting if you think about
[1:57:52] it I I don't know if there's an account
[1:57:54] of anyone else that died before Abel
[1:57:58] but could you imagine being number one
[1:58:01] in heaven
[1:58:02] or in Paradise
[1:58:04] the very first one there
[1:58:07] do we have it up
[1:58:10] Paul tells us that the blood speaks
[1:58:15] that anyone knows that the blood is
[1:58:18] actually itself can't speak
[1:58:21] it's a chemistry is that right
[1:58:24] how many knows that
[1:58:25] but how many knows that the blood speaks
[1:58:30] that's a paradox isn't it
[1:58:33] it's incredible but it's true
[1:58:35] the blood doesn't speak because it's a
[1:58:37] chemical but yet the blood speaks how is
[1:58:39] that
[1:58:40] how many knows that he says but how many
[1:58:42] knows that the blood speaks if you want
[1:58:45] to put that down Genesis 4 10 God said
[1:58:47] what about your brother
[1:58:49] said his blood cries from the earth
[1:58:51] against you that right
[1:58:54] his blood is speaking Hallelujah
[1:58:58] God said what about him
[1:59:01] he said am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:59:04] said and his blood is crying out his
[1:59:07] blood is a crying out
[1:59:09] it's a token
[1:59:12] it's a token that he had been killed his
[1:59:15] blood was crying out against him
[1:59:19] now if you get that in Genesis 4 10 then
[1:59:22] in Hebrews 12 24 start reading in
[1:59:24] Hebrews 10 12 24 said the blood of Jesus
[1:59:29] speaketh better things than that of Abel
[1:59:32] see Abel he was a righteous man he died
[1:59:36] he died innocent because he was in the
[1:59:39] way he was in the way standing for the
[1:59:43] real Revelation he had
[1:59:46] he spoke
[1:59:47] it cried out
[1:59:49] the Justice blood of Abel cried out
[1:59:52] against Cain
[1:59:57] but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:59:59] not only cried out it redeemed
[2:00:02] amen and speaketh better things it makes
[2:00:05] you sons and daughters
[2:00:08] this is where I said there's a quote
[2:00:10] brothers and sisters if we have said
[2:00:12] things if we have even acted things
[2:00:15] stumbling blocks what have you things
[2:00:18] left unresolved
[2:00:21] he speaks
[2:00:23] speaks on our behalf
[2:00:25] remember the story of brother Bradham in
[2:00:27] that in that Tavern
[2:00:29] that little place
[2:00:31] going in and he saw the policeman and
[2:00:34] the woman the ill-famed woman and the
[2:00:36] other guy and they're playing slot
[2:00:38] machines and he's got his hand around
[2:00:40] her and she's dressed immorally and he's
[2:00:42] just disgusted with the situation the
[2:00:44] Vindicated Prophet for our age
[2:00:48] and what did he do
[2:00:50] he got up and he left he went to the
[2:00:52] washroom and he cried out to God and
[2:00:54] said oh Lord I I just wish you would do
[2:00:56] something with this just wipe it off the
[2:00:58] map and he went into a vision
[2:01:01] and when he went into the vision
[2:01:03] he saw Jesus
[2:01:06] and he saw when he called the bumper of
[2:01:08] blood
[2:01:09] and he saw sins coming out of the earth
[2:01:12] and going up and hitting Jesus
[2:01:15] hurting him
[2:01:16] not just hitting him but hurting him
[2:01:20] and the sins kept coming and the sins
[2:01:22] kept coming and and he said oh my
[2:01:26] the end of the story is he he said oh
[2:01:29] that immoral woman that was and the man
[2:01:31] there that was that was their sins and
[2:01:34] God said to him no no no no no that's
[2:01:36] not their sins that's your sins as the
[2:01:38] Vindicated prophet
[2:01:40] can you imagine that
[2:01:42] oh my I say I don't even stand a chance
[2:01:44] then but I'll tell you what I'm
[2:01:46] certainly thankful for that bumper of
[2:01:48] blood
[2:01:50] because brothers and sisters that blood
[2:01:52] that was shed at Calvary speaks on our
[2:01:54] behalf
[2:01:56] that blood gives us the ability to
[2:01:59] forgive our brothers and our sisters
[2:02:01] because that blood gives us
[2:02:03] unconditional forgiveness
[2:02:09] but the blood of Jesus Christ not only
[2:02:11] cried out it redeemed amen and speaketh
[2:02:13] better things it makes you Sons and
[2:02:15] Daughters it hides you from the wrath of
[2:02:18] God see the blood of Abel could not hide
[2:02:21] Cain
[2:02:22] see
[2:02:24] but the blood of Jesus can
[2:02:28] you imagine that he's saying the blood
[2:02:29] of Jesus
[2:02:32] could hide Cain
[2:02:34] he goes on to say so old Cain come out
[2:02:36] today
[2:02:37] if you've been a persecuted shooter
[2:02:40] against the word and say days of
[2:02:42] Miracles has passed this thing is all
[2:02:44] nonsense in things
[2:02:46] he says it's crying out you see the
[2:02:49] blood of Jesus Christ Cries Out
[2:02:52] but there is forgiveness in it if you'll
[2:02:54] just accept it
[2:02:57] wish we could stay there a while on that
[2:02:59] sea
[2:03:00] blood speaketh a better thing
[2:03:03] isn't it interesting in the scripture
[2:03:05] here
[2:03:07] I've been studying this for a while and
[2:03:10] Cain we read this earlier
[2:03:13] Cain
[2:03:14] he said you know what this this is more
[2:03:17] than I could bear because he was the
[2:03:18] tiller of the ground remember
[2:03:21] and now the ground that he tilled and we
[2:03:24] could only imagine how good his Harvest
[2:03:26] was how good the Harvest of his Fields
[2:03:29] were before the curse in his life
[2:03:33] but once he actually murdered his
[2:03:36] brother and lied about it
[2:03:39] God said cursed is the ground for your
[2:03:41] sake you you will no longer be able to
[2:03:43] do what you did and you will be run out
[2:03:45] of the guard and you will no longer have
[2:03:47] your first estate
[2:03:49] you'll be a vagabond in the earth and
[2:03:52] that's what he said to God oh no now my
[2:03:54] curse is way more than I could bear
[2:03:55] because everyone that finds me they're
[2:03:56] going to send they're going to kill me
[2:03:58] they're going to want to destroy me
[2:03:59] because I'm out from the presence of God
[2:04:02] it's amazing to think about
[2:04:04] but what happened was
[2:04:06] God set the mark of the beast on that
[2:04:09] man
[2:04:10] the very first one to have the mark of
[2:04:12] the beast
[2:04:13] and I believe myself just my view that
[2:04:16] was brother bradham's Trail of the
[2:04:18] serpent the beginning of it right there
[2:04:20] at the Garden of Eden
[2:04:22] here we have him now he's set with a
[2:04:25] mark what Mark was that that wasn't the
[2:04:27] token of the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:04:31] that was the mark of the beast his daddy
[2:04:33] the one that was actually there from the
[2:04:35] very beginning
[2:04:38] now I want to say today brothers and
[2:04:40] sisters
[2:04:42] we look at these scriptures and say you
[2:04:43] know Jesus was talking to his disciples
[2:04:45] and saying you know forgive people you
[2:04:48] don't want to hold on to stuff but where
[2:04:50] are we standing today as the Bride of
[2:04:52] Jesus Christ
[2:04:56] having the full message of the hour
[2:04:58] understanding that that angel descended
[2:05:00] with what an open book in his hand
[2:05:03] all of the seals open all of the
[2:05:05] Revelation all the loose ends tied up
[2:05:07] from from all the other ages Where Do We
[2:05:10] Stand are we further ahead now today
[2:05:12] than the disciples
[2:05:15] or are we still stumbling around groping
[2:05:17] around saying I've got this and I've got
[2:05:19] that and I just don't know how to do the
[2:05:21] other
[2:05:22] or do we say you know what we understand
[2:05:23] our position because
[2:05:26] when the church recognizes its position
[2:05:28] then the Rapture will go
[2:05:31] and I I say Lord help me I don't I'm not
[2:05:33] saying this to say that I've got a
[2:05:35] greater Revelation than anybody
[2:05:37] I would say that I'm the chiefest of
[2:05:39] Sinners I just find that God positioned
[2:05:41] me here and the only thing I could do is
[2:05:42] March forward and when he says March we
[2:05:45] got a March that's all
[2:05:47] huh
[2:05:48] but I think it's amazing because I can
[2:05:50] tell you firsthand I have learned a lot
[2:05:53] and as we go forwards it's just more and
[2:05:55] more and that's why we do this why we
[2:05:57] gathered a church so that we can stir up
[2:05:59] our Pure Minds by way of remember it so
[2:06:01] that we can shake off that spiritual
[2:06:03] Amnesia and and remember our first
[2:06:06] estate you know what we're not from this
[2:06:08] world we're from somewhere else
[2:06:16] so I just want to take it maybe from I
[2:06:18] know we were reading from the New
[2:06:19] Testament but I think it was sort of
[2:06:21] from maybe a little bit of an Old
[2:06:23] Testament perspective Jesus was bringing
[2:06:25] the new doctrine of the New Testament to
[2:06:27] just be able to forgive it's not an eye
[2:06:29] for an eye but what what I want to do is
[2:06:32] actually go forwards into sort of where
[2:06:35] the bride lives today according to
[2:06:36] scripture and you know what we've been
[2:06:39] given the ministry of reconciliation
[2:06:44] we're not given the ministry of judgment
[2:06:47] so if you turn with me to Second
[2:06:49] Corinthians chapter five
[2:06:51] let's just read this together I think
[2:06:52] it's so important
[2:06:54] it's so good it's so liberating
[2:06:57] it's so free
[2:06:59] gives us the ability to recognize really
[2:07:01] Where We Are Who We Are
[2:07:10] we're a lot more alike than we are
[2:07:12] different
[2:07:15] second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 18.
[2:07:19] and all things are of God
[2:07:22] who has reconciled us to himself by
[2:07:25] Jesus Christ
[2:07:26] and hath given to us
[2:07:29] the ministry of reconciliation
[2:07:33] not the ministry of division
[2:07:36] to it verse 19 that God was in Christ
[2:07:39] reconciling the world unto himself
[2:07:42] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[2:07:45] and hath committed unto us the word of
[2:07:49] reconciliation
[2:07:51] now then we are ambassadors for Christ
[2:07:53] as though God did beseech You by us we
[2:07:57] pray
[2:07:58] you in Christ's dead
[2:08:00] be ye reconciled to God
[2:08:04] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[2:08:08] who knew no sin
[2:08:10] that we may be the righteousness of God
[2:08:14] in him
[2:08:18] the gift of Grace
[2:08:20] unmerited favor
[2:08:22] we didn't deserve it
[2:08:25] many people would say well I've never
[2:08:27] done anything wrong in my life I've been
[2:08:29] a good person my whole entire life
[2:08:32] but the thing about it is
[2:08:34] we weren't supposed to be born the way
[2:08:36] that we were born
[2:08:37] and that's the critical Factor it took
[2:08:39] me a long time to actually have that
[2:08:41] unlock and that's why the initial thing
[2:08:44] that we were talking about here
[2:08:46] Cain
[2:08:47] Abel and Seth
[2:08:50] two acts and three sons
[2:08:52] it's a great mystery but once it becomes
[2:08:56] a revealed thing to us it gives us the
[2:08:59] ability to recognize really where we
[2:09:01] stand
[2:09:03] man and how incredible it is to have
[2:09:05] full reconciliation we're not bound by
[2:09:08] the chains of sin we don't have to be
[2:09:11] stuck in the situations that we're in If
[2:09:13] we Just Surrender ourselves unto the
[2:09:16] word we've talked about it in Ephesians
[2:09:18] chapter 5 for so long husbands you know
[2:09:22] love your wives wives submit yourselves
[2:09:25] unto your husbands children obey your
[2:09:26] parents in the Lord
[2:09:28] where it's the first commandment with
[2:09:30] promise we've studied that for a long
[2:09:33] long time but first before you get into
[2:09:35] any of that submit yourself one to
[2:09:37] another in the fear of God
[2:09:40] and if we can't do that then how can we
[2:09:42] ever go forwards as a body of Believers
[2:09:45] we've got to be willing to submit
[2:09:47] ourselves one to another in the fear of
[2:09:48] God and you know that's one of the
[2:09:50] reasons why we do have a communion foot
[2:09:52] washing
[2:09:54] because we recognize we're not just
[2:09:55] getting together to just weirdly wash
[2:09:58] each other's feet because we're a part
[2:09:59] of a cult we do it because the word of
[2:10:01] God says it
[2:10:03] and the word of God says happy are ye if
[2:10:06] ye do these things
[2:10:08] so when you do those things you
[2:10:10] recognize there's a purpose for it and
[2:10:12] the purpose for it is to recognize that
[2:10:14] if God the king of kings and Lord of
[2:10:17] lords would humble himself to come down
[2:10:19] into this filthy stinking Flesh on Earth
[2:10:23] and submit himself not just to be
[2:10:25] murdered and hung on a cross but to
[2:10:27] Humble himself beforehand and wash the
[2:10:29] feet of other human beings
[2:10:33] he brought himself down to be a foot
[2:10:34] wash flunky
[2:10:37] how much more we be willing to follow
[2:10:39] the word of God and recognize that my
[2:10:42] brother my sister
[2:10:44] they have the spirit of Christ I'm not
[2:10:46] washing my brother my sister's feet I'm
[2:10:47] washing Christ's feet I'm willing to
[2:10:50] just apply the word and allow the full
[2:10:53] blessing to unlock
[2:11:00] let's turn over to Ephesians
[2:11:02] chapter 2.
[2:11:05] a few scriptures today
[2:11:08] and we'll get into some quotes a little
[2:11:09] bit later
[2:11:12] I trust it's all right
[2:11:19] recognizing
[2:11:21] what we've been given
[2:11:23] because we've been forgiven
[2:11:27] and we didn't even ask for it how many
[2:11:29] asked for the Forgiveness before they
[2:11:31] received it
[2:11:33] Ephesians chapter 2 and you hath he
[2:11:36] quickened
[2:11:37] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[2:11:40] so whether we understand it or not we
[2:11:43] were born in sin
[2:11:46] that's the way we came into the world
[2:11:48] and you know we we're born in sin
[2:11:51] was shaped in iniquity what does it mean
[2:11:53] to be shaped in iniquity by doing things
[2:11:55] that we shouldn't be doing and by not
[2:11:58] doing the things that we should
[2:12:00] that's the definition of iniquity
[2:12:02] born in sin not the way that God had
[2:12:05] intended originally for his family in
[2:12:07] the Garden of Eden when he said to Adam
[2:12:09] and Eve go forth and multiply
[2:12:13] That was supposed to be a spoken word
[2:12:14] birth
[2:12:16] but because of the fall things changed
[2:12:18] so every single human being on Earth is
[2:12:21] born in sin shaped in iniquity
[2:12:23] and coming into the world speaking lies
[2:12:27] every single human being lies outside of
[2:12:30] the goodness of God in our lives outside
[2:12:31] of having his spirit in us every single
[2:12:34] one of us has told a lie
[2:12:36] there's no way around it it's the word
[2:12:38] of God
[2:12:39] whether it's a little child lying about
[2:12:41] a piece of candy or whatever the simple
[2:12:44] question is that mommy or daddy asked
[2:12:46] them or an adult sometimes as adults we
[2:12:48] tell lies oh my
[2:12:53] I can tell you as an adult I have
[2:12:55] why because I want to save my hide
[2:12:59] we know that Abraham did he was a
[2:13:01] backslidden prophet wasn't he twice he
[2:13:03] did it with his wife
[2:13:06] it's a totally different story
[2:13:08] but that's the way we come into this
[2:13:10] world we're born in sin shape to
[2:13:11] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[2:13:12] outside of the grace of God outside of
[2:13:15] recognizing what he's done for us his
[2:13:17] total absolute complete discharge from
[2:13:20] any of the charges or ordinances that
[2:13:21] were against us
[2:13:23] we would be doomed
[2:13:25] but here we have Ephesians chapter two I
[2:13:29] mean I would say I recommend it just
[2:13:31] read Ephesians chapter one to to Really
[2:13:33] expound upon what I'm talking about
[2:13:34] maybe when you go home sometime this
[2:13:36] week but Ephesians chapter 2 just for
[2:13:37] time's sake and you have to be quickened
[2:13:40] given life to that word Quicken means
[2:13:42] life you hathy Quicken who are dead in
[2:13:45] trespasses and sins wherein times past
[2:13:47] he walked according to the course of
[2:13:49] this world according to the prince of
[2:13:51] the power of the air that Cain spirit
[2:13:54] outside of Christ's spirit
[2:13:57] we have Cain spirit
[2:13:59] outside of the mark of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:02] the sealing of the Holy Ghost In Our
[2:14:04] Lives brothers and sisters we don't have
[2:14:05] to today because of the hybrid condition
[2:14:08] we're living in we don't have to run out
[2:14:10] and do something wrong to get the mark
[2:14:11] of the beast that's one of the false
[2:14:14] things that this world even around the
[2:14:16] message has taught that somewhere along
[2:14:18] the way you're going to be able to just
[2:14:19] go and get the mark of the beast outside
[2:14:22] of getting the holy ghost in your life
[2:14:24] you got it
[2:14:27] the token saves you from getting the
[2:14:29] mark of the beast to reject the Holy
[2:14:32] Ghost what brother Bradham said what God
[2:14:34] Said through brother Branham to reject
[2:14:36] the Holy Ghost is to accept the mark of
[2:14:38] the beast when the time comes that they
[2:14:41] put a mark on the back of the hand or on
[2:14:43] the forehead when that time comes he
[2:14:45] brother Branham does say that will come
[2:14:47] the bride will be long gone
[2:14:50] we don't want to be here for that don't
[2:14:51] look for that don't look for anything
[2:14:53] natural brothers and sisters it's a
[2:14:55] spiritual thing that we're talking about
[2:14:57] that's what's so important to us today
[2:14:59] to recognize our position to reject the
[2:15:02] Holy Ghost is to receive the mark of the
[2:15:04] beast and that is why I have harped on
[2:15:07] it and harped on it and will and will
[2:15:09] and will get the Holy Ghost if you don't
[2:15:11] got the Holy Ghost ask him for the Holy
[2:15:13] Ghost he'll give it to you
[2:15:15] and what's the Holy Ghost the message of
[2:15:18] the hour Christ himself
[2:15:20] wanting to live out through you
[2:15:22] remember in this age the laodicean
[2:15:24] church age this is the age that he's
[2:15:26] standing outside the door knocking to
[2:15:28] come in it's the only age where the
[2:15:30] church put him on the outside
[2:15:34] but if you open the door to him he'll
[2:15:36] come in and sup with you
[2:15:38] but remember that picture I think it was
[2:15:40] Hoffman that did the picture it shows
[2:15:41] Jesus on the outside of the door and
[2:15:44] brother Branham said the man he he said
[2:15:46] when you did that picture it looks
[2:15:48] really nice but you did something wrong
[2:15:49] you never put a handle on the outside he
[2:15:51] said no that's intentional the reason
[2:15:53] there's no handle out there is because
[2:15:54] the handle's on the inside the handles
[2:15:57] on the inside of the heart brothers and
[2:15:58] sisters if we want the Holy Ghost he's
[2:16:01] not going to force his way in
[2:16:03] we've got to open the door to him but he
[2:16:05] says that if you open that door unto me
[2:16:07] I'll come in unto you and sup with you
[2:16:11] he'll break the spread of Life open to
[2:16:13] us make it fresh every single time he'll
[2:16:15] make his mercy new to us every single
[2:16:17] day
[2:16:20] so whether we understand it or not we're
[2:16:22] born in sin-shaped and iniquity come to
[2:16:23] this world speaking lies I remember
[2:16:25] brother Ken teach him that and I didn't
[2:16:27] believe it for the first time I heard it
[2:16:28] I was like really but you don't have to
[2:16:30] teach a child to lie
[2:16:32] they don't have to be influenced by
[2:16:33] anybody
[2:16:34] they just have it inside on the inside
[2:16:37] of the inside it's just inside them to
[2:16:39] protect their hide
[2:16:40] where in times past you walked according
[2:16:42] to the course of the world of this world
[2:16:44] according to the prince of the power of
[2:16:46] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[2:16:48] the children of Disobedience who are the
[2:16:50] children of Disobedience anyone that
[2:16:52] rejects the Holy Ghost
[2:16:54] among whom we also had our conversation
[2:16:56] in times past in the lusts of our flesh
[2:16:59] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[2:17:01] of the Mind
[2:17:03] and where by Nature
[2:17:05] the children of Wrath
[2:17:07] even as others
[2:17:09] outside of receiving the word for our
[2:17:11] day brothers and sisters we're the same
[2:17:13] as everyone else
[2:17:14] there ain't no way that we can just
[2:17:16] dress ourselves up and join an
[2:17:18] association and just be I've been in the
[2:17:20] message my whole entire life there's
[2:17:21] nothing wrong if you have not received
[2:17:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's
[2:17:25] something very fundamentally wrong
[2:17:28] you have to have it
[2:17:30] otherwise we're just like the children
[2:17:32] of Wrath by Nature
[2:17:35] verse 4 I think is so critical
[2:17:37] but God who is rich in Mercy
[2:17:40] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[2:17:44] even when we were dead in sins hath
[2:17:46] quickened us together with Christ it
[2:17:49] says by Grace ye are saved but didn't
[2:17:53] just save us and leave us here did he
[2:17:55] and hath raised us up together and made
[2:17:57] us sit together in Heavenly places in
[2:18:00] Christ Jesus
[2:18:03] I just think to speak so much to us that
[2:18:05] in the ages to come he might show the
[2:18:07] exceeding Riches of his grace in his
[2:18:09] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[2:18:14] for by grace are ye saved through faith
[2:18:16] and not of yourselves
[2:18:18] not of yourselves not any one of us
[2:18:21] just because we recognized it one day
[2:18:23] doesn't mean that we're anything
[2:18:26] we we recognize how insignificant we
[2:18:29] truly are outside of the word of God
[2:18:31] that's what happens brother Branham says
[2:18:33] that true Revelation brothers and
[2:18:34] sisters doesn't puff us up
[2:18:36] doesn't give us the ability to say that
[2:18:38] I've been in a message my whole life and
[2:18:39] I have no scars in my life and there's
[2:18:41] nothing wrong with me in my life no true
[2:18:44] Revelation gives us the ability to say
[2:18:46] you know what outside of the grace of
[2:18:48] God but for the grace of God there go
[2:18:50] lie when I see all these addicts in the
[2:18:53] world when I see all of these problems
[2:18:54] in the world all these people with all
[2:18:56] the troubles oh my every single one of
[2:18:58] us would be subject to that I'm not
[2:19:00] trying to scold us but I just want to
[2:19:02] try and bring it out you know what we
[2:19:04] are all children of Wrath by Nature
[2:19:07] but God who is rich in Mercy
[2:19:11] he knew us before the foundation of the
[2:19:13] world and chose to express Us in this
[2:19:15] age to give us the ability to receive
[2:19:17] the word for our day and that gives us
[2:19:19] the ability to offer Grace and
[2:19:21] forgiveness to this world around us
[2:19:27] my
[2:19:30] in Colossians 2 verse 13 and you being
[2:19:33] dead in your sins
[2:19:34] and the uncircumcision of your flesh
[2:19:37] hath he quickened together with him
[2:19:38] having forgiven you
[2:19:41] all trespasses
[2:19:45] blotting out the handwriting of
[2:19:47] ordinances that was against us
[2:19:49] which was contrary to us
[2:19:52] and took it out of the way
[2:19:54] nailing it to his cross
[2:19:58] that blood it speaks better things for
[2:20:01] us brothers and sisters
[2:20:04] because we are our Brother's Keeper
[2:20:07] we are our Sister's Keeper
[2:20:11] we are our children's keeper
[2:20:15] it's up to us brothers and sisters to
[2:20:17] apply that token or the Branham said his
[2:20:19] parents were the token for our children
[2:20:21] until the age of accountability
[2:20:23] and I think that's so sobering to think
[2:20:25] about
[2:20:27] how could I possibly do that the only
[2:20:29] way I could do that is more surrender
[2:20:32] the only way we can ever do it brothers
[2:20:33] and sisters is more surrender unto the
[2:20:35] word more surrender unto the Lord that's
[2:20:38] the only way
[2:20:42] we're getting just getting into the part
[2:20:44] that I really wanted to get to and only
[2:20:46] got a few minutes left I love it how it
[2:20:48] goes that's why I said we you know we'll
[2:20:50] uh we'll probably pick this up a little
[2:20:51] bit later and and maybe not from the
[2:20:54] angle necessarily that we started with
[2:20:56] because I feel like maybe it's a bit
[2:20:58] heavy and I don't want it to be that way
[2:20:59] I just want to set the foundation for it
[2:21:01] you know
[2:21:02] um John John 20 verse 23 maybe we should
[2:21:06] turn there
[2:21:07] we'll finish with this today John 20
[2:21:10] verse 23. as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:21:14] the truly elective God there was four
[2:21:17] four known before the foundation of the
[2:21:20] world to be the ones who who we are
[2:21:22] today
[2:21:23] to be that bride of Jesus Christ my
[2:21:27] goodness
[2:21:32] I think this is applicable not even just
[2:21:34] to the bride
[2:21:36] now maybe I'd be going a little bit far
[2:21:37] with this
[2:21:39] but I would say to even nominal
[2:21:42] Christians
[2:21:44] now maybe we could have a discussion
[2:21:45] about it and I think it would be good I
[2:21:47] would love to
[2:21:49] because I think it's really important
[2:21:50] very important for us to recognize
[2:21:53] we can't change the word of God
[2:21:56] this is the absolute this is what makes
[2:21:58] the world go round is the word of God
[2:21:59] this is what framed the universe
[2:22:02] John chapter 20 verse 23
[2:22:05] who's
[2:22:06] so ever
[2:22:09] sins ye remit
[2:22:11] they are remitted unto them
[2:22:15] remember brother Bradham says there's a
[2:22:17] compound meaning and a compound
[2:22:18] Revelation to every single scripture
[2:22:19] some people might say well this was
[2:22:21] Jesus just talking to his disciples and
[2:22:23] for some people that's as far as it will
[2:22:24] go but for other people that will be
[2:22:26] able to say hey Amen to that word that
[2:22:28] word's for me that means something to me
[2:22:30] more than just print on a page who's so
[2:22:33] ever sins ye remit they are remitted
[2:22:36] unto them
[2:22:38] and whosoever sins ye retain
[2:22:43] they are retained
[2:22:45] I read this scripture many times in the
[2:22:47] past and I thought that it said
[2:22:50] whosoever sins ye retain unto them
[2:22:55] they are retained
[2:22:57] that's not what it says
[2:22:58] you can forgive sins
[2:23:00] we can forgive brothers and sisters who
[2:23:03] trespass against us
[2:23:04] especially if we pray about it God will
[2:23:07] give us that ability
[2:23:08] but whosoever sins ye retain
[2:23:13] they are retained so I want to say this
[2:23:16] morning
[2:23:17] who retains them
[2:23:20] who retains those sins
[2:23:22] I think it's an interesting topic of
[2:23:24] discussion because I want to say I think
[2:23:27] that we take those sins upon ourselves
[2:23:30] because we're not willing to forgive
[2:23:36] they become ours
[2:23:39] we've heard it said in the past if
[2:23:41] there's something covered up under the
[2:23:42] blood of Jesus Christ
[2:23:44] dealt with properly according to the
[2:23:46] word
[2:23:47] now you want to go in there and dig it
[2:23:49] up
[2:23:50] and bring it out
[2:23:52] whosoever sins are retained
[2:23:55] we're going to retain them
[2:23:58] I don't think we want to do that
[2:24:01] you know I had a quote in uh
[2:24:04] just had this on my mind maybe not as
[2:24:08] the way that I've presented it this
[2:24:09] morning I'll call the musicians or I'll
[2:24:11] just keep going and I don't want to keep
[2:24:13] us here too long we'll pick this up
[2:24:15] later but when I was in Saskatoon I just
[2:24:17] had this on my heart out of perseverance
[2:24:19] 1964 if you want to go there
[2:24:23] brother
[2:24:26] perseverance 1964-0619
[2:24:29] said you know
[2:24:31] it reminds me of a guy that some
[2:24:34] neighbors
[2:24:35] they all got them some ducks
[2:24:39] and each one put them in a little puddle
[2:24:41] in the backyard
[2:24:43] and put a fence around it
[2:24:46] he said well you know
[2:24:48] it got to raining and raining
[2:24:51] you know how slow brother Grant can talk
[2:24:53] said the puddle kept rising in each yard
[2:24:55] until it got so high it got above the
[2:24:58] fences
[2:25:00] and so the Ducks just swam all around
[2:25:03] they wasn't fenced off no more
[2:25:07] brother Branham says so I think
[2:25:09] if we can just let the tide of God's
[2:25:12] blessing rise and rise
[2:25:15] you see until we'll all be in the same
[2:25:18] pond
[2:25:20] or the same Lake
[2:25:22] after all we are
[2:25:26] it's little Creeds and things that
[2:25:28] separate us
[2:25:30] but being the children of God
[2:25:33] we're all under one family of God
[2:25:37] you know I got to thinking about it
[2:25:38] maybe stand with me as we close
[2:25:41] I got to thinking about this
[2:25:43] I never looked at it this way on on a
[2:25:45] personal level one to one
[2:25:48] Heart to Heart brother to brother sister
[2:25:50] to sister
[2:25:52] but how
[2:25:53] when that water rises and we become one
[2:25:57] I'm going to get into this two brothers
[2:25:59] and sisters the word to the church the
[2:26:01] devil ain't going to let it stay that
[2:26:02] way
[2:26:03] and we know that he hasn't
[2:26:05] and he won't
[2:26:07] he hates it when we get together and
[2:26:09] we're United together
[2:26:11] under one headship
[2:26:12] and that's not the headship of the
[2:26:14] pastor that's the headship of the Lord
[2:26:18] but Satan hates that
[2:26:20] I got thinking about this quote here how
[2:26:22] it's not just congregation it's a
[2:26:24] congregation and I always thought of it
[2:26:27] that way that it was separate church
[2:26:28] with church we've got different fences
[2:26:31] in the way you know what what if it's
[2:26:33] not that I just want to pose it this way
[2:26:35] what if it's heart to heart brother to
[2:26:36] brother sister to sister
[2:26:39] but Revelation comes up in our lives and
[2:26:41] it causes us to float and recognize
[2:26:43] we're more alike than we are different
[2:26:46] we're fighting the same enemy
[2:26:49] I've got a quote and I don't want to
[2:26:51] keep you here but brother Bradham says
[2:26:52] as long as we're putting the guns at one
[2:26:54] another we're giving Satan day off
[2:26:57] but if we can turn our guns and fight
[2:26:59] Satan with our guns then he ain't going
[2:27:02] to stand a chance
[2:27:03] [Music]
[2:27:05] but I got thinking about this this this
[2:27:07] quote here how I'd always thought about
[2:27:10] it being separate churches but what
[2:27:11] about it being brother to brother sister
[2:27:12] to sister and and what if there was
[2:27:14] fences there dividing the Ducks and what
[2:27:16] if they were barbed wire fences I said
[2:27:18] this in Saskatoon under inspiration what
[2:27:20] if somebody decided to say you know what
[2:27:22] I thought there was separation maybe I
[2:27:24] need to go down there and dive down into
[2:27:26] that thing and look it up and try and
[2:27:28] find what's there you know what if it's
[2:27:30] a barbed wire fence what if you got down
[2:27:31] there underwater and you got snagged up
[2:27:34] in the thing and you could not get back
[2:27:36] up for air
[2:27:38] I think spiritually brothers and sisters
[2:27:41] what can it do to us if we go and get
[2:27:44] tangled up in something that's already
[2:27:45] dealt with leave it alone
[2:27:47] we don't have to have a fence
[2:27:52] be free
[2:27:55] forgive just like our father in Heaven
[2:27:57] forgives us
[2:27:58] because we are our Brother's Keeper
[2:28:02] if we're not our Brother's Keeper then
[2:28:04] we're of that Spirit of Cain
[2:28:06] I I'm sorry for saying it so cut and
[2:28:09] dried but I think it's the day in which
[2:28:11] we live in we've got to say it that way
[2:28:13] brothers and sisters there's no other
[2:28:15] way to say it
[2:28:16] we're either going to have the spirit of
[2:28:18] Christ or we're going to have the spirit
[2:28:20] of the devil and the devil is going to
[2:28:22] say I'll just allow you to put whatever
[2:28:24] label you want on me and it can sound
[2:28:27] like someone really nice
[2:28:29] we know brother Branham he said if
[2:28:31] you've got the spirit of Christ you're
[2:28:32] going to display the attributes of
[2:28:33] Christ
[2:28:35] if you've got the spirit of Dillinger
[2:28:36] you're going to be a gangster
[2:28:38] if you've got the spirit of Beethoven
[2:28:39] you're going to compose but if you've
[2:28:41] got the spirit of Christ you're going to
[2:28:42] forgive
[2:28:43] because you are your brother's keeper
[2:28:46] it's just bowing prayer as we close
[2:28:49] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just
[2:28:52] love you and we thank you for your
[2:28:53] goodness to each and every one of us
[2:28:55] Lord to recognize the grace that you
[2:28:58] have given
[2:29:00] Lord that you would just come from Glory
[2:29:02] that you would set aside your your
[2:29:05] heavenly robes Lord and you would come
[2:29:07] down and put on this robe of Flesh Lord
[2:29:09] and tell all the angels in Heavenly
[2:29:11] hosts just step aside this is a job that
[2:29:14] only I can do and to come and humble
[2:29:17] yourself Lord unto death father so that
[2:29:20] we could stand here today and say Amen
[2:29:22] to the word you've given us
[2:29:24] father I pray that the words that were
[2:29:26] spoken today would just ReSound in in
[2:29:29] our souls that it would resonate father
[2:29:31] that we would think about the words that
[2:29:33] were said that we would think about what
[2:29:35] we think about our brothers and our
[2:29:37] sisters that we would think about what
[2:29:38] we say about our brothers and our
[2:29:40] sisters father that we would draw that
[2:29:42] much closer together through this Lord
[2:29:44] father that we wouldn't be pushed apart
[2:29:47] that the word of God wouldn't destroy us
[2:29:49] but that the word of God would build us
[2:29:51] up Lord Jesus
[2:29:54] father I pray that you would just help
[2:29:55] us to recognize
[2:29:57] that we have the ability to remit sins
[2:30:02] oh Father and we don't want to retain
[2:30:04] sins that should be remitted you
[2:30:06] remitted all of our sins father and help
[2:30:08] us to remit all the sins that we see we
[2:30:11] know that your word says that we can
[2:30:13] hide a multitude of sins father help us
[2:30:16] each one as we go forwards Lord father
[2:30:19] we pray that you will just watch over
[2:30:20] the children that you would watch over
[2:30:22] the families Lord be with those who are
[2:30:24] away who are traveling father wherever
[2:30:26] they are
[2:30:27] father we pray that you would just keep
[2:30:29] your hand upon each one of us now as we
[2:30:31] go our separate ways

[2:30:35] gather again on Wednesday we'll be
