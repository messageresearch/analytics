[19:36] honor give him praise sister Amber got a
[19:39] mic there for you thank you um yeah I
[19:43] had a very interesting to me very
[19:46] exciting experience very small one um
[19:49] but I just wanted to share because I I
[19:52] hope it will be a blessing for others um
[19:56] and I like I say it's
[19:59] thing um and I guess I don't have a
[20:04] spouse to share these things with I
[20:06] don't have a family devotions you know
[20:09] so I have to come tell you guys um but
[20:14] um I came for prayer or to the prayer
[20:18] meeting last Thursday asked for prayer
[20:19] for myself and you know since then I got
[20:22] a cold and since then um I try I asked
[20:29] for a um I gave an apology to someone
[20:32] that sort of led to a little bit of
[20:34] triggering of other things lack of sleep
[20:37] blah blah blah so you know um God is
[20:39] there with me and of course I guess
[20:42] these things happen right so it's been a
[20:44] little bit of a tough week but
[20:46] interestingly um on Tuesday morning my
[20:50] doorbell rang and it's the neighbor
[20:51] across the street and he says there's
[20:53] been a break in entry and he wants to
[20:55] know if I have any um uh video recording
[20:59] on my doorbell and so I am chatting with
[21:03] him I I look through my app and you know
[21:06] it it doesn't trigger any uh collection
[21:09] of images that would help him at all but
[21:11] we talk a little bit and um and then he
[21:14] leaves and uh I don't know 20 minutes
[21:17] later he comes back and this time he's
[21:19] got his uh laptop or his not laop's
[21:23] notebook and he is showing me the image
[21:27] uh cuz he's now gotten the idea his mind
[21:29] that
[21:30] um you know if you throw yourself in
[21:33] that situation when you've had a break
[21:34] and entry I've experienced that in in
[21:36] another home that I lived in and it's up
[21:39] upsetting of course right so he has
[21:41] brought back his note note um P notebook
[21:45] whatever they're called and he's sharing
[21:47] this image with me and he just wants me
[21:49] to know so I can keep an eye out and so
[21:50] forth but he continues to talk and he
[21:52] goes as far as to express how he's just
[21:54] you know they're not expensive things
[21:56] but he's just very upset very hurt by
[21:58] this and you know he would even consider
[22:00] getting a gun but I don't mean any
[22:01] offense and and I'm like yeah I I get
[22:05] that too so I'm just trying to be
[22:07] calming and reassuring to him and he
[22:09] leaves
[22:10] again and the ironic thing is you know
[22:14] as a single mom three women in the house
[22:18] I got this doorbell installed when my
[22:19] old manual one died and so yeah I can
[22:22] collect these images and it gives me a
[22:24] sense of security but along the way I've
[22:26] also I also know that that's no sec
[22:28] security too and so um that thought
[22:33] struck me as he left and and the the
[22:37] next thought that came into my mind as
[22:39] he's walking away basically is I'm
[22:41] thinking yeah that's no security for you
[22:44] either Amber but you have God Amen and
[22:48] that brought me such a feeling of
[22:50] comfort that I was just so like wow
[22:53] thank you God and so you know I might
[22:55] come to church and ask for prayer and
[22:57] then I get hit with a sore throat and I
[22:59] lose a day's work and I got this and I
[23:01] got that but God is there with us and so
[23:05] I just wanted to give God praise for
[23:07] even that little thing because you know
[23:10] I want to be ready for the hard things
[23:13] when I maybe have that experience of job
[23:15] and maybe a fire comes and takes the
[23:17] house like will I be ready so praise you
[23:19] God for being there for being my
[23:22] comforter yes amen wonderful wonderful
[23:25] thank you my sister bless you
[23:28] why don't we sing that chorus once more
[23:30] it just seems applicable I bless your
[23:32] name we can lay our cast our cares upon
[23:35] Him no weapon formed against us he
[23:37] Prosper there's so many comforting
[23:40] scriptures yeah I could go on and on but
[23:43] thank you sister those are I think those
[23:45] are the thoughts we all have we just
[23:46] thank the Lord for his grace to us and
[23:49] how he protects us just the course

[44:51] years as my wife just said God bless you
[44:53] Sister Helen I always glorify the name
[44:56] of of the Lord for the day he put us
[44:59] together yeah it's been a blessing
[45:02] Hallelujah and so
[45:04] [Music]
[45:06] um last Thursday there was a prayer
[45:09] meeting and I've heard of it here and
[45:13] I've heard of it on the
[45:15] platform it looks like a few um Temple
[45:19] testimonies have come out of
[45:21] that and
[45:23] um I was looking at all that and I was
[45:26] also thinking of that well maybe I
[45:28] should share this because I also brought
[45:30] a prayer request uh my brother in
[45:34] England is sick seriously
[45:37] sick um I think last week
[45:41] Tuesday we got the information that
[45:44] doctors had given up and then they said
[45:47] well the next 48 hours was
[45:50] critical and so we were waiting for
[45:53] whatever will happen to happen and so I
[45:56] came here we prayed we went home and I
[45:59] didn't hear anything on Thursday and I'm
[46:02] not uh very bold when it comes to
[46:05] calling to ask about these things and so
[46:09] not Thursday not Friday and so Saturday
[46:13] it had been just too long I couldn't
[46:14] wait any longer and so I called and when
[46:18] I called as they picked up the
[46:21] call somehow they were also calling me
[46:24] but on a video call and and so I took it
[46:28] and the first thing I saw was my brother
[46:30] sitting down in bed feeding
[46:33] himself praise the name of the
[46:39] Lord and so I say that he is a prayer
[46:43] answering
[46:44] God praise the name of the
[46:47] Lord now um the other thing I wanted to
[46:50] say is that Sunday school is done by the
[46:53] grace of God all is over and at least
[46:56] for the next 8 weeks week or so and um
[47:00] It's Been a Good Year um a lot was
[47:04] learned but for me the highlights was
[47:07] when we got
[47:08] into um the topic of uh receiving the
[47:12] Holy Ghost and how it was at Pentecost
[47:15] and what Peter said about all the whole
[47:18] process that was going on in Pentecost
[47:20] Peter pointed to Joel chapter
[47:23] 2 and so the bulk of our study was Joel
[47:27] chapter 2 and we were looking at a very
[47:31] interesting thing that the Lord outlined
[47:33] there because he was talking about
[47:36] restoring everything because now the
[47:37] food is for the children amen and when
[47:41] you have the food in in a hole you
[47:45] produce what it is intended to produce
[47:48] in you and so for the devil to fight
[47:51] against the children he bites at it and
[47:53] that's why the coner worm and the Palmer
[47:55] worm and the locost and and the
[47:57] caterpillar had done and on and on and
[47:59] God says I will
[48:01] restore and so God begins that process
[48:04] with the
[48:05] restoration and then he says afterwards
[48:07] that you shall feed in plenty right and
[48:10] then he says you shall be satisfied and
[48:13] then you'll praise His name and then
[48:16] after praising his name says you shall
[48:18] not be ashamed and so he lift up all the
[48:21] list all these things and then says
[48:23] afterwards I'll pour out my spirit
[48:26] praise the name of of the Lord and so um
[48:29] we've had a good time studying it but
[48:31] what we noted was that the restoration
[48:35] was God's work but the feeding is our
[48:39] work and that is the one part that I
[48:44] believe there are no limits I'm not sure
[48:47] if it was sister Amber who one time said
[48:49] gluton is
[48:51] encouraged so we just have to eat and
[48:54] because every the all the steps that
[48:55] follow if you don't eat and if you don't
[48:58] eat a lot that's why the Bible says we
[49:00] eat in plenty then the rest does not uh
[49:04] happen and so anyway this uh is what
[49:07] I've had in on the background of my mind
[49:09] as I was asked to to uh prepare for
[49:14] this and so um I'll read a little um
[49:20] story from 1 Samuel 30 if you please
[49:24] stand with me
[49:47] and so first Samuel 30 I will probably
[49:51] take uh just one verse from Mark 6 maybe
[49:55] yeah but first
[49:57] P30 it's a long read so please bear with
[50:04] me and I'll would say please bear me in
[50:06] prayer as well I was battling with a
[50:09] sore throat yes all night I couldn't
[50:12] sleep very well but here I am so the
[50:15] Lord is faithful amen amen so 1 Samuel
[50:18] 30 I'm reading from verse
[50:22] one and it came to pass when David and
[50:25] his men were come to zlac on the third
[50:29] day that the amalekites had invaded the
[50:31] South and zlac and spitting ZL and
[50:35] burned it with fire and had taken the
[50:37] women captives that were therein they
[50:40] SLE not any either great or small but
[50:44] carried them away and went on their way
[50:47] so David and his men came to the city
[50:50] and behold it was burned with fire and
[50:52] their wives and their sons and their
[50:54] daughters were taken captives then David
[50:57] and the people that were with him lifted
[50:59] up lifted up their voice and wept until
[51:03] they had no power to
[51:05] weep and David's two
[51:08] wives were taken captives aino the jelit
[51:12] and Abigail the wife of nabal the
[51:16] carite and David was greatly distressed
[51:19] for the people spake of stoning him
[51:21] because the soul of all the people was
[51:23] grieved every man for his sons and for
[51:26] his daughters but David encored himself
[51:29] in the Lord his God am Hallelujah and
[51:33] David said to AB abar the priest ahim
[51:38] son I pray thee bring me hither the
[51:41] effort and abur brought theer the effort
[51:45] to David and David inquired at the Lord
[51:48] saying shall I pursue after this troop
[51:51] shall I overtake them and he answered
[51:53] him pursue for thou shal surely overtake
[51:56] them and without fail recover
[51:58] all so David went and 600 men that were
[52:03] with him and came to the brook Bessel
[52:05] where those that were left behind
[52:08] stayed but David pursued he and 400 men
[52:13] for 200 behind which were so faint
[52:17] that they could not go over the broke
[52:19] Bessel and they found an Egyptian in the
[52:22] field and brought him to David and gave
[52:24] him bread and he did eat and they made
[52:26] it him drink and they gave him a piece
[52:28] of cake of fix and two cluster of
[52:31] raisins and when he had eaten his Spirit
[52:34] came again to him for he had eaten no
[52:36] bread nor drank any water three days and
[52:39] three nights and David said unto him to
[52:42] whom belong us thou and whence art thou
[52:46] and he said I am a young man of Egypt
[52:48] servant of an amalaki and my master left
[52:50] me because 3 days ago I fell
[52:54] sick we made an invasion of on the south
[52:57] of the terites and upon the coast which
[53:00] belongeth to Judah and upon the south of
[53:03] Caleb and we burn zlac with fire and
[53:06] David said to him can thou bring me down
[53:09] to this company and he said swear unto
[53:12] me by God that thou will neither kill me
[53:15] nor deliver me into the hands of my
[53:17] master and I'll bring thee down to this
[53:20] company and when he had brought him down
[53:22] behold they were spread abroad upon all
[53:25] the Earth eating and drinking and
[53:27] dancing because all the great because of
[53:29] all the great spoil that they had taken
[53:31] out and the out of the land of the
[53:34] Philistines and out of the land of
[53:36] Judah and David smoked them from the
[53:40] Twilight even onto the evening of the
[53:42] next day and there escaped not a man of
[53:45] them save 400 young men which rode upon
[53:49] caramels and fled and David recovered
[53:52] all that the amalekites had carried away
[53:55] and David rescued his two wives and
[53:59] there was nothing lacking neither small
[54:01] or great neither son or daughter neither
[54:03] SPO or anything that they had
[54:07] taken to them David recovered
[54:11] all may the Lord add His blessings upon
[54:14] his word you may be
[54:18] seated so um I will just take one verse
[54:22] from Mark 6
[54:36] yes Mark
[54:40] 64 so it says but Jesus said unto them a
[54:44] prophet is not without honor but in his
[54:48] own country among his own King and in
[54:52] his own house amen
[54:57] so this is a
[54:59] um a story that I say it's a very
[55:02] serious situation for
[55:05] David and for the people who are with
[55:08] him now you remember that these people
[55:11] who are with David these men with David
[55:14] are the same people who became the
[55:16] mighty men that are mentioned in the
[55:18] Bible the Mighty Men of David and that
[55:21] happened once they committed themselves
[55:23] to the ca of David and so so they sort
[55:27] of shared a destiny from that point and
[55:30] pretty much that is what this gospel is
[55:33] about that when you share h h a
[55:37] commitment to this Destiny you are
[55:39] joined to to this gospel you are joined
[55:42] in Destiny praise the name of the Lord
[55:45] and so this evening
[55:47] oh I want to um uh talk a little little
[55:52] bit about preparing to rain that's by
[55:56] talk preparing to
[55:58] rain and
[56:00] so all right preparing to
[56:03] rain now I like uh this uh story of
[56:08] David because it's pretty much a very uh
[56:11] reflective of the life of the believer
[56:13] in many ways or at least it's reflective
[56:16] of the life of the Bride of the Lord
[56:18] Jesus Christ in this end time you see
[56:21] David was a Shepherd boy at the backside
[56:24] of the deert carrying about just the
[56:27] sheep and maybe enjoying his music
[56:30] pretty much the ruling Israel was the
[56:33] furthest from his mind but the Lord
[56:37] found him and the lord gave him the word
[56:41] and the Lord anointed him and the Lord
[56:43] set him on a
[56:45] course to rain praise the name of the
[56:48] Lord and I believe this is the situation
[56:51] of everybody here that we were probably
[56:55] running away from the Lord when he found
[56:57] us and once he found us he gave us a
[57:01] word that changed our course Hallelujah
[57:04] and so there are people here tonight who
[57:06] have received this word in their heart
[57:08] who have believed this word in their
[57:10] heart who are possessors of a promise of
[57:13] God Revelations 10 uh 510 talks about
[57:17] such people and it says
[57:22] um so he has made us out onto Our God
[57:27] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[57:30] Earth Hallelujah and so that is our
[57:34] situation that is our position now you
[57:36] realize that from the time that David
[57:38] was anointed from the time from the time
[57:41] that the word was
[57:42] spoken upon David up to the time that uh
[57:48] the word was fulfilled it's a very long
[57:51] period of time and all of that period
[57:55] was just the preparation for David to
[57:58] Reign and I believe we have received the
[58:01] same word and for the time from now to
[58:04] the time of complete realization there
[58:07] is a preparation the simple fact is that
[58:10] God knows what is required to be there
[58:14] and he knows how unprepared we are and
[58:17] he knows what life situations he can put
[58:19] us through to get us there praise the
[58:22] name of the Living God and so that is
[58:25] what we are sort of going to uh talk
[58:27] about right now praise the name of the
[58:30] Lord let's see
[58:39] uh okay all right thank
[58:44] you and so um in the message and time
[58:48] evangelism brother Braham says he had a
[58:50] bride God's looking for
[58:53] character and then after elar found the
[58:56] character then the next thing was
[58:58] getting her ready to go
[59:01] am that's the same now brother the same
[59:06] now the end time message is not out
[59:09] yonder in
[59:11] Babylon so out there it's not there you
[59:14] are the one he's speaking to praise the
[59:17] name of the Lord and that is that is
[59:20] natural no man wants to marry a lady and
[59:24] goes to announce to everybody no
[59:27] you talk with her the announcement will
[59:29] come after she is accepted praise the
[59:32] name of the Living God and so you are
[59:34] the one he spoken to
[59:36] Hallelujah and so the moment the
[59:38] anointing came on David one would expect
[59:41] that maybe uh things were going to be
[59:44] easy after all God is responsible for
[59:47] the Fulfillment of his own word
[59:49] hallelujah but no it wasn't like that
[59:52] David faced battle after battle and
[59:54] problem after problem the reason is that
[59:57] God had to prepare David for the
[59:59] position he has been called onto and all
[1:00:02] of us are the same understand it that we
[1:00:05] have even been called to a higher
[1:00:06] position because David's position was an
[1:00:09] Earthly position praise the name of the
[1:00:11] Living God but we are called into an
[1:00:13] everlasting position am Hallelujah and
[1:00:16] so there is a preparation praise the
[1:00:19] name of the Living
[1:00:22] God now um I'll read this beginning and
[1:00:25] ending of the gentle
[1:00:27] dispensation it's a bit of a long one
[1:00:29] says now before you can have a victory
[1:00:32] there has to be a battle and if there is
[1:00:35] no battle there is no victories sir so
[1:00:38] we ought to be thankful for the battles
[1:00:41] hallelujah how many are thankful for the
[1:00:43] battles praise the name of the Living
[1:00:46] God and trying and it's God's giving us
[1:00:50] the opportunity to have
[1:00:53] victories hallelujah oh my don't that
[1:00:56] make you a little bit better now see the
[1:00:59] battle come along somebody saying
[1:01:01] something bad about you sickness come
[1:01:04] unto you maybe God give you those light
[1:01:07] afflictions that he might heal you and
[1:01:10] show his favor to you let you see what
[1:01:13] it means by it he loves
[1:01:17] you
[1:01:19] Hallelujah so God had a higher purpose
[1:01:23] he had a greater purpose oh Hallelujah
[1:01:25] ujah so everything that happened in the
[1:01:28] life of D David from the anointing to
[1:01:30] the conation was preparation for
[1:01:33] leadership Hallelujah now this is not
[1:01:36] just the case for David it's for all the
[1:01:38] men who are with him remember once they
[1:01:41] committed to the cause of David they
[1:01:43] shared a common Destiny and so they were
[1:01:46] all going to be the pillars in the new
[1:01:50] uh H nation that was going to usher in
[1:01:55] the golden age Hallelujah now the Golden
[1:01:58] Age was Solomon's Reign where they had
[1:02:01] their temple built where they had their
[1:02:04] services where there was peace where
[1:02:06] nobody was attacking them where there
[1:02:08] was Prosperity that is go the Golden Age
[1:02:11] and that is like into the Millennium but
[1:02:14] these people were going to be the
[1:02:16] stability of the society as it is
[1:02:18] ushered in praise the name of the Lord
[1:02:21] and so the simple thing is this if God
[1:02:25] fills you he's going to use you
[1:02:29] Hallelujah you say oh yeah I'm a wife
[1:02:32] I'm a housewife I'm just a
[1:02:36] mom first of all it's not
[1:02:39] just praise the name of the Living God
[1:02:42] it's not just oh yeah I don't know what
[1:02:44] I'm doing with my
[1:02:46] life brother R says you may commit 20
[1:02:48] years of your life to your children but
[1:02:51] your name will be Associated to with
[1:02:54] them for eternity amen
[1:02:56] Hallelujah so motherhood is a call
[1:03:00] praise the name of the Lord at least
[1:03:02] Godly motherhood
[1:03:07] Hallelujah and so if God calls you and
[1:03:11] anoints you he's going to use you
[1:03:14] because what he says is that he will
[1:03:15] never light a candle and hide it under a
[1:03:18] bushel that's right Hallelujah and so
[1:03:23] don't think about your position or where
[1:03:26] you are or what it is what matters is
[1:03:28] has he filled you praise the name of the
[1:03:31] Lord is his spirit in you because if
[1:03:34] it's in you then he will set you up to
[1:03:39] service
[1:03:41] Hallelujah now um the very first uh act
[1:03:46] so to speak now going by the
[1:03:48] chronological order of the Bible because
[1:03:50] there's a lot of dispute as to whether
[1:03:53] David fought Goliath before he went to
[1:03:56] the presence of uh um Saul or
[1:04:01] not but I'm going according to the
[1:04:03] scriptural chronology so the First Act
[1:04:07] of David anointed by the prophet was him
[1:04:11] playing the H
[1:04:14] Hallelujah the First Act was David
[1:04:18] playing the H praise the name of the
[1:04:20] Lord now what happens is that he plac
[1:04:24] just play a h
[1:04:26] and then it
[1:04:27] is uh getting rid of
[1:04:30] demons Hallelujah now the Bible does not
[1:04:33] say he sang They said he played and even
[1:04:36] says he played with his hand so
[1:04:39] understand the brother if the tunes of
[1:04:41] Godly
[1:04:42] music can get rid of
[1:04:44] demons what will the tunes from worldly
[1:04:47] music
[1:04:49] do I leave everybody to think about it I
[1:04:53] know some some time back in in in in the
[1:04:58] with the Babylonians it was a call to
[1:05:00] worship
[1:05:01] idols yeah and so think about these
[1:05:04] things I know that a lot has been said
[1:05:07] about all contemporary music and and all
[1:05:11] these things I'll tell you something
[1:05:12] brother Abraham talks about going into a
[1:05:14] restaurant a very natural Act of eating
[1:05:17] and the music that we were playing was
[1:05:19] such that he could not
[1:05:22] eat then he speaks about another instant
[1:05:24] where he's in the vehicle and the person
[1:05:26] is playing worldly music and he says
[1:05:29] stop it and the person says no I like it
[1:05:31] and why does he say say you have the
[1:05:33] wrong
[1:05:35] spirit and so if you enjoy these things
[1:05:38] it's not too late understand the spirit
[1:05:40] that is in you but then again if that
[1:05:44] Spirit feeds on these things what you
[1:05:46] have to do star
[1:05:48] it praise the name of the Living God it
[1:05:51] can be done hallelujah amen
[1:05:55] so we have brother Abraham saying in
[1:05:58] thirsting for life he says that that's
[1:06:01] the kind of song I love I'd rather have
[1:06:03] them than all your little old chopped up
[1:06:06] Boogie wogie things that you try to put
[1:06:08] in
[1:06:10] church and take the place of
[1:06:12] oldfashioned hymns it will never do it
[1:06:16] no sir the Holy Spirit loves those
[1:06:19] oldfashioned songs Hallelujah and so I
[1:06:24] know maybe I'm spending a lot of time on
[1:06:26] on on on this uh music but it's just
[1:06:30] that a lot of times we question
[1:06:33] ourselves oh we believe the message we
[1:06:35] love the Lord we in the end time why
[1:06:37] don't we see the hand of God more often
[1:06:40] and we have to come from the
[1:06:42] understanding that this message is more
[1:06:45] than quotes and debates this message is
[1:06:47] a life the very life of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:51] Christ hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:06:53] Living God so you understand that now
[1:06:57] this is not talking about because if if
[1:06:59] David was singing you know there is
[1:07:02] power in the words so the lyric would do
[1:07:05] but the tune of what was doing it right
[1:07:08] the
[1:07:09] tune Hallelujah and so
[1:07:16] uh in the handwriting on the wall says
[1:07:20] here I heard them other day on radio
[1:07:23] singing When the Saints Go Maring in in
[1:07:26] rock time when I see the blood in Boogie
[1:07:30] Woogie what it is Grace do you think a
[1:07:34] holy God can listen to that and be just
[1:07:38] and not judge it so understand it these
[1:07:42] are
[1:07:43] hymns when the SS go go marching on is a
[1:07:46] hym when I see the when I see the blood
[1:07:49] is A Hymn but what is happening it is
[1:07:52] being sung in a way a modern way I I
[1:07:55] actually tried to look up Rock time it
[1:07:56] says a musical style with SH short
[1:08:00] rugged Rhythm and then I looked up
[1:08:03] Boogie Wiggy it says a strong fast
[1:08:07] beat and so the words were right but
[1:08:10] even the Rhythm makes it wrong to the
[1:08:13] extent that the prophet will say what a
[1:08:15] disgrace let's be mindful of these
[1:08:17] things because through the Rhythm
[1:08:20] through the music through the tunes a
[1:08:23] lot is transmitted
[1:08:25] praise the name of the
[1:08:28] Lord so once David was anointed the
[1:08:30] Bible tells us going on with our story
[1:08:33] that the spirit of God left Saul and it
[1:08:36] came on David and then an evil spirit
[1:08:39] tormented Saul and I'm probably not
[1:08:43] spend a lot of time because actually the
[1:08:45] way it was manifested he was prophesying
[1:08:48] Hallelujah but the Bible says gifts and
[1:08:50] callings are without repentance so let's
[1:08:52] just go on with
[1:08:53] this and so these these spirits will
[1:08:56] torment Saul and when David will come
[1:08:59] and he will play the har Saul will be
[1:09:02] relieved of this and the Bible says Saul
[1:09:05] loved David Hallelujah he even made him
[1:09:09] his armor Bearer praise the name of the
[1:09:11] Lord and so understand it this way that
[1:09:13] just living your life as a Believer
[1:09:17] doing the things that you love in the
[1:09:19] case of David is just playing the her
[1:09:23] you were already upsetting the devil
[1:09:25] amen amen Amen brother sister don't let
[1:09:29] anybody suppress your way of Christian
[1:09:31] life because it's your tool for battle
[1:09:35] praise the name of the Lord You Don't
[1:09:37] Know by the songs you sing by the
[1:09:40] prayers you pray morning evening every
[1:09:42] time you have time by the time you spent
[1:09:44] in the Bible you don't know how many
[1:09:45] demons you are getting rid
[1:09:48] of so it doesn't matter oh the boss is
[1:09:51] there oh this is a break restaurant oh
[1:09:53] very refined people com does that matter
[1:09:56] you are serving the King of
[1:09:57] Kings Hallelujah and he given you a very
[1:10:01] special call in this
[1:10:03] age that's
[1:10:05] right praise the name of the
[1:10:09] Lord and so what changed Saul's uh love
[1:10:13] for David and I think right away we can
[1:10:17] say is jealousy because David went to
[1:10:21] fight Goliath and he went to fight
[1:10:23] Goliath at a time when every everybody
[1:10:25] else was scared of uh uh Goliath the
[1:10:28] entire nation all the men all the
[1:10:30] fighters all the soldiers were scared of
[1:10:33] Goliath including Saul but you see David
[1:10:37] in responding to the call to go and
[1:10:39] fight the Goliath was responding to the
[1:10:42] anointing on
[1:10:44] him and these are things that we have to
[1:10:46] understand yes not not many people knew
[1:10:49] but David
[1:10:51] knew that he has been anointed and the
[1:10:54] word has been spoken over him to be the
[1:10:57] king of Israel and even though he's not
[1:11:00] there yet the anointing was on him and
[1:11:03] it's the it's the duty of the king to
[1:11:05] lead his people to battle and in this
[1:11:08] case where H the Philistines were
[1:11:10] actually encamp was in the the territory
[1:11:13] of the children of Israel so it was
[1:11:15] already an invasion isn't the king's
[1:11:18] Duty then to fight for his people and to
[1:11:21] fight for the land praise the name of
[1:11:23] the Lord and so why what David did was a
[1:11:26] response to the anointing on him now you
[1:11:29] of course understand that what Saul also
[1:11:31] did was a respon to the anointing that
[1:11:33] had come under him that was
[1:11:35] fear and so it's for us to choose and
[1:11:38] understand the spirit of God will never
[1:11:40] give you
[1:11:41] fear
[1:11:44] hallelujah praise the name of the Living
[1:11:46] God now the surprising thing about this
[1:11:49] is that as David endeav to go forward
[1:11:52] and and
[1:11:53] fulfill his role or his
[1:11:56] Destiny the first significant opposition
[1:11:59] he received was from a man who had
[1:12:02] witnessed the
[1:12:05] anointing his big
[1:12:07] brother Eliah was there H abinadab was
[1:12:12] there sha his three older brothers were
[1:12:15] there and this
[1:12:18] Eliah saw it but he's the one who came
[1:12:21] to David I think I
[1:12:23] had yes
[1:12:26] he was really angry he said I Know Thy
[1:12:29] pride and the naughtiness of thine
[1:12:33] heart then he even says Where have you
[1:12:35] left those few
[1:12:36] sheep that you take care
[1:12:40] of he was the one to oppose it even
[1:12:43] though he's witnessed it now it would
[1:12:47] have been maybe very
[1:12:50] discouraging had it not been that David
[1:12:53] was the person that he was
[1:12:56] Hallelujah because according to who you
[1:12:58] are that is how you react now in this
[1:13:02] situation there are two reactions there
[1:13:05] is Goliath and everybody is reacting
[1:13:08] with fear but to that same Goliath David
[1:13:11] is reacting with hisain and he want to
[1:13:15] just go and fight and clear this guy out
[1:13:17] of the way because of the anointing that
[1:13:20] was on him amen praise the name of the
[1:13:22] Lord and so when you look at this
[1:13:24] understand what is the anointing on you
[1:13:28] how do you tolerate when people are
[1:13:30] desecrating the things of God how do you
[1:13:33] react when things are not going the way
[1:13:36] God has ordained them to go when there
[1:13:38] is perversion complete perion not
[1:13:40] perversion on the land how do you feel
[1:13:43] how do you react that should give an
[1:13:45] indication of what spirit is on you
[1:13:47] praise the name of the
[1:13:49] Lord but you see for David that reaction
[1:13:52] was too late because the word had
[1:13:55] already gone forth amen he heard it the
[1:13:58] anointing is on him he knows it
[1:14:00] Hallelujah it cannot be changed he has
[1:14:03] already received it praise the name of
[1:14:05] the Lord and I believe oh God that all
[1:14:08] of us here I wish we could just come to
[1:14:10] that realization that because we have
[1:14:13] received this message because we have
[1:14:14] believed this message that we are
[1:14:16] anointed for purpose in this end time
[1:14:18] and that is to represent our husband the
[1:14:21] Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen
[1:14:26] and so David says is there not a
[1:14:29] cause I love that I remember maybe some
[1:14:33] 12 years ago I was preaching on that is
[1:14:36] there not a cause how us in in
[1:14:40] Ghana because there is a reason right
[1:14:43] and and of all the people there elab
[1:14:46] knows it his big brother knows it even
[1:14:49] it doesn't matter if all these people
[1:14:50] don't see it you know it that there is a
[1:14:53] cause I am anointing Ed to be king and
[1:14:56] this is my duty and understand that you
[1:14:59] are anointed to be the Bride of the Lord
[1:15:01] Jesus Christ and there is an accepted
[1:15:04] life for you there is an expected
[1:15:06] position that you have to start now to
[1:15:09] live
[1:15:16] Hallelujah and so David speaks with the
[1:15:20] people and then uh they take him to Saul
[1:15:26] and then Saul looks at
[1:15:28] him and Saul says oh you are but a
[1:15:36] youth another saying you are just a boy
[1:15:39] what are you doing
[1:15:42] here but you see what happened and this
[1:15:45] is the good part of it that David had
[1:15:47] the word and he had the testimony to
[1:15:49] back it out so no amount of
[1:15:52] discouragement could could could uh
[1:15:55] disuade him understand this this way the
[1:15:58] testimonies are
[1:15:59] important praise the name of the Living
[1:16:02] God after we have received this word the
[1:16:04] testimonies are important Hallelujah it
[1:16:07] puts God in his position and it places
[1:16:10] the devil in his
[1:16:12] position
[1:16:15] Hallelujah now you know who else said
[1:16:18] this is by the youth
[1:16:21] Goliath all right Goliath said exactly
[1:16:23] the same thing that SS said when he saw
[1:16:25] David but you know even before David was
[1:16:28] called into the presence of Saul one of
[1:16:32] his servants had called him a valiant
[1:16:34] man a man of war prudent in matters I
[1:16:38] look at thatp say this is your servant
[1:16:40] and you the king all you can see is you
[1:16:43] can't go beyond the physical what means
[1:16:45] the eye that's
[1:16:47] it
[1:16:51] Hallelujah now we also have to
[1:16:54] understand that this big problem this
[1:16:57] big situation that we call
[1:17:00] Goliath was actually
[1:17:03] necessary it was necessary otherwise all
[1:17:07] that God has deposited in David will lay
[1:17:09] dormant right right and the fact that go
[1:17:13] the spirit of God has left Saul will not
[1:17:16] also be
[1:17:17] seen but the moment Goliath came the
[1:17:21] difference was made and a lot of time
[1:17:24] that is why problems come our way they
[1:17:27] come to show us what we have in our own
[1:17:30] selves they come to help us understand
[1:17:32] our environment praise the name of the
[1:17:35] Lord so God places in in situations to
[1:17:38] bring out what is already placed in us
[1:17:43] hallelujah now I'm reading from
[1:17:47] Hebrews pram says you mustn't question
[1:17:50] anything to God for the footsteps of the
[1:17:53] righteous is ordered of the Lord and
[1:17:56] every trial is put upon you to prove you
[1:17:59] amen and the Bible said they are more
[1:18:01] precious to you than gold so if God let
[1:18:04] a few light afflictions happen to you
[1:18:06] remember it's for the correction of you
[1:18:09] every son that cometh to God must first
[1:18:12] be chastened and tried child trained
[1:18:16] there is no
[1:18:18] exception every son that cometh and
[1:18:22] these afflictions are done they are
[1:18:24] brought about to see what attitude you
[1:18:26] will
[1:18:27] take see are you going through a trial
[1:18:30] right
[1:18:31] now understand that God is watching to
[1:18:33] see your attitude praise the name of the
[1:18:36] Lord say it's God on this proven ground
[1:18:40] that is all Earth is is the proven
[1:18:43] grounds and where he's trying to prove
[1:18:49] you and so David had both the spoken
[1:18:52] word and the testimony to back it up and
[1:18:57] you understand even so wouldn't have
[1:18:59] permitted him to go to fight if he had
[1:19:02] not produce those
[1:19:04] testimonies
[1:19:06] Hallelujah all right so we need to live
[1:19:09] a
[1:19:11] life where on top of the spoken word we
[1:19:16] have the testimony to back it up we need
[1:19:19] to live a life where we actually take
[1:19:22] note of the times and inst SES where God
[1:19:25] intervenes in a supernatural way in our
[1:19:28] lives we need to take note we need to
[1:19:31] keep a catalog of
[1:19:33] those we need to look at what God's word
[1:19:36] say about us we need to think about it
[1:19:39] we need to rehearse it we need to
[1:19:41] meditate on those things we need to even
[1:19:44] talk to talk back to God about those
[1:19:46] things we need to talk about his power
[1:19:48] His Majesty we need to just drown the
[1:19:51] problems in Praise amen amen amen
[1:19:56] hallelujah it can be done and it has
[1:19:58] been
[1:19:59] done battles have been won through
[1:20:02] singing prison Gates have been broken
[1:20:04] through
[1:20:05] singing chains have been broken demons
[1:20:09] have escaped Hallelujah so we need to
[1:20:13] every time we go before the Lord and
[1:20:15] it's something that even I am learning
[1:20:17] to do is that I should spend more time
[1:20:20] praising
[1:20:21] him I should spend more time worshiping
[1:20:23] him
[1:20:25] than talking about my
[1:20:28] problems praise the name of the Living
[1:20:33] God because when we do that what we're
[1:20:36] doing
[1:20:37] is we're taking responsibility for our
[1:20:40] own
[1:20:40] strength
[1:20:48] Hallelujah
[1:20:50] okay
[1:20:51] um yeah so I just wanted to draw
[1:20:54] attention ption to one uh uh quot by
[1:20:57] says the church today does not need
[1:20:59] power it needs Faith to operate the
[1:21:02] power that has already been given to it
[1:21:06] Hallelujah now David's victory over the
[1:21:09] Philistines drew the Praises of the
[1:21:12] women and that is where that is the
[1:21:15] beginning of his Wars that is what
[1:21:18] changed the love of of of uh Saul for
[1:21:22] David because then he starts thinking
[1:21:25] well if they ass say to me that I've
[1:21:27] killed my thousand and David 10,000 then
[1:21:29] they are going to give the throne to him
[1:21:31] and an insecure King who has already
[1:21:34] lost his anointing so that was a big
[1:21:36] border and so right away he started
[1:21:40] hating H uh David and if you read
[1:21:44] scripture carefully the hatred was so
[1:21:47] intense it was saying intense that David
[1:21:51] um Saul spent most of his time as a king
[1:21:56] chasing David he spent more time chasing
[1:21:59] David than everything else that he did
[1:22:01] as a king over 10 years he was pursuing
[1:22:06] David that is what jealousy
[1:22:08] does fruitless
[1:22:12] effort Hallelujah so
[1:22:16] now David has been
[1:22:19] rejected by his
[1:22:22] family and now has been rejected by the
[1:22:27] king why so much
[1:22:29] rejection and I think that is probably
[1:22:31] what prompted me to read the the one
[1:22:33] verse in
[1:22:34] Mark because it says the prophet is
[1:22:37] without an is in his own country why so
[1:22:41] because you see there are people we know
[1:22:43] there are people we respect there are
[1:22:46] people we we we we we we love to maybe
[1:22:49] would want to even please or impress and
[1:22:53] when the Applause comes from these
[1:22:55] people they can be distracting and God
[1:22:58] does not want us addicted to the Praises
[1:23:01] and and the and the acclamation of all
[1:23:04] these people no he want us focused on
[1:23:09] purpose
[1:23:11] hallelujah praise the name of the Living
[1:23:13] God
[1:23:17] am and so David has been rejected by
[1:23:19] these people but how about the people
[1:23:22] that he was called
[1:23:24] uh uh to to begin over and that the next
[1:23:27] step that I want us to look at because
[1:23:30] something happened after Saul started
[1:23:34] pursuing uh David onto the mountains
[1:23:37] they went and into the forest and into
[1:23:39] the woods and into the caves and
[1:23:41] everywhere there were instances where
[1:23:43] God even gave Saul completely to David
[1:23:46] and David would not touch
[1:23:48] him and so but one instant that I want
[1:23:52] to just just draw attention to because I
[1:23:54] I thought it was it was significant it
[1:23:56] shows something about the the character
[1:23:58] of David was that one city called Kayla
[1:24:02] was attacked by the Philistines and this
[1:24:05] is a time of harvest you go you get your
[1:24:07] Harvest you come and then these people
[1:24:10] come and they take all your food and
[1:24:13] they leave you to
[1:24:14] serve and so the city is attacked and
[1:24:18] then word comes to David that the city
[1:24:21] has been now remember David is not safe
[1:24:24] any were but he's better in Judah than
[1:24:27] in in what was what later became Israel
[1:24:30] or the northern kingdom and so he's down
[1:24:33] here in Judah and then the word gets to
[1:24:36] him now there could be only two
[1:24:38] situations either the people did not see
[1:24:40] Saul as their leader that's why they
[1:24:42] told David or maybe they actually told
[1:24:45] Saul but he did not
[1:24:47] react because he was consumed with
[1:24:49] following
[1:24:50] David this is what bitterness and
[1:24:53] resentment can do to a person
[1:24:55] and jealousy and so you have to watch it
[1:24:58] but anyway when the word came to David
[1:25:00] what did he do he consulted the Lord
[1:25:03] first Hallelujah and then when he
[1:25:05] consulted the Lord right away the the
[1:25:08] Lord said go and save Kaa he tells his
[1:25:11] people people say we are even in Judah
[1:25:13] we are scared and he want us to go there
[1:25:16] that was the greatest of Faith but he
[1:25:18] consults the word the Lord again the
[1:25:20] Lord says go and so he goes and he try
[1:25:24] he SM the people and he give back the
[1:25:26] food to to Kayla now Paul hears that
[1:25:30] David is in Kayla oh the Lord has given
[1:25:33] him to me but even that the Lord has
[1:25:36] given him to me it's not as if he was
[1:25:37] going to go no he understands the people
[1:25:41] who are with Saul with David and so he
[1:25:44] has to get an army from here get the
[1:25:45] people for by the time he got everybody
[1:25:48] ready David knew what was going on what
[1:25:51] does David do he consults the Lord again
[1:25:54] am he says
[1:25:56] Lord will these people give me up the
[1:26:00] Lord says yes they will give you
[1:26:02] up I have just saved
[1:26:05] them says yes they will give you up and
[1:26:08] so David leaves and so continue I'm I'm
[1:26:10] I'm sure you following the trail of
[1:26:12] rejection because that was what God me
[1:26:14] to this this this study that he's
[1:26:17] rejected by his brother or his family he
[1:26:19] rejected by the king and now he's been
[1:26:22] rejected even by the people that he was
[1:26:24] called to
[1:26:25] rule
[1:26:27] Hallelujah and so David crosses over
[1:26:30] because he realizes that Saul was not
[1:26:33] will not stop pursuing him he crosses
[1:26:35] over to the side of the Philistines and
[1:26:38] he goes to the king ashes a very sh King
[1:26:41] now this
[1:26:42] King ashes was King about GTH which is
[1:26:45] where Goliath is from but this King
[1:26:48] looks at the situation says this is a
[1:26:49] very powerful Army now uh this man is
[1:26:53] hated in in Israel so if I keep him here
[1:26:56] I have a very powerful Army on my side
[1:27:00] and so then he keeps him and that is how
[1:27:02] come David has zlac which is what we are
[1:27:05] talking about right
[1:27:07] now and so he has a very powerful Army
[1:27:10] on on the side and you have to
[1:27:13] understand it we cannot go through all
[1:27:15] the things that David uh happens to
[1:27:17] David but I just said that to to to let
[1:27:21] you know about the rejections that he to
[1:27:24] have and so at this point the only thing
[1:27:26] that he had on his side are the people
[1:27:29] some of which are from his family and
[1:27:32] those who were indeed in Israel those
[1:27:34] who were in distress and those who were
[1:27:37] in discontented that's what the Bible
[1:27:40] says these are the people who
[1:27:43] followed David so it's almost as if it's
[1:27:46] the who of who of the of the of the
[1:27:49] rejected
[1:27:54] Hallelujah there were noodies but the
[1:27:56] moment they found out what God was doing
[1:27:59] today in their day and they committed
[1:28:02] themselves to R then they became the
[1:28:05] Mighty Men of
[1:28:07] David we have the same opportunity
[1:28:10] brothers and sisters we have the same
[1:28:13] opportunity right now committing
[1:28:15] ourselves to this cause now you say oh
[1:28:19] yeah there is scripture uh uh Saul was
[1:28:21] anointed to be king yes
[1:28:24] Saul was anointed but what God was doing
[1:28:26] right then was that he was making David
[1:28:29] King that's right that was the word of
[1:28:31] God to be fulfilled in that day Saul
[1:28:33] being anointed to be king is not wrong
[1:28:36] it's there it's scriptural but what's
[1:28:38] the difference you take note of it so
[1:28:42] that you don't kill Saul and that's what
[1:28:44] David did it's not as if the Old
[1:28:46] Testament is useless no it's still part
[1:28:49] of scripture it still affects our
[1:28:50] Behavior but what God is doing right now
[1:28:53] is Malachi 4
[1:28:54] amen praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:28:57] that is
[1:28:59] what they realized and then they
[1:29:01] committed themselves to it and once they
[1:29:03] did that and then God started bringing
[1:29:05] out these traits in them that were some
[1:29:09] of them I would say yeah even uh
[1:29:11] Supernatural in a
[1:29:15] sense so let me read this now putting on
[1:29:19] the whole armor of God bam says just let
[1:29:21] them surrender to me and I'll walk in
[1:29:23] them I'll talk in them speak in them
[1:29:26] work in them oh my that's it I'll do the
[1:29:30] do I'll do the work just let them humble
[1:29:33] themselves let them just empty up
[1:29:37] Hallelujah and I I like it that the
[1:29:38] empty up was was underline because that
[1:29:41] is what we need a lot of time we go
[1:29:43] before the Lord we cry upon him he pour
[1:29:46] out his Spirit but we have nothing to
[1:29:49] receive because it's filled up with so
[1:29:52] much junk and I will never stop talking
[1:29:55] about this right we fill up with so much
[1:29:58] junk we want to know how what what the
[1:30:00] financial Market is going and who is
[1:30:03] playing this weekend and what is going
[1:30:05] on in Washington and and what in Ottawa
[1:30:08] and and and then Municipal politics and
[1:30:11] it's on and on and on and on where does
[1:30:14] God's spirit
[1:30:17] go so we need to
[1:30:20] empty and you know what the more you
[1:30:23] feed the more you empty out because if
[1:30:25] you're feeding on the word of God there
[1:30:27] isn't enough room for Junk praise the
[1:30:29] name of the Lord and that's why the
[1:30:31] scripture says what we shall eat in
[1:30:34] plenty so everything that follows eating
[1:30:37] in eating in plenty if you don't eat in
[1:30:39] plenty those things don't
[1:30:41] follow praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:30:45] hallelujah so I would say this that God
[1:30:48] has a plan for today and will be only be
[1:30:52] worth our s if you commit completely to
[1:30:55] that plan
[1:30:58] Hallelujah now the story we read in in
[1:31:00] we just read it begins when David Goes
[1:31:03] to join the Philistines to battle
[1:31:06] because now the Philistines are going to
[1:31:08] battle and uh David is going to go with
[1:31:14] uh Ashes to they're actually going to
[1:31:16] fight with Israel but David is going
[1:31:19] with them and so the princes come and
[1:31:22] users comes and behind asish there is
[1:31:25] David and the other princess recognize
[1:31:28] him what is that not David isn't that
[1:31:32] the guy that they sang about him and
[1:31:34] said Saul has killed his th000 and this
[1:31:36] guy has killed his 10,000 are you crazy
[1:31:38] why do you bring him
[1:31:40] here and they said oh no he's been good
[1:31:42] he's been with me for a while and it's
[1:31:43] been good no problem said no way you
[1:31:46] know what they hate him in Israel now
[1:31:48] but if he can cut all our heads and
[1:31:50] present it to his master then he'll be
[1:31:52] rejoined to them
[1:31:55] and so and I believe that is the word of
[1:31:57] the the spirit of God in operation they
[1:32:00] insist on uses and he kicks David out
[1:32:03] and so now David is turned away and
[1:32:06] David and his spent travel for three
[1:32:08] days like we read now you're going to
[1:32:12] battle and then you are returning home
[1:32:15] you expect to at least return to some
[1:32:17] calm some semblance of normal life meet
[1:32:21] family loved one something you get home
[1:32:24] and there is no family not even their
[1:32:27] dead bodies you get home and there is no
[1:32:30] house a place where you can get down and
[1:32:33] take water and drink there is no place
[1:32:35] for you to even lay your head it's burnt
[1:32:39] down there is no
[1:32:42] City and so then the Gloom sets
[1:32:45] in Hallelujah after all what is the
[1:32:48] meaning of
[1:32:49] life when if you don't belong anywhere
[1:32:53] you cannot point to any place and say
[1:32:55] here I'm going to sleep here no there's
[1:32:57] nothing on all the Earth because you
[1:32:59] have been rejected from Israel You're an
[1:33:02] enemy territory and the place that you
[1:33:04] have for yourself is
[1:33:06] non-existent and so these people for the
[1:33:09] first time these people were
[1:33:12] unhappy and unfortunately they turned
[1:33:15] their unhappiness towards David and then
[1:33:18] they trying to they contemplating
[1:33:20] stoning David can you imagine the man
[1:33:23] who gave them a purpose for their life
[1:33:27] the man who turned their lives around he
[1:33:29] was the very representation of
[1:33:31] leadership and purpose and all of that
[1:33:35] at a time when their wives and children
[1:33:37] are in in play they forgot about
[1:33:41] everything and then they contemplating
[1:33:44] Stone in him now remember these are
[1:33:47] people some of whom will take on a whole
[1:33:50] Battalion of army just to get a bucket
[1:33:52] of water for David
[1:33:54] David trusted them with his
[1:33:56] life but you see what was happening was
[1:34:00] this because there are times that we all
[1:34:02] get to that situation where God places
[1:34:05] in a position where the people who love
[1:34:07] us the people who support us their eyes
[1:34:10] are blinded toward our
[1:34:12] it their ears are completely Deen toward
[1:34:15] our it you turn around there's nobody to
[1:34:18] listen to you it's as if everybody hates
[1:34:20] you what is happening God is telling you
[1:34:22] to look up
[1:34:24] it's a life lesson that we all must
[1:34:27] learn to look up praise the name of the
[1:34:32] Lord and that's why the scripture says
[1:34:35] David encouraged himself in the
[1:34:38] Lord what is it to encourage yourself in
[1:34:41] the Lord is to tap into that word stored
[1:34:45] in your heart so you can never do it if
[1:34:49] that word is not in you already you tap
[1:34:52] into it you find your identity there not
[1:34:56] what your environment is telling you no
[1:34:58] in the word that is Tau in your heart
[1:35:00] that is where your identity is you tap
[1:35:03] into that and see how far you have come
[1:35:05] who has brought you this far what is the
[1:35:08] way forward praise the name of the Lord
[1:35:10] and so that is what David did he sought
[1:35:13] the Lord
[1:35:17] hallelujah and so
[1:35:19] absolutely there is no way he could have
[1:35:21] done this without
[1:35:24] the Lord with him and in him the word
[1:35:28] Tau in him now the innermost circle is
[1:35:30] turning against
[1:35:34] him this is a situation that happened to
[1:35:37] practically everybody in the
[1:35:40] Bible our time is practically up it
[1:35:44] happened to
[1:35:45] Daniel it happened to Joseph they all
[1:35:48] had to tap into the word that they have
[1:35:50] stored in their hearts because what they
[1:35:52] were looking at and they were listening
[1:35:54] to was telling them a different
[1:35:56] situation Hallelujah and I believe that
[1:35:59] the bride is at that time now where we
[1:36:02] have nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:06] but remember he he creat a situation
[1:36:08] like that because he loves you he wants
[1:36:10] to have a one inone with you don't deny
[1:36:13] him that give him the time give him the
[1:36:17] reverence give his position to him
[1:36:22] Hallelujah and so the families have been
[1:36:25] kidnapped let's
[1:36:27] see
[1:36:29] okay that is
[1:36:31] it what we have received provides for
[1:36:35] every situation in this day am and I'm
[1:36:38] just about
[1:36:39] ending says in the end time evangelist
[1:36:42] the end time message is to get a bride
[1:36:43] ready and prepared for the
[1:36:46] Rapture now you cannot read this and
[1:36:50] says I want to get the end time message
[1:36:52] plus
[1:36:54] you want the Rapture either brother
[1:36:57] Abraham is lying or you stick to this
[1:37:00] the end time message is to get the bride
[1:37:03] ready and prepared for the bride so what
[1:37:05] can it do according to Malachi 4 it
[1:37:07] brings them back to the faith that was
[1:37:09] once delivered to the
[1:37:12] Saints and so how can we get there this
[1:37:15] is God's provided way you can try your
[1:37:17] wisdom and see where it will let you
[1:37:21] Hallelujah and so
[1:37:24] David encouraged himself in the Lord
[1:37:27] hallelujah he called for an effort and
[1:37:31] then the Lord showed him the way forward
[1:37:34] and he got a renewed purpose he went
[1:37:38] back to the people he did not go to tell
[1:37:41] them oh come on you know what I've done
[1:37:42] for you and how I've LED you no no no no
[1:37:44] no he went with the word of God again
[1:37:48] and then the word of God gave them a
[1:37:50] renewed purpose and so what did they do
[1:37:53] they got up and it was three things it
[1:37:56] says pursue overtake and
[1:37:59] recover we don't have time to talk about
[1:38:01] that but pretty much if we keep our
[1:38:04] focus on the Lord we will pursue we will
[1:38:08] overtake and we recover every single
[1:38:12] time it's a promise of God
[1:38:16] hallelujah Glu now what happens is that
[1:38:20] when they came back and the place was
[1:38:22] Pent the Bible say they wept so there
[1:38:24] was no strength in them but when they
[1:38:27] received the word of God and the way
[1:38:29] forward they got the energy again and
[1:38:32] they traveled and they overtook now they
[1:38:35] got to even the river braas 200 soldiers
[1:38:38] stayed back that is for you and I to
[1:38:41] understand that the situation of
[1:38:43] hopelessness and exhaustion was
[1:38:45] real it was real but those who trust in
[1:38:49] the Lord they kept
[1:38:51] going and so 400 people attacked a
[1:38:54] bigger Army a larger Army you say how do
[1:38:56] you know because the scripture says
[1:38:58] Those Who fled alone were
[1:39:00] 400 so just those who fled were were as
[1:39:04] many as those who were
[1:39:06] attacking and so there was a larger Army
[1:39:09] but they overtook them and they
[1:39:11] recovered
[1:39:14] everything so brother sister I've cut
[1:39:17] things up a little bit what I want to
[1:39:20] say and if you'll permit me this is your
[1:39:22] brother saying
[1:39:23] that if in being weak and being
[1:39:26] distressed and feeling hopeless the word
[1:39:29] of God could lead you to overtake and
[1:39:32] recover all that the devil has taken
[1:39:34] from you then may I say that the word of
[1:39:37] God has strength in it that the word of
[1:39:39] God has courage in it that the word of
[1:39:42] God has stamina in it that it can lead
[1:39:44] us to
[1:39:46] Victory it does so why not get more of
[1:39:52] it PR the name of the Lorden you see
[1:39:55] this is one place in spiritual sense
[1:39:58] that we can get fat because that's what
[1:40:00] the body does when we get fat it is
[1:40:03] storing energy for the future so this is
[1:40:06] one place where gluton is
[1:40:10] allowed
[1:40:12] hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of
[1:40:14] the Living God the word of God became
[1:40:17] the rallying point for these people amen
[1:40:20] hallelujah
[1:40:25] now the choice to focus on the Lord I
[1:40:28] I'll I I'll call the musician
[1:40:31] son the choice to focus on the Lord and
[1:40:36] to focus on purpose it will always
[1:40:39] dissipate the
[1:40:41] Gloom Hallelujah it always does and the
[1:40:46] devil's work is always to distract you
[1:40:49] from purpose of God Amen and so one
[1:40:52] thing is sure
[1:40:54] he will not be successful if you are
[1:40:56] focused on the word he will not be
[1:40:58] successful if you are feeding he'll not
[1:41:01] be successful if you are praying he'll
[1:41:03] not be successful if you are careful
[1:41:06] what you listen to he will not be
[1:41:08] successful if you are careful what you
[1:41:10] you hear what you look at as well
[1:41:13] because the all of these are
[1:41:14] distractions the devil has absolutely no
[1:41:17] power when you are focused on purpose
[1:41:20] you have been called to be the sinless
[1:41:22] partless bright of the Lord Jesus Christ
