Um we know that the Bible says that the devil goes around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. But that same Bible tells us that God has not given us a spirit of fear. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the spirit of love, power, and of a sound mind. &gt;&gt; And so the choir here wants to give their testimony of how with God we should have no fear. So if that is your testimony and you know the song, please feel free to sing along, clap along. Let's give God all the glory today, okay? And let's show the devil that he has no control over us. No matter what situation he brings to us, be it financial, be it health, be it family, be it whatever it is, in everything that the devil brings our way with God, we will have no fear.

Though I [music and singing] walk through the valley, I [music and singing] will have no fear, no fear, no fear. The mighty [singing] power of [music] Jesus is fighting for me. No fear, &gt;&gt; no fear, &gt;&gt; no [singing] fear, &gt;&gt; no fear. &gt;&gt; The light of the world makes the darkness [music] disappear. No fear, my [music] life. [singing] No fear.

Thank you, choir. You did an amazing job. Thank you, brother Jason. Know you've been very involved. Of course, Lisa and Joel and everybody else, you've been very involved in putting that together. Thank you and God bless you for your efforts. Stand with me if you would as we change the order this even this morning. Sorry. I love this song. Thinking of Mary in the alabaster box. And there's a movie out there called The Chosen. I saw one episode where the Sadducees are just just completely annoyed about this woman crying with her tears up and and using the alabaster box [music] to anoint the Savior. Had no idea who they were talking to or who who they were in the midst of but didn't affect Mary one bit. She just kept on worshiping the Lord. May we do that with our praise this morning. Lord, may we pour our love on you. You're so worthy. I talk about it often. What an amazing husband he is. He's not a He's a gentleman. He never kicks a door down. Unlike me that have a constant fight with this flesh. He doesn't. He's just a gentleman. He loves embraces. He enjoys the love you bring back to him. Let's sing it this morning. Well, I don't know just exactly how I feel. [singing and music] has been. I'm lost [music] for words. [music] Is [singing] there a way to show you passion [music] in my heart? Can I express [music] how truly great I think you are? My dearest [music] pray [music] [singing] this is my desire [music] to pour [music] my love [singing] on you. Like oil upon your feet, like white, like water [music] from my heart. [singing] I pour my love on you. Embrace it like [music] I lavish my till every drop is gone. [music and singing] I'll pour my love on [music] you. Is there a way to [music] show the [singing] passion in my heart? Can I express how truly great I [music and singing] think you are? Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; My [music] go [singing] for you. [music] I [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. Welcome each one once again to the house of the Lord. Certainly an honor and a privilege to gather together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We're certainly thankful for each one present today. Certainly good to see your faces again to have the Odenovo back in [music] our midst after traveling to Nigeria. God bless you. [music] John Ojera who was in Nigeria as well. The Lord's given him traveling mercies as well. We never take it for granted when we travel the mercy of the Lord in our lives this morning. We're certainly thankful to have all of our visitors with us as well. Um not going to try and name everyone. I don't want to miss anyone. Just want to make sure that we acknowledge you and welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I trust you get your fill today. &gt;&gt; If you come expecting, God always meets our expectations. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it just depends on what we're looking at. That's what we'll receive. I just wanted to mention one thing that was announced [music] last week, Brother Ed Hammermeister being ill with cancer and having a diagnosis that was terrible. And uh you know, he sent me a text [music] this week and it was just wonderful to see that you know, that was the doctor's report. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. originally, but there's more to the story &gt;&gt; because there's a great physician. &gt;&gt; And the great physician doesn't have the [music] same report as the doctor. &gt;&gt; And in brother Ed's life, that's the story today. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the grim outlook that the doctor's report said that we, you know, heard last week. And uh we're certainly thankful for that. So, I'm sure he definitely still [music] covetss our prayers, but we thank the Lord for his healing touch in his life. Just a few announcements before we get into the the word today. We've got a prayer meeting coming up on Thursday the 4th of December. I'll be going to Grand Prairie that weekend [music] for the 5th, 6th, and 7th. I'll be taking three services there. So, I coveret your prayers and uh brother Don Snow will [music] take the service on Sunday the 7th here. We have uh a youth service here on the 12th [music] at 7:30 and then we have on the 21st we'll be having the youth event in the afternoon after service. And uh remember the 31st which is a Wednesday evening we will have a communion worship service. Some might call them a watch night service, but I don't like to say watch [music] night because we might not be here till midnight. We just want to be here as long as the spirit moves, as long as we feel happy to be here. So, for those who don't know, brother Cadre Diggs is here from Columbia, South Carolina. He's been coming to Calgary for many years. I got to meet him with brother Ken here, and you know, he's just become a real good friend of mine since. And uh as we heard yesterday night, the Lord spoke to [music] us through our brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you want to hear from the Lord today, just push aside all of your humanity and say amen to the word. Don't make him bring out his sign and see if God doesn't speak to you today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing this chorus once again as we invite brother Cadre to come and just take his liberty. Like oil upon your feet, [singing] like wine for you to drink, like water [music and singing] from my heart, I pour my love on you. If praise is my perfe. you. [music] I [singing] love my till [music] my love [music] on you. is there [singing and music] a way to show the passion [music and singing] in my heart. Can I [music] express how truly great I think you [music and singing] are my dearest friend. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [singing and music] Yeah. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; One more time. Like oil upon your [music] feet. Like oil upon [singing] your &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Heat. Heat. [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads unto the Lord. Amen. As we bow our heads and close our eyes, you have an unspoken request, you can acknowledge it unto the Lord by an uplifted hand. We all are in need of something from God. Lord Jesus, we lift our hands to you, Lord, as an act of faith, Lord. Lord, we defy gravity to show that our need is greater. But Lord, in asking, Lord, let it be so, Father, that we receive nothing but your perfect will in our lives, Lord. For we know if it's your will, there'll be no expiration date. &gt;&gt; It won't cause any trouble. It won't offset anything, but it'll run in continuity with life &gt;&gt; because it's your will. And Lord, our desire is to crave nothing [music] but your will, not your permissible will. &gt;&gt; But Lord God, to be in a channel, Lord, of life where we can grow and &gt;&gt; we can see you, Lord, glorified &gt;&gt; in our actions, Lord, &gt;&gt; in our thought pattern, in our behavior, &gt;&gt; in everything we do. Lord, our desire is just to please you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So Lord, in asking, Father, we pray that you will touch our hearts, Lord, that we won't crave anything, &gt;&gt; but the things of God. &gt;&gt; Lord, search us, Lord. Continue to make us fit for the master's use, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, and mold us into the image of your [music] thoughts, the image of your mind, &gt;&gt; Lord. And sometimes we don't understand what you're doing, Lord, but we are the clay and you're the potter. And we pray Lord that your hands will be upon us and continue to mold us Lord and shape us &gt;&gt; by your word Lord. Lord, we pray for this church, Lord. You would just continue to bless, Lord, and pour out your spirit, Lord, and as a people, Lord, help us to go beyond just the thoughts of men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let us see you revealed in your word, Lord, for we know that you're a God and simplicity. And we know that you brought gifts upon the earth, Lord, to use those gifts to continue to bring the people closer to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Lord, we lay down every gift at your feet today, Lord, &gt;&gt; that you may use it, Lord, that someone may be edified. &gt;&gt; Lord, if there's a need of a healing, we pray that the healer would move as he always does. &gt;&gt; If someone is bound, Lord, we pray that the deliverer would deliver this morning. and whatever need there is, Lord. Lord, we put you in place to be God. For you're our all and all. Lord, forgive us for our sins and trespasses, Lord. Lord, take this beyond just a church service, &gt;&gt; a Sunday morning, which can be no more than just tradition. Take us out of tradition, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Lord, bring us into that place like Adam and Eve when they came together, they knew they were meeting God Almighty, Lord. That's where we want to be. We believe that those days are restored. That time is restored where God comes down in the cool of the day and speaks to his children. Lord, will you operate the gift today, Lord? &gt;&gt; Lord, and in hearing, Lord, let the people hear what the spirit is saying. In the wonderful name Jesus Christ, we pray. Let church say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church say amen again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord today. &gt;&gt; How many glad about it? &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise. [applause] Praise the Lord. [applause] Certainly enjoyed the worship. Amen. I hope you did. Hallelujah. Because we want Amen. the worship to go up before God and he could send down the fire upon our altars. Amen. Again, we thank God [music] for our pastor. Amen. Brother Barry, Pastor Johnson. Amen. We thank God for him and his his wife, his family. Amen. Thank God for all of you. You know, as a minister, when you come and preach, you just you just like last night, you know, it it wasn't hard to preach, you know, because of the atmosphere you guys set, you know, and that's a credit to the word that you're hearing, you know. So I thank God for men that just stay with [music] the word and you know when you come and you step behind the desk and we just stay with the word and we follow up in that same manner everybody will be blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we want to see. We want to see Christ. Amen. But um most of all we appreciate the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm here to say that I don't have what you need but Christ does. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you focus in on him, if you pull on him, he'll grant your heart's desire. Amen. Let's let's just um turn in our Bibles to John St. John chapter 4. We appreciate all the music. That'll be it for now. St. John chapter 4. Y'all gonna have to pray for me. I left my alarm. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that clock right? &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay, I'm about to close. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; St. John chapter 4 verse 21. The Bible says Jesus saith unto her,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship. For salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipper shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit, &gt;&gt; and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh, which is called Christ. when he has come, he will tell us all things. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to uh the book of Psalms 151. Psalms 150 150 verse one. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, before I read this verse of scripture, I want to let you know today that what I'm about to speak on is going to be a challenge for some of you. It's going to start with these vers of scriptures right here I'm about to read. The Bible says one Psalms 150 verse1. Praise ye the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God in his sanctuary. &gt;&gt; Praise him in the firminant of his power. &gt;&gt; Praise him for his mighty acts. &gt;&gt; Now, as we go through the scripture, recognize praise doesn't just stop in the sanctuary. But it's going to keep saying, Amen. It's going to keep giving us reasons to give him praise. &gt;&gt; It says, "Praise him in the firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts. Praise him according to his excellent greatness. &gt;&gt; Praise him with the sound of the trumpet. Praise him with the sulties and heart. &gt;&gt; Praise him with the timberal and dance." Oh my. &gt;&gt; You mean dancing is all right in your praise? I told you it's going to be a challenge to some of us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Praise him with the string instruments and organs. &gt;&gt; Praise him upon the loud symbols. My Where's the symbols? The symbols are on the drums. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not in Africa. Right here in Calgary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; According to the Bible. Right. &gt;&gt; Praise him upon the high sounding symbols. &gt;&gt; Let everything that hath breath &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise ye the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, let's give God a hand clap of praise. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have your seats. You know, last night we took a a a title, spirit and truth. Well, this morning, even in the verse of scriptures we just read, the Bible says that the true worshippers when they come to worship, they're going to worship in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, uh by the grace of God, I think we identified the spirit and the truth last night. But let's identify the worshiper this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look, my subject, my title is a revelation of worship. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A revelation of worship. &gt;&gt; Now when it comes to worship, it's a very very sticky area. &gt;&gt; And what makes it sticky is that we when we think of worship, what we do is we concentrate on sound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Worship is not Hallelujah. the dictation of sound. &gt;&gt; Real worship is a person. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Real worship is a revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; But what's happened is we've made worship our sound. We may worship how the piano is played. We may worship uh how the drums are played or the string instruments and all these different things. Yes, that's a part of it. But worship is a true revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus told this woman that the true worshipper, he said, "You worship and you know not what you worship. He wasn't talking about an instrument." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a revelation inside what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; So, as I'm preaching this morning, I want you to ask yourself, [screaming] do I have the revelation? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But, but what we've done, we've made worship about music and about this artist and that artist. That's a part of it. Hallelujah. But we not worshiping people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're worshiping one God. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand something this morning. Every song that was sung in the right channel was only to one person in this church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that wasn't to any personal individual. It was unto the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the one I want to receive my worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now we know that through a vindicated prophet he said God the word God means what? An object of [screaming] worship. &gt;&gt; So while you're worshiping Amen. Hallelujah. Your worship really [screaming] tells what's the image of God in your p in your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For those of you who may never clap your hands, who who may never stand to your feet, who may never exalt the Lord, it shows what you think about him. Hallelujah. The Bible says, "Praise him for his mighty acts. &gt;&gt; Praise him for his power. Praise him in the sanctuary." Hallelujah. Praise him for his goodness. Praise him for his healing power. [cheering] I'm saying today in this church, everybody should have a reason to give God praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But what I want you to understand, Hallelujah. Nobody [screaming] in here has a patent on how we should give God praise. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. There's a rumor. &gt;&gt; There's a rumor that goes around in churches and I've seen it all over the world when it comes to worship. And you know, and no matter where you go, they always say that this rumor, they say that black people are the only ones who shop. &gt;&gt; Is that just a rumor? &gt;&gt; Some of y'all smiling. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is it a rumor or Hallelujah or is it that nobody has a patent on reasons to shout for God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And that's what it should be. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we we we we know that the prophet said, "The further up north you go, the colder it get." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. Thank you. We want to Hallelujah. deal with some of these myths &gt;&gt; that have been Hallelujah. put about in the church. Hallelujah. Just because I'm in Canada, that doesn't mean I don't I I I I shouldn't dance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Or I shouldn't clap my hands. If it's in the Bible, I got a right to do it. &gt;&gt; But the thing of it is is, hallelujah. We want to do it by revelation. Not because somebody else is doing it, not because [screaming] it's a part of my culture. God don't care about your culture. [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother D, where I'm from, we're quiet. We want to steal small voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, let me say it like this. There are some there are some words I may deal with today that may challenge you. Hallelujah. In heaven, there won't be a word. There won't be a person called an introvert. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But let's get into it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I told you it was going to be challenging because what we've done, we've we've we we've made worship about the sound, about the music, about the instruments and all these things. And our worship should be a revelation. &gt;&gt; Your worship should be testifying of who you're worshiping. Amen. But you know when we look in the scripture, Jesus was telling her, "You worship, you know not what you worship her." But he says, "We know who we worship." Now, if you see me kicking and dancing and screaming and holling or crying or whatever, raising my hand, trust me, I'm doing that because it's something that's that's reflecting Hallelujah. reflecting God. Hallelujah. And it causes me to give him praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, church, as I look at it, if I look at worship and I begin to think about it, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me hit you with something real quick. You know, and and what's happened is uh [clears throat] we may worship this this nice steel thing and my culture this and my church this and my church that. He said, "Praise God in the sanctuary." &gt;&gt; But look, listen to what your own prophet said. Now, the prophet says, "I like to worship." Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't you now we don't come." Oh my. Now, this when I read this, Hallelujah. It it it just shattered some of the things I've heard in church. It shattered some of the things that I heard in [clears throat] the end time ministry. Hallelujah. Because you know what we do? I've heard this. I used to be a song leader. So, this right here is very near and dear to me. Hallelujah. You know, I will hear preachers say, "Hey, let's get the worship out the way because the best part of the service is the preaching of the word. I'm sure most of us has heard that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know you're afraid to say amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But listen what the prophet of God says. He says, "I like to worship. Don't you?" Now, we don't come to church just to hear a sermon. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said that goes with it. But we come to church to worship. Worship in spirit and in truth. You've heard the truth. That's the word. See, now to worship is to express yourself [screaming] to him. This is coming from a vindicated [screaming] prophet. It says once I've heard the word, I have a right to express myself. &gt;&gt; Why? Because something about God has been revealed to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what we've done, we say, "Hey, let's just get this. Let's do this 15 minutes, 20 minutes, or whatever. Get it out the way so we can hear the word." God is [screaming] an object of worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'll say this to you, word only people. We got the word, brother Digs. We're so beyond this, so beyond that. Well, let me say this. When we get to heaven, ain't going to be no preaching. Ain't going [screaming] to be no preaching in heaven. &gt;&gt; The only thing heaven is going to be full of is a bunch of worshippers. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God [screaming] says what you are over here is what you're going to be over there. So if you can't worship God here, you're surely not going to be there. [laughter] Because the Bible says, hallelujah. In that day, every knee will bow. Every tongue will confess that he is Lord. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; See, it always comes back to who you believe God is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother say, "I got a gift. I can preach. I can." Your gift ain't gonna mean nothing in heaven &gt;&gt; because the giver himself is going to be in display. &gt;&gt; It's going to be all about [screaming] worship. &gt;&gt; The greatest preacher you can think about is going to be a worshipper standing right beside you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Paul a worshipper. Jeremiah a worshshiper. David a worshipper. Brother Brand, I'm a worshshiper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Biscoll a worshshiper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Billy Graham, hallelujah, a worshshiper. &gt;&gt; Or Roberts, a worshshiper. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Diggs, you including them." The prophet included them in this message. He said they were a part of those three angels. &gt;&gt; They had [screaming] a part to play. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, that's what we do. We cancel people out according to their worship. &gt;&gt; But look, he said, "We don't come to church just to hear a good sermon." Hallelujah. We come to worship him. &gt;&gt; Because God is the object of worship. &gt;&gt; And we know that the prophet of God said, "You going to worship something." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of us worship our jobs. That's why we ain't here to church every every time the doors open. Some of us worship family members. That's why, hallelujah, we can't go any further in God. Hallelujah. And different things we may worship that's in the place of God. Hallelujah. But God wants to move that all the all of that out the way and give you a revelation that he is the only one &gt;&gt; that you should be giving arms to. &gt;&gt; Now you think about it. Do you know what you worship &gt;&gt; or who you worship? It's a revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. which goes way beyond the sound of things. Even in the beginning, hallelujah. Look, when when God came down to have fellowship with Adam and Eve, what did they do? They worship. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say this, and I want it to be real plain. That had nothing to do with the piano. &gt;&gt; There was no [screaming] piano there. &gt;&gt; It was just two people. Hallelujah. Created in the image of God. And when God came down, they offered up worship to him. Hallelujah. They were giving back the life that they that he gave to them. Hal, [screaming] it was a revelation to be in God's presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you think about it. The Bible says wherever two or three are gathered, there would I also be in the midst. And you mean to tell me you're not going to worship? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God came down and see I told you I was going to challenge you this morning. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because like I say, we've put it on our background and where we come from and our family and traditions and all these things that should only be about God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But look church, as we look at the worship and I ain't going to be long. I'm about to close. Hallelujah. As we look as we look into these things, he says, "And he's the spirit." God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. And God, the very word God means object of worship. So God likes to be worshiped by his children. Why? &gt;&gt; Why does God push us in these atmospheres to worship? There's a there's a purpose behind it. He said, hallelujah. He likes to be worshiped by his children that we can be free and not bound down in yolks. [screaming] So worship comes to set us free. &gt;&gt; Worship comes to loosen the yolks [screaming] around our necks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can tell [screaming] how free somebody is by their worship. &gt;&gt; You can watch a husband and wife and see who's angry. That's &gt;&gt; right. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You [snorts] can see a man in church and he's clapping his hands and praising the Lord and our wife looking at him like &gt;&gt; she knows something that we don't know. Hallelujah. Church, listen. He says, "But we can exercise our faith in him and believe it and not be ashamed." That's the reason why we don't have much expression in church because we're ashamed. We're ashamed. What? Somebody may think that I get around the church and run. &gt;&gt; We're ashamed that when we're hearing the word and tears start to come down your eyes and somebody may come, you say, "What you crying for?" &gt;&gt; It's an expression &gt;&gt; of how good God has been. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; And I know it's going to be a challenge for some of you because spiritually in these areas, some of us are lazy. You got it. &gt;&gt; And we'll blame it on coordination. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you feel like because I'm not coordinated, I just ain't going to clap my hands at all. That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation. &gt;&gt; What does God mean to you? &gt;&gt; Is he worthy of the clapping of your hands? Because the Bible says, hallelujah, clap your hands all ye saints. [applause] &gt;&gt; No, I'm not trying to excite you, but I want you to see, hallelujah, your revelation of the object you worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But look, church, he says, "Does it make our face so our oh my, this is this is going to hit real real close to home." He said, "It doesn't make our face red to testify of the glory of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, he's not talking to me cuz my face don't turn red when it comes to talking about God. Hallelujah. When I feel ashamed about something, my face don't turn red. It hides real good. But some of you, your cheeks are turning red right now. [laughter] Hallelujah. But not in a bad way today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. He says, "What is it?" God condescending to his creation. God wants to be worshiped. The word God means object of worship. And it's God trying to condition his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we say, "Well, that artist, I can't sing that." It's God trying to condition his people. &gt;&gt; My oh my. God trying to condition his people so that he can get from them what he created them for. &gt;&gt; So in your worship, God is trying to pull something out of you that's already there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you're thinking it's just about the song. No, that worship is going to bring forth a release. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's something inside of you hiding, but that worship can bring it out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of you may be bogged down in sadness, but that worship can bring real joy out. Some of you might have sickness in your body, but that worship can bring forth the healing. There's something inside of you. Hallelujah. There's a revelation in you that only worship can bring out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. church. When I had cancer in my brain, hallelujah, God is intentional. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He allowed that to happen. Why? Because there was something inside of me, but the only way I could get it out, only way it could come out is that I first had to have cancer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why cancer? Because cancer was the only thing that could bring out the revelation of Jehovah Rafi, &gt;&gt; that God is a healer. Hallelujah. So God allowed something to happen just to get me in the place where I will worship and the revelation will unfold out of me as I [screaming] worship. As I gave God praise, the healer came on the scene. Hallelujah. And the healer, hallelujah, destroyed what was going on in my flesh and gave me a revelation [screaming] that still holds true to today. Once you become a real worshipper, [screaming] that revelation will follow you through eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; we go from Adam and Eve and they worship God just being in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we in his presence? &gt;&gt; Now, think about this. I want you to think about this. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; What reason did they have? &gt;&gt; Was it a car? &gt;&gt; Was it a house? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Was it the children that he gave them? &gt;&gt; Was it a good job? &gt;&gt; They worshiped him just because he was God. &gt;&gt; That was the revelation. &gt;&gt; Just because he's God. He don't have to do anything. &gt;&gt; God, just come down and I'll give you what you deserve. &gt;&gt; That's what Adam and Eve did. Hallelujah. They didn't worship him because of material things. They worshiped because they were glad to be in his presence. &gt;&gt; They worship because God was faithful. They worship because God Hallelujah. Even though he was God, he was never too busy to come down and show them that he loves them. &gt;&gt; But for us, we look for reasons. Lord, bless me with this and bless me with that. and [screaming] I'll give you praise. &gt;&gt; It wasn't so in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; See, so you look at the object, they worshiped him just because he was God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He would come down. It wasn't because of a good paycheck. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was Adam. Adam didn't worship God because of Eve. He worshiped because he was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God came down and showed himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now we're in the presence of that same God. And we need a reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; My my my. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might be saying right now, you know, if somebody else shout, I'mma shout. You know, we do it. That's that's what you call learn behavior. &gt;&gt; That's not revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, if we go to the next stage, &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve has two boys. Hallelujah. That we that they raised up in their house. But then there comes a time where they have to go and what? Worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And let me say this to you. In that process of time when they went to worship, hallelujah, there was no [screaming] piano there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There was no horns. [screaming] &gt;&gt; There were no string instruments. &gt;&gt; All they were going to do is testify of the God that they believed in. &gt;&gt; But now they were going to show God their revelation of him in worship. &gt;&gt; Not by sound &gt;&gt; but by revelation. &gt;&gt; Now you look the Bible says Cain went first and Cain started to worship. He gave him of the first fruit of his offering. You know if you know something came from the ground. It may have been apples or oranges or or tangerines or vegetables. Whatever it was, he came and brought that before God. Now I want you to understand something. It wasn't something moldy. &gt;&gt; It wasn't something stale. &gt;&gt; It was something fresh. &gt;&gt; It was the best he had. &gt;&gt; And he came and gave that to God. And God said, "Get that mess out of here. I don't want something nice and cute and pretty. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; I don't want something that you think I ought to want. I want your revelation. &gt;&gt; I want you. Hallelujah. See, where Cain messed it up. Hallelujah. God didn't want fruit. God wanted life. &gt;&gt; And what we do, [screaming] we'll give God our gifts, but we won't give him our life. Your gift is no good unless there's a life behind it. Your worship is no good unless there's a [laughter] life behind it. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; So what? You got a good voice and no Holy Ghost. That don't mean nothing. &gt;&gt; So what you can bring down the house with your instrument, that don't mean nothing unless the Holy Ghost is behind it. &gt;&gt; And that's what Cain did. He gave God his fruit, but he wouldn't give God his life. &gt;&gt; And God said, "I don't want that mess. Keep in mind on the outward appearance it looked good. &gt;&gt; He was saying God should accept this and he brought it to the Lord and the Bible say God rejected it and Cain walked away mad. Then Abel comes &gt;&gt; Abel comes. &gt;&gt; Abel comes with that that lamb. He's bringing it into God's presence. Hallelujah. And the prophet said he believed he had got a rock and he started to hack it up. &gt;&gt; He started to kill it. Amen. See, what was he doing? He was worshiping. &gt;&gt; First thing, your worship should always bring us back to the life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your worship should be revealing the life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And look, hallelujah. Abel. Abel now has the lamb. Hallelujah. Which is a type of Christ in his worship. &gt;&gt; And now he's hagging it up. Hagging it up. Why? So that he can pour out blood upon the altar. &gt;&gt; All of that was being revealed in his worship. His mom and daddy was standing there like, "Wow, who told him? &gt;&gt; Who told him, hallelujah, that I had two men in my life?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hallelujah. Look, church, Adam and Eve were not there. I mean, Cain and Abel were not there when God led Adam and Eve [screaming] out of the garden clothed in skins of animals, &gt;&gt; dripping in blood. &gt;&gt; So, where did he learn [screaming] how to worship like that? &gt;&gt; It was a revelation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your revelation should be revealing something in your worship. &gt;&gt; It shouldn't be just a good song. &gt;&gt; Because in this worship, there was no piano. There was no drums. [screaming] There was no hordes. There was no strings. It was only an unveiling of the life inside. [applause] &gt;&gt; Let's get the [screaming] life back in church. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can imagine Adam and Eve are standing there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they're watching Cain. They're like, "Wow, God didn't accept that." And now they're watching Abel and they're like, "Oh my, did you tell him?" Eve's looking at Adam. Did you tell him what I did? &gt;&gt; How do he know that it was blood? &gt;&gt; Yeah. How does he know &gt;&gt; that it takes blood to forgive us of our sins? &gt;&gt; How does he know that in the years to come there will be a sacrificial lamb? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All of that was revealed in his worship. &gt;&gt; Adam didn't even teach him that. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, when you really find Hallelujah, the real object of worship, it'll bring out Christ every time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, let's let's look at it where you say, "Well, in one place, hallelujah, you look at these two boys going forth to worship." Now, we have to think about it. Hallelujah. What kind of house did they grow up in? And a lot of times we look at our kids, we say, "Man, are you gonna participate in church? Are you gonna clap your hands? Are you going to sing the song? Are you going to do anything?" That's what we do as parents. We We're quick to criticize our kids and look at them and be like, "Come on, get involved." &gt;&gt; And all they doing is doing what you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're watching your nice, quiet, still worship, your no involvement, and all they're doing is catching the same spirit. &gt;&gt; They're catching the life of your worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're receiving it because it's more easy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A young man in my church, I asked him one time, I said, and he's a good a good a good kid. You know, I like to play around with him. You know, I sometimes before service, I say, I want you to be the loudest one saying, "Amen." &gt;&gt; And he'll just smile at me. &gt;&gt; And sometimes I'll catch him going out taking a water break. Cuz you know, kids like to take a water break. &gt;&gt; You know, I'll catch him taking a water break. I said, "Man, I ain't heard you one time." And he'll say, "Amen." So, I know it's in him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look, church, I asked him. I said, "Man, you don't clap your hands. You don't do nothing." You know what he said to me? He said, "My mom and daddy don't." &gt;&gt; Yeah. learn behavior. &gt;&gt; That's not revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You think about it. How many of us uh uh the way we worship? Hallelujah. We do it. Hallelujah. As [clears throat] as as a group of of of the church of Calvary. &gt;&gt; This is how we worship in church. &gt;&gt; That's not revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's learned behavior. Right. &gt;&gt; You know, people say to me, say, "Brother Digs, I just love to come to your church." You'd be shocked &gt;&gt; because me and my pastor are like night and day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's not all over the place. He's not running the aisles all the time and all these things, but people see me and they think everybody in church is crazy. &gt;&gt; No, we are individuals with our own personal revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And my revelation of God and how he's been to me may make me act different from you, but that don't mean, hallelujah, what I do is right and what you do is wrong. &gt;&gt; Or what you do is right and what I do is wrong. &gt;&gt; Because it's much more easier to accept a quiet spirit than a loud spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I'll say this for you. Hallelujah. For those of you who think being loud is out of order, you couldn't be in heaven because the Bible says that the angel said, "Holy, holy, holy," till it shook heaven. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The sound of this worship shook heaven. Hallelujah. Church, we need to be shook up again. &gt;&gt; If angels could say, "Holy, holy, [screaming] holy, Lord God Almighty, holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty." And they didn't have a reason. It was their job. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we got a reason. &gt;&gt; God saved our souls. &gt;&gt; God healed our body. Hallelujah. [screaming] We got a reason. So our worship should still be able to shake heaven. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I start singing, my God is greater. &gt;&gt; My God is stronger. God you are. &gt;&gt; God you are healer. Awesome. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Think about that. &gt;&gt; Think about the revelation of that. &gt;&gt; My God is greater. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How you going to sing that with no expression? &gt;&gt; How you going to talk about how great something is &gt;&gt; and say I'm an introvert. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, you're so great. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My God is healer. &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever been healed? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever been diagnosed with something? Hallelujah. Diagnosed with something and God comes in and shows his greatness. Hallelujah. And you don't want me to worship. [screaming] You don't want me to give him praise. You can't tell my story. [cheering] How good [screaming] God's been to me. You want me to sit down and shut up? [screaming] Well, I'm sorry. God has allowed me to escape death. God has healed my [screaming] body and gave me another chance. [cheering] And this time, I'm not going to mess it up. This time, I'm not going to stop because of what other people may think. But I'm going to give him praise. [cheering] I'm going to worship him. [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; because it's a revelation. [screaming] &gt;&gt; I'm not doing it because it's a duty. &gt;&gt; I'm doing it because it's an expression. &gt;&gt; Church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Awesome in power. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That means no matter what happens, there's nothing that can ever come your way that's stronger than God. [applause] &gt;&gt; Nothing [cheering] &gt;&gt; can ever come your way that's stronger than God. &gt;&gt; He's awesome in power. W. &gt;&gt; That means when God finishes doing what he's doing, we stand there in awe. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Because awesome comes from the [screaming] root word awe. &gt;&gt; And God leaves us in awe because he's so [screaming] great. [cheering] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I know this is a challenge &gt;&gt; cuz some of you are still stuck in your coaches. &gt;&gt; Some of us are still stuck there. &gt;&gt; You know, I don't I don't normally do this. I don't normally clap. I don't normally ask yourself why. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is he worthy? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is he worthy? It's a revelation. &gt;&gt; Listen, church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Adam, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Was the father of his home. &gt;&gt; He was the shepherd of his home. &gt;&gt; He was the lead worshipper. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, a lot of times your kids look at you and they say, "Well, daddy ain't giving God praise. Why should I?" &gt;&gt; All they're doing is picking up your mannerisms. But it takes a real experience with God to break that chain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But look, church, &gt;&gt; Adam raises his boys, raises those boys in a house of worship. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Really? Yes. I want you to catch this picture. Adam never knew anything about the devil. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; The devil never even spoken to Adam. [snorts] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he came to Eve. &gt;&gt; The serpent came to Eve and we knew that the serpent, hallelujah, was in power with the spirit of the enemy, right? Hallelujah. So that that serpent came to Eve. He never made it to Adam &gt;&gt; cuz by the time they all got together, God was handing down judgments. Hallelujah. And he messed the serpent up so bad he couldn't talk anymore. &gt;&gt; So So Adam never even heard the devil's voice. &gt;&gt; Come on. [laughter] [screaming] &gt;&gt; Think about it. It's in your Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They never had a conversation. &gt;&gt; God said, "Who told you this?" He said, "It was the woman." &gt;&gt; Where'd you get it from the woman? The woman said it was the serpent. Then God starts handing down judgments and he changed the whole body of the serpent where the serpent could no longer talk. So he never got to Adam. Adam's worship was pure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; By revelation, &gt;&gt; Adam would lead those boys into worship. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Adam would come to the boys would come in there and Adam would start to sing, "My God is greater. My God is stronger. God, you are higher than any other. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was some days where he could reflect and he realized that he was once a god and now he's just a human being. And you may have sang songs like nobody greater. &gt;&gt; Nobody greater. &gt;&gt; Nobody greater than you. Hallelujah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Adam, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now he's in a sinful condition. Hallelujah. But all he could think about was where he came from. Hallelujah. Now Adam is in he's in Eden. Hallelujah. He's driven out of Eden. Hallelujah. But he has a remembrance of what perfection was. And all he could do was worship by perfection. Hallelujah. Adam can say, "I searched all over. &gt;&gt; Couldn't find nobody. I looked high and low. Still couldn't find nobody. &gt;&gt; Nobody greater, &gt;&gt; nobody greater. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nobody greater than him. See, that was Adam's testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Adam didn't know what failure [screaming] was like until sin came in. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; So his worship was by revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; All he could do was exalt God &gt;&gt; cuz he was created in the image of God. &gt;&gt; All he could talk about was perfection in the goodness of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God was never a failure to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He never lost a battle. [cheering] [applause] [cheering and screaming] &gt;&gt; He could only sing songs of victory. &gt;&gt; He could only sing songs of triumph. He didn't know what it was like to lose. [screaming] &gt;&gt; You know, culturally, &gt;&gt; we have old spirituals, &gt;&gt; slave songs. &gt;&gt; I'm going to hide behind &gt;&gt; that old mountain. &gt;&gt; I ain't hiding behind no mountain. My God say speak to that mountain and it'll move. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I ain't hiding behind no mountain. I ain't singing no old negro spirituals. [applause and cheering] My God say speak to the mountain and the mountain will get out your way. Be careful what you let come out of your mouth. Stop singing those songs that don't identify who you are. &gt;&gt; Sing songs of revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hiding behind the mountain and all that fool. I ain't hiding behind no mountain. &gt;&gt; God says whatsoever you say. [cheering] &gt;&gt; If you if you say it and believe it, what you said will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] Why? It's a revelation. &gt;&gt; Your worship is a revelation. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I could go on and on with that, [snorts] &gt;&gt; you know. And you've heard me say this. We come together and we Hallelujah. I can only imagine what it be like. Sounds so anointed, don't surrounded by your glory. I don't like that song. &gt;&gt; Cuz I don't have to imagine. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be there. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be surrounded around his glory. &gt;&gt; I'm going to hold his hand. I'm going to cut. Hallelujah. I'm going to look at his eyes. Hallelujah. I'm going to follow him around heaven. I don't have to [screaming] imagine. I'm living in the reality of the revealed word. It's a revelation [screaming] to me. &gt;&gt; What will I do? I will give him praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you look, &gt;&gt; Adam didn't teach those boys worship of defeat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because all they all he knew was a good God. &gt;&gt; God, great God, Jehovah. Nobody greater. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See church, and you think about that. Behold, he comes riding on a cloud, shining like the sun. As the trumpet calls, lift your voice. This is the year of jubilee. &gt;&gt; My worship puts me in a jubilee year. [cheering] &gt;&gt; And what does jubilee speak of? Jubilee speaks of freedom. When I sing, I sing because I'm free. &gt;&gt; I worship because God has set me free. &gt;&gt; This is my year of Jubilee. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not bound to alcohol. &gt;&gt; I'm not bound to cigarettes. &gt;&gt; God has set me free. &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; G. Some of you can't worship because you bound. &gt;&gt; You got things in your life that's a reflection before your face. &gt;&gt; And the devil says, "Don't you raise your hand. &gt;&gt; You know you got a problem." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But church, there's also a song we sing. Hallelujah. It says, "I'm not going to wait till the battle is over. &gt;&gt; I'm going to shout now." &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Some of you waiting, hallelujah, till you get the victory. No, you worship because you already know you got the victory. &gt;&gt; You're already healed. I said already healed. No matter what it looks like, you're already [screaming] healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And your worship should reflect your revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we can see according to Revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They worship not according to sound. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, cuz I can take y'all to South Carolina and some of y'all wouldn't be able to follow me because you're worried about the sound. M &gt;&gt; so I can start take you back. Get right church and let's go home. Oh, get right church and let's go home. See, like some of you looking at me now, but there'll be a whole group of people right there with me singing get right church and let's go home. &gt;&gt; Cuz they got a revelation of what I'm singing. Hallelujah. Not the sound, not the style that Hallelujah. One of these old mornings and it won't be long. You're going to look for me and I'll be going on home and I'll be going up heaven where we sing and shout and there will be nobody there to put me out. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; It's not a sound, it's a revelation. &gt;&gt; So that's why I'm living [screaming] right down here on this side because I know there is another home for me. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the crazy part is we'll put words up on the stream and some of you still won't open your mouths. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; That's cuz you don't have a revelation. But if you're singing something that's been revealed to you, &gt;&gt; we love and and and &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't bring uncertain sound &gt;&gt; about what I'm about to say, &gt;&gt; but we love sad songs of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Sad songs of deliverance. You unravel me with a meloyy. I'm no longer a slave. [screaming] &gt;&gt; You should have been realized you weren't a slave. &gt;&gt; The Bible says perfect love castes out all fear. &gt;&gt; I don't need to hear a song to realize that I'm free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't need to hear a song to realize that I got perfect faith. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it's something about those sad songs of deliverance. They we identify with them more. You know why? Because we feel like we're not capable. [laughter] &gt;&gt; But I told you last night, if that spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwells in you, it'll also quicken your mortal body. So you don't have to be afraid. Jesus say, "Fear not, little flock. It is me. It is I." [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But then church, as we go through the scriptures and we look, there's a man named Moses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now we're going to transition to the sound. There's a man named Moses where God told him, "I've heard the cry of my people." Why do we worship? He said, "I've heard the cry of my people and I've come down, &gt;&gt; but I'm sending you." He said, "I want you to go to Pharaoh and I want you to tell him, "Let my people go so that they can go and serve me." &gt;&gt; So the only reason why you're free today &gt;&gt; is so you can be a worshiper. &gt;&gt; The only reason why God brought you the message of the hour is so you can get away from Egypt. Hallelujah. And become a worshshiper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] That was the only reason why he sent Moses. Hallelujah. To break the chains of the enemy that they can go and worship the true and living God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But then think about it, church. When God comes and he begins to show himself mighty and strong and he begins to do great things. Hallelujah. Think about it. If you can see it before it happens, &gt;&gt; that ought to get something out of you. &gt;&gt; But look, church, uh, I like talking about Miriam. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Miriam was in bondage. &gt;&gt; And in bondage, hallelujah. They created an instrument called a tambourine. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They did. &gt;&gt; It's in the Bible. &gt;&gt; I'm not making this up. Amen. &gt;&gt; That instrument was created in bondage. &gt;&gt; But then the Bible says, let's go to uh Exodus 15. &gt;&gt; Everybody all right. &gt;&gt; Exodus 15. I ain't going to be too much longer. I want you today to challenge your own revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Is it pure enough to get some worship out of you? &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Right now, if I was to do a survey, I was to do a survey and run through this church or just by a show of hands by asking this question. Is there anybody in here that God has failed? &gt;&gt; Raise your hand. If you raise your hand, I tell you, you a liar. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because there's one thing God can do, and that's he cannot fail. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And the other thing that God cannot do, God cannot tell a lie. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if he said it, it's got to happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's never been a challenge. Hallelujah. or anyone ever challenged God where God was defeated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, he's never failed any of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what reason do you have not to give him praise? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, there are things, personal things within us that hinders our worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's our culture. It's the sound and what we think of it in that moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we should be thinking of God only. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I like to draw out this scenario. Brother Paul, think about it. What if we all one by one come to the gates of heaven [snorts] and there's a mighty angel standing there and he says, "The only way you can get in here is if you worship." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some of us wouldn't know what to do &gt;&gt; because we've never done it on this side. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then some of us will be like, "Man, I I want to go to heaven. I don't know what to do, but I'm going to make something up cuz I I I [laughter] want to get in. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to say something to you and it may sound connor. If you're not a worshshiper, you need to go home and practice." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Go get in the mirror and start saying, "Lord, I thank you." &gt;&gt; Lord, you're worthy. &gt;&gt; Lord, you've been so good to me. &gt;&gt; Lord, when I couldn't see a way out, you made a way. &gt;&gt; When my back was against the wall &gt;&gt; and it looked like things were over, you made a way. You moved mountains. You caused walls to [screaming] fall. And I'm standing here today. only because you made a way. Hallelujah. [screaming] When you begin to talk about the goodness of God, I guarantee you, you will find a reason to give him praise. &gt;&gt; I guarantee it. Hallelujah. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; See, we don't spend enough time to think about how good God has been. But I guarantee you if you set a little time aside, &gt;&gt; you know what we do as &gt;&gt; husbands and wives when things are challenging, you know, you go to the counselor. I've seen this. I've never done it, but you go to a counselor and the counselor say, "Hey, you know, the wife is just disgusted in you, brother." Hallelujah. Husband's just disgusted in you, sister. And that counselor say, "Hey, how long y'all been married? We've been married such and such amount of years." She said, "This is what I want you to do. I want you to write down all his good and I want you to write down all his bad." And as she started looking at that bad, she starts to get even more and more disgusted because that list is very very very very very [screaming] very long. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But then when she starts to look at the good, &gt;&gt; even though that list might be shorter, it's more meaningful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's considerate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He loves God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He prays for me when I'm sick. Hallelujah. He stands on my side. He don't let anybody talk about me. Hallelujah. And when she starts to look at all those things, Hallelujah. She starts to realize why she fell in love with him. &gt;&gt; And all the bad things don't mean nothing. Hallelujah. Church, I'll be the first one to say, hallelujah, I've had battle after battle after battle and sometimes relentless battles. Hallelujah. But my God has showed up time after time, time after time, time after time, [screaming] time after time. Hallelujah. So my God outweighs the bad in my life. [applause] [cheering] When I think about the Lord, how he saved me, how he raised me, how he filled me with the Holy Ghost, it makes me want to shout. [cheering] &gt;&gt; How he picked me up, how he turned me around, how he placed [screaming] my feet on solid ground, it makes me want to shout. [cheering and applause] Hallelujah. [screaming] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of all the glory and all of my praise. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; I feel like giving God a praise break. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; I said, "I feel like giving God a praise break. He's been good to me. [cheering] He's worthy of all the praise." [applause] The Bible says, "Let [screaming] everything that has breath praise ye the Lord. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you think about his goodness, &gt;&gt; that should be a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with a sound. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. In my car where there's no piano or string instruments, God is good. When I'm on an airplane traveling, God is good. When my feet hit American soil, God is good. Hallelujah. When I finish eating my dinner at night, God is good. When I look at my family, when I'm thankful, hallelujah, [screaming] that everyone is alive and they healthy. Hallelujah. That's more than enough reason to give God praise. &gt;&gt; He woke me up &gt;&gt; in my right mind [screaming] &gt;&gt; with the blood running water through my veins. &gt;&gt; And you don't want me to give him praise. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You get mad all you want at my expression, &gt;&gt; but this is a revelation to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might not express it like me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that don't mean what I'm doing is wrong. &gt;&gt; It's what God means to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My God is mighty to say. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's mighty to save. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Savior, you can move the mountain. &gt;&gt; You're mighty to save. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, if we would just for a moment, &gt;&gt; think about how good God has been by revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And some of these things I'm saying, &gt;&gt; some of you can't relate. It's because you haven't fully surrendered to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you thought you was going to get out of here without that one, huh? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of you can't relate with the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And worshiping the way we worship, &gt;&gt; it's because you don't know him like we do. &gt;&gt; But he's more hallelujah &gt;&gt; than available today. &gt;&gt; And God wants to reveal himself to you more than you want him to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not a coincidence that you are here. God is trying to turn you into a worshshiper. &gt;&gt; Cuz you're probably worshiping the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But look, churches. &gt;&gt; Oh, my time is running out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Exodus 15. Look at this scene. Now, this is a church of people, a generation of people that have been in bondage for over 400 years. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And I ain't talking about no Hebrew Israelites. Hallelujah. I'm talking about the children of God, &gt;&gt; not some denomination people have made up to separate each other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm talking about those who know their God by revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A God that's not racist. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, God destroyed that in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When he when when he told this woman to say, "Woman, you worship, you know what you worship." First thing he did, he had to destroy racism in their conversation. &gt;&gt; First thing she could say, "Hey, you know me, me and you, me and you don't worship together. We don't get down like that." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's how she was talking to him. He said, "No, you know, the Samaritans and Jews, we don't get, we don't worship together. We don't get down. Black and white don't mix." &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Woman, you don't even know what you talking about." &gt;&gt; And then he started to talk to her. And the more he talked to her, the mystery of who she was started to come out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She thought that they had no connection. But as he began to speak, hallelujah, of himself, she started to realize that that word was inside of her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she started to talk about a prophet. Hallelujah. She started to call him Messiah and all these different things. Hallelujah. And the next thing you know, before it's all over, she's running down into the country saying, "Come see a man who's told me all things." What happened? God gave her a revelation. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But look, church, the revelation was already there. It just took her coming into his presence. &gt;&gt; Some of you are bride and don't even realize you're a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're just coming to church cuz it's Sunday. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; But this is the question. Think about this. This is the question for some of you Sunday people. This is the question. &gt;&gt; Who led you here? &gt;&gt; There's only two spirits. &gt;&gt; Who led you here? &gt;&gt; Who's in control of your steps? Who led you here? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I just can't I just can't see it. I just can't I just can't get into it." Let me say it like this. Keep coming &gt;&gt; because I know you're not going to admit &gt;&gt; I know you're not going to admit that the devil led you here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's only two spirits leading you this morning. &gt;&gt; And you mean to tell me, hallelujah, you're in an atmosphere of true true worship. Talking about the true and living God. talking about deliverance and healing and and power and joy and all the things that God are. And the devil say, "Hey, I want you to go to a church to hear how great God is today." &gt;&gt; He would never do that. &gt;&gt; The devil would never lead you into a place where you could be set free. &gt;&gt; So, the only reason why you're here is because God led you here. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Woo! &gt;&gt; Satan, [screaming] you lose again. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You lose again. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] I just got told that I'm bride. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I just got told that I'm a son or a daughter of [screaming] God. I might not look like it, but God led me here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, what we have to understand about God is &gt;&gt; God is intentional. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's perfect in all his ways. &gt;&gt; You know, I don't argue with the the the the the the LBG, the alphabet community. So many letters now you you got to keep soon it's going to be the whole alphabet. &gt;&gt; They just keep finding reasons to fight with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you know what? I don't argue with them. All I do is ask one question. I say, "You believe in God?" It's like, "Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes." Oh, shada. I believe in God. God loves me. Say, "You believe that he's all knowing?" Yes. He's God. He's God. He's all knowing. I say, "Do you?" This is the This is the sinker. I say, "Do you believe he makes mistakes?" They say, "He's God. How can he make a mistake?" I say, "Exactly. &gt;&gt; Why would he ever make the mistake of putting a woman in a man's body &gt;&gt; or a man in a woman's body?" &gt;&gt; Now, you said you believe in God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's omnipotent and all powerful and omnicient, knowing all things, and he doesn't make mistakes. So, why are you believing what you believe? &gt;&gt; You see how simple it is? But people live lives that they want to live. &gt;&gt; And they make excuses for doing right and wrong. &gt;&gt; God didn't create lesbians. Man did. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God didn't create homosexuals. Man did. God created a man and a woman. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly what he was doing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything on this earth you can find in Genesis. Hallelujah. And in the beginning, he made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. &gt;&gt; If you are confused about your gender, that's a demon talking to you. &gt;&gt; As long as I've been a man, I've never have to take a pill that my body forms into a man. &gt;&gt; I've never had to take a shot that my body forms into a man. So if you got to do something extra, that mean you're enhancing something that God didn't create. &gt;&gt; Brother Barry, this one is touchy. &gt;&gt; Some of you may got some family members or some of you may be challenging that in your mind. Hallelujah. And God is trying to set you free. &gt;&gt; Brother D, I think I think I'm a lesbian because my friends, they just always there for me. Is always a woman. She's always there for me. That's what friends are for. &gt;&gt; They're supposed to be there for you. You're not supposed to fall in love with them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's keep moving. &gt;&gt; The Bible says when a person is drawn away, they're drawn away by their own lust. &gt;&gt; And the reason why people can't be delivered from homosexuality and lesbianism is because they like it. That's right. &gt;&gt; They worship that thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God didn't create you that way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You've been given over to a strong delusion. &gt;&gt; And God, even right now in this moment, is trying to set somebody free. &gt;&gt; Stop listening to them lies. &gt;&gt; You are what [screaming] God made you. &gt;&gt; Not what you're trying to be. You are what God made you. [applause] And you look at the word. The word is the absolute. He said, "Be fruitful, multiply, have dominion." Two men can never be fruitful. Two women can never be fruitful and multiply. That shows you it's against the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm ducking from them stones. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just need to sit down and have a conversation with God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And ask the Lord, &gt;&gt; God, am I in your will? &gt;&gt; And if I'm not, show me the right way. &gt;&gt; I guarantee you, you give him a chance, he'll show you the right way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of us get caught up with the wrong people &gt;&gt; because we have a life we want to live. But you ought to ask God, God, am I living right for you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I worshiping the right thing? Hallelujah. Sometimes people fall into traps because they lonely. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Like we said last night, the comforter is his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You fall in love with God and in your lonely moments, he'll comfort you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, there's a sister in my church. She prayed 18 years for her husband. But when he came, boy, you talking about a king. &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; His middle name was even king. &gt;&gt; And she stayed faithful. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, if you stay faithful for God, your reward will be so great. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But look, church, I, you know, like I said, the enemy challenges me with my finances. But there's going to be a day, hallelujah, brother Barry, where I'm walking and stepping on streets of gold. &gt;&gt; Something that money came by, &gt;&gt; something that trials cannot even stand in the same category with. Hallelujah. Gates of pearls. [screaming] Oh my. Oh my. Listen. Oh my. Listen. Exodus 15. I ain't gonna be too much longer. The Bible says they sang Moses and the children of Israel. Verse one, this song unto the Lord and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he have triumphed gloriously. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at why they're singing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They're singing because he has triumphed gloriously. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why we're here. This is why we worship. This is why we come to church. This is why we live the way we live because he has triumph gloriously. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; And it says the horse and his rider have have have he thrown into the sea. The Lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation. He is my God and I will prepare him a habitation. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I want to be God's habitation. &gt;&gt; The Bible says God inhabited the praises of his people. &gt;&gt; If you are his habitation, that means you have become his resting place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a revelation. &gt;&gt; Wake up in the morning and say, "God, come and abide with me." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord, come sit on the throne of my heart. You are my habitation. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "My father's God and I will exalt him." Exalt means to put above everything else in your life. &gt;&gt; Oh my. The Lord is a man of war. The Lord is his name. Hallelujah. Church. You look at what happened. What caused this to be written? It was a time of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they've come out of Egypt. They didn't just come out quietly. They came out with signs and wonders following them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God turning water into wine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I told this testimony. There's a friend of mine. Hallelujah. A friend of mine who ran out of gas on the highway like 2 or 3:00 in the morning headed home after work. He ran out of gas. He popped his trunk. He had nothing. He didn't want to call his wife and wake up in the middle of the night. He had nothing. So he sat on the edge of his car. He's like, "What am I going to do?" He popped the trunk again. Like, man, he said all he had back there was a jug of water. He didn't even have a gas jug. So he put back on the side of the car and he said, "Man, a thought came. A scripture came. Jesus turned water into wine." &gt;&gt; And he was just foolish enough. Hallelujah. to say if my God turned water into wine, he can turn this very water into gas. He didn't pray, he didn't fast, he just obeyed the scripture. He took the top of the water, opened the gallon, open the gas tank, pulled the water in, and Joel, he jumped in, crunk it up, drove past the gas station. [applause] Some of [screaming] y'all need to drive past your unbelief. Drive past the devil. Drive past [screaming] the doubt. Drive past the sickness. Drive past the pain. &gt;&gt; Church, [screaming] we have a real living gospel today. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was that? That was a revelation. &gt;&gt; Church, he didn't even stop to fill up. He jumped in the car, pulled the gas in, and drove all the way home. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; And you take somebody like that. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And they may be in church jumping and shouting &gt;&gt; and you may criticize that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you don't know where they come from. &gt;&gt; And sometimes God will put somebody before you &gt;&gt; because he's trying to set you free. Look, what did God tell Cain? &gt;&gt; Cain was mad and God showed him what real worship was. &gt;&gt; He said, "Hey, if you do like your brother, &gt;&gt; you'll be accepted." &gt;&gt; But some of us think our brothers are fanatics. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But church, they worship. &gt;&gt; They didn't come out quietly. &gt;&gt; Amen. They came out with signs and wonders. And that same God is here today. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Miriam grabbed a tambourine &gt;&gt; and she started to worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And what I love about worship, sometimes all it takes is one person. &gt;&gt; All it takes is one person to get it started. Hallelujah. Because Hallelujah. I know I ain't the only one who feel that way. Hallelujah. And all it takes is one person and next thing you know, we got a whole line in church. Hallelujah. We got a whole group of people just worshiping the Lord, just giving them praise. Why? Because one person was free. Hallelujah. The prophet of God said, "Why did why did Miriam worship?" He said, "Because she looked behind her &gt;&gt; and she saw every problem, every sickness, every disease, every trial, every tribulation, every pain, every hurt, every wrong thing in her life being drowned in the sea." And that woman started to worship. [cheering] She started to give God praise. I'm asking you, what do you [screaming] see this morning? &gt;&gt; What do you see in your God? Is your God worthy of praise? [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; That's why she worshiped &gt;&gt; because she was no longer a [screaming] slave &gt;&gt; and everything that ever bothered her &gt;&gt; was destroyed &gt;&gt; by her God. &gt;&gt; And that same God is here this morning. &gt;&gt; Only if we would worship. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't wait for a prayer line only if you would worship. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, Joy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We about to close. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church. &gt;&gt; Worship. &gt;&gt; Has the power to cast out demons. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God put an evil spirit on Saul. Hallelujah. spirit of jealousy, &gt;&gt; spirit of envy. &gt;&gt; And every time he saw David, he threw a javelin at him. &gt;&gt; And David grabbed his harp, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; in the midst of his enemies &gt;&gt; and he let his gift operate. And he just started to serenate and started to play. And as he played, that demon lifted up off of Saul. &gt;&gt; I wonder, &gt;&gt; can your worship be strong enough to drive out demons? Glory. &gt;&gt; Your gift, your your worship testify of a life. Hallelujah. David, why did David dance? We sing a song, When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon me, I will dance like David dance. Why did David dance? Because David saw the ark of the covenant, which types out the presence and the word of God. David saw the ark on his way back home. Hallelujah. And he knew once that ark was restored, brother Mvin, they never lose a battle again. They never be defeated again. Once that ark was restored, that only be victory in his house. And David start to dance. David start to worship. Why? Because he knew victory was on the way. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, the ark wasn't even there yet. Just knowing it was coming. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Just knowing that God is on his way causes me to worship. Just knowing that God is a restorer. Hallelujah. Restoration is on his way. I'll give him praise. Just knowing that my God, hallelujah, is mindful of what I'm going through. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; David start to worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want you to realize &gt;&gt; whenever there's true worship, there'll always be some critics. &gt;&gt; Some people thinking that's just too much. &gt;&gt; That's just Brother Diggs. He's just [music] trying to excite the people. But would you rather have a atmosphere of a funeral? &gt;&gt; Would you rather have a dead atmosphere? &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "I'd rather have a wildfire than no fire at all." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, think about it. Hallelujah. David worshiping. Sometimes it's the people most close to you &gt;&gt; that'll try to All right. Now, it don't take that [music] much. Just All right, let's just quiet it down. That's not us. We don't do [music] that. &gt;&gt; And his wife, she looking at, oh, the king danced out his clothes. &gt;&gt; The poor king. But what I love about David, [music] David said, you think that was something. Jesus is a mighty God. He's a mighty Jehovah is a mighty God. He's a mighty God. David David just didn't care. David just start to worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, let's make it real clear. My worship is unto God. &gt;&gt; It's not for anybody in this room. It's for God's &gt;&gt; God himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But church, one day I was in Canada and I went to a concert. There was no preaching. There was just worship. You see how we do that? It was just worship. But who are we worshiping? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And my voice is about gone. But church, we started to sing the song. God he reigns from heaven above. Here some power [singing] love our God is in all [music] our God. Our God [music] awome God. [music] &gt;&gt; Let's slow it down. Let's bathe in it. Heaven [singing] [music] we just bathe in the anointing. Power in [music] love our God healing God. Our God [music] is in [singing] us. God here [music] from heaven love his name. All power and love [music] is enough. And as we sung that song, there was a sister who was in that worship service who couldn't walk. She was in there with a walker and this thing had wheels on it. It was so big it looked like a Volkswagen. in church. She came up front and she said, "Brother Diggs, I want to walk again." She said, "I believe, hallelujah, that God is able to make me walk again." &gt;&gt; Hey, church, I realize that the power is not in me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the power is in him. &gt;&gt; So, you know what I did? I grab the hands and I say, "Sing with me." Our God is an awome God. He reigns from heaven above. Why don't you lift your hands to the Lord? [music] Love our God. Let's sing this by revelation all together. Our God. Our God. Our God. [music] He reigns. [music] Heaven above [singing] [music] within. [music] Let's just think about what we're singing for a moment. Now, let's just put these words above what you're going through. If there's sickness in your body, I want you to put above that, "Our God is an awesome God." &gt;&gt; If you need direction, I want you to put these words above, hallelujah, that our God is an awesome God. If you need restoration or whatever it may be, let's put these words above that in the worship because God is an object of worship. And this sister with her hands in my hands as we sung the song, I pulled her up out of her seat and we began to sing it hand in hand. And I said, "Such as I have, Hallelujah, I give unto you in the name of Jesus Christ, walk." And I turn her hands loose, church. And she walked around a coliseum. Hallelujah. She walked around the right side. She walked around the left side. She came up the aisles and she said, "Brother D, the more I walk, the stronger my legs got." Hallelujah. [screaming] [music and applause] That's the power of a revelation of worship. [applause] He's an awesome God this morning. Don't walk out of here [screaming] wondering whether you're in the presence. &gt;&gt; You're in the presence. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; But ask yourself, is there another object in your life that means more than God? &gt;&gt; Because you're going to worship something. &gt;&gt; And just in a worship service where there was no preaching, there was deliverance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; The power of worship, it unlocks gifts. There was a time when there was a prophet standing in the midst of the people and he was angry. And then he said, "Bring me a minstrel." And as they brought him a minstrel and he started to [music] pray, he started to see he started to play. He started to see visions. What was it? It was the worship that unlocked that gift. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as you bring forth to God to worship, your gift should testify of a life. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the wise men saw his star, they said, "Where is he, the king of the Jews? We've saw his star and we've come to worship him." But they brought gifts that testify of what was about to happen. [music] They brought frankincense, gold, and myrr, which meant deity and service. Hallelujah. To die. Before there was ever even a death, burial, and resurrection, their worship told what was about to happen. &gt;&gt; What about us? What about us? Our worship, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; should speak those better things. &gt;&gt; Now, you keep in mind, it's not about the sound. It's about the revelation. &gt;&gt; It's not about your culture. It's not about where you come from. It's what you think of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let the enemy go through your mind and you pick out something that you a fight with just to walk out of here and not be a worshipper. &gt;&gt; Well, he said this and I don't agree with that. Pray about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] Let God be the deciding factor. &gt;&gt; That he led you here this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't the invitation of a man. It was the invitation of God himself. Awome God he reign all together with wind power and [music] feeling of Oh, [music] come on. Let's sing it to the Lord. Awesome. [music] Heaven with me. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Do you serve that God this morning? Sing it to him. Our God, our God [music] is [singing] an awome [music] God. Heaven. [music] [singing] Come on, church. We almost there. We almost there. Our God. Our [music] God. Come on. Break out of those chains. Break out of those chains of culture, those chains of religion, those [music] chains of bondage, and give God the worship that he deserves with wisdom and power [music] and love. The sure God is [music] he an awesome God this morning. Everybody say, "Our God, our God is [singing] an awesome &gt;&gt; God. [music] Heaven." [singing] [singing and music] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Come on. Receive it right now. Receive it. Our God. [music] Ask God right now to open your eyes to give you understanding of the revelation of who you're worshiping. The object is among us right now. We're in his presence right now. We're in the presence of God, the object of worship. And we say to him, "Our God, our God, he [music and singing] let the devil know. Let the devil know that you're a God with [music] me. [singing] [music] All together one more time everybody. Our God. [music] Close your eyes. Lift your hands to the King. [music] Why don't you just give him worship in your own way? You don't have to do what anybody else is doing, but give him what he deserves. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; and he deserves our worship. Let's do it by revelation. [music] [music] [music] [singing] Yeah. Heat. [music] [music] [music] He's [applause] an awesome God. He's an awesome God. [applause] He's an awesome God. [applause] Awesome. Is he [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Just hum with me [music] as brother Barry comes. Don't miss the opportunity [music] to be a worshshiper. Sometimes you got to fight against your own self. [music] Sometimes you got to fight against what you're used to doing and [music] break free and say, "Lord, this is the question we ought to ask this morning. Does God deserve my worship? Has he been good enough for you? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For you to give him back the life that he's given unto you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't be right in this service as our heads are bowed, our eyes are closed, let's be obedient to the spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because when we're not obedient to the spirit, we open ourselves up to an evil spirit. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to be a habitation for demons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we want God to have his way as we bow our heads &gt;&gt; right now in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's be obedient. Bow our heads in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Close our eyes. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't be right if we didn't offer salvation in the service. &gt;&gt; Amen. for you to become a real worshipper. &gt;&gt; Maybe you was invited by somebody this morning, but that somebody was Christ. Christ giving you an understanding that you're his child. &gt;&gt; Would you want to give your life to him this morning? &gt;&gt; Not to me, &gt;&gt; to him. &gt;&gt; Is there anybody want to give their life to Christ? Raise your hand. There are no eyes on you but Christ. &gt;&gt; God bless the [music] hands. &gt;&gt; God bless the hands. Raise them high. Let God see you. Don't be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Worship is not ashamed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look at all the children of God coming home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Receiving salvation this morning. [applause] &gt;&gt; We receive it by faith in the name of Jesus. [cheering] &gt;&gt; We receive it by faith right now. And from this moment, you'll get stronger and stronger &gt;&gt; as long as you let God lead [music] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's come to set us free. He's come to restore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let him restore. &gt;&gt; You may have gone wayward. [singing] You may have been trying to live your own life, but God is now showing you, hallelujah, the one you should be worshiping. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Keep your hands lifted to him. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you accept salvation [music] this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; If there's a restoring that you need, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God sees your hand. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; God sees your hand. Thank you &gt;&gt; for this moment. I want you to walk by faith &gt;&gt; and put it back in God's [music and singing] hands. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I receive you. Now you show me." &gt;&gt; Lord, I receive you as a savior. Now you show me your saving grace. &gt;&gt; Lord, I receive you as a healer. Now you show me what healing is. Lord, I will forever be a worshshiper. Just come closer &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In God's grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; It's the grace of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember the prostitute came through the back door &gt;&gt; and they said if he knew who was touching him, he wouldn't let that woman touch him. &gt;&gt; But realize if God didn't want to be touched, he couldn't be touched. &gt;&gt; But it's him allowing us to touch him this morning. &gt;&gt; It's his grace. He's allowing us to touch him. If he didn't want to be touched, there wouldn't be an average sphere where he could be touched. But God wants to be touched by you. He wants to be worshiped. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; God bless every Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Father, you see your children accepting salvation. &gt;&gt; Lord, it is just a surrender of heart &gt;&gt; to acknowledge the true and living God by faith. Lord, we've had plenty of ceremonial actions in church. &gt;&gt; We've had plenty of traditional things, &gt;&gt; but we want to receive you in the simplicity of who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just by simple faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we receive you this morning. &gt;&gt; And Lord, now we put our lives in your hands. &gt;&gt; Lord, for those who may have gone waver, those who may have backsliden, Lord, they've come home back today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, they've accepted you and they've become worshippers again. &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, we just ask, Father, that you would make yourself available &gt;&gt; to cultivate that life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, to bring it closer and closer to you, make it stronger and stronger. Hallelujah. Lord, that they won't come in and go out. Come in and go out, but Lord, they'll come in and stay in. &gt;&gt; That is the household of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, Lord. We love you and we thank you for the grace that you've given us. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; Lord. And we don't compare our worship to anyone else because it's by revelation. &gt;&gt; And Lord, only you know what's behind those hands that were raised. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, only you knows the struggle. Only you know how many times they felt defeated. But now, Lord, we put it all in your hands. &gt;&gt; Lord, that you will let the worship arise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, I give [singing] you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you [singing] alone. Every breath [music] that I take. Every moment [singing] I'm awake. &gt;&gt; Lord, [singing] have your way. Lord, I give. Lord, [music] I give you my heart. I give you my [singing] soul. I live [singing] for you alone. [music] Every breath [singing] that I take, every moment [music] away. Lord [singing] have your way. [music] Lord, I give Lord I give you my heart. [music] I give you my soul. I live [singing] for [music] you, Lord. Every breath that I take, every [music and singing] moment I have your way. Have your way. Lord [music and singing] I Lord I give Lord I give my [music and singing] heart. Come on sing it to the Lord. Sing it to the Lord. Give it away church. Give it away to God. [music] I live for you alone. Every breath [singing] that I take, [music] every moment I Lord [singing] have your way. Lord I give Lord I give you my [music] heart. I give [singing] you my soul. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Lord. [music] [singing] Hallelujah. Is that your desire today? &gt;&gt; Did you hear from the Lord Jesus Christ today? If you did, don't be back. [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; You know, brothers [music] and sisters, it was months ago that I said this and I'm just so thrilled to hear about it today. And some people might say this is all emotion, [music] but that's not what the prophet said. He said the Holy Ghost is without sensation, &gt;&gt; not emotion. &gt;&gt; You cannot contain yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the spirit of the Lord comes upon you, &gt;&gt; you know what we're doing here is changing our character &gt;&gt; for when we're over there. &gt;&gt; We're not going to magically change [music] our character over there. &gt;&gt; We're going to have a body change that's going to change us. And that scientifically can't [music] be explained, but our character is being changed right now by our own free will. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; That's the only way it changes by us surrendering to the Lord and allowing him. You know what we're doing here now is practicing for the greatest special of our lives which is going to be worshiping the King of Kings [music] and Lord of Lords in glory from a perfect body. &gt;&gt; But isn't it wonderful? He's given us the desire and ability here in this imperfection [music] to worship him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to wait till we get over there for the glory to roll. Oh my, we can do it now. &gt;&gt; I think it's so wonderful. [music] &gt;&gt; If you heard from the Lord today, just remember worship is not just in this building. &gt;&gt; Worship is every single breath in our lives. &gt;&gt; Every thought that fires in our mind is worship. Paul said to take every single thought, not most of them or some of them or just when you're at church, but every thought into captivity &gt;&gt; so we can control it. &gt;&gt; And make sure that the words that come out of our mouth match the meditation in our heart that it would be pleasing unto the Lord. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song? I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For your mercy, [music] it's never failed me. &gt;&gt; Amen.

[music] If you've got to go, by all means, God richly bless you on your way. We don't want to hold you captive here. This is an opportunity to practice worshiping. I know brother Cadre said sing at home in the mirror. But I want to say this. When you're in a crowd of believers, there's no better place. Brother Bradom said, "We ought to be as exuberant as everybody out there in the world. But there's no pressure. If you got to go, we have lives to live. Just go. [music] Don't don't feel pressured, but don't hinder this." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you hear them coming, brother? They're strong.

Oh, these are the days of Elijah [singing] declaring the word [music] of the Lord. And we [singing] heard the voice of the seven [music] angel [singing] righteousness being restored.

He abides. &gt;&gt; I do apologize. I just want to sing. I just want to shout. I just want to have a real jubile. I know what he's done for me. [music] &gt;&gt; It's just tremendous to be able to worship here. &gt;&gt; We'll [singing] sing two more songs and then we'll dismiss. [music] So, you don't have to be nervous. It's okay. But I just think, isn't it wonderful what he's done for us? &gt;&gt; Over 8 billion people in this world, and only a tiny little percentage can hear the voice of the vindicated prophet. [applause] We got every single reason to rejoice. My goodness, I'm rejoicing [music] night and day [singing] as I walk the pilgrim way for the hand of [singing] God in [music] all my life. I see the reason [singing and music] is that I'm just tell the devil [music] [singing] [music and singing] Heat. [music and singing] Heat.

[applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer as we close today. Gracious heavenly father. Lord, you are so wonderful. &gt;&gt; You're so magnificent, Lord Jesus. Lord, &gt;&gt; we don't even have words to express, Lord Jesus. Oh father, the desire to worship you is so strong in your children. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for coming by our way one more time. &gt;&gt; We invited you here today, Lord Jesus. And we thank you for coming. We know that you came, &gt;&gt; Father. We know that you spoke to us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that the words that were spoken today would find the mark in the hearts of your children, Lord. Father, I pray that we would be able to consider who and what we worship. I pray that we would, Lord, examine our lives today. [music] That we would leave this building, Father, and consider our ways. Oh, Father, that we would take an inventory in our lives and see what it is we worship and see how we worship and see if it compares with your word. See if it matches up with the revelation of the word for our day. And if it doesn't, Lord, help us to change our lives to match that word because that's the only thing that will change our [music] bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just bless each one, Father, who made the effort, Lord Jesus, to defy gravity today, Lord, and accept your word for them and their lives. Father, we pray that you would [music] just make yourself so real to them that Lord, they would be able to testify wherever they go, any time, day or night, because they know what you've done for them. [music] &gt;&gt; And Father, we pray that Lord, at the appointed time, that at each one of those people who raised their hands today to you that you would fill them so full of your Holy Spirit that there would just be room for nothing else in this world, Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, Father, we know that everything else will follow if we can get the right step right. And we know that that's the only step is to get your Holy Spirit in our lives. So, Father, we just ask humbly [music] that you would do that for each one of those hands that went up today. And Lord, if anybody else needs a top up of your spirit, we know that you're more than able. We just ask that you would do that today as well, Father. Lord, let us not leave this building the same way [music] that we came. Let us not leave this building worse than we came. Oh, Father, but help us to just [music] accept the full blessing that you've offered to us today, Lord. That challenge to examine who and what we worship. Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word. Thank you for the revelation, Lord, of worship. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that we would just go with the spring in our step, Lord. Father, we just ask Lord also that you would bless Brother Kadre. That you would just continue to use him for your glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you would just continue to watch over his family, Lord. Father, that they would all desire to worship you, oh Father, according to the revelation granted to them, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, we love our brother and we pray that you would just continue to use him for your glory in your kingdom. &gt;&gt; And Father, we pray that you would restore his strength. Grant him traveling mercies on his road back home again. Lord, Father, we love you today and we just ask all of these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music] Can we sing that song? I worship you, Almighty God. I worship [singing] you almighty [music] God. There is none [music] like you. I worship [music and singing] you.
