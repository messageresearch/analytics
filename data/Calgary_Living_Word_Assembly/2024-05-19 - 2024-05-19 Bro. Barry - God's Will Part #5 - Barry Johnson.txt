amen Lord bless you all yesterday we had men's meeting and I was just really blessed by it and as an encourager I have to encourage yesterday I was just thinking on all of the comments and things that were said and it was just impressed on my heart to take them and put them in a way that we could share it with the whole body because there's some great comments and great edifying of thoughts so there was 15 main points So it's 15 stands as long it's a little long but I I believe it'll be a blessing it's called the mantle of leadership in quiet strength and humble Grace a father's role molds not with loud declarations but in actions Brave and Bold conduct that speaks volumes a soft guiding light a Watchmen against the darkness correcting wrongs into right when a father kneels in prayer humbly seeking Grace children see a True servant's Heart a Meek and sacred Place their young eyes witness power and bowing low learning to serve in reverence their Spirits grow for by the life we live our children's eyes perceive the way to walk to talk and to love the truth we truly believe encouragement in families like rain to Thirsty ground always bring a harvest Rich where once no hope was found can our youth find safety in the body's sacred fold to voice their deepest fears and needs their stories to be told voicing them to their parents are our hearts open open wide if our families are built on Grace our children can easily confide in this Sanctuary reverence Reigns supreme but outside these walls our true selves are seen the good book reminds us to be in life and in spirit consistently free we guard against division let not Satan come between with open Harps we seek the know just what the other means before the darkness festers by Clarity of Love striving to understand as instructed from above in many roles we labor for the church with care connecting with each other in Fellowship we share one onone in meeting family to family true building bonds of unity in everything we do leadership knows no age it's found in heart and soul in the warmth of acceptance where we find ourselves made whole part of the body as brothers and sisters and friends a fellowship unbroken A Love That Never Ends Financial burdens Trials of life may weigh our spirit low yet in the upswing of our faith through trials we steadily grow our wives by their convictions they strive and they care the prophets Hands-On approach their burdens we should bear when Fellowship wanes reasons abound meeting face to face Common Ground may be found in the storms of Stormy Tides know where we stand to support one another with an outstretched hand creating environments where others long to be takes more than just a welcome but deep Sur sincerity sorry many here are immigrants fathers to sacrifice to work to provide routinely leadership's great price deacons guard the flock address their every need lead with love a word and seasoned backed by deed encouraging Direction a balanced measure in truth firmly based a message fitly spoken with wisdom and with Grace mental health a hidden woe must not be overlooked with understanding and kindness let's read this silent book approachable leaders balanced courageous and vulnerable creating a space where healing flows where all things are possible many a Time the revelation of overcoming Grace eludes the hearts of some who reckon life as singles race we testify of Victories of batt battles we have won encouraging one another till this Earthly fight be done in blessed heart leadership's call profound by faith and in love may our efforts be crowned with humility Grace and a soul that's sincere in every believer let let Christ's leadership appear or bless you all [Applause] amen what a what a what a treasure we have in our brother's gift it's just uh continues to amaze me it's just a remarkable gift to summarize everything that was said so wonderfully thank you brother Don and just a real just a an encouragement for

of God's great family what a what a what a wonderful testament to God's grace each one of us I really like that one statement one brother made that leadership doesn't have an age you could be 12 years old and be a leader 8 years old 20 years old may not be a leader of 63 like it's not not age bounds just wonderful to have those little nuggets that just can encourage that leadership is is is is is

announcements before we get into the word today we've got the Youth Event after service today um at brother Joel and sister crystals we've got the communion service coming up at 5:30 on the 26th brother Dela at delodon will be here June the the 2nd we've got a prayer meeting on the 6th of June at 7:30 p.m. uh we have brother marot Chua here June the 9th which is Sunday and we've got a worship

land on the 30th of June and we'll be taking it at our house we'll be hosting it at our place uh for brother Joel and Sister Crystal and then uh we have brother Jack Duff here on Wednesday July the 12th we're certainly excited to see the lineup of Brothers come through it seems that Calgary is becoming a a more and more popular place for uh brothers and sisters to travel through and we just want to try and be sensitive to the spirit of the the Lord and just see what the Lord will do through our brothers when they come are you happy this morning I just uh personally I I don't really want to try and be the person that's super spiritual but I just you know sometimes think about when we preach and when we talk about things of the Lord how the Devil comes around and some might say well brother Barry just you know you yelled on Wednesday but I think it's what I yelled that really caused a little bit of persecution in my body I really got it after Wednesday night and so I just couldn't help but think you know where where did we leave off on Wednesday I feel like we should just pick up right from there and and set the stage for for what we're doing because we're we're not preaching to the Lost we know that this ministry is to the total lost because the entire world isn't going to be able to receive the message of the hour but there is an elected class of people there is a very special class of people a prophetic people one with prophetic Insight that has the ability to hear what the spirit saith unto the church they have been given an ear not ears it's not plural it's a singular ear for one word and that's the word of God and I just want to read this uh out of the samonian church age you you I don't know if you want to bring it up you can if you want to um according to Romans 4:16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and all believers under that designation because he says Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on to not only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it I was reading this this morning and it just made me laugh still makes me laugh to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promise as having to do with election or the choosing of God is there any seed of Promise here this morning and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are the Royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated forn of God and were in the mind of God and His Thoughts this causes great dissension great problem in many people's lives because they will say if you speak about predestination then that means we're not free moral agents but that's not true we had a prophet in our day that said we are free moral agents God just simply knows what the outcome is going to be but we have to make the choice and you know what his children the Royal seed will always make the right choice always not just sometimes but always Amen in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season oh my anyone who has the ability to hear the word of a Vindicated Prophet it's not the prophet's word is the word of God through the prophet that's what brings this elected seed to life brothers and sisters it's not the ability to say God sent a prophet that I know I've been to Jeffersonville I've been at the foot of Spring Street I have seen the Ohio River where that ball of fire came down all of that doesn't mean a thing if you can't hear the voice as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body I'm so thankful that we can look and we can see expressed seed of God taking its place in the body where there's nothing that anybody can say there's nothing that anybody can do alls it is is a singularity towards the word of God it doesn't matter nothing's going to shake me to the right hand or the left it doesn't matter whatever you want to try and come up with with a new new new fandangled thing maybe believe the sign maybe this maybe that it doesn't matter I've already met the the the king of kings and Lord of lords that's what happens when we get the Holy Ghost we begin to realize that we are that seed being expressed in this age it's just beautiful and I just think the devil hates this and the reason he hates this is because this elected seed is actually predestinated to go on for eternity as a part of God himself because they were Eternal thoughts of God before the foundation of the world just like Satan and this is where I think he really got upset because Satan was actually a thought of God but not an eternal thought of God Satan was a thought just like Esau was a thought someone had to be destroyed that's that the law of election might stand and it's not up to us to say it's good or bad you know nature is neither good or bad nature just is some animals eat other animals and it's really sad everything has to live on life and you even hear brother brandham talk about I thought it was the funniest thing ever you hear people saying you got to save the animals and you got to save you know all of this stuff brother Bram talks about you know what some people eat potatoes and you're killing potatoes some people eat zucchinis and you have to kill that zucchini to eat it that zucchini has to Die the wheat has to die we know the seed has to go down into the ground and die but there is a germ inside that seed that can never die brothers and sisters it's so beautiful and that's what becomes expressed thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride when she hears that word of God spoken by a Vindicated Prophet not the prophet's word God's word through the Vindicated Prophet it brings a life inside of that person to come forth and it becomes that Express seed and though she is feminine of designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him and came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting what God in a many membered body not manifesting ourselves not manifesting our churches if that's what we're doing we've missed the point whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ isn't it beautiful what happened at Calvary it's terrible because he suffered but he suffered so that he could break the blood cell and actually go back up and sit at the right hand of the father and then redistribute his Spirit to the many membered body one Spirit one mind one Accord not many different directions not many different ideas and theories no paragraph 174 now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead body and we know that that's Colossians 2:9 that's not just something that the prophet said all of the fullness of the godhe head bodily was in Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was God manifest In the Flesh to be our kinsman redeemer and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so calleded I know there's some people out there that say one day we're going to be the sons of God right now we are the sons of God is what the word of God says Brethren now we are the sons of God though we don't know what we're going to look like but we know that when we see him we shall be like him and how are we going to recognize it because we're going to actually line up with his word amen that's how we're going to see him that's how we're going to recognize Jesus Christ we're going to see people that line up exactly with his word we did not become seed by the rebirth we didn't just one day stumble into the mission on the corner brother bradam said our parents didn't just lead us to Christ and suddenly we became born again the only way that we can be born again is if we were actually the elected of God before the foundation of the world and one day we just recognize that oh my we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn oh my it doesn't make us better than anyone in fact it makes us almost worse than everyone because we recognize there's nothing that we could ever do there's nothing that we ever have done there's nothing that we could ever muster up on our own to Merit the goodness of God in our life he simply chose us in him before the foundation of the world to come to the world to be expressed in the age in which we live and to give us all that we have need of and alls we have to do is acknowledge Him alls we've got to be I'm getting into the the next phase of our our study but all we've got to do is worship him that's the only thing he wants is the praise from our lips that's all he wants dad he just wants to hear thank you amen thank you from his son's daughters those ones that really are elected and predestinated will recognize it and they will thank him they won't say my culture says I can't do this and it's just the way I'm built no way no I don't buy it and neither does he but anyways we'll get into all that later I think it's so beautiful that was just for free brothers and sisters I just wanted to have a little warmup for my voice here today oh my like as I said I really kind of got it this week and uh you know maybe I deserved it for for saying the words that I did but I just want to preach this word I want to preach it in season I don't want to preach a word for another age because there's many other ages out there but we know brother bradam said a word for for Noah's age wouldn't save anybody today and even if Jesus came a and started to preach maybe Jeremiah's day it wouldn't work we have to preach the word in season and what we're looking for is a body change no that's what we're after and only those who are truly elected seed Sons and Daughters of God are those who will go in the Rapture who will actually see the body change there's going to be a lot of people who actually pretend to be Christians and you know what's going to happen is they're going to be worshiping Satan and not even realizing it brother Ram says millions and billions of impersonators of Christianity but we're not preaching to those people today we're preaching to the truly elect Sons and Daughters of God and so you know I I just want to get into our study today and uh if you could turn with me over to the Book of Daniel we'll get into the next uh portion the next phase remember excuse me we've been talking about the will of of God and understanding what the will of God is for us in our lives I have said that you know and and I believe it with all my heart we have thus sayeth the Lord the prophet said it the bride has thus sayith the Lord and the mind of Christ to know what to do with us sayeth the Lord and some people don't have it and they keep still and that's fine we don't want to say one way or the other the way we should go other than I I I personally believe the Bri has thus sayith the Lord we've been given the entire book open these aren't just stories and fairy tales that we talk about when we talk about sunset Mountain and we talk about the cloud picture we talk about the pillar of fire picture we talk about sabinal Canyon and the sword of the king being placed back in the hand of a prophet that's not just for a prophet brothers and sisters that's the Baton of the word that Adam lost being handed right back to man again he's given us a mind not our mind his mind the bride has the mind of Christ amen hallelujah she has thus saith the Lord and the mind of Christ to know what to do with us sayeth the Lord it's not about getting a Ferrari it's not about getting a yacht it's not about getting big bank account a a tremendous portfolio it's not about having better clothes or houses it's about getting ourselves in a Rapture and seeing our family go with us and sitting under the shade of a tree in the Millennium talking to our children's children's children that's what we're talking about the will of God brothers and sisters I would never want to say that we should just flippantly go forwards in our life and just make decisions without seeking the will of the Lord because his word is his will and it's a treacherous day in which we live and the devil wants us to make decisions outside of God's word because when we make decisions outside of God's word then we're not in his perfect will when we're not in his perfect will he's going to take us for a ride and we're going to go on a bumpy ride I was R this week I was I was trying to mow our lawn and I was rushing quickly riding a tractor and you know we have a bit of a hill at our house and I was going down the hill and there's really no breaks when you're going down and as I was going down it's bumpy and I just couldn't help but think you know man that's bumpy and you know sometimes in our lives we've got to go on a bumpy ride that's the way it is and there's nothing that we can do about it except for trust him trust the Lord but it's at that point we need to know exactly where we stand it's not at that point that we need to go and start flipping rocks in our lives and seeing what's going on where we went wrong we need to seek his will diligently brother and sisters I would never want to encourage anyone to just go willy-nilly out make sure that your decision is based upon his word and his voice in your heart make sure that those line up and if you're not sure maybe ask someone get someone to pray with you and see if God won't reveal it but seek the will of the Lord diligently but also be very courageous and March forward and you know brothers and sisters this is where I think it just it just can you can go from from just maybe being stuck in first gear and not being able to go any faster maybe in a spiritual walk if you can just get the Holy Ghost in your life then you have that Assurance you know you have him in your boat then you can March forward he won't allow you to actually make mistakes but we need to know that it's the Holy Ghost in our life and he's not going to share his glory with anyone it's not going to be us plus him him plus us it's only going to be him in our lives fully surrendered Sons and Daughters of God those are going to be the ones that have the Holy Ghost in their life that's going to give us the ability to be very courageous and March forward and that's sort of the the aspect or the direction that I'm taking this from is is matured Sons and Daughters of God where we can go forwards with courage where we can have the Assurance of knowing that he's going to lead us and guide us and if we're going to make a wrong decision he's going to correct our path he's not just going to let us go first because why because matured Sons and Daughters of God are going to seek ye first the kingdom of God they're not just going to say I'm going to go and run after this job because I don't have a job here so I'm going to run there to get a job and and when I get that job then I'm going to seek the kingdom of God no I'm going to seek the kingdom of God right now and trust that God is going to lead me and then if God leads me there praise the Lord I'm going to follow the lord and then all these things shall be added unto you but if we're looking for him to add all these things to us look out we're seeking our own will that's when we get into the permissive will of God and we're going to go on a bumpy ride but you know if we just lean not unto our own understanding just just not onto our own understanding and I love that scripture because it says lean lean lean when we're leaning brothers and sisters we're actually putting action into something aren't we we're putting our trust in something we're leaning on it we're putting our weight against it I'm trusting this Pulpit right now by leaning on it I'm lifting one foot I'm leaning on this Pulpit trusting that it's going to hold me up and not harm me imagine if we could do that with the Lord lean not unto our own understanding not unto our own understanding but lean unto his understanding lean not unto our own understanding and in all of our ways acknowledge Him and what happens then he will direct our path brothers and sisters but many times we don't acknowledge Him in all of our ways many times we start to just do things on our own and we know that James talks about it so that even when our prayer we ask a Miss because we consume it upon our lusts now it's not a necessarily A perversion don't get me wrong the lust that he's talking about are this flesh desires the pride of life oh my I'm somebody look what I've done we've done nothing he's done it all the only reason we have an ounce of success in our life is because he first gave it to us lean not unto our own understanding in all your ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path now remember brothers and sisters his will is his word this is where we're going today we're talking about his will this is what we want to get into his will is his word and we know that Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path so if we're putting his word first he's going to show us where we need to go brothers and sisters and you know it might only be one step at a time we might have a big staircase in front of us and we might only see that one step and we might not even be able to see that step but we got to be willing to step by faith knowing that he is directing us and if we don't know we got a problem you know all we need to do brother bradam said it just go back to where you got off cuz somewhere along the way matured Sons and Daughters of God have had a relationship with the Lord and the only thing we need to do is get right with God go back to where we got off and you know what he will Purge us he will cleanse us if we're willing to be completely honest with him he'll be completely honest with us but he'll Purge us of all the garbage in our life and what will happen happen he'll start filling us again but we have the ability to recognize that he has done it all and we don't need to be afraid we can be very strong and courageous just like the Book of Joshua every place the soul of your foot stands the soul of your foot treads in the promised land of the Holy Ghost is yours don't be afraid just March forward but if you don't have the Holy Ghost if you're afraid to go on then what you going to stay on this side Jordan even those tribes I feel led to get into that sometime too those two tribes that stayed on this side Jordan they still had to go and fight for their Brethren that was the only place the only way they could actually inherit that land they still had to stand shoulder toosh shoulder with their Brethren some people brothers and sisters don't want to go all the way across Jordan and that's fine but you know what we're brothers and sisters and we're still going to fight together so that everybody gets their possession and that's the way it works as Believers out of 1952 for him will I accept talking about God's will brother Bram says but God has to keep his promise in order to be God sorry brother did you get the I think I did email it I'm sorry I should have said it earlier yeah for him will I accept in 1952 but God has to keep his promise in order to be God if he doesn't keep his promise then he isn't God pretty simple isn't it if he doesn't keep his promise then he isn't God now I I I just want to say this brothers and sisters by saying if he doesn't keep his promise then he isn't God if he doesn't answer our prayer the way that we want our prayer answered doesn't mean that he's not God the promise is that we are the truly elected seed of God and that we will reign with him forever that we will be Eternal just as he is eternal that's the promise of God we can say many times we have prayers that we want him to answer a certain way a certain way a certain way even according to his word he's going to answer the prayer the way he wants to answer it and we have to be willing to accept that and we talked about that a while ago brother Bram has a quote and he says even when he doesn't answer the prayer the way that we expect it we love him just as much in in fact we love him more because we know it's for our good which is a very difficult thing to understand sometimes we can't even understand that we just have to trust there's things that we'll know by and by brothers and sisters if he doesn't keep his promise then he isn't God now the main thing is is to find out whether it's the will of God it's easy to go God said tomorrow come down here in this in this audience and stood here and we really knew that it was the son of God knew he was and said go not any of you all any of you all tomorrow it's going to rain all day long well be easy for me to go home and just go to bed and say I ain't going out tomorrow because it's going to rain all day see cuz if he said so it's going to rain don't you believe that what what you know God's will is then you can look in God's word here and find God's will for you don't you believe that that's where we have to recognize brothers and sisters that every scripture has a compound meaning and Revelation and that's what the prophet taught us God through the prophet and then the only thing that this other does is straighten the individual see this is for the entire church for everybody and then if you can appropriate the faith clean yourself up or accept Jesus Christ believe him it's bound to bring God's word to pass cuz it's a seed you know just looking at the will of God it's mentioned 22 times in Scripture that quote specifically the will of God excuse me one second I apologize it's kind of embarrassing to do but I have to it's been a good week I've had uh bit of a cold and I know the Lord's healed me the will of God is mentioned 22 times in scripture but it's only mentioned in the New Testament isn't that interesting I I want to say this it's only mentioned under the New Covenant the will of God how many want the will of God for their lives I'm hot this morning I'm not prideful bear with me that sounded terrible it's very warm up here it's probably just where I'm at you know in Romans chapter 8 and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God he maketh intercession for the Saints in 1 Thessalonians 5:18 and every thing give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you talking about our scripture that we haven't even gotten into yet we still have 45 plus or minus minutes here um I'd say we're doing pretty good for time Daniel chapter 1 a very very interesting story in the third year of the reign of jeim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it and the lord gave jeim of Judah into his hand with a part of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of shinar to the house of his God and he brought the vessels into a treasure House of his God and the King spake unto ashpenaz the master of his Unix that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and of the king's seed and of the princes children in whom was no blemish but well favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning and knowledge and understanding science and such as had the ability in them to stand in the king's Palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans talking about Daniel the story of Daniel this has come about through the discussion that I've had through studying a little bit about Joseph and how I Str struggled myself for years trying to understand what does it mean that the will of God is his word his word is his will it it really troubled me for a long time and I believe the Lord showed me that it's not necessarily a destination it's not necessarily an achievement it's not necessarily a position or a place the will of God is the actual journey and every decision that we make along the way is the will of God or not and two people in the Bible I believe the Lord showed me he said Joseph very clearly take a look at Joseph's life everywhere that he went he was blessed why was that because he put God first because it he sought the Lord first in every single thing in his life but Daniel um came up as the second name when I was having that conversation with the Lord I believe he was showing me if you've ever had a conversation with the Lord you understand when he speaks to your heart it becomes so clear you never forget it um brother Bram talks about sometimes we have dreams in our lives and they can be so vivid and we remember them we'll get into the quote a little bit later Lord willing but you know both of these men were dreamers and I'm not saying I'm a dreamer and I'm not saying that anybody is a dreamer I know some people have dreams and some people have really learned to lean upon the dreams as maybe a bit of a revelation from God but remember God through the prophet said that dreams are secondary dreams are always secondary the primary is the word of God the word of God and the Holy Ghost directing us to the word of God in in the Book of Daniel here you know if you were to go back and read some of the prophets Ezekiel and and uh Jeremiah some of the stories about about uh Jerusalem being besieged 4600 people were taken out of Jerusalem in bondage when Nebuchadnezzar came in when jeak King jeho Kim was the king of Judah and we know that this King jeho Kim he he kept saying I don't understand why God just talks to this man when he he he could speak to me why doesn't he speak to me I'm the king but he wasn't recognizing what his forefathers knew and that was that God speaks through a prophet and he doesn't change his ways he doesn't change his nature he doesn't change his Essence but we know that that's what theological study wants to have happen that's what the Antichrist Spirit wants to do is to get people to believe that he does change his ways and he does change his Essence and his nature but he does not so 4600 people were taken in bondage out of Jerusalem at that time in in three separate occasions but the word says that it was 4600 people and we know that this ashpenaz he was commanded to bring certain children of Israel I just think this is so beautiful of the king's Not seeds of the king's seed singular recog recognizing that there was a group there was a lineage of people that were different than all of the rest and of the princes those people who had no blemish they were well favored they were skillful in all wisdom cunning in knowledge and understanding science and had the ability to stand in the king's Palace brothers and sisters I just can't help but think those are all prophetic words about the Bride of Jesus Christ some people might say brother Barry now you're getting a little bit crazy but tell me which one of the ride isn't going to fit that description in the sight of God not looking at one another no blemish well favored skilled in all wisdom sometimes we have jobs and we're able to perform our jobs in ways that we don't even know there's problems that need to be solved and and people say how are we ever going to fix this problem and we say we don't know we don't know but we've got a God that we can pray to and he's a living God and we'll just pray and ask him how we can solve this problem I mean we could take a poll and say how many people have ever experienced that you don't have to but why not has anybody ever done that before in your life if you have raise your hand I can do it it was one of the first things that I did when I got saved it was a silly silly story we were dealing with a customer who had this one service item and it was this endless problem with a front door on their house it was never perfect it was a front door that was supplied by the Builder and it was painted once and there was a blemish replace the whole door don't even paint it just get a brand new door so we replace it get it painted there's another blemish take the door back replace the door and there's another blemish and four times and when I just got saved I was saddled with going to try and deal with this customer this homeowner so we had to pick up the door from the supplier take it to a house where they were painting another residence where they were painting we had to get the door painted let it cure put it back in the haul it over to this house and actually take the old door off and put the new door on and and make sure that it's installed without a blemish that's very difficult to do because they get scratched they get handled there's a lot of different things and it might sound trivial and simple and truly it is in the sight of God but you know what I did was I committed it to God I said Lord I don't even know how I can do this this customer is already on fire for this door how will I ever be able to make this problem go away I don't see it happening the only way it'll happen is because you allow Lord and what happened was I was able to do it and you know it wasn't me that did it it was God that allowed it to happen but for me it was a simple little example to see just trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding I don't know how I'm going to do it but you know we have people who are skillful in wisdom and that wisdom is trusting in the Lord not recognizing that we have something in our own I just couldn't help but throw that in there it's just such a a wonderful thing it's a mighty God he's a mighty God that we serve brothers and sisters our everpresent help in time of trouble and you know I just can't help but think this is an example of all of our brothers and sisters and kin folk in the church verse 5 in Daniel chapter 1 says the king appointed them a daily provision a daily provision and you know isn't that interesting how they would go from the Lord supplying all of their needs to now they've got this King and this King is supplying all of their provision I remember brother Ken preaching this the first time when I had ever heard it and I couldn't I couldn't understand it even a and and as time went on I just thought man that's so so rich here we had 4600 people carried bondage out of Israel into the land of the Chaldeans under the leadership of King Nebuchadnezzar right a and what happened they went from actually worshiping under the law of Moses understanding the clean Beast understanding the dirty Beast understanding the the good food the bad food living according to the law living as good as they possibly could now they're being forced to eat from the king's table who would not want to eat of the best meat in the land or drink the best wine in the land who who really wouldn't want to you know there was four people four people out of 4600 people is what the Bible says four people stood up and said you know what uh we're we're we're just not going to do it it was only one man that spoke on behalf of all four of them but let's just continue reading here and the King appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and of the wine which he drank so it would be the best in the land brothers and sisters so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king now among these were of the children of Judah I think it's beautiful isn't it the tribe of Judah Daniel haniah Michelle and Azariah unto whom the prince of the Unix gave names for he gave unto Daniel the name of belto shazar and to haniah of Shadrach and Mel of meach and Azariah of Abednego and isn't it interesting how all of that happens they did it for a purpose they renamed them for a purpose to let them know you're going to be reprogrammed you are no longer who you thought you were all the years of your life now you can just forget about there'll be a distant fairy tale memory just erase them out of your mind your tradition your culture your God your language your name everything about you is all new you are now a Chalan just amazing to think about how they had to do that but verse eight but Daniel purposed in his heart he didn't just speak did he he purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself he stood out he was willing to say I I I don't actually agree with that I I'm a Christian I I'm a Believer I I just can't go for what you're talking about here and and and I just can't defile myself with it and I'm not willing to do that I say Lord help me have that kind of courage to stand out because we know that his word says that if we will actually stand for him here oh my he's going to stand for us there but if we just don't stand for him here if we're afraid to do that then he's not going to stand for us there verse n this is just so beautiful this is where it gets into God's will is his word this is this is where it starts to get down to the rubber spinning on thead the the rubber spinning on the wrote here now God had brought Daniel into favor Daniel didn't bring himself into favor the brothers might have thought wow that Daniel sure got a skill to bring himself into favor with people no God brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the Unix I can only help but imagine that's because he had the life of Jesus Christ Living out through him now we know the Holy Ghost hadn't yet come but there were some people who believed and we know that he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and there was something in him that was constraining him to not defile himself with the pollutants of the land right but it was with tender love the prince of the Unix looked upon Daniel verse 10 says the prince of the unic said unto Daniel I fear my Lord the king who hath appointed your meat and your drink for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children with which are of your sort the other I don't know what the number would be left over of the 4600 then shall ye make me in danger my head to the king he knew where he stood and you know this King Nebuchadnezzar he didn't fool around did he if you if you disobeyed him if you crossed him that's it you're done goodbye we're not going to have a discussion there's not going to be a a big debate and and open a dialogue and see whether we can actually come to a an aable agreement you're going to listen to me the king or you're going to die that's all that's the way Nebuchadnezzar rolled so his his guard his Chamberlain he knew exactly where he stood he's nervous now this guy is saying I don't want you to do what the king said I want you to do what I said you can imagine the predicament that he was in he really did fear for his head then said Daniel to melzar who the prince of the Unix had said over Daniel haniah mishel and Azariah and isn't it beautiful the word word of God doesn't address them as Shadrach Meshach and Abednego the Chaldeans address them as that the word of God addresses them by their real names he says prove thy servants I beseech thee verse 12 10 days and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink then let our countenances be looked upon before thee and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat and as thou seest deal with thy servants just a beautiful testimony isn't it for him to even have the courage to speak those words what is it that caused him to do it somehow some way I I can only imagine the seed Gene of God inside of him was quick to the word of God and he just had a desire to say I'm willing to serve God and no man verse 14 so he consented to them in this matter and proved them 10 days but imagine brothers and sisters if he would have had a boastful attitude if Daniel would have had a prideful attitude if if Daniel would have actually lifted himself up and and started to maybe puff his shoulders out and say that I'm of the lineage of Judah and this is a filthy land if he would have maybe not even spoke a word but just his countenance just his actions that speak so much louder than words if that was his behavior what would the people have perceived him like would he have actually found favor and tender love with the prince of the Unix he must have had a different spirit in his life but he said prove th prove thy servants let's see what happened so verse 14 so he consented to them in this matter and proved them 10 days verse 15 at the end of the 10 days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat of the portion of the king's meat so I I just took a little time and looked this up I'm just going to throw it out there if anybody wants to you can look up what the Chalan diet was and and they like to eat all manner of Beast so it's interesting Beef Pork you know didn't matter they they like to eat it all so you could just imagine a nice marbling ribeye or or a Porter House steak a real big thick Tomahawk all that fatty goodness in that steak right they should have actually been putting on fat right drinking the wine maybe even a bit of gout in those boys right but you know maybe they were looking out for their brothers and their sisters so he consented to them in this matter and proved them 10 days verse 15 at the end of the 10 days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat of the portion of the king's meat they were actually not defying themselves they were following the will of the Lord no matter what the circumstance just like Joseph even though he was was in the bottom of the pit he didn't stop worshiping God even though he was a slave he didn't stop worshiping God thus I just think this is so good so good verse 16 thus melzar the prince of the Unix took away all of the portion of their meat all the other naughty brothers and sisters now they all got to eat pulse for misbehaving thus melzar took away the portion of their meat and wine that they should drink and gave them pulse and as for these four children God gave them knowledge and skill and all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding and all visions and dreams now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in then the prince of the Unix brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar you can only imagine brothers and sisters what this would be like to go in before the King Nebuchadnezzar there's a lot of Kings we can imagine jeak Kim wasn't nothing like this guy jeim was a he he he had a wishbone he never had a backbone that's what brother Ram would say I don't think he said that necessarily about him but he wasn't willing to stand for the word of God but at least this King Nebuchadnezzar stood for something he had he had he had a a constitution and he wasn't interested in anybody's opinion about it he did what he wanted to do as the king he led verse vers 19 and the king communed with them and among them all was found none like Daniel hananiah Michel and Azariah therefore stood they before the king I can only imagine it would have been a nerve-wracking thing for them but they had courage they knew they were willing to put God before everything and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them he found them 10 times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm and Daniel continued even until the first year of King Cyrus and we know that Nebuchadnezzar passed away and Cyrus took over um we won't get too far into that I just want to continue with the thought that his will is his word and as they kept his word in front of them and were not willing to compromise God continued to bless them and it didn't matter what the circumstance was we know the story all all too well but I think it's just a an absolutely wonderful thing you know brothers and sisters if they would have said even to the king's Chamberlain you know we don't like this position we we want to change maybe our garments we want to do something different they never said anything about their garments it was just the food that was the only thing that was defiling them and and they they said okay this is the one thing that we can't actually compromise on can we actually do something about this and and we know the king's Chamberlain he actually helped them with that but you know it just made me think about the Chamberlain and and what what importance it is for the Chamberlain we need to know what the king likes and the only way we're going to know what the king likes is to listen to his Chamberlain and we know in our day we've had a Chamberlain and that is the Prophet The Prophet has come and given us a word and that word is the word of God and as we take that word and begin to bathe oursel in that word we're always going to be in his will brothers and sisters there's times where we might Bounce Around the ship we might fall on our head you know we can be up and down and all around but we're still in the ship don't don't worry you're never going to fall out that's not the the prophecy for us in our day but you know just like Ruth she recognized for a little while months of time just listen to what the Chamberlain says because he's going to give you the provision that the king likes and we know that's what she did and we know that that's what these children of Israel did with one thing they just said I'm not going to actually compromise on this one thing you know we're talking about Daniel how he is h a good example of being in God's will no matter where he goes and no matter what he does and some might say you know he was born to actually be in that position I want to say this if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you too were born to be in that position to not be out of the will of God to be in the will of God brothers and sisters someone has to fulfill that portion of scripture you know we know Daniel was a a revealer of Secrets and uh I think it's just beautiful how Daniel had the ability to actually identify things we know carrying on in Chapter 2 for time sake I'm not going to uh oh we might as well we better chapter 2 verse one and in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams where with his Spirit was troubled and his sleep break from him then the king commanded to all call the M magicians and the astrologers and the sorcerers and the Chalan for to show the king his dreams so they came and stood before the king and the King said unto them I have dreamed a dream on my and my spirit was troubled to know the dream and it's interesting how this this story goes it's it's it's just the Lord isn't it how he orchestrates things how he allows things to come to pass to fulfill his word then spake the Chaldeans to the king in syak oh King live forever tell thy servants the dream and we will show the interpretation the king answered and said to the Chans the thing is gone for me if ye will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof ye shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dungill that King never messed around you can imagine he's like I've paid you probably for decades to be in my court and to tell me what I want to hear and now I want to know the interpretation of this dream and you're going to tell me it and if you're not going to then you're no good to me terrible to think though that you'll be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dungill but if you show the dream and the interpretation thereof ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof interesting how terrible one hand is and how dramatically wonderful the other hand is and all they had to do was show the dream and then give the interpretation of it this is God setting this up this is not by accident brothers and sisters that this just sort of happened they answered again and said let the king tell his servants the dream and we will show the interpretation of it the king answered and said I know of certainty that ye would gain the time because ye see the thing is gone from me but if ye will not make known un to me the dream there is but one decree for you for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and I shall know that you can show me the interpretation thereof just amazing because who can do that there's one and it ain't Daniel the Chaldeans answered before the king and said there is not a man upon the Earth that can show the Kings matter therefore there is no King no Lord no ruler that asked such things at any magician or astrologer or Chalan made me think about when I was reading this and I wonder if brother Bram talks about it somewhere maybe I heard somebody say it somewhere along the way that these must have been professional astrologers professional magicians and how they they they must have potentially gone from King to King and ruler to ruler and just had their bag of tricks that they took with them along the way and we know that people can learn to do little magic tricks along the way and likely that's what they were doing and maybe tapping into more but this is one thing that God would not allow to have used by The Magicians or the astrologers no man could tell the interpretation of a dream or tell the dream for that matter verse 11 and it's a rare thing that the king requireth and there is none other that can show it before the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh excuse me verse 12 for this cause the King was angry and Furious and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon that's it we're done get them out of here they're a waste of my time waste of my finances I've been paying them too long for nothing and the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to aroch the captain of the King's Guard which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon and he just answered with wisdom didn't he he answered and said arok the king's Captain why is the decree so Hasty from the King then arok made the thing known to Daniel then Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him a time that he would show the king the interpretation then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to haniah mishel and Azariah his companions that they would desire mercies of God of Heaven concerning this secret that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon I just can't help but think brothers and sisters there's times in our lives where we need to gather together with our brother brothers and our sisters hey and do exactly what Daniel did and and and desire the mercies of God of Heaven concerning the matter that comes up and you know that happens in the form of prayer meetings that happens in the form of of fellowships that happens in the form of church services that's the reason we gather together so that the god of Heaven would deal with us concerning things in our lives that we don't have the answers for verse 19 then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision what did Daniel want to do he didn't want to talk to the Chans he didn't want to go and read the horoscope he didn't want to go and look on Google what he wanted to do was seek the god of Heaven seek ye first the kingdom of God and then all of these things shall be added unto you then Daniel was the secret then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision then Daniel blessed the god of Heaven said Thank You Lord thank you Lord I knew that you would show me I know that you're a living God verse 20 Daniel answered and said blessed be the name of God forever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changeth the times and the seasons and removeth kings and sth up Kings and giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding giving it all back to God if we've got anything in our life it's because he gave it to us not because we did it we can go and say that we have a University degree but it's only because God gave us the ability to do it and maybe parents to pay for it or the ability to get a loan verse 22 he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth in him I thank thee and praise thee Oh thou God of my fathers who H has given me wisdom and might and H has made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou Hast made now made known unto us the king's matter isn't it interesting brothers and sisters I can only imagine that as he was speaking those words that he wasn't just saying oh Lord God now blessed be thy name I can imagine that he wasn't chanting like a monk in a monotone fashion over and over the same way on and on I can only imagine that he was worshiping these words to God because his life was required if he didn't come up with an answer and the lives of everyone else and I can only imagine that in his life he wasn't even so concerned about his life he was concerned about the 4500 other people whose lives came out of Israel with him everyone was depending on this even the soothsayers and the M magicians but here we have Daniel in his position knowing that there's no way that he would ever be able to do this on his own verse 24 therefore Daniel went in unto arok who whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon can you imagine the courage to walk in and be able to say he went in and said thus unto him destroy not the wise men of Babylon bring me in before the King and I will show unto the king the interpretation thereof my my my my then arok brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him I have found a man of the captives of Judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation and the King answered and said to Daniel whose name was Bel Bel shazar artart thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen and the interpretation thereof Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said the secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers The Magicians the soothsayers show The King but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets and maketh known to the King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days thy dream and the visions of thy Head Upon thy bed are these and we know that he gives the interpretation of it and and it's just amazing because it's the image the image that he creates and uh we'll get into that in a minute it just made me think about the story in 2 Kings verse 6 we know this story very well this is about Elisha and his servant and how the syrians were after them the syrians wanted to get this guy real bad and why did they want to get him because there was something about him that was able to discuss the secrets from his bed chamber the military plans that were happening in Syria were being leaked they were being leaked and the King was like how are we going to find who's who is for Israel in the land let's read it in 2 Kings verse 6 here I I'll just read it quickly for time sake and one of his servants said none my Lord oh King but Elisha the prophet that is in Israel tth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber and he said go and spy where he is that I may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he's in Dothan therefore sent he tether horses and chariots and great host and they came by night and come the city about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth Behold a host encompassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas Master how shall we do many times in our lives brothers and sisters we will be living in the will of God and we will be Discerning because that will is his word and the word is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword and many times we could have a conversation and be Discerning the heart of the person we're talking to and not even recognize it but the person who's being spoken to does because they know there's no way that person could understand what they're talking about how do they know it and that's why we need to make a decision if we ever hear it come across a Pulpit if we ever have it in a conversation now is somebody socializing and discussing my life they know my secret so they're talking about it is somebody leaking the the secrets that I talk about in my bed chamber to other people in the congregation or is it God that's where we have to make the decision brothers and sisters I want to tell you if God's speaking just say Amen to the word if there is a brother and a sister that's busy gossiping that's going to be on their head that's going to be on their shoulders to take we don't have to participate we know God hates gossip am he doesn't just dislike it he hates it in Hebrews 4 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword Pierce in even to the dividing aund of Soul and Spirit and to the joints and Marrow and is a discerner and the thoughts and the intents of the heart this is the spirit of God that will live out through real Believers it's not just for a prophet it's not just for a minister it's for children children can actually do this children can actually be the word made flesh in our day neither is there any creature that's not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do I just think it's so beautiful seeing that we have a a great high priest that's passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession let's not waver why brothers and sisters because it's later than we think you know um taking a look at just the idea of it being later than we think we know very well that in the end of the third chapter of Revelation the church goes up and that's what we're looking for just like John when he saw that door open in Heaven There was a a higher Revelation and he saw that door open and immediately he was in the spirit on the Lord's day that's exactly where we're at today but the prophetic utterance isn't something that we can actually just dismiss and uh I can see that we're not going to get all the way that I want to with this uh discussion in Daniel so we'll get into the image I think next week but you know that the bride when she goes up at the end of Revelations 3 she does not return again until Christ comes again and see Christ isn't coming he's going Christ is here now brother bradam declared it openly he said he's here and and Christ is either Christ or he's not Christ and he said he's here when he was here on Earth so now the bride's still here on Earth so where is Christ today the bride is going to go and meet with him in the air we're going to go and meet with him in the clouds we're not going to meet with him walking on the street here we're not going to see a 60-foot Jesus we're not going to see the banisters of Heaven open we're not going to see Planes Trains and Automobiles it's going to be this secret sudden going away of the Bride of Jesus Christ The Whole World's just going to carry on brother bradam said they'll keep on preaching they'll keep on baptizing people will keep coming in thinking they're getting saved and the Rapture will already be gone I say Lord help us get in line with your word and be ready but the church doesn't return to the Earth Christ doesn't come back to the Earth again until Revelations 19 with his bride and and the whole idea about predestination can cause confusion there's people that are predestinated to go in the Rapture and there's PR people that are predestinated not to it's that the law of el ction might stand we can't put anybody in but I I certainly hope that we're not trying to put anybody out we want to take as many people with us as we can but you know this whole idea of predestination it makes people think that there's no control over our lives but we have free moral agency and God's prophetic utterance will always come to pass brothers and sisters we don't have to worry it will always come to come to pass and uh I I just was thinking about this and this is maybe why I'm going this way is maybe just a a pause in the discussion about this but to recognize that Daniel he was a prophet and and he was able to bring interpretation of Dreams he was able to understand the secrets the dark things the Deep things God gave him some way of being able to do this and and it was a prophetic utterance that came through and we know that the the prophetic utterance will always come to pass there's no way that we can stop it and we know that Satan recognizes there's no way that he can stop it either and you know I had talked about this in the past how I heard this other minister say that you know when uh three and a half years happens when Satan actually sees the bride in glory and recognizes that she's come up now he's cast down he's got three and a half years to get his business done all that he ever has left over to do and how Wicked and terrible that time is going to be you know brothers and sisters greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in us than he that is is in this world right now there's coming a time though where the we don't want to be here we know Satan recognizes the prophetic utterance and that's why there's such a persecution against the church today even against this message of the hour but you know this prophetic utterance that we're talking about brothers and sisters it's God's Own voice and it started back in the Garden of Eden back in Genesis 3 and and we know that God when he was handing out the curses because of Disobedience because they step out of their will God's will Adam stepped out of it what happened was God gave the curses and verse 14 of Genesis chter 3 and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all the cattle above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put emnity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head but Thou shalt bruise his heel and we know this was a prophetic utterance and it wasn't through a prophet was it it started in the Garden of Eden and it was God's Own voice I just thought that was powerful thinking about it his own voice describing what's going to happen amen there is a seed of The Serpent and there is a seed of the woman and we know that he talked about the seed of the woman being Jesus Christ and the seed of the serpent being the Antichrist spirit that would be the devil come and actually bruise the heel of the Bride of her seed we know that was Jesus but Jesus what did he do he stomped on the head of that Serpent and we know that he killed him he dealt a death blow to Satan right there at Calvary and if that would have been the case if Satan would have been able to recognize that he never would have allowed it to happen he would have done everything that he could to actually stop that but we know God is God you're never going to outsmart God never even though Satan thought he could we know that it was it's an interesting point to make that it was after God formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth that he went from being just God created and God created and God created it was after God formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth breathed into his nostrils he became a living soul that he became Lord God an object of worship he was able to worship Him we know it goes on far farther and farther Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emanuel God With Us God prophesied I will give you an everlasting sign Isaiah 55 maybe just turn there with me as we close today I'll pick up from here next week Lord willing I know it's a real big deviation but I just felt it was important Isaiah 55 verse1 prophecy very applicable to the bride to everyone who believes in the Lord Isaiah 55:1 ho everyone that thirsteth Come Ye to the waters and he that hath no money Come Ye and buy and eat yay come buy wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness I just can't help but rejoice when I read these words because this is the Lord God speaking through the prophet he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the church when we read these words words he says incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with who with you even the sure mercies of David behold I have given him for a witness to the people a leader and Commander to the people behold Thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not and Nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God and and for the Holy One of Israel for he hath glorified thee seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not tither but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth and Bud that it might give seed to the swer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace and the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorn shall come up the fur tree instead of the Brier shall come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord for an Everlast for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off God bless you this morning I'll just ask the musicians to come as we close here brothers and sisters the reason that we're here is because God came in flesh to be our kinsman redeemer that's the reason we're here this morning being able to gather around this word he came to bruise the head of the serpent and it's so beautiful because it was with a deadly wound and what happened was that showed Satan that deadly wound is coming for him he heard this prophecy he knew this prophecy was coming from the Garden of Eden he knew this prophecy was coming and what did it do it bruised his head permanently and there's no recovering from it and he knows for sure that there is no Eternity for him he's not going to stop trying though he's going to keep fighting all the way to the very end but that bruise was a deadly wound and and it's one that can never be healed brothers and sisters so maybe stand with me as we close here just remember that it's nothing that we have done it's only so that we could see that there is an everlasting sign and I think it's just a wonderful thought that God provided a lamb for each and every one of us if we can receive it and as we go through our lives don't look at the circumstan aners brothers and sisters look to the Lord we know that Jonah when he was in the whale of the belly the belly of the whale that's how I feel I'm sorry he was in that whale's belly alls he could do was look around and see belly alls he could smell was belly all he could taste was belly but we know that what the word says he said was I will not count any of this to be good or real or valid I will count all of this to be lying vanities and what I'm going to do is the only thing that I know to do is to look toward that Temple that we've been instructed to look towards and if we're willing to look at that Temple then God will save us even though we know many times we've heard it said that he was a backslidden Christian what did Brother badam say he went and saved a whole city didn't he many times we don't understand our ways we don't understand the circumstances or the situations just put your trust in God brothers and sisters trust in the Lord with all of your heart lean not unto your own understanding and in all of your ways acknowledge Him and he'll direct your path God bless you this morning let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord many times I can't even understand why I feel led to go a certain way to preach a certain thing thing but I just trust you father that Lord we can just continually hold your word before all of our eyes Lord Jesus and that you will direct our path father as we lean upon you we know that that's an action it it takes effort on our part to lean on you to trust on you father but Lord if we lean on you and not our own understanding then we know that you will direct our path father we know that you're only obligated to one thing and that's your word and there's nothing greater for your bride than to remind her husband about her word there's nothing greater than a child to remind their mom or their dad about their word and father as your children as your bride father we're making ourselves ready by taking your word and putting it on and we know there's nothing that will take us out of here except for your word father so help us Lord Jesus to esteem your word greater than any one of our circumstances than any one of our situations in our lives father help us to esteem your word greater than any one of our thoughts Lord any reasoning that could come our way Lord we love you and we thank you we just want to commit each life into your hands as we go our separate ways today for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen can we sing greater is he that is in [Music] Me Greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in [Music] me is like a roing light [Applause] [Music] is he that is in me there is he that is in me than he that is in the world on the day of p a Lighty [Applause] rushing the and bapti all the with the power greater than I'm so glad I got it I know let is he that is in me is he that is in me is he that is in and he that is in the Hallelujah I just want to sing another song I would not be denied can we sing that song I'll need a little help but I really want to sing it and I just want to read this one quote here I really should have read it before I apologize we're going to sing brother Bram out of only believe he says I remember when I was healed of stomach trouble he Satan said why you better not eat said because the doctor said if you eat you'll die you had an altered stomach and said it was just one big bloody Al but the Lord said he healed me so I had to take somebody's word so I took God's word I just love the way the prophet says this and you know if you listen to uh on the wings of a snow white dove he talks about this at the end of the message but the Lord said he would heal me so I had to take somebody's word so I took God's word and oh it just burned me up it was just hot water running out of my mouth and and so two or 3 days I was going around holding my stomach like this and how are you feeling Mr brandom I said I oh I feel fine just tamping away like that someone said you lied I did not I was making a confession confess means say the same thing by his stripes I was healed amen so that's what it does see I was making a confession and so Satan said to me said you're bringing reproach how many has ever encountered Satan saying those words you've got circumstances situation in your life you're sick oh my brother brandham says yes indeed you are sick but greater is he that is in me I said now lookie here old fellow if you enjoy hearing me testify you stick around but if you don't you might as well get away cuz I'm going to testify anyhow so that's it you just got to let them know what side you're standing on and then make your stand and then stand and that's just the way we do always is to get to where we know that we're right where are you right in God's will get to where you're right and then you got faith in that you can't have faith unless you know you're right don't try to do that to Bluff him now he won't take your bluff see don't Bluff him but when you really believe it you're not bluffing then something has already witnessed to you and then you know you're right he says I don't care you might not no one ever lay hands on you you might not never hear anything but just as long as something has confirmed it in your heart that it's God's word and God's will for you that's all that's necessary and many times these GI GI and things they just encourage God bless you brothers and sisters I got to quit preaching I just think it's so wonderful I meant to read that quote can we start this song maybe
