[0:01] God bless you Saints
[0:04] um
[0:05] just when we're about to get ready for
[0:08] church this morning
[0:10] I was actually in the washroom when uh I
[0:13] was called on that my son Benny was just
[0:16] throwing up
[0:17] so
[0:19] he was fine last night
[0:22] but
[0:24] he woke up sick
[0:25] so I just looked at him
[0:29] and I just prayed I said Lord I know the
[0:32] devil wants our attention this morning
[0:34] but we are not giving him that attention
[0:36] and you know it's just strange that this
[0:39] morning brother Barry just said Jesus
[0:42] needs our attention so I rather give my
[0:45] attention to God than give it to the
[0:46] devil
[0:48] thank God
[0:52] [Music]
[1:05] there would be mountains
[1:08] I would have to climb and there would be
[1:15] battles I would have to fight but
[1:21] Victory or defeat it's up to me to
[1:28] decide
[1:30] how can I expect to win
[1:34] if I never tried
[1:38] [Music]
[1:39] [Applause]
[1:41] [Music]
[1:42] I just can't give
[1:46] now
[1:49] I've come too far from where I start
[1:54] from
[1:58] nobody told me
[2:01] the road would be easy and I don't
[2:06] believe
[2:07] brought me this far to leave me
[2:20] he never said there wouldn't be trials
[2:24] he never said I won't fall he never said
[2:30] that everything will go the way I wanted
[2:35] to go but when my back is against the
[2:40] wall and I feel a hope is gone I I just
[2:46] lift my head up to the sky and say help
[2:50] me to be strong
[2:54] [Music]
[2:57] I just just can't
[2:59] give up now
[3:03] I've come too far from where I started
[3:08] from
[3:12] nobody told me the road would be easy
[3:18] and I don't believe
[3:21] brought me this far to leave me
[3:26] oh Lord you didn't bring me
[3:30] out here to live me lonely even when I
[3:36] Can See Clearly
[3:38] I know
[3:39] [Music]
[3:44] that
[3:45] against
[3:49] [Music]
[4:01] [Music]
[4:10] leave me
[4:15] I just can't give up now
[4:22] I've come too far from where I start
[4:27] from
[4:30] nobody told me the road would be easy
[4:35] and I don't believe you've brought me
[4:39] this far to leave me no I don't believe
[4:46] you've brought me this far to leave me
[4:51] yes I don't believe you brought me this
[4:55] far to leave me
[5:02] thank you
[5:04] [Applause]
