want to W welcome the visitors in our gates amen um that they can said I didn't get to grab all the names but my childhood friend is here brother Elias A J from New York um want to welcome you and all the visitors let's just give them a hand amen well get into the scriptures right away let's open to the Book of Matthew chapter 7 I have two portions of scripture to read this morning Matthew 7:2 24-29 and then we'll go all the way back to the Book of Genesis Matthew 7 from verse 24 the Lord Jesus was speaking here therefore whosoever heareth the sayings of mine and dth them will I liken him I will liken him unto a wise men which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth the sayings of mine and dth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when Jesus had ended the sayings the people were were astonished at his Doctrine for he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes amen amen let's fle all the way back to the Book of Genesis chapter 24 I'll just take two verses from there and this is the story of the models servants alaza being sent by Abraham to go fetch a wife rising and I just want to read his prayer here and he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this day and sure kindness unto my master Abraham behold I stand Here by The Well of water and the daughters of the men of the City come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damel to whom I shall say let down thy pacher I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou has shown kindness unto my master am let's just have a word of prayer there father we are grateful for the opportunity and the desire to come to your house we want to hear from you amen we know you are here already you know the thoughts of our hearts you know the intents of our hearts you know the needs in our lives you know the needs down the road that we do not know we want you Lord Jesus to address each and every one of those needs we want you to be the one speaking this morning we want your your presence to be felt we want you to take control at the end of the service we want to look back and be careful to bring you the thanks and Praises because we would have been able to testify at that time Lord that Lord we've been in your presence amen we give you thanks and praise for in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may please have your seat as we know our pastor is traveling with both many of the class and family um let's just remember them in prayer that the Lord will be with them are you happy to be in church this morning I like the fact that our pastor always ask that and you happy to be in church and I know the last time we were speaking I talked about husbands asking their wives if they are happy so it's good to hear the pastor also ask the church all the time if they are happy so I want to continue the thought this morning that uh we took I can't believe it's almost a month ago it was on the 7th of July we talked about the definitive significance of the foundation and the subject was the foundation of marriage and just before I do a quick recap just realizing that some people here uh today were not here um last month when we did the part one of this um you know there's this scripture where brother Paul wrote to Timothy and it was saying that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reprove reprove means blame or disapproval for correction for instruction in righteousness and anytime we come to church that that is that is how the word is presented in one of those ways the word is presented to us and just point out that this morning God is bringing us certain instructions especially young people but I apply to some of us that are married as well but it's instructing Us in righteousness that's right amen righteousness means right standing with God that's right so when we are talking about these things God is coming to say if you want to be right with me that's right you have to follow this instructions amen and in other aspects of our lives there are instructions and everything like we said the last time if you buy a product if you buy an appliance there are instructions on how to set it up there are instructions on how to use it if you don't follow the instructions you're going to blow it up that's right so let us keep that in mind this morning we read the scripture you know where Jesus Christ was talking about describing someone that listens to his word and do it it versus someone that listens and does not do it and Jesus was saying when you listen to the word and do it you are like a man that built his house upon the rock I was trying to put that illustration there that would be a nice place to leave but you know that when a house is built upon the rock and The Rock itself standing you know we have rocks you know we have mountains here in in in Canada in Cal around Calgary that have been there for years and years and years compared to the sand you have by the shore that washes away very quickly so Jesus says if you listen to what I say and you go ahead to do it your house will not crash your house will stand so we talked about that we also kind of talked about a man in the scriptures named lot because we're trying to say why do we need to talk about those things why do we not need to talk about the foundation of marriage why do we need to talk about the things that our young ones need to know some of them might know they're too young to know those things but if they can keep it in their back pockets till the time uh comes when they need it but there's no age that is too young as long as they can comprehend to know certain instructions about the word of God and we said that lot lot remember lot was the nephew of Abraham he got to a time where the earthmen of lot and the earthmen of Abraham were having conflict and then Abraham in his wisdom went to lot and said you know what let's not have conflict we're brothers will you just go one way and I'll decide to go the other way so there was a separation we know it was in God's plan but the point I'm trying to make is when lot left the Bible said that he pitched his tent towards Sodom but when the destruction of Sodom and gomorra will happen lot was in Sodom now we realize that the Bible also told us that lot was a righteous man and the SCS and the things that were happening in Sodom they were vexing his righteous Soul that's right that's right so he was a righteous man but he had exposed his family to a place where they had been corrupted by the world that's right amen why did his wife turn to a pillar of salt Sodom was in our heart she was leading leaving Sodom but Sodom was not leaving her because Sodom was in her heart she couldn't stand the sight of the destruction she couldn't stand the thought of the fact that all the things that she has enjoyed in Sodom was been destroyed and she failed to follow the instruction of the angels that said keep going and don't look back so I might be a righteous father but if I'm not conscious of the world I'm living in amen my children could be influenced by the things of the world the daughters of lot committed what is called incest by having children from their father that's right ever wondered where they learned that from was from Sodom we also talked about the fact that there were four just for us to remember I'm looking at this side I could have asked the brothers but I Won't temporize Anyone this morning but we talked about four pillars four things to consider four I think I called them might have called them um criteria I can't remember but four main maturity levels was what I said that is required before we think about marriage and we talked about physical maturity emotional maturity which other one fincial material maturity and then we talk about spiritual maturity and I don't want to go into the details but what we try to show is that when God who is the author of marriage instituted marriage in the Garden of Eden those were the things that God ensured was in place ever before he took the woman out of the man so Adam um Adam was created a mature man he had physical maturity Adam was a son of God he had spiritual maturity but of of course he also had emotional maturity because he knew how to deal with his wife when he saw the first time he gave her a good name he said this is the bone of my bone and the Flesh of My Flesh and she she shall be identified who she was so we talked about all of that we give examples from Brother braham's stories you know that he told his experiences we gave you know scriptural reference as well why those things were important so after the service that day remember we had a lot of visitors um we also had um my wife's cousins and and their aunts that been here they're not in the message but right after you know he met me and one of one of uh my wife's cousins met me and said oh uncle that was that that was a wonderful service and I learned a lot and they said but I have a question how do you know the right person so I said well that's that is the part two of this message I know he's not here um but we want to talk this morning about making the choice brother Braham told us in choosing of a bride he said there is an unwritten law Among Us of choosing but Braham gave examples of the choices we'll make and one of the things brother Braham said said he talked about choosing the church he talks about you know the choices we make in life but when it came to certain choices brother the Braham said that it could determine your Eternal destination now brother Braham said I think it's the first quote here so Brothers if you can bring it up he said now it's a serious thing when we go to choosing a wife a man for the vows here is until death do we part let's also bring a reminder that brother brah says The Vow marries you we talked about that right that's how we should keep it and you take that vow before God that only death will separate you and I think we should a man in his right man in his right mind that's planning a future that he should choose that wife very careful be careful what you're doing and a woman choosing a husband or accepting the choice of a husband should be real careful what she's doing and especially in these days so if brother Braham was saying in 1965 that it was important in those days I wonder how important it is today a man should think and pray before he chooses a wife I had a preacher say people do it in the reverse right they choose then they pray and say God why and then they think but that's not how brother Braham said we should do it and I think today so many diverse cases now that we we lead the world in America in divorced cases we Le the rest of the world there's more divorces here than anywhere else this nation and supposed to be and thought of a Christian Nation what a reproach I divorce courts I think the reason of it is because that men has got away from God and women has got away from God and we find that if a man prayed and a woman prayed over the matter not just to look at a pretty set of eyes or big strong shoulders or such as that or some other wall Bly affection but would look first to God and say God is this your plan amen so this morning we are going to know what the plan of God is Amen brother Ram said don't look at a pretty set of eyes now men are moved by what they see women are moved by what they hear right we'll get a little bit into it but it is natural for a man to be moved by what he sees as you get to a certain age there will be a definition of beauty when it comes to a woman and let me also say that that is also defined by the trains that is in the world at that time that's right amen let me explain it a little bit more there was a time when it was trendy that the most beautiful woman the most you know I don't want to use the wrong word but most healthy looking women let me put it that way and then it got to another point where the skinny women were the most appealing because of how holywood presented it I'm making that point to let us know brothers that what you define as Beauty in the outward it's most a worldly definition of what beautiful is that's right amen but as brother Braham will tell us and as the wisest king that's right the wisest man that ever lived Solomon told us in Proverbs said beauty is deceitful it's vain right but a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised amen the quote brother Braham says but you know you have to plan look Pray when you're choosing for we see this by the Word of Promise she the bride that a man will choose is going to reflect his character it reflects what's in him that's true many times we complain about our wives in certain ways oh that's exactly who you are for the said you marry what you are but many times we don't see ourselves because we don't take time to look inwards let's now you know answer the question what is the plan of God now the first thing that the Braham says here inerting of God is that the quot we on yeah the next one and then he was talking about Ahab and then in his wedding is instead of marrying among his own people he went over and married a sinner and idolator worship of Idols he married Jezebel and she was not a Believer but BR now says that no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances should always marry Believers I know that is a very common quote but I want to twist it a little bit this morning because when we say that Believers should not marry unbelievers we think about people outside of the church church but brother BR also made us to know that there are three kinds of Believers Amen in the church amen the major problem we are having today in the message is not mostly message people going out like when I talk about problems I'm talking about marital problems is not just people going out to marry from outside of the message it's people that have grown up in the message getting married to themselves having not been converted that's right Amen to be Believers and then they put someone in trouble I've heard of cases where someone I was hearing the story that the brother was telling of someone that a brother that came to his church because he was interested in the sister the sister had had a terrible you know um experience in life where she had left the church she had gone to mess herself up and she had come back to repent and the church had forgiven her but she was you know someone that had gone through that experience would be very tender at it and this brother had come you know to the states and started to you know have interest in this sister and was going to visit and the pastor got to know that this brother was coming because of the sister so he called that brother's Pastor the church the brother was going to and had a ation and the brother said oh the best I know the Pastor said the best I know this is a good brother you know and stuff like that and he said okay that's good you know let him come and this brother came you know driving the best vehicle dressed right dressed nice and this Pastor said those things don't move me right you might be dressed but I want to see your character that's right amen long story short they found out that this brother was married to someone else outside of the country but only came to America or was only interested in this sister because he wanted to find a way to remain in America regularize his people become a citizen so he was looking for a citizen to get married to but had been married to someone else before in the message so when brother Braham said under no circumstance should a Believer marry an unbeliever that's right let us switch that inwards that's right amen because a lot of young people have the idea that oh once they in the message they are believers no no brother Braham said you are not you cannot join that body that's right you've got to be born into that body as you're going to see part of what to watch out for you've got to watch out for that person's character when it comes to his Christian character not just being a member of the church amen that's right now what was the reason and we know there are so many places in the scripture where you know of course God frowned at any intermingling that's right when it came to marriage and the first time you will see that was in the life of the sons of Jacob you know the sons of Jacob when Jacob and his family had moved to the land of Canaan they had a sister called Dina that's right now the Bible told us that Dina left the company of her family that's right went out to mingle with the daughters of the city that's right and then the son of the king saw her and defiled her that's right and then when the brothers found out and went to them where will you do this the Bible said that they had rought fully in Israel because they had done that which should not be done now this young man came and she came came and said my intention is to marry your sister but the brothers knew that this is an Abomination that's right we cannot be married to the uncircumcised and because of that what did these brothers do they plotted and ensure that they destroyed all the men in that City that's right amen now in the time of the Journey of the children of Israel as God started to Brothers if you can pull up numbers 27 it's a Sunday school class this morning amen hallelujah so if you're not jumping and saying amen it's okay as long as you're soaking it in amen you know brother Marvin is smiling because he's also a teacher and he knows that when we teach we want the class to be attentive when an evangelist comes around and brings down the fire we want to be on our feet so there was let's just look at this story here the Bible said then came the daughters of zel ofad just remember here that God was already telling Moses what the inheritance of the tribes will be when they get to the promised land right so they were they were getting their allocation we can call it their location of their inheritance the land where they're going to dwell in the promised land God has shown Moses the map and he was saying this tribe will be here that tribe will be here now then came the daughters of zelop the son of ephra the son of Gilead the son of Makai the son of manasse of the families of manasse the son of Joseph and these are the names of his daughters Mala Noah and hogler and milka and teaser teer and they stood before Moses and before leazar the priest and before the princes of all the congregation by the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation saying our father died in the wilderness and was not in the company of them that gather themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora but died in his own sin and had no Sons why should the name of her father be dwn away from among this family because he had no son remember inheritance at that time used to go to the sons not the daughters that's right so this man did not have have any sons you only had daughters so the daughters came to say you're giv inheritance you're giv inheritance out a father is going to get his own inheritance you know he should have gotten his own inheritance if he was alive but now he's dead and we being girls we are not going to get any inheritance they came to the prophet to ask the question verse 5 and Moses brought their Coss before the Lord so the prophet always goes back to God to clarify because that's where he's getting instructions from and the Lord spake unto Moses saying the daughters of zelophehad speak right Thou shalt surely give them a possession of inheritance among their father's Brethren and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass onto them so why was God doing this each of the tribes had their own inheritance and this is a study on his own but we're not going to get into it but you can tie all of this to the law of the kingsman Redeemer right God in his wisdom and I was saying this to the family we've been talking about the shadows and the reality all of the things we see in the Old Testament were not just stories they were Shadows of things to come that's right now the shadow gives you an idea of the reality the shadow doesn't get into the details if you see my sh Shadow you can tell that okay this is probably a man but you might not be able to tell if I was wearing a suit or the color of suit I was wearing you might be able to tell I was wearing a suit but you might not be able to tell the color you might might be able to see that I have a frame you know on that I'm wearing on my face so it could be glasses you might not be able to tell if it's sunglasses or reading glasses but when you see me you have a better idea of the Shadow that's right you see the reasing in the Shadow you're able to say oh that is why I saw oh this is what this meant okay yeah it's frames but actually oh it's not just frames it's actually a reading glasses so now that we are in the new we the reality when we go back to the Old Testament we can see more meaning in the Old Testament because the shadow has now become reality amen so this ladies came to Moses their father was dead inheritance was been handed over and they like the name of our father would you know not survive remember when we're growing up if you were the first to buy a land on the street you named the street after yourself you know you need to get permission but back in Nigeria you have people whose the street that they leave is their last name Bears the name of their last name um Bears yeah their last name as as the name of the street so the daughters were worried that if we don't get inheritance then the name of our father will be dead and they came to Moses and God said they are speaking the right thing give them that inheritance now let's flip over to numbers 36 what are we talking about why did he say we have to marry in the fold amen why should marriage not be intermingled why did God you know get really obset with Ahab for marrying Jezebel chapter 36 of numbers and the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead the son of ma the son of manace of the families of the sons of Joseph came near and spake before Moses and before the princes and chief fathers of the children of Israel and they said the Lord commanded my Lord to give the land for an inheritance by Lord to the children of Israel and my Lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of zelop Fahad our brother unto his daughters and if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe where unto they are received so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance so what's going on here God has said give the daughters now at that time when a woman marries into another family is still the same now she becomes a member of that family that's right so whatever possession she has is transferred to that family now if these women are just allowed to marry from any any tribe then the map that God gave Moses will be disrupted that's right amen because you are now going to have let's say the tribe of Dan is where they married from then the tribe of Dan is going to own part of the inheritance of the tribe of manasse that's right and that's not God's intention so this people brought a very important message to Moses it was a good concern verse four says and when the Jubilee of the children of Israel shall be then shall The Inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe where unto they are received so shall The Inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers and Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord saying the tribe of the sons of Joseph ha said well this is the thing which the Lord do command concerning the daughters of zad saying let them marry to whom they think best only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry amen we have an inheritance amen our inheritance is the holy spirit am that is why he says don't marry someone that is of another inheritance that's right because you're going to intermingle it so make sure you marry so that is the plan of God brother Braham said we must first do what we must plan the best way to plan is to plan the way God PL the way God has plan it is that a Believer should marry a Believer amen a Believer should not marry an unbeliever now let's look into the part that's got to do with looking brother Ram said you can look but what do you look for he said don't look for pretty set of eyes don't look for broad shoulders but what should you look for because we have to look for something right Brothers right single Brothers right the married ones are saying well I'm done [Laughter] looking Believers th this brother Braham was given an um was just kind of dramatizing what was happening to Mary the mother of Jesus all right here she was going down probably to get some water let's dramatize it just a minute so the little fellows can pick it up maybe she she's going down to get some water in an oriental type they packed it on their head big old pcture with wings out on the side here handles and I can see little Mary about 17 years old engaged to a man about 45 some year uh some children brother Bram told us that Joseph had been married before right and he lost his wife and then he got spoused to Mary we talked about that the last time here she come up along but she was righteous in her heart because Joseph was a just man before God but AB Braham said feel a lot better if women young ladies today picked something like that today instead of some little boy with a pack of cigarettes in his pocket so that not long ago there was a little girl back there at the Tabernacle my church brother is talking about the church God right that's right she's a sweet little old girl a little Christian girl she was running around with some old little boy who packed a flask in his pocket and smoked cigarettes I couldn't see nothing in the boy myself but Abraham did not just give up on the boy because of who he was he said tried for two or three years to get him to be a Christian but he wouldn't do it and I asked I said sis what do you see in that boy now let's let's let's answer let's see what she was looking what she was looking for or looking at but the r said you know what kind of answer she give me like some of this Bobby sock kids today she said brother Braham she said it's just got such a cute little feet and he smells so good so someone was making a decision on cute feet and perfume that's right brother Ram said I thought what a way to pick a husband the ram said I'd rather marry a man that was a Christian that i' fit like a box car and smelled like a pole cat if he was a Christian amen um no one wants to marry that type of person but brother R was making a point here you know we don't know what would happen down the road in life in 1998 we had a car accident we were coming from a wedding our family and when that accident happened you know it was it was a truck that kind of left their Lane went and hit a Volkswagen the Volkswagen was spinning hit our vehicle um we didn't really get hurt I just had a bit of cut so we were safe but the Volkswagen was right on the road and there was this couple that was coming with someone else in the vehicle um they were not using seat belt like the the woman sitting in front was not using seat Bel and she had told herand I think you need to slow down because I think there's a car crash um but he just said oh I'm just going to you know just bypass it a little bit long story short they it was too late and then he hit on the brakes and the vehicle some assaulted and this woman was thrown out of the vehicle so I remember my dad crossing the road to go help because my dad being um a medical person wanted to be there to you know maybe give first aid whatever before the ambulance or any help will come and as he crossed the road something just told him this is someone you know and mentioned the name of the woman to him but he didn't even think about it he just like the first response was Let's help this people it turned out that that was my mom's schoolmate and from that accident she had a spal cord injury and has been on wheelchair since 1988 now her husband if he had married her because of because when your wheelchair you had weights she became massive if he had married her because of her looks that would have been the end of the marriage but this man became the sweetest husband that she could ever have prayed for because there was something more that he looked for so that's the point brother Braham is saying making here said that's right if he's a Christian that's right by the blood of Christ we saved he will make a living for you and be a gentle man if he saved not by the outward appearance but by the heart God judges and his head is true read another quote before you get we get into the details of this brother the hand of the Lord came upon him was the title of the message 1954 he said as site goes back in the days of Israel when they were in the homelands of Palestine it was immediately after a great tragedy had happened Judah and Israel had broken up and had become two Nations as it was as it was and Ahab the king who got out of God's Will by marrying a woman that was not of the faith but AB Braham said do you know that's still a good thing young man to think about young woman marry someone who is a Christian don't marry unbelievers yoke yourself not up among unbelievers Paul said for us not to do that the scriptures all through forbid us to yoke yourself with unbelievers but if you are already yoked up with an unbeliever and he's and he is willing to live with you or she in peace don't leave them just remain and live a Christian life that you might win your companion to Christ and that's exactly what you know Paul said in the scriptures of the r said I preach what Paul preached but it's important to get it right the way we can get it right is when we follow the word of God so what do you look for sisters when you're looking for a man by the scripture the first thing you need to realize is and the question you should ask yourself can this man be my spiritual leader amen can this man lead me spiritually that's the first thing amen Genesis 1819 God was speaking about his friend Abraham and this is a time when God was contemplating ating revealing a secret to Abraham of what was going to happen the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah but here is what God Said for I know him amen that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he had spoken of him amen this is a man that will command his children the way of the Lord amen this is a man that can lead the family spiritually right and that is exactly you know what God was acknowledging here that Abraham is a man after my heart Abraham is the man that is household knows the Lord because of his relationship with the Lord amen amen and that comes down through generations that's right and when is the other way around it also comes down through generations that's right let's look at what Paul instructed the people in Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter 14 you love the Lord this morning amen you enjoying the Sunday School amen can I go faster I'll try not to go beyond the time I hope it stays at part two but if it goes beyond I hope we can tie it all together amen 1 Corinthians 14 34 and 35 now this is we like to quote 34 but I want to bring 35 here as something that tells you sisters the type of man you should look for said let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also seeth the Lord and if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church my emphasis is on if they will learn anything let them as their husbands at home and this is the way I understand it the husband is called to know as much as the preacher in the church amen H I don't know if that's went down well but let's let's let's look at this again they come to church they hear the preach preacher preach they go back home they have a question based on what the preacher has preached that's right and Paul says don't write a question first step ask your husband at home if the husband does not study the word the husband cannot answer that question I'm not saying all the brothers should have all the answers the questions but as much as they can when your wife has a question the first person she should go to is you as the husband and sisters when you're making the decision that's the type of person that you want to be your head amen and brothers those are the type of people they are going to be looking for so to marry daughter of God you've got to be that type of man how do you tell you know we talked about the three stages with brah said we said the dating is not part of what brah told us we explained what dating is we explained how it is of the world we explain the fact that dating is not intended to end in marriage it's just to enjoy the Privileges of marriage with no intentions for marriage but we talked about courtship and courtship is the time when a young man and a young lady are trying to know themselves that's right that's the time to actually ask yourself is he interested in having conversations about the word or does he like to talk sports all the time or talk video games all the time because if he going to be your spiritual leader when you get married to him he should love to talk about the word I'll even say throw some questions to him right when you're having that first conversation oh brother you heard what Pastor said today in church what do you think about this that's good yeah and see what he says he say I'm not sure but you can ask the pastor next Sunday then that's a red flag no because the problem is people believe that the person you're getting married to after married they will change they don't change they don't change there's no miracle that happens when you come to the Altar and you blessed there's no miracle that happens that person is going to remain the same person that you've you got engaged to does he consider the word when making decision you know there's something that we talked about um we just having the conversation uh with brother Elias you know it's amazing that you know for those of us that relocated when you're relocating when people of the world relocate they don't think about church they just relocate right they just go to a new place because maybe they get a better job whatever it is there but a Christian wants to ask the question is there a church there that's right that's an example of considering the word when making decisions the other thing to look out for is does this person have a sense of responsibility Paul was giv instruction to Pastor Timothy in 1 Timothy Chapter 5 I hope I can find it sometimes it's hard to know the sequence of this this little books yeah before so Paul wrote to you know pastors Timothy Timothy Titus but in 1 Timothy 58 it says but if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house yet the night the faith and is worse than an Infidel that's right it's a sense of responsibility those that come from Africa would probably relate to this but there are men that will not work that will prefer their wife to go work and bring the money and they will have the audacity to let me put it the way we say it to eat the money they don't re they don't like actually eat the money but what I'm saying is they will spend the money and sometimes even refuse to give the woman part of it that is an irresponsible man when God made Adam in like we said the last time in the garden God gave adam responsibility right God told him take care of this Garden God brought all the animals and said name them God gave him responsibility way before his wife came yes so he had a sense of responsibility amen he knew it's you know it's it's back to school time I know brothers are looking at their paycheck and like hey God help because it's your responsibility yes you look at your credit card say hey I'm going be Beyond where I usually want this to be but it's your responsibility the woman is there to help the Bible said he gave her an help meet for her right she's not the primarily person who is responsible so if you are moving around the brother and you are not sensing that level of responsibility you ask yourself what work does he do you can't really tell um what are his career plans you know you ask questions about 5 years down the line what's the plan well we're trusting God it's good to trust the Lord right but you have to have concrete plans you have to say this is what I want to do and I'll let me just be honest because we've got sisters here who who are based here and and uh are from Africa and I'm looking at my daughter as well I know she's she's still too young but but it could be someone back back from back home that is interested in you but you have to discern all they might want is Canadian citizenship and they will pretend as much as they can is it possible to get the right person that leaves abroad it is possible but how do you check whether that person is the right person for you you bring that person to the the the uh what do we call it the the standard of the word right you bring that person to the word and say what how does this person compare with the standard of the word so you have to be sure it's someone that's responsible someone who knows that when I have a home it is my responsibility to provide as ask yourself the question the church they are going what are they responsible for what are they doing in the house of the Lord is it someone that just shows up on Sunday before service is over they're gone that's not the person that you want to be your spiritual leader the last thing I'll say that the sisters should look out for is does this person have the potential to love and honor you love and honor honor starts from respect if he talks rash to you if he calls you names don't say you are in love it will change i' I'm I'm not saying this just out of you know trying to make things up I have seen sisters that have seen certain red flags during the time of courtship and they keep is saying it's going to change it's going to change but by the time they get into marriage it gets worse because in marriage the the deal is done the the vows have been taken the ceremony is over now everybody tries to be themselves you already have enough to deal with the fact that you are not raised in the same home you've come from different background there are personality clashes that is still enough even for those that married right that went by the foundation now imagine marrying someone that has plenty baggages that they coming with lack of character lack of understanding of their responsibility Ephesians we have 15 minutes more I'll get to the sisters very quickly 15 minutes more wow are we enjoying the Lord maybe the brothers can help me so that I don't flip Ephesians 5: 25-29 um I'll just read it from the screen here now this is Paul's instruction remember brother Braham always said that the reason why he talked about marriage this way is that our Earthly marriage has to exemplify Christ and the church right now and that that's exactly what Paul said husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot a wrinkle or any such thing but that he should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies this is this is way more more than not just being selfish right when we talk about being selfish they say okay you prefer yourself to that person but what he's saying here is the husband should love the wife well enough as he loves his own body if you get a hurt on your body you want to pay attention to it if you sleep and you know you sleep the wrong way you sleep on your neck you have a neck pain the next morning you want to do something about it so when your wife is in pain and you are not bothered about it then you don't love her as your body so those are part of the things to look out for love honor respect say for no man ever hateth his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church so he's giving us an example here of Christ taking care of the church and saying that that's how the husbands should be now I said the last time it's the families that are the smallest units of the society that's right the families are also the smallest unit of the churches that's right the church body you know I'm grateful I'm not a pastor but pastors go through a lot that we don't know when there are problems in marriages pastors are the ones that will be trying to solve the problem they are the ones that I've have heard pastors talk about bringing couples into the the pastor's office and the fact that if they can just not be selfish the problem will be solved but everyone is thinking about themselves and as long as everyone thinks about themselves thinks about how will benefit them and not the other person they won't be a solution to the problem so that man you must make sure he's a man that truly loves and horners you how do you know because at this time he's just telling you he loves you and when that time of courtship is happening and you go to their house if if he has sisters watch how he treats his sisters if their mom is there watch how he treats the mom that's the same way he's going to treat you that's just the way it works the time of courtship is the time to know this person before you make a decision the time of decision brother said once you make that now before God you are married but when hardship is happening you can say oh too many red flags I'm not doing this and go back to God and say Lord I know I prayed about this I felt it was your will but with this red flags I don't think I can go I'm going to put a pause to this is it possible that that person is still meant for you yes I know a story of someone who was praying to the Lord looking for a wife and then the Lord kind of mentioned to him this is the person and he knew that that sister had not testifying testified of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said Lord until I hear her testify that she has received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I will not go and ask her that I want to marry her and he waited a little while and as God does his own things because he sees the sincerity of our hearts that's is who had been praying for the Holy Ghost God answered her prayer and she came and testified that she has received the Holy Ghost and it was only after that that he went and said sister I am interested in you so those things are important now let's get to the sisters very quickly there's a lot to cover but I'll just make it very quick is he okay I go over five minutes okay thank you now brother told us that God gave the woman three sacred trusts it's a trust of virtue a trust of Womanhood and a trust of motherhood when he talked about virtue he was talking about what God has placed in her not to defile I know way mixed audience so I won't get into details because of the little ones but brother Braham said that God has committed that secr virtue to her and he said nothing else holds it but a woman now brother Braham told us that the union between a man and a woman is not the same as when animals come together to unite to bring their offsprings because they don't unite and become one because they were not one in the first place Eve was taken out of Adam it wasn't the same for the animals the animals God said that he made them male and female when he created them like when he spoke them into existence but when he made the man but said he first made a spirit man the masculine and The Feminine was in that Spirit man and then he formed the body for that spirit man it was only after that that he brought the woman out of the man and put a seal there so that it's only after the woman Maks the right man that that seal is meant to be broken that is the first sacred trust that was given to the woman brother Braham said if she does something wrong she must confess that to her husband before he takes her and make it right brother acknowledged that not everyone might have had the opportunity but when you come to the knowledge of the truth if you've done something wrong it is a requirement before married to let your husband know this is the type of Life I Lived before this is what has happened because brother Braham said again that he has the right to put her away if she doesn't confess it it is the quotes I have the quotes but we'll just flash it because we don't have enough time but if you want the quotes I can give them to you he said this in the message invisible Union right so it was not early days this was just about a month before the Lord took brother brah away so this this was this was way after the sales were revealed right so she has a secret Trust of virtue that's been given to her by the Lord God gave her that virtue so I'm in paragraph 87 thank you brother just as was as it was in the Garden of Eden she can say yes or no brother was saying the the Garden of Eden was talking about Eve and brother Braham said before Adam could get to his wife Satan got her and he said before Christ to get to the church Satan got her but he's having a bride in this last age that Satan cannot get to and that's why he called that a virgin bride remember that is what God's intention is we talked about this physical marriage being a type of Christ and the church and that's how God intends it then says she has a sacred Trust of Womanhood committed to her that she must not break the Womanhood I'm speaking of here is her conduct her character around men the woman is not made to be the very bold Burly type of person but AB Braham said that woman is made to be more timid the woman is made to be more he use some words he said but today we have women that are behaving like men the woman's body was designed in such a way that it requires her to be conscious of her body a woman is more conscious of how she sits than a man is it's a sacred trust that the Lord committed to her We R talk about all the movies T kissing and hugging and talking about the fact that the sex glands are in the lips said a man can kiss a woman if he kisses a woman on the lips he has potentially committed adultery with her and said he can kiss her on the hand it soon mix through their sex glance but the glance is in the lips and he talked about all the nonsense that's happening in holywood so God has given the woman the sacred Trust of Womanhood a conduct around me I don't have time but if you have some time you can go read um I think it's the message Revelation chapter 4 part one brother Braham said in a few places about the son of a ranch owner who had visited the ranch and the superintendent on the ranch had daughters but also had um a niece whose parents were late she was an orphan and talked about how this boy came you know to look for a wife and this boy in looking for a wife was looking for character that poor cousin was the one who you know was doing all the dishes was you know kept as the slave girl but she was the one that he saw that had the character that he was looking for and that had to do with the conduct around me just read it there's a lot to learn from it now the final one brother the Braham said is she's also given the sacred Trust of motherhood and the way I like to put it is the desire and the ability to nurture being a mother is not just giving birth to kids Rah said that but the desire and ability so Brothers when you're looking for a woman can this woman nurture your dreams into reality we have an example of the shunamite woman it was not the idea of her husband to provide shelter for the prophet of God it was that woman that saw that the prophet used to pass by their way and said you know what let's call him and give him some food and when she noticed that he was frequently coming said this man will need some shelter what am I trying to say some blessings that will come to your family will come because of the type of wife you married they had a child because of that the child died they had their child brought back to life because of that a woman that can nurture a woman brother Braham also said motherhood and honoring her husband a woman that knows that this is my head I must defer to him not a competitor but someone who defers to the head cuz that's how God intended it to be it's 12:00 this is a never ending subject but we'll leave it at that today I'll call the musicians let's be on our feet the love of the Lord this morning let's sing the song Lord You're beautiful your face is all I [Music] see Lord your be

said restore unto me the joy of my salvation [Music] the of [Music] my the musicians continue to play to play I just want to ask each and everyone to just take a moment and think about these things if you're married and there's a be of falling short in those requirements of God as asked for according to his word remember if it's your heart desire to be the right kind of man the right kind of woman then your cry can wake up the master he can fix it he can fix things me it can fix your marriage it can fix your bad relationship with your spouse and make you to be the right person and if you're married he knows the right person for you his intentions are good intentions said his thoughts concerning us are thoughts of good and not of evil I know it's scary sometimes to even think about this and just worried about getting it wrong but God instituted marriage and if we come by his word we are bound to get it right just let him know that you're surrendering to his will you will work with his plan you will look for the things he said you should look out for you will be in prayer Earnest prayer as you make this important choice or accept the choice of a man just take a moment speak to the Lord [Music] Jehoshaphat was a righteous man but in his association with aab his son got married to the daughter of [Music] aab the daughter of Jezebel and she was one of the most [Music] wicked
