Bibles tonight I'd just like to read from Revelations the first chapter certainly thankful for the body of Christ amen I just would like to say a special thank you to brother Henry and each one who was involved in in adjusting our lighting situation in here we had some requests before last year that there was a uh trouble with the lights shining down in people eyes and some people are sensitive to light and so we took a look at it and we were able to adjust them and it certainly feels different in here tonight and uh I trust it's okay we can certainly take a look at it in the future if we need to but uh we're certainly thankful for the different look here Revelations 1 verse one revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits Spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen amen let's just bow one more time gracious Lord Jesus we thank you for this word thank you Father that we can have Revelation by your spirit and Lord Jesus we know that you sent a prophet in this age to give us Direction on how we can get Revelation by the spirit Lord Jesus we pray that tonight you would just break this bread of life open to us fresh once again and we'll be careful to give you the praise and the glory forever amen just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name now amen bless you tonight you may be seated just a few announcements we have a happy New Year upon us I trust it's a happy New Year so far and that it remains a Happy New Year I just pray that this will be the happiest year of Our Lives as we have this revelation about the word for our day and the Revelation about who we are um God bless you and happy New Year um January we'll get back to our our regular scheduled programming we're going to have uh couple of prayer meetings this month on the 11th and the 25th we're going to have a youth meeting on the 21st I believe it is and we're going to have a communion service on the 28th which is the last Sunday of the month so I trust that works for everyone if you have any questions by all means refer to the calendar and uh or just Reach Out And Touch the Lord in our scripture tonight Revelations 1 to8 we know that this is the the revelation of Jesus Christ and and that's what the Book of Revelation is uh many times folks would say it's the The Book of Revelation meaning apocalypse it's the end of the world it's the seals it's the vials it's the trumpets it's the church ages it's what's going to happen happened to the world and how there's a new Heaven and a new Earth and it is but all of it brothers and sisters we know is the revelation of Jesus Christ and and that is what it takes for us to be able to get Revelation by the spirit you probably have heard me say it over and over again and and maybe you can just see why I'll just jump to it if you have the the book of the exposition of the seven Church ages with you um it's paragraph 116 of of uh of the revelation of Jesus Christ it's the very last paragraph of the revelation of Jesus Christ if you want to bring it up on the on the screen brother may God Begin by his Spirit if you can find that quote May God Begin by his spirit this would be I think um probably my prayer for this church for the coming year that this this paragraph would be what we actually do who we actually are what we actually encounter because if this doesn't happen then it's all for not we're a denomination we're just gathering together and uh you know there's probably better places better programs and better things that we could do with our time but let's just read this here may God Begin by his Spirit to give us continuous lifegiving and prevailing revelation amen oh if the church could only get a fresh Revelation and become by sorry and by it the Living Word manifested we would do the Greater Works and glorify God our Father in heaven and I wrote a note two words at the end of this in us his desire is for this to happen happen Amen in a bride body brothers and sisters this is not something that's out there in the future don't think of it sometime somewhere somehow it's going to happen to some people maybe in some church this church now today he wants us to have fresh Revelation and it only comes by his spirit and you know what happens when it comes by his Spirit we don't just talk it we live it and once in a while we have a little bit of Fellowship ship about it we can talk about it and we can say Amen to it because it's a fresh Revelation and and we get inspired and we get encouraged by it but we don't have to go and preach it and preach it and preach it all we have to do is live it and by living it people around us become attracted to whatever that life is and and and we have the ability to say you know there's a reason for the Salvation that we have inside of us and that reason is we have a re Revelation about who we are we recognize that we truly are seated in Heavenly places we are Kings and Priests unto God and his father by the Revelation that we've been given amen I just want to pick up we're going to continue to go on with the uh the book here and and I apologize it feels like a lot but I think it's so important that we just need to do it and so we're just going to continue on with it keep plowing forwards and just see if we can't get through this book sometime and uh so where we left off last time was like paragraph 77 of the revelation of Jesus Christ and it says in here see Paul by the Holy Ghost said exactly what Peter said by the Holy Ghost and what was said cannot be changed it has to be the same from Pentecost until the very last elected one has been baptized I personally think that is so incredible it's so good because it just means that nobody's going to be speaking differently we know that Paul said that if an angel from heaven came and spoke any other thing unto you than that which we already have preached and let him be a cursed and he went on to say let me say that again in case you didn't get it if you hear anything different then let them be a cursed whoever would say those words we know that John said don't don't add to it or take one word from it because if you do then the curses in This Book of Revelation they will be upon you so we need to be very cautious about how we actually take and exercise this word but I just think it's beautiful by the Holy Ghost they both preach the same thing and by the Holy Ghost we all will preach the same thing it won't be a different word it can't be a different word if it is a different word that's either lived or spoke then it's a spirit but is it the Holy Spirit we know the next uh part here is Galatians 1:8 it says but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be ACC cursed for Bram in paragraph 78 he goes on to say now some of you Oneness people baptize wrong you baptize for regeneration as though being immersed in water saved you regeneration does not come by water it is a work of the spirit the man who by the Holy Ghost gave the command repent to be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus did not say that water regenerated he said it was only an Evidence of a good conscience toward God that was all 1 Peter 321 like the figure where unto even baptism doth also now save us not putting away the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward God by resurrection of Jesus Christ so brothers and sisters when we get that desire to get baptized where's the resurrection of Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago somewhere else nope right here right here it's got to be on the inside brother randam says I believe it if anyone has any false ideas that history can prove water baptism in any other way than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I would advise you to read the histories and find out for yourself the following is a true record of baptism which took place in Rome ad. 100 and was reproduced in Time Magazine December 5th 1955 the Deacon raised his hand and pablus Deus stepped through the baptistry door standing waste steep in the pool was Marcus Vasa the wood seller he was smiling as pablus waited into the pool beside him cedus he asked cedo responded pus I believe that my salvation comes from Jesus the Christ who was crucified under Pontius Pilate with him I died that with him I may have eternal life then he felt strong arms supporting him as he let himself fall backward into the pool and heard Marcus's voice in his ear I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus as the cold water closed over him right up until the truth was lost and did not return until this last age this is from NAA till the turn of this Century they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but it has come back Hallelujah Satan can't keep the Revelation down when the spirit wants to give it amen isn't that beautiful brothers and sisters he can try all he wants he can get people to make a fuss he can work through whatever Avenue that he can get but he can't stop the Revelation when the spirit wants to give it amen I think it's absolutely beautiful I'm just going to say it again because I know he's listening as well Satan you can't keep the Revelation down when the spirit wants to give it and I just believe it with all my heart brothers and sisters the spirit wants to give us Revelation today more than ever amen otherwise why on Earth are we here what's our purpose is it's not just to be good church people to be message folks to say that we can go to a message church and raise our children in and around the message it's so that we can be the Disciples of Jesus Christ so that we can actually cast out Devils that we can lay our hands on the sick and what will happen they shall recover we could drink any deadly thing and it shall not harm us Mark 16 in action is that church that he wants to reveal himself to and through and all else is false paragraph 83 he says yes if there were three Gods you might very well baptize for a father and a son and a holy ghost but the Revelation given to John was that there is one God and his name is Lord Jesus Christ amen and you baptize for one God and one only one sorry that's why Peter baptized the way he did at Pentecost he had to be true to the Revelation which was let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made the same Jesus whom ye hath Cru crucified both Lord and Christ there he is the Lord Jesus Christ if you recall we talked about it before Christmas and and even the New Year here that the disciples were not deceived the disciples had no deception in them they knew who Jesus was and they knew what his name was am they didn't try and give him another label they knew exactly who he was so when they heard his name they spoke it when they knew they needed to baptize in the name of the Father the name of the son the name of the Holy Ghost they knew it was their friend amen because remember he took them and said to them Brethren I no longer call you servants I call you friends you're no longer going to be not knowing what's going on I'm going to tell you the secrets I'm going to take and give Revelation by the spirit to you 84 if Jesus is both Lord and Christ then he Jesus is and cannot be else but Father Son and Holy Ghost in one person manifest In the Flesh it is not God in three persons Blessed Trinity but one God one person with three major titles with three offices manifesting those titles hear it once more this same Jesus is both Lord and Christ Lord father and Christ Holy Spirit are Jesus for he Jesus is both of both of them Lord in Christ amen if that doesn't show us the true revelation of the godhead nothing will Lord is not another one Christ is not another one this Jesus is the Lord Jesus Christ one God Amen Philip one day said to Jesus Lord show us the father and it will suffice us did you ever step back and think about that scripture how God manifest in flesh must have marveled as he looked at him you've seen so much going on and we know that God isn't surprised but we know that he he must have looked at him and thought my goodness how can we how can I express to get through to human beings how can we actually condescend so far so that you will be able to comprehend that the father is in me I I've thought about that maybe it's a bit weird but it's true we know that God's not surprised I know that but just to think about it paragraph 85 that doesn't show us the true revelation of the God had nothing will Lord is is not another one Christ is not another one this Jesus is the Lord Jesus Christ one God Philip one day said to Jesus Lord show us the father and it will suffice us Jesus said unto him have I been so long with you and you don't know me he that has seen me has seen the father so why do you say show us the father I and my father are one I think it's so beautiful we've heard brother Gilbert Minister on this I am and my father are one and you know brothers and sisters when that happens the world isn't going to have to say are you one with your father because the way you live your life is going to demonstrate that your father and you are one and the same thing with the children when the children obey their father they can say those very words I and my father are one because my father says do this and I go and do that I'm actually becoming one with the father but my goodness when a child in front of the father says hey okay Daddy I'll do whatever you want don't you worry and as soon as the father turns his back and they're alone doing their own thing they just go and do whatever they want are they truly one with their father no I think it's beautiful amen amen I and my father are one that's really who we are today brothers and sisters there's no question about that when we have this word in us when we truly get the Revelation by the spirit about getting the holy ghost in our lives when we truly get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives then we truly begin to manifest what life whose life are we going to manifest it's not going to be some traditional thinking it's not going to be what I want to do it's not going to be about serving me it's going to be about serving others because we know eternal life is serving for other living for others it's not about me and my desires and my wishes that's right I and my father are one I love that I want tow on that for a while brother Bram goes on though and he says I quoted that once and a lady said just a minute Mr Branham you and your wife or one I said not that kind she said I beg your pardon so I said to her do you see me she said yes I said do you see my wife she said no I said then that Oneness is a different kind for he said when you see me you see the father that's powerful brothers and sisters amen when you see me you see the Father the prophet said that it would be light at the evening time in the hymn it's written it'll be light in the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find in the Waterway that's the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus young and old repent of all your sin the Holy Ghost will surely enter in the evening light has come it is a fact that God and Christ are one such a beautiful song he goes on to say not too long ago I was talking to a Jewish rabbi he said to me you Gentiles can't cut God in three pieces and give him to a Jew we know better than that I said to him that's just it Rabbi we don't cut God in three pieces you believe the prophets don't you he said certainly I do do you believe Isaiah 9:6 yes who is the prophet speaking of Messiah yeah let's just pause there for a second and and just turn there let's go to Isaiah Isaiah 9:6 and just make it fresh so we understand who he's talking about I said to him that's just it Rabbi we don't cut God in three pieces you believe the prophets don't you he said certainly I do he asked him do you believe Isaiah 9:6 yes who was the prophet speaking of he says Messiah let's read it it says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and I was reading this studying this and I was just thinking isn't it interesting how that's been taken and just made a Christmas story it's just been dovetailed with Christmas and that's kind of where it's compartmentalized and many times that's really the only time you hear it spoken of but here we have a prophet a dispensational prophet a major prophet bringing this to the surface to say listen there's something to this do you believe Isaiah 96 yes who was the prophet speaking of Messiah I said what Rel relation will Messiah be to God he said he will be God I said that's right amen you can't put God in three persons or three parts you can't tell a Jew that there's a father a son a holy ghost he'll tell you right quick where that idea came from the Jews know this Creed was established at the Nan Council no wonder they scorn us as Heathen we talk about a God that does not change the Jews believe that too but the church changed its unchanging God from one to three I just think it's amazing brothers and sisters how tricky the devil is isn't it because he's taking the scripture and using the scripture but just twisting the scripture because they're believing in Jesus they're believing in the Holy Ghost they're believing in God but they're taking and making it something that it's not and by doing that they're making it of none effect having a form of godliness but because it's only a form of godliness they they by virtue deny the power thereof and that to me brothers and sisters is what I want to encourage us to receive is that true power that true baptism of the Holy Ghost don't stop at church don't stop at quoting quotes don't stop at just reading messages or just listening to messages get into Christ because if you don't get into Christ as we heard about last Wednesday as we heard about on Sunday you will be left in the flood and this flood isn't going to be a flood of water it's going to be a flood of Fire fire we will wait and give our testimony before a white Throne of judgment because we refuse to accept the word that was given to us in the day we got it we took it and made it something different than what it truly was don't let tradition stand in the way don't let Grandma or Grandpa's Ministry or teaching of of the message of the hour if it's wrong don't let that get in the way of the truth for your day don't let Mom and Dad's testimony get in the way if they're denominational Believers God bless them but they're just living according to the light for their day that they were given blessed are your eyes brothers and sisters because you're able to see the things of God hallelujah and I just can't imagine what it would be like one day to just live our lives out and believe that we're actually serving God and and and have certain things in our lives that we're just not willing to do the harder work to get over and we just drag them around one day what we're going to find is those things will keep us bound down to this earth there will be be a resurrection and a Rapture and we will think oh my I had that truth it was right in my hands and I just let it slip right through because I wanted something else more than I wanted that we have the opportunity brothers and sisters to change our lives and you know if this message of the hour isn't changing our lives then we're not getting the true message of the hour because it changes us it makes us a new creature in Christ Jesus thank you amen we talk about a God that does not change paragraph 94 the Jews believe that too but the church changed its unchanging God from one to three but the light is returning at evening tide how striking it is that this truth has come at a time when the Jews are returning to Palestine God and Christ are one this is both Lord Jesus sorry this Jesus is both Lord and Christ so we have this being published it's being written from like 1960 up to 1965 grammar tized and and first it was preached in sermons and then it was brought together and put together and you know brothers and sisters 1965 to 2024 now how many years is that that that the Jews have been back in Palestine and now here we have this tremendous conflict going on what's Happening is the political parties that were completely fractured are actually starting to come together as one and you know it's not going to be very long before there's two witnesses over there in that land bringing that 144,000 to this message of the hour to this truth and what's happening right now while all of that is happening brothers and sisters is the spirit of Christ is lifting off of the Gentiles that's why people people don't come to prayer meetings because there's no urgency in their lives to come together and pray that's what's going on brothers and sisters if we don't have the desire to pray in our homes that's what's going on the spirit of this of this of this age is lifting off of the Gentiles and going back to the to the people in Jerusalem there's a reason why we struggle to pray there's a reason why we struggle to come to church it's because without the Holy Ghost in our life there's nothing can strain in US but we have we have a life as we read at the very beginning it's the paragraph we're going to end on tonight Lord willing may God Begin by his Spirit to give us continuous lifegiving and prevailing Revelation oh if the church could only get a fresh Revelation and become by it the Living Word manifested we would do the Greater Works and glorify God Our Father in Heaven if we could only get it brothers and sisters he goes on to say if Revelation is beyond you look up and seek God for it that's the only way you're ever going to get it a revelation has to come from God it never comes by human natural endowments but by spiritual enduement I think that's so beautiful you know there's nothing that we could ever do as human beings and that's why I've said it in the past but I just want to bring it to the surface again when someone is ministering behind the pulpit and and we've prayed that by the spirit God would come on the scene and minister to us that he would do something Supernatural in the service and when we hear the preaching of the Gospel coming to us and we we have something happening in our minds Our Minds start to go somewhere and we start to have thoughts things happen to us and and memories come and all these different things start to happen brothers and sisters if it's according to the word of God it's God's spirit moving in your heart constraining us to do what he's calling us to do now don't don't think for a second that I don't I don't have experience in my own life some of the craziest thoughts that can ever come to our minds happen when we're sitting right here under the anointing of the preaching and that's not God that's the devil and all we've got to do is say Satan get lost in the name of Jesus Christ and sometimes maybe we even have to get up and just take a little walk go downstairs we got speakers you're not going to miss any of the service put Satan under your feet brothers and sisters get him out of your head if he's in your head he's in the wrong spot right a revelation has to come from God it never comes by human natural endowments but by spiritual enduement you can even memorize the scripture and though that is wonderful that won't do it brother Barry is going to say this tonight you can even memorize the message and though that is wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from God and when it's a revelation from God brothers and sisters your lives will be the testimony of it am it says in the word that no man can say that Jesus is the Christ except by the Holy Ghost why you have to receive the Holy Ghost and then and only then can the spirit give you the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ the anointed one amen for many years I thought it was the other way around I had to recognize that Jesus was the Christ and then potentially I could get the Holy Ghost H isn't it interesting this dispensational Prophet God himself speaking through his voice box to man saying the only way you're going to get this is by the Revelation through the spirit and and then you only then you will get it no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit of God reveals them we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world brothers and sisters I want to just underline that I want to highlight that I want to I want to bold italicize whatever we need to do to get that there's only one thing that we need and that's Revelation by the spirit brothers and sisters when that happens then everything else will fall into place behind us all the signs all the Wonders all the things that we desire to see in our lives they'll all follow us we're not looking to see them out front if we are then maybe we're looking at the wrong thing we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world I just want to say this brothers and sisters just because we can say that God sent a prophet doesn't mean we have revelation am just because we can quote quotes doesn't mean that we've got Revelation just because we can come to church doesn't mean we have Revelation it's going to be a manifested life that will demonstrate we've got [Music] revelation we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it but it still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened what happens to us when we become a new creature in Christ Jesus when that word has become quickened we become humble amen and we're willing to Humble ourselves Amen in the sight of the Lord and as we heard about on Sunday that's not coming to church and kneeling down at the pulpit it maybe it is to some extent but you know if we go and live our lives the rest of the week proud boastful knowing all the quotes talking about other people slandering other people gossiping about other people and then coming to church on Sunday because i' I'm revelated man I've got the spirit right right that's exactly what the devil wants exactly that's a religious spirit brothers and sisters don't have a religious spirit have the Holy Spirit get to Jesus Christ and all of that rubbish will go out of our lives and we won't have any room for sin you know brother bradam talks about it and I just believe it with all my heart if we believe that there is a living God if we believe this message of the hour to be true brothers and sisters we should be able to see the power of God manifest in our lives such a way that not one evil spirit could walk through that door and be able to stand it that evil spirit would have to to run away and I want to go even further with it it should be the same thing in our lives but if we've got this and we've got that and we've got the other thing all these things that are just there little things they're little devil tentacles in our lives if we're not willing to cut them off we're going to give Satan access we heard it so good I believe it was God speaking through brother brother Emmanuel was it last Wednesday everything that we don't surrender unto God in our lives everything that we don't give unto God in our lives we just give it to the devil brothers and sisters and it might seem normal but remember remember even though all things are lawful they're not expedient am is it going to help you with your spiritual Revelation think about it before you do it before you look at it before you go there whatever it is we do is it going to increase our ability for Spiritual Revelation or is it going to hinder it amen cuz if it's going to hinder it and we're Believers of this message why would we do it why would we want it we got to Humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord and then he'll Lift us up and that humbling ourselves in the sight of the Lord I want to say it clearly is one to another he doesn't have eyes brothers and sisters he's using your eyes he doesn't have ears he's using your ears he doesn't have mouths he's using your mouth that's why there's a five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints amen but if we can't humble ourselves to our brothers to our sisters how are we ever going to be raised up by God he's going to say you got a religious spirit I can't deal with you you got to get right but boy oh boy when we get that looked after watch out Satan will be powerless before you that's what we're talking about here this might seem real hard brothers and sisters but this is where we're going this we're heading into 24 we're in 24 there's no time to play church if if you're doing that you're going in the and you're not going to hit the Rapture that's all you'll just stay that's what'll happen it'll be the white Throne judgment and hopefully there will be something you did in your life that you can say you know I did this Lord because going into that the white Throne judgment as someone who knew the message of the hour who knew that God sent a prophet but just didn't follow his instructions I what will that be like I'll say it this time I told the story before but there was a time where I got a ticket for something an infraction in my car and I wound up going to court for it and I listened to my friend my friend said oh yeah you can just do this don't worry about it you can go and and and do it and it won't be a problem and what it was was buy a car put a ra uh another license plate on the car and just drive it you can drive it from the place you purchased it to your home and you're covered you have insurance and registration everything is fine you can only do it one time and it's all good so I took his advice bought the car put my PL on got pulled over police said no where's your insurance where's your registration this is for another car you you know this is isn't right and I'm like well but my friend he's like yeah whatever and it wasn't actually a ticket of fine it was a summons to go before a judge so to go before the judge and so of course I go and I've got my my friend told me man I'm going to go and tell that to the judge and and I dress up and I go into the courtroom and I sit there and I wait and and and it's just God he knows how to deal with us doesn't he I wasn't a Believer I wasn't living my life for God at the time but I wound up sitting at the back which was my common place in any situation like that and what happened was I got to watch everyone else in the courtroom go through go through go through and many people they had friends and they had ideas and they had their instructions and they said but but but and the court the judge said but did you have insurance or not yes or no one answer one word and they'd have to say no and he'd say Okay guilty next and it was like that and I got to watch 75 people go in front of me and I thought oh Lord have mercy I'm not going to be able to say anything so I just went up and I said no your honor I didn't have insurance and he said okay guilty boom easy let's go for lunch but you know brothers and sisters one day to know this message of the hour to think that I can take Daddy's instruction or mommy's instruction or anybody's instruction and think that I'm going to get by with it you're not going to you've got to get Revelation by the spirit yourself and then you'll be able to be in that Throne you won't be standing before it we don't want to see we don't want to feel like fools thinking I had it myl it was right there and you know the worst thing we're probably going to get into it on Sunday is the worst thing is we take our families with us who would want to do that to our families no we would want to lay our lives down maybe for our children and our our spouses but goodness sakes don't don't don't don't take our families that way no way we want to know that we know we heard about it on Sunday when we put that that token on the lentil and the doorposts of Our Lives we want to know because that Death Angel is passing through the land brothers and sisters and he's not going to spare he's not going to have mercy he's going to take your children and rip them right out from under you and take them right out into the world that's going to be the outcome of our misbehavior as parents if we want to continue misbehaving that's what's going to happen and you know what unless something Supernatural happens in our lives there's no way that we could ever take our children and prevent them from actually being tempted of the devil I don't know what the quote is exactly but brother Bram says it if you don't have it straightened out in your home rock and roll is going to get your children music will get your children and would we want to sacrifice our children you know in the in the in the in the days of the children of Israel they got tied up with the people in the land we were talking about this over Christmas do we know what the idol Molech was the god Molech yeah they passed their seed through the fire the the parents literally took their children and put them on the idol and the Idol's hands were like this and the baby rolled down the hands Into the Fire as a Living Sacrifice to the God mik you know that's physical brothers and sisters without having the token properly placed in our homes we're doing the exact same thing spiritually P our children unto the unto the God of this world the God of this evil age how many different gods are there we need to make sure brothers and sisters amen we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it but still it's not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened brothers and sisters pray that the spirit would Quicken that word amen the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the righteousness of God by our Union with Jesus Christ did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ it says that he Jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but he became sin for us that by our Union with him we might become the righteousness of God I think that's so beautiful and as I was studying this I just couldn't help but think you know sometimes we talk about the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ and though we have the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ and and the Heavenly bridegroom you know what happens brothers and sisters it's not an invisible Union to you it's not an invisible Union to your family it's quite visible that you have a union with your heavenly father because you live your life differently you don't do the things that you used to do you don't have the same desires that you used to have you don't go to the same places you don't look at the same things you don't listen to the the same stuff you have a desire to serve God you want more Revelation by the spirit in your life the more you get the more you want but it's not an invisible Union it is to the world brothers and sisters not to your brothers and sisters not to your parents not to your children not to your spouses it's not an invisible Union to the world it is paragraph 100 if we accept the fact and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our Union with him have become the very righteousness of God why that is powerful brothers and sisters with you having the revelation of Jesus Christ Quicken the word Quicken by the spirit you have become the very righteousness of God this is God speaking to this generation through a prophet to you to reject one is to reject the other to accept the one is to accept the other now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing how many of us feel like the how many of us actually feel like we are the very righteousness of God and that's where we go back a little ways don't rely on your senses because your senses will lie because if your senses say that you are not the righteousness of God then what are they saying to you they're lying and that's the devil's domain he's going to play in his playground of our senses all day long he'll be on those monkey bars going from one to the other swinging back and forth going back and forth on the swing going la la la la la but boy oh boy when we can actually recognize that by the Spirit quickening by the spirit and put the run on the devil he'll have no power over us brothers and sisters that Revelation won't be missing in our lives it won't be avoid spot in our lives we'll know who we are and where we stand brother brandham says it's not real to the majority of God's children and this is where I want to step in and say this is going to be the difference between the very elected and the foolish virgin between the wise and the unwise Virgin they're both virgin brother bradam says here God says through him that they're both children they're both God's children it's not real to the majority of God's children it is just a good verse in the Bible and I want to say this don't let it just be a good quote in the message or a good verse in the Bible he says but we need to have it made alive to us that will take Revelation it's got to be the revelation of Jesus Christ man I just love this this gets me so excited paragraph 101 let me drop in something here that will both amaze and help you there was hardly a student that does not believe that all the New Testament was originally in the Greek language all our great Bible students have said that God gave the world three great nations with three great contributions for the sake sake of the Gospel he gave the Greeks who gave universal language he gave us the Jews who gave us True Religion and true knowledge of God through the savior he gave us the Romans who gave us a unified empire with law and a system of Highways thus we have True Religion the language to express it to many peoples and the government and Roads to spread it physically and historically speaking this seems to be exactly right isn't it beautiful that God would not just leave it out to pasture he would make sure these things are in place and I want to say it this way he's allowed anointings to hit the Earth at very specific times such as the magnetic recording device where did that come from why was it here why did it just happen just appeared why did we just discover electricity why did we discover the light bulb how did we ever get the phone let alone the cell phone or the computer how did all of this information actually hit the earth is because God allowed it to happen for a very specific purpose and it's interesting because I would would personally say I didn't believe it when I first heard it I was like man you're crazy I think I heard brother Tim DOD say it I thought this guy's a lunatic but what he said was the magnetic recording device was given to Earth so that this voice of a Vindicated Prophet could be retained because it wasn't the voice of a Prophet this was the voice of God speaking through a prophet and all the rest of it's a perversion brothers and sisters and look at where it's gone with music and videos oh television movies all of it it's all perversion from one thing just so that we could hear the voice of a Vindicated Prophet express the thoughts of God to this age my goodness I can see we're not going to finish this part it's beautiful I love it paragraph 102 and today our Greek Scholars say that the Greek language of Bible days is so perfect and exact that if the student of the Greek is a refined and accurate grammarian he can truly know exactly what the new test word teaches but is this not only a theory is it is this true is it not so that every Greek scholar of repute from one denomination debates another student of another denomination and is it not so that their arguments are based on identical Greek words and identical rules of grammar certainly that is the way it is and I want to say this isn't it interesting that we can look at that and say we could we could just take away from that and say you know we have the theologians in the message that would say they can argue a thought they can take a quote and and make it say what they wanted to say and then someone else who is a message Theologian could take their quote out and say but it says this also and then they could go back and the other one could say but I have this and the other one could say but I have that and what what a ridiculous thing it is isn't it why not just say God bless you and let the spirit lead why not get Spirit by Revelation by the spirit and just let the spirit of Jesus Christ lead us and guide us into all truth am but here we have it talking about the the the the the denominational gramians paragraph 103 even back there in the pergan age just prior to the nyine Council of 325 there were two great students Aras and a aanus who became locked in a doctrinal combat over a Greek word so intense and so worldwide did their debate become that the historians said the world was divided over a dip thong the sound of two vowels in a single syllable you know you've heard the statement the devil's in the details if you're getting into the details that far then it's not Christ because simply put he either died for you as a sinner and rose again or he didn't and that's the only thing that counts trying to say that you know know more or he knows less is is is an exercise in wasting time it's just a distraction by the devil paragraph 104 now if the Greek is so perfect and so ordained of God why was there such a dispute surely God did not intend for us all to know Greek right today we're having arguments over the Greek take for instance the book Christ paralyzed Church x-rayed by Dr mcen in it he sets forth numerous quotes from many renowned Greek grammarians and proves to his own satisfaction that the unchanging rules of Greek grammar prove conclusively that the Bible teaches a man baptized with the Holy Ghost subse sorry the Bible teaches a man is baptized with the Holy Ghost subsequent to rebirth he also states flatly that women can take over the pulpit because the word prophesy means to preach but has he conceived convinced sorry other students of the Greek who are as able as he never all you have to do is read those quotes read those all you have to do is read those students who hold the opposite View and hear their learned quotes we're getting there I'd really like to finish this part if we can now not only is what I have just said true but let us go on a step further today we have some students who claim that the original manuscripts were written in aric which was the language of Jesus and the people of his day it is claimed by them that the people did not speak and write in the Greek as it is so commonly supposed and the fact is our historians are divided on that for example Dr shanfield a most brilliant student has from research proved to his satisfaction that the New Testament was written in the vernacular of the greek-speaking people of that day he builds up a fine case for his beliefs based on the various documents at his disposal but on the other hand we have another renowned student Dr lamza Who is convinced that the New Testament was written in the Aramaic and he has none other than the brilliant historian tabbi to back up his contention that the Aramaic and not the Greek was the language of the people so it seems possible that the New Testament was first written in the Aramaic however before we get too concerned about this let us read both the King James version and the translation by Dr lamza to our gratification we find the words in both amazingly the same so that there is no difference actually in content or doctrine I just want to go back to the statement that we read earlier isn't it interesting that even here in in brother bram's day we would be able to have that comparison that Paul and Peter are preaching the same thing they're not changing the word the word is not being changed brother Brown goes on to say paragraph 110 that we may even conclude that God has allowed these newly discovered manuscripts and recent publications of already known scripts to become to come before us to prove the authenticity of what we already had and we find that through translators though translators May fight each other the scripts do not now you can see that you can't base interpretation upon students profound knowledge of the language the Bible is written in but if you still can't see that because you are veiled in your mind by tradition here's one last illustration I'm just going to say this this way now you can't see now you can see you can't base interpretation upon students profound knowledge of the language of the message is written in but if you still can't see that because you are failed in your mind by tradition here is one last illustration no one can doubt but what the scribes and Pharisees and the great Scholars of the Year 33 ad knew the exact laws of grammar and the exact meanings of the words in which the Old Testament was written remember it's said that they could take a scroll which was the word of God and roll it up and they could actually take a pin insert it through it and tell you exactly what scripture verse they have pierced through with that needle when they open up and read it and be accurate with that brothers and sisters they knew the word of God for their day brother ban I'm here saying no one can doubt but what the scribes and Pharisees and the great Scholars of the Year 33 ad knew the exact laws of grammar and the exact meanings of the words in which the Old Testament was written but for all their superb knowledge they missed the revelation of God God's promised word manifested in the Sun and I want to say it brothers and sisters if we don't have Revelation by the spirit in our lives we are going to miss what's actually taking place in our day right he says there he was set forth from Genesis to Malachi with whole chapters devoted to him and his ministry and yet except for a few who were eliminated by the spirit they missed him entirely now we come to a conclusion such conclusion as we have already found in the word as much as we have as we believe in trying to find the oldest and best manuscripts to get the best record of the word possible we will never get the true meaning of it by study and comparison of scriptures sincere as we may be brother Barry speaking here we can be sincere brother brothers and sisters but we can be sincerely wrong we can be sincere but sincerely wrong there's only one way we're going to be right and that's by the word and the word for our day and we have got to make sure that we're living Our Lives according to that word and you know what if we're not it's not too late just change and if you can't change ask God to help change you and I promise you he will he says it will take a revelation from God to bring it out that's exactly what Paul said 1 Corinthians 2:13 which things we also speak not in words by man's Wisdom teacheth but by but with the Holy Ghost teacheth the true revelation of God the true Revelation is God interpreting his own word by vindicating what is Promised isn't that beautiful I'll call the musicians as we close the true revelation of God is God interpreting his own word by vindicating what is promised and what is Promised brothers and sisters that you will become a new creature in Christ Jesus amen what's promised that he will send you you Malachi 4 before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and you know when we receive a prophet in the name of a prophet we receive the prophet's reward and we can think about all the different things that the prophet's going to get as a reward and all the different things that we would like to see as a reward but remember what's the greatest miracle that that Prophet said that he taught in his life that we could become a new creature in Christ Jesus that we could go from being a sinner and become a saint that we could recognize that part of what we read in the word tonight I would say the word excuse me but in this book that we're reading that that portion of it that said you are the very righteousness of God the greatest miracle that could ever happen isn't getting getting things in our lives it's not getting healed it's not seeing tremendous signs and wonders it's that a man could become a new creature in Christ Jesus recognize that he actually died and rose again for me personally brother the brandom goes on to say now don't let anyone be misled by what I have said and think that I do not believe in the accuracy of the word as we now have it I believe this Bible is accurate Jesus completely authenticated the Old Testament when here on Earth and it was compiled exactly as was our new testament make no mistake about it we have the infallible word of God today and no man dares take from it or add to it but we need the same spirit that gave it to teach it to us maybe stand with me as we close remember Phillip he was preaching and the spirit sent him out into the desert told him you need to go and do something I got something for you to do and he found a unic remember the unic was there and and he came upon him and he said hey buddy what's up what are you doing he said I'm reading the scripture and he said how can I understand it though unless someone teaches me right God uses people but what the people say has to line up with the word it can't be different brothers and sisters paragraph 115 oh how we need Revelation by the spirit we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and I'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank God we can have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by his Spirit isn't that beautiful he wants to brothers and sisters he doesn't want to leave us out in the wilderness he wants us to get it and I believe that's why we're all gathered here because he wants us to be quickened by his word we know that word Quicken means alive we're going to get eternal life by his word the Revelation by the spirit is going to change us we're not going to be the same people tomorrow that we are today we're not today who we were yesterday or or 5 days ago or five years ago and if you are the same brothers and sisters I want to encourage you to get going because you're not doing any good if you're the same we've got to be moving we've got to be growing God created this universe to be either moving or stopped you're either growing and living or you're dying true as we close tonight May may God Begin by his Spirit to give us continuous lifegiving and prevailing Revelation amen oh if the church could only get a fresh Revelation and become by it the Living Word manifested he would do the Greater Works and glorify God our Father in Heaven amen let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord tonight I believe that every one of us desires that you would reveal yourself to us and through US Lord father that we would get that Revelation by your spirit that we read about tonight that we wouldn't just be poking at it and thinking about it and talking about it but Lord Jesus that we would just go on our knees and lay ourselves open unto you father and say just Quicken it in my spirit Lord Jesus make me a new creature in you father don't let me go another day the same way oh Father take out all the things that need to be taken out and replace all the things that need to be replaced Lord Lord Quicken me Father by your spirit that I would be a new creature in Christ Jesus father let us be the living manifestation of your word that this church father would be the Living Word it wouldn't just be a a name on a sign somewhere we wouldn't just use it as an affiliation word but Lord that our lives would truly be living out your word amen father we just ask that you would be with us now as we go our separate ways be with those who are traveling father bless their time father away and bring them back home safely again at the appointed time we ask and father we'll be careful to give you all the praise if it's your desire to gather again on Sunday Lord Jesus father we'll do it with joy in our hearts Lord we will bring a sacrifice of praise unto you because we know worship is not optional you said that if you won't worship me that the rocks will immediately cry out oh Father give us a song in our heart Lord and a spring in our step as you give us Revelation by your Spirit Lord we love you we thank you we just commit each life into your hands now as we go our separate ways in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen I am so needy Lord I don't know if I know it but we can try it someone might know it if you know it sing it [Music] I I bless you [Applause] tonight Lord to be more I am am so Lord so
