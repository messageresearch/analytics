opportunity once again Lord Jesus to come and present ourselves before you Lord we haven't come to see one another yes we've come to see you father and Lord Jesus this morning we welcome you in our midst and father you will not be unappreciated while you're here today father we have come to appreciate you today Lord Jesus just like that prostitute we read about last week father that ill-famed woman Lord Jesus outside of your grace each one of us fits that description Lord and father this morning we know that your grace is sufficient and we have come just as that woman that ill-famed woman to appreciate you this morning Lord Jesus we welcome you here this morning Father and we just invite you to have the preeminence that you desire Lord Jesus father we want to bring our requests before you this morning Lord father before we do that we ask that you would just forgive us for any sin in our lives Lord either if there's any iniquity in our heart Lord if there's anything that would hinder our prayers from coming to you Lord this morning we ask that you would forgive us for it Lord let there not be anything that would hinder your spirit today Father Lord let there not be any spirit in our midst that would be contrary to yours either in fact if there is this morning we bind it in the name of Jesus Christ and cast it from our midst Lord and father we loose your spirit now because we want to come according to your word not according to our own righteousness father Lord Jesus we ask that you would meet each request made known unto you this morning by Defying Gravity Lord with an uplift hand you know the needs Lord and father we know that you are more than able father we just ask that you would Lord continue the work in little baby Zoe's life father that you would heal that little hole in her heart father I can't help but imagine that's that maybe that little space that you've created for yourself Lord Jesus and now you'll just perfect that little spot Lord in her life we just ask that you would touch her now in Jesus name father we ask for the risler family Lord the two boys suffering with Lyme disease we thank you for meeting the need in their lives as well Lord Jesus we pray that you would give them strength and encouragement now father and Lord we just ask now as we lord change the order of the service as we go our our separate ways from the singing now into the word father we pray that you would just lead us and guide us Lord that we could just reach up and take father's hand and just ask you to lead us and guide us just take us the direction you would have us go father take this service the way that you would like it to be father and and use it to your glory father speak to us and through us we ask help us each one to get out of the way the spear speaker and the hearer father help us to just set aside our own cares and thoughts Lord and just allow you father to move and we'll be careful Lord Jesus to give you all the praise and all the glory we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles today I just would like to read another scripture another Direction [Music] as we go forwards towards the Easter season out of John chapter 11. John chapter 11. maybe a very familiar scripture for many John chapter 11. and then I'd like to turn over to Revelations chapter 1. John chapter 11. start reading with verse 23. Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die believe us thou is this if you could turn over to Revelation chapter 1 . again familiar scripture Revelation chapter one just like to read from verse 12. Revelation chapter 1 verse 12 and it turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Gert about the pops with the golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool and white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and death let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for these words Lord that we've read this morning we know that it's identifying you and father we just pray that you would help us Lord Jesus as we walk along the way this morning that you would speak to us just like those two along the way to Emmaus Lord father we pray that we would not be slow in heart father to believe all that the prophets have said but that Lord Jesus you would just Quicken this word to our very Souls today we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated story that I wanted to mention is The Story of Lazarus I want to talk about Lazarus this morning and really kind of the idea so you know where I'm going with it is the events kind of the highlights leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus going into the Easter season Jesus got pretty busy just before the crucifixion and we know the prophet said that many many scriptures were fulfilled many prophecies were fulfilled in the last few hours of his life but this one today in the story um he asked her believer style this that's pretty much the inspiration today believe us thou this if you type that in there's many different titles that brother Branham preached this one's from 1960 I believe is thou this but the people in their day they saw Jesus as a good friend but Branham says that uh Jesus he even lived with Lazarus and Mary and Martha for a while he stayed with them and it's an interesting story the way brother Brown brings it he says that he knew what was going on because even though he was Jesus in the flesh he wasn't Jesus in the soul he wasn't Jesus in the spirit he was God all God and to make him anything else means that we're all lost we're lost as lost could be that's it in a nutshell some people want to see a Holy Trinity they want to see the father and they want to see the son and they want to see the Holy Spirit as individuals and and different personalities and we go and make it idolatry at that point and we're not interested in that at all because we recognize that God is the father and God is the Son and God is the Holy Ghost the three are one it's not it's not different personalities different persons of the Trinity it can't be it's got to be just one person God himself and this is who is standing in their midst this is who is living with them in their house this is who Mary washed his feet this is the one the one that we just read in Revelations chapter one because if you read it the very first verse the second verse of Revelations chapter one The revelation of Jesus Christ not the revelation of the Holy Spirit not the revelation of God the Father not a title the revelation of Jesus Christ the one who had the hair white as wool the one who had eyes as the flame of fire that's the one that was standing in their midst that day in Lazarus day personally I think it's amazing because that's the same one that's come to Earth today in the form of his word and the whole entire world is looking for this one to come according to a traditional teaching a maybe a a denominational Theory maybe something from a a a Bible College somewhere a teaching that that Jesus is going to come a certain way and this is the way we believe it but you know God has always spoken to his people a certain way and it's not been through a bible college and it's not been through the Pharisees or the Sadducees we know that the most religious people of his day are the ones that actually crucified him they are the ones of his day that took up Stones when he said I and my father are one those notable words and he said wherefore do you want to persecute why do you want to kill me what's going on why do you want to do that and they said not because of the mighty good works that you do you're a really nice guy we really like you we like the works that you do we love that people get healed we love that you draw great crowds and we can actually get tremendous some sums of money from the amount of people that you draw It's a Wonderful campaign that you have but my goodness when you go make yourself one with God then that's getting to be a little bit too much then you're going a little bit too far and that's where we're going to have to draw the line and you know brothers and sisters that's the same thing for us today it's no different as soon as we start saying I and my father are one as soon as this word is inside of me you know we can't sing that song and not see it any other way the word is working mightily in me what's happening when the word is working mightily and me are we just singing a song and clapping our hands and and getting into the the spirit of the service the word is working mightily and me it's a wonderful time and then I'm just gonna go home or are we eating the book and the word is actually working mightily in me when I go to work when I go to school when I go home my family sees that this word is working mightily in me because that's really what that song is about brothers and sisters it's not about getting in the spirit of the service it's wonderful to get in the spirit of the service brother Branham says it you've got to get into the spirit of things if you want to get into it you've got to get into the spirit of it and the only way you're going to do that is by Revelation to recognize God's presence that he's here in our midst and when we come to church we come to church to meet with God that's why we come to church I just think the the story here today out of John chapter 11 is is a fantastic story and you know we know the story very well I'm just going to start with a quote here the Patmos Vision brother Bradham and the church age book he says is his eyes were as fire he says think of it those eyes that were once dimmed with tears of sorrow and pity those eyes that wept with compassion at the grave of Lazarus those eyes that saw not the evil of the murderers who hanged him on a cross but in sorrow cried father forgive them now those eyes are a flame of fire the eyes of the judge who will recompense those who rejected him of all the human emotions he manifested the most when he appeared as the son of man was this one he wept often I think it's amazing to see this he wept often and you know brother Branham he talks about it in this in this message the uh believer style this in 1960 at the end of it how the woman challenged him what we'll probably if we have time we'll read the quote near the end of it but she challenged him and said how could he weep at the grave of Lazarus if he was divine if he was God how could he do that I'll and she was arguing she was challenging him saying that he wasn't Divine it wasn't it wasn't God he was just a great prophet brother Bradham says that's that story is about as as strong as the broth that was made from the shadow of a chicken that starved to death how could you say that God himself couldn't weep how could he not weep he was a man but he was God he was all that but he was all God brother Adam says he wept often yet behind that weeping and that sorrow there was still God those same eyes saw Visions they look deep within the hearts of men and read their very thoughts I knew all their various ways blazing out of mortal Eyes Of God who cried to those who knew him not for what he was if ye believe not that I am he you shall die in your sins John 8 24. if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do the works of my father though you believe me not believe the works John 10 37 38. like Jeremiah of old he was the weeping prophet for men receive not the word of God and thrust aside the revelation and that's kind of where we want to go today brothers and sisters we don't want to thrust aside the revelation we want to recognize God in our presence this is God when we talk about Jesus Christ we're talking about God himself when we talk about the Holy Ghost we're talking about God himself you can't separate them Holy Ghost is the spirit of God in Jesus Christ the father is a father the father is a father he could be anybody's father how many fathers are there in this room even in this world let alone how many sons are there and how many Holy Spirits are there we could we could just say that they're titles they're not actually names but we know the word of God says to baptize the name of the Father the name of the son the name of the Holy Ghost we can take that literally and just run forward with it is what happened with many denominationals but if we just step back and think about it for a second what is the name of the father what is the name of the son what is the name of the Holy Ghost The Book of Revelation here says that it's the revelation of the Father the Son or the Holy Ghost no the revelation of Jesus Christ if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do the works of my father believe ye though he believe me not believe the works brother Brown goes on to say those fiery flaming eyes of the judge are even now recording the lives of All Flesh this is where it gets interesting he's here in this room right now brothers and sisters maybe in your living rooms in your cars wherever you might be he's there with you right now recording the thoughts in your hearts I remember hearing about this man who is a manifestation of the word of God in our day William Miriam Branham and hearing that there was this man that could discern the hearts of men it was one of the gifts that he was given as a sign to capture the attention of the people so that the word could be open to them so that they would have their attention focused on this man to see what was going on with him but he could discern the very thoughts in the hearts of a man and I I remember thinking that's a man that I'm never going to meet because I know that I'm a skunk and if the world if people knew the thoughts that were inside of my heart oh my it would be terrible but you know brothers and sisters many times those thoughts aren't even ours but Satan will say they are he'll tell us they're our thoughts but they're not our thoughts I know brother Bradham says it in places that we don't even have a thought coming we've got either Thoughts From God or we've got thoughts from the devil I remember as a kid we had TV in our home and one of the cartoons would always show a little devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other shoulder and one was influencing one way and one was influencing the other way and it seemed like a joke like it's just a cartoon but it's I think probably a whole lot more real than we actually give it credit not not to say that a cartoon is a good thing I don't want to do that but I want to say that you know what we're influenced one way or the other and and whoever we give the credit is what's going to happen in our lives but the random talked about the the the First Nations chief remember that story and he says how you doing Chief and he says wow it depends on the day you know and and he says what do you mean chief and he says well some days good some days bad and how do you know the difference well some days one one I have two dogs the story of the two dogs fighting right the the light one and the dark one the white one the black one and how one one wins and the other loses and some days it's the other way around and he says how do you know the difference and he says it's the one that I feed the most it's beautiful when we talk about this because really it's it's all about who we feed who are we feeding on what are we feeding on in our lives that's what's going to do it for us and you know brothers and sisters I say Lord help me I want to make sure that I'm feeding in the right sources I want to be doing the right thing I'm a man I'm susceptible to the pressures of this life but there's only one thing that makes me different from everyone else and not any different than a Believer but it's the word of God and just just just just believing without this just saying that I believe the word of God and I accept it for me in my day that's the only thing that we can do we can't say that we have any good works that we could bring you know we sang that song years I spent in vanity and pride oh my not knowing that my my my my Lord was crucified and why was he crucified it wasn't for everyone else in this world it was for me was just for me and that's another song that we sing I can go keep going on but songs I don't really mean to do that but it's just a wonderful thing to recognize it's got to be our own experience it's got to be our own savior he has to die for me for this guy when we can recognize that brothers and sisters then those flaming eyes of judgment turn to Eyes Of Love because we can recognize that though all these other people in the world haven't been chosen to be given the position in him he chose you he chose me to have ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church to be able to say Amen to the word and you know some people will be able to go all the way to Calvary and accept that Jesus Christ died for their sins and and rose again on the third day and they will rise with him as well in the resurrection there's no question about that and we're not here to put anybody in or put anybody out we're just here to promote Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever not not to say that he is just Jesus Christ back there at Calvary 2000 years ago no he has to be alive and well today two thousand years later it's got to be the Lord Jesus Christ for me my own personal experience those fiery flaming eyes brother Adam says of the judge or even now recording the lives of All Flesh running to and fro throughout the Earth there was nothing he does not know I love that there's nothing that he does not know so when we have stuff in our lives that we're not willing to deal with there's doors that that we get so close up to and then we freak out and run away because we're just about there to open that door and he wants to open that door he wants to get into that door in the door but then we just can't deal with it there's nothing that he doesn't know it's that we don't know we just need to open that door and allow him in and he'll deal with the stuff and he's just waiting remember the story The the picture of Jesus on the outside knocking to get in this is the only church age that he was put out by the church and he's on the outside knocking to get in and remember brother Adam he said that story there was one problem with that picture the guy the artist never put the handle the door handle on the door and he said no no that was intentional and the reason for that is because the door handle is only on one side the door handles on the inside of the building and and he can't open the door he's not going to open the door and force his way in he's going to knock like a gentleman because he is a gentleman he's going to say hey can I come in are you going to welcome me are you going to wash my feet are you going to appreciate me and anoint me with oil are you going to wash me with your hair are you going to take care of me and acknowledge me or are you just going to invite me and leave me knocking on the outside and say welcome Jesus we want you to come Jesus welcome welcome welcome but we're just going to leave you on the outside that door handle is on the inside for us to open and and brother around him preached that message doors indoor he doesn't want to have any door left left closed there's no door on the secret chamber underneath the stairs hidden room that we just have stuff hidden in we want it to be all open for him to be able to have free access because there's things in our lives brothers and sisters that we cannot deal with on our own there's things that we don't have the power over there's things that that you know what could be from Generations before us from our fathers from our grandfathers from our great-grandfathers you know the word says that he will visit the iniquity upon the children to the third and the fourth generation who knows what could happen I've been taking a look recently at the uh the coronation the whole thought the theory of the royal monarchy I've never really paid that much attention to it I I always thought you know it's nice and there's so much attention to the Royal monarchy and you know when you when you look at the the documentation of the lives of the royal monarchy it goes back a long long ways and there is actually a a royal I don't know what you call it a lineage maybe website on on the Royal website whichever you call it I can't remember what you call it but it and it actually explains all of the different lives all of the different sovereigns all the different Kings and the ruling peoples and parties that from from the monarchy all the way back to the very beginning and you could read for a long long time but you don't want to spend too much time with it you know but I just think it's fascinating to think that there's that much documentation but to see all of that brothers and sisters if if man can do that how much more of a recording is there in heaven where the sins of the fathers are being visited upon the sins of this third and fourth generation of the children it's astounding when you think about it if men can record that well what does happen in heaven what's God doing there but you know as for believers when we accept the word for our day when anybody in any age accepted the word for their day those flaming eyes of judgment turn to Eyes Of Love they're no longer eyes of judgment that's where we can say hey you know what if you want to put me on the stake and you want to burn me on the stake you don't have to bind my hands just put me on on the stake and and just light it up just go for it just light it up and what happens the the supernatural takes over and we know the stories we've heard them many times people cannot die the Flames will lick up around the people and they'll still be alive and and the people will be like why aren't they dying what's wrong with them take a spear and actually stab them and they'll stab them with a spear and water will pour out of their body and put out the flames this is real documented stuff by the way this is history that's recorded as well it can happen but you know we're not interested in the signs or wonders necessarily we're interested in finding out that those flaming eyes of judgment recording our very lives right now that they're not eyes of judgment there's Our Eyes Of Love and their eyes of forgiveness their eyes of Grace those eyes that brother Bradham said when he he saw that vision of Jesus and and and he saw the vision of him in the in the field in the sagebrush field and this man was there and he gives a very graphic description of what he saw and he was just kind of looking away he wasn't really looking directly at brother Bradham but but he tried to clear his throat to get his attention and he tried a few different methods to get his attention but then he finally said his name and when he said his name he said that face that looked at him he had the power to stop everything to turn the world upside down that power in those eyes those flaming eyes of judgment look at him says those fiery flaming eyes of the judge are even now recording the lives of All Flesh running to and fro throughout the Earth there is nothing he does not know he knows the desires of the heart and what each one intends to do there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed for all things are naked before him with whom we have to do think of it he knows even now what you are thinking yes he stands as judge with flaming eyes to meet out judgment the day of Mercy is over oh that man might repent and seek his face in righteousness while there is yet time that they might make his bosom their pillow Heir the world dissolves in fire just wanted to to bring that quote just to maybe set a little bit of a background that you know this one who is at the tomb of Lazarus this one that was living with Mary and Martha this one that was a a good bosom friend of Lazarus this one was God himself this was the creator the one that spoke and said let there be light this is the one that created man this is the one that pulled Eve outside of man that performed the very first surgery this is the one that said Thou shalt eat of every single tree in the garden except for that one don't you dare touch that one tree because the moment you do you shall die that day you shall die that was the one who was with them there and you know it's a it's an interesting thing because brother Brady talks about the story and how Mary and Martha they they had different ways about them one was very concerned about the Earthly matters and and getting things done and the other one was interested about hearing every single word of the master hanging on every single word and and she was judged for that for hanging on every single word and we could be judged that way too brothers and sisters in our day even though we have responsibilities there's something that constrains us to the word of God in our day I think it's just such a beautiful thought to to think about verse 26 and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this I think that's such a beautiful scripture because you know the the word of God talks about there being ten virgins right there's five wise virgins and there's five unwise virgins and and we know in our our time where we live it's been very clearly said that the wise virgins they had oil it's what the Bible says and The unwise Virgins they had oil but they didn't have enough they were just lacking their oil and when the bridegroom came the shout came forth the five wise were able to rise up and trim their lamps the shout went forth rise and trim your lamps and and they did that but the other five they couldn't trim them right because they didn't have enough oil they started to sputter and carbon and and burn Smoky and and they said to the wise give us of your oil and they said no not so we don't have enough for us and you you got to go buy your own you got to go and and get your own and we know the word says that well they went to get some because they desired it they really wanted it they were sincere well they went to get their oil the door was shut the door was closed and the word says they came back they must have found it somewhere they came back and when they came back they were knocking on the door they were now on the outside knocking on the door and what did he say hey I never even knew you and we know that the word says brother Branham said I'm sorry that uh those will go through the tribulation those unwise virgins will actually be the ones that go through their tribulation we don't put anybody in or or take anybody out that's not up to us to do it it's the word that does the dividing it's the word that does the Sorting it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever speaking about our our story this morning though Mary and Martha and and the story of Jesus we know that Jesus was living with them and what happened was because he wasn't just a man waiting for the anointing of a spirit to come to him to show him the things that must come he was God In the Flesh he knew what was going to happen and brother Branham says what Jesus did was he left town just before this was going to happen he said you know what I gotta go and he left them fully knowing that Lazarus was going to get sick he was going to contract maybe something some kind of a virus some kind of a plague he was going to get something that was going to put him in the grave Jesus knew that and and what did he do he left anyways took his disciples with them and we know that the disciples they they didn't understand what was going on they just were following Jesus again they were following the master he he's on a campaign he's got a another special service to have over here we're just going to go and support and and do everything we can to give him the encouragement that he needs to make sure that nobody gets in his way we're just gonna go and play along and see what will happen and we know that while he went Lazarus got sick his friend his bosom friend got sick and real sick to the point where he died and it's interesting there's so much in this story but I just want to stick to the part that brother Branham talks about and and that's out of verse 26 believeth thou this do we do we believe that whoso that whoso liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this Jesus wasn't fussed at all he left town he took some disciples with him Lazarus got sick and when Lazarus got sick he died and they sent to Jesus and said you know your your best friend is sick he's really sick you need to come you need to come because we know if you come you could heal him you you could actually speak that sickness away and he'll be just fine and and nothing will be be wrong they knew that he was the master but what happened when they told Jesus I just think it's such an interesting thought what happened was he he didn't Flinch at all he just said yeah you know okay maybe we'll just pray about it and we'll just see what happens we're not going to get too fussed here we're not going to get too upset we're not going to get in a flap we're just going to see what happens here and what happened Jesus seemingly let him die just allowed his friend to die and and the people that day they they couldn't understand it they couldn't realize what on Earth was going through his friend's mind this was the master this was the Messiah in their mind but yet he he didn't have the care or concern to come and deal with his friend to prevent his friend from going into the grave how could this be how could he be the master how could he be the friend I'm sure they were questioning everything they thought they knew about this man Jesus at this point and we know that he was scorned heavy by the most religious people oh he he just let his friend die you know there's there's nothing good in him anyways we knew that he was from Nazareth and nothing good can come out of Nazareth you know talking about how this actually applies to us today this is really where we need to go with this and and it's what brother Branham does as well and I think it's just so beautiful the way that he does it and I just I just love taking the lesson from it but you know he says that the church still has power and many times in our lives it can seem like we don't and and how we need to recognize that we have to have the right kind of power we have said it before I'm sure everyone has heard it said before that power without character is satanic that's what brother Branham teaches and and the power that we're talking about is the power of the one with the eyes that is the as the flame of fire with the white wig on the one supreme deity the Lord Jesus Christ in eternity that's the power we're talking about we're not talking about having power on our own to be able to just wave our wand and and see the Holy Spirit move and and just call on the name of Jesus and then suddenly something magical is going to happen nope that's not the way it works we we have to live a consecrated life unto the Lord and trust him and trust that his judgment is correct every single time especially when he doesn't answer our prayers the way we think that he should but he says the church still has power and and he talks about that epileptic child that the disciples couldn't heal in this message believeth now this in 1960 the epileptic child you know Jesus he sent the disciples out two by two and he gave them power over over illness he gave him the power over Devils he gave him power and what happened was they encountered one one child with an epileptic spirit that they couldn't heal and and they brought that one to Jesus the man came and said look there's something wrong with the disciples experience here and the disciples were perplexed by it too and they even said Master why why is it that we could cast out every other devil we could race people from the dead but this one we couldn't do anything with why is that and he said because of your belief because of your unbelief because you still don't recognize Who You Are and and brother I'm talking here when that epileptic when it come up before the Lord Jesus the boy had the hardest fit he ever had perhaps fell on the ground like he was dead but he realized that he met someone who had Faith far above these apostles that Spirit recognized what was going to happen that Spirit knew what he was in for brother Adam says now I'd like for someone that didn't believe in Divine Healing to watch this Jesus had given them power to cast Spirits out and they had failed not the power had failed but they had failed Jesus told them why could we not cast him out because of your unbelief the church still has a power God has never taken his power from the church I think it's amazing to think about he gave the church power there and never took it back brother Branham says that you know the scholars in his day were saying you're trying to preach a an Apostolic message you're trying to to preach something that's that's Divine Healing that's just not right anymore and brother Branham says you know I can tell you where it started in the Bible and you show me where it ended in the Bible and then we'll have something to talk about and it's never ended brothers and sisters he's the same yesterday today and forever he said because of your unbelief the church still has power God has never taken his power from the church but the church don't have faith enough to act upon it that's all it's just that simple brothers and sisters I want to try and encourage us every time I come up here to remind us who we are that's the purpose of these gatherings to remember who we are to maybe learn who we are to discover who we are who we truly are we're not just this Flesh and Blood people that are living in our lives and have been raised by these parents and have done these different things in our lives you are the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ that he took from himself from his side before the foundation of the world and positionally placed to be here today to be able to receive this word because he will always have a representation on Earth always until the time he doesn't it's coming a time where he will pull his representation and we know that when that happens when the bride goes up Satan's cast down but even in that time there's still people that will still believe they just wouldn't have had oil and it's going to be terrible there's people that will have to give their lives but they still will believe they won't accept the mark of the beast brother Adam says because of your unbelief is what Jesus said the church still has power God has never taken his power from the church but the church don't have faith enough to act upon it that's all it's just that simple I just love the way he says this brothers and sisters we try to make it so complicated sometimes but the more simple you make the gospel the more reality you will have when you just get real simple with it God said so that settles it and that's all and just believe it go ahead brothers and sisters believe us thou this when we hear words like this this isn't just a man this isn't just some man who is Prophet prophetic man speaking words this is God Almighty speaking through a man to try and tell us who we are to try and give us encouragement to come up a little higher we know the Book of Revelation chapter 4 John was shown an Open Door in heaven and he was given the invitation come up a little higher I can't help but think that that was that door in heaven wasn't just a door like we see with hinges on it maybe like at the back or up here with a push latch a panic bar maybe with an automatic door closer and a frame it wasn't just a door it was a cloud just like we saw above sunset Mountain there's a revelation for you John a type of the Bride just come a little higher and take a look at the things which must come to pass shortly Hereafter we tried to make it so complicated sometimes but the more simple you make the gospel the more reality you'll have when you just get real simple with it God said so that's battles it and that's all just go believe it go ahead he says and it's interesting because in Jesus day standing at the tomb of Lazarus the whole entire world was taking Jesus and just making him simple he was just simple how could he you know what are we doing here this this this man is coming to the tomb of Lazarus why didn't you come you're just simple but you know what the pendulum has swung the other way now we've got the Mysteries open and people have taken this gospel and made it so mysterious and complicated people can't even get to Christ brothers and sisters we still need the blood of Jesus Christ and I'd say this outside of the blood of Jesus Christ we'll never know what the mysteries of the message of the hour are we'll never understand what those unknown Thunders contained in the seals truly were for try to make it so complicated sometimes just need to keep it simple just allow the word to do the washing in our lives just say be it unto me according to Thy word Lord just allow that angel messenger just like Gabriel came to Mary and and created that Supernatural life inside of her that was neither the Egg of Mary or the seed of of her husband Joseph it wasn't part god part man it was all God if it wasn't all God brothers and sisters like we said we're lost we're lost as lost can be because man is corrupt and it goes back to the original sin in the garden and I don't know if we want to get into that today but brothers and sisters what really happened in the garden did eating fruit truly cause the full complete fall of mankind from the grace of God to be kicked out of the garden consuming a fruit I mean you can just you can just say it to anyone in the world what was the original sin what's Original Sin and you get a very similar answer from almost every single person you speak to it but we try to make it so complicated we try to make it some kind of a theory that we we we learn somewhere along the way but once we can see it it just becomes crystal clear and and we can't unsee it you can't get away from it brother Branham says if thou can'tst believe in this message believeth thou this when Jesus said no man Edith from thee why the leaves were just as pretty and bright as they ever was the bark looked the same but way down beneath the ground in those roots the life began to dwindle away you might be saying brother Barry you just jumped ahead of yourself and indeed I did and I'm glad you're with me it's interesting because we're talking about that fig tree that was right around the same time and Jesus was all man brother Branham says it here he was all man and he was hungry the word says that he hungered and he wanted a fig off that tree and that tree had no fruit remember we've heard it so many times I am the vine and ye are the branches and all the branches that don't have fruit what happens they get pruned they get pruned and they get tossed Into the Fire they're not good for anything but boy the branches that bear forth fruit they're the ones that get purged he pours his life from the vine into those branches and causes them to continually put forth fruit I say Lord help me to bear fruit unto you but here we have brother Brown I'm telling this story that Jesus passing by here he he he sees this tree and it doesn't have fruit and he's hungry and he's like you're no good to me you know I came by once the one time that I come past you you don't have anything for me you're no good there's nobody going to eat from you ever again brother Branham he says in this quote here no no man eateth from thee why the leaves were just as pretty and bright as they ever was even though he spoke the words everything looked normal on the outside didn't they the bark looked the same but way down beneath the ground in those roots the life began to dwindle away so it is upon a cancer upon any kind of disease that you might want to think when you can accept God's word way down deep in the roots the cancer may be there your hand may be just as stiff that don't have nothing to do with Divine Healing it's if thou can't believe see way down somewhere it's already gone to work and I think it's so fantastic for us to hear these words brothers and sisters because many times when we speak words under inspiration even when we speak words we don't see anything happen right we don't see any change at all I don't know if anybody has ever had a prayer or ever spoken under inspiration and and seen it come to pass exactly the way that you've said it but it doesn't happen necessarily instantly but have you ever experienced it brothers and sisters where you see it come to pass years later and you're like wow God brings it back to your memory and says remember those words that you said yes and Satan will say oh now you're just getting super spiritual you're getting a little bit outside of your realm he'll be right there to try and discount all of it brothers and sisters but don't discount it just remember we're living in the third poll age we're living under the anointing of the third Paul not the first poll or the second poll I would go so far as to say it that even when you think something he'll discern that thought and bring it to pass according to the way you thought it and the reason that happens brothers and sisters this is the beautiful part is because it's not even your thought it's him thinking through you you're thinking his thoughts because he said let the mind that was in Christ Jesus be also in you and when we're there brothers and sisters then we don't even have to say it but once in a while we just feel like it you know what I and my father are one and when we say those words every single cell in our body hears it every single devil in hell hears it every single person in heaven hears it and you can bet that in heaven they're cheering us on screaming amen keep pressing on don't give up this ain't no time to be given up this is a time to press hard brothers and sisters to keep saying it and the more you don't feel like it say it more say it more so it is upon a cancer upon any kind of a disease that you might want to think when you can accept God's word way down deep in the roots the cancer may be there I don't have anything to do with it there's nothing to do with it it's if you can believe if we can believe all things are possible Jesus said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you've said amen amen you know the Book of James says that many times we ask but we ask a miss and why do we ask amiss because we're asking to consume it upon the lusts of our flesh maybe I'm hungry maybe I've got bills maybe I've got a desire for something else it'd be sure nice to see something else but you know what Hattie Wright was faced with that too wasn't she she said you know what I have one desire in my heart and she had to explore it it took a few minutes and we know that God speaking through the prophet he said ask what you want and you got it and he even said do you want a million dollars she was broke she was poor your sister we've prayed for her many times in the wheelchair and she's never been healed do you say the word right now and she'll be healed she'll get out of that wheelchair thus saith the Lord had he right but she said you know what there's only one thing of Eternal value and this is where brothers and sisters this wasn't had he writes speaking I have to say this was the Lord Jesus Christ the one with the eyes is the flame of fire the white hair the white wigged one was there with her in that room saying ask what you want it wasn't a man saying ask what you want it wasn't just a separate Spirit saying ask what you want it wasn't the father saying what you want it wasn't just the son saying what you want it was God himself saying ask what you want thus saith the Lord through the prophets and she said there's only one thing that's of Eternal value it was the word to the word again just like out of it is the rising of the Sun that word that was inside of her that seed Gene of God Said Amen to the word when it came from the prophet thus saith the Lord ask what you want you want a million bucks you got it she knew the million bucks would probably corrupt or no I don't want that I want to see the life of my sons I want them to be there with me under that tree in heaven eating of the fruit of the Vine with the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said he says isn't that lovely oh my who who'd that come from he says would that come from the Son of God whose words Heaven and Earth will pass away oh but his words won't think about that brothers and sisters heavens and earth will pass away everything that we see tangible in our lives right now will pass away we we we don't even won't even see our sons and our daughters and our brothers and our sisters and our husbands and our wives you can't see the real each other the only thing that's going to make it is his word his word in US is the only thing that's going to make it the random says now the only way that you can do that you've got to have the right objective and the right motive and how can you do that if you don't have the mind of Christ in you can you do that if we don't have the right right right person living inside of us how can that ever happen now the only way that you can do that you got to have the right motive and objective now if I went out here and said I'll show you I can move this mountain be moved Mountain it would never move certainly not no matter what I had if it's got to be first you got to find the will of God I just think it's a beautiful thing amazing to think that if you say to this mountain be thou removed and don't doubt that you'll have it you'll have it in your in your life you'll see it what happens in our lives though brothers and sisters as we encounter problems will go from a tremendous service and and maybe a tremendous sign and wonder in our lives to a great trial and and will wonder just like those with with Mary and Martha didn't didn't he get the memo didn't he hear that we actually prayed in that prayer meeting that he would come and heal his best friend Lazarus he didn't hear those words I thought he was the master I thought he was the Messiah the devil will come around and say was he was he truly and we'll start wondering boy I don't know remember brother Branham said when his wife and his daughter died what was the words that came to him Satan came and said you can heal all these other people look at your great campaign but you can't save your wife or your daughter oh my that's the god you serve eh that's the one you worship and we know that he had to be exactly like Jesus get thee behind me Satan you're an offense to me Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God but brother Branham in this message says that he tries his church he says God I believe today before he puts his church in power he tries his church to see what it'll do he puts us through trials brothers and sisters he puts us through tribulations he gives us problems and circumstances and what happens is it expresses who we are because you know when we come to church this is something we've talked about with the young people when we come to church we're polished we put on our best and and our cars are clean usually and and maybe we smell good and and we've got everything is in order there's no issues in our lives right everything is fine we shake hands and say God bless you that was a great service and we go home without recognizing that each one of us have major problems each one of us have major trials in our lives each one of us are continually being tried and what that's doing is expressing who we are it's easy to express a good happy Christian in the monks of Believers especially when we're under the anointing of the word it's it's pretty easy when we go home to do that as well but you know brothers and sisters when the pressure comes in our lives that shows Who We Are [Music] this doesn't show Who We Are when the pressure comes in our lives when we get really angry when when we get really sad when we get really frightened all of the different ranges of emotions that happen in our life that expresses Who We Are I say Lord help me I'm not exempt from this trial I get trials but I just think it's beautiful to recognize that God has never taken away his power but before he actually gives us the ability to recognize the power in our own lives he tries us so when we look around and we see everyone highly polished and everything is great in their lives brothers and sisters young people old people whoever people it's because we're going through trials it's because we're we're we're we're we're we're scarred people we've actually fought some battles and we recognize the the more that we surrender the more he takes control and the more he takes control the more success we're going to have in our lives but as long as we're doing it on our own boy oh boy we get in the way now let's get into our story Mary and Martha brother Adam says Jesus had a great Fellowship especially with Lazarus when we read into the book that where he did come to their home and Martha was a little dilatory about listening to his words but she had to get the dinner ready and set the table but Mary set at his feet and Jesus said that Mary had chosen the better things we know in that story there that Martha got upset and said why am I the one that's always laboring why am I the one that's always doing the work around here why isn't she helping why is it me we know that Jesus he said to her you know what she chooses right the food is temporal the food our hunger is temporal all the cares of this life they're temporal why don't we just sit down and reason around the word and just allow the word to wash us so we know that we talked about this but just you know brother Branham in this message he says so to make this this really the right story The Father God must have spoken to his son Jesus and said your friend Lazarus is going to die but it's going to be for the good so you leave the home go away because it'll be asked of you to pray for him or make him well and I don't want you to do that if you'll watch the story as we go along you'll see it heaps up to that very truth of that so Jesus without any warning or anything walked away from the house and went somewhere else didn't return that night and he went to some other cities and as soon as Jesus left the home then trouble set in you know brothers and sisters last week we talked about welcoming Jesus into our midst and and welcoming here knowing that he's here but then when he's here and he wants to speak to our heart when he wants to Express himself to us in our lives maybe when he wants to express worship through our lives maybe when he wants to do something for us in the midst of his welcome and we reject it then we're not accepting him we're not welcoming him we're actually what happens is we wind up making a mockery of him is what we talked about last week I don't want to go too far with that but you know here we have Jesus now he leaves the situation and brother Bradham says in this story that as soon as Jesus leaves the home then the trouble sets in but then he goes on to explain it a little further and I think it's so beautiful because it's it's vital for us in our day brothers and sisters we have to see how we can connect the dots how does this apply to us today how does it change my life today brother Barry well this is how it is he says and when Jesus leaves your home trouble is on its Road just remember when he leaves your home Trouble Is On The Way when you get social societies and everything operating in your church so perfectly like some great big 16 cylinder Rickenbacker and you leave Jesus out of it when Jesus goes from your church troubles on the road and I just think that's such a beautiful thought because we can do that brothers and sisters we can get such a tight grip of control on our house on our family on everything that we do we've got such control we don't give the Lord Jesus Christ the room that he wants to move in our lives to move in our homes to move in our families of course we have to be diligent with our lives and our families but we have to put him first if we put him first then he doesn't leave but if we get so busy trying to manage everything and then we just find a little space for him at the back we wind up doing exactly what the the Pharisee did we'll find Jesus over in the corner we welcomed him to our house but we're just going to set him over there because we're so busy with everything else over here speaking from experience if we do that brothers and sisters troubles on the road it's coming and we can do the same thing in the church we can operate our church like a fine fine running machine like a 16 sealer reckon boxer engine brother Bradham says we can get it so fine-tuned everything in Balance everybody knows their position everyone's got a uh uh uh direct list of everything that needs to happen we can operate the church exactly the way we operate a business and what happens we push Jesus out there's no room for dynamic power to happen and that's when trouble's on the road he says yes sir when Jesus leaves a denomination that they lay him aside and say well now we just don't believe that these things could be just exactly right and you adopt something else troubles on its Road just remember that and you know we said it earlier that just like that fig tree the word was spoken but the leaves they look just fine the bark looked the same nothing changed and that's how it is that's how subtle it is when things change in our lives it's a subtle thing it's not necessarily A cataclysmic impact but you know what that word will always take effect according to the word of God and if we just give Jesus second place if we just give him a back seat and say that I've got all these other things that I want to do all these other things that I want to look at and I know they could be questionable you know what Paul said to the church he said that all things are lawful but not expedient and you know we can look at it and say hey if you really want to get um literal about it we could say that pot's legal now that came through in our day I remember as a delinquent that pot was contraband but it was something that people did they they did everything they could to keep it undercover to not get busted with with pot with with marijuana but now in my lifetime I saw it go from being Contraband where people would be charged and thrown in prison for it and find heavily really judged for it now it's just fine it's legal go ahead you can get some in other people's lives they would have witnessed that with alcohol there was not there was a time where alcohol was prohibited prohibition you couldn't have alcohol and it was always underground and secretive but yet there was always seemed to always be some of the influence around but you know because it's legal it doesn't mean there's something that we're going to go out and do is it just because we can do that all the different drugs they're talking about implementing and saying that they're going to be legal think about this world and how it's falling apart it's amazing to look at I just shake my head and and say wow even so come Lord Jesus but as soon as we want to try and and and make it all our way that's when Trouble Comes whether Brad I'm a church age book he says that uh you know sometimes we'll have a a great experience and and a tremendous outpouring of the spirit and and that's where we'll say quick we need to gather around it now and we need to protect it and as soon as we do that that's where we put a period behind the word and the spirit leaves but we'll still have great services and signs and wonders remember brother Bradham he says he gets asked the question what will they preach after the Rapture what will they preach after the Rapture and he says they'll preach the same thing they'll go on baptizing they'll go on screaming shouting maybe even speaking in tongues but they won't have the spirit we don't want to actually see the spirit leave us we don't want to see Jesus leave because as soon as Jesus leaves that's when trouble sets in and that's what the story is here Jesus left he understood the instruction he never did anything unless the father first showed him we know that and the father was God and and the father showed him hey you know what you're going to have to leave because I'm going to express myself through you in this situation but how did he do it first a man had to die isn't it amazing to think about there's nothing too great or too bad for God in this world there's nothing too tragic there's nothing too shocking or alarming for him nothing surprises him is what my dad has said so many times there's nothing that surprises God and you know brothers and sisters that's such an amazing thought to take and maybe put in our pocket and just say you know when we fall down tomorrow when we trip up and make a mistake next week when there's something that happens in our lives we're going to surprise ourselves so many times I've shocked myself to think that that's exactly how I was but yet didn't surprise God doesn't surprise the Lord he knew what was going to happen here but the random talks about how Jesus when he left how his parents one time they left they left Jerusalem and they were on their way they had all the kin folk and everyone with them and they were sure that Jesus was with them but they just took it for granted they didn't go and check that Jesus was with them and what happened because of that they were actually a total I would say of about nine days behind schedule because they went out three days then they had to go back three days and just to get back to where they were it was another three days how far back does it put us when we leave Jesus behind brothers and sisters God's program will always come to pass in our lives but we can put ourselves quite a ways behind if we're not diligently checking to make sure that Jesus is with us Jesus has got to be with us we can't take it for granted that he is with us brothers and sisters we need to ensure that he is with us every single day checking that he is with us and I just can't help but think you know as Paul said I just die out daily I just check and make sure that Jesus is with us I check and make sure that I'm dying so that he's living I must decrease so that he can increase every single day we've got to take inventory and make sure as soon as we don't do it brothers and sisters we set ourselves back spiritually but how do we get back to him brother Adam says we can't do it through denominations we can't do it under psychology we can't do it under arithmetic or we can't do it with education we separate ourselves divide ourselves we're not divided We Are One person indeed in Christ Jesus we are all one in Christ and our denominations will never do it as good as they are they won't do it our education is the greatest hindrance the gospel has ever had is education what we need is not education we need the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost back in the church to demonstrate the power and I'm not saying this I I this is Barry speaking I'm not saying this to say that we need to speak in tongues we need to see Mighty signs and wonders in our midst brothers and sisters all of that will happen don't be alarmed if you see someone speak in tongues don't be alarmed if you see someone dance in the spirit don't be alarmed if you see someone start shouting or running when the Holy Spirit strikes a person when Jesus manifests in a human being you cannot stand still brother Branham says it you set a man on fire and see what happens to him in the in the upper room experience when they came out of the upper room they were acting around like they were drunk brothers and sisters how could we come to a service have the Holy Spirit strike us and just be quiet make any noise got to be quiet because we might upset Jesus if that's what's going on brothers and sisters I don't know if we have the right Jesus remember brother Adam says it too there's a lot of Jesus in the world even today there's a lot of Jesus in the world but there's only one Lord Jesus only one Lord Jesus and when he comes on the scene things change what we need we need the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost back in the church to demonstrate the power Jesus never said go into all the world and teach he never said go into all the world and do he said go into all the world and preach the gospel and the gospel is to demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost the resurrection I think that's such a beautiful thought because he doesn't say it's quotes he didn't say it's understanding all the scripture he didn't say it's a conception mentally it's not an understanding that we have through theological study it's not about that at all it's the demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost living out through our lives where your friends and family meet you and say who are you and what have you done with my brother or sister because the way you're acting is crazy he says we're still a million miles short than where we should be let us move forward let's get back to where we left him at the Feast of Pentecost wow that's a long ways back and I know brothers and sisters I would say this today we're not that far it's not that far here he was in 1960 crying out to the denominations but I would say here he is in 2013 crying out to his bride just get back to the word just let the word be your solid Focus just make sure that you take inventory every single day and that you've got me with you if you've got Jesus in your boat brothers and sisters it don't matter what kind of storm comes your way and remember that if you are a son and daughter of God he's got storms coming your way there's storms coming for us but they're not going to be able to drown us even though there will be a thousand hundred thousand devils in that water trying to flip the waves up on our boat we can be asleep resting peacefully in the back because we know who's in our boat John chapter 15 brother Brown talks about it in this message I am the vine and ye are the branches and he says that some are grafted in but if the vine ever puts forth another Branch we know the story if the vine ever puts forth another Branch they'll write a book of Acts behind it brothers and sisters and that's what we're talking about this morning the book of Acts that's that's really it's not the acts of of the Apostles which is what so many people will say it's the act of the Holy Ghost in the apostles and that's how they were preaching the gospel it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in in the apostles but if that vine ever puts forth another branch just go and preach it through the demonstration of your lives and then every once in a while you'll have to speak people will say what is it about you man you're so different you're you're I always just feel good when I'm around you something energizes when you come into the room you'll have people apologizing for swearing around you they'll just say oh I'm sorry and you'll scratch your head and say why'd you say that where did that come from how did why would you even apologize I never said anything to you it's because the spirit that's in them recognizes the spirit that's in you amen it's the life that we live brothers and sisters it's the essence of Who We Are I just love how brother Bradham says this in this message here and I just wish that I could shout it but I'm not gonna I'm just gonna say it and and he says we don't need a new denomination we don't need a new church building I love that we don't need a new church building brothers and sisters I want to say this we don't need a new church building even though maybe we're bursting at the seams let's burst at the seams let's let's blow the lid off of this place we don't need a new church building we don't need a new denomination what we need today is an old-time Backwoods sky blue sin killing Pentecostal Revival that was born at Pentecost and is back in the church again the power of the Holy Ghost to bring Jesus on the scene you know not not not a a a a quiet Canadian I'm Canadian I need to be quiet I have a Canadian culture about me and and I just can't do it you know what there's no culture in the Holy Ghost we don't want to say we got an African culture we don't have a Philippine culture we've got the culture of the Holy Ghost living in our lives and when he comes on the scene we act the same I don't know maybe I'm wrong about this I was thinking about it a while ago brothers and sisters but personally I don't think there's going to be skin color on the other side we're all going to be brothers and sisters of like Precious faith not that we're not right now but we don't have to worry about cultures if we've got cultures mixing in with what we do in church we're missing the point brothers and sisters we've got a hybrid religion and we better bury it brother Branham said if it's got no life in it because the spirit has life brother Branham says we need today we need to see a backwoods sky blue sin killing Pentecostal Revival I want to say this as I read this quote as I read this quote the inspiration behind this quote for me brothers and sisters was on a day like no other day that I've ever experienced in my life I I went out with our pastor and we went for a day where we were just gonna have a day of of of playing around with quad motorbikes and what happened was my pastor died that day I watched him die and and you might say you're crazy oh you know it couldn't have been that bad because he lived well you weren't there you didn't see it I saw it with my own two eyes I bear witness record of it and what happened brothers and sisters in that moment was I just went down to my knees and what did I do I I said to brother Wayne who was there I said we need to pray right now we both said at the same time and he reached over and he leaned and he just touched brother Ken and and I just went to my knees and I just looked up and I saw a blue sky The Bluest sky that I've ever seen and you know what we prayed Lord your servant needs a touch and not a brother Wayne's mouth your servant two words into it boom the power of God strikes the man and he jumps to his feet and we say no you've got to sit down just relax and brothers and sisters that's the acts of the Holy Ghost living out through the church and you know what I would say I don't think it was me I don't I can't say it was me I I would have to say it's all brother Wayne because he's been serving God longer and and he's probably a better Christian than me and he can preach better than me and he knows more quotes than me and he's probably got a better relationship with Jesus than me but you know what the word of God says he's the son of God just like you're a Son of God there's no difference if you believe you say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea it's not what some other person says if we make it that way then there's no hope for us brothers and sisters that's where we get denominational I don't say that to put myself anywhere other than hey you know what when we need to see the power of God in our lives we're going to see the power of God in our lives if you can believe us now this we're not talking about cunningly devised fables as brother Emmanuel mentioned when he preached on Wednesday this isn't a story of of of Santa Claus of someone that's like an Easter Bunny we're gonna hand out chocolates this is the power and resurrection of God Almighty living out through his church we don't need another denomination we don't need a new church building what we need today is an old-time backwards sky blue sin killing Pentecostal Revival and I'll tell you brothers and sisters that's my heart's desire for the Easter meetings here in Calgary Living Word is to see the Holy Ghost move in our church we don't want to stay in the same position that we were maybe some people wish that we would just be back where we were but that's not the way it works he wants us to grow he wants us to move we're marching on to Zion we're not standing still if we're standing still we're gonna get left behind and today brothers and sisters I'd say this he's raising people up man oh my and we find out brother Branham says when Jesus left death set in when Jesus leaves our church the power of the Holy Spirit leaves our church it begins to dwindle and die and after a while there's nothing more to it now when Jesus left death set in Oh What a Sad time it was and notice they wandered a boat and they sent for Jesus and he didn't come they sent for him again and he didn't come but he knowed that it was his going to do he know what he was going to do he knows tonight what he's going to do he's not lost with him he knows exactly what he's fixing to do and I would say this brothers and sisters he knows exactly what he's fixing to do right now in this service if you can believe us now this he's going to raise a people up just as certain as I'm standing in this Pulpit right here I'll say it just as certain as I'm standing in this puppet he will raise people for his namesake out of the Gentile generation he will do it he has to do it there has to be people to represent him here on Earth there has to be people that will go in a general Resurrection and a rapture there has to be people that will bear his name brother Adam he goes on to say now I can imagine that the little home was really broken up this is the home of Mary and Martha and Lazarus it was really broken up the breadwinner gone sadness oh it's wonderful when you got a sad home or a sad heart and then Jesus appears all at once isn't it Oh my he says I can imagine seeing Martha a beautiful little woman with a black veil over her face and and little Mary and them holding one another saying what do we do Papa and Mama's Gone and our precious brother now we have left the church and we're excommunicated from them and come out to follow Jesus of Nazareth and he's pulled away somewhere and left us can you imagine that story he says I can hear a Critic come by and say Hey where's that Divine healer that prophet of Galilee where is he at now see when it really comes to the time for him to do something he's gone he says there it is see God just loves to do that so if God feels gone brothers and sisters God just loves to do it he just loves to get us to the place where we've got nowhere to go but up but we're so far down the only thing that we can do is look up that's where he wants us to be brothers and sisters if we find ourselves in that circumstance you're right on track I want to tell you just to share as I'm standing here in this Pulpit you're right on track brothers and sisters we're not lost we're not far off no way this is what the prophet said oh my where is he now see when it really comes the time for him to do something he's gone there it is see God just loves to do that just let the people just let them show what they are yeah [Laughter] when it gets down to the Brass tax just let the people show what they are the Believers will show who are the Believers and the make-believers will show who are the make-believers and the unbelievers they'll just show it anyway but you know what all that can be shaken brothers and sisters will be shaken that's what the scripture says he says he's gone there it is see God just loves to do that just let the people just let the people show what they are yeah just trying them to see what they really are he gives them a blessing he appears shows himself introduces himself to the people just to see what kind of a reaction they'll take just to see what they'll do about it I just think it's amazing the way he brings it out in this message goes on to say I I said he went to the Grave weeping talking about who this Jesus really was he went to the Grave weeping as a man he went to the Grave weeping that's true enough but this is where I just it just does something to me when I read this when I think about it he was a man weeping for his friend and and to think about the compassion in Jesus because he still has that same compassion otherwise it's not Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Keystone of the Bible he says he he went to the Grave weeping that's true enough but when he's treating his little self up the Bible said there wasn't much to look upon him no beauty that we should desire him my but when he thrown them little shoulders back and said Lazarus come forth he says in a man that had been dead four days and rotten in the grave came forth that was more than a man show me the man that can do it what was it corruption knew its master and I can't help but think about that brothers and sisters when we hear this gospel preach to us when we hear the message of the hour that God sent a prophet corruption in your body knows its master you cannot stay the same person that you were corruption in your body knows its master there was more than a man show me a man that can do it what was it corruption knew its Master life knew its creator something had to happen he spoke and a man that was dead in the grave for four days raised his head and stood on his feet and he lived Hallelujah he said that was God in his son yes sir that was God making himself known through him son that was God speaking not a man my goodness pardon me you love him this morning that was more than a man the end of this message brother Branham he just goes on a little bit I'll call the musicians as we can wrap up a bit here he says that was more than a man and he says it over and over again at the end of this message he was more than a man when he looked around on that tree that one day for something to eat that was a man the Branham says but then when he took five biscuits and two fish and fed five thousand that was more than a man and when he laid in the back of that little boat that night and the Seas roaring and bouncing like a little bottle stopper out there on the Mighty Sea ten thousand Devils of the sea swore they would drown him that night he was a man weak and tired from praying for the sick laying back there and the wind didn't even disturb him he was a man when he was asleep oh my but when he woke up and he put his foot up on the Braille of the boat he looked up and said peace be still that was all God that was more than a man that was God in man making himself known that's right maybe stand with me this morning as we close he was a man at the cross when he cried for Mercy yes amen amen when he cried and said I thirst that was a man when he died he was a man but on Easter morning when he broke the seals of death hell and the grave and he rose again it was more than a man that was God made manifest brothers and sisters I want to say today that has to be something that we experience for ourselves that God has to manifest that way to us amen that we recognize that he died but he rose again and where is he today brothers and sisters take inventory I want to encourage us to take inventory every day to make sure that we haven't gone three days the wrong direction without him just assuming that he's in our boat because the moment that we leave without him we're in trouble the moment that he leaves we're in trouble and I just can't help but think brothers and sisters you know we had the examples brother Branham gave I want to give a couple that brother Branham actually experienced he said to the church I no longer call you Church I call you bride so that you'll understand what's going on and I want to say this that wasn't just a man that was speaking that was God that was God speaking through a man I'm not saying brother Branham was gone don't get me wrong I'm saying he was a prophet of God and a prophet of God is a mouthpiece of God he's the one that speaks on behalf of God and he's the one that said you are the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ how can that ever be in my flesh it never can be we talked about it a long time ago brothers and sisters he's not looking for a virgin in the flesh he's looking for a virgin in the womb he's looking for a virgin of his word one that will only take his word that will only accept his word there's only one thing that will take into my very soul and that's his word and he says it in the message of the hour that he's looking for a virgin of his word that's the only one that's the only way that we can be that sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ if you say to this mountain and do not doubt in your heart you shall have what she asks believe us thou this let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord you're so
