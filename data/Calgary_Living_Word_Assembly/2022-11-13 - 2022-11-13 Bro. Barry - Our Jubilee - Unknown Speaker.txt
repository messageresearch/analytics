certainly a wonderful song service you have your Bibles this morning I'd like to read from Leviticus chapter 25 I just can't help it brother Gilbert he got me inspired on Wednesday so I want to talk about Jubilee I want to talk about just any Jubilee I want to talk about our Jubilee today Leviticus chapter 25 sure enjoyed that service on Wednesday start reading with verse 8 and then I want to turn over to Revelations chapter 3. Leviticus 25 verse 8. and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then Thou shalt cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof and it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family let's turn over to Revelations chapter 3 the Joshua would you mind turning the monitors just down I'm getting an echo Revelations chapter 3 verse 19. very familiar scripture speaking about the laodicean church we know that the laodicean church age has basically come to an end and we're living in a new age maybe we're a new age Church my Revelations 3 verse 19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches chapter 4. verse 1. after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven in the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word thank you for your tender loving kindness to us father Lord Jesus we just ask that we could get out of the way father the here and the speaker and Lord that we could just all give you the preeminence this morning Father Lord that we could just be one today with you father that you would just speak to us that you would have your will and your way in this service Lord Jesus we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated certainly excited about the word and you know I I just can't I can't understand how we have a service like last week and how we're going to have a service this week and potentially meet or exceed last week I I don't know that baffles me last week was a pretty good service I felt but we certainly trust the Lord just have a few announcements before we get going here and I just wanted to uh thank everyone who came to the Men's breakfast yesterday that was a tremendous time and we'll certainly have more we just uh I wanted to touch on the calendar the calendar is out and uh a couple of high high level points I guess that we should talk about we're going to have a service on Christmas Day and uh I know that might be shocking for some people but maybe not for others and as I always say there's no pressure for anyone if you want to come come if you don't that's okay I would say this though um just be careful what traditions stand in your way we're not having service in the mid-week it's actually a Sunday and that's probably the only reason I'm doing it but if the creasers can do Christmas service what about the Bride of Jesus Christ so some people will come some people won't I'm not going to be upset do what you want to do it's got to be good for you so we're going to have service uh Christmas Day and we're gonna have a 31st Service as well it's a communion service I'm not going to plan to have a watch Night Service we'll get together and sing a few songs and have communion and then get on with our lives I mean we can probably have service until the next day but I don't really think that's uh something I want to do and maybe a little bit selfishly but it's true there won't be a service on the first which is a Sunday because we'll have a community service on the 31st but uh we will be going away on the first and we'll be gone until the 14th we're going to go and meet up with panettas in the Philippines and take a few services and I think it's not going to be just a few Services as I understand the itinerary is growing and we'll certainly just trust the Lord for that if we can be a blessing to be in his service we certainly want to so we're gonna have a Christmas service on the 25th we won't have a service on the first but we will have a 31st service and we're going to be away from the first to the 14th we'll make sure that we have Services lined up and and brethren in place for that The Men's breakfast as I mentioned was sure sure a good time yesterday thank you everyone who came out and and made it possible the only way it is a success is for participation and you know the food was really good we had three refills of food which was surprising they just kept bringing food and the fellowship was even better it was just a wonderful time if if I did miss anyone in the invitation list I do apologize and I certainly ask that you would just reach out to me and let me know that I missed you um because I don't want to miss you it was nothing intentional I just started to look at the list and wondered if I I missed anyone so if I did miss you it was just a mistake it's not anything personal please feel free to reach out to me so we can get you on that list we will have more meetings and just trust the Lord will bring us closer and closer together are you happy this morning you know I'm gonna just start with a quote today this is the Seal of the Antichrist we're talking about the Jubilee we're not talking about everyone's Jubilee we're talking about our Jubilee today this very day the present tense I am out of the Seal of the Antichrist in 1955. brother Branham says notice when the Jubilee sounded the man could drop his hoe and go home if he wished to but what if he didn't want to now what happened then they must take him down to the judges and the judges take him to the Post they pulled out his ear put it up against the post and board it through with an all and from that time on never no more it was a sign that he could never hear that Jubilee no more it was finished no matter how many jubilees he lived through he would never be able to do it again because he was marked because he rejected you know brothers and sisters talking about our day and its message our Jubilee sound when we come to a service and if we choose to reject what we hear if it's the truth then what's happening is something spiritual is happening to us we're getting it all poked in our spiritual ear and we're not going to be able to hear this message anymore we're going to find ourselves Frozen in time we're going to be stuck in a situation this is an example of what they did in the Old Testament days to the slaves that said hey you know what my master was good I love my master he treats me well he feeds me good there's a couple things that I don't like I don't like that whip that he puts on my back and I don't like the way he treats my wife and my children but you know the rest of it's good we get an education all the stuff that we need in our life is looked after they'll be stuck there they won't it doesn't matter how many more jubilees come along brother Branham says they were stuck in that position we don't ever want to be stuck in that position I just wanted to take a moment and reflect on sort of our discussion yesterday at uh at the Men's breakfast it was such a good time and we just sort of based it on on James 5 16. very familiar scripture confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and uh you know I just gave a little bit of an exhortation not long I just took a couple things out of that scripture that I thought were really interesting and you know the word fault to confess your fault one to another you know out of the strongs it's G 3900 it says a side slip a lapse or deviation that is unintentional error or willful transgression fall fault offense sin and trespass confess your faults one to another and pray one for the other that you may be healed but you know if we're not willing to confess our faults one to another how can we ever pray for one another and how could we ever expect to be healed if we're not confessing our faults one to another this isn't exclusive to the Brethren by the way this is just a scripture we took for the breakfast just to try and encourage some some spiritual Fellowship amongst the Brethren to recognize there is power behind the word of God and if we're willing to apply it the way we've been given it then we're going to see the results that we're Desiring but you know brother Branham says it's so good I don't think I'd ever heard it before I heard brother Branham say it to do the same thing over and over and over and over and over expecting a different result what's that it's the definition of insanity why would we want to do that we need to make sure that we're following the word of God in our lives and you know the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man a veileth much it's not like our prayers just go on out into space our prayers are valuable our prayers are powerful and you know I guarantee you if you haven't had a good prayer life and you start to pray Satan's going to fight you every single inch of that way but you have to go just a little bit further than what you think is far enough and so long as you're willing to go that much further what you will do is you will start to see success in your life you'll start to see victory in your life you'll start to see strength spiritually speaking in your life the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and effectual I thought was one word but I found out in the Strong's Concordance it's not listed as one word the definition is effectual fervent G 1754 to be active efficient to be effectual fervent be Mighty and show forth self-work effectually in to think about it if your brother or sister is willing to confess their faults unto you you have the ability to be effective and efficient in praying for that brother or that sister's specific need and when you do it availeth much that was what we were talking about yesterday it was so wonderful I'm just going to read the Amplified version of this sort of out of James 5 16 it says confess to one another Therefore your faults your slips your false steps your offenses your sins and pray also for one another that you may be healed and restored to a spiritual tone of mind and heart the earnest heartfelt continued prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available dynamic in its working this is what we talked about yesterday encouraging one another by the word understanding that we're all going to make side steps we're all going to make faults we're all going to have failures there's going to be problems in our lives but if we're willing to confess them and recognize that we've got issues and problems that we maybe we talked about yesterday that we can't overcome on our own when we actually are willing to ask for help someone can come on the scene and help us and the brother mentioned it yesterday it was so good remember Daniel he he actually he called for help and it took 21 days there was something hindering his prayer from getting there they heard it but he had to fight his way to get through to come and answer his prayer and that's the way it is for us brothers and sisters we sing the song about the the mountains and the valleys and you know how tremendous it is to have the Mountaintop experience but if you go and look at the top of the mountains there's nothing there there's rocks and snow that's it where's life life is down in The Valleys in the valley is where the fruit grows that's where the green stuff is that's where the life actually happens that's where the water is for the most part that's where we live is in The Valleys there isn't really a whole lot of Life on Top of the mountains though it's wonderful to be there we're living in an age brothers and sisters where I just can't help but think the Rapture is any day now imminent any day now and and if you wonder I've said it before I'll say it again today I just feel inspired too you know we can look around and see this world there's people with tattoos all over the place and I mean all over the place up their necks and up their arms there's piercings there's people actually getting body changes Desiring to change their bodies they're actually teaching body change in school now and parents don't have a right to say anything about it why is the world going that way it's the anointing for the age all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God and we can say here we are we've heard that Jubilee sound we know who we are and what we're raised up for but on Wednesday when brother Gilbert was preaching I just thought man there's something else a real interesting thought isn't it interesting that just the last I don't know what it is decade or two there's an ancestry search there's a desire to go back to see where we came from there's a desire to take a look back at where our DNA comes from where where we came from who our family really is sometimes it's it's joyous sometimes we can say maybe we're connected to royalty and other times oh my maybe we didn't want to know that we were connected to those people right it's like that but you know isn't that interesting because the natural types the spiritual is what we believe isn't it and doesn't that actually match what the profit for our day brought back in the 60s he was talking about the abstract title deed and understanding that if we came from God we'll go back to God and we can't be lost it's the anointing of the age it just became so clear to me Ah that's why they're doing it they can't help it they're breaking into God's laboratory thinking they're doing good for mankind and in some ways they are they can tell you've got to predisposed disposition something in your genes will actually allow something to come forward because of your family's history but that's the natural what about the spiritual we know that we heard it on Wednesday that he will visit the iniquity of the fathers on the third and the fourth generation many of the things that we contend with is not even our fault that's why we heard it yesterday to the brothers but to everybody we need to remember this the things we do today will affect tomorrow the things we do today might not even affect us in our family today it might affect our children it might affect our grandchildren the life that we live today it's amazing to think about we know that it doesn't take very long when we actually deviate from the word boy two generations down they won't even know God God will just be like a fairy tale to the children if we just deviate from the word even a little bit because we know just a little tiny deviation today is is setting a chorus for a Direction that's way off of our charts way off of the direction that we would want to go if you're going to shoot a gun just just to move just a little bit you know when snipers shoot their guns they actually time their breathing in between their shots they actually will time their shots in between their heartbeat that's how much you can't move it's got to be exact zeroed brother Branham talks about we know who we are and what we're raised up for and we're talking about our Jubilee today I just can't help but think that you know in Revelations chapter 3 as many as I love I rebuke can I chase him be zealous therefore and repent we've been given that Jubilee sound in our day in our age brother Branham he brought and taught the church ages the seven Church ages the revelation of the seven Church Ages which is Jesus Christ and and what it is is Jesus Christ throughout all of the ages all of the churches how he had a man raised up to manifest the word for the day we know the word always comes to a prophet and that word has come to the prophet in our day and we have taken that word and we have heard that sound and we have been willing to be rebuked and chastened and that causes us to be zealous we recognize he stands at the door and knocks If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him I won't just come into his house with him I will come into him and sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame it I'm sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches you've got ears this morning we're in the bible study this morning and I it was my my lot to take the the study and and I just really started into this this morning so I got a little bit of a warm-up I hope it's gonna be okay but isn't it interesting to look at this this isn't talking about having physical ears every single Church age the admonition he who hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith it's actually understand be able to recognize and to consciously take it in and consume it acknowledge it but then we go after having ears to hear Let Them hear what the spirit saith unto the churches what is that Spirit saying unto the churches verse 4 or first verse 1 of chapter four after this I looked and behold there was a door open in heaven and the first voice which I heard were as of a trumpet talking with me I just can't help but think you know once upon a time I thought that this verse here when you would hear a trumpet in an orchestra how sharp and and how true that sound is of a trumpet we know we've heard trumpets in many different applications but you know it's a similar sort of a thing to hear how sharp and true the voice of this trumpet is as we've read out of the Book of Leviticus in chapter 25 here recognizing that this trumpet sounded which was actually a voice it was a voice as of a trumpet talking with me inviting me to come a little higher we have been given that opportunity brothers and sisters through our Jubilee to come a little higher John was a type of the Bride he saw that door open in heaven and you know do we see a door open in heaven no I don't think we see a door open in heaven we see a cloud open in heaven we see an opportunity to see something different than all the rest of the world sees the rest of the world will say you know what that was just Mr Cloud that was just sunset Mountain it was just a neat event there was just something special that happened with a man of God but you know the Bride of Jesus Christ says no no there's way more to that picture than meets the eye that was actually a door open in heaven saying hey my little Bride come a little higher if you want to take a look at this you will see something that nobody else can see but you know only those who have ears to hear what the spirit sayeth unto the church can actually get what the spirit is actually saying he's speaking to the hearts of man you know I think it's beautiful we're gonna we're gonna get going here into uh into our thought today our Jubilee you know we're gonna take a little bit of a roundabout way to get there but I trust it'll be okay but if Harvest Time 1964. brother Branham he's talking about a raccoon and the behavior of a raccoon he says notice he tried his old tactic on Jesus same thing he did to Moses same thing he did to the rest of them he tried it he'll try it on you to get you to accept some great big something that looks shiny reminds me of when I used to hunt Coons just gonna pause there sort of the back story as he talks about it and we're familiar with this he says that Hollywood shines the gospel glows and this is sort of the context that he's talking from if we're looking for something shiny we're actually not going to get it because the gospel glows it doesn't shine it says reminds me of when I used to hunt Coons I I get me a papa daddy use tobacco I don't know whether you all ever knew of them old tags they used to be on a Twist of tobacco I would take that that get me a log and and bore a hole in it right around the creek where a had been running and then I'd bore a hole in there and stick his tobacco tag there and then drive me some Nails angling in like this and the Coon's always reaching for something shiny so when the moon come up and he run along there he looked back there and he pushed his hand in there to get it he says he won't turn it loose we heard someone say that recently I don't know if it was on Wednesday I don't know who said it maybe I heard it somewhere else about how a monkey will actually they'll catch monkeys by sticking their hand through a Board and they'll grab on to whatever it is the fruit or whatever on the other side of the board and they won't let go of it even when they hear the Hunter coming they won't let go of it here we have brother Brown I'm talking about raccoons and the same behavior he says he's like some church members even he knows he's caught he won't turn it loose if I do they'll put me out of the organization that's just his death that's all all right notice there when he holds on to it he won't turn loose brothers and sisters I want to say this today what are we holding on to is there anything in our lives that we're holding on to if there is let go of it the Hunter's coming he's going to get you if you don't let it go it's going to take you down but you can let it go brothers and sisters you can lay it on the altar you can call your brother or sister and say forgive me I've had this thing forgive me I've got this thing you can go to God and say it whatever you need to do you know what to do the spirit will tell you but are you going to be willing to hang on to whatever it is until the end or just let go just let go of it and be free hear that Jubilee trumpet blow in your ears and know that I don't have to hang on to nothing the only thing I've got to do is hold on to Christ and know that when you hold on to him you're not actually holding on to him at all he's holding on to you that's what that recognition is I heard a brother talking about raccoons in a sermon a while ago I heard it said that you know being at a national park in the states looking at a raccoon track in a national park and and traveling seeing that this this this ancient track is an ancient track it's not just a a fresh track it's an ancient track and that raccoons travel on this track and they have for centuries and the predictability of knowing that there will be a raccoon someone said that a raccoon will actually put his foot right there when that raccoon walks by here he's going to put his foot right there and isn't it interesting to look at this Satan's been watching human beings for six thousand years he's been seeing the iniquity of our fathers and our forefathers to the third and the fourth generation Satan knows our DNA makeup you can rest assured he's banking on us putting our foot right there knowing that thing that they just can't overcome they're going to do it again I'm going to come and tempt them we're going to get all the guns from Hell trained on them on that weak spot we're going to exploit it they're going to come and they're going to do it again they're going to put their foot right there they're not going to let go of that thing that's in their life they're not going to be willing to lay it down and just go and confess their fault one to another and pray for one another they'll be no they're Humanity their DNA all their fathers and forefathers all of that stuff the iniquity to the third and the fourth it'll they'll do it guaranteed they're going to do it so he sends out his army and they come after us and what do we do we go and put our foot there I'm speaking to myself here I put my foot there so many times and many times I put it right here but I'm hoping I'm not doing that right now but brothers and sisters we've got the ability to just let go of it and not put our foot there put your foot right beside it trick the devil don't be predictable be unpredictable we want to have a regular prayer life but I've heard this said and I think it's wonderful don't be a predictable prayer Warrior it's good to be predictable we want to know that we're consistent with our prayers and we're fervent effectually with our prayers but don't just have a very specific time or or or or or a day when we say our prayers because you can rest assured that Satan's going to come and try and interrupt you he's going to come around and try and kick the the legs out from underneath our stool he doesn't want us to spend time in prayer so what if we're unpredictable I'm just going to pull over on the side of the road here and instead of me going to do this thing I'm just going to go and pray maybe instead of doing this thing at home that I would normally do putting my foot there I'm just gonna stop I'm going to turn and go and do something different go to a different location maybe and I'm just going to go and pray I'm just going to go and remember that brother that that told me about his fault that confessed his fault to me and confidence and I'm going to go and pray for that I'm going to go to war for my brother or my sister be unpredictable to Satan don't be predictable to Satan but we can hear the Hunter coming brothers and sisters and what are we not willing to let go of it's real is it hurt in our lives we want to hold on to our hurt so long that the hunter can come and actually destroy us is it anger is it fear is it sadness these are all real things brother Branham talks about each one of these things being spirits are we willing to hang on to them to put out the welcome mat for Spirits in our lives that are contrary to the spirit of the Lord even anxiety say oh my I'm I'm so full of anxiety I just don't know what to do and and I just don't know where to go with it and so I go to my doctor and my doctor gives me a prescription and teaches me how to live with my anxiety brothers and sisters there is a Deliverance for anxiety and I can only say it by experience and that's the baptism of the Holy Spirit even though you're baptized with the Holy Spirit you can still have any one of these these these other spirits come around and try and get you to believe that you have them but you need to have the we need to have that confession in our lives that we don't own it it's a box of rattlesnakes and rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ because someone hurt me God's not going to say that's that's okay it's fine they hurt you really bad you hold on to that hurt and drag it around with you what you're doing is you're holding on to that that thing and your hand's stuck in the board man and the hunter is coming if you're anger angry with someone you've got to get rid of it and you know we can we can be free brothers and sisters because that Jubilee trumpet is sounded and you know if we choose not to heed that Jubilee trumpet and deal with it according to the way the word was given to us then what's going to happen to us spiritually speaking brothers and sisters if there's something in our lives we're holding on to what's going to happen is we're going to get that that bore whole whole board right in our ears and it's not going to be in our earlobe and it's not going to be in our eardrum it's going to be in our spiritual ear for those who have spiritual ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the churches that spiritual ear is going to go deaf and we'll be able to come to service we'll be able to go and worship around the word of God think that we're worshiping God but we're going to be frozen in time we're not going to be able to escape that thing that we're holding on to it's going to kill us but you know we speak better things to the Bride of Jesus Christ we've been given that Jubilee sound brothers and sisters we don't have to hold on to stuff we can be free out of the mark of the beast speaking about this hearing in 1961 brother Bradham says but if you hear the trumpet see hearing Faith cometh by what hearing now not just listening with your ear but if you hear that means understand it you accept it I hear you I believe it see it's hearing Stephen said you stiff-necked uncircumcised and hardened ears see uncircumcised they could hear it with their ears but uncircumcised they wouldn't believe it see uncircumcised in the heart and ears understand it oh it's all a mystery to me like Cain take it or leave it I brought my sacrifice just take it or leave it this is what I got just take it or leave it stiff-necked and uncircumcised that's what brother Branham was talking about going back to the call here before I get too far he says I joined church and that's as good as I can do all right King yo Mark it with the Beast and go right off in your denomination remember brother Ken preached it many times you can have a denomination of one you can have your own belief structure and say God bless you I know I've got the Revelation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and and have something else that's not actually according to the word it becomes a denomination any deviation from the word of God according to the day that we live in the word that was given to us through the prophet of Malachi 4 becomes a denomination well the bottom says but you can come to Christ and be sealed by the Holy Ghost you can take your choice now watch you hear that gospel Trump what is the gospel trumpet the good news the Holy Ghost is here how do you know it is watch it work Watch what it does it's the good news we've been given that brothers and sisters the Jubilee trumpet is the Holy Ghost and I just love to hear how brother Barnum says that because there's times where I felt like maybe I was overdoing it talking about the Holy Ghost and I know people have even gotten upset about me talking about the Holy Ghost is that all he's going to talk about well that's all there is to talk about we can talk about many different things but brothers and sisters if we don't got the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're not actually hearing with these years that were given to the church to hear with we have to be able to have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives to be able to understand what we're talking about goes on to say now what if this man said chopping talking about a Slave Jubilee trumpets gone and this this guy's chopping wood for his master now what if this man was chopping said well I don't believe I want to go oh to turn it down what what did they do they took his master then had to take him down to the Methodist to the Baptist Pentecostal or Presbyterian Church I love the way brother Bradham brings this to real life he brings it right down and you know brothers and sisters I would even go so far as to say the message church and it's just making me vibrate saying that and I don't mean it in terms of the message just being a denomination because the message will never denominate the true message which is Christ but there's people that try and get around the word of God the the word of God for their day and say quick we got to protect it now we've seen the move of God in our lives we just need to protect it and if you do it the way that we do it then you'll have success in your lives the only way that you can do it brothers and sisters to have success in your lives is according to the word of God the way brother Branham brought it if you try and do anything else then you are moving into denominational Waters and I would say whatever you want to call that we'll put it in here with this he says to turn it down what do they do they took his master then had to take him down to the Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian church and take him up to the wall stick his ear up against the wall and take an awl and bore a hole through his ear and marked him and never was he free no more and if you hear the the truth and turn away from it then your ear is stopped and you'll never hear it no more you'll go out from the presence of God saying my mother was Presbyterian I'm just as good as all the rest of them your mother lived in all the light she had but that ain't you that's right Caiaphas lived in all the light he knew but Jesus was on Earth at that time all them Orthodox believers they had their greats and organizations denominations and everything they walked in all the light they had but the light was right before them but they were stiff-necked uncircumcised in heart and ears didn't want to do it then God sealed them in their doomed doomed him right there in Jerusalem and died and went to hell he said that's right take your choice that's where we're at brothers and sisters we need to make sure if we have heard that gospel trumpet that we just accepted and we say hey maybe I don't understand it but I believe it don't look at man Look Away to Jesus brothers and sisters and brother Bradham talks about that in Look Away to Jesus at the very end of it I believe it is he says don't look at a pastor don't look at a man don't look at a brother or a sister look at Christ if you get caught up look at it a man thinking a man's Gonna Save You God's going to make that man fail to prove to you that no man will ever save you it's only going to be Christ he won't share his glory with nobody watch a great ministry great Ministries that rise up you know what happens they fall God allows it to happen the only reason is people start to actually put that Ministry on a pedestal it's not the right thing to do believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be filled with the Holy Ghost he says be filled with his Spirit your lamps trimmed and clear we've heard that gospel trumpet brothers and sisters we can be free we don't have to worry about holding on to things in our lives we can just lay it down we can just let it go and we can just go to where we've heard that gospel trumpet sound and it doesn't matter whether it's been a day a week a year a decade A Century of things in our lives that we've got bundled up we can just let it go that's what he's asking us to do is let go of all of our thinking all of our teaching all of our things in our lives that maybe we think makes us up of who we are just let it go and accept that gospel trumpet brother Branham says that you can't be neutral about it and you can't be neutral about it you can't say I just choose not to choose because you've made a choice not to choose to do that to say that I'm just going to stay right where I'm at you've chosen we've made a choice we can't just go and sit in neutral and idle that's not going to happen not in the spiritual world and we know that doesn't happen in creation there's no animal that can say I just don't feel like getting up and eating today they'll die no plant can just stay exactly the same exactly the same it's either growing or it's dying that's the way this world has been created we as humans as the Bride of Jesus Christ we're either growing into Perfection or we're slowly dying a slow death you can't be neutral Oneness of unity 1958. he says you can't set neutral the Bible said in this day that every man that wasn't sealed with the Holy Ghost would have the mark of the beast what is the mark of the beast unbelief and you know we've talked about this in the past I'll just say it again to stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance how do we just get the mark of the beast because we're born in sin we're shaped in iniquity we come into this world speaking Lies We Are Born outside of the way that we're supposed to be in this world we are supposed to be spoken word Sons and Daughters of God but we come into this world by passing our theophonies in a position where we've already sinned even though we haven't sinned our parents did that's how we got here right born in sin shaped in iniquity you come into the world speaking lies doesn't matter what we do how good of people we are we're already there and so we are given the opportunity in our lives to accept the Holy Ghost In Our Lives which is the Seal of God which trumps all of our past sins we know we heard it yesterday it throws all of our sin and the Sea of God's forgetfulness and that's what we're all after but if we choose to not accept that ceiling brothers and sisters you're choosing the mark of the beast many people today are looking for a uh some kind of a mark in the forehand or the or the head and some kind of vaccine some kind of natural identification brothers and sisters if we see a natural mark of the beast we've missed it because the bride ain't going to be here for that but my goodness the mark of the beast is actually the opposite of receiving the Holy Ghost in our lives and that's why I can't help but cry out for it just like Noah cried out get in the boat it's going to rain brothers and sisters it's going to rain fire get the Holy Ghost in your life know where you stand you can't set neutral the Bible said in this day that every man wasn't sealed with the Holy Ghost would have the mark of the beast what is the mark of the beast unbelief don't you know if your pastors has taught you in the Old Testament when the trumpet sounded if the man wanted to go free he could go free if you want to go three brothers and sisters you can go free it doesn't matter how complex your problem is today I'm telling you spiritually speaking you can go free doesn't matter how many sins you've created in your life you can go free doesn't matter how complicated or mixed up things can seem it's possible for you to be free if your pastor has taught you the Old Testament when the trumpet sounded if the man wanted to go free he could go free if he didn't he walked out to the post and had an all board through his ear because he refused to go free and if you refuse to go free then you'll serve that Taskmaster whatever that is the rest of your days and your lust brothers and sisters just accept the way that God has given it to us my goodness I hope it's not too much I've got so many quotes I think I'm going to have to start jumping quotes here maybe we'll get a couple more in are we okay today the mark of the beast marries belief all that didn't receive the Seal of God got the mark of the beast you know what the mark of the beast was to reject the Seal of God and I just want to say it today to reject the Holy Ghost when you hear a pastor somewhere say get the Holy Ghost when you reject that brothers and sisters when there's resistance in you what you're doing is you're accepting the mark of the beast there needs to be red flags going off all over the place and and I just want to hope that maybe we can take someone that's maybe in that position and shake them and and slap them and give them the ability to hear this because if you don't hear this you're going to be lost forever brothers and sisters all that didn't receive the Seal of God got the mark of the beast you know what the mark of the beast was to reject the Seal of God in the Old Testament when the trumpet sounded the priest sounded the trumpet if a slave did not want to go free he had to be sealed bored in his ear with an all then he was a slave the rest of his days but Faith cometh by hearing brothers and sisters if you don't hear it and receive it then you're marked on the other side then you can't come in he says let's start tonight and in a Revival and open our hearts to the Holy Spirit while our hour is here I I don't know I I'm sorry I just feel like I got so inspired by this I just don't want to keep reading quotes on and on and on because I think it can become a bit much I know out of the choosing of the Bride I think it's about to to change here we're going to change gears so out of the choosing of a bride 1965 brother Branham says remember when the Jubilee year came and the priest rode with his trumpet sounding that every slave could go free but if they refuse to accept their freedom they had to be taken to the temple post and all board threw him in the ear then he served his master always and it's put on his ear as a type of hearing Faith cometh by hearing he heard the trumpet but he didn't want to listen to it how many times men and women hear God's truth and see it Vindicated and proven truth but yet they don't want to hear it there's some other reason some other choosing that they have than to face up to the truth and facts therefore their ears can be closed to the gospel they'll never hear it again and that's not to say brothers and sisters you can go to church you can hear our words we can hear our voices right we're hearing with our ears naturally speaking but remember we said he that hath an ear he that hath a spiritual ear we know the story in Isaiah speak to these bones Isaiah that they may hear and how many of those bones had ears ears are sinew and Flesh and Blood right we're not talking about natural ears here brother Branham says they'll be closed to the gospel they'll never hear it again my advice to you seventh angel messenger my advice to you when God speaks to your heart you act right then he says Elijah gave them a choice which they should choose you this day whom ye shall serve if God be God serve him but if Baal be God serve him and you know that same Elijah spoke those same words today brothers and sisters to refuse the baptism of the Holy Ghost to resist the Seal of God in our lives is to automatically accept the mark of the beast so choose ye this day whom ye shall serve you know what that Jubilee has sounded we know Revelations 10 7 Malachi 4 5 and 6 Luke 17 30 Luke 4 19. I want to go there to Luke 4 19 if you don't mind turning there brothers and sisters it needs to be for us present tense this day today alive start with 16. Luke 4. Jesus coming into the temple and he came to Nazareth this is Luke Luke 4 verse 16 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up as it was his custom he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for it to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book where he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised in verse 19 to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears this scripture we know is a direct reference to Isaiah 61. Isaiah 61 reads the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and to the opening of the prison to them that are bound you know in this day when Jesus the unlearned call it ignorant man son of Mary and Joseph here he was in the synagogue and they knew there was something special about this boy about this man so they gave him the book they gave him the scroll and said teach us Master speak to us we want to hear from you today what do you have isn't it wonderful that he would sit down and proclaim the Year of Jubilee to them Christ himself bringing them Jubilee to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and we know in Luke the scripture we just read he closed the book and he gave it back to them that's the first half of Isaiah 61 verse 2 the second half we know full well brother Branham brought out which the rest of the world didn't have and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn and that dovetails with Malachi 4 5 and 6 there will be a day that shall burn as an oven and they shall be stubble we know that's what he was talking about but that wasn't the day that he was in he was there blowing the Jubilee trumpet saying hey just pick up your cross and follow me if you're willing to accept me the way that I've come then you will be saved you and your house can be saved and it's the same for us today he has come and he hasn't actually given us the second half of Isaiah 61 verse 2 but we know that day is coming and it's never been sooner but the bride is out of here when that day comes you know brothers and sisters we have the opportunity to actually take and hear that gospel trumpet there's so much in the scripture that points to our day you know brother Bradham says that we should be able to see Christ from Genesis to Revelation in every single scripture and if we don't see it we need to stop go back and read it again until we actually get there and we should be able to also see the seventh seal being open in every single scripture he says that as well for some people it's only six seals and that's a troubling thing that's a problematic thing because you suddenly don't have ears to hear what the spirit says under the churches because if you listen past the seals brother Branham refers to them seals being open it's not just six it's all seven of them we have the total revelation of Jesus Christ given to us but you can come higher brothers and sisters we can be sealed we don't have to worry about being slaves and stuck in bondage not willing to let go of the things I'm only saying that just to lay down a foundation because like we heard on Wednesday it was so beautiful we talked about the iniquity but then we talked about righteousness and this morning we can talk about being slaves and stuck in bondage not letting go of stuff we can also recognize that we're not there that's not where we swim that's not where we soar we are in the heavenlies as Eagles you can come higher and be sealed out of the Easter seal God gave Abraham a promise Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness but he sealed the Covenant by the Seal of circumcision and God gives you a promise potentially that you will receive it and you're going to be raised up this body is going to be glorified with him at the end time I'm just going to pause there for a second something hit me astounding this week and I don't know if I talked about it on Wednesday forgive me um I'm just like a kid in a candy shop with the message and the word it's just wonderful did you ever think about it just stop and think about what it's going to be like when we get over on the other side how there's going to be a thousand years there's going to be a thousand years and we're going to be there for a thousand years I heard somebody say it I never really looked at it this way is that we see 2022 as the date that we live in today but you know what it's going to continue there's still going to be a space of time for a thousand years it's measured time so what is it going to be how far into the future are we going to be logging time 20 20 40 2080 3010 how far are we going to go into the future I don't know it's an interesting thought but what I was thinking about which I find the most fascinating isn't it wonderful to think that God allowed Satan to creep into the Garden of Eden in the very beginning and take his bride take Adam's bride that one that came from his side and actually defile her but then God waited gave Satan 6 000 years you can go ahead and create your Eden and do whatever you need to do through your perversion because you can't create but make your Eden and I will go and take a bride of my own choosing and she will not refuse my voice she will say Amen just like Mary said to that angel messenger that came unto her but isn't it interesting that he's not just gonna actually say I won and that's it what he's going to do is openly display her made her before Satan for a thousand years to show his victory for a thousand years to show Satan every single one of those Thousand Days oh my it's not even a thousand days how many days is that I don't even know times it by 365. that's amazing that many days to show Satan I am victorious and you lust you lust because the Bible says that Satan is going to be bound for a thousand years with chains right but the prophet for our day he said he's not going to be bound with chains physical chains the denominations will teach you it's physical change when he's going to be bound with his chains of circumstance she is going to be the sinless Spotless bride of Jesus Christ that she is here over there she's going to be able to stand in the face of Satan and say uh-uh not this time you cannot touch me or my children or my wife or my husband or my church you have no power all of your power has been taken from you for a thousand years that's the God we serve that's such a tremendous thought I just can't get over that thought to think that's what he's going to do he's going to parade his bride in front of Satan for a thousand years just to show there's going to be people that will be able to be tempted but not the bride not the Bride of Jesus Christ brother Brown goes on is quote here and he says God gives you a promise potentially that you and you will receive it and you're going to be raised up this body is going to be glorified with him at the end time but you see you have to get clearance on that deed and the clearance is when everything against it has been stricken off and you've got the abstract to it you've got the seal and remember when we get that seal it's the earnest it's the down payment on our Resurrection it's him coming back to show us that there's nothing that can shake you from this seal because you're sealed until the day of your Redemption not till tomorrow not till the next time you fall not till the next time something happens in your life no no no no that's denominational teaching that's a lie of the devil if you've ever received this seal brothers and sisters there's nothing that can change you from that you can never be shaken from that seal it's a glorified body he says but you see you have to get clearance on that deed you've got to get the clearance you've got to be able to hear that voice and when you can hear that voice something inside you says amen when that amen happens brothers and sisters the spiritual conception takes a hold and you will no longer ever be able to be bored in the ear because you've said so long sucker to your former master I am not sticking around you I'm throwing down my hoe I don't have to worry about all of this slavery that I was born into it wasn't my fault it was my my grandfathers my uncles my aunts whose ever it was it wasn't me laughs sorry he says but you see you have to get a clearance on that deed and the clearance is when everything against it has been stricken off and you got the abstract to it you got the seal it's yours everything's on it belongs to you amen and when we believe on Jesus Christ for our savior and repent and are baptized and come up to believe him God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards him and sends down the abstract and the abstract is the Assurance it's the guarantee that everything was ever held against you you thoroughly repented Hallelujah and the property is bottom and you hold the abstract for the assurance isn't that wonderful to think that he he sends it to you but first you've got to be completely sold out and we know that you'll never Bluff God and you'll never Bluff Satan you'll never Bluff either one of them but you know Satan will always try and Bluff us and make us think that we've got the Holy Ghost when we don't and then make us think that we don't have it when we do he's just going to come and try and mess our minds but if we can ground ourselves in the word brothers and sisters that spirit will never have any power over us because brother Branham goes on to say let somebody try to push you off the land and say he belongs and with the abstract in your hands when you're holding that abstract let Satan come around and say nope you don't have the token in your hands you can turn around and say no but I do have the token in my hands I can receive the word for my day I have heard that Jubilee sound let somebody try to put you off the land say he belongs and you with the abstract in your hands let them try to do it there there ain't a law and the land can do it because you hold the abstract there's no devil no church no theology that can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and Abstract the baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized us in Christ Jesus we're just as sure to raise as he raised because potentially we have already raised in him amen the whole thing what does it do to our mortal bodies it turns our opinion we let go of things it turns our opinion it just changes our Notions it sets our affections on things which are above and the smoking drinking gambling things that you used to do is dead it's beneath you and you're quickened and this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already not someday gonna be brothers and sisters it brings us to that raptured condition already and the only thing that does it is just by saying Amen to the word but when we refuse the word what are we refusing I just can't help but think brothers and sisters you ain't refusing brother Barry you ain't refusing whoever that minister is if they're on the word you're refusing God careful just can't help but think it's time to just should we put it in second gear and just like floor it hopefully we got the traction control on oh my Lord have mercy it's just wonderful I just can't help but think brothers and sisters there's people in the Bible in our day that maybe not in our day story in the Bible days that that actually did hear that Jubilee sound when it came through the land and just speaking about Jesus we still got 20 minutes or so I just can't help but think there's a few that that really were just really good examples of people in the Bible that when the Jubilee sound was going through the land they heard it and nothing was going to shake them from getting their blessing nothing was going to shake them from receiving the full benefit of that Jubilee sound when it came and you know the first one I want to talk about this morning is is in Luke 18 and I'll just read it for the sake of time and it came to pass that as he was come night unto Jericho speaking of Jesus a certain blind man Sat by the wayside begging and hearing the multitude passed by asked what it meant what's going on and what was going on brothers and sisters the Jubilee trumpet was sounding for him and and as the multitude passed by yes what it meant and and they told him it's Jesus of Nazareth passeth by and what did he do brothers and sisters he cried saying Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and we know that they rebuked him they stopped him they said be quiet you don't want to disturb the master brother Branham says how did he know he was the son of David how did he know that brothers and sisters he had years to hear what the spirit saith unto the church and when that Jubilee trumpet sounded he responded to it and he didn't care what anyone was thinking he wasn't worried about the deacons at the door he wasn't worried about the person sitting beside him he wasn't worried about his family around him he said Amen to that I'm going to get me some of that Jubilee sound Oh my he says in 39 and they which went before rebuked him that they should hold his peace but he cried much thou the much more thou son of David have mercy on me didn't care what anybody was thinking or what they said he was willing to confess his fault he knew he was blind and Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him my goodness I just can't help but think brothers and sisters when we have the opportunity cry out to Jesus if it's in a song service cry out to Jesus if we're in prayer on our knees and he brings something to our remembrance cry out to Jesus he will come Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him saying What wilt thou that I should do unto thee Oh My can you imagine having him say that unto you that happens every time we come to church brothers and sisters if you're willing to take that Jubilee sound and Jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying God and all the people when they saw it they gave praise unto God next one is the maniac of Galleria Luke 8 26 and when they arrived at the country of the gadarians which is over against Galilee and he went forth to land there he met out of the city a certain man which had Devils a long time and wear no clothes neither a boat at any house but in the tombs when he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down before him with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou Son of God the most high I beseech thee torment me not and we know this was the devil speaking out to him and wasn't it interesting that back in that day the most religious people couldn't recognize the word when it was made flesh and manifest amongst them walked amongst them they couldn't recognize the word when he came to them but the Devils did the Devils recognized it verse 29 for he had commanded the unclean Spirit to come out of the man for off times it had caught him and when he was kept bound with chains and Fetters he break the bands and was driven out of the devil Into the Wilderness and Jesus asked him saying what is thy name and he said Legion because many Devils were entered into him and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep and we know there was a herd of swine there on feeding on the mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them and he suffered them and he went then went the Devils out of excuse me the man and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep Place into the lake and were choked isn't this story interesting that Jubilee sound came to him he didn't come to the Jubilee sound it came to him and when Jesus brought that sound to him what did he do he corrected everything he healed the Brokenhearted he set at captive set that Liberty the captive the guy that was bound in the Fetters those people who were living in sin those people who were the swine herders in the land of Israel dealing with unclean animals what did he do he fixed their lives as well and and they didn't like it the way that he fixed their lives but he brought Jubilee to all of their lives all at the same time delivered all of them of the devils but they just didn't want that Jubilee sound did they and we know the end of this they actually came and and they said we don't want you around here you got to get out of here you just destroyed our income as we live in sin and and this man this crazy stuff we don't want any of this crazy stuff around here you know where there's Holy Ghost is there's liberty where the spirit of God is brothers and sisters it's not going to be a quiet time it's not going to be a time of of just being silent and and and steady and easy as we go when the Holy Ghost comes around it's actually a little bit Wild you know another one someone who actually recognized that Jubilee sound as it came in in their day is that woman with the blood issue out of Luke chapter 8 and we know this story really well this woman she had the blood issue for 12 years and she'd spent all of her money with all of the doctors looking for all of the man-made solutions for her problems and God many times he likes us to get exactly right there doesn't he we talked about it last week in the three Hebrew kids that were not gonna bow down to any image of man they weren't interested in it and they said you know what we're we're Believers here we don't have to worry about this business if you want us to Bow Down and Worship another God because our God will deliver us and it doesn't matter whether he burns Us in the fiery furnace or whether we actually survive it it doesn't matter this woman had gone through everything just like those three Hebrew kids she had tried it all and she was at the end and she heard this gospel trumpet going past her way and we know the story where she got into the press and while she was in the Press that's where she said you know what I don't care what anybody says and and we know that she would have got in big trouble if anybody saw her actually approaching a man you cannot do that especially under Hebrew law if you have a blood condition as a woman you have to go through the purification process but to touch a random man is completely outside of everything but you know she didn't care she recognized something about this man he had a voice she had ears to hear what was happening in her day and it was just that little Act of Faith reaching out and touching the Hem of His Garment and what did it do it stopped him in his tracks and he said hold on a second wait a second I sense that virtue has gone out of me virtue has actually gone from me and we know virtue is strength virtue has gone out of me and we know that the the brothers that were there they said Master what are you talking about there's a hundred people around you pressing against you how could you sense anybody touched you and he said no no everybody else isn't doing what that was that was totally different and he turned around and he found that woman right he found that woman who had that blood issue for 12 years who had tried every single man-made technique to try and fix it but she recognized something different was about this man and he said woman thy faith hath healed thee you can take this and you can go your way because thy faith hath made thee whole all of the man-made techniques aren't going to solve it today but I'll tell you what I will solve it because I've got the Jubilee trumpet and you can go free today she was willing to let go of all that she thought that she knew she thought that maybe she knew how to behave in church and what a church service should be right but she was willing to say you know what I don't care if they throw me out I don't care whatever anybody thinks I'm getting me some I am going to get my Jubilee today and because she did that she was healed what a tremendous thing you know there was there was another one another one which is so good I just can't help but think about these examples these are all examples of that Jubilee trumpet sounding and that was for a purpose brothers and sisters every single one of them is for a purpose you know the pool of Bethesda another real familiar story a certain man which was there had an infirmity 38 years 38 years with an infirmity still holding on to his religion believing that if he could just get down in that pool when the angel comes and stirs the waters when when when that special time that magical time happens if he could just get down there just one time and touch that water oh he would be made whole but every time he would try someone would jump in front of him brothers and sisters we don't live in a case like that today when the waters start to stir brothers and sisters all you have to do is just Reach Out And Touch those Waters just Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes by and I guarantee you you won't be the same right that impotent Man by the pool of Bethesda he was there 38 years hanging on to his religion and when Jesus came by Jesus came by specifically he saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time in that case and he said to him wilt thou be made whole what a thought that was against every single fiber of his religion his religion was if I get down in that water there then I'll be healed but here we have the master comes by his way and says will you be made whole that Jubilee trumpet was sounding will you be made whole the impotent man he answered him saying sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me in the pool he's still thinking about his religion his natural way this is the only thing that I I have any conscious recognition of I have no man when the water is troubled to put me in the pool but while I'm coming another one stepth down before me Jesus saith unto him rise up take up thy bed and walk rise up take up thy bed and walk and we know immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked oh but was what was so immediate right after that brothers and sisters the Believers came around and said oh it's a Sunday you can't heal on a Sunday you can't do something servile work on a Sabbath how could you do that you must be a sinner it was the Jubilee trumpet showing that there was freedom and you're no longer bound by slavery you're no longer bound by all of the things that you think that you were Bound by you know most of the times when we have fear in our lives it's just it's just an illusion it's not even real in our lives but it's what the devil uses to try and psych us out to try and make us afraid to try and make us believe that it's real it's not real at all I don't know who said it but I know it's a famous saying is the only thing we need to fear is fear itself but fear is a spirit brothers and sisters we haven't received the spirit upon us again to fear we've received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father we recognize who we are we don't have to be a slave we don't have to have our ears bored we don't have to be able to Just Surrender Our Lives to anyone we can actually recognize that there is a jubilee trumpet sound for us today and that is the message of the hour that's Revelations 10 7. but you know it doesn't just stop there there's 8 to 11 we need to take that little book and eat it up we have to do that brothers and sisters we've got to be willing to do that if we don't then that spirit that we're given will actually starve in our lives we've got to eat the book we heard it on Wednesday night a chapter in the morning and a chapter at night maybe it's two chapters throughout the day but there's something special about when you wake up the very first thing in our lives is to read the word of God and then when we go to sleep the last thing we think about is the word of God something about that how many impotent people do we have in our lives how many times have we been that impotent man I just can't move I just can't get to the waters I know that I've got this need but I just can't get there you know what brothers and sisters many times we hear people say that too I can never live it you know what you will never live it and you'll never get there the only thing you've got to do is just accept that trumpet sound when it comes in your ears if you're willing to do that you're actually going to be saved the last one that I want to get to which I think is so good because it's just at the end of Jesus life to there was two men on the cross crucified with Jesus wasn't there they're both male factors they were both guilty and the one in the middle he wasn't guilty but there was one that said come on why don't you save us imagine how they must have cried out in pain oh can't you save us you're the the Son of God the most high just just get us down off this cross come on man when you're saving yourself save me too and you know the other one he heard that Jubilee sound and in his very last breath he was saying you know that man is an innocent man and you know we're both guilty and we both deserve what we're getting right now and brothers and sisters that's the place we need to get to as Believers we need to recognize that we are male factors born in sin shaped in iniquity come in this world's vegan lives we've got to be saved but if we're willing to accept that gospel Jubilee sound in our ears that's come the way it came in our day than we too will be saved because we know that Jesus said hey you know what this guy here he actually is righteous you will be with me in Paradise today but this other one I don't know about him I can't say much for him but what a wonderful thought to think that that man was actually given the ability to hear the gospel trumpet that Jubilee sound I'll just read this here verse 39 and one of the male factors which were hanged on railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself on us but the other answering rebuked him saying thus not thou fear God seeing Thou Art in the same condemnation and indeed justly for we received the due reward of our Deeds but this man hath done nothing to miss and he said unto Jesus the Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise brothers and sisters I'm just going to stop there I'll just invite the musicians today I just want to encourage every one of us not to hold on to anything don't let there be anything that we're holding on to except for this word this message of the hour if there's anything in our life that we're holding on to it's going to destroy us that's what will happen to us it will destroy us it doesn't matter what it is it doesn't matter how it's happened if we're holding on to anything except for this word it's going to destroy us taking a look at these examples that we gave maybe stand with me this morning as we close taking a look at the examples that we've given the the the one on the cross the male Factor the pool of Bethesda the woman with the blood issue the maniac of Galleria all of these people all of their problems the blind man that cried out oh thou son of David have mercy upon me isn't it interesting that every single one of them received a body change something in their body was changed today brothers and sisters we're looking for a body change the whole entire world is looking for a body change but we're looking for the right one and the only way we're going to get that body change that we're looking for is by this word let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus today we just love you we thank you for your goodness to us Lord we thank you for this word father I pray that not one of us would have our Our Gospel ears bored with an owl father I pray that every one of us Lord Jesus would let go of the things that so easily beset us father Lord Jesus we know that Satan will allow things to happen in our lives we know you will allow Satan to allow things to happen in our lives to bring things out father that need to be brought out from undercover when we have problems in our lives it's because you've allowed it to actually manifest to show us there's something more to deal with and father this morning I pray that Lord even though we long to soar in the mountaintops father we know that life is in the valley and father we pray that Lord Jesus when you come by our way that you would see fig trees full of figs Lord Jesus that you wouldn't see a fig tree that's just barren father we pray that you would just allow us to accept the word that you've given to us father in our day entirely Lord without reservations father Lord let us not hold on to any past issues or problems but just to move on with you father and allow you to live out through US father we pray that you would bless your children today Father we just ask that you would be with Lord Brother Sam's family brother Shepard and sister Sharon Lord Jesus wherever they are father we just ask that you would bless them abundantly father Lord we just love the body of Jesus Christ we love our our family that you've given us father when we pray that you would just go with each one of us as we go our separate ways Lord until we meet again father if it be here will for us to meet again on Wednesday Lord we'll be careful to come and just give you all the glory we love you we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen when the role is Called Up Yonder when the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more and the morning breaks Eternal pride and fear when the saved of Earth Shall Gather over on the other Shore When the Roll is Called Up Yonder I'll be there we're on the road is called up young
