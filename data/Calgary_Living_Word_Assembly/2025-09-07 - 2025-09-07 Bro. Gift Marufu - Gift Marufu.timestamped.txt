[47:48] our seats for a few moments and uh I'll
[47:51] just get the musicians to uh
[47:54] um
[47:56] How many are happy to be in the house of
[47:58] the Lord?
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I uh just wanted to do uh say a
[48:03] few things here before we get going. Um
[48:06] we are just so happy to be with you
[48:08] again. Uh you know each day that passes,
[48:12] it takes the grace of God for us to uh
[48:16] breathe this breath of life, young and
[48:19] old alike. And so we don't take life.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. just seems like several months ago
[48:25] we were here and the Lord has brought us
[48:28] here again to be with you. So I say God
[48:31] bless you and uh not only God bless you
[48:34] uh but but I say shalom to you
[48:38] &gt;&gt; and and shalom means more than just
[48:42] peace.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; It means good tidings to you.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; It means let the sun shine upon you. the
[48:50] S O N.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; So, we bring you greetings from uh
[48:53] Zambia uh from our pastor, brother
[48:56] Ronica Pisha, uh and his wife, Sister
[48:59] Deborah. Uh they've been uh here before
[49:03] and um when brother Ken was still here
[49:07] uh and they preached in this uh
[49:09] congregation. So, we thank the Lord.
[49:11] They are still um soldiering on and they
[49:14] said, "Wherever you go, uh make sure you
[49:17] say a big hello to the saints." And uh
[49:20] we are thankful for uh our pastor here,
[49:23] brother uh Barry uh for always having
[49:26] open door for us. Um I know he's with
[49:30] brother Wayne Lawson this morning. Uh
[49:32] but he says to take our liberty. Uh and
[49:36] uh I see we are in very good hands. We
[49:38] have elders here. Brother Paul, uh thank
[49:40] you for the wonderful song service and
[49:42] sister Len. Um, you know, we've been in
[49:45] touch with uh brother Emanuel
[49:48] um and uh brother Maven there uh and and
[49:52] and and others. Uh you're just a
[49:56] wonderful group of people.
[49:58] Thank you for uh um allowing us to be uh
[50:02] with you uh today and uh brother John
[50:05] there made us uh feel really welcome. So
[50:08] we thank the Lord for you and um this
[50:11] morning um uh I just want to encourage
[50:14] the church
[50:16] &gt;&gt; uh you know this message uh uh doesn't
[50:19] down on the believer. This message
[50:22] supposed to lift the believer up.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; We we're not in a time where we shove
[50:28] each other down. Uh this message has
[50:31] especially the time that we are living
[50:34] in with all kinds of trials and
[50:37] temptations that we're going through. Uh
[50:40] it's a time to encourage each other.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says even more so
[50:46] uh uh be mindful of meeting and going to
[50:49] church. Church, brother Brennham says,
[50:52] doesn't serve you uh but it helps.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Burdens are lifted here. And when you
[50:58] hear testimonies and songs, worship the
[51:01] Lord, that's what we are here to do.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Last evening, uh, of course, we are
[51:07] we've been in Canada now for, uh, this
[51:09] time around for about four or five
[51:11] weeks. And, uh, we are kind of missing
[51:14] home, you know. Um uh I was telling uh I
[51:17] was telling the church in Saskatoon, I
[51:20] said um one thing the Lord have found
[51:22] favor with the Lord, brother Paul is, uh
[51:26] even with the lucrative job that I had
[51:28] at the University of Saskatchewan there
[51:30] as head of department. God has taken
[51:33] away that desire completely. I drive by
[51:36] there, I don't even feel anything. And
[51:39] uh I'm so thankful that uh the Lord uh
[51:42] was in it and uh the Lord has been
[51:44] blessing us um the the missionary work
[51:49] has been going and it's been tremendous
[51:51] with conventions uh in uh countries like
[51:55] our country Zambia um across across
[51:59] northwest south uh east and um other
[52:02] countries Malawi we've had uh huge
[52:05] conventions there areas like Blantire
[52:08] uh Muzu um Chinji Leonge the capital and
[52:13] we are all over the map and uh our
[52:15] itinerary is quite booked right now and
[52:18] uh we ask for your prayers if uh there's
[52:21] somebody you can pray for pray for us
[52:23] Zimbabwe is calling South Africa is
[52:25] calling and uh and so we are we are
[52:28] thankful to be uh just doing our part
[52:32] um and um so uh if we may stand to our
[52:37] fit
[52:39] this morning
[52:41] and strike me the chord for that song.
[52:45] Um we had uh
[52:49] we're so um privileged to be with uh
[52:52] brother
[52:54] uh uh brother Cabab there uh and uh
[52:59] sisters wa brother Richard and sisters
[53:01] wand prepared a really good traditional
[53:04] meal for us. Oh that was so good. How
[53:07] many have eaten ugali here?
[53:11] I see some hands. Yeah. Yeah. You know
[53:13] what that I'm talking about. And the
[53:15] good old okra and and h goat stew. Oh my
[53:19] goodness. I was I was biting my tongue
[53:21] there. I took a chunk and uh it felt
[53:24] like home. So if that can happen in the
[53:27] physical like that,
[53:29] &gt;&gt; how much more with spiritual food this
[53:31] morning?
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Uh you know I I'm trusting we came with
[53:35] empty bears. And and if you came half
[53:38] full, uh you can fill again right to the
[53:40] brim.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; David said, "My cup runth over."
[53:45] &gt;&gt; And let the joy of the Lord run over you
[53:47] today
[53:48] &gt;&gt; and let the Holy Spirit run over you
[53:50] today.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; I see the church is on fire already. I'm
[53:54] just testing the temperature this
[53:55] morning to see where. Are you happy to
[53:58] be in the house of the Lord?
[53:59] &gt;&gt; How many came here for church this
[54:02] morning? That's what we are here to do
[54:04] right now. to show the devil which side
[54:07] we belong. To say, "Satan, you knocked
[54:09] me down, but God raised me up again.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the living God.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; My hope is in the Lord."
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Whoever wrote that song,
[54:21] &gt;&gt; something had struck
[54:23] &gt;&gt; to the depth of their soul.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; They found out very quickly that on
[54:28] their own, they couldn't do nothing.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; And that's my confession this morning. I
[54:34] am weak but he is strong.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; I can do nothing but he can do
[54:38] everything through me.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; And that's what my confession here.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; I stand in all within
[54:46] presence of
[54:51] whom the wisdom moving
[54:55] is life.
[54:58] Oh, the rage of the seed.
[55:04] [Music]
[55:10] You want his soul
[55:13] of life in my
[55:16] [Music]
[55:23] home
[55:25] and my
[55:29] oh my
[55:33] is the Lord
[55:36] [Music]
[55:37] forever. Ever
[55:39] [Music]
[55:45] he stand
[55:48] every rising sun
[55:52] to meet the sinner
[55:55] of God. And I take for each one this
[55:58] morning
[56:00] to offer healing this morning and
[56:03] forgiveness
[56:05] from the table.
[56:06] [Music]
[56:11] Heat. Heat.
[56:24] My
[56:38] [Music]
[56:40] sing again
[56:44] [Applause]
[56:47] I
[56:51] see my
[57:05] [Applause]
[57:09] [Music]
[57:14] Let's pray.
[57:17] Dear Lord Jesus,
[57:20] you the fountain of life,
[57:22] &gt;&gt; the only source of life,
[57:25] &gt;&gt; the alpha and omega.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan would describe you as
[57:29] the all in all,
[57:32] &gt;&gt; the start and the finish.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; We come this morning again knowing that
[57:37] our life is in your hand,
[57:40] &gt;&gt; life and death always move side by side.
[57:44] One moment you are alive, the next
[57:45] moment you are gone. But you've given us
[57:48] this breath of life
[57:49] &gt;&gt; to be in the house of the Lord, to
[57:51] worship you in truth and in spirit.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; We have received the message shalom.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; And we know who we are and we know where
[57:59] we are dwelling.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; We're just here that Lord you may
[58:02] encourage us. Lord, if we have run
[58:05] short, rise up again, Lord. May we throw
[58:09] another shell
[58:10] &gt;&gt; like Samson would say, one more time.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Just one more time this Sunday morning.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Come by our way, Lord Jesus.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; We lift up our eyes unto you and our
[58:21] faith because we know our faith cometh
[58:23] from the Lord.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; It's not our own faith. It's the faith
[58:27] of our fathers.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; It's still living still today.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; So walk with us again, Lord. We trust
[58:35] that Lord where you promise that where
[58:37] two or three are gathered in your name,
[58:39] there you are in their midst.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Here there's more than two of us. Help
[58:44] us bless us together in heavenly places
[58:46] in Christ Jesus, young and old alike and
[58:49] uh in between. Be with us, Lord. And we
[58:52] pray that you bless the preaching of thy
[58:55] word and the reading of thy word to our
[58:58] hearts. We ask these things in the name
[59:00] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. While we are still uh standing,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; uh may we turn our Bibles.
[59:09] Very familiar scripture. We want to just
[59:11] coast along for a little bit here. Thank
[59:14] you to the music and the musicians. Um
[59:20] for helping with that worship. Mark 11,
[59:24] chapter 20.
[59:26] Mark 11, chapter 20.
[59:33] Lord willing, this is our last Sunday
[59:36] here in Canada. We are going back home.
[59:41] Lord willing, we are flying out on
[59:43] Thursday, very early mornings. We ask
[59:45] for your prayers and we'll always be
[59:47] praying for you as well.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; When we kneel down in our chamber, we
[59:52] will always tell the Lord to remember
[59:56] this little congregation,
[59:58] &gt;&gt; this little part of the world. Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Mark 11 chapter 20 and we'll go to verse
[1:00:04] 20 20- 24. And in the morning as they
[1:00:08] passed by, they saw the fig tree dried
[1:00:10] up from the roots. And Peter calling to
[1:00:14] remembrance saith unto him, Master
[1:00:17] before the fig tree. Behold the fig tree
[1:00:20] which thou cursed is withered away. And
[1:00:24] Jesus answering saying saith unto them,
[1:00:27] have faith in God.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. For verily I say unto you, that
[1:00:32] what whosoever shall say unto this
[1:00:34] mountain, be thou moved, and be thou
[1:00:37] cast into the sea, and shall not doubt
[1:00:40] in their heart, but shall believe that
[1:00:43] those things which he saith shall come
[1:00:45] to pass,
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Therefore, I say unto you, whatsoever
[1:00:52] things you desire when you pray,
[1:00:54] believe, and ye receive them, and ye
[1:00:57] shall have them.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord bless the reading of
[1:01:00] the word to our hearts this morning.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; We may take our seats.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; You know, the enemy likes to attack
[1:01:13] uh
[1:01:15] when he knows that there's victory
[1:01:18] ahead.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; That's when Satan really wants to pounce
[1:01:22] on you.
[1:01:24] I'm here to encourage you this morning
[1:01:25] that if you see something and you're
[1:01:28] going through trials and tribulations,
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; that's the time to begin to worship the
[1:01:35] Lord.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; That's the time to begin to sing songs
[1:01:38] of Zion
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; because the devil knows that he can if
[1:01:42] he can put that distraction to you that
[1:01:45] then he'll get you away from focusing on
[1:01:47] the word. Each time the enemy wants to
[1:01:51] uh uh uh uh or he perceives that there's
[1:01:54] victory ahead of you, then he wants to
[1:01:57] put all kinds of roadblocks in front of
[1:01:59] you.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking here for an experience
[1:02:03] because uh after preaching in Saskatoon
[1:02:06] last Sunday, the brothers decided to
[1:02:08] take me for uh for fishing and we went
[1:02:11] all the way to Lrange there and uh it
[1:02:14] was a a place where there's no self
[1:02:17] service. It's completely off-grid. Uh we
[1:02:19] had good fishing there, brother Paul.
[1:02:21] Walley everywhere. And uh I caught the
[1:02:24] biggest one uh that I could. And I
[1:02:27] thought, "Oh, that was really good." And
[1:02:29] we how good it is to just cut catch a
[1:02:32] good fresh fish uh with very so much fat
[1:02:36] in it. And and and then just by the leg
[1:02:39] side uh uh prepare it and eat it so
[1:02:43] fresh. Feels so good in the mouth. I was
[1:02:46] uh and uh I was rejoicing, but then the
[1:02:49] devil the day we were starting off, the
[1:02:51] devil attacked me and and all of a
[1:02:54] sudden I had this terrible flu with my
[1:02:57] son Junior there and uh and everything
[1:03:00] else. And uh we we were in terrible
[1:03:02] shape. Uh and and and and so uh I I
[1:03:08] asked the Lord, I said, "If it's thy
[1:03:10] will, I will get to Calvary." Amen.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; And if the devil has be given me a black
[1:03:17] eye right now,
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; when I get to the pit there, I'll give
[1:03:21] him two black eyes.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm here to do this
[1:03:24] morning is to give the devil two black
[1:03:27] eyes because the prophet says when the
[1:03:29] enemy say boo to you, you say boo
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; to him. I guess I guess that's what we
[1:03:34] are here to do this morning.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; So glad to be with my wife there. you
[1:03:38] know, we she's a missionary uh as well,
[1:03:42] and we travel all kinds of places. We've
[1:03:45] gone into the the jungles of Africa
[1:03:47] where we've slept on the floor on a mat
[1:03:51] uh with uh with rats all over the place.
[1:03:55] We've also gone to places where where
[1:03:57] we've slept on a bed and the bed is
[1:03:59] sinking in between in the middle. We've
[1:04:02] gone to places where, you know, uh,
[1:04:05] places infested with bed bugs, but we've
[1:04:08] gone to places where it's been very
[1:04:10] good, too. Very nice hotels in Africa.
[1:04:12] So, it's not all jungle. There are some
[1:04:14] areas that are really really nice as
[1:04:16] well.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; And and so we we she's always with me.
[1:04:20] We always travel together. Wherever we
[1:04:22] go, we go together. And I'm thankful to
[1:04:24] have her here. Um she is uh uh the
[1:04:29] pillar that helps me choose what I I uh
[1:04:32] what I wear and the ties. So if I look
[1:04:34] good uh uh give kudos to her
[1:04:38] and so we thank we thank the Lord. She
[1:04:42] does my tie. I don't even know how to
[1:04:44] tie a tie myself. And uh so and uh so we
[1:04:48] were in this place one day and uh we're
[1:04:50] sleeping and it's pitch dark and uh all
[1:04:53] of a sudden uh there was a rat uh that
[1:04:56] came and beat my my toe. Uh it was so
[1:05:00] painful and blood gushing everywhere. I
[1:05:02] was very angry at that rat and I tried
[1:05:05] to look for it. It was gone. So that's
[1:05:08] the way of a missionary. You go to all
[1:05:11] kinds of places and leading souls to
[1:05:13] Christ.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have just read here and uh and
[1:05:18] uh I want to because it challenged me as
[1:05:23] an individual. This scripture challenged
[1:05:25] me.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; We are so much used to say Lord uh uh
[1:05:30] what can I do? Lord, Lord help me here.
[1:05:32] Lord help. Now this scripture is
[1:05:34] particularly
[1:05:36] it's particularly challenging you and me
[1:05:39] as individuals. And I want to build with
[1:05:42] it to where we are today this this
[1:05:44] morning.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible says if you not him if you can
[1:05:49] say to this mountain move
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; and you don't doubt in your heart
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; and you say be cast into the sea it
[1:05:58] shall happen just the way you have said
[1:06:00] it
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; because why you have reached to that
[1:06:03] level now where you can speak the word
[1:06:05] of God because the word has become one
[1:06:08] with you my brother. The Bible says at
[1:06:11] that day you shall know that I and my
[1:06:14] father are one
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; and I in you and you in me my brother.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; We have arrived. It's not coming. It's
[1:06:21] already here.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; We are so full of saying it's coming or
[1:06:25] the revival is coming. This is coming.
[1:06:27] It's already here. Revival we will not
[1:06:29] see such a great number. The prophet has
[1:06:32] already declared. But revival is you in
[1:06:35] you and me as individuals this morning.
[1:06:38] Amen.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; We can choose to get revived right this
[1:06:41] morning and say, "Lord, I need that
[1:06:43] revival in my heart."
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you, my brother. I know we
[1:06:48] were together in Saskatoon last Sunday
[1:06:50] and uh we had lunch together.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; It was good to be with you. But I I'm
[1:06:55] here to encourage you, church, that
[1:06:57] don't lean, don't rely on the mistakes
[1:07:00] of yesterday.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Don't be defined by the circumstances of
[1:07:05] yesterday. What happened yesterday, the
[1:07:08] Lord Jesus Christ has already taken care
[1:07:10] of it.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; The blood, you are not on your own. The
[1:07:14] blood of Jesus Christ speaks on your
[1:07:16] behalf. My brother
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; speak better words than those of Abel.
[1:07:20] Let me encourage you this morning. If
[1:07:22] you are done down this morning, rise up
[1:07:24] again as a child of the living God. I
[1:07:26] say, "As for me and my house, we shall
[1:07:29] serve the living God."
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:33] Don't allow the enemy to come between
[1:07:35] you and the Lord.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Don't allow the enemy to to depress you.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; I was just preaching not long ago here
[1:07:42] at some church and after service two
[1:07:45] elderly sisters come by and say with
[1:07:48] tears streaking down says, "You spoke to
[1:07:50] my heart. If that wasn't for anybody, it
[1:07:53] was for me." That should be the
[1:07:55] declaration of every believer. Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Don't look at who is beside you, who is
[1:08:01] in front of you, who is behind you.
[1:08:03] Don't look at your mother, don't look at
[1:08:04] your father. You young people, rise up
[1:08:07] again and run with the baton of God.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; You've been predestined to be overcomers
[1:08:13] in this hour. You've been predestined to
[1:08:16] be to be the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:18] Remember the prophet says, "I no longer
[1:08:20] call you church anymore."
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; You are Mrs. Jesus.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; That's who you are, my brother. Don't
[1:08:27] allow the enemy to give you all kinds of
[1:08:29] names.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Rely on what the Lord says.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; In Jeremiah 29:1,
[1:08:37] the prophet, the Bible says, "I know the
[1:08:40] thoughts that I have for you."
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about what the thoughts the
[1:08:44] devil has for you or be concerned about
[1:08:47] what God thinks about you.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about how you look, my
[1:08:51] brother, my sister. Don't worry about
[1:08:53] what clothing you have. You worry that
[1:08:55] you are in the in that mind. Be
[1:08:58] concerned whether you are in the mind of
[1:09:00] God or not.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; That's my encouragement to you this
[1:09:04] morning. Our God is still in the
[1:09:07] business of healing.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Our God is still in the business of
[1:09:11] delivering.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Our God is still in the business of
[1:09:15] giving uh grace to you. He's a God of
[1:09:17] second chances. He's a God of third
[1:09:20] chances, fourth chances. If you go
[1:09:22] sincerely unto him, he will hear your
[1:09:24] heart's cry this morning.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; I'm here to ask you, what's your
[1:09:30] mountain?
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not a prophet, so I can't tell you
[1:09:33] what's in your life, but I know that the
[1:09:35] word of God is sharper than any
[1:09:37] double-edged sword, and he's a designer
[1:09:39] of every heart, every spirit. Right now,
[1:09:42] he's discerning in the congregation.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; you know your deficiencies. I know my
[1:09:48] deficiencies. I would say like that man,
[1:09:51] help thou my unbelief, Lord.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Because in here, we don't come to look
[1:09:57] at each other. We don't come to measure
[1:09:59] each other. And and we come to measure
[1:10:02] ourselves with the word of God.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; In here, there's no room to look down on
[1:10:09] each other. This is the church of the
[1:10:11] living God we are talking about. Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Everybody has the right to the tree of
[1:10:16] life
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; and that's the Lord Jesus Christ this
[1:10:19] morning.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; What's your mountain this morning?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; My Let me take off this jacket.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; You can't plow the field with a jacket
[1:10:26] on.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; And we are in this field of the message
[1:10:31] of the hour. It's here to revive us.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's a people that should be
[1:10:36] free, it's the message people in this
[1:10:38] hour. Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid to say this, brothers and
[1:10:42] sisters. There's so many people around
[1:10:45] the message, but very few in the
[1:10:47] message.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; We need to get into the message and get
[1:10:51] one with the message.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; God help me. I'm not preaching down on
[1:10:54] you, my brother. I'm preaching to myself
[1:10:56] and to my household as well. May God be
[1:10:59] merciful.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says, "Every time a
[1:11:03] message comes, it brings with it three
[1:11:06] things: grace, mercy, and deliverance."
[1:11:09] Every time a minister stands, a true
[1:11:12] minister of war, God stands in the
[1:11:14] pulpit has to be give these three
[1:11:16] things.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Grace, mercy, deliverance.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; While it's still around, I urge you to
[1:11:24] receive it this morning.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Every time you put your hand up, my
[1:11:28] brother, you are receiving your answer
[1:11:29] from above.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Every time you say amen, God answers
[1:11:33] your prayer. Every time you say you
[1:11:35] hallelujah, Satan doesn't love those
[1:11:38] things, my brother.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Exposition of the seven churches.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan says Jesus Christ is not
[1:11:46] only the word of God,
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; he's also the God of the word.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Not only that, my brother, he's not only
[1:11:52] the God of the word, he's also the God
[1:11:54] of the Amen.
[1:11:56] [Music]
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; So, he loves it when you say your amens,
[1:12:00] your amens are not in vain. They're
[1:12:02] glorifying Almighty God this morning.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; What's your mountain this morning?
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Every one of us has a little mountain.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Maybe you are having challenges in life.
[1:12:17] Maybe you're having challenges in your
[1:12:18] marriage. I'll tell you my brother, our
[1:12:21] Jesus Christ is still in the in the
[1:12:23] business of mending marriages this
[1:12:25] morning. He can bring love where love
[1:12:28] has been lost. He can bring that warmth
[1:12:30] in the home where it has been lost. He's
[1:12:33] he is the God of total restoration.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Maybe a little conquer worm has come in
[1:12:40] your life in my life. Palmer,
[1:12:42] caterpillar, locust and starting to eat
[1:12:44] away a little bit. You know the devil
[1:12:46] comes so sly
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; and starting to eat away a little bit.
[1:12:51] Oh, may the shalom of God shine upon
[1:12:54] your life and restore again that which
[1:12:56] the devil has taken from you.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; I'm reminded of uh David
[1:13:05] in kings there. Something had happened
[1:13:07] to him.
[1:13:10] The Amalachites and others had come
[1:13:14] and they had taken over the city, the
[1:13:16] city of Zikla.
[1:13:19] They didn't wipe up the the people.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; They just got everybody who was there,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; the women, the men, the children,
[1:13:26] everything, bent the whole place over
[1:13:29] and they took those people with them.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; And the people when they realize that
[1:13:34] they were so upset with David.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; There comes a time in life where you
[1:13:42] know who your true friends are.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Let something wrong happen in your life,
[1:13:46] my brother. Everybody else will run away
[1:13:48] from you. Just a few friends will be
[1:13:50] left. Those are the true friends that
[1:13:52] are with you in hard times and good
[1:13:54] times.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; And David, they wanted to stone him.
[1:14:01] And the Bible says David put his
[1:14:04] confidence in the Lord.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; It came a time that David prayed a
[1:14:09] prayer
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; and said, "This has happened Lord.
[1:14:14] May I pursue my enemies?
[1:14:18] May I overtake them?
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, the word of the Lord
[1:14:23] said, "Go pursue
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; and overtake your enemies
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; and get everything
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; back."
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; I'm here to encourage you this morning.
[1:14:34] Take everything back that the enemy has
[1:14:37] stolen from you, my brother.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Belongs to you.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus Christ is your portion.
[1:14:43] is your inheritance this morning.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Gift, you're sweating it out.
[1:14:49] You are laboring. Yes, I'm a laborer in
[1:14:51] my master's field.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; This morning, Brother Gift, you go to
[1:14:55] the gym. I don't go to the gym. This is
[1:14:57] my gym here.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; How many love the Lord this morning?
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; So, David took his men, 22 of them, I
[1:15:07] believe, and started pursuing the enemy
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; and they overtook the enemy. M
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; and they got everything and slaughtered
[1:15:15] every enemy. If that can happen to David
[1:15:18] who was under the blood of bulls and
[1:15:20] gods, what about you who is under the
[1:15:23] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ this
[1:15:25] morning? I say pursue, go overtake and
[1:15:28] get everything that belongs to you.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Your marriage belongs to you. Your
[1:15:33] children belongs to you. Your father,
[1:15:35] your mother, claim whatever belongs to
[1:15:37] you, my brother.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; That position at work belongs to you. If
[1:15:42] the enemy wants to take that word from
[1:15:44] you, reject and rebuke the enemy.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Gift, I'm going for an
[1:15:50] interview. I don't know what to say. The
[1:15:52] Bible says, don't worry what you're
[1:15:53] going to say. I will give you the words
[1:15:56] to say.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Rejoice in the Lord this morning.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; We serve a mighty God.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; May I say this this morning? I don't
[1:16:06] care what mountain is ahead of you.
[1:16:09] If you say to this mountain,
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; be moved and cast into the sea and don't
[1:16:14] doubt in your heart, it shall happen, my
[1:16:17] brother.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; That mountain has to move. And brother
[1:16:24] Brennham qualified it further. He said,
[1:16:28] if one grain
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; of that mountain begins to move, the
[1:16:32] mountain has already started moving.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Let that grain move in your life right
[1:16:37] now. May God drop something in your
[1:16:39] heart that say Lord I believe even now
[1:16:42] Lord Jesus
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; it happened to Martha
[1:16:48] Mo Lazarus had been dead for 4 days
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; dead body decomposed and stinky and
[1:16:55] everything.
[1:16:56] Martha said to the Lord if you had been
[1:16:59] here Moses that Lazarus wouldn't have
[1:17:01] died.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Oh brother our Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:17:05] still here this morning. He says, "I
[1:17:07] will be with you even in you to the end
[1:17:09] of the world.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; He'll never leave you." When you think
[1:17:13] that you are in deep trouble
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; and the Lord is not there, that's when
[1:17:18] you should realize very quickly that
[1:17:21] this who is putting that in my mind is
[1:17:23] the devil. Because I know that when I'm
[1:17:25] in deep trouble, that's when the Lord
[1:17:27] picks me up.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; He's that kind of a God this morning
[1:17:33] that can hear your heart's cry. Yeah,
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; those two ladies, separate ones, come to
[1:17:40] me and said, "I'm suffering from
[1:17:42] depression.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; What you preached there hit my heart,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; depression, anxiety,
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; is hitting young people,
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; the middle age, and even the elderly,
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:57] 200 million demons have been released
[1:18:00] and unleashed on this earth,
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; buffeting parents and grandparents and
[1:18:07] children left, right, center, everybody.
[1:18:09] There's nobody immune,
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Pastors, ministers, bishops, whatever
[1:18:14] the title,
[1:18:16] the devil is at work
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; trying to bring you down. But I know as
[1:18:21] a child of the living God, I don't care
[1:18:23] how down you get, but God will bring you
[1:18:26] up again.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; The devil is a loser.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; And you are on the winning side.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Whatever happens, you're on the winning
[1:18:38] side.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; I was telling a church in Spruce Grove
[1:18:41] in Alberta there in Edmonton there.
[1:18:45] I was watching and flipping through the
[1:18:47] that the that that the the the screen in
[1:18:49] my room and my hotel room and I came
[1:18:52] across where there they they were about
[1:18:55] to play soccer.
[1:18:57] Back home we call it football.
[1:19:02] They were about to play soccer and those
[1:19:04] were two prominent teams and I looked at
[1:19:07] them for a little while and
[1:19:10] during the time I used to watch soccer
[1:19:12] like crazy.
[1:19:14] I'll be so fixated on these teams and I
[1:19:17] knew these teams
[1:19:20] and there were two commentators there
[1:19:23] that were talking
[1:19:25] about these teams and which one stood
[1:19:28] the chance to win
[1:19:30] and as well debating back and forth.
[1:19:35] What caught my attention was one
[1:19:37] commentator said this about one team,
[1:19:39] the the other the one team he was he was
[1:19:42] thinking was going to win. He said the
[1:19:45] good thing
[1:19:46] with this team is that whether they play
[1:19:50] good or they play bad, they always win.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; If that can happen in the natural, what
[1:19:58] more in the spiritual you I'm looking at
[1:20:00] winners this morning. I'm looking at a
[1:20:03] bunch of winners. Whether you came
[1:20:04] gloom, whether you are sick, whatever
[1:20:06] problem you have, you are already on the
[1:20:08] winning side this morning.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; If God be for us, who can be against us?
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Job would say, "I know my redeemer
[1:20:19] liveth."
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; That's what we need to confess this
[1:20:22] morning. Regardless of how sick, you
[1:20:24] know, I am, I know my redeemer liveth.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; No, the confession of a believer is like
[1:20:31] that of a Shunomite woman.
[1:20:33] her child was dead
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; from heat stroke
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; and she rode a mu to go to the to the
[1:20:39] prophet Elisha
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; and when she got there Elisha asked her
[1:20:44] is all well with you and the the woman
[1:20:47] says all is well
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; sometimes we glorify the devil too much
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; you asked a question how are you feeling
[1:20:55] oh you know this is eching this is this
[1:20:57] is uh troublesome and all this we're
[1:20:59] glorifying the devil how about we say by
[1:21:02] his stripes I'm already healed.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; That's what we need in this hour is to
[1:21:08] shame the devil. Whatever situation you
[1:21:10] are in, my brother, whether whether
[1:21:12] whether it is financial uh whatever it
[1:21:15] is, look up to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:21:18] Let him hold your hand and guide your
[1:21:20] footsteps. You will get across from the
[1:21:22] other to the other shore.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; I can assure you of that.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; They that believe on him, they've
[1:21:28] already passed from death unto life.
[1:21:30] Amen.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; I am not here to bring anything new, but
[1:21:33] to encourage you like Peter says, steer
[1:21:35] up your pure minds by way of
[1:21:37] remembrance. I'm here to encourage you
[1:21:39] again to remind you that young and old,
[1:21:41] whether whatever age you are, my brother
[1:21:43] and others young young people in here, I
[1:21:46] I'm here to encourage you that if you
[1:21:48] are in the Lord,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; nothing can go against you.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Our Lord will fight your battles. Let
[1:21:55] him fight your battles this evening.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; This morning, rather. How many believe
[1:21:59] the Lord this morning?
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Our God is more than able. He is that
[1:22:04] one who makes a way where there's no
[1:22:05] way. Brother Brennham says, "If God told
[1:22:08] me to go through that war, I will start
[1:22:11] walking towards that war because I know
[1:22:14] once I get there, there will be a way
[1:22:15] made for me."
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; He's still the way maker this morning.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; He's still the chain breaker this
[1:22:21] morning, my brother.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; He's still the cycle breaker this
[1:22:25] morning. Amen.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Some of us come from lineages,
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; that are so crooked.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Don't identify yourself with that.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; You are of another race, my brother.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; You are of another blood right now.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Some of us come from ancestry, ancestral
[1:22:45] glory lines, but we are prostitutes and
[1:22:49] drunkards, smokers, witchcraft.
[1:22:53] telling the people back home, don't be
[1:22:55] scared of witchcrafted wizard. Instead,
[1:22:58] they should be scared of you.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; There's one pastor in Muzu in Malawi
[1:23:06] there. The wizard that come wanted to
[1:23:10] enter the home. When they got to the
[1:23:13] yard, they couldn't see the house. It
[1:23:16] was all light and chariots of fire.
[1:23:21] and they caught them and took them to
[1:23:23] the police
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; and the police were interviewing them.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; How come you couldn't enter? You are
[1:23:29] saying you've entered the house of this,
[1:23:31] this, this, this. How come you couldn't
[1:23:33] enter the house of this one? Says
[1:23:35] there's fire everywhere.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; The angels of the Lord are encamped
[1:23:40] around those that fear him.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Don't worry whether you have h you have
[1:23:45] a warence or you don't have a warence.
[1:23:48] Your warance is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:23:50] He's the one that protects and keep you,
[1:23:52] my brother, my sister.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; If the devil is trying to put a curse on
[1:23:58] you, take that curse back to him.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Doesn't belong to you. Doesn't belong to
[1:24:03] your family.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; A child of the living God.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:09] Sometimes he wants to bring confusion
[1:24:12] between house and w husband and wife.
[1:24:16] You know, back in Sask, we call it
[1:24:18] reading into it.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thought you said this. That's what
[1:24:25] you thought.
[1:24:27] That's not what I meant. Oh, okay.
[1:24:31] Back and forth.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; We read into things.
[1:24:37] Oh, he's dressed like that. I'm sure it
[1:24:39] must be like this.
[1:24:42] Some of us we like to compare our
[1:24:46] children
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; with other people's children. Have you
[1:24:49] seen so and so's children?
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Have you seen the the way they behave
[1:24:55] up until it comes right into your your
[1:24:57] own home?
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, look up to the Lord.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; He's the one that gives us grace, my
[1:25:06] brother. and never say never.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Because even the thief on the cross
[1:25:13] didn't have time to repent. He didn't
[1:25:15] have time to be baptized. But Jesus
[1:25:17] says, "Today you will be with me in
[1:25:19] paradise."
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; If that can happen to a thief on the
[1:25:22] cross, what about your children? What
[1:25:24] about your wife, your husband who've
[1:25:26] been baptized in the love of the Lord
[1:25:27] Jesus Christ?
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; May the Lord undertake for every family
[1:25:32] there. If you need blessings this
[1:25:34] morning as a preacher ordained by God, I
[1:25:37] say get your blessings in the name of
[1:25:39] the Lord Jesus Christ. If you need
[1:25:41] victory, get your victory today.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; You are children of victory in this
[1:25:45] hour.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Whether the devil likes it or not,
[1:25:49] you're going to cross.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; And we are not going to willy-nilly
[1:25:52] cross. We are going to cross with flying
[1:25:54] colors because he who started the work
[1:25:57] in you will also finish it.
[1:25:59] [Applause]
[1:26:02] Hallelujah.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; If you are called of God, my brother, my
[1:26:04] sister, you will make it.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Some circumstances seems like, oh, I've
[1:26:10] fallen out of grace. You can't steep so
[1:26:14] low, stoop so low, but what the hand of
[1:26:17] Jesus Christ can bring you out of there.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; You can't uh stray so far away, but what
[1:26:25] the long arm of the Lord will bring you
[1:26:27] back in line. My brother, that's the cry
[1:26:30] of the message of the hour to the bride.
[1:26:33] Stay in line. Stay in line. And if you
[1:26:36] hear or see anybody bring a message that
[1:26:40] is contrary to this message of the hour,
[1:26:42] run away from such people.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Follow me as I follow
[1:26:49] Christ."
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; There is a catch there. So if I'm not
[1:26:52] following Christ, don't follow me.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Follow the message of the hour. I say
[1:26:57] stay with the message church.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; That's what will bring a rapture and
[1:27:02] resurrection. It's got that power in it.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Gift, can I can I be forgiven?
[1:27:08] Yes, you can. As long as what you
[1:27:10] committed is not blasphemy against the
[1:27:13] Holy Ghost to say about this message
[1:27:15] that it's of the devil will not be
[1:27:17] forgiven here on earth and even in
[1:27:19] heaven.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Blessed are you that delight yourself in
[1:27:24] the message of the hour. Yes, sir.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Why am I saying these things? Move your
[1:27:32] mountain.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; I'm thinking about the children of
[1:27:35] Israel.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; The Bible says all things work together
[1:27:40] for good
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; to them that love him and for his
[1:27:43] purpose.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; You believe that, brother Tabiso?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and and the way it is God
[1:27:54] works in mysterious ways
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; and the way of the Lord are past finding
[1:27:58] out
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; sometimes he'll take you where and lead
[1:28:02] you way this way only to bring you here
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; and then you wonder Lord why didn't I
[1:28:07] just take a this no he's a he's not a
[1:28:10] god of shortcuts
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; so you can't weasle your way through to
[1:28:14] heaven it has to take him
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; that started the work in you
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; he also finish it. He doesn't run out of
[1:28:22] resources like we do as human beings.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Oh no, no. He will use the same resource
[1:28:27] to mold it and build it into a stature
[1:28:29] of a perfect man.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Our God is the greatest project manager.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; He knows how to manage
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; and we are his project
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; and we are his design.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. Is the
[1:28:44] greatest landscaper right now is just
[1:28:46] down to the finishing touches. One of
[1:28:49] these days,
[1:28:51] the prophet says it's going to take a
[1:28:54] lunatic
[1:28:56] over a glass of vodka
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; in Russia to press the button
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; and America will be a smothering of
[1:29:03] ashes.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; The prophet said it, I believe it.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; I would say like Billy Paul, God fought
[1:29:09] it.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; The prophet said it, I believe it, and
[1:29:13] that settles it.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; That's a way to believe, my brother. God
[1:29:18] said so. Abraham, you're 100 years old,
[1:29:20] but God said so.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Job, you are dying with boils all over
[1:29:26] your body, but God say so. That he's my
[1:29:28] redeemer. He's my healer.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; You can confess that way in your life.
[1:29:32] He's my provider. He's still Jehovah
[1:29:34] Gyra. even this morning
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; back home
[1:29:43] or preaching at a certain church
[1:29:48] and her sister didn't know where her
[1:29:52] next meal was coming from.
[1:29:54] She was down
[1:29:56] her last meal was the breakfast they had
[1:29:58] in the morning. We were preaching away
[1:30:02] under the anointing of God. You see, if
[1:30:05] you make this message personal, God will
[1:30:07] visit you at a personal level.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Grandparents have their problems that
[1:30:13] are different from the teenager.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. That's right.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Everybody is at different levels right
[1:30:18] now. But our God will visit you in your
[1:30:21] own situation.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; And for that sister, she was looking,
[1:30:26] what am I going to feed the children
[1:30:28] after church service?
[1:30:30] And she prayed and straight to the Lord.
[1:30:32] Our God is still Jehovah Gyra this
[1:30:35] morning.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Some of us have lived both worlds.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; The jungles of Africa there and the
[1:30:43] western world. So we have the balance.
[1:30:45] We know what we're talking about.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; And this sister,
[1:30:53] she prayed earnestly at the altar. When
[1:30:55] she got home, there was two bags of
[1:30:58] cornmeal and a whole bunch of groceries.
[1:31:02] And up to now she doesn't know who put
[1:31:04] those things there. He's still Jehovah
[1:31:06] Terra. If he can do that to that sister,
[1:31:09] he can do for you, my brother. My
[1:31:10] sister,
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; we're preaching in Cape Town.
[1:31:18] And we got under anointing to the point
[1:31:20] that we started speaking. See, you can
[1:31:24] let yourself go to the point that it's
[1:31:26] no longer you talking. It's the Lord
[1:31:28] speaking through you. Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; And right there I say to the to the
[1:31:35] point that you sisters that are in
[1:31:36] hospital maybe bedridden,
[1:31:39] if you can grasp this and take it, you
[1:31:43] brother out there who is trying
[1:31:47] cuz they were streaming the service.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; I say you can jump out of that bed
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; and walk back home or go home. Yes.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; These two sisters in two different
[1:32:00] words,
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; They heard and took it personally
[1:32:05] and they said, "If that man, I don't
[1:32:08] know that man, but he's preaching the
[1:32:09] truth."
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; He is speaking to me right now. I take
[1:32:13] it and they gathered up strength and
[1:32:15] walked out of that hospital and
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; and aided.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Pastor was taking us home to our hotel
[1:32:22] room. I see tears streaking down his
[1:32:25] cheeks
[1:32:27] and I'm beginning to wonder, did I say
[1:32:29] something wrong or did I do anything
[1:32:32] wrong? He looked at me with tears in his
[1:32:35] eyes. He said, "You won't believe what
[1:32:37] just happened." The sisters were
[1:32:39] streaming two different words right now.
[1:32:41] They've walked. They were bedridden now.
[1:32:43] Right now, they've walked out of the
[1:32:44] hospital
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; completely healed.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus Christ is still the
[1:32:50] healer this morning.
[1:32:52] If he can heal those sisters, he can
[1:32:54] heal you too, my brother.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. That
[1:33:00] same Jesus Christ who is in Africa is
[1:33:02] the same Jesus Christ who is here.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; That same devil who is here is the same
[1:33:06] devil in Africa.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; And that's why in this hour, God has
[1:33:13] given us the ability
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; to receive this message and believe it
[1:33:18] and tuck it in our heart. Like David
[1:33:20] would say, "Thy word have I hid in my
[1:33:23] heart that I will not sin against thee."
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; He's still that kind of God. This
[1:33:28] morning, I'm here to encourage you.
[1:33:30] Start moving your mountain. Start moving
[1:33:31] your mountain. Whatever your mountain
[1:33:33] is, start saying it.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; If you can say,
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; "Where are we at now?"
[1:33:41] The first pool, the first pool was good,
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; but the second pool was greater.
[1:33:49] The second pool was really good,
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; but the third pool was greater.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; I was preaching in Saskatoon on a little
[1:33:57] subject last time said, "Come up hither.
[1:33:59] That's where we need to do, my brother.
[1:34:01] Go up and live in that third pool
[1:34:04] because that's what's meant for you and
[1:34:06] me as believers of this hour."
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Speak the word and move forward.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Don't doubt in your heart. Speak it.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; If you have need of something now, don't
[1:34:15] just say, "I I need a tree here. I need
[1:34:17] this one. This thing here. And if you
[1:34:18] have need of something, my brother, my
[1:34:20] sister, speak the word and move forward.
[1:34:23] Don't doubt in your heart.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; That same God will hear your heart's
[1:34:27] cry.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; He'll hear your prayer this morning.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; He's that kind of a God that we serve.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Just a little testimony. Bu now you hear
[1:34:39] people so much times
[1:34:42] even asking for prayer. So and so are
[1:34:45] sick. There's cancer everywhere.
[1:34:47] Diabetes.
[1:34:50] Some of you know my testimony. I was
[1:34:52] dying with diabetes in 2007 in Saskatoon
[1:34:56] there. Couldn't even lift my 2-year-old
[1:34:59] baby into my into my house in my
[1:35:01] upstairs.
[1:35:04] And I thought I was teetering between
[1:35:06] death and life.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; I know the ends of where I reached.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:12] But I say to the Lord, Lord, if you heal
[1:35:14] me, I'm going to stand for you and
[1:35:17] preach the best that I can and win souls
[1:35:19] for Christ. And today, I can declare I
[1:35:22] am healed by the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:35:25] I have more energy than I have ever had
[1:35:27] before.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; I can eat what I want.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; I can run. I can jog. I can do push-ups.
[1:35:37] 40, 50 push-ups nonstop.
[1:35:40] You young people, I challenge you. You
[1:35:42] can come see me after church this
[1:35:44] morning.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. He's a
[1:35:48] God of total restoration this morning.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. You
[1:35:54] hear people say, "I want to be healed
[1:35:56] physically." That's good. But very
[1:35:58] little we hear of people asking to be
[1:36:01] healed spiritually and healing of our
[1:36:03] souls. We can be healed physically today
[1:36:05] and die tomorrow. But once your soul is
[1:36:08] healed, my brother, my sister, you are
[1:36:10] in eternity.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; If you notice some of you that have read
[1:36:21] maybe listened so much, there are elders
[1:36:22] in here and I give respect.
[1:36:26] Read the message left, right, center
[1:36:28] over the years. If you notice the first
[1:36:32] pool with brother Brennham was dealing
[1:36:34] more with the nominal church,
[1:36:35] Presbyterians and Baptists and all this.
[1:36:40] By 1948 when the second pool happened
[1:36:43] there in Saskatchewan in Regina,
[1:36:46] the second pool broke the descentment of
[1:36:48] the heart.
[1:36:51] The nominal churches started dropping
[1:36:54] off
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; and Pentecostals came in. Yeah.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; By 1963, 62 63
[1:37:04] when the seals were broken
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; and we got into this third pool.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; At one time, the angel of the Lord said,
[1:37:12] "Come up hither.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Let me show you how to catch the big
[1:37:16] fish."
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Who is the big fish? I'm looking at them
[1:37:20] right now
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; that are fit for the master's table.
[1:37:23] This message will choke the Pentecostals
[1:37:25] to death. Right?
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Because it's not meat for them. But to
[1:37:30] the bride of Jesus Christ, we say, "This
[1:37:33] is fresh mana." That's for us.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; 1963, brother Brennham declares, he
[1:37:38] says, "From now on, I'm going to lose
[1:37:41] thousands of my friends."
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Sure, he did. Because there was ushering
[1:37:45] in another group of people, a special
[1:37:48] group of people, a group of people that
[1:37:50] has been selected and because they heard
[1:37:53] the shout, "Come out of her, my people.
[1:37:56] Yes.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; They didn't hear the trumpet because the
[1:37:58] trumpet is for Israel.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; They heard the shout
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; and the shout is still going on right
[1:38:04] now to the bride of Jesus Christ. Oh,
[1:38:06] hear the shout of the Lord Jesus. Come
[1:38:09] out of high. Come up higher. Come out of
[1:38:12] that that that that first pool, second
[1:38:14] pool. Go into the third pool, my
[1:38:16] brother, where all things are possible.
[1:38:18] Right now, we should be right into the
[1:38:20] chamber and where the groom and the
[1:38:22] bride
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. are sealed together.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; And the groom himself closes the door.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; When he closes, nobody can open.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; And when he opens, nobody can can can
[1:38:37] shut the door. That's our Lord Jesus
[1:38:39] Christ. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; What's your mountain this morning?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; I have my own mountain. I have to speak
[1:38:45] my mountain. Out of the way mountain
[1:38:48] because a child of God is coming.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; That's how our confession should be this
[1:38:52] morning.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:38:55] You love the Lord this morning. I'm just
[1:38:57] enjoying myself because the church is
[1:38:59] pulling so much here. I I haven't even
[1:39:02] gotten to where I need to. But we'll get
[1:39:03] there by God's grace.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; If I die, this is the best place to die
[1:39:08] anyway.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Okay. If you're falling a short of
[1:39:14] breath, yeah, that's what we do when you
[1:39:16] you're preaching this glorious gospel.
[1:39:19] Makes you happy, makes you so energetic.
[1:39:21] Brother Brennham says, "Whatever you do,
[1:39:23] do to the best of your ability."
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; If you're a housewife, be the best wife
[1:39:28] housewife they can be.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; If you're a teacher, be the best
[1:39:31] teacher. If you're a student, be a the
[1:39:33] best student.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Speaking of students,
[1:39:39] I'm reminded of one pastor in Muzu in
[1:39:43] Malawi there. I'm reminded of her, of
[1:39:47] him. you know, he has uh eight children
[1:39:51] back home. Uh the more children you
[1:39:54] have, the more rich you are.
[1:40:00] I'm I'm only at three. And uh so this
[1:40:04] this one has eight.
[1:40:08] And uh I think it's the fifth born or
[1:40:11] something.
[1:40:13] He was so dull at school.
[1:40:17] That boy, he used to flank so bad. He
[1:40:20] was always last.
[1:40:23] So back home, you know how you know
[1:40:25] brother Tabiso, you know how they do
[1:40:26] back home when at the end of the term,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; they have to pronounce everybody who is
[1:40:32] number one to the last one and
[1:40:34] everybody's there at the assembly.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:39] So at the end of the term they would
[1:40:40] write their exams and come the end the
[1:40:43] end the day of the last day of the term
[1:40:46] and then every teacher from grade one to
[1:40:48] grade whatever
[1:40:50] they start
[1:40:53] announcing now and and and they compile
[1:40:56] the results and they come to the last
[1:40:59] one and the last one they mentioned that
[1:41:03] boy the son of a pastor and everybody
[1:41:07] used to make fun of him.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Touch not my anointed ones.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Do my prophets no harm.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; And this brother, the pastor,
[1:41:22] he'd be waiting at the gate for his son
[1:41:25] and he would see the gloom and doom in
[1:41:29] his son's face cuz the friends were
[1:41:32] always looking down on him.
[1:41:37] Those of you in school, put your trust
[1:41:40] in the Lord.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; He's the author of knowledge and wisdom.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; This pastor one day, he had enough.
[1:41:52] Something clicked.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; he had enough. He says, "This is a
[1:41:58] serious case.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; I have to take it up with my master.
[1:42:02] Amen.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; He has done wonders in my life and he
[1:42:04] can do wonders in my son.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; And that pastor went to pray and say,
[1:42:11] "Lord,
[1:42:12] you didn't give me a boy that was a tail
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; and or a failure. You didn't give me
[1:42:19] that kind of a son. I'm your servant.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; I'm claiming him right now." Unlock
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; something in his head. Our God can still
[1:42:31] unlock
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; in your life. My brother, my I don't
[1:42:34] know your situation, whatever it is, he
[1:42:36] can unlock.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; If Satan has put a curse on you, our God
[1:42:43] is still the curse remover this morning,
[1:42:46] he can take away that.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; The next 10,
[1:42:52] the boy who was last was Tops and by
[1:42:56] far. Amen.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And from that time he was leading the
[1:43:01] class and the school. He was on top.
[1:43:03] Today he's a doctor operating doing
[1:43:06] brain surgery.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; That mountain had been moved my brother.
[1:43:11] And I am witness to that. If God can do
[1:43:14] that in the flesh, what about in the
[1:43:17] spirit? You are eagles. You can soar
[1:43:19] higher.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; You've heard people say the sky is the
[1:43:22] limit. I don't agree with that one bit.
[1:43:25] The sky is not the limit to the
[1:43:27] believer. You can go beyond the sky.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; That's just human science
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; and they are 17% correct most of the
[1:43:38] time.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Just like the weatherman.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; But our God is 100%.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; And our God is not a 50% God. He's not a
[1:43:50] 75. When he heals you, he heals you
[1:43:52] completely.
[1:43:54] Yes.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Don't compromise with the enemy to get
[1:43:57] the other 50%. No, no, no. Mountain be
[1:44:00] thou moved.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; I want everything because in this
[1:44:04] message winner takes it all.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; We don't have room for the devil.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Ah, what's your mountain to the to to
[1:44:12] you today? If you say
[1:44:15] to this mountain, then there's another
[1:44:17] phrase there.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Have faith in God.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. We hear brother Brennham using it
[1:44:23] all the time during discernment time.
[1:44:26] Have faith in God.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Ah I'm speaking to myself. God give me
[1:44:32] that faith that I can move my mountains.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Once I move my mountain I can help my my
[1:44:38] brother my sister to move their mountain
[1:44:39] too.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; How would we do that? We can do that by
[1:44:42] testimony. Yes sir.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; I was preaching at a a a country youth
[1:44:47] camp back home and and and
[1:44:51] screams everywhere and people touched
[1:44:54] the youth where and one sister came and
[1:44:57] gave testimony of how she was delivered
[1:45:00] and that triggered another sister,
[1:45:03] another brother, another you see the
[1:45:05] enemy likes to keep our testimonies kept
[1:45:07] up.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Speak it. Let somebody know because
[1:45:11] somebody might be suffering with the
[1:45:13] same situation and when they hear you
[1:45:16] testify of the goodness of the Lord.
[1:45:18] They can also rise up and say, "Lord,
[1:45:20] that's for me as well."
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord is here right now
[1:45:25] to undertake for each and everyone. Yes,
[1:45:27] the prophet is gone, but the angel of
[1:45:29] the Lord is here. The pillar of fire is
[1:45:31] here. How do I know?
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; The prophet says when we come to church,
[1:45:35] each one bring a lick of fire. Lick of
[1:45:37] fire. Once everybody brings their licks
[1:45:39] of fire, it makes the pillar of fire.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning?
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Our God is the undertaker for every
[1:45:47] believer.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Whatever your situation, he will make
[1:45:51] impossibilities possible.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Because with God, nothing is impossible.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; When you hear you young people say, "Oh,
[1:45:59] your family line, you can't go any
[1:46:01] further. This is as far as you can go."
[1:46:04] Tell the devil, "That's a bunch of
[1:46:05] nonsense. I belong to another race now.
[1:46:08] I'm a super race. I'm a super seed. And
[1:46:12] you might have done that to my lineage,
[1:46:14] but you're not going to do that to me
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm a child of the living God. Get
[1:46:18] out of that cocoon and pip your way out
[1:46:21] of there and free yourself by the blood
[1:46:23] of Jesus Christ and the spirit of God
[1:46:26] that dwelleth in you.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; My brother G. Spirit of God dwelleth in
[1:46:32] me. How do I know? You know when you
[1:46:34] have the spirit of God. Amen.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Nobody has to tell you that you have the
[1:46:38] Holy Ghost
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says the spirit of God
[1:46:42] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[1:46:45] are children of the living God.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah this morning.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Ah I'm here to encourage you my brother
[1:46:53] my sister that you know if something has
[1:46:56] happened in your life don't let the
[1:46:59] setbacks of yesterday bring you down. We
[1:47:03] are not the Romans chapter 7 people
[1:47:07] lamenting lamenting oh poor wretched
[1:47:09] soul oh me this me that there are people
[1:47:11] who are always beating down themselves
[1:47:13] beating those oh I'm I'm no good you
[1:47:15] know the way I'm looking the way I'm
[1:47:17] performing them and it's all all
[1:47:19] negative negative negative negative
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; ah God doesn't delight in negative
[1:47:24] people
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; God delights in people that show
[1:47:27] positivity
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; to say yes I know I don't have it but
[1:47:31] I'll get it Yes.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; By God's grace, I'm walking into that
[1:47:34] promise
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; because it's mine, my brother.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; That's what a confession of a believer
[1:47:39] should be. If the devil says you can't,
[1:47:41] you say, "Yes, I can."
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Because Paul says, "I can do all things
[1:47:46] through Jesus Christ that strengthens
[1:47:48] me."
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; That's the work of the believer.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; That's the walk of a true believer this
[1:47:54] morning.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; I'm reminded of Moses.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:59] He's gone
[1:48:01] to get the children of Israel.
[1:48:04] On one hand, God has packed Moses with
[1:48:09] miracles.
[1:48:11] But how do those miracles work? How are
[1:48:14] they going to be exhibited?
[1:48:17] God has a plan.
[1:48:20] While he has packed Moses with miracles,
[1:48:23] he has also hardened the heart of
[1:48:26] Pharaoh.
[1:48:28] It's God who did that.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Even says, "For this reason I created
[1:48:33] you."
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; To harden your heart.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; So that my miracles can come to to to
[1:48:39] fruition.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; And and and so Pharaoh's heart is so
[1:48:45] hard.
[1:48:47] He won't listen. Release the children.
[1:48:49] Nor you're not going anywhere. But the
[1:48:52] fleas started coming in. The frogs and
[1:48:54] everything.
[1:48:56] Oh, Pharaoh starts to see this is this
[1:48:58] is something else now.
[1:49:01] Let me strike a deal. You don't strike a
[1:49:04] deal with the enemy.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; This message
[1:49:10] is a one-man commando.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; It's a gorilla warfare.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; It's not a group thing. Yes, we are a
[1:49:16] group here, but we are individuals
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; before God.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; You have to fight your own battles. I
[1:49:22] have to fight mine. Amen.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; With my Lord on my side,
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Moses begins to perform all these
[1:49:30] miracles and Pharaoh says, "Oh, uh, what
[1:49:35] about you leave your your elderly and
[1:49:38] the the sickly and the children?" And
[1:49:41] Moses says, "No, we are not leaving
[1:49:44] everybody. Not even a hoof will be left
[1:49:46] behind.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; We are going everybody." That's what a
[1:49:50] child of the living God, that's what a
[1:49:52] real soldier does. He fights for himself
[1:49:54] and fights for others.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; So they got out of there. God had said,
[1:50:00] "Look,
[1:50:02] follow the pillar of fire and let the
[1:50:05] children of Israel follow you. There is
[1:50:07] an order in how things are done."
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Follow them. Go to the and lead them
[1:50:16] right to the dead end.
[1:50:19] Don't despair my brother.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Sometimes might seem like dark
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; but victory comes
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; in the morning.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Might be so dark sometimes in your life.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; You don't know where to do
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; or where to go. In front of them was the
[1:50:40] Red Sea.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Behind them was Pharaoh soldiers.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; On the side were steep mountains. And on
[1:50:47] the other side, steep valleys,
[1:50:50] nohere to go.
[1:50:53] Sometimes we get ourselves into
[1:50:56] situations like that. Don't despair.
[1:50:58] That's the time. Be still and let the
[1:51:01] salvation of the Lord take over.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Don't be frustrated now.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Just stand still on the word of God.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; On Christ, the solid solid rock I stand.
[1:51:14] All other ground is sinking sand. Now
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; stay right there and say, "Lord, you who
[1:51:20] has led me yesterday will lead me today
[1:51:22] will lead me tomorrow."
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Through many dangers, toils and snares
[1:51:29] that have been disgrace has brought me
[1:51:32] this far.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Grace will lead me home.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; They stood there and started crying to
[1:51:39] Moses.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Moses cried to God. And God said, "Come
[1:51:43] over here, Moses." When God have to deal
[1:51:46] with you, he'll pull you away from
[1:51:47] everybody.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Catch the vision and follow the vision
[1:51:51] of God. And if it's really God in it,
[1:51:54] he'll make it happen.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; He'll make a way for you.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; And as they stood there, Moses, God
[1:52:00] says, "Come over here, Moses."
[1:52:03] You say, "Why are you crying to me?
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Speak the word and move forward."
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; What's that in your heart? Yeah,
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; let a stick
[1:52:13] strike the waters and part the waters.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; I was asking the church over in
[1:52:19] Edmonton. I said it a thought struck,
[1:52:25] what formula
[1:52:27] did God use
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; to stop the word and resist? What
[1:52:32] tension? What resistance?
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; How can you calculate it?
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; What formula did he use?
[1:52:40] to dry the Red Sea because the Bible
[1:52:42] says they walked on dry ground.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; What formula did God use for you, my
[1:52:50] brother, for you, my sister, to say this
[1:52:52] is the word of God, this message of the
[1:52:55] hour? I receive it. I I I I believe it.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; So, we decided to ask Uncle Google.
[1:53:06] We said, "What what could be the
[1:53:07] formula?" Those of you that have done
[1:53:09] physics, nobody, all those young people
[1:53:11] could answer that. Let's let's ask uh
[1:53:14] Uncle Google cuz he's the one they say
[1:53:16] is the smartest.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; The greatest one is our Lord Jesus
[1:53:21] Christ.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; There's never been anybody like him
[1:53:24] before.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; And somebody typed in a young man, very
[1:53:31] good, smart at physics, typed in and
[1:53:35] Google came up with an answer. And the
[1:53:37] answer was it is impossible
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; to answer such kind of a question.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; But to God everything is possible my
[1:53:48] brother.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; God has the answer. I'm sure when we go
[1:53:52] to the marriage supper of the lamb we
[1:53:53] can ask that question. What was the
[1:53:55] formula you used?
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; And it's very simple.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; He spoke. If you can say to this
[1:54:04] mountain,
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; be moved and you don't doubt in your
[1:54:07] heart, it will move.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; What's your red sea this morning, my
[1:54:10] brother? What's your mountain? What's
[1:54:12] your valley this morning? Rise up again
[1:54:14] as a child of the living God and say,
[1:54:16] "As for my mountain, it has already
[1:54:18] started moving." Right as you walk out
[1:54:20] of this church, walk with your head high
[1:54:22] up and say, "I'm a child of the living
[1:54:25] God.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; I am going with praises of God. I don't
[1:54:29] care how I'm feeling. I don't care how
[1:54:31] bad I am. I don't care how disappointed
[1:54:34] I am, but I'm a child of the living God.
[1:54:36] I am moving forward and speaking the
[1:54:38] word.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; That's the God of William Brennham. He's
[1:54:44] still working in source. May he
[1:54:46] enlighten you more and more. May he rise
[1:54:48] you up to a level that you will be
[1:54:50] rapture ready. I'll be rapture ready.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Driving to Calgary.
[1:54:59] huge farms right now with wheat.
[1:55:04] And as a plant soil scientist myself, I
[1:55:07] know one or two things about it.
[1:55:11] The wheat, the grain has to be at a
[1:55:15] certain moisture level
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; and protein content for it to be taken
[1:55:19] into the can
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; and be stored properly so it doesn't
[1:55:23] spoil. Mhm. Mhm.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; My wife was asking me says, "How come
[1:55:28] all these fields are not harvested yet?"
[1:55:30] I say, "They are waiting. They're
[1:55:31] watching
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; for the wheat to completely ripen
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; and be ready for harvest to put into the
[1:55:39] Ghana."
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; And if that's happening right now, and
[1:55:42] we saw some of them now, they've started
[1:55:44] the combines like that song that say I
[1:55:47] can hear the combines coming. I tell you
[1:55:50] my brother, some of them, they go 24/7
[1:55:52] nonstop harvesting that crop.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; What do you think God is doing right now
[1:55:58] to the bride of Jesus Christ? He's
[1:56:00] combining now. He's going 24/7. Our God
[1:56:03] is a 24/7 God.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; You can approach him any time of the
[1:56:08] day.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; The phone lines are open. You can talk
[1:56:11] to him anytime. My brother, my sister,
[1:56:13] is that kind of a God. Ah, we about to
[1:56:16] be harvested now. I say if you're not
[1:56:19] in, my brother, my sister, you young
[1:56:21] people, get in quickly. Get in quickly.
[1:56:23] Get in quickly and get baptized in the
[1:56:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He's
[1:56:27] calling. He's beckoning right now. If
[1:56:29] you are off a beaten path somewhere,
[1:56:31] come quickly. Come right back. You know,
[1:56:33] repentance is if you're going in this
[1:56:35] direction and you are wrong. All you
[1:56:37] have to do is turn around, start going
[1:56:39] into the right in in the right
[1:56:40] direction. That's all God is looking
[1:56:42] for.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; He won't condemn you. He won't condemn
[1:56:45] me. He asked that woman, "Woman, where
[1:56:48] are thine accusers?
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Looked up and said, "They're all gone."
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; He says, "Neither do I condemn them.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Go away and sin no more,
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; lest the worst thing come upon you."
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; That's a kind of God. He's a God of
[1:57:03] merciful God this morning.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; What's your mountain? What's your What's
[1:57:07] your Red Sea? Watch. They crossed on dry
[1:57:10] ground.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; And what was the time? How much time did
[1:57:14] God calculate for the last one with all
[1:57:19] their belongings for the last one to
[1:57:21] climb up out of that dry ground and for
[1:57:24] him to unleash the water upon the
[1:57:27] children of uh of Pharaoh
[1:57:30] only God knows.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Notice as soon as they crossed over
[1:57:33] there was jubilee in the camp. There was
[1:57:35] a revival in the camp and Miriam took
[1:57:38] the tambourine was playing and and all
[1:57:40] the sisters followed her and there was
[1:57:42] such a jubilee. It didn't take long.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; 3 days
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; of journey.
[1:57:49] Here they were
[1:57:51] without water.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; They were thirsty. They wanted water.
[1:57:56] All of a sudden they come to this body
[1:57:58] of water and and and they tried to drink
[1:58:01] but the bo the water was bitter.
[1:58:04] started complaining and murmuring.
[1:58:08] Brother Paul, my theme this year 2025
[1:58:10] has been
[1:58:13] start stop complaining.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Start claiming.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Stop complaining. Start claiming.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Stop pointing fingers at each other.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Something goes wrong, it's always
[1:58:26] somebody else's fault.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; We don't introspect. We don't know. We
[1:58:30] don't even think whether we are the
[1:58:32] cause.
[1:58:34] of that problem. Let me search my heart.
[1:58:38] And everybody search their heart and
[1:58:41] come to the Lord quickly and say, "Lord,
[1:58:43] forgive me."
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; If a prophet of God could do that and
[1:58:46] ask and say, "God, forgive your stupid
[1:58:48] servant."
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; We can also do that.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother gift that hurts a little
[1:58:56] bit. That's a way of a missionary.
[1:58:58] That's a wear of an evangelist. It's not
[1:59:01] always just oh wiping. But I'm here to
[1:59:04] encourage you, not to shoot you down.
[1:59:06] But if you are wrong, if I'm wrong,
[1:59:07] let's rise up again. Get hold of the
[1:59:09] word of God and say, Lord, here I am. Be
[1:59:11] it unto me according to thy will.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; That's a way of a true believer.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Humility. The way up is down.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Down where? Down on your knees.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; And say, Lord, help thou my unbelief.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; That's what we are here. Oh, something
[1:59:27] goes wrong. work very quick to pull the
[1:59:29] trigger. Blend the pastor. Blend the
[1:59:31] deacons. What about what about me?
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, am I the one that's causing?
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Rise up. Let this church rise up higher,
[1:59:41] higher, higher. I'm not saying you're
[1:59:43] not higher already, but God keeps
[1:59:45] moving. He keeps going higher, higher.
[1:59:47] Because why? We are the Enoch people.
[1:59:49] Keep Enoch kept on walking until God,
[1:59:52] brother Brenam says you're so far where
[1:59:54] you've come from. Where you are going is
[1:59:57] much closer. come up hither
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; until Enoch was taken up.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; We are the type of Enoch. We are not the
[2:00:03] type of Noah, but we are the type of
[2:00:05] Enoch. One day, somebody in here will
[2:00:08] walk off of this earth without dying.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; We will defy gravity.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother G, gravity won't be there.
[2:00:16] It will be there, but we'll defy it
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; as a children of the living God. In a
[2:00:21] moment, in a twinkling of an eye, these
[2:00:23] bow bodies will be changed.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. from mortal to immortality.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; And that's what we're looking for.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; God, if there's anybody in this
[2:00:33] assembly, if there's one going, let it
[2:00:35] be me.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; That should be your prayer. And if one
[2:00:39] says the same another, a whole bunch of
[2:00:41] you will be taken up here
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:00:45] That's where we are. We are the people
[2:00:48] of Revelation 10:7. We are the people of
[2:00:51] Luke uh 17:30. We are the people,
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; of Malachi 456.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; We are the people who can associate
[2:00:59] ourselves and place ourselves right in
[2:01:02] the scripture and say, "Lord, I see
[2:01:04] myself right there. That's me, my Lord.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Start confessing in that way
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; cuz God love to hear your confession."
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; No matter how tough things are, he can
[2:01:16] you can confess it and he can hear that
[2:01:18] confession and he will bring it to pass.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; What's my subject? Move your mountain
[2:01:23] this morning.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Move it.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Move your mountain in your family.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Husband and wife, move that mountain
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; that's in between.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Families, move that mountain.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Whatever trouble, even you as an
[2:01:37] individual, me as an individual.
[2:01:39] Sometimes we are conflicted within
[2:01:41] ourselves.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; And we don't know what to do.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; That's a mountain in itself.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Let that mountain move. House of hell,
[2:01:50] give way to the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:01:52] Christ.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; It's still happening today, my brother,
[2:01:54] my sister.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Move your mountain.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; And Moses cried to the Lord. Say, Lord,
[2:02:00] what do I do? They don't this water is
[2:02:02] not drinkable.
[2:02:04] And God called Moses aside.
[2:02:08] You see that tree over there? Cut that
[2:02:11] tree down
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; and throw it into that body of water.
[2:02:17] Moses did as as as prescribed by the
[2:02:21] Lord
[2:02:23] and he put the water there. I can the
[2:02:26] tree there. I can assume he was the one
[2:02:28] to test the water first.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the water that was bitter
[2:02:35] was turned into sweet water.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; They called that the water of Mara.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Oh brother, if that's the Old Testament.
[2:02:46] Yes. But it's the shadow of things that
[2:02:48] were to come right now. What is that
[2:02:51] water of mara in your life?
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether it's health related
[2:02:57] problems, may God sweeten that and turn
[2:03:00] it into the sweet waters of mara this
[2:03:03] morning. Amen.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Whatever affliction is in your life,
[2:03:07] whatever thoughts, you know, we are in a
[2:03:08] time that people
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; have gone mind crazy
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; get to a stage young and old alike where
[2:03:16] you're talking to yourself. And when you
[2:03:19] asked what you're saying, you don't even
[2:03:21] know what you're talking about.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; You young people serve the Lord with all
[2:03:26] your heart.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Testify. Feel the church.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. M
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; there may come a time
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; that you are looking for your car keys
[2:03:37] and yet they in your hands.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; There may come come a time that you are
[2:03:43] looking for your phone and yet you're
[2:03:44] talking on the phone.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; There may come a time that you will move
[2:03:48] from one room to another and you forget
[2:03:50] what you went there for.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; So while you have your mind serve the
[2:03:54] Lord with all your heart.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; This message is calling for you to serve
[2:03:59] him. Rise up. If you are the people, you
[2:04:01] are the young people with so much energy
[2:04:03] right now. Testify of the goodness of
[2:04:05] God.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Don't be shy of this message at school.
[2:04:08] If they ask you what you believe, you
[2:04:10] tell them you believe this end time
[2:04:12] message that was brought forth by a
[2:04:14] mighty prophet.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; William Mariam Brenham
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; God chose as a vessel
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; to bring the end time message to this. I
[2:04:26] always go wherever I go I say stay with
[2:04:28] the message. Amen.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; If brother gift is not preaching the
[2:04:32] truth, you stay with the truth. You
[2:04:34] don't have to follow what I'm saying.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Stay with the truth, my brother, because
[2:04:38] this truth will reach you home
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; to get you home.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Stand with the message of the hour. We
[2:04:43] don't need another message. We already
[2:04:46] have thus sayeth the Lord.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; We don't need another messenger because
[2:04:52] the church ages are over. Amen.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to these fly by night
[2:04:58] ministers
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; with little little gifts.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can pray for the sick. We have a
[2:05:06] measuring h yard stick now.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Don't come to me and say, "What are you
[2:05:14] feeling? What what's your problem?" And
[2:05:16] all that. No, you tell me what my
[2:05:18] problem is. Right?
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of prophet that I'm
[2:05:22] looking for that if you want to compare,
[2:05:24] you tell me your name is gift marufu and
[2:05:27] and your parents were such and such. You
[2:05:29] were born in such a place. This happened
[2:05:31] 10 years ago to you and if there's sin
[2:05:33] in your life, you did this and that.
[2:05:35] Make it right and you shall be made
[2:05:37] whole.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; That's the prophet of the hour that we
[2:05:41] have heard. Amen.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; A prophet that would tell you because
[2:05:45] God in the Bible says
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; before I formed you in your mother's
[2:05:50] womb, I knew you
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; and I ordained you a prophet. You've
[2:05:54] been ordained to be believers of this
[2:05:56] age. No matter what the devil, whether
[2:05:58] he likes it or not, there's a group of
[2:06:00] people that have been given the ability
[2:06:03] to actually believe it.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; You flash this message to somebody else,
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; no interest because why? There's no
[2:06:12] identification there.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; But to you in your hearts, there's
[2:06:16] identification, my brother, that can
[2:06:18] press your souls right to back to
[2:06:20] eternity.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Now we know where we coming from. We
[2:06:23] know where we at. We know where we are
[2:06:25] going. You can trace this and say, "How
[2:06:27] did this message strike me?"
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Poor little fellow like me in the
[2:06:33] jungles of Africa there.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Quickened my my heart.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. And from that time, I have never
[2:06:42] looked back. My brother, though none go
[2:06:45] with me, yet still I'll follow. I've
[2:06:47] decided to follow Jesus. This message is
[2:06:50] like honey in the rock for me. This
[2:06:52] message is my typost.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; And kept down there
[2:07:00] at the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. We
[2:07:04] got into the ocean there. We were
[2:07:05] picking muscles
[2:07:07] and they were going to cook for us those
[2:07:09] muscles and they come with salt, sea
[2:07:11] salt.
[2:07:13] And when we went to pluck them out from
[2:07:15] the rock,
[2:07:18] they were so stuck to the rock, you had
[2:07:19] a hard time
[2:07:21] to pluck them out. Some of them were so
[2:07:24] tight, we couldn't pluck them out. On
[2:07:27] Christ, the solid rock I stand.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Be like that muscle and stand right
[2:07:33] there on Christ. And when we tried to
[2:07:37] pluck them out, no ways
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; we did manage to get some for cooking.
[2:07:42] But I couldn't I couldn't help it but
[2:07:44] think if a little creature like that
[2:07:47] would know where to stick itself so that
[2:07:50] when the waves of the Atlantic Atlantic
[2:07:52] Ocean come bashing on the shore, those
[2:07:55] things are still intact.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; They won't move. They won't bite for
[2:07:59] nothing. What about you and me as a
[2:08:01] Christian standing on the rock Christ
[2:08:04] Jesus this morning? We can stay right
[2:08:06] there and say he's certain I'm not
[2:08:08] moving no matter how many trials and
[2:08:10] tribulations. Brother Brandham says the
[2:08:13] best thing that ever happened to a
[2:08:15] Christian is trials and tribulations.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; You can search it out.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like
[2:08:25] to live with you
[2:08:28] cuz I know
[2:08:30] that before I preach that I feted my
[2:08:34] thoughts
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; through the urum thumb
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; which is the message of the hour
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; and when it pleases him and that I know
[2:08:43] I'm in line
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; then like brother Brennham says I've
[2:08:46] preached what Paul preached
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; I can also say I've preached what
[2:08:49] brother Brennham preached.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:52] exposition of seven church ages. You
[2:08:54] know, there are no paragraphs in there,
[2:08:56] but I'll drop in where it says, "Now
[2:08:58] remember this. Christ in the true church
[2:09:03] is a continuation of the book of Acts."
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; There we are.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Are we different from the old time
[2:09:12] saints? No, sir.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; This message is one. Amen.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation shows how
[2:09:20] that the antichrist spirit would come
[2:09:23] into the church and defile it,
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; making it look warm.
[2:09:30] Brother Brenham says this,
[2:09:32] "The first Eve fell
[2:09:36] because the enemy got to her first.
[2:09:39] The second Eve fell because the enemy
[2:09:43] got to her first. But this third ef will
[2:09:47] not fall.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; That's you and me, my brother.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Because why? The word got to her first.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation shows that
[2:09:58] and and making it look formal and
[2:10:00] powerless.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. It exposes Satan, revealing his
[2:10:05] work, attempted destruction of God's
[2:10:07] people, and the discrediting of God's
[2:10:09] word
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; right down to the time he's cast into
[2:10:13] the lack of fire. He fights that. He
[2:10:16] cannot stand it. He knows that if the
[2:10:19] people get the true revelation
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; of the true church,
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; right,
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; and what it is, what she is, what she
[2:10:27] stands for, and that she can do greater
[2:10:31] works,
[2:10:32] She will be an invincible army.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; You know invincible I went to searching
[2:10:39] on that word. It means undefeated.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Can never be defeated.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; If they get a true revelation of the two
[2:10:47] spirits within the framework of the
[2:10:49] Christian church and by God's spirit
[2:10:51] design and withstand the antichrist
[2:10:54] spirit, Satan will be powerless before
[2:10:57] her. Amen.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; He will be as definitely thwarted today
[2:11:01] as when Christ withtood his his every
[2:11:04] effort to gain power over him in the
[2:11:07] desert.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, Satan hates revelation, but we love
[2:11:11] it.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; With true revelation in our lives, the
[2:11:15] gates of hell cannot prevail against us,
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; but we will prevail over them.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; I wanted to leave you with that.
[2:11:25] You will prevail over every devil, every
[2:11:29] enemy. If you're a child of God, speak
[2:11:31] the word. Mountain, move out of the way.
[2:11:34] I'm a child of the living God. And that
[2:11:37] mountain will have to give way. The Red
[2:11:39] Sea in your life in front of you will
[2:11:41] have to give way. Whatever the devil
[2:11:43] has, whatever mechanization, I hear the
[2:11:46] Bible says no weapon,
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah,
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; no weapon formed against you shall
[2:11:52] prosper. Yes, the weapons will be formed
[2:11:54] against you, but they will not prosper.
[2:11:56] The Bible says,
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; that's the declaration of the Lord Jesus
[2:12:01] Christ.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Don't you love the Lord this
[2:12:04] morning to know you on the winning side?
[2:12:06] To know that you can move your mountain,
[2:12:08] whatever it is on a daily basis, you're
[2:12:11] a winner.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; I'm a winner.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Speak the word and move forward.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; God bless you, church of the living God.
[2:12:19] May God, Almighty God, watch over you,
[2:12:21] every family. And if we don't meet on
[2:12:24] this side of the world, may we meet
[2:12:26] across each other at the marriage supper
[2:12:28] of the lamb. I honestly believe that
[2:12:31] every prophecy that has been spoken in
[2:12:33] this hour will come to pass.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Just the way it's been said.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; I don't care what internet is a wash
[2:12:41] with people criticizing this message and
[2:12:43] the messenger. I am saying they are too
[2:12:46] late, my brother. They might burn our
[2:12:48] Bibles. They might take the message
[2:12:50] books away from us, but they will not
[2:12:52] take that which is in my heart already.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; I've been born again.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; And if anybody asks you just who I am,
[2:13:00] tell them I am redeemed
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; cuz I've been purchased and bought of
[2:13:04] the blood of Jesus Christ this morning.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad to be identified as one of
[2:13:09] them. One of them. I'm so glad to be
[2:13:12] identified that in this hour I'll be an
[2:13:15] overcomer. I'm already an overcomer.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says those whom he
[2:13:20] forneew, he already predestinated. And
[2:13:22] those he predestinated, he he he
[2:13:25] justified as if you never did anything.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Those he justified, he sanctified. And
[2:13:30] those he sanctified, he has already
[2:13:31] glorified right now, not tomorrow. You
[2:13:34] are already glorified this morning.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; The Bible says it does not appear what
[2:13:40] we shall be. But now are we sons and
[2:13:43] daughters of God. Oh yeah. They might
[2:13:45] laugh at us. You sisters, they might
[2:13:48] laugh at how you dress and how you do
[2:13:49] your hair. Just stand right there.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; And say, "I'm a child of the living God.
[2:13:55] I was born for a testimony in this hour
[2:13:58] that we live in. I don't care what you
[2:14:00] look at me, how you look at me, what I
[2:14:02] care about it, how he looks at me."
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; That's what we should be about our
[2:14:07] father's business this morning.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. One of them, one of them as the
[2:14:11] musicians would come. I'm so glad that I
[2:14:13] can say I'm one of them.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that you're one of them
[2:14:17] this hour
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; that you can say, "Lord, I'm in that
[2:14:20] number that John saw."
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my sister.
[2:14:33] One of them. One of them.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Don't look at your yesterday. Don't even
[2:14:40] worry about your tomorrow today.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; God has you covered.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Don't look at your setbacks of
[2:14:47] yesterday. Rather make those setbacks
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; be setups for comebacks so you can
[2:14:56] bounce back again and give victory and
[2:14:58] say your testimony of how God has been
[2:15:01] good to you.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:05] One of them.
[2:15:08] One of them.
[2:15:11] I can And I can say I'm one of them.
[2:15:17] Oh, one of them.
[2:15:21] One of them.
[2:15:24] I'm so glad I can say,
[2:15:28] "Oh, one of them.
[2:15:34] One of them.
[2:15:35] [Music]
[2:15:37] I'm so glad
[2:15:39] I'm one of them.
[2:15:43] Oh, one.
[2:15:49] I'm so glad that I can say
[2:15:56] there are people
[2:15:58] [Music]

[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Did the Lord speak to your heart this
[2:18:37] morning?
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Then I have just one question for you.
[2:18:42] Are you ready to take your God-given
[2:18:44] position and start speaking to your
[2:18:45] condition? Amen.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Are you able to flounce your identity
[2:18:50] before the devil
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; and speak to your situation this
[2:18:53] morning?
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not calling for a prayer meeting.
[2:18:57] But if that God who spoke this morning
[2:18:59] is your personal God, then you can
[2:19:01] approach him anytime, anywhere.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; And so now you have the word in your
[2:19:06] hand, he's spoken to you, you have a
[2:19:08] right to take his word back to him.

[2:19:31] word.

[2:19:36] this,
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; is that you assume your position and
[2:19:40] speak to your condition.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You speak to the condition at
[2:19:43] home, the condition at school, the
[2:19:46] condition at church, the condition at
[2:19:48] work, everywhere. You speak to the
[2:19:49] condition.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; This is our call for this season. Praise
[2:19:54] the name of the living God.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Um let's bow our hearts before him.

[2:25:52] just to distract us from these precious
[2:25:54] promises.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; The best blow you can give to the devil
