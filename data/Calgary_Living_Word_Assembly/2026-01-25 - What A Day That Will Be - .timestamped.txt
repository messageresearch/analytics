[2:31] Oh, what a day.
[2:34] Glorious day

[3:19] Oh, hallelujah.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, it will be a reality. It is a
[3:24] reality.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are walking in. Amen.
[3:28] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandon one time will
[3:29] tell us a story
[3:31] about a violin.
[3:34] There was a violin that was at an
[3:36] auctioneer and
[3:39] you know the violin was was being
[3:42] auctioned and people making offers on
[3:45] it.
[3:46] $1, $2, $3
[3:51] seem to have no value in us.
[3:55] You see, the violin was dirty and dusty
[3:57] and and it just just lying there.
[4:02] But you see one day the master walked
[4:04] in.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; You see the one that that could play it,
[4:12] &gt;&gt; the one that knew about music,
[4:16] &gt;&gt; the one that knew about symphonies,
[4:20] &gt;&gt; he walked in
[4:23] and he picked up that violin and it
[4:26] began to dust us,
[4:29] began to clean us.
[4:31] Then he began to play some music.
[4:35] As he began to play some music,
[4:39] the offer came back again.
[4:42] From $1, it began to go to a,000,
[4:45] 2,000,
[4:46] 3,000.
[4:49] Encourage you to say it this morning to
[4:50] say the master is here.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; He's the composer of your life.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; He knows how to play it.
[5:01] Maybe you may feel like you've gotten
[5:03] dusty or may maybe feel like you've lost
[5:06] value of of who you really are. But let
[5:09] me say the master is here.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; He can pick up that violin.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; He can begin to dust it off. And
[5:17] &gt;&gt; play the symphony.
[5:19] Play the music that he wants to play
[5:21] through your life.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; You are of a great value.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; You are of a great value. Yes.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Don't let the enemy tell you anything
[5:29] else.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; You are of a great value.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; Arise and shine.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; This is you season, church. This gross
[5:41] darkness and we see it all around us,
[5:44] but there's still light.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; And you are the light
[5:48] &gt;&gt; by the vindicated words of this day and
[5:51] of this hour.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; You may help me to believe that this
[5:54] morning.
[5:55] I'm going to say, "Lord, here I am. Take
[5:58] my violin.
[6:00] Begin to play. Begin to play the music
[6:04] that you want played out of my life and
[6:06] let it glorify you."
[6:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; We want no glory in this. We don't want
[6:10] to be like Lucifer. We want to glorify
[6:13] you again.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song?
