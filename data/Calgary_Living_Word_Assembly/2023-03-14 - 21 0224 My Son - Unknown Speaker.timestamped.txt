[17:23] should be called the sons of God
[17:26] therefore the world knoweth us not
[17:29] because it knew him not

[17:34] now are we the sons of God
[17:36] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[17:39] be but we know that when he shall appear
[17:43] we shall be like him
[17:45] for we shall see him as he is
[17:50] let's just turn back over to Isaiah

[18:11] but now thus saith the Lord that created
[18:14] thee
[18:15] oh Jacob and he that formed thee o
[18:18] Israel

[18:38] they shall not overflow thee
[18:41] will thou walketh through the fire Thou
[18:44] shalt not be burned
[18:45] neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee
[18:49] for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One
[18:53] of Israel thy savior
[18:55] I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and
[18:59] siba for thee

[19:39] for I have created him
[19:41] for my glory
[19:43] I have formed him yea
[19:46] I have made him
[19:48] let's just bow in prayer once again
[19:52] oh gracious Heavenly Father
[19:55] Lord Jesus to read these scriptures and
[19:58] to know by revelation
[20:00] the magnitude of what they're saying
[20:03] father I pray that tonight you would
[20:05] just expound upon this word
[20:08] Lord that you would just break it open
[20:10] fresh to us Lord
[20:12] that father that there wouldn't be
[20:14] anyone whose eyes would roll and say
[20:16] we've just read the same scripture over
[20:19] again but Lord Jesus that you would take
[20:22] it and make it fresh and new for us Lord
[20:24] that you would just help us to express
[20:26] that heart desire Lord that you have
[20:29] placed in US father
[20:31] Lord that we could recognize who we are
[20:34] so that this Rapture can go father I
[20:37] pray that we could all just pull our
[20:39] licks of fire together tonight Lord and
[20:40] that the speaker and the hearer could be
[20:43] one that it would be in your spirit Lord
[20:45] Jesus that we would be together in one
[20:47] mind and one Accord
[20:49] For Your Glory we just ask all these
[20:52] things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[20:55] God bless you tonight you may be seated
[20:59] try not to get too excited and preach
[21:01] too long tonight I just want to go back
[21:04] and and talk about what we were at on
[21:07] Sunday being loosed from sin
[21:09] and I just feel impressed to read this
[21:11] paragraph 120
[21:14] you know out of Romans is what brother
[21:16] Bradham is reading
[21:18] really he's he's speaking to and uh
[21:21] he reads the scripture
[21:24] wrote or quotes it Romans 8 33 and 34.
[21:27] he says There It Is death gave us the
[21:29] blood the blood has loosed us
[21:32] there is now no condemnation
[21:35] How can there be
[21:38] and there's no no condemnation to the
[21:40] sons and the daughters of God to his
[21:42] children is what he's talking about here
[21:44] just for those people who who don't know
[21:46] and I just want to say this I'll stop
[21:48] right here if there's anybody new in our
[21:51] midst virtually welcome I trust that the
[21:53] Lord will speak to you that you'll feel
[21:55] welcome and uh
[21:57] we'll get to know you soon sooner or
[22:00] later
[22:01] he goes on to say there is nothing to be
[22:03] condemned for
[22:05] we are free Guiltless don't listen to
[22:08] man listen to the word
[22:10] you are loosed by the blood
[22:13] don't get tied down again by traditions
[22:15] and Creeds and organizations don't be
[22:17] led astray by listening to those that
[22:20] deny the power of the word
[22:22] and deny that Jesus saves heals and
[22:25] fills with the Holy Ghost in power
[22:28] you are God's free men loosed by his own
[22:31] blood
[22:32] so brothers and sisters I just would
[22:34] like to start with that tonight don't be
[22:36] bound down with traditions and and
[22:38] teachings and and and cunningly devised
[22:41] fables and and the the the spirits that
[22:45] would try and deceive man to draw them
[22:47] unto men instead of pointing towards
[22:49] Christ
[22:51] there is one one message for our day and
[22:53] that's to get into Christ and not just
[22:56] to get into Christ but to get Christ
[22:57] into you the person of Jesus Christ
[23:00] that's the message of the hour that's
[23:02] what we preach Christ crucified but also
[23:05] resurrected and and not just resurrected
[23:07] in some other dimension somewhere out
[23:09] there but resurrected right here in our
[23:11] hearts in the kingdom of God he said
[23:14] that the kingdom of God is with you but
[23:16] it's it's without observation and that's
[23:19] why people can't see it because it's
[23:20] inside the human being
[23:22] and we are either influenced by one
[23:25] Spirit or the other and there's no
[23:27] middle ground and that's Satan's Eden is
[23:29] to make it sound like there's so many
[23:31] different shades of gray so many
[23:33] different mixtures of the power of God
[23:35] God is is is great in one person and
[23:38] small in another person and and another
[23:40] person is demon-filled another person
[23:42] just has a little bit of of of weird
[23:44] anxiety in their life it's not the way
[23:46] it is it's either God or it's Satan it's
[23:49] one or the other it's like binary code
[23:52] it's one or it's zero
[23:54] there's not a mixture
[23:57] it doesn't work that way God will not
[23:59] share
[24:00] his glory with anyone he doesn't want to
[24:03] share his throne with anyone he will not
[24:05] share his throne with anyone and his
[24:07] throne today is on the throne room of
[24:09] our hearts
[24:11] but brothers and sisters I don't want to
[24:12] go down that far too that road too far
[24:14] tonight I want to talk about being sons
[24:16] of God
[24:17] that's really what I want to talk about
[24:18] and I'll tell you why I I had this this
[24:22] this kind of deviation this morning
[24:25] after my devotions I I had a
[24:28] conversation our youngest son came down
[24:30] stairs from from sleeping the night and
[24:33] uh you know everyone else in the house
[24:34] was gone it was just him and I there
[24:38] and I think as a minister as as human
[24:42] beings as Sons and Daughters of God
[24:44] we've got to go with the leadership of
[24:46] the Lord and I I just I couldn't get
[24:48] away from this all day it just hit me
[24:49] like a truck this morning my youngest
[24:52] son comes downstairs and uh and he's
[24:54] still sleepy and and I said to him
[24:57] you know
[24:58] how about you just come over and why
[25:00] don't you just come and get a good
[25:01] morning hug
[25:02] so happy to see you and and to see his
[25:05] sleepy eyes and just to see my son there
[25:07] you know it just made me feel so good
[25:09] and uh that's how he came over and I
[25:12] gave him a hug and
[25:13] and I said to him you know I sure love
[25:15] you
[25:17] and this has really been on my heart
[25:18] recently you know brothers and sisters
[25:20] how
[25:22] how easy it is to take for granted every
[25:25] single day
[25:27] the Lord's just really been dealing with
[25:29] me on on this level and I I trust that
[25:31] everything is fine but
[25:33] when we leave the house in the morning
[25:35] and we go to work
[25:37] even as Christians even as message
[25:39] Believers even as the bride even as Sons
[25:41] and Daughters of God there's no
[25:42] guarantee that we're coming home again
[25:45] at the end of the day to be with our
[25:46] family
[25:48] there's no guarantee
[25:49] the last time that we leave our house
[25:51] and say goodbye honey
[25:53] that might be the very last time we have
[25:54] the opportunity to use our lips and
[25:56] speak
[25:57] to those people that we love
[26:00] and like I said the Lord's just really
[26:01] been dealing with me on that I guess
[26:03] I've taken it for granted and I've I've
[26:05] gone out and I've worked hard and I've
[26:06] just put my head down and thought you
[26:09] know the kids and the wife and whatever
[26:10] they'll just be fine they'll be there
[26:12] when I get home but what if I don't come
[26:13] home
[26:15] what if they don't come home
[26:17] I'm not saying they will or they won't
[26:19] I'm not trying to say anything weird or
[26:21] prophetic don't get me wrong I'm just
[26:23] saying we can't take for granted these
[26:25] things in our lives
[26:27] maybe it's not our children maybe it's
[26:29] our wives maybe it's just gathering
[26:30] together here before a pandemic hits
[26:34] seeing our brothers and sisters here and
[26:36] then suddenly next week we can't it's
[26:39] over
[26:40] that's what happened here
[26:42] going back to the story this is what
[26:44] inspired me for tonight I see my son he
[26:46] comes down he's sleepy I think look at
[26:48] my boy I just love him so much my
[26:51] heart's just wanting to burst I see my
[26:53] son there come and have a hug son come
[26:55] and fellowship with me and he comes over
[26:57] and he does that and I say to him I love
[26:58] you Christopher I just love you so much
[27:00] and I don't love you any more that I
[27:02] love the others Benjamin and Isaac just
[27:04] for the record but I love you so much
[27:06] and and and he says okay I love you too
[27:09] Daddy and I say you know I'm so proud of
[27:11] you son and he says
[27:14] why are you proud of me Daddy
[27:17] and I'm like wow what kind of a question
[27:19] is that that's great what a good
[27:21] question and and he says to me is it
[27:23] because I'm an expert skier
[27:26] and I'm like what what is that and and
[27:30] Meanwhile my heart's just about to
[27:32] explode because I'm just so so caught up
[27:35] in the moment with my son and I I say to
[27:38] him you know what it is Christopher it's
[27:40] not because of anything it's just
[27:42] because you're my son
[27:44] it's just because you are my son you are
[27:48] an expressed image of me and then I
[27:51] began to think about it what did I just
[27:53] say I don't think I said that I think
[27:55] the Lord said that because it made me
[27:57] think that must be how he looks at his
[27:59] true Sons and Daughters of God it's it's
[28:02] not because we go out and achieve a
[28:05] great test score in in University it's
[28:08] not because we go out and and make
[28:10] millions of dollars it's not because we
[28:12] can preach it's not because we can sing
[28:14] it's not because of anything that we can
[28:16] do there's nothing we can do to Merit
[28:18] the favor of being a son or daughter of
[28:21] God it's just because
[28:24] just because
[28:27] it put me on the floor today it still is
[28:30] oh my goodness I just can't even express
[28:32] it to think about it if we are Sons and
[28:36] Daughters it's only because he chose us
[28:38] it's only because he chose us to be his
[28:41] son
[28:43] I'd like to say that I chose my son to
[28:45] be my son but I didn't but you know what
[28:48] the beautiful thing is we know brother
[28:50] Branham teaches this really well he says
[28:52] that if you're he's your son he was
[28:55] always in you
[28:57] he was always in you when you were a son
[28:59] and and an apple tree has apples on it
[29:03] the fruit and the seeds are in the fruit
[29:04] and and when you look at a seed of an
[29:07] apple
[29:08] for an apple tree all of the potential
[29:10] of that giant apple tree is in that tiny
[29:13] little seed
[29:14] all of the apples that will ever come
[29:16] out of it are in that tiny tiny little
[29:19] seed all of the genetics are already
[29:21] there to look at my son and think that
[29:23] is a very expressed image of me to look
[29:25] at all three of my sons and say wow
[29:28] those are expressed images of me they
[29:31] were always in me they were a part of me
[29:32] and there's no way ever that they could
[29:35] not be a part of me I could try and say
[29:37] no you're not my son no I'm not your dad
[29:40] it doesn't matter what I say or do I
[29:42] could never change that genetic code it
[29:44] is always going to be there and brothers
[29:46] and sisters if you are Sons and
[29:48] Daughters of God there's nothing you can
[29:50] do to change that
[29:53] I guess that's what the Lord is dealing
[29:55] with Me overall if we're Sons and
[29:58] Daughters of God we have nothing to fear
[30:00] because he has all of it under control
[30:03] doesn't matter what comes our way it
[30:04] doesn't matter if things upset in the
[30:06] church it doesn't matter what happens in
[30:08] our families doesn't matter if we don't
[30:10] come home or not God has it all under
[30:12] control
[30:14] I don't even know why I'm talking like
[30:16] that it's so bizarre go on to our
[30:18] scripture tonight over in in first John
[30:21] I just I just felt so blessed to hear
[30:24] that this morning and and not you know
[30:26] just the exchange to think my goodness
[30:28] once upon a time I wanted to rush out
[30:30] the door all the time and just go to
[30:32] work and try and do my best to make it
[30:34] happen now I want to just take the time
[30:36] and see the children and say wow that's
[30:39] my Heritage that's how God is starting
[30:42] to just get maybe a tiny little glimpse
[30:44] of maybe what God thinks about me when
[30:46] he looks at me when I wake up in the
[30:48] morning do I take the time to go and
[30:50] just spend time with him and put my arms
[30:52] around him and say I love you Daddy
[30:54] do I do that my
[30:58] but when I do what's his response
[31:02] can you imagine being able to just go to
[31:05] him and ask whatsoever you will in my
[31:08] name
[31:09] and I'll give it to you
[31:11] wow it's not anything that we can do
[31:14] we're not meriting anything we can't go
[31:16] to him and say well I prayed 14 times
[31:19] in a row every single day on my knees
[31:22] with the lights turned off and nobody
[31:24] there
[31:26] now give it to me that's not the way it
[31:28] works he's not a vending machine no
[31:31] no no no no
[31:33] in chapter 3 verse 1 behold what manner
[31:35] of love the father hath bestowed upon us
[31:38] us and I know I'm talking about Sons
[31:41] tonight specifically because it's
[31:43] scripture and there's you know a message
[31:44] quote for it but but brothers and
[31:47] sisters I want to be clear we're talking
[31:48] about God's children when we say Sons
[31:51] the sons of God we're talking about the
[31:54] Sons and Daughters of God because all of
[31:56] the daughters came out of the sons right
[31:59] we're all one it has to be that way but
[32:02] behold what manner of love the father
[32:04] hath bestowed I took a look at that word
[32:08] bestowed out of the the Noah Webster's
[32:11] Dictionary and it says given
[32:13] gratuitously
[32:15] conferred
[32:16] laid out applied deposited for safe
[32:19] keeping
[32:21] can you imagine that his life his love
[32:24] bestowed upon us
[32:28] for safekeeping
[32:29] that's amazing when you go back though
[32:32] and just a little bit when you look at
[32:33] gratuitously given gratuitously it's
[32:36] it's from the word gratuity is a free
[32:39] gift
[32:40] a present a donation that which is given
[32:44] without compensation or equivalent it's
[32:47] just given as a free gift
[32:49] it's just God's life given unto us and
[32:52] Satan wants us to think that we don't
[32:54] have God's life because look at that
[32:56] thing in your life look at that that
[32:57] that trial or or that trouble or that
[32:59] thing that you just can't seem to get
[33:01] past
[33:02] no no no that's just this flesh we've
[33:04] just bypassed our theophany bodies
[33:07] you know I heard it said and I thought
[33:08] it was so good that our theophany bodies
[33:11] now are exactly on the other side just
[33:14] waiting for us and we have the soul with
[33:18] us but there's going to be a day where
[33:20] we either pass away and our soul goes
[33:22] over there and meets up with that body
[33:23] or our soul just leaves this body and
[33:27] that body comes to the soul and we just
[33:29] see that meeting in the air and one day
[33:31] it's gonna happen brothers and sisters
[33:33] it's gonna happen it's imminent
[33:36] but that word bestowed given
[33:38] gratuitously just a free gift it's a
[33:41] present it's a donation and it's
[33:44] conferred
[33:45] to the part of the definition is
[33:47] conferred for the word bestowed confer
[33:50] to give or or bestow it says this is now
[33:53] uh Noah Webster's um I guess I don't
[33:56] even know what you'd call it someone
[33:57] would probably know what this term is
[33:58] it's it's a little write-up it's a
[34:00] paragraph about the description of this
[34:02] word maybe it's just a description of
[34:03] the word but the word conferred confer
[34:06] to give or to bestow he says this word
[34:09] is particularly used to express the
[34:12] grant of favors
[34:14] benefits and privileges
[34:17] to be enjoyed
[34:19] or rights which are permanent
[34:22] all of that coming out of the word
[34:24] bestowed behold what manner of love the
[34:27] father hath bestowed upon us what manner
[34:30] of love the father has has given us to
[34:33] grant us favors and benefits and
[34:35] privileges to be enjoyed because their
[34:38] rights which are permanent
[34:40] imagine that Sons and Daughters of God
[34:42] obtaining their inheritance realizing
[34:44] who they are
[34:46] you know you look at Kings in the world
[34:48] in the natural type you see Kings and
[34:51] they have queens and they have princes
[34:54] and and princesses there comes a point
[34:57] in time where those children realize
[34:59] that they have authority and they have
[35:01] rights
[35:02] and they're not like everyone else
[35:05] and you know Naturally Speaking what it
[35:07] does is it Puffs people up it puts
[35:09] people into a different state very
[35:10] rarely are they not puffed up it's
[35:14] almost not even possible for them
[35:16] because they live in a different world
[35:17] but you know it's the opposite with a
[35:19] Christian when they actually get that
[35:21] Life of Christ in them that realization
[35:23] sets in that I don't have anything to
[35:25] fear because I know who I am and I know
[35:28] what I'm raised up for
[35:30] it's that original life that lives out
[35:32] through me and that's God's own life
[35:35] but to think about it it's it's it's
[35:37] it's Privileges and benefits and rights
[35:41] which are to be permanent and like we
[35:44] said on Sunday this is just really
[35:46] starting to take hold with me just in my
[35:49] life and my Ministry how amazing it is
[35:52] how God chooses words very specifically
[35:55] these men that wrote the Bible were not
[35:57] the authors
[35:59] they're scribes they're they're men that
[36:01] God chose to scribe out the words and
[36:04] those words that were translated through
[36:07] all the years many people would say
[36:08] today oh you know there's many versions
[36:10] of the Bible and many different
[36:12] different discussions about that but
[36:15] it's no it's no accident that we have
[36:18] the exact translation that we do that
[36:20] the prophet of God would send for this
[36:21] age that he would choose the King James
[36:23] version it's no accident that we had a a
[36:26] scholarly man like brother Lee Vale to
[36:28] be the the grammarizer for the church
[36:31] age book all of these words that we talk
[36:33] about and that we hear they're for a
[36:35] very specific purpose
[36:37] and to look at them like this I think
[36:38] for me it's just it's it's like the
[36:40] burst of a Roman Candle it's like one
[36:42] goes and then it bursts and then another
[36:44] one bursts from that one and it's it's
[36:46] amazing for me
[36:48] just to look at this but to think about
[36:50] this this love of the father that he's
[36:53] bestowed upon us that we should be
[36:55] called the sons of God he's deposited
[36:57] for safe keeping
[36:59] in his sons and todders
[37:01] behold what manner of love the father
[37:03] hath bestowed upon us that we should be
[37:06] called the sons of God therefore the
[37:08] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[37:10] not and if we recall a real real real
[37:14] famous scripture I would say something
[37:16] that brother Ken said a lot of he said
[37:19] herein is our love made perfect this is
[37:21] a little further that we may have
[37:22] boldness in the day of judgment because
[37:24] as he is
[37:26] so are we in this world
[37:30] we're not just
[37:32] Barry Johnson
[37:34] we're not just brother so and so sister
[37:37] so and so we are literally the
[37:40] manifestation
[37:42] of the sons of God
[37:43] his life
[37:46] his children
[37:47] and and there's no way that those those
[37:50] genes can be changed there's no way that
[37:52] it can ever be changed
[37:54] I just keep getting off on tangents
[37:56] forgive me brother Bradham says in
[37:57] things that are to be in 1965
[38:00] now the only way that you can be a son
[38:02] or a daughter of God
[38:05] because you have to be have to have
[38:09] eternal life
[38:10] and there's only one form of eternal
[38:12] life and that's God's life
[38:16] he says only one form of eternal life
[38:18] that was God
[38:21] there to be a son of God
[38:23] you had to be in him always
[38:27] the gene of your life spiritual life
[38:30] tonight
[38:32] was in God the Father amen before there
[38:35] was even a molecule see
[38:37] foreign
[38:39] God's own life brothers and sisters and
[38:42] you are nothing
[38:43] I just love this you are nothing but the
[38:47] manifestation of the gene of life that
[38:50] was in God as a son of God
[38:55] sons of God he says now you're expressed
[38:58] after his word has come into you to
[39:02] light up this age
[39:04] it hasn't come into us just so that we
[39:07] can say high five we're Sons and
[39:09] Daughters of God we've got a special
[39:11] club that we attend and we've got
[39:13] privileges that are permanent no it's so
[39:17] that we can light up this age with his
[39:19] life
[39:20] and show people that Jesus Christ is the
[39:23] same yesterday today and forever that
[39:25] there is a god with skin on there is
[39:27] someone that actually cares for you
[39:34] you are the expressing God's life in you
[39:36] because you are a son or daughter of God
[39:39] I'll just go back and read the paragraph
[39:41] now you're expressed after his word has
[39:43] come into you to light up this age you
[39:46] are the expressing God's life in you
[39:48] because you are a son or a daughter of
[39:50] God
[39:51] therefore
[39:53] you get what I mean see
[39:56] you are now made you're setting in this
[39:58] church tonight because your duty is to
[40:01] express God to this nation
[40:03] and this people
[40:05] and this neighborhood where you
[40:07] associate
[40:09] Wherever You Are
[40:11] God knew
[40:12] that you would be here
[40:15] because you have to be one of his genes
[40:18] or his attributes you had to be
[40:21] I love that if you ever if you've got to
[40:24] turn a life then it always was eternal
[40:27] life and God before there was a
[40:29] foundation of the world knew that you
[40:32] would be here
[40:34] it just takes all the pressure off when
[40:36] you can zoom out and start to look at at
[40:39] at the entirety of of life from this
[40:42] perspective
[40:44] it just takes all the pressure off
[40:46] and God before there was a foundation of
[40:48] the world knew that you would be here
[40:49] and when the word or the water the
[40:52] washing of the water of the word fell
[40:55] upon you
[40:57] you it expressed in a being
[41:03] not just any being brothers and sisters
[41:05] Sons and Daughters of God
[41:07] now you have fellowship with your father
[41:10] God just as you have with your Earthly
[41:13] father see
[41:14] I just
[41:16] this just does it for me to think about
[41:18] what happened the exchange this morning
[41:20] just to see my son and have that
[41:22] Revelation that oh my and then to look
[41:25] it up and hear him say this now you have
[41:27] fellowship with your father God just as
[41:29] you have with your Earthly father see
[41:31] you are citizens of the king not
[41:33] citizens but you are children Sons and
[41:36] Daughters of the Living God if it be
[41:38] that eternal life dwells in you
[41:43] it's not just I've got a ticket to
[41:45] Heaven I've got the token
[41:48] it's not that it's not that I'm
[41:50] associated with the church and I'm I'm
[41:52] just God eternal life because I believe
[41:54] that Jesus Christ died and rose again
[41:56] yeah
[41:58] we do
[41:59] but remember
[42:01] brother Branham didn't come to this
[42:03] world to just preach to everyone
[42:05] he didn't come to this world just to
[42:07] talk to the ten virgins he came to this
[42:10] world to talk to the five wise virgins
[42:14] and we're talking about the five wise
[42:16] virgins tonight those ones that realize
[42:18] they are truly the genetic Gene seed of
[42:21] God if they have eternal life in them
[42:23] they had it from before the foundation
[42:25] of the world not because of anything
[42:26] they've done not because of anything
[42:28] they could ever do or or could ever even
[42:30] imagine it's just because God chose them
[42:32] and that in itself when that Revelation
[42:35] breaks forth and sets in to a son and
[42:38] daughter of God it changes everything
[42:39] about them everything about them if they
[42:42] had air in their tires that air gets let
[42:44] out right now it doesn't puff people up
[42:46] it brings people down to earth and shows
[42:48] them that it's only by God Sovereign
[42:50] Grace that we have the ability to
[42:53] understand those things
[42:55] we can see a lot of people now that are
[42:58] cloaked in in religion
[43:00] they've got big fig leaves covering
[43:02] their bodies and they're not afraid to
[43:05] actually show it and they're not afraid
[43:07] to actually destroy people using the
[43:10] word
[43:11] you know what God didn't send Jesus to
[43:13] the Earth
[43:15] God didn't come to the Earth in Jesus
[43:19] to destroy people he came to the Earth
[43:22] to save people and he didn't come to the
[43:26] Earth to minister to the most religious
[43:29] folks of the day he actually came to
[43:32] condemn those ones
[43:33] he came to save the sinners
[43:38] I just love this quote I'm going to say
[43:39] it again now you have fellowship with
[43:42] your father God
[43:43] just as you have with your Earthly
[43:45] father see
[43:47] you are citizens of the king
[43:50] not citizens but you are children Sons
[43:53] and Daughters of the Living God if it be
[43:56] that that eternal life dwells in you
[43:59] we don't ever want to take for granted
[44:01] brothers and sisters any moment of any
[44:03] day when we have an opportunity to look
[44:06] at someone we love
[44:07] and just tell them that we love them
[44:10] because we never know
[44:12] we never know
[44:14] we might have to wait until we get over
[44:16] Yonder to be able to say it but you know
[44:18] the Bible speaks about the sons of God
[44:21] I'll just go through these quickly for
[44:23] time's sake here in Genesis 6 talking
[44:25] about the sons of God Genesis 6 verse 2.
[44:29] that the sons of God saw the daughters
[44:31] of men that they were Fair
[44:33] and they took them wives of all which
[44:36] they chose
[44:38] and the Lord said my spirit shall not
[44:40] always strive with man
[44:42] for that he is also flesh yet his days
[44:45] shall be 120 years there were giants in
[44:48] the earth in those days and also after
[44:50] that when the sons of God came in unto
[44:52] the daughters of men and they bear
[44:54] children unto them and the same Mighty
[44:57] Men which were of old men of renown
[45:00] and God saw the wickedness of man was
[45:03] great in the earth and that every
[45:05] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[45:09] was only evil continually
[45:12] brothers and sisters were not very far
[45:13] away from that right now
[45:15] if if not there entirely right now
[45:19] I remember in Noah's day there was only
[45:21] eight Souls that were saved and that was
[45:23] only because they actually received the
[45:24] message for their day
[45:26] they knew that it was it was either get
[45:28] in the boat or you're going to perish
[45:31] and uh I'm not going to go down that
[45:33] road tonight we're talking about the
[45:34] sons of God
[45:36] and uh you know just this little sidebar
[45:38] how the thoughts of his heart in the
[45:40] hearts of men was only evil continually
[45:42] and what we're talking about there isn't
[45:45] necessarily murders
[45:47] and drunkenness and and and and and bad
[45:51] evil things like that
[45:53] we're talking about unbelief the word is
[45:56] talking about anything but the word of
[45:58] God
[45:59] anything but the word of God but the
[46:01] truth is evil and that's what he's
[46:04] talking about here
[46:05] in job one
[46:07] verse six now there was a day when the
[46:09] sons of God came to present themselves
[46:11] before the Lord
[46:12] and Satan came also among them
[46:15] job 2 again there was a day when the
[46:18] sons of God came to present themselves
[46:20] before the Lord and Satan came also
[46:22] among them to present himself before the
[46:24] Lord
[46:25] in Job 38 verse 4.
[46:28] this is this is
[46:30] Elohim this is the god almighty speaking
[46:32] to job now out of the Whirlwind where
[46:34] was thou when I laid the foundations of
[46:36] the earth declare if thou Hast
[46:38] understanding who hath laid the measures
[46:40] thereof if thou knowest or who hath
[46:43] stretched the line upon it
[46:45] whereupon are the foundations thereof
[46:47] fastened or who laid the Cornerstone
[46:49] thereof
[46:51] and and this is the the verse that I
[46:52] wanted to get to but just to paint the
[46:54] picture to think that the Lord Of Glory
[46:56] is expressing it to man to his son
[46:59] where were you when all of that was
[47:02] created when I did all of that where
[47:04] were you
[47:05] trying to get his attention so that he
[47:07] would come to that that realization
[47:09] remember how the prophet says it that
[47:12] there came a point where that lightning
[47:14] flashed and and the Thunder cracked and
[47:17] and he said you know I I know my
[47:20] redeemer lives because even though the
[47:22] skin worms they destroy this flesh I
[47:25] will stand and see
[47:27] my Lord
[47:29] but verse 7 says when the morning Stars
[47:31] sang together and all the sons of God
[47:33] shouted for joy
[47:35] think of that picture right there when
[47:37] the morning Stars sang together and the
[47:39] son all of the sons of God showed up for
[47:41] Joy so it's not even just a group of
[47:44] sons of God brothers and sisters it's
[47:46] talking about an eternal
[47:48] all sons of God if you are a son of God
[47:51] today and you have eternal life today
[47:52] then you were there in that scripture
[47:55] you were right there in God when the
[47:58] morning Stars sang together and all of
[48:00] the sons of God shouted for Joy that's
[48:03] why when we I don't know when we start
[48:04] to think about election and that's part
[48:06] of this that's probably the main part of
[48:08] it the I don't even know what you'd call
[48:10] it the background thought of election
[48:12] brothers and sisters to think that he
[48:14] has called us it's not just like God
[48:16] just had children and suddenly he's got
[48:18] this great son that he just loves and
[48:21] and starts to love him more and more and
[48:22] starts to fellowship and get to know him
[48:24] he knew all about us before the
[48:26] foundation of the world he created us
[48:28] and formed him formed Us in him
[48:32] it's just amazing to think about this is
[48:34] election we're talking about it's it's
[48:36] not just being a son or a daughter of
[48:38] God he he elected us to be exactly who
[48:41] we are with all of the faults and
[48:43] failures that we have so that we can lay
[48:46] down our will and overcome all of those
[48:48] to create the character that we need to
[48:50] be fit to rule and Reign to sit with him
[48:52] in his throne which no other age has
[48:55] that promise
[48:58] in in in John 1 verse 10 he was in the
[49:02] world and the world was made by him
[49:06] and the world knew him not
[49:09] and he came unto his own and his own
[49:12] received him not
[49:14] but as many as received him to them gave
[49:18] he power
[49:20] to become the sons of God
[49:22] [Music]
[49:23] even to them that believe on his name
[49:29] and I love how he just expresses this he
[49:32] switches it from being
[49:34] almost carnal to being spiritual he goes
[49:38] on to say in verse 13.
[49:40] which were born not of blood nor of the
[49:44] will of Flesh
[49:45] nor of the will of man
[49:47] but of God
[49:50] I'm just going to back up and read read
[49:52] this again and and we'll we'll stop
[49:54] there and just examine this for a second
[49:56] here
[49:57] he came unto his own and his own
[49:59] received him not but as many as received
[50:01] him to them gave he power to become the
[50:05] sons of God even to them that believe on
[50:07] his name which were born not of blood
[50:09] not of the will of Flesh nor the will of
[50:12] man but of God
[50:15] and then one of the most famous verses
[50:17] that we know and the Word was made flesh
[50:21] and dwelt Among Us and you know this
[50:25] this is a really familiar scripture and
[50:27] and we're probably not going to get too
[50:29] far into it tonight but you know what if
[50:31] we're Sons and Daughters of God then we
[50:33] truly are the manifestation of the Lord
[50:35] Jesus Christ on Earth today we are his
[50:39] fleshly image on Earth today and that's
[50:41] what stumbles the world that's why
[50:43] brother Branham said that when the
[50:45] church recognizes what it is
[50:47] literally flesh the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:50] his Spirit raised that raised up Jesus
[50:53] from the dead living out through me
[50:54] quickening all of our mortal bodies
[50:56] because it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:59] spirit in US
[51:00] we're not ourselves we're no longer the
[51:03] same creatures we're new creatures in
[51:05] Christ Jesus
[51:07] remember this now and the Word was made
[51:10] flesh and dwelt Among Us Jesus Christ
[51:13] the same yesterday today and forever
[51:18] and we beheld his glory how many times
[51:20] brothers and sisters do we get in a good
[51:22] service or in a real good prayer meeting
[51:24] with the Lord Jesus Christ and we have
[51:26] that that morning moment where we can
[51:28] just put our arms around the Lord and
[51:30] just say I love you Daddy how many times
[51:32] do we see his glory do we behold his
[51:35] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[51:38] of the father full of grace and truth
[51:40] those moments that you can't even
[51:42] explain to someone because you know it's
[51:45] just you and God and when he speaks to
[51:47] you sovereignly you just speak back and
[51:49] say blessed be the name of the Lord that
[51:52] you would call me a Son of God behold
[51:55] what manner of love the father hath
[51:57] bestowed upon me that I should be called
[51:59] The Son of God I never did nothing I'm a
[52:02] rat from from the gutter if I look at
[52:05] myself as a human being
[52:07] but that's not the way he sees me
[52:09] he sees me as a direct image of his own
[52:12] jeans why Hallelujah
[52:16] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[52:18] among us and we beheld his glory the
[52:21] glory as of the only begotten of the
[52:24] father full of grace and truth I just
[52:27] love that do we have Grace and Truth are
[52:29] we just full of grace and truth one for
[52:31] the other you know if you go on to read
[52:33] in in first John it says he who says
[52:37] that he loveth his brother but hateth
[52:40] him
[52:41] or loves loves the Lord sorry but hateth
[52:43] is brother is a liar
[52:45] we need to be careful not get caught up
[52:47] in the flesh don't stumble at the Veil
[52:49] if God has chosen someone even if we
[52:52] know that someone might be in error on
[52:54] the word
[52:55] they might have time to grow
[52:58] you never know there's progressive
[52:59] revelation for a prophet there's
[53:00] progressive revelation for other human
[53:02] beings as well nobody's going to fulfill
[53:05] the office of a prophet I'm not saying
[53:07] that but what I am saying is that we all
[53:08] need room to grow Sons and Daughters
[53:10] need to be taught we need to have the
[53:12] ability to learn we need encouragement
[53:13] we've said it before when you're
[53:15] teaching a child to walk and and they
[53:17] stumble and they fall you don't kick
[53:19] them and say get up and walk I told you
[53:22] how to do it no
[53:24] you pick them up and you love them and
[53:26] you encourage them some more and you say
[53:28] come on honey you're an Express image of
[53:31] me and I want to see you just learn to
[53:33] walk I want to see you be free and not
[53:36] be stumbling and crawling and toddling
[53:38] same thing with our brothers and our
[53:40] sisters
[53:41] Romans chapter 8 verse 11 that famous
[53:44] scripture but if the Same Spirit
[53:47] if the spirit of him that raised up
[53:49] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[53:51] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[53:53] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[53:55] spirit
[53:57] that dwelleth in you
[53:59] not that's just going to come to you one
[54:01] day it's it's dwelling in you right now
[54:05] therefore brethren we are not debtors to
[54:07] the flesh to live after the flesh for if
[54:09] you live after the flesh ye shall die
[54:11] don't look at your brother and sister
[54:12] don't look at me don't look at yourself
[54:14] look to Christ look at the word
[54:17] for if you live after the flesh he shall
[54:19] die but if ye through the spirit do
[54:22] mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall
[54:24] live for as many as are led by the
[54:27] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[54:30] bye
[54:32] I have to say that's almost one of my
[54:34] favorite verses right there Romans 8
[54:36] chapter 8 verse 14 for as many as are
[54:39] led by the spirit of God they are the
[54:41] sons of God
[54:43] for ye have not received the spirit of
[54:45] bondage again to fear
[54:47] when your sons and daughters and you
[54:49] know who your daddy is we know who has
[54:51] it all under control we haven't received
[54:53] the spirit of bondage
[54:55] in fear
[54:57] and everything that happens to us when
[54:59] situations arise no we look at the
[55:01] situations and we say blessed be the
[55:03] name of the Lord I know that he's
[55:04] allowed this to come my way because
[55:06] nothing happens on Earth unless there's
[55:09] first a council in heaven unless the
[55:11] devil has to come before the Lord to see
[55:14] if he can actually do something to us
[55:16] remember the story in in job we just
[55:19] glossed right over it I don't really
[55:20] want to go too far into that tonight but
[55:22] Satan came and had a discussion with God
[55:25] and it was God that said to Satan have
[55:27] you considered my servant job
[55:30] you know what you've been up to Satan
[55:32] walking around to and fro up and down in
[55:35] the earth just hanging out seeing whom I
[55:37] can devour
[55:38] like I'm supposed to be according to
[55:40] your word
[55:41] and he says oh really have you
[55:43] considered my servant job you know we
[55:45] just need to step back and look at that
[55:47] scripture and think you know when the
[55:49] Trials come our way when we get right
[55:51] down in the valley just remember that
[55:53] there's a counsel happen in heaven
[55:55] there's a conversation between those two
[55:57] because Satan is still there he still
[56:00] has an audience with almighty God until
[56:03] the time the bride goes up
[56:05] but while he's there don't don't think
[56:07] it's strange think it not strange when
[56:09] the fiery trial comes upon you brothers
[56:11] and sisters because it's as good as gold
[56:13] for us it's the Refiner's Fire in our
[56:16] lives but that's that's that's God
[56:18] potentially saying have you considered
[56:20] my brother Joel if you consider my son
[56:22] Joel down there
[56:24] have you considered my sisters my son my
[56:26] daughter Stella down there you know
[56:29] there's
[56:30] there's someone there that I know you
[56:32] will never get to curse me to my face
[56:33] because they're truly a son and a
[56:35] daughter of the most high God but you
[56:38] know what go ahead and try everything
[56:40] you want but don't take their life can
[56:43] you imagine that there's nothing in this
[56:45] world
[56:46] for us there's nothing in this world for
[56:48] us God is not concerned about all the
[56:51] things in this world what he is
[56:52] concerned about is our souls and if
[56:54] we're willing to give back to him his
[56:57] rightful portion
[56:58] the praise of our lips the the the very
[57:02] essence of our lives our sacred portion
[57:04] if we're willing to give that back to
[57:06] him then he will reward us but brothers
[57:08] and sisters it's only temporal it's only
[57:09] a temporary thing don't get attached to
[57:11] anything down here we don't want that we
[57:14] don't want that we want to be able to go
[57:15] when it's time to go
[57:17] he says in verse 15 for ye have not
[57:19] received the spirit of bondage again to
[57:21] fear but ye have received the spirit of
[57:23] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father
[57:25] Hallelujah Lord I'm so thankful that I
[57:28] can call you Daddy I know that you are
[57:30] my my father and that you have it all
[57:32] under control when I go on my knees and
[57:35] I pray to my heavenly father I know that
[57:37] he hears my prayer and I know that he
[57:39] answers my prayer and all I need to do
[57:41] is just Rejoice because he has it all
[57:44] under control and he knew what prayer I
[57:46] was going to pray he knew why I was
[57:47] going to pray it and he's already
[57:49] answered it and all I need to do is
[57:51] thank him for answering it
[57:53] imagine in the exchange like I just
[57:55] described earlier if if if my son said
[57:58] Daddy I'm hungry I want some breakfast
[58:01] and I said okay
[58:03] and and and he just said to me I'm
[58:05] hungry Daddy get my breakfast can you
[58:07] get my breakfast I'm so hungry Daddy and
[58:09] and just continually go on like that
[58:11] when I already told him okay
[58:13] but I still have to get up off of the
[58:15] couch and walk across the house to go
[58:18] and get the stuff and and make it happen
[58:20] for him we know that God is omnipotent
[58:22] and omnipresent and and all the
[58:25] different omnis there's so many things
[58:27] about God but still there's times where
[58:30] he makes us wait
[58:31] yes sir he wants us to trust him and he
[58:35] doesn't want us to just trust him he
[58:36] wants us to demonstrate our trust in him
[58:39] [Music]
[58:41] and sadly as parents I think we do that
[58:43] to our children I know I do
[58:46] I I want I want them to demonstrate
[58:49] their trust in me sometimes
[58:51] and you know it's kind of like brother
[58:53] Branham gives that example about going
[58:54] across in a wheelbarrow
[58:56] he talks about that story about the
[58:58] pastor
[58:59] going over the the I think it's a board
[59:02] or a rope in a wheelbarrow and and yeah
[59:05] sure Pastor I believe that you could do
[59:06] it on your own you could balance it no
[59:08] problem and I believe that you could do
[59:10] it with weight and and no problem Pastor
[59:12] the pastor says okay now you get in and
[59:15] I'll take you across no no no no no no
[59:17] no
[59:17] [Laughter]
[59:19] God wants us to demonstrate our faith in
[59:21] him brothers and sisters he doesn't want
[59:23] us to just say I believe that's why we
[59:25] get the Fiery trials that's why things
[59:27] happen in our lives we need to ask him
[59:29] for it and just like we've talked about
[59:31] with John Ryan not go and cry about it
[59:34] over and over again go back in the
[59:35] prayer line and say pray for me again
[59:37] anoint me with oil again no no no no no
[59:40] no no Brother Brad I'm gonna say that's
[59:42] all wrong he told John Ryan when he came
[59:44] back in the line
[59:46] he said to him I thought you said I was
[59:48] healed brother Branham what was his
[59:50] response
[59:51] let's remember it wasn't just brother
[59:53] Branham standing there
[59:55] it was the Lord Jesus Christ speaking
[59:57] through him not saying that he was the
[59:59] Lord Jesus Christ standing there it was
[1:00:01] the same Spirit speaking through him his
[1:00:03] voice box he said to him I thought you
[1:00:06] said you believed
[1:00:08] we need to make sure that we're
[1:00:10] demonstrating Faith to the Lord
[1:00:12] if we want to see prayer in action we
[1:00:15] want to see the answers to our prayers
[1:00:16] it was only after John Ryan went I don't
[1:00:19] know for weeks rejoicing acting like a
[1:00:22] fanatic praising God for something that
[1:00:24] nobody else could see he couldn't see it
[1:00:25] he didn't even have sight but by faith
[1:00:27] he had it
[1:00:30] for as many as they're led by the spirit
[1:00:32] of God they are the sons of God are you
[1:00:34] led by the spirit of God tonight
[1:00:35] brothers and sisters
[1:00:37] if you are then you have received the
[1:00:41] spirit of adoption and you have the
[1:00:43] ability to cry Abba Father thank you
[1:00:46] Lord Jesus for saving me thank you Lord
[1:00:48] Jesus for giving me the ability to see
[1:00:51] the word for my day thank you the Lord
[1:00:53] Jesus for giving me all of the needs
[1:00:55] every single need in my life that I have
[1:00:59] and if you have fear brothers and
[1:01:01] sisters remember it's a spirit of
[1:01:03] bondage that's coming upon you that's
[1:01:05] trying to get you you know I I can only
[1:01:07] say that because I've experienced it I
[1:01:10] had fear tremendous fear so much I
[1:01:12] couldn't even breathe I I would have my
[1:01:14] heart would just pound and my pulse
[1:01:16] would just race and and I thought that
[1:01:18] you know what it was I thought that it
[1:01:20] was just me I made a mistake and and and
[1:01:22] I didn't realize that it was a spirit
[1:01:24] until afterwards but blessed be the name
[1:01:26] of the Lord for him to reveal that stuff
[1:01:27] to us that it's actually a spirit of
[1:01:30] fear fear is a spirit if we're afraid
[1:01:33] brothers and sisters let's let's get rid
[1:01:35] of that spirit
[1:01:36] all we have to do is cast it out rebuke
[1:01:38] it in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:01:40] come to him and repent make sure that
[1:01:42] everything is is right in your life as
[1:01:44] good as you can and you might have
[1:01:46] things in your life that you can't go
[1:01:47] and physically make right God knows your
[1:01:49] heart so long as your heart is right
[1:01:52] if your heart is right it doesn't
[1:01:54] condemn you then ask what you will
[1:01:56] we haven't received the spirit of
[1:01:58] bondage again to fear no no no no no no
[1:02:02] we've received the spirit of adoption
[1:02:04] where we know our rights we know that
[1:02:06] we're Sons and Daughters we've been
[1:02:07] given the ability to understand who we
[1:02:09] are why because the spirit itself it
[1:02:12] Bears witness with our spirit that we
[1:02:14] are the children of God we live our
[1:02:17] lives according to the word we don't
[1:02:18] come to church and say I believe the
[1:02:20] message of the hour and I I believe what
[1:02:22] God's word says I believe it all and
[1:02:24] then go into a dirty business deal on
[1:02:26] Monday
[1:02:27] just so I can succeed a little more we
[1:02:30] don't do that we don't go and have just
[1:02:33] the odd odd odd swear word just slip out
[1:02:35] just because we just I just got mad my
[1:02:37] temper it just gets it just gets to me
[1:02:39] it's just my flesh we don't live our
[1:02:41] lives that way we don't just go and and
[1:02:43] do things in the world like worldly
[1:02:45] people do
[1:02:46] the spirit itself beareth witness that
[1:02:49] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:02:51] of God we express the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:53] to this world around us we read it in
[1:02:55] that quote earlier to this dark world
[1:02:57] where the light of Jesus to this world
[1:03:00] in our church in our neighborhoods in
[1:03:03] our schools at our workplace wherever we
[1:03:06] are
[1:03:07] we're expressing the light of the Lord
[1:03:09] Jesus Christ
[1:03:11] if the spirit beareth witness with our
[1:03:13] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:03:15] and if children then heirs Heirs of God
[1:03:17] and join heirs with Christ if so be that
[1:03:19] we suffer with him that we may also be
[1:03:22] glorified together
[1:03:24] to think about that brothers and sisters
[1:03:26] the spirit itself
[1:03:28] we could we could take that word out and
[1:03:30] I I know we're not going to add or take
[1:03:32] away I'm not looking to bring the curse
[1:03:34] of Revelation here but I just want to
[1:03:36] just throw this one word in here just
[1:03:39] for the sake of discussion tonight the
[1:03:41] spirit himself
[1:03:43] not itself let's let's change it just a
[1:03:46] little bit so that we can look at it
[1:03:48] from a different perspective that Spirit
[1:03:50] itself comes into our life but it
[1:03:52] changes us into a different person we
[1:03:54] become a new creature so I would say
[1:03:57] this tonight the spirit himself beareth
[1:04:00] witness with our spirit the spirit of
[1:04:03] the Lord Jesus Christ the true baptism
[1:04:05] of the Holy Spirit causes us to live
[1:04:08] different lives well we're truly Sons
[1:04:10] and Daughters of God
[1:04:12] we can't impersonate that
[1:04:14] and if children then we're heirs heirs
[1:04:17] With God all the promises
[1:04:19] every chapter every verse every line all
[1:04:23] of it in the Bible is ours
[1:04:25] we don't have to worry about whether
[1:04:27] we'll have our needs provided for we
[1:04:29] don't have to worry about whether we'll
[1:04:30] have healing in our body you know what
[1:04:32] whether we have healing in our body or
[1:04:35] or whether we live or whether we die
[1:04:36] we're Christ
[1:04:39] and you know what they say brothers and
[1:04:40] sisters I don't know maybe it's because
[1:04:42] I haven't had a life or death situation
[1:04:44] and you know I I can tell you that I
[1:04:46] have had some in my life and maybe one
[1:04:48] day with the testimony service will do
[1:04:50] it but I haven't had a crazy disease or
[1:04:54] anything like that you know thanks be to
[1:04:55] God I'm not going to just dismiss that
[1:04:57] but what I will say is I think it's very
[1:05:01] true what you hear said and and you know
[1:05:03] I don't know I I need to be careful what
[1:05:07] I say I get it but you know what what's
[1:05:09] said
[1:05:10] carnally is that you're not ready to
[1:05:12] live until you're ready to die
[1:05:16] think about David when he went out to
[1:05:18] see Goliath that day
[1:05:20] I don't think that he had any doubt in
[1:05:22] his heart or his mind that he would die
[1:05:25] even though that devil called out to him
[1:05:27] and said I'm going to feed you to the
[1:05:29] birds right
[1:05:31] David had something in him there was a
[1:05:34] spirit of adoption in David
[1:05:37] to go out there and face Goliath
[1:05:40] but I've just felt this for a long time
[1:05:41] and you know what maybe the Lord will
[1:05:43] test me on it and you know what if
[1:05:45] that's his will then I know his will
[1:05:46] will be perfect and it will be for his
[1:05:48] his glory it won't be for me it will be
[1:05:51] all for him but you know I don't believe
[1:05:54] it myself that we're really ready to
[1:05:56] live until we're ready to die until we
[1:05:58] know that we have our Eternal
[1:06:00] destination fixed up when we know that
[1:06:02] whether we live or whether we die we're
[1:06:04] Christ's
[1:06:05] what difference does it make
[1:06:07] of course we want to live a full life
[1:06:10] but think about how free we could live
[1:06:12] our lives if we knew that nothing could
[1:06:15] stop us
[1:06:16] and if nothing can stop us
[1:06:18] if God before us who could be against us
[1:06:20] brothers and sisters
[1:06:23] you know what it is it's fear that
[1:06:24] drives our decisions many times
[1:06:27] fear grips us
[1:06:29] and and we don't need to be afraid we
[1:06:32] don't have to be afraid of what a doctor
[1:06:33] says to us if a doctor says something to
[1:06:36] us you know what it's only going to be
[1:06:38] for for God's glory
[1:06:40] either he's going to take me home
[1:06:42] or he's going to heal me one of the
[1:06:44] other is going to happen only one or the
[1:06:46] other is going to happen he's going to
[1:06:48] heal me or he's going to take me home
[1:06:49] and either way I win and it's going to
[1:06:52] be for a testimony of the Lord
[1:06:55] because that Spirit itself beareth
[1:06:57] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:06:59] children of God
[1:07:03] he goes on to say for I reckon that the
[1:07:05] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:07:07] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:07:08] that shall be revealed where
[1:07:10] in US amen Sons and Daughters of God for
[1:07:14] the earnest expectation of the creature
[1:07:16] wadeth for the manifestation of the sons
[1:07:18] of God all of creation is just groaning
[1:07:22] for us to come to full maturity to come
[1:07:25] to the place where we're not afraid
[1:07:27] where we don't have fear because perfect
[1:07:29] love remember
[1:07:32] perfect love casteth out all fear
[1:07:37] when we have perfect love that's the
[1:07:39] Lord Jesus Christ that's the spirit of
[1:07:41] adoption living out through us
[1:07:43] in Philippians 2 wherefore my beloved
[1:07:45] does ye have always obeyed
[1:07:47] not as in my presence only but now much
[1:07:50] more in my absence work out your own
[1:07:52] salvation with fear and trembling for it
[1:07:54] is God which worketh in you in you both
[1:07:57] to will and do of his good pleasure do
[1:08:00] all things without murmurings and
[1:08:01] disputings that ye may be blameless and
[1:08:04] harmless
[1:08:05] the sons of God
[1:08:08] think about that scripture there
[1:08:10] do all things without murmurings and
[1:08:12] disputings
[1:08:14] murmurings grumbling
[1:08:16] I've got this to do again
[1:08:19] I got to go and deal with them again
[1:08:22] I got to go to church again
[1:08:25] do it without murmurings brothers and
[1:08:27] sisters remember what happened to the
[1:08:28] children of Israel for murmuring
[1:08:30] murmurings in the wilderness didn't go
[1:08:32] well for them do all things he says
[1:08:34] without murmurings and disputings
[1:08:37] getting upset with one another coming
[1:08:39] together and and disputing things having
[1:08:42] arguments and disagreements disputing
[1:08:44] that ye may be blameless and harmless
[1:08:46] because I know Daddy's got it all under
[1:08:49] control I know I know whom I have
[1:08:52] believed and he is able
[1:08:55] to keep that which he has promised amen
[1:08:58] that ye may be blameless and harmless
[1:09:01] the sons of God without rebuke in the
[1:09:03] midst of a crooked and perverse Nation
[1:09:05] among whom ye shine as lights in the
[1:09:08] world
[1:09:09] again talking about being sons and
[1:09:11] daughters that are just shining light
[1:09:13] into this world
[1:09:14] his Spirit living out through Us in
[1:09:17] Investments brother Bradham says no
[1:09:18] wonder Jesus said if he abide in me and
[1:09:20] my word in you then ask what you will
[1:09:22] see the works that I do John 14 12 he
[1:09:25] that believeth confessed and believeth
[1:09:27] on me see the works that I do shall he
[1:09:30] do also because God is in The Believer
[1:09:34] just like he was in Christ
[1:09:38] God is in The Believer just like he was
[1:09:41] in Christ not in the fullness he was in
[1:09:44] Christ
[1:09:45] but he is in you just like he was
[1:09:49] because you are a son of God
[1:09:51] through Jesus Christ
[1:09:54] our words have power brothers and
[1:09:56] sisters
[1:09:57] we need to be super careful I believe
[1:09:59] this with all my heart maybe it's just
[1:10:01] my opinion but
[1:10:03] whatever it's for free
[1:10:04] when we get right with God and
[1:10:07] everything in our life is in perfect
[1:10:08] harmony with the word
[1:10:11] we need to be so careful with our words
[1:10:15] because our words have power
[1:10:18] and we can create things we can cause
[1:10:20] things we can see things happen by our
[1:10:23] words our words we have the creative
[1:10:26] ability brother Bradham says to create
[1:10:28] worlds and go and live on them
[1:10:30] that power is in us right now
[1:10:33] we need to be careful what we say
[1:10:36] he was in Christ but he is in you just
[1:10:39] like he was because you are a son of God
[1:10:42] through Jesus Christ I've got one more
[1:10:44] quote as we close here I'll call the
[1:10:45] musicians up convinced and then
[1:10:47] concerned he says and remember when you
[1:10:50] die
[1:10:51] that Soul leaves you it never changes no
[1:10:54] sir
[1:10:55] death doesn't change the soul it changes
[1:10:57] his dwelling place but it's still the
[1:11:00] same soul
[1:11:01] so if it isn't born again
[1:11:03] and a part of the eternal spirit of God
[1:11:07] it had a beginning
[1:11:09] anything with a beginning has an end
[1:11:14] stand with me tonight if you will
[1:11:18] that's the reason God's the only things
[1:11:21] Eternal unless you're born again and
[1:11:23] have eternal life the Greek word Zoe
[1:11:25] there means God's own life in you you'll
[1:11:29] perish
[1:11:31] but where God's life is in you
[1:11:33] you can no more perish than God can
[1:11:35] perish that's right
[1:11:38] and you know brothers and sisters I'll
[1:11:40] throw this out there
[1:11:41] that's why so many people are afraid
[1:11:44] because they don't know God's own life
[1:11:46] they don't have that Zoe life in them
[1:11:50] because
[1:11:51] if they had it in them
[1:11:54] they'd have perfect love and perfect
[1:11:55] love would cast out fear
[1:11:58] but they don't even realize why they're
[1:12:00] so gripped with fear but it's because if
[1:12:03] they meet their deathbed if they're
[1:12:04] going to have their last breath they
[1:12:06] know deep down inside their subconscious
[1:12:09] knows for sure that they're lost as lost
[1:12:11] can be without that life in them
[1:12:15] but where God's life is in you you can
[1:12:18] no more perish than God can perish
[1:12:19] that's right because you are a son an
[1:12:23] offspring of God and have eternal life
[1:12:26] oh that's the thing the church needs
[1:12:28] then when God is in you then he lives
[1:12:31] his own life through you see
[1:12:33] and that's how we know we're Christians
[1:12:36] then you're concerned about your brother
[1:12:39] that's how we know we're Christians
[1:12:40] brothers and sisters because he lives
[1:12:42] his life out through us that Spirit
[1:12:46] beareth witness itself
[1:12:50] in our own lives
[1:12:52] we don't live our lives according to our
[1:12:55] will many times we'll say you know I
[1:12:57] really would like to do that but
[1:12:59] we know the scripture says that we ought
[1:13:01] to say Lord willing I'll go and do that
[1:13:06] and we need to say that Lord willing
[1:13:09] we'll see what the Lord wants because
[1:13:11] it's all about his will not ours
[1:13:14] which is totally contrary to what the
[1:13:16] world teaches you know that scripture in
[1:13:19] in Isaiah 43.
[1:13:21] brothers and sisters you are mine is
[1:13:23] what he said I have formed you I have
[1:13:27] called you by name
[1:13:30] man
[1:13:31] just to think about that the Lord Jesus
[1:13:33] Christ
[1:13:34] saying just come and give me a hug son
[1:13:37] just just come and give me a hug
[1:13:39] daughter I I just long to fellowship
[1:13:42] with you I just long to have that
[1:13:44] personal relationship with you I just
[1:13:46] long to hear those words come out of
[1:13:48] your mouth and hit my ears to see my
[1:13:52] life being lived out through you I just
[1:13:55] long to hear that
[1:13:57] and brothers and sisters make no doubt
[1:13:59] about it
[1:14:00] that our our Papa god daddy
[1:14:04] he's proud of us he's proud of you
[1:14:07] why
[1:14:09] just because
[1:14:11] you're his son just because you're his
[1:14:14] daughter
[1:14:15] not because of anything we could do not
[1:14:17] because of anything we'll ever do it's
[1:14:20] just because
[1:14:21] and Satan wants us to believe anything
[1:14:25] but that
[1:14:26] it's just because he chose us in him
[1:14:29] before the foundation of the world my
[1:14:31] goodness because you are my son that's
[1:14:34] it there's no there's no conditions to
[1:14:37] it
[1:14:38] there's no conditions to it this really
[1:14:42] put me in check with my own house
[1:14:46] I'm going to be the I Am The Watchman of
[1:14:49] my own house I need to be watching
[1:14:51] what's going on and making sure
[1:14:52] everything is good but you know what it
[1:14:54] did for me
[1:14:55] it really like over the last 12 hours 14
[1:14:59] hours it's put something in me that's
[1:15:01] made me consider it in a different way
[1:15:04] my my sons will now and and you know I
[1:15:08] know I guess it sounds crazy but it's
[1:15:10] true
[1:15:12] we all have an opportunity to receive a
[1:15:14] revelation and blessed be the name of
[1:15:16] the Lord when it happens I've got a
[1:15:17] revelation my sons don't need to achieve
[1:15:19] anything to be my son
[1:15:22] it's not conditional and my sons don't
[1:15:25] need to achieve anything for me to be
[1:15:26] proud of them
[1:15:28] because I'm proud of to have them as my
[1:15:30] sons I
[1:15:32] can you imagine that that's how he sees
[1:15:34] us he's proud just to have us as
[1:15:36] children
[1:15:38] and when we get that Revelation it just
[1:15:40] causes us to just cry out to him and
[1:15:42] thank him oh my goodness let's just go
[1:15:45] to him in prayer
[1:15:47] gracious Heavenly Father
[1:15:49] Lord
[1:15:50] what manner of love you have bestowed
[1:15:53] upon us Lord Jesus permanent privilege
[1:15:56] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:15:59] that we should be called this the
[1:16:01] daughters of god father that you would
[1:16:03] call us by name that you would give us
[1:16:06] that Revelation father that we're not
[1:16:08] worried about being joined to an
[1:16:10] association we're worried about getting
[1:16:12] your spirit in us we're worried about
[1:16:14] getting that Divine love as as the very
[1:16:17] essence of Our Lives because when we
[1:16:19] have Divine love it casts out all fear
[1:16:23] and when all fear is gone there's
[1:16:25] nothing that can stop us
[1:16:26] because it's not even us it's you it's
[1:16:29] your spirit living out through US Lord
[1:16:31] father what a an incredible blessing it
[1:16:33] is to know that we are your children I
[1:16:36] pray Lord Jesus that you would just take
[1:16:38] the words that were spoken tonight and
[1:16:40] just bind them up in the hearts of your
[1:16:42] children father that you would just
[1:16:43] allow them to be consumed by The Souls
[1:16:47] of your children father that you would
[1:16:48] just forgive me if I've said anything
[1:16:50] wrong or or not the way you wanted it to
[1:16:52] be said Lord I pray that you would just
[1:16:54] translate it the way that you want it to
[1:16:56] be translated to your children tonight
[1:16:58] father that if we are Sons and Daughters
[1:17:01] today then we always were and and that
[1:17:03] can never change it doesn't matter what
[1:17:05] comes our way
