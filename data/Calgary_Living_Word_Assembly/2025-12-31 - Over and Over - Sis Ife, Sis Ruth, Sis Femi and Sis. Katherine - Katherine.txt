Description:
I've stood on the bank of a wide raging river
Trusting that I'd get across
I've made my way through some valleys and deserts
Believing that I'd never get lost

I've been at the foot of what felt like Mt. Everest
Knowing I'd have the strength for the climb
'Cause through every trial, each test and temptation
One thing is sure every time

Over and over, again and again
God is faithful
Over and over, again and again
Through it all he's made me able
To stand and survive, to come through alive
When it sure looked like I couldn't win
Jesus is with me so I claim the victory
Over and over again

If you ask me why I have no hesitation
God does what he says he will do
I'd simply say every battle has taught me
There's nothing He won't help me through

So why should I dwell on the hardships and struggles
When I look just beyond them I see
The way this will end is with great celebration
Deep in my heart I believe

Over and over, again and again
God is faithful
Over and over, again and again
Through it all he's made me able
To stand and survive, to come through alive
When it sure looked like I couldn't win
Jesus is with me so I claim the victory
Over and over again

To stand and survive, to come through alive
When it sure looked like I couldn't win
Jesus is with me so I claim the victory
Over and over
