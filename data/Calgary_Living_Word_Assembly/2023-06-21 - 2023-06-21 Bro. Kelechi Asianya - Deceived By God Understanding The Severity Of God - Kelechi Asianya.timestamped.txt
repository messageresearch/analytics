[1:01:11] God who said um

[1:01:19] you may not understanding
[1:01:22] yourself
[1:01:25] in your congregation
[1:01:27] when you're gonna have one of the things
[1:01:29] that you have here
[1:01:31] you know
[1:01:33] um
[1:01:33] before when the focus of the screen is
[1:01:36] not known
[1:01:37] as news the company as you can do
[1:01:40] and sometimes
[1:01:43] um
[1:01:44] that's conventions
[1:01:48] and convention was
[1:01:49] because the project is normal
[1:01:53] and
[1:01:55] what happens when
[1:01:59] something happens
[1:02:02] when God's brother or that sister is
[1:02:05] remember God in your midst
[1:02:10] of that person
[1:02:13] got every joints of life
[1:02:16] in the body of Christ through every
[1:02:19] joint of life it is not just the
[1:02:21] minister of Supply every project has
[1:02:24] something to do
[1:02:26] and that will show God everything is
[1:02:29] good encourage one another right
[1:02:34] so
[1:02:35] this is like
[1:02:42] um
[1:02:43] somehow
[1:02:50] will be more on
[1:02:53] understanding the severity of God
[1:02:58] and so I would want us to open our Bible
[1:03:01] to musica
[1:03:26] chapter 14. black history
[1:03:50] in the heart
[1:03:52] things
[1:03:58] since I've been incredible
[1:04:00] again
[1:04:03] therefore stick onto them
[1:04:06] and say unto them
[1:04:09] call say the Lord God every man
[1:04:13] of the House of Israel
[1:04:16] the second office
[1:04:22] before he sings
[1:04:25] and comment to the prophet
[1:04:28] I belong
[1:04:31] I do not
[1:04:34] I the Lord
[1:04:37] will answer him
[1:04:39] the comment according to the multitude
[1:04:42] of his idols
[1:04:44] that I am expecting House of Israel in
[1:04:47] their own house
[1:04:49] because they are all extreme for me to
[1:04:52] the idols
[1:04:53] therefore
[1:04:55] say unto the house of Israel
[1:04:58] because
[1:04:59] thanks and calling yourself from idols
[1:05:02] Francis
[1:05:06] from all your Abominations
[1:05:09] for everyone in the house of Israel
[1:05:16] for me
[1:05:18] and second organizing in his heart
[1:05:21] Improvement is coming Lord of iniquity
[1:05:23] before he saved and come back to his
[1:05:26] Prophet to inquire of him concerning me
[1:05:30] I the Lord will answer him by myself
[1:05:35] and I will set my faith against God's
[1:05:37] mind I will make him shine as include
[1:05:40] them and I will cut him off from the
[1:05:43] myth of my people and yes I know that I
[1:05:47] am the Lord
[1:05:52] when he has spoken a thing
[1:05:54] I do not have diffused that prophet
[1:05:58] and I will sort out my heart upon him I
[1:06:02] will destroy him from the midst of My
[1:06:04] People Israel
[1:06:06] and they shall get the punishment of
[1:06:09] that iniquity
[1:06:10] punishment of the president from England
[1:06:13] as a punishment of him that should get
[1:06:17] unto me
[1:06:22] one to five
[1:06:25] foreign
[1:07:04] and all those things have been through
[1:07:07] the Lord
[1:07:09] but to this man when I look even to him
[1:07:12] that is Paul I'm not a Contracting and
[1:07:16] tremended at my world
[1:07:30] Mission and since he offered flying
[1:07:34] blood
[1:07:37] and he left an idol yeah they have
[1:07:42] closing their own wings
[1:07:44] and the Soul delighted in your
[1:07:47] abomination
[1:07:49] was so
[1:07:50] I I do not I also include their delusion
[1:08:01] because
[1:08:06] when I called
[1:08:08] London's answer
[1:08:10] when I think they did not hear that they
[1:08:15] didn't even before my eyes
[1:08:17] and close God in which I believe
[1:08:21] amen
[1:08:32] so um
[1:08:35] okay
[1:08:40] um
[1:08:42] um
[1:08:46] and so
[1:08:48] I
[1:08:49] foreign
[1:09:20] this evening
[1:09:21] though I don't I don't want to think
[1:09:24] myself I want the whole thing to speak
[1:09:27] why
[1:09:29] because
[1:09:31] um
[1:09:32] a man can refuse nothing exactly to him
[1:09:35] for my days
[1:09:37] now
[1:09:41] we had a prophet that was sent to them
[1:09:45] and then they had many problems
[1:09:49] and then
[1:09:51] Israel they have the word of most
[1:09:53] responsive to them they had the temple
[1:09:56] they had everything that they needed
[1:09:59] they they had the laws all that was
[1:10:03] given to them and so they have come to a
[1:10:06] point
[1:10:07] where they have they get they see
[1:10:10] themselves as the only people
[1:10:13] and so you come to a point Israel they
[1:10:17] no longer have any encounter or the kind
[1:10:20] of don't associate anybody who is not an
[1:10:25] Israelite
[1:10:27] I hope they become
[1:10:29] so much self-like loss to employ to God
[1:10:33] when they make sacrifices for their sins
[1:10:37] it wasn't from the heart but because it
[1:10:40] is something we have to do
[1:10:44] and so
[1:10:45] if I want to commit adopt me
[1:10:48] I will go and die in good and cook and
[1:10:52] then go and communicate go through again
[1:10:54] sacrifice the group
[1:10:59] I know
[1:11:00] and that was not the problems of the law
[1:11:03] the Lord will guide them for them to
[1:11:07] live a life plus life
[1:11:10] but there's always a transaction
[1:11:13] to whatever God do for people
[1:11:19] and so
[1:11:21] it became a norm
[1:11:25] until it came to a point that these
[1:11:29] people they had no fear for God's
[1:11:32] prophet
[1:11:34] that that they will come to a close like
[1:11:37] the the living make up their minds on
[1:11:40] what to do
[1:11:41] so we are coming to that government
[1:11:44] I don't know nothing to Mark the
[1:11:46] prospect or maybe go to get the process
[1:11:50] opinion
[1:11:52] the one o'clock is going to say it's not
[1:11:55] going to our own car it wasn't already
[1:11:57] have in mind
[1:12:00] and therefore the Lord program
[1:12:03] if any of your game comes to you or
[1:12:05] anybody
[1:12:08] and he has an ugly heart he has already
[1:12:12] left his life on what to do
[1:12:15] now
[1:12:16] I'm not together now I belong you tell
[1:12:21] him exactly exactly he wants to hear
[1:12:27] foreign
[1:12:41] why because
[1:12:43] that man first of all a message was
[1:12:47] presented
[1:12:48] to him
[1:12:50] because to link it to him in the world
[1:12:54] that he cannot deny
[1:12:56] yet he decided to Delight that message
[1:13:06] no
[1:13:08] that this was the state of Israel
[1:13:11] I remember as you speak
[1:13:16] English
[1:13:23] right now
[1:13:25] so when I'm speaking don't think about
[1:13:28] Israel don't be thinking about yourself
[1:13:30] this conversation that is thinking about
[1:13:34] it
[1:13:40] from her
[1:13:42] no
[1:13:45] let me come from Noah
[1:13:48] in the time of newer
[1:13:50] now the truth is that Noah is not
[1:13:53] entitled right
[1:13:55] because
[1:14:00] of God
[1:14:02] we know that Enoch was the type of
[1:14:05] device
[1:14:06] nothing
[1:14:11] you have to understand something
[1:14:14] degrees of Enoch Enoch was the only one
[1:14:18] with restaurant
[1:14:20] something happened at that period
[1:14:27] that the source of God
[1:14:29] saw the doctors of men that's when we
[1:14:33] are fair
[1:14:38] so
[1:14:40] and then
[1:14:42] it happened today let's continue from
[1:14:45] where I was before
[1:14:47] I thought that became a lingering
[1:14:51] you know that before that time
[1:14:54] there was
[1:14:57] a focal distinction between the seed of
[1:15:01] God
[1:15:02] and he doesn't happen
[1:15:04] right
[1:15:06] and one thing that we understand that
[1:15:10] would happen is that it has a regular
[1:15:13] spirit in it
[1:15:15] because
[1:15:17] God himself as a delightful care
[1:15:21] and take another season
[1:15:24] so it's not about
[1:15:26] having the greatest advantages
[1:15:33] look inside of him and not I cannot it's
[1:15:39] not receptive to the world
[1:15:44] I'm coming from where
[1:15:47] but
[1:15:49] government
[1:15:51] now you see Enoch
[1:15:54] is this was that thought he didn't tell
[1:15:58] us that God
[1:16:00] [Music]
[1:16:05] if if you believe in the last seven
[1:16:08] things I believe in the last challenge
[1:16:11] and the only way you can have that faith
[1:16:14] in that sleeping God
[1:16:18] I love that it was by faith
[1:16:21] and so and not have something that is
[1:16:25] good look for the heart
[1:16:28] and if that was the requirement for that
[1:16:32] time this is also the retirement for
[1:16:35] today
[1:16:38] yoga retirement you see the bathroom is
[1:16:42] so open
[1:16:44] to the messenger William
[1:16:47] that we know all these things
[1:16:50] well it is not just in millions because
[1:16:52] in the time of anger they have to learn
[1:16:55] it too
[1:16:58] and so when Enoch was last Club
[1:17:04] got all stress we are corrupted
[1:17:11] uh
[1:17:13] welcome Google
[1:17:25] and that's how it was going to be in our
[1:17:28] time
[1:17:29] and we understand that in the days of
[1:17:33] Noah that is
[1:17:40] oh
[1:17:41] and so
[1:17:43] the message that Angels received all
[1:17:47] flesh will just missions
[1:17:52] and
[1:17:56] when God sent the message
[1:17:59] of God yes
[1:18:01] the God is a god of God
[1:18:08] why is he a ghost blog
[1:18:13] that is why you need to understand
[1:18:17] foreign
[1:18:22] because
[1:18:24] for him to be a God of Justice
[1:18:27] it means that
[1:18:31] the good things must live on the same
[1:18:35] ground
[1:18:36] for them to make a choice
[1:18:40] now the God died for knowledge
[1:18:44] okay
[1:18:46] not that God said no God died for
[1:18:50] knowledge
[1:18:51] he knows because that this figure makes
[1:18:55] because of where it came from
[1:19:01] what
[1:19:03] oh if God and King
[1:19:08] he had Adam
[1:19:12] So Adam
[1:19:14] please again the whole Council of God
[1:19:19] and so we saw that as we are growing up
[1:19:23] group of them had revealed for God we
[1:19:27] follow him
[1:19:31] quickly doing a hard-working they were
[1:19:35] doing the best they can do
[1:19:37] and then
[1:19:39] pain was violent the nuclear the same
[1:19:43] way as well
[1:19:47] because once when you come was that sick
[1:19:52] and the other religion
[1:19:55] interpretation of what Adam said
[1:19:59] so even though God will served God to
[1:20:04] hang to hear from God directly
[1:20:08] relationship
[1:20:17] thank you sacrifice
[1:20:19] him and kill him okay this is not the
[1:20:23] time to sacrifice I want
[1:20:27] so it wasn't somebody who was a relation
[1:20:30] from God like that you know
[1:20:34] God when God called me business not Lord
[1:20:37] I want from you even God told me did you
[1:20:40] know she was as well did so don't but
[1:20:43] God do not only like okay nothing told
[1:20:48] me exactly what to do
[1:20:52] God
[1:20:56] you see
[1:20:59] when
[1:21:02] um
[1:21:03] when you plant when you apply to me in
[1:21:05] your farm again
[1:21:09] uh
[1:21:18] they are all working for the rain to
[1:21:21] fall right
[1:21:22] again
[1:21:24] when we went falls down on it
[1:21:29] the men will remain
[1:21:31] right okay
[1:21:33] now when word of God came to every girl
[1:21:37] and King
[1:21:49] in American expressions
[1:21:51] the first that came to his mind wasn't
[1:21:55] killing a girl
[1:22:00] 10 months
[1:22:03] the thought the first thing that came to
[1:22:05] him was I have to kill yourself
[1:22:11] mother
[1:22:13] and then he came back the next thing was
[1:22:15] no conscience
[1:22:17] and God asking him where is Israel
[1:22:21] because of my my brother Kruger where
[1:22:25] did he get this thing from
[1:22:27] because it is
[1:22:30] you can't change it
[1:22:34] and then the next thing of the dog
[1:22:37] clothing and God asked him and after God
[1:22:40] has given him because
[1:22:44] I said God is a human being
[1:22:54] painters nothing but yet he was in that
[1:22:59] talk of Adam
[1:23:04] now we see that we moved down to the
[1:23:07] grace of Noah
[1:23:09] this is what the meaning of sins
[1:23:12] has not Resort again as the whole flesh
[1:23:15] was corrupt before God
[1:23:20] and then
[1:23:22] God found a new account drink in the
[1:23:26] cycle club
[1:23:28] now I'm trying to bring to people now
[1:23:33] when when Noah
[1:23:36] you go
[1:23:37] lure was
[1:23:47] because
[1:23:51] [Music]
[1:23:56] of mine
[1:23:58] was continually written
[1:24:02] it was it was a progressive resolution
[1:24:05] of wickedness
[1:24:13] progression
[1:24:15] that's the way
[1:24:19] I'm coming here
[1:24:22] wickedness disguise
[1:24:29] some of the things that
[1:24:31] the government goals look at some of the
[1:24:34] things as you speak with God
[1:24:36] if you're going to know how they are
[1:24:38] able to think that wickedness how do
[1:24:41] they how do you imagine that kind of
[1:24:43] evil
[1:24:46] oh God
[1:24:50] and then that was how he falls in the
[1:24:53] time of Noah
[1:24:55] and
[1:24:57] if we if you look at the the family of
[1:25:00] King you will see the first things
[1:25:08] you got me on Earth the drugs are
[1:25:13] different kind of music the music
[1:25:16] industry The Entity
[1:25:28] it's good
[1:25:30] unions
[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:45] no
[1:25:49] when you are
[1:25:51] when God came to mewah I told them you
[1:25:54] are
[1:25:56] this new career has come before me
[1:25:58] I I want to start I'm going to destroy
[1:26:01] this whole world
[1:26:02] you are understanding the presently of
[1:26:06] God
[1:26:07] for 120 years he was speaking to solve
[1:26:12] that kind of things
[1:26:16] why was you are cooking because Noah
[1:26:20] understood the severity of God
[1:26:26] foreign
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:55] going to happen
[1:26:58] you it was going to be a terrible thing
[1:27:01] it was going to be a terrible Act of God
[1:27:06] not the best of God
[1:27:11] so you are kept thinking day and night
[1:27:15] every time as your feet you are crying
[1:27:19] because
[1:27:21] the devil said that the wickedness and
[1:27:24] the answer that was so much that it
[1:27:27] gives the heart of God
[1:27:43] foreign
[1:27:49] because
[1:27:51] sometimes in our spirits of work
[1:27:56] what we've been using
[1:27:58] that's what I'm saying this thing
[1:28:00] because if we understand the sovereignty
[1:28:04] of God
[1:28:07] if you understand
[1:28:08] what is
[1:28:10] the government of conducation
[1:28:13] you don't care if that person
[1:28:16] will be saved a lot
[1:28:18] it could be a utmost responsibility to
[1:28:22] preach to that person
[1:28:25] that's what I'm saying
[1:28:29] no
[1:28:35] let me consider my camera
[1:28:39] but before I before I come to this point
[1:28:42] now
[1:28:43] we see that
[1:28:47] because in time when when new I was
[1:28:49] going to speak to why he was speaking he
[1:28:52] was making an ark what and then it was
[1:28:56] time because Lewis Nations did not make
[1:29:00] any sense
[1:29:02] and you always thinking this message to
[1:29:05] people who knows what is our students so
[1:29:08] when you are going to put the house but
[1:29:14] but they haven't met the god of Noah
[1:29:18] now I want to make a scripture here will
[1:29:21] also 17
[1:29:24] and weakness is someone who has had
[1:29:29] effect
[1:29:31] s
[1:29:33] for him to be a weakness or something
[1:29:35] you must regret when nothing happened
[1:29:39] if not you are not a witness of that
[1:29:45] for you to be a weakness of Christ
[1:29:48] it is not someone that told me or my
[1:29:52] grandfather told me no
[1:29:54] you will hunt to a point where you must
[1:29:57] be
[1:29:59] affect hand weakness of Christ sometimes
[1:30:05] and so these people in a time of newer
[1:30:08] the New York you are saying look they
[1:30:12] have never left the god of Noah
[1:30:16] they never never
[1:30:20] when no one came into the position that
[1:30:24] God told me to bring an ark it is going
[1:30:27] to rain
[1:30:31] what you are saying
[1:30:34] it's not it's not in the Bible
[1:30:40] but
[1:30:42] what
[1:30:43] he saw
[1:30:45] that's why we have to be certain of God
[1:30:50] Paul speaking
[1:30:52] he said give diligence
[1:30:56] to make your calling as a lesson so
[1:31:01] diligence diligence means take out time
[1:31:07] take out time to make sure that you have
[1:31:10] salvation
[1:31:12] here
[1:31:20] okay see
[1:31:23] anything God Is So humble
[1:31:28] God is so sincere that you will always
[1:31:31] stick to me back
[1:31:34] but most times you don't do that we
[1:31:37] don't even spend time in the place of
[1:31:39] Prayer
[1:31:40] we must take time you it wasn't nothing
[1:31:44] I'm taking you most times go to the
[1:31:47] mountains spend time with God
[1:31:50] we can't do that but we want to operate
[1:31:54] in The Legend Of God that's wonderful
[1:31:59] now
[1:32:02] remember
[1:32:04] these people want 28 they rejected the
[1:32:09] message of Miller
[1:32:10] but in the mind you're talking and
[1:32:13] getting lower
[1:32:17] because
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:32:19] the god of Noah
[1:32:23] and so
[1:32:24] I I got because
[1:32:30] even from the animals had animals
[1:32:33] animals they have washing machine and
[1:32:36] human beings
[1:32:43] did not get that money
[1:32:45] that is
[1:32:57] we are and now this camera it was God
[1:33:02] who came down and shot the ark
[1:33:06] now you are talking your mind
[1:33:09] it was it go forward
[1:33:15] to Massachusetts
[1:33:20] so how come they did not have access to
[1:33:23] the Earth
[1:33:24] because it was God himself does not work
[1:33:30] now it is not the act of God
[1:33:34] because they have crossed the light
[1:33:37] because of God's picking the message
[1:33:39] um
[1:33:55] then you can cross the line
[1:33:58] and when you cross that line God was
[1:34:00] working
[1:34:01] um
[1:34:02] when it was so good that's right and
[1:34:06] that looks like he he cried for it
[1:34:19] so
[1:34:21] when you got us again
[1:34:28] that is how it could bring our time
[1:34:32] in the kind of structure they have no
[1:34:34] Bible we have no Gaggle together
[1:34:37] any kind of Freedom they don't have many
[1:34:40] courses that we have to do
[1:34:45] however
[1:34:47] Sodom they met Abraham
[1:34:50] entitled
[1:34:53] of like knock knock
[1:34:59] let me let me guess something here
[1:35:01] that's why I don't move to Southern
[1:35:03] Rock wasn't as I have
[1:35:07] and then what time issues
[1:35:14] um
[1:35:24] soon
[1:35:25] it will always come get me point of
[1:35:29] decision
[1:35:31] this Christianity will always come down
[1:35:35] it will always going down to a point of
[1:35:38] decision
[1:35:45] and your decision is because of who you
[1:35:49] were before the working time
[1:35:51] God that will always be the point of
[1:35:55] decision to see your points tells us who
[1:35:59] you are
[1:36:02] and so
[1:36:04] I I love look at the connection together
[1:36:13] I think sugar it was well workered
[1:36:17] you know the way that you you look at
[1:36:20] making
[1:36:22] you
[1:36:23] know it's so beautiful
[1:36:27] so that is where I'm going to
[1:36:31] again the next one love did not he did
[1:36:34] not go to show them
[1:36:36] sugar
[1:36:41] so this is shutdown so look when you
[1:36:44] started that snagging he said in his
[1:36:47] heart I cannot I cannot go into sugar so
[1:36:50] I'm still close
[1:36:55] but without thought that when when the
[1:36:59] 1980s came
[1:37:01] look was close to Southern he was now so
[1:37:06] good
[1:37:11] no
[1:37:13] Google
[1:37:15] coming to destruction
[1:37:19] again I have to speak to my friends as I
[1:37:22] have
[1:37:23] oh are you a friend of God
[1:37:27] you know why why ask questions
[1:37:32] Abraham
[1:37:36] in in the height of God
[1:37:40] so remarkable recommend to God that when
[1:37:45] God wants to do something not this is
[1:37:48] not to exercise God wants to do
[1:37:50] something to eat different
[1:37:52] foreign
[1:38:27] so
[1:38:32] Google negotiating with money
[1:38:36] now it came down to 10.
[1:38:40] if the igorithms came transition
[1:38:43] drugs again
[1:38:49] is my culture
[1:38:52] so if Southern has not found itself in
[1:38:58] the same condition
[1:39:00] that we also saw in the time of newer We
[1:39:05] Are All Flesh
[1:39:08] oh
[1:39:11] and because
[1:39:13] God has determined Sodom for Destruction
[1:39:18] those two angels were sent to such
[1:39:21] trouble
[1:39:22] and when there was a good the Ranger and
[1:39:26] the first thing they take us to Blind
[1:39:28] soda
[1:39:31] equaling the devil
[1:39:35] because this man have rejected the
[1:39:39] gospel the next thing was God deniving
[1:39:42] them
[1:39:44] him
[1:39:54] so this is not the act of the devil for
[1:39:57] the act of God
[1:40:00] for for organization that understands
[1:40:04] the god of Heaven and Earth
[1:40:09] no
[1:40:15] this is very families it has
[1:40:21] now we let uh for those
[1:40:26] I mean
[1:40:28] I want to encourage everyone of us to at
[1:40:31] least everywhere you try to look like
[1:40:33] one tough guy in the Bible it will help
[1:40:35] me a lot and sometimes
[1:40:38] um
[1:40:40] try to encourage yourself to like look
[1:40:43] like the whole group in your room
[1:40:45] because I look like marking in a week
[1:40:48] first drawing in a week you know and
[1:40:50] other students health will cancel a lot
[1:40:53] no
[1:40:56] Ahab I'm trying to one guy because look
[1:41:00] at everything I'm saying I'm not trying
[1:41:02] to show my opinion
[1:41:04] I'm trying to say walk through the word
[1:41:06] of God
[1:41:07] now we have Ahab
[1:41:10] the guy who make us understand that it
[1:41:14] had was so wicked
[1:41:17] that that he he caught it was a small
[1:41:20] thing to Manchester who was the daughter
[1:41:23] of Ecuador
[1:41:26] so it had
[1:41:29] it has understood
[1:41:34] politician
[1:41:40] and so he wanted to he had this
[1:41:43] inspiration that he can mind the doctor
[1:41:45] of his kingdom from that other part into
[1:41:48] you know I would have a good position we
[1:41:51] will have a good Commonwealth this
[1:41:54] country we have a good uh reverse from
[1:41:57] super god country you know that we can
[1:41:59] have allies like that you know because
[1:42:01] business number
[1:42:04] and so
[1:42:06] it had
[1:42:09] When government came
[1:42:12] they had 800 Prophets
[1:42:15] the first 400 foreign
[1:42:44] in Israel
[1:42:48] and so
[1:42:51] we had a liger
[1:42:53] who was
[1:42:55] exactly what we are supposed to do today
[1:43:00] men who are not afraid of whoever can do
[1:43:06] because when when Elijah came before
[1:43:09] Ahab
[1:43:10] in 3017
[1:43:13] right before wife when he was before
[1:43:16] Ahab he took a house of I am standing
[1:43:19] before my God so I'm not going to seeing
[1:43:21] you
[1:43:29] the world
[1:43:32] now
[1:43:36] don't
[1:43:38] it had went ahead nothing
[1:43:43] and then if nothing came to him and
[1:43:46] closing you are going to die this like
[1:43:47] this will happen to you
[1:43:49] the Bible says repentance now let's
[1:43:53] let's I want to make something there
[1:43:57] God forgive him
[1:44:02] yet
[1:44:14] in all these atrocities where he thanked
[1:44:18] God forgive him
[1:44:21] again what happened there
[1:44:24] he went back
[1:44:27] I did not make you like that is
[1:44:30] activated something
[1:44:33] that night
[1:44:35] as the moment he crossed that line
[1:44:38] a little was held in heaven
[1:44:43] you see
[1:44:44] I I don't think it's time for a half to
[1:44:49] die in time so what are we going to do
[1:44:54] it yeah
[1:45:01] is he
[1:45:03] um
[1:45:10] [Music]
[1:45:12] foreign
[1:45:45] everything
[1:46:02] 400
[1:46:04] but
[1:46:06] this is this is now God the act of God
[1:46:11] not the devil not mine what
[1:46:15] are we going to do
[1:46:17] for this Ahab and there's a consensus in
[1:46:21] heaven against him
[1:46:28] foreign
[1:46:31] [Music]
[1:46:37] God I am telling you
[1:46:40] and so when you saw a house Prophet
[1:46:43] prophesied they actually saying this one
[1:46:48] the reaction under an inspiration
[1:46:53] and then there was also another
[1:46:55] inspiration on Ahab
[1:46:58] and that was um
[1:47:04] was in Romans chapter 1.
[1:47:08] I I wasn't
[1:47:10] part of God and I'll beat them up
[1:47:13] overcome
[1:47:18] and that was the anointing that also
[1:47:21] came on that one
[1:47:23] is done with that Prophet I I know why
[1:47:30] no he doesn't tell me what I want to
[1:47:33] hear
[1:47:34] and so God has anointed this 400 process
[1:47:37] together what he wants to hear and he's
[1:47:42] a prophet the disease you know that I do
[1:47:45] not have deceived that prophet
[1:47:54] of God
[1:47:56] because a heart has been given up to a
[1:47:59] liquid mind
[1:48:01] to send nine thousand King that cannot
[1:48:04] receive the word of God he despised that
[1:48:07] prophet
[1:48:09] but it took an anointing of God upon him
[1:48:13] for his personal destruction
[1:48:17] the very word of God
[1:48:23] no
[1:48:26] work there in Israel
[1:48:31] romance chapter one another one again
[1:48:41] and the rest of London according
[1:48:45] God is not the devil
[1:48:48] number
[1:48:53] yes eyes that they should not see and
[1:48:57] yes that they should not hear until this
[1:49:00] day
[1:49:17] now I I I'm going to line up one thing I
[1:49:21] have to make this because
[1:49:26] over 2 000 years
[1:49:30] they are working for Christ
[1:49:34] all the life
[1:49:36] because we we understand that from the
[1:49:39] promise of Adam from the fall of Adam
[1:49:42] when God promised The Shield
[1:49:45] to Abraham
[1:49:47] in the land of Moriah where he wanted to
[1:49:49] sacrifice Isaac that received was 2 000
[1:49:53] years
[1:49:56] from from that from that point
[1:50:01] of Christ
[1:50:03] on that same thing was another 2 000
[1:50:07] years
[1:50:09] I will say that
[1:50:11] when Christ came
[1:50:13] the people
[1:50:15] who have been working for him for 2 000
[1:50:19] years
[1:50:21] they were the ones that crucified him
[1:50:25] well then then crucified him even in
[1:50:29] Jerusalem
[1:50:31] the same people who have all their life
[1:50:35] have been discussing all that they have
[1:50:38] done everything who have all the process
[1:50:42] and
[1:50:43] there's nothing for the Messiah to come
[1:50:48] but because
[1:50:51] the the possession of what the Messiah
[1:50:55] would be
[1:50:56] is not what we are seeing
[1:51:03] it was decent people
[1:51:06] just crucified him but you not think
[1:51:09] that it is the act of the devil no
[1:51:12] it is God put this number in their eyes
[1:51:16] because of the Gentiles
[1:51:26] who he was
[1:51:29] don't crucify him
[1:51:32] if you are telling you that because the
[1:51:35] Bible tells us to wait to shall see his
[1:51:37] death
[1:51:39] and is causing the death of Adam
[1:51:42] there was one who was meant to take away
[1:51:45] your sin
[1:51:48] and who who is that so when Christ came
[1:51:51] he came to fulfill that scripture
[1:51:54] to tell the wages of faith
[1:51:57] that for him having on the cross to that
[1:52:01] guy he now became sin not that he was a
[1:52:05] singer but he became saying that we may
[1:52:09] become the righteousness of Christ
[1:52:13] go for him to become sin
[1:52:17] it was his own people
[1:52:20] that's not working for him that had to
[1:52:23] crucify him
[1:52:26] and then Paul now said something
[1:52:28] he said
[1:52:32] wow no
[1:52:36] don't sit there
[1:52:38] the glasses were broken off because I am
[1:52:40] at the Jack again
[1:52:42] because of underneath they are broken
[1:52:44] off and that started I think do not hide
[1:52:47] my God yeah
[1:52:49] so I'm speaking to us now so I'm down to
[1:52:52] our time be not high-minded book yeah
[1:52:57] for if God
[1:53:00] not the natural thank you
[1:53:03] take him
[1:53:04] he also can't knock you
[1:53:08] the whole example the goodness and his
[1:53:12] very clear of God
[1:53:13] goodness
[1:53:18] is conditional
[1:53:21] if thou continue in his goodness
[1:53:25] otherwise
[1:53:31] and then also is a God blessing of the
[1:53:34] leaf
[1:53:35] has drafted in so God is angry could
[1:53:39] drop them in again
[1:53:42] now where are we now
[1:53:46] you move outside here you this city
[1:53:49] Canada does not look like a city
[1:53:56] but wasn't happening
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:08] now so if that were hooked out of
[1:54:11] honestly this is why by nickel
[1:54:16] I would love that no you have just a
[1:54:19] contrary to Nature into a good honestly
[1:54:24] speaking here
[1:54:26] when you left
[1:54:28] a lying orange tree
[1:54:31] to mention the natural activities that
[1:54:35] the the right or listening will
[1:54:37] introduce live truth
[1:54:43] when Gentiles were adjusted into that
[1:54:46] body the Gentiles those who have the
[1:54:50] Holy Ghost not produce the fruit of the
[1:54:53] Holy Ghost
[1:54:56] nature
[1:55:06] that what we have to do
[1:55:09] something
[1:55:13] it's not um
[1:55:15] it's like an orange thing
[1:55:17] and then you have uh you have different
[1:55:20] kind of stuff and guys how to do how to
[1:55:23] learn more and they are eating some of
[1:55:26] the orange and when it comes
[1:55:28] time to produce fruit they will have to
[1:55:31] give oranges no because this nothing
[1:55:34] came from
[1:55:35] and so and that is how
[1:55:38] we have to go
[1:55:41] get
[1:55:42] many group of people
[1:55:45] just get to get to the real word of God
[1:55:49] the anointing of the day
[1:55:52] And yet when you come for them to
[1:55:54] produce yourself
[1:56:03] it is this genuine anointing of the Holy
[1:56:06] Ghost
[1:56:07] Matthew 24.
[1:56:11] they are false Christ
[1:56:14] the real anointing that look false
[1:56:19] the real anointing they are eating the
[1:56:22] genuine word of God there's nothing in
[1:56:25] them world
[1:56:30] foreign
[1:57:06] why do you think these things are
[1:57:08] happening at this time it is a time of
[1:57:11] my quality of both things
[1:57:16] there are things that are enormous thing
[1:57:19] you cannot even here with you because
[1:57:21] now you see them on screen on TV set
[1:57:26] 30 years ago 16 years ago 100 years ago
[1:57:29] if you it was enough domination for for
[1:57:33] one to tell you or imagine
[1:57:42] Google here
[1:57:45] is a normal thing to hear
[1:57:49] why because of my calling
[1:57:53] so what is happening to the weak now is
[1:57:58] the week I do not support myself too
[1:58:03] because it is
[1:58:06] also a majority of the week who are
[1:58:10] supposed to stand against the Israel of
[1:58:13] the day
[1:58:15] amen and that was the point
[1:58:19] because
[1:58:20] when we talk about experience
[1:58:23] something has to squeeze something
[1:58:28] you you can't be hidden
[1:58:31] um nothing chapter five
[1:58:33] you when you when you like to understand
[1:58:36] it has no use
[1:58:39] this has no news
[1:58:42] for you to understand what is
[1:58:48] you not understand the sweetness of the
[1:58:51] orange
[1:58:55] doesn't send people now do not see the
[1:58:59] genuine Christianity even though they
[1:59:01] will not accept it
[1:59:04] even though they will not accept it
[1:59:06] because Christ was in that position that
[1:59:10] he was pleased
[1:59:12] and all that came out of perfect love
[1:59:15] and that woman sent to them no that's
[1:59:18] not my father when he looked at him as a
[1:59:21] cross when he was dying he said truly
[1:59:23] this is the son of God
[1:59:25] because that's why he saw was beyond
[1:59:28] what he has seen all his life
[1:59:31] but yet to many people who are there it
[1:59:35] is not good salvation to them
[1:59:40] no
[1:59:43] um
[1:59:51] you have to conclusive methodology
[1:59:54] and then
[2:00:00] Gathering you together first the task
[2:00:04] exactly
[2:00:11] it must have to be discussed first
[2:00:16] and you start forming you to a
[2:00:19] communical council and and all these
[2:00:23] councils and councils and councils
[2:00:26] and even even councils
[2:00:31] it is still the same kind of the United
[2:00:34] States thousands upon councils what is
[2:00:37] happening is Gathering of the cars
[2:00:42] and God is gathering them for importance
[2:00:45] because they have to gather before we
[2:00:49] can be cast into the furnace
[2:00:56] you also understand that when when you
[2:00:59] Prospect in this day of speaking they
[2:01:02] are also sent
[2:01:04] a good blanking angels
[2:01:07] I thought what we have today is is I
[2:01:10] mean if a solution of the effect of the
[2:01:15] grinding
[2:01:16] and so describing has been moving down
[2:01:19] some General Circle generation and so
[2:01:22] when we have the people who are more
[2:01:25] blinded than in the father's way
[2:01:29] and so what do we have now today we have
[2:01:32] people in the United States you you you
[2:01:36] you have to leave God he said we are
[2:01:38] many but and then he was in the mountain
[2:01:41] he was far away is crying I was crying
[2:01:44] for salvation but today we have them in
[2:01:46] the offices the Imagine for him to call
[2:01:49] them damn good
[2:01:52] even that same demon if if it is now in
[2:01:57] in the government it is now in
[2:02:00] everywhere and he's not telling you what
[2:02:02] to do
[2:02:03] why because the weak because I'm not
[2:02:07] calling
[2:02:08] because this is the devil or he's
[2:02:12] walking into prepare himself to set the
[2:02:15] substance of sentence either
[2:02:17] and this evening must be perfected
[2:02:22] the investor sessions
[2:02:25] the devil will not understand how the
[2:02:28] government foreign
[2:02:36] amen why because that is an anointing
[2:02:41] and that anointing is dependent on what
[2:02:45] seeds is inside the tension
[2:02:49] amen
[2:02:51] now
[2:02:53] inclusion now some some myself
[2:03:03] holy spirit of God
[2:03:06] upon your question
[2:03:07] I need their Force yeah
[2:03:12] and things are so signs of Wonders in
[2:03:15] some of that if if you defeat the very
[2:03:20] electric if it were possible and their
[2:03:24] Anointed with genuine hosting
[2:03:36] the Lord
[2:03:40] now
[2:03:41] are in closing
[2:03:47] okay let me call the musician
[2:03:50] not inclusive
[2:03:53] because salvation
[2:03:59] once the mission of iniquity the the
[2:04:03] second illusion of godliness
[2:04:06] now delivers in literacy is just
[2:04:09] opposite of the mystery of godliness
[2:04:11] the mission of godliness is called
[2:04:14] manifested in this yes
[2:04:18] of the devil manifested and distress now
[2:04:22] this mystery already work now as as far
[2:04:27] as speaking it was already working but
[2:04:30] it was actually six days
[2:04:35] right here
[2:04:37] and then shall do because of the field
[2:04:41] from the Lord shall continue
[2:04:45] Blackness was coming even him who's
[2:04:48] coming after the working of Franklin and
[2:04:49] all towers and
[2:04:51] psychological universities
[2:04:54] because when you seek not the Lord or
[2:04:57] the truth that game I could say
[2:05:01] and for this horse
[2:05:04] God send them
[2:05:06] wrong
[2:05:08] delusion
[2:05:10] that they should believe in life
[2:05:15] why
[2:05:17] because they all might be damned who
[2:05:21] believes not the truth
[2:05:22] but had pleasure in the righteousness
[2:05:27] now also
[2:05:29] God also
[2:05:33] God also gave a lot to us cleanliness
[2:05:37] true disasters of Their Own Heart
[2:05:40] themselves
[2:05:49] I will not come anything
[2:05:51] nothing to understand is that this city
[2:05:54] is getting right for total discussion
[2:05:57] this is going to see when you see these
[2:06:00] things happening do not associate
[2:06:03] yourself with any form of it
[2:06:06] because
[2:06:08] this is a sign that this city is already
[2:06:12] Under the Desert of God and maybe
[2:06:15] because maybe we are more than 10
[2:06:17] because don't close Abraham into your
[2:06:20] thing I will not destroy
[2:06:22] no
[2:06:24] look at what they are doing
[2:06:27] all right and once you can celebrate
[2:06:30] your mother to Crystal now in this city
[2:06:33] the Halloween the weather the present
[2:06:37] Halloween and so many eye Targets in so
[2:06:41] many so many angles Washington stuff in
[2:06:44] this country
[2:06:46] again
[2:06:51] okay the next one so this course
[2:06:54] Allah
[2:07:02] for even the women they change the
[2:07:05] National Youth into that with
[2:07:08] International
[2:07:10] women and women
[2:07:12] buying any kind of things
[2:07:15] and likewise also the leg
[2:07:19] management
[2:07:25] I'm
[2:07:27] glad
[2:07:30] use of women born in the Lord one to one
[2:07:35] another
[2:07:37] men with men walking god with his
[2:07:41] unfilling
[2:07:43] when they said this thing do not know
[2:07:46] how how filthy they are
[2:07:50] and we're feeling themselves that which
[2:07:52] contains of the error which of me
[2:07:56] third one
[2:07:57] and even though they did not like to
[2:07:59] detain God in their knowledge
[2:08:01] God gave them over to a reproduce mind
[2:08:16] the reason why I'm saying these things
[2:08:18] because on Saturday I went to downtown
[2:08:22] after he went to assist
[2:08:26] and then
[2:08:29] delivers nothing else
[2:08:32] I I understand I wanted the ashamed of
[2:08:35] my faith
[2:08:36] because
[2:08:38] the people have no regard when they have
[2:08:42] broken God for us they have no respect
[2:08:46] for The God Who understanding
[2:08:53] for God
[2:08:55] it is gone
[2:08:59] and then when we find ourselves
[2:09:03] and that is where the world is moving to
[2:09:05] because
[2:09:07] the gospel is going to leave the
[2:09:11] Gentiles touching the truth
[2:09:13] and
[2:09:14] governor of the Gospel here from us
[2:09:19] Massachusetts
[2:09:40] Association
[2:09:45] we've come to a point
[2:09:47] where um
[2:09:50] you cut internet to drink I mean the
[2:09:53] people are so they have so much
[2:09:55] education
[2:09:58] no God
[2:10:12] [Music]
[2:10:22] [Music]
[2:10:25] that's right
[2:10:28] that is where we are
[2:10:30] we are we are at the point not only does
[2:10:34] the government is forcing you not to
[2:10:37] serve God
[2:10:38] even in your place of work
[2:10:41] everything
[2:10:43] in construction
[2:10:48] um a different kind of work that I
[2:10:51] understand other stuff because I'm
[2:10:54] coming to another organization the same
[2:10:57] thing
[2:11:01] you cannot avoid it because we are in
[2:11:05] this world but we are not off
[2:11:08] and therefore we have to be ambassadors
[2:11:13] so what I'm saying is that
[2:11:16] even young people
[2:11:18] they are 10 years nine years seven years
[2:11:20] in your schools thanks for what to
[2:11:23] believe
[2:11:25] some time for us to
[2:11:27] start compromising

[2:11:34] the coming in Japan
[2:11:36] we don't know when but
[2:11:39] in the summon the slashing like life is
[2:11:42] coming
[2:11:45] when you see these things
[2:11:47] you know that it is near enough to go
[2:11:52] because things are the time for for us
[2:11:54] to necessary to anymore no we reflect
[2:11:58] beyond that in second time so you can
[2:12:00] come to talk because all because
