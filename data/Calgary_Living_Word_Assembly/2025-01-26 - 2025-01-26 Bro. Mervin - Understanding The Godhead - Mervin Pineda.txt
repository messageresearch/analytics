you may be seated amen are you excited this morning amen amen so there there's some announcements uh first uh Barberry wanted to greet the Saints he's uh in Edmonton right now uh with anti message uh Tabernacle with brother Ed hammermeister so it's good to to pour from vessels to vessels amen because uh this the you know uh Perfection is of the five-fold ministry and uh we need to to be used amen if we eat steak every time we want other food as well because uh we have all all things we have the seven course meal and uh each gift is uh different but we all point out to the same word amen and we thank the Lord for that and uh he has his greetings amen uh and we want to welcome the the newcomers uh who will be uh fellowshipping with us uh it's brother Emmanuel sister Michelle and their daughter Karen the L family maybe let's give them a warm welcome amen praise the Lord if you welcome welcome I know uh brother Barry would want to welcome you even further and and the rest of the congregation but uh officially we want to welcome you amen they're from Cameroon brothers and sisters uh and we want to sojourn with you while we are here on this side amen uh and we have a prayer request as well uh uh I think uh the mom of sister Linda uh sister NTI Fen she has had a fall this morning only and had to be brought to the hospital so maybe uh let's stand uh to to pray for her specifically uh it's uh there's power in prayer with the Believers of like Precious Faith amen Let's us pray and I want to include also my two sisters uh one of my sisters uh he's she's in the ICU and the other one she's bedridden so but we know we have a we have the god that can heal not only physically but spiritually amen which is the more most important let us bow our hearts again oh Lord Jesus as we commit uh ourselves unto you and this service unto you we want to put uh before you Lord the needs that has been uh mentioned oh Lord Jesus sister NTI who just had a fall oh Lord Jesus we just pray that you will heal her immediately Lord give her Lord Swift recovery so that uh she can walk and uh she can be whole oh Lord Jesus there's power in prayers oh Lord Jesus and as we as we confess it all Lord we know it's already done and as I put also before you Lord my two sisters uh uh atti betet and uh and uh ate at cell Lord they they are my older sisters we know they know you Lord somehow and through us oh Lord Jesus we've been uh sharing you to them oh Lord that you are the great God and you are the hope of all things and as we commit uh their lives unto you Lord may they know you Lord the power your the power of your Resurrection the power of your healing the power of your salvation all rest in you oh Lord Jesus and we commit their lives unto you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated again I'm sorry so I have two parts here uh that I wanted to share with you it's the missions report that we did uh last December and January so uh let's see how how long it would take but uh it's just to see uh it's good to see what what's going on on the other side it's not only in the Philippines but we went also to Hawaii and uh we want to show you some pictures amen and uh let's see so the chch the first church that we we visited is the the Church of BR Nestor Espanola uh word message Believers Fellowship it's in Santa Mesa Manila immediately when we are when I arrived December 20th actually my wife uh went there end of November and then I just followed but uh for me because of work I have to travel December 18th and then arrive there December 20th and uh they uh they didn't know that uh we were we were coming but then the thing is just by respect or courtesy just tell them that you are there and then they ask you to preach and uh you know to visit their their churches and it's a blessing amen uh we we need to be instant in season and out of season and we just have to be loaded with the word so that wherever we are called then we can we can be a blessing amen so I have some pictures uh that we have there uh so this is their Church basically so this is one day before the uh the camp meeting the first camp meeting that we attended and uh there's not so many people because they're getting ready to go because the it's about three and a half hours from Manila three three and a half hours from Manila the uh the camp site which is in Nev AA that's where brother Dany uh and and the rest of them built a a campsite basically and uh it's still ongoing and there's a lot of work there but I have pictures also for that so you can see their congregation here and uh you can see uh not much here so we just shared the uh the message of the hour because they they are also believers and uh they are one of the big churches also in Manila they have I don't know maybe three or 400 uh uh members there but this time is there already on the way to to the camp meeting so the second one that we attended is uh that's the elect bride assembly Global Outreach a that morning I preach and then in the afternoon we visited the the church where brother Ken and brother Barry preach before and the reason why we also visited this because we have friend here who was the preacher bar kri digs and he will be our preacher in next month amen and uh there he's a good friend and also the other preacher was uh brother uh Jack Duff and uh it was a great blessing also to to be with them and just to support the ministry and they they are the speakers for the other C meeting in Philippines so there are so so many camp meetings there in in in the Philippines and uh because they cannot fit in one Camp imagine the the number of Believers almost every Camp has a thousand attendees so which is good to see the Believers of different churches and they also come from different nations also we have they have from Japan Australia and and and and some other uh countries in Asia amen and uh it's good to see the them yeah brother Jack Duff is a very good singer I I they they sang actually even brother kyri because they're both song leaders before and uh we heard them in action amen it's good to see them and uh yeah these are the ministers that attended that uh we were there and uh yeah this brother re Orana is the host Pastor over there so yeah and the other pastors in in Philippines as well as well and this brother is the pastor in Japan so he's uh yeah in Yokohama so I think uh sister yeah sister Grace and and brother Andrew met him yeah so wherever you go just look for a message Church it might be there amen and it's good that uh even though you don't know them you have common denominator and uh they will let you in their house although they don't know you right as long as you you have the the message with you which is Christ amen it's good to Fellowship oh this one doesn't want to go maybe you can go with the next slide brother the sisters and then the next one yeah so and then after that immediately the next day we went to the first camp meeting and uh we're just supposed to attend but they asked me to speak the opening it's so difficult to not to be ready when when you're just attending and then they will let you uh you know it's an honor actually when uh when you attend and they will let you speak through people who are already Veterans of the message and uh we don't we don't say we we know the message but the gift in us we just have to surrender so these are the it's an opening in the evening there so they their their topic is from Vision to reality and I preached the the m Masterpiece here and it just jived with their team and uh uh good thing that we we bring all all the studies that we do and and and the the sermons and teachings and and uh that time I I challenge them actually it's about the baptism the right baptism and immediately they they cannot wait the next day three already decided to get baptized that same night and we're just so thankful we just need to challenge sometimes the the seed that was planted in that in in every person they just need to be watered and once that is Quicken then you cannot just wait so but in total we know there there are 15 Souls uh the next uh slide here so yeah this is their first night not many people already arrived but then uh yeah but that that evening I think they're around 400 or so so at least uh you can see this is the campsite that they built and we are you know with with our little uh uh donations from our church here they were able to you know it it's a good help for them we cannot afford all this because it's expensive but then with different churches putting their uh you know uh their donations together from North America Australia wherever they were able to put this together and this one is being used for the church now for the Believers for free of course there are some uh cost Associated of course right with the people food and whatnot but then at least the the venue is already free amen and we are part of that Calgary living world Assembly you're part of that mission amen so you the money that we put as offerings or missions they go to the right place amen and not only in Philippines but also other places like in Africa and and yeah but that's not the point the point I'm talking about here is uh the missions that we we do because I already mentioned before there are three uh three uh you can say uh groups uh of people that uh support a mission either you're praying you're financially uh uh donating or you're the one going right so you can categorize yourself where you you fit in that I know many will say oh I'll just pray because they don't want to give money but but that's not the point if you have something if God Gave You gives you something which is extra you can say or you know for your future then it means you're a good Steward of his Blessing amen we're not pulling money but then you know how blessing works right uh God loves a cheerful Giver amen so that's why all these things are happening because at the end of the day the purpose is to look for the last predestinated seed so that we can go to into Glory with him amen because uh later on I I'll put some slides so because we can go until that last seed is in until last that last seed is matured amen although we find that last last predestinated seed then is in the church he needs to mature that's why the five-fold ministry is important amen amen so we can see oh sorry yeah this you can see it's a basketball court and then they use it for for uh for big uh services like this amen and you can see uh this is the report from d b Danny I just uh I just put it there so that we can see the the result so at least 15 Souls were touched by that uh December 23rd to 26 amen which is amen one soul is worth 10,000 worlds amen so when when you witness to someone and uh and uh uh and he or she accepts it's it's a it's a crown Amen in our heads it's that's why we need to be used amen not not not just sitting here and I know this one is for maturity but then at the same time if you cannot go send someone amen so next slide you can see how many so approximately thousand thousand uh uh participants traveled by land and seas While others literally walked two days in the mountains as the waves in the seas are so high so there are so also delegates from Japan amen so it's a good Fellowship amen amen and uh you can see the the condition there so some uh were intense yeah so and they also built a dormitory there and it's full because of thousand people it's difficult to to manage but then most churches are uh responsible for their own members so they bought some tents also amen and for their food as well uh they have to bring food because you cannot just feed a thousand people so so it's it's a collaboration amen it's not competition it's collaboration amen so you can see there oops uh this kind of sensitive okay next one all right okay so yeah there there it's a big uh it's a big land and then there's a lot of uh improvements there so yeah he was saying here the drainage system they were able to to do the canals you see uh it's a lot of work amen uh and it needs a lot of uh uh Financial uh blessing to go to them because uh they're just they're kind of big church but then the thing is with with the amount of work that will be done here it will be a lot amen but uh they were able to to do it progressively because you cannot do this at one time it's a lot of uh a lot of uh require uh Financial requirements amen yeah that's me and my wife actually so yeah with this is Brother Nestor you know him and brother Jun this is a pastor also and another Pastor brother cha brother Danny and the wife sister Sabel amen uh so okay let's go forward it's kind of fck brother okay there you go so you see they've been doing the water tank the electrical outdoor shower rooms and restrooms so that uh if uh if because they've been inviting International speakers as well so you know the the problem in North America we have we are so comfortable that when you go there you want your washrooms to be same as here but uh it's impossible so they they're trying their best to to do that too so yeah so you see all the young people they Reed some goodies here amen and uh praise the Lord amen that's the that's the first camp we attended and the second camp we attended is uh the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ Family Camp that's the home church or original home Church of the aqu Queens sister Zena and uh bar Cyrus and the their dad barelis is the is the pastor there uh and and the Apostle as well and uh you can see yeah we were there on the 26th which is a Thursday amen and uh oops oh next next slide brother so I think uh I don't know how many they they attended but uh they're also big uh big uh so many churches collaborated in the first Camp around 35 36 churches 36 pastors here also it's the same thing but then the thing is they are all over the Philippines and they you know the Philippines has 7,700 Islands so you cannot just you know bring all of them so now what they're trying to do uh with Brothers helis is uh they're trying to to to uh decentralize you can say the the camps so they have in in in the South as well so that's why they're building a new Campground in uh in in the South uh in Mindanao area so they they needed help on that that's why we we we also help a little bit our church with that small you can say we're not big church but uh with any amount that's why all our children are are Inus when you show them that even their $5 $10 $15 makes uh you know it it will help them it will help uh you know that that will go a little bit far when they are put together amen so yeah so that one so my wife was testifying here I know I didn't have a good good uh uh good shot of the picture here but uh she was test testifying of the the healing of our of her mom my mother-in-law which happened here basically uh through our prayers when when uh brother kyri digs was preaching here and uh at the end of the service uh it's a prayer uh it's like it's not an altar call but uh he ask us to stand and raise our hands and uh ask for our prayers and then my wife SE seated with Lynn uh in that uh area there uh she she was uh you know uh raising her hand and then what she said to herself is if the preacher will touch my hand my mom will will be healed and walk again because uh my mother-in-law fell also right and then uh she was bedridden for many months but then that evening or that that service you know brother kyri I think she he was here and we were there and I'm I'm in the middle and then brother kyri just went there and touched my my wife's uh hand if he will touch somebody's hand he should have come through me first but then he went uh to the other side there and he she testified on that and many were blessed and even even uh sister Linda it's very uh similar right I mean the fate of my wife made their whole amen right because sometimes although they're not Believers it's our faith remember we preach on Ezekiel 37 he was prophesying Ezekiel was prophesying to dead Dry Bones right and it's the faith of the one Speaking that made those bones to put in line and become alive amen so this kind of testimonies they're powerful God is still healing amen amen and uh it's good to to share the testimonies that we have amen it will bless someone amen so amen so amen that's and then the the third church that we we visited is we flew through that and this is one of the churches that got uh hit uh by the flooding the the typhoon but they were not flooded like the one that we helped with brother Ryan but we visited them as well so you can see it's brother Victor's this is their kind congregation not so big but uh uh you know they they love the Lord amen and they claim that they believe the message of the hour amen so yeah this is this is Pastor Vic and this is Pastor Ryan and the wife and the this the Deacon of brother Ryan so we visited imagine the sister here it's the first time to to meet them they are in the same they're in the same island maybe around 30 minutes it's away because of different doctrines before in the Philippines they don't Fellowship but then when you come and you're neutral you're trying to to be an instrument so that you can you know break some walls of or barriers and you know how it goes right with the story of the duck the Ducks they're on different uh different uh fences and then they don't fellowship and then they're wondering why they don't Fellowship so the only way to make them Fellowship is raise the water which is the water of the word right then uh one once the that word is raised then all the Ducks will come out of their denominational thinking or barriers amen and now they are fellowshipping which is praise the Lord thank hallelujah amen so yeah they gave us a an North American breakfast actually praise the Lord they thought that we're uh we're not used with Filipino food but we are praise the Lord with h and uh eggs and they're good people amen you can see amen that's the wife sister Vicki yeah amen praise the Lord and uh this is uh in Bol area and uh actually this is on top of their church and this uh volcano is a Mayon Volcano the it's Ren n for its perfect cone so it's a when you go to to that area for sure they will boast on this uh uh it's a good scener actually for us we we we were we were born in Loon which is close to Manila and we only studied this in our subjects in in the school but then when it comes to Revelation you might read it you might see it in the picture but you don't you don't see it and I mean you don't uh recognize or or appreciate it until you go there so we we went to the to the to this area and then now it's not anymore in the books we already saw it so it's totally revealed to us that it's really beautiful you can see it's a Kind of Perfect amen so but it's a volcano so it erupts almost every year right so but they got used to it so anyway so so brother brother vickel is you see during that typhoon all because uh his fences are made of bamboo and wood you know how it goes so it just fell and you know with little money so we told them okay so we were able to help little right with this little uh uh little Sacrifice from us uh it will help the church so at least because they were flooded as well it went maybe 2T deep only in this area but it went inside the church so he wanted to to build a fence concrete wall so that at least the water will not get in because I don't know their their location I told them you're very accommodating you accommodate every flood or every typhoon that come you're so kind it's a it's true story though I mean because that area is it's in the middle and it's in the Pacific so it's a they they receive a lot of typhoons every year I don't know how many but too much amen so but uh but they are resilient right so so we're we're thankful that we have those kind of people amen because they need to survive so the the the fourth church we attended is brother martial olena this all of them I didn't know them before so we went there and just uh we we only knew brother Ryan because of communication but then the other pastors we didn't know but then you know the reason why we go there is so that we can see for ourselves right it's not only by picture so we can we can see that there's a real need wherever you go there's always a need amen so that's uh brother marial oliven so so we went there in the evening and uh yeah their church is also needing some of this uh ceiling and we helped them a little bit and then immediately what we gave them the little money they already built it and it was done only needs painting and now they use it already for for their service right so you can see before so it's good to to see where your man is going also right it's direct to them amen so praise the Lord that's the that's the fourth church that we attended I didn't preach on that uh third and fourth but on the fifth one because uh the plan is so that we we can gather all of them in one location so it's not difficult for the preacher also so we went to the fifth Church which is the house of God's word ministry which is Brian brother Ryan mendosa's Church uh this is where we helped before to to to give them some good this and uh you know and this is the one that has 10 to 12 feet of flood so you you have seen it before I I showed you before this one and then when I when we went there so this is the actually this is the house of brother Chad one of the deacons and musician and uh this is a uh an access to the to the church because the church is this side and brother Chad's uh house is this side so you can see this is the first floor almost this is already subsided for about 2 feet or something so and then when we went there I I was here so you can see the it's already subsided so I think this this is a video brother maybe if you can play it yeah so that's the same thing so at least uh you can see something growing already right so yeah it's a good location if there's no flood for sure right there's something to to to look forward to see and and anyway the beauty of the the place is with the people anyway right wherever you go if there's no believer or there's no no one that uh you know uh that uh that you are uh same like you with like Precious Faith then it's a difficult uh location wherever wherever you go amen and that's why we have to look for wherever you go even even in vacation you have to look for believers amen and uh you will have good fellow ship amen next slide brother yeah and then uh this is before the morning service we have a breakfast here this time is a Filipino breakfast which is good amen uh yeah that's the the morning you can see maybe their their congregations about 100 or so including children 100 120 but the morning service is dedic uh is for their service so we didn't invite the other churches and in the afternoon we did and then it's even Fuller or I mean more people that came during the the afternoon and yeah so these are pastors this is Pastor Vic and this is Pastor Gary and other pastors uh behind I don't know the names but uh they were able to Fellowship together when we were there and we're so glad and immediately after that service then there someone anniversaries in their churches and they invited each other then uh they're now fellowshipping and then they will have a camp meeting now which is good because uh it's good to Fellowship right it's unifying time our our theme during when we were there is about the unity of the Brethren basically so because we have common denominators Jesus Christ amen and now they're fellowshipping not only these pastors but other pastors as well so which is praise the Lord I think uh that's a uh that's the good uh thing that happened there and uh we know the word is always the word they never heard new message or preaching but then at least there's a you can say new blood that came in that is neutral that doesn't side with any other Doctrine but the doctrine of the message of the hour and the Bible amen so which is good amen we're thankful for that yeah there some pictures here then of course after preaching again the afternoon food again so you know how it goes when you when you preach or when you visit churches it's always food after amen not natural spiritual food and then natural food amen all right so yeah okay so this is before we left to our hotel and then went back to Manila then the next church we visited is uh yeah this time I I preach at brother Reay sanos Church in pasig January 1st their New Year's uh service so yeah we we were able to uh pour out some uh some of the gift that that's in us and uh we were blessed and uh yeah I think they have around 600 people or 600 members uh I think cuz sister Shel went there before they were not able to fit in one location but they were able to to rent a big location now so all of the five groups can can go together but uh this is a Wednesday and uh it's not so much maybe half of them only or something but then I I again reiterated the the testimony of my wife and they were thankful because it's a Wednesday uh it's a Wednesday and then also I I I uh shared the testimony of sister uh hilderbrand sister Becky because it's a it's a Wednesday and it's even at the worship service she was healed she she was asked to raise her hand to stand up and raise her hand and and she was healed so you see how it goes I know at first first and two pools is about natural healing but then later on we go to the third pool which is the healing of the Soul right so it's just to to get the the big fish so you have to you know give them because God still heals physically amen he didn't uh Divine Healing is still present with us although we have the word fully but we have the Divine Healing as well amen which is physically and both physically and spiritually amen okay so after that we went to Hawaii but then the thing is uh because the first seven are in Philippines this is the lamp's wife assembly brother Eduardo evasco I didn't visit the church this is uh uh Sister C's son and sister Emily's brother uh and this church the pastor there the former Pastor is uh brother Danny Bernardo he was the one who baptized me and my wife in 20052 2006 they're part of our lives right so because uh they were the one one witness to me brother Dandy who is in Qatar he's the pastor now but the former Pastor there also pass away and uh brother Danny brother Danny and and and brother hermy they all pass away in 2018 same as brother Ken so it's a yeah it's kind of sad uh year for us 2018 and then my mom also passed away 2018 so and then I asked the Lord what what's going on so hard you're going to take everyone uh that we love but then the thing is there's something for us right so we need to go ahead and we know that they're in a better place than us amen do you think that they would want to come back I don't think so this flesh is is is our number one enemy right not other people right so it's uh so he he sent us some uh some pictures of the construction actually the need in in this church uh in in Ed's church is uh because the church that they are uh fellowshipping now they will demolish that church they're just renting so a good brother or a family just donated a good land so that they can build a church so yeah I told Brother Barry as well and uh uh you know this is ongoing right now so they're building a church on that land so that they will have their own church we know it's not about church building or you know uh uh building building schools or universities or whatever but then you need the place to worship isn't it wonderful when you can sit like this and then we can talk about the Lord right so you know there's balance right we don't need to spiritualize everything we need also something that we can uh uh you know we can uh it's a physical building although the Tabernacle of God is in man us but this is the house of the Lord where we can Fellowship amen so we we we help as well so you see so many churches little little little then later on you you are part of the their Ministry the part of the work there which is good and it will encourage us even to give more because uh we are registered organization and anything that we put it's tax deductible right so which is good I mean uh we just want to take advantage of that blessing in Philippines there's nothing like that and anything that you you give to the church there's no return right so unlike here we we have that uh uh privilege amen so you see the construction there yeah so they have the walls already so and then putting the beams and columns which is good so this is yeah this the perspective so you will see the end result so yeah we will we'll try to to help progressively even me personally I I want to help them because uh not only because they are part of me because uh they were the one used but then we want them to be a blessing also to to look for the last Souls as well right and then for them to mature amen so so this is this is the thing in uh in Laguna s Pedro Laguna okay and uh in Hawaii after the after in Philippines There Was An Open Door there so we were able to hold the first service in onol Lulu so you know wherever you go you're just like a mobile church right so so I was the uh so miles was one of the musicians and Paul is the other one and I I song L and became the MC so that uh brother Danny can can preach so you can see it's in onol Lulu January 7th Tuesday so regardless of time because Sunday there it's the wedding that we attended right right so or Saturday is the wedding and then Sunday the church that we Ed belong to a denominational uh Pastor who has a is kind of he calls himself Bishop so he has other churches in the Philippines and this is his church and also his house is just he has a an AC and you can see here this is in in the east coast of uh uh Hawaii Honolulu in Oahu Island so this is the church and you can see the inside there so we were able to to hold the service here amen yeah this brother Dany and these are this the two couples brother Randy and Sister Laura they're Believers even before us maybe because during brother lony Jenkins and uh yeah he I think he visited Hawaii last time and they they attended I I don't know uh not much of but they were there and they're just there without any Fellowship so we were able to to get in touch with them and then they attended right and uh yeah brother Dany uh this is brother Mario and BR Warren and and the wife sister Mary so and they are from Phoenix Arizona from brother Ron Peterson and brother Mario already preached here you might uh recognize him amen and this are the attendees maybe you know this couple also they were there as well right yeah and uh yeah this is Sister Verna the the wife of the bishop there or pastor and they're in the denomination but then the thing is well brother Danny was preaching she was also preaching back come on come on yeah yeah claim it claim it yeah which is which is so good to to hear she was pulling on the word amen and uh my wife and I BR Dany yeah sister Josephine and the rest oh and sister merley she's from Oregon because of the wedding we were able to to uh have a little reunion amen so which is good so and uh yeah right now uh there's one more family that that's a Believer there that's the sister of Sister josephin Sister Leia but uh they were not available at that time but now brother Randy and sister Leia's family are fellowshipping and then they wanted to to share with the men's meeting that they have what the message is hopefully let's pray for them you know it's good to go to Hawaii and then there's a church right so it's it's not an invitation but at least it's an attraction so yes amen so yeah and these are most of us right so yeah the the Chua family peda family yeah and the Arisa family yeah we we were about 25 or so yeah the during that church service you need only a family or even a two family or two right to start a church and then as long as you're you're witnessing then you can you can proceed amen all right then then again food God bless you for that yeah so let's go to the so I hope uh you'll be encouraged to help also in in in missions right so because uh it's good to be used amen and like I've said if we want to be blessed be a good Steward because everything belongs to God and if he gives you extra extra extra it means there's a need that is required so that that extra will be uh given to to the needs right so maybe yeah let's go to the to the preaching and uh and have only 30 minutes let's see how how far we can go I know understanding the godhead is very crucial but we will we will break some some uh scriptures here that we haven't heard and most we have heard but then from a different perspective at least it can solidify right our understanding of the godhead and why do we need to know the godhead and why do we need to be baptized the right way all all these things amen and uh we have we are one room Schoolhouse so bear with me if if it's two Elementary but then but then you know it's it's good to be reminded right because sometimes oh we thought that we already know but then there's there's more to it because Perfection means we have to know about the word amen the full word not partial word amen so let's uh let's just uh stand to our feet and uh read again uh scripture here Deuteronomy 6:4 here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord may the Lord blessing of on the reading of his word you may be seated again amen so let's uh read some or let's have a little bit of study here so I have a lot of scriptures but then uh I didn't put them on the slid so at least it's not uh heavy heavily focused on slides but then as the Lord leads amen so we can see here in Deuteronomy 6:4 it's a basic thing that about the Oneness of the Lord right uh and uh if if it is in the Old Testament and because Jesus Christ never changed he's the same yesterday and today and forever we need to understand why there are so many doctrines about the godhead being one being two being three or being many or being none right but then for us we were taught very well by the prophet of this age that uh we have one God in three manifestations not three persons right right so so let's uh let's let us study it together amen so that there will be a good understanding amen so we can see here the Oneness of God in Isaiah 446 brother so we can see the Bible teaches that God is one not three separate beings but one God man manifesting himself in different ways right so Isaiah 446 if you if you can put it up I'm I'm I'm trying to uh at least we can have a a good foundation so that we know the god that we worship it's difficult not to know is it the father is it the son is it the Holy Spirit but then at the end of the day if we have that uh understanding which is a mystery before then it will become a history to us and it will be one God right it's just one God but then manifested in in three different offices in three different roles right so Isaiah 446 thus said the Lord the king of Israel and his Redeemer the Lord of hosts I am the first and I am the last and beside me there is no God Amen so these are Good Foundations and then in in verse Isaiah 455 I will be a little bit slow so at least uh if you're taking notes at least you can you can study it again amen it's a especially if those who are not yet baptized the right way right we need we need to understand this it's not because your parent told told you or your parents told you that you need to be bapti you have to do it no you have to do it from your own volition understanding the the requirement amen and you need to be baptized the right way and what and and the importance of that name we need to know the name of the Lord amen so Isaiah 455 brother I am the lord and there is none else there is no God beside me so you see so that's Oneness there is only one God and he has revealed himself through his word and his son Jesus Christ The Mighty God unveiled in paragraph 1 before amen I I I even even the even the message uh quotes I we we won't be posting but then the thing is this all came from from the message amen and the scriptures amen so with that three manifestation maybe uh let's put it okay the father being God above us right I have a I have a uh you can put the the PowerPoint again brother so you can see this is a popular one because I I'm always preaching this uh but then the thing is you have to build on it so that there will be understanding and then uh when when you talk about it if like an appetizer you have to dig deeper into it and then stay with it right so you can see we're from eternity to Eternity and then there are important m Stones here but then we're talking about godhead so I will put the first one which is God about uh the the dispensation of the godhead the first one is God AB us which is the father dispensation and with the father dispensation we can maybe you can just open your Bibles here Malachi 2:10 you don't need to remove this here brother so that at least we can use our bibles if not then I will read it clearly anyway about the father God above us right Malachi 2:10 because we've been we've been pampered in not bringing our Bible sometimes because everything is there but we we need to to open also our Bibles right so at least we know where they are coming from amen Malachi 2:10 have we not all one father had not one God created us so you can see this father dispensation which is God above us is about the creat creation also he's the Creator amen and uh he wanted to to to to show us that uh he's the same God Amen at this time Jesus Christ is not there in the father dispensation Jesus because uh Jesus later on he became the son right so so that's Malachi 2:10 have we not all one father had not one God created us and then another vers is Isaiah 63:16 sorry there will be a lot of verses yeah Isaiah 63:16 doubtless Thou Art Our Father Isaiah 63:16 though Abraham be ignored of us and Israel acknowledge us not thou oh Lord art Our Father Our Redeemer thy name is from Everlasting amen so you can see so in the old Testament God was above his people in a pillar of fire guiding them he was known as Jehovah God the father of all creation amen so you can see the that's the fatherhood dispensation amen how about the son son's dispensation you can see sorry brother we will be flipping here and there so at least so that's the goded dispensation God above us the father and then now God with us which is the son right so let's let's uh read some ma Matthew Matthew 1:23 maybe you don't need to to to put the let let them read it in their Bibles brother so at least it can be shown Matthew 1:23 amen Behold a virgin shall be with a child or a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us amen so that's Matthew 1:23 and in John 1:14 we know this and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen so we can see here God With Us in in in in in manifested in Jesus Christ amen before father and then now he's in the Sun so let's proceed here so that at least and then after that he is in the form of the Holy Spirit God in us amen so that's the Holy Ghost and you can see in John 14 14618 amen John 14:16 to18 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you Hallelujah so you can see here it's so important to know that uh it's in a dispensation it's it's like uh uh brother Branham explained it very well that uh God is like uh uh he and morphe he's changing mask amen right we we know all of this but what I'm saying is for those who who who who are not yet sold out with with what the Bible is saying we want to re reiterate it so that uh it will be clear for us so we have only one God in three manifestations right to to to simplify this godhead this dispensation right so it means it's just one God changing his mask in the Old Testament he's the father they're following him in the pillar of Fire by by night and pillar of cloud by day right he was the one who who uh who guided the Israelites wherever they go amen and uh you can see and then once that dispensation is done when Jesus Christ is here right he is God With Us amen right because he he was born but the reason why he he he came to that uh dispensation is because we know God is a spirit amen right and if if God is a spirit he cannot die right and we know that without shedding of blood there is no remission in Hebrews amen so that's the reason why he came as in the form of a flesh but that that that doesn't mean he is not God In the Flesh because it's the scripture that is God in flesh he dwelt Among Us John 1:14 amen and then when he left before he left actually he told them I cannot send you the comforter while I'm here that's the reason why he has to go so that he can send another comforter which is the Holy Ghost that's why there's a holy ghost dispensation amen and that is in us right now amen which is so good amen uh just putting all this and then we will we will read more amen so you can see the father we call the Father the L Lord right uh Sarah called Abraham Lord amen and the son we call him Jesus and the Holy Ghost we call him Christ so the fullness of the godhead dwelleth in the Lord Jesus Christ bodily right Lord Jesus Christ godhead dispensation one God three manifestations not three persons like the trinitarians are are teaching because uh trinitarians they're saying there are three persons in one God you cannot have one God and then there are three persons distinct persons personality means it's a person right so it's the same God different roles different mask amen I hope that's clear enough I know it's it's clear for us but even the younger ones or who who who don't uh who don't read the Bible amen and you can see this uh wheel of Prophecy here whatever God is it's also Jesus so you see here this is a good tool actually when when you want to B to have Bible study in your devotions right for example here Jesus is coming 1 Thessalonians 31-13 God is also coming you can see on the opposite side the complimentary thing here you can see they're all pointing to one God right God is the creator but Jesus also is the creator you see all the verses here in the Bible so this is like a summary so that we know when we study we know the god that we worship we know the god that we serve amen so it's important it's a teaching and and we know teaching places us so that we can have faith in what we believe amen so all this thing God is the REM Deemer and savior we we read that God the shepherd God the king God I am and the I am he God the first and the last God The Rock God is coming but then on the opposite sides of all of this is all Jesus so it's manifested in Jesus all these attributes of God attributes mean thought right we know God wanted to be a Healer be before everything else is Elohim right Elohim means self-existing one and with with him in his thought in his mind he wanted to be a father so it's how how can you be a father when you're alone right but then even before he wanted to be a father he wanted to be God but then God is an object of worship am right so no one else can worship him without him creating that's why he what what he did first he created angels so that the angels can worship him then he can be God Amen so the other attributes that he wanted to to manifest is to become a Healer right to become a Healer there should be sickness first right you cannot you cannot manifest the attribute of being a Healer which is him right by stripes we are healed right without without sickness that's the reason why we're we have sickness colds or whatever right whatever we have but then it's not only for healing it's for salvation by Stripes that that that uh uh death on the cross is not only for healing it's also for salvation amen and salvation is that's the healing of the Soul right so healing of the Natural Body and healing of the Soul so that's why for us we when we believe and we accepted the Lord Jesus Christ fully we're not afraid of death because whether we live or whether we die we are his we we know our destination right anything in between we know he's the Alpha and the Omega but who is the in between is also the same God that is in us right now to fulfill what he didn't finish amen because we have a we have a calling here we're not here because of coincidence Amen in his mind he he wanted to be a father that's why we are here he needs to create Sons and Daughters right so it's a you can say it's a masculine and feminine sometimes or it's a pair right if uh if there's a bridegroom there must be a bride if there is a father there must be Sons and Daughters if if if there's a king there's a queen and all this manifestations right if there is sickness there will be a Healer right if there is a mayor there will be constituents right if there is a judge there will be subjects uh there will be a throne uh uh judgment bar where where you will judge other people so you see all these attributes were manifested in Jesus Christ and then the bride and we're so thankful even being Sinners right we were made whole or because of his grace we are able to to to to manifest what he in his thoughts are amen so you see this wheel of Prophecy you we can have this if if you want I can send it to you and and uh these are very powerful scriptures and it's we don't need to reinvent the will that okay I will read the Bible uh cover to cover and which is good we need that but then what I'm saying is if if you have a topic that you wanted to to understand there are already men before us who who did the work right right if if you don't have much time to to do it but then at the end of the day we need to eat the full course meal we we just don't need to eat the appetizers right we we we need everything we need everything think of this uh uh for God's word right so it's just like in an all you can eat restaurant right right it is you pay one price but you have to you are able or or I mean you're allowed to get all the food that is serving that all you can eat right it will not be served to you right maybe they will serve drinks in some restaurants but then typically it's up to you who will ask or or who will take what food you will eat so think of that food like the promises in in the word of God right all the promises are here and they are available through Jesus Christ because he paid the price for All Things amen so that's why the book the promises here uh the promises I think baren gave us all all that book you can see if you're l L if you're angry if you have marital problem if you have Financial issues everything is there that's why this Bible brothers and sisters is enough for us to live not only to live naturally but spiritually until eternity amen so think of that all you can eat restaurant amen with all the promises of the Bible amen and that is already paid by Jesus Christ because of his blood amen so good to to understand and the the goodness of the Lord and He revealed it to us right through a through the Vindicated prophet of this age amen let's see the the next slide here and then uh we will break some of the uh the other uh verses that uh that are so good to to understand amen so Jesus Christ being everything because uh the fullness of the godhead dwelleth in him bodily right so when he came his first coming is to redeem his bride this is from birth to Calvary so 0 ad to 33 ad amen that is his first coming his second coming is to catch away his bride which is the the Rapture that we're waiting for amen and we know we are already in the Rapture because uh when you accepted the message of the hour when you accepted the full word in its hour in its entirety you are already in the Rapture because you'll be changed from glory to glory as you feed right feeding the word means you will become the word we will become the word as we feed because we are what we eat amen if we feed if we feed social media we'll be like uh the rest of uh those who we follow amen so that's why we need to feed the word every Christian must feed the word of God and I'm guilty because uh we only feed sometimes uh intermittently but then it's it's required we have only two Services every week I've been telling this you think try to eat naturally two times a week let's see what happens to us right so we will be malnourished right so it's the same for the word of God if we will only eat when while we are here that's why the calling to us is to feed on the Bible right so that we will become the word right so that we will know his ways how can we know his ways if we don't fellowship with him right so I'm guilty uh I'm preaching to myself every time because uh every preacher must preach to themselves first right so that it it will manifest but then the thing is it's good to understand all those principles Amen to be to be caught away we need to mature amen because the Lord cannot marry an immature bride so we need to mature how can mature because at first when somebody witness to us then they will bring you to church right why so that they you will grow because spiritual growth go it's through the church through through the preaching of the word you cannot just be looking for people and then they have nowhere to go that's why we need the churches right the capital c church not only the the denominational churches we we're talking about the full church that believe the the full word of God Amen full go El so to catch away his bride that is his second coming and this is from Pentecost Pentecost means 50th day because after Jesus Christ was crucified and died and then he he resurrected after third day and on for 40 days together with the Old Testament Saints they were roaming around Jerusalem and uh showing themselves to people but then the thing is Jesus Christ gave the Commandment to to to the disciples to uh on what needs to be done and then the Holy Ghost came while they were in the upper room they were waiting for how many days 10 days right for 40 days Jesus Christ was with them and then uh uh he was teaching them what needs to be done and then on the uh he went to heaven he was raptured and then on the 10th day after 40 days and the and then the plus the 10th day then he came back in the form of the Holy Ghost that's the reason why it's called Pentecost 50th day right so 40 days he was on land or or on on Earth with the disciples and and some Believers and then within that 10 days they were waiting they were taring in Jerusalem in the upper room and that's very important because that's the Commandment from him T in in Jerusalem until you will be endured with power on high right so you see there's an importance in taring in waiting we cannot just think of our in our own mind we need the mind of Christ in making decisions right so we if we say oh uh as the Lord leads sometimes we don't understand what that means because we are already made we already made up our mind right when we when we pray to the Lord for his will we need to be neutral it means whatever whether left or right as long as it's the will of the lord we will follow it doesn't although sometimes of course we want this and this and this but then God God's answer is uh it's either yes no or wait right so it means it doesn't mean he didn't answer it means it's not good for us if if what we prayed for is not according to his will so that's why we need to be neutral every time amen and it's important to understand that so from Pentecost to the seven Church ages I know these are not brand new uh thing but then they are related to godhe that's why I I wanted to oops sorry the third coming is to reign with his bride in the Millennium so for a thousand years he will reign as king and we will be the queen but then being king and queen we cannot just rule without without uh subjects right so it mean we must have a domain that's why I know it's a deeper teaching here that there will be hens in the Millennium right so because uh it's also scriptural because you are king and queen and Millennium is not yet the the new heavens and new earth this is not eternity yet right this is 1,000 years meaning we are still in the element of time that's why being king and queen here is when you will come that's his third coming amen so let's see here just uh good uh representation of uh the cross of Calvary here before man and God are one but because of sin they were separated right so with this one just for easy representation so that we will understand we need the cross of Calvary so that man can be connected to God again amen and that's the reason why he came as a man the sun means it's a flesh God is veiled in flesh which is Jesus himself amen yeah so maybe let's uh let's digest it a bit so it's good sometimes uh pictures are better to to understand right so than than words amen we have 11 minutes okay if if we won't finish we'll somehow later on if there's a chance okay okay and then the other one God is a spirit and he that worship Him must Spirit uh must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen but then the thing is all that God was where did he pour into Christ think of this these are good graphics you won't find them in in uh in Google but you will find them maybe it will generate be generated by chat GPT all right but uh but the rest is all the revelation of God right so it's not we have to use the tools right amen we were that's why we're in golden age right so we have to use all the tools for his goodness sometimes we don't need to to write and then it will take you forever to to write something or you know so but be we're just using the proper tools amen but the Revelation comes from the Lord amen so think of this as a spirit but with a form right he doesn't have a form before he's a fountain of spirit amen and all that God was he poured it into Jesus Christ here amen so where is God now because that thing kenosis bar barberry in the unveiling of God he he explained that when you're trying to empty yourself it's not like emptying and then you're nothing you're still the same person that went to that or same uh same being that went into that right so he emptied himself he poured it into Christ so what where is God now so it's in Jesus Christ fully right that's why we're talking about Oneness also right so all that Christ was he poured it into the many membered body church right so you see so we we somebody I think Brother David someone yeah he and I I I mentioned that that it's just like like a fountain of water you will drink it right and then that spirit is in you already so it means all that God was he poured all of his Spirit he poured it into Jesus Christ that's why Jesus Christ is the fullness of the godhead bodily there's no other parallel that he poured into all right we have to go through that body right that son Jesus Christ before we can receive the Holy Ghost right so that's why God in spirit he poured into Jesus Christ the son and to many member body am amen so where is God now it's in us right so that's why God in us the hope of glory that's that simplifies everything amen oh this this the last but then the thing is let's let's break some scriptures here okay okay you can uh let's do this it's beautiful amen are you good I hope you're not uh uh bored there's not so many it's just yeah okay so water baptism the biblical way yeah we know most are already baptized but then some are not but then why maybe they yeah it's not understood yet yet or it's not yet time because God knows the time amen so in Mark 16:16 brother there will be a lot of verses okay and then uh I think we have time to to finish this Mark 16:16 amen he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be D so you see we need to be baptized amen and in 1 Peter 3212 to 1 Peter 32122 the like figure where unto even baptism do also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ and then 22 who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of God angels and authorities and Powers being made subject unto him so you can see and then another one Matthew 28:19 and 20 and then we'll uh Matthew 28:19 we know this go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptized ing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world so Matthew 28:19 it says baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit but think of this is Father a son ah is Father a name is son a name is Holy Ghost a name no it's just like me saying I am the father of miles and Lynn right I am the husband of Faith but what's my name mvin right mvin and then my wife has no claim for me to be although she she calls me dad right but but then she's not my daughter right she's my she's my wife right that's how we call right Dad or Mom or but then the thing is that claim and and and and and Lyn and Miles uh don't have any claim for me to be the husband or wife right or the husband or or anything or grandfather so I'm I am mvin but I am a father I am a son also because I'm I'm the son of my my parents right but my name is mvin so let's go to acts 238 now so that we would know what the name of that father son and holy spirit amen in Acts 238 brother these are basic ones but then let's put them together right so at least uh at least we are clear why why we're doing this because uh sometimes in preaching we only tackle it little but then the whole thing is is so important acts 238 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ why for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost remember this scenario in Acts 238 they just received the the Holy Ghost in Acts one and that is just 10 days because the Pentecost came after their meeting with Jesus Christ for 40 days that's why it's called Pentecost so 10 days you think 10 days you you're that forgetful when he taught you all things right and then he even said the comforter will bring everything into your remembrance he will be your guide he will be your teacher that Holy Ghost when they receive the Holy Ghost do you think Peter did the wrong thing no and to prove the point also we know it's in it's in the message also there's $1 million bet or or or reward for anyone who would say or or who can uh show in the Bible where anyone was baptized in the name of the father son Holy Spirit no one so that's a bold statement 1 million that's long time ago so maybe it's already 1 billion now let's make it one trillion right to prove the point you cannot prove it in the Bible that anyone is baptized in the name of the father son holy spirit because the father is not a name son is not a name father is not a name it's an attribute it's it's it's a manifestation of the same God it's not three different persons right it's the same person amen Oh Glory so what will you do if you're not baptized the right way way so if because uh you know my testimony I was baptized three times first as a Catholic an infant and then in the Evangelical trinitarian way but then when they showed this to me oh my goodness I have to be baptized again the third time the right way because that's what the Bible said and it's in Acts 19 Let's uh do that brother 191 to5 let let's read it together so that you every everyone would know that if you're not baptized the right way you need to be re-baptized because even in the Bible let's read it and it came to pass that while Apollos what was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have ye received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism then said Paul John the Baptist verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus when they heard this what did they do they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so you see oh yes if you're not properly baptized because the Commandment is repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for what for the remission of sins full forgiveness of sins and what will happen then and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost so you see following all the steps is mandatory amen and we need to know that name that we that we uh that we worship and that that importance of the name every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess amen that's why that name is important so let's uh let's read another scripture here as we are closing maybe I'll invite the musicians I'll I'll put uh yeah I still have a lot here but uh yeah I'll invite the musicians so at least we won't take so much let's see here good one okay John 11:25 brother and we we'll close on this John 11:25 Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live so with this verse brothers and sisters he's saying right uh he's the resurrection so it means Resurrection is a person right so that means if Jesus Christ you can you can check the Bible it's it's a good study you will not find anyone in the Bible or or any instance in the Bible that Jesus Christ attended a funeral although very close is in uh uh but let's read it so at least we can close okay Luke 7:12 to15 let's read it brother Luke 72-15 these are three three instances in the Bible so that at least it will encourage us why why we we need to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ because he's the resurrection and the life amen so looks 72-15 this is the raising of the Widow's son at name okay okay 7:12 okay look 712 that's good now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her Jesus had compassion on her and said unto her whip not and he came and touched the beer and he said young man I say unto thee arise and he that was dead set up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother so Jesus encountered this funeral procession in and raised the Widow's son from the Dead showing his compassion and power over death am so you see because he's the resurrection and the life they cannot come mingle death and life cannot come mingle right it's just like uh light and Shadow cannot or light and dark light and darkness cannot commingle one should go away amen so the power of death Jesus Christ has that power the second one the raising of Jus da daughter we're just putting this as a single scripture pointing to different scriptures so that we would know that uh a resurrection is a person the life is a person he's the way the truth and the life right so amen so let's read Mark 538 to 42 summarized Mark 538 okay and he come to the house of the ruler of synagogue and seeth the T tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly and he was and when he was coming he said unto them why make you this ado and Weep the Dum cell is not dead this is Gyro's daughter but sleep it and he took the Dum cell by the hand and said unto her talita Kumai that means uh that means I say unto thee arise amen and what happened and straight way the damel arose and walked amen Jesus was called to the home of gyus whose daughter had died despite the morning Jesus raised her from the dead displaying his authority over life and then the last one the rising of Lazarus this is the very closest one that is uh like a because he was already buried for 3 Days right four days buried for 4 days but God is never late in his appointments amen he's for this late but he's still on time let's read it John 11:38 [Music] brother 1138 okay Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it Jesus said take ye away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead said unto him Lord by this time he stinet for he had been dead four days Jesus said unto her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of God then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou Hast heard me and I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by I said that they may believe that thou Hast sent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice loud voice is a shout brother and that loud voice is the voice of the resurrection and he called what Lazarus come Fort he has to call his name otherwise all the Sleeping Saints will come up and be resurrected so in this in this time it's not yet time for for for for for the whole uh Humanity to to resurrect amen so that's why he he called his name Lazarus come forth and then what happened and he had and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin Jesus said unto them lose him and let him go then Mar of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did believed on him Brothers you can see here that uh the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ is life death and life cannot coexist amen and I will put this even further for the Bride of this last age we can have the same Greater Works as what Jesus did we because we we can impart eternal life that's what it is when we're trying to witness to somebody we're trying to impart eternal life right because even you are dead in this flesh yet you will live because Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ the name of the god that we serve right is the way and he is the truth and is the life amen all into it it's a person that's why where where is God right now in us with all the things that we have just shown here he's living in us that's why we have a very uh big responsibility here on Earth brothers and sisters right to impart eternal life is our duty to to to all our friends to all our colleagues to our to all our families but then the thing is that's the the essence of knowing who God Is Right which is the Lord Jesus Christ and knowing who we are and we have the the Oneness with the Lord at that day you shall know that God is in me I in you and you in me the Oneness of God with the bride amen with the with the church amen God bless you richly I know it's a little bit short because we have the the missions report but then yeah less is much when when we have all all these things together amen I hope you are encouraged and and uh let's uh let's Worship the Lord and praise him with uh with all all our might and uh let's sing I don't know what brother Joel has we can can I love Jesus I would rather help Jesus I would rather help Jesus brother I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold this stand I'd rather be his
