[22:08] lay everything at your feet tonight. Our
[22:11] thinking, our ambitions, our plans,
[22:13] Lord, we just lay them at your feet
[22:15] tonight. We have We've got one desire,
[22:17] Lord, and that's to worship you in
[22:19] spirit and in truth. Lord, we know our
[22:21] brothers labored, our pastors labored
[22:23] for the service tonight. [music] And
[22:25] Lord, we believe that he'll he'll speak
[22:27] the truth. We've seen that record, Lord,
[22:29] in his life. And Father, may we worship
[22:32] you in spirit and in truth. Lord, may
[22:35] the revelation of your word just be so
[22:37] strong and so anchored in our hearts,
[22:39] Father, that we could sing with with
[22:41] that revelation to you, Lord, that it
[22:43] wouldn't [music] be just lip service,
[22:44] but it would be from our hearts a
[22:46] worship to you tonight. You're so
[22:48] worthy, Lord, of more than we can bring
[22:50] you, Lord. You're worthy of our
[22:52] adoration, Lord. You're worthy of our
[22:53] praise. You're worthy of our
[22:55] thanksgiving, Lord. Where would we be
[22:57] without you tonight? And Lord, we've
[22:59] gathered tonight for one purpose. That's
[23:01] to receive from you. Lord, as we hear
[23:03] the word, we become the word. That seed

[23:43] Lord, here we are a non-vindicated
[23:46] individual. There was a vindicated

[23:54] apathy that that might just overwhelm us
[23:57] at times. Lord, we love you. We we we so

[24:05] against us. But Father, cleanse us Aresh
[24:08] under your precious blood, Lord, that
[24:10] that we'll that we'd lose all our guilty
[24:13] stains tonight. We love you so much,

[24:17] we can love you in return. receive our
[24:20] worship now we pray in the precious name
[24:22] of the Lord Jesus we ask these mercies.

[30:32] [singing]
[30:37] too many. [music]

[33:33] sure.
[33:36] Precious the morning do you [music] make
[33:41] your mercy new
[33:47] every [singing] morning. [music]
[33:52] What a song of reminder how great our
[33:55] God is. Let's sing the chorus first.
[33:58] Stand with [clears throat] me if you
[33:58] would. We'll call our pastor up after we
[34:01] sing this [music] song. What a day that
[34:03] will be
[34:05] &gt;&gt; when he takes us by the hand and gives
[34:07] us a tour of that promised land. Just
[34:12] eternity is hard to fathom. But there'll
[34:14] never be an end of our ability to give
[34:16] him praise, to give us give him worship,
[34:18] fellowship with one another, fellowship
[34:20] with him. It's a wonderful, wonderful
[34:22] promise. We'll sing it this way. Oh,
[34:25] [singing] what a day
[34:28] that will be
[34:31] when my Jesus [singing]
[34:34] I shall see
[34:36] when I look [music]
[34:38] upon his face that one save [singing]
[34:43] me by his grace
[34:46] and he takes [music]
[34:48] me by the hand and he leads me through
[34:53] and promise this [music] land.
[34:56] Oh, what a day, [singing]
[34:58] glorious day
[35:01] that will be. I don't think this song
[35:03] was written by Fanny Crosby, but I did a
[35:06] certain research to today. And she wrote
[35:09] somewhere between five and 8,000 hymns.
[35:11] She was just an incredible, incredible
[35:13] hymn singer, h himwriter, and she died
[35:15] in 1915. I thought, wow. In the 1800s,
[35:18] all the way through that that man age,
[35:20] she came up. But one thing that we heard
[35:22] just recently, I think from our pastor
[35:24] maybe was uh maybe that was somebody
[35:26] else that was saying about uh her
[35:28] blindness. How will you know? They were
[35:30] ridiculing her and wanting her to sell
[35:31] her her talent to the world. And she
[35:33] said, "No, I'd never do that." Well, how
[35:35] will you know him? As you heard the
[35:37] story, she said, "I'll know him by the
[35:39] nail prints in his hands." And those
[35:41] nail [music] prints he showed Thomas,
[35:43] remember? He showed Thomas that. So
[35:44] those nail prints will be with him. that
[35:47] that that spear in his side, that scar
[35:49] will be there all through eternity.
[35:52] Fanny Crosby knew her scripture and what
[35:54] a wonderful lady she was. [music] 5,000
[35:56] hymns in her lifetime. What a wonderful
[35:59] testimony. Prophet told that story many
[36:01] times. Here we are tonight singing a
[36:03] song perhaps not written by her, but it
[36:05] sounds like her, doesn't that? It's
[36:07] intimate. I'm going to take him by the
[36:09] hand. I'm going to take my savior by the
[36:10] hand. He'll take me by that nail scarred
[36:12] hand and lead me through that land.
[36:14] Think about it tonight. Well, there is
[36:17] coming
[36:18] [singing] a day
[36:20] when no heartaches
[36:24] shall come.
[36:26] No more clouds
[36:28] in the sky. There'll be no more tears
[36:33] to dim [music] your eyes. Oh, is peace
[36:38] forever more. [singing]
[36:40] All that
[36:43] golden sh [music]
[36:51] [music]
[36:58] will be [music]
[36:59] [singing]
[37:00] in my Jesus
[37:02] I shall see.
[37:05] When I [music] look upon his face
[37:09] and what he [singing] say
[37:12] by his [music] grace
[37:14] and he takes [singing]
[37:16] me by the hand and he leads me [music]
[37:20] through that promise.
[37:23] Oh, on the day a glorious [music] day
[37:29] and will be
[37:31] there'll be no [singing]
[37:34] sorrow there. There'll be no
[37:37] [music and singing] burdens
[37:39] to bear,
[37:41] no more sickness,
[37:44] no pain. There'll be no more
[37:51] [music] for
[37:54] [singing]
[37:56] the one [music]
[37:58] who died for me.
[38:01] [singing]
[38:04] [music]
[38:09] Heat.
[38:11] [music]
[38:22] Heat.
[38:26] [music]
[38:30] takes me by [music] the day and leads me
[38:35] through the promised land. [music]
[38:39] What a day,
[38:42] glorious day
[38:44] that will be.
[38:49] Amen. God bless you tonight. What a day
[38:53] that will be.

[40:25] needs in the hearts of your children.
[40:28] Father, we just want to ask, Lord, for
[40:31] the two requests from Brother Harvey,
[40:33] Lord, for the family, for brother Marty,
[40:37] Lord, the family mourning, the passing
[40:40] of this brother. We know that you saw
[40:43] fit to bring him home to your house,
[40:45] Lord. And
[40:46] &gt;&gt; we know that he's not mourning, but
[40:48] Father, when we leave this world,
[40:51] there's people that miss us, Lord. And
[40:54] &gt;&gt; there's holes that are left that can
[40:56] never be filled.
[40:58] And Father, we know that you said that
[41:01] you will comfort the brokenhearted.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask, Lord Jesus, that
[41:06] you would do that tonight in the name of
[41:07] Jesus.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; And Father, we just pray for Brother
[41:11] Glenn
[41:13] Short. Lord, we pray that you would just
[41:15] touch his legs according to his faith.
[41:17] Lord,
[41:18] &gt;&gt; thank you.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to stand with him
[41:21] united in faith tonight.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Now, Lord Jesus, as we turn to your
[41:25] word, we just ask that we could push
[41:27] aside all of the cares of this world.
[41:30] And Father, that we could just one more
[41:32] time, Lord Jesus, just recharge our
[41:36] souls
[41:37] &gt;&gt; by the encouragement of your word.
[41:40] Father, we just ask all these things now
[41:42] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. If you have your
[41:47] Bibles, thank you musicians. If you have
[41:50] your Bibles, I would like to read from
[41:52] Corinthians once again.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Corinthians chapter 12.
[42:07] Oh my.
[42:10] Corinthians 12:1
[42:13] it says, "Now concerning spiritual
[42:14] gifts, brethren, I would not have you
[42:17] ignorant.
[42:20] Ye know that ye were Gentiles carried
[42:22] away unto these dumb idols, even as ye
[42:25] were led.
[42:27] Wherefore I give you to understand that
[42:30] no man speaking by the spirit of God
[42:33] calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man
[42:37] can say that Jesus is the Lord but by
[42:40] the Holy Ghost.
[42:42] Now there are diversities of gifts but
[42:45] the same spirit. And there are
[42:48] differences of administrations but the
[42:51] same Lord.
[42:52] And there are diversities of operations
[42:56] but it is the same God which workketh
[42:59] all in all.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; But the manifestation of the spirit is
[43:03] given to every man to profit with all.
[43:08] For to one is given by the Spirit the
[43:11] word of wisdom,
[43:13] to another the word of knowledge by the
[43:16] same Spirit, to another faith by the
[43:20] same Spirit, to another the gifts of
[43:23] healing by the same Spirit, to another
[43:27] the working of miracles. to another
[43:30] prophecy, to another discerning of
[43:32] spirits, to another diverse kinds of
[43:35] tongues, to another the interpretation
[43:38] of tongues. But all these workketh that
[43:42] one and the self-same spirit, dividing
[43:45] to every man severally
[43:47] as he will, and we know that he is not
[43:51] the individual man, that he is God.
[43:57] For as the body is one and hath many
[43:59] members, and all the members of that one
[44:02] body being many, are one body, so also
[44:06] is Christ.
[44:08] For by one spirit are we all baptized
[44:11] into one body. Whether we be Jews or
[44:15] Gentiles, whether we be bond or free,
[44:19] and have been all made to drink into one
[44:22] spirit.
[44:24] For the body is not one member but many.
[44:30] Let's just turn over to the book of
[44:32] Hebrews
[44:34] chapter 11.
[44:38] We know this is a
[44:41] very very familiar scripture
[44:45] &gt;&gt; but I believe it speaks to where we want
[44:48] to get into tonight. I want to speak to
[44:52] verse nine.
[44:54] of 1 Corinthians chapter 12
[44:58] talking about faith.
[45:01] Hebrews 11 verse 1
[45:05] says, "Now faith is the substance
[45:09] of things hoped for,
[45:11] the evidence of things not seen."
[45:15] Let's just bow in prayer one more time.
[45:18] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank
[45:20] you for this word.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for your word, Lord, to
[45:24] know that Lord, there's nothing greater
[45:26] in this world. And we know that
[45:27] everything in this world will pass away
[45:29] except for your word. So help us, Lord
[45:32] Jesus, to just dress ourselves in your
[45:34] word.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; And Father, more than just dressing
[45:38] ourselves in your word. Help us to eat
[45:39] your word. Father, that we would become
[45:42] your word. Lord Jesus, we just want to
[45:44] commit the words that are spoken, the
[45:46] word that we've read into your hands
[45:48] now. and we pray that you would break it
[45:50] open to us fresh once again by
[45:52] revelation in Jesus Christ's name we
[45:55] pray. Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be
[45:58] seated.
[46:04] Certainly thankful to be back once again
[46:07] and uh getting into our discussion about
[46:10] the spiritual gifts. I think there's so
[46:13] [snorts] many different uh directions
[46:15] that we could go with this and I just
[46:17] felt led to talk about spiritual gifts
[46:19] and just see what the Lord would do with
[46:22] it for us and uh we're just getting into
[46:26] it. So I'm excited about it. Just wanted
[46:29] to remember uh a few announcements. We
[46:32] want to continue to pray for brother
[46:33] Simply who has uh gone to Belgium to
[46:37] visit his wife and to bring home his
[46:40] baby. And uh that's going to be a
[46:42] wonderful thing. He said he would be
[46:44] back in January. And I don't think we
[46:46] have brother Toby and his family here
[46:48] tonight, do we? They're not here. No,
[46:50] they haven't come. They are back in
[46:52] Calgary safely by the grace of God from
[46:54] Nigeria. And uh he said they may not be
[46:57] back tonight in service because of jet
[47:00] lag. And that's understandable
[47:02] completely. Uh they're probably taking
[47:04] their rest and welld deserved. And uh
[47:07] remember to pray for brother John O
[47:09] Jerabessesa. He'll be traveling back
[47:11] tomorrow from Nigeria as well. We
[47:14] certainly miss one another when we're
[47:16] away, don't we?
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Certainly uh happy happy that we can get
[47:20] back together again. Just wanted to
[47:23] remind everyone also that we have uh a
[47:25] busy busy weekend. This one coming up.
[47:27] We have brother Cadre Diggs here
[47:29] Saturday evening. Um at 6:00 p.m. we
[47:33] have the funeral for Sister Jermaine. Uh
[47:36] basically all day on Saturday. 10:00 is
[47:39] the funeral at the funeral home. And uh
[47:42] then we'll have the 1:00 burial. Then
[47:46] there's a 2:00 um reception as well on
[47:51] Saturday. So it's going to be a busy
[47:54] weekend here. And then we'll have the
[47:55] regular service on Sunday.
[47:58] And uh we have the uh boy, there's just
[48:02] so much to talk about. That's all I'm
[48:04] going to do for announcements.
[48:06] Um certainly excited to uh to get into
[48:10] our study tonight. We're speaking on
[48:12] gifts and uh you know, talking about the
[48:14] same spirit. And uh when we talk about
[48:18] this this scripture as we were reading
[48:19] it, you know, in verse 11 it says, "But
[48:22] all these workketh that one and the
[48:24] selfsame spirit dividing to every man
[48:27] severally as he will." We're talking not
[48:32] about some other spirit. We're not
[48:34] talking about some other personality.
[48:37] We're talking about the self-same
[48:40] spirit, which is what the word of God
[48:41] says. And that he that's mentioned there
[48:44] is the Lord Jesus Christ who is God. It
[48:49] is not a second or a third person
[48:52] &gt;&gt; in a holy trinity.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; It is one person.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Of a holy trinity. A holy trinity of
[49:01] three offices with the same person.
[49:05] There's no division of personalities.
[49:08] It doesn't work that way. And uh we know
[49:10] that that's one of the greatest tricks
[49:12] the devil has over the the the believing
[49:15] community, the church in general in the
[49:18] world is to believe that there's three
[49:20] distinct persons. And it's just amazing
[49:24] to think that we would we would be given
[49:26] ears to hear and and and a heart to
[49:28] receive it. Eyes to be able to read it
[49:29] and understand what a vindicated prophet
[49:31] would say that the English language
[49:33] doesn't even make sense to take one
[49:36] person and try and say that there's
[49:38] three different personalities in that
[49:39] person. You know, when that happens, um
[49:43] it's not one person, is it?
[49:45] &gt;&gt; It just doesn't even make sense in in
[49:47] the English language. But tonight, we're
[49:49] talking about the self-same spirit. Uh
[49:51] we have spoken a little bit about
[49:53] wisdom. We've spoken a little bit about
[49:55] knowledge and uh tonight I want to carry
[49:57] on with faith. I think it's it's really
[49:59] important one. It's it's vital in fact
[50:02] because without faith it's impossible to
[50:04] please God.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; So it's not even optional for us to have
[50:09] the level of faith that I think we need
[50:11] for the day in which we live because
[50:13] this is the age that's going to require
[50:16] the greatest faith out of every single
[50:18] age. Because brother Random said very
[50:21] clearly that this is the age where we
[50:23] need rapturing faith. This isn't the age
[50:25] where we can just believe in a man or
[50:27] the teachings of a man and hope that
[50:29] it's going to be okay. And you know,
[50:30] brothers and sisters, we could say that
[50:32] we believe in the teachings of William,
[50:34] Mary, and Brandom. But I'll say this, do
[50:36] you live them?
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Do we live them?
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Because if we can say that we believe in
[50:41] them, that's one thing. And that's
[50:43] wisdom and that's knowledge. We've got
[50:45] the knowledge of the teachings of
[50:47] William Mary and Brham and and maybe a
[50:49] little bit of wisdom to maybe live a
[50:51] little bit of a different life, a better
[50:52] life. But do we have the ability to let
[50:56] another life, his life live out through
[50:59] us? Not William, Mary, and Brandham's
[51:01] his being him in the scripture that we
[51:02] read about tonight out of verse 11 as he
[51:05] will the Lord Jesus Christ. It has to be
[51:09] him living this out in our lives. But
[51:12] faith is the substance of things hoped
[51:15] for. It's the evidence of things not
[51:17] seen. And I think it's so beautiful
[51:19] because as we look at one another
[51:21] tonight, the reason why we come here is
[51:23] because there's faith inside of us.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; We come here by faith, believing that
[51:29] there's something going to happen. That
[51:31] we're not going to leave this service
[51:32] the same way that we came. We believe by
[51:35] faith
[51:36] &gt;&gt; that we're going to see a body change
[51:38] one day. By faith, we understand that
[51:41] not not only the worlds were framed, but
[51:43] our lives were framed before the
[51:45] foundation of the world.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; By faith, we believe that we're saved
[51:50] through grace.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Not of works.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Because if it was of works, then we're
[51:55] probably lost because there's better
[51:58] people.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful? I was listening to
[52:01] the message today. Brother Bradom said
[52:02] it and it's just one of those things
[52:04] that just jumped out of the player to
[52:06] me. You know, the common people heard
[52:09] him gladly.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; So if we find ourselves in a position
[52:14] where we think we're exquisite,
[52:16] &gt;&gt; are we hearing him?
[52:18] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that not William Marryiam
[52:20] Brandom. The Bible says the common
[52:23] people heard him gladly.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Now some people might say, "Well, I'm
[52:27] refined individual and I can hear him
[52:29] gladly and God bless you if you can."
[52:31] But he didn't come to save the
[52:33] aristocrats, did he? He didn't come to
[52:36] to to do that. He came to save the
[52:38] common people. And and I just was
[52:40] thinking about it. I'm so thankful that
[52:42] I can say I'm one of them.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Aren't you tonight?
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to think
[52:47] &gt;&gt; that we're just one of them?
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Just because he chose us, not because of
[52:52] what we've done. This is to profit every
[52:55] single man with all.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; So, tonight talking about faith. I just
[52:59] want to try and encourage us. You can't
[53:01] explain it even though we're going to
[53:03] try to a little bit. You you can't you
[53:06] can't break it down into a scientific
[53:09] formula. You can't just give someone
[53:12] faith and and say, "Here, this is the
[53:14] faith that I have. You should have this
[53:17] faith, too." Right? When we do that, we
[53:19] actually wind up with a religion.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; It has to be our own experience. It has
[53:25] to be our own faith. And you know,
[53:26] unfortunately, this is the way that the
[53:28] Lord has created it. Our faith is
[53:31] created through trials. Yes,
[53:33] &gt;&gt; sir.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; The faith that we're talking about
[53:36] tonight isn't just faith to believe that
[53:38] we have a church that we can go to and
[53:41] we can pay our tithes to and we can get
[53:43] a tax receipt from and there's a benefit
[53:45] because we're a better people because we
[53:47] belong to a church. There are those
[53:49] benefits and and that's wonderful, isn't
[53:51] it? I mean, it is naturally speaking.
[53:53] That's wonderful. But is that all?
[53:57] &gt;&gt; No. Tonight we're talking about another
[54:00] level of faith.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; And we mentioned it last time about
[54:03] brother Brandham talking about in the
[54:04] very first recorded message. Faith is
[54:07] the substance. And and he talks right
[54:09] out of Hebrews chap 11, but he talks
[54:12] about that girl with a the the rupturing
[54:14] appendix and she has no chance to go and
[54:16] get operated on. There's nothing that
[54:18] can save her except for faith. And she
[54:21] says, "Oh yeah, I have faith." To the
[54:23] prophet. And he says, "Do you okay? Show
[54:25] me. Show me your faith. Move that chain
[54:28] hanging from the light." And she said,
[54:30] "No, no way. That's spiritualism. How
[54:32] could you ever do that? Nobody could
[54:34] ever do that." And he said, "Watch me."
[54:37] And he did it. Why did he do that? To
[54:41] show her that there was another level of
[54:43] faith. Mhm.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; And and I just think it's beautiful
[54:46] because we know that in the end she was
[54:49] able to receive her healing
[54:51] &gt;&gt; because she realized how terribly
[54:55] errored she was.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; And and that's the same for every single
[54:58] one of us. There comes a point in time
[55:00] where we have to realize, you know,
[55:02] maybe I've got it wrong. Just be it unto
[55:05] me according to thy word.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; And it's so beautiful because it's the
[55:08] word of an angel messenger.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; I cannot get away from that thought.
[55:12] It's an angel messenger. And this is
[55:14] what we're talking about here. This is
[55:15] the the message for our day. It's from
[55:17] an angel messenger. And many people
[55:19] might say, you know, that's crazy talk.
[55:21] And and that's where you go off the
[55:23] rails with what you believe. And I say,
[55:26] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[55:28] them. I'm going to keep on going all the
[55:30] way off the rails. [laughter]
[55:32] We heard about it on Sunday. David, he
[55:35] got so excited when the word of God was
[55:37] coming to his house. Finally, what did
[55:39] he do? He took off his shirt and he
[55:41] started dancing. And we know that
[55:43] brother Brandham talks about it that way
[55:44] and and his wife was mortified that he
[55:47] would behave such such such in such a
[55:51] terrible way.
[55:53] Act so outrageous to be dancing in front
[55:55] of everyone without his shirt on.
[55:59] And we know that David said, "Hey, if
[56:01] you like that, watch this." And he
[56:05] didn't care because the word came to
[56:07] him.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; It was coming to his house. And I think
[56:12] it's got to be that way. When we get to
[56:13] that place, brothers and sisters, I
[56:15] believe that we will see a new level of
[56:17] faith manifesting in our lives when we
[56:20] don't care about what's going on. We're
[56:22] not too fussed about having everything
[56:24] just exactly so. We just want to see the
[56:26] spirit of God move so bad. We're just
[56:28] going to tune everything else out and
[56:30] just allow him to come on the scene.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Watch out.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; You might wonder, where's Brother Barry
[56:36] going tonight? I I'm heading somewhere.
[56:38] But you know, faith is a gift. Faith
[56:41] isn't just something that we just have.
[56:43] If we have faith, it's a tremendous gift
[56:46] from God.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Even just a little bit of faith. And we
[56:50] know that Jesus when he was on earth, he
[56:52] said, "If you even just had faith the
[56:53] size of a grain of mustard seed, and we
[56:56] know that that's a very, very small
[56:58] seed. It looks like powder." When you
[57:00] look at mustard seed, they look like
[57:02] powder. But faith is a gift. And it's
[57:04] it's it's a gift from God. And and I
[57:07] just couldn't help while I was studying
[57:08] this, thinking about it, you know, there
[57:09] was a time where brother Brandham, he
[57:11] preached a message in 1962 called wisdom
[57:15] versus faith.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Wisdom versus faith. Sometimes we can
[57:21] get wisdom and knowledge about this
[57:24] message of the hour or the word of God.
[57:27] And what can happen is we can start to
[57:29] confuse that with faith. They're not the
[57:33] same thing. Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; We were talking about it this morning
[57:36] having a conversation. You know, fear
[57:38] and faith cannot coexist.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; They are emnity against one another.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; You cannot have fear and have faith at
[57:48] the same time. Now, that's not to say,
[57:50] brothers and sisters, that you can't
[57:52] have fear. We can have fear. And I'll
[57:55] tell you, I I I have that experience
[57:57] where we went out to Victoria that one
[57:59] time and I misqued a job and I knew that
[58:02] we had a $40,000 problem on our hands
[58:05] and I had to somehow figure that out.
[58:07] And you know what happened was I kept it
[58:09] to myself. I didn't talk about it. I
[58:11] didn't really deal with it the any way
[58:13] that I should. And what happened was is
[58:15] I took that with me. I took on a spirit
[58:19] of depression. I took on a spirit of
[58:21] great fear. I took on a spirit to the
[58:24] place where I felt so helplessly alone
[58:28] that I thought the world would be better
[58:30] off without me
[58:32] &gt;&gt; on vacation with my family.
[58:35] But what happened was fear began to grip
[58:37] me. And I allowed that fear to grip me
[58:40] more and more and more without
[58:42] realizing, wait a second, I should be
[58:45] having faith and say, you know what, if
[58:47] there's a problem like this, that means
[58:48] that there's a solution from God just
[58:50] waiting to happen. And you know, after
[58:53] we went through all of it, we finally
[58:55] prayed through and and got to the place
[58:57] where we came back. I I went and had a
[58:59] conversation with the homeowners and
[59:00] said, "Look, I made an error. I did
[59:03] this. I messed up."
[59:06] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Oh, really? Okay. Well,
[59:08] how much is it?" And I told them, they
[59:09] said, "Oh, well, we probably had to do
[59:10] that somewhere along the way anyway, so
[59:13] that's okay."
[59:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm like, "Are you serious?"
[59:19] Here I was thinking the world would be
[59:21] better off without me. Whose thoughts
[59:22] were those?
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Those weren't even my thoughts. That's
[59:26] &gt;&gt; right.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; But I was given over to fear instead of
[59:29] actually [clears throat] trying to go
[59:31] for faith.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; But you know, we can have wisdom. We can
[59:35] we can be wise
[59:37] &gt;&gt; in our own conceit
[59:39] &gt;&gt; and actually push faith away. I'm not
[59:42] going to get into that message tonight.
[59:43] Wisdom first is faith. But I might, but
[59:46] not tonight. Tonight I want to actually
[59:48] really get into Mark chapter 10 starting
[59:52] at verse 46. So if you want to just turn
[59:54] over to Mark chapter 10.
[1:00:01] This is uh this is something that I
[1:00:03] preached on a little while ago and I
[1:00:05] just thought my it just it just
[1:00:06] resounded. It just rang true.
[1:00:11] So tonight I'm going to preach out of
[1:00:12] this message talking about faith.
[1:00:17] Mark 10 verse 46.
[1:00:21] Jesus walking down the road here. And
[1:00:24] they came to Jericho.
[1:00:27] Do we have that right? Yeah. And they
[1:00:30] came to Jericho. And as he went out of
[1:00:32] Jericho with his disciples and a great
[1:00:36] number of people blind Barameus,
[1:00:40] the son of Timus sat by the highway side
[1:00:44] begging.
[1:00:46] And when he heard that it was Jesus of
[1:00:48] Nazareth, he began to cry out and say,
[1:00:51] "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
[1:00:56] me."
[1:00:58] And many charged him that he should hold
[1:01:01] his peace. But he cried the more a great
[1:01:04] deal, thou son of David, have mercy on
[1:01:07] me.
[1:01:08] And Jesus stood still. Now, Brother
[1:01:11] Brandham, I'm going to read some of
[1:01:12] these quotes here in this message. But
[1:01:13] brother Brandham, he says, I love that.
[1:01:15] Don't you?
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; I just love that, don't you? Jesus stood
[1:01:18] still at his voice,
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; at this man's voice. Jesus stood still
[1:01:25] and commanded him to be called. And they
[1:01:29] called the blind man, saying unto him,
[1:01:31] "Be of good comfort. Rise, he calleth
[1:01:34] thee." So it makes me wonder which ones
[1:01:36] were they that came back and called him.
[1:01:39] After they told him, "Shut up. This is
[1:01:42] the master. You're just a blind beggar.
[1:01:44] Go away. You're you're actually just
[1:01:46] getting in the way. You're making a mess
[1:01:47] of the situation, interrupting the
[1:01:50] church service, GETTING EXCITED, GETTING
[1:01:52] OUT OF ORDER. DON'T DO THAT.
[1:01:56] Suddenly they had to call him cuz he
[1:01:58] said, "Get that guy."
[1:02:01] And he casting away his garment rose and
[1:02:04] came to Jesus. And you know, I I hadn't
[1:02:06] really heard this in before and didn't
[1:02:08] really think about it until this
[1:02:10] message, but brother Bradom talks about
[1:02:11] it. There was something inside of this
[1:02:13] guy who was blind.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; The word of God says this for a reason.
[1:02:18] Brother Brandham just sort of glazes
[1:02:20] over it, but it really caught my
[1:02:21] attention. This guy who was blind
[1:02:24] begging in the way in the street, he
[1:02:26] just jumped up and cast away his
[1:02:28] garment. How was he going to find his
[1:02:31] garment?
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; How was he going to get that garment
[1:02:35] back?
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; But something was on the inside of the
[1:02:38] inside,
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; And he casting away his garment rose and
[1:02:44] came to Jesus. And Jesus answered and
[1:02:47] said unto him, "What wilt thou that I
[1:02:49] should do unto thee?"
[1:02:53] The blind man said unto him,"Lord, that
[1:02:55] I might receive my sight."
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto him, "Go thy way.
[1:03:02] Thy faith
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; hath made thee whole."
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; And immediately he received his sight
[1:03:09] and followed Jesus in the way.
[1:03:11] So tonight I want to take a look at this
[1:03:13] and I want to talk about this from this
[1:03:15] perspective. You know sometimes we got
[1:03:17] to cry out.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And and I would say not sometimes I
[1:03:22] would say every time.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; And I think the more we cry out the more
[1:03:28] we're going to see how much he's
[1:03:30] listening.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And you know crying out isn't
[1:03:34] necessarily crying out in lamenting and
[1:03:36] and and and in pain. Sometimes crying
[1:03:40] out is just in worship,
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; saying, "Thank you, Lord. I know you've
[1:03:45] got this under control."
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Some of the best ways to deal with
[1:03:49] problems is to actually praise them
[1:03:51] away.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Great.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Not cry about them and talk about them
[1:03:56] and lament about them, but to actually
[1:03:59] just start to WORSHIP THE LORD AND thank
[1:04:01] him for making provision for every
[1:04:03] single one of our needs.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:07] But this guy, blind Barnameus, he
[1:04:09] stopped Jesus in his tracks. Can you
[1:04:11] imagine that?
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; The Messiah walking down the road. You
[1:04:14] know, we talked about this before, how
[1:04:16] brother Brham, he just paints such a
[1:04:17] picture of this man. How he he was
[1:04:20] sitting there and the son just blind and
[1:04:23] begging and another day is going by. And
[1:04:25] he probably got helped out into his spot
[1:04:27] on the rock there from one of the rocks
[1:04:30] that was in the wall of Jericho when
[1:04:32] when Joshua was around. and and he
[1:04:35] probably heard all those stories from
[1:04:36] his mom and he was remember brother
[1:04:38] Brandham talks about this not in this
[1:04:40] message though the one I'm going to read
[1:04:41] from but he does he talks about it in
[1:04:43] another one that's called blind Barameus
[1:04:45] but he talks about how he has the
[1:04:47] memories of of feeling the sun and
[1:04:49] seeing the sun and seeing the grass on
[1:04:51] the hill and maybe seeing the springtime
[1:04:54] flowers and what it looks like in Judea
[1:04:56] at the time and here he is now he's
[1:04:59] blind and and just trying to get any
[1:05:01] little bit that he can as a beggar out
[1:05:03] of this life. But he remembers hearing
[1:05:06] his mama's voice and what it was like to
[1:05:09] come running back to his mama sitting on
[1:05:11] the porch and and just putting his head
[1:05:14] in her lap and and just having her tell
[1:05:16] him the stories about how there was
[1:05:19] there was Jericho and and the mighty
[1:05:22] warrior, the mighty conqueror Joshua and
[1:05:25] Caleb and how they they conquered this
[1:05:28] city and where he was. he was able to be
[1:05:31] sitting on the very rocks, the very
[1:05:33] stones that fell down from the
[1:05:35] leadership of this man and how much of a
[1:05:38] leader he must have been. And and and he
[1:05:40] talks about this guy in such a way that
[1:05:42] he he feels like if he could just have
[1:05:44] been there when Joshua was there talking
[1:05:46] to the captain of the Lord's house, he
[1:05:48] could have received his sight, but he
[1:05:52] wasn't there then. But it was such a
[1:05:55] wonderful time where God was moving. And
[1:05:57] then he goes on to talk about how he is
[1:05:59] sitting there thinking, you know, this
[1:06:01] is the very same road that Elijah walked
[1:06:04] with Elisha on.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And if he could only be there when the
[1:06:09] great prophets were walking down this
[1:06:11] road, maybe, just maybe, he could have
[1:06:13] received his sight there. And then,
[1:06:17] just tremendous way tells these stories.
[1:06:21] and and he he just says, "If I COULD
[1:06:23] HAVE JUST CRIED OUT, I MIGHT have
[1:06:25] received my sight
[1:06:28] as he's sitting there." And you know, we
[1:06:31] could say that brother Brandham just
[1:06:34] makes it theatrical and and and and
[1:06:36] probably does to some extent,
[1:06:39] but I kind of like to think that this is
[1:06:42] prophetic insight
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; where this man likely goes back into the
[1:06:47] mind of God and looks out through the
[1:06:49] eyes of God, looking down on the
[1:06:51] scenario and paints a picture like no
[1:06:53] one else could paint.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:58] if I could have just cried out then I
[1:07:00] might have received my sight. And and
[1:07:03] you know while he sat there thinking if
[1:07:05] only what happened that day he heard the
[1:07:10] commotion.
[1:07:11] He heard a commotion happening and he
[1:07:14] had probably heard that there was a
[1:07:16] healer in the land. He probably heard
[1:07:18] that some people were even saying that
[1:07:20] this was the Messiah. He'd probably
[1:07:22] heard the noise that was noised abroad
[1:07:25] about how all this commotion was taking
[1:07:27] place and and he probably even thought
[1:07:29] to himself there, me being a blind
[1:07:32] beggar, if only I could just get in
[1:07:34] front of that man, somehow
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; I could receive my sight, not realizing
[1:07:39] that that man was actually coming by his
[1:07:42] way.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; And it was no accident.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; We were talking about this a couple
[1:07:47] weeks ago. You know, there is no
[1:07:48] coincidences in this world. That's
[1:07:50] right.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; We talk about it that way. We talk about
[1:07:53] it being an accident or a coincidence.
[1:07:56] You know, when Jesus comes by our way,
[1:07:58] it's there's no coincidence. Brother
[1:07:59] Random says that you don't just stumble
[1:08:01] into the mission on the corner and get
[1:08:03] saved one day. No, no. That's that's the
[1:08:06] time appointed of the father where he
[1:08:08] comes and actually introduces himself
[1:08:11] personally to you as an individual. You
[1:08:15] have that experience.
[1:08:17] But here he is sitting there thinking,
[1:08:19] "If only, if only, if only." And he
[1:08:22] hears the commotion. And we know that
[1:08:24] something welled up inside this guy,
[1:08:26] didn't it? Something had to have welled
[1:08:28] up inside of him. And his faith began to
[1:08:31] grow. And as his faith began to grow, he
[1:08:34] just simply began to cry out. And you
[1:08:36] know, brothers and sisters, when we talk
[1:08:38] about faith in in the real life
[1:08:41] application in the church, in our lives,
[1:08:44] when we have something inside of us
[1:08:46] starting to grow and starting to want to
[1:08:49] cry out, I want to encourage you with
[1:08:51] all of my HEART TO LET IT OUT.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Don't hold it in.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Oh, I better not I better
[1:09:00] not get excited. I better not say
[1:09:02] anything about it. I I better not get
[1:09:04] too excited. Oh, if I do that, then
[1:09:07] something might happen. Someone might
[1:09:08] look at me. Who's looking at you?
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; If we came here into this building and
[1:09:13] we're worried about someone looking at
[1:09:15] us, we've come here for the wrong
[1:09:16] reason.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Because there's only one person that we
[1:09:20] want to have look at us, isn't it?
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; And we know that where two or three
[1:09:25] gather in his name that he's there.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; So, he's here.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; He's here tonight.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; What do you have need of? Amen. Amen.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; You know, we've seen some pretty
[1:09:37] fantastic things happen in this
[1:09:39] building.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Not because of the building, but because
[1:09:43] of the people in the building.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Because the character of the people is
[1:09:48] the beauty of the church.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this church is some
[1:09:53] beautiful.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; But this guy's faith began to grow
[1:09:58] because he heard the commotion. And what
[1:10:01] did he do? He wasn't interested in what
[1:10:03] anybody thought. He wasn't interested in
[1:10:05] what anybody had told him in that
[1:10:08] moment. He knew that he was going to cry
[1:10:11] out. And and it's funny because as he
[1:10:14] began to cry out,
[1:10:16] what happened? Verse 48 says, "Many
[1:10:19] charged him that he should hold his
[1:10:21] peace." Many charged him and told him
[1:10:23] that he should hold his peace. How would
[1:10:25] we be with a blind beggar on the side of
[1:10:27] the road holding a maybe a pot and a
[1:10:29] sign
[1:10:31] while we have a great church service
[1:10:33] going on? Will we be the same? Would we
[1:10:35] say, "No, no, no. Just hold your peace.
[1:10:36] Don't get too excited. Don't don't don't
[1:10:38] be saying, "I'm healed. I'm healed."
[1:10:40] Even though we know you're blind. Look
[1:10:42] at you, [laughter] you blind shoe
[1:10:44] cobbler. You're going up and down the
[1:10:46] aisles waving a hat on a cane saying,
[1:10:48] "I'm healed. I'm healed." Deacon, stop
[1:10:50] that man.
[1:10:52] No,
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; we're going to say amen.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Something about being blind.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; And being able to see,
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; even though naturally with our eyes we
[1:11:03] can't, but yet with our heart somehow we
[1:11:07] can. And somehow with our ears we can
[1:11:10] because if we give it an ear to hear.
[1:11:12] But many people charged him to hold his
[1:11:15] peace. Be quiet. Don't make a scene. But
[1:11:18] he cried the more a great deal. Can you
[1:11:22] imagine what that looked like? Telling
[1:11:25] him to be quiet. Don't yell. Now we have
[1:11:28] children and we try and console them
[1:11:30] sometimes. Maybe even in the church in
[1:11:32] the sanctuary, they'll start fussing and
[1:11:34] get fussy and maybe they want to do
[1:11:36] something and the parents don't want
[1:11:37] them to do that and they'll just throw a
[1:11:39] fit. And it happens. I've got three kids
[1:11:42] and sometimes it happened with us. It
[1:11:45] happens. But what happens is the child
[1:11:47] starts to get fussy and the more you try
[1:11:50] to console them and stop them, the more
[1:11:51] they fuss. There's only one thing left
[1:11:53] to do and that's to take them out of the
[1:11:56] sanctuary.
[1:11:58] But situations like that with a baby.
[1:12:01] Can you imagine a grown man
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; realizing that this could be my chance?
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; This could be my chance. The master is
[1:12:09] walking by. The Messiah is walking by.
[1:12:12] All that I've heard about is right here
[1:12:14] right now. and I can see it for myself
[1:12:17] and I'm not going to let anybody stop
[1:12:19] me.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; And you know that's what happens when we
[1:12:21] get that level of faith. This man had a
[1:12:24] body change because of the faith that
[1:12:26] welled UP INSIDE OF HIM. AND WHAT DID
[1:12:28] JESUS SAY? THY FAITH hath made thee
[1:12:31] whole.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; That's pretty tremendous,
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; So tonight I want to remind us we're not
[1:12:38] talking about our faith.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; We're talking about something else.
[1:12:43] We're going to get into that. We still
[1:12:44] got time. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Today I had a a little a little a little
[1:12:50] discussion with a guy and uh it was
[1:12:53] quite interesting. He's a painter and he
[1:12:55] he knew that I was going to go to
[1:12:56] service tonight and uh he said to me at
[1:12:59] at the sort of the end of the day, he
[1:13:00] said, "So so what are you going to do
[1:13:02] now?" And I said, "Well," and he said,
[1:13:04] "Are you going to go to church?" And I
[1:13:06] said, "Well, yeah." And he said, "Oh,
[1:13:09] you're a man of God." And I'm like,
[1:13:12] "Yeah,
[1:13:14] how'd you know that?" And he's like, "I
[1:13:16] know." And I'm like, "Oh, okay."
[1:13:21] And he said, "You know, I've I've I've
[1:13:23] been persecuted and I I just don't
[1:13:25] understand. I just don't understand."
[1:13:27] And I said, "Well, you don't have to
[1:13:28] understand. Why don't you come to
[1:13:30] church? Are you coming tonight?"
[1:13:33] And he said, "Are you inviting me?" And
[1:13:35] I said, "Of course I am.
[1:13:37] Come on."
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; You know what? And he said, "Oh, I'm I'm
[1:13:41] a Muslim. Would that be okay?" And I
[1:13:42] said, "Sure.
[1:13:44] Come on."
[1:13:46] And he said, "I've been persecuted." I
[1:13:48] said, "Really? Why were you persecuted?"
[1:13:50] And he said, "Because I wouldn't pray."
[1:13:53] And I'm like, "Really? Who persecuted
[1:13:55] you?" And he said, "My dad." I said,
[1:13:57] "Really?" And that was because his dad
[1:14:00] persecuted him. His dad's dad. His
[1:14:04] grandpa persecuted his dad. His dad
[1:14:06] persecuted him. So, I was interested in
[1:14:08] how he's calling it persecution.
[1:14:10] I don't know what it was. That's just
[1:14:12] the word that he used. But he said he he
[1:14:14] forced us to pray and and a lot and and
[1:14:18] he said, "It just didn't encourage me to
[1:14:21] this faith, but I still find myself a
[1:14:24] Muslim." And I said, "Well, you don't
[1:14:25] have to be."
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; But I thought it was interesting. I
[1:14:30] said, you know, I I actually make a
[1:14:32] point of not forcing anything. I said,
[1:14:36] "I've got children, and my greatest
[1:14:39] desire with my children is to actually
[1:14:41] get them to have their very own personal
[1:14:44] experience with Jesus Christ themselves.
[1:14:47] And that way, I don't have to persecute
[1:14:49] them to pray." And I think that's
[1:14:51] incredible because that's the last thing
[1:14:53] we want to do is persecute our children
[1:14:55] to pray.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; What kind of thing is that? What kind of
[1:14:58] God are you praying to?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:01] It's just so amazing to think that we
[1:15:03] don't we don't serve a God like that, do
[1:15:05] we?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; We serve a loving God.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; We serve a gentleman. He he doesn't
[1:15:10] force himself on anyone.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Doesn't persecute us to pray. But I just
[1:15:16] thought it was interesting. So if uh if
[1:15:18] you can think about it, just remember a
[1:15:20] fellow named Ally in prayer. I'm going
[1:15:24] to continue to express the Lord Jesus
[1:15:27] Christ to him.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We had a real good conversation
[1:15:29] and he was very respectful
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; and uh he said you can call me Eli
[1:15:34] because then you don't have to think of
[1:15:35] me as a Muslim and I said I don't know
[1:15:40] I don't know whatever it doesn't bother
[1:15:43] me. Um but yeah I'm just going to
[1:15:46] continue to speak to him and see what
[1:15:47] the Lord will do. Blessed be the name of
[1:15:50] the Lord.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; You know faith is the substance of
[1:15:53] things hoped for and it's the evidence
[1:15:55] of things not seen. Faith is not the
[1:15:58] same [snorts] as hope.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes in our lives, we can hope for
[1:16:03] things, but it's not faith.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; It's not actually the faith that's going
[1:16:07] to take us to the place we want to be.
[1:16:11] You know, out of 1954,
[1:16:15] I believe this is part of the quotes
[1:16:16] that I sent. Thy faith has saved thee.
[1:16:20] And brother Brandham is it's exactly out
[1:16:22] of Mark chapter 10, the story of blind
[1:16:25] Barameus. And this is where he says it
[1:16:28] and Jesus stood still. He says, "Oh, I
[1:16:30] love that his faith stopped Jesus in his
[1:16:35] track."
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? And tonight, I
[1:16:39] want to encourage us, brothers and
[1:16:40] sisters, as we talk about these quotes,
[1:16:42] as we talk about this faith. This isn't
[1:16:45] the faith of some other group somewhere
[1:16:48] else in in in history or in the future.
[1:16:51] This is the faith of the saints. The
[1:16:54] faith of the believers in the day in
[1:16:56] which we live. This is what I want to
[1:16:58] encourage us to to think about it. Not
[1:17:01] just blind Barnameus's faith, sons and
[1:17:04] daughters of God's faith.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Stop Jesus in his track.
[1:17:10] And when we talk about these reading
[1:17:12] these quotes, we could probably preach
[1:17:14] just on this one paragraph and Jesus
[1:17:18] stood still. Oh, I love that his faith
[1:17:20] stopped Jesus in his track. To think
[1:17:23] that this is just a man speaking or is
[1:17:27] it the Holy Ghost speaking directly
[1:17:30] through a man to a generation?
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; I think it's the latter.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus stood still.
[1:17:38] His faith stopped Jesus in his track.
[1:17:43] Tonight, I want to encourage us to stop
[1:17:46] Jesus in his track.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; We're not going to force Jesus to do
[1:17:50] anything. The only thing that we're
[1:17:53] going to do is humble ourselves unto
[1:17:55] him. And how do we do that? We do it by
[1:17:58] his word. But I think it's even further
[1:18:01] than that. How do we do it in the
[1:18:03] natural world in which we live in? We
[1:18:05] submit ourselves one to another
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; in the fear of God.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; And we know we talked about it a while
[1:18:13] back, but maybe we'll get into it again.
[1:18:15] Talking about roles, husbands and wives
[1:18:18] and and children before any of that. It
[1:18:21] says submitting yourselves therefore one
[1:18:23] to another. If we're not willing to do
[1:18:25] that, then we might as well forget about
[1:18:27] saying, "I'm the husband. Reverence me.
[1:18:32] And I'm the wife. You got to love me."
[1:18:34] If we're not interested in doing that,
[1:18:37] how could we possibly think that
[1:18:39] somebody else is going to follow in
[1:18:40] their the the the word of God? We've got
[1:18:43] to be willing to take the word of God
[1:18:45] for ourselves.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; And we'll demonstrate it by the way we
[1:18:49] live.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; But our faith has the ability to stop
[1:18:52] Jesus in his track. If he's the same
[1:18:55] yesterday, today, and forever, brothers
[1:18:56] and sisters, don't you think that we
[1:18:58] could stop him in his track if we have a
[1:19:01] need tonight? Faith is a person.
[1:19:06] Faith is a person. I want to say that a
[1:19:08] few times. Faith is a person. The person
[1:19:12] of Jesus Christ living out through our
[1:19:15] lives through his spirit. Not as a
[1:19:18] second person, not as a third person,
[1:19:20] the person.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Not even as the first person, the
[1:19:25] person. The person of Jesus Christ is
[1:19:29] faith.
[1:19:31] out of thy faith has saved thee. In 1954
[1:19:34] 0411,
[1:19:36] brother Brandham says that all that
[1:19:38] screaming going on.
[1:19:41] Jesus never noticed it. He walks
[1:19:43] steadily on towards Jerusalem.
[1:19:47] Just the way that he portrays these is
[1:19:49] just unreal. He walks steadily on
[1:19:52] towards Jerusalem knowing that that was
[1:19:55] his own children crying for his blood.
[1:20:01] Can you imagine that?
[1:20:04] Anybody here ever seen The Chosen?
[1:20:07] Have you seen The Chosen?
[1:20:09] [clears throat] If you see this depicted
[1:20:11] in that show, they show Jerusalem a
[1:20:16] buzz. Jerusalem has something going on
[1:20:19] that's never happened before. There is
[1:20:22] an element of anticipation that
[1:20:25] something really big is taking place.
[1:20:28] The way they portrayed in that show,
[1:20:30] it's pretty good, I have to say. But
[1:20:32] that actually speaks to this. Jesus
[1:20:35] never noticed all the all the noise. He
[1:20:37] just walked steadily on towards
[1:20:39] Jerusalem knowing that that was his own
[1:20:42] children crying for his blood.
[1:20:46] And he couldn't turn them down.
[1:20:50] Can you think how that could possibly
[1:20:52] be? How can a father turn his own
[1:20:56] children down? They were crying for his
[1:20:59] blood. They hadn't even said it yet. Let
[1:21:03] his blood be upon us and our children.
[1:21:05] When Pilate said, "Hey, what would you
[1:21:07] rather have? The murderer,
[1:21:10] Barabus,
[1:21:12] or Jesus the man?"
[1:21:15] And they said, "Give us the murderer." A
[1:21:18] and they said on top of that, "And let
[1:21:21] his blood be upon us." and our children.
[1:21:25] [clears throat]
[1:21:26] That one just about made me fall over
[1:21:28] when I was able to connect the dots when
[1:21:30] I started actually really reading the
[1:21:32] Bible and and getting revelation by the
[1:21:35] spirit about this word to recognize the
[1:21:37] persecution of the Jews throughout the
[1:21:39] ages is exactly that.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; It's exactly that. Let his blood be upon
[1:21:45] us and our children throughout all the
[1:21:48] generations, but it ain't going to be
[1:21:49] long before that blood isn't going to be
[1:21:51] there anymore.
[1:21:53] It's not going to be on them. They're
[1:21:54] going to RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S ON CHRIST.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; They'll recognize the same blood that we
[1:22:00] recognize.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; But he walks steadily on towards
[1:22:04] Jerusalem. How many of us would walk
[1:22:06] steadily on towards our crucifixion? My
[1:22:09] knowing that was his own children crying
[1:22:11] for his blood and they could he couldn't
[1:22:14] turn them down. How could a father turn
[1:22:16] his own children down? And here he walks
[1:22:18] onto Jerusalem. But this poor old blind
[1:22:22] beggar,
[1:22:23] this poor old blind beggar standing way
[1:22:26] back. People tried to stop him from
[1:22:29] crying.
[1:22:31] I believe good people with good
[1:22:33] intentions.
[1:22:35] And you know, isn't that the way it is
[1:22:36] in the church? Good people with good
[1:22:39] intentions sometimes can cause severe
[1:22:44] problems,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Really deep hurt.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. in a moment.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Good people with good intentions.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Meaning, well,
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; causing major problems.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Good people with good intentions. No,
[1:23:02] no, no. Don't get too excited. Just be
[1:23:03] quiet. You're just a blind beggar. This
[1:23:06] is the Messiah here. And I mean, I
[1:23:09] probably would feel the same way.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; I honestly would probably feel the same
[1:23:13] way. THIS THIS IS MESSIAH. GET OUT OF
[1:23:15] THE WAY. Make room for the king. It's
[1:23:18] the King of Kings.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Good people with good intentions.
[1:23:25] But said, "Set down. Don't make so much
[1:23:28] noise. Why the days of miracles has
[1:23:31] passed?"
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; If we ever hear that, that's a lying
[1:23:37] spirit.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; That's a lying spirit.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; The days of miracles has passed.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; My
[1:23:45] good people with good intentions
[1:23:48] You know, our priest tells us that.
[1:23:53] And do you want to be considered with a
[1:23:55] bunch of fanatics?
[1:23:57] Sit down.
[1:23:59] And you know, sometimes this can apply
[1:24:03] because we can have former teachings and
[1:24:05] we can say, "Well, that supersedes
[1:24:08] this."
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; And and I say that's good if it does. If
[1:24:13] if anything supersedes, let it be this.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; If it's man, this
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; But if it's this, I think it's important
[1:24:24] to make sure that it's not man.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; It has to be the word of God, brothers
[1:24:29] and sisters.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; But we can actually have something in
[1:24:33] our lives where we say, you know, our
[1:24:35] our priest, our former pastor, he tells
[1:24:38] us that this is the way we ought to do
[1:24:40] it. And and and where does that come
[1:24:42] from? If it's in the word of God, great.
[1:24:45] Let's do it. But if it's not in the word
[1:24:46] of God, hold on a second. Let's pump the
[1:24:49] brakes. Let's make sure
[1:24:51] the days of miracles aren't passed. We
[1:24:55] know that. You know, our priests tell us
[1:24:57] that. And and do you want to be
[1:24:59] considered with a bunch of fanatics?
[1:25:01] Yep. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[1:25:04] of them. As long as it's with the word
[1:25:07] of God. It's got to be with the word of
[1:25:09] God.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; We can hear them saying, "Sit down." And
[1:25:13] and what did this man do? He turned a
[1:25:15] deaf ear to them.
[1:25:18] He didn't even argue with them, did he?
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Why not?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus was passing by.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; And I think that's really important for
[1:25:27] us to to to just consider if we haven't
[1:25:31] ever, you know, the time and space that
[1:25:33] we're living in. We can spend our time
[1:25:36] being critical and and considering
[1:25:38] things, examining things, and having a
[1:25:41] whole bunch of examination and and
[1:25:43] missing out on what's actually taking
[1:25:45] place because of all of our criticism
[1:25:47] and our our thinking and and maybe it
[1:25:49] should be this way and it's not this
[1:25:51] way, it should be that way and it's not
[1:25:52] that way. Maybe we could be missing
[1:25:56] what's actually taking place right now.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; And we know that brother Brandham says
[1:26:00] it many, many times in the message of
[1:26:02] the hour. TALK ABOUT WHAT HE'S done in
[1:26:03] the past and we talk about what he's
[1:26:05] going to do in the future, but we ignore
[1:26:07] what's taking place right now.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; And let's not put it off, brothers and
[1:26:14] sisters. Let's not take it and put it
[1:26:15] off and say, "Well, we're not looking
[1:26:17] back at what Brother Brandham did and
[1:26:19] saying that was all tremendous."
[1:26:22] And we're going to look forwards to what
[1:26:23] God's going to do in the future. We're
[1:26:25] going to see a body change. What about
[1:26:27] in our very own lives? Let's not get
[1:26:29] hung up 40 years ago thinking that
[1:26:32] things were great 40 years ago. And my
[1:26:34] goodness, it's going to be so tremendous
[1:26:36] when we get a new body. What about right
[1:26:38] now, tonight? What's the Lord doing
[1:26:40] tonight here in THIS BUILDING, A CALVARY
[1:26:42] LIVING WORD ASSEMBLY? NOT the assembly
[1:26:45] of of the people, with the charitable
[1:26:47] organization, but with the assembly of
[1:26:49] the spirit of Jesus Christ in our lives.
[1:26:52] What is he doing in our lives right now?
[1:26:57] Are we a bunch of fanatics? Are we more
[1:26:59] concerned about just telling people to
[1:27:01] sit down and don't get out of order?
[1:27:03] Don't don't get too excited. I want to
[1:27:06] say get excited. I want to say get out
[1:27:08] of order.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Let the spirit of the Lord move in our
[1:27:11] midst.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; This guy, he turned a deaf ear to them.
[1:27:15] He said, "Thou son of David, have mercy
[1:27:18] on me. My only hope is leaving me. If I
[1:27:23] don't cry out right now,
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; I might not get another chance.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters, when we gather
[1:27:30] together this way,
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; can you guarantee there's another
[1:27:34] chance?
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; We've got our schedules booked. We've
[1:27:38] got our time frames figured out. Our
[1:27:41] lives are are secured in terms of
[1:27:44] planning, but there's no guarantees
[1:27:46] we're going to have another opportunity
[1:27:47] to worship God the way that he's
[1:27:49] provided for us. Amen.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; There's no guarantee when we're sitting
[1:27:53] in the in the in the street as it were
[1:27:58] on on the stones that were knocked down
[1:28:01] by the spirit of the Lord. There's no
[1:28:03] guarantee that we're going to have the
[1:28:04] opportunity to cry out to the Messiah as
[1:28:07] he passes by again.
[1:28:11] But he turned a deaf ear to them. He
[1:28:12] said, "Thou son of David, have mercy on
[1:28:16] me. I don't have time to argue with you
[1:28:18] about whether I should be quiet or
[1:28:20] whether I should shout. He's going. I
[1:28:23] can hear. He's going. I'm not gonna miss
[1:28:25] him. I'm not going to let anybody or
[1:28:28] anything stand between me. And we know,
[1:28:30] brother Brandham said it in the church
[1:28:31] age book. Remember this. Never let
[1:28:35] anyone or anything get between you and
[1:28:39] this word
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; because as soon as something like that
[1:28:43] does, guess what? He's going to keep
[1:28:46] going. He's not gonna stop.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; We've got to have the faith to stop him
[1:28:52] in his tracks.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Turn a deaf ear. I want to say that
[1:28:58] tonight. Turn a deaf ear.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Turn a deaf ear to the devil. Turn a
[1:29:02] deaf ear to critics.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Turn a deaf ear to all of our our our
[1:29:07] inhibitions. Turn a deaf ear to
[1:29:09] ourselves and say, "Be it unto me
[1:29:11] according TO THY WORD. LET THAT LIFE
[1:29:13] COME TO TO BIRTH INSIDE of me in a way
[1:29:16] like maybe it never has.
[1:29:19] [clears throat] Because you know why we
[1:29:20] keep talking like this, brothers and
[1:29:21] sisters? We keep talking like this
[1:29:23] because and I'm I'm preaching to me now.
[1:29:25] I'm preaching to brother Barry. If if
[1:29:27] that screen was here, the glass, I'd be
[1:29:29] looking in the mirror. But I'll tell you
[1:29:30] what, I'm talking to me tonight. We're
[1:29:32] not going to suddenly have a body change
[1:29:35] and a character change.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; The promise is for a body change. The
[1:29:41] character change happens right now. This
[1:29:43] is the rubber meeting the road is us
[1:29:46] changing our characters and not us
[1:29:48] changing our characters but him CHANGING
[1:29:51] OUR CHARACTERS, US HUMBLING OURSELVES TO
[1:29:54] THE WORD OF GOD. And the more that I
[1:29:56] surrender, the more he takes control.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; It's not the more he takes control, THE
[1:30:03] MORE I SURRENDER.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; We surrender first.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He takes control. Second,
[1:30:12] you know, we heard it on Sunday. Submit
[1:30:14] yourselves therefore unto God. Resist
[1:30:19] the devil and he will flee.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget it. Brother Aaron
[1:30:24] Mciri preached a notable message about
[1:30:27] that. He said, you know, many times
[1:30:29] people say it, resist the devil and he
[1:30:31] will flee. And amen, he will. That's the
[1:30:33] word of God. But don't forget that first
[1:30:35] part. It's like putting a key into an
[1:30:38] ignition. You can turn the ignition all
[1:30:40] you want without the key and it's not
[1:30:42] going to do nothing.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Submit yourself therefore unto God.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Then you can resist the devil.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; But if we're in a position where we're
[1:30:53] just not submitting ourselves unto God,
[1:30:56] we can resist the devil all we want and
[1:30:58] he knows that we're bluffing.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; We're not going to fool the devil and
[1:31:02] we're not going to fool God. And and you
[1:31:04] know, sadly, I think that we're not
[1:31:06] really going to fool ourselves, but we
[1:31:08] can for a while. We can fool ourselves,
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; but we need to start turning a deaf ear
[1:31:13] to the devil. Turn a deaf ear to the
[1:31:14] critics. Turn a deaf ear to all of the
[1:31:17] negative in our lives. All of the
[1:31:20] negative in our lives. Turn a deaf ear
[1:31:23] to it. Go like this. La.
[1:31:27] Don't listen to it.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Negative is going to take you down.
[1:31:31] Negative is the devil.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; I'll say that again tonight. Negative is
[1:31:37] the devil.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; If we're always dwelling in a negative
[1:31:41] realm, we're giving PLACE TO THE DEVIL.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; TELL HIM TO SHUT [screaming] UP.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Tell him to beat it.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Show him surrender
[1:31:54] on your knees.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Show him surrender on your knees. Show
[1:31:58] him that you worship God. And that's why
[1:32:01] we come to church is to show THE DEVIL
[1:32:03] WHOSE SIDE we're on.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Not just to do that though, but to
[1:32:06] actually feed on the word. But turn a
[1:32:09] deaf ear to the devil. This guy, he
[1:32:11] said, "Thou son of David, have mercy on
[1:32:13] me. My only hope IS LEAVING ME. I'M NOT
[1:32:16] GOING TO LET IT GO. OH GOD, be merciful
[1:32:19] to me. A blind man."
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; And something touched the master.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; I just think it's so relevant to us.
[1:32:30] Amen.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; We have got to be willing to be this
[1:32:32] outrageous, this outlandish in our
[1:32:34] lives,
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; this outspoken in our lives. OH, THOU
[1:32:39] SON OF DAVID, HAVE MERCY NOT ON EVERYONE
[1:32:42] ELSE. HAVE MERCY ON ME.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; LET IT BE ABOUT ME.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. AMEN.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE, you know, we hear it said many
[1:32:50] times, how can we ever give out if we
[1:32:53] don't take in?
[1:32:55] How are we ever going to have any faith
[1:32:57] to show other people if we don't have
[1:32:59] faith on our own? And I'm not talking
[1:33:01] about just working it up. And don't get
[1:33:03] me wrong, I'm talking about letting him,
[1:33:06] the person of Jesus Christ, you know,
[1:33:09] the repentance for our sins, baptism in
[1:33:12] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:33:14] the remission of our sins, and then
[1:33:17] baptism in water, baptism of the Holy
[1:33:20] Ghost, but then not just staying there.
[1:33:23] Many people have done that. 40 years ago
[1:33:26] I got baptized. Sure. In the name of the
[1:33:28] Lord Jesus Christ, but still living a
[1:33:31] life that's a little bit contrary, a
[1:33:33] little bit edgy, a little bit crusty, a
[1:33:35] little bit prickly. Something's wrong.
[1:33:37] There's not just exactly the spirit of
[1:33:39] Christ in there. There's someone else
[1:33:40] living in there. Two people are not
[1:33:42] going to live in the same house. Christ
[1:33:44] is sovereign. He's only going to live
[1:33:46] alone.
[1:33:49] But we can come to a place where we've
[1:33:51] got to give away to the spirit of Jesus
[1:33:54] Christ. The person of Jesus Christ. The
[1:33:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost gives way to
[1:33:59] the person of Jesus Christ. That's
[1:34:00] actually a quote. We're not going to go
[1:34:02] too far into that tonight. But I want to
[1:34:04] encourage us to turn a deaf ear to all
[1:34:06] of the negative in our lives. He said,
[1:34:08] "Thou son of David, have mercy on me." I
[1:34:10] want to say tonight, we should be saying
[1:34:11] these words, "Thou son of David, have
[1:34:13] mercy on me. Thou son of God, have mercy
[1:34:16] on me. Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on
[1:34:18] me. Stop him in his tracks, brothers and
[1:34:21] sisters. See if he won't stop and
[1:34:24] listen. My only hope is leaving me. Oh
[1:34:27] God, be merciful to me, a blind man.
[1:34:31] And something touched the master. And
[1:34:33] the faith of that blind, ragged beggar
[1:34:37] stopped Jesus Christ in his tracks.
[1:34:42] Now, I ain't just making this up. This
[1:34:44] is what the prophet says. It'll do the
[1:34:47] same thing tonight.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; It'll do the same thing tonight.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Anybody here have a need?
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Anybody here have a situation that we
[1:34:57] have to contend with that we just don't
[1:34:59] know what to do?
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Stop him in his tracks.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; See if he's not God.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Say, "I'M NOT INTERESTED IN LOOKING
[1:35:08] FORWARDS. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN LOOKING
[1:35:10] BACKWARDS. I'M ONLY INTERESTED IN
[1:35:12] LOOKING FORWARDS TO YOU. RIGHT AT YOU.
[1:35:18] Something touched the master and the
[1:35:20] faith of that blind ragged beggar. You
[1:35:22] know, every single one of us outside of
[1:35:24] Christ in our lives, that's our
[1:35:25] description.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Common people,
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; just common folks, right? Ragged, blind
[1:35:34] beggars. Now, how could we possibly be
[1:35:36] that? We know the word of God says that
[1:35:37] the Leoysian people, what are they?
[1:35:39] They're naked. They're blind
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; and they don't even know it. They think
[1:35:45] that, oh, I'm so perfectly clothed. Look
[1:35:48] at me.
[1:35:51] Yeah, that's not where we want to be. We
[1:35:53] want to be trusting the Lord with all of
[1:35:55] our hearts. He stopped, looked around,
[1:35:59] and said, "Bring him here." Can you
[1:36:01] imagine that tonight for us to call on
[1:36:05] the master while he walks by one more
[1:36:08] time through this congregation up and
[1:36:10] down the aisles? Don't think that he's
[1:36:12] not here, brothers and sisters. He's
[1:36:13] here. The same one that we're talking
[1:36:15] about in this story is in this building
[1:36:17] right now. He's here right now.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Call on him and see. I saw many, many
[1:36:24] hands go up when I asked that question
[1:36:26] tonight. I SHOULD HAVE PUT MY HAND UP.
[1:36:28] BUT TO THINK ABOUT IT, THE SAME EXACT
[1:36:30] PERSON THAT WAS WALKING on that street
[1:36:32] is in this building tonight.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; He stopped and looked around and said,
[1:36:38] "Bring them here." Can you imagine
[1:36:41] having the master, the king of kings and
[1:36:44] lord of lords, Jesus Christ himself say,
[1:36:47] "Stop everything and bring that man to
[1:36:50] me. Bring that sister to me." She has
[1:36:53] called my name. She has a faith inside
[1:36:56] of her that's going to change the course
[1:36:59] of this action right now.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Because she touched my heart.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Some of them said, "Be of a good cheer.
[1:37:08] He calleth thee. Can you imagine? Isn't
[1:37:11] it wonderful when we see someone get the
[1:37:13] victory?
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't it?
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Suddenly we change from being those ones
[1:37:18] saying, "Shh, stop. Don't get too
[1:37:19] excited." We can see them getting a
[1:37:21] victory and and all of a sudden NOW IT'S
[1:37:23] LIKE, "WOW, THIS IS TREMENDOUS."
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; NOW, I'll say this. I'm going to use it
[1:37:28] for an example, and I trust that it will
[1:37:30] be okay. But you know, sitting right
[1:37:31] over here, right about where where
[1:37:33] brother and sister Paul and Elaine and
[1:37:35] and brother Elias and Sister Shellyley,
[1:37:38] Sister Rebecca Hildebrandt was sitting
[1:37:40] right there during a song service one
[1:37:42] night. And you could imagine that THERE
[1:37:44] WAS PROBABLY SOME PEOPLE, maybe even
[1:37:46] devils, trying to tell her, "Shh, don't
[1:37:48] don't get too excited. Don't do anything
[1:37:50] too excited." BUT RIGHT THERE IN A SONG
[1:37:52] SERVICE, SOMETHING SAID, "STAND UP AND
[1:37:54] RECEIVE YOUR HEALING FOR THE breast
[1:37:56] cancer."
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; And what'd SHE DO? I WITNESSED IT WITH
[1:37:59] MY EYES. I WATCHED HER STAND UP AND
[1:38:01] START TO worship
[1:38:04] and she was healed.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; But there was probably critics,
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; And you know, I'll say this, maybe to
[1:38:14] some extent I was one of them.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe.
[1:38:18] But I'll tell you this. I saw her stand
[1:38:20] up and guess what? I did too.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; I SAID, "AMEN. LET'S WORSHIP GOD. THAT'S
[1:38:26] WHY WE'RE HERE."
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:30] Some of them, some of the ones that
[1:38:32] might have said, "Sh, don't get too
[1:38:34] excited. It's the master. We're having
[1:38:36] church. Don't don't don't get out of
[1:38:38] order."
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't get too excited. You
[1:38:41] know, things have to be a certain way,
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; do they?
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; I want to say that tonight. Do they?
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; God is a God of order. But what does he
[1:38:52] want more than anything, brothers and
[1:38:53] sisters? He wants our heart.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; He wants a genuine heart. And when we're
[1:38:59] in the midst of worship,
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; just let it fly.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; When we're dealing with gifts, we're not
[1:39:06] going to go out of order.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; We will not go out of order if we have
[1:39:11] his spirit inside of us.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; It's impossible.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; He will never be contrary to his word.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; But talking about this story here, he
[1:39:22] says, "Some of them be of a good cheer.
[1:39:24] He calleth thee." Maybe some of the
[1:39:26] naysayers, they saw something was
[1:39:28] happening. The master stopped and said,
[1:39:30] "Get him. I want to talk to that guy
[1:39:33] right there. The one that was just being
[1:39:35] sh,
[1:39:38] oh, look at faith. Go to work." Now, he
[1:39:40] says,
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; "And that's the way it is." If you ever
[1:39:44] listen to the messages and you listen to
[1:39:47] the very end in in 63 and 64
[1:39:53] 60 61 62 59 58
[1:39:58] all of the message if you ever listen
[1:40:00] through all the way brother Brandham
[1:40:02] he'll do some discernments and he'll
[1:40:04] talk and then suddenly something happens
[1:40:07] you can hear a shift in the service at
[1:40:11] the end of the service.
[1:40:14] What is it? It's the Holy Ghost falling.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost falling on the
[1:40:20] service, on the congregation, going from
[1:40:23] the man in the front to the people in
[1:40:26] the group. It's a tremendous thing. And
[1:40:29] you know, some people start screaming.
[1:40:30] They can't control themselves. Sisters
[1:40:32] just start screaming at THE TOP OF THEIR
[1:40:34] LUNGS. WHAT WOULD THAT HAPPEN IN OUR
[1:40:37] MIDST tonight if that started happening?
[1:40:41] might get uncomfortable, but you know
[1:40:43] what, brothers and sisters, that might
[1:40:44] be healthy for us.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; When the spirit of God really falls on
[1:40:50] someone, we don't act like ourselves
[1:40:51] because we're not.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; How could we act like ourselves
[1:40:56] under the influence of the spirit of
[1:40:58] God?
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; But some of these people, they said, "Be
[1:41:01] of good cheer. He calleth thee." He
[1:41:03] says, "Look at faith. Go to work." Now,
[1:41:05] it was starting to spread. People were
[1:41:07] starting to get excited. something was
[1:41:09] taking place.
[1:41:11] Look at Faith. Go to work now. He says,
[1:41:13] "Faith leaps up, grabs his ragged coat,
[1:41:17] and throws it sideways. Not laying,
[1:41:21] not placing it down right here, and then
[1:41:23] feeling his way along so he can remember
[1:41:25] what it feels like, where his coat is."
[1:41:27] No, just taking it off and throwing it.
[1:41:29] SOMETHING ROSE UP INSIDE of this guy.
[1:41:31] Notice where he lays it nice so he could
[1:41:34] pick it up or find it when he was
[1:41:36] feeling his way around the wall. He had
[1:41:38] an audience with Jesus. He just threw
[1:41:40] it.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; He knew he would get what he wanted as
[1:41:45] long as he could have an audience with
[1:41:47] Jesus.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Going to jump to the punchline tonight,
[1:41:50] brothers and sisters, right now. Right
[1:41:51] now, this moment, you've got an audience
[1:41:53] with Jesus.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; We have an audience with Jesus.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "And brother, sister, tonight,
[1:42:00] let's have an audience WITH JESUS
[1:42:02] TONIGHT. ASK, HE SAID, AND YE shall
[1:42:05] receive."
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:08] But many times we ask to consume it on
[1:42:11] our lusts in our lives. We don't ask
[1:42:14] correctly and then we wonder why. And
[1:42:16] sometimes we ask for things that we're
[1:42:19] just not going to receive. And we have
[1:42:21] to be able to say
[1:42:23] amen.
[1:42:25] You know, we've read it in the message.
[1:42:26] Brother Brandham says that's that's one
[1:42:28] of the marks of a true Christian.
[1:42:30] Someone who can actually say,
[1:42:33] "I don't understand it. You haven't
[1:42:35] answered my prayer the way that I've
[1:42:36] asked it, but I love you anyway.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; That is powerful. That's right.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "Brother, sister, tonight,
[1:42:45] let's just have an audience with Jesus
[1:42:47] tonight." Ask, he said, "And you shall
[1:42:49] receive." What you ask the father in my
[1:42:52] name, that I'll do. Let's ask an
[1:42:55] audience with him tonight.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, we got just a few
[1:43:00] minutes left. He he didn't say,
[1:43:02] "Bardemus, are you a Pharisee or a
[1:43:04] Sadducee or a publican?" And you know
[1:43:06] where brother Barry would go with this.
[1:43:08] What what message do you go to? What
[1:43:11] who's your pastor?
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; What is it that you believe? He didn't
[1:43:15] go to him and say that. And he's not
[1:43:16] going TO DO THAT TONIGHT.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; He's going to say, "Do you believe the
[1:43:20] word?"
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Because if you believe the word, then
[1:43:23] you will actually call on him the way
[1:43:25] that he wants to be called and you will
[1:43:27] stop him in his tracks. But he doesn't
[1:43:29] say Bararddameus are you a Pharisee or a
[1:43:32] Sadducee or a publican or what are you
[1:43:34] Bararddameus? That didn't matter nothing
[1:43:37] to Jesus.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; A man in need had faith enough to stop
[1:43:43] him.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And you know that's why brothers and
[1:43:46] sisters in the age in which we live in
[1:43:47] if we wonder why we have trials. It's
[1:43:49] exactly why. Because he wants to shake
[1:43:52] us out of the people that we are. He
[1:43:56] wants us to recognize the only way that
[1:43:58] we're going to have the faith that we
[1:43:59] need to change our bodies is to actually
[1:44:03] go through the fiery trials of
[1:44:05] affliction because it's building that
[1:44:07] character. It's molding that gold that
[1:44:10] can only be bought from him. He says it
[1:44:13] in the Leodysian church age. I counsel
[1:44:14] thee to buy of me gold tried in the
[1:44:17] fire. And we know we learned about that.
[1:44:19] That's the character of God himself.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:25] Faith and fear cannot coexist. And you
[1:44:27] can tell in this message that they
[1:44:29] didn't in this man in blind Barnameus.
[1:44:33] Fear did not actually exist in that man.
[1:44:38] Brother Brandham goes on to say, I'll
[1:44:39] call the musicians as we close. If I
[1:44:41] don't call them, then I'll just want to
[1:44:43] keep preaching. I feel like I just want
[1:44:44] to start preaching now. He goes on to
[1:44:46] say, now he didn't say the days of
[1:44:48] miracles has passed. Jesus didn't. He
[1:44:51] didn't try to. Barnameus wasn't asking
[1:44:53] Lord that I might. I'm blind. I'm a
[1:44:57] blind man. I've been told the days of
[1:45:00] miracles is passed. But if I'm told I'm
[1:45:04] a believer in God that I'll go to heaven
[1:45:06] someday. Oh, good master, tell me what
[1:45:09] heaven looks like, will I receive my
[1:45:11] sight when I get to heaven?
[1:45:15] I love the way he says this because this
[1:45:17] points out, it underscores the fact that
[1:45:19] we're not going to have a new character
[1:45:20] when we get there. Let's not talk about
[1:45:22] what our character will be like when we
[1:45:24] get there. It's going to be a perfect
[1:45:26] character. We're going to have a perfect
[1:45:28] character here.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; And the perfect character, the
[1:45:31] perfection that we're talking about
[1:45:33] isn't character that's maybe perfect
[1:45:36] heavenly character that you might hear
[1:45:38] maybe have the the idea of a angelic
[1:45:41] character. We're humans and we're going
[1:45:44] to suffer as humans until our bodies do
[1:45:46] change. But when we're talking about
[1:45:48] with perfect character, perfect
[1:45:50] character, perfection is mature
[1:45:53] character.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Complete character.
[1:45:58] Ability to say, "Beat it, Satan. I can
[1:46:01] call you out every single time you come
[1:46:03] around me." Brother Brandham says that
[1:46:05] we'll be able to be that way in the in
[1:46:07] the series adoption where the devil just
[1:46:09] won't want nothing to do with you
[1:46:11] because you can see him coming a mile
[1:46:13] away.
[1:46:14] He says, "Oh, good master, tell me what
[1:46:16] heaven looks like. Will I receive my
[1:46:18] sight when I get to heaven? Is this
[1:46:19] God's blessings for me to be blind as
[1:46:22] I've been told?" Sometimes we can look
[1:46:24] at our problems in life and say, "Is
[1:46:26] this is God's blessing for my Maybe I'm
[1:46:28] supposed to do this. This is part of my
[1:46:29] character molding. Maybe it's the
[1:46:31] devil." and God is waiting to see if
[1:46:34] we're going to have the faith that will
[1:46:35] actually move the situation.
[1:46:38] He said that wasn't what blind Barnameus
[1:46:41] wanted. Blind Barameus wanted to receive
[1:46:44] his sight. That was the first thing. Get
[1:46:46] out of that dark world he was living in.
[1:46:48] And Jesus said, "Thy faith has saved
[1:46:51] thee."
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Turned and walked on up the road.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I can see old blind
[1:46:59] Barnameus. He's staggering yet in the
[1:47:02] dark. Walked over and got out of the
[1:47:05] crowd said, "Let me see now if I can see
[1:47:08] my hand. I believe I am. He's He's done
[1:47:11] told me what his word is. He's God. What
[1:47:15] what he said is true." Waited a little
[1:47:17] while and the crowd going up this up the
[1:47:20] road, he said, "Let's see." He told me
[1:47:22] as I believed it. I believe. Oh, I see
[1:47:25] now. Light begins to break into his
[1:47:27] eyes.
[1:47:30] And he didn't stay silent, did he? No.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me as we close tonight.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't stay silent when that light
[1:47:38] begins to break into his eyes. And
[1:47:40] tonight, brothers and sisters, we're not
[1:47:41] talking about the the the natural
[1:47:43] lights. We can see these natural lights.
[1:47:44] We're talking about the invisible light
[1:47:46] of faith. One of the gifts that God has
[1:47:49] given to the church. We're talking about
[1:47:52] his faith in our lives. And it only
[1:47:55] comes from believing. He says, "Oh, I
[1:47:56] see now." The light begins to break into
[1:47:58] his eyes. Screamed to the top of his
[1:48:00] voice and down the road he went to
[1:48:04] follow Jesus.
[1:48:06] There it is. Why? All because he had
[1:48:10] found an audience with him.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Let's just have an audience with him
[1:48:16] now.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Let's just confess our sins and our
[1:48:21] weaknesses of human beings.
[1:48:24] And you know, that's all we need to do
[1:48:28] really is just confess our humanity
[1:48:31] before him. Humble ourselves
[1:48:35] in the sight of the Lord.
[1:48:40] I just want to say this before we close
[1:48:42] tonight. I'm I'm going to bring these in
[1:48:45] the future. I'm not done with faith. I'm
[1:48:46] not even started with faith. [laughter]
[1:48:49] I don't know how we're going to be able
[1:48:50] to do this. But, you know, I just want
[1:48:53] to encourage us if you want a little
[1:48:54] homework assignment. If you don't, it's
[1:48:56] okay. I'm not trying to put any pressure
[1:48:57] on, but if you want something to think
[1:48:59] about, go and look up faith is not, type
[1:49:03] in faith is not into the message and
[1:49:07] read what Brother Brandham says about
[1:49:08] it. If we have any struggles with faith,
[1:49:11] just read what he says about it. I think
[1:49:13] it's such an encouragement because he
[1:49:15] tells us what it's not. And so if we can
[1:49:18] look at those knots and maybe see that
[1:49:21] some of the things parallel what's going
[1:49:23] on in our lives, then maybe what we can
[1:49:25] do is see that maybe what we think we
[1:49:27] have as faith just isn't really faith
[1:49:29] because the prophet said faith is not.
[1:49:33] So what is it then? And and I think
[1:49:34] there's a whole bunch that we can get
[1:49:36] into. We're not going to now. I can see
[1:49:37] that we're past nine. I just want to say
[1:49:39] God richly bless you all for coming out
[1:49:42] on a Wednesday night. It's wonderful to
[1:49:45] celebrate the life of Jesus Christ
[1:49:47] together once again. Let's just bow in
[1:49:50] prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[1:49:53] we thank you for your word. We thank
[1:49:55] you, Lord Jesus, that [music] we know
[1:49:57] that it's a living word. And father, our
[1:50:00] desire is to see this word living so
[1:50:03] strongly in our lives that Father,
[1:50:05] there's there's really no room for
[1:50:07] anything else in this world because
[1:50:10] there's nothing in this world that's
[1:50:12] really going to satisfy us as sons and
[1:50:15] daughters. Father, really the only thing
[1:50:19] that satisfies a a believer is you and
[1:50:22] your word. That is the only satisfaction
[1:50:24] in this world.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:26] Everything else pales in comparison to
[1:50:29] you, Father. Lord, we know that we live
[1:50:32] in these bodies. We live in these minds.
[1:50:36] But Father, we pray that you would
[1:50:37] change our hearts.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that Lord, we could mold
[1:50:43] ourselves and shape ourselves to your
[1:50:45] word rather than trying to mold and
[1:50:47] shape your word to us. Yes, Lord.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that Lord Jesus, you
[1:50:52] would just reveal yourself to us and
[1:50:55] through us in just a greater measure,
[1:50:57] Father, as we go forwards, Lord, that we
[1:51:00] would begin to see this this faith
[1:51:02] manifesting in our lives as we've heard
[1:51:05] about that we should see these things.
[1:51:07] We should be able to have a supernatural
[1:51:10] experience in our lives and understand
[1:51:12] that it's you with us.
[1:51:16] Father, we love you and we thank you for
[1:51:18] your goodness to us. Thank you for the
[1:51:21] story of blind Bardameus, Lord, to
[1:51:24] recognize that that that truly is a
[1:51:26] believer until the moment they recognize
[1:51:29] that it has to be their own experience.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; We are all truly blind until you open
[1:51:36] our eyes. Father, I pray that you would
[1:51:39] open the eyes of our hearts, Lord.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. that you would reveal yourself to
[1:51:44] us in a greater way, Father. That Lord,
[1:51:47] we would be able to show the world all
[1:51:49] around us that you are a living God.
[1:51:51] That it is a living word. That it's not
[1:51:53] something that we preach. It's something
[1:51:55] that we live.
[1:51:57] And once in a while, we'll actually
[1:52:00] preach.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just want to commit
[1:52:02] each life into your hands. Lord, we pray
[1:52:05] that as we've read, that you would
[1:52:07] forgive us for our humanity.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; That you would forgive us for our
[1:52:11] shortcomings and our sins, Lord. And
[1:52:13] that, Father, we could just commit our
[1:52:15] lives fresh unto you once again. That as
[1:52:18] we go forwards, Lord, we would make a
[1:52:20] room for you to walk by our lives. And
[1:52:23] as you do, Father, we would just cry out
[1:52:25] to you once again
[1:52:27] every day of our lives, Lord. Father, we
[1:52:30] just ask that you would keep your hand
[1:52:32] upon each one of us now as we go our
[1:52:34] separate ways. We love you, Lord, and we
[1:52:36] thank you for your goodness and your
[1:52:38] tender mercy to us.
[1:52:40] In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing 1062? New mercy,
[1:52:51] new mercy.
[1:52:57] You make your mercy new every day.
[1:53:00] [singing]
[1:53:03] You change my life in so many [singing]
[1:53:06] ways.
[1:53:10] You cradle me in your sweet grace.
